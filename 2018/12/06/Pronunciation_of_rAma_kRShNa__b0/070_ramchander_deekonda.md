Respected Scholars,

  

I have always entered into arguments with my north Indian friends with regard to the pronunciation of Sanskrit words. They habitually pronounce all ajanta words as halanta. राम is राम् । Moreover, even the ajanta becomes halanta in the middle of the word too. Example, the name माधवी is objectionably pronounced as माध्वी While writing also in English they avoid "a" between "dh"and "vi". Similarly Lalita ललिताis pronouncedLalta लल्ता

  

I am amused that even big scholars of Hindi fail to understand that their language is highly influenced by the marauding forces of Arab and Turkey invaders. As we know, Arabic language uses vowels only for longs (dIrgha). Our Urdu is also very very difficult to read by a beginner who is not familiar with the word. To write, a word like मुकुट they only write consonants MKT. It could be read as makat and mukat or mukut.
They hardly use diacritical marks and the script does not have the facility of using vowels for shorts ह्रस्व .

  

Hindi, being a language of the masses in the northern belt of India, was used by the invaders mixing Arabic and Turkish words in their transactions in the social intercourse. Thus, the present Hindi is corrupted by those languages which do not have the tradition of using vowels for shorts.

  

Hyderabad (Telangana) being part of Nizam's (Mughal) Dominion is also a region where Arabic and Urdu have played a major role in administration and governance. Even the name of this writer is corrupted by the authorities. रामचन्द्र has become राम् चन्दर् ramchander. A thorough overhaul of pronunciation is required for all the regions of this country.

  

Short e and long e pronunciation is another area of conflict with my north Indian scholars. For them there is no difference between the pronunciation of "test" and "taste".

  

Respectfully,
