There are studies on the vowel endings in different south Indian languages. In classical Telugu grammars which focus on classical or graanthika Telugu , there are rules composed to cover these to the most extent.

  

Modern linguists studying contemporary Telugu came out with phonemic distribution rules and made mention of frequency of different vowel endings.

  

-u ending for adapting any consonant-ending loan word to Telugu is a well known observation.

  

This is used as an explanation for -u endings in native Telugu words and is explained as the Telugu-isation of the consonant-ending proto-Dravidian roots.

  

\- ḍu, -mu, -vu etc., are a different story. Though -u in them is the same as the above, Dravidian etymological explanation for each of these has different path.

  

Though like the north Indian women's dress , what used to be called Punjabi dress in my place, or chooDidaar pyjaamaa at all over the places in the south nowadays that is received and viewed as 'modern' dress, the consonant-ending personal names with Sanskrit origin are north Indian influence and are recieved as modern culture.

  

But different traditional local ways of name-endings for the same continues. My own name is found as consonant-ending in all the official records. Bu my Telugu friends call me Naagaraaju and spell my name in English as Nagaraju. My Kannada friends call me Naagaraaja and spell the same in English as Nagaraja. My Tamil friends call me Naaharaajan/Naaharaachan though they spell the same as Nagarajan.

  

In the very beginning of my participation in this thread, I said that a Hindi speaker pronouncing राम as राम् while speaking Hindi is not 'wrong' . It is the Hindi way of doing things. It is similar to rāmuḍu of Telugu rāmanu,of Kannada and rāman of Tamil or Malayalam.

  

But observations pointed out from the videos shared are about north Indian pronunciation of Sanskrit words while pronouncing them as part of Sanskrit only.

  

'wrongs' in pronunciation of Sanskrit words while pronouncing them as part of Sanskrit only are not uncommon among south Indians. Mother tongue influence in Sanskrit pronunciation is a pan-Indian phenomenon.  

  

But that is different from the methods of borrowing Sanskrit words into different Indian languages.
