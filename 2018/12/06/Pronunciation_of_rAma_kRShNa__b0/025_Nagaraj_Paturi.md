Leave alone classification, talking about how script is pronounced in a given language as a characteristic feature of that language itself is an upside down approach.

  

Fundamental form of any language is it's spoken form. All languages have this form. Written form may or may not exist for all languages. In the case of a language where the written form exists, one should talk about how a given pronunciation is written down in that language and not about how a written form is pronounced.
