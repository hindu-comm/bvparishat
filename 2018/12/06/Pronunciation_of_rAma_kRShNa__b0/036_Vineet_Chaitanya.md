Dear Shree Balasubramanian Ramakrishnan ji,  

  

      I acknowledged in my original mail that South Indians "do not elongate" the vowel under discussion. I had used the word

"ह्रस्व आ" to convey your point. But I claim it is typically "विवृत". In other words the last सूत्र of Ashtaadhyaayii is typically ignored because of habit.

  

     The point under discussion in the original question was about isolated words like राम and कृष्ण.

  

Regards
