I am also South Indian and I bave never heard short and long vowels changed as mentioned earlier. But Sanskrit songs containing short vowels are sometimes elongated by well-known singers northern or Southern carnatic singers to adjust the music. In Hindi speakers, the examples cited by thread initiator is pronounced as if they are halanta-s. My teacher had said the 'a' pronounced as "samvrita" and correct according to Panini as suggested by an earlier member also. But it is not heard in every instance like Rama and gaja. In the first the long A is विवृत and and short vowel a is संवृत. This is fine with राम in vocative case in Sanskrit. In nominative रामः or गज or गजः I haven't heard such sound. Better it is the influence of Hindi pronunciation on Sanskrit प्रातिपदिक only used in Hindi. Will have to be tested in declined forms like रामस्य, कृष्णस्य etc.
