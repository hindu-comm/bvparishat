Dhanyavad to all for the detailed explanations.

  

Yes, professor Nagaraj ji, my question was because of a spiritual discourse two years ago at our temple in Bradford.

  

At that time, a guru from Haridwar has delivered भागवत कथा. During that time he mentioned " राम् , कृष्ण् are the correct pronunciations, however south Indians tend speak राम, कृष्ण which is not correct. ". However after learning basics of संस्कृत I have realised the other way around. He had also mention that कृष्ण means Drupadi.

  

Now, I have got my doubt cleared that, the pronunciation is different from संस्कृत and हिंदी.

  

धन्यवाद
