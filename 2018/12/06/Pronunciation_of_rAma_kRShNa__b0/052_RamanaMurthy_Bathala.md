Dear Sir,

  

Pronouncing (in Hindi) कृष्ण without अa as कृष्ण् is not correct.

  

1\) Here is the Bhajan song in Hindi sung by Swamiji. I attended the Swamiji's Bhajan programs during festivals. Swamiji clearly sung with अa at the end in कृष्ण.

Here is the link to the video:

2\) Even according to the Hindi grammar books, अa should not be omitted in the conjunctletters occurringat the ending of words such as कृष्ण (as ष्ण is conjunct letter) . Please find the red markings on the screenshot substantiating this.
