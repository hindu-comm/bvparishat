A new nasty movement has begun in Karnataka  

of divesting the *dIrgha* and *mahAprANa* of *all* words!

Even conjunct consonants are not spared distortions!  

A few journals are even entertaining articles in this new "Kannada",

which is given a grand appellation viz. Ellara Kannada (The Kannada of "All").

  

The main impetus seems to be little else than crass anti-Brahminism,

which reduces itself to nothing but (anti-Vedism and) anti-Sanskritism.

In Kannada, and as must be in several Indian languages,

there is almost no poet or writer who is not, first and foremost, a sociologist,

if not also a socialist or communist - especially if honoured by the State/Central Govt.  

  

Typically, if you just criticise publicly, say, the Ramayana as oppressive,

you are likely to be shortlisted for some award  

(consider Sheldon Pollock as recipient of Padmasri),

and you will automatically be elevated as or looked upon  

as an expert linguist also as a bonus.

  

And the roots of this anti-Brahminism goes back to

the Herculean efforts of Christians to ennoble the heathen in his blindness,

for it is Brahmins who were their main hurdle as they were intellectual.

Max Muller and Monier Williams dreamt of the White Flag fluttering all over South Asia.

For Farquhar, Christ was "the crowning glory" of Hinduism.  

Whitney's contempt for the "native grammarians" is not unknown either.

All this is no thing of the past : even today Bronkhorst can consider  

Brahmins and plague as coplanar, see his paper in WSC - 17.  

  

The primary sutra is : disrupt Brahminism via  

distorting Sanskritand whatever is related to Sanskrit.

  

This "movement" is by no means on par with

*daivI vAg vyavakIrNeyam as'aktair abhidhAtRbhiH*

of Bhatrhari.
