It is strange that राम is written without a at the end. Without a at the end shouldn't it be written as राम् in Devanagari? Sanskrit is known to be pronounced as written. रामः is Sanskrit word declined word and also राम is a declined form from the noun राम in the vocative. And both differ in meaning and why should there be any confusion between Hindi and Sanskrit? The question was about pronouncing it without a at the end in Hindi only and it follows the rule of pronunciation for Hindi words.
