No, Ravi Kishore ji,

            Your conclusion is not correct.

             Hindi is also, almost, pronounced as it is written; except in the case अकारान्त words due to a habit which I call a "bad habit" they drop final 'अ', in case of कमल it is pronounced as कमल् . Again in case of अकारान्त words where final अ is immediately preceded by a consonant conjunct the final अ is pronounced correctly. For example, कृष्ण is pronounced as कृष्ण.

  

  

              Also, please, do not assume that all other Indian language speakers pronounced the words, exactly as they are written!

              But yes, our situation is much better than the case of English.

Regards
