Dear Professor Paturi

I agree with you on this point.I know sometime back Prof.Jaymant Misra tried to practise and propagate this pronunciation such as घट as ghata but he could not get success.Pronunciation varies from area to area due to various factors.Prof.Macdonnel has also pointed it out in his Vedic Grammar for students.Almost Sanskritists all over the World write the word Sanskrit without a at the end which is also strange.l fail to understand when this error entered in North India.Does it indicate a might have been of two types:1.Vivrita and 2.Samvrita.

Panini formulates the rule एङि पर रूपम्.but त्रयो अस्य पादा-here this rule does not apply.I would like to request the Paninians to think it over beyond the bounds of Panini.Panini's rule अअ is explained that Phonetically अ is Samvrita but Phonologically it is assumed ViVrit for his operational convenience in अकःसवर्णे दीर्घः,etc.

I had thought some years back to think it over going to the deep levels but at present could not do due to my engagement in another project.

I am not sure whether my views and proposals may be conducive to Indian Shastri tradition.

Pranamami.
