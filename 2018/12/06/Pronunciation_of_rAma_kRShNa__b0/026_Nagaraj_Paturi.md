Sri Kalyan-ji,

  

That's a good question.

  

Yes, you are right. Sanskrit is not written just in Devanagari. It is written in several Indian scripts Telugu,. Grantha etc. also.

  

A statement 'Devanagari is the (only) script of Sanskrit ' would have been wrong.

  

'Script of Sanskrit is Devanagari' may sound like Devanagari is the only script of Sanskrit.

  

The context was to say that when Devanagari is the script used for both Hindi and Sanskrit, rules of writing

are the same.
