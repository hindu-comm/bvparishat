Dear Sir,

  

When reading the Sanskrit books written in English, we come across the word "Substantive".

The Webster Dictionary defines:

Substantive: a word or word group functioning syntactically as a noun.

  

In Sanskrit, noun has inflections. There are eight cases and 3 numbers. so 8X4 = 24.

Also there is stem (प्रातिपदिका). So 24 inflections + 1 stem = 25 noun forms.

Can all these 25 forms can be considered as Substantives?

  

Regards

Ramana murthy
