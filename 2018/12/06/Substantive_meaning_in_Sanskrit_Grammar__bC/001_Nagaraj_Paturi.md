"Substantive" is an old fashioned grammatical term. It is not a contemporary word.

  

In Sanskrit, when subanta, tinganta and avyaya or naama, aakhyaata and avyaya are the grammatical categories, nouns and adjectives form part of subanta/naama category. When a similar situation existed in classical European languages, the word substantive was used in reference to word forms that functioned both as nouns and adjectives.

  

प्रातिपदिका is not to be counted as one of the functional (pada = word) forms of a subanta/naama s'abda. If you use the word substantive as a translation for subanta/naama s'abda, then we can say that 24 forms mentioned by you are all different functional forms of the same substantive. All functional forms of a subanta /naama s'abda are referred to as substantives to distinguish them different functional forms of say , a dhaatu, which are called kriyaapadas.
