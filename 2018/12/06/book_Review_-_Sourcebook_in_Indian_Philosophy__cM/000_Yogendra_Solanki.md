Namaste to All,

  

I am reading this book - A Sourcebook in Indian Philosophy edited by Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles A. Moore.

  

I already read beginning portion of the book. Now I am reading The Epic Period.

This section starts with - " The Epic Period derives its name from the two epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. The Ramayana deals with the conflict of the Aryans with the then natives of India a nd of the penetration of the Aryan culture".

  

There are many books which are biased against India and Hinduism. So I ask this forum to advise if this book is good to read to understand Indian Philosophy.

  

Pranam,
