Dear Sri Yogeshji  
  
Most books on epics contain both wheat and chaff. We must try to separate out the wheat from the chaff. Take the wheat and ignore the chaff. The other day I was reading a book on the epics, written by a western author, where the author sees interpolations almost everywhere. This is interpolation, that is interpolation, blah blah blah with no proper justification. After sometime, the book just put me to sleep. :)  
  
Coming back to the point, I did not read the particular book that you refer to. So I cannot comment on it. If you are looking for a comprehensive introduction to Indian Philosophy, please check - A History of Indian Philosophy, by S. Dasgupta, in 5 volumes. The last time I checked, the book was available on [archive.org](http://archive.org). There might be both wheat and chaff in this book also (its been long since I read them).  
  
Ultimately, if you want to learn more about any particular darshana, it would be better to go to the source books of that school. Various translations of source books are available. Wishing you all the very best in your endeavor.  
  
Regards  
Kalyan
