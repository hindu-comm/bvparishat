A wonderful personality who was moulded by Sathguru Kandukuri Sivananda Murthy Garu and disciple of Ganapati Muni.

  

A foreigner (sorry for using this word !) having initiated into the tantric path and got diksha name as 'vamadeva sastry' and wrote 'why I am a hindu' and ironically an Indian (hyderabadi. would rather hate to bring his name..) wrote a book 'why I am not a hindu'.

  

What a stark difference of samskArAs in human beings !

  

rgs,

sriram
