A similar instance of a great scholar from Nagpur,the late Dr.Shrikant Jichkar who performed for himself the thread.ceremony and his Hindu/Brahmin friend and a Prof.of Sanskrit derided him for this type of a Sanskaar.By the way,I may point out that Dr.Jichkar had earned nearly 18 or so degrees from different fields of learning and was the most ardent proponent of a Sanskrit Uni.in Maharashtra.

  

Only Sanskaaras matter and no caste etc.I was told that Dr.Jichkar was from the Teli(oil.vendor)community.
