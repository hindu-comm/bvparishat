Namaste Sushma ji,

  

To my knowledge there is some non-academic curriculum regarding teaching of science in Sanskrit for children of schoolgoing age developed by Prof Chandragupta Warnekar from Nagpur. The institute he is associated with also conducts periodical exams on the course and provides certificates. I am not aware of the finer details. He can be contacted on his email - [cswar...@gmail.com]().

  

With bestregards
