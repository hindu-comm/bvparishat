Namaste,

  

The D.Litt Thesis of my rAmAyaNa teacher, unfortunately reached the abode of rAmachandra couple of years back, is online. His name was Brahmasri Malladi Gopalakrishna Sarma Garu who was inspiration for me in "rAma-bhakti". He inspired me to recite Srimad Ramayana daily. He was a scholar par-excellence and was awarded the title "vimarshaagresara" ie., the "foremost in literary criticism". He was the disciple of Kanchi Paramacharya and Malladi Swamulavaaru of Anantaram. He studied under Bulusu Appanna Sastry Garu, Peri Venkateshwara Sastry Garu and Jayanthi Bhageeratha Sastry Garu.

  

This monumental work on Ramayana was his D.Litt thesis for which he was awarded Doctor of Literature and honoured by the then President of India Dr.Shankar Dayal Sharma. Kanchi Paramacharya was so impressed with the work that His Holiness personally went thru the work and presented a costly "kashmiri shawl" to Sastry Garu in Kanchipuram and applauded in front of several audience.

  

This work is in Sanskrit and the script is devanaagari.

  

It isश्रीमद्रामायण मीमांसा. A wonderful book in simple & easy sanskrit and even beginners can understand this. This was composed by Sastry Garu after several years of japa of rAma-mantra. Even on the death bed also, when he was in unconscious state, his lips used to vibrate a bit with "rA" & "ma" upon close observation.

I had the honour of receiving his personal copy of this from Sastry garu and he blessed me saying "may you attain rAma-bhakti". The same was translated into Telugu with 2 volume under the title "srimadrAmAyaNa vaibhavamu". His other works are "sundarakanda loni saundaryamu" , "rudra bhashyamu" etc.

  

rgs,

sriram
