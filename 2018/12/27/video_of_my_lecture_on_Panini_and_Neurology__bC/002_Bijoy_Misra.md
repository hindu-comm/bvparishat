I did send the paper privately.  

While I am on the topic, I do invite people to collaborate if you have time and strong interest.

Good thing about language research is that many of the empirical experiments can be

done in our own individual setting, but we must create an attitude of total objectivity,

completely from the first principles. Science has to totally separate from any religious view

of any kind. The early Indian studies in the west have been strongly tainted through the bias

and the view of the administrators. You must reject those views completely.

I also notice a lot of correlation views. Though some speculations did develop through

rituals in some form of scare of survival, all Indian contributions in mathematics, grammar and

psychology have been scientific and thorough. We have to be travelers in that tradition.

We may do mangalashloka but only after having done well-disciplined work.

The time scales of Language production is very small and we don't have sensors yet.  

Various statements like grammar in a gene are arbitrary. We need experimenters who

can observe their own recitation.

In any case, please contact me if you wish to enter into this research.
You must not

think unless you can dedicate at least one day a week fully in studying and research.

Of course, you can formulate another view to proceed in research.  

Best regards.

Happy New Year.
