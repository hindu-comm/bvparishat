Rishi Goswami ji,

    It appears that you have difficulty in understanding the meaning of the sutra itself.

    For detailed discussion on P.7.4.93, please refer to Vol.13 of "The Ashtadhyayi of Panini" by Prof. S.D. Joshi. It will clear all your doubts.

    If you do not have access to this work, here is the link:

    Best wishes

    Narayan Prasad
