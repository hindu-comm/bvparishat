Thanks Prasad Mahoday. This is the Balamanorama I'm posting because internet doesn't have the text available anywhere of this particular Sutra, rest are available though.

So, this is what I have concluded, there is Sthanivadbhaav for Ni. Because "LuptaNim AadAya Laghuparaka-abhyAsah" is accepted in this method.

  

Regards

Rishi
