Respected Scholars,

  

Now we can speak in our mothertongue and google keyboard will type for us

I have tested, it works well in Marathi/Hindi. But somehow Samskrit support is missing! Does anyone have any luck with any other tool?

  

Or can someone raise this on the right forum? So that Samskrit's support is added.

  

Regards,

Vikram
