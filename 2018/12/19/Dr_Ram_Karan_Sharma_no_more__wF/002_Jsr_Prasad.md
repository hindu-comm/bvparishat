One of the very few finest Vaiyakaranas I ever saw. Very kind hearted, generous and accessible. His contributions not only limited to Samskrita scholarship, but to NGOs like IASS are remembered for ever.

  

Dr. Bhagavan Das (Ayurveda) and Prof. Ramkaran Sharma translated Carakasamhita along with Cakrapani's notes in English. The translation is so perfect that any Ayurveda scholar in want of translation, take resort in this magnum opus.

  

Truly a yasahkaaya. His demise on an auspicious ekadashi day will surely lead Him to paramagati.

  

With respects.
