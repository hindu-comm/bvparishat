Dear Friends,

I had only a couple of occasions to meet Prof. Sharma --- during the World Sanskrit Conference, and that too while traveling in tbe bus from hotel to the venue of the conference. But even that short interaction left a deep impact in me.  

Besides scholarship, one most outstanding quality that I could notice in Prof. R.K. Sharma is humility. To me he seemed to be a just a bundle of humility, had no preconceived notions, was a free-thinker, and quite accessible to all. He was indeed was a shining example of what Sri Adi Shankaracarya notes in his commentary to the phrase -- बाल्यं च पाण्डित्यं च निर्विद्याथ मुनिः -- that we find in the Brihadarankopanishad.

Sad that we will be missing this great personality, who is worth emulating!

Best regards,

-ram.
