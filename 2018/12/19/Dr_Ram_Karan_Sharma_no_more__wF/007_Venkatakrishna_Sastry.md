Namaste

  

Sad to see the exit of one more senior scholar of Samskrutham  from this mundane world.

I cherish the memories i was with Sharma ji at his place and some of the conferences where he straightened me on the question of 'Samskrutham: legacy of scholarship for next generation: What we should be doing, teaching now and how ?

  

May he attain shaaswata Brahmaloka.
