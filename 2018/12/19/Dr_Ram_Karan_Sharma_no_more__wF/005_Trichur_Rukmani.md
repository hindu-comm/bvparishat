Just learnt of the sad news of Prof. R.K.Sharma. This is indeed a great loss to the Sanskrit world of scholarship. Such Sanskrit scholars are becoming a rare commodity. Ours has been a long friendship and the last I met him was at Bangkok. I remember the numerous occasions when Sharmaji would regale us with Sanskrit quotations from many sources. My deepest sympathies and condolences to Bhabhiji and his extended family.
