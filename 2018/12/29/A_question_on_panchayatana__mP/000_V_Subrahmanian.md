In the following book, downloaded from the link below, provided by Sri Shankara ji:

  

Buhler's catalogue of manuscripts in Gujarat is available at  

<http://wujastyk.net/mscats/Sanskrit_Catalogues/Biswas%200359%20Gujarat%20-%20Buhler/>

  

on p.vii of the Preface, in the footnote is found a grouping of five Atharvashirsha-s (upanishad) pertaining to five deities as enumerated therein. Since the even now popular Panchayatana puja practiced in many vaidika groups the five deities are present, my curiosity is aroused by the group name found in this text. Is there any history to this particular name/prefix 'panchayatana' in this connection? Any inputs in this context could throw light on the topic.

  

Thanks,
