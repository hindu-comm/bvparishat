Dear Shri Ramakrishnan,

  

  Thank you for the link to the complete recitation of the Ghanapāṭha of the Kr̥ṣṇa Yajurveda. This is a wonderful gift for the new year. I know that there was an institution in Pune with the name Veda-Vikr̥ti-Lekhana-Kāryālaya. During my student days, I used to pass by the building with this board almost daily. I wonder if they are continuing their work, and if any of their work has been published. Our Pune friends may be able to provide some information on the current state of this activity. With regards,
