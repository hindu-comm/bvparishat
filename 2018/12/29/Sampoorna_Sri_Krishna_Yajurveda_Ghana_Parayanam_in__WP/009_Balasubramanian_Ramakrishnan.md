Prof. Deshpande,

  

Please take a look at

<https://archive.org/details/VEDAVEDAMVEDICYAJURVEDAKRISHNAYAJURVEDACOMPLETEAUDIOSAMHITAARANYAKABRAHMANAMSriK/08+Krishna+Yajurveda+Samhita+From+Kancheepuram+Pamdits_AUDIO_MP3+COMPLETE/YajurvedaPart36.mp3>

  

This is a link to the acchidra prashnam. You can find links to a whole bunch of recitations by different paNDita-s there. It’s not properly labeled.

  

The mp3s with titles YajurVedaPartXX.mp3 were released by an organization called Vediclinks about 2 decades back. These are absolutely the gold standard in kR^iShNa-yajus recitation and very faithfully preserve the injunctions from the various shikShA texts. You will definitely enjoy these. However they did not release ghana, except for namakam.

  

Ramakrishnan
