Dear Prof. Deshpandeji!

  

Namaskar.

  

I tried my best to elicit info. and data, for publishing/programming/academic research, the manual work on writing all vikrti-s of Rgveda by this institution

through Prof. Bhagyalata Pataskar, who seems to be currently in a position to help in this regard. She says the work is completed, but due to some organisational issues, not brought out.

  

I have some volunteers RgVeda kramapathi-s wanting to do data entry, laksana study correlation etc. for bringing this monumental work to traditional users.  

I have not been successful so far with reluctance from the other side baffling.

  

If you could help in any way, you are most welcome.

  

Regards

  

Ramanujan
