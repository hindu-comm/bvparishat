Namo vidvadbhyah,  
Shri gurubhyo namah.  
I am looking for this paper / book by Professor Sangam Lal Pandey - Pre-Samkara Advaita Philosophy, (Allahabad: Darshan Peeth, 1974).

Would be grateful if someone can point me to where I could access / buy this publication. As far as I can see, it has not been uploaded to [archive.org](http://archive.org).

Kind regards,  
Venkatraghavan
