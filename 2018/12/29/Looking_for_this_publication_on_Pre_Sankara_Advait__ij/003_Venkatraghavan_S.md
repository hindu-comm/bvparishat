Just to follow up on this.

  

I have managed to locate the paper "Pre Sankara Advaita" by S L Pandey. It

is included as one of the chapters in the book titled 'History of Science, Philosophy and Culture in Indian Civilization - Volume II Part 2 - Advaita Vedanta' edited by R Balasubramanian, a work which I have recently purchased.
