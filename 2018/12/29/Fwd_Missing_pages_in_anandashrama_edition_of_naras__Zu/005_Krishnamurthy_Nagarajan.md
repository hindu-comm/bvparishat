Respected Veeranarayana Pandurangiji,

  

I think the missing pages (as available in [https://archive.org/details/NarasimhaTapaniUpanishadSankarabhashyaIntroductionIndexMissing/page/n119)](https://archive.org/details/NarasimhaTapaniUpanishadSankarabhashyaIntroductionIndexMissing/page/n119) are the mantra part of the पञ्चम Upanisad. The links for the missing pages as available in two other links of Narasimha Tapni Upanisad are given as under.
