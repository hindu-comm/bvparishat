Sarvebhyo namah

I have scanned copy of anandashrama edition of narasimha tapaniya Upanishat (with commentary of vidyaranya) probably from DLI. But 126-127 pages are missing here along with some not very clear scans of some pages. I have another commentary published by adyar with Upanishat brhmendra yogi.

  

If another scan of anandashrama edition is available with anyone of you, I will be fortunate to get it as soon as possible.

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि। ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।  
तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः। निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
