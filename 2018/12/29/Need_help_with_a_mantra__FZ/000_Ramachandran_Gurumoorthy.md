NamastE,

  

This is my first post. Please excuse if the topic isn't suited to the group's goal.

  

I am looking for the source & the nyaasaas of this mantra. So far, my searches in Mantra Mahaarnava, Sharada Tilaka Tantra and Google haven't yielded much. Appealing to the experts here to throw additional light on this.

  

*"Krishna Krishna Maha Yogin*  
*Bhakthanam Abhayamkara*  
*Govinda Pramananda*  
*Sarva me Vasha Manayah"*  

*

Looking for:

  

- Source of this mantra

- Rishi, anga/kara nyaasas, dhyana shloka.

  

  

Thank you,

ram.
