Namaste,

  

There is a Malayalam book on Pujas named 'Saparivaaram Poojakal' which contains a section (section 430) on 'Rajagopalapuja'. You will find there the dhyanam, rishi, chandas, nyasam, etc for this mantra which is known as rajagopalamantra. It is available online at  

<https://archive.org/stream/sreyas-ebooks/saparivaram-poojakal#page/n281/mode/1up>

  

Similar books on Puja would be available in other regional languages too.  

  

regards  
shankara
