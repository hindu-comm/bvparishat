It is a pity that followers of other religions hardly celebrate our Festivals,with so much sincerity as the Hindus show to other religions.

  

We are definitely broad.minded,but,the others are very adamant in their religious matters and hardly show such a catholic outlook.

  

One of the Swamijis of the Ramakrishnan Math wrote a book on the Surmon on the Mountain relating it to Vedanta,but,how many scholars from other faiths have written on Vedanta or other topics.

  

I visited the Christ University in Bangalore and met other related officers and preachers including the Librarian,but,they could not show a single book like this,nor were they interested in such things. Why this parochial attitude?

  

It is reported that Mahatma Gandhi read Quran in the Temple,but,there is no report of his reading the Bhagavad-Gita in any Mosque.

  

Why this happened? Had he no courage to do it or our secularism is one sided to prove that we are ready to honour other religions,even if they may not show this open.mindedness.

  

Does this not amount to double standards or political gimmick?

  

A dispassionate and unbiased scholar should answer this.
