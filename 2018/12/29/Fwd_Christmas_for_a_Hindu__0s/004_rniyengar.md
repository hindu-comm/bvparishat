My two-paise!

  

There is nothing wrong or upsetting in Ramakrishna Mutt observing Christmas. They are true to the teachings of the Paramahamsa. I fully well understand the reasons put forward by those opposing such broad-minded approach on the part of Hindu organizations. Such opponents may be religio-politically correct. But enlightened Hindu Mutts like to be spiritually correct! They like to practice what they preach: Vasudhaiva KuTumbakam!

  

Best wishes
