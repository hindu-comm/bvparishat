Respected Bijoy ji

   Namaskaram. I understand that you are trying to say you celebrated Christmas with lighting at home.

   Sri Krisha says follow your swadharma. As far as I am concerned if I celebrate already existing festivals that itself is a celebration of God. New festivals from other religions is for them to celebrate.

  

Regards

  

Chandrasekar
