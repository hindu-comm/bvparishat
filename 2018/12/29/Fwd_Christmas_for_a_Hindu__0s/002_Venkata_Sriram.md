Namaste,

  

Belur Mutt too celebrates Christmas every year and this year they celebrated by inviting Archbishop

While I appreciate the ideals of Swami Vivekananda and Ramakrishna Paramahamsa because those were the days of turmoil in Bengal and Vivekananda had a grand vision of unity of religions as 'vasudhaika-kutumbakam', however, what I observe is this has become 'one-sided'. We celebrate and try to show-off our egalitarian outlook.

We have signed a petition and sent signatures to Belur Mutt to stop this nonsense but of no avail.

  

Some of the mutts & swamijis (I am not revealing here) are also celebrating Ramzaar, Bakrid, Christmas, New Year just to woo the public and to demonstrate how they love the humanity. It is all a show business ....

  

My 2 cents...
