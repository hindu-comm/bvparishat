Friends,

I am sharing this as a New Year's message from abroad.

As we make our home in a different culture, the question

of understanding does become an issue. Unknown to us  

we become default representatives of our people.

I live in Lincoln, USA, a small town next to Concord and Lexington.

The trio was the home of American Revolution. Lincoln is

a farm town holding a piece of old landscape including the

Walden Pond, where Thoreau made his Indian style cottage.

Last March some neighbors here nominated and helped me

to be elected as member in the Town Council. The town  

runs with old style grass root democracy called town meetings.

Last week I attempted to explain myself to the town through

a Christmas message. I am sharing it below in the spirit of

the holidays.  

I wish you all a Happy New Year.

Friends,

Occasionally I write these recollections, which might be of some value to some of  

in this Forum. More people like me might inhabit the town in future.
Possibly

human understanding would be better if we know each other more.

I was born as a Hindu. It was by default, I didn't do anything. I used the word when

I first applied for a US visa in 1972. After identifying as a Hindu, I thought I should  

know what it meant and procured the Bhagavadgita, a text used by the Hindus.  

The book was beautiful and the message was scientific and powerful.
That all  

objects in the universe are created by "God" and that "God" resides everywhere  

was just appealing. Analytically it reduces to a concept that God is an observer  

inside of us and all action is the mercy of God. The religious education boils down

to a thought that no object or no life is less than ours, we must take all equally.  

A Hindu is not bound by any code, it believes in a philosophy. Various people  

interpret it to fit their convenience. Various confused and strange practices have  

evolved through the flow of time.

I had my first Christmas in 1954 in our neighbor's house in our home town. In those  

days, Missionaries with long aprons walked the streets and would give us cookies.  

But they had no message to share except giving us a poorly translated unreadable  

book claiming as God's message. It was absurd and artificial.
Apparently the  

practice continues in some areas today. I did not know the word Evangelism those  

days. I must mention that the early Missionaries did install the printing press in our

town.  

In 1995, I was invited to officiate as a Hindu priest in the First Night interfaith service  

at the Saint Paul's Cathedral in Boston. I could observe various religious customs

closely though I had nothing special to offer than prayer and hugs. I continued for ten  

years. In 2001 winter, a local interfaith group Cooperative Metropolitan Ministries <https://coopmet.org> invited me to be a Director in their effort in religious understanding.  

Here I learned about the tension among the different Christian, Jewish and Islamic communities. I did serve the group until 2014.  

I began Christmas lighting at my apartment to invite my daughter's friends in High  

School in the '80s. Cambridge was a more reserved town those days. I received  

objection when I wanted to decorate our building with the holiday lights. Lately  

Cambridge Chamber of Commerce lights some of the streets to gain tourists and

boost business.  

For a Hindu, each moment belongs to God. Even though we may not remember  

God always, God remains with us all the time. We do many symbolic activities  

to feel good and my lighting the home has been one of them. God lives in the heart.

My wife joins me in wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
