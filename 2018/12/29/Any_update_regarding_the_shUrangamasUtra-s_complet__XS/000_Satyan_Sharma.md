Namaskara

  

I've been looking for the complete original Sanskrit text of the Śūraṅgamasūtra. I've seen a reference of some manuscript in China written in some indic script. I would like to know if there has been any further update or development regarding the aforesaid text's original Sanskrit version.

  

Regards

Satyan
