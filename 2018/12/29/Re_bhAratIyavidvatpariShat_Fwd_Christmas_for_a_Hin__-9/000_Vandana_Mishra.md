Namaste,

  

I would like to emphasize on the fact that our festival named " Deepawali" is being made secular in one more subtle way by calling it just a festival of lights...

Its not only fedtivalof lights or victory of good over evil but also union of a son with his mom...a union of a prince as a King ( father figure) with his Subjects, a submission of a younger brother Bharat to his repected elder brother Ram by giving him his throne on which he never sat!!! such a unique formof love n respect from various people in various forms!!! where in the world will any Itihaas illustrate!!

  

Other faiths hv just one emotion attached to their celebration...they r linear n simple.

  

Ours is a diverse n complex system, we should not simplify our things for the sake of others understanding...Let them work hard n understand us...we may help them but we should not compromise on our faith's complexcity.

  

The above peice of writing is just my deep feeling towards our "Deepawali"...

  

Dhanywaad.
