It provides a reference to what each of the aksharas indicate, from my first scan of the book. There are some direct references like the one to Guru paduka beejas. I need to spend more time to see if they map directly to some of the known associations (ex: kleem iti karshane or kaamakala).

  

Thanks,

ram.
