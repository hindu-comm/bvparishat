Even if you get an English translation of Vakyapadiyam, it does not answer your question directly.

  

I shared content which answers your question earlier too on this list. Tried in vain to locate it.

  

So let me repeat:

  

1\. Contemporary Linguists (for that matter even Anthropologists) understand/theorise that the culture of the speakers of a language gets encapsulated in their language in all its macro to micro aspects. This is called cognitive cultural approach, cognitive anthropology, cognitive linguistics etc.

  

2\. On similar lines Bhartrihari in his Vakyapadiyam says that Sanskrit encapsulates the culture of the speakers of Sanskrit. Since the speakers of Sanskrit are s'ishTas , i.e., those who have s'aasana in them, i.e., those who have dharma in them, dharma gets encapsulated in Sanskrit in all its macro and micro levels.

  

3\. Thus speaking Sanskrit imparts dharma to its speaker.

  

4\. Investigating into the structure of Sanskrit, i.e., doing vyaakaraNa ( \< vi+ aa+ kri ) = i.e., doing splitting Sanskrit sentences into words, and words into prefixes, roots and suffixes etc., helps understand dharma. Ultimately that leads to the realisation of Bramhan manifest in the form of language. That is how vyaakaraNa is a spiritual practice leading to Moksha.

  

If you are speaking to lay audience, you may explain the point by giving the examples of deeply cultural expressions in Sanskrit that do not have translations in English or other languages.
