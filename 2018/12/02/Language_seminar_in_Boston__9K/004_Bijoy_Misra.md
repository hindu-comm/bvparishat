Friends,

Please do let me know if any of you would like to get to the research into the  

scientific aspects of phonetics and grammar. I can send you the papers.

It needs some basic Physics, some quantitative thinking and of course,  

some curiosity to analyze what you hear and what you speak. Initial  

investment of time could be four to six hours a week for three months.  

We need field testing through as many voices and samples we can.

Thank you.

BM
