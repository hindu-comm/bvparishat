Namaste,

  

The images attached to your mail seem to be from a book on astrology. Since you are looking for Mahabharata with English translation, you may go for Parimal Publications' edition of Mahabharata with MN Dutt's translation in 9 volumes. It seems this is the only edition of Mahabharata that contains both the Sanskrit text as well as English translation.  

  

<https://www.amazon.in/Mahabharata-Vyasa-Sanskrit-Text-English/dp/8171101968>  

  

It is also available for online reading at Indian Scriptures website.

regards  
shankara
