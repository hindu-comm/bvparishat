Dear Nityānand,

  

It would help if you reproduce and let us know the online sources you have come across.

  

Somehow the compounding of nāma(n) and dhāraṇa makes me think that the half-verse is not a very old composition, but I have not checked and I may be wrong.

  

Could the composer’s intention not have been to say that if the progeny’s name contains the father’s name we can infer that the father must have been a scholar or an honourable scholar?

  

शुभम् अस्तु नवं वर्षम् ।

  

a.a.
