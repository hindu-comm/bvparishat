Dear Sri Kalyan-ji,

  

The Telugu words that are not borrowed from Sanskrit , Prakrit or modern north Indian languages etc. are called Des'ya words.

  

There is another grouping in traditional Telugu grammars called aachchhika or achcha tenugu words. This group contains Des'ya words and Tadbhava/vikriti/vaikrita words together.

  

There are Amara Kosa type verse-form synonym dictionaries in Telugu which cover the aachchhika or achcha tenugu words.

  

But there is no separate list of Des'ya words made in traditional works.

  

All Telugu dictionaries provide you information of whether the word in the entry is Des'ya, Tatsama, Tadbhava or Anyades'ya.

  

But that is not a separated list of Des'ya words.

  

So if you want to have a separated list of Des'ya Telugu words, unfortunately such a work is not there.

  

Another way is to consult DED Dravidian Etymological Dictionary which includes Des'ya words from all the 'Dravidian' languages.
