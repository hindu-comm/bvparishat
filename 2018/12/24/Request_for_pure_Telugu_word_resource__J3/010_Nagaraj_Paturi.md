Yes, M V S Siva Prasad garu, you are wrong in two counts:

  

1\. When someone asks for a list of words, answer is not to say, 'even I did not understand'.

  

2\. I already clarified that acca tenugu is not limited to native Telugu , non-Sanskrit words. It includes Sanskrit borrowings adapted to native Telugu phonology.

Sanskrit borrowings adapted to native phonology of any Indian language are called tadbhavas. Timmakavi's book has many tadbhavas.

  

What is asked for is a list of words, but not a book, a kaavya which used the words.
