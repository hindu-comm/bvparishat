Hari Om,

  

I'm looking for the breakdown of the words of Guru Stotram and guru Paduka Stotram in English.

  

So far I have found very little and the translation wasn't good at some areas.

  

Could someone recommend any place to find this or would someone have these documents ready to share?

  

Much appreciated,

Vivek
