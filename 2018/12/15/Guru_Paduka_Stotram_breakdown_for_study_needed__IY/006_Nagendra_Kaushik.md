Hari Om,  
  
Tatpada refers to 'That' which is indicated by the word Tat in Tattwamasi mahaavakya. The 'That' is described in the first line as Akhanda Mandalakaara which also pervades all the movables and immovables.  
  
Hence,  
  
Tatpadam darshitam yena - By Him who has shown / By the Guru who has shown 'That'  
  
Tasmai Shree Gurave namah - To that Guru my salutations  
  
Regards,  
Kaushik
