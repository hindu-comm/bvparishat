Namaste,

  

There is a small mistake in guru-pAdukA stotra. This was composed by Shri.Satchidananda Shivabhinava Nrisimha Bharati Mahaswami of Sringeri.
Since, then this is chanted by Sringeri Sishyas as 'guru-paduka-stotra'.

  

I am fortunate to receive this from the holy hands of Shri.Bharati Tirtha Mahaswamigal.  

  

Instead of **कामादिसर्प व्रजगारुडाभ्यां**, it should be :**कामादिसर्पव्रजभञ्जकाभ्याम्**

  

The correct version can be seen here:
