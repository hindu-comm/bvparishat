Namaste

  

Thanks for the link to the Antiquary. Which would be the most convenient format for downloading and viewing the files? I found that downloading all 99 files there and opening each file a very cumbersome process. Is there a way to view each picture like turning each page of a book? Also, the images, some of them, are very small and can't be enlarged to read.
