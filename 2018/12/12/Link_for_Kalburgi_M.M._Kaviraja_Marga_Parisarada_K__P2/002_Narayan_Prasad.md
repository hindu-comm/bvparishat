\<\<The next best thing to the book is probably[this document](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lbvR7ElB1MiN1Rw8zDVL-ecH6PMAuMtS)- a scan of Prof Kalburgi's thesis, written in his own (beautiful) writing.>\>

  

Thank you so much Naresh Keerthi-ji for this link. It's a great pleasure to get access to the original thesis submitted in 1970. Of course, some changes might have been done in the book form published in 1973.

Regards

Narayan Prasad
