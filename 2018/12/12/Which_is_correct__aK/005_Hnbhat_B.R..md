With Mallinatha's commentary, in two books I checked, it is विभ्रमातिशयपुंषि and in another book with another commentary, it is seen as विभ्रमाभिभवपूंषि as suggested by you. The first may be a print mistake as पुंषि for पूंषि. It's the same wotd derived in the same way. But the difference is पुष् is natural ष् in the root itself, whereas in वपुस् the ष् is substituted for स् . Hence it is doubtful whether it will take lengthening of the preceding vowel उ as in वपुस् by the ruleसान्तमहतः संयोगस्य.Somebody will clarify whichever is correct. I think, it is notसान्त to apply the ruleसान्तमहतःसंयोगस्य and could get lengthening of उ. This makes the difference.
