Dear Esteemed Members,

  

We are receiving an overwhelming response from research scholars all over India. Nearly a hundred BVP members have sent their abstract for paper presentation. A good time span not less than 20 minutes will be given for presentation. Many senior members of BVP have agreed to be with us for all days. A good number of other scholars will be present in the conference. We are also planning to hold BVP members meet to discuss about the future plans of BVP. It will be a wonderful academic feast and a turning point for future direction in Indian academia.

  

Yugala Ashtavadhanam and Samskruta Yakshganam are special attraction.

  

Udupi is a beautiful tempe city. The entire coastal region is famous for temple tourism. It’s a world class educational hub also. Manipal University is worth visit place. Scholars can plan a visit with family members. Mangaluru airport is nearby airport for people who want to fly. Udupi itself has Railways station in Konkan Railway lines. Good number of busses from any place of Karnataka are available. People from Mumbai, Pune, Bangalore, Hyderabad may plan their travel by Sleeper coach or AC busses also.
