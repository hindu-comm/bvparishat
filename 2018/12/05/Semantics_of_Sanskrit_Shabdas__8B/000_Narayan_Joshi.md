Respected scholars, PaNaama

\(1\) Indian Theory of knowledge by Bijalwan (based on Nyaayamanjari of Jayant).

\(2\) The Meaning of Nouns-Sematic Theory in Classical and Medieval India-Naamaartha NirNaya of Kaundabhatta. by Prof. Madhava Deshpande.

I am delighted to read both books because my interest in

Sphotavaada and VarNavaada. Thanks. NRJOSHI
