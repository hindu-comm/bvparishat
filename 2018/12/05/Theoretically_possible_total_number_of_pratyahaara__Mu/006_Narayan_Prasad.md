\<\<From an edition of the Laghusiddhāntakaumudī that I have, here is the table of all the Pratyāhāras actually used by Pāṇini:>\>

  

Panini has used only 41 pratyaharas. Out of the 42, the no. 19, viz. चय् has been used only in the varttika. The complete list is given along with example of actual use.  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
