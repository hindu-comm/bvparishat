\<\<**May I suggest a correction ?**

**Four प्रत्याहार-s (अण्, इण्, उण् and हल्)suffer duplication. Hence even theoretical calculation should work out to only 301.**\>\>

  

Thank youश्रीपाद महोदय for your comment.

  

What you have mentioned is meant for a bit advanced student.

  

अण्, इण्, उण् appear as duplicate and confusing, because of ण् being read twice and हल् is duplicate due to the varNa ह being read rwice.

  

But अण् should be suffixed as अण्1 & अण्2. Both of them have been used, although the two are not identical.

  

अण्1 has been used, e.g., in ढ्रलोपे पूर्वस्य दीर्घोऽणः (P.6.3.111) ।  

  

अण्2 has been used, e.g., in अणुदित् सवर्णस्य चाप्रत्ययः (P.1.1.69) ।  

  

इण्1 has not been used by Panini. इण्2 has been used, e.g., inइणः षः (8.3.39), इण्कोः (8.3.57).  

  

उण् has not been used.  

  

Only हल्1 has been used by Panini, but not हल्2.  

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
