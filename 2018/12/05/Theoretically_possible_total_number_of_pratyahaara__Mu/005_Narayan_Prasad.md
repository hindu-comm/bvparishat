\<\< The rule आदिरन्त्येन सहेता implies presence of मध्यगs.Since there are no मध्यगs, even one,in theoretical प्रत्याहारs like उण्,ओङ् औच् etc., such प्रत्याहारs should be omitted even from the theoretical list.In fact Panini also never used them as they are not प्रत्याहारs in the true sense of the word.>\>

  

I fully agree with you madam.
