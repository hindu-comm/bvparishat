Entries in popular Lexicons may not always differentiate between the general meaning and the technical meaning of a Sanskrit word. For example PuNDarIka is also a lotus, but not a general one. It is पुंडरीकं सितांभोजम् \|\| But such technicalities are not always available in the Lexicons. In the case of lightning, a (scientific/technical) classification is available in the Paraas'aratantra: (Reconstructed text by RNI, JU Press, 2013. ISBN 978-81-9209-924-8)

The word सौदामिनीmay be wrong as per PaNinian convention. In some of the published Amarakos'a the word appears as सौदामनी.

MW reports that सौदामिनी is the wrong form for सौदामनी. But the source from which I took the passage (Adbhutasaagara ed by Pt. Muralidhar Jha, Varanasi, 1905) सौदामिनी-form is given as in the manuscripts used for the print version.
