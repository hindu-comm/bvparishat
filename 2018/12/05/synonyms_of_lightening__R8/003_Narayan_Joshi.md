My understanding of these words-Tadit-Static electricity (When one touches a metal door knob after walking on carpet in home in winter, one can see jumping of static from finger to knob), Vidyut electricity with positive and negative separation, and Saudaamani , the lightning in clouds. This may help. NRJOSHI
