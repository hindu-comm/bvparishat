Archana Venkatesan posted a beautiful photo of a cat on the procession palanquin of Nanguneri Perumal. I composed a few verses describing the friendship of the cat and Krishna.

  

कृष्णवर्णो बिडालोऽयं श्रीकृष्णनिकटे स्थित: ।

उभौ कृष्णौ तत: प्रीतिस्तयो: स्वाभाविकी खलु ।।

This dark cat sits next to Krishna. They are both dark, and so their mutual affection is natural.

कृष्णस्य साहचर्येण बिडाल: कृष्णतां गत: ।

साहचर्याद् बिडालस्य कृष्णो याति बिडालताम् ।।

With Krishna's association, the cat turned into Krishna, and with the association of the cat, Krishna became the cat.

बिडालकृष्णयोरत्र नास्ति भेद: कथञ्चन ।

एकस्य वासुदेवस्य द्वे रूपे पुरतो मम ।।

There is no difference whatsoever between Krishna and the cat. These are just two forms of Krishna in front of me.
