Professor,

  

Thank you for sharing your Krishna poetry and in particular these lines concerning Krishna and the cat. While I always read your Krishna poetry, I especially liked the Krishna and the cat poem. I was especially drawn to the equivalence that you draw between an 'ultimate manifestation' and an animal.

  

To a rank beginner like me in the study of Samskrta, the fact that I can clearly read these lines, understand them to a large extent and make sense is a huge deal - a complete novice.

  

Thanks again.

  

PS: Also love the fact that you provide for an English translation.
