Namaste Scholars,

  

ANVESHI Team is doing yeoman service in creating Sanskrit documentary films and covering all the ancients monuments / temples etc. that are of archaeological importance.

  

Recently, they started a documentary on 'srivaari-mettu' which has sent goose bumps for me. They are committed towards promotion of such documentaries in future too thru the medium of sanskrit only.

  

Pls pass on the message to all our sanskrit, art & archaeology lovers so that they would get more encouragement...Here is a link to watch the 1st episode;

The sanskrit commentator is Dr.Nandan Rao Bhatt who works with SVBC channel and is a well-known sanskrit newsreader in the same channel.

  

rgs,

sriram
