In the MW dictionary page<http://sanskritdictionary.com/?iencoding=iast&q=vipratipatti&lang=sans&action=Search>shared in another thread, there is a mention of a work with this name:

  

[brahmajñānavipratipatti](http://sanskritdictionary.com/brahmaj%C3%B1%C4%81navipratipatti/159669/1)  

  

Could we trace the work to any particular school of Vedanta?

  

warm regards
