Dear Learners of Panini,

 If any of you as adult learners of Panini want that I should help in learning, I am ready to do that. My method will be a bit different from the methods generally adopted by others. But all I have to say is that whatever you learn, whether a few selected sutras, or the complete Panini grammar, study in the order of the Astadhyayi.

 The meaning of a Panini sutra is hidden in the sutra itself. First try to understand the meaning of a sutra, with the help of all the anuvrttis taken together. Then just try to understand the function of that sutra in the examples given. In the beginning do not bother about the complete derivation, although you may read the whole derivation.

 I would recommend the following books to start with:

(1) Astadhyayi Bhashya Prathamavrtti – 3 Vols (in Hindi) \[If you can read a text in Devanagari, even if you don’t know Hindi. Definitely you will be able to recognize the sutra nos. given.\]

(2) Vyakaran Chandrodaya – 5 Vols. (in Hindi), by Charudev Shastri, esp. Vol.3 (most important) & 4.

(3) The Astadhyayi of Panini – 6 Vols. (For understanding the meaning of the sutras, only if you don’t know Hindi.)

(4) Astadhyayi Sutrapatha – esp. sutras broken into constituent parts by hyphens and giving the anuvrttis (e.g. the one edited by आचार्य सत्यनारायण शास्त्री खण्डूड़ी).

(5) Panini Dhatupatha – It may already be available in some book of the Astadhyayi Sutrapatha.

I would suggest that a separate group be formed. We can discuss matters in detail there itself. The method of learning of each learner may be a different one depending on his background of already acquired knowledge and capability.

Interested learners may contact me by private email.

If you have science or technical background, or if you are good at maths it will be an added advantage. If you are a computer programmer, you will be a great help for me as well. I have also been a computer programmer, but in the field of engineering applications.

All the best

Narayan Prasad
