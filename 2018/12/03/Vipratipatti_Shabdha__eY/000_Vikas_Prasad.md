Dear Scholars,  

  

In Monier Williams (<http://sanskritdictionary.com/?iencoding=iast&q=vipratipatti&lang=sans&action=Search>) dictionary, I found this meaning, 'sambandha' or 'mutual connection or relation' for the word Vipratipatti.

  

Can you kindly help me locate a prayoga of 'vipratipatti' that is done with this meaning?

  

Regards,

Vikas
