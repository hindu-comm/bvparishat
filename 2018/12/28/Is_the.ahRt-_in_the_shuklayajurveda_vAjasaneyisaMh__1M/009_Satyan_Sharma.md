Thanks Nagaraj Ji. I agree with you on the point regarding ‘guidance for meditation’. One may not be able to understand the expression ‘God within’ easily. So even if one understands हृदय as the physical heart, he’d stop searching for Paramaatman outside. Slowly he’d realise that Paramaatman doesn’t have any spatial location. In this sense, the indication of even the physical heart would make sense.

  

Regards.
