Thank you V. Subrahmanian ji. The problem for me is to figure out the intended meaning of ‘hrt’ by the author of sūkta itself. Also, how could a non-material entity be located only at a specific point in the body? Could it be that ‘hrt’ here could refer to some abstract sense of ‘innermost point’ which is opposed to outside or even body which is external?
