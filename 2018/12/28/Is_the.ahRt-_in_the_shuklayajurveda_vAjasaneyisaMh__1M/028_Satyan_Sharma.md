Namaskara Kamlesh Somnath Ji.Uvata and Mahidhara don’t explain much about ‘hrt’. Uvata says: ‘यच्च हृत्प्रतिष्ठं। तत्रोपलब्धेः।’, and Mahidhara says: ‘यच्च मनः हृत्प्रतिष्ठं हृदि प्रतिष्ठा स्थितिर्यस्य तत् हृद्येव मन उपलभ्यते।’ Neither of them explains what is हृत्. May be they plainly suggest that it is the मांसपिण्ड-हृदय only.
