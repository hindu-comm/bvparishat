Thanks V. Subrahmanian ji. As far as I have known, the experience of ‘I am the seer, the hearer, etc.’ is within the purview of intellect. I have never felt that such experience is happening in a certain place and not the other. In that sense, buddhi-guhā must be something abstract rather than physical. If, as per the Vedāntasāra, we take buddhi to be a निश्चयात्मिकान्तःकरणवृत्ति, then as buddhi is just one expression of the antahkarana, the default antahkarana may be regarded as the buddhi-guhā and hence hrdaya.
