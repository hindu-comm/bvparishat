The idea behind the above statement is: All objects are finite, which means they are limited by space and time. Brahman is infinite and hence not limited by space and time. In order to help aspirants succeed in realizing Brahman the Upanishad specifies a 'location' where one can concentrate and realize it. A few sentences after the above cited passage, Shankara gives the analogy of meditating on Vishnu (all-pervading Truth) in a saligrama (finite object) -यथा विष्णोः सालग्रामः।
