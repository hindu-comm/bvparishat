Thank you Nagaraj ji. This is very informative. I have a doubt here; if Paramātmā is inside and outside (अन्तर्बहिश्च तत्सर्वं व्याप्य नारायाणः स्थित:), why is he/it being located in the hrdaya (physical)? If हृदय is a मांसपिण्ड, it is a part of जगत्, and hence it should be just like every other thing as far as the presence of Paramātmā (or alike) is concerned. Kindly guide.
