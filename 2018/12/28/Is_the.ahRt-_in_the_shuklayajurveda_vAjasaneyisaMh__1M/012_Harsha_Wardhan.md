Namaskar to all,

  

The general subject-matter of this question has practical relevance too.

  

Sri Ramana Maharshi, who followed the jnana yoga path in the vedanta tradition, was said to be of the opinion that the word 'heart' referred not to the physical organ but a sort of ahamkara (ego or identity) cluster (chitta or manas based) located slightly to the right of the physical heart (ref. the center of the rib cage).

  

Swami Hariharananda Aranya, a guru of the samkhya tradition, also held a broadly similar opinion.

  

In several specific dhyanas in the yoga path, instructions pertain to locating the hrdaya or heart by bhavana (feeling) and not by spatial location.

  

with regards

harsha
