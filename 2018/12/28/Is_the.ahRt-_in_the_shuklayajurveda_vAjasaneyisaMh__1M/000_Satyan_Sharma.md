Namaskara

  

In the 34th Adhyāya of theŚuklayajurvedaVājasaneyisaṃhitā, the first 6 verses are what is popularly known as theŚivasaṅkalpasūktam. In the last verse, the 'manas' is said to be 'hṛtpratiṣṭham'. A plain translation of 'hṛtpratiṣṭham' could be 'situated in the heart/heart-region', and it could be thought of as the physical heart. But the kind of adjectives which have been used for manas in the previous verses, cause me to doubt that the 'hṛt' is indeed the physical heart. Following are some of them:

1\. apūrvam \[yasya kiñcit pūrvaṃ na vidyate\] (verse 2)

2\. yenedaṃ bhūtaṃ bhuvanaṃ bhaviṣyat sarvaṃ parigṛhītam (verse 4)

  

According to 1, manas should be 'the first and the foremost of everything', an idea which is echoed in the brāhmaṇa texts (aitareya brāhmaṇa 2.40, jaiminīya brāhmaṇa 2.174.15, etc.). And then, as per 2, manas has enveloped the 3 kālas. If manas has enveloped the 3 kālas, it should be out of the limits of time (which is represented by the 3 kālas), and if manas is the first and the foremost of everything, it might as well permeate everything. Also, if manas is out of the limits of the 3 kālas, how would it be within the limits of space? The 'sarvam' in 2 might as well indicate space or everything that is spatial.

  

Hence rises my doubt regarding whether the 'hṛt' is physical heart or something else. Kindly guide.
