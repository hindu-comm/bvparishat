This is a very interesting question. In the Taittiriyopanishad is the teaching:

  

ब्रह्मविदाप्नोतिपरम्। तदेषाभ्युक्ता। सत्यं ज्ञानमनन्तं ब्रह्म। यो वेद निहितं गुहायां परमे व्योमन्। \[He who realizes Brahman that is 'hidden/residing' in the cave, hrudaya guhaa, as is explained in the bhashya.. attains to the Supreme.\]

  

Later we have another statement in this upanishad:‘तत्सृष्ट्वातदेवानुप्राविशत्’ (तै. उ. २ । ६ । १) Brahman created and 'entered' that which it created.

  

In the long enquiry as to what exactly this pravesha 'entering' means, the conclusion is: the upanishad has specified the 'place' where one has to realize Brahman earlier. The purpose of pravesha is to show that the buddhi guhaa, heart, is the 'place' where Brahman is available for realization. It is the brahmopalabdhi sthaanam. One cannot realize brahman in any other part of the body or the outside world even though Brahman is all pervading and available everywhere. The buddhi guhaa, heart, is specified as the default upalabdhi sthaanam is because, as Shankara explains, that is where one experiences his chaitanya svarupam, in the form of 'draShTaa, shrotaa, mantaa, vijnaataa, etc.' That anubhava is not had in any other part of the body or the outside world. It is because of Brahman, in the form of the reflected consciousness in the manas/buddhi that these experiences of I am a seer, hearer, etc. is had. Hence that is the place where one can and has to realize Brahman.
