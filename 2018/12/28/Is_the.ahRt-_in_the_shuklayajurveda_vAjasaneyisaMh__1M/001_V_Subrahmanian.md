Dear Sri Satyan Sharma,

  

Your question is quite interesting and valid. The word 'hRt' in its various forms is quite popular in our vedic and related literature. For example:

  

तस्मादज्ञानसम्भूतं*हृत्स्थं*ज्ञानासिनात्मनः।  

छित्त्वैनं संशयं योगमातिष्ठोत्तिष्ठ भारत ॥ ४२ ॥ Bhagavadgita 4.42

  

4.42 Therefore, O scion of the Bharata dyasty, take recourse to yoga and rise up, cutting asunder with the sword of Knowledge this doubt of your own in the heart, arising from ignorance.

  

Shankaracharya's commentary for the relevant word is:हृत्स्थंहृदि बुद्धौ स्थितं =hrtstham, in the heart, residing in the intellect.

  

There is one more, of many everywhere, in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad: 4.4.7:

  

यदा सर्वे प्रमुच्यन्ते कामा येऽस्य हृदि श्रिताः। Here too Shankaracharya gives the meaning hrdi = intellect:  

  

अस्य प्रसिद्धस्य पुरुषस्य हृदि = बुद्धौ श्रिताः आश्रिताः

  

Thus, the term hRt will mean the manas or buddhi alternatively.

  

// apūrvam \[yasya kiñcit pūrvaṃ na vidyate\] (verse 2)// For this, you can take the word 'apUrvam' to mean 'anAdi.' For, in Vedanta, manas is no doubt a product the pancha sukshma bhutas but it is anAdi. It will exist through all janmas of the jiva, till his moksha. Only when he attains Atma jnanam, in that last birth, along with the death of the physical body, the sukshma shariram, of which the manas is a part, will also disintegrate into its causal elements.

  

For //yenedaṃ bhūtaṃ bhuvanaṃ bhaviṣyat sarvaṃ parigṛhītam (verse 4)//
The manas/intellect, anataHkaranam, is the repository of all knowledge of the past, present and what it will experience in future, when the future arrives.

  

Thus, 'hrt' or hrdayam', though physical, maamsa pinDam, as Shankaracharya has said elsewhere, is the 'container' or 'location' where the antahkaraNam is seated according to Vedanta.

  

हृदयमिति पुण्डरीकाकारोमांसपिण्डः प्राणायतनो  for the Taittiriya mantraस य एषोऽन्तर्हृदय आकाशः। तस्मिन्नयं पुरुषो मनोमयः। Here the mantra itself teaches that the heart (the space within the heart) is the location of the manas.
