Uvat and mahidhar bhashya should be considered in thiscregards,

I remember some 22/23 years ago pandit vishnudevji during his Veda dates stay at somnath explained the शिव संकल्प सूक्तम् - this is not only physical mind, this is above conscious and sub conscious mind, the power of mind which resides within heart is superior than all other things, यत्पिण्डे तद्ब्रह्माण्डे, इति न्यायेन we should consider hrut not only within body, think HRUT a part of cosmic super consciousness
