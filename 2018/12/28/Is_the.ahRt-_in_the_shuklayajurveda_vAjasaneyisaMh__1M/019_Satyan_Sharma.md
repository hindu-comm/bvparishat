Namaskara

  

In the beginning of his commentary on 8th adhyaya of the Chandogyopanisad, Acarya Sankara says; यद्यपि दिग्देशकालादिभेदशून्यं ब्रह्म… तथापीह मन्दबुद्धीनां दिग्देशादिभेदवद्वस्त्वित्येवं भाविता बुद्धिर्न शक्यते सहसा परमार्थविषया कर्तुमित्यनधिगम्य च ब्रह्म न पुरुषार्थसिद्धिरिति, तदधिगमाय हृदयपुण्डरीकदेश उपदेष्टव्यः।

  

According to this, the pointing to 'hrt' or 'hrdaya' as the place of realisation of Brahman/paramaatman is only for those whose intellects cannot grasp something which is out of the limits of space and time.
