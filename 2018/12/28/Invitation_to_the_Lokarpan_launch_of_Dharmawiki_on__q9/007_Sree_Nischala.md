Surely Dr. Rukmini Maam, I would be more than happy to give you the information as requested. Published work and articles from scholars on various topics are most welcome, so request you to email me your papers and we will place the content with due acknowledgement. We have used many such works in one of the following ways.

  

1\. As references to concepts (link giving the details of the book/article is given)

  

2\. As direct quotes (authors verbatim statements about a concept are directly incorporated with acknowledgement)

  

3\. As articles edited to suit the established format on the site. Interested contributors can request for an account and login credentials and they can themselves add the content relevant to the topics as per their expertise/interest (content guidelines will be given).

  

We are in the process of fine tuning the procedures and guidelines further. A private communication for greater details are welcome.
