Here I am reproducing part of the post of Sri Venkatraghavanji from 29th May -  
  
  
//In one of the chapters of the Madhyamakahridaya dealing with the hInayAna objections to mahAyAna, the hInayAna-buddhist criticises the mahAyAna buddhist saying;  
न बुद्धोक्तिर्महायानं सूत्रान्तादावसंग्रहात् \|  
मार्गान्तरोपदेषात् वा यथा वेदान्तदर्शनम् \|\|  
The mAhAyAna teaching was not spoken of by the Buddha, either because it is not included in the sUtrAntas, or because like the vedAnta darshana, it teaches heretic paths to salvation.  
  
To this attack, the mahAyAnist replies  
वेदान्ते च हि यत् सूक्तम् तत् सर्वं बुद्धभाषितम् \|  
दृष्टान्तन्यूनता तस्मात् संदिग्धं वा परीक्ष्यताम् \|\|  
Whatever is well said in the vedAnta (upaniShads) has been taught by the Buddha. The various examples cited by the hInayAna are faulty and what is doubtful must be examined.  
  
Here is an example of pre-Sankaran Buddhist work where the opponent criticises the mahAyAna school as being similar to vedAnta! The reply of the mahAyAna buddhist is even more remarkable - there is a concession that the best elements of the upaniShads have been taught by the Buddha himself.//  
  
My post about Bhavya's actual intentions should be seen in this context.
