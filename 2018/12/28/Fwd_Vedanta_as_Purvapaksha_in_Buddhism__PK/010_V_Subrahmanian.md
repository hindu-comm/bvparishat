In the purvapaksha shlokas that I have presented with translation, there is no mention of the bheda-abheda strand of Advaita. Even Shankara, in the BSB 2.1.14, has refuted the bheda-abheda doctrine as not supported by the Upanishads and logic.

  

In the Purvapaksha the pot-space analogy has been stated clearly and I have also shown the Gaudapada verse that is on the topic. The bheda-abheda doctrine cannot use this analogy to their advantage for in their system bheda is absolutely real in samsara and abheda is also absolutely real in moksha, as delineated by Shankara in the BSB 2.1.14. The pot-space analogy is advanced to show that even in vyavahara the difference between one jiva and another is not real as, in the analogy, it is just one space that appears limited and many by the pot-upadhi.
