The self-contradiction in Olle's book HPBP is self-evident in his words:

  

The indebtedness of BS, VP and GK to Mahayana philosophy was probably not limited only to logic and epistemology. Even in an ontological

sense the MadhyamakaIY ogacara influence may be discemable. Despite the doctrinal differences between BS, VP and GK, all postulate in one way or

another the relative or illusory nature of the phenomenal world. **The fundamental reason for such an ontological reflection is, however, completely**

**different in Mahayana and in Vedanta. Whereas the former postulates the illusory nature of the phenomenal world on the basis of its dependent**

**origination, the latter tradition takes such a stand on the basis of the assumption that the world is produced by a single, all-pervading and self-**

**containing reality.** (highlighting mine)  

  

While noting such a fundamental difference, how can one talk of "The indebtedness of BS, VP and GK to Mahayana philosophy" ?

  

He expresses his awareness of this fundamental difference in the immediately following paragraph too :  

  

The doctrinal assimilation in Vedanta systematic philosophy therefore did not result in the eradication of **the fundamental difference between**

**Buddhism and Brahmanism which had existed from the time of the early scriptures of the respective traditions and of which these traditions had beenwell aware.** (Highlighting mine)

  

Yes, historically interesting aspect of Bhavya's book probably is that it documents a pre-Sankara awareness in Bauddha-Vedanta discussions about the perceived commonalities between the two.

  

For example,

  

वेदान्ते च हि यत् सूक्तम् तत् सर्वं बुद्धभाषितम् \|  

  

may provide a clue to the need for the clarification

  

नैतद्बुद्धेन भाषितं

  

in GK.

  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

Another methodological flaw in Olle's analysis is that he takes BS as an Advaitic text , disallowing the scope within the text for non-Advaitic interpretations by post-Sankara schools of Vedanta.

  

----------------------------------------

  

He looks at BS as being in communication with Buddhism whereas the well known correspondence of BS is with JS (Jaimini Sutras).
