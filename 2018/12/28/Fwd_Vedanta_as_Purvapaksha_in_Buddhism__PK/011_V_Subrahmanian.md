If Bhavya has said this in the context of bheda-abheda, then that is right in the sense that the Self is karta bhokta. But this position is also not available in the purvapaksha delineation by Bhavya. He might be saying that in relation to the Dva suparna mantra of the Mundaka that I have cited. But then, the bhokta-bird later identifies itself as non-different from the witnessing bird and hence the bhoktrutva is wrongly assumed by it in the state of ignorance. Thus Advaitins have not held the position that Bhavya appears to be criticizing.
