In the Brihadaranyaka Bhashya 2.1.20 Shankara says सर्वोपनिषत्सु हि विज्ञानात्मनः परमात्मना एकत्वप्रत्ययो विधीयत इत्यविप्रतिपत्तिःसर्वेषामुपनिषद्वादिनाम् \[In all the Upanishads the teaching that comes out is the identity of the jivatma with the paramatma. There is no disagreement on this among 'all' adherents to Upanishads.\]

  

For Shankara the Brahmasutra-based purvapakshins are all bheda vadins such as Sankhya, Vaisheshika, Yoga, even Bauddha and Jaina, Pancharatra, etc. The aspect common in these schools is the bheda. According to Shankara the Vedanta is the only school that accepts abheda and all others are thereby opponents to Vedanta. He has given expression to this in the Taittiriya bhashya too.

  

You may have your own views but Shankara's statement in the above bhashya is the guiding factor for those who want to know the position that prevailed in those days.
