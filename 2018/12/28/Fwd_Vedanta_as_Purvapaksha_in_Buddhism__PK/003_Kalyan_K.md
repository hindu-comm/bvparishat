//Here the upanishad teaches that Brahman is the JagatkaaraNam, by the word kartA. So, it is not that Brahman is endowed with kartrutva/bhoktrutva.//  
  
  
If you look at bhavya's uttarapaksha, he criticizes the positions that the Self is a kartr or bhoktr. If vedAntins at the time of bhavya were not really holding this position, one wonders why bhavya would criticize it.
