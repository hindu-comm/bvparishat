Thank you Sri Paturi ji for the post (below), highlighting the various points. Very recently in a Buddhism related seminar in Bengaluru, organized by the KSU at the IIWC, B.P.Wadia Road, Dr.D.Prahladachar (now pontiff of Vyasaraja MaTha), in his address, had made the distinction very clear:

  

While both Buddhism and Advaita hold the world to be illusory, the latter hold that the world is a superimposition on the substratum Brahman while the former do not accept an eternal substratum.

  

This point is very important for in the 'नैतद्बुद्धेन भाषितम्' statement of Gaudapada, as brought out by Shankara in the Bhashya, the eternal Consciousness of the Upanishad has not been admitted by the Buddha even though he came very close to the Upanishads by accepting the illusoriness of the world.

  

Seen in the light of these facts, the charge of 'borrowing' from Buddhism is very flimsy, not at all holding water.

  

For that mater, there will be many points of agreement across various opposing schools. Late Polagam Rama Sastry in his thesis has listed some 50 points of agreement across the three schools of Vedanta - Advaita, Vishistadvaita and Dvaita. One can also point out instances of commonality across Sankhya, Vaisheshika, Yoga, etc. on the one side and non-Advaitic schools on the other, on the basis of 1.acceptance of the reality of the world and 2. on the nAnAtva of jivas. Yet the non-advaitic schools have refuted the former set of schools even as Advaita has refuted them.

  

warm regards
