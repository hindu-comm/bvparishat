It is not clear to me that the vedAntic position being presented and criticized by bhavya is advaita or bhedAbheda or some other school. On page 81 of the above document, bhavya's uttarapaksha criticism of vedAnta is presented, where he covers both identity and difference between individual Self and supreme Self.  
  
  
  
//52. \[If it is said that the individual Self and the supreme Self are both diffe-  
rent and non-different, this should be examined in the following way:\]  
If the individual \[mortal\] Self (antarlitman) is different from the Self  
\[which rests in the supreme\] (parames.thlitman), your assertion: "All  
is the 'Person' (purusa)", 63 is rendered invalid, because the indivi-  
dual \[mortal\] Self, is different from the Self \[which rests in the  
supreme. And:\]  
53. If the individual- \[mortal\] Self is non-different from the Self \[which  
rests in the supreme\], \[then\] your assertation is \[once again\] rendered  
invalid, since the \[supreme\] Self does not at all experience pleasure and  
pain, etc. It (i.e. the mortal individual Self) could \[therefore\] not be \[identical with\] the supreme \[Self.\]//
