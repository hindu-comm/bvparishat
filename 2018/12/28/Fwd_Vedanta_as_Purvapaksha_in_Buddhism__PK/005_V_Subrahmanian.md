I copy here some observations on pages 17 and 18 of the text (not pdf page) , on the above topic:

Going by this, if one says 'Vedanta has borrowed from Buddhism', the term Vedanta has to be clarified: According to the present text it means: Brahma sutras, Vakyapadiya and Gaudapada Karikas. The above observations propose that the Brahmasutras have been influenced by Buddhistic thought. The core are of difference between the two schools is the 'affirmation of the Self (by Vedanta) and the negation of the Self (by Buddhism). According to this author the common area of these two schools is: the illusory nature of the phenomenal world. From this it follows that the Brahma sutras accept the idea of the mithyAtva of the world. Surely, such a conclusion would not be acceptable to non-Advaitic Vedantic schools. Even for Advaita, the idea of the Brahma sutras being influenced by Buddhism on this idea is unacceptable. And it has to be borne in mind that all schools of Vedanta of the present and the pre-Shankara strands, have not denied the eternality of the Atman (called svabhava' in Buddhist terminology) in this book.

  

These two footnotes on p 18 of the text are important, especially the first one which admits that there is no finality on who borrowed/stole from whom. Thus, Bhavya's opinion does not carry much weight in such matters.

On p.104 the observation, a reiteration of the one made at the beginning of the book (cited above): The Brahmasutras have been influenced by Buddhism:

If they have said that Vedanta has stolen from Buddhism, those on the Vedanta side too have not remained silent spectators to the charge:

  

मत्तविलासप्रहसनम्’ '

  
वेदान्तेभ्यो गृहीत्वार्थान् यो महाभारतादपि ।  
विप्राणांमिषतामेवकृतवान्कोशसञ्चयम् ॥  
  
Mahendravarman in his work 'mattavilAsaprahasanam' says this about the coming into being of the Buddhistic system:  
  

//Taking material from the UpaniShads and also from the MahAbhArata (which includes the BhagavadgItA), Buddha, even as the brAhmaNa-s (vaidika-s) were wide awake, accomplished a great fortune - literally filled up his coffers - (of establishing a vibrant system).//
