//Bhavya devotes several verses in the purvapaksha for the pot-space analogy and states the position of the analogy there as ekataa, samataa. He paraphrases the Mundakopanishad mantra first and uses the mantra-word saamyam later in the pot-space context. He also gives the analogy of the clay unity in the face of the clay-product diversity. All this in the purvapaksha is applicable for Advaita.//  
  
  
"All this is applicable to advaita" is different from "All this can only be applied to advaita". If your position is former, then no disagreement. But then, most of this is applicable to bhedAbheda too. In any case, based on Bhavya's uttarapaksha, it can be said for sure that vedAntins of that time had different opinions on the relation between individual and supreme self.  
  
  
//Thus, whether one likes or not, without resorting to Shankara it would be impossible for anyone to connect with Bhavya.//  
  
  
Gaudapada yes, but Shankara, I dont see much connection, except the absence of his trademarks like adhyAsa, avidya, mAyA in Bhavya's pUrvapaksha.
