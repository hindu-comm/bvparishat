But there is nothing that we have in those 200 years to rely upon. So, Shankara is the closest to Bhavya. Gaudapada could be a closer contemporary of Bhavya. So the view of the Vakyapadiya and Gaudapada apart from Brahmasutra are called into the discussion by the author of this pdf. The pdf itself mentions Gaudapada and a verse of Bhavya is present in the GK with very minor variation. You have quoted Bhavya's supposed bhedAbheda criticism. This school is criticized in BSB 2.1.4.
Bhavya devotes several verses in the purvapaksha for the pot-space analogy and states the position of the analogy there as ekataa, samataa. He paraphrases the Mundakopanishad mantra first and uses the mantra-word saamyam later in the pot-space context. He also gives the analogy of the clay unity in the face of the clay-product diversity. All this in the purvapaksha is applicable for Advaita. Thus, whether one likes or not, without resorting to Shankara it would be impossible for anyone to connect with Bhavya.
