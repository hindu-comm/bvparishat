//In the purvapaksha shlokas that I have presented with translation, there is no mention of the bheda-abheda strand of Advaita.//  
  
As far as I understand, bhedAbheda is not a strand of advaita.  
  
  
//Even Shankara, in the BSB 2.1.14, has refuted the bheda-abheda doctrine as not supported by the Upanishads and logic.//  
  
  
If Shankara talked ("refuted" is probably condescending, but I am not surprised by the usage) of bhedAbheda, then bhedAbheda must have already existed by Shankara's time.  
  
  
//In the Purvapaksha the pot-space analogy has been stated clearly and I have also shown the Gaudapada verse that is on the topic.//  
  
  
I am aware of this. But are we sure that Gaudapada preceded Bhavya? Or that the pot-space analogy is Gaudapada's invention?  
  
  
//The bheda-abheda doctrine cannot use this analogy to their advantage for in their system bheda is absolutely real in samsara and abheda is also absolutely real in moksha, as delineated by Shankara in the BSB [2.1.14.//](http://2.1.14.//)  
  
  
If you ask me, I dont think even an advaitin can use the pot-space analogy to his or her advantage. I would never say that pot space = overall space or that pots are unreal. And I would actually try to investigate bhedAbheda by digging into its original sources, rather than purely relying on Shankara.  
  
  
//The pot-space analogy is advanced to show that even in vyavahara the difference between one jiva and another is not real as, in the analogy, it is just one space that appears limited and many by the pot-upadhi.//  
  
  
I would never say pot1 space = pot2 space, so I would doubt the usefulness of the analogy to the advaitin.  
  
All this is digressing from the main point. Bhavya himself treats the cases of difference and identity of individual and supreme selves. So I doubt if vedAntins of his time were unanimous on this issue.
