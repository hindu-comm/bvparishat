//You may have your own views but Shankara's statement in the above bhashya is the guiding factor for those who want to know the position that prevailed in those days.//  
  
  
I am not giving my own views, but merely quoting Bhavya, that too from a reference that you yourself have given. Bhavya preceded Shankara by about 200 years, so Shankara is irrelevant for this discussion.
