//Here the upanishad teaches that Brahman is the JagatkaaraNam, by the word kartA. So, it is not that Brahman is endowed with kartrutva/bhoktrutva. //  
  
  
If you look at the uttarapaksha of Bhavya, he criticizes the position that the Self is a kartr or bhoktr. If vedAntins at the time of bhavya were not really holding this position, then one wonders why bhavya would have criticized it.
