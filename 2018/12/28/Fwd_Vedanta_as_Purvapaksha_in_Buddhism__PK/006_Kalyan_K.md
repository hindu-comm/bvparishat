//If they have said that Vedanta has stolen from Buddhism, those on the Vedanta side too have not remained silent spectators to the charge://  
  
  
I think I have not made myself clear. Sometime back when we were having a similar discussion on this forum, Sri Venkataraghavanji (if I remember correctly) implied that on the issue of similarities between Buddhism and Vedanta, Bhavya took a favorable view of vedAnta. (Sri Venkataraghavanji was only echoing the position of some other scholars.) The present reference that you have given, puts Bhavya's words in context. Bhavya actually meant that vedAntins have stolen from Buddhism. Hope that clarifies things.
