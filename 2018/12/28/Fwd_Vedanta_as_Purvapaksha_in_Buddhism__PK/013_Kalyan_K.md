//While noting such a fundamental difference, how can one talk of "The indebtedness of BS, VP and GK to Mahayana philosophy" ?  

  
He expresses his awareness of this fundamental difference in the immediately following paragraph too :  
  
The doctrinal assimilation in Vedanta systematic philosophy therefore did not result in the eradication of the fundamental difference between  

Buddhism and Brahmanism which had existed from the time of the early scriptures of the respective traditions and of which these traditions had been well aware. (Highlighting mine) //  
  
  
Sri Paturiji, if we read slightly further, after your quotation, this "fundamental" difference is stated as the assertion and negation of Self/intrinsic nature. I wouldn't think this difference is so fundamental as to prevent one school from being influenced by the other.  
  
  
Having said that, it is news to me that there are some scholars who consider the BS to be influenced by Buddhism. I need to investigate this aspect.
