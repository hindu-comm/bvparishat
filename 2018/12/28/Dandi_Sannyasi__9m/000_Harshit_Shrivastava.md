What is the difference between a sannyasi and a dandi sannyasi? I am here talking about advaitins who are ekadandis. Some sannyasi abandon their danda at the time of sannyasa for they say that for a paramhamsa sannyasi, danda is not required, but it is seen that some sannyasis after some years of their sannyasa, again take danda sannyasa. So if they do so, it means that there must be a difference between the two sannyasis. What is it?

Again it is that only and only a brahmin person can become a dandi sannyasi! Is it true?
