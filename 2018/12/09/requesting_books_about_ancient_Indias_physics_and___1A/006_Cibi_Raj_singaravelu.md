Namasakram all,  
  
Thank you for your reply. Yes I am aware of the Book : Yantras or Mechanical Contrivances in ancient India. It contains a lot of wonderful information about machines. It deals mostly with Samaranganasutra Dhara which is like 11th Century work. It would have been great if there is a similar text before 1tth Century, like 6th Century or early.  
  
The History of Science and Technology is a god one, but like most other books somehow this also skips the mechanical and secular civil Engineering aspects of the classical period !  
  
Let me look at the other three, Dharam pal's, Brihat samhita and concise History. Thank you.  
  
Cibi
