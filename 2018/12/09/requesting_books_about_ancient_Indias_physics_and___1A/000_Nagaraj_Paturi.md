The following is a request from Sri Cibirajsingaravelu-ji who is now a member of BVP:

  

Namaskaram all,  
  
I am working on some painting works regarding ancient India. I had a hard time finding ancient India's secular architecture but I found few thesis and books.  
Now I am unable to find the materials regarding machine technology / pneumatics / hydrolics, etc of ancient India.  
  
Kautilya mentions a lot of war machines for which which fortunately there are Greek and roman counter parts. Traditionally they are called Yantras,  
That apart there were some other steam / water pressure powered machines, wheel lathes, looms, water wheels etc-  
There are Greek roman counterparts for that as well, But I just want to make it historically accurate.  
Here by Physics I am not meaning about Atomism but more about mechanics, description of forces and so on.  
If you could find some thesis, books about that please let me know.  
  
Thank you,  
Best regards,  
Cibi
