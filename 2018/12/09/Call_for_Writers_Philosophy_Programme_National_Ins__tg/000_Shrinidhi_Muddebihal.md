Hi,  

Barefoot Philosophers began as a collective within the academia committed to the idea that philosophy has a role to play in public life. Philosophy is essential for a wholesome understanding of the world around us. Unfortunately, public spaces that enable philosophical reflections are not that common, and many of those spaces are too exclusive. Our goal is to remedy this shortcoming by creating a platform where the philosophically inclined, regardless of background, can read about the many ways in which philosophical tools help us engage with each other and the world around us. Rather than refining rhetoric and polishing arguments, our goal will be to aid each of our visitors in their own journey to see the world in new ways, learn with compassion and express themselves with clarity.  

We invite you to contribute to the online repository of philosophical pieces curated by Barefoot Philosophers. Each piece should be about 2000 words on a topic that offers some philosophical insight into contemporary themes, and reflections of life in the 21^(st)century. Feel free to mix it up. The writing should be engaging, the ideas creative, and the language accessible. The top five pieces will be awarded a cash prize of Rs.2500/- and the next five a cash prize of Rs.1000/-, and all ten pieces will be featured on the Barefoot Philosophersâ€™ online resource. Selected authors will receive an open invitation to be a contributor to Barefoot Philosophers (Authors will receive an honorarium for each article). We are looking for a clearly articulated idea that will interest readers from any background.  

Deadline for your submissions will be the 15^(th)of January 2019. Submissions are to be made to[ad...@barefootphilosophers.org](). Get your thinking caps on and get writing.  

  

All the Best!  

  

Thanking you,  

Sundar Sarukkai
