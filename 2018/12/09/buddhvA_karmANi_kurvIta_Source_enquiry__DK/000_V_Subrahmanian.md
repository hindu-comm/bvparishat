Namaste

  

In the Taittiriya Upanishad Bhashya, Shankaracharya has said:‘बुद्ध्वाकर्माणिकुर्वीत’ इति स्मृतेश्च \| Swami Gambhirananda in his translation gives a reference to this quote as Apastamba smriti II.xxi.5.

  

Could anyone kindly help me view/download the above smriti, preferably with a commentary?

  

In case that quote is found in any other source, the reference thereof may be cited.

  

Thanks
