I have consulted the site of Rekhta.org quite a few times and found the resources very useful, even though there seems to be the occasional deviation in their orthography. A wonderful effort indeed, on the whole.

  

I used to wonder at their revenue model. Do you have any idea of how they support their staff of 92? I ask because if it is a self-sustainable model, other languages could benefit from it.
