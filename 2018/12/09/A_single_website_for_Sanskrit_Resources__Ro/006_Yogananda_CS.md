Namaste,

  

Thanks a lot Hardik Joshi ji for mentioning about our website for Sanskrit resources. In brief, the project is to make available one million pages of carefully selected Samskrita literature in various subjects, to be part of a curated & well annotated Digital Resource. The books available at

<http://www.adhyatmaprakasha.org/php/sanskrit_books.php>  

will give an example of the way the books can be presented. (For example, compare the book *Vedanta Prakriya Pratyabhijha* available here

with the one at <https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.486083>)  

Wherever necessary, books will have a one page summary so as to give an idea of the contents of the book.

  

This is going to be a subscription based, self-sustainable resource and we are looking for funds to create it. Those who are interested in investing / offering patronage / suggestions, are requested to write to me ([sriran...@gmail.com]()) off the list for more details.

  

regards................yoga
