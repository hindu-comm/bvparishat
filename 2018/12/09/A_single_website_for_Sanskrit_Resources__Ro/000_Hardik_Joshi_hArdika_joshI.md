Respected Scholars,

  

Greetings !

  

Recently I met one of the founders of the Urdu website [rekhta.org](http://rekhta.org) It is a unique website that has lot of resources for Urdu language. The website has collection of various poems/ghazals, ebooks, learning resources, etc. and is a funded by a single person. They have a team of nearly 92 people working behind collection of resources. They also have another website<https://aamozish.com> to teach Urdu.

  

I was wondering whether we have such a unique portal for Sanskrit language.

  

Best Regards,
