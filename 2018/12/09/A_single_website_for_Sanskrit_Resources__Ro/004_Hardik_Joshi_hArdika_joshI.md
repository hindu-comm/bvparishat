Dear Senaniji,

  

Mr Sanjiv Saraf is funding the website [rekhta.org](http://rekhta.org). He is an entrepreneur and major funds are from his side. The person whom I met said that it is difficult to get funds from other sources though being a Non-profit organisation.

  

They have scanning facilities in different cities and have developed methods to detect duplication in scanning. Similarly, they have reduced duplication in most of the other efforts. They are ready to share their experiences with others who wants to develop similar website. It is a mature project. Sufinama is their upcoming project.

  

I am glad to say that I had a conversation with Shri Yoganandaji (who is a member of this group) and they have plans to roll out a website for Sanskrit resources. He will be announcing soon. We need nearly infinite storage place for archived books !!! Sanskrit website will be developed with a huge cost and there needs to be adequate funding.

  

I am very much eager for the announcements to be made by Shri Yoganandaji. Maybe, a small effort in this direction can span into a huge project in future. This may take years to fulfill the entire project.

  

Thanks
