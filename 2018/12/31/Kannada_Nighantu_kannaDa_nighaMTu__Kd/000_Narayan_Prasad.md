Dear Scholars,

  Namaste.

 All the 8 volumes ofKannada Nighantu(ಕನ್ನಡ ನಿಘಂಟು), published by Kannada Sahitya Parishat are available online for free download, for example, the link for Vol.3:


[http://english.bharatavani.in/book/ಕನ್ನಡ-ಸಾಹಿತ್ಯ-ಪರಿಷತ್ತಿನ-3/](http://english.bharatavani.in/book/%E0%B2%95%E0%B2%A8%E0%B3%8D%E0%B2%A8%E0%B2%A1-%E0%B2%B8%E0%B2%BE%E0%B2%B9%E0%B2%BF%E0%B2%A4%E0%B3%8D%E0%B2%AF-%E0%B2%AA%E0%B2%B0%E0%B2%BF%E0%B2%B7%E0%B2%A4%E0%B3%8D%E0%B2%A4%E0%B2%BF%E0%B2%A8-3/)

  

But many pages are either missing or badly scanned. I have got a hard copy of only Vols.2, 3, 6, 7 and 8. Since long I was trying to get the other volumes, but could not get a copy.

  

The missing pages of the online volumes, whose hard copy I have with me, I have already scanned.

  

The following missing pages I do not have. If anybody has got a hard copy, I would request him to kindly scan these pages.

  

I require the following pages:

Missing pages:

    Vol.1 - p. 600

    Vol.4 - p. 3874

Pages requiring rescanning:

    Vol.5 - pp.4947, 4950, 4971, 4974, 5268

  

    p.4947 left half & p.4950 right half too faint

    p.4971 left half very faint

    p.4974 preferably to be rescanned

    p.5268 has been scanned with completely different resolution compared with others.       Preferably to be rescanned.

  

Wishing a happy and prosperous new year to you all,

Regards

Narayan Prasad
