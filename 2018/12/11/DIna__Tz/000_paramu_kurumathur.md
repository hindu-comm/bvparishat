Apte says that the word डीन (p.p of डी) indicates the flight of a bird. He says that there are 101 varieties of bird flights. The word prefixed to डीन give the nature of the flight. He gives examples like अवडीनम्, उड्डीनम᳭ etc. (since it is 101, there are more obviously more prefixes than the upsargas)  

  

What are the 101 types of flight? Which work gives these?

  

Are there other words like डीन where if you prefix certain words gives you get different kinds of the same action (over and above what we get with the normal upasarga prefixes?)

  

Regards
