Dear scholars,

  Namaste.

  This has reference to the श्लोक 2.12 of सूर्यसिद्धान्त, in which 8 kinds of motion of a planet are mentioned. The most confusing are the terms वक्रा गति and कुटिला गति. Many people consider both terms to mean the same thing. But in my view both are technically different. I wrote an article regarding this, which was published in the Astrological Magazine, March 1988 issue (attached for ready reference).

  I would like to know whether there has been any further research on this topic.

  Regards

  Narayan Prasad
