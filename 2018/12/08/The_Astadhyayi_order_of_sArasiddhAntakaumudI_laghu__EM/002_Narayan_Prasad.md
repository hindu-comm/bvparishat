Namaste.

  

I have prepared an excel file of comparison of MSK sutra nos. for four editions, editors being - (1) Sureshchandra Sharma (2) Sadashiv Shastry and Ramchandra Jha (3) Arkanath Chaudhary (4) Vishvanath Shastry.

  

The full list of 2329 sutras is from the MSK edited by Dr Sureshchandra Sharma (1989-90; reprinted 2014).

  

It appears that the MSK edited by Dr Sureshchandra Sharma (1989-90; reprinted 2014) has followed the edition of Pt Sadashiv Shastry and Pt Ramchandra Jha (1951). Provisionally I have kept the same nos. for the latter, since there are no serial nos. assigned in this edition.

  

The actual no. of the Astadhyayi sutras used in the MSK is 2314. The remaining 15 numbers are due to duplication.

  

The following Panini sutras have been assigned more than one serial number:

  

 (1) P.1.3.006 - 504, 2240

 (2) P.1.4.054 - 811, 1345

 (3) P.3.1.079 - 656, 786

 (4) P.3.3.100 - 1279, 1280(योगविभाग)

 (5) P.6.1.096 - 463, 540, 562

 (6) P.6.3.009 - 1533, 1643

 (7) P.6.3.014 - 1159, 1647

 (8) P.6.3.090 - 1672, 2030

 (9) P.7.4.027 - 866, 1783

\(10\) P.8.2.040 - 568, 623

\(11\) P.8.2.041 - 554, 570

\(12\) P.8.3.013 - 129, 624

\(13\) P.8.3.034 - 104, 116

\(14\) P.8.4.022 - 308, 309 (योगविभाग)

  

Best wishes
