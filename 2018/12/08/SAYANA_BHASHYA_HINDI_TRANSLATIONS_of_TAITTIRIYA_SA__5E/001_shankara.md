Namaste,

  

SLBRSV (Sri Lal Bahadur Shastri Rashtriya Sanskrit Vivyapeeth) has published Taittiriyasamhita Sayanabhashya with Hindi translation by Parameshwaranand Shastri.

Its volume 2 is available online at Bharatvani website - [bharatavani.in](http://bharatavani.in). I can't locate it there, I will post the link if I can trace it later.  

  

regards  
shankara
