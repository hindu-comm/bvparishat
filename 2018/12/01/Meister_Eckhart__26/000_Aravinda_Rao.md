Dear scholars,

Those of you who are into the study of Advaita Vedanta may find this interesting if you are not already aware of it.

You may please watch the video in the link below. It is about a Christian mystic Eckhart of the 14th century whose teaching is quite close to Advaita Vedanta. The christian thinkers seem to be resurrecting their mystic tradition which was once condemned by the church. Eckhart was himself about to be punished but he is said to have died meanwhile.

I wonder whether any scholar has done some research on Eckhart to show the parallels.

Regards,
