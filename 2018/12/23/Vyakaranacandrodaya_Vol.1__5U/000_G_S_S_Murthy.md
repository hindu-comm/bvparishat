Respected scholars,

In volume 1 of vyaakaraNacandrodaya of Sri. caarudattaSaastri, kaaraka prakaraNa, page 7, line 12 the following appears:

varayaami=Ipsaami=yaacaami.I do not understand the usage: Ipsaami and yaacaami.

I request guidance from scholars, who might have downloaded the book's soft version, made available recently on this forum.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
