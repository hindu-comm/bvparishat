The last time I met Prof. S.D.Joshi, he told me that he had no intention of translating more parts of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. The reason was that he believed that his views on the remaining parts could be figured out from what he had already published — that he had given expression to everything he considered new/original or important. His view behind discontinuing the Mahābhāṣya translation was the same.
