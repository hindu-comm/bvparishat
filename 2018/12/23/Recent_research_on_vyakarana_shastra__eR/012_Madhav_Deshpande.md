Dear Narayan Prasad Ji,

  

Thank you for providing this link. I have some of these volumes in print, but not the whole set. I wish Professor Joshi had lived to complete the translation, but as Ashok Aklujkar says, he had stopped working on it at somepoint. The last time I visited him in Pune, he was in no health to do any academic work.
