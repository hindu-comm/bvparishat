There was a period when Kaumudi's popularity was on the peak and the कौमुदी-अध्ययन-पद्धति superseded everything else. This must have lead to the kaarika - कौमुदी यदि कण्ठस्था वृथा भाष्ये परिश्रमः। कौमुदी यद्यकण्ठस्था वृथा भाष्ये परिश्रमः॥

  

Incidentally, a similar karika is known for Padamanjari as well -अधीते हि महाभाष्ये व्यर्था सा पदमञ्जरी । It does not mean Padamanjari is useless, it means that Padamanjari echos everything from bhashyam.  

  

Such kaarikas are to be seen more like "praising the corresponding book / author" rather than telling a universal truth.
