\<\<I would invite scholars to examine his views in a scholarly way, and agree or disagree with his views, but not brush them aside with casual comments.>\>

  

In his Introduction to व्याकरण-महाभाष्य : समर्थाह्निक (पा॰2.1.1), Prof. Joshi has listed the purpose of the extensive commentary on Panini (see the attached figure). Of special interest will be to see the purpose no. (i) and (ii):

\(i\) to defendपाणिनि where alterations and additions proposed by कात्यायन appear to be unreasonable.

\(ii\) to examine independently the rules and views of पाणिनि which are left unnoticed by कात्यायन.

Narayan Prasad
