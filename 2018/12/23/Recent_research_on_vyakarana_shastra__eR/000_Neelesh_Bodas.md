Greetings to all scholars.

  

I am looking for some pointers (= groups / journals / individual contacts / papers etc) on the research associated with "शास्त्र" aspects of Paninian grammar.

  

I am curious about what scientific research goes on these days based on ashtadhyayi, kaumudi, bhasyam, paribhashasa, vartikas etc.  

  

Just to be clear, I am not looking for any work that can be classified under "sanskrit computing / linguistic analysis using computers / automatic generation" etc. I am also not looking for any work that is pure explanatory in nature. (E.g. translations or elaborations).

  

  

Any help would be appreciated.

  

Regards

Neelesh
