Introduction on Amazon sale page is as follows:

  

The present volume is a continuation of the bibliography and study presented in Panini, A Survey of Research, first published in the Netherlands (The Hague: Mouton and Co. 1976), subsequently published in India (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1980) and reprinted in 1997. The basic format adopted for the first survey is observed here: a bibliography of major work done since 1975, including materials which came to the author's knowledge up to December of 1997, is followed by his appraisal of this work with extensive references to primary sources which are the bases of scholarly discussions and notes.
