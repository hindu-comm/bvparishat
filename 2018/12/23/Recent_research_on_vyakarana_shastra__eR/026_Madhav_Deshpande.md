Other than Mahamahopadhyaya Vasudeva Shastri Abhyankar who produced the only complete \[Marathi\] translation of the entire Mahābhāṣya, Professor S.D. Joshi was the other recent scholar who had studied the Mahābhāṣya most closely and had produced nearly a dozen volumes of exquisite translation and commentary on Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya.
However, as an independent mind, he often disagreed with the conclusions of Patañjali, and his translations of the Mahābhāṣya and the translation of the Aṣṭādhyāyī occasionally express these disagreements with Patañjali. His disagreements with Patañjali are not based on his disregard for Patañjali, but on his intense study of Patañjali. If Patañjali disagrees with Katyāyana and rejects numerous rules of Pāṇini, that freedom to think got limited in later grammarians under the rule: uttarottaram munīnām prāmāṇyam. Even the great Bhartr̥hari occasionally disagrees with Patañjali and says: इदं न्यायविदो भाष्यकारस्याप्ययुक्तमिव लक्ष्यते । I have not seen a review of Professor Joshi's views, but he was certainly not alone in disagreeing with Patañjali. One is free to disagree with Professor Joshi's views, or anyone else's views. All I would say is that it is inappropriate to assume that Professor Joshi was ignorant of the Mahābhāṣya. I studied the Mahābhāṣya with Professor Joshi, as did Ashok Aklujkar, Saroja Bhate, Malhar Kulkarni \[?\] and many others. While there were only two hours a week in the schedule of the University of Pune, Professor Joshi made us come to his home every single day for a reading. I would invite scholars to examine his views in a scholarly way, and agree or disagree with his views, but not brush them aside with casual comments. Scholarship contained in his 25 volumes on Pāṇini and Patañjali deserves more than casual comments.
With best regards,
