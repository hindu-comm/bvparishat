Dear colleagues

I would like to clarify my personal view on

Dr S.D.Joshi's statement that Patanjali didn't follow Panini is in no case acceptable.After Panini countless scholars came,studied and churned the Shastra all their lives.None of them felt in such a way.This very Grammar is called त्रिमुनि व्याकरणम्।

It is possible that they differ with each other

In views on certain points but Mr Joshi's statement surprised me.Strange.
