\<\<I have some of these volumes in print, but not the whole set.>\>

  

BTW, I have only volume ix. I had to purchase it in 2002 for my article "Asiddhavadatrābhāt: its Treatment in the post-Pāṇinian Systems of
Sanskrit Grammar", because the BORI library did not have it then and I had to present this article at the 41st session of AIOC, held at Puri in Dec. 2002. By chance, Prof. Joshi was also present during this session. He was also requested by the Section President to present his views on P.6.4.22.

  

This article was published in: "Journal of the Oriental Institute, Baroda, Vol. 50, Nos.1-4, Sep.-June 2000-2001 Issue, pp.43-54."

But I do not have its hard copy. If anybody has access to this issue of JOIB, I would request him to give me a scanned copy.

Thanks and regards

Narayan Prasad
