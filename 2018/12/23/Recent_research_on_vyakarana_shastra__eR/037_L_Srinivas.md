Thank you very much, sir.

  

Frequently one reads something and one's set on a train of thought. One's always cognizant of Prof Joshi's glorious lineage going all the way back to Nāgeśa himself. How can one forget that even now, given Prof Deshpande mentioned both Mm VS Abhyankar and Prof Joshi in the same post?

  

One also remembers that Prof Joshi himself refers to his collaborator, Mr Jouthe Roodbergen, as his student friend, Prof Dandekar as his teacher and Prof DHH Ingalls as his *guru. (*Acknowledgments to*Vyākaraṇa-Mahābhāṣya, Samarthāhnika,* CASS, Pune*).*

Even the dullest mind may discern twin *parampara*'s here. It's in this context that my original query was posed.

  

Bests,

  
Srini
