As far as I know, the multi-volume translation of the Aṣṭādhyāyī by S.D. Joshi and Roodbergen, published by the Sahitya Akademi, was his last published work. It was not completed, and now both scholars are no more. The last time I saw Professor Joshi alive, he gave me a few volumes of this translation. Among the Āhnikas of the Mahābhāṣya they translated, the Paspaśā volume was probably the last one. Professor Saroja Bhate may have more up to date information regarding his publications. Shankara Ji may be able to check if any of these are available on line. With best regards,
