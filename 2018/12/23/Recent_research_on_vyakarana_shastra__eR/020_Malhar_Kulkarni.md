Dear All,

  

I quote below from the preface of the first volume of the translation of the *Aṣṭādhyāyī*by S.D.Joshi and J. A. F. Roodbergen:

  

"When we started the *Mahābhāṣya*- project in 1967...our idea was that we would be able to understand Pāṇini better through studying Patañjali. But we have come to the conclusion that, apart from introducing a great deal of extraneous matter, especially from Mīmāṁsā sources, in the interpretation of the Pāṇini-sutras, Patañjaliis often at a loss, how to construe Pāṇini's intention. Therefore Patañjali's opinions can never replace our independent judgement regarding the interpretation of
Pāṇini, especially in the matter of *anuvṛtti* and *nivṛtti*, and of conflict- resolving procedures. Patañjalican only act as a guide to be critically followed, not as a final authority regarding the interpretation of the *Aṣṭādhyāyī*. We have also come to the conclusion that to some extent, the *Kāśikāvṛtti* has preserved an authentic
Pāṇinian tradition, independent of and different from the one followed by and established by Patanjali and his grammatical sources.

  

These and similar considerations have led us to terminate our*Mahābhāṣya*project."

  

  

I hope this quote helps this discussion.

  

with salutations to all,
