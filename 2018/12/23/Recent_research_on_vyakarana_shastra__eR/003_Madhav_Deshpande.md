Dear Nagaraj Ji,

  

  While my Guru's 1976 book is excellent, it is 44 years old, and hence does not cover anything written since that date. A more recent book of Cardona is "Recent Research in Pāṇinian Studies," published by Motilal Banarsidass in 1999. That book too is now almost 20 years old, and a lot has been published since then. Cardona's books may be a good beginning to become familiar with the various lines of research regarding Pāṇinian grammar. One can then look for the more recent work by scholars like S.D. Joshi, J. A. F. Roodbergen, Paul Kiparsky, Jan Houben, Johannes Bronkhorst, Peter Scharf, Madhav Deshpande, Malhar Kulkarni, Amba Kulkarni, and Saroja Bhate to namea few. Cardona's books are not mere bibliographies. They contain a critique of the work of other scholars from his point of view.
