Yes, of course. One fully appreciates that Prof Joshi was among the
greatest modern scholars of Sanskrit grammar. But if he found 'it acceptable, or rather necessary, to disagree with the conclusions reached by Patañjali', did others find it necessary to critique his views? After all, that's both the modern and the traditional method, isn't it?
