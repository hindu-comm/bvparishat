It would be even more correct to hold that even the 'original' such as the Valmiki Ramayana or the Mahabharatha, is also a product of that author's imagination. We attach a special sanctity to these works/authors and relative to that we judge the 'other' authors and end up thinking that these latter have deviated from the original.
