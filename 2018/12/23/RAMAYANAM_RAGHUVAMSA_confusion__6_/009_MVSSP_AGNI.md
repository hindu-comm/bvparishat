By your words i am understanding that don't compare epics with the kavyas? If Kalidasa told a lie instead of the truth gow can it's considered as kavya?? In the world of "KALPANA" the kavi may have option of his own but in reality how can he change like that and such change is accepted?Is a questionable one! How can we say " kunti putraha vinayakaha " as a kalpana. It's a wrong . Kalidas is a great scholar and I am confirm that he and his contemporary poets and sanskrit scholars definitely studied the valmiki's ramayana. Then how they accepted this wrong? Is there in any other puranic ramayan narration raghu is described as son of dilip? I just want to know that. The great scholar and a person of obedience Kalidasa making such change from ramayana makes his " MANDAHA KAVI YASAH PRARTHI " slokam as a true statement instead of his respectfulness. Definitely Kalidasa will not commit such mistake but it's there means there will be some proof at somewhere
what's that ? I want to know. And creating the raghuvamsa kings as a great followers of varnashram and deviating the clan from the moola ramayana??? Is really confusing. Some changes such as you stated RAJA Duryodhan! creating bheem as a wrong one are well known to the world as kavi kalpana but in case of raghuvamsa it's well known that raghu is the son of dilip. Is the entire world feeling a lie as a true one ? Is a question able fact too.
