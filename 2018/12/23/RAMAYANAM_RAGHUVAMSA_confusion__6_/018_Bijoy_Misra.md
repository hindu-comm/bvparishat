Thank you.  

Gradually I see that people are using this forum as a chat room than in engaging in scholarly discussion.

Then I noticed this late process of hiding names. You may not be alone.

While we are searching to "discover" Indian scholarship from a distance the question does come

when did the casualness enter into Indian mode of thinking. Yesterday we did Gita Jayanti,

not a single word in the book can be pointed to be misused. It would suggest the centuries of distillation

that could have gone to produce the text. We know little about the genius scholar who compiled the final

text.  

The task for the new India would be to help develop firm scholars who are rooted in their thinking.

It might need more training and extra discipline. India is free now and there are opportunities if

one avails them. We have to throw away various legends and find out the roots of Indian scholarship

in creativity and in the fundamental science of life. Since you seem to be curious and possibly young,  

I appeal to you dedicate yourself find out more about Valmiki or about Kalidasa. It would be a much needed

contribution to the future India. Please discard all myths and extrapolations. Travel and do onsite research.

One day a week should be enough, but continue for five or ten years.
