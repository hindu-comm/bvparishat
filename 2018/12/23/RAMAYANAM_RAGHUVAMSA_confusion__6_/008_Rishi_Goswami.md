Agniji, There are many such instances I have found in Literature, where poets have taken Poetic Liberty of changing the scriptures.

Take for eg, Bhaas' DootavAkyam, where Krishna goes as ambassador of peace and meets Duryodhana, the King. Yes, he changed the Kong to Duryodhana, but it should have been Dhritarashtra.

In his play Urubhangam, Duryodhana seems to be the Hero, he changes completely while dying, Baladevaji's reaction to Bheema hitting on his JanghA, makes the reader feel pity for Duryodhana, he advices his son to respect Pandavas as elders,he is guilty for what all he did and also he refuses Ashvatthama to kill anyone or take revenge. What a sudden change! It seems as if Bheema was the villain to hit such a saint.

Much of the poetic liberty has been taken in Tulasidas' epic Manas also, many of the accounts can be well found in various Puranas but a few we can't and have to accept it as something original to the poet's imagination or perhaps it maybe what he saw himself by grace of Hanumanji.

So, what I'm trying to say is literature should be viewed as different from History. Literature today maybe a matter of deep study for we don't know the language, but may have been a matter of Vinoda/entertainment for the schollars. Fool's entertainment would be playing around in bars and schollars would read some literature to ease the mind, as we read Hindi/English novels today.

Most of the people in society would be very well aware of the 2 major epics and most of the Puranas and Samhitas, hence it would not shock the readers when they read such literature.

When we read other accounts, with prominent Hindi/other commentaries, the commentor mentions all the places where there has been distinction from Itihasa. You should buy Bhaasa Nataka Sangraha from Chowkhambha, where I find Bhaas' language easier than Kalidasa and plays much interesting and shorter.
