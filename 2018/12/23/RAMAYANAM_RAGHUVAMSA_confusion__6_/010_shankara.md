Namaste,

  

Puranas are not unanimous while describing the lineage of Raghu. Please refer to Puranic encyclopedia entries on Dilipa and Ikshvaku, as per which Padma Purana and Devi Bhagavata consider Raghu as son of Dilipa. So, it is evident that Raghu being Dilipa's son is not merely a product of Kalidasa's imagination.  

  

Also refer to Wikipedia entry on lineage of Raghu given below (quoted from 'Ancient Indian Dynasties' by VS Mishra published by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan).

  

A number of Puranas, which include the Vishnu Purana, the Vayu Purana, the Linga Purana, mention Dirghabahu as the son of Dilīpa and Raghu as the son of Dirghabahu. But the Harivamsha, the Brahma Purana and the Shiva Purana mention Raghu as son of Dilīpa and Dirghavahu as his epithet.

shankara
