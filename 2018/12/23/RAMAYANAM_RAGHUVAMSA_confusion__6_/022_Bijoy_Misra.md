Dear friend,

You have to define a goal and suspend all distractions. At young age we concentrate

easily, it gets difficult as age advances. We start blaming others.  

But in any case suspend these random postings and put efforts in answering your own

questions. Formulate a line of thinking thorough complete restraint and then a path

would reveal itself. All knowledge is within, but we have to explore.  

Restraint will come through yoga. Join a yoga school or study Patanjali a line

a day or a week (give four hours per line). Don't skip, immerse yourself. Assumption  

of self-knowledge is our biggest hindrance. We should not exhibit, but look inward.  

Please quiet down and try. You can write privately after six months.

Happy New Year.

BM
