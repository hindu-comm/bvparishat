Respected scholars ,

 I am getting a big confusion between ramayana and raghuvamsa mahakavya of kalidasa. In raghuvamsa mahakavya 3 sarga 21 sloka it has been told that the king DILIPA named his son as RAGHU. while in RAMAYANA BALAKANDA 70 SARGA it has been told that DILIPA IS THE FATHER OF BHAGIRATHA, BHAGIRATHA IS THE FATHER OF KAKUSTHA AND THE RAGHU IS THE SON OF KAKUSTHA. It means DILIPA-BHAGIRATHA-KAKUSTHA-RAGHU is the clan according to ramayana. Kalidasa is a great scholar and i am sure that he definitely studied ramayana then why this type of change was done by Kalidasa. As i am a person who don't have much knowledge in sanskrit asking the scholars of this group to please by grace on me and clear my doubt.

 Thanking you
