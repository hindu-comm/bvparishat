Dear Sri Sivaprasad,

Thank you for using your full name. it is a good beginning to scholarship.  

The best for you is to find a local teacher and study with him or her  

intensely to understand the fundamentals. My recommendation was  

to get organized such that the mind remains focused on a topic.

Research is a slow process, give it time but stay focused.

Since you talk about Ramayana I suggested to locate Valmiki at

various places and check if we can track Valmiki the man. Kalidasa was

an alternative. These were simply suggestions. You may have  

other strong interest, but study hard than just throwing random questions.

Hope i clarified.  

Best wishes,

BM
