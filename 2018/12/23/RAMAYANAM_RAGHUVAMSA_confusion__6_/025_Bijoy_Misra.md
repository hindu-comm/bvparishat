Dear Prof. Kannan,

  

All dignity is due to the student who listens.  

Out of thirty who admire a class, one or two  

keep in touch after ten years. Hardly any one  

recalls in old age. But some students do  

continue and deliver in their own way. Those

are the ones who had listened!

  

Happy New Year.
