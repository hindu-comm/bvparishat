Respected scholars ,

 In [archive.org](http://archive.org) i saw BHAGAVATAM WITH MANY COMMENTARIES published by Sri Srimad Krishna Shankar Shastri Ji, Ahmedabad in 1965.

Is any seller at now selling the PAPERBACK EDITION of those volumes. If yes please tell the details of the seller.

If no seller is selling that series of volumes then i request the scholars who are having that series and nobody studies them at present near you can you please forward them to me .

Actually in my previous post i rejected RADHA KRISHNAN sir’s offer to sponser me the vol.2 of the CHI by saying that i become a “RUNI” to to him which may lead to next birth.

That also applied in this case too but being its unavailable outside i requested the person who has the possession of books which are not studied by his students at now to forward me so that i can study them.

I feel that it may consume so much time to read those volumes and understand them. The 10 th skandha only having nearly 7000 pages with vyakhyana. Being i am 28years in age at now i confirmly can say that i will finish them in my life time.

In my school days i have a practice of getting books for class 6 from the senior who finished it and study those books for class 6 and later i forward them to my juniors .

Like that i am asking in this case too. If the scholars feel any thing wrong in my words i apologise for that.

 Thanking you
