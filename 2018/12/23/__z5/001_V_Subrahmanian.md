I have not seen any direct statement to the above effect in any Purana/text.

In the Harivamśa, Veda Vyāsa records the event when Hari meditated upon the Jagatpati Śiva in Kailasa and worshiped Him and obtained the ‘Chakra’ (discus):  

  

यत्र लेभे हरिश्चक्रमुपास्य बहुभिर्दिनैः ।

पुष्करैः शतपत्रैश्च नेत्रेण च जगत्पतिम् ॥ 3.84.11 ॥

  

Where (Kailāsa) Hari obtained the ‘Chakram’ by meditating and worshiping for several days the Lord of the Universe, Śiva, by lotus of a special variety and by his eye.Pleased by his devotion Śiva granted Viṣṇu the Sudarshana Chakram.

  

Sridhara Swamin, in his commentary to the Viṣṇu purāṇam refers to the above event succinctly to substantiate the fact that Viṣṇu is called ‘lotus-eyed’:

  

// ……..śivārādhanārthaṁ puṇḍarīkīkṛtam akṣi yeneti vā—puṇḍarīkam paraṁ dhāma akṣam avyayam ucyate ity-ādi ślokokta-vyutpattyā puṇḍarīkīkṣeti sambodhanam iti vā \| //
