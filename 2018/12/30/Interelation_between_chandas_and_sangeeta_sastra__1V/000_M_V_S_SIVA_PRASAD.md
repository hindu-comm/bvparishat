Respected scholars,

 Is there exists any relation between the chandas sastra and the sangeeta sastra. If its specified somewhere please inform me the source . Is there exists any a the specified chandas will be suitable for a specified raga and vice versa. This doubt arised due to the GEETA GOVINDA KAVYAM of Jyadeva kavi. I have a book and in that the musical notations are also there. Hence i asked . Is chandas and sangeeta sastra are interrelated or not?

 Thanking you
