*Mr.Joshi,*

*Sanskrit literature is widely available in English through translation but not in many vernacular languages. Since Devanāgarī Lipi Parishad prefers Nāgarī script for all Indian languages,Vernacular languages need to follow Hindi translations of Sanskrit to protect languages and scripts. PM's Man Kī Bāt can be read in any language! Sanskrit Subhaashits can be composed in rhyming poetic form in vernacular languages.*

*Here is Bhagavad Gita's translation in Gujarati-poetic form. One may read through script converter.*
