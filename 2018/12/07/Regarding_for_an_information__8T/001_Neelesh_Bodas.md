Namaste,

  

Please use a more concrete subject line so that the thread can be easily found later on as well.

  

Nevertheless, the copy of Bhoja's Saraswatee Kanthaabharanam (Grammar text) can be obtained from [here](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.52186/page/n3). Mr. Narayan Prasad was kind enough to point me to this link a few weeks ago, which I am sharing here.
