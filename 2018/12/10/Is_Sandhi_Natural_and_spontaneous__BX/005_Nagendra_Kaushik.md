Dear Nagarj Sir,  
Hari Om n Pranams.  
  
I have a small doubt regarding the terminology which you used though I was able to appreciate your explanation regarding Sandhi being natural to speakers of the particular language.  
  
You have called Sandhi as a 'Morpho Phonemic change' whereas should it not be called as 'Morpho phonetic change'?  
  
The four sub-fields of language studies being  
-Phontics (ಧ್ವನಿ ವಿಜ್ಞಾನ)  
-Phonemics (ಧ್ವನಿಮಾ ವಿಜ್ಞಾನ)  
-Morphology (ಆಕ್ಋತಿಮಾ ವಿಜ್ಞಾನ)  
-Syntax (ವಾಕ್ಯ ವಿಜ್ಞಾನ)  
  
With this Sandhi would fall into first bucket since it is a change that does not give any new meanings.  
  
Classification of sounds which change meaning falls into phonemics. Eg ಹಲ್ಲಿ - lizard, ಹಳ್ಳಿ - village. Hence /ಲ/ and /ಳ/ are phonemes in kannada but not in Samskruta since ಲ-ಳ distincion is not there in Samskruta.  
  
Change of words meanings by adding pratyayas is a morphological change.  
  
Study of Karakas, kartari n karmani prayoga, etc would be syntax.  
  
In above light is not Sandhi to be called Phonetic change instead of phonemic change?  
  
Warm regards,  
Kaushik
