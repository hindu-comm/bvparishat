Dear Sri Nagendra Kaushik,

  

It is good that you are thinking about these things.

  

Incidentally the technical term "morphophonemic' (adj.) and the term morphophonemics have been in vogue and in greater currency than the term " morphophonetic" or "morphophonetics". Umbrella term for all such aspects is morphophonology and as you can see below, it is "morphophonemics " that is used as synonymous to "morphophonology".

-----------------------------------------

  

Please note that in the expression " morphophonemic change", the word-component phoneme does not signify a meaningful /meaning-significant /meaning related change. It refers to a change ***in*** the meaningful /meaning-significant /meaning related part of the morpheme. That is the focus is not on whether the change affects meaning or not, focus is on where the change occurs; that the change occurs ***in*** the phoneme. One should not separate phonemic from the word and combine it with change and say it is "phon**emic** change"
.different from "phon**etic** change ".  

  

To use Indian/Indic/Sanskritic terminology of explaining compounds, we can say, the samaasa " morphophonemic change" is not vis'EshaNa poorvapada karmadhaaraya but it is saptameetatpurusha.
