What is going on here?

  

Sandhi is a morpho-phonemic change of Sanskrit. Any such changes like morpho-phonemic change in a certain language need not appear natural to speakers out of whose natural speaking that language is not formed or not originated.

  

Morpho-phonemic changes like Sandhi occur in different ways in different languages. Those ways of Sandhi of that language are natural to that language. Those ways of Sandhi are formed out of the speech of the speakers of the language out of whose speaking that language is formed.

  

vēl̥a+ayyindi = vēl̥ayyindi may sound natural to a Telugu speaker. Why sound, even an 'uneducated' rural speaker of Telugu speaker says/speaks it that way.

  

rāma+ ayya = rāmayya is done similarly by a natural Telugu speaker naturally.

  

rāma+ anuja = rāmānuja is natural for a Sanskrit speaker.

  

In fact, rāmayya of the common Telugu speaker is found to have formed out of rāma+ ayya by the grammarian of the Telugu language.

  

Similarly, rāmānujaof the common Sanskrit speaker is found to have formed out of rāma+ anujaby the grammarian of the Sanskrit language.

  

In other words, Sandhi-resultant expressions are found in the natural speech of the speaker of the language. Sandhi-split and identification of a generalisation , 'a rule' in those splits is done by the grammarian.

  

So nirjana, nīrava, nissvārtha niṣkalā etc. are first said/spoken by the natural speakers of the Sanskrit language and then the grammarian splits them into

  

nis/nih + jana, nis/nih+ rava, nis/nih+ svārtha, nis/nih+ kalā etc.

  

So talk about whether nis/nih + jana, nis/nih+ rava, nis/nih+ svārtha, nis/nih+ kalā etc. can naturally form into nirjana, nīrava, nissvārtha niṣkalā etc or not, is upside down way of looking at things.

  

If at all there is no scope for debate , it is with regard to splitting of the natural expressions nirjana, nīrava, nissvārtha niṣkalā etc into nis/nih + jana, nis/nih+ rava, nis/nih+ svārtha, nis/nih+ kalā
[etc.is](http://etc.is) correct or not.
