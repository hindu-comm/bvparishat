Nagaraj's reply makes sense. Sandhi is a natural phenomenon and is particular to the language. It should also be noted, some of the Sandhis that look unnatural now, may have gone through a series of steps (over time) to get where it is now. For example, the ending "as" before voiced sounds becomes "o" (like raamo gachchati), may have passed through af, av, au to get o? (I read this somewhere, but I forget where. Maybe WH Ferrar)
