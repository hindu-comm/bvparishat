With regards, I mention that there is no such entry in the NCC volume. Even the reference also not been given. But there is one entry namedŚabdakaustubhadūṣaṇa by Bhāskara Dīkṣita and the manuscript is available in Theosophical Library, Adyar, Chennai. This is found in their Descriptive catalogue vol XIII. no. 1825, but the cats says it is incomplete.

with regards
