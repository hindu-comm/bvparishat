In some sources, I have seen a reference to a work of Jagannāthapaṇḍita titled Śabdakaustubha-śāṇottejana. This is evidently a critique of Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita's Śabdakaustubha. I don't have access to the volume of NCC that may contain information regarding this text. If anyone has any information regarding this text or its manuscripts, pleaselet me know.
With best regards,
