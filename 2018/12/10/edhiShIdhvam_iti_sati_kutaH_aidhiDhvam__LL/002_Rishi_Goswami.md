No Sir. Thank you for replying. Infact, Your answer is exactly as per the Balamanorama where my doubts arise.  
  
As I mentioned specially, Chli lungi and Chleh sich, where like Seeyut, Sich is also Pratyapeksha. The Nimitta for Sich is Pratyaya only.  
  
As in Lingah Seeyut, and Chli Lungi=sich. Then if Idaagam is for sich ajd Seeyut, why in Seeyut it is consider as Pratyaya-bhakt and not considered Pratyay-bhakt in Sich. As per law, "yadAgamAh....grihyante", all It should be considered Pratyay-bhakt which is probably the secknd Paksha. Where Balamanorama says, "इड्भिन्न...." means we will accept DHatva only for idbhinnas.  
  
So when it's Idaagam, why for 1 it is Dhaatvanga as you saod in Sich case, it is "Edh(i)+shta" but in Seeyut case, it is "Edh +(I)sheeshta" .
