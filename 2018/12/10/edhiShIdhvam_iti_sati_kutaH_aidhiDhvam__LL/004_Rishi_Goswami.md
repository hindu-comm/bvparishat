Thank you for pictures. I've got the answer now. AidhiDHvam is acceptable to BhaaSHya because Sich is Lungnimitta but it's a DhaatukArya, as in Sootra which doea Chli does it for Dhaatu, not for Pratyay, like Sutra which does Seeyut does it for Pratyaya.

But personally, this argument doesn't dissolve in my stomach. I'd prefer Haradatt. Idbhinna should only be accepted. Still, I'm so small to say, or comment. Whatever BhaaSHyakaar saya should be accepted.

Saadaram NamAmi.  
RiSHih.
