\<\< Your answer is exactly as per the Balamanorama where my doubts arise.>\>

  

In my self-study, I did not use any Kaumudi works. It is true that I started with these works, but I did not understand anything from them. In the very beginning from the use of the sutrasहलन्त्यम्, पूर्वत्रासिद्धम्, I understood that these works assume the knowledge of the complete Astadhyayi that I did not have then. There was nobody to guide me and I did not have time to attend classes, because I was employed and whole day I had to be in office. I did not know the name of any author of the commentator of the Astadhyayi. I wrote to MLBD to send Astadhyayi with a Hindi commentary. I received theअष्टाध्यायी भाष्य प्रथमावृत्ति by पं॰ ब्रह्मदत्त जिज्ञासु. I started with this book only.

  

So I am trying to reply to your problem with whatever I have studied. Let us see what the oldest commentary on Astadhyayi, viz.काशिका says (see the attached file1).

It is clear from the commentary on P.8.3.78-79 that the optional verb-form is in case of thatधातु which isइण्णन्त and thereafter if theइट् intervenes beforeध्वम्.

Here the धातु "एध्" is not इण्णन्त and hence the 2nd verb-form, viz.ऐधिध्वम्, is not supported by the Astadhyayi.

Theमहाभाष्य also does not say anything about it (see the attached file2).

  

Now coming directly to your problem, I quote from theमाधवीया-धातुवृत्ति (pl. see the attached file3):

"अत्र हरदत्त एवं मूर्द्धन्यमुक्त्वा पक्षान्तरमाह - 'अन्ये त्विटो विभाषाया वक्ष्यमाणत्वाद् गोबलीवर्दन्यायेन तद्व्यतिरिक्तमिणन्तमिह गृह्यते इति वदन्त ऐधिध्वमित्यादौ ढत्वं नेच्छन्ति' ।"

  

Hmm ! Then it is the पदमञ्जरीकार हरदत्त मिश्र who has first quoted the opinion of some others about the other verb-form.

OK. If such verb-form can be traced in Skt literature, it can be acceptable.

  

Best wishes

Narayan Prasad
