Namaskar,

This is a very broad requirement and one that you will have to primarily address yourself - scholars here can guide, but we have to do the main work.

  
My suggestion: [archive.org](http://archive.org) can be used very profitably to find (and search inside) excellent books on the subject matter.

  

  

> Also please explain how Yoga is integral part of Patanjali Yoga > system.

  

This is a bit like asking " please explain how the Sun is an integral part of the solar system"

  

Patanjali Yoga 'system' is all about Yoga, it is a defining, definitive systematization of the Yoga tradition as pertains to mental control, the so-called Raja (Dhyana) yoga path. it has its roots in Samkhya philosophy. See commentaries on the Patanjala Yoga Sutras (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga_Sutras_of_Patanjali>)  

  

There is another branch of Yoga that has links to the Tantra (Siddhanta, Agama) path - it is the so-called the Hatha (Kundalini, Laya) yoga path. Here the emphasis is on breath (prana) control, and in Tantra, personal deity worship (nyasa, yantra, mantra).

  

There are also the karma yoga and the bhakti yoga paths; see the Bhagavad Gita + commentaries and Yoga Vasistha for more

  

There is also the Vedanta (Jnana) path which follows the upanishadic tradition of nididhyasana (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nididhy%C4%81sana>)

  

Suggestion: Study Raja Yoga, Karma Yoga and Bhakti Yoga by Swami Vivekananda, Light on Yoga, Light on Pranayama by BKS Iyengar, Hathayogapradipika, Gherandasamhita and Sivasamhita english translations, and The Principal Upanishads by S Radhakrishnan to begin with.

  

  

kind regards

Harsha
