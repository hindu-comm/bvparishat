Praagabhaava - the absence of a particular thing before its production. It is beginningless (anaadiH) and wth an end (saantaH).

Pradhvamsa - the absence of a particular thing after its destruction. It has a beginning (saadiH) but endless (anantaH).

Anyonyaabhaava - difference of identity. When you say a pot is not a pice of cloth, the difference (mutual) one cognizes is this abhava.

Atyantaabhaava - the absence (negation) of all temporal associations. The absence of शशश्रृङ्ग is an example. You cannot have शशीयत्व (having
possessive relationship) on a horne at any point of time .
