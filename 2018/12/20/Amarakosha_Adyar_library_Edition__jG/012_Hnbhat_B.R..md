I tried. It opens the file in the drive. Then on the right top you click and then you can see the option to download. Still if you cannot download, let me know. Or I shall send the download link from Internet archive, for direct download:

  

<https://archive.org/download/AmarakosaPartIII/Amarakosa%20Part-III.pdf>  

  

Click and download immediately.
