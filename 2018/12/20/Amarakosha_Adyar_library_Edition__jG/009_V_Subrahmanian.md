Namaste

  

In the Vol I of this series, in the pdf downloaded from the links provided here in this thread, there are only 400 pages of pdf. The printed page number is 327. The book ends abruptly with this entry of the Amarakosha:

However, in the Index Volume III, there are many page number references to quotations in Vol I showing page numbers beyond 400. There is one reference to Lalitasahasranama in Vol.I on p.609. But the above book does not have pages beyond 400. Is there any other edition which is a complete one?

  

Thanks.
