This is very useful. The list may be augmented with his:

  

1\. The Number of Rasas - a wonderful work which every student of Indian literature should have. It was originally issued by the Adyar Library in 1940. It may still be in print as it went thru a 3rd (?) edition in 1975.

2\. His essay on Raghuvamśa, a tour de force of Indian literary criticism, may perhaps have been included in the given list in 'The Essays on Ramayana'. Can someone confirm?

3\. His wonderful and nearly book length introductory essay to the 'Spiritual Heritage of Thyagaraja'

  

I dont know if many of his forewords, Samskrta Ranga articles and lectures have been collected and issued in print form. I'd be interested to know.

  

Thanks,

  
Srini
