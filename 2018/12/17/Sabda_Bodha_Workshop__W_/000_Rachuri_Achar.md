Namaamsi,

  Dear All, It is well known that Nyaya Shastra is useful for all disciplines of Shastra. The Nyaya School has developed a terminology of its own to elaborately define any object based on the relationship it holds w.r.t to other objects called the Shabdha Bodha method. The Sabdha Bodha prakriya of Nyaya Shastra is a unique tool useful in unambiguously putting forth definitions of various categories of objects that exist in the Universe. This technical language developed by the Nyaya School has over a period of time become the language of all shastric discourses. In a sense this language is considered as the Language of Philosophy in India. It is therefore, strongly recommended to undertake the study of Navya-Nyaya language and the ontology of of Vaisheshikas for the students of any Indian shastric school, without which, one cannot paraphrase a single line of shastric monograph written in Navya-Nyaya style. The common learner finds this method difficult to fathom due to its terse nature. Nowadays many students are undergoing training in traditional Gurukulas or learning Shastras under a specific Guru in their free time. The knowledge of the Sabdha Bodha method would help the student to learn any shastra very easily and confidently. It also enhances once intellectual capability and logical thinking. Here is a unique opportunity to learn Nyaya Shastra Sabda Bodha Prakriya from experts in the field. Atmashrama is planning to conduct a series of workshops by renowned experts of Nyaya Shastra. The first in the series of workshops is going to be held on Dec 23, 2018. Please cascade this information so that it would be helpful to those who are interested.
