I think it could be helpful to compare the analyses of the sūtras under consideration by three outstanding authorities on the subject (Boethlingk 1887, Kartre 1987, Sharma 2002). I am attaching a file where I have assembled their views in context, so everyone interested in this matter may form themselves an opinion of Boethlingk’s (un)reliability with the help of the English translations of the other two scholars.



“Sāyaṇa”, as Mādhava continues to be wrongly identified\*, has acquired the merit of being an influential commentator, but to my limited knowledge his name does not rank among authoritative grammarians in the field of Vedic morphology. So-called “irregular forms”, which might be considered to be such only insofar as they deviate from the grammatical norms of Pāṇini’s *bhāṣā*, often reveal themselves to be quite “regular” within the grammatical system of the much older Vedic language (*chandas*).

A. A. MacDonell’s “Vedic Grammar” (1910) and his “Vedic Grammar for Students” (1916) \[full citation in the attached PDF\], containing a separate chapter on the Vedic accent, can contribute to grasp the grammatical intricacies of the language of the Saṃhitās more systematically. Accompanied by the scholarly presentation of this trained linguist, the study of Pāṇini’s admirable insight into Vedic word formation will be greatly facilitated.
