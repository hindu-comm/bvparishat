*Aphorism* seems a better translation (than *verse )  
*

for *sUtra.*

*  
*

Hieun Tsang referred to *as"TAdhyAyI* as a text of a thousand verses (or *s'loka*-s).

Given that the average number of syllables per *sUtra* works out to be 8,

the extent of the text can be said to be a thousand verses,  

as there are nearly 4000 *sUtra*-s

(3983 as per one reckoning).
