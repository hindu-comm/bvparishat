Dear Professor Slaje

In my view Mr S.D.Joshi and Roodbergen's English tr.of Panini's Ashtadhyayi may be considered an authentic one..It has been published by Sahitya Akademi,New Delhi.As regards Eng.tr. of Vedic Grammar I am not updated at present.I appreciate your view of Sanskrit Grammatical texts which should be studied with the help of Comm. by ancient Indian Acharyas.The same opinion has been expressed by Mr George Cardona.

Kindest regards

Sincerely

Girish K.Jha
