\>This is simply a misunderstanding of Boehtlingk's explanation. Boehtlingk does not say here that पित् "can be oxytone (उदात्त)",

\>but that the elements धि in the quoted "examples" (रारन्धि, यन्धि, युयोधि) are "Oxytona" (Plural of "oxyton")

\>- "despite पित्" (which is per se indicative of an अनुदात्त accent).

Before I say something related to the above comments, I would like to highlight the following points.  

  

The main aim of my initial message was to attract attention of the Panini scholars towards two points:

  (1) The सरस्वतीकण्ठाभरण of भोजदेव (व्याकरण) (SKA) is a great revised edition of Panini.

  (2) Bohtlingk's Panini's Grammatik is still relevant and useful for the study of Panini.

  

Now I come to the comments of the above scholars.

I express my heartfelt thanks to Dr Roland Steiner, for giving the exact meaning of Bohtlingk's commentary, and to Dr Walter Slaje for supplying extra examples from the Rigveda with high-pitched imperative terminations (hí / dhí).

  

That the affixधि is उदात्त (oxytone, or hight-pitched) is not justified by any Panini sutra. In the present case the accent rule has to be supplemented in order to be more specific and precise.

That धि is उदात्त was specifically expressed by Bohtlingk - his statement was based on actual observation.  

And I became confirmed that the SKA sutraहियासामः (= हि-यास्-आमः), अनुवृत्ति - उदात्तः, is correct.

  

If Bohtlingk's work in German is translated into English, it will be more widely used by both students and researchers.  

  

If you want to learn Panini better, study the सरस्वतीकण्ठाभरण of भोजदेव (व्याकरण). Much research is required to understand this work. I have not yet understood its many accent rules, e.g.न शतृ-शानन्-शानचः ।

  

Thanks and regards
