Professor Joshi was in ill health for a few years prior to his passing in 2013, and so was the situation with Roodbergen who passed away in 2017. The gap between the first 13 volumes and the last volume published in 2011 is itself due to gradually deteriorating health. I visited him almost once a year. Roodbergen was also my classmate at the University of Pune when I was doing my MA during 1966-68 and studying with Professor Joshi.
