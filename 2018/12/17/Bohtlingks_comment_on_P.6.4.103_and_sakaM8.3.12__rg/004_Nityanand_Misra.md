Some comments.

  

1) Firstly on this part inBöhtlingk’s commentary

  

Nach 3,4,88 kann हि im Veda पित् sein; ist es पित्, so ist es nach 1,2,4 nicht ङित्.

By P.3.4.88 (वा छन्दसि), हि in Veda can be पित्; if it is पित्, it is not ङित् as per P.1.2.4 (सार्वधातुकमपित्).

  

The statement in red by Böhtlingk does not make sense to me. P. 1.2.4 says that a सार्वधातुक that is not पित् is like a ङित्. P. 1.2.4 does not say “something which is पित् is not a ङित्”. Such a conclusion actually follows from *the non-application* of P. 1.2.4 and not its application. Note how the Kashika on P. 6.4.103 simply [says](https://archive.org/details/KashikaWithNyasaPadaManjariAndBhavaBodhiniPart8Dr.JayaShankarLalTripathiAndSudhakarMalaviya/page/n299) ‘वा छन्दसि’ (३.४.८८) इति पित्वेनास्याङित्त्वम्, i.e. the अङित्त्व follows from पित्व alone. The Nyasa is also clear, that 1.2.4 applies in the अपित् पक्ष and not the पित् पक्ष.

  

2) Böhtlingk has not explained (either he ignored or was not aware) that रारन्धि (in place of रमस्व), etc are irregular forms to begin with. For example in रारन्धि there is परस्मैपद (when रम् is आत्मनेपदी and not परस्मैपदी), there is elision of शप् (when रम् is in भ्वादिगण where there is no such elision), there is अभ्यास (without लिट्, सन्, or यङ्), and the अभ्यास has become दीर्घ. There are *four deviations*, not counting the svara, from the regular form रमस्व. The Kashika explains these irregularities by saying व्यत्ययेन and छान्दसत्वात्.

  

3)As for the svara part, Sayana’s inisightful commentary of RV 1.91.13 is a must-read. As per Sayana, the अङित्त्व of हि (→ धि) in रारन्धि is not due to पित्व by P. 3.4.88 but due to आर्धधातुकत्व by P. 3.4.117 (छन्दस्युभयथा, on which the Kashika clarifies किं लिङेव अनन्तरः सम्बध्यते, न एतदस्ति, सर्वम् एव प्रकरणम् अपेक्ष्यैतदुच्यते, तिङ्शिदादि छन्दस्युभयथा भवति) as a result of which P. 1.2.4 (सार्वधातुकमपित्) **does not apply**. The result is that हि is अङित्. By P. 3.4.87 (सेर्ह्यपिच्च), हि is अपित्. As it is अपित्, P. 3.1.4 (अनुदात्तौ सुप्पितौ) does not apply but P. 3.1.3 (आद्युदात्तश्च) applies, giving us the उदात्त accent. With this explanation, there is no issue with the accent to be addressed. Sayana’s explanation is more convincing than Kashika’s (which does not address the accent) and Böhtlingk’s.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
