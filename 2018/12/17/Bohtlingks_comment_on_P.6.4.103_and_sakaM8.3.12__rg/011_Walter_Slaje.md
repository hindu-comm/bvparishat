Dear Madhav,

  

I could not agree more. Thank you for outlining the differences of the two ways of approaching Vedic grammar!

Since MacDonell's representation is of the prakriyā type and in the English language, and since Boehtlink's non-English Pāṇini had more or less caused the present discussion, I was thinking someone might appreciate references to English translations of Pāṇini (by Indian authorities) and of Vedic grammar (by a British authority). It was certainly not intended to blame a premodern author, rather the opposite. The insights and achievements of ancient Indian grammarians have received and continue to receice globally the deep admiration they truly deserve.

  

I will now be offline during approximately a fortnight and thus unable to respond.

  

Kindly regarding,

Walter Slaje
