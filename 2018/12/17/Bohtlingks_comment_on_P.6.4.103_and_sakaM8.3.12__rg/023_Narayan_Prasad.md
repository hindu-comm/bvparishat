\<\<Hieun Tsang referred to*as"TAdhyAyI*as a text of a thousand verses (or*s'loka*-s).Given that the average number of syllables per*sUtra*works out to be 8,the extent of the text can be said to be a thousand verses,as there are nearly 4000*sUtra*-s\>\>

  

The relevant passage from Xuanzang is attached herewith. \[Ref: Li Rongxi (1996): "The Great Tang Dynasty Record of the Western Regions", p.68.\]

  

The actual number of syllables varies from 1 (cf. P.6.1.1222, or P.6.3.138) to as high as about 88 (cf.P.5.4.77).

It will be interesting to know the exact no. of syllables in the Ashtadhyayi and get the actual average

Narayan Prasad
