Dear Walter,

  

  I agree with your comments that make a distinction between what appears to be irregular from the Pāṇinian point of view, and what may appear regular from an independent study of the Veda. Sāyaṇa, for better or worse, was explaining the Vedic forms within the scope of the Pāṇinian system, using all the chandas-related options communicated with words like bahulam, ubhayathā etc. An independent study of the Vedic forms is a modern phenomenon, which may or may not support Pāṇinian derivations. An explanation of what may have been Pāṇini's account of a given form is not necessarily going to match a modern independent account, and it need not. It would be useful to maintain the distinction between these different approaches to the study of Sanskrit. This is my two cents. With best regards,

  

Madhav
