One dictionary gives:

  

[TABLE]

  

It looks like it is of yellow color. Then, there is the word 'ruchi' too in that shloka after this word. This could mean: the lalATa of the ardhanArIshvara murti is bright/ splendor yellow for Parvati part and the third eye on the Shvia part.

  

Not sure if the above is correct.
