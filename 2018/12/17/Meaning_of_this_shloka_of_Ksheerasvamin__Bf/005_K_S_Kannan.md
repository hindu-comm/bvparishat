**May the \[Third\] Eye** on the forehead (**-*lalATa-vilocanam***) of S'iva and PArvatI (***S'ivayoH***)

- which \[eye\] has the splendour of*gorocanA* acting the role of the *tilaka* (auspicious mark on the forehead)

(***tilakAyamAna*-*gorocanA*-*ruci-***), and which is as it were \[their mutual\] love exploded (***sphuTitaH anurAgaH*** ),

owing to the squeezing out (**-*nipIDanena***) consequent to the intense mutual embrace (***anyonya-gADha-parirambha-***)

getting consolidated in the exterior (***bahiH piNDIbhavan iva**)*

\- **confer \[multifarious\] auspicious \[things\]** upon you (*vaH s'ivAni dis'yAt*) !

  

**Gist:**

Lord Siva and Parvati are in the hardest possible embrace (in their *ardha-nArIs'vara* aspect).

Hard pressed, their mutual love inside has burst out, and has got solidified outside.

It is this that is showing itself as their third eye

and the this eye has the splendour of *gorocana*, and further constitutes a veritable *tilaka* for them.

May that venerable Eye bestow all that is auspicious on all of you!

  

(Love gives. Divine Love confers auspicious things.

The tilaka-like eye on the forehead of Ardhanarishvara is

the embodiment of the greatest love ever possible

\- namely that between Siva and Parvati).

May That Eye bestow the best!)

  

*Just an attempt. Others may be able to provide a better translation.*
