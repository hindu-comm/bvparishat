Thank you Neelesh ji.

  

I still have a doubt. Panini in the aforesaid sutra says that there's no need to teach it, because, as has been interpreted, he thinks that the meaning is determined by the usage in the loka. As the authority for the meaning is loka, why not consult those who use that word, who may or may not be vaiyakaranas? If they use the word, they must have an idea about its meaning, especially if the word relates to a ritual, the practice of which has been seen off and on.

  

Kindly guide.  

  

Regards

Satyan
