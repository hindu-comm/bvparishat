As I understand it, whenever in doubt, there is no issue whatsoever in consulting those who use that word. "असन्देहार्थम्..." doesn't advise against asking others. It just says that that on studying vyakarana, you will (most likely) not have any doubts right in the beginning itself, thereby not requiring to consult. (Of course occasionally one may still have questions, as nagesha puts - यस्य तु अधीतव्याकरणस्यापि क्वचित् सन्देहः.... )।

  

Hope this helps
