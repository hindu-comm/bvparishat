'असंदेहार्थम् अध्येयं व्याकरणम्' means that "In order to not have any confusion ("प्रागभावः" इति कैयटः), one should study vyakarana". It does not mean that "If you do not study vyakarana, you will end up with doubts". And thus, the two views can be linked by saying that "while the meaning of the words is clear from their usage in the loka, a mandamati can get some doubts, and the best way not to get these doubts in the first place is to study vyakarana. For instance, a non-learned person might miss out the swara differences in the two pronunciations ofस्थूलपृषती, which a learned person will certainly not.
