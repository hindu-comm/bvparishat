Namaste

  

In Ashtadhyayi 1.2.56, Panini says that there's no need to teach the rule relating to the dependence of meaning on the pradhana in case of a compound word. Patanjali in the paspashahnika in the part beginning from 'असंदेहार्थम् अध्येयं व्याकरणम्" gives an example of the word स्थूलपृषती, and says that an avaiyakarana cannot by himself determine its meaning, and hence only a vaiyakarana can.

  

Is there a difference of opinion between Panini and Patanjali here?

  

Kindly guide.
