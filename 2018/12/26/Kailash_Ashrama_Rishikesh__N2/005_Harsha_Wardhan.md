Namaskar to all,

  

This is the sort of thread that truly represents the significance of a forum like BVP for seekers of Indian knowledge generally and beginners on the spiritual path specifically.

  

I respectfully take the liberty of adding to the scope of the original question. There must be other similar ashramas (and gurus connected thereto) that/who are highly respected in traditional circles that we (laymen) do not know about.

  

Could the knowledgeable and learned members here kindly consider posting details of respected and highly regarded institutions and gurus (any that they know of)?

  

We could make a list here for the guidance of aspirants and members looking for guidance/direction.

  

kind regards  

Harsha
