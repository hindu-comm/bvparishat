It appears that any sannyAsI from any sampradAya can study there.

I've seen sannyAsI-s from other sampradAya staying and studying there, upto 2007.

The present maNaDaleshvara may have changed rules of stay, but attending classes is like old times. It may be bit difficult for a person who doesn't prepare well, since he likes to test students.

A person who is brAhmaNa by birth may get preferences, but that doesn't mean that you can not study. Good student attract attention of teachers, irrespective of caste.

People can stay at other Ashrama and do study in kailAsa Ashrama.

If stay is allowed in kailAsa, it'll be always free of cost for sannyAsI-s, but he has to follow rules.
