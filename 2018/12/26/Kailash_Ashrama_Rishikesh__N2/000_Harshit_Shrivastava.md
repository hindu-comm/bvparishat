Kailash ashrama is a well known place for the study of the shastras. Only Brahmacharins and Sannyasins are allowed for the detailed study. However is it true that only those sannyasins who are brahmins by birth are allowed to stay or any sannyasin irrespective of his birth caste can study there? Also, are there any accommodation charges for the same or not? Because not all the sannyasins can have money for the long stay to study. If anyone knows about the details, I request you to please share! Thank You.
