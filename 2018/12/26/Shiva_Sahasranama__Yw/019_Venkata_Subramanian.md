Dear Sir,

i remember to have read this once. This work was published by Sri Vani Vilas Press Kumbakonam long time back.

I do not have a copy now with me. Presumably this is from Southern Edition of Padma Puranam This is based on cnversation between SriKrishna and Markandeya maharishi.

I am trying to get a copy from my frienḍ If I get it, I will scan and send a copy to you.
