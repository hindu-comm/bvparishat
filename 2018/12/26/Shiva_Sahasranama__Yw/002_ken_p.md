*The**Shiva sahasranama**is a "list of a thousand names" of[Shiva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva "Shiva"), one of the most important deities in[Hinduism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism "Hinduism"). In Hindu tradition a[sahasranama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahasranama "Sahasranama")is a type of devotional hymn (Sanskrit:[stotra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stotra "Stotra")) listing many names of a deity. The names provide an exhaustive catalog of the attributes, functions, and major mythology associated with the figure being praised. The Shiva Sahasranama is found in[Shiv Mahapuran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva_Purana "Shiva Purana")and many other scriptures such as[Linga Purana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linga_Purana). As per Shiv Mahapuran when[Vishnu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnu "Vishnu")was unable to defeat the demons after many attempts he prayed to Shiv who granted him the[Sudarshan Chakra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudarshan_Chakra "Sudarshan Chakra")for fighting the demons.*
