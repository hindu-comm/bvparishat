I faintly remember that I have a copy of the Shivasahasranama with a Sanskrit commentary by H.H.Paramacharya of Kanchi.

  

I will have to search for it in my vast collection of rare and important books,which may take some time.

  

Best luck to others for getting it very quickly for mental peace.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
