Namaste,

  

Nilaknatha's bhavadipa tika is there on Siva Sahasranama from Mahabharata. Giving below links to AK Sastri's translation of Nilakantha's tika on SSN from MB and Ram Karan Sharma's book on eight different Siva Sahasranamas. Ram Karna Sharma's book also contains Nilakantha's tika on SSN from MB with Hindi translation in addition to a detailed introduction by him.

Other commentators of the Mahabharata, like Madhvacharya and Vadiraja, also would have commented upon SSN. But, this has to be explored. I have not verified it.  

  

regards  
shankara
