Out of the two PDF's seen by now Shiva Sahasra Astaka Ram Karan Sharma Nag Publications contains all 8 editions of the text, so it's a critical edition. But the glossary at the end does not differ much from the one listed below, the same amount of depth and detail.

Is there a book in a style close to Nityānanda Miśra?

Even in a single sentence he never forgets to give literal meaning,

  

\> A Sanskrit word for service/waiting upon is ‘shushrusha’ (śuśrūṣā, शुश्रूषा). Literally, it means “a desire to listen” (श्रोतुमिच्छा शुश्रूषा).

  

and in many cases add the derivation as well.

  

\> meaning of the word atharva (अथर्व) in Atharvaveda.

\> Here is a quick answer as per Nirukta 11.18.

\> √tharv (थर्व्) = to go or move

\> tharvati (थर्वति) = \[he/she\] goes/moves

\> tharvan (थर्वन्) = one who moves

\> atharvan (अथर्वन्) = one who does not move, i.e. having a stable and equanimous nature (स्थिरप्रकृति)

\> अथर्वाणोऽथनवन्तः, थर्वतिश्चरतिकर्मा तत्प्रतिषेधः

\> —Nirukta 11.18

\> अथर्वाणो कस्मात्, ते ह्येते अथनवन्तः, किमिदिमथनं येन ते तद्वन्तः, अत आह, थर्वतिः चरतिकर्मा गच्छत्यर्थः, ततः किम्, तत्प्रतिषेधः, पुरस्तादकारः, न थर्वन्ति इति अथर्वाणः, स्थिरप्रकृतयो हि ते

\> —Durgadas' commentary

Before I start hunting please tell what amount and what kind of comments are there?

Bellow is a page fromSiva Sahasranama Stotra Nilakantha Tika Ananta Krishna Sastri R. V. Ramaswamy Sastrulu & Sons - this much anyone can understand not even opening a book.

No dhatus, no history or epic story behind, no sources quoted. Is there a detailed, maybe even Paninian analysis of each word, not just a single-double-trippleEnglish meaning, that is rather self-evident in most cases.
