Namaste Prof. Malhar Kulkarni

  

When the path and direction of journey is messed up, it is not difficult to understand why one does not reach the desired goal ! Apply this to three hundred years of Sanskrit studies and current status.



a) The Three missing are ' Muni-Traya authority', the 'Vedangataa of Vyakarana', and loss of 'Shikshaa foundation of Vyakarana' . These have damaged the pedagogy, modeling and purpose of 'Studying Panini and the language of the grammar work.

  

b) The three unwarranted distorting-substitutions are ' Sanskrit as Historical language, a language of society standing in isolation from related languages of Brahmi family ( Prakruts,Dramids), and 'Script only language' - which have damaged the clairty required to use and adapt Samskrutham for utility applications.

  

Thus, When Patanjali is studied with a colored lens that ' Patanjali is at a loss to understand Panini's intention' ! the outcome can not be any different ! These and similar considerations have led us to terminate our*Mahābhāṣya*project.".

  

C)   You have made an observation - " This is what remains of our tradition. Everyone wants to open his own shop. No wonder then that the whole tradition is in a mess.' I prefer to modify the statement and say -"**This is what remains of our tradition. And still we have a chance to bring back the right understanding of Tradition as relevant for Current Society, for utility-application benefits, IF ONLY WE CAN SEE THE TRADITION AS IT WAS , AS IT WAS DESIGNED and AS IT WAS USED'.**

**Do We have the WILL and COURAGE to do this ?** **Re-channelthe resources to restore the tradition, even if it means ' loosing caste** **amongthe ' nootana -rishi's of ?? where we need the wisdom of ' POORVEBHIH- RISHIBHIH'?? Can we start this exercise from Sanskrit Computational Linguistics ??**
