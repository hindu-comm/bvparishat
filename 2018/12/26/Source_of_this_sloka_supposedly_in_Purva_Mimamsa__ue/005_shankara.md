Damodara Dasa ji,

  

As I had mentioned in my reply, Buhler catalogue of manuscrpts in Gujarat contains details of the Brihat Samhita, a dharmasastra text.  

  

Buhler's catalogue of manuscripts in Gujarat is available at  

<http://wujastyk.net/mscats/Sanskrit_Catalogues/Biswas%200359%20Gujarat%20-%20Buhler/>

  

I will let you know if I find details.  

  

regards  
shankara
