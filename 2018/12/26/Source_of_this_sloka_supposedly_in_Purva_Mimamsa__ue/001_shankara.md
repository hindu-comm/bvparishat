Namaste,

  

This verse is quoted in 'Sarvadarsanasamgraha' in the chapter 'Purnaprajnadarsana' and ascribed to Brihatsamhita, a text on Dharmasastra (not the popular work of Varahamihira).

  

While commenting on this verse quoted in 'Vedantasara' of Sadananda, Col. G.A. Jacob explains that 'The Brihatsamhita referred to in the footnote is not the astrological work of Varahamihira; but may possibly be that on philosophy or Dharma, to which reference is made in the abridged St. Petersburg Lexicon. In the list of law books given in Buhler's catalogue of manuscripts in Gujarat, there is a Brihatsamhita attributed to Vyasa.' (page 43, footnote 1 and additional note on page 158 of Vedanta Sara with Commentaries of Nrisimha Saraswati & Ramatirtha - GA Jacob 1934 published by Nirnayasagar).
