Hello Sir,

  

The verse is found in a slightly different form in Prakāśātman's Śābdanirṇaya, presumably from the 10th century (v. 69):

upakramopasaṃhārāv abhyāso 'pūrvatā phalam /

arthavādopapattī ca yato jīvaḥ tataḥ paraḥ //

  

I was unable to find an earlier source for this śloka, which indeed is often found ascribed to 'Pūrva-Mīmāṃsā' in secondary literature and general conversation.  

  

With best wishes,

  

Hugo
