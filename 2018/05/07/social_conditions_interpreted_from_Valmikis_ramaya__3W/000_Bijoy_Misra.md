Dear friends,

While I am enjoying the Madhava stanzas, i remain stuck with Valmiki's

characterization of the Sita in Lanka. I do have a question in this regard:

is there any book trying reconstruct Indian society at Valmiki's time?

I am thinking in the line of Agrawal's thesis "India at the time of Panini".

Please help. Please discard Pollock and the kind. 

Thank you.

BM
