Namaste Sivakumarji,

  

The softcopy of brahmasutravRtti is available here:<https://archive.org/details/Brahmasutra_Vritti_Sadasivendra_Sarasvati_1909_SVV> while the same along with Hindi translation is available at Kailashashram, Rishikesh, in print.

  

yogasutravRtti softcopy is at<https://ia802704.us.archive.org/31/items/YogaSutraVritti/YogaSutraVritti.pdf>, but I am not sure of print.

  

Kind rgds,  
--Praveen R. Bhat
