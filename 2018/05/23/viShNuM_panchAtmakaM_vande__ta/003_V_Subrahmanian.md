I am providing the images here from the commentary to the Narayaneeyam 90.2:

In retrospect I think that the ' विष्णुंपञ्चात्मकंवन्दे' is a coined statement and not part of any extant puranic or any other literary work.

  

If in case there is a puranic statement like this, a reference is welcome.

  

Thanks
