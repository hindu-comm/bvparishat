Thanks Kalyan ji, for the response. Are these verses found in the Mahabharata in the same chapter where the VSN is there? How about the other verses like 'Sri Rama Rama Rameti....' that appears as a dialogue between Parvati and Ishwara? And some Bh.Gita verses and the one by Sanjaya (yatra yogeshvaraH krishno....).   

  

regards
