Without knowing what they are or after knowing what they are. The superiority of brahmins of lack of the same is irrelevant to this thread, or so do I hope.

If you do not know, you cannot say that he and his followers didn't borrow from Upanishads so unequivocally; thanks for accepting the same.

Your argument would have made sense if I had said that absence of proof means proof of presence! I didn't even state anything close to it, so please revisit your thinking!

No, no, look at the meaning given for the same as to what ideas they talk of. You want to find the same compounded word with same meaning; why not the same idea with different words. The Upanishads talk of dependent origination all the time. This is what Advaita is strong at pointing out mithyAtva as. The entire idea of dhamma is nothing but dharma/karma. Almost everything in Buddhism is borrowed from Vedas with corrupted Sanskrit words and here you are claiming that Advaita Vedanta borrows from Buddhism!



> Great logic sir. How can any literature have no authors?  

Thanks, its called anyathAnupapattiH. Vedas are the breath of Ishvara as per the mantra. I will take your sarcasm as an objection worth considering as soon as you explain as to how you or someone is the author of your breath. If you cannot, and still reject what Vedas are, then why look for answers in Vedas or derived philosophies thereof! Why even accept Atman or mokSha then! Or is this completely academic for you?Instead, you can explain big bang in a different thread and its source as well.

In short, just by being a human produce, it is flawed. Else you and I would accept anything and everything that anyone says, but we look at with a suspicious eye due to our own human flaws. The jaundiced eye issue. Buddhists have lost this case long back even when they knew what apaurusheya means, you can't win it back for them even if you knew the same. Pls study what apaurusheya is if you are truly interested. श्रद्धावाल्ँलभते ज्ञानम्।

By what understanding of the word sat and the na\~nj meanings? In other words, please explain as to why none of the six meanings of na\~nj prefix to sat cannot mean shUnya.

For one, "maybe" doesn't mean acceptance. For another, 2 levels being close definitely doesn't mean shUnya and pUrNa are the same; they are 180 degrees apart.
