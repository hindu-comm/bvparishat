Well said, Paturi ji. I am reminded of a work by Late Vidwan Sri Polagam Rama Sastri, ' Chatur mata saamarasyam' where he has listed over 60 similarities across the four disciplines: Advaita, Shivaadvaita (ShrikanTha), Vishistadvaita and Dvaita. Yet, we see that there are core differences across these systems.
