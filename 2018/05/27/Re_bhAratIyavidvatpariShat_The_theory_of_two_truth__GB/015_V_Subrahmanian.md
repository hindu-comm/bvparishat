There is an Upanishad by the name Amritabindu (also called Brahmabindu)
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amritabindu_Upanishad>  which scholars place as of the same period as the above listed few sannyasa Upanishads. One verse from this Upanishad each is quoted by Gaudapada and Shankara:

  

<http://upanishad.info/upanishads/text/krishna-yajurveda/sanskrit/amrita-bindu>

  

// The text sometimes appears under the title*Brahmabindu Upanishad*or*Amritanada Upanishad*, in some anthologies.^(//)

  

Gaudapada in the Karika 2.32:

  

न निरोधो नचोत्पत्तिर्नबद्धो न च साधकः।  
न मुमुक्षुर्न वै मुक्त इत्येषा परमार्थता ॥ ३२ ॥  

  

\[Many would think this is a composition of Gaudapada, but the entire verse is available in the above Upanishad.\]

  

Another verse from that Upanishad (cited below) is found in the Gaudapada Karika 3rd chapter with the same analogy: jiva = pot space, body = pot:

  

घटसंवृतमाकाशं नीयमाने घटे यथा ।  
घटो नीयेत नाकाशं तथा जीवो नभोपमः ॥ १३ ॥  

  

  

Shankara in the BSB 3.2.18:

  

‘एक एव हि भूतात्मा भूते भूते व्यवस्थितः। एकधा बहुधा चैव दृश्यते जलचन्द्रवत्’ (ब्र. बिं. १२) इति चैवमादिषु ॥ १८ ॥ 

This above verse has been cited by a Gaudiya commentator Rupa Goswami, which I had seen long ago.

  

Thus, the idea of 'paramarthika' is contained in the Upanishad. The idea of 'vyavaharika' is also contained in several upanishads:

  

। विज्ञानात्मा चिदा-भासो विश्वो *व्यावहारिको* जाग्रत्स्थूलदेहाभिमानी कर्मभूरिति च विश्वस्यनाम भवति ।  Paingala Upanishad<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paingala_Upanishad>  

  

//The date or author of*Paingala Upanishad*is unclear, but given its style and the texts it references, it is likely an early medieval era text because the 8th-century scholar[Adi Shankara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Shankara "Adi Shankara")refers to it in his[bhasya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhasya "Bhasya")(review and commentary) on[Brahma Sutras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahma_Sutras "Brahma Sutras").^([\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paingala_Upanishad#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDalal2014347,_Article_on_Upanishads-7)[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paingala_Upanishad#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKrishnan200421%E2%80%9322-8))//  

  

इतिसप्तविधं प्रोक्तं भिद्यते *व्यवहारतः *। मायोपाधिविनिर्मुक्तं शुद्धमित्यभिधीयते॥ ३८ Katharudropanishat (from where Shankara has cited in the Br.Up. for sannyasa)  

  

  

Thus, there is no need to think that the concept of vyavaharika-paramarthika is originally of Buddhistic origin; it is well established in the Upanishads.
