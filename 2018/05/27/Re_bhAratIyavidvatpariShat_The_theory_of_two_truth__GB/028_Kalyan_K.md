Apart from the Upanishads, the idea of 'vyavahara-paramartha' is found in many Puranas and the Mahabharata too:  

//  

The Mahabharata:  
  
12211011c पुरुषावस्थमव्यक्तं परमार्थं निबोधयत्  
12211012a इष्टिसत्रेण संसिद्धो भूयश्च तपसा मुनिः  
12211012c क्षेत्रक्षेत्रज्ञयोर्व्यक्तिं बुबुधे देवदर्शनः  

12211013a यत्तदेकाक्षरं ब्रह्म नानारूपं प्रदृश्यते//  
  
  
This is hardly an explicit reference to 2 truths. It looks like the above verse is not even from the critical edition.  
  
  
  
//The Vishnupuranam too has the terms 'paramartha' 'vyavahara' in abundance//  
  
  
Only if one follows advaita commentaries which were written post 13th century CE?
