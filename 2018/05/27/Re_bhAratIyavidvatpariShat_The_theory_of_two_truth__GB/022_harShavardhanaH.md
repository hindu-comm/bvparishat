Friends, let me chime in.

  

The theory of two truths is based on the the theory of the real and the phenomenal, which in turn is based upon the theory of the soul (whose existence the later Buddhists deny but the Buddha refused to say anything touching upon it) and the creation. Ergo, the two "levels' of truth, or two truths. That such penetrating seers as the Upanishadic rishis could not discern this model is something I do not accept. Dismissing their writings as unexplicit or roundabout is not fair. It is the truth that the Upanishads did first talk about the two truths.  

  

All these theories have their origin in Samkhya, (which I think the Buddha studied) and particularly in the theory of satkaryavada. If we see the effect as well as the cause, then at one level we can say that the effect is real (evidenced by senses) and so is the cause (inferred)
and they seem to be different (two truths, as it were), while at another level we can say that the effect comes from the cause and so there's only cause and no effect (one truth, as it were).

  

Swami Vivekananda puts it likes this (if I remember aright): **The effect is the cause evolved; the cause is the effect involved.**

  

The two truths have their origin in Samkhya, which is the oldest philosophy of India, and records of which have been maintained in the Upanishads, and parts of which was developed later by some Buddhist thinkers.

  

It has become fashionable to partly trace some old Indian ideas and attribute them to a new 'religion'. It is to be remembered that even the Buddha never claimed to have started a religion, or originated any ideas. The Buddha was never a Buddhist.
