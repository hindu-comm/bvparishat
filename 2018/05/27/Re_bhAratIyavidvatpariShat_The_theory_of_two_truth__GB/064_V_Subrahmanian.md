Shankara is doing exactly the opposite:

  

ज्ञानज्ञेयज्ञातृभेदरहितं परमार्थतत्त्वमद्वयमेतन्न बुद्धेनभाषितम्।यद्यपि बाह्यार्थनिराकरणं ज्ञानमात्रकल्पना च *अद्वयवस्तुसामीप्यमुक्तम्*। इदं तु परमार्थतत्त्वमद्वैतं वेदान्तेष्वेव विज्ञेयमित्यर्थः ॥  

  

The translation of Swami Gambhirananda is very clear here: //The nature of the supreme Reality is free from the differences of knowledge, known, and knower and is without a second. This fact was not expressed by *Buddha; though a near approach to non-dualism* was implied in his negation of outer objects and his imagination of everything as mere consciousness. But this non-duality, the essence of the ultimate Reality, is to be known from the Upanishads only. This is the purport.//

  

If Shankara was really acknowledging his doctrine's closeness to Buddhism, his wording should have been: अस्माभिः बौद्धसामीप्यमुच्यते \| \[We are saying that which is close to Buddhism\].

  

So, Shankara is only saying what essentially Buddha did not say and in what respects Buddha came close to Vedanta. And that the Paramarthika satyam can be known only from the Vedanta. This is quite different from saying 'Shankara acknowledged *his doctrine is close to Buddhism*.' And also that the idea of Paramarthika satyam is already in Vedanta and that is not within the grasp of Buddhism. Anyone who understands the language of Shankara can see how far removed it is from the claim made above. The gist is: It is not that 'Shankara is close to Buddhism.' On the other hand, as per Shankara, it is Buddhism that has come close to Vedanta in those respects, but missed the essential Paramarthika Truth of Vedanta'.

  

When one understands what Shankara has exactly stated in the Mandukya Bhashya, above, he can easily see the remarks about Shankara's Brahma sutra bhashya on Buddhism are also not maintainable.
