What is wrong with that? An author can be seen to annotate/reproduce verbatim a passage.

Why should he state that when it is already known to be there?

  

  

//Statement of one is enough to imply the other. //  
  

//Not so. If one does not know what is the other.//  

  

If one studies a text under an Acharya one does not have any problem. The Acharya, being more knowledgeable, will fill in the gaps. The difficulty is only when one approaches a text on his own.

  

  

//But Shankara is the gold standard for advaitins and he holds it as karika.//  

  

For Advaitins if there is no contradiction, taking it as a shruti is not diminishing the power of a karika. That is why Shankara himself has called Gaudapada a 'sampradayavit Acharya.' Acharya vaak is veda vaak.

  

// If VP is talking about 2 truths, and if advaita is borrowing the 2 truths from VP, one wonders why Shankara does not quote it in the context of the 2 truths doctrine.//

  

When VP is talking about 2 truths, and when it is lifting it from the Upanishads, one wonders why Nagarjuna does not quote the source.

  

// To prove that Nagarjuna "lifted from vedanta", you have to prove that the Mandukya upanishad is pre-Nagarjuna, which is by no means accepted universally.//

  

For vaidikas, there is no need for a 'universal' acceptance. That is why nastikas are kept out of this. It is well known that Nagarjuna being of a recent origin, his words from the Mandukya is a clear give away. Anyone familiar with the ten upanishads, at least, will easily find this out.
