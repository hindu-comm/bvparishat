Thanks, I'll take



that as a compliment. I'll also leave you with some thought: Its okay to inquire in the tradition, but not question everything stated in the tradition with pre-concluded notions. If apaurusheyatva is funny, the theory of karma should also sound hilarious, since child prodigies, etc, are likely just out of the blue coincidences!As for this age, why should Ishvara, Atma, saMsAra, mokSha, etc, be for this age then? Perhaps, just comparative study and finding faults with tradition that has absolutely no basis in this age is up to the mark for sure.

  
Best wishes,
