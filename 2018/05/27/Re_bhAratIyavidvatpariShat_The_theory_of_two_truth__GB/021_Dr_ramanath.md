The theory of two truth; The doctrine of absolute middle/middle way  
gets us to comprehend two kinds of Truth Absolute Truth only can be  
cognized comprehension of these two satyas  
(Truths) as together but also distinctively. The very first of is  
called as samvrti-satya  
(Conditional Truth) and scond one is paramartha-satya (Absolute Truth).  
This kind of exposition first time given by Nagarjuna in his text  
Mulamadhyamaka Sastram.  
Shankara distinction has explained this in Advaita context .
