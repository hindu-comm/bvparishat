The doctrine of 3 truths is found in the Taittiriya Upanishad explicitly. And of 2 truths in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, explicitly.

Such a conclusion is only unnatural and mischievous because the Upanishads have predated Buddhistic schools. Buddha was known to have rebelled against the veda of which the Upanishads are an inalienable part. .
