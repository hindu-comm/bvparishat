//Statement of one is enough to imply the other. //  
  
Not so. If one does not know what is the other.  
  
  
//Why? The words themselves speak out the concept clearly, unmistakably.//  
  
If VP is talking about 2 truths, and if advaita is borrowing the 2 truths from VP, one wonders why Shankara does not quote it in the context of the 2 truths doctrine.
