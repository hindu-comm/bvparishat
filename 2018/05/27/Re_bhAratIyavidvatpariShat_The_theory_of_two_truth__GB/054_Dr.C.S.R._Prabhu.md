General knowledge is that the Upanishads preceded Buddha by a large period.Therefore Advaita framework of the Upanishads preceded Buddha and ofcourse Nagarjuna.Buddha practised Yoga .He had Enlightenment through Yoga.His experience of Shunya is from Yogic states of Dhyana and Samadhi.Many persons experience Shunya state,where in the Chitra vrittis come to stand still.Nothing exists.The observer or the self does exist because that observer or self is experiencing the Shunya.This is the Drashta of Yoga :योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोघ तदाद्रष्टु स्वरूपे अवस्थानम् We all know that this self is the part of the Self.
