The Mandukya corpus contains yet another statement of the Paramarthika-vyavaharika pair:

  

  

This verse of the first chapter is held to be Gaudapada karika by Shankara and Rangaramanuja but as Upanishad by Madhva. The second half of the verse is cited by Vidyaranya as Mandukya shruti. So does the Vivekachudamani. 

  

प्रपञ्चो यदि विद्येत निवर्तेत न संशयः।  
मायामात्रमिदं द्वैतमद्वैतंपरमार्थतः॥ १७ ॥

  

The 7th mantra of the mandukya 'nantah prajnam.....' has the term 'avyavaharyam' thereby negating vyvaharaika and showing the Turiya as not something that is vyavaharika. Thus, this two-truth idea is already well established in the Mandukya corpus and does not require to be adapted from Buddhistic sources which have only borrowed it from the Vedic corpus.

  

There is no agreement within the Buddhistic schools/traditions as to what exactly is the meaning of the two-truth doctrine:

  

<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_truths_doctrine#CITEREFRenard2010>  

  

//The Buddhist doctrine of**the two truths**([Wylie](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wylie_transliteration "Wylie transliteration"):*bden pa gnyis*) differentiates between two levels of*[satya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya "Satya")*(Sanskrit), meaning[truth](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth "Truth")or "really existing" in the discourse of the[Buddha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha "Gautama Buddha"): the "conventional" or "provisional" (*saṁvṛti*) truth, and the "ultimate" (*paramārtha*) truth.^([\[1\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_truths_doctrine#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMatilal2002203-208-1))

**The exact meaning varies between the various Buddhist schools and traditions.** The best known interpretation is from the[Madhyamaka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhyamaka "Madhyamaka")school of[Mahāyāna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAST "IAST")Buddhism, whose founder was[Nagarjuna](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagarjuna "Nagarjuna"),^([\[1\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_truths_doctrine#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMatilal2002203-208-1))For Nagarjuna, the two truths are*epistemological truths*. The phenomenal world is accorded a provisional existence. The character of the phenomenal world is declared to be neither real nor unreal, but logically indeterminable. Ultimately, phenomena are empty (*sunyata*) of an inherent self or essence, but exist[depending on other phenomena](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prat%C4%ABtyasamutp%C4%81da "Pratītyasamutpāda")(*Pratītyasamutpāda*).^([\[1\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_truths_doctrine#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMatilal2002203-208-1))

In Chinese Buddhism, the[Madhyamaka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhyamaka "Madhyamaka")position is accepted and the two truths refer to two*ontological truths*. Reality exists of two levels, a relative level and an absolute level.^([\[2\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_truths_doctrine#cite_note-FOOTNOTELai200311-2))Based on their understanding of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra, the Chinese supposed that the teaching of the Buddha-nature was, as stated by that sutra, the final Buddhist teaching, **and that there is an essential truth above sunyata and the two truths.^([\[3\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_truths_doctrine#cite_note-FOOTNOTELai2003-3))**

The*śūnyatā*doctrine is an attempt to show that it is neither proper nor strictly justifiable to regard any metaphysical system as absolutely valid. It doesn't lead to nihilism but strikes a middle course between excessive naivete and excessive scepticism. //

Thus there is confusion and therefore no finality, within the Buddhist schools about the meaning of the concept. This also shows that this idea is not of the Buddhist but that which already existed from time immemorial in the Veda. The idea of Atman that the Buddha is famous for having denied is surely of the Upanishads. Surely, the Vedanta is not a nairatmyavada. This also shows that the Paramarthika Satyam of the Vedanta is the Atman aka Brahman. And the vyavaharika is anatman. The Chandogya, Brihadaranyaka and all Upanishads are about this atma anatma discourse alone.
