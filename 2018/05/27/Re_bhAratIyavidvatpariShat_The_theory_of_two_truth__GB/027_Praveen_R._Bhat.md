Could you show me where I said all? Could you also tell me whether or not it is accepted as per you that Buddha rejected Vedas. Or did he reject it without studying Vedas, which includes Upanishads? Or would you rather say that he studied karmakANDa and rejected the same, but did not study Vedanta and we therefore, do not know if he knew what is stated there about two realities or not, let alone accept or reject it?

The absence of proof is \*not\* proof of absence. A writ not found doesn't a mean a writ non-existent, then it would really be too far to say that words also didn't exist as transmitted in karNasampradAya in the tradition. Is there karNasampradAya in Buddhism also that they predate Upanishads!

I suggest you look up Wiki that AFAIK you consider as a very authentic source of learning. To lead, it records so: Pratityasamutpada (Sanskrit: प्रतीत्यसमुत्पाद) consists of two terms: pratitya: "having depended";\[3\] it appears in various Vedas and Upanishads, such as hymns 4.5.14, 7.68.6 of the Rigveda and 19.49.8 of Atharvaveda, in the sense of "confirmation, dependence, acknowledge origin".\[4\]\[5\]

  

I rest my case.

One doesn't need to since it has already been done by Purvamimamsakas (PM). Kindly search online for details, but a simple fact is that when no one claims authorship in a karNasampradAya, there is no author. When it is established against none other an opponent than Buddhist, the latter claims his work also to be apaurusheya, to which the PM says that now its not easy to claim so after claiming authorship! This is where your example of pratityasamutpada also lands. Either its traced in Vedas when it stops becoming original or its original when its not apaurusheya and therefore flawed.

Sorry, you're putting the cart before the horse. You can't use an unproven claim as proof to refute. Moreover, Buddhists also use the mantra asat eva idam agre asIt in one argument toprove shUnyavAda. Are they referring to an idea non-existent in Upanishads? In fact, Upanishads anticipate entire shUnyavada as a possible misunderstanding and reject it in that very mantra and following.

Maybe, but close is not same.



 And wherever Bhashyakara says "ours", it is not "his", it is what Upanishad talks of. Just because Karikarakara and Bhashyakara use the words same as those philosophers to refute them as they are gaining strength against Vaidika dharma, it doesn't mean that we borrowed from them.
