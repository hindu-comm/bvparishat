You are welcome to believe that Nagarjuna forged his theories. From my perspective, the doctrine of 2 truths was first expounded by Nagarjuna. Advaitins borrowed from him but they don't like to acknowledge that. In this context, it is interesting to note that advaitins have been accused of being disguised Buddhists right from the time of Bhaskara. Of course, we seldom find theives acknowledging that they have stolen.  
  
  
I have nothing else to say on the topic. The article from Stanford gives the rich history of 2 truths doctrine in India, long before advaita came into the picture.
