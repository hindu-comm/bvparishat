Sri Kalyan-ji,

  

Why this comment of Sankara about Buddha? There are numerous such comments by the adherents of one of the Dhaarmic traditions against the other and one 'Hindu' tradition against the other.

  

This did not stop HH Sri Dalai Lama-ji from having intensely cordial relationship with HH Sri Kanchi Periyava and vice versa. I can show you numerous instances of cordial relationships among different Dhaarmic traditions and among various 'Hindu' traditions a very big number of theoretical differences not withstanding.

  

Coming to the *section* of western Indologists conspiring to create a wedge, that is not specifically in this context. It is in the context of several other cases of historiography of ideas. Even if you don't agree the scholars themselves are very clear about their agenda. There is *a much bigger section* of western Indologists who are aware of the agenda of their colleagues and are trying to counter their efforts whenever and wherever possible.

  

So please don't expect that anyone is going to say, " Sankara never said this. " . Sankara and other pratipakshins of all the Indic traditions have said many things in khaNDana of all their pratipaksha Indic traditions.

  

That is what the indic intellectual tradition all about. That is not any quarrel.
