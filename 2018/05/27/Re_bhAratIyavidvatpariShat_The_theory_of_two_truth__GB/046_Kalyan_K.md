//What is wrong with that? An author can be seen to annotate/reproduce verbatim a passage.//  
  
  
Shankara does not identify it as Shruti because he knows too well that it is karika. Somebody later lifted it and created a bogus Sruti.  
  
  
  
//Even gaudapada, while giving the pot space example, does not say that it is from a Sruti.  

  
Why should he state that when it is already known to be there?//  
  

Gaudapada does not state because there was no Sruti at his time that talks of pot space example. Some advaitin wanted to give a greater legitimacy to advaita and created a bogus Sruti by lifting his verses.  
  
  
//For Advaitins if there is no contradiction, taking it as a shruti is not diminishing the power of a karika. That is why Shankara himself has called Gaudapada a 'sampradayavit Acharya.' Acharya vaak is veda vaak. //  
  
You are practically admitting here that Gaudapada faked some Srutis.  
  
  
  
  
//When VP is talking about 2 truths, and when it is lifting it from the Upanishads, one wonders why Nagarjuna does not quote the source. //  
  
  
Nagarjuna does not need to quote a source as this is his original doctrine. He is not lifting it from anybody, unlike the advaitins.  
  
  
  
//For vaidikas, there is no need for a 'universal' acceptance. That is why nastikas are kept out of this. It is well known that Nagarjuna being of a recent origin, his words from the Mandukya is a clear give away. //  
  
  
If Nagarjuna was of recent origin, then Shankara was born yesterday.
