//Could you show me where I said all? Could you also tell me whether or not it is accepted as per you that Buddha rejected Vedas. Or did he reject it without studying Vedas, which includes Upanishads? Or would you rather say that he studied karmakANDa and rejected the same, but did not study Vedanta and we therefore, do not know if he knew what is stated there about two realities or not, let alone accept or reject it?//  
  
Namaste Sri Praveenji  
  
Buddha rejected vedic rituals and superiority of brahmins. Whether he studied any upanishads, I dont know. He did not accept Atman.  
  
  
  
//The absence of proof is \*not\* proof of absence.//  
  
By this logic, there were atom bombs in the vedic age.  
  
  
  
  
  
//I suggest you look up Wiki that AFAIK you consider as a very authentic source of learning. To lead, it records so: Pratityasamutpada (Sanskrit: प्रतीत्यसमुत्पाद) consists of two terms: pratitya: "having depended";\[3\] it appears in various Vedas and Upanishads, such as hymns 4.5.14, 7.68.6 of the Rigveda and 19.49.8 of Atharvaveda, in the sense of "confirmation, dependence, acknowledge origin".\[4\]\[5\]  
  
I rest my case.//  
  
  
The wiki is not telling that buddhist doctrine of PS is from vedic literature. Rather it is bringing out the meanings of pratitya and samutpada as present in vedas.  
  
  
  
  
//One doesn't need to since it has already been done by Purvamimamsakas (PM). Kindly search online for details, but a simple fact is that when no one claims authorship in a karNasampradAya, there is no author.//  
  
Great logic sir. How can any literature have no authors?  
  
//Either its traced in Vedas when it stops becoming original or its original when its not apaurusheya and therefore flawed.//  
  
By what logic can you say it is flawed if it is original?  
  
  
  
  
//Sorry, you're putting the cart before the horse. You can't use an unproven claim as proof to refute. Moreover, Buddhists also use the mantra asat eva idam agre asIt in one argument to prove shUnyavAda. //  
  
shUnya and asat are different.  
  
  
  
  
//We have a practically direct admission from Shankara himself in the Mandukya bhashya that his doctrine is very close to Buddhism.  
Maybe, but close is not same. //  
  
  
Thanks for acknowledging that Buddhism and advaita are close. We have no differences here.
