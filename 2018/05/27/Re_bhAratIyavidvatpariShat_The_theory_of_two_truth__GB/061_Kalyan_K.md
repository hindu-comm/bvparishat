//There is a conspiracy particularly among some western Indologists nowadays to create a wedge between Buddhists and 'Hindus' by tracing many things found in Hinduism, in Buddhism.//  
  
  
From what I have seen, Western Indologists seem to be the favorite punching bags for everything in this forum.  
  
Shankara, after acknowledging that his doctrine is close to Buddhism in the Mandukya commentary, has the following uncharitable remarks against Buddha in BSB 2.2.32 -  
  
<http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbe34/sbe34208.htm>  
  
//....Moreover, Buddha by propounding the three mutually contradictory systems, teaching respectively the reality of the external world, the reality of ideas only, and general nothingness, has himself made it clear either that he was a man given to make incoherent assertions, or else that hatred of all beings induced him to propound absurd doctrines by accepting which they would become thoroughly confused.--So that--and this the SÃ»tra means to indicate--Buddha's doctrine has to be entirely disregarded by all those who have a regard for their own happiness.//  
  
  
Perhaps, Shankara never said this. Perhaps this is also a conspiracy by western indologists. Certainly, western indologists seem to be working overtime to drive a "wedge" between Hindus and Buddhists.
