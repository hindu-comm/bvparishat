The Kathashruti is also cited by Shankara in the Br.Up. bhashya for sannyasa. Swami Madhvananda gives the reference for that passage as Kathashruti/Katharudra upanishad. There is no rule that Shankara should cite all the Upanishads in the bhashya. One Jabala Upanishad that Shankara refers is for absolute identity but that passage is not found in the extant Jabala which has several other passages Shankara cites for sannyasa, etc. That gives room for a thinking that there could be another Upanishad by that name, perhaps that is the one the above opinion refers to.
