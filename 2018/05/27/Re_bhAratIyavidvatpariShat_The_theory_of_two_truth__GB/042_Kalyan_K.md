//If you do not know, you cannot say that he and his followers didn't borrow from Upanishads so unequivocally; thanks for accepting the same. //  
  
Namaste Sri Praveenji  
  
I never remember saying the above. I am only saying that advaitins have lifted from nagarjuna, the 2 truths theory.  
  
  
//Your argument would have made sense if I had said that absence of proof means proof of presence! //  
  
  
Then what is the proof that all upanishads were there by the time of Buddha.  
  
  
//The Upanishads talk of dependent origination all the time.//  
  
Why then did Shankara interpret them as sat kArya vAda?  
  
  
// Almost everything in Buddhism is borrowed from Vedas with corrupted Sanskrit words and here you are claiming that Advaita Vedanta borrows from Buddhism!//  
  
You need to provide evidence for your claim just as I showed how MMK talks about 2 truths.  
  
  
//Thanks, its called anyathAnupapattiH. Vedas are the breath of Ishvara as per the mantra. I will take your sarcasm as an objection worth considering as soon as you explain as to how you or someone is the author of your breath.//  
  
  
I am sorry. I asked you to prove apaurusheyatva and you are avoiding the topic. I am not concerned about breath and health. Please show vedas are apaurusheya.  
  
  
  
  
  
//In short, just by being a human produce, it is flawed.//  
  
Not everything produced by humans is flawed.  
  
// Pls study what apaurusheya is if you are truly interested. श्रद्धावाल्ँलभते ज्ञानम्।//  
  
So apaurusheyatva depends on shraddha. This must be a peculiar apaurusheyatva.  
  
  
  
  
  
//shUnya and asat are different.  
By what understanding of the word sat and the na\~nj meanings? In other words, please explain as to why none of the six meanings of na\~nj prefix to sat cannot mean shUnya.//  
  
  
asat is non-existence. Shunya is lack of essence.  
  
  
//For one, "maybe" doesn't mean acceptance. For another, 2 levels being close definitely doesn't mean shUnya and pUrNa are the same; they are 180 degrees apart.//  
  
Advaita = madhyamika buddhism - shunya + nirguna brahman  
  
In other words, advaita is same as madhyamika buddhism, with shunya replaced by brahman.
