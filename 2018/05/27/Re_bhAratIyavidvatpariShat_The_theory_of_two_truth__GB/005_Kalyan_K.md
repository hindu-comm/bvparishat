//The idea of 'borrowed from Buddhism' will not sustainable, as it has been thus far, until and unless a pre-Buddhist and pre-Nagarjuna non-advaitic Upanishad bhashya is examined for this idea. This is the only scientific method of arriving at the truth of such a theory. //  
  
  
Given that most upanishads except 3 or 4 are themselves post-Buddhistic, it is unlikely you will find any pre-Buddhistic commentaries of upanishads. Even if such a commentary is found, one has to investigate which school it belongs to and also date it. Given that no doctrine of 2 truths is found in the 10 main upanishads, and given the rich history of 2 truths doctrine in the buddhistic schools which pre-date advaita by a long period, the natural conclusion is that advaita borrowed this doctrine from buddhists.
