//It would be fair to assume that Nagarjuna studied Buddha's works at the very least. It begs a question as to what exactly did Buddha study? It is well-known at least in the sampradAya that he studied Vedas, including Upanishads.//  
  
Can you tell me which buddhist sources say that the Buddha studied all the upanishads? Sure, there were 3 or 4 upanishads which are unanimously considered pre-Buddhistic. But to say that all upanishads are pre-Buddhistic is stretching things too far.  
  
//Its a different matter that he used all that he thought as useful, rejected the rest with ardha-jarati nyAya, and then his followers sold it as their own with a twist of shUnya instead of infinity!//  
  
  
One of the original doctrines of the Buddha is pratItya samutpAda. Now, can you show me any vedic work which is pre-Buddhistic and also talks about this concept?  
  
// They have beyond doubt also established apaurusheyatva of Vedas, again, including Upanishads.//  
  
Can you please tell me how you can establish apaurusheyatva of vedic literature?  
  
  
// And if that still be the argument, I would respond then that Nagarjuna's is also an interpretation of the Upanishad mantras from where he sourced the idea, directly or indirectly, without giving due credit.//  
  
When upanishads themselves dont contain 2 truths, how could Nagarjuna have obtained this from the upanishads.  
  
  
//On a related note, if neither Buddhists nor Advaita Vedantins think that they talk of the same thing...//  
  
  
We have a practically direct admission from Shankara himself in the Mandukya bhashya that his doctrine is very close to Buddhism.
