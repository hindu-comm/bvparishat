This cannot be proved unless the pre-included version is produced as 'original'.

Not necessary. He sees them as natural parts of the Upanishads, not deserving any special reference. In any case, the 'borrowed from Buddhism' theory can sustain only if a pre-buddhist, pre-nagarjuna non-advaitic bhashyam for the Taittiriya, etc. Upanishads are examined.
Until this happens the theory does not hold any water. There is ample proof for the 'long history' of the paramartha-vyavahara in Upanishads that are the source for the Buddhists for the two-truth doctrine. It is they who have borrowed it from the Upanishads.
