//The Kathashruti is also cited by Shankara in the Br.Up. bhashya for sannyasa. Swami Madhvananda gives the reference for that passage as Kathashruti/Katharudra upanishad.//  
  
All one can find is one alleged quotation from all the supposedly strongly advaitic upanishads? Compare with literally thousands of quotations from the 10 principal upanishads.  
  
  
// There is no rule that Shankara should cite all the Upanishads in the bhashya.//  
  
  
There may not be such a rule, but expectation is that he would quote them if they are strongly advaitic.
