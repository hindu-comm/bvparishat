// Scholarship after 1950 suggests that almost all Sannyasa Upanishads have a strong Advaita Vedanta outlook.\[269\]\[270\]\[271\] Six of these Sannyasa Upanishads – Aruni, Kundika, Kathashruti, Paramahamsa, Jabala and Brahma – were composed before the 3rd-century CE, likely in the centuries before or after the start of the common era, states Sprockhoff; the Asrama Upanishad is dated to the 3rd-century.\[272\]\[273\]//  
  
  
If this is the case why does Shankara not comment on these upanishads and does not quote them, except for a few instances of Jabala? After all, if there is any upanishad that strongly supports advaita and is pre-Shankara, then one expects Shankara would quote them. Why is he not quoting them?
