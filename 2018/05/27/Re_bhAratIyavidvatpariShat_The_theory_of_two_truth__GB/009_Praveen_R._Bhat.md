Namaste,

  

It would be fair to assume that Nagarjuna studied Buddha's works at the very least. It begs a question as to what exactly did Buddha study? It is well-known at least in the sampradAya that he studied Vedas, including Upanishads. Its a different matter that he used all that he thought as useful, rejected the rest with ardha-jarati nyAya, and then his followers sold it as their own with a twist of shUnya instead of infinity! So to say that there were barely any Upanishads before Buddha is ridiculous. In writ, maybe so.Further, the Purvamimamsakas that Buddhists opposed have called a lot of the Upanishad content as arthavAda. They have beyond doubt also established apaurusheyatva of Vedas, again, including Upanishads. Why is it that we should take that karmakANDa existed but Upanishads did not! Such a nonsensical argument was never made by the then Purvamimamsakas even, who could have had a strong argument otherwise to say that such an Upanishad itself doesn't exist!

  

Its easy to say that whatever is said in the Upanishads is open to interpretation and the mantra itself doesn't say it. That can only be an incomplete picture of the Vedas from someone outside the sAmpradAyika fold, who perhaps doesn't have a clue of what tAtparyaniShchaya is. And if that still be the argument, I would respond then that Nagarjuna's is also an interpretation of the Upanishad mantras from where he sourced the idea, directly or indirectly, without giving due credit.

  

On a related note, if neither Buddhists nor Advaita Vedantins think that they talk of the same thing, I always wonder what is the compulsion of AV opponents who seem to know neither Buddhism nor AV to keep asserting that both are same! Both Bhagavan Gaudapadacharya in Mandukyakarika and Bhashyakara in Brahmasutrabhashya have rejected that Buddhists say the same thing.

  

Kind rgds,
