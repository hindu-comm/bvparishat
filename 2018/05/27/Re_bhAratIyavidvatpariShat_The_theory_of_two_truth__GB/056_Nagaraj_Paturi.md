"X exists for analytical purposes but it does not exist in the ultimate understanding" is found in Bhartrihari 's Vaakyapadeeyam. Pada, Varna etc. exist for analytical purposes. But in the ultimate analysis, they do not exist. Only Vaakyaartha exists in the ultimate understanding- is his theory.

  

Pada exists for vyavahaara. But it does not exist in the ultimate understanding. Only vaakyaarha exists in ultimate understanding.

  

This understanding in VP is absolutely independent of Buddhism.
