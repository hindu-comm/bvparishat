The Chadogya talks of 'satya' as distinct from the manifestations. The Paramarthika is also a satya alone and not anything else. The Taittiriya talks explicitly of three satyas: two with the name satya and the third with the name anrta.

There is no rebellion here; Shvetaketu did not know the Atman even theoretically because of his inattentiveness when it was taught in the Gurukulam. Even Narada for that matter, in the Chandogya 7th chapter, had studied the Veda but did not know the Atman as direct realization.
He came to Sanatkumara with the view to know it. In normal veda adhyayana itself a brahmachari in the gurukulam is exposed to the Atman/Brahman knowledge. It is up to him to take it forward by proper nididhyasana to realize it. So, these are not any instances of denigration of the Veda. In fact there is a Niruktastatement: If someone has not grasped the essence of the Veda even after studying it, he is only an inert pillar: *स्थाणुरयं भारहारः*किलाभूत् अधीत्य वेदं न विजानाति योऽर्थम्। योऽर्थज्ञ इत्सकलं भद्रमश्नुते नाकमेति ज्ञानविधूतपाप्मा ॥ १-६-१८ ॥ sthāṇurayaṃ bhārahāraḥ kilābhūt adhītya vedaṃ na vijānāti yo'rtham । yo'rthajña itsakalaṃ bhadramaśnute nākameti jñānavidhūtapāpmā ॥
