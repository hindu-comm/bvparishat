Any system which believes in moksha and rebirth tied to karmic concepts how can it distinguish between soul/atman/"breath of life" and God?  
  
The article below that you linked also has no quotation that attributes two truths explicitly to Buddh himself.  
  
Later interpreters then becomes a case of experts colliding with each other and how seriously one takes them is matter of personal preference.
