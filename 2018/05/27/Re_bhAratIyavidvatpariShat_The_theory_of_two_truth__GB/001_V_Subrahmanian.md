Very correctly stated, Sri Shivraj, one cannot agree more. Actually those who propounded the 'borrowed from Buddhism' theory are non-Vedantins who have no in depth study of the Vedanta. They are those who believe that Upanishads/Vedas are composed over a period of time and hence have the 'old-later Upanishads' idea. This is inimical to the vaidikas. Hence, the asampradayavit idea is to be rejected as that of a murkha.

  

The method, unscientific at that, they have adopted is: compare if the 'vyavaharika-paramarthika' idea is contained in post-Shankara non-advaitic commentaries and conclude on the  'borrowed from Buddhism' theory.

  

Shankara cites (at the end of the 4th Brahmasutra bhashya) three verses from a purvacharya whom later researchers have identified as a Sundara Pandya. Not much is known about this author except that he has also written something on purva mimamsa.

  

अपि चाहुः — ‘गौणमिथ्यात्मनोऽसत्त्वेपुत्रदेहादिबाधनात्। *सद्ब्रह्मात्माहमित्येवं* बोधे कार्यं कथं भवेत् ॥ अन्वेष्टव्यात्मविज्ञानात्प्राक्प्रमातृत्वमात्मनः। अन्विष्टः स्यात्प्रमातैव पाप्मदोषादिवर्जितः ॥ देहात्मप्रत्ययो यद्वत्प्रमाणत्वेन कल्पितः। *लौकिकं तद्वदेवेदं प्रमाणं त्वाऽऽत्मनिश्चयात्*’ इति ॥ ४ ॥\[The last highlighted portion means: the vyavaharika is pramana till such time Atman-knowledge arises.\]  

  

Actually these verses contain the vyavaharika-paramarthika and Shankara does not appeal to any Buddhist work for this but a purvacharya, a Vedantin. This is evident by the use of the word Sat Brahma and the verses clearly brings out the Vedantic Aham Brahma realization.

  

The idea of 'borrowed from Buddhism' will not sustainable, as it has been thus far, until and unless a pre-Buddhist and pre-Nagarjuna non-advaitic Upanishad bhashya is examined for this idea. This is the only scientific method of arriving at the truth of such a theory. Anything other than this method will be only specuIation. In fact the Nagarjuna factor is also not sustainable since there are Shankara MaTha-s who hold a BCE date for Shankara. Surely they do not hold the Upanishad bhashyas are post-Nagarjuna. So, the Nagarjuna factor is a weak plea altogether.

  

Here are some observations of various people:

  

//In Madhyamaka the two truths are two*epistemological truths*: two different ways to look at reality.// This is not so in Advaita.

//Scholarship after 1950 suggests that almost all[Sannyasa Upanishads](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sannyasa#Sannyasa_Upanishads "Sannyasa")have a strong Advaita Vedanta outlook.^([\[269\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOlivelle199217-18-295)[\[270\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta#cite_note-296)[\[271\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta#cite_note-297))Six of these Sannyasa Upanishads – Aruni, Kundika, Kathashruti, Paramahamsa, Jabala and Brahma – were composed before the 3rd-century CE, likely in the centuries before or after the start of the common era, states Sprockhoff; the Asrama Upanishad is dated to the 3rd-century.^([\[272\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOlivelle1992x-xi,_8-18-298)[\[273\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta#cite_note-299))

The strong Advaita Vedanta views in these ancient texts may be, states[Patrick Olivelle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Olivelle "Patrick Olivelle"), because major Hindu monasteries of this period (early 1st millennium CE) belonged to the Advaita Vedanta tradition.^([\[269\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOlivelle199217-18-295)//)

^(//Vedantists and Buddhists have been fully aware of the gulf between their doctrines, a gulf that cannot be bridged over.//)

//Gaudapada adopted some Buddhist terminology and borrowed its doctrines to his Vedantic goals,*much like early Buddhism adopted Upanishadic terminology and borrowed its doctrines to Buddhist goals;*both used pre-existing concepts and ideas to convey new meanings.^([\[478\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPlott2000285%E2%80%93288-542)[\[451\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta#cite_note-FOOTNOTEComans200088%E2%80%9393-511))*While there is shared terminology, the Advaita doctrines of Gaudapada and Buddhism are fundamentally different.^([\[295\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta#cite_note-trvmurti114-325)[\[487\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPotter198181-552)//)*  

^(//According to Sarma, "to mistake him \[Gaudapada\] to be a hidden or open Buddhist is absurd".^([\[485\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta#cite_note-FOOTNOTESarma2007145-147-550))The doctrines of Gaudapada and Buddhism are totally opposed, states Murti:^([\[295\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta#cite_note-trvmurti114-325)//))

//Scholars are divided on the historical influence of Advaita Vedanta. Some Indologists state that it is one of the most studied Hindu philosophy and the most influential schools of classical Indian thought.^([\[380\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta#cite_note-FOOTNOTEIndich200057%E2%80%9360-425)[\[21\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFowler2002240-243-23)[\[381\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBrannigan200919-426))Advaita Vedanta, states[Eliot Deutsch](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliot_Deutsch "Eliot Deutsch"), "has been and continues to be the most widely accepted system of thought among philosophers in India, and it is, we believe, one of the greatest philosophical achievements to be found in the East or the West".^([\[382\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta#cite_note-427)//)  

^(In fact even Bhaskara, who first criticised Shankara as 'pracchanna bauddha' (before Ramanuja), himself accepts the two-truth theory. For him bheda in samsara is real and abheda in moksha is also real. Shankara has refuted)

^(admitting two truths. All systems that teach moksha accept a samsara state that is due to ajnana and a moksha state that is free from ajnana. Naturally, then, the moksha/liberated state is the true state of the jiva and the samsaric)

^(state is not his true state. This is an inevitable conclusion that all mokshavadins have to admit. This is what Shankara stated in the Brihadaranyaka Bhashya:)
