You have nothing to show a sruti as bogus. There is nothing in that sruti to be not-a-sruti. It expounds a vibrant doctrine.

How do you know? The very Amritabindu Upanishad from which he has cited the na nirodho verse has this analogy. Moreover, an analogy need not come only from the sruti. Sruti is using logic to make known things. The one with Tarka shastra jnana is familiar with the space-upadhi analogy. None can prove the non-existence of that shruti.

For someone who cannot accept apaurusheyatva, all shrutis, the 10 which Shankara commented upon, are all faked ones. No different from that. There cannot be any 'original' shruti. Such is the lot of those who date the shruti.

The proof is so glaring. Nagarjuna needs to acknowledge the source of his theory. One who reads his verses can quickly see the fraud.

``` Mahendravarman in his work 'mattavilAsaprahasanam' says this about the coming into being of the Buddhistic system: ```

//Taking material from the UpaniShads and also from the MahAbhArata (which includes the BhagavadgItA), Buddha, even as the brAhmaNa-s (vaidika-s) were wide awake, accomplished a great fortune - literally filled up his coffers - (of establishing a vibrant system).//

  

Buddhism = Brahmavada + shunya - Brahman.

  

  

Vidyaranya in the Panchadashi has stated this.

That does not make the Shruti a publication after Nagarjuna. He already had the Shruti corpus from which he lifted all that he wanted to forge a theory. That is the only way he could make people believe he was giving something different from the Vedanta.
