//Gaudapada in the Karika 2.32:  

  
न निरोधो न चोत्पत्तिर्न बद्धो न च साधकः ।  
न मुमुक्षुर्न वै मुक्त इत्येषा परमार्थता ॥ ३२ ॥  
  
\[Many would think this is a composition of Gaudapada, but the entire verse is available in the above Upanishad.\]  
  
Another verse from that Upanishad (cited below) is found in the Gaudapada Karika 3rd chapter with the same analogy: jiva = pot space, body = pot:  
  
घटसंवृतमाकाशं नीयमाने घटे यथा ।  

घटो नीयेत नाकाशं तथा जीवो नभोपमः ॥ १३ ॥ //  
  
  
These seem to be actually compositions of Gaudapada, which are later included in the upanishad.  
  
If this upanishad existed in its current form before Shankara and if it strongly supports advaita, one wonders why it is not often quoted. If Shankara wanted support on 2 truths, he could have simply quoted this upanishad, but he does not do so.
