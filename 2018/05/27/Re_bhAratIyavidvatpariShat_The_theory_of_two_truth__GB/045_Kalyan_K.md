Dear Sri Praveen  
  
This discussion is not going anywhere.  
  
  
I will end it with a few points-  
  
1. MMK chapter 24 of nagarjuna is the first exposition of 2 truths, which was about 500 or 600 years before Shankara.  
  
2. It is ok to have respect for tradition, but to believe in aparusheyatva in this age is ...let us say...out of the ordinary.
