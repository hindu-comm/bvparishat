//There is no rebellion here; Shvetaketu did not know the Atman even theoretically because of his inattentiveness when it was taught in the Gurukulam. Even Narada for that matter, in the Chandogya 7th chapter, had studied the Veda but did not know the Atman as direct realization. //  
  
  
Now, one cant say that Narada is also inattentive.
