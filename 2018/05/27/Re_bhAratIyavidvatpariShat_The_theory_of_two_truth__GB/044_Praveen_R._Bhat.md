You keep asking for proof, but you have yourself given no proof. So by what proof have Advaitins lifted from Nagarjuna? You yourself have accepted that you do not know whether Buddha studied Upanishads. Then proof from your side is impossible.

To me the proof is sampradAya. Just like you don't have any trust in sampradAya, I do not have any trust in any of the scholars you may refer to.

To show mithyAtva. What is ultimately real for others need not be so in Upanishads itself.

Sorry, I need to do nothing of the sort. You have provided evidence for nothing. Based on someone talking of something you can't make a claim that other has borrowed.

Neither is this the topic of this thread to ask proof of it nor is the onus on me to prove the same already proven by PMs. I can't keep establishing everything already established by the living tradition. I've just hinted you with leads. To you breath and health are same! I am right in the middle of the topic that you think I am avoiding!If you do not understand the argument of breath that since breath is not created by the person whose breath it is, Vedas which are the breath are not created, I can't help you.I have asked you to look up Purvamimamsakas establishing the same.Else create another thread and ask for help understanding the same.

Even one flawed work is sufficient to be doubtful. Else you would have believed the "human-created (as per you)" sampradAya instead of doubting it.

What an unrelated jump from "one who has shraddhA gains knowledge" to "aparusheyatva depends on shraddhA"! To clarify, I meant: have shraddhA in sampradAya and study as to how apaurusheyatva is established. Even science and logic needs you to have shraddhA in the teacher. That doesn't mean "so science and logic depend on shraddhA".

Unexplained and therefore, unestablished assertion. My question as to why asat cannot mean shUnya has been avoided.

 Unproven. It could also very much mean Madhyamika = AV - nirguNa brahma. One need not even add shUnya since shUnya is lack of nirguNabrahma which itself is the essence.  


> In other words, advaita is same as madhyamika buddhism, with shunya > replaced by brahman.  

Using such statements, one can prove in one's own mind that anything is anything else! That is like saying: in other words, emptiness is really fullness, one just has to replace zero with infinity! By your own translation, shUnya is lack of essence while brahman is hopefully still infinite.
