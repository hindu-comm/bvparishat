Apart from the Upanishads, the idea of 'vyavahara-paramartha' is found in many Puranas and the Mahabharata too:

  

The Mahabharata:

  

``` 12211011c पुरुषावस्थमव्यक्तं परमार्थं निबोधयत् 12211012a इष्टिसत्रेण संसिद्धो भूयश्च तपसा मुनिः 12211012c क्षेत्रक्षेत्रज्ञयोर्व्यक्तिं बुबुधे देवदर्शनः 12211013a यत्तदेकाक्षरं ब्रह्म नानारूपं प्रदृश्यते ```

  

  

  

The Vishnupuranam too has the terms 'paramartha' 'vyavahara' in
abundance. This Purana has been cited in dozens by Ramanuja. No one holds that this is a purana influenced by buddhism!

Sridhara Swamin's commentary brings out the Advaitic purport.

  

सद्भाव एवं भवतो मयोक्तो ज्ञानं यथा सत्यमस्तयत्यमन्यत् ।

एतत्तु *यत्संव्यवहारभूतं* तत्रापि चोक्तं भुवनाश्रितं ते ॥ २,१२.४५ ॥

  

पुराणसंहिताकर्त भवान्वत्स भविष्यति ।

*देवतापारमार्थ्यं* च यथावद्वेत्स्यते भवान् ॥ १,१.२६ ॥

ज्ञानस्वरूपमत्यन्तनिर्मलं *परमार्थतः* ।  

तमेवार्थस्वरूपेण *भ्रान्तिदर्शनतः* स्थितम् ॥ १,२.६ ॥

*परमार्थस्त्व*मेवैको नान्योस्ति जगतः पते ।  

तवैष महिमा येन व्याप्तमेतच्चराचरम् ॥ १,४.३८ ॥

रूपं गन्धो मनो बुद्धिरात्मा कालस्तथा गुणाः ।  

एतेषां *परमार्थश्च* सर्वमेतत्त्वमच्युत ॥ १,१९.६९ ॥

श्रीपराशर उवाच

इतीरितस्तेन स राजस्तत्याज भेदं *परमार्थदृष्टिः* ।

स चापि जातिस्मरणाप्तबोधस्तत्रैव जन्मन्यपवर्गमाप ॥ २,१६.२४ ॥

The above is only a sample.

  

The Garuda purana too has this pair: vyavaharika-paramarthika:

No one holds this as an influence of Buddhism!!

  

6\. Now hear, O Bird, the two-fold nature of the body of man. One is Vyāvahārika, and the second Pāramārthika.

[](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-garuda-purana-2/d/doc63656.html#page-147 "Click to link Page 147")47-52. On the Vyāvahārika there are thirty-five millions of hairs of the body, seven hundred thousands of hairs of the head, it is said, and twenty nails;

There are said to be thirty-two teeth usually, O son of Vinatā; the flesh is said to be one thousand*palās*^([\[19\]](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-garuda-purana-2/d/doc63656.html#note-e-40182 "Pala is a little more than an ounce (6/5 oz.)"))and blood one hundred*palās*;

Fat is ten*palās*; skin is seven*palās*, marrow is twelve*palās*; the "great blood" is three palas;

Seed is known to be two*kuḍavas*; ovum one*kuḍava*; and bones in the body are said to be three hundred and sixty;

The*nāḍīs*, both dense and subtle, number tens of million; bile is fifty*palās*; phlegm is half of that;

The waste materials are not measurable, as they are constantly changing. The body which possesses these attributes is Vyāvahārika.^([\[20\]](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-garuda-purana-2/d/doc63656.html#note-e-40183 "Individual and common physical body."))

53\. All the worlds, mountains, continents, oceans, suns and planets are in the Pāramārthika^([\[21\]](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-garuda-purana-2/d/doc63656.html#note-e-40184 "Universal and spiritual body."))body.

54\. In the Pāramārthika body, there are six chakras in which are said to be located the attributes of the egg of Brahmā.

  

The Chandogya 'mrittiketyeva satyam' is brought out by the Vishnu Purana too:

कटकमुकुटकर्णिकादिभेदैः कनकमभेदमपीष्यते यथैकम्।

As the cause of the origin and destruction, the Lord is sarvAtma and therefore is the controller of all. The analogy is: The various ornaments such as bangle, crown, earrings, etc. the effects named so. They are but transformations of gold that is one alone, …

सुरपशुमनुजादिकल्पनाभिर्हरिः अखिलाभिरुदीर्यते तथैकः॥ ३,७.१६ ॥

So too by the imagined disctinctions, which are mere names, such as gods, animals and humans, One Hari alone is articulated. The verse itself uses the word ‘kalpana’ to indicate that the different entities and the differences among them is a mere kalpana. Hari alone is spoken of variously as gods, humans, etc.

\[The Chandogya Shruti ‘वाचारम्भणं विकारो नामधेयम्, मृत्तिकेत्येव सत्यम्’ is what is meant here. The shruti teaches that the transformations of gold, clay, etc. are mere names and the truth in them is the material cause. So too the entities such as gods, animals and humans are mere names and they are essentially Hari, Brahman, alone. In other words, difference across various ornaments, various entities such as gods, humans and animals, is due to maya, ignorance. The truth is the material cause, Brahman.\]

क्षितितलपरमाणवोनिलान्ते पुनरुपयान्ति यथैकतां धरित्र्याः।

सुरपशुमनुजादयस्तथान्ते गुणकलषेण सनातनेन तेन॥ ३,७.१७ ॥

Further, since bheda, difference, is maayika, when the maya, ignorance, is gone, Hari alone remains. Gods, humans and animals are only manifestations of gunas. When gunas subside, one becomes one with Vishnu.
