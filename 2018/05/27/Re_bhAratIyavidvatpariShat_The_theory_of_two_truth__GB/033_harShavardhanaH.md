Yes, Sri Subrahmanian, I agree with your assessment.

  

In my view, the two truths theory comes from the two viewpoints of the ultimate, the Brahmatattva. (Here, of course, the Buddhist position does not apply, as they do not admit of a atma, let alone paramatma. This is a different discussion.)

  

Basically, in its original form, the two truths is the dualist and monoist position. While I disagree with Sri Samkara on some points in his Brahmasutrabhashya, I readily accept that the vedantic position is entirely based on the Upanishads, which mostly advance the monoist position (sarvam khalvidam brahma - Chhāndogya) but also do not dismiss the dualist position (Chhandogya 6th chap., Katha, Svetashvatara, Taittiriya etc).

  

We must synthesize and harmonize.
