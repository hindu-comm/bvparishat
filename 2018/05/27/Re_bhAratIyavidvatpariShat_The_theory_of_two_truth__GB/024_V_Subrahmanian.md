What you say in the last para is very true. Even Advaita never claims it is a new system. So too dvaita and Vishishtadvaita. All hold that they are only bringing out what is in the Upanishads. So to think that Advaita came later than Buddhism is only incorrect understanding of the philosophy.

  

Advaita accepts Sankhya as very close to Vedanta:

  

विवर्तवादस्यपूर्वभूमिः वेदान्तवादे परिणामवादः ।  
व्यवस्थितेऽस्मिन् परिणामवादे स्वयं समायाति विवर्तवादः ॥  
  
I think it is from the SankshepashAreeraka.  
  
\[The doctrine of transformation (Sankhya) is the one that just precedes the doctrine of transfiguration (vivarta) of the Vedanta. Once the former is well grasped, the latter falls in place by itself.\]  

  

Shankara holds the Sankhya as the chief opponent; Buddhism is only an opponent as a nastika mata. Yet Shankara has a word of praise for the Sankhya for their contribution that is non-contradictory to the Vedanta. परमतम् अप्रतिषिद्धम् अनुमतं भवति is Shankara's statement. That way alone he is appreciative of the Bauddha too when it comes to their statements on vairagya and their holding the world to be only consciousness (momentary). Shankara accepts non-contradictory aspects of Nyaya-vaisheshika, Yoga, Pancharatra too. For Shankara all these schools, including Jaina and Charvaka are dvaitins.
