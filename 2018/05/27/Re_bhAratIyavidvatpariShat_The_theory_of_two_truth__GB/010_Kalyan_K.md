//The doctrine of 3 truths is found in the Taittiriya Upanishad explicitly. And of 2 truths in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, explicitly.//  
  
No such doctrine is found. Of course, if one superimposes buddhistic theory of 2 truths on the upanishads, then that is a different case. But it is still buddhistic superimposition only.
