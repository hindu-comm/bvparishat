The question is not  
whether later interpreters have done anything new. The  
question is - where is the doctrine of 2 truths originally  
from? The answer is - it is from Buddhism and propounded by  
Nagarjuna. Other schools like advaita, have merely borrowed  
this concept.

The page you linked from stanford has this statement:  
"Contemporary scholarship suggests that the Buddha himself may not have made any explicit reference to the two truths. "  
  
Do you have a reference that Buddh propounded the two truths?
