There are instances where Shankara has not identified certain passages as 'shruti'. For instance the other verse of this very Amritabindu Upanishad that he cites in the BSB, he simply says 'moksha shastra'.
And while citing Gaudapada in the BSB twice, he refers to him as 'sampradayavit acharya.' It is only when we search such verses that we find the source.
