This discussion seems to be suffering from a case of post-hoc fallacy. The works of advaita vedAnta, based on the ones available today, historically occur after mAdhyamaka Buddhism, therefore where the two are similar, the former must have borrowed from the latter.

  

An interesting counterpoint can be found in the work mAdhyamakahridaya by Bhavya, a sixth century mAdhyamaka buddhist. Prof VV Gokhale in a paper titled "The Vedanta-Philosophy described by Bhavya in his Madhyamakahrdaya" (Indo-Iranian Journal, Vol. 2, No. 3, 1958) presents a description of Vedanta (pre-Sankaran) that was available during Bhavya's time. He also refers to a situation where the mahAyAna school is criticised as being similar to vedAnta. In reply, Bhavya generously says that whatever is good in the upaniShads has also been taught by the Buddha.

  

In one of the chapters of the Madhyamakahridaya dealing with the hInayAna objections to mahAyAna, the hInayAna-buddhist criticises the mahAyAna buddhist saying;

न बुद्धोक्तिर्महायानंसूत्रान्तादावसंग्रहात् \|

मार्गान्तरोपदेषात् वा यथा वेदान्तदर्शनम् \|\|

The mAhAyAna teaching was not spoken of by the Buddha, either because it is not included in the sUtrAntas, or because like the vedAnta darshana, it teaches heretic paths to salvation.

  

To this attack, the mahAyAnist replies

वेदान्ते च हि यत् सूक्तम् तत् सर्वं बुद्धभाषितम् \|

दृष्टान्तन्यूनता तस्मात् संदिग्धं वा परीक्ष्यताम् \|\|  

Whatever is well said in the vedAnta (upaniShads) has been taught by the Buddha. The various examples cited by the hInayAna are faulty and what is doubtful must be examined.  

  

Here is an example of pre-Sankaran Buddhist work where the opponent criticises the mahAyAna school as being similar to vedAnta! The reply of the mahAyAna buddhist is even more remarkable - there is a concession that the best elements of the upaniShads have been taught by the Buddha himself.

  

To argue that advaita borrowed from Buddhism, or Buddhism borrowed from advaita is missing the larger point - the two schools are similar in many respects, but different too.Similarity does not imply that one created and the other borrowed, nor does difference imply the absolute absence of common ground.
