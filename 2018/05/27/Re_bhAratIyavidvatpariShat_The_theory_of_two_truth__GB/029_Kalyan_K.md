//The Mandukya corpus contains yet another statement of the Paramarthika-vyavaharika pair:  
  
  
This verse of the first chapter is held to be Gaudapada karika by Shankara and Rangaramanuja but as Upanishad by Madhva. The second half of the verse is cited by Vidyaranya as Mandukya shruti. So does the Vivekachudamani. //  
  
If advaitins hold the verse to be karika, then how can you argue it is Sruti?
