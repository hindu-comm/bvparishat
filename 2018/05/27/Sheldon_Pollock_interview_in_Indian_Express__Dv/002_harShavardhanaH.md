Sri Subramanian, thank you for bringing this to the forum's notice. I have stopped reading newspapers, so such interviews and reports as these often bypass my notice.

  

Some observations:

  

> **1. I’m a target because I’m an outsider who dares to speak about the > inside.**



It seems to me that this is so much fibbing. There are two aspects here: One, is the rising Indian sentiment that is not as meekly admiring of westerners as in the days of western dominance. This counter-current is making the work of unscholarly scholars/agenda-based people somewhat arduous. Two, this is dismissive of the fact that Indians have been remarkably accepting and permissive of outsiders. Sub-continental history is a testimony to this fact. Indians have unreservedly accepted 'the other', but if the other persists in maintaining an 'other identity' and making a point of maintaining it, then fault-lines will arise. It is but natural. If I accept you, and you don't accept me, then I will conclude that you, the outsider, do not, perhaps, want to be an insider.

  

Further, one doesn't need to be an outsider in order to criticize. The insider too, like a brother or a mother, can criticize. Then the criticism will be all the more powerful and well-meaning because it comes from one who has accepted us as his own.

  

> 2\. **One can’t speak of the glories of India without talking about > the miseries of caste and vice-versa.**

  

This is disingenuous. The glories of India are not predicated upon the misery of its people. The pinning or hyphenating of India's glory with the caste system is not scholarly - it is agenda driven. Partly, this comes from culture. Some westerns are unable to imagine a case where somebody has prospered without first killing or looting someone. That has been their entire history. America is established on the decimation of the native Americans and the usurping of their lands. The British empire was one giant octopus that sucked the vitality of its territories through its tentacles and transferred all that to the head. But India has never sought to prosper by standing on the throats of others, as Swami Vivekananda put it so well. Would then such as country as India oppress its own people? The very idea is preposterous. This comes from a wrong understanding of the caste system.

  

The caste system has become a convenient beating stick with which to 'put the Indian in his place.' I beg to differ. That atrocities were committed by the privileged against the socially weak is documented and proven in India. But that comes from a period when the system had decayed and morphed, where men abused it as a means of gaining power over others. But the caste system, per se, ain't bad. In fact, I think there was real merit in the caste system. It was a practical mechanism for balancing and harmonising the ambitions of the individual with the objectives of the collective. It was the original socialist idea, the earliest commonweal experiment, that neither sacrificed the individual at the altar of the state, nor allowed the individual to ride roughshod over the collective. If we look at the extremes of socialism/communism and capitalism in the world today, we will realize that the unchecked state/community is as undesirable as the individual's unbridled free will.

  

Looking at the caste system through jaundiced eyes and then castigating Indians is manifestly unfair.

A classicist has to know what place a classic holds in the minds and hearts of the local people. I can't believe that Pollock studied all of the Ramayana, the context of the Ramayana, and the place of the Ramayana in India, and yet failed to realize that Indians hold it in high regard as a living itihasa. His essay in the wake of the Babri Masjid demolition was an enunciation of his original position, a position that he still holds but is now downplaying. Pls note I am not saying that he is not supposed to have an opinion (he is free to hold to any opinion). I am only saying that his work as a classicist needs to be divorced from his opinions. Or, his opinions need not and should not inform his work. I don't know to what extent this has happened.

  

kind regards

Harsha
