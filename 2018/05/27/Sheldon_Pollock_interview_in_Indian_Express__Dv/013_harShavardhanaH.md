Adding to my prev post, let us look at English to understand its popularity in India. Despite it being the language of our conquerors, owing to internal linguistic tensions, we have appointed English as a medium of communication that is equally foreign to everyone and hence equally objectionable/unobjectionable to everyone. With its past momentum as the official language of the British Raj working in its favour, none objected to its continuation. Of course, has the constitutent assembly voted to adopt Samksrita as the official language instead of Hindi, the situation would have been different, but this is again a matter of conjecture. (I personally am sad that skewed demographics defeated a fine opportunity for the resurgence of official patronage to Samskrita.)

  

The biggest thing going in English's favour is its being the global language of science and technology. This is the age of science. Science and tech is driving commerce, science and tech is driving administration, science and tech is driving instruction in schools and colleges. It is the language of the skies (for pilots), it is the language of the internet, it is the language of the present (daily work) and the language of the future (it is one poised to be a world language, soon).

  

By the same token, the biggest thing going against Samksrita is its NOT being the language of commerce and the language of science and technology. it is mostly seen as the language of the past, not the present, let alone the future. Further, a language is studied not primarily for its intrinsic beauty but because of what it speaks of. Today, English speaks of science and technology, while Samskrita speaks of philosophy and literature. The future vs the past. The choice for the youth of today is stark and apparent.

  

English is consuming Samskrita. Should we fight a losing battle? I don't know. I seek guidance.
