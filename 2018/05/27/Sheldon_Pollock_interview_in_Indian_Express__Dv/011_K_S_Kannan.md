The *stuti*-*pAThaka*-s of Pollock have already described him as  

"The Last Sanskrit Pundit". So how can there be any other scholar?  

Perfectly understandable.  
  

The main agenda of the colonialists was just this:  

To so well destroy the well-established and profoundly successful indigenous system of cultivating Sanskrit,  

that Indians will have to learn Sanskrit and the *sAstra*-s from the West,  

along with the interpretations they impose on them.  
  

They first took control of the origins and details of Indian history,  

and next the textual criticism,  

and then the interpretation of Sanskrit texts.
