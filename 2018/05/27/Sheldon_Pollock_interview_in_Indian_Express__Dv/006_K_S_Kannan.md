Pollock is only playing the victim card ("Oh I belong to \<this> group, that's why I'm targetted")

\- so well mastered by the followers of the Peaceful Religion (Peace Be Upon Them All)  
(and the Monopolisers of Mercy, and the Ring-leaders of the Lowest Rung).

  

In the Swadeshi Indology (SI) Conferences that I organised, (with the full support of Rajiv Malhotra) much more than three dozen scholars (including Dr RGanesh and Dr. Shankara Rajaraman) lashed out at the malignant scholarship of Pollock & Co.: and their papers are all available at the SI Website for all to see, and over half a dozen volumes are being published in book form under my editorship. Pollock toning down to some extent in the aforesaid interview is a result also of this backlash. In a small monograph of a hundred pages on the Ramayana, Manjushree Hegde, my student, has delineated and detonated the academic hypocrisies of Pollock in a manner and scale none has attempted or succeeded so far. (Will be shortly made available).  

  

There are virtually hundreds of scholars in the Western Indology fold whose vitiating views need to be confronted.While lack of a sound knowledge of English has unfortunately disabled many of our Pandits from giving a fitting response, what must be realised is that there is no mechanism now of producing sound and strong indigenous scholarship on a substantial scale in our country regarding our heritage, especially after the murder of the *gurukula* system, thanks to Ram Mohan Roy, Macaulay and the Nehru dynasty. Leave alone the lay, most of our scholars even in our universities are just ignorant of what the West is doing us, as their journals are not easily accessible or are terribly costly for us. The West, on the other hand, has an excellent institutional mechanism (for a continuous offensive on all other heritages, in its bid to impose its own universalism everywhere): job opportunities/university curricula/libraries/journals/conferences/funding etc.  
  
We should in fact attract the best of talents for studying our vast heritage, some of whom also study the Western heritage well and are capable of evaluating them from the Indian viewpoint: in the ongoing academic warfare too, "offense becomes the best form of defence".  
  

A realisation is slowly dawning upon a small section of our youth in this regard (but there still are many who mutter and assure us: Macaulays and Pollocks come and go, but our samskrti is eternal and will survive even if **we do nothing**; God will take care!"): can we still say all is well with the land of the Veda-s, the land of Panini, the land of Sankara, or the land of Caitanya? The best of bestowals and bequests can get ransacked and ruined in the absence of apposite vigilance and diligence.  
  

A decent academic infrastructure and a drastic revision of some governmental policies will go a long way in helping our cause: an inspiring atmosphere to spirited students of our heritage is indeed a great desideratum.
