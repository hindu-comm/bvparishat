Namaste

  

1\. Dr.Pollock has made clear position statement; where the following
text part is worth reading ‘ letter-by-letter’:

Quote

philologists, I read texts*aksharabyakshara*, day after day, year after year. Are there people like that in India anymore who could read those texts? **If there are no such people in India today, then Sanskrit is in big trouble.**

  

Unquote



The article also mentions living senior scholars across India who seem to have facilitated shaping of thoughts and constructions for Pollock from an outsider perspective.

  

It would be high-time to get the scholars named in the article to come on board and give their inputs. Here say and sidelined tangential observations do not help.

  

As the report reads, the battle: Sanskrit is in the phase where nothing
is sacred!

A response need to me made to the observation reading-‘There may be people here that I might not know of. I was fortunate as a student. **The kind of Indian scholarship I read as abaccha,included S Dasgupta, V Raghavan, PV Kane.** From my little blinkered position, **I don’t see that level of scholarship anymore. All you hear is making spoken Sanskrit the national language and people who can’t read a single line in Sanskrit attacking those who spend their whole lives working on it.’**

**  
**

**Here is another point needing attention from report ! When it comes to American Education,**nothing is sacred here except for questioning. This is on ‘ chair controversy’- They wanted to name the professor, who had to be vegetarian and couldn’t drink alcohol. I said, ‘You cannot dictate. This would be a critical, historical scholarly position in a secular university.’( Cf: indian traditional scholars need to see the cultural and academic issues distinct and separate. When a traditional devout brahmana worships  Shiva chanting Rudram and Raavana kruta prayers, does the question of Ravana as Raakshasa with different kind of food habits bother the pooja?).

  

The other charge that needs serious refutation is on the following;**Because of the politics of culture in India today, all money coming from religious communities are becoming difficult for American universities to accept because there’s a growing sense that freedom of expression and inquiry will be compromised.**

**The colored lenses view of American Religion Universities can not promote the ‘ open thought truth seeking model , called Samskutha Shaastra Sampradaaya’. On the contrary, enough damage has been done by American Colonial model studies to drain the  ‘ Swa-Desha Bhaashaa -Sampradaaya -darshana-Shaastra’ in the constrictions of indology, anthropology, sociology, theology, philology and the like. American Religion universities have provided a sphere-head platform and drive using Religion- Theology- comparative religion studies-with history orientation to damage the universal welfare vision of Sanatana veda Dharma: Samskrutham is a multi level language with singular standard from a community specific ritual meditation prayer usage to the language of cosmos. The saint - peasant -soldier and philosopher speak one language . The believers and non- believers ( aastika) and naastika use the same language without the artificiality of Aryan dravidian divide and PIE historicity.**

  

**True , Samskrutham of Paninian vedanga standard needs to be restored globally from the rut of ‘indology- india language study - spoken sanskrit’!**

**  
**

**Team members welcome for making this happen beyond making battle cries!**
