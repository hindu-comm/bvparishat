I wrote on another list the following during the discussion on the same interview:

  

RM brings out very well this art of Pollock :making his views look reaspnable, strike a cord with a section of Indians, while trapping them into his cunning arguments.

  

He has been harping on this you don't study your languages , partocularly your classical literatures argument from many years. Why you need to come to us is because I syudy what you don't- is the actual message.

  

Do all English speaking people study their literature? Do we tell the English speaking nations. I so and so English professor dedicated my life to study English literature. Choosing English literatire for study by Englidh speaking students is fast dwindling. Do English speakers then say, yes, he dedicated his life to our literature, so he is justified in demonising our language and literature?

  

With regard to his observations on Kannada,

  

there are two important points his interview hides:

  

1\. There is a huge classical Kannada scholarship still intact. It doesn't exist for him because

they don't go to him offering help

they don't publish in English

they are not referred to, by his informant 'professors'

  

2\. If there is decreasing classical Kannada studies by youngsters, it is because of demonising classical Indian literatutes by the left liberals who support and get sipported by Pollocks.

  

Is it not irritating to see those who created the sad state, shed crocodile tears at the same state of affairs?
