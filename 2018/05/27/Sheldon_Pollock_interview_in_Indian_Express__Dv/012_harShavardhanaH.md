Sri Misra ji, thank you for bringing this fact to light. But isn't it substantially true that owing to institutional inadequacies and govt apathy as also lack of job prospects, the study of samskrita is declining in India? The cream of Indian youth is certainly not taking up its study, and with this vital supply of fresh blood cut off, it's only a matter of time before Pollock's hurried prophecy about the death of Samskrita comes finally true.

  

As Sri Kannan has indicated, remedial measures have to be taken on a war footing. But how? At best, Samskrita study in the current economic climate can remain only a passion or a hobby for the majority of Indians. Its use in daily discourse being practically non-existent, I am not sanguine about the future.
