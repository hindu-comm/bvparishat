Pollock says he looked up DU and JNU websites and called his friends but could not come up with a single person in Delhi who could teach Sanskrit for a year (apart from Ram Karan Sharma). This is just unbelievable. Have Pollock and his friends not even heard of[G](https://www.facebook.com/girishnjha?fref=mentions)irish Nath Jha, Heeraman Tiwari, Balram Shukla, Parmanand Jha, Jeevan Sharma, Govind Prasad Sharma, Baldevanand Sagar, etc. These scholars between them have published many books, poetry, articles, and even worked on machine translation for Sanskrit. The commentary by Govind Prasad Sharma on the Laghusiddhantakaumudi is one of the best I have come across. This is just a small set of people I know rather well or have read thoroughly, I am sure there are many more Sanskrit scholars in Delhi who one can read with for a year.

  

It is more likely that because these scholars are not ideologically on the same page, Pollock and his friends do not consider them as worthy enough. This is so textbook liberal. Ananya Vajpeyi, one of Pollock's *mukharavirudavali* singers, lives right in New Delhi. And she is unaware of all these scholars?

The narrative is blatantly political: there are no Sanskrit scholars worth reading under in Delhi (or India), and so Pollock and his coterie are the sole cross-bearers of Sanskrit today.

PS: It only takes a few mouse clicks to locate hundreds of Sanskrit scholars in Delhi by searching digitally through the Inventory of Sanskrit Scholars, available online as a PDF.
