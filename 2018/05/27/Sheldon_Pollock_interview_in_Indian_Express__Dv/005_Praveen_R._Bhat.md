The very idea that he was trained by Indian scholars when there was "more casteism", if that, is clear that he was never a target. Unfortunately others, if not him, who were also trained took undue advantage and did an irreversible damage to India and its culture. In hindsight, it would have been better to keep outsiders as outsiders!

Its a misfortune that even many insiders who criticize wear outsiders' shoes and make it a biased criticism. An honest insider criticism is rare.

It is indeed unfair and, shockingly, an unrelated opening statement! It sets the ground for his further accusations.

This is the issue of losing the sight of the forest for the trees. He has read "akShara by akShara" without understanding what all those akSharas put-together really mean!! You can't make an outsider who wants to remain an outsider even when trained by an insider.

  

Further, I notice:

  

He says he never talks of religion, but he has made an anti-religious statement nonetheless without using the word Hinduism. "Because of the politics of culture in India today" is a very leading political statement. Does three year JNU Sanskrit course lead to people "making havans"? Whoever calls a person with a Sanskrit degree to officiate havans! There is such a gross inaccuracy in that statement unacceptable from a scholar that he presents himself to be. It perhaps purposeful to make a statement that a scholar trained in Universities is beyond pujaris who are trained in traditional maThs. The comment on "nuclear secrets" is beyond ridiculous. To a person steeped in Sanskrit to question if there are any Sanskrit scholars who can teach as well as before is surprising. With that rhetoric, he should himself take students, why send to India!
