I fully agree with what Harshavardhanji has commented on Pollock's interview. One thing is very clear right from the day I heard Rajivji's interpretation of Pollock'es design in the 1st SI conference at IIT Chennai that Dr. Pollock has a political design. He has been providing strength under the disguise of Sanskrit scholarship to the leftists and socialists to create social unrest in India.  
To meet such challenges we need to thoroughly revise Sanskrit education policy of our country. Rationality must prevail over emotionality.  
  
Prof. Kannan , you are doing a great job. My best wishes for that.
