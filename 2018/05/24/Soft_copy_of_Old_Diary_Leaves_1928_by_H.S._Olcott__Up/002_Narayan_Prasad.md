Sir,

 Thanks for your response.

 The link given by you refers to the 1895 edition. The materials I want to get (details about Gunanada, champion of Sinhalese Buddhism) is available in the 1928 edition.

 Some details about him are available in "Sketches of Ceylon and India" (1878) by Ivan Minayev (in Russian). I am translating this book into English.
