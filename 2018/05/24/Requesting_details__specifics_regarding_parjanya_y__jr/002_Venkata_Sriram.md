It is all in the power of mantras and the person who chants it. Nothing scientific about these. I can recall one and only one person shri uppuluri Ganapathi Sastry ji who did varuna yaga during the times of PVRK Prasad garu in TTD. Tirupati reservoir went dry. During those tough times, Sastry ji performed varuna yaga with varuna pasha prayoga. There was a huge downpour in Tirumala and not a drop in surrounding areas. The devatas are under the control of brahmins (mantra siddhas). Let us not associate cloud seeding and other fancies with the mantra prayoga. Yes, a vaidika purusha who is siddha knows the viniyoga part of mantra shastra which works with grace of Ishwara.

Regs,  
Sriram
