This cloud seeding technique is good as a theory. From scientific p.o.v. scientific community has moved from this.

My Chemistry prof was the one who did this for TN govt during early 2K in Chennai. He is one of the foremost proposers of this idea.

He himself has declared it as practically nonviable during several conversations.

  

Mixing Science and Vedas doesn't work out for statement. Veda is a different process altogether, which will help in achieving a goal. It has its own syntaxes, semantics and rules to translate a desire to achievement.

  

Everything has to be tried to achieve, so the question of asking "wasting public money" is unscientific. Science requires so much resource and effort. Some call it as a wastage.

Until we try and improve on the existing result, goal cant be achieved. This is the fundamental thought of a researcher in Science.

  

Further Science doesn't equate to "not wasting public money" (imagine where decision making is wrong in a step in algorithm). Neither the so called "Not so Science thinking" also doesn't equate to wasting public money.

  

Coming to the point:

  

As far as yajna is concerned, as someone earlier said. The result of rain is based on the mantras and the recitor (Tapas/Mantra Siddhi/Anushtana). This is the correct reasoning.

I have personally heard students and elders telling how my great grand father who was a Principle investigator/Adhyapaka at Travancoe Kingdomss Patashala. He used to cure one side headache and other health ailments of the last Travancore king through mrutyanja japa and rig veda mantra recitation.

  

There is nothing scientific here. He attained the mantra siddhi through Tapas, anushtana, achara, etc... at young age. Reverred scholars say, through the steps mentioned in Vedas and Sastras one can satisfy the devata (Devata Priethi). It is something similar to process orientation in Engineering industry.

  

I have been taught some vedic mantras. And definitely I cant do what he did. Because, I lack in Tapas and spending time.
