Sir,

  

As far as my limited knowledge goes, there is mention of a Kamya Isti called कारीरी in the Vedas which is prescribed for one who wishes for rains.

कारीर्या वृष्टिकामो यजेत (Maitrayaniya Samhita 2.4.8). Taittiriya Samhita 2.4.7-10 describes it with Mantras and Brahmanas.

  

Havis is prepared with Karira (करीरः = वंशांकुरः, the shoot of a bamboo) and Kharjura (Dates) pounded with honey. They are mixed on an antelope skin.

Scholars say Karira is a fruit bearing bush. It is also said that Kariras are connected to Soma.

  

The Adhikari is Raja or Purohita. The performer of Kariristi is prohibited from consuming Karira for a year.

The Yajamana, Patni and the Rtviks wear black garments with a black fringe. A black horse is kept standing in front of the Ahavaniya facing west.

These are symbolic of black cloud formation and for causing Parjanya to quicken the rains.

  

Oblations are offered to Vayu, the 4 quarters and 4 intermediate quarters. Three purodasas are made and offered to Agni Dhamachhad, Maruts and Surya.

  

An earthen pot is made out of unbakedblackishclay and filled with water. If it breaks rain is assured.

  

Please refer to other Samhitas, Brahmanas, Srauta-sutras and Prayogas for further details.

  

Warm regards,

Ramanathan P S
