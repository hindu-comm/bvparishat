//Didn't it bear fruit ? As per data, yes.  

  
Now how one can prove it ?  
As a Computer Science researcher, there are two acceptable methods for any peer reviewed journals or call it research work.  
  
1. It can be through formal proofs (mathematical equations).  

2\. Empirical results. (Mathematical proofs are always considered highly acceptable)//  
  
  
We can prove it through techniques of Statistical inference. Deve Gowda's case is a single sample point and cannot be used for drawing any conclusions.
