In the light of this yagnya \<-> science confusion. I have a query, regarding Deve Gowda's yagya for political revival in Sringeri.

  

reference: <https://www.google.co.in/search?q=shatru+samhara+yagnya+sringeri+devegowda&oq=shatru+samhara+yagnya+sringeri+devegowda&aqs=chrome..69i57.9951j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8>  

  

Didn't it bear fruit ? As per data, yes.

  

Now how one can prove it ?

As a Computer Science researcher, there are two acceptable methods for any peer reviewed journals or call it research work.

  

1\. It can be through formal proofs (mathematical equations).

2\. Empirical results. (Mathematical proofs are always considered highly acceptable)

  

So, which way are we going to validate this case ?
