I only said that chanting this works for the chanter's headache.

Not others.

Not all diseases.

My claim is specific and personal.

And I have found even sustained OM chanting has helped. But it has to be done by the person suffering with headache.

  

It is a direct acoustics effect, and will help even someone who doesn't know anything about shiva or veda or mantra. Just chanting it with force will help, that is the science part.

  

I say this with all humbleness.

  

Karma gives fruits to the karmi  
  

  
Thanks,  
Shashikant
