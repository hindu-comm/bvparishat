Dear Sri Shashi  
  
//Mrityunjayaa mantra has a lot of humming sounds, which has direct acoustic effect on the skull and thus heals headaches. That is the science behind it. Instead of that mantra one may simply chant OM or even do bhramarii pranayam and get the results//  
  
  
One of my young and very close relatives was in hospital a few years back. Maha mrutyunjaya homam was done for his sake by learned pundits. It did not work and the person passed away. If there were a science behind it, I guess it should have worked.
