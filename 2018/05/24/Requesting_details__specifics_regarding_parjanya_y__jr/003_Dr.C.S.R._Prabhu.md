Cloud seeding is done with Silver Iodide being dumped in the Clouds by planes

Silver Iodide ions act as nuclei in the Clouds to result in precipitation.The same people stated that ground seeding of clouds by vapours also is possible by burning Silver Iodide .They also stated that burning certain type of herbs etc on the ground can possibly act equivalent to seeding of the Clouds. In Yajnas this posdibly happens in addition to temperature inversion in Clouds due to heat created in Yajnas.Many people could induce rains through Yajnas. Other aspects of Yajnas such as the effects of chanting of Mantras by individuals or groups cannot be commented upon due to lack of research. Reserach on the various effects of chanting Mantras is still not done ,as per my understanding.
