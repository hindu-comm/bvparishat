Mrityunjayaa mantra has a lot of humming sounds, which has direct acoustic effect on the skull and thus heals headaches. That is the science behind it. Instead of that mantra one may simply chant OM or even do bhramarii pranayam and get the results similar.

  

I have myself cured my headaches many times by saying this mantra. The science comes when it is the chanting with some force and not just mumbling it, or chanting in mind only. The acoustics have amazing and almost immediate effect on the skull.

  

That is not belittling the mantra.

  

Vedas are different than science and in realm of mystery - is very exotic statement. I think we may have lost the reasoning along the way, but that doesn't mean there was none.

  

I do understand the psychological effects of the belief, and that itself is the science there. Science means a systematic way, not necessarily hi tech lab. And vedic thought has been more scientific than most agree today.

  

I am fine to be content with parjanya yajna being a metaphor, with no hard science behind it. In which case, it is waste of public resources by the govt. And if there is indeed some hard facts to the yajna, I am curious to know.

  

Put simply, I am not insulting anything with my query, so please don't divert the topic. \*Folded hand emoji\*

  

I want to know if anyone knows the hard facts behind this yajna and it's efficacy. Not the anecdotal stuff. That is there for all to read in our ancient vangmaya.

  

Sorry for any misunderstanding due to my miscommunication.

  
Thanks,  
Shashikant
