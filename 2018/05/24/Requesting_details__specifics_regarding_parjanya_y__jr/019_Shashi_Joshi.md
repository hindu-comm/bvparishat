Also, mrityunjaya mantra for the extremely sick is not to revive their body, but to pray for easy departure.

  

No one can overcome death itself, but the fear of death can be possibly overcome. Even Rama and Krishna had to go from the mortal world, birth must be followed by death in this martyaloka.

  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
