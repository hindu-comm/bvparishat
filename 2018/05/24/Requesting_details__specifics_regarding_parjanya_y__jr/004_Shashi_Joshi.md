\>\>\> It is all in the power of mantras and the person who chants it.


I am looking for something more specific than 'it is all in the power of mantra'.

  

The questions then is - What is the power of the mantra? And why mantra has power?

Then why yajna fire has to be done?

etc etc

  

\>\>\> Nothing scientific about these.

If there is nothing scientific in it, then it is purely superstitious? Then why waste public resources in doing something today that will have no bearing in bringing down rains?

  

If someone asks how milk gets heated when put in a microwave, the layman answer could surely be 'It is all in the power of the box', but surely there is more to the heating of the food in the box.

  

I have all respect for our heritage and rishis, but I respectfully refuse to believe that there is true 'super natural' power and siddhi etc. These could be metaphors, mysteries, symbolic, and understanding them doesn't reduce them in any way. aNimA doesn't mean one's entire gross body could physically get as small as an atom.

  

They were all in the realm of the nature, physics.

Just like no one could have thought of super conductors, and if you were to see its application only, and not the theory, you would think it is magic.

TV is a magic, so is ATM, for layman who can't explain how exactly they work.

  

What I am genuinely seeking is, for example, what kind of offerings were made in a parjanya yajna? Do they have any relation to the chemistry involved in a cloud seeding?

  

\>\>\> Let us not associate cloud seeding and other fancies with the mantra prayoga  

Fancies?

Today aspects of weather are indeed controlled, by inducing chemistry artificially, that usually happens naturally. That is not fancy.

I didn't say the parjanya yajna is same as cloud seeding, but similar in results. And hence my query into the details of parjanya yajna.

  

Please don't dismiss with such authoritywhat are genuine quests for specific details, when your answer is simply 'it is all in the power of the mantra'.

  
  

Thanks,
