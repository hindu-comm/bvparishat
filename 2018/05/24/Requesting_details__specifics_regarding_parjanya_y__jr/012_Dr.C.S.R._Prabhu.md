The effects of any Vedic Technique like Chanting of the Veda or performance of a Yajna are supposed to act at three levels: Adhibhoutika,Adhidaivika and Adhyatmika. Present day Science is at best at Adhibhoutika Level.I suppose Mantra Sastra works at Adhidaivika level and Adhyatmika is the Spiritual level at the level of Self.The Mantra must be the subtle form of the Devatha or Force or Component of of Nature which also has a Gross or Adhibhiutika form.
