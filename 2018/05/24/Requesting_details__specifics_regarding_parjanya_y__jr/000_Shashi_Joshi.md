Respected members,

  

Today's news item says Gujarat govt to do many parjanya yajnas.

<https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarat-plans-41-yagna-in-33-dists-for-good-rains/articleshow/64296280.cms>

  

Similar yajnas have been done previously as well in many states.

  

I am interested to know if there are/were any specific scientific factors in these specific yajnas that helped rains, similar to maybe modern cloud-seeding efforts.

Since different yajnas had different procedures, maybe in the parjanya yajna there were some specific materials put in the agni that would have similar effect as cloud-seeding.

  

Any details/specifics of the parjanya yajna are also greatly appreciated.

  

I somehow believe that lot (if not most) of our traditional rituals had objective and scientific reasons that were shrouded with stories, spirituality etc to make people do it out of respect, awe, duty etc, and everyone need not know the dry details. Over time, maybe the dry details have been lost altogether, and these may seem like superstitions to modern audience.

  

Please do not read any other motive to my sincere question.

  

Namo namaH  
  

Thanks,
