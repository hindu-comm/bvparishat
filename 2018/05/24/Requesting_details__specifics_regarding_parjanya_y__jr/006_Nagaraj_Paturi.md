The reasoning can be from both sides:

  

If mantra and the supernatural competence of the priest or the team of priests do everything, not the materials used and the procedure followed, why all the details of the materials, why all the procedural prescriptions, why all the s'aastras such as s'ulba sootras, s'raouta sootras etc. ?

  

If everything is achieved by the materials used and the procedure followed, all the details of the materials, all the procedural prescriptions, all the s'aastras such as s'ulba sootras, s'raouta sootras etc., why mantras and the supernatural competence of the priest or the team of priests ?

But the question is, is there a yajna called parjanya yajna? Where is it mentioned and described?

  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

One Dr Sudars'an , an Aryasamaji, an employee of NIRD, Hyderabad, I heard, did his PhD (?) research on the cloud control with Yajna procedures. I heard that he brought rain to prove his thesis. I will collect the details and share.I heard that he brought rain to 'prove' his thesis.

  

  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

If acid rains, ashy rains, crude oil rains all caused by smokes are possible, theoretically fertlizer rains (through paushTika yajnas) and pesticidal rains (through s'aantika yajnas) must be possible through specific smokes created for the purpose.

Explanation of how a medicine works, does not make the medicine work. Proof of the pudding is in its eating.

  

-------------------------------------------

  

Explanation of how a medicine works can help find new medicines, understand do's and don'ts while the medicine is used etc.

  

But that explanation is not needed at the user level.

  

Thanks and regards,
