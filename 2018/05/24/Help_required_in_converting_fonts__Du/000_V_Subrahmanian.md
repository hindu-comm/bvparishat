](http://www.peterffreund.com/Vedic_Literature/Vedic%20Literature%20Unicode/Brahmana%20Loop/Upanishads/108%20Upanishads.txt)

  

Quite often I come across a search result showing on the face the words/line/sentence/verse I am searching for, but when I click open there what I find is garbage. Is there a readymade solution to this?
Why do some pages appear so?

  

  

Thanks.
