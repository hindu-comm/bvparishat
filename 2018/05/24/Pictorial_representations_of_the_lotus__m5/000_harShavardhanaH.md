Namaskar.

  

The lotus holds a prominent place in Indian art, and is a significant element of yogic visualization practices (dharana and dhyana).

  

In your studies and research works, have you come across any original pictorial representations of the "lotus(es)" that the practitioner (in hatha-yogic and tantric traditions) is required to meditate upon?

  

I see many images of the lotus flower floating around in the internet, and I have seen some artistic representations of lotuses (in various stages of flowering and forms) done by modern artists, but in my admittedly constrained search I have not seen any primary images of the "dhyana lotus" or the "chakra lotuses" as described in the original texts of yoga and tantra.

  

Apart from hatha-yogic texts, several texts (e.g. the saivagamas from Kashmir, and the saktagamas from Bengal), including the puranas(e.g, Kapila's advice to his mother, the Isvara Gita, etc), provide detailed wordy descriptions of visualizing a lotus in the heart etc and imagining the deitytherein for meditations. But pictorial representations are not present.

  

I would be grateful if scholars here could direct me to any original pictorial representations of the "lotus" as used for visualizations, or any suitable secondary sources.

  

with kind regards

Harsha
