They are too numerous, but I can give you the basic template which all of them follow:

  

Lotus(es) to be visualized/imagined, petals ranging from two or more to many, of specific (different) colours, with specific (different) root (bija) aksharas (in yogic tradition the pranava is used - split into "a", "u", and "ma") , with specific (different) deities located in the lotus(es), + in agamic texts associated with the specific bhutas (5 elements). In yogic texts the deity is the chosen ishtadevata, in agamic texts the deities are various gods and goddesses with specific (given) forms. The chakras range from 6 to 9 depending upon specific traditions, each one has an associated lotus for dhyana/dharana.
