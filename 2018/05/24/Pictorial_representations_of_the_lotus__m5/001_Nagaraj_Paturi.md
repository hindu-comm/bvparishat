\>"dhyana lotus" or the "chakra lotuses" as described in the original texts of yoga and tantra.

  

\> Apart from hatha-yogic texts, several texts (e.g. the saivagamas from Kashmir, and the saktagamas from Bengal), including the puranas(e.g, Kapila's advice to his mother, the Isvara Gita, etc), provide detailed wordy descriptions of visualizing a lotus in the heart etc and imagining the deitytherein for meditations  

  

Can you please quote the text so that discussion can be more precise and clear ?
