This is an interesting detail, Nagaraj garu, that I haven't come across in my studies so far. The "orientation" of the mental image or the "frame-of-reference" from which to "view" the mental image during visualization has been an ancillary point of doubt for me. Could you please direct me to or quote the textual sources reg this?

  

Thanks
