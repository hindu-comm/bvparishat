A related question may also be interesting. At what point does the imagery of lotus enter the religious literature? It is relatively rare in the pre-Epic pre-Puranic literature? Śrī-Sūkta reference to पद्मे स्थितां पद्मवर्णां तामिहोपह्वये श्रियम् is to my knowledge the earliest reference to lotus, and this Sūkta probably belongs to the relatively later stratum of the Rigveda.
