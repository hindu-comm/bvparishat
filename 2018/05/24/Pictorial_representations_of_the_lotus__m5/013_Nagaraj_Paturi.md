Sharing an example of numerous pictures where sahasraara alone is represented in the orientation parallel to floor and facing the sky, i.e. base towrds the floor and the lotus opening upwards , skywards.

  

Is it not weird that only sahasraara is in this orientation and all other chakras are in the orientation of base towards the bback of the individual and lotus opening towards the direction faced by the individual? These pictorial representations are not even 3d. They are just 2d.

  

Only if the orientation of the shatchakras are in the same orientation of sahasraara, then it is consistent.
