Most of the yantras have lotuses included in them.

  

Representation of varNas on the petals is also found in them.

  

These can be taken as saadhana related.

  

But when experienced inside the saadhaka, the lotuses , in the same shapes as in yantras are viewed as parallel to floor, facing the sky.
