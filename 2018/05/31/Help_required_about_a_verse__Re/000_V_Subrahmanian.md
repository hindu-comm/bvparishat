Namaste

  

Very long ago I had read a Sanskrit verse which means:

  

A person engaging in any vedic activity without having performed the basic Sandhya vandanam is akin to a man decorating himself with various ornaments without the basic clothing.

  

I can't recall the verse, even a single word there, nor do I remember the book I read this verse. Any help in locating the verse is appreciated.

  

Thanks
