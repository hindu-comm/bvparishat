A few months ago I had asked for the full verse of which the meaning is: a person doing vaidika karma without first doing the sandhya worship is akin to someone decorating himself with ornaments without the basic clothing. On searching something else, I came across this verse, cited by Sri Jayatirtha in the Nyayasudha:book_50e11e0978c3b.txt

  

वस्त्रहीनमलङ्कारं घृतहीनं तु भोजनम् ।भावहीनं तु सल्लापंन प्रशंसन्ति पण्डिताःऽ ॥

  

I vaguely remember the original verse which had used the first simile.
Yet the original verse is still eluding me.
