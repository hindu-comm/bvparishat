Namskar,

  

I am quite new to Samskrita poetry. I have interest (earlier latent, now made patent by Dr C Rajendran's notice that his sisupalavadha trans. is complete) in trying to learn more about them. To begin knowing about them, could the learned members here kindly recommend English translations of the mahākāvyas:

1.  Raghuvaṃśa by Kālidāsa  
2.  Kumārasambhava by Kālidāsa  
3.  Kirātārjunīya by Bharavi  
4.  Śiśupālavadha by Māgha  
5.  Naiśadhacarita by Sri Harṣha 6.  Bhaṭṭikāvya by Bhaṭṭi

Any guidance would be received with gratitude.

  

Harsha
