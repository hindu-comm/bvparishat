For the benefit of future searchers on this forum:

  

1 and 2 have been partially translated by M R Kale, whose bhartrhari shataka trans I am familiar with. His approach, though not very reader friendly is rigorous, and is preferable to me (a beginner) despite there being one or two western trans available. Avl on [archive.org](http://archive.org)

  

3 is apparently trans by R C Dutt, partly and freely I suppose, as part of a bigger work about poetry in ancient India. Avl on [archive.org](http://archive.org).

  

4 is recently trans by Dr CR as notified here. No update so far on akademi website.<http://sahitya-akademi.gov.in/sahitya-akademi/SASearchSystem/sauser/writerinfo.jsp?wrids=3743>

  

5 apparently doesn't have an eng trans

  

6 has been translated by many of which mlbd's ed. of the Karandikars seems to be procurable locally.

  

  

this is the result of a search by one who is not conversant with samskrita litt. (Suggest going thru C Kunhan Raja's survey of samksrita litt, which i'm doing now to gain a basic understanding)
