Translations of 3 by Indira Viswanathan Peterson and of 4 by Paul Dundas have recently been published in the Murty Classical Library. I have not read them, but I would expect both to have done good work. Peterson might possibly be expected to have more literary qualities in her translation, Dundas possibly more rigour. The Murty Classical Library books are attractively produced, and contain the Sanskrit text in Devanagari, with the translation on the facing page. They are probably not freely available as PDF online. Links to the publishers pages:
