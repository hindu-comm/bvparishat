My wife (Prof. Mrs. Ujjwala Jha, Former Director, Centre of Advanced Study in Sanskrit, University of Pune) and me taught entire Sankhyakarika word by word in English and the entire programme of two weeks are video-recorded and available for use. Please contact Mr. Mani A. Pulimood ([maniap...@gmail.com]()) and procure a set and see whether they are of any use to you.
