Thank you for this information sir.

  

I am unable to find any of Prof Pattanayak's publications or videos through a Google search and a YouTube search. Would you be so kind as to indicate the web links pls? Thank you.

  

Also, I found a general (introductory level) lecture by Sri Kuppa Vishwanatha Sastry on Samkhya in Telugu here:<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mOqK6p_DJ8>. (Starting from 12:56)
