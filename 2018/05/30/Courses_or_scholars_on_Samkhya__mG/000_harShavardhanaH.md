Namaskar

  

Are you aware of any courses that are being conducted on Samkhya philosophy? (Degree or traditional doesn't matter because my focus is on understanding only.) I don't see any Samkhya department or course in the current (samskrita) university systems.

  

On the same topic, are you aware of any traditional scholars who have made a study of Samkhya? There are a number of Vedanta scholars, but Samkhya is relatively rare.

  

I would appreciate any help or guidance on the issue.

  

kind regards

Harsha
