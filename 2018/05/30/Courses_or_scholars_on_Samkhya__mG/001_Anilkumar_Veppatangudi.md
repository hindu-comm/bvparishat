Kalpa Heritage Trust is exploring the possibility of bringing out a comprehensive volume on Samkhya with contributions from scholars well versed in various aspects of the philosophy of Samkhya. It is proposed to form a committee of scholars to assess, evaluate and select the contributions for final publication. We would like to get details of scholars who are willing to contribute articles as well as those who wish to be part of the selection panel. The language can be Sanskrit and/or English.

Hoping for a sizeable response at an early date.  

Regards,  

Dr.V.R.Anil Kumar
