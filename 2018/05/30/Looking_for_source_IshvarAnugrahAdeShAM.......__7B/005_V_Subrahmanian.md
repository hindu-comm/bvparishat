In retrospect I found the verse printed in the Sayanabhashya Anandashram series has this first paada:

  

*ईश्वरानुग्रहादेषां*....  

  

I think the 'एषाम्' - पुंसाम् connection, though valid, the
*ईश्वरानुग्रहादेषा in the feminine goes well with ...वासना . This gives me the feeling that the Anandashram Sayanabhashya printed version could be erroneous with the 'eShaam.' I request scholars to give their opinion on this.*

*regards*
