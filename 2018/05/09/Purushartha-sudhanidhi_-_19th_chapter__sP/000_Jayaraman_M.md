Namaste  
  

I am writing this mail on behalf of a PhD research scholar who is not part of BV parishat. I will ask the scholar to send a request to join this group.  
  

In the meanwhile, the student requires a translation or someone who could guide her in understanding the 19th chapter of Sayanacharya's purushartha sudhanidhi. That chapter is also called as Agastyagita.  
  

The content of the pdf file that the student forwarded to me looks difficult. The verses are terse and also there seems to be some textual corruption.  
  

I attach the first page of the text as a sample.  
  
If any respected scholar of this BV parishat can help the student
either by providing links to translations or by sparing time to read and teach it would be of great help.  
  

regards  

Jayaraman
