Namaste,

  

Purushartha Sudhanidhi has 4 skandhas. The 19th chapter mentioned in your post occurs in 4th Skandha i.e. Moksha Skandha. Purushartha Sudhanidhi is not an original work, it is a compilation of Puranic passages. 19th chapter of Mokshaskandha corresponds to chapters 51-53 of Varaha Purana. (Agastya Gita of Varaha Purana has 17 chapters out of which Sayanacharya included only first 3 chapters in his Purushartha Sudhinidhi). English translation of these chapters are available online at the link given below.
