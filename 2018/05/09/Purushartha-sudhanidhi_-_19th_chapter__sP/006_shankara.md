Jayaramanji,

  

I checked New Catalogus Catalogorum vol 1 available online. The entry on Agastyagita doesn't mention any Sanskrit commentaries on it. Giving below link to relevant page of NCC vol 1.

Dear Shri Shankara ji  
  
Thanks for the reply. Are there any commentaries in Samskritam to this text?
