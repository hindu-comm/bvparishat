Dear Scholar,As you may be aware,the Henry Martyn Institute is engaged in the Inter-faith Dialogue to bring about harmony across Faiths. As you know,philosophically all Religions teach the same or similar Principles of Common Essentials, such as Oneness, Universal Love, Brotherhood,various Moral Values and all the positive principles of Ethics (Dharma),Devotion, Discipline,Self Control, Meditation( all being different aspects of Yoga),Qualities such as Compassion ,Service,etc. In order to bring about Universal Love,not only mutual tolerance but mutual understanding and even mutual acceptance will be essential for achieving vibrant Harmony in the currenly divided Human Society . Therefore,to bring about Universal Understanding and Acceptance for the Welfare of the Human Society and thereby achieve World Peace, we need to come out explicitly with a Document that emphasizes on the Principles which are globally acceptable minumum Common Framework.Towards this goal,, a monograph is being proposed to be published by Henry Martyn Institute,Hyderabaf in this year 2018.In this important effort ,we identified you as a Contributor of a Chapter as we realised that you are a reputed scholar of your own esteemed Religion and its profound Philosophical thought.We hereby request you to author one Chapter of about 30-40 pages , along with due authoritative Scriptural References (with correct translation in English),explaining
how your own esteemed Religion and its venerated Philosophical thought highlighted and focussed on Universal Values and Common Essential Principles as above ,that can bring about a happy Human Society with mutual tolerance ,mutual understanding,and even Mutual acceptance across various Religions and their varying hues of Philosophical thought.

A line of confirmation of your acceptance will be appreciated.With kind regsrds-C.S.R.Prabhu
