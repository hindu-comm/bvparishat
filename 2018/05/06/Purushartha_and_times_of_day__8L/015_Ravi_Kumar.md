Hari Om

  

I am going to write a few words generally, not in response to or targetingany specific person. Pleaseunderstand the following words in this context.

  

We Indians are still squeamish about sex. For the longest time, I too was one such denier of kama. However, with advancing age, the realization of the centrality, power and ubiquity of sex came to me. That which is the very cause of our birth, that which every living being naturally, undeniably craves, cannot be a matter of shame or crudity. When there is Dharma to modulate our appetitesand the scriptures are available to guide our reason, there is no need to fear or avoid sex. Its an integral part of all life, a central motif of earthly existence. Accept it, understand it, control it. In fact, those tantra agamas with their rituals involving sex make a lot of sense to me now.

  

Having said this, the overall issue of whether pursuit of kama and moksha can be harmonized has already been answered in the Bhagavad Gita. **My original query pertains to the division of daily hours according to the targeted aim - *when to pursue what is the question, not whether.***

**

sincerely

ravi kumar
