In the above document (SB) word dharma is translated as "occupational  
duty" by Prabhupada for which he gives the following reason in  
commentary to a verse few verses before:  
  
We have purposely denoted dharma as occupation because the  
root meaning of the word dharma is "that which sustains one's  
existence."  
\>\> SB 1.2.7, commentary  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
