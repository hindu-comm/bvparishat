It seems strange to me that Mr.Ravi Kumar feels that Indians are squeamish about sex when Kama Sutra and Anangaranga are part of our literature and our temples depict sexual acts in full detail. Sex was considered a natural part of life. Whatever squeamishness is there has come along with the restraints prevailing in invading cultures and Victorian prudence. Kama is one of the goals in a a person's life and Purushartha is a most practical proposition especially when combined with the Ashrama system.
