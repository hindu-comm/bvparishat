Yes. Exactly. Actually trivargas are meant to be performed in harmony  
with, and simultaneously with apavarga not for sense-satisfaction.  
That is the thesis put forward by Bhagavatam in first chapter.  
  
Trivarga when performed for the purpose of tattva-jijnasa and not for  
sense-satisfaction it forms the part of maintaining body for the  
purpose of executing sadhana for salvation (moksa).  
  
This is also reflected in the famous verse "sarira madhyama khalu  
dharma sadhanam" -- if you see it from the light of moksa as the  
ultimate goal. Here sarira (senses and mind) is described as the means  
the end "dharma." (Also see ayurveda granthas -- sutra sthana)  
  
This also forms the theme of Vedanta-sutras. The first question is  
what is the aim of life? The answer is first sutra -- athato brahma  
jijnasa. And why brahma-jijnasa? Because by no other means one can get  
rid of all miseries in life epitomed by birth, death, old-age and  
disease. Thus aim of life should be to get moksa (liberation). Thus  
the body should be maintained for the purpose of executing sadhana for  
achieving liberation and for not sense-gratification.  
  
How can trivargas be performed simultaneously with apavarga?  
Bhagavad-gita is treatise elaborating on this subject -- acting in  
knowledge (especially chapters 3 to 5). The principles established  
therein are practically demonstrated by incidences recited in Srimad  
Bhagavatam -- for instance the life of Pandavas, King Prthu, etc.  
  
As Bhagavatam is natural commentary by Vyasa-deva to Vedanta-sutras  
(artho'yam brahma-sutranam) we find very parallel themes in it.
