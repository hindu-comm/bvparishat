I will answer in your language only ! Sex is prohibited during day time. This activity is only prescribed in night that too when wife is in ritu-dharma. There are specific days for maithuna as per dharma shastra. If followed this way, the grihastha is said to be following brahmacharya diksha. Bhagavan Ramachandra used to follow this which is mentioned in Ananda Ramayana.

  

Now, as Nagaraj Ji mentioned, there is no hourly classification for purusharthas. Daily nitya karmas should be performed which most of us know.

  

Also, there is a famous saying by elders as:

  

प्रातः द्यूत-प्रस्ङ्गेन,मध्याह्ने स्त्री-प्रसङ्गतः।रात्रौ चोर-प्रसङ्गेन कालो गच्छति धीमताम्  

  

Mahabharata, Ramayana & Bhagavata are prescribed as per the above accrodingly.
