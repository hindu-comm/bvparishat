\|\| Hare Krishna \|\|  
  
Respected Ravikumarji and scholars,  
  
Attached pdf (3 pages) is an extract from Srimad Bhagavatam on the  
matter of dharma-artha-kama-moksa as to be followed for a-pavargas.  
This is with the commentary of His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta  
Swami Prabhupada, founder acharya of the ISKCON.  
  
Verses and the Commentary throw in depth light on this matter by  
highlighting the purpose behind the idea of four purusarthas.  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
Damodara Das
