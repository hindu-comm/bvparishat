Sri Paturi ji,

  

Thank you for the clarification about daily timings.

  

So far as I know, only Vyasa's Mahabharata is considered to be a complete treatise on the purusharthas, but I think it approaches the subject indirectly - in that we need to derive our meaning and understanding about dharma, artha, kama and moksha from a comprehensive understanding of the epic itself. If that is the standard, then Valmiki's Ramayana also could be considered to be a text on the purusharthas. (And of course, the first section of Vatsyayana's work also treats of the purusharthas, but the emphasis and focus there is on the pursuit of the third category.)

  

Could you perhaps direct me to any other primary source (shastra) or any secondary work which treats of the four purusharthas, that you know of?

  

sincerely,

ravi kumar
