Hari Om

  

Thank you for the replies Sri Damodara Das ji and Sri Bhat ji

  

I believe the central issue, if we put it in varga terminology, is -***can the trivarga and the apavarga be pursued harmoniously or simultaneously? If so, how?***  

  

In the light of the above, I am getting a sense of what is being conveyed in the paper Sri Dasa attached.  

  

sincerely

ravi
