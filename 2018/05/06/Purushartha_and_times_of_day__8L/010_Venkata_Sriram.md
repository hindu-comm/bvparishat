Namaste,

  

I am aware of these definitions and concepts and I have read kAmasutra of Vatsayana & Amarukashataka of Sankara. My question is whether kAma (among the puruSArthAs) is only restricted to maithuna-bhAva? I don't think so.

  

BTW, for shAktAs and srividyopAsakAs, even the maithuna with dharmapatni becomes moksha-sAdhana. The great srividyopasaka and propagator of Durvasa Vidya, is Sage Durvasa. He writes in shakti-mahimnaH stava as:

  

गेहं नाकति गर्वित प्रवणति स्त्रीसंगमो मोक्षति ।

द्वेषी मित्रति पातकं सुकृततिक्ष्मावल्ल्भो दासति ॥

मृत्युर्वैद्यति दूषणं सुगुणति त्वतपादसंसेवनात्।

त्वां वन्दे भवभीति भञ्जनकरीं गौरीं गितीशप्रियां ॥

  

O Mother Gauri ! One who worships Thou, his house becomes heaven; his maithuna with his stri (dharma-patni) leads to

liberation; the arrogant person in contact with him gets subdued; one who hates him becomes the friend; sins get converted to

good deeds; the Lord of Death protects him....

  

Last but not the least, everything is linked to 'dharma' and that is what the rAmAyaNa and bhagavAn rAmachandra teaches us.

  

rgs,

sriram
