***Vatsyayana Mallanaga’s Kamasutra:***

  

Kama, in general, consists in engaging the ear, skin, eye, tongue, and nose each in its own appropriate sensation, all under the control of the mind and heart driven by the conscious self. ***Kama in its primary form, however, is a direct experience of an object of the senses, which bears fruit and is permeated by the sensual pleasure of erotic arousal that results from the particular sensation of touch.***

  

***Yashodhara’s commentary:***

  

Those who talk about kama say that ***kama is the most important of the three aims of human life, because it is both the cause and the result of the other two, dharma and artha.***

  

  

***Devadatta Shastri’s commentary:***

  

On reflection, it appears that ***all of human life is permeated by sexuality.*** ***That is why the Vedas and the Upanishads, too, give examples of sex between man and woman. The ten sections on sleeping together in the Rig Veda correspond to various types of sex discussed in the Kamasutra.*** The text does not deal with an improper subject or science.

  

From a spiritual viewpoint, too, ***the universe in all its variety is essentially sexual. The chief component of sex is attraction and of attraction, sex.***

***  
***

***Attraction toward respected elders*** appears in the form of faith, devotion, and other pure sentiments. Among equals, the same ***attraction appears as friendship*** and comradeship. Toward inferiors, ***attraction takes the form of compassion and kindness***, towards children, parental affection. ***The same sexuality is manifested as maternal sentiment in the mother's heart, as lust in the lover's embrace, and as compassion toward the poor*** and the suffering.

  

But ***all of these are forms of one basic emotion related to sex-attraction or sexuality.*** That is why ***the Brihadranayaka Upanishad says, 'Man is sexual.'**Sexuality is the semen of the mind.***

I don't think that taking kama in its primary sense of sex is crude. It is just common sense.
