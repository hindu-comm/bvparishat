Sri Anil Kumar ji, I was referring to the modern Indian only, not the ancients. It was only the diligent study of the texts you mentioned, inter alia, that cleansed my mind of my earlier prudery. In fact, I am from Odisha, and Konark was a fortnightly jaunt for me and my friends in my college days.
