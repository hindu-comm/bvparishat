If memory serves me well, Santi, Anusasana and perhaps Svargarohana parvas, with their subdivisional Rajadharma, Aapaddharma and Moksadharma parvas treat the subject of purusharthas in detail (in the Mahabharata). However, the discussion in Rajadharma, aapaddharma and anusasana parvas is from the viewpoint of a king or a ksatriya, while in Moksadharma the discussion is from the standpoint of a traditional brahmana, rajarishi (Panchashikha-Janaka's descendant dialogue among many others) or perhaps rishi (Vyasa-Suka dialogue comes to mind). Also, the vanaparva has discussions on related topics.

  

YogaVasistha's first prakarana (division) talks rather comprehensively of action and exertion vis-a-vis adrishta or destiny, and a meaning about purushartha in the spirit of karmayoga can be derived from it.
