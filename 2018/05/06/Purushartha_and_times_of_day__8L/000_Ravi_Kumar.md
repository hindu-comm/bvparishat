Hari Om

  

Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha - these have been indicated as the four fundamental aims of human life.

  

With the dilution of the varnasrama dharma (practically speaking; I say this with circumspection), how can the four aims be pursued in terms of daily life?

  

How, in a day of 24 hours, can these four aims be pursued? I remember reading somewhere that the early morning and part of the evening are for yoga (moksha), the night for kama (sex) and rest (sleep), and the rest of the day for artha (work and money), with dharma (piety and virtue) being observed throughout all activities.

  

Is this scheme or interpretation proper? I request for guidance in this matter.

  

sincerely,

ravi kumar
