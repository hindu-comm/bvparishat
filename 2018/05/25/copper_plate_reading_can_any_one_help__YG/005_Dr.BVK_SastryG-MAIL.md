Namaste



In the transliterated text read, please read ‘ vittamu’(= money, a value) in the place of ‘ chittamu’ (= Intent, mind) and the whole meaning of the text becomes clear.



Existing: వారి దగ్గర(?) చిత్తము (?) ఈ మాదిరి దేవునికిన్ ఇచ్చినది



Suggested : వారి దగ్గర(?)వి త్తము (?) ఈ మాదిరి దేవునికిన్ ఇచ్చినది



Reason : The use of the word and context ‘దీని ఖరీదు వచ్చెను ‘. ( Sale product value).



Regards

BVK Sastry
