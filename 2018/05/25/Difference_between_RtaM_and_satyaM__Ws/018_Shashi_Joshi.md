Does it help to see the roots of the words?

satyam comes from

as - to be

sat - that which is being (in existence)

satyam - that which is worthy of being , what should be (sati hitam satyam)  
  
Ritam has Ri dhatu which signifies movement. RiNa ( the money that has come to go), RiShi ( one who travels, or can metaphorically transport to any situation and bring satyam out), RikSha ( one that moves about in the forest), etc.

  

Is Ritam the movement of Creation, the show that is manifest?

And satyam as what should be?

And the manifest is what should be (pUrNamadaH ) ?

  

Various commentators are giving contextual meaning for the words in their domain of discussion?

  

With advance apologies for being totally off the mark!  
  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
