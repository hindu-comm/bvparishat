I dontknow if this answers the question appropriately.

  

A while back, I had written a paper on satyanveshana.

  

Here is the relevant portion:

  

### What is truth? 

The term rta means “that which is not subject to destruction at any time” (“trikAla abAdhita satya”). rta is same as Brahman, realized by the Rshis. This book is an attempt to find to the extent possible, the true message of the Rshis to whom we owe our tradition. This tradition is known as the Arsha sampradAya or the tradition of the Rshis.

We come to know about our tradition, through our current teachers, who may be the followers of some system of thought, such as advaita, visistAdvaita, dvaita and so on, founded by the pioneering AchAryas of the past, Sri Shankaracharya, Sri Ramanujacharya and Sri Madhvacharya and so on. Why is there a difference of opinion among these founding AchAryas? What really is the system of thought propounded by the Rshis? How is that system founded by the Rshis, related to the views of these main AchAryas ? Such a study becomes easier if we try to trace the roots and the development of traditional thought in India.

It is appropriate at the very beginning to clarify some fundamental terms such as satya, rta, anrta, mithya, vyAvahArika satya, “paramArtha satya”, used in this document as well as in the scriptures and commentaries.

The term rta is meant to address the highest truth, it means that which has eternal unconditional existence or that which does not get negated in the past, present or future (“trikala abAdhita satya”). According to the tradition of the Rshis and AchAryas, only Brahman is rta. The term “satya” has a range of meanings. The term satya is used to refer to Brahman in statements such as “satyam jnanam anantam brahma”. In such cases it is synonymous with rta. This highest level of truth is known as “pAramArthika satya”, which is same as rta. In fact, in Vedic literature, the term rta is invariably attributed to the cause and the term satya to the effect. In statements such as “rtam na atyEti kinchana”, which means “no one transgresses rta”, the term rta means the original cause of everything. In statements such as rtam pibantau in katopanisad, rtam is used to refer to the unavoidable effects of karma, which are due to the will of that eternal truth, Brahman.

The term anrta does not necessarily mean “lies”, but it is that which is other than the causal truth ie. The term “satya” generally refers to that which is not negated during its time (or svakAlika abhAdita). The term anrta includes satya. For example, a tree exists. However that tree may get destroyed at a certain point of time due to some event such as fire and may no longer exist. Such a temporal truth, namely that tree, can be stated as “true” or satya or even anrta! (not rta). Such temporally true entities are not absolutely true, since they do not last forever. However, they are true, while they exist, and they can be denoted by the term “satya”. anrta is not “untruth”. anrta only means that it is not the causal truth or that which is other than rta. However, many authors have used the term anrta to denote mainly untruth or lies or illusion! This is an extrapolated use of that term to suit those times.

The term satya can also mean “not lies” as commonly used in colloquial speech in sentences such as “rAma only speaks the truth”.
