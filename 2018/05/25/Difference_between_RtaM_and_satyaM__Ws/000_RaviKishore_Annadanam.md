नमस्ते विद्वान \|

  

Until recent times I did not observe much about the difference betweenऋतं and सत्यं in different contexts.

  

1\) Could you please let me know the difference between these two? (I have see two threads already in this group, however I could not understand the conclusion, whetherऋतं is the absolute truth or it is सत्यं).

2\) We do सत्यं त्वर्तेन परिषिञ्चामि for day time before taking food and in the night ऋतंत्वा सत्येन परिषिंचामि. What is the difference between these two? Why do we do सत्यं त्वर्तेन परिषिञ्चामि during day and ऋतंत्वा सत्येन परिषिंचामि during night?

3\) What is the meaning ofऋतं and सत्यं " in the context of ऋतं सत्यं परं ब्रह्म पुरुषं कृष्ण पिङ्गलम"
