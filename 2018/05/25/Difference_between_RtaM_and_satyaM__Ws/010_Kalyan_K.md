//How can you prove that? Can you show any bhashya to the Taittiriya Upanishad that predates Nagarjuna that does not 'superimpose' anything on the Upanishad? //  
  
  
  
This might be a digression from the main topic of this thread. In a different thread, I have referenced an article that discusses the origin of the theory of 2 truths in India. You may go through the article if you wish so. Advaitins might of course disagree with some of the claims in the article, but that is understandable. No one wants to accept that their school is influenced by other schools.  
  
Coming back to the topic of this thread, for me, all explanations of Ritam that superimpose later ideas or ideas from other schools are unsatisfactory.
