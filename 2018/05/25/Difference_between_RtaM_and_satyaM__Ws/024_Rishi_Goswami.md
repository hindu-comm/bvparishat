This is pretty famous in daily usage. Believing in Brahm means Brahmavadi and believing in Maya means Mayavadi, that is not the context. Both believe in both Padarthas, but define both differently.  
  
Shankaras believe in Maya as different than Shuddhatvaitis. Which means only Nirakar Brahm is True, as soon as he takes form, he becomes Mayavacchinna. Jagat is Vikari, Brahm is also Vikari if he takes form. That is what Paramarthika Sat means, Nirvikari Sat, Nirakara Brahm. Brahm inside form isn't Shuddha/Nirvikari. Jagat is Vikari form.  
  
By Brahmavadi I mean, SAkArabrahmavAda of Vallabha. Which says Brahm is only everything. There cannot be any Vikara in it. Jagat is not a VikAra of Brahm. Jagat is Avikrita pariNAma. There are no degrees of reality. Everything is Shuddha/free of deformity. Hence Brahm is Shuddha, and if everything is Brahm, everything is free of VikAra and everything is the Avikrita form of Brahm. That's what I mean by Brahmavadi.  
  
By saying Mayavadi, It doesn't simply mean believing in Maya or no. Shuddhatvaitis do believe in Maya, but don't believe that Brahm has to take it's shelter for getting a form.  
  
And many places, Maya in Geeta of Ramanuja etc Vaishnava traditions, it is defined as Satyasankalpa of Vishnu, not the TriguNatmika-Maya. For eg, in shloka संभवामि आत्ममायया it is not the TriguNatmika Maya which Krishna is talking about, it is his own Satyasankalpa/will. Same shloka Shankara varies. He calls it Trigunatmika Maya.  
  
I reckon, Abhinava Gupta hails this same concept of Brahmavada. Hence such people who believe in non-deformity in Brahm, are Brahmavadis. And those who believe in Brahm taking shelter of Maya, eg ShAnkaras are known as Mayavadis.  
  
This maybe an unofficial term, but as it's commonly used, so I thought people may know about it and hence I thought of keeping it as it is. I will make sure to use official terminologies from now on.
