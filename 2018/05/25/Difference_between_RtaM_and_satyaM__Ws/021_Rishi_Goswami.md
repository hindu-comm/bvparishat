Strictly limited in the boundaries of Vedanta and not vyavahAra, if both are to be defined, I feel Satya is basically existence and Rita is aptness.  
Hence if we say Sarvam Brahm and hence Sarvam Sat, we mean everything does exist in Paramarthika way, hence everything is Paramarthika Sat.  
  
Or if we have degrees in Sat, we can call it Sat because it exists, and Ritam cant directly be differentiated in that sense I feel.  
Sat which is grasped by mind is Rita, is not what I intend to say or interpret.  
  
What I feel is, the concluded meaning of both is indifferent, just the method is different. Both mean truth but one is existence and the other is aptness.  
  
Something is apt or not can be only determined through Manas, because it being antarindriya. Chakshurindriya can grasp RajatarUpa, but not determine weather it is Rajata or Shukti, but Manas can. Sorry for dwelling into a bit Nyaya, but I feel "Ritam vadiSHyAmi" would mean I say what is correct (or determine inside my mind what is correct, basically Brahm vadiSHyAmi as only brahm is correct and everything related to it, as in the Vedanukula Shastras), and Satyam vadiSHyAmi would mean I speak only what really exists,(so again, sarvam khalu idam brahm, therefore I speak what is the ultimate truth).  
  
It's just what I feel that both mean the same, just the way of the concluded meaning is different. Watermelon falls on the knife or knife falls on the watermelon, the result is the same, just the method of action or the process towards the result differs, that also very minutely.

Repeating.  
ऋतं यथाशास्त्रं यथाकर्तव्यं बुद्धौ सुपरिनिश्चितमर्थं त्वदधीनत्वात् त्वामेव वदिष्यामि ; सत्यमिति स एव वाक्कायाभ्यां सम्पाद्यमानः।  
  
Ritam is what should be done as prescribed by the Shastras, and after DETERMINING IT INSIDE THE MIND, I will only speak that as I am beneath the Shastras, and Satyam IS THE SAME THING, but it is carried by body and speech.  
  
  
Therefore, probably the Aacharyas also haven't detailed much on this, just explained in short the minute difference, as in Ritam is used when something can be determined through mind, and Satyam is used to describe what exists and can be expressed through body and speech.  
  
I don't think Ritam Satyam are 2 different things, where Ritam can only be determined through Mind and Satyam cannot, and Satya has degrees hence it can be expressed through body and speech. No. That isn't what is written. What is been understood here is that Ultimate Reality is written as Rita and Satya is different. If that were the case, than Shankaracharya wouldn't write "SATYAM SA EVA". Also, this meaning would not be valid for SakaraBrahmavadis (Shuddhadvaitis), for they don't have degrees in reality so both would be referring to the same Ultimate Reality.  
  
Paramarthika Satya can be expressed through Speech. Its not like Ultimate reality can't be expressed through speech, it can be.  
  
But we use Ritam in context of determination because anything can and will be determined through mind only, without mind-soul connection, there will be no consciousness to determine anything.  
  
Rest there is no difference between the words, just that while expression, the context is different. (SATYAM SA EVA). Satya is the same thing as Rita, but only used in the context of speech and body.  
  
I'm not a schollar, but this is just what I grasped. Please do correct me for I'm genuinely curious.
