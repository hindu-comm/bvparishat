Sri Rishi Goswami says:

  

//Further,there is much debate abd questioning about how BrahmavAdis say everything is PAramArthika sat, but if this interpretation is taken into consideration, both meanings can stay fit for Brahmavadis and Mayavadis as well.//

  

He appears to have a notion that Mayavadis are a different category from Brahmavadis. It should be known that Mayavadis also talk (vadanti) about Brahman and Brahmavadins (whoever they are) also talk about mAyA. The Brahmasutra, Upanishads and the Bhagavadgita - all have the term mAyA and thus are to be categorized as 'mAyAvAda'.

  

Here is an article that seems to discuss Rtm and Satyam in great detail:
