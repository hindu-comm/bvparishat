Namaste,  
In the context of the commentary to the shAnti pATha of the shIkshA valli (ie ऋतं  
वदिष्यामि । सत्यं वदिष्यामि ।), shankarAchArya says:  
1) ऋतं यथाशास्त्रं यथाकर्तव्यं बुद्धौ सुपरिनिश्चितमर्थं - Rtam is the meaning understood by the intellect after a thorough analysis of scripture of what one's conduct ought to be.  
2) सत्यमिति स एव वाक्कायाभ्यां सम्पाद्यमानः - satyam is conduct by speech, body, etc conducive to what scripture teaches as Rtam.
