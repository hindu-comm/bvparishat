।। श्रीहरिः ।।  
नमस्ते to all schollars.  
  
I am re-posting here, in an old thread. Even to my curiosity, I tried and arrived to a conclusion. Both ऋतं and सत्यम् basically mean the same, but I feel as they have different roots, the process of derivation would be different।  
  
I wouldn't like to differentiate on the basis of degrees of reality, as certain Aacharyas like Vallabhacharya do not view reality as Shankaracharya views, so let's leave that aside and say "Sarvam Sat" and take in consideration, Avikrita-pariNAma-vAda of Vallabha, then how do we define these two terms? There would be no difference in the interpretation of Vedas in this context. Ritam and Satyam would be the same here.  

  
ऋतं यथाशास्त्रं यथाकर्तव्यं बुद्धौ सुपरिनिश्चितमर्थं त्वदधीनत्वात् त्वामेव वदिष्यामि ; सत्यमिति स एव वाक्कायाभ्यां सम्पाद्यमानः  
  

Here and in Sayana as I read above, both have the same meaning, Rita is mAnasika/bauddhika, and satya is through speech or kaayika. That is the only difference that can be concluded, (as in the niSHkriSHTa artha).  
  
But, through the roots, how do we derive or come towards this meaning?  
Satya derives from the root As bhuvi,and means SattA, vidyamAnatvam.  
  
सत्यं ज्ञानम् अनन्तं ब्रह्म would probably mean that God exists, therefore he is true, Ghatam sat, pushpam sat, hence true. God is exisiting, all-knowledgeable and endless.

ऋतं च स्वाध्यायप्रवचने च। सत्यञ्च स्वाध्यायप्रवचने च।  
Rita is derived from Ri gatau root, and through lakshaNA, probably it means enlightened (deepta), buddha or something which is yathArtha/Aapta (through lakshaNA).  
In vyavahAra as well, we use the root"gam/go" when we understand something. We say, "I got it" or Avagatam in Samskrita. Similarly, Ri gatau can be derived through lakshaNA to mean correct, enlightened or apt. And as Aacharyas define it to be aantarika, which also makes sense. As avadhAraNam is always Aantarika, we always understand something from inside. One which is Buddha, Deepta and already apt is Ritam, concluding to the ultimate reality = ParamBrahm.  
  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
  
Hence, I guess ritam would mean aptness or correctness, and satyam would mean existence. Hence, through different ways, both conclude to the same meaning, truth. This is what I have concluded, that what exists is truth and what is correct is truth and hence both words conclude to the same meaning through different methods.  
  
Which also fits in place when we say Anritam. Anritam would mean incorrect, ayathArtha or apramA. I don't know the meaning of "SatyanchAnritancha satyam abhavat.Yadidam......shloko bhavati." but what I have understood by reading commentary is that in the commentary Shankaracharya writes,  
"मृगतृष्णिकाद्यनृतापेक्षया उदकादि सत्यमुच्यते। अनृतं च तद्विपरीतम्।"  
MrigatrishNa is incorrect hence is Anrita and water exists, hence is Satya, therefore Anrita is opposite of Satya.  
  
Further,there is much debate abd questioning about how BrahmavAdis say everything is PAramArthika sat, but if this interpretation is taken into consideration, both meanings can stay fit for Brahmavadis and Mayavadis as well.  
  
Mayavadis can take categories in Satya or existence and can interpret Rita as something Yathartha or Ayarthartha. Similarly, Brahmavadis can say Satya means existence only and can say Rita ajd Anrita are Prama and Aprama respectively.  
  
  
This is how I have concluded.

Rishi.
