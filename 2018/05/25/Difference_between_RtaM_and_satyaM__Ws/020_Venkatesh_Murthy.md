Namaste

  

If Rita is correct understanding of Truth and Satyam is Truth there is a still a small difference between them. Why? Because Paramartha Satyam cannot be grasped in the mind also. Yato Vaacho Nivartante Apraapya Manasaa Saha is the saying of Sruti. Then what is ultimate Jnaana for the mind? It is Mano Naasha itself. It is the same as realization of Falsity of the world. Conclusion can be- Rita is grasped in Mind but Satyam is not. Satya is always existing and not dependent on someone understanding it or not.
