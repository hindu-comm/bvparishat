The following are from the Vishnupuranam which clearly say that Brahman (Vishnu/Janardana) has to 'take/assume/depend' (samaashritya) on the three Gunas of Maya/prakriti in order to be the jagat srishti, sthiti and laya kaaraNam:

  

चतुर्विभागः संसृष्टौ चतुर्भेदो जनार्दनः ।। २२ ।।

एकेनांशेन ब्रह्मासौ भवत्यव्यक्तमूर्त्तिमान् ।  
मरीचिमिश्वाः पतयः प्रजानामन्यभागतः ।। २३ ।।

कालस्तृतीयस्तस्यांशः सर्व्वभूतानि चापरः ।  
इत्थ चतुर्धा संसृष्टौ *वर्त्ततेऽसौ रजोगुणः* ।। २४ ।।

एकांशेन स्थितो विष्णुः करोति प्रतिपालनम् ।  
मन्वादिरूपश्चान्येन कालरूपोऽपरेण च ।। २५ ।।

सर्व्वबूतेषु चान्येन संस्थितः कुरुते रतिम् ।  
*सत्त्वं गुणं समाश्रित्य* जगतः पुरुषोत्तमः ।। २६ ।।

*आश्रित्य तमसो वृत्तिमन्तकाले तथा पुनः ।*  

रुद्रस्वरूपो भगवानेकांशेन भवत्यजः ।। २७

  

By such resorting to the three gunas, Brahman does not undergo any vikara. Also, the jagat is not any vikara of Brahman. ShAnkaras do not say that Brahman's vikara is the jagat; they hold that the world is a vivarta of Brahman. You can see how much of (triguNaatmikaa) mayavada is in the above Vishnu puranam verses and how it is also Brahmavada at the same time.

This is the part of the Shankara's commentary to the shloka संभवामि आत्ममायया i -

  

**प्रकृतिं**स्वां मम वैष्णवीं मायां त्रिगुणात्मिकाम् यस्या वशे सर्वं जगत् वर्तते यया मोहितं सत् स्वमात्मानं वासुदेवं न जानाति तां प्रकृतिं स्वाम्**अधिष्ठाय**वशीकृत्य**संभवामि**देहवानिव भवामि

  

Where do you see //Brahm taking shelter of Maya// ? It is actually the opposite:प्रकृतिं स्वाम्**अधिष्ठाय**वशीकृत्य..

Actually the Vishnu puranam (Veda Vyasa) will have to be called mayavada/i as per your definition.
