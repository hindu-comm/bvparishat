here the term satya is truth as in speech

  

for example in Ramayana - anrtamnOkta purvam me na cha vakshyE kadachana

  

means I never spoke lies and will never do so.

  

Hence this satyamevajayatenanrtam may be taken as related to truth as in speech.

  

even if you take satyaas absolute truth,

the sentence

  

satyam evajayatenaanrtam

  

means : truth wins and not ( not (not causal truth))

  

that means - truth wins and not (temporal truth)

  

this means absolute truth wins and not (temporal truth).

  

Even this is understandable this way.
