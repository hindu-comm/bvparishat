There is a female counterpart for this very asana. Transmutation of reproductive fluid into ojas is a requirement for not just men but women too. The physical aspect of the asana is limited to the physical alone. It is extended in scope and application by certain pranayamas, mitahara (restriction on food) and certain dharanas.

It serves as the base asana for further advanced practices such as vajroli, sahajoli, amaroli etc. Many of the later have different versions based on different yogic/tantric traditions.  

  

Dhairyam / Dheera comes from stillness of prana/manas. It is one of the 10 lakshanas of Dharma as per Manu Smrti. Sperm will keep getting generated as long as the manas is in one of the 3 avasthas jagrut, svapna and sushupti. Stopping this generation is possible only in the state of turya and beyond where the mind drops off. Siddhasana is a useful asana for maintaining long hours of meditation since it makes it effortless(relatively speaking) to keep the lower back straight with minimal pressure on the hip flexors.
