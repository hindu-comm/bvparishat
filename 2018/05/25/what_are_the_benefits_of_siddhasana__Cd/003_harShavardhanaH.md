Adding to what has been given below, in addition to the cross-legged posture, there's also the aspect of fixing of the eyes on the nose (nasikagra, either end of the nose) and the chin-lock (jalandhara bandha, adjunct to continuing pranayama or kevala kumbhaka). This whole posture is what is called the siddhasana, not just the leg's position.

  

Ancient texts say the entire nadi system is purified by the practice of siddhasana.
