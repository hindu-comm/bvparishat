Namaste Ramesh Mahodaya,

  

siddhAsana is recommended for men who want to convert their sexual energy into ojas. This is effected by blocking the perineum with the left heel and clasping the reproductive organ from above with the right. Over a period of time a yogi/ kuNDalini practitioner manages to master the sexual energy and utilise it as ojas and even get khechari siddhi. There is a difference in opinion among some as to whether sperm is generated and reabsorbed (as per some vAmamArga tantriks that practice vajroli) or not generated at all since its converted to ojas (yogis such as Sivananda Maharaj) before it becomes sperm; either way, that is the justification given. AFAIK, most of the details are not documented openly in books and those which document them may not really be accurate.  
  
PS: There may be other variation/s for this Asana as per others, but this is the only one I know, which is why only men can do this Asana.

  

Kind rgds,
