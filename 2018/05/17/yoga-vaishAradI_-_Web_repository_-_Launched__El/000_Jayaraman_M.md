Namaste  
  
Greetings from Krishnamacharya Yoga mandiram.  
  

We feel happy to share that we have launched a web application called Yogavaiśāradī yesterday. It is a searchable web repository of classical commentaries of Yogasūtras of Patañjali.  
  
The URL for the web repository -
[www.kymyogavaisharadi.org](http://www.kymyogavaisharadi.org)  

  
(It is being developed in two stages. This is the launch of the first stage)  
  

A brief video introduction (2 Mins 50 secs) to the web repository can be viewed here - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0OpjWOsAjY>  
  

The video of the launch program (Launched by Srimat Swami Gautamananda Ji Maharaj Vice President of Ramakrishna Mission and Ramakrishna Math) can be viewed here - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpEe5Ua50O4>

  

We hope that Yogavaiśāradī will be a handy authentic reference resource for students, teachers and researchers in yoga and philosophy in general.

We request you to give your valuable feedback about the web repository so that we will be able to refine and add value to the content and make it a comprehensive reference resource for commentary literature of Yogasūtras.
