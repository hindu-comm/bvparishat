What is needed is application of shastra knowledge and methodology to analyse and critique moden paradigms

E.g politics and governance,cultural issues like equality,gay rights etc, meaning and purpose of education to just name afew.

  

When gurukulas,univs,ngos etc. start working on these and bring fresh perspectives and better solutions then praasangikataa will lead to vibrant sanskrit.

  

Thanks
