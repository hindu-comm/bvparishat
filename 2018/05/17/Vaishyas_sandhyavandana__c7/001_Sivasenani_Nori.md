As per Sastra, they are eligible. I had taken a friend to a VedapaaThaSaala, where a GhanapaaThin (Sriman Pandurangacharyulu Salakshana Ghanapathi of Madhura Nagar, Dilsukhnagar, Hyderabad) confirmed his eligibility and took him as a student. I do not know the tradition amongst Vaishyas, but may be looking up Sayanacharya's Sandhyaavandanabhaashya might help.
