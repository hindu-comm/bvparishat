1. This is a current issue for ‘Dharma Shaastra research’ and historical practices in specific jatis of India.

2. The textual references for prayoga for ‘ upanayana’ to ‘ ALL in SOCIETY’ ( including Divyaangas/ challenged) including ‘ Women’ – is deliberated and explained as ‘Samskara in Bodhaayana . The provisions have been already there in the traditional works.
