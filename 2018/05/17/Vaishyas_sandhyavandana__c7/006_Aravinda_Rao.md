I do not know whether the vysya varna dharma got amended with the passage of time, in the various dharma shastra texts which have come.

The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (1-4-11) on wards says that in the beginning there was only one category or varna, i.e., Brahmana. That was not able to fulfill the needs of the society (security from aggression from another group etc) and hence it created the kshatriya. Even that was not enough and hence it created the vysya. When this too was inadequate, it created the sudra, the pushan, the one who feeds or nourishes the society.

  

Lord Krishna was a vysya according to his own definition of the term

कृषि गौरक्ष्य वाणिज्यं वैश्यकर्म स्वभावजम् (Gita ch 18 - 44). He surely studied the Vedas.  

In the Ramayana commentary by Govindaraja we see that even a nishada chief is as good as a king and he is entitled to perform yajna. This was in the context of Guha.

I think we should encourage all farmers and cowherds (yadavas) to wear the yajnopavitham and perform rituals. Most of goldsmiths, weavers etc., were wearing it till recent times but they have now given up. Most other castes wore the thread until the time of invasions from the 10th century onwards and gradually seem to have removed the thread when they faced threat.
