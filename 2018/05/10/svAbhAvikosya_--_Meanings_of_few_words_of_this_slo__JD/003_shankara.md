Damodara Dasaji,

  

You might find useful the Hindi translation of Bharadvaja Samhita by Babulal Sukla.

As per this translation, 'Yaati Upaayataam' means 'becomes Upaya, the means' for attaining the Grace of God. i.e. the awareness of the relationship of the devotee with God becomes the Upaya for attaining the Grace of God.



regards  
shankara
