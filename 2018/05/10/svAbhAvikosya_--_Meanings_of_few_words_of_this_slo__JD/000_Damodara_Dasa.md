Respected Vidvaj-janas,  
  
In my tranlation work I came across following verse from Bharadvaja Samhita  
(<https://archive.org/details/np_bhsamhita>):  
  
svAbhAviko'sya sambandhaH puMso yaH paramAtmanA \|  
tasyaiva bodho nyAsAkhyaH prathamaM yAtyupAyatAm \|\|1.75\|\|  
  
I could not understand the meaning of word "upAyatAm." Also who is  
kartA for word "yAti?"  
  
My proposed translation is like this:  
"The relation of jIva or soul with Supersoul is natural and the  
knowledge of this is known as nyAsa. This relationship goes to them  
who follows nyAsa process even once."  
\[I have translated upAyatAm as 'to one who is executer of this upAya.'\]  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
