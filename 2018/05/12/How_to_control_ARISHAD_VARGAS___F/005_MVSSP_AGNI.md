Textual references please. Coming to the guru option do you know any person who controlled his senses ? I just know only one - the jagadguru of sringeri . I saw the news that in kerala the govt . Of kerala invited them to reopen a pond after renovation and they agreed. At that place an MLA removed their seat by telling some cause. If the jagadguru reacts against them then without any doubt there will be a communal violence but they reacted in a different manner they never came for that occasion and sent his disciple vidhusekhara swamiji to open the pond and he although at the age of youth (which have more aggressive nature) came and opened the pond and went out without saying anyword.  When I heard it i just remembered "maanavamanayoh tulyaha"and then I practically felt that they are the "STHITHA PRAJNAS". Do you know any other persons in the materialistic world of us who are STHITHA PRAJNAS except sanyasis.
