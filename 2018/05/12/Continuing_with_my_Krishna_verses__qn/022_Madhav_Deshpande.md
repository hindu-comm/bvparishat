Thank you, Nagarajji, for your suggestion. Once my poem reaches a conclusion, I need to reorder the verses for a smoother flow of themes, and may need some editing attention. I don’t want to rush myself, as there are other academic commitments that are waiting to be completed. But I want to express my indebtedness to the members of this group for the interest and enthusiasm they have shown for my poems. When I started a few months ago, I did not think in my wildest dreams that I would write now close to 300 verses on Krishna. So I must thank him as well for the inspiration he has provided to me.
