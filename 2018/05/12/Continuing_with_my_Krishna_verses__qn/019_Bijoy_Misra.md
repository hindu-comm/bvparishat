Friends,

  

In our work of finding the neurological basis of the syllables we are

studying Anandavardhana's Dhvayaloka now. He talks about

व्यञ्जक and व्यंग as two simultaneous constructs for rasa.

  

With the beautiful creative compositions in front of us, can someone

knowledgeable help map Anandavardhana's views using Madhavji's

Krishna verses?  

  

Thank you.
