Sir  
  

Let me state the reportedly possible view "There is nothing specially great about Veda memorising pundits" fully.  
  

Given the fuzziness surrounding brain studies (that is a topic by itself, but basically newer studies are showing that there are issues in both understanding the implications of various studies and in reporting them - see FN1), it is not really the best tool that the modern world can offer, but even setting aside the issues with fMRI studies, a nuanced view would be as follows: "The increase in the hippocampus region of the brain in Vedic scholars is not unique; a similar increase in size occurs in London cab drivers, for instance. Thus, the present study does not demonstrate anything specially great about Veda-memorising pundits. This is not to say that there is nothing great about Veda-memorising pundits. They are the lucky ones who know all that there is to be known; the blessed ones, who have the requisite basis to know Brahman. The latter attribute (knowledge of Veda) is far greater than the former (change in brain); it is like focussing on Sachin Tendulkar's singing abilities - the presence or lack of singing abilities in Sachin Tendulkar, or the greatness or otherwise of such abilities, is immaterial compared to his cricketing greatness. Similarly in the case of hippocampi of the brains of Vedic scholars, an increase or not, whether it is unique or not, is quite insignificant in comparison to the fact that they know the Veda."

<https://www.newscientist.com/article/2097734-thousands-of-fmri-brain-studies-in-doubt-due-to-software-flaws/> is an article in the "New Scientist" which is based mainly on the above paper, but also links up other articles.  
<https://www.vox.com/2016/9/8/12189784/fmri-studies-explained> is another report, based on the same paper, but with more explanation.  

There is a new field called neuro-marketing. The premise is that subjects would be wired up when using the product of a company; then, if the regions of brain associated with happiness light up, presto, the product is good; otherwise it is not. Similarly, if a particular area, most commonly the anterior cingulate cortex, lights up, the subject has a conflict in his mind. And, so on. The problem is that brain is not fully understood; we are at the very beginning stages of understanding the working of the brain fully (recall the excitement of universal grammar and the search for the wiring in the brain) and MRI is a particularly slow method to study an organ which works very fast (an entire kaavya flashes in the mind of an author as Sphota, but the slow MRI machine will not light up still). So, this new field of neuro-marketing has been categorized as pseudo-science by sceptics.
