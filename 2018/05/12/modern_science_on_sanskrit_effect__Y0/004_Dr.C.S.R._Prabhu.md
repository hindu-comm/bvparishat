Absolutely.The final goal of Vedic knowledge is Brahma Jnana. "Brahmana" word etymology also means the knower of Brahman which has two meanings one is Para Brahman and the other is Veda itself which gives that knowledge of Para Brahman.Chanting from memory is only one aspect.Understandng the meaning of such Vedic chanting with the help of Vedangas and Upangas(Darshanas) will give rise to Brahma Jnana,which is the ultimate for Enlightenment
