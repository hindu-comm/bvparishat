Thanks Dr Sivasenani Nori garu, for the clarification.

  

Without such necessary complementing words, there is a scope of misunderstanding the comparison of the effects on Veda Pundits to the effects on London cab drivers.

  

Elsewhere, I said, "the string of the cotton cleaning 'bow' also makes sound just as the string of Arjuna's bow makes. Strings of stringed musical instruments make music while a general string makes sound. The string of Veena gets affected by the repeated use of it and any other general string too gets affected by the repeated use of it. The stone constructed rim of a well gets the dip formed by repeated placing of the water-fetching mud pot on it. The grass path on which my Guru repeatedly walks gets the mark of Guru's feet. "
