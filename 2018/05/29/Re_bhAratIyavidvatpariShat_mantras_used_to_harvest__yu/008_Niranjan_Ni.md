Dear Sriram ji,

  

Thank you for the resource. However in pages 305-6 it is mentioned that certain Rks are chanted 100 times for papakshayartham. They have not mentioned what Rk is to be chanted.

  

Also the nakshatras and months in which different classes of trees and plants are to be planted. This probably has more to do with the seasonal considerations rather than the considerations of jyotisha.

  

The reason why I am a bit anal about this is I have had bad expeirence trying to grow Tulasi. I do not wish to kill anymore holy plants or trees and add to my bank balance of bad karma.

I am therefore trying to cover all bases yathashakti.

  

Namaste,

  

Niranjan
