I believe my friend Bharat Sastry ([bhrth....@gmail.com]()) has some knowledge about this.

  

I remember reading in Swami Rama's book that his Guru used the "Ishe tva Urje tva" mantra from YV for plucking twigs, flowers, fruits etc.. I am not sure of the shastric sources though.

  

How do I tag[bhrth....@gmail.com]() in this list? to highlight this question to him?
