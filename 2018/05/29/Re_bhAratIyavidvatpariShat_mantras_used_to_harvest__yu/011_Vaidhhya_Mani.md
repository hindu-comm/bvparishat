Dear Sir,

I have came to know about your query that some mantras are used for plants and trees.

I don't know any mantras,but I know of one deity.Whether you know this deity or not, I don't know.I am just giving for the sake of plants and trees.

  

Sri Sakambari Devi,who is the athidevatha of plants and trees,is worshipped to get good yield from plants and trees.She is worshipped very grand in Rajasthan.
