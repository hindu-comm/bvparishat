Friends,

  

The current discussion on another thread regarding the origin of a theory pertaining to the "two truths" has brought out some close points on both sides.

  

Can scholars here throw some light on how this theory fared at the hands of the Nyaya philosophers in the debates they had with the Buddhists?

  

So far as I know, Nyaya had the final word in the debates, be it the issue of the atma vs kshanikavada or the issue of paramatma vs shunyavada.

  

If you could recommend any studies, I would be glad to refer to them also.

  

kind regards

Harsha
