Namo Namah to all Sanskrit Lovers,  
  
I have few queies which are not getting solved for many days.  
  
1. How to type sanskrit with diatrics in english with some font like balaram font.  
2. I have many files with english diatrics, wanted to convert to mangal font and RM-Devanagari, Indevr font. What is easiest way to do this. Please guide.  
*  
Sample text  
"athāto bhaktiṁ vyākhyāsyāmaḥ*"  - with diatrics  
*athato bhaktimvyakhyasyamah*   - without diatrics  
अथातो भक्तिम् व्याख्यास्यामः        - मंगल  
  
3. If I want to remove diatrics of text files how it can be done.  
4. are there any videos to make font conversion software / program. I am interested to make such program for this repetitive task of font conversion. I heard about making character map, but I don't know how do it. Kindly help.  
  
Regards,

Santosh Jagtap
