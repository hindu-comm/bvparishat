Dear Scholars,

A friend of mine has been told that there is a reference to the bird 'rājahaṁsa' in some works of Kalidasa. A number of you are specialists in Kalidasa and I thought I would request your help in this matter.SInce he is making a documentary on this bird he needs it urgently. Shall be grateful for the information.  

Thank you
