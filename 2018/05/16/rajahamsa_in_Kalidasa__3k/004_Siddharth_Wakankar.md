Dear scholar.friends,

  

There is an excellent book,viz.Birds in Sanskrit Literature,by Shri Dave.

  

Therein you will find details of almost all the birds described in Skt.Lit.

The Sanskrit Text Mrugapakshishastra edited by Dr.Nalini Sadhale also is worth studying.

On this theme,Prof.Gauri Mahulikar of Mumbai had organised a Seminar.In the proceedings.of it,my Keynote Address gives a lot of info.about Birds and Animals,esp.Mss.dealing with this topic.

Scholars may refer to it.

  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
