Dear Friends & Scholars,

I am Professor Tushar Sarkar--aretired univ prof. I have just completed the Typescrit of a book: 'Studies in Jaina Philosophy': A New Perspective on the four pillars \[viz, Anekantavada, Syadvada, Nayavada & Vibhajyavada\]of Jainism. I mostly taught Analytic Phil. Logic, & Phil of Science. So, I thought, it is advisable to approach the established scholarsthrough bvp, with the request to bring my request to such scholars who may be willing & kind enough to take a look at the TSS of the book and help me with their valuable suggestions \[critical, as well asconstructive\]. Scholars who feel interested may kindly contact me for any related question. Thank you all. Professor Sarkar.
