Respected scholars and great minds,

  

UGC Standing Committee has removed 4305 journals from the current UGC-Approved List of Journals because of poor quality / incorrect / insufficient information/ false claims and 191 journals are under evaluation by Standing Committee.

  

Many reputed Sanskrit journals names are existed in that list.

  

One small addition to this recently UGC also announced that :

  

The UGC would also like to clarify that 4,305 journals which have been removed on 2nd May, 2018 were UGC-approved journals till that date and, as such, articles published/accepted in them prior to 2nd May 2018 by applicants for recruitment/promotion may be considered and given points accordingly by universities.  

  

The universities can send recommendations to UGC. The recommendation portal will be opened once every year.

  

Please find the attachment for more details.
