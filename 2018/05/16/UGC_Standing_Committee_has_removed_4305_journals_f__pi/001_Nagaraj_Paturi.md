This step was long overdue.

  

The whole story started with a great step taken by Sri P V Narasimha Rao-ji with all good intentions.

  

UG college teachers were provided equivalence with university teachers with opportunity to get promoted to associate professor and professor ranks and guide research students for MPhil and PhD.

  

But the promotions were linked to the research output measured in terms of journal and other publications.

  

Another consequence was the high pay scales of university teachers getting extended to ug college teachers and this too getting linked to research output.

  

This lead to a huge fraudulent industry of fake research journals and fake book publications.

  

The UGC has been taking many steps in the form of putting criteria for recognising these journals and books.

  

The fraudsters have been successful in finding work around methods for everyone of these new rules.

  

the present step was required to control this malpractice.
