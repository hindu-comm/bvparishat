Pranaam

The issues raised by Dr. BVK Sastry is pertinent and must be clarified.

Sanskrit is explored, in general on two fronts, if a bifurcation is really possible, I am afraid.

  

One Sanskrit as a language and its Literature

Second, Sanskrit, being a careerof Indian thoughts andthe tradition,
to say as a "Knowledge System"., which reaches to Indian philosophy, astronomy, mathematics, ... and ... a lot more

  

Both explorations enjoy their own methodologies with adaptive emphasis.

Should the journals be specific in these issues?

Best Wishes

Regards

Sati Shankar
