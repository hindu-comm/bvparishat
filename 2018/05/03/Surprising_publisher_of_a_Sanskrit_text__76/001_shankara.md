Deshpandeji,

  

The name of Śarīf Sālemahammad is mentioned in 1917 edition of Vrittiprabhakara also as its first publisher and copyright holder.[Prem Prahlajrai in his PhD thesis](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/25075/Pahlajrai_washington_0250E_12518.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y), has taken note of this, in a footnote on page 90. But, he too doesn't provide any more information on Śarīf Sālemahammad.



regards  
shankara
