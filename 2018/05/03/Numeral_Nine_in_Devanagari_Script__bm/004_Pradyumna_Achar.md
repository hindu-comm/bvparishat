Namaste.

It appears similar to the Maithili (Tirhuta script) numeral nine![](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/14934d6147e85/image.png?part=0.6&view=1)  

<https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2011/11175r-tirhuta.pdf>  

  

(If the larger manuscript from where these images of numerals were extracted is available, then it would be easier to deduce the script, I suppose, as then there would be a variety of other characters and contextual information available to theorize on.)
