I do appreciate the efforts made for preserving numerals in Indian languages. Let all Indian adopt uniformly the so-called Arabic numerals, which in fact are of Indian origin.This will foster uniformity in theinternationalscene and avoid lots of confusion. The English digit 8 is used for 4 in Bangla and looks similar to Gurmukhi 4, the numeral 5 in Hindi,Gurmukhi or Gujarati or 6 in Urdu can generally be mistaken as 4 in writing. There is more confusion between Indian languages. Hindi 7 is Bangla 3, Hindi 1 is Bangla 7, and Hindi 1 is English or Urdu 9. Let us preserve Indian scripts forlinguistic research and manuscript reading. South Indian languages have shown the way.
