Namaste



The question raised by Prof. RNI on visual scripting of nine is an interesting one; and in the context of Jyotisha manuscripts. While I don’t claim any special skills in manuscript reading,



I am making a few pointers for further exploration.



***Basis for suggestion***: 



(1) The text under consideration is a manuscript of Jyotish, where in extensive use of numerals, numeric operations and devanagari
varnamaalaa is all put together.

 The representation of numerals in text form / word form / symbols /scripts / encryption in the discipline of Vedanga Jyotisha is well known.



(2). **Jytoisha Text- scribes/ Teachers** might have made a specific convention on marking the pages of the colophons where a ‘ Nine numeric value gets represented by a language Character signifying its value.
Using Alphabet visual of script for numeral is not uncommon when encryption is intended. 



In this specific case, the visual of symbol NINE shown resembles SIDDHAM script (<http://www.omniglot.com/writing/siddham.htm> )- The symbol for ‘Na’ written with a flip /twist. ( Visual of numeral transformed).

OR

Close to Siddham / Tamil script – the ninth swara . ( Numeral visual substitution by alphabet visual ).

OR

Drawn from Grantham scribing convention (<http://www.omniglot.com/writing/grantha.htm> ) – See the ninth letter- visual using kaTapayAdi formula. ( Manuscript migration within traditional scribes)



OR



Drawn from TIBETAN <https://www.omniglot.com/writing/tibetan.htm> .
The numeral NINE has the trills . Also observe the punctuation marks in Tibetan. Tibet was well known for Tantra studies and Jyotisha. (Manuscript migration for coying across different schools- to indicate the scribe /school convention).



OR

Chinese SHANG convention Numeral NINE coming in ( through what route- I don’t know !) - <https://www.omniglot.com/chinese/numerals.htm>



**The famous Sutra ‘ kaTapayAdi’ is not limited to numeral position representation; but also for numeral visual symbol substitution by character visuals .**



When the ‘ language character visual of a specific script is used for writing the numeral nine, it will be ‘ CODED SCRIPTING CONVENTION ( Alpha Numeric where a numeral symbol –visual gets substituted by the encrypted alphabet visual symbol.





(3) We are not sure that uniformity of numeral- visuals were consistently used in colophon- columns by manuscript scribe copyists who would copy the text from one region at another region/ or scribe from voice.



 The different mode of marking the page numbers is a convention of copyist –scribe . It is not a part of original text composition.
Interesting would be the research exploration on how flowing sutra
texts ( of technical disciplines ) like Vyakarana , Chandas, Jyotish, were numerically marked for Adhyaya -Pada – Sutra , beyond the boundary marking of each sutra itself. Mammoth would be this challenge, when it comes to texts like Vedas, Ramayana, Mahabharata / Gita where section-Chapter division would be critical ! And would need a numeric visual. 



***Suggestion - logic***: If Varna-mala could be encrypted for use by Indian scholars in texts, there could have been a similar model for scripting and encrypting ‘ alpha-numeric values also with a mixing of symbols for visuals and numerals’.





***End Note***: When digital documents based research and discussions , claims of authenticity of texts –passages –translations are order of the day as ‘ evidence of authenticity’ of the’ continuity of text from a hoary past’, (?!) , we also need to explore how the texts were formatted and pages were numbered in the colophons !



For further exploration by scholars please.

Sir , Prof. Iyengar's post is part of research only. He is not asking people to use the script.



You seem to know many scripts and probably capable of answering his question:

Please help if you can.

I do appreciate the efforts made for preserving numerals in Indian languages. Let all Indian adopt uniformly the so-called Arabic numerals, which in fact are of Indian origin.This will foster uniformity in theinternationalscene and avoid lots of confusion. The English digit 8 is used for 4 in Bangla and looks similar to Gurmukhi 4, the numeral 5 in Hindi,Gurmukhi or Gujarati or 6 in Urdu can generally be mistaken as 4 in writing. There is more confusion between Indian languages. Hindi 7 is Bangla 3, Hindi 1 is Bangla 7, and Hindi 1 is English or Urdu 9. Let us preserve Indian scripts forlinguistic research and manuscript reading. South Indian languages have shown the way.

I am going through a few manuscripts of Vrddha-gaargiiya-jyotisha from different libraries. All are on paper and copied after *c* 1500 CE. Apart from the variation in the script I observed a curious feature about the folio pagination in the border. All have numerals 1 to 0 almost similar to the modern forms except for number 9. There is some minor difference with 7 and 8 but variation in numeral nine is too conspicuous. I am showing only a few of these here:

1.![](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/146cd94949449/image001.png?part=0.1)number 19.
![](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/146cd94949449/image002.png?part=0.2)number 39. (Nearly modern)



2.![](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/146cd94949449/image004.png?part=0.3)number 99.
![](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/146cd94949449/image006.png?part=0.4)again number 99 (Similar form in Kannada and Telugu)



3.![](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/146cd94949449/image008.png?part=0.5)number 9.![](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/146cd94949449/image010.png?part=0.6)number 99 (Identified as Bengali)



4.![](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/146cd94949449/image011.png?part=0.7)number 197. 
![](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/146cd94949449/image013.png?part=0.8)
number 198.![](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/146cd94949449/image015.png?part=0.9)number 196

  
I have looked into the Manual on Manuscriptology by TN Dharmadhikari (Pune 2011) and articles by KV Sarma. But they don't address variation in numerals. While many are interested in the numeric representation of zero (0), I feel study of nine (9) is also important. Now, being ignorant of manuscript tradition and not knowing regional peculiarities my question to scholars on BVP is: Can some one identify from which part of India the number 9 in the last row (No.4) above could have originated.  
  
Thanks

RN Iyengar
