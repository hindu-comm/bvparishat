I am going through a few manuscripts of Vrddha-gaargiiya-jyotisha from different libraries. All are on paper and copied after *c* 1500 CE. Apart from the variation in the script I observed a curious feature about the folio pagination in the border. All have numerals 1 to 0 almost similar to the modern forms except for number 9. There is some minor difference with 7 and 8 but variation in numeral nine is too conspicuous. I am showing only a few of these here:

1.![](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/df0f3506780f/image.png?part=0.4&view=1)number 19.
![](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/df0f3506780f/image.png?part=0.9&view=1)number 39. (Nearly modern)  

  

2.![](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/df0f3506780f/image.png?part=0.5&view=1)number 99.
![](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/df0f3506780f/image.png?part=0.3&view=1)again number 99 (Similar form in Kannada and Telugu)

  

3.![](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/df0f3506780f/image.png?part=0.1&view=1)number 9.![](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/df0f3506780f/image.png?part=0.2&view=1)number 99 (Identified as Bengali)

  

4.![](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/df0f3506780f/image.png?part=0.8&view=1)number 197. 
![](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/df0f3506780f/image.png?part=0.6&view=1)
number 198.![](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/df0f3506780f/image.png?part=0.7&view=1)number 196  
  

  
I have looked into the Manual on Manuscriptology by TN Dharmadhikari (Pune 2011) and articles by KV Sarma. But they don't address variation in numerals. While many are interested in the numeric representation of zero (0), I feel study of nine (9) is also important. Now, being ignorant of manuscript tradition and not knowing regional peculiarities my question to scholars on BVP is: Can some one identify from which part of India the number 9 in the last row (No.4) above could have originated.  
  
Thanks
