Pranams to all,

  

I am interested in buying the complete set of 'Lectures on the Ramayana' by by Shri. S. Appalacharyulu. Please provide contact details of book-shop or publisher of this set.

  

I would also like to know if there are any other 'talks on Valmiki Ramayana' by eminent scholars, other than that of S. Appalacharyulu and VS Sreenivasa Sastry.  



regards  
shankara
