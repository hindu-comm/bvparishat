Paturiji,

  

I had seen this preview of the book 'Shodasi', but it seemed to belong to a different genre, not like the discourses of VS Sreenivasa Sastry or S Appalacharyalu. It looks like an esoteric interpretation of Ramayana based on Srividya. Would you recommend it as a good interpretation of Valmiki Ramayana?



regards  
shankara
