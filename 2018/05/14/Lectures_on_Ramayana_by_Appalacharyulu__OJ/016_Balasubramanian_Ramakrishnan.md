May I suggest "Rambles in the Ramayana" by Jnaanaananda bhArati svAmin? It's a delightful little book and was republished a few years back and should be available in Chennai (Jayalakshmi Indological Bookhouse) or<http://www.sringeri.net/2016/02/22/publication/related-publications/rambles-in-the-ramayana.htm>
