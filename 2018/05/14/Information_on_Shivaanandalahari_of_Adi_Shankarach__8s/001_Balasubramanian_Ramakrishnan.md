The only authorship study on the hymns ascribed to Sankara (in general) that I know of is:

  

Robert E. Gussner, "A Stylometric Study of the Authorship of Seventeen Sanskrit Hymns Attributed to Śaṅkara: A Stylometric Study of the Authorship of Seventeen Sanskrit Hymns Attributed to Sankara,"Journal of the American Oriental Society 96 (2):259 (1976)

  

I have read this paper a long time back, I forget whether the shivAnandalaharI is included in this. I can try to search through my files and see if you like. The bottom line of the paper is that he considers only the Daksinamurti stotram as a genuine work.  

  

There is an old paper by Amarnath Ray regarding just the Daksinamurti stotram, which refutes the authorship of Sankara.

  

First of all there are lots of issues in the so called "authorship criteria" proposed by various people, for any of Sankara's texts, not just regarding the hymns. This is true with the so called Hacker criteria, or Swami Satcidanandendra Saraswati's criteria. I can elaborate on this if you wish.
