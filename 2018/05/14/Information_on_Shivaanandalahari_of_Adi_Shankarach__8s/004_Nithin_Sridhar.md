Namaste Ramakrishnan ji,  
  
Thank you for the information. Is the paper available for download in JSTOR? Or can you share a link or something?  
  
I would love to know about more about Hacker's criteria and Sri Satchitananda's criteria.  
----------------  
  
While I was studying Shivaandalahari and comparing to Madhusudana Saraswati's works on Bhakti, I noticed a number of common elements or at least seed ideas which has been elaborated by MS.  
  
I was thus wondering whether it is possible to ascertain with certainty whether Shivaandalahari was composed by Shankaracharya or at least whether it precedes MS.  
  
Regards,  
Nithin
