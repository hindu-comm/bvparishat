Namaste,  

  

I was looking for following information:

  

1\. Has there been any academic study of Shivaanandalahari, especially regarding its dating, authorship and such issues?

  

2\. Are there any traditional commentaries on Shivaanandalahari?  

  

3\. Have any of the Acharyas cited or quoted Shivanandalahari in their works?

  

4\. Is any information available about the manuscripts of the text and the author's name mentioned in the colophons of those manuscripts?  

  

In short, can we use any criteria to determine without doubt whether the text is by Adi Shankaracharya? Or has there been any academic work trying to prove far or against the traditional attribution of Shivaanandalahari to Adi Shankaracharya?

  

Any help will be much appreciated.

  

Regards,

Nithin
