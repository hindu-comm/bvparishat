I came across some resources of evidences showing that the three Abrahamic Religions which are Judaism,Christianity and Islam succeeded each other in time and therefore shared common Inheritance of philosophical religious and spiritual ideas and they , in turn ,succeeded and derived their ideology from Zoroastrianism and Zend Avest,which in turn had, in its origin,a close resemblance and resonance to the Rig Vedic practices ,Philosophy,Spirituality . Is this view acceptable please? I request the learned and knowledgeable Scholars to kindly put forward their valuable views on this possibility please.-CSR Prabhu
