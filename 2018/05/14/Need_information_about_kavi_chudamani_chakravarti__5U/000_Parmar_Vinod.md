Respected Scholars,  
  
I am pursuing my research for Ph.D on a commentary of "Vedastuti" (Bhagavata 10th Skandha) by **Kavi Chudamani Chakravarti**. The title of the commentary is "Anvayaratha bodhini".  
I am not getting any information regarding the author of this commentary. From the characteristics of manuscripts and style of writing, I think he belongs to Bengal.  
If you have any information regarding this, please share with me.  
  
Thank you,  
  
Regards,
