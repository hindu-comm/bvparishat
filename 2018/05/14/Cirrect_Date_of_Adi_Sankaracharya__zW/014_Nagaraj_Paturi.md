To put a stop to this whole discussion, let me state the following:

  

Dates given to Aadi S'ankara in the main stream history writings as on today match with the date followed by Sri Sringeri Math.

  

The main stream history and the dates given by it to several events of Indian past are being contested by several different intellectuals. Most of these give older dates to different events than the dates given by the present main stream. Some of these researches are lead to or lead by the older dates of Aadi S'ankara.

  

Someday some of these alternate history writings may become mainstream. They may not.

  

This forum has no capacity to make any history claim mainstream.

  

Any alternate claim needs to get approved in at least a section of well recognised peers in the field. Once such acceptance happens that acceptance may be shared here.

  

Till then, let us refrain from discussing these issues.

  

Some scholars provided some references. If they are found useful for some for their alternate research, they may use them.

  

With this, this thread is being closed.
