Dear Prof Nagaraj Paturi,

  

Do you think that an impartial research and decision regarding the date of Sri Shankaracharya is not a feasible task?

I thought some research was done to decide that issue. I remember having discussions with one person VidyaShankar Sundareshan. He had sent me a paper he wrote on that subject.

What are your thoughts on that?
