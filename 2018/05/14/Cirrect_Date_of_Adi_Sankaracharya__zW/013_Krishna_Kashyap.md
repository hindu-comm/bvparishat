I have no new research information regarding the date of Sri Shankaracharya.

I just thought someone may have come up with a commonly accepted date of Sri Shankaracharya.

I will try to read what is available to satisfy my curiosity. This is not a casual curiosity. I was really interested to find out to be sure.
