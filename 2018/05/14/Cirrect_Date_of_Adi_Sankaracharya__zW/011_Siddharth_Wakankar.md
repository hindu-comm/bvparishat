I faintly remember that Kulkarni has rejected 7-8 centuries and has proved that Adi Shankara must have flourished before Buddhism vanished from India, otherwise,his attack on Buddha has no sense.He claims that he has based his arguments on the basis of the Vamshaavalees which were

provided by the Mathas.I must go back and refer to it when time permits. His Marathi book,viz.Naval Udelaa Chandaanshu,was his first attempt at dating and it was published somewhere in 1970s.At present,it is not possible for me to search for those books.

Best luck in your efforts to enlighten yourself on this tricky and debatable point.
