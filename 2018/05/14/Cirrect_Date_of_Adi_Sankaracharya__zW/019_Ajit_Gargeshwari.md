Let me clarify and hope this clarification helps 

No I am not

 the list moderator 

. I hope this helps

.

Did I say I am the moderator of the list

?. Anjan Chattopadhyayaji should have known known who are the list moderators before posting on a list

. 

I tried explained the rational why the moderators felt this topic should not be discussed further until there is further main stream research on this topic acceptable to a large group of scholars both within and outside the list. I expected posts like this and the moderators too would have anticipated

 such posts right at the onset of this thread. Thanks again Anjan Chattopadhyaya ji for permitting me to clarify
