I request Scholars to throw light on the Correct Date of Adi Sankaracharya.The text book western scholar given date of 8th century AD appears to be infeasible for many reasons as:1.No References to debates with Islamic and Christian scholars in the life history of Adi Sankaracharya and 2.The lineage displayed in the present day Sankara Mutts as in Puri and other Mutts shoes a date of 490 or 500 BC.
