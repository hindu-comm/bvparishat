Thank you Dr. Mishra Ji for your comments. I agree with your last sentence "

But why not attempt that which is half done ? But fresh evidence has to be adduced'. Hence till fresh evidence has been published in a reviewed journal or book we can with hold all our discussion here on BVP as enough has already been discussed on BVP. All major current dates been discussed in various threads of BVP often with emotional outbursts from members. Hence it is the decision of the moderators team not to allow further discussion but wait for fresh evidence as you have suggested.
