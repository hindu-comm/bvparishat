Dear Kashyap ji,  
  
Are there any fresh material available to start a new discussion? If there is fresh data then there can be fresh research or interpretation. Are there impartial researchers? Who decides who is partial or impartial on dates where myths are involved. Personal inclination preferences over rule evidences if there any evidences to conclusively establish Sri sankaras date.Hence as Prof Paturi has suggested there is no point in running threads unless there are some fresh views or interpretations.  
  
Vidya Shankar Sundershanji has already given his views on this topic. He has sent me a paper that is one among the many views One can read A History of Early Vedanta Philosophy Hajime Nakumara Volume 1, for different views on the subject. You may agree or disagree with Prof. Nakumars' view but you will know what are others scholars views.  
  
Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
