Prof.Kota Venkatachalam Garu, an eminent historian, indologist, scholar and an upaasaka, who ascended Hampi Virupaksha Mutt has also done extensive research on this and presented the order which somewhat is the nearest approximation to Kanchi records.

  

That aside, the great avadhuta shri sadAshiva brahmendra saraswathi, who is respected by one and all, has written 'guru-ratna-maalika' upon the instructions of His guru.

  

On the flip side, we have 'guru-vamsha-kAvya' written by Kasi Lakshmana Sastry which was written upon the instructions of shivabhinava nrisimha bharati mahaswaminaH.

  

Now, whom to believe and whom not to....

  

rgs,

sriram
