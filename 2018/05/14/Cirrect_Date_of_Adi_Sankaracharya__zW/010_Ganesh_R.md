The great scholar samnyaasi Sri. Sacchidaanandendra sarasvati has done tremendous research on Sri Shankara Bhagavatpaada in his monumental Kannada work Sri Shankara bhagavatpaada vrttaanta sarvasva. Here he has discussed the issue of date as well. Even Prof. S. Shreekantha shaastry, MM Kuppusvaamy shasstry, Prof. S. K. Ramachandra Rao have discussed the date of Sri Shankaracharya. A valuable book by Sri. Umesh is also available. Most of them assign first half of seventh century CE as his age. If my memory is right, even Achaarya Baladeva upaadhyaaya and Prof. G. C. Pande agrees with this.
