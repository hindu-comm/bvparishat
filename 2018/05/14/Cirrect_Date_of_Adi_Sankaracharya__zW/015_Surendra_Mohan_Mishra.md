namo vidvadbhyah !

  

Shankara Bhagavatpada has not quoted from the Sankhya sutras but has quoted from and repudiated the Sankhyakarika of Ishvarakrishna mainly at II.2.

If Ishvarakrishna'a time is around the beginning of CE, then Shankara could be assigned a time only after that of Ishvarakrishna. What texts of the Sankhya system Buddha studied under the teacher Arad as depicted in the Ashvaghosha remains to be established.

  

It never appears that Shankara had even any faint idea of Islamic advent. But Sankhya and Buddhists are his main opponents. Buddhism withered in it's influence only after 12th CE following the Nalanda tragedy.

  

But standing by 5th and 6th century and holding that Shankara follows Buddha just by a few years, at least at the present stage of historical research, seems far fetched !

  

The generations that are counted upon in the Mutts are reverential and certainly can't stand the scrutiny of logic. How can you accept in research that Gaudapada followed Shuka?

  

Shankara's works are to be critically examined for all possible interpolations and doctoring for various intents carried out over the centuries after the great master.

Even the bhaashyam on Apashudradhikarana seems to be tampered with some ulterior motive. Internal evidence could signal out certain connections with ideas and persons that might establish Shankara in his time that we are yet to ascertain.

  

But why not attempt that which is half done ? But fresh evidence has to be adduced.

  

Regards.
