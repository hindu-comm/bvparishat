The verse is a homage paid to Sri Adi Shankara by Sri Sureshwaracharya at the end of his Brihadaranyaka Upanishad Bhashya Vartika:

  

आशैलादुदयात्तथास्तगिरितो भास्वद्यशोरश्मिभिः  
व्याप्तं विश्वमनन्धकारमभवद्यस्य स्म शिष्यैरिदम् ।  
आराज्ज्ञानगभस्तिभिः प्रतिहतश्चन्द्रायते भास्करः  
तस्मै शङ्करभानवे तनुमनोवाग्भिर्नमस्तात्सदा ॥  
  

- वार्त्तिककाराः श्रीभगवत्पादेभ्यः ।  

  

\[The rays that is the fame of the disciples Sanandanacharya and others of Sri Sri Bhagavatpadacharya pervading the entire expanse between the Eastern and the Western horizons, dispel the ignorance of the competent seekers who surrender; while the rays of knowledge emanating from Sri Sri Bhagavatpadacharya, verily the Supreme Consciousness Itself, pervade the entire universe, as exposed to which even the brightest physical object, the Sun, pales into insignificance appearing like the Moon,. Obeisance be always to this Supreme Effulgence, the Master, through deed, word and thought. \]

  

Taken from the p,587 of the Second volume of Sridakshinamurti stotram authored by Sri D.S.Subbaramaiya and published by the Sringeri Sharada Peetham, 1990.
