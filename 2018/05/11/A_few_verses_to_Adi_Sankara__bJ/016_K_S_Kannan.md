What Sri Rajput says is technically right. Yes, it is not *yAdRcchika*.

But one may also look into what is commonly presented, &/or more easily comprehensible + transparent.

  

It is not wrong to say *tayAsan* (for *te + Asan*);

but *ta Asan* is more common/more quickly comprehensible.

So with *dadA udakam* is not wrong;

but *dadAvudakam* is more used.

So with *harayiha*, though the more common presentation is *hara iha.*

(I am referring to cases of *ayAdi-sandhi*).

  

Further, upon *sandhi* or otherwise, space between words is also often considered optional in writing/printing;

but does not giving space help, and make it more easily comprehensible?

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

This apart, Sri Rajput has often used the word *vArtikA*, with a long *A* at the end.

Is the word right? (Of course, in the sense of a quail, it no doubt is, as is *vartikA* also).

But is not *vArttika* (Neuter) the right word?
