Dear Prof. Prabhu garu,

  

The thread is dedicated to the announcement of a great Aacharya Swami's attainment of Acharyan Thiruvadi.

  

Let us pay our obeisances to the great swami and seek the blessings of Srimannarayana for his sadgati.

  

You may start a new thread for other topics.

  

With deep regards,
