Dear MVSSP Agni,

  

Sanskrit does not have prepositions.

  

If you have equivalents of English prepositions in mind, they are in the form of case marker suffixes called vibhaktipratyayas.

  

In English , prepositions are the case markers.

  

Vibhaktipratyayas mark gender, number and case at the same time in Sanskrit since Sanskrit is an inflectional language.

  

If you have prefixes in mind, they are called upasargas.
