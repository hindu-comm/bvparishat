To expand the terminology used in linguistic descriptions, there are pre-positions, post-positions and ambi-positions \[those that can be used either in pre- or post- positions\]. The closest items in Sanskrit to prepositions in English are the so-called Karmapravacanīya items, though they are generally used as post positions, i.e. "grāmam prati" \[in normal prose order\]. The Upasargas when they appear pre-positionally are compounded with the verb roots. Pāṇini uses the term Samāsa for a combination like ā+gatya \[ref: samāse 'nañ-pūrve ktvo lyap\]. Generally, the items that are pre- or post- positions are not so compounded. There are prefixed items in English like con-, de-, in- etc. found in forms like "conclude, include, exclude", but in the common understanding of English, these forms are not analysed as con+clude, in+clude, ex+clude, by setting up a verb-root "clude". In a Sanskrit-like analysis of English, such forms could possibly be explained as upasarga+verb combinations.
