I request the learned scholars of the forum to discuss

  

1\. Whether there are prepositions in Sanskrit

  

2\. What are the Sanskrit equivalents of English prepositions ?

  

3\. Are avyayas of Sanskrit, equivalent of English prepositions?

  

4\. Are there some Sanskrit avyayas which are equivalents of some English prepositions?

  

5\. Are there some avyayas which can be given the name of "prepositions" irrespective of the concept of prepositions in English?

  

I understand that if prepositions in English are to be put into one of the Sanskrit grammatical categories of नाम,आख्यात, अव्यय ,they fall under अव्यय.

  

But my understanding is that , that does not make avyayas of Sanskrit as "prepositions" or equivalent of English prepositions.

  

Can किन्तु ,परन्तु , अपि ,च, etc be given the name of "prepositions" as per English grammar or irrespective of the concept of prepositions in English?
