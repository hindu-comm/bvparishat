In response to the questions put forth by Shri. Nagraj Paturi, some free-wheeling thoughts =>

  

If Preposition means that, which has a previous position, then प्रादयः (1'4'58) and उपसर्गाः क्रियायोगे (1'4'59) have such "pre" position.

However, in Sanskritप्रादयः andउपसर्गाः are combined / mixed into the word, though in Vedic texts one often finds them separated and even placed in the "after" position,which is endorsed by छन्दसि परेऽपि (1'4'81)

  

In Sanskrit more than oneप्रादयः orउपसर्गाः may be used together., e.g. व्यभिचारः (वि+अभि+चारः) Same two prepositions may be used by interchange of their positions, e.g. अभिविज्वलन्ति (अभि+वि+ज्वलन्ति).

  

Actuallyप्रादयः andउपसर्गाः are prefixes, rather than prepositions. There are prefixes is English also, e.g. inject, eject, reject, project, deject, subject, object, abject

  

In English "Prepositions" are distinct stand-alone words. The concept of "position" of words is a matter of syntax. Since Sanskrit has total freedom of syntax, the question of position of words "Pre" or "After" becomes irrelevant.

  

Yet, certain stand-alone words in Sanskrit, especially the अव्यय-s, do have syntactical significance, e.g. अपि कृतं तत्त्वया ? तदपि कृतं त्वया ! or तत् कृतमपि त्वया ! Position ofअपि does bring forth significant change in the meaning.

  

Just now I used the word "Yet" at the beginning of the sentence, at the prior-most position. Sanskrit equivalent would be तथापि. In Sanskrit also it would be good to use the word at the beginning, e.g. तथापि त्वं महाबाहो नैवं शोचितुमर्हसि So, if "Yet" andतथापि are equivalents, they would be equivalents both by meaning and by syntactical position.
