Respected Members,

I am aware that a good number among the members, can competently handle coding and app development. This request is directed to them.

I have a java program (of about 1000 lines) in the area of Sanskrit Chandas. I would like to make it user-friendly by enabling it to be launched under Windows as a self-executed app. As I do not have competence in this area I need help to do this.

Experts in this matter who can spare some time for me may contact me directly by Email.

I shall be posting this request in {Sanskrit} group also and I apologize for cross posting.

Thanks and warm regards,

GSS Murthy
