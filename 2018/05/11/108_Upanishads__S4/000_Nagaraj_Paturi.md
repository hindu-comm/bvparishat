While there exist 108 Upanishads,only 11 received popularity.Balance Upanishads also are equally important.They cover Yoga,Tantra,Upasana of Devatas as Narayana,Shiva,Shakti.I am interested to invite and interact with any one who is already interested and has done background in these Upanishads

One may consult the following papers for some observations on the minor Upanishads

‘The origin of the catushkaaya doctrine’, ‘The catushkaaya doctrine in the Mantranaya’ Journal of Research, Visva Bharati 1976-77 and 1977-78 and ‘The doctrine of four in the early Upanishads and some connected problems’, Journal of Indian Philosophy, Dordrecht
