Namaste,

  

I was replying to subbuji's statement 'but some take it as part of aranyaka and not of the samhita'.

  

In any case, also need the authentic source for 'TS 1.8.6.i; VS 3.60'.

  

Because, I have completed the Taittiriya Aranyaka Bhaga (in complete) and Samhita Bhaga (partially) and couldn't find the mriyunjaya mantra in samhita portions.

  

Authentic source is highly appreciated.

  

rgs,

sriram
