Dear Professor Bhatt,

  

  Some of the Padapāṭhas accept the iva-samāsa, and others don't, and that makes difference not only how the Pādapāṭhas of the particular Vedic Saṃhitās are formed, but also make difference in the other Pāṭhas like, Krama, Jaṭā, Ghana etc. The iva-samāsa is not uniformly accepted by all Vedic traditions.
