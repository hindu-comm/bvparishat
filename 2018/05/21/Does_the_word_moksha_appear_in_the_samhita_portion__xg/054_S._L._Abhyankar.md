I think that although the term पद applies also to thecomponents of a compound word, the term पदपाठः should apply to doing सन्धिविच्छेद-s of only बाह्य-संधि-s and not of अन्तःसन्धि-s. Especially in respect of बहुव्रीहि-compounds, it does not help to doसन्धिविच्छेद-s of their अन्तःसन्धि-s, because बहुव्रीहि-compounds are अन्यपदप्रधान.

  

Doingसन्धिविच्छेद-s ofअन्तःसन्धि-s incompound words would makeपदपाठ-recitation quite awkward, most of the times.
