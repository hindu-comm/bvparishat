Dear Shripad Ji,

  

  While you are describing how the term Padapāṭha "should" apply to something, traditionally the Padapāṭhas are fixed by ancient authorities like Śākalya and continued in the recitational tradition till today. In that sense, the Padapāṭha is a fixed text and not left to the desire of the reciter. For compounds, the traditional Padapāṭha does separate the padas. Professor V. N. Jha's book, mentioned in his message earlier, discusses all the features of analysis seen in the traditional Padapāṭha.
