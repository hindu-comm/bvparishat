Respected Prof. Deshpande ji,

Thank you for some new references and your inputs. It's enlightening to me.

But, at the same time, i would like to know your opinion ( which is related with those mantras, with padpaatha and without padapaatha ) about पदप्रकृतिः संहिता । How to dissolve the compound ? ( Bhatrihari also has a dilemma:- पदानां संहिता योनिः, संहिता वा पदाश्रया । ) so, if we take Bahuvrihi in पदप्रकृतिः, then padapaatha of the Rigveda stands first ! In this situation there shouldn't be any mantra without Padapaatha !

( I may have committed a mistake in understanding the present problem. )

Regards and thanks

Vasantkumar M.Bhatt
