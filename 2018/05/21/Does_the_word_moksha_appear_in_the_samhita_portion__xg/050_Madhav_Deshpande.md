Also consult the Aitareya-Āraṇyaka (3.1.3) for perhaps the oldest discussion on the relationship between Saṃhitā and the Padapāṭha, referred to with older terms Nirbhuja-Saṃhitā amd Pratr̥ṇṇa-Saṃhitā. I have discussed some of these issues in detail in the introduction to my book "RECITATIONALPERMUTATIONSOFTHE ŚAUNAKĪYA ATHARVAVEDA" published by Harvard University Press (pp. iv-vi). Best,
