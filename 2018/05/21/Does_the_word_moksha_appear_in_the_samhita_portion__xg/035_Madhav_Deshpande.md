The Taittirīya Padapāṭha for स न: पितेव सूनवे does not have iva-samāsa, and reads: स: । न: । पिता । इव । सूनवे । \[TS 1.5.6\]. On the other hand, the R̥gveda Padapāṭha for the same line \[RV 1.1.9\] reads: स: । न: । पिताऽइव । सूनवे ।. The Śukla Yajurveda Padapāṭha accepts the iva-samāsa, like the RV Padapāṭha. It may be noted that the iva-samāsa is prescribed by Kātyāyana's Vārttika: इवेन नित्यसमासो विभक्त्यलोपश्च, and not by Pāṇini's Sūtras. The Prātiśākhya of the Śukla-Yajurveda is also ascribed to a Kātyāyana, and at least some scholars like Paul Thieme have argued that these two Kātyāyanas are one and the same.
While Patañjali claims that the authors of the Padapāṭhas should follow grammarians, and not the other way around \[पदकारैर्लक्षणमनुवर्त्यम्, न लक्षणेन पदकारा:, MBh\], not all Padapāṭhas follow identical rules.
