We can't simply assume that some mantras are added after compilation of samhitas, hence no padapatha.

What would have prevented vedic pandit from adding padaptha to few mantras, when he is capable of adding mantras themselves.

  

It seems, we lost them at some stage, after which no one dared to add it. It is more possible explanation.
