Thanks, David, for this information. I have the editions of the Āśvalāyana Śākhā of RV by Chaubey and Amal Dhari Singh Gautam's edition of the Śāṃkhāyana Śākhā of the RV, and Viśvabandhu's edition and the edition by Vaidika Samśodhana Mandala. As you have noted, while Viśvabandhu's edition silently provides the Padapāṭha for the 6 verses, where the VSM edition does not. Chaubey may have followed Vishvabandhu's practice. It is important to find out what was truly done by Śākalya. Other than the six verses that do not have the Padapāṭha, repeated verses in the RV do not have Padapāṭha and they are called Galitas. The Galitas are specifically marked in manuscripts, and there are texts like Galitapradīpa that specifically deal with this phenomenon. I have to see if Vishvabandhu's edition of RV fills in Padapāṭha for these Galitas as well. Needs some detective work, and access to manuscripts. The Atharvaveda manuscripts that I have studied specifically mark the Galitas.
