Dear Professor Bhatt,

  

  As you have pointed out, even Bhartr̥hari gives two opposite views on the meaning of padaprakr̥tiḥ saṃhitā. If you accept the view expressed by संहिता वा पदाश्रया, then of course, for the upholders of this view, there cannot be a saṃhitā without a Padapāṭha. In my person opinion, the Saṃhitā formation occurred earlier, and then, perhaps by the same compiler like Śākalya, the analytic tool of Padapāṭha was was created. However, as Bronkhorst has argued, the addition of a few mantras to the Saṃhitā continued after the formation of the Padapāṭha, probably due to the ritual importance of these six mantras. In any case, the formation of Saṃhitā by someone like Śākalya involved selection and organization of the mantras that were previously transmitted by the individual R̥ṣis or their families and descendants.
In this process, not all the existing mantras were included. Some of the R̥ks found in the Yajurveda and Sāmaveda are not included in Śākalya's R̥k-Saṃhitā. Also, we now have in our possession, the R̥k-Saṃhitās of Āśvalāyana and Śāṃkhāyana, which slightly differ from Śākalya's Saṃhitā. With the discovery of these two alternative Saṃhitās of the R̥gveda, it is clear that the transmission of the R̥gveda was diversified like the transmission of the other Vedas. We also hear of the Śaiśirīya, Māṇḍūkeya and Baṣkala Saṃhitās of the R̥gveda, though they are now lost. I have paid more attention to the Saṃhitā of the Śaunakīya Atharvaveda in my own work, and have discussed how and in what stages this Saṃhitā grew in size.
