Does the word 'moksha' appear in the samhita portions?  

  

Namaste

  

Someone on the net is raising this question and saying 'only 'amrtatvam' is there in the veda; the term 'moksha' is a later one in the Upanishads', which, according to him is a later addition.

  

  

Is there evidence to show that the term 'moksha', even in forms like 'muchyate', etc. is found in the samhita (non-upanishad) portions?

  

warm regards
