Regarding the six verses of the Ṛgveda, Śākala/Śākalya śākhā, that are not given in its padapāṭha, 7.59.12, 10.20.1,10.121.10, 10.190.1-3: All six of these are given in the padapāṭha in the printed editions of the two other Ṛgveda śākhās that have recently become available, the Āśvalāyana śākhā and the Śāṃkhāyana śākhā. The editor of the Āśvalāyana śākhā, B. B. Chaubey, has stated (p. 57) that its padapāṭha uses a different method of marking the separation of compounds than does the Śākalya padapāṭha. Likewise, the editor of the Śāṃkhāyana śākhā, Amal Dhari Singh Gautam, has stated (p. xxv) that its padapāṭha uses a different method of marking the separation of compounds than does the Śākalya padapāṭha. So these two padapāṭhas did not merely copy the Śākalya padapāṭha. The question now is whether the padapāṭha for these six verses was added by the editors of these two śākhās, or whether the padapāṭha for these six verses is found in the padapāṭha manuscripts they used.



B. B. Chaubey used 16 manuscripts of the Āśvalāyana padapāṭha for his edition, and Amal Dhari Singh Gautam used 17 manuscripts of the Śāṃkhāyana padapāṭha for his edition. B. B. Chaubey specifically says (p. 57) that he supplied the padapāṭha for the 212 verses not found in the Śākalya śākhā. These did not have padapāṭha in the padapāṭha manuscripts he used. Amal Dhari Singh Gautam does not say whether he added the padapāṭha for any verses, as far as I could see. There is a precedent for silently adding the padapāṭha where it is missing: Vishva Bandhu's edition of the Ṛgveda added the padapāṭha for the six verses of the Śākalya śākhā that did not have it, making no mention of this fact.



So, it seems that someone who has access to the Āśvalāyana padapāṭha manuscripts and the Śāṃkhāyana padapāṭha manuscripts will have to check these to see if they have the padapāṭha for the six verses that lack it in the Śākalya padapāṭha.
