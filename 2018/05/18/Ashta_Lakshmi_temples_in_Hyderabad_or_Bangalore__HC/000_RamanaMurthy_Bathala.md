Dear Sir,

  

My relatives need to visit three different Ashtha Lakshmi temples.

They have already visited Ashta Lakshmi temple in Kothapet, Hyderabad.

I request you to please let me know any other Astha Lakshmi temples in Hyderabad or Bangalore.

  

The requirement is the there should be separate idols for all the eight Ashthalakshmis.

The older temple is more preferable to the newly constructed one.

  

Please share the info if you have.

  

Regards

Ramana murthy
