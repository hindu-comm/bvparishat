Respected Scholars,  
  

Prof S K Ramachandra Rao in his Agama Encyclopaedia, Vol 1 quotes the following shloka from Yogachudamani Upanishad:  
  
षट् श्तानि दिवारात्रौ सहस्राणेय्कविंशतिः  
तत्र संख्यान्वितं मन्त्रं जीवॊ जपति सर्वदा II  
हकारॆण बहिर्याति सकारेण विशेत पुनः  
हंसात्मिकां भगवतीं जीवॊ जपति सर्वदा II  
सॊहं हंसं पदेनैव जीवॊ जपति सर्वदा  
  

(P. No. 100)  
  

I am unable to locate these verses in the copy uploaded on Sanskritdocuments.org. Please guide me as to the correct source of this verse and help.  
  

Are there any other upanishads/tantra texts which gives the number of respiration as 21, 600?  
  

Is there any other number referred to as the number of breaths a person takes in a day?  
  

Kindly guide  
  

with regards
