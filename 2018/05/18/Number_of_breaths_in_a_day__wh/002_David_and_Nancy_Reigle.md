Dear Dr Soumya Kumar,

  

These lines (except the last one) are from verses 31-33 of the Yogachudamani Upanishad (in reverse order), as found in the Adyar Library edition of the Yoga Upanishads, p. 343.

  

The same idea is also found in the Hamsa Upanishad, verse 11, in the Adyar Library edition of the Yoga Upanishads, p. 565.

  

The idea of 21,600 breaths in a day and night is also found in the Buddhist Kalacakra-tantra and its related texts. See, for example, the Sekoddesa, verses 44 and 112 (<http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/6_sastra/3_phil/buddh/narsekou.htm>), and Naropa's Sekoddesa-tika, 1941 edition, p. 1 (<http://www.downloads.prajnaquest.fr/BookofDzyan/Sanskrit%20Buddhist%20Texts/sekoddesa_tika_1941.pdf>).

  

Best regards,

  

David Reigle

Colorado, U.S.A.
