The theme and subject matter covered in Avadhuta Gita (attributed to Dattatreya)tallies well with those of higher Advaita texts such as Ashtavakra Gita and Ribhu Gita,Yoga Vasishta and even many works of Adi Sankaracharya and Vidyaranya.I feel this text Avadhuta Gita is the pinnacle of declaration of Pure Advaitic Experience.Swami Vivekananda also commented on a he same lines about this text . I request and invite comments from learned Scholars on the theme of Avadhuta Gita .
