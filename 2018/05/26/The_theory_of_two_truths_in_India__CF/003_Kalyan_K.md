Dear Sri Venkatraghavan  
  
The chhAndogya upanishad that you quoted, does not talk about two truths, which are samvriti or vyavaharika satya and paramArthika satya. It is also a passage that is open to interpretations. Where as you can observe that someone like Nagarjuna makes explicit mention of two truths in MMK.  
  
Regards  
Kalyan
