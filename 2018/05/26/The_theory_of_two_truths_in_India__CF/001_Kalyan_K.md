Also from wikipedia-  
  
<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_truths_doctrine>  
  
The best known interpretation is from the Madhyamaka school of Mah훮y훮na Buddhism, whose founder was Nagarjuna,\[1\] For Nagarjuna, the two truths are epistemological truths. The phenomenal world is accorded a provisional existence. The character of the phenomenal world is declared to be neither real nor unreal, but logically indeterminable. Ultimately, phenomena are empty (sunyata) of an inherent self or essence, but exist depending on other phenomena (Prat카tyasamutp훮da).\[1\]  
  
  
The Jain philosopher Kundakunda was influenced by Nagarjuna to develop a Jain version of the theory of two truths.\[54\]  
  
Advaita took over from the Madhyamika the idea of levels of reality.\[57\]
