Dear Sri Venkatraghavan  
  
  
//The words of the mantra - मृत्तिका इति एव सत्यं - the pot is real only as the clay - is indicative of the two realities. There is one commonly accepted reality assigned to names and forms, and one reality as the cause which is ultimately real. The use of एव (only) in the shruti is the critical word to be noted.//  
  
The chhAndogya is reducing all objects to their essences. It is not talking of two truths. However if you think it is talking of 2 truths, let us respectfully agree to disagree, since I am looking for an explicit mention of 2 truths doctrine, like what Nagarjuna does and not a cryptic statement that has diverse interpretations.  
  
Regards  
Kalyan
