The two truths doctrine is well established in the Upanishads and smritis with and without the words 'paramarthika-vyavaharika' and it is clear that Buddhism has borrowed it along with several other concepts from the Upanishads.

The above Karika of Nagarjuna contains the Mandukya Upanishad 7th mantra words: prapanchopashamam and shivam. Thus we can clearly see that it is a case of 'lifting from Vedanta.'. Having lifting from Vedanta not only the final siddhanta of prapanchopashamam of the Vedanta, they have also borrowed the concept of vyavaharika and paramarthika that is well prevalent and deep rooted in the Upanishads, Mahabharata, Vishnu Purana, etc.
