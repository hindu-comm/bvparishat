Even just neti neti mantra is sufficient to explain two levels of realities, since prAptasyaiva niShedhaH. Since something else is taken as a reality and therefore the negation to land into what is really real. Even if Advaitins are said to have interpreted it in that manner, there is no denying that most philosophers consider the state of mokSha as a different reality than bondage, be it Vedantins, other Astikas or Jainas. Therefore, the accusation that it is borrowed from Buddhism is out of place as it doesn't take away the fact that the Upanishad itself talks of negation. Why indeed then isn't "negating everything" not borrowed by Buddhism from Vedas?
