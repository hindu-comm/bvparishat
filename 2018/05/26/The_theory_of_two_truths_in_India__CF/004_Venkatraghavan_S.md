Namaste Sri Kalyan,

Indeed it does. The words of the mantra - मृत्तिका इति एव सत्यं - the pot is real only as the clay - is indicative of the two realities. There is one commonly accepted reality assigned to names and forms, and one reality as the cause which is ultimately real. The use of एव (only) in the shruti is the critical word to be noted.

  

The word 'only' presupposes a multiplicity of real entities in the mind of the hearer, which the shruti wishes to negate and conclude that there is only one reality ultimately.

  

There may be other explanations offered to this mantra by different schools, but that does not preclude advaita deriving the idea of different levels of reality from shruti statements such as this.

  

However, even if the idea of a gradation of reality was postulated by some other school, as long as it is consistent with shruti (ie no shrutahAni ashrutakalpanA), there is no harm accepting it. Shankara himself has said this when talking about yoga darshana.  

  

Regards,

Venkatraghavan
