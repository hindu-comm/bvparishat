Namaste Sri Kalyan ji,

Sure, we can stop the discussion here.

  

However, as you seem to view reducing objects to their essences as being different to pAramArthika satya, it would be helpful if you can present your understanding of the terms vyAvahArika satya and pAramArthika satya as postulated by advaita.

  

It would also be helpful if you can interpret the words नैतद् बुद्धेन भाषितम् in the mANDUkya kArika - what was the teaching that GaudapAda referred to as not having been taught by the SAkyamuni?

  

Regards,

Venkatraghavan
