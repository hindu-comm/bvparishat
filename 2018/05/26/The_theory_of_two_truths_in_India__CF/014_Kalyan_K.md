//The above Karika of Nagarjuna contains the Mandukya Upanishad 7th mantra words: prapanchopashamam and shivam. Thus we can clearly see that it is a case of 'lifting from Vedanta.'.//  
  
To prove that Nagarjuna "lifted from vedanta", you have to prove that the Mandukya upanishad is pre-Nagarjuna, which is by no means accepted universally.
