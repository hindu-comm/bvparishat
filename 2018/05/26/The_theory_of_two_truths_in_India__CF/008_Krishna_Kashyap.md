The prominent BrhadAranyaka upanishad which states "satyasya satyam".

  

the full verse :

6.  tasya haitasya puruṣasya rūpam yathā māhārajanaṁ vāsaḥ, yathā
    pāṇḍv-āvikam, yathendragopaḥ, yathāgnyarciḥ, yathā puṇḍarīkam, yathā
    sakṛd-vidyuttam; sakṛd-vidyutteva ha vā asya śrīr bhavati, ya evaṁ
    veda. athāta ādeśaḥ na iti na iti, na hy etasmād iti, na ity anyat
    param asti; atha nāma-dheyaṁ satyasya satyam iti. prāṇā vai satyam,
    teṣām eṣa satyam.

  

  

Is convincing enough to prove that there is this 2 level truth. you donthave to go into minor or later or whatever upanishads. here Prana is interpreted as Jiva in some bhashyas. Obviously the absolute truth is not a superimposition of anyone's views on Upanishads. it is there in the Upanishads itself.

  

this is objectively true.

  

Like how KSV my teacher says, how can there be uniform truth?

  

donttell me you want to see the same old N.Korea USA tension up in Vaikunta?

You dontwant to see stinking garbage in Vaikunta! either.

  

Obviously even for any kind of buddhism, which accepts sarvam duhkhamayam,and at the same time accept " nibbAnamparamam sukham - Dhammapada", there has to be 2 level truth.

  

This is a need for any system.

  

I each system these 2 level truths may be dealth with in a different way as per their own principles and historical issues.

  

2 level truth has to be vaidika.

  

But the relation between these states and is one a precursor or cause of the other? etc. are viewed differently in different schools. The devil is in the details!
