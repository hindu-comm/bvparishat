Dear Rajputji,

  

  You have brought out an important historical issue, namely the wide gap between the strict requirements of Pāṇinian grammar and the practice of writing seen in the manuscripts. It is clear that the strict rules of Pāṇini were not always followed by the writers of manuscripts. The 22 manuscripts of the Śaunakīya Caturādhyāyikā that I used for my edition of this text do not follow the rules laid out by this very text. The manuscripts of the Vikr̥tis of the Atharvaveda that I used for my edition show the same gap between theory and practice. Coming to modern times, leaving gaps between some Sanskrit words but not between others also shows a wide gap between theory and practice. The reasons for this gap need to be seriously investigated. But the existence of the gap is indeed a historical fact. I am glad to see that you demonstrated this point by giving a scan of the manuscript of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. If the writing of manuscripts shows such a gap, surely a similar gap must have existed between the theory and the oral practice. With best wishes,
