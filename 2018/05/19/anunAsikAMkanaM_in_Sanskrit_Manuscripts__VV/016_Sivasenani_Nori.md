Sirs

  

One aspect to be noted is that historically writing was not fashionable amongst the learned. A well-read person was a "bahuSruta". Even upto my grandfather's time, writing was a sort of lowly skill: he would dictate poems etc. and one of the many children or sishyas around would write. It was fairly common that a beginner intending to study any grantha would be first asked to make a copy \*before\* he is taught that grantha. Then we had till two generations back, illiterate Vedic scholars! If we compare the sophistication of thought and the primitiveness of writing in contemporaneous edicts etc. it will become clear that the learned would not deign to write. This is very pronounced in Telugu where the not-famous writings in temple walls etc. and incomplete attempts at writing on rocks etc. are so full of mistakes (say Narasimha written as the Telugu equivalent of नरसिंम्म) that modern day shop signs painted by ill-educated painters look like they belong to a different, advanced culture. Yet the reality is that modern Telugu usage does not have the same force, beauty or precision of expression as the older usage. My submission, therefore, is that samples of manuscript writing available today should not be taken as representative of SishTavyavahaara of yore.
