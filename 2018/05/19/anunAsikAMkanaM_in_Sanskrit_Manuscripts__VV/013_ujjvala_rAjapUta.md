It should be clearly understood, however, that whether we write अङ्किता or अंकिता, the rule of Panini, which refers to pronunciation and not to writing, is equally absolute, and that in the middle of a word the only nasals that can be sounded before k, kh, g, gh, c, ch, j, jh, ṭ, ṭh, ḍ, ḍh, t, th, d, dh, p, ph, b, bh, are the nasals of the five classes to which these consonants belong (ङ्, ञ्, ण्, न्, म्). The dot, therefore, used in writing and printing is here a mere graphic substitute for these five nasals, and in no way to be confounded with the dot as the sign of the Anusvara.
