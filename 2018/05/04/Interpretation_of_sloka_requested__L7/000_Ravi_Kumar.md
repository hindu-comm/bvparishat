Hari Om

  

Namaskar to all

  

The following is the verse in question:

  

**मार्गे चेतः स्थिरीभूते हेयेऽपि विषयेच्छया ।**

**प्रेर्यं तेनानयेत्तावद्यावत्पदमनामयम् ॥**

  

This has been translated by one translator as follows:

  

**"If the mind of a sadhaka is stabilized in the way which is avoidable with a view to enjoy it, he should continue to check it till he obtains the place free from diseases and worries."**

  

Another translator gives the following reading:

  

**"It is the joy of enjoyment of worldlyobjects which keeps attracted the human mind to things which indeed need to be forsaken. Hence the pleasant needs to be incorporated in the way to the highest beatitude but only upto the attainment of that final goal."**

  

The verse seems to have been interpreted in practically opposite ways by the translators.(Let us disregard the simpleerrors of grammar/usage in the translations.)

  

I request scholars here to kindly show the proper (natural) interpretation of the sloka.

  

sincerely,

ravi kumar
