There is a mention of 'vinayakaah' in plural in Srimadbhagavatam too when Putana was felled by Krishna, the Gopis 'cleansed' the baby Krishna to rid him of the ashuchi due to contacting the demoness. The Gopis use the word vinaayakaah - let all these evil spirits leave the baby. There is another instance of the word's usage in the Bhagavatam itself.
