The Kau;sikasuutra is available with a Hindi translation at Chaukhamba; for Bloomfield’s edition with excerpts from commentaries one has to enquire; but a Vaidika Samsodhana Mandala edition with Daarila’s commentary too is available; the Vaitaanasuutra was brought out with Somaaditya’s commentary by the VVRI; of the Nakshatrakalpa a Devnagari version of Negelein’s edition in the Roman script was available a few years ago.
