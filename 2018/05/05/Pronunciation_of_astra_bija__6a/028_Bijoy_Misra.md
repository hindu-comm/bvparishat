Dr. Bhat and Dr. Deshpande,

  

This would have to do with how one trains one's oral muscles while learning to speak.

There is a "mother tongue" effect learned as a baby. In principle it can be re-coded by

training and practice. Oral muscles also affect breathing. Mechanical articulation with

conscious effort would help in getting the "inner" resonance. This "inner" effect in expression

is what we are exploring. It is neural and electrical in nature.

  

The other way would be to imitate the sound to recite. This is a skill and not the

articulation with conscious effort. It would be confined to the material in the recitation.

  

We are working on the model.

  

Thank you.

Bijoy.
