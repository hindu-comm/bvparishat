Dear Dr. Bhat,

  

  I am not saying that the regional pronunciation of Sanskrit is correct or incorrect. All I am saying is that in spite of a common alphabet or a common theoretical reliance upon the Śikṣās, the regional pronunciation tends to be different. My point is that selecting a certain alphabet does not guarantee the performance of pronunciation.
For a correct pronunciation, one may have to stick to oral instruction, and not rely upon the writing system. But if the oral performance in different regions is different, then what do we do? I hope that clarifies what I am suggesting.
