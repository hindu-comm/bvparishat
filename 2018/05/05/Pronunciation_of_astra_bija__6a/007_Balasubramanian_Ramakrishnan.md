I am not that familiar with the pANini sutras. However the sUtras defining Asya (not part of pANini) has upUpadhmAnIbhyAmoShThau. So it’s not just in the Veda that the visarga is pronounced as ‘f’ before the pakAra and phakAra. I’ll send the sUtras from The taittirIya prAtishAkhya later.

  

BTW, the Challakere brothers recitations are extremely good.
