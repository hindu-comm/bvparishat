I was travelling. Hence the delayin my response.

  

\> I would ask you what your objective here is

  

  

---- I have no other objective than responding to the question from the thread initiator and then clarifying my response every time such a clarification was necessitated.

  

I said there is no f sound in Sanskrit.

  

In your recent post, you too agreed, " yes, there is no f sound in the Sanskrit,"

  

Is it a theoretical analysis of what it's supposed to be vis-a-vis what happens in English or to actually learn how to enunciate. If it is the latter, I suggest going to competent Vedic pundits and learning from them by \*imitating\* them.  

  

--- I am born and brought up in a culture of being in the thick of Veda recitation. I have been doing my fieldwork based research on several strands of Indian culture through methods such as participant observation. I have been curiously spending long conversations with Veda pundits, somayaajis and other such living practitioners of whatever is left of the chhaandasa /s'rauta life.

  

Purpose of Vedaangas is to protect the pronunciation of the Veda from getting corrupted.

  

At least among Telugu speakers, I regularly hear falam for phalam, falitam for phalitam etc. This is influence of Urdu and/or English.

  

When that kind of influence spreads to Veda reciting persons such as priests, if an observer points out to them that this wrong, and if they dispute that correction, the guide or the reference point is s'kshaa granthas.

  

Now that we all agree that falam for phalam, falitam for phalitam etc., and astraaya fut etc., are mistakes committed because of influence of
Urdu and/or English, no further discussion on this is required.
