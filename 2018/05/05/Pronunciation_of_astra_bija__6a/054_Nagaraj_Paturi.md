Did you notice that it is being denoted by pʰ and
[**ফ**ল](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_script "Bengali script")is the example?

  

' f ' is being mentioned here only as an allophone , which means an alternative phone found in other circumstances (other kinds of positions in a word in the same language), that too an allophone in languages heavily influenced by Perso-Arabic languages, not Sanskrit.
