Namaste



On \< **कुप्वोः** **ख़फ़ौ** **च** **८.३.३७** > -



Can you please re-check on the original reading and voicing of
Paniniya Sutra (8-3-37) : Is the rule yielding alpa-prana or mahaaprana OR the nukta marked Maha-prana ?



What is the force of ‘cha’ ?



What is the tradition ? ( Not the DIGITIZED ISCII/ UNICODE SYMBOL ?)



How would one pronounce - **।** **बालख़्करोति। - वृक्षफ़्फलति। with Nukta ? **





Please see the reference text

Incorrect Scripted Text ( in Digital domain, pushed for group circulation causes greater harm than inaccurate pronunciation).
