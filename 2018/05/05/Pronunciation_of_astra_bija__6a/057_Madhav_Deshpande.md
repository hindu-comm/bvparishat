Dear Shri Ramakrishnan,

  

  In the native \[American English, British English\] pronunciation, "f" is labio-dental in both "feel" and "free". In Indian pronunciation, English 'f' is sometimes pronounced like फ. In any case, the upadhmānīya is not labio-dental. This is what the Śikṣās etc. say: उपूपध्मानीयानामोष्ठौ. It is a bilabial fricative. With best wishes,

  

Madhav Deshpande
