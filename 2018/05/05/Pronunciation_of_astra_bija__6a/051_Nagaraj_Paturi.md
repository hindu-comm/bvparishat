---------

  

minimum meaningful unit of expressions in any language is a morpheme.

  

phone is the minimum unit of sound/utterance in a language.

  

changes that occur in the phonetc/phonemic aspects of a morpheme

  

when morphemes combine to form new morphological units such as words or parts of words

  

when morphemes are used for a different function than their original one

  

etc.,

  

are called morpho-phonemic changes.

  

------

  

संतोषः

has two morphemes: सं + तोषः

  

to be more precise,

  

सं + तोष + ह् /स्

  

तुष् is the morpheme which underwent a change in its phonemic structure to form तोष + ह् /स् . This change from तुष्to तोष + ह् /स् .is a morphophonemic change. Change of स् toह् here is also morphophonemic.

  

उत् + चर --> उच्चर is alsoa morphophonemic change

  

भू + ति ----> भवतिis alsoa morphophonemic change

  

धेनुः + चरति ----> धेनुश्चरतिis alsoa morphophonemic change

  

At the meeting point of धेनुः and चरति, more precisely, at the meeting point of the last phone/phoneme of the first word धेनुः and the first phone/phoneme of the second word चरति, there is a change in the phone /phoneme ह् /स्to श् . Since there is such a change, we say there is a morphophonemic change here.  

  

But in आ+चर--> आचर, there is no morphophonemic change

  

in सा + बाला --> सा बाला, there is no morphophonemic change.

  

When the root चर is used in विधि as चर there is no morphophonemic change

  

Does it help?
