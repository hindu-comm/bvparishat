The upadhmAnIya is basically expelling air through the open lips and a quick closing of the lips right after the expelling of a small amount of air, and since it is only half a mAtrA, it produces an f-like sound. I would ask you what your objective here is. Is it a theoretical analysis of what it's supposed to be vis-a-vis what happens in English or to actually learn how to enunciate. If it is the latter, I suggest going to competent Vedic pundits and learning from them by \*imitating\* them. This sort of analysis prior to actual learning of the sounds is like trying to learn singing by asking signal processing engineers how many exact dBs the different notes are from each other and comparing the dB levels between notes in Western vs Carnatic systems. After learning how to pronounce, it would certainly be good to go the shikshA texts and strengthening the understanding of sounds, which will provide a boot-strap effect in actual recitation. It cannot work the other way around. And this is the way it has been for 5000 years of Vedic tradition. Also my 2c as a person whose main interest is Vedic recitation.
