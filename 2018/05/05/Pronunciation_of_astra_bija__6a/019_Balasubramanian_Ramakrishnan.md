Prof. Paturi, I am not disagreeing that there are no differences between the 'f' and upadhmAnIya, but there is a similarity in sound as well. I mean pretty much none of the English alphabet like k etc. correspond to the Sanskrit k, but there is some commonality. In the taittirIya prAtishAkhya, since the open lips have to be closed to enunciate the pa-kaara, the p sound is also duplicated as per 14.9:

  

aghoShAdUShmAnNaH paraH prathamo'bhinidhAna-sparshaparAttasya sasthAnaH

  

so, naH pracodhayAt -> na(f)ppracodayAt

  

\(f\) = upadhmAnIya

  

The shukla-prAtishAkhya does not admit this duplication, so the phonology there would be different.
