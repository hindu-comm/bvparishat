In astraaya phaT , it is just mahaapraaNa of p

  

Sri Ramakrishnan-ji , Sri Ujjval-ji said visarga + p --> upadhmaaneeya + p

  

I am saying that upadhmaaneeya is not f.

  

f is pronounced by sending air pressured through the narrow space between upper tooth and inner part of lower lip.

  

upadhmaaneeya is pronounced by sending airpressured through rounded lips.
