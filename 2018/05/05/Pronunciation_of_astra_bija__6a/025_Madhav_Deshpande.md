Dear Nagarajji,

  

  I agree with most of your comments. Just a few footnotes. In technical roman transcription of upadhmānīya, it is not transcribed as "f". The Jihvāmūlīya is rendered as ḫ and the Upadhmānīya is rendered as ẖ. Secondly, no matter what script one uses, the pronunciation of Sanskrit tends to be influenced by the mother tongue of the speaker.
This is as much true in India, as it is outside India. Using the traditional descriptions of Sanskrit phonetics found in the Śikṣās and Prātiśākhyas, it is possible to come up with a "common" set of guidelines. However, the reality of the actual pronunciation of Sanskrit differs from region to region, and that reality is not reflected in the scripts. This is also true of English pronunciation across the world, even when the writing system remains the same. Not only does the non-native pronunciation of English differ according to the mother tongue of the speakers, the native pronunciation itself differs across different regions of USA, UK, Australia and so on.
Writing systems provide only an approximation to the uttered speech, and this remains true of the written representation of Sanskrit, as it is for all other languages. Though Hindi and Marathi share the same Devanagari script, the actual pronunciation of sounds is different in the two languages.
