**BVK Sastry: vedic Rik has its inbuilt compliance to vedanga by its design and delivery.**

**To audit a given vedic rik using one needs to have integral knowledge of vedanga and clarity on viniyoga given in other texts.**

**BVK Sastry: veda darshana is when you have the darshana through yoga practice. This is vishwamitras darshana of shabda shareera of gatatri mantra. It is individualistic.**

**  
**

**What we have now is a transmitted tradition. How many variations might have been introduced is anybodys guess.**

**  
**

**To audit transmitted tradition one can use vedanga; or yoga based
darshana.**

**  
**

**The spacing - kaala- virama gets answered by this.**

**Final justification; will current models help to have gayatri darshana? Then it is right.**

**

**BVK Sastry: handling physical body and psyche ( manas-shareera) have different rule-basis.**

**Prana is not air or oxygen.**

**Rules of prana and flow of prana is in naadis. Air movement is physical.**

^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry: gatatri mantra as darshana by vishwamitra is original . What you may vision is todays.**

**If both match, then gayatri is eternal! In its form.**
