I know that sandhi happens in European languages too. That is why Bloomfield uses the word Sandhi as one of the universally applicable terms of linguistics in his book. Thats fine. (This sentence has a Sandhi, that + is = thats, is fun)

  

But the point is whether that parassannikarshah leads to morph-phonemic changes or not.

  

sub + plant = supplant ; sub + fix = suffix ; have regressive assimilation.

  

sub +funding = subfunding there is no change.

  

of people has no morpho-phonemic change at the junction of the two words.
