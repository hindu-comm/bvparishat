Dear Bijoyji,

  

  Thanks for this link. This shows how fragile the perception of language is. Something like this also explains why there are different readings in Sanskrit manuscripts. Some of these were probably orally dictated by one person and written down by another. Different meanings understood by different people from the same sentence is a phenomenon seen frequently in Sanskrit drama and poetry. This is a worthwhile area of study.
