Dear Sri Sastryji:

  

Please help me understand the following points you have made:

  

1. You say: " where the audit standard becomes individual; or should we be looking for a authentication by text and practice ? "

How is this to be audited in reality?

The basis of confidence in knowledge is trust in the preceptor and in the parampara/ sampradaya. I understand that thanks to the number of exceptions in Sanskrit grammar exceeding the number of rules, interpretation is fraught with much risk.

The other case to be considered is "Does a Vedic Rk actually bow own to the rules of grammar which however perfect is still man-made as opposed to the apaurusheya revelations from beyond as received and transmitted by the Seer of the mantra?"

  

2. You say: " the nah- prachodayaat’ discussion seems to be overlooking the ‘ issue of ‘ spacing ( kaala – viraama) "

The issue of spacing would be relevant if the 2 syllables occured as the last part of a previous pada and the first syllable of the succeeding pada. The expectation in chanting is to give a slight pause / kAla virAma in between padas. I am unsure if there is a similar expectation of pause within a pada, so in this case it might render your original point moot. Please do let me know if that is not the case.

  

3. You say: " In japa, there is NO movement of air or vocalorgans. "

mAnasik japa still requires adherence to the principles of siksha implying that a mantra pronounced mentally will activate prana at the appropriate points in the vocal apparatus. You may think of this as playing a flute / piano mentally. So irrespective of whether air moves or not, prana definitely does. So the issue is still relevant in mAnasik japa.

  

4. You say: " I am not extending this deliberation on ‘ Whether original Gayatri mantra’ was with pha’ sound or half- visarga’. "

I am now confused here sir. What do you mean by original Gayatri mantra?

  

Many thanks,

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
