Madhavji,

**We have been struggling for a couple of years now to find a neurological basis of the Paninian system.**

We do propose a cognitive signal transformed by muscles and breathing.

The nuances are large. One of our team members will go to Vancouver to present the paper.

Best regards,

Bijoy

Dear Bijoyji,



  Thanks for this link. This shows how fragile the perception of language is. Something like this also explains why there are different readings in Sanskrit manuscripts. Some of these were probably orally dictated by one person and written down by another. Different meanings understood by different people from the same sentence is a phenomenon seen frequently in Sanskrit drama and poetry. This is a worthwhile area of study.

Check how articulation gets distorted in uttering and reception.
