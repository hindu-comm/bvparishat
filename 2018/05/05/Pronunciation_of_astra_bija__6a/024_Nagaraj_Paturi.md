\> I mean pretty much none of the English alphabet like k etc. correspond to the Sanskrit k, but there is some commonality.

  

Let us take a Sanskrit word such as काकः . An English speaker learning Sanskrit may pronounce the क here in the way an English sound close to it is pronounced, but not the exact way it is to be pronounced in Sanskrit. The audience may understand/identify that pronunciation as काकः by approximating it to the correct Sanskrit pronunciation of the word.

  

It is true that when the word काकःis transliterated in Roman, the script symbol 'k' is used in that transliteration for the क् inकाकः. But still when the same Roman transliteration is read/pronounced by an Indian, it is pronounced in the 'natural' / 'correct' way. But the same Roman transliteration is pronounced with the k in it being pronounced the English way by an English speaker, it may at the most be tolerated. But pronouncing it the English way by an Indian is not accepted because no consolation is shown towards him.

  

In the same way, the bilabial pronunciation of upadhmaaneeya is the 'ideal' Sanskrit pronunciation. Its labio-dental pronunciation by an English speaker may be at the most be tolerated. But if an Indian pronounces upadhmaaneeya , the bilabial as labio-dental, it is not accepted.

  

To use the script symbol 'f' for upadhmaaneeya may be for want of a better script-solution. But that is only script solution. But the pronunciation of an upadhmaaneeya is bilabial is the Sanskrit/Vedic fact documented by the Vedic books of articulatory phonetics.

  

If upadhmaaneeya = f means script point, it may be correct. If upadhmaaneeya = f meansupadhmaaneeya is a labio-dental sound, it is not correct.
