Sir,

  

Thanks for your clarification. The reason for my question is that many tantric practitioners use the f pronunciation. Amongst translators Ram Kumar Rai was a big proponent of the fut usage.

  

As you say, Siksha clarifies that ph is a logical continuation of p with aspirate.

  

Venkat
