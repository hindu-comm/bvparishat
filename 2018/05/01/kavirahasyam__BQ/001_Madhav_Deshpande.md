The work Kavirahasya is authored by Halāyudha. It is designed to illustrate the various uses of Sanskrit verbs. It was published in 1900 from Germany by Ludwig Heller in two available recensions, and there is a Pune edition published in 1889. The citation that you have is from verse 6, which illustrates the various uses of the verb "gup".
