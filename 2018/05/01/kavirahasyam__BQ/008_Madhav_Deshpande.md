Here is the pdf of Heller's edition of the two recensions of Halāyudha's Kavirahasya. The introductory material is in German, but the Sanskrit text is printed in Nāgari. I have a paper copy of the Pune edition from 1889, and its numbering is sometimes different. If the attachment does not go through with this message, I can send the pdf privately.
