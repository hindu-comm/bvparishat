One more verse for Mādhava this evening:

  

विपिने मृगीं भ्रमन्तीमवलोक्य कुतोऽनुधावसि मुकुन्द ।

हरिणाक्षी तव निकटे, माधव मा धाव मा धाव ।।

  

Having seen a female deer wandering in the forest, O Mukunda, why are following her. The Deer-Eyed \[Rādhā\] is right next to you. O Mādhava, stop running \[mā dhāva\], stop running \[mā dhāva\].
