Namaskar to all



This is an omnibus post, made after seeing the previous posts by learned scholars in this thread. I am putting my thoughts here for your kind consideration.



It is interesting to note that-



- the corresponding term for*samyama*in*sadanga yoga*(from*saiva siddhanta*and*trika*traditions) is***dharana***. (Cf the*malinivijayottaratantra,*whichuses the term*dharana*for*viniyogic*contemplations extensively)



- the*kapila samkhya sutras*only uses the term***dhyana***as a catchall term for all contemplative practices. Pls note that the *tattva samasa* (considered by Max Muller to be the earliest *samkhya* work) and the *Samkhya Karika* (generally considered to be the earliest *samkhya* work) do not have occasion to talk about any practical methods – it is all theory.



 - the early upanishads use the term***upasana***for contemplation practices. Advaitic traditions, notably *adi samkara*, define it quite similarly to*samadhi*.



We can see that there is no homogeneity in characterization of the practice of intense contemplation.*Dharana*,*dhyana*and*samadhi*have somewhat overlapping definitions and uses.



Even though*patanjali*defines*dharana*,*dhyana*and*samadhi*separately, from the above as well as from their definitions it is clear that they are gradations in a single process of contemplation of increasing intensity. It is keeping this in mind that I said*samadhi*essentially includes*dhyana*and*dharana*.



It is also clear that*samadhi*is a state arrived at after*dhyana*. No one, except the accomplished masters, can immediately plunge into a state of*samadhi*at will.*Samadhi*needs*dharana*and*dhyana*as its intermediate steps every time. It is in this sense that I said*samadhi*automatically includes*dharana*and*samadhi*.



Also, it is interesting to note that*patanjali*, elsewhere, puts the term***samapatti***into the mix as an adjunct or supplement or complement (I can’t figure out which) to*samyama (*in III.42). I am not sure how*samapatti*is different from*samadhi*here again, their meanings being so similar as to be indistinguishable. You can see the added complexity in figuring out the meanings.



Furthermore, we should not sideline viniyogic contemplation practices as a lesser application of yogic *dhyana/samadhi* (- choose your term). There is a definition of*yoga*, per*adi samkara*(cf. his *brahma sutras*commentary) which says:



****Atha tattvadarshanabhyupayo yogah ****

****  
****

****(Yoga is the (direct) means to perceive reality (or levels of reality, the samkhyan tattvas)****



Viniyogic *dhyana/samyama****(tattvajaya)*** is a legitimate part of mainstream practice of *ashtanga yoga* of *patanjali*, and I see no reason for the introduction of the concept of *samyama* when *Samadhi* would have done it admirably. The extant commentaries are also not clear about this aspect. (Of course, the term *Samadhi* has many grades of meaning in *Patanjali*, and that which is sought to be included in *samyama* is the first, common variety of *samadhi*. This is understood.)



What is not clear, in summary, is why Patanjali found it necessary to introduce a new collective technical term when the third constituent term means and includes, for all practical purposes, the first two constituent terms.

  

kind regards

Harsha
