Namaste

  
  

\>\>Now, by definition,***samadhi* automatically includes *dharana* and *dhyana*.** It (*samadhi*) is simply an extension of *dharana* and *dhyana*.

**  
**By definition Samadhi does not include Dharana and Dhyana. Their definitions are separate and clear in the sutras that have been quoted in your mail. The commentators also have given the difference between Samadhi and Dhyana very clearly. The former two are the preparations and by the virtue of excellence in the first two one moves in to the higher state called Samadhi. **  
**

  
\>\>***Then why is the new concept of samyama introduced?**How is samyama different from samadhi?*** To me, they seem to be the same.  
  
  

Vacaspati Misra the commentator on Yogasutra in his Tattvavaisharadi commentary states that -  
  
*dhāraṇādhyānasamādhirityetattrayasya tatra tatra niyujyamānasya prātisvikasaṁjñoccāraṇe gauravaṁ syāditi lāghavārthaṁ **paribhāṣāsūtram avatārayati** - trayamekatra saṁyamaḥ ।*  
This is a परिभाषासूत्रम् - It is a Sutra that introduces a technical term Samyama. In the later parts of the chapter in many occasions, based on the triple limbs dhāraṇā, dhyāna and samādhi various yoga siddhis will be stated. Repeating the three terms will make the sutras unnecessarily longer. A sutra should use only limited number of words. Hence in place of the three terms dhāraṇā, dhyāna and samādhi a single term Samyama has been coined by Patanjali. This helps in the process of making the sutra Alpaksharam.
