Namaste Sir,

  

Thank you for your kind reply.

I am aware of the limitations of independent study, which is part of the reason why I try to seek the help of learned scholars here to aid understanding. This is not to say that this is a substitute for learning under a real guru (it is not), but it is also a fact that the exigencies of earning a livelihood often constrict our options. To compensate for this, I try to follow the traditional as well as practical works bearing upon topics that trouble me.

  

In this case, for example, I have perused Swami Hariharananda Aranya's commentary on this point before venturing to put the question here. He was a true practising samkhya yogi, and he had this very doubt on this point, yet his explanation which is paraphrased below is unsatisfactory to me:

  

*"....all three types of contemplation are required in order to know an object thoroughly in all its aspects...."*

  

As you can see, this is merely restating the issue in new words. No new insight on requirement of the concept of samyama here, **unless we posit the theory, basing ourselves on utilitarian grounds, that samyama is a sort of "trade name" for samadhi (automatically inclusive of dharana and dhyana).** I say this because "extension" (my word) is essentially the same as "advancement", "crossing the border" or "progressive unification" (your words).

**  
**

**When it comes to dharana, dhyana and samadhi, the difference, to borrow Swami Vivekananda's words (from another context), is one of degree, and not of kind.**

  

Further,

  

> If you contemplate on the sutra 3 and take a look at the way it > back-connects to dhyana, do you notice that ‘ artha- nirbhaasa’ part > is instruction to advance dhyana to dhaaranaa .

Yes, I see how dharana progresses to dhyana. No confusion or conflict here.

Trayam means three, and ekatra means together, unified. The direct sense is as you put it - all three focused on one area/point. This is samyama, granted.

  

**We are clear as to what samyama is, but we are not clear as to what samyama is in contradistinction to samadhi.**

**  
**

Patanjali is not a fool to waste two words on one concept unless there are really two concepts that are different in some way, but I am unable to find out just what.****I think I am missing something subtle here, hence the post.

  

I respectfully appreciate that you have taken the time to consider the issue.

  

  

with kind regards

  

Harsha
