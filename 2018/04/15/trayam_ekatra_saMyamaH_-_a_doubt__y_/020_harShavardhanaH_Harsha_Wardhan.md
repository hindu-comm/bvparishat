This post, the last one by me on this subject, is being made for the benefit of future perusers of this thread, and to bring a meandering discussion to an end.

  

Swami Hariharananda Aranya, who had the same doubt as me about Samyama vis-a-vis Samadhi, has this to say on the matter:

  

From the**Bhasvati**:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**"The question might arise that as Samadhi or concentration implies fixity of mind and meditation, it should denote Samyama and it would be unnecessary to mention Dharana and Dhyana separately."**

  

**"In reply, it can be said that Samyama is spoken of as the means of acquiring knowledge in respect of, and control over, the thing contemplated upon. If concentration is attained on only one aspect of a single object, one would not achieve the above objective. The object contemplated upon has to be thought of from all sides and in all its aspects and then should concentration take place on it. In one Samyama there might be several chains of Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi; that is why, the three together has been called Samyama. For this reason it has been said by the commentator in Sutra III.16 that the three-fold mutation is directly realizedthrough Samyama. Direct realizationmeans sustained knowledge acquired by repeatedly practicingDharana-Dhyana-Samadhi on the same object."**
