The question, I suppose, is - when one has the ability to move to the higher state of samAdhi, why do the following sUtras prescribe samyama for the attainment of various purposes (siddhis etc), and not simply samAdhi?

  

If the idea is that the attainment of samAdhi in each subsequent instance is necessarily preceded by dhAraNa and dhyAna, and therefore those two need to be performed to attain samAdhi, then why not prescribe all the eight limbs in each instance, as surely one needs to have mastered the previous seven to attain the eighth?

  

Therefore, each of dhAraNa and dhyAna must serve a unique purpose that is not fulfilled by samAdhi. The question is, what is it?
