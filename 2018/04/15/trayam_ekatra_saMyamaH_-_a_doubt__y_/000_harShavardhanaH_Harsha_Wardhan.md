Namaskar,

  

In the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali (Chap 3), we find the following:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*देशबन्धश्चित्तस्य धारणा ॥ १॥  
Fixing the consciousness on one point or region is concentration (dhāraṇā).  
  
तत्र प्रत्ययैकतानता ध्यानम् ॥ २॥  
A steady, continuous flow of attention directed towards the same point or region is meditation (dhyāna).  
  
तद् एवार्थमात्रनिर्भासं स्वरूपशून्यम् इव समाधिः ॥ ३॥  
When the object of meditation engulfs the meditator, appearing as the subject, self-awareness is lost. This is samādhi.  
  
**त्रयम् एकत्र संयमः ॥ ४॥  
These three together \[dhāraṇā, dhyāna and samādhi\] constitute integration or saṃyama.**  
  
तज्जयात् प्रज्ञालोकः ॥ ५॥  
From mastery of saṃyama comes the light of awareness and insight.  
  
तस्य भूमिषु विनियोगः ॥ ६॥  
Saṃyama may be applied in various spheres to derive its usefulness.*

*\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*  

*  
*

Now, by definition,***samadhi* automatically includes *dharana* and *dhyana*.** It (*samadhi*) is simply an extension of *dharana* and *dhyana*.

**  
**

***Then why is the new concept of samyama introduced?**How is samyama different from samadhi?*** To me, they seem to be the same.

**  
**

I respectfully request learned members to throw light on this matter.

  

  

with kind regards

Harsha
