Well, Dr Sastry, this seems to have taken an unseemly turn!  
  
I do not wish to join issue on your  
  
(i) judging my motives for asking the question,  
(ii) implicitly classifying me as an “academic yoga seeker”, or  
(iii) labeling my observations as seeking brownie points in debates on public forums  
  
Please understand that I am restraining myself from expressing myself fully on the above out of a sense of decorum and out of respect for scholars.  
  
My use of the English term ‘Soteriology/\`ical’ also caused a tangential exposition on your part (not without merits, though). I just wish to submit that the definition you provided seems to be from the Merriam-Webster dictionary. I believe these western lexicographers simply gave the America-centric, popular explanation of the word as generally understood over there. I used the word to invoke the sense of*Moksha* in the Chaturvarga Purushartha (Dharma, Artha, Kama, Moksha) context. If you read the word in that sense, you will realize why I called Yoga soteriological. Perhaps I would have been better served if I had used the word *“mukti”*. *If you dispute this, kindly tell me where you would put the practice of Yoga in the purushartha framework.  
*  
I found the following points in your reply to be instructive and helpful:  
  
1. Your caution on reading Bhoja  
2. The current focus in the West on exploiting Yoga  
3. The following admonition: *The’ paribhashaa term’ - \< सिद्- संज्ञा \> if borrowed from a different discipline (तन्त्रान्तर ), needs to be understood in the same way as it was coined in the source discipline (तन्त्रान्तर) and not the way one likes in the ‘borrowed context’.*  
  
Here’s my position on pt. 3: I take the PYS to be one of the primary and significant texts of Yoga, but not the only one. In my view, it is only an accident of fate that this text gained prominence through Swami Vivekananda’s efforts in America and England, who pitched it as the defining text on Yoga to the West to better cater to their scientific bent of mind. Subsequent scholarship in the West and India has built up on that, so we find the PYS by an unspoken academic and popular agreement to be the foundation text of all inquiry. This is why, to bring balance, I used examples from other yogic and ancillary traditions to buttress my points. I stick to the opinion that all yoga systems are valid and complete in themselves.  
  
With reference to your admonition on *paribhasha*, I will meet you on your turf. I will restrict myself to PYS and its terms and definitions.**The issue, if we strip it of all this paraphernalia, is simply this –**

**  
(i) Within the PYS framework, does s*amadhi* include *dhyana* and *dharana* within itself or not?  
  
(ii) Within the PYS framework , how does the answer to (i) change in the context of *samyama*?**  
  
***Your position, as I understand it, is that this is a matter of practice and not of reasoning/deduction/induction. I opine that samadhi includes dhyana and dharana throughout, based on my understanding of PYS definitions and their meaning (sabda + artha), with the proviso that I recognize that Patanjali and the commentators have something significant and subtle to indicate on the concept of samyama (whose meaning currently eludes my understanding).***  
  
If you are so inclined, kindly let me know where I am incorrect, and we will conclude this discussion, which is fast becoming unbecoming.  
  
  
  
With kind regards  
Harsha
