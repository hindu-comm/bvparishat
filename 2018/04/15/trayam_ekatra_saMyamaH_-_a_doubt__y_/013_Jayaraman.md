Dear Sir  
  
I read your summary of the discussion.  
  
Kindly consider the following in that regard -  
I looked into available printed commentaries in this regard. I have two observations.  
**  
Point 1**  
As has been stated by you, the question that you raised has already been raised by Hariharanand Aranya in Bhasvati. I am just giving the commentary and presenting my understanding based on that with the hope that it may lead some new thoughts/clarity on the current topic of discussion -  
  
The wordings of Hariharananda Aranya is (to the sutra under discussion 3.4) -  
  
ननु समाधौ धारणाध्यानयोरन्तर्भावः तस्मात् समाधिरेव संयमः, त्रयाणां समुल्लेखो व्यर्थः इति शङ्का एवमपने  
या - ध्येयविषयस्य सर्वतः पुनः पुनः क्रियमाणानि धारणादीनि संयमः इत्यर्थः। अतो नायं समाधिमात्रार्थकः।  
  
Probably based on his practical experience as a Yogi,Hariharananda Aranya, as I observe from the wordings, notes the following difference between समाधि and संयम -  
  
समाधि - is अर्थमात्रनिर्भासं स्वरूपशून्यमिव  
Whereas संयम - Along with अर्थमात्रनिर्भासं स्वरूपशून्यमिव involves two more aspects  
1. ध्येयविषयस्य सर्वतः (covering all aspects - prob three kalas (past, present and future), in all its spatial dimensions (3D or 4 D or whatever it may be) etc),  
2.पुनः पुनः क्रियमाणानि (repeated) धारणादीनि   
  
As संयम involves unraveling some hitherto unknown aspects of a given object (सिद्धि) these two above points are to be given extra care by a Yogi while entering into the State of Samadhi for specific benefits.Whereas when there is no specific Siddhi-focus these aspects need not be given emphasis.  
  
In the context of Yogasutra, then, समाधि is used to refer to total transformation of the mind in the form of the object taken up for focus.  
When it is संयम no doubt it is a समाधि but it also carries and is also is assisted by the specific extra Samskaras that are accrued by **repeated and all encompassing** Dharana, Dhyana (ध्येयविषयस्य सर्वतः, पुनः पुनः क्रियमाणानि) (to offer an example - for a general eye, a sculpture may already look beautiful and perfect (Samadhi), but an artiste will keep working on it making subtler and subtler modifications until he sees that expression which he desires to see in that piece of art (Samyama). To attain the cittavritti nirodha goal of Yoga through Samadhi - too much of focus on specifics may not be required about the object of meditation. But for Siddhis it may be required. This might differentiate Samadhi and Samyama.  
  
**Point 2  
**Another hint that we find from Vijnanabhiskhu's commentary in this regard is also worth noting. He states - तन्त्रान्तरसिद्धसंज्ञाप्रतिपादकमिदं सूत्रम्।  
(The terms Samyama and Samadhi may not be different at all) But - तन्त्रान्तरसिद्ध -in other Sastras (which one not sure - Scholars should enlighten) Samyama is already used (to denote Samadhi in the context of Siddhis?). And Patanjali might have simply utilized the preexisting terminology for facilitating understanding by using a term already in vogue.  

  
regards  
Jayaraman
