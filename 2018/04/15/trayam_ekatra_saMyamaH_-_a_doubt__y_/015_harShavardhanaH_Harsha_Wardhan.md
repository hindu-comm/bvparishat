Namaskar to all

  

1. ***Samapatti:***

***  
***

Bhoja Raja has been quoted in full by Dr BVK Sastry to show Samapatti’s meaning vis-à-vis Samadhi. Thank you Dr Sastry. I will need to read it thoroughly to understand.

III.42 really threw me for a loop.



2.******** ****Extraneousness:****

****  
****

> ...omnibus post has taken the starting issue to a different > focus...

> ...The terms are have mutual connection ; but they do not overlap....



The examples of terminology used in various disciplines were introduced into the discussion not to insinuate that people were confused or somehow ignorant of what they were saying, but to show that the practice underpinning the various terms was the same across similar disciplines. ****I repeat, to avoid confusion - I am talking about the practice (of intense mental contemplation) and how it has different terms/names in similar traditions, not about the names/terms per se.****

I say this because the traditions referred to are all closely related to Ashtanga Yoga. Sadanga Yoga is a cousin of Ashtanga Yoga, Samkhya is the mother of Yoga praxis, Upanishads are the origin of almost all Indian soteriologies and what is Yoga if not a soteriology? **I humbly refuse to admit that we cannot use such closely aligned systems to compare and see for ourselves how nomenclature differed while referring to the same processes/methods.** What is knowing itself, if you come right down to it, if not a process of cognition through comparison?

In fact, to obviate the charge of unnecessarily expanding the ambit of discussion I refrained from quoting Buddhist sources , despite there being much of relevance in that tradition when it comes to the practice of mental contemplation.

Be that as it may, the burden of my entire discussion is this – ***I am focusing on the practice itself. Not the terms. Here, Patanjali gives me difficulties in understanding.***

3.   

***BHASVATI and YOGASARASAMGRAHA:***

  

***I think the interpretation provided by Dr Jayaraman is the one most helpful to the discussion, and comes closest, so far, in addressing the principal issue.***

  

I am inclined to agree with his assessment when he says

  

> समाधि - is अर्थमात्रनिर्भासं स्वरूपशून्यमिव  
> Whereas संयम - Along with अर्थमात्रनिर्भासं स्वरूपशून्यमिव involves > two more aspects  
> 1. ध्येयविषयस्य सर्वतः (covering all aspects - prob three kalas (past, > present and future), in all its spatial dimensions (3D or 4 D or > whatever it may be) etc),  
> 2.पुनः पुनः क्रियमाणानि (repeated) धारणादीनि   

> As संयम involves unraveling some hitherto unknown aspects of a given > object (सिद्धि) these two above points are to be given extra care by a > Yogi while entering into the State of Samadhi for specific benefits. > Whereas when there is no specific Siddhi-focus these aspects need not > be given emphasis.



Also, I am interested, alongwith Dr Jayaraman in knowing more about the following:

  

> Another hint that we find from Vijnanabhiskhu's commentary in this > regard is also worth noting. He states - > तन्त्रान्तरसिद्धसंज्ञाप्रतिपादकमिदं सूत्रम्।  
> (The terms Samyama and Samadhi may not be different at all) But - > तन्त्रान्तरसिद्ध -in other Sastras (which one not sure - Scholars > should enlighten) Samyama is already used (to denote Samadhi in the > context of Siddhis?)



  

  

**My humble salutations to all the scholars for taking the time to explain these subtle points. I am grateful.**



With kind regards

Harsha
