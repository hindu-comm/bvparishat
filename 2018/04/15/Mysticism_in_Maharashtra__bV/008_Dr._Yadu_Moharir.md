Namste Paturi-Ji,

  

Thx for responding.

  

I think is the desire to sick to the truth, no the the academic standards.

  

India operates between smanavaya and parixikaara.n

I am a Democrat living in US for 40 yrs. but I have the greatest respect for Ronald Regan, when he said, TRUST but VERIFY.

  

What a shame
