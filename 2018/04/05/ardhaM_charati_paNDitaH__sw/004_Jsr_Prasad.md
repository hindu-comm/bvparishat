namAMsi. There might be a few stories associated with its context.  

  

I think, the vyaadha is trapped in a great flood along with his two children and wife. All of them got hold of the branches of a tree. But the heavy downpour lashes out all of them, sooner or later. So, he thought to swim through the flood waters, but can carry only one with him. What to do? He decides to carry his wife and abandon the two children. We could imagine why he preferred to his wife than the the children. May be it is in this context, current discussion is going on..
