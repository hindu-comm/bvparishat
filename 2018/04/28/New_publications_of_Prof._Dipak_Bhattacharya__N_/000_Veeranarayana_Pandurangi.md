Dear All namamsi. It is to make aware of new publications being brought out in India, though little bit late.

Paipalaadasamhitaa of the Atharvaveda, criticallty edited byP rof. Dipak Bhattacharyafrom Oriya manuscripts discovered by late Professor Durgamohan Bhattacharyya (father of Dipak Bhattacharya) and one Saaradaa script manuscript --kaandas 1-20 in four volumes. Vol 1 in 1997 (kaanda1-15), 2008 (Vol.2.kaanda 16), 2012 (Vol.3, kaanda 17-18), 2016 (Vol.4kaanda 19-20). The edition is endowed with notes and a critical apparatus. These are published by by Asiatic society Kolkata. These four volumes make a complete and exhaustive edition of atharvaveda paipalaadasamhitaa not certainly comparable to earlier fragmented editions.
