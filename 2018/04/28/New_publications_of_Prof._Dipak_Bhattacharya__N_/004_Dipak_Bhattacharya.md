Yes! Publications of the Asiatic Society are available abroad. This is from common sense. I saw AS publications at Leiden. One has to know of the agent.

Hope you will get it. In the mean time I may try to contact Mr. Sukhendu Bikas Paul

I am so troubled with my eyes that I cannot even read the messages well. I am trying to contact Mr. Sukhendu Bikas Paul personally. Unfortunately he may not have a smart phone,I am not sure if I could contact. In any case you may write to the Society. their postal address is 1 Park Street, Calcutta 700016

They have an email ID too. I may give you that when well

Best wishes

DB
