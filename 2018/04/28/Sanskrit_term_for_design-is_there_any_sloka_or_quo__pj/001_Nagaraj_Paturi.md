रचना is the word for design only, though it is being used more in the sense of literary writing.

  

रूपरचना can be used for a focus on form side rather than on function side.

  

कल्पना, रूपकल्पना is another choice. But कल्पना is being used in Hindi more for imagination.

  

It is a co-incidence that you sent this post just when I returned from my teaching of a course " Vedic Aesthetics for Design" at the MIT Institute of Design which is now the Design school of MITADT University, Pune.
