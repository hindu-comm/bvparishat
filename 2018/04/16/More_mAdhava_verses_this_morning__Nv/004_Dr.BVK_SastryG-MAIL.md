Namaste



Poetry inspires more poetry ! A ‘ not so creative’ response –resonance to Prof. Deshpandes creative composition ,



सापराधा (: ) (ऽऽ) राधनार्थं उमाधव-रमाधवौ ।

अनूराधा पतिं वक्रं, राधा-पादं च पश्यतः ॥



Sāparādhā (h) - (ā) rādhanārthaṁ umādhava-ramādhavau

anūrādhā patiṁ vakraṁ, rādhā-pādaṁ ca paśyataḥ

***Anvaya***:

उमाधव-रमाधवौ सापराधाः आराधनार्थं अनूराधा पतिं वक्रं, राधा-पादं च पश्यतः ॥

umādhava-ramādhavau sāparādhāḥ ārādhanārthaṁ anūrādhā patiṁ vakraṁ, rādhā-pādaṁ ca paśyataḥ \|\|





***Meaning***: Erred with their consorts, the husband of Uma ( =
Shiva) and husband of Ramaa (= Krishna / Maadhava), for making a reconciliation and pleasing their beloved, take a look at the– crooked orb of moon ( = Husband of Anuraadhaa –Star) and curved feet of Radha. Gods are no better than humans when it comes to erring with the beloved and then seeking reconciliation through any and all means.



Note -1: According to poetic convention, Moon is the husband of 27 stars, out of which Anooraadhaa is the seventeenth of the twenty-eight nakshatras. Moon on seventeenth day is ‘ Dviteeyaa – Vakri Chandra’. Moon is also the ‘graha’ responsible for mind, emotions and errors of love. The crescent moon on Shivas head is considered the sixteenth kalaa; and now Shiva is seeking a seventeeth one to find an excuse !



 To look at feet is keeping the eyes low , not looking straight in eyes ! 





Note -2: राधन \[p= 876,2\] \[L=177173\] - n. ( only L.), propitiating, conciliating \[p= 876,3\] \[L=177174\], pleasure, satisfaction, \[p= 876,3\] \[L=177175\] obtaining, acquisition , \[p= 876,3\] \[L=177176\] the means or instrument of accomplishing anything (-द्रव्य n. = पाचल) राधन \[p= 876,2\] \[L=177173\] - n.
