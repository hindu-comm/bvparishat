A minor change of the lineत्वां जानेऽहं कथं नैकरूपम् toत्वां जानेऽहं कथं विविधरूपम्. This fits the meter better. Thanks for the suggestions by Shri Shankar Rajaraman and Nityanandaji. The very existence of the BVP has facilitated the creation of my Sanskrit poems. Otherwise, in the academic and non-academic environment in the US where I have lived for 50 years, there is no audience for Sanskrit poetry, where people can instantly understand and appreciate it. I am thrilled to be a member of this group.
