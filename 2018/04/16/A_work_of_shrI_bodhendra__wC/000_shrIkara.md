Dear listfolk,

  

Does anyone have the Sanskrit text of shrI bhagavAnnAma bodhendra's shrI bhagavAn nAmAmRta rasodayam? Or any Sanskrit edition that can be found in hard or soft copy? I am only finding a mediocrely translated English version on [exoticindiaart.com](http://exoticindiaart.com) ,which itself is translated from a Tamil translation.

  

Thanking in advance.
