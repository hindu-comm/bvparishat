Namaste,

  

Shri.Krishna Premi Swamigal has translated into tamil. I think we need to order from them.

Shri Bodhendral's biography as well as samAdhi is very interesting !. I have visited Swamiga's adhishtanam in Feb'18 and also went to Maruthanallur for having the darshan of Satguru Swamigal's Mutt. I had the darshan of the adhishtanam @ Vadamambalam which is the Atmabodhendral's adhishtanam (guru of Bodhendral).

  

Very beautiful places to visit.

  

rgs,

sriram
