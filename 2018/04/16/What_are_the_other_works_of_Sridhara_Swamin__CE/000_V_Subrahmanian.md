Namaste

  

It is well known that the commentaries on the Srimad Bhagavadgita, Srimadbhagavatam and Vishnu Puranam are listed as the works of Sridhara Swamin. Are there any other works of his? I have heard of a 'nyaya....' Does anyone have information about this work and any others?

  

Thanks

regards
