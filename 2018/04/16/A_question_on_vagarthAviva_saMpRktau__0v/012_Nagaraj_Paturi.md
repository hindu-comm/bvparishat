Vaagartha sampriktataa is all about accuracy of usage.

  

Kaalidaasa is also seeking that in the verse.

  

Accuracy of usage is to its extreme in one form in the s'aastra, as there, one s'abda for one artha and one artha for one s'abda, samjnaa and its nirvachana having a strict one to one relation, without doshas such as ativyaapti, avyaapti and asambhava, is the norm.

  

In loka , it appears as though there is polysemy (naanaarthakataa) and synonymy (paryaayapadatva). But it is , at the same time, well known that this polysemy and synonymy are compiler /dictionary level situations and in the actual usage, there is neither of them. In a given actual usage only one of the naanaarthas is employed and in reality there are no exact synonyms and in an actual usage, one of the synonyms only is employed to suit the usage requirement accurately.

  

Kaalidaasa is asking for the ability for the accuracy of ***usage***and not for the situation in lannguage from a compiler's point of view that there should be no polysemy and synonymy in language.
