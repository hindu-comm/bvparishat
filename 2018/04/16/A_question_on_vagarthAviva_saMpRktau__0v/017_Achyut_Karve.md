Siddhe sbdArtha smbandhe of Mahabhashya as also the definition of a word given at the beginning of the Mahabhashya.

  

What happens when the user of a word does not ratiocinate it with the image in his mind?

  

However the possibility of multiple meanings of words also arise because of their context that is the sentence.

  

Moreover it also happens when a reader instead of trying to reveal the intent of the writer tries to thrust his own intent on the sentence.
Grammar was written to reduce this risk.

  

Thus it appears as if a word has more than one meaning when in fact a word has little meaning on its own. 

  

This can also be compared to the debate in the Mahabhashya on whether a letter has meaning.

  

Obviously when the context changes the word also changes clothes. It comes in a new form with the sàme body.
