There is not much material available to discern what Kalidasa might have had in mind, but different Sastras take different positions.  

The Nairuktas do not admit complete synonyms. For instance vriksha and bhUruha might be generally used to refer to a tree, but the former is that which is cut, and the latter is that which grows from Earth. Mimamsakas recognize that certain Sabdas (note: Sabda can mean syllable, word, sentence, discourse etc.) have multiple arthas, and call such situations as vikalpa and try to avoid interpretations resulting in vikalpa. A vikalpa is admitted only when there is no other go. Naiyayikas also recognize that a Sabda can have multiple arthas. Their stance is that if it is possible, the vivakshA - what the speaker wished to convey - should be clarified from the speaker (what does navakambala mean - nine blankets or a new blanket?). Later developments in Nyaya and Vaiseshika - together called Navyanyaaya have as their main purpose removal of ambiguity of

even 

t



he slightest sort and construct sentences so that the intended sense can be conveyed with precision. Vaiyaakaranas are relaxed about multiple meanings and actually resort to positions such as धातूनाम् अनेकार्थत्वम्, निपातानामनेकार्थात्वम् etc. Bhartrihari has developed a framework for fixing the abhidhaa aspect of meaning  



संयोगो विप्रयोगश्च साहचर्यं विरोधिता

अर्थः प्रकरणं लिङ्गं शब्दस्यान्यस्य संनिधिः।

सामर्थ्यमौचिती देशः कालो व्यक्तिः स्वरादयः

शब्दार्थस्यानवच्छेदे विशेषस्मृतिहेतवः ॥  
  

The above stance is accepted by Alaankaarikas, whose trade, in the main, depends on multiple meanings of Sabda. They recognize three types of arthas - vaacya-, laakshaNika- and vyanGya - the last being the most significant in poetry.  
  
Going back to VaiyaakaraNas, their ultimate position is that all Sabdas convey but one meaning - Brahman. Bhartrihari states this very clearly in the DravyasamuddeSa of Vakyapadiya.  
  
सत्यमाकृतिसंहारे यदन्ते व्यवतिष्ठते । तन्नित्यं**शब्दवाच्यं** तच्छब्दात्तत्त्वं न भिद्यते॥११, द्रव्यसमुद्देशः, वाक्यपदीयम्॥  
That which remains when all forms are withdrawn is the Truth, which is eternal, **which is the entity denoted by Śabda** and which is non-different from the nature of Sabda (Brahman).  

  

**वाच्या सा सर्वशब्दानां** शब्दाश्च न पृथक्ततः। अपृथक्त्वे च सम्बन्धस्तयोर्नानात्मनोरिव॥१६॥  
**That (Paraa Prakriti) is the denotation of all Sabdas**; Sabdas themselves are not different from That (Brahman). Though those two (Sabda and Dravya, i.e. Brahman) are non-different, it appears as if their relation is like the relation between those which are not identical with each other.
