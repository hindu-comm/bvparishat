Sir

  

One must note that while there would be saadharmya between Upameya and Upamaana, there is not atyantasaamyam. In such a case they would not be different objects. So we should not push analysis of comparisons beyond a point.

  

That said, it is equally possible to interpret vaagarthaaviva from a Vyakarana point of view. The two-fold manifestation of Brahman as Sabda and Artha is tenable in their system.

  

I guess some might think along the following lines. If Sabda is Parvati and Artha is Parameswara, if one Sabda can have many Arthas associated with it, then it amounts to saying that one Parvati can be associated with many Parameswaras - पापं शाम्येत् - which is not tenable.

  

This can be resolved in two ways. First it should be understood that the Hari Sabda which means Vishnu is different from the Hari Sabda which means horse. Not only that, in forms like dadhi + atra = dadhyatra, the "=" is misleading. Actually "dadhi atra" and "dadhyatra" are different Sabdas. Similarly rAjapurusha and rajnaH purushaH are different Sabdas (for Sabda is nitya and therefore cannot change like this). Second resolution is that saadharmya is restricted to the nityasambandha between Parvati and Parameswara on one hand and Sabda and Artha on the other hand. Otherwise, we will have untenable situations. There are parusha Sabdas and "dirty" Arthas. Can we say that the delicate Parvati and ever-pure Parameswara are like that? Or just like there are many Sabdas and many Arthas, can we say that there are many Parvatis and many Parameswaras?
