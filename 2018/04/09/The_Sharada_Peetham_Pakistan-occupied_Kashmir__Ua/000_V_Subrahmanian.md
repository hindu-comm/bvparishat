//Adi Shankara\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sharada_Peeth&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Adi Shankara")\]

  
It is at this temple that[Sankaracharya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Shankara "Adi Shankara")received the right to sit on the*Sarvanjnanapeetham*or*Sarvajna peetha*(*Throne of Wisdom*). The first verse of 'Prapanchsar' composed by Adi Shankaracharya is devoted to the praise of the temple's goddess, Sri Śāradā Devi. The Śāradā image at[Shringeri Sharadamba temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shringeri_Sharadamba_temple "Shringeri Sharadamba temple")in South India was once said to have been made of sandalwood, which is supposed to have been taken by[Sankaracharya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Shankara "Adi Shankara")from here.^(\[*[citation needed//](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*)
