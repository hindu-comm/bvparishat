Namaste,

  

...........

  

The Śāradā image at[Shringeri Sharadamba temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shringeri_Sharadamba_temple "Shringeri Sharadamba temple")in South India was once said to have been made of sandalwood, which is supposed to have been taken by[Sankaracharya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Shankara "Adi Shankara")from here.^(\[*[citation needed//](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*)

There is a sandalwood idol of Sharada Devi which is kept inside the Vidyasankara Temple at right-hand side. It is supposed to be the original Sharada Murti in Sringeri and later when one of the hands got bhinna, was replaced with suvarNa murti and installation ceremony was done during the times of Vidyaranya.

  

However, whether this sandalwood idol was the same which was in kashmir sharada peetha, is debatable.

  

rgs,

sriram
