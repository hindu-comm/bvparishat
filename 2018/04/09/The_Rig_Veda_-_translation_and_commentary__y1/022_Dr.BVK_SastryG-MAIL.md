Namaste Achyut Karve, David Reigle, Dmitri Semenov,



I am bringing together the response in one post. This is for consolidating the situation and bring a coherence in addressing the
issue.



***First, Achyut Karve***: 



1. On \< What was recited? \> : was relevant for the choice of veda mantras for achieving intended goal. Example : Heaven seeker -‘Swargakamo yajeta’ uses different mantras from Rain-seeker ‘ Vrushtikamo yajeta’. What was recited is based on the ‘ need’- Ishta- Kaama. This guideline is from the discipline of Meemaamsaa. Looking for ‘ Adhyatma ’ in ‘Sayana Bhashya’ which is focused on ‘ Adhi-yajna’ presentation of Vedas , is an error. It is also an error
when academicians miss the clear observation on ‘ Adhyatma’ part of Vedas made by Sayana and charge his work as ‘ ritualistic’ ! .



2. On \< How was it recited? \> : was relevant for making the ‘Mantra-chant’ to become effective and yield results. It is here that the story of ‘ Indra-Shatru’ and issue of defects of ‘ Swara- Varna – Chandas’ comes in. This training is from the six disciplines of Vedangas. See the quote down below, where the importance of
disciplines providing training on how veda is to be recited is considered an integral part of Yajna application of Vedas. 



 Ancient Guru kula model of Veda –Training for ‘Purohitas’ – Acharyas covered both aspects : training, examination and certification for practice as a profession. Modern Academic Veda studies do not cover all this.



***Second: David Reigle, Colorado, U.S.A***.

It is true that \< Sāyaṇa's interpretation was rejected by 19th-century German scholars, by Swami Dayanand Saraswati (founder of the Arya Samaj), and by Sri Aurobindo, because it interprets the Vedas in terms of rituals, yajña. \> .

It is also true that \< This (adhi-yajna) is only one of three modes of Veda interpretation referred to by the ancient writer Yāska in his Nirukta: adhiyajña, adhidaiva, and adhyātma.>. In fact, the five perspectives of Veda study add : adhiloka, adhi-praja to the three mentioned. ( Cf: Taittiriya Upanishad – Shikshaa valli::
pancahsvadhikaraneshu )

It is also true that \< The adhyātma mode of interpretation has remained little explored.> . In fact, the ‘ Upanishads’ are treated as if they are alien and anti - to teaching and practice of ‘Vedas’ by many writers ! It is a clear travesty of tradition and display of ‘selecting easy choices’ for ‘ maximum gains’ ! 

The point I want to highlight is that Sayana was clearly aware of all the above modes of explanations attached with Vedas; especially the ‘ Adhyaatma’ mode. **He chose consciously to highlight the ‘adhi-yajna’
or the ‘ AADHVARYAVA’ mode for the benefit of the ‘ Yaajnikas’;** because it calls for special skills of Language Tools spread over Six disciplines. Sayana preferred to handle the ‘Adhyatma interpretations ( with his preferred Advaita flavor) in different works. The image placed below is the opening of Rig-Bhashya Bhoomikaa. Please note the flavored use of the term ‘Vedarthasya – prakaashane’. The ‘ adhyatma’ interpretation of Veda by Sayana can be seen in his writing on ‘ Purusha Sukta ( Rigveda 10.90), His Sandhyavandana –Bhaashya and other works.

Does this mean Sayana sidelined the ‘adhyatma meaning of the Richas ? No. The Sayana commentary on Mandala -1 - Ashtaka 22- Sukta 164 :: (Asya vaamasya..), referred to by Agrawal, is very clear on this. It is a pointer to the way Sayana preferred to structure the ‘ Veda-Bhaashya’ during his time to meet the contextual needs. Sayana did not intend to please a later writer looking for ‘ adhyatma’ meaning and deviate from
his primary focus of ‘ Adhi-yajna’ .



The rejection of Sayana Commentary by 19^(th) century German scholars is unjustified and incorrect; and on the top of it loading ‘inappropriate history and language-constructions are inexcusable. If only these scholars had taken the trouble to read and understand every argument Sayana takes for analysis and justifies the need for writing a ‘adhi-yajna’ perspective of understanding ‘Veda’, then much of the blames heaped over Sayana could be taken off ! It would also help to free Sayana keep free from charges like \< the **extraordinary incoherence and poverty of sense which their results stamp upon the ancient hymns.** The separate lines can be given, whether naturally or by force of conjecture, a good sense or a sense that hangs together; the diction that results, if garish in style, if loaded with otiose and decorative epithets, if developing extraordinarily little of meaning in an amazing mass of gaudy figure and verbiage, can be made to run into intelligible sentences; but when we come to read the hymns as a whole we seem to be in the presence of men who, unlike the early writers of other races, **were incapable of coherent and natural expression or of connected thought**. Except in the briefer and simpler hymns, **the language tends to be either obscure or artificial**; > 



The pedagogy of Veda was presented through a ‘ Sampradaya’, which addressed these issues in a ‘ in person – eye to eye – Gurukul mode teaching’.

There is certainly much to think on Agarwals statement and work to do.

***Third : Dmitri Semenov***. 



Thanks for bringing to light the challenge in this case : \< The problem is not with lacking an "indigenous voice" in translation of RgVeda, but in lacking an "indigenous vision" of it that is ṛtáyu (and if it is such, terms indigenous, external, colonial, post-colonial, etc. would not be even applicable to it). The problem is to accept the state of affairs formulated by Sri Aurobindo \>. The expression ‘ Idea – tools’ used by you aptly fits in to explain the concept of ‘Shadanga’ – Six disciplines working together to get at the idea presented in the Richa.



I place below two extracts from Sayana Bhashaya : One pointing to the way Sayana ( and tradition looks at the role of ‘ Language- Tools’ in ‘Comprehending the Idea- Vision in Vedic Richa’. Second is what makes a ‘Rishi’ to use such complex language , or in other words, what is the language, which a poet uses when in the elevated state of consciousness as a ‘ Rishi’. The current position on ‘Veda : Translation and Commentary issue is complex with a two hundred year distortions loaded on a reference point position, even if it be of Sayana !



![](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/88a733b0155ad/image010.jpg?part=0.4)



If this line of Tradition, coming all the way from Vedas - Panini- Patanjali- Yaska is used as a reference for ‘ indigenous standards’ for assessing Veda: Commentary and Translation, how many modern Veda: Translations and commentaries would pass the test ? Whom should we be reckoning as ‘ Nootana Rushi’ ?

Thanks for your observation. How is one to address the challenges articulated by you so succinctly \< **The agendas and positions of convenience of "Western scholars" shall be pointed out even more brutally --- Western indology was and probably is driven by the ideas of religious conversion and by quite mistaken sense of superiority of Abrahamic creed** --- but it would be a mistake to see in it some substantial obstacle to the challenge --- "colonial" and "post-colonial" scholars have quite **seductive examples for simplifications and "sandwiches of convenience" in indigenous sources** --- and it is those sources that should be taken up for a critical consideration.> .



**Here lies the challenge of indigenous scholars to rediscover the ‘Swa-Desha –Bhashaa – Sampradaya’ for ‘ Veda-Artha – Samgraha and Veda-Artha –taatparya nirnaya’. This work starts by revisiting the pedagogy of Samskruth studies in the eco-system of current global
academia and Religion Studies. **
