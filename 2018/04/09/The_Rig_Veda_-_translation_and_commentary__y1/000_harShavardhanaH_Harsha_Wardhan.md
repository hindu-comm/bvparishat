Namaskar,

  

Could the learned members here recommend an accurate and informed English translation of the Rig Veda for self-study by non-Sanskritists?

  

I am looking for an English translation with the original Sanskrit hymns for comparison, and preferably with extracts from any traditional commentary.

  

  

Thanking you

  

with kind regards

Harsha
