Dear Dr. BVK Sastry,  
  
Just a short note to your exposition.  
The problem is not with lacking an "indigenous voice" in translation of RgVeda, but in lacking an "indigenous vision" of it that is ṛtáyu (and if it is such, terms indigenous, external, colonial, post-colonial, etc. would not be even applicable to it). The problem is to accept the state of affairs formulated by Sri Aurobindo as  
------------------------------  
Both of them (Saaya.na and modern European scholarship} present one characteristic in common, the extraordinary incoherence and poverty of sense  
which their results stamp upon the ancient hymns. The separate lines can be given, whether naturally or by force of conjecture,  
a good sense or a sense that hangs together; the diction that results, if garish in style, if loaded with otiose and decorative  
epithets, if developing extraordinarily little of meaning in an amazing mass of gaudy figure and verbiage, can be made to run  
into intelligible sentences; but when we come to read the hymns as a whole we seem to be in the presence of men who, unlike  
the early writers of other races, were incapable of coherent and natural expression or of connected thought. Except in the briefer  
and simpler hymns, the language tends to be either obscure or artificial;

and take up his challenge --- to elicits the richness of sense, of meaning, of ideas and visions in RgVeda  
that will show how many subsequent dharmas (even those that came to reject Vedas as ultimate authority like Bauddhadharma)  
have roots and source of liveforce in its suktas. Evidently Puurva Mimaamsaa and Saayana failed to do it.  
Criticism of "Vedic" practices and ideas by Buddhists cannot be brushed aside simply because of rifts between cultural and political currents of the past.  
  
Language is not that crucial --- if an idea can be understood, it can be expressed in any language with rich vocabulary.  
It is not about "language tools", but about "idea tools".  
  
The agendas and positions of convenience of "Western scholars" shall be pointed out even more brutally --- Western indology was and probably is driven by the ideas of religious conversion  
and by quite mistaken sense of superiority of Abrahamic creed --- but
it would be a mistake to see in it some substantial obstacle to the challenge --- "colonial" and "post-colonial" scholars have quite seductive examples for simplifications and "sandwiches of convenience" in indigenous sources --- and it is those sources that should be taken up for a critical consideration.  
  
Best of luck in this pursuit!
