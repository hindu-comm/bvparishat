I started on a copy of the said translation from yesterday evening and I am inclined to agree with you, Sri Pandurangi ji, in your assessment- though I'd like to reserve my judgment till I complete my reading.

  

I see a real difference in the way Indians and Westerners approach the Vedas. We Indians have such reverence for them that we invariably tend to lean towards reading more into the suktas than what would appear to be strictly necessary (the examples of frenzied/feverish hyper-scientific/speculative translations by otherwise well-meaning people come to mind), while the Westerns approach it as just another text to translate - and they appear to do so somewhat cavalierly and with a diffidence that seems just a tad callous to the Indian mind.

  

Just my impression. No offence intended.

  

kind regards  

Harsha
