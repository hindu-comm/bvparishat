How many on this list have studied Indian performing art and it's accompanying aesthetic?

  

What is the difference in experience between reading text and reciting poetry?

  

Can a poetry be ever translated?

  

What is lost in such a translation and is the reader of the translation aware of it?

  

What makes Madhav Deshpande so obsessed with poetry?

  

I feel one should acknowledge the sense potency of poetry against that of text before he reads a translation of a poetry or just it's paraphrase.
