Dear David,

  

  Thanks for adding this information on Vedic interpretation. The Nirukta has a few other modes of Vedic interpretation, namely the Nairukta "etymological" mode and the Aitihāsika mode. He ofter quotes stories from the Brāhmaṇas with the phrase "iti aitihāsikāḥ." The Nairuktas as is clear from the Nirukta do not always agree with each other. The other extreme of interpreting the Vedas mentioned by Yāska, and disputed, is the view of Kautsa who boldly proclaimed "anarthakā mantrāḥ". So, from the point of view of Kautsa, there would be no translation of the Veda possible. From the view point of the Nairuktas, the interpretation would be based on proposed etymologies, and from the view point of the Aitihāsikas, the Vedic passages should be interpreted in relation to the stories or accounts of events found in the Vedas, mostly in the Brāhmaṇas. As for traditional commentaries on the Vedas, besides the more well known commentaries of Sāyaṇa, Bhaṭṭabhāskara, Mahīdhara etc, Vishvabandhu has published in eight volumes the R̥gveda commentaries of Skandasvāmī, Veṇkaṭamādhava and Mudgala, and these commentators do not always agree with each other. In addition to this, there is a commentary of Madhva on some portions of the R̥gveda, with multiple subcommentaries. This goes to show that in India there were always multiple ways of interpreting the Vedas.
