Dr. Yadu ji,

  

Don't know about the other scholars but right now the living legend of Rg Veda is brahmasri narendra kapre-ji whom I know personally. I think you too

met him while reviewing the copy of srisukta.

  

Amazing personality and knowledge on Rg Veda along with Bhashya (both traditionally & as well as that of Kapali Sastriar's). Interested should tap such

personalities are utilise them rather than running here and there for half-baked pundits who doesn't have traditional background.

  

my 2 cents...

  

rgs,

sriram
