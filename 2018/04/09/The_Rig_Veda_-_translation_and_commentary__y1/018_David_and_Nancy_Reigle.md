Sāyaṇa's interpretation was rejected by 19th-century German scholars, by Swami Dayanand Saraswati (founder of the Arya Samaj), and by Sri Aurobindo, because it interprets the Vedas in terms of rituals, yajña. This is only one of three modes of Veda interpretation referred to by the ancient writer Yāska in his Nirukta: adhiyajña, adhidaiva, and adhyātma. The adhyātma mode of interpretation has remained little explored. Vasudeva S. Agrawala first called attention to it in his 1939 article, "The Vedas and Adhyātma Tradition" (PDF attached). After publishing a number of articles and books on it, he demonstrated it most clearly in his 1963 book: The Thousand-Syllabled Speech \[Being a Study in Cosmic Symbolism in Its Vedic Version\]: I. Vision in Long Darkness, Introduction and Analysis, Text and Translation of the Asya-Vamiya Sukta of Rishi Dirghatamas (Rigveda 1.164.1-52). His work has always impressed me, and I think the adhyātma mode of Veda interpretation holds much promise.
