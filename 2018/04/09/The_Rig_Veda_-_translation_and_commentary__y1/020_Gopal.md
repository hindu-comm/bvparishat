Namaste,

  
  
\>  In addition to this, there is a commentary of Madhva on some portions of the R̥gveda, with multiple subcommentaries.  
  

Most of the extant commentaries have been collected on this page:  

  
<https://chodayithri.wordpress.com/rig-veda-commentaries-by-dwaita-acharyas/>  
  

English translation of the Sri Madhva's Rig Bhashya is available
(perceptibly abridged) and a part of it is seen on the TTD's ebooks section.
