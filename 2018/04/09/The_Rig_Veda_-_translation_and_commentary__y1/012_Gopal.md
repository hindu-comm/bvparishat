Namaste, Dr.Pandurangi,  
  

thanks for bringing this up. Like others have requested, if you could share your commentary on the translations, that would be very helpful for one's svaadhyayana.  
  

1\) What do you think of Jon Gonda's approach ? He seems to be deviating from the traditional "western" view of RV (like in 'excess of poetry' as stated by someone in this thread)... or, probably, I am mistaken and he does indeed is a similar bird with similar feathers...  
  

For example, he even defines the "DhiH" (as in the Gayantri mantra) to mean as (paraphrased, not exact words) 'special vision, or intuitive vision that gives perception of Truth' (as in 'Vision of the Vedic poets'). The traditional and 'western' translation mean to say something like ' wisdom, knowledge, purified intelligence' (again paraphrased).
If one pursues the meaning of the riks with the variants of "Dhih" in this sense (Gonda's), it appears to match closely to the purport and power of Gayathri upasana as described across the board for spiritual evolution bu out teachers and others in our homes....  

  

2\) Kindly let know if you any other components of Gonda's interpretations run closely to the inner meanings of the suktas that you have looked into.  
  

sincerely
