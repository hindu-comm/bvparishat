Dear BVK and Contributing Scholars to this tread,

  

One of the most critical reason still remains missing because most of the translators have not followed the directive provided by Sage Shaunaka.None of the Translation books mention the most important portion pertaining to "USE" (The Viniyoga). This has has been missed by Westerns as well as Home team scholars.   

Shaunaka focuses on the application (viniyoga) portion, where the Vedic term is connected with the terms: Rushi (Drashtaa –seer), Chandas (Flow of terms), *Devataa* and Viniyoga. He emphatically states in (br̥had dēvatā dēvatānukramani136)[](#m_7180407562032739127__edn1): अविदित्वा ऋषिच्छन्दो दैवतं योगमेव वा \| योध्यापयेत् जपेत् वापि पापीयान् जायते तु सः  

  

Something to think about seriously.

  

My 2 Cents
