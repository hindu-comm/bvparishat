I have been going through the Jamison translation of late to understand how the first new translation in last one hundred years is better than previous ones. I find it obscure, झोन्त and rather misunderstanding many a times. I have written a paper "**Visnu Sukta 1.154.**  
**A review of commentaries**** and ****n*ew* translation *of* Rgveda"**which will appear in Tattvadipa Journal of Academy of Samskrit research Melkote. I am also writing one more review of Asya Vamiya Sukta 1.164.

I hope you will take care of assessing the new translation of Jamison.

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि। ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।  
तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः। निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
