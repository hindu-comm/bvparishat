Namaste Harsha Wardhan 



And all scholars who have touched upon this issue related to this thread. **Please bear with the detailing provided. Complex issues cannot be brushed aside by one liners! **



**( Note**: I have great respect for the academic work carried out by the scholars of east and west in regard to Vedas. It is because of their hard work, we are having material for this discussion. The only point I am highlighting here is the failure of these works in presenting the \< indigenous voice> as it is present in the source works and as a living practicing reality in a dwindling community struggling to make a ‘ Culture and lifestyle’ to live by the standards set by a specific understanding of Vedas. I have no intention of accusing or hurting any scholar in this deliberation).



This approach to understand and practice ‘Veda’ and the ‘matter, content and intent ( = vastu, artha and taatparya) of Veda,
indicated by me is not my personal opinion. **This is the language- standard set in the ‘Panini- Patanjali- Yaaska / Vyasa – Jaimini /
Vyasa – Daasa - Acharya - Sampradaya’. This standard prevailed in Bharath till at least 14^(th) century, as a ‘ Sanatana Dharma-Vaidika Brahmana Vedanta – Sampradaya’. Kapali Shastry reiterated this Sampradaya in his works and in his life by practice. There are many other illustrious names around of the last three centuries who have clearly demonstrated the validity of this Sampradaya. Saayana bhashya, Venkatdhvarin, Acharya Madhwa all resonate the same thought.**

****

**This standard comes with an integral thinking on philosophy and mysticism of Language, known as ‘Vak-Yoga’ for ‘ Shabda-Brahma Darshana’. Bhartruhari endorses this. This approach of using ‘Samskruth Language’ for Veda studies and practice is called ‘ Shadanga Saanga –Vedanga Paddhati’. A guideline that was provided for a ‘Brahmana’ of yore, to follow without any compromise ( Nishkaaranena) in the absence of ‘ Yoga Tapas based justification ( Tapasaa Brahma Vijinaasasva)’. I refrain from making any observation on today’s scenario where the tag line ‘Brahmana’ has become a socially and academically undesirable burden. **



If one really needs to understand and provide a restoration and find a
platform for \< indigenous voice \> as ‘Swa Desha Bhashaa Sampradaaya’, Then one needs to ‘ See- Think -Say’ as the indigenous schools presented the subject. If the scholars of indigenous tradition fail to assert their logical and scientific position, If the scholars of traditional schools find happiness to echo-back the views of others ( = kechit /anye) as ‘ Practical convenience’ , then what prevails is the authority of ‘outsiders’ to judge the ‘indigenous tradition’, which in other words is called ‘ intellectual slavery’.



Coming to the specifics,



1. The summary answer to your question \< which one, in your opinion, comes closest to the criteria you set out in your trailing post \> is \< NONE ! I do not find any work that passes the set criterion>.



 I am open to correct my position, with help from scholars.



What is being globally showcased as ‘ Indian writing on Veda : Translation and Summary’ - has several deviations and discordant notes.



This can be realized only when one goes deeper in to the given texts. For example, if one were to read the original Samskruth writing of Sri Kapali Shastry and ‘ Translation- Commentary – Representation of Kapali Shastry’s view to align it with Sri Aurobindo’s writings’, the slips will be gaping at the reader. Similarly, when many schools keep their priority and focus only on select ‘ Upanishats and Gita’ ( and select lines only ?? ) to give the ultimate meaning of ‘Veda’, the presentation is of a ‘ head severed from the body’. If select lines were to be the entire text, why have the whole book ?? The ‘ Brahma Karma and Yajna Karma’ are to be presented as integrally twined and harmoniously blended guidance from Vedas. When Colonial and Oriental schools present ‘ Veda –yajna’ as a historic case ( Classic illustration being the Yajna studies as practiced at Kerala, by many oriental and western academic institutions; since 1970’s ), the live relevance of Yajna for the current life, society is dismembered. The performance of ‘ Vedic yajna’ is treated as an enactment of a past event and ‘tribal memory recalled’. The ridicule point on ‘ Meemaamsaa’ raised is the same as ‘Charvaka , Jain and Buddhist schools did’- on the ‘ way to dress the animal for sacrifice’ ! The way ‘Ashvamedha’ is interpreted as a gore animal sex activity and information spread in society as ‘ Riddles of Ramayana and Mahabharata’ is yet to be addressed properly.



With these kinds of ‘under cover discrepancies, used for audit- filtering in journal publications, the indigenous voices on Veda
will never get to the surface. 

Writings with this kind of shortcomings do not really meet even the standards of honest academics, let alone the ‘ Satya –Dharma seeking Darshana Shastras’.



 Indian schools deliberation with ‘Veda’ is NOT for Translation = ***‘ Bhashaantara’*** \> . The language of ‘ Vision’ (= Yoga -Darshana ) is not same as ‘ language of a historical past society (= Samaaja – jana- jaati)’. Accuracy of expression for a ‘Vision’ when it is same, will yield the same expression. If ‘ Agni’ is the True visioned word for ‘ Agni tattva /devataa in Prakruti ( like Gravity, magnetism), then the natural cosmic frequency of the field will be ‘ heard in the same way. (Shruti will not change; the term is Non-Substitutable.). If ‘ Agni’ was a name given to fire by a society in a language context, then the term can be substituted by several regional language expressions like ‘ aag, benki, nippu, neruppu……’.



 When it comes to the second part of \< commentary = ***‘ Vyaakhyaana - Bhaashya – Teekaa /Tippani’*** \>, each of the Astika and Naastika schools ‘Critique Vedas (= **Veda – Vimarsha**) from a Point of View of their own ‘Darshana –Siddhaanta’ (= Point of View). In this sense, Veda- Vimarsha is OPINION Presented ( = mata – vichara)
and NOT ***‘ Bhashaantara’*** ***‘ Vyaakhyaana - Bhaashya – Teekaa /Tippani’***



 Thus, **Jains and Buddhists, Charvakas** **critique Vedas** from their preferred philosophical position and then ‘ interpret Veda- Sukta document and practices’ as it serves their position. Charvaka finds no use for Vedas in a ‘ one life for enjoyment’ schema ! Jains find ‘ himsaa- pashu ghaata’ and reject Vedas ; Buddhists want ‘Dharma’ and ‘Nibbana’, but don’t want ‘ Vedas as Transcendental authority on
Dharma’ and ‘ Moksha as Purushaartha’. **Yet, all these three schools used the language standards of Samskrutham to ‘ interpret Veda and its observed practices’. **

****

 In the Aastika darshanas, **Nyaya-Viasheshika and Saamkhya-Yoga
****interpret and provide arguments to fit and accept supreme authority of Vedas** ; but they differ on the ‘ Origin and Authorship issues of Vedas’. **Yet, these three schools used the language standards of Samskrutham to ‘ interpret Veda and its observed practices’. **

****

In the Aastika darshanas, **Poorva and Uttara meemaasaa, selectively construct arguments to accept supreme authority of Vedas and construct the Utility- Application Goal of Vedas differently**.
Meemaamsakas want Veda as ‘ Yajna-Karma’ authority; and use the filter of ‘artha-vaadas’ . Vedantins want Veda to be aligned to the ‘ Upanishads’ and take the ‘ Prasthan-Traya route to put forth their views. They use the filter of ‘Maha-vakyas and Layered meaning of Words’. The skills in deployment of Language – Grammar – Text Construction tools do vary across each school ; **Yet, these schools used the language standards of Samskrutham to ‘ interpret Veda and its observed practices’. **





2. The Colonial and Oriental scholars make a ‘ Sandwich of Convenience and Soup of personal academic taste’ to serve to preferred audience and with a brand stamped on it, on what they think about ‘ Veda and then Translation and Commentary of Vedas’. T**hese schools simply violate the integrity and internal consistency of the language standards of Samskrutham to ‘ interpret Veda and its observed practices’ and bring out the \< indigenous voice>. **

****

**3. Traditional schools present their position on two issues of ‘ Veda and Language-Tools to understand Vedic **‘matter, content and intent ( = vastu, artha and taatparya) of Veda, which helps to practice Yajna. The details are to be seen in the books from Shaunaka and others provide the importance of Rishi –Devataa – Chandas – Sukta- Viniyoga directions. The social outreach of this is seen in Aagama, Purana, Tantra as Devataa- Poojaa – Sandhyaa Vidhi, which again comes as ‘ Brahmana Vaidika Poojaa Vidhi’. This has a social, cultural, philosophical and religion-relevance. The interest is to address the question: How to live Good, Peaceful now? What to do achieve Moksha ? In this approach, Veda – abhyasa is by Mantra- Yoga-Samskrutham Language Practice and Validated by Seers and Yogi-Sages. ****



** Post-Colonial Academic and Oriental schools present their position on the two issues of ‘ Veda and Language-Tools to understand the **‘matter, content and intent ( = vastu, artha and taatparya) of Veda, to learn the history and practices of a land and religion. This has a class room, history of religion-relevance. The interest is to address the question: How they lived and what they did ? What was their faith-belief- practice ? Relevant only to make a museum of past society ! In this approach, Veda – Translation and Commentary is by Classical Language Scholarship and Validated by Peers and publications. ****



The social outreach of this is seen in history of Hinduism, World Religions and Media presentations detailing Social Caste- Creed practices attacking ‘ Brahmana community’ for socio-historical ills of Bharath !



4. Thus, I am also on the lookout and help from scholars to explore any new translation which would truly bring out the \< indigenous voice>. If someone really intends to make an effort in this direction, the starting book could be : Vedartha Samgraha - Sri Ramanujaacharya
(<https://archive.org/details/VedarthaSangraha> ) Where one can see the position of tradition in approaching ‘Vedas’. The term ‘Vedaartha’ – means ‘ Purpose of Vedas ,Vedas as means for a purpose’. It is NOT limited to ‘ Translation- Commentary model of Vedic Studies’. Acharya Madhwa’s guidance needs to be integrated on this to get a better picture on use of ‘ Samskrutham Language Tools’ and address the standards of ‘ Translation- pedagogy’. The extract below is from Vedartha Samgraha .

The current global society may not want this model; yet that is no reason to suppress the \< indigenous voice> which shaped ‘Bharatheeya Sampradayas’.
