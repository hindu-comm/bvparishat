Dear Shri Karve,

  

  I hope you can think some better wording for your question: "What makes Madhav Deshpande so obsessed with poetry?" I would not have imagined that one would use the word "obsession" to describe someone's love for poetry. I think it would be a pretty terrible thing to say that Sanskrit poets were "obsessed" with poetry.
