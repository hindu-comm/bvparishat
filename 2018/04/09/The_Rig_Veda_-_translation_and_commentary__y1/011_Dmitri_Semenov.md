J&B translation still follows Geldner's idea that RV is a poetic excess over a simple content.  
What J&B translation adds is assigning new meaning to several words, but otherwise clarifies little beyond Sayana.  
The translation has very few commentaries and those that are given put emphasis on poetic qualities of the suktas.  
In general, they follow naturalistic interpretation of devas without elaboration/justification of it.
