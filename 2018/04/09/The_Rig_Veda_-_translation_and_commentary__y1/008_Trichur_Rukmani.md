Such critical reviews from a erudite Sanskrit scholar needs to be widely disseminated. Could you please send it to the AAR Journal as well as the Journal of Indian Philosophy and the Hindu Studies Journal of the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies. For too long we have swallowed what the others have represented as our texts and we have not responded in the appropriate fora. My earnest request is that this review must be sent to the Journals I have mentioned so that the indigenous voice can be heard. Philosophy East West is also another Journal which can be approached.

Thank you
