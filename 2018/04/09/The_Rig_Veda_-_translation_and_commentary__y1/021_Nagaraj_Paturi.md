1\. Multiple interpretations of mantra bhaaga of the Veda are found already there in the braamhaNas and aaraNyakas.

  

2\. What yaaska is doing by enlisting adhiyajna, aadhibhautika, aadhidaivika, aadhyaatmika or any other kind of arthas is classifying these already available interpretations in the braamhaNas and aaraNyakas.

  

3\. Aadhyaatmika interpretation of the mantra bhaaga is what is found in the sections of braamhaNas and aaraNyakas that are given the name 'Upanishads', though they do not provide a mantra-wise explanation covering all the mantras.

  

4\. Thus aadhyaatmika interpretation of mantras is neither new nor little.

  

5\. Since the entire Vedanta tradition is built on the foundation of
the sections of braamhaNas and aaraNyakas that are given the name 'Upanishads',entire Vedanta tradition is a huge edifice built on the aadyaatmika interpretation of the mantras only , thought is edifice does not provide a mantra-wise explanation covering all the mantras.

  

6. What distinguishes the interpretations by 'modern' bhaashyakaaras/commentators/translators such as Swami Dayananda Sarasvati, Sri Aurobindo, Sri Kapali Sastri etc., from the pre-modern ones is that the modern ones are informed /influenced by 'science(s)' and not that they created any new aadhyatmika interpretation that did not exist or existed little in the pre-modern times.
