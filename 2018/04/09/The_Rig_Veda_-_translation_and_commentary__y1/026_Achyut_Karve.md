'Language is not that crucial --- if an idea can be understood, it can be expressed in any language with rich vocabulary.  
It is not about "language tools", but about "idea tools". '

  

As far as the Vedas are concerned this statement is questionable. In fact more justice will be done to the Vedas especially the Rig Veda if it is appreciated as an evolution of a literary language tool.
