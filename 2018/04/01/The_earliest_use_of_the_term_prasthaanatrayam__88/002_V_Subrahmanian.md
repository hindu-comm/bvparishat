Dear Shri Madhav ji,

  

This is very interesting. It looks like he is referring to the Brahma sutras which are held to be nyaya prasthanam, as he is saying 'this is a compendium/compilation of aagama, which can mean Veda and in this context, Upanishads, which are also held to be Agama pramana. Let us hear more explanations.
