Dear Shri Subramanian,

  

  The term nyāyaprasthāna is used by Bhartr̥hari in his Vākyapadīya:

  

*न्यायप्रस्थानमार्गांस्तानभ्यस्य स्वं च दर्शनम्*। प्रणीतो गुरुणास्माकं अयं आगमसंग्रहः । । २.४८७ । ।  

  

It does not refer to the Prasthānatraya of Vedānta, but the term is used to refer to foundational sources of various traditions. Perhaps Ashok Aklujkar can enlighten us further on the significance of this term.
