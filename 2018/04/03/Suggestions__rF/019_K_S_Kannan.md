Dear Prof. Deshpande-ji,

  

Thank you for your kind interest.

  

Unfortunately, the Bangalore University has the soft copy/pdf,

and I have not been able to procure the same.

I guess you know well the difficulties with our universities.

  

(Even the grammatical *nyAya* I cited (as from VAmana) is in the Notes of the said book.)

  

If and when I am able to procure a pdf of the book,

I would be happy to send you the same.

  

Regards

KSKannan

  

p.s.: Many works of Mandikal Rama Sastri are available on the Internet Archive.
