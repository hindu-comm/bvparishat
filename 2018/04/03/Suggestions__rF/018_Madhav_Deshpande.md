Thanks everyone for suggestions. What a great discussion! On such occasions, the BVP shines brightly. I found on my harddrive a pdf of the 1914 edition of Bhaimī-Pariṇaya-Nāṭaka by Mandikal Rama Sastri. At 5+ megabytes, I probably cannot send as an attachment to the list. But I would be happy to share it. Kannanji, is your newer edition available as a pdf?
