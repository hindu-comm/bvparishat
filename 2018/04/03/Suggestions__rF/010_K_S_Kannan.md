Not in *Samayocita-padyamālikā.*

It is in *Subhāṣita-ratna-bhāṇḍāgāra*, and cited as from *Subhāṣitāvalī.*

*  
*

I have cited this verse in my Notes on *Bhaimī-pariṇaya-nāṭaka-saṅgraha* (abridgement mine),

where the original author, Mandikal Ramasastri (Mysore, 1849-1929), adapts the idea of the verse

as the words of Damayantī's friend to Nala (when he is about to depart, after acting as a messenger of the gods) :

***  
yady ākhyāsyati gamyatām iti vaca**ḥ**, tat syād anāsthāparam***

******

***   ***

***mā gaccheti na sādhu, yat paravatī, yac cedam anta**ḥ**puram/***

***svecchā-sammatam ācareti bha**ṇ**itis tā**ṭ**asthya-hetur bhavet***

******

***   ***

***tad vaktavyam apāsya na**ḥ** priya-sakhī mauna-cchalāt tāmyati//***
