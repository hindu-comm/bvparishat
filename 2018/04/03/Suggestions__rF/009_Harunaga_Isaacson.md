It may well be older than the Padyāvalī, I think. A form of it (with several differences, admittedly, and differing particularly in the fourth quarter; see below) can be found in the Subhāṣitāvalī (also known as Subhāṣitāvali), the collection of subhāṣitas made by a Vallabhadeva (probably not the early kāvya-commentator) in Kashmir. (The question of the date of this anthology  
has been much discussed. Summarizing the discussions, L. Sternbach, in his Subhāṣita, Gnomic and Didactic Literature,  
writes that 'It is generally accepted, however, that this anthology, in the form in which it is available today, can not have been compiled  
earlier than the 15th century. ... It was believed that the Subhāṣitāvalī of Śrīvara is associated with this  
subhāṣita-saṃgraha. Śrīvara lived in the latter part of the 15th century and was the disciple of Jonarāja. However, it was  
proved that this Subhāṣitāvalī is another text of Vallabhadeva's Subhāṣitāvalī with a few additional verses,  
some of which ascribe this anthology to Śrīvara.' (pp. 22-23.) This would put the text of Vallabhadeva's anthology  
somewhere in the 15th century, it seems. A. Sanderson has pointed out though that Subhāṣitāvalī 3038 is by, and is attributed  
in the Subhāṣitāvalī to, Jonarāja. If that is not an 'additional verse', we are looking at a time very close to that of Śrīvara, in the  
latter part of the 15th century or at the very beginning perhaps of the 16th. Even so we can be rather confident that a verse  
in this anthology is older than the Padyāvalī of Rūpa Gosvāmin, who died in 1564.)  
  
The form of the verse that we find in the Subhāṣitāvalī, where it is vs. 1049, is this:  
  
मा याहीत्यपमङ्गलं व्रज किल स्नेहेन शून्यं वच-  
स्तिष्ठेति प्रभुता यथारुचि कुरुष्वैषाप्युदासीनता\|  
नो जीवामि विना त्वयेति वचनं सम्भाव्यते वा न वा  
तन्मां शिक्षय नाथ यत्समुचितं वक्तुं त्वयि प्रस्थिते\|\|  
  
And it is ascribed there thus:  
दाक्षिणात्यस्य कस्यचित् .  
  
It may be worth pointing out, by the way, that in Rūpa Gosvāmin's anthology Padyāvalī the readings differ not only from  
those in the Subhāṣitāvalī but also, notably in the third quarter, from the readings quoted by Shri GSS Murthy. They are thus:  
  
मा गा इत्यपमङ्गलं व्रज सखे स्नेहेन शून्यं वचः

  
तिष्ठेति प्रभुता यथाभिलषितं कुर्वित्युदासीनता\|  
ब्रूमो हन्त सुदाम मित्र वचनं नैवोपचारादिदं  

स्मर्तव्या वयमादरेण भवता यावद् भवद्दर्शनम्\|\|  
  
This is vs. 377, and as for an author ascription, Rūpa Gosvāmin adds  
हरेः .  
  
I believe that Rūpa Gosvāmin not infrequently made some changes to the  
verses he included in his anthology, so that they could more easily be  
applied to the context of his Caitanya-ite Kṛṣṇabhakti.
