Namaskar,

  

The meaning of Yajna as a vedic ritual is well-known. I am not referring to that.

  

I am looking deeper into the concept of Yajna, inspired by the meaning that Sri Krishna brings to it in Chap 4 of the Bhagavad Gita.

  

Here, Sri Krishna talks about Yajna as a giving, as a sacrifice - of action. That is, the sense here is of unimpelled action - action undertaken first, in the sense of giving away. The examples are the giving away of sense-objects, the sacrifice of prana (pranayama), sacrifice by deep study (jnanayoga) etc.

  

(But let's not get into the renunciation/tyaga concept or karma-yoga concept that are analogous to it. That's a different discussion.)

  

My doubt is - Why is Yajna or sacrifice so important? What makes it so significant? In other words, ****why should one sacrifice? And why should one sacrifice first?****

  

The sense I am getting is that Yajna or sacrifice is important because it sets the action-reaction link in motion. We cannot start with a reaction. We can only start with an action.

  

I request scholars here to set me on the right path to understanding what is "behind" the usual/surface meaning of Yajna or sacrifice.

  

kind regards

Harsha
