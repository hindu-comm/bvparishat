namaste,

  

It should be kept in mind that the upacharas also represent a progression from the adhyatmika point of view. The Bhavanopanishad touches on this in the 3rd anuvaka which starts with: सलिलं सौहित्यकारणं सत्त्वं कर्तव्यमकर्तव्यमिति भावनायुक्त उपचारः। अस्ति नास्तीति कर्तव्यता उपचारः। Upanishad Brahma Yogin's commentary on the anuvaka is useful.  
  
Narayanan Namboodiri -- a traditional tantri -- writes that the "\[shodashopachara puja\] signifies the arousal of ‘Kundalini’ and the showering of the nectar from the Sahasrara Padmam". I am omitting the link to his blog post in this scholarly forum, though it does convey the view of some upasakas.

  

There are verses on the shodashopacharas in the 'vivarana' commentary on the prapancha sara (in the 6th patala) which also hint at similar interpretations, though it is not stated directly. Similar verses are also present in the 'पदार्थदर्श' commentary on the Sharada Tilala Tantra where it deals with the upacharas.
