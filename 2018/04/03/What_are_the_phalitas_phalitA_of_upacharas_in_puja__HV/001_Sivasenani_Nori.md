Sir

  

Salutations to you.

  

I remember reading in Mimamsa that Puja is done in the same way that we treat a guest. Continuing that line of thinking, the purposes would be strictly laukika: aasana would be for sitting (or aavaahana to create a feeling of warmth in the one being received), paadya to clean feet, arghya to clean hands, aacamana to quench thirst, snaana for cleanliness, vastra for covering one self, yajnopaveeta for karmaanushThaanayogyataa and so on (Mimamsa can be brutally rational - where there is drishTaprayojana, why create adrishTaprayojana?).

  

There is a very nice song (shoDaSakaLaanidhi ki shoDaSopacaaramulu ... samarpayaami - this otherwise Telugu song has one Sanskrit verb recurring, in a kind of Manipravaala style) written by Annamaachaarya on the sixteen upacaaras, which is dhvani-pradhaana. There the poet submits that he, the devotee, offers a seat to the one who pervades the universe, water to the one from whose feet Ganga emanates and so on (<https://pedia.desibantu.com/shodasa-kalanidhiki/> - has lyrics in Telugu script; [YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYSlI6twQtU)). The Dhvani in the song, brought out very powerfully, is the insignificance of man in front of the Lord; the meaninglessness of upacaaras from the point of view of what the Lord already has. The pratItArtha, then, is that upacaaras are for the satisfaction of the devotee, that he has done the best he could for the omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient Lord. I do think that the great Annamacharya had the exact section of Mimamsa that I talked about, in mind while writing this song.

  

If this line of thinking appeals to you, I can dig out the relevant parts of Mimamsa and share them. Otherwise, I join you curiously to know other points of view.

  

Regards

N. Siva Senani
