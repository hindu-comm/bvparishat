The above sentiment is brought out in this verse of the Shivanandalahari:

  

वस्त्रोद्धूतविधौ सहस्रकरता पुष्पार्चने विष्णुता

गन्धे गन्धवहात्मताऽन्नपचने बर्हिर्मुखाध्यक्षता ।

पात्रे काञ्चनगर्भतास्ति मयि चेत्बालेन्दुचूडामणे

शुश्रूषां करवाणि ते पशुपते स्वामिन् त्रिलोकीगुरो ॥३०॥

  

Like the Sun if I have a thousand hands to clothe your form, like Vishnu if I am all-pervading to offer worship to you with flowers from everywhere, like the wind if I can carry fragrance everywhere to offer you incense, like Indra if I can control fire to cook food for you and offer it in vessels made of gold if I were Hiranyagarbbha, then I will serve (in a manner befitting your majesty and grandeur) you O the Lord of all beings, Master and the Teacher of the three worlds.
