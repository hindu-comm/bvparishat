I appreciate the views by Sri Sivasenani! There was an excellent discussion related to philosophical and ritualistic nature of the custom, in the thread pointed by Prof. Paturi ji.  

  

Nowadays, we use the artificial karpura for neeraajanam. This causes deadly respiratory diseases. Archakas are the worst effected people by inhaling it for most part of the day as part of their duty. Indeed, karpura is a herbal product. Even now, some households use a pinch of karupura in dishes like paayasam etc. Use of karpura in temples might have a scientific background too. It would balance the kapha, removes skin diseases, itching etc. 14 types of karpura has been mentioned in Rajanighantu.  

  

Just another thought!
