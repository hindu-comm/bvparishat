once I got a look on the names of continents in Sanskrit at Tirumala in some library or Museum which I took a picture and lost the same long back some of my friends living in abroad had a query about the Sankalpa to say in their place.  
So I request any of the Scholars please do share the information about the names of various continents in Sanskrit.
