Dear Madhvaji,

They are individually beautiful.

Doing languages and cultural studies with home in Physics, I do wander a lot.

But to wander and produce nuggets easily is a rare skill!

Please do wander in another direction and write a piece on "Humanity" as we have chosen the topic

for our Poetry meeting next month.

Let the creativity flourish!

Bijoy
