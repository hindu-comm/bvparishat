Thank you, Anandji, for your appreciation. I developed love for Jayadeva's Gītagovinda since my childhood. A friend of my father used to visit our home periodically and recite Gītagovinda for him. Some of my images and vocabulary are indebted to Jayadeva. Anyway, I am so happy to have found readers on this forum who delight in Sanskrit poetry. With best wishes,
