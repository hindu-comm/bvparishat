Dear Madhavji,

  

The poetic abilities of our Pune-bred immigrant scholar is admirable.

Let me suggest that you keep composing and organize the

material in different contexts.

  

Madhava - bala, gopala, yashoda, dadhi etc

Madhava - radha, viraha, rasa,

Madhava - rukmini, vakrokti, shlesa, more

  

it can continue.

  

I wish I had a fraction of the talents. Long time ago I tried some when I visited Dwaraka.

I have to look. Poetry is a spell.

  

Please send me a Sanskrit poem for our annual Harvard Poetry meet.

I am attaching the flier.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy
