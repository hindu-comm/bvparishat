Dear Prof. Deshpande,

  

Entitled *Rasa-brahma-samarthanam*,

it will come as a part of Vol. 4 of the series of books I am editing.

It is due to appear in a month or so.

  

The volume also contains Dr. Sankara Rajaraman's brilliant article

reviewing some of the translations/editions of Sanskrit verses/works

by some eminent modern Sanskrit scholars, and their pitfalls.

  

Regards
