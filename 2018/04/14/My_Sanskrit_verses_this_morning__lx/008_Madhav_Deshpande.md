Thank you Dr. Ramaratnam for your kind words. I have not thought of a Mahākāvya yet, but who knows, a compelling subject may emerge in the future. In part because of my recent retirement from the University of Michigan, and the new freedom from teaching and administrative duties, I have more time to devote my attention to poetic thoughts. Thank you once again.
