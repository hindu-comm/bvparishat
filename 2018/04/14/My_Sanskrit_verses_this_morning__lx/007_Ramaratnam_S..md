On behalf of the group members I profusely thank Dr. Madhav Deshpande for his beautiful verses. They are simple but at the same time deep in meaning. I really enjoy the slesha in many of these verses. I would like to suggest that Dr. Madhav Deshpande may write a mahakavya on his own choice of the theme for the benefit of the Sanskrit world, if he has not composed any so far.
