Dear Friends and scholars

Recently, while reading about the commentaries of Brahmasutras I found a reference about varahasahodaravrtti. the original source of this reference is the introduction of Dr. S Radhakrishnan to his translation of Brahmasutras,( Brahma Sutra, The Philosophy of Spiritual Life, p.26). Many scholars repeated the finding of Radhakrishnan. But neither Radhakrishnan nor the subsequent scholars who quoted him have disclosed the source of this vital information. the Advaita 'guru parampara sloka' or the bibliographies of Advaita texts (That of Pattabhrama Sastri and Tangaswami) never refer this Brahmasutra Vrtti by 'VARAHASAHODARA'. If anybody knows about it please share.
