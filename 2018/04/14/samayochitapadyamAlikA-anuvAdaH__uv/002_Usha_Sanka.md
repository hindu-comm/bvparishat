Hariom. Thankyou for the information.

Just sharing an update- A translation in Telugu is available.. though not with the same name.. and not for all shlokas, in the same order.

On the pointer by Shivakumari Katuri, I checked. Shri Pullela Shrirama Chandrudu's translation is there with name- संस्कृतसूक्तिरत्नकोशः, प्रथमामञ्जूषा (whole in Telugu script)। Almost it is nearby, with all shlokas in अकारादि.

Just in case someone would want any information in future, BVP will be a source. :) So sharing.
