Namaste

One information needed on behalf of someone.

Is there any translation/commentary available for समयोचितपद्यमालिका ?

  

(Original mulam in Devanagari Samskrtam is here--
<https://archive.org/details/SamayochitaPadyamalikaGangadharKrishnaDravidNirnayaSagarPress1927> )

  

Is it translated into any Indian language? (preferably) Telugu?

  

\[I checked net resources.. Google showed some random verses in some sites, but not any complete translation.

BVP had one query upon this issue, but only a subhashita site was pointed with only two verses.\]

  

Thanks to everyone in advance. Humble regards and pranamas
