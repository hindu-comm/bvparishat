Hearty Congratulations to you Dr Kannan for this recognition of your unique contribution to indological studies. This is just a beginning of the many recognitions which are bound to come your way in your career.

I would also like to congratulate Meera who has been such a pillar of support in all your endeavours. Since I have been at the Institute two times as a fellow I have fond memories of the place.

All the best
