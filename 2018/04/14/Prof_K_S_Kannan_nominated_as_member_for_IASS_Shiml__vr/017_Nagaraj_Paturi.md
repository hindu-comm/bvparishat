How I wish I was here in front of this system earlier than this, at the moment of arrival of this great news!

  

Highly suitable recognition to a well deserving versatile ambidextrous genius of Sanskrit and modern traditions, whose passionate commitment to the nationalist approach to Indology is sure to enrich the premier academic body of the nation.

  

Moment of celebration for all the BVPites.

  

Congratulations to Prof. Kannan!
