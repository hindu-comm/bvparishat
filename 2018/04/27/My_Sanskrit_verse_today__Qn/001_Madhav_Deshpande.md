I am told by a few friends that they see in the second line of my verse the word "muktāduyatiṃ". The Devanagari on my MacBook clearly reads "muktādyutiṃ." So there is some issue in how Devanagari Unicode typed on a MacBook gets displayed elsewhere. I don't have a way of solving this dilemma. I would appreciate if anyone has suggestions. Best,
