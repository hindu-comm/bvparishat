Wow! Thanks Andrew for your response. Frankly, I didn't expect anyone to respond, let alone someone from Microsoft. So, I am extremely surprised. Thanks for your support. Yes, it is only on the browsers where *dyu* appears as*duya*. I hope theHarfbuzzdevelopers can issue a fix soon.

  

Furthermore, I am not sure if it is a good decision to display dyu with explicit virama, but that's a different discussion.I have many other questions on the implementation of Nirmala UI for other Indian languages. I will reach out to you offline.

  

Thanks again,

Suresh.
