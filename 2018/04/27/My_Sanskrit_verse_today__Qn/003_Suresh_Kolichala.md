Dear Madhavji,

  

  

There is nothing wrong with your *dyutiṃ*. It is the problem with the font. The default font on Microsoft windows was changed from Mangal font to Nirmala font, in Windows 10 (actually from Windows 8). The rendering of *dyu* is not correctly implemented in Nirmala font. So, unfortunately, everyone using Microsoft windows 10 would find your
*muktādyutiṃ* as *muktāduyatiṃ*.

  

You can see how your text appears in various fonts as shown below:

I hope someone at Microsoft is working to rid their default font of all these bugs.

  

Regards,

Suresh.
