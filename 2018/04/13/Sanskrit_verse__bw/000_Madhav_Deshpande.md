Reading the beautiful Sanskrit poems of Shankar Rajaraman, I am inspired to write a verse of my own:

  

माधवं प्राप्य दुर्बुद्धे मा धाव तदनन्तरम् ।

कल्पवृक्षं समासाद्य किमेरण्डे प्रयोजनम् ।।

"O Dullard, having attained Mādhava \[Krishna, Lord\], don't keep on running \[mā dhāva\] after that. Having found the wish-fulfilling tree, what is the purpose in going after the caster-oil shrub?
