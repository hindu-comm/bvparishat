Or, having obtained \[the poetry of Sri\] Madhava \[Deshpande\], don't keep on running \[for more\] after that....

  

Or, it is just a continuation of the old tradition of including the poet's name either in a bandhakaavya or in plain sight - like the Vaaggeyakaaras.

  

Nice triple play (abhanga slesha, followed by sabhanga slesha) on the word Madhava, Sir. üôè
