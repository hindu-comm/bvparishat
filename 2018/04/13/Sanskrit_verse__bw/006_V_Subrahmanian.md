For those who love play of words, here is one, the invocation of Sridhara Swamin to his commentary to the Srimadbhaagavatam:

  

  

माधवोमाधवावीशौसर्वसिद्धिविधायिनौ। वन्दे परस्परात्मानौ परस्परनुतिप्रियौ॥  

  

I bow to Mādhava and Umādhava (Shiva) who are both 'Isha-s', Supreme Lords.They are capable of bestowing all accomplishments (to their devotees).They are both the selves of each other and both love to engage in the stuti of each other.
