Dear list

  

I have Mallinātha’s *Sañjīvanī* and Bhaṭṭahemādri’s *Raghuvaṃśadarpaṇa*on the *Raghuvaṃśa*.



Have the following commentaries on *Raghuvaṃśa*ever been published?

1.  Vallabhadeva’s *Pañjikā*  
2.  Dinakaramiśra’s *Subodhinī*  
3.  Cāritravardhana’s *Śiśuhitaiṣiṇī*  
4.  Sumativijaya’s *Sugamānvayā*  

As per the preface of the edition of*Raghuvaṃśa*by Pt. N R Acharya (Nirnay Sagar Press 1948), the manuscripts of the above four were available with BORI in 1948. Pt. Acharya did publish some citations from all four as footnotes but they are minimal extracts only.

  

Thanks, Nityānanda Miśra
