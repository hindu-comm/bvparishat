Namaste,

  

Attaching bibliography from Dominic Goodall's edn of Raghuvamsa, received from a scholar who is not a member of the group (I will invite him to join BVP). He hopes this discussion on Raghuvamsa would give a chance to remind Sanskrit scholars again of the heavy unpublished materials that we are still having with us. many commentaries still remain unpublished!!!  

  

  

regards  
shankara
