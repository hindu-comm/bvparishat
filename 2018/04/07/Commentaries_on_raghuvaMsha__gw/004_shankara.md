Misraji,

  

Sorry for the wrong link to Goodall's edition of Raghuvamsa. Giving below the right link. It seems the book has not been made available online.  

[The Raghuvaṃśa of Kālidāsa with its earliest commentary: the Raghupañcikā of Vallabhadeva. Volume 1. (ed. GOODALL & Harunaga ISAACSON)](https://www.academia.edu/3338110/The_Raghuva%E1%B9%83%C5%9Ba_of_K%C4%81lid%C4%81sa_with_its_earliest_commentary_the_Raghupa%C3%B1cik%C4%81_of_Vallabhadeva._Volume_1._ed._GOODALL_and_Harunaga_ISAACSON_)

  

regards  
shankara
