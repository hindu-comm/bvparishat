Thanks for this reference. Could you please share the karika along with the source book reference? It is true that the sodakumbha is to be performed daily. It is only because it is not possible for most people, the monthly practice is in vogue. I have heard of a family in Kerala, Palakkad, Banker M.N.Ramaswamy Iyer, performed nitya shraaddham for one whole year. It seems the family would buy the udaka paatram in wholesale and transport it to their house in their car.
