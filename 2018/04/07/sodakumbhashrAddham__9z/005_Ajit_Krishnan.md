namaste,

  

The first half of the karika is also useful:कुर्यादहरहः श्राद्धममावास्यां विना सदा।यत्सोदकलशश्राद्धं न तत्स्यादनुमासिके॥

  

The Mylapore vedadhyayana sabha edition has a tamil translation along with the verses. The first volume of the 'grantha pushpa mala' published by Swarnapuri contains a reprint of an old grantha edition of the karikas -- the reproduction quality is poor, but 99% of it is legible.
