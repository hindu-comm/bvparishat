सोदकुम्भश्राद्धम्  

  

There is a practice of the 'sodakumbha-shraaddham' among smarta Tamils where the Brahmana(s) is given a water pot (chombu) or equivalent along with bhojana. This sraaddham is different from the regular shraaddham that occurs on the next day. This twin-shraaddham is performed every month throughout the first year of the death of a pitru.

  

I would like to know if there is any textual vidhi for this sodakumbha shraaddham. I found one here:

  

<https://sa.wikisource.org/s/uoz> which is from the Vaikhanasa gruhya sutras. Is there any such vidhi in the Apastamba or Vaidyanaatheeyam?  

  

warm regards
