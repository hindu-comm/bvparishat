Namaste VS mahodaya,  
This question on purpose is safely ignored as seen from activity in other posts. The deep rooted following of vedantic virakti misleads not qualified for vedantic practicioners as opportunistic selfishness of seeking help by chanting narayana till the bridge is crossed and forget as "kuuraayana". For our modern culture it is easy to excuse oneself with five lettered word contributed by invaders culture aimed at opportunism . Only wearer of shoe knows where the pinch is and only an avid book collector knows the difficulties in procuring, maintaining and sharing the hard earned books for public dissemination.  
Warm regards,  
Ganesh.
