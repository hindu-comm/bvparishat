Respected Members,

I am happy to inform that a book on Event-Time Prediction (ETP) or घटना-समय पद्धति, based on the lectures of Shri A B Shuklaji and compiled by me will be released on 21st April 2018 at Chandigarh. H.E. V P Singh Badnore, Governor of Punjab has kindly consented to release the book  
ETP is an innovation of Shri A B Shuklaji, a retired IAS officer and at present member of National Monuments Authority. This technique is an improvement of much popular prashna or horary astrology. Shri Shuklaji has devised this method by drawing inspiration from the mantras of RgVeda, Upanishads and shlokas of Bhagavadgita.  
The book can be purchased on Amazon by clicking on
