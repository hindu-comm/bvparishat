My colleagueProf. George James wanted to share this:

  

"On April 14, the Bhagwan Adinath Professorship in Jain Studies at the University of North Texas held a one day conference on the topic of Jainism and the Environment. The event featured the work of established scholars in the field of Jainism and Ecology as well as Jain Art and Architecture, History and Iconography, as well as the work of younger scholars opening new areas of research in Jain Studies. The event was well attended by students and faculty from UNT and neighboring Universities as well as members of the Jain community in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. It ended with a dinner recognizing local donors to the Bhagwan Adinath Professorship in Jain Studies, featuring a keynote address by the eminent scholar of Jain Studies Christopher Key Chapple".
