My friend gave the solution. A scholar told him the well-known story, a version of which is:

  

A blind man's child died. He asked his wife for the cause. She said that the child was being fed milk and in the process he suffocated and died. Then the conversation started about 'what is milk'? 'It is a liquid white in color'......

  

Here is a popular version: see attachment.
