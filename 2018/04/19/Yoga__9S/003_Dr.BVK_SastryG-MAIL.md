Namaste



***Question***: Do we have a definitional clarity and continuity on what the Samskruth term - ‘Yoga’ means ? in a historical time line ? What was the floating understanding in the intermediary two millennia before Patanjali and Post Patanjali ? What happened to the rest of the yoga definitions and their practice ? beyond ‘ Karma Yoga’? Why disconnect Patanjali from Gita ?



**Basis for the question: **



*Definition of Yoga*: Gita ( circa 3100 BCE) provided four definitions out of which योगः कर्मसु कौशलम् , समत्वं योग उच्यते occurs in different contexts and chapter discourses.



 ( How was Yoga handled in between this gap by - teams of Buddhists, Jains, agama, Saamkhya et al school ?

*Definition of Yoga* : Patanjali (Circa 200 BCE – based on work PYS and not yoga tradition itself) : 'Yoga Chitta vrutti nirodha' (1-1)



( Note: I am writing chapters in my book addressing these issues based on practice guidance across several sampradayas and ‘ darshana shaastra/ religion discourses’ referring to documents of Vedic origin, spanning over ten millennia. Samskrutham as language of
Yoga-discourse holds the key to understand –learn –practice all human languages for Yoga benefits. Samskrutham is the par excellence of this wisdom and practice. This may be the reason for calling ‘Samskrutham as ‘Vak-yoga’).
