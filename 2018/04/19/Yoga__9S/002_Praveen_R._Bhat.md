Namaste Achyutji,

  

Although many people interpret योगः कर्मसु कौशलम् as another Gita definition of Yoga, it is not quite so. It is an answer to an आकाङ्क्षा "किं नाम कौशलम्"? कर्मसु योगः कौशलमुच्यते। And Yoga is defined as समत्वं योग उच्यते। So कर्मसु समत्वं कौशलमुच्यते। It means कर्मयोगः and therefore, need not have any direct connection to योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः।
