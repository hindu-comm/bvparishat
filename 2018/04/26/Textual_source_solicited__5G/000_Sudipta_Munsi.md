Dear Scholars,

  

I am searching for a textual (preferably from Mimamsa; others will also do) source for the following problem -

  

Suppose one desires X (e.g., rain) and there is more than one kƒÅmya sacrifice to obtain it. In that case, one needs to perform only one.

  

I can't remember a specific source for that. I will be highly obliged if anyone helps in locating a specific textual source for the above.

  

Thanks in advance.

  

Best regards,

Sudipta Munsi
