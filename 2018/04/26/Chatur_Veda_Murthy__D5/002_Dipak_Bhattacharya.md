Attempts have been made earlier to introduce Veda worship on icons, as far as I remember, in the seventies or earlier with help from reputed scholars. This has no evident scriptural basis. It was so long ago that the details escape me. One may consult the Pratim¡gu¸adarpa¸a or the Jay¡khyasaÆhit¡ for any scriptural support. Though I did not find any, a scriptural basis may be sought.
