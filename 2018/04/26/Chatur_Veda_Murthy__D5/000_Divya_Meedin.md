Namaste

  

I recently came across a depiction of Chatur Veda Murtis along with their consorts. I would be grateful for more information about the deities, significance and reason behind their appearance etc. I am attaching the picture for reference.

  

Looking forward to information from the esteemed members.

  

Sincerely,

Divya
