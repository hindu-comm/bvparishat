Bhattacharyaji,

  

I copied and pasted the text from your post into MS Word and it shows that the font is 'DV1-TTYogesh'. It is a legacy font developed by C-DAC, not windows default font. This could be the reason the diacritic font appears illegible to others who don't have this font in thie PC or Tablet.  

  

BVP members who are knowledgeble in this matter may kindly correct me, if I am wrong.



regards  
shankara
