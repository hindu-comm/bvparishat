Namaste,

  

In the thread "The Scholar Whom Audrey Truschke Cites Finds Her Tweet ‘Shocking’" saw the message by DrNagaraj Paturi ji with link to"The Ramayana..." by Prof. Vishal Aggarwal in the"Hindu Dharma for Students" series. Amazing book for children (and adults too). Are the rest of the books in the series available?

  

Best regards,

  

Krishna Kumar M
