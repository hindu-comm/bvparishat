Namaste Vishal ji,


([HinduHeroes_Complete.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-_cyS7sAF4RWmxNWkdPeWprWkU/view))

Page 268 - map of India, please look at the Kashmir border drawn. Needs to be fixed, in my humble opinion.

Also, perhaps I'm being stupid here but couldn't find the other volumes of series at the link given. Could you please help me in locating.

  

Regards,

Virendra
