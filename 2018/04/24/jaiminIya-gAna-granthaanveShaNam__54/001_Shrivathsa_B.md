hariH OM,

  

 I don't know the structure of jaiminiiya. But in kauthuma, we have pUrva and uttrArcikas. The reason you may not be able to locate the saamans you need may be because they are in the uttarArcika. As far as I can see the kashi version you have put up ends with pavamaana kaaNDaH, hence it is not fully puurvaarcika either if we go by kauthuma structure. I am guessing because I know nothing about jaiminiiya and know a little about kauthuma.

  

 Please ask your AcArya if the whole samhitaa has been published. If not, that may be a need someone may have to fill.

  

 Even a stop gap solution is complicated. That is because the svara notations are represented differently in published books of kauthuma and jaiminiiya. The kAshii edition has only paaribhaaShika svaras, whereas kauthuma follows long form. And your AcArya may have seen only paaribhaaShika.

  

 Anyway... This is what you will have to do.

1\. Take the equivalent saamans from kauthuma. You will get them in the pUrvaprayoga book published bydrAhyAyaNapratiShThaana, an org run by my AcArya in Bangalore.

2\. Change them to paaribhaaShika svaras (you will find a table in sAmavedaparicaya book published by the same pratiShThaana).

3\. Take them to your AcArya and ensure that the svaras are alright by asking him to chant as per the svaras as given by you as per kauthuma. If not, he has to correct them (he only has to do this). It may turn out that there are variations from kauthuma. He has to give the final form.

4\. Publish the final form as the most authentic saaman under the circumstances imposed upon us by kaala.

5\. Another way of circumventing all this trouble may be to locate manuscripts of the whole saMhitA from somewhere and publish them.

  

 I wish you all the best in this and promise to be with you in this tedious task. I think the kauthumas have an advantage because of the saMhitA completely being published long ago.

  

svasti,

   bhavānībhāratī jayatetamām,

                         śrīvatsaḥ.
