Friends,

First I acknowledge the help of many here in our journey

to understand our roots. The tradition is long, deep and

diverse. We segment in time and contain the segment in

a day. We are at our fourth step now 200BC-500AD.

We call it the Golden Period. I am attaching our

program brochure. I would invite any of you, if around here

with a complimentary admission. Let me know.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
