The kaulikAs prescribe this as a part of 'bhairavi-chakra' ritual.
These were prevalent in places like Kamakhya etc. where the predominance is towards kauLa & vAma rituals.

  

However, for people like us, as prescribed byहयग्रीवाचार्यः inशाक्तकल्पः as:

  

**अद्वैतं ब्रह्मविद्या मार्गमेव**

  

The vritti for this sutra says:

  

सर्वैरपि मोक्षार्थे अद्वैतमार्ग एव स्वीकार्यः ....

  

So, the bhAvana for maithuna should be contemplated as 'Identity of oneself with devata'.
