He cannot do Oupasanam..

Should he do it in samidhaadanaagni?

Samidhaadaanam is to be performed in pratah kaala 06:00 to 08:24 am,
immediately afer sandhyavandanam and kaaayena vaaca to be done...

where as Sraadham is to be done in aparaanha kaalam or madhyahna kaala

should he do samrakshanam of samidhaadaanaagni till that time..?

Or samidhaadaanam is to be done in the aparahna kaala taking an exception in the name of doing sraaddham

  

What does dharma sastra say on this?

  

Request scholars to help on this..
