Dear sirs,

  

Having not studied the Rigveda and its bhashyam I wish to know the suktas which can be called as philosophical passages, such as the Purusha suktam, Nasadiya suktam, Asyavamiya Suktam etc.

  

There is a general impression (even among the teachers of Vedanta) that the samhita portions are totally about the rituals and only the Upanishads have the philosophical discussions. This has also led people to jump to the conclusion that it is all under the influence of Buddhism.

It will be interesting to know of the samhita portions more thoroughly. Hence the query. I will be grateful if someone can give a list of suktas.

Regards,

Aravinda Rao
