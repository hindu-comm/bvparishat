However Dr. C Kunhan Raja in his explanation of 'अस्य वामीय सूक्तम्' (R.V. i, 164-36) 'सप्तार्धगर्भा भुवनस्य रेतो विष्णोस्तिष्टन्ति प्रदिशा विधर्मणि' writes 'we don't know the exact significance of the seven-fold seed of creation of the world' referred to in this hymn and that we have 'lost the clue to the correct interpretation of the poem and do not know many of the symbols and conventions of those days' (Intro. pp xxxv and xxxviii, 'Asya Vamasya Hymn, Ganesh & Co., Madras, 1956). This is incorrect as the seven seeds of creation is identified as seven evolutes of Prakrti, in the Madhva tradition. A very good Samskrit Commentary of
'अस्य वामीय सूक्तम्' has been written & published by Dr. Bannanje Govindacarya, 2011.
