C. Kunhanraja's *Poet philosophers of the Rigveda*. The same holds good of Anirvan’s Vedamimamsa. The Hotri formulae too are, in a sense, philosophical. See Vishveshva ranand Indological Journal,1977 Sept. and 1978 March. A.K.Coomaraswamy’s The Rigveda as *Landnamabok* speaks of inner meaning of the Rks.
