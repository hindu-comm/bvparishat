namaste,  
  

In recent times, in my personal view, Sri RL Kashyap of [www.vedah.com](http://www.vedah.com) - SAKSI, has enunciated the adhyaatmik meanings of RV in the lines of Sri Aurobindo. SA's original work (a complex text) is: The Secret of Veda (pdf, sri aurobindo ashram and print format). All 4 vedas and some brahmanas have been commented, translated in this framework.  
  

RLK has gone to great lengths to delve into reasoning, interpretative imagery and explanation in various small booklets explaining the framework that may required a deep reading before going into translation...  
  

On the [archive.org](http://archive.org) and other places, you would see some works by SK Ramachandra rao (purusha sukta, for example) and a few other works.  
  

I believe, SA's student philosopher Sri Kapali Sastri's Rig bhashya bhumika is available publicly. That also would serve your question and may explain a few suktas listed by Sri Ganesh (particlarly, Vak sukta).  
  

You would hear, in response, that going to a teacher or two is the best way forward. That is true. The above points are for less fortunate mortals.
