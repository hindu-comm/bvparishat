Dear Sir,

  

Your intent is very apt and Noble. I am also eager to know the response of other learned members here.

  

I know well that many opine that all the suukta-s have one layer of aadhyaatmikaartha apart from their other levels of meaning. However it is better to resort to rjvartha and in this light, I think that Vushvakarmasuukta, HiraNyagarbhaduukta, Shraddhaasuukta, MEdhaasuukta, VaagambhraNisuukta are a few other hymns which have direct vedantic bearing.

  

Regards

  

Ganesh
