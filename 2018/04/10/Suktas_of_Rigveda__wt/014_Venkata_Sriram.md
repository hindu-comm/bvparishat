Dear Aravinda Rao Garu,

  

TTD has published major suktas of Rg Veda in Telugu with Sayana as the basis. Translated into simple telugu by Shri.Kurumaddali Hayagriva Sarma Garu who was close associate of my sanskrit teacher. Published in 2 volumes with simple commentary 'without diluting the intent of sayana'. I have purchased those 2 copies and gone thru them and found to be extremely useful for my swAdhyAya. The e-books are online here:

Apart from this, the major important suktas of Rg Veda are 1) Nasadiya 2) Asyavamiya. These have been published by RK Mutt with wonderful commentaries by Swami Harshananda Ji with short notes of Swamiji. Swami Atmananda, a great vedantin, also commented by Asyavamiya which was published by Dr.Kunhan Raja,

  

Here is the soft copy which contains both sayana & Atmananda's commentary. Atmananda's is found to be from shAkta's perspective as this commentary has mysticism of srividya. I gone thru that but need a thorough contemplation & meditation on this book while reading because certain esoteric concepts are tangential to me.
