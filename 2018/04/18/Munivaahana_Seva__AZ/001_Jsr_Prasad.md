Sri C.S. Rangarajan is an M.B.A. and had worked in the U.S. for more than 10 years before returning to India, to take over the family tradition. Recently, he was challenged by some Dalit (now, usage of the word is forbidden as per Supreme Court order) scholars in a TV debate. He proposed this seva called 'munivahana seva' and subsequently performed it, as per the report.
