श्रीमन्माधव महाभाग!  
  
मधुजिह्वः कविर्मान्यो माधवो माधवं स्मरन् ।  
स्मारयन्, सारयन् वाणीं मधुमद् व्यधदात् सदः॥  
This honey tongued respected poet Shri Madhava remembers and and helps us remember Lord Madhava through his words and has made this Parishat or Sadas drenched with hiney.  
  
प्रविशद्भिर्मधुवनमङ्गदप्रमुखैः यथा।  
मोदः प्राप्तस्तथास्माभिर्मधुमत्सद आगतैः॥  
As Angada and other were extremely happy to enter Madhuvana, we also feel extremely elated entering this Sadas that is drenched with honey like verses of Sri Madhava.
