Sivasenani sir's explanation is quite an obvious interpretation. It is  
completely logical that there are two fighters with the same name. It  
is a normal case to find two fighters with same name even in same  
regiment of Indian Army. Same is the case everywhere. So it is not at  
all surprising to have two Nikumbhas in Ravana's army.  
  
Also if someone says that Valmiki made mistake in this instance, that  
cannot be hold true. In the first instance of chapter 43, Nikumbha  
mentioned is not mentioned as Kumbhakarna's son while in the second  
instance (chapter 75-77) Nikumbha is mentioned as Kumbhakarna's son.  
Thus it can be safely concluded that the author has distinguished  
between the two.  
  
I enquired from the parishat to know if someone has some access to an  
old commentary or some other vedic sources which throws light on this  
matter. Otherwise the above interpretation stands shining.  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava Das,  
Damodara Das
