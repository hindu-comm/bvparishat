Namaste. Our tradition is to try and understand the intent of any speaker. In practical terms, this results in sympathetic interpretation. If a sentence of a person can be interpreted in two or more ways, and one or more interpretations result in contradictions, then we discard those interpretations as untenable. Example: Sun rises in the East. It is quite possible to argue that the Sun does not rise, or that there is no "East". Yet, the sentence is uttered and uniformly a tenable interpretation is applied. Why do we do this? This has been explained by Paul Grice, through his "Co-operative Principle". He has four maxims, the first of which is that the speaker has to tell the truth. The sub-area called Pragmatics in the field of Linguistics discusses these aspects in detail.  
  

So, whether we approach it in the traditional Indian way, or from the point of view of Linguistics, we have to first assume that Valmiki - or even an interpolator, if it comes to that - is speaking the truth. Then the only possible explanation is that the two Nikumbhas are different. Since there is no impediment (see possible objections answered below) to this explanation and since other explanations are defective, we need to accept this. No doubts need to be entertained in this regard.  
  

Now, if the question arises as to how there could be more than one Nikumbha, the answer is that it is perfectly normal. Maneka Gandhi compiled a very exhaustive book of Hindu names. This contains about 20,000 names. This is the most comprehensive collection of Hindu names that I have come across and believe after a fair amount of effort in that direction, that this definitely represents the ball-park figure of Hindu names generally used. In contrast, today we have nearly 100 crore Hindus. Even the number of villages at more than 6 lakh is 30 times more than the available Hindu names. So repetition of names will happen. If it be said that the population was lesser during Ramayana times, it may be pointed out that even central names like Rama (Bhaargave Raama, Daasarathi Rama etc.) and Vaasudeva (Paundareeka Vaasudeva and Krishna) were repeated in Ramayana times itself. Now, if it be said that we are being deliberately sympathetic to the author and not calling a mistake a mistake, we will happily agree that we are sympathetic. Ramayana survived for thousands of years and has spread over many countries, giving rise to numerous derivative works. It is certainly a text worthy of study - even by a Hinduphobe. A mad man's ramblings are not worthy of study; but if something is fit enough to be read, it is good enough to be interpreted sympathetically. If it be said that the narrator - in his fantastic imagination - forgot to ensure continuity, we say that it is pure speculation on the part of the critic, without any basis whatsoever.
