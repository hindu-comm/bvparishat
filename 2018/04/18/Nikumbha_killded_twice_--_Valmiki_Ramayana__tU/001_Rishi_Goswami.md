You should refer to Madhvacharya's Mahabharat Tatparya Nirnaya, which may have clarification.  
As I remember reading something similar to this, probably was related to another Kumbhakarna. There are two Kumbhakarnas as well.  
This maybe another Nikumbha, which you should check in the book itself.  
Namo Haraye.
