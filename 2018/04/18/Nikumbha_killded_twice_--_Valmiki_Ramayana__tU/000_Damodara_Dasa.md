Respected Vidvaj-janas,  
  
I came across one thing in Valmiki Ramayana and thus had a query.  
  
In Yuddhakanda, when the war starts, chapter 43 (see gitapress  
edition, also is same chapter for commentaries by Govnidaraja and  
others) verse 29-31, Nikumbha is killed by Nila.  
nikumbhastu raṇe nīlaṁ nīlāñjanacayaprabham \|  
nirbibheda śaraistīkṣṇaiḥ karairmeghamivāṁśumān \|\|  
punaḥ śaraśatenātha kṣiprahasto niśācaraḥ \|  
bibheda samare nīlaṁ nikumbhaḥ prajahāsa ca \|\|  
tasyaiva rathacakreṇa nīlo viṣṇurivāhave \|  
śiraściccheda samare nikumbhasya ca sāratheḥ \|\|Yuddhakanda (6).43.29-31 \|\|  
  
Then in chapter 77 nikumbha is killed by Hanuman after Kumbha is  
killed by Sugriva in chapter 76. Chapter 75 mentions that this  
Nikumbha was a son of Kumbhakarna.  
  
I have a doubt if Nikumbha is killed twice or is the Nikumbha killed  
in 43rd chapter different from the one killed in 77th chapter.  
  
Kindly enlighten.  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
Damodara Das
