Haraye Namah.  

Namaskar to all Vidvans.  

  

I have found certain links to Padma Purana, but unfortunately most of them are in English, and the ones which are in Hindi are not what I want.  

  

I am currently looking for Patala Khanda in it. I got very much confused when I saw some 10 volumes of it in English.  

I couldn't understand which one is the Patala Khanda.  

  

I hope there is a Patala Khanda available in Hindi.  

  

I have the Sankshipta Padma Purana, but the chapter I want, the Vaishakha Mahatmya and there are some shlokas, which I'm not able to understand just by reading the Sanskrit Text, I refer to Hindi. Those shlokas' meaning aren't available in Sankshipta Padma Purana.  

  

I don't wish to disturb any of you, but after searching the net for 2 hrs, I'm asking for help.  

  

Thankyou.
