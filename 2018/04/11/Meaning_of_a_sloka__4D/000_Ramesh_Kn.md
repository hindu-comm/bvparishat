Respected scholars,

  

Jitendriyah satyavadinityanushthanatatparah\|

kamadi-validanashcha sa vira iti giyate \|\|  

  

This sloka is from Mahanirvana tantra describing the qualities of a Veera or Hero.

  

nityanushthanatatparah - What isnityanushthana here? Is it the usual nitya karmas such as Snanam,sandhyavandanam etc? Or is it the nitya karmas of Sri Vidya Upasakas ? Or is it ANYTHING which one does every day regualrly?  

  

Also what is the meaningofkamadi-validanashchahere..?

  

thanks

namaskarams
