One would be perfectly justified in writingनिर्+ऋति as निरृति not necessarily as निर्ऋति. But then discretion suggests thatरृ would look very close to दृ as in दृश्.

  

I strongly believe that Sanskrit, as a language, whether written or spoken, seeks "discretion" विवेक. That is the hallmark of Sanskrit. For writing you have both optionsनिरृति orनिर्ऋति. Discretion demands that one should choose that option, which gives better clarity and would not cause confusion with writing of any other letter such asदृ.

  

BTW, I wonder how should the word "true" be writtenin देवनागरी - as ट्रू or as ट्रु or asटृ or as टॄ or as ट्-रू?! To my knowledge, there is no such combination in any word in Sanskrit, fortunately.
