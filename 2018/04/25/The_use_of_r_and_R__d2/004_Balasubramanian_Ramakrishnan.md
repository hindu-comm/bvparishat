BTW, a question to the scholars. How common isर्beforeऋ? Does it occur only as the transformation of s or the visarga before ऋ? I am assuming it is the nis which has transformed into nir in the word
निर्ऋति, I may well be wrong. I can't think of any example off the top of my head any examples from the कृष्णयजुर्वेद which is not निर्ऋतिor some derivative of it.
