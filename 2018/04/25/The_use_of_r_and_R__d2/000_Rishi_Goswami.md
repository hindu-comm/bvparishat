Haraye Namah.  
We have seen the word मृ and कृ etc, but have never come across रृ. Why so?  
  
र् is a vyanjan like ऋ। So, like मृ and कृ, there should be a रृ also.  
  
For eg, there is a word - निर्ऋति. Why does it written like this निर्ऋति and not like this निरृति?  
When र् is vyanjan and ऋ is swara, how when there is no vyanjan ahead, did the रेफ go on top, following jala-tumbika nyaya?  
  
निर्देश, निर्माल्य etc have रेफ on top because the latter alphabet is a vyanjana. But, words like निराधार, निरुत्तर are not written with रेफ on top?  
How did we write निर्+ऋति as निर्ऋति and not निरृति?  
Regards  
Rishi.
