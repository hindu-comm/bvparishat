A little late, but I think the issue is that the initial parts of
र्and ऋ are the same, so there is a distinction from other consonants in a phonological sense. If there were a ल् followed by the ऌ (which does not exist), we would have the same issue. This is brought out in the pronunciation of the vedic texts, which are probably the oldest well preserved pronunciations. The Tamil Rg vedins tend to pronounce the combination as a pure र्followed by theऋ. The black-yajurvedins do not like a free standing र्, so this is pronounced as a svarabhakti followed by theऋ. You can see the latter distinction brought out in the yajur texts printed in the grantha script where the र्is printed free standing.This does not seem to have any textual support as far as I know, as the svarabhakti is restricted to only the occurrence of the र् and ल् before श् ष् स् and ह् when the latter are followed by vowels as per the व्यासशिक्षा.
