\> This forum gives the impression of being full of males who think Sanskrit alone is the fount of all wisdom

\> full of males:

  

Fortunately there are a good number of women scholars with scholarship that is awe-inspiring for many male members in the list, participating in discussions and guiding the forum. But the number can be sought to be more. But lesser women members or lesser number of actively contributing women members is not unique to this forum.

  

\> who think Sanskrit alone is the fount of all wisdom.  

  

Sir, this forum has the first introductory sentence: " 'भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्'is a mailing list for Sanskrit researchers working from India."

  

Hence, greater focus on Sanskrit here.

  

I don't remember even a single post that gives the impression:Sanskrit alone is the fount of all wisdom. Even if there are a few such expressions of an innocent and intense samskritaabhimaana here and there, now and then, very very very rare ones they are not sufficient to make a sweeping generalisation that you make here.

  

Sir, as I pointed out earlier too, most of the threads in forums of this kind are devoted for book searches, searches for references and guidance for meanings etc. Next in number come the threads with announcements of events. Such threads which form the majority here stand obstructing any sweeping generalisation about the nature of the forum itself as 'Hindu fundamentalist' or ' being full of those who think Sanskrit alone is the fount of all wisdom ' etc.

  

Sri G S S Murthy-ji's claim was that the thread so far was 'Hindu fundamentalist.' He was told that that comment of him had no basis in the posts in the thread and as such was unwarranted. Your present post, though begins with his name and gives the impression of providing arguments for how his claim of Hindu fundamentalism was correct, in fact seems to be focusedon a totally different issue :

  

The following seems to be the crux of your argument that could be remotely connected to the present discussion in the thread:

  

" I'm clear that some people - I see them in the US - are making a career out of combating the ills of Pollockism etc. But they do not help Hindus to renew their understanding of their faith and their scripture in the changing times and environment in which Hindus find themselves. "

  

You may be right in your observations about those whom you have observed in US. But in what way is that relevant here. I don't get any monetary benefit or career by doing what I did in this thread. That is in no way my career. Those whom you observed in US do not seem to have contributed to this thread.

  

None of us is doing those marriage mantra interpretations and stuff. I don't think those who caused problems through their marriage mantra interpretations are anywhere in this story of Ramayana's interpretation.

  

There is certainly a very bad need of right interpretation of our mantras etc.

  

But that is a different topic for a different day.

  

If necessary let us demand those who are making their career out of combating Pollockism etc. to help Hindus to renew their understanding oftheir faith and their scripture in the changing times and environment in which Hindus find themselves."

  

But that is again a different topic for a different day.

  

This thread is focused on making Sita into a rabid feminist using phrases such as "misogynist pig" which she is not.

  

We are providing understanding tohelp Hindus to renew their understanding oftheir faith and their scripture in the changing times and environment in which Hindus find themselves. to the extent of this topic.
