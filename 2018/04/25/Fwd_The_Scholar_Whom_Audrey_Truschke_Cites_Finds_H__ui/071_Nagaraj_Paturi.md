Add to this, the news before this incident that a minister's son/daughter was held hostage in a flight and he/she had to get released only by releasing a dreaded terrorist leader. Later people came to know that the so called 'hostage' incident was a drama stage-managed by the 'hostage' himself /herself.

  

There were a few more such incidents.

  

Media suspecting the minister's son in the incident narrated earlier was because of such background only.

  

Minister's son says , "don't group all kidnapped persons or all kidnapped children of ministers in the same category". He tells his father, " Of all the people, dad, damn it, I never expected YOU to suspect me. Curse on you!"

  

---------------------------------

  

You might have noticed. There are frequent news of " a teenage /young girl goes missing". Parents file a complaint with the police. Make paper announcements. Move heaven and earth. Leave no stone unturned in their efforts to trace the girl. Based on circumstantial evidence, the police register a case of kidnap against a young man and announce it in the media. One fine/bad morning, the girl appears in a police station or in front of media and announces that she was not kidnapped , she went with her own will with the boy as they were in love and she wanted to marry him. "

  

After many such reports, in a similar case, the parents successfully trace the girl and bring her back home. The girl says that she was kidnapped. But people gossip /rumour that this is also a case similar to the earlier ones, the girl running away with her lover, but now she is cooking up the story of kidnap. When the girl is directly commented with these views, she says, " don't bundle up all girls into the same category". But in a fictional and in very rare real incidents, the boy is caught in another case by the police and confesses that he kidnapped the girl but did not touch her during her captivity. Let me tell you, the reality is, the rumour mongers do not stop. They continue commenting, " Why should you believe what a kidnapper says" . Let us extend this to another realistic possibility. Unable to bear with the nuisance of these comments, the girl attempts to commit suicide. In reality, in most such cases the girl dies.Sometimes she survives.In fictional and in very rare real incidents, video record of the entire captivity is found and is revealed to the public. Only then the maligning mouths shut. But this is a miracle, isn't it?

--------------------------------------------------

  

A married woman goes missing. The husband makes all efforts to trace her. During the process he and the general public come to know that she got kidnapped. Finally she is traced and rescued. She says that it was not a kidnap. He likes the person who is being identified as the kidnapper.

  

After many such reports, in a similar case, the husband successfully traces his wife. Brings her back home. Guess what are the realistic possibilities of the consequent developments. Whether it is ideal or not, whether a 21st century ideologue of a certain ism likes it or not, the reality is that the husband is either affected by the earlier reports about similar incidents.or if he doesn't care, the society around treats him as a dull-witted person. Only a miracle of the kind mentioned above can save him from the humiliations. There are husbands who don't care for even these humiliations and get along well, perfectly normal as nothing has ever happened, with their wives.

  

Let us now make this husband a leader. As a leader, the amount of public attention is very high.

  

It is a reality of life and the world even during contemporary times that the private life of a leader affects his public life.

  

Ideally the society should admire the leader forgetting along well, perfectly normal as nothing has ever happened, with his wife.

  

But is that the reality?

  

Does the image of a dull witted person augur well for the leader?

  

He can just kick his leadership role for the sake of his love for his wife. As a story of a great lover, such a story can be a big hit.

  

He can give up his wife for avoiding the image of a dull witted leader. Let me tell you, this story is not going to strike a chord with the audience even as a story of a great leader.

  

If at all there is a way in which the leader can avoid the image of a dull witted person while at the same time, not giving up his wife, he is admired as a great leader that can balance the public and private dimensions of his life.

  

That way,if requires a super-natural intervention and the leader takes the help of that by necessitating that through creating one of the pre-conditions for such an intervention in the form of pushing a pativrataa to a corner through pretending to be suspecting her, so that her power of paativratyaa can effect the supernatural intervention, such a sequence of events is acceptable for the readers of an itihaasa. 

  

But that can not be a prototype for a contemporary leader to emulate. The point /feature for a contemporary leader to emulate is not the supernatural aspect. The balance between thepublic and private dimensions of life is the point to be emulated by the contemporary leader. The means to achieve that are expected to be the realistic available ones of the contemporary times.
