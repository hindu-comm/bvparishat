Friends,

Some years ago, I had invited a senior friend of mine in the local Divinity School to speak about his

long years of studies on Vaishnavaism. He started the seminar mentioning about his forty years

association with India through travel and research, though mostly in the south. At the end, he

challenged the audience to tell him about the "Theology" of the "Hindus".. He appeared confused

when I intervened to state that "theology" and "theism" as terms have no place in India's native

evolution of faith. I refrained to engage the audience with his question.

  

Many seemingly bright individuals operate through such assumed mapping developed through

their own upbringing and indoctrination. This is rampant and some are totally confused. It is

possible that there is a subconscious motive of denigration which is a cultural heritage in the west.

The survival is assumed in finding methods to annihilate and not to appreciate. Sometimes, the

methods have been violent.

  

My submission is to "forgive" these "pseudoscholars" who are into social commentaries than

fundamental understanding. We had our India seminar Saturday. What I found that India strove

to understand the universe in its diversity. It is difficult to imagine the possible opulence and satbility

that might be needed to continue the work without interruption.. Indian thought analysis did not become

"inventions", but they became "knowledge". All "inventions" are local, the "knowledge" has

larger space, possibly universal. Hopefully time would come when scientists would probe the

universality of knowledge, than finding engineering solutions. 

  

Best regards,
