Sri Balasubramanian Ramakrishnan-ji,

  

Please excuse me for the delay in my response. I was teaching when yo message arrived. I am just back.

  

Thanks for that message opening your plain heart to us regarding these dilemmas faced by many practising Hindus. It needs a certain amount of boldness to be that humble and confessional. Being plain-hearted gives that boldness.

  

-----

  

Coming to the point,

  

Let us take some contemporary scenarios:

  

Media covers a news that a minister's son who was freed by the terrorists after huge efforts by the minister through security agencies, got convinced by the ideological persuasions of the terrorists during his captivity and has been working for them. The minister knows that this news is wrong. His son neither got influenced by the terrorists nor has been working for them. With the confidence that his son can come out clean, orders for his arrest and orders for investigation by the investigation agencies. But he does not tell his son, wife and other relatives that it was due to his confidence in the son's innocence that he did this.His son, wife and other relatives give public statements that the minister was a bad man because he preferred his political image to that of the son and to the son's safety. Finally the son comes out clean and then the minister says that he always knew his son was innocent but wanted to give the world an acceptable proof of that. The son and the father reunite.
