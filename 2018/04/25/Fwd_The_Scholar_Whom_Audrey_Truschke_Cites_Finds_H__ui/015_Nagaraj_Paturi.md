What I call "double talk" by the present day scholars about the women characters of our ancient Sanskrit narrative poems is this:

  

'pativrataa' has been stereotyped by all these as some docile, submissive, obedient to patriarchy, spineless, life-less woman. Tradition and traditionalists have been blamed for showing such characters as role models for the present day girls/women. The consequence of presenting them as role models has been argued to be making the present day society anti-progressive, reinforcing patriarchy, nurturing women into creatures obedient to men.

  

But the fact is that all the well known pativrataas of the established itihaasas and puraaNas are extremely assertive, bold and vocal women who asserted their self-respect, arguing and debating with their husbands, with frightening gods such as Yama, why, chastising and punishing even the trimurti.

  

When they see these facts of assertiveness , boldness etc. being the common characterestics of pativrataas which have the potential to fail their attempts to stereotyping pativrataas assome docile, submissive, obedient to patriarchy, spineless, life-less women, they use the obfuscation tactics by highlighting the negative features of the males mentioned/indicated by the pativrataa during her confrontation with them.

  

This is what is happening here too. The fact that Sita has been depicted as a bold woman by being shown as reprimanding Rama is being concealed by putting the bad and abusing words of the tweeter against Rama, in the mouth of the pativrataa character.

  

What is being deliberately being hidden by the tweeter and being overlooked by our own friends who pass judgements in the name of some 'flaws' of our own respected characters is that the same episode has Rama's touching expressions of love for Sita.

  

The beauty of narrative literary works lies in the strength in the arguments of the characters of both sides of the argumentative conversations. If the author Valmiki wanted to present a one-sided version from only Rama's perspective, he could have done that. But he did not. If Valimiki wanted, he could have not depicted Sita's response. But he did not. Sita's self-respect ,boldness and dignity are all brought out well by the poet. It is this depiction of a dignified Sita that is being misused by the attention-seeking tweeter who seems to have been struggling for this negative and easy path to attention. Her dissatisfaction with the attention paid to her so far (which itself is highly undue and hyped) seems to be making her use harsher and harsher language until she achieves the degree of uproar she is looking for, from the other side.
