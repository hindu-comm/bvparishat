Well done for signalling virtue. No one is dismissing women's concerns, so nice try.

  

The point is that this thread has given reasons as to why the original criticism is inappropriate. If those answers are ignored, then it is the questioner who is dismissing the answers given.

  

The fact that the questioner chooses to repeat the same question by putting it in someone else's mouth reveals that he has already concluded that the original answer is only refuting the person, not the message.

  

In reply it was said - whoever asks the question, the answer is the same.

  

Regards,

Venkatraghavan
