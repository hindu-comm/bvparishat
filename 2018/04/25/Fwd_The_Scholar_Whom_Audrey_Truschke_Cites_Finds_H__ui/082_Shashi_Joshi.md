I hope everyone realises the motive of such comments, as by Audrey, whether scholarly or not.

  

The aim is this.

  

Imagine someone calls you a bad word, "Hey, You are an XYZ". And you complain. On the street, on tweeter, on SM, on MSM. You go to police. You go to court. Everywhere, in every small and big argument, you will have to keep saying, this person said I am XYZ.

  

The issue was useless, the argument was not important, whether she loses or wins is immaterial.

  

But the ambiance is set, where people, even Hindus are okay saying such things as "It is wrong (or right or maybe) to say Rama was a XYZ"

  

See, their trick is working.

  

People are already using *Rama* as subject, *pig* as object, and *is* as verb, with or without a negation.

  

It is like, let me do a scholarly study of the pH value of certain type hair of Virgin Mary to figure out if that is a truth or a myth.

And in name of scholarship and expression freedom, let me write scholarly papers, crass tweets and blogs, and every time, every other sentence will have the words Mary, hair, the region, findings so far, how scholarly work should be devoid of reverence, and how freedom of expression is being curbed.

  

That is the game.

After so many instances of such scholarly discussions started by western thinkers, we have withing a century reached a stage where it is okay to first throw words at Rama, then, and maybe not even then, try to have a debate, incite anger and upset the status quo, that Hindus feel like first let me win the argument. Then I will show who is smart.

  

Well, in the process, you are made to say 100s of times the words "I am an XYZ" or the equivalent. Three times is a charm, they will make you Prince Charming by having to say it 100s of times!

  

Why did scholars (not aberrational tards), even though devotees, never ever raised a doubt about Rama, called him maryAdA puruShottama instead.

  

  
  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
