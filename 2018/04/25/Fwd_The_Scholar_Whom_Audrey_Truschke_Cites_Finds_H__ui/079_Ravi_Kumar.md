I just want to add few things here -

  

1\. She says, in her article, that the professor himself says elsewhere that Sita basically tells Sri Rama not to behave like a pimp. Implying he's also guilty.

  

2\. She says her objective in sending the tweet was to basically ignite anger and debate about women's rights. In support, she cites Lakshmana's momentary anger against Sri Rama.

  

3\. She says scholars should avoid reverence towards texts while translating/analyzing.

  

Now, I just want to say that -

  

- point 1 is again disingenuousin two ways (one, disregarding the context of Sita's statement and zeroing in on the use of a word (pimp) that is used not as abuse but in the sense of negative illustration, and two, deflecting factual criticism by saying in essencethatother people are also guilty of what she has done, so why single her out). This is not proper scholarly behaviour.

  

- point 2 is subtle moving of goal posts. A defeat is being presented as a victory. If a debate on women's rights is sought, then it should be based on fact and truth, not on distorted readings/translations.

  

- point 3 is only partly true. The real position of a scholar should be one of strict neutrality. If reverence is undesirable, then so is irreverence.
