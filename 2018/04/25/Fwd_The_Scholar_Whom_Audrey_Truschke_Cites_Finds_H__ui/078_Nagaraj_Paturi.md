It is not teaching him. It is 'justifying' him. It is explaining why he said what he said in the email, though he, according to her, holds a different opinion than what he said in the email. If it were not a personal email, he would have said, " divergent interpretations are just a matter of scholarly disagreement . So she is not wrong" is what she is saying. She is confident that if it were not a personal email, her western fraternity would not have betrayed her the way he did in this email.

"why my politically incorrect talk in a global public street like twitter is being condemned by my own western fraternity is ........ "
