Dear Sri Murthy-ji,

  

The question is not whether it suits me or you. You are a very good poet of Sanskrit. I can not meanings of your poem the way it suits me.

  

Different parts of a poem have an organic connect to each other. That help the reader to get to the heart of the poet.

That said, when I read a text like Ramayana, I don't question whether a character can jump across the ocean, whether there are astras (mantra-based weapons) or not, whether a character can take the kidnapped woman travelling in the sky in an 'open air vehicle' etc. Part of all such acceptance of super-human aspects is the acceptance that the hero knew that his heroine can prove her chastity through a super-human method. The writer makes the hero say this after Sita comes out unaffected by the fire. This confidence of the hero in the heroine is what is admired by the listeners/readers of the kaavya. The hero is made to give this reasoning of confidence for 'allowing' the heroine to carry out her decision. Accepting this claim of the hero that he knew what was going to happen and that is why he 'allowed' her is part of accepting many other such super-natural aspects of the epic.
