Regarding the position of women in Ramayana and how can a modern Indian relate to this epic:  
  
1) Sita had a swayamvar. She could \*choose\* whom she wanted to marry.  
2) When Ram questioned her and Sita "passed" whatever "test" one interprets in the epic she is the one who rejects Ram and leaves him. How is this not women empowerment?  
  
Furthermore these two belonged to a group of people who had Sati Pratha and Jauhar Pratha.  
  
Often the Prathas are confused. Even in Sati Pratha if you were to analyse the various Sati Stones scattered all over Rajasthan and other parts of India you will observe Men committing sati for men (usually king) , mothers committing it for their sons and wives for their husbands etc.  
  
So in the case of Ramayan Sita does a metaphoric Sati because from that day on her husband is dead for her.  
  
This is an extremely powerful depiction of women in the epic. Our later interpreters have not done justice to the power of Sita.
