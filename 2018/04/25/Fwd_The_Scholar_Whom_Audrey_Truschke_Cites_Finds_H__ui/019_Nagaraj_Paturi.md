What are the consequences of such misrepresentations? Our next generation is getting affected.

  

See our great scholarly member Prof. Vishal Aggarwal's respinse on another list:

  

I just sent my rebuttal to Audrey as an attachment.

  

You mention Kamban Ramayana. It is a Kavya of medieval times, conforming to contemporary poetical norms of shringaara and so on. In the said Rajaji's translation below, Rama is even depicted as admiring the full breasts of Sita as she roamed in a garden before the Dhanush-bhanga episode. My son was prescribed this particular version in his 'World Literatures' class right here in the US, **and he came back home very anguished, saying, 'Rama was so messed up.'** (Highlighting mine)

  

I promptly showed him Valmiki's version of the same episode which has no such descriptions (although there are other verses in other contexts) and explained to him something about Kaavya norms which totally calmed him down. Then, he went and told his teacher about it, who then actually invited me two days in a row to give a gist of the Ramayana's importance to all the six sections of the 9th grade. In fact, she also prescribed sections of my student's version (that I wrote for our Sunday school) to students in the class thereafter. Here is the link:
