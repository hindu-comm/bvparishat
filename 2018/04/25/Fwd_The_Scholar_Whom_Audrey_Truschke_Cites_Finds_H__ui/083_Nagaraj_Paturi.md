Sri /Smt Shashi-ji,

  

You are perfectly correct.

  

There was a discussion on our own Indian donors donating money to translate our classics including Ramayana to such translators rather than to Indian scholars who are ambidextrous (proficient in source language, Sanskrit and target language, English ) and have the background to capture the kavihridaya better.

The son of the donor not having sufficient understanding about the resources within his own country and as such getting fascinated by the scholarship of the scholars from whom he first heard the material lead to such a disaster of funding.

  

We have such a section of our youngsters too, who,due to lack of proper training at the family level or during their studies in India, are susceptible to such influences. When one of such section is from the family capable of funding, such disasters occur.

  

Such developments embolden the scholars who are culturally insensitive to the language, books and culture of their study.
