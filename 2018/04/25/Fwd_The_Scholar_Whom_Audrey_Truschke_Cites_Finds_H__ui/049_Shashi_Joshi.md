With all due respect to all, may I request all to just read two articles related to this topic. Read the **full** article, don't leave in between, even if you think you know what is coming.

It saddens to see intelligent people discarding all wisdom and descending to the level of Audrey, which Sita warned against, the prAkRita and the vulgar.

  

Where has the **vidvat** gone from the group name?
