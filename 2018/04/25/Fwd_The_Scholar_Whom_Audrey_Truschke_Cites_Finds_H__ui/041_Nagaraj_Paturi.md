Coherent reading of the text demands :

  

connecting the word upēkṣā used in the later part of the text and this verse describing Lakshmana following the expression of Rama.

  

Since there is no word used by the poet describing the intention of Rama as understood by Lakshmana, in that verse, the only way out is to connect it to the word used in the later part.
