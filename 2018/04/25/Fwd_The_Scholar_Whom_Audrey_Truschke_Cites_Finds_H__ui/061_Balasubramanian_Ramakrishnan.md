Mercifully I am not at a stage where I have to signal virtue in a largely unknown group of people. This is a real issue actual people face. As a matter of fact my older daughter has the same reaction to this story. Now you can call everyone who diasgrees with you an idiot or virtue signaling or whatever random Sanskrit verses you can come up with or actually try to understand the issue. How is the Ramayana a timeless masterpiece and how can certain things in it be interpreted or maybe even reinterpreted? I haven’t seen any satisfactory answer so far.
