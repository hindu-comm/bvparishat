Prof. Goldman's translation:

  

1.  *‘‘How can you, heroic prince, speak to me with such cutting and
    improper words, painful to the ears, as some vulgar man might speak
    to his vulgar wife?* 2.  *‘‘I am not as you think of me, great-armed prince. You must believe
    in me, for I swear to you by my own virtue.* 3.  *‘‘You harbor suspicion against all women because of the conduct of
    the vulgar ones. If you really knew me, you would abandon your
    suspicion.*
