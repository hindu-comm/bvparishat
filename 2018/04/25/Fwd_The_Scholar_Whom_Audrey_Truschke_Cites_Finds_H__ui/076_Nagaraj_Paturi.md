Namaste Prof. Paturi,

  

I am a modern, independent, 21st century woman who deeply enjoys Sanskrit literature. I am forwarding here an article I wrote for OpIndia that was published only today, although it was submitted several days ago. I was gratified to see that Sri Nityananda (and Dr. Rajaraman whom he quoted) echoed much the same sentiments in his Swarajya article, showing that appreciation of great poetry cuts across gender and ideology. Of course, the examples you cited of the women from your fieldwork studies also make a similar point.

  

Regards,

Priya
