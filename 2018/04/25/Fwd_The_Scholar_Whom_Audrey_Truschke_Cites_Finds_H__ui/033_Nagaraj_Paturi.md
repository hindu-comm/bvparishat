I am just back in front of the system after returning from my teaching work.

Let us get back to track.

  

Does smelling coffee mean making Sita into a rabid feminist to call Sri Rama " a misogynist pig " ?

  

The whole discussion of the thread is centred around that.

  

Making Sita speak the slang of a certain brand/strand of feminism can not be acceptable to even the 20th century or the 21st century feminists because as per their view feminism is purely a modern or post-modern ideology and an ancient Sanskrit epic or its women characters can not have such 'progressive' ideas and as such can not be given the exclusive privilege of using the feminist expressions. 

  

Not knowing this fact about the 20th century or the 21st century feminists is a kind of not smelling the coffee or may be cappuccino.
