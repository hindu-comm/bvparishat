Dear Prof. Paturi.

  

Thank you for your email. I can't speak for Shri Srinivas for sure. But I think the first explanation you cite below is what I feel and which Shri Srinivas feels as well. Personally I think I can give convincing explanations about kanyA-dAna etc., we need not interpret women as property in the mantra-prashna verses, without denying that they may have been at some point by some people. The mantra-prashna verses are much deeper than that. After all it is "giving away the bride" in Western culture as well. Back to the Ramayana: When my older one questioned me about this, I frankly admitted to her that I don't have any explanation which has even convinced myself, but that should not detract us from the Rama's greatness, divinity, etc. While I have received some traditional training in various Hindu/Vedic related subjects at a young age, I am also a product of the scientific way of thinking. While I have a deep abiding interest in Sanskrit and some expertise on some restricted topics, my day job is not Sanskrit and there is the inherent tension in trying to impart to the youngsters our traditional wisdom. I believe this is one of those.

  

I think we all probably agree that Prof Truschke went overboard and was wrong in her interpretation, but this is a connected if somewhat tangential issue if you will.

  

Ramakrishnan
