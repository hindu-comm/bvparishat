Thanks Prof. Kannan, for your kind words of solidarity.

  

My main aim is to counter the misinformation reaching the lay people and younger generation.

  

In this internet generation, it is easy to spread the misinformation, though it was not any less in

the older times.

  

Once, a modern woman was offended when I wholeheartedly praised her as pativrataa for her

perseverance in her family management. I had to explain to her that I was praising

her boldness in facing the difficulties etc. and that I was not looking at her as a docile

slave of her husband.

  

----------------------------------------------

  

One good question is, do we have a word similar to pativrataa to refer to a husband of the same kind?

  

My answer is, yes and the word , I would say, is 'patneevrata'.

  

We know the word ekapatneevrata so popularly used in reference to Sri Rama only, whom these ignoramuses try to malign.

  

If you remove 'eka' from it, you get the word patneevrata.

  

We can show numerous characters from our epic narrative poems, itihaasas and puraaNas who are eligible to be called as patneevratas.

  

Ruru from the Aadiparva of Mahaabhaarata is an example.

  

Such stories should get highlighted.
