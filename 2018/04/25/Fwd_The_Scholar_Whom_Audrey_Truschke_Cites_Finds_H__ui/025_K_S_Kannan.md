"*samyañcaḥ sa-vrataubhūtvā*" says a *mantra*.

  

*anuvrata/anuvratā* are routinely used to describe the husband/wife in the epics (Nala/Damayanti, Rama/Sita etc.).

*(*and *vratam iti karma-n*āma** - says Yaska.)

Thus there is mutual concord between the husband and the wife

(and also between what you have written and what I have).

  

(Sorry diacritics incomplete.

My computer has some problems.

Needs too much of effort to do diacritics).
