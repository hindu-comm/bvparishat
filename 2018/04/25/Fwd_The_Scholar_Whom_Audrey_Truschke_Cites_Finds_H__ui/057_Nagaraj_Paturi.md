>Now dont come back asking which edition, which text etc etc. "It's not there in my edition"  

  

\> Hindu women when they criticize agnipreeksha do not cite chapter and verse of critical edition or some other edition.  

  

Come on Srinivas-ji! what else would a forum of scholars ask for if not for such evidences for the claim of the claimant? When the person asked
for such evidences is a lay man/woman , the intention is to enlighten them about the misgiving on the basis of which they are resorting to those criticisms.

  

\> Agnipreeksha means the one Sita was asked to undergo, for god's sake.

  

\> Everybody understands Sita is meant.  

  

--- I do not know (I guess no one knows ) any event of Ramayana , actual happening or poetic creation other than what is found in the text of Valmiki's Ramayana. Agnipreeksha , the one Sita was asked to undergo, for god's sake is not there in Valmiki's Ramayana, hence it is not, for god's sake, there in the actual happening or the poetic creation called Ramayana is the point. If it is an actual happening, details of which are wrongly reported by Valmiki, I can only verify using a time machine which is unfortunately not available as on date. If it is a poetic creation , I have to go by what the poet has created. Hence
'Agnipreeksha , the one Sita was asked to undergo ' is a non-fact either way.

\> What about practising Hindus especially Hindu women who criticize agnipreeksha?

  

\> but what about our own Hindu sisters and mothers who criticize the same thing, not perhaps in the same language but criticize nevertheless?  

  

------- Those 'practising' Hindus especially Hindu women who criticise Agnipareeksha are only a small percentage of the entire Hindus especially of Hindu women. If they are 'practising' Hindus , it has to be seen what sort of Hinduism is being practised by them. Are they people worshipping Sri Rama as a deity in the temple and criticising Agnipareekshaa ? If yes, the reasons for such an inconsistency and contradiction in their behaviour can be best explained by them or they are in search of a resolution of this cognitive dissonance in them.

  

Are they people worshipping all other deities of Hinduism except Sri Rama on account of their antagonism towards Sri Rama based on 'Agnipareekshaa' ?

  

They seem to be practising a consistent version among innumerable versions of Hinduism.

  

Are they practising a version of Hinduism that is anti-Sri Rama for some reason such as being anti-Vishnu ? That is possible.

  

But in any case, they are not the all of the practising Hindus.

  

As a fieldwork-based researcher of Indian culture, let me tell you that the biggest percentage of practising Hindus do not hold such views.

Let me narrate one of many of my interesting experiences while working on the popular understandings and folk /popular versions of the classical narratives such as Ramayana. (I studied these for decades as folk-classical interface was one of my major specialities during my Cultural Studies career.):

  

There was a Mumbai-based Indian film maker who got a contract from one of the BBC channels to make a film on Ramlila, popular versions of Ramayana etc. I don't know if that was the mandate to him from the channel or that was his own idea, the man wanted to document folk Ramayanas in which Rama is abused. I don't know whether the professor knew this idea of the film maker, but an American Indologist guided the person to us. He approached us for help in locating folk narrative art performers and folk singers particularly women performing Ramayana narrative and /or singing Ramayana based songs. He said that a Telugu speaking Indologist's article informs him that Telugu folk narratives of Ramayana had that feature.

  

He goes to the women performers and the women audience around them and asks them , \[with the help of Telugu knowing dubasis (translators )\],
whether they were angry with Rama or whether their narrative or non-narrative song had expressions of anger against Rama. He was disappointed that none of the scores that we randomly took him to, had such features or said anything that he wanted. In a tribal women circular dance singing of Lava-Kusa story (they call it 'baalasanturaamaayaNam') , he heard the wailing voices of the singers. he asked us what it was. We said, they were lamenting the fate of Sita abandoned in the forests. The man asked them (with the help of translation) if they were abusing Rama. Bang came the yelling from the singers! " Are you a fool? You seem to be educated but don't understand the pathos of Rama in doing this!" and so on. In no time, we were surrounded by the men of the tribal hamlet with weapons in their hands." How dare you criticise our prabhu Rama? Who is that? Who is that?" roared the tribal chief. With a great difficulty we could avoid an untoward incident by persuading the tribals.

  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

  

The range of knowledge levels and attitudes of 21st century men and/or women with regard to Ramayana may vary from zero to a fine scholarship or from rabid hatred to blind devotion. We can not generalise and say this is the 21st century way of looking at Ramayana.

  

If there is a lack of knowledge or proper knowledge of these things found among people, those knowledgeable try to educate them.

  

There are a huge number of fine young men and women of the 21st century who have a great understanding of Sanskrit and/or our ancient texts such as Ramayana, many of them working in IT and other fields, many of them settled abroad. They are trying to educate other Hindus of their generation sharing their hard-earned erudition.

  

We are able to smell the great fragrance of this 21st century promise for the future!
