I had once questioned about Yuddha Kanda Agni Pariksha part on this platform/forum. Where i got my answer after reading various Tikas.  
That Ram is himself accepting that he is blind and Sita is pure as a Deepak. She has also understood his narrative.  
But this is the divine leela of both. Agni Pariksha if not done, how would real Sitaji return to Ram? As it was Vedavati/Maya Sita who Ravan placed on his lap.

Unless we become united, or make our scriptures more approachable to the mass, I don't think these allegations will stop. Today Hindu women question norms of periods, and Agni Pariksha etc by being exposed to the wrong people to hear or read.

After Valmiki Ramayan, Tulsidas Ramcharitmanas proved beneficial for the common folk who didn't know Sanskrit. And Kamba Ramayan in Dravid States.  
But today, as we know is the age of technology. We have the entire text available online, but without any glamour.  
We need some glamour to it.

We need a celebrity face to do that. We have one, Devadatt, but he is all absurd with his made up theories.

We need a glamourous personality who represents entire Dharma and is also very learned.

Yadyad aacharati shreshtah lokas tad anuvartate.

People have been interested in this for long time. But they choose to read Devadatt and he is definitely not a right choice. The reason his books are best sellers is because people are really intrested. If we make someone a celebrity, who is learned and young, the youth can get attracted to him and read his books. It should seem more modern, hep and trendsetting.

Is it possible?
