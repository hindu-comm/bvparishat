Namaste Sir

  

There is too much anger on this issue though we have many poets in this forum knowing Sukshma poetical matters.

  

We all can make peace with Audrey Trushke like this. In poetry there is one type known as Nindaa Stuti. It looks like Nindaa but it is actually praising the Hero.

  

Audrey Trushke thinks Seeta said Rama is Misogynist Pig. This looks like Nindaa of Sri Raama. But we can analyse it like this.

  

Misogynist means woman hater. What is womanhood in Sanskrit? Streetva is one word but another is Abalaatva. Abalaatva means property of weakness. Therefore Raama is hating weakness in Himself. Like Krishna disliked Karpanya Dosha in Arjuna on battlefield.

  

Raama dislikes cowardice and weakness. Next word Audrey Trushke used against Raama is pig. But this is easy. Vishnu has a Pig or Boar Avataara known as Varaaha. Nothing wrong in calling Him as Varaaha.

  

Therefore according to Audrey Trushke Sri Raama is Weakness Hating Varaaha Murthy only. Seeta is addressing Him as Vishnu only. We can be at peace with Audrey Trushke.
