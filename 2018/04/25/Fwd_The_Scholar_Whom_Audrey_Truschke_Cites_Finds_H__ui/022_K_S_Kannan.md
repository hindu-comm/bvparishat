Equally commendable are the efforts of Vishal Aggarwal

in opening our eyes to the kind of books and the impact on the younger generation

outside India.

  

I guess somebody must do a PhD on the caricature/misrepresentation of
Hindu ideas and ideals

in our books - in poems, plays, novels etc., and more importantly in our films and TV Serials.

Quite often, it is the stereotype of the "religious" Hindu who is portrayed as a criminal/malevolent,

and a Christian or a Muslim as benevolent.

  

"Crime and terrorism have no religion",

but it is typically the Hindu who is a negative character in our movies,

even if police records show the opposite wrt terrorists/underworld goons.
