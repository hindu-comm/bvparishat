\> Sir, modern Hindu woman will not walk 3 steps behind her man and would not do agni pariksha or any other pariksha if her faith is questioned. In fact she would consider it barbaric. Are you or other Sanskrit scholars going to throw some moth eaten shastra at her?

  

This shows that you have not followed the thread, leave alone Valmiki Ramayana which you obviously did not read since you are talking of Agnipareekshaa which is bot there in it.

  

Sita did consider Sri Rama's suspecting her to be 'barabaric' if prākrita is translated that way. Me or any other person did not throw any śāstra at her. On the other hand, we applauded her. We applauded for presenting Sita as such a person of self-respect, dignity not mincing words in expressing that self-respect and dignity.

  

Please read the post:

Some times not only palm leaves that have been treasuring s'āstras for us, even our own coffee ideas and words can get moth eaten if we don't update ourselves at least by reading the thread on hand closely.
