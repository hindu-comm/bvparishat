Dear Sri G S S Murty-ji,

  

\> should not become a forum for advocating Hindu fundamentalism.

  

Where in this thread did you find any features of 'Hindu Fundamentalism'?

  

The thread initiating post informed about a translator of Ramayana who was quoted by a tweeter said that he was shocked by the tweeter's "inappropriate" words and "vulgar" words. He said that his translation did not support such use words. He was not in support of such words.

  

Do you consider Pro. Robert Goldman who expressed these views a Hindu Fundamentalist?

  

Prof. Kannan brought his response to the notice of the forum? Do you consider that to be Hindu Fundamentalism?

  

I, while providing the background to Prof. Goldman's response, listed the piece of information that Hindus were trying to seek her apology. Is providing such news as a background Hindu Fundamentalism?

  

I, in the true scholarly tradition provided the original text for the forum members to see for themselves. Is such a providing of the original text Hindu Fundamentalism?

  

I said the same thing as Prof. Goldman when I said she was attributing her own words to Sita-ji. Is such an academic analysis Hindu Fundamentalism?

  

Where did you find Hindu Fundamentalism?

  

This is not the first time you come up with this kind of misplaced 'holier than thou' statements and advise the forum.

  

Let me repeat what I mentioned earlier in a similar context. Whether one likes it or not ancient Sanskrit texts have content involving what through British labelled nomenclature is being called as 'Hinduism'. A discussion on Milton's Paaradise Lost invariably brings in Christianity into discussion. To be hypersensitive about that is the fundamentalism of an imagined neutral academic discussion.

  

You used the word paaraayaNam. That is a religious word. paaraayaNam needs an understanding from the perspective of following the reason in the text from the point of view of puNya , poojyataa etc. Imposition of an imagined 'no-religious' understanding does not suit paaraayaNa. These two claims are mutually contradicting. But that is about your claim of paaraayaNA.

  

But your 'holier than thou' advices to the forums are unwarranted is the point.
