The messages below seem to be mutual correspondence between Sri Venkataraghavan S -ji and Sri Balasubrahmanian Ramakrishnan-ji.

  

If they are not, let me say that no words such as idiot or any impolite addressing has been used by me.

  

No Sanskrit verses quoted by us so far are random.

  

\> How is the Ramayana a timeless masterpiece and how can certain things in it be interpreted or maybe even reinterpreted?

  

Whose claim in the thread was ' the Ramayana is a timeless masterpiece and certain things in it can be interpreted or maybe even reinterpreted ' ? If there is any claim to that effect by anyone in the thread, you may wait for a SATISFACTORY ANSWER from that person.

  

If that is your question, you may start a new thread, raising that question.

  

The topic in the present thread is, Audrey-ji's mistranslation and claims by some respondents to the first thread that even practising Hindus particularly women criticise Rama for putting Sita to Agnipareekshaa. How about them?

  

That has been answered.
