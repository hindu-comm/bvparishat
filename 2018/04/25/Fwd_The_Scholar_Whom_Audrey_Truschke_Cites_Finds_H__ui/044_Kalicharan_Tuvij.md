In the past I had discussed on this forum the parimAna rule which says:  
One word of Veda = One sentence of Upanishads = One upAkhyAna of Purana.

So it is pointless to analyse Ramayana (having upakhyana level parimana) word by word.

If upakhyana is respected, we find that Sita, not Rama, is the most powerful character in Ramayana. Rama is merely obeying her wishes; Sita remains in the driver's seat. Sita IS in a position to call Rama names.
