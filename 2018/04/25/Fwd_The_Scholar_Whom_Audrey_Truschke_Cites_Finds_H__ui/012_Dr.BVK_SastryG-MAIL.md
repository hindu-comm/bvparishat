Namaste



Bringing focus to the specific lines in Robert Goldman’s response and seeking clarification from ‘ indigenous scholars’ :



***Questions: ***



A) What is this work **\<** **When she refers to the "critical edition” she is referring to the Sanskrit text of the Ramayana as reconstructed by the scholars at the Oriental Institute of Baroda** \> ?



 How much of the ‘supposed original text’ is chopped off in the ‘ **Scientifically Reconstruction / Critical Edition’** ?



 Are we not having more challenges with pre-independence works of similar effort with Mahabharata Critical edition, which not only edited, but also reconstructed the text and brought down the size of ‘Mahabharata’ by almost 40%; A similar effort on Vedas has already
caused several ‘ reading doubts’ on ‘ what might have been the ‘ original as it was / it might have been in the hoary past , some millennia ago’ ! It is a continuing saga of colonial meddling with sacred texts, tolerated ( nay supported) by indigenous scholars and national institutions.



 The information for Oriental Institute of Baroda, a post independence India effort on the lines of Critical Edition of Mahabharata ( Pre-independence period) is available at the link
<http://international-msubaroda.org/images/Oriental%20Institute.pdf> .
The page reads :



**The Critical Editions Section : This Section is engaged in preparing Critical Editions of Purana-texts**.



1. **During 1951 to 1975**, A Critical Edition of the great epic-Valmiki- Ramayana was prepared and published in seven voluminously books, incorporating seven Kandas namely: Bala, Ayodhya, Aranya, Kishkindha, Sundara, Yuddha and Uttara,with the help of more than **25 assistants, working for 25 years, and with the financial assistance from U.G.C.** The Bare Text containing only the constituted text of the Valmiki-Ramayana is also separately published in one book. The Pada-Index of the Valmiki-Ramayana is published in three different volumes.



 Please connect this with the following reading from <http://southasia.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/shared/documents/Ramayana.pdf>
:

**The Vālmīki Rāmāyaņa Translation Project was started at Berkeley in the mid-1970s** and is being carried out by an international consortium of Sanskrit scholars under the direction of Professors Robert and Sally Goldman. The Project has as its goal the production of a complete, accurate, and readable English translation of the critical edition of the monumental epic poem. **The critical edition, prepared over a period of fifteen years by scholars at the Oriental Institute of Baroda,** **represents a scientifically reconstructed text of the great epic based on dozens of manuscripts in various scripts and from many regions of the Indian subcontinent**. It has thus been a major contribution to scholarship in all fields concerned with early Indian literature, art, religion, and society.





B) The part of the tweet \< During the golden deer incident, Sita accuses Lakshmana of lusting after her and setting up Rama."\> is
textually supported portion of Ramayana – Aranya kanda - sarga 241
– slokas 21 onwards as below: ( Image Text from <https://archive.org/stream/ValmikiRamayana/Aranyakanda_III#page/n197/mode/2up> . Interpretations from the context, cultural understandings and social media sensitivities do differ. The ‘ sanctity’ associated with
‘ monogamy- one wife for one life ( ekaa bhaaryaa) , as a cultural ideal’ may not gel across other global cultures, where ‘ Women Freedom and choice for marriage -divorce’ is a constitutional right and individual freedom. If ‘ raajaano bahu vallabhaah’ was accepted, and society reduced ‘raajaa to become prajaa’, the new reading would be ‘ prajaah bahu vallabhaah’. Is it not a reality in several nations and communities ? In most traditional circles and commentaries, the harsh words of Sita to Lakshmana is explained as ‘ bhaagavata- aparaadha ( not only Lakshmana , but also to Bharata) ’ ; thus this becomes a cause for Sitas suffering. Now, with this, Do we want to hold to the character of ‘Sita with human emotions which fill the poetic grandeur of Ramayana kaavya’ or ‘ whitewashed ideal of Goddess Sita’ – is surely a social media topic of choice for debate.
