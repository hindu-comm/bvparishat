Personally I dont find anything untoward in what Sri GSS Murthy has said. He has commented as a practising Hindu.

  

This forum gives the impression of being full of males who think Sanskrit alone is the fount of all wisdom. That may serve a political agenda but no devout Hindu would ever subscribe to this notion. Nor would the other half of the Hindu community i.e., women.  

  

As a practical example, let me share with you what happens in Hindu weddings here in the US. As the ceremony goes on, some busybody - a so called local scholar the type who tilts at western perceptions of Hinduism - translates the mantras in a form of running commentary. Most of the times, this worthy would translate the kanyadaana mantra too. At least on two occasions last fall that I happened to witness, the bride herself loudly objected to being 'given away' to the groom. Everytime this happens, the bride's parents as well as the groom's parents feel like someone threw cowdung in their faces. People who follow the contretemps look puzzled and frankly, confused. On another occasion, the pundit had been requested during the rehearsal by the girl and her brother to come with revised mantra replacing the 'giving away' motif with the 'accepting' motif. The pundit as well as the local scholar did not know enough Sanskrit to conjugate a couple verbs with the result that there was a holdup in the ritual. In all these cases the brides were practising Hindus.

  

I'd be careful not to give too much leeway to these scholars to interpret Hinduism for me. As a practitioner, I reserve the right to interpret Hinduism for myself. If I dont have that right, I'd have to just follow the Vedas which I dont understand and find everything else repugnant, unduly revisionist and unauthoritative. So then the next logical step would be to destroy all the temples and burn all the books of enlightenment from the medieval era which inform our worship today.  

  

I'm clear that some people - I see them in the US - are making a career out of combating the ills of Pollockism etc. But they do not help Hindus to renew their understanding of their faith and their scripture in the changing times and environment in which Hindus find themselves. Even a couple generations back, the scholars who interpreted Hinduism knew our scripture as well as their re-imagining over the centuries by poets in our languages. In contrast, the scholars we have now and are rather voluble, know only Sanskrit, much English and even more science and technology.

  

Is Hinduism to be left to the sweet mercies of this lot?
