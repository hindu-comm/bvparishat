Oh my god! There is a lot happening in here and I hit a jackpot of discussions from the feminist perspectives. What more lucky can I be?

  

Now coming to the point, A bit of background about me - Formerly active at large on a beautiful website called Quora. I was born in 1992 to Andhra family not devoted to lord Vishnu.

1.  Iam therefore, humbly submitting myself as just a beginner who is
    learning into the deeper waters of the great culture called
    Hinduism. I might be wrong and therefore am eternally grateful to be
    part of this group for its forgiving nature.
2.  Vishnava tradition is predominantly north and did have its strong
    influence in South India as well, but dravidian culture thrived and
    sustained in its own sweet way.
3.  As per my limited knowledge, many Andhra theatre artists, scholars,
    philosophers, novelists and movie directors from as early as 14th
    century to 18th century and present day and age criticised Ramayana
    and Mahabharata for the factual sexism present. Southern recensions
    and commentaries have pointed out and modified the stories to fit
    into the perspectives of feminism. I agree, even Andhra or any other
    southern state is not devoid of such mistreatment throughout the
    history.
4.  Ishita Roy, **using the platform Quora** wrote several answers
    perfectly deconstructing the critical editions and its sanskrit
    accurately of both the epics and several other treatises in Shakta,
    Vaishnava and Saivism.
5.  ShodGanga, an Indian repository of Indian thesis submitted from all
    universities and freely accessible had many thesis which say the
    exact same thing. 6.  Wendy Doniger is wrong sometime and right at other times.

Lets leave reunion or Lord Rama and Maata Sita and the purity fire test aside , here are other evidences -
