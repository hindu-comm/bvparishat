Sir,

  

That list of 21st century may nots need not be taken literally. It was just intended to communicate that a 21st century woman would behave differently from the way Sita is depicted by Valimiki to behave is not a right/forceful argument to defend Raamanindaa.

  

The method used in listing the21st century may nots is *reductio ad absurdum*. As such, what it means is that just as it is absurd to protest behalf of sons, younger brothers etc., on the basis that the way the son and younger brother characters are depicted in a way different than they would behave today, it is absurd to protest in behalf of wives on the basis that a wife today would behave differently.

  

--------

  

At the same time, to generalise that all wives, sons and younger brothers of the 21st century behave in a certain way is also not correct. The intention behind the use of 'may/may not' was that only.
