Dear Sri L Srinivas  
  
There is nothing wrong with constructive criticism of Rama or any other aspect of any religion. Whether one is from the east or the west, one is free to criticize constructively. In the particular case of Rama, Prof Paturiji has already provided the answer in this thread, that is present in the Ramayana itself. Rama knew Sita was pure, but the ordeal by fire was necessary so that the world also knows this fact.  
  
But Audrey's criticism is not constructive. That is one of the first points that atleast I noticed, right from the first post itself.
