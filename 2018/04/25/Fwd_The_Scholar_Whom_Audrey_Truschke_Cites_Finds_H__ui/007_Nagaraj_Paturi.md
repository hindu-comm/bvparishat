Can an Avataara do this to the other Avataara?

  

Sri Rama's response:

  

आत्मानं मानुषं मन्ये रामं दशरथात्मजम् \|\| ६-११७-११  
सोऽहं यस्य यतश्चाहं भगवंस्तद्ब्रवीतु मे \|

*11. manye*= I think;*aatmaanam*= of myself;*maanuSham*= to be a human being;*raamam*= called Rama;*dasharathaatmajam*= the son of Dasaratha;*bhagavaan*= you; as a gracious Divinity;*braviitu*= tell;*me*= me;*tat*= that;*saH aham yasya*= which I as such really am;*aham yashcha*= and why I am like this.

"I think of myself to be a human being, by name Rama, the son of Dasaratha. You, as a gracious Divinity, tell me that which I as such really am like this."
