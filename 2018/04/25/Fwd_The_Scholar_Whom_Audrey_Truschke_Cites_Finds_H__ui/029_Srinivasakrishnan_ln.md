Prof Paturi,

  

That was a very strenuous, if somewhat strained, response.

  

One specific point I had intended to make was that any response to the ills of classic colonialist and neo colonialist constructs of Hinduism has to be better than harking back to some Gupta period Sanskritic orthodoxy. Clearly these responders and their world view, have to wake up and smell the coffee i.e., emerge into the 21st century. A lead in this respect has already been provided by various poets and social reformers over the centuries which is steadfastly ignored by these faux and real pundits because of their obsession with Indology and other preoccupations.

  

Hope this helps,
