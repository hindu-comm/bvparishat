Where is Agnipareekshaa in Valmiki's Ramayana?

  

Agnipariksha , fire ordeal of Sita, is not there in Valmiki. Sita enters fire, Rama does not ask her to do that. Sita doing that is a great expression of " you tell me that I am free to seek shelter anywhere I like. If it is not you, this is the only go I have."

  

Where is the aspect of Agni being arranged by Rama as a test here ?

  

Even Sita does not say, " I will prove my fidelity /chastity by entering fire. "

  

It is the drama of the events there from the point of view of the poem. It is an extreme expression of single minded love by a lover as much as it is an expression of self-respect and dignity characteristic of all the pativrataa characters of all itihasas and puranas.
