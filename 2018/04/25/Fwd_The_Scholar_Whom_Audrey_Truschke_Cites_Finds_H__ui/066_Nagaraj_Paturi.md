Just now it occurred to me that " you are missing the point" probably has a point.

  

May be the founts, coffees, smellings, moths etc. have been coming in the way of understanding the view of Sri L Srinivas-ji and his supported and his supporters.

  

Probably, their point is this.

  

"We are practising Hindus. The women we are mentioning are also practising Hindus.

  

So we have a respect for Sri Rama. We are unhappy that in popular understanding, irrespective of what the original text of Valmiki has to say, Sri Rama put Sita to Agni Pariksha.

This is very much against the contemporary expectations from a good husband.

  

We want to get out of the cognitive dissonance we and the women mentioned by us are facing /experiencing in us because of the contradiction between our respect for Sri Rama and this popularly established version of the event in Ramayana.

  

Please help us resolve this contradiction and resultant cognitive dissonance by helping us understand the popularly established version in a way that convinces the 21st century sensibilities of us and the same of the women that we are talking about."

  

Am I right in understanding them?

  

or

  

Are they saying

  

" It is your responsibility to solve this for us and the women, so we demand you to do that because as defenders of Sri Rama and critiques of likes of Audrey-ji , it is due from you to us and the world"

  

or Are they saying ,

  

"Since you are trying to defend the indefensible, please stop doing that. Ramayana can not be defended in the 21st century. its an obsolete book. leave it amd don't get unnecessarily upset when Audrey-jis are we criticise for its inherent flaws, particularly the flaws of Rama." ?
