Namaste Sastry Ji,

  

I think the second shloka reads as:

अहल्या द्रौपदी **सीता** तारा मन्दोदरी तथा \| पञ्च कन्याः स्मरेत् नित्यं महापातक नाशनम् \|\|  

I recite this version. In which case, 4 out of 5 illustrious women are from Valmiki Ramayana.

Please forgive if there are mistakes.

  

  

  

Best Regards,  

Raghavender
