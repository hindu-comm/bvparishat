Good for you.

Again, careless extension and superimposition from available evidence. Why don't you let facts fit theories instead of theories fitting facts.

The duties of a king and the duties of a husband will at times, be in conflict. This is a situation that exemplifies such circumstances. The choices that people make in this situation reveal their character. In this instance, he believed that it was appropriate to prove beyond doubt the character of a woman who was going to rule Ayodhya alongside him. This he did at great personal cost, risking his relationship with his beloved wife, to attain whom, he had literally moved mountains. It is an interesting counterpoint in a society where everyone is looking out for his / her personal gain, irrespective of the demands of their roles in public office.Rama made his choice. You are free to disagree with that choice.

  

However, the problem is people are retro-fitting their current views of patriarchy and superimposing misogyny into the choices made by a character in the past, when there is no evidence in the text of this.

Venkatraghavan
