Namaste,

  

I vaguely remember Mahamahopadhyaya Pullela Sriramachandrudu Garu compiling 1000 names of rAmachandra that occurs in shrImad rAmAyaNa.
Does anybody possess that book.

  

@ Aravinda Rao Garu : Pls let me know it's whereabouts. Has Sanskrit Academy, Hyd published this.

  

rgs,

sriram
