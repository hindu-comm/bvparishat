Dear scholars

  

Can anybody tell more about where these carved sculptures (with one head, two hands, and five bodies) are located and what they represent?

  

They might be Jain motifs. As per [this tweet](https://twitter.com/saileshvora55/status/793055805100609536), the second one is located at the central dome of a Jain temple in Jaisalmer. Are there any Jain texts which describe somebody with five bodies, two hands, and one head? Or do they represent some Jain principle?

  

I must add the art is simply breathtaking.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
