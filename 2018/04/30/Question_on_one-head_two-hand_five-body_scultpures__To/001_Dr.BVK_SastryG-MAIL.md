Namaste Nityanand ji



1. The art work is marvelous.

2. This type of artwork representing multiple expressions and positions is common in many Hoysala architecture.

3. In this specific case, Try this experiment and observe the images. They are one person in five different positions ! sculpted and presented in media from different persoectives.



- Open the image in an application like Paint.

- Use the ‘ Rotate’ ( Ctrl+R) and turn the image by 90degrees. You can see the same head attached to different body and different posture.

- Repeat the same and you will find five different expressions
by the time you completed the full 360 degree turn.
