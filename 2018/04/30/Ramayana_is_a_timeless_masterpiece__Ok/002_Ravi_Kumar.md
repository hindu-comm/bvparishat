I just want to point out that, in the larger context of the Ramayana controversy and women's rights, the ancient world and the modern world are divided on the issue of women's chastity as the central issue - primarily who is responsible for a woman's being and remaining chaste.

  

The old view is that chastity is a very important matter, that a woman's chastity has bigger implications (ref Arjuna's linking of woman's sexual behaviour and the breaking down of family units and varnashramas and society itself, in the Bhagavad Gita), and thereforewomen's chastity has to be maintained at all costs. The male is responsible for controlling the female's sexual behaviour. By "losing" her chastity, a woman is deemed to be defiled and impure. Thus loss of chastity is a big negative mark against a woman.

  

The modern view is that chastity is no big deal, that women's chastity is not a point of importance for anyone except herself (and only if she wants it to be so), that a woman is independent and can exercise her free will and do what she wants, including sleeping with whomosoever she wants, and that her sexual behaviour is her personal matter and that no one can dictate her sexual options.

  

The current problem with Ramayana and modern women is based on this difference of views.
