Namaste,

  

There are aspects nurturing human relations and aspects related to vaidhika-dharma in VR which most of us know. However, this incident is an eye-opener for many. I have witness many couple travelling together and the husband miss certain aspects during the travel at times while escorting his wife / alighting / boarding a train, 4-wheeler etc.

  

An eye-witness incident from a vaishnava scholar who narrated personally to me regarding how to take care / escort one's better-half while travelling.

  

This vaishnava scholar had boarded a train for certain destination and was sitting comfortably in a coach. The train was about to depart and the green signal was accorded by the guard. Suddenly, he sees a couple who came almost running to board the train. As they got late, both were tensed lest the train would depart. In a hurry, the husband boarded first and the wife latter. This is being observed by the scholar and the couple occupied the opposite seats.

  

After settling down, this scholar introduced himself to the couple and gave an example of how to take care of one's wife while travelling / boarding vehicles etc and gave the following example of how rAmachandra used to treat His dharmapatni while boarding the chariot.

तम् रथम् सूर्य सम्काशम् सीता हृष्टेन चेतसा \|

आरुरोह वर आरोहा कृत्वा अलम्कारम् आत्मनः \|\| २-४०-१३

  

Having adorned herself, Seetha mounted the chariot with a delighted mind,

  

तथैव आयुध जातानि भ्रातृभ्याम् कवचानि च \|

रथ उपस्थे प्रतिन्यस्य सचर्म कठिनम् च तत् \|\| २-४०-१४

  

Thereafter, Rama and Lakshmana the brothers quickly mounted that chariot, which was replendent like fire

and decked with gold.

  

/////////////////////////

  

The above stands testimony to the fact that how caressing was rAmachandra towards His wife and ensured Her safety first

while travelling and respected the cultural ethos of "ladies first" which He Himself demonstrated while alighting the

chariot.

  

Saying so, chided the young couple saying that had they read the rAmAyaNa, they would not have

behaved like this with husband alighting first and wife latter. What if the train gains momentum and

speed and poor wife is left alone on the platform !

  

This small incident opened the eyes of the young couple and became devotees of rAmachandra later.

  

rgs,

sriram
