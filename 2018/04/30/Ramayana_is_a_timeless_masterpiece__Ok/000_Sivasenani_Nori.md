I am starting a new thread, in response to the question of Sri Balasubramanian Ramakrishnan as to how Ramayana can be a timeless masterpiece. His question can be interpreted in two ways. The first interpretation is: how it is possible that Ramayana can be a timeless masterpiece, when there are so many things in Ramayana which are not valid today. A second interpretation is: I know Ramayana is a timeless masterpiece / I wish I can show Ramayana to be a timeless masterpiece, but how do I establish that? The answer to the objections raised in the first interpretation will provide the methodology desired in the second interpretation. So, with either interpretation, the discussion is valid.  
  

Coming to the res, Ramayana will be seen to be the timeless masterpiece that it is, if one approaches the text in an appropriate manner. One has to read with the author, and desist from reading "against the text". If the latter method is adapted, no text will ever be a timeless masterpiece; extending it further and generalising, nothing will be a masterpiece of any sort. That is the general problem with theories and approaches which are "decentered" and which do not have a thesis. It is like holding a conversation with a person, who insists that "good" is 'evil'; "bad" is 'divine' and so on. Yes, the specifics of a situation might not obtain in all times, but the core message - रामवत् वर्तितव्यम्, न रावणवत् - stands true. Rest of the details are valid to the extent they support the core; beyond that, they are not to be taken literally. This is the Alaankaarika and Mimaamsaa approach. One example of the insight that results from such an approach is seen in campooraamaayaNa of Bhoja:  
  

When Rama first meets Kaikeyi after knowing the boons she asked for, he addresses her thus:

वनभुवि तनुमात्रत्राणमाज्ञापितं मे सकलभुवनभरः स्थापितो वत्समूर्ध्नि।

तदिह सुकरतायामावयोस्तर्कितायां मयि पतति गरीयानम्ब ते पक्षपातः ॥2.25॥

Only the protection of my body in the forest was ordered for me, but on the head of the dear lad (Bharata) the burden of protection of the entire world has been  placed. If we look at the tasks allocated to the two of us, O Mother, you have unduly favoured me.

From any other character, this would be seen as sarcasm, but from Srirama it is seen as merely a true understanding of what kingdom means for a Kshatriya: for a Kshatriya, kingdom is a responsibility, not something that is to be enjoyed. Bhoja, a king himself, truly understandे the Rama of Valmiki.
