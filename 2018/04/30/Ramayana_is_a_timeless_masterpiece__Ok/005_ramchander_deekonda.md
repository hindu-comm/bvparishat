Respected Scholars,

  

I am also an ardent lover of *Valmiki Ramayana.* I find several great standards of ideal behavior that are applicable to all societies for all the time to come. One such instance that is similar to the one discussed here is the etiquette of a refined married woman in introducing herself to others. In *Sundaraka Kanda* we get this perfect chaste pattern of introduction, where *Sita* introduces herself to *Hanuman.*

  

*pRthivyAm rAjasimhAnAm mukhyasya viditAtmanah*

*snuSa dasarathasyAham zatrusainyapraNAzinah*

*  
*

*duhitA janaksyAham vaidehasya mahAtmanah*

*sIteti nAmnA coktAham bhAryA rAmasya dhImatah*

*  
*

The order in which the statement goes is adorable and stands as a timeless tesimony for any daughter-in-law. The weightage of respect accorded to the given relationships is something to be cherished.

  

One full *sloka* is utilized for the introduction of her father-in-law *Dasaratha*, with the most appropriate adjectives. Father-in-law is the most important personality in the order of importance and adoration.
Father comes only next to the father of a married woman. *Janaka*, thus gets half of a *sloka* with a suitable adjective. Then comes her own identity with quarter of the *sloka* with no qualifications or attributes. That is humility. *Sita* introduces Rama last with just a quarter of the verse with just one suitable adjective.

  

I thinks these two verses of Valmiki provide us an elite etiquette for all our women to emulate.

  

Sincerely,

  

Ramchander Deekonda
