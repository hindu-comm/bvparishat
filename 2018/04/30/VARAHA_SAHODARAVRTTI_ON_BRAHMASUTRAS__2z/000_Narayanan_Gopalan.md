**Dear Friends and scholars**

**  
**

Recently, while reading about the commentaries of Brahmasutras I found a reference about **varahasahodaravrtti**. the original source of this reference is the introduction of **Dr S Radhakrishnan** to his translation of Brahmasutras,**( Brahma Sutra, The Philosophy of Spiritual Life, p.26)**. Many scholars **repeated** the finding of Radhakrishnan. But **neither Radhakrishnan** **nor the subsequent scholars** who quoted him have disclosed the source of this vital information. The Advaita **'guru parampara sloka**' or the bibliographies of Advaita texts (**That of Pattabhrama Sastri and Tangaswam**i) did not refer to this **Brahmasutra Vrtti by 'VARAHASAHODARA**'. If anybody knows about it please share

.
