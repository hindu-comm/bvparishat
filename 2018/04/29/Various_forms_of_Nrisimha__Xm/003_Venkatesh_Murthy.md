Namaste

  

Fantastic chanting of Nrusimha Maha Mantra -

  

<https://youtu.be/afKsWzjh2Ak>

  

This Narasimha mantra is also known as Narsimha Anushtup Mantra because it is in Anushtup Chandas.  

  

This Maha Mantra is explained in the Narasimha Tapaniya Upanishad -

My salutations to That Nrusimha,   
Who is fierce,   
Who is heroic,   
Who is Maha Vishnu,   
Who is burning,   
Who has faces every where,   
Who is half Lion and half Man,   
Who is fearful,   
Who is safe,   
Who is death and deathlessness.
