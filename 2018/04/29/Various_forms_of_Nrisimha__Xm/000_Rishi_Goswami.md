Haraye Namah

Today is Pavan Parva Nrisimha Jayanti. Greetings and Salutations to everyone.

There are various stories and forms about the Nrisimha Avatar of Hari.  
Some of which are mentioned in Various Puranas.  
Apart from that, the forms such Ugra-Nrisimha, PrahlAda-varada Nrisimha, Nrisimha in Ahobila, VarAha-Nrisimha of SimhAchala, and others are mentioned in various pAncharAtra texts if I'm not mistaken.

Can you help me understand about various Nrisimha forms with all references from PAncharAtra texts?

I have read about a form of Nrisimha blessing PrahlAda in Harivarsha, and due to his tears a river flows in Harivarsha, where if one bathes and offers Tarpana to Pitars, his generations will get Moksha. Nrisimha offers boon to PrahlAda in Harivarsha. This is from the Garga Samhita.

From PAncharAtra, I have read only Shandilya Samhita. I'm not sure if Garga Samhita is a PAncharAtra text.  
Thankyou  
Regards.  
Rishi.
