Dear Colleagues,

  

  This morning I came across this book, where the author's name is given as प्रबोधानन्दसरस्वतिपाद, where the word "sarasvati" occurs with a short "i". This "sarasvatī", as well as "Bhāratī" is added in the title of many Sannyasins. Sometimes I see the titles with a long "ī", and here is an instance of a short "i". I am wondering as to what is the common practice and the grammar of that practice, especially since normally feminine expressions are being used in male titles. Any suggestions?
