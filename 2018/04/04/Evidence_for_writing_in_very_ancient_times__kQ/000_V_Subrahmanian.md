Here is a short video, in English, that someone shared. It talks of a 28000 plus years old image of 'Shiva' (but looks like that of Vishnu from the descriptions) and a 'manuscript.' This latter 'document' could be evidence, if the whole story is really true, for the existence of the practice of writing in a very distant past period.
