Even in Tamil it is a long vowel in Ve:nka*t*a na:than but a short vowel in Venka*t*e:san.  
  

This is not always the case. Even in modern Tamil you can see the variant with the long 'e'. For example, check the song 'kuRai onRum illai', a song on Lord Venkateswara penned by Rajaji himself. In the second stanza or so, you have this line 'vENDiyatai tantiDa vEnkatEcan ninRirukka' i.e., when Venkatesa is there to grant your wishes. No one would pronounce the 'Venkatesan' here with a short 'e'. It would affect prAsam. The singer won't sing it that way either.

Many Tamils named Venkatesan write their names in Tamil with the long 'e'. A google search would reveal this. But it is true that the version with the short 'e' is more numerous.  
  
Bear in mind however that even in modern Tamil, writing the place name 'Venkatam' i.e., Tirumala, with a short 'e' is a spelling mistake. You must use the long 'e'.  
  
Hope this helps,
