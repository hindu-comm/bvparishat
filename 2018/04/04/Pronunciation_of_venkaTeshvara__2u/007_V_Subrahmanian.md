The name 'Ranganatha' could be, I think, traced to the Valmiki Ramayanam as it is believed that this was the family deity of the Ikshvakus. And the deity in Srirangam is actually the gift of this deity to Vibhishana (by Rama) who happened to install it in this Southern town on his way back to Lanka. I think there was a discussion on this topic in BVP long ago.
