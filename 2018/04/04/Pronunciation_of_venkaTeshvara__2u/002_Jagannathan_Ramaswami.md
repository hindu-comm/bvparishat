I think it is a matter of vowel shortening due to the phonetic context. This could be a universal phenomenon. You need more efforts to pronounce a long vowel in the beginning of the word Venkatesa because of the following long vowel. Even in Tamil it is a long vowel in Ve:nka*t*a na:than but a short vowel in Venka*t*e:san. It is also possible that as a means of disambiguation some languages adopt the alternate spelling of Vyanka*t*esa.
