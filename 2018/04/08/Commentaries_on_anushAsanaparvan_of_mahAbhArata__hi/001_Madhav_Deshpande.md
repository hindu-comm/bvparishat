Please use the link given below to download three pdfs. Two of these are Udyogaparvan and Virāṭaparvan with multiple commentaries edited by Pandit Bakre, and the third is the Sabhāparvan with the commentary Lakṣālaṃkāra. The link will remain alive for a week. I would like to know if other Parvans are available with commentaries other than that of Nīlakaṇṭha.
