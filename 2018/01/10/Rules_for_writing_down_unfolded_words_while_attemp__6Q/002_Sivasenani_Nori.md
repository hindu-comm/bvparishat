The short answer is that the latter form is the preferred one.

  

Here are the whys and wherefores. What you called "unfolding" of the verse is called पदच्छेदः - splitting of words. The idea is to show the words separately. So, the unfolded verse should be technically written as:

  

धृत्वा। पदस्खलनभीतिवशात्। करम्। मे। ...

  

At this stage, we have the list of words. The next stage is anvaya - rearranging the words in such an order that it makes sense. Here for the sake of conveying the meaning (it must be remembered that sentence is the primary unit of meaning), a sentence form is adopted. What you have presented is the sentence form. That is why Sri H. N. Bhat said that ending in makaara or anusvaara is optional.

  

The Sutra at work is मोऽनुस्वारः । ८.३.२३॥ The import of this Sutra is that when a makaara at the end of a word is followed by a consonant (hal), then anusvaara replaces the makaara. Thus करम् + मे = करं मे।

  

Then, why did Sri Bhat say it is optional? Sandhi happens only when there is acute proximity between adjacent sounds. If the intent of the speaker is to halt at a particular point, obviously there is no saMhitaa (proximity) and so sandhi does not happen. To understand this, try saying "cupboard" quickly as a single word without a pause and the two words "cup" and "board" separately\* - you will notice the difference in how "cup" is pronounced.

  

So, that would make the first form presented by you also right, would it not? Technically, yes. More precisely, it depends on what the author intends the anvaya with separated words (the unfolded verse, as you put it) to be: if it is a list of words in a particular order, padAnta makaara has to be there; if it is the verse re-arranged as a sentence, padAnta makaara might be used or not.

  

However since the intent is to show words clearly, it is more useful to the reader if the same style as the padapaaTha of Veda is followed. In the padapaaTha, it is explicitly recognized that each word is separately spelt. Thus, the padapaaTha of the first Rk of Rigveda would be:

  

अग्निम्। ईडे। पुरोऽहितम्। ...

  

While showing anvaya, the danDas (equivalents of English full stops) are dropped, sometimes being replaced by commas. I hope this makes the preference for the latter form clear.

\* Strictly speaking "cup-board" is a samasta-pada and sandhi is nitya in that case, but I was just trying to demonstrated the working of sandhi.
