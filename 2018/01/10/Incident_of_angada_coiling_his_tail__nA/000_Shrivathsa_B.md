hariH OM,

  

 Will some vidvaan shine light on the following-

  

 In Ramanand Sagar's televised rAmAyaNa, there is an episode where angada is shown to be raising himself over his own coiled tail because of he having been denied a seat. You can see the relevant part from time 22.30 in this video -

I got some links to icons depicting hanumaan seated on his coiled tail (don't know if westerners mixed up angada with hanumaan).

  

1\. There is no such ullekha in vAlmiikirAmAyaNam or tulasiirAmAyaNam. In which grantha is such a picturization found?

2\. The song that runs in the background doesn't seem to be from tulasiirAmAyaNam. (Daar liyo nija puuMcha ko aasana). It may also be interesting to know as to where the song is from. I found the lyrics here -

(pl search for "asabhya").  

  

svasti,

   bhavaaniibhaaratii jayatetamaam,

                          shrivathsa.
