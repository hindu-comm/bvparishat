Namaste

  

Is there any collection of Mangalarati mantras? Some of the mantras used in the tradition are:

  

somo vaa etasya...

  

hiranyapaatram madhoh.....

  

saangrahanyenaayajate....

  

raajaadhiraajaaya prasahya.....

  

  

I am looking for a collection of these and any other mantras in one document. Any help is appreciated.

  

Thanks and warm regards
