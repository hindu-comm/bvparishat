Shankaraji,

  

When we look upon the entire universe of prakrithi (made of three gunas) as the body of Brahman (similar to human body) then jiva/jada entities corresponding to the head, arms, thighs and feet, form the four varna. So the entire three worlds could be divided into four varna. It is not limited to only humans.

  

This view of looking upon the universe as the body of Brahman (VirAt purusha) explains the formation of four varnas out of three gunas of prakrithi.

  

Namaste

Suresh
