Namaste Shankarji,

  

According to your table the 5th one is similar to 1st Varna only the secondary and third combination is changed, and the 6th is similar to 4th Varna only the secondary and third combination is changed. Hence there is no necessary for additional type of Varna.

According to you

1\. Please define what is Varna and Guna ?

2\. Kindly let me know the stand point of you to the Varna or Guna ?
