Murthyji,

  

Brahmana has Sattva as primary guna and Tamas as tertiary guna and so on in other varnas too. So, we find that Sattva and Tamas exist in all 4 varnas in varying degrees.

  

My question is why Tamas can't be secondary guna, when Sattva in predominant? Similary why can't Sattva be secondary, when Tamas is predominant?  

  

regards  
shankara
