Dear Dr BVK Sastry-ji,

  

I am just back to the system after a pitr kaarya.

  

Your present post as difficult to comprehend for me as all your past posts have been.

  

What is your problem with my moderating role when I saw a venerable senior scholar expressing his feelings through statements through very strong words such as

  

"कुतः अप्रासङ्गिकं विशिष्टाद्वैते द्वेषस्य (स्वस्य तद्दर्शनाज्ञानस्य च) प्रदर्शनंमुहुर्महुः

वेदेषु अवैदिकमूलक-क्षुद्रवाक्य-महावाक्य-भेदकल्पकैः मृषावादिभिः कथानधीकारकथाविषयैः

  

स्वमताविष्करणे अन्यमतेषु निर्मूलदोषापादनं न शोभते प्रामाणिकानाम् । वेदमिथ्यावादिनां तु श्रुतिविरोधे का हानिः इति न जाने ।"

  

in response to the following words of another venerable senior scholar:

  

"There are भेदाभेदौ in विशिष्टाद्वैतम् and it is not acceptable due to श्रुतिविरोध"

  

What would / should any moderator do when discussions go into such direction? What else is the duty of a moderator if not to moderate when moderation is needed?

  

Why does a due role played appear to you to be

  

"Patch up and reconciliation as ‘ Agree to disagree’ model may be ‘ politically right strategy before lunch break’ " ?  

  

Why do you think

  

"but this is pushing the key issue below the carpet" ?

  

Did I not say ,

  

"If they consider that there is a scope for a healthy debate / discussion between two or three different schools of Vedanta on a specific contentious issue between them is possible, they may start a separate systematic debate/discussion on that issue and participate in the debate /discussion in the manner that helps the younger scholars to learn both the method and the content." ?

  

Where is pushing anything under the carpet here?
