Haraye namah.  
Vidvadbhyo namah.  
  
According to Shankaracharyaji's Bhashya on Shlok, I've come to a conclusion.  
There are 3 Gunas and even if we take Pradhan and Upasarjan per Varna there are 9 probabilities.  
Gunas = S R T.  
On combination,. S S. S R. S T.  
. R R. R S. R T.  
T T. T S. T R.  
Out of which the first three automatically get eliminated. The rest are to be taken. Still, the no remains 6 with us. (Capital for Pradhan and Small for Upasarjan.)  
  
ब्रा : S r (सत्वप्रधानस्य ब्राह्मणस्य)  
क्ष : R s (सत्वोपसर्जन-रजःप्रधानस्य क्षत्रियस्य)  
वै : R t (तमउपसर्जन-रजःप्रधानस्य वैश्यस्य)  
शू : T r (रजउपसर्जन-तमःप्रधानस्य शूद्रस्य)  
The two which remain are S t and T s. That means, Sri Shankaracharyaji's intention was to omit the two. As there is no prapti of it. Satva and Tamas cannot go along together.  
Satva can't be Pradhan(Primary) when Tamas is Upasarjan(Secondary), and Tamas can't be Pradhan when Satva is Upasarjan. While Shankaracharyaji has not mentioned tertiary, it can be adhyahrit.  
  
The last mentioned 5th and 6th options had Rajas as Gauna(tertiary) and Satva and Tamas as Pradhan and Upasarjan contrary to each other, which is not ishta to Sri Shankaracharyaji.  
  
Satva and Tamas are opposites. Or Viruddha. One can't have 2 viruddha dharma having ashraya in same dharmi. Eg, hotness and coolness in same dharmi together.  
  
This was previously mentioned by schollars and I just think this is the only explanation possible. Or if we have examples of people having Satva as Pradhan and Tamas as Upasarjan, or vice versa, by examining the qualities in a person, then only we can say that there ahould be 6 Varnas. I don't think it is possible for a person to be polite and arrogant at the same time, angry and calm etc. Do we find examples of such people in Puranas by inspection of qualities?  
  
Please forgive me if I'm wrong somewhere. I'm a mere student and this was just what my baal-buddhi has grasped. I am grateful to all schollars who have answered before and I just wanted to share what I have understood.  
  
Thankyou very much.  
Regards.  
Rishi.
