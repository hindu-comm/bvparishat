Dear Dr Sastry-ji,

  

It is your irrelevant or out of context expressions such as

  

"I hope that ‘ Vidvat –parishat’ deliberations are not ‘ discourses of public-pleasantries’ ."

  

which cause unnecessary digressions from the focus of discussion. There is no context for kribbing about public pleasantries here. Yes, as civilisedin the modern parlance and s'ishTas in the traditional parlance, of course, we try to address each other in mutually respectful manner. In reality those aspects of etiquette and manners get relegated into insignificance and given routines, significance remaining with the focus of discussion.

  

----------

  

Allegation of 'pushing Varna discussion under carpet ' would have been valid if I closed the thread. I did not. So no context for those words.

  

--------------------------

  

Since the moderating words were addressed to the venerable senior scholars, 'they' due to the force of context, refers only to them. Request to them was to start a separate thread since the issues need not necessarily be related to the present thread.

  

--------------------------

  

Sri Shankara-ji , later in the thread clarified that the question came from a rationalist. The topic is not the entire huge broad issue of Varna system . It is the specific question of 'why not more Varnas than four that can result from the other permutations of three gunas?'

  

The question is addressed by many different posts in the thread.

  

The thread is not closed yet.

  

If there are more points to be made related to that question, they are going to be made.

  

Everything outside, on the carpet.

  

Please do contribute to the discussion focusingon the specific issue.
