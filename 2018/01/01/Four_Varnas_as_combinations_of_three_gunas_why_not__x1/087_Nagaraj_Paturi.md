Is it anachronistic to use the word caste while referring to what is described in this part of the sukta?

  

To use the word varNa as per your analysis is just time mismatch. To use the word caste is not just a time misfit, it is a language misfit, social system misfit and cultural misfit, isn't it, professor?
