Shri Nagaraj Paturi ji,

  

Here is my thought process:

  

If Brahman as the universal Self is accepted to be the origin of all name-forms, then it follows that everything in the world is vedic :)

  

So as Hindus we should not have any problem in looking upon every particular entity/element in nature as a devata and the entire universe as a manifestation of the supreme Brahman / Purusha. Infact all the 33 alphabets/aksharas in Sanskrit stand for a devata and the primordial sound OM that includes and transcends all aksharas stand for the Supreme Brahman.

  

But due to ignorance some may not understand and recognize this basic spiritual unity/origin and such people and their culture / constricted views,

is naturallyin conflict with the vedic all encompassing view. Such people are referred to as danavas (non-vedic) as opposed to devatas, in the Veda.

  

From this point I see the four Varna as a broad division/branch corresponding to the face and limbs of the universal purusha manifesting as the universe and also as the society and within that it is possible to have multiple smaller branches of castes/groups as subsets due to difference in vocation.

  

Actually castes are nothing but extended family and every caste has its own language/culture/food/vocation/flavor that helps to sustain diversity in a natural manner. So castes are not bad at all and even Swami Vivekananda has written in favor of caste and says that the ideal of Hindu religion is to make every a brahmana - knower of brahman! So what is bad is the inter caste rivalry and the false notion of superior/inferior castes and that needs to be eradicated and not the caste itself which helps to sustain diversity.

  

The entire society is like a human body and varnas correspond to the four major parts and castes are like different organs/tissues/cells. They all need to recognize the importance of each other and work in unison.
