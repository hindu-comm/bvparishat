नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Dear Prof Nagarajgaru

  

you stated that I said the following --

  

There are भेदाभेदौ in विशिष्टाद्वैतम् and it is not acceptable due to श्रुतिविरोध ।

  

I would have appreciated had you enquired with me as to what is the source of this sentence --

  

this is not at all said by me - it is there in the popular work **सर्वदर्शनसंग्रह - पूर्णप्रज्ञदर्शनम्** authored 400-500 years ago--

  

तदेतत् रामानुजमतं .....साम्ये’पि **परस्परविरुद्धभेदादिपक्षत्रयकक्षीकारेण क्षपणकपक्षनिक्षिप्तमिति उपेक्षमाणः ’ स आत्मा तत्त्वमसि ’ (छा**

**6-8-7) इत्यादिवेदान्तवाक्यजातस्य** भङ्ग्यन्तरेण अर्थान्तरपरत्वमुपपाद्य ब्रह्ममीमांसाविवरणव्याजेन आनन्दतीर्थः प्रस्थानान्तरमास्थिषत ।

  

In fact such introductory sentences are there in the beginning of every दर्शनम् । Scholars are familiar with the work.

  

We do not provide reference to popular concepts that are being discussed for hundreds of years in famous works.

  

We do not express our personal likes and dislikes but while discussing as issue we quote from 14/18 विद्यास्थानs ,

  

This is the सम्प्रदाय followed in great works like महाभाष्यम् , वाक्यपदीयम् etc.-- एके अपरे परे and so on . So no cause

for ill-feeling .

  

Please note one or two points --

  

द्वेषः कस्यचन कश्चन यदि अपराध्यति तदैव जायेत । यदि अन्यथा जायते तर्हि स आधिरेव।

  

Here we never tried or try to propagate or condemn any दर्शनम् । We may take up a concept for the sake of discussion - simply to

decide the वाक्यार्थ or शास्त्रार्थ ।

  

Prof BVK Sastry got the point .

  

One may differ by providing some प्रमाणम् ।

  

If someone doubts the intention of another what to do .

  

Earlier we have discussed चार्वाकदर्शनम् , where श्रुति quoted and said they too have वैरभक्ति ।

  

भेदाभेदौ एकनिष्ठौ - are there in ज्योतिषम् , व्याकरणम् , गान्धर्ववेद etc . But what I provided is an उपलक्षणम् ।

  

I do not cross my limits in terms of language -- अतिवादान् तितिक्षेत ।

  

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

  

There was a प्रसङ्ग of this aspect by Vidvan Rishi Goswami on 3/1/2018 ----

  

\>Satva and Tamas are opposites. Or Viruddha. One can't have 2 viruddha dharma having ashraya in same dharmi. Eg, hotness and coolness in same dharmi together. \<

  

To clarify the position I was quoting different sources .

  

Even in behavior itself this is seen - in व्यवहार जगत् is सत्यम् but in सिद्धान्त जगत् is मिथ्या ।

  

I / we are not here to finalize any सिद्धान्त nor can we - everybody follows his own path . Let us limit to academic discussion..

  

धन्यो’स्मि
