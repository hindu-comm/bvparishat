As we read the Vedas, the "varna" terminology was a part of the social structure.

Everyone was called a vish, possibly a nomad or a trader. Why the word "vish"

is a good question. In chronology, the kshatriyas came next and then the bhrahmanas.

The kshatriya protected the land and brahmanas protected the kshatriyas through books.

The workers were called shUdras, again a good linguistic question.

  

What the Gita is doing is to characterize these existing social order into a theory

of guNa from Sankhya. As I would understand, it is more of an explanation than

helping to create a new order.

  

Chanakya, much later, reinforced the chAturvarNya classification and created an

administrative principle assuming the classification. He was clear-eyed to check that

no group was degraded or disrespected. It involved remuneration and punishment.

By instituting the administrative principle, apparently he succeeded in creating

economic prosperity for the country unmatched any time later.

  

The question can be if such a process is really empirical for whatever reason.

  

Best regards,

Happy New Year.
