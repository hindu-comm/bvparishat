The question 'Why not 6 Varnas' implies that Varnas were created out of permutations of three gunas in three slots: primary, secondary, tertiary; Among 6 possibilities listed in the table, 4 have been used in creating the 4 varnas. two possibilities in the table are left unused. Why are they left unused?

  

The answer is:

  

Varnas were not created through such process. So the question does not fit here.

  

Varnas are being explained through whichever text is the source of the table.

  

Unless that text says that Varnas were created out of permutations of three gunas in three slots: primary, secondary, tertiary, the question is irrelevant.
