Dear Scholars,

  

1\) Is the social organization and social hierarchy in the animal kingdom not as natural as the individuality of each individual in the group? 

  

2\) Can any one level in the hierarchy be made the cause of the place/level of another group? 

  

3\) Is the group not in as much a naturally evolved organism as much as the individual in the group?

  

4\) Can any one part of our body exist independently of the other parts of the body.

  

In the light of the above is it not necessary to view social stratification as natural and in the least man made?

  

What the scriptures do is just describe it.

  

It is the same as grammarians say that the job of grammarians is just to describe that which is in vogue at a particular time in history.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
