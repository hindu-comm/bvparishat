Namaste

  

The local expert Sri Pavagada Prakash Rao once said Siva is naturally Sattvika because He is in deep meditation mostly. But His actions are Tamasika because He gives boons to even Asuras without hesitation looking at Tapas. He gave boon to Bhasmasura and when he tried to burn Siva then Vishnu rescued Him. Vishnu is naturally Tamasika because He is in sleep mostly. But His actions are Sattvika. They are according to Dharma and for protecting the good.
