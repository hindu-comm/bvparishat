Dear Paturiji,

  

Do Varna and jati not have different connotations? In my opinion caste refers to Jati and not to Varna. 

  

Secondly scripturally has the concept of Varna and Guna evolved simultaneously? In other words is there any reference in the scriptures that the Varna system was an offshoot of the concept of Guna. Or still further was the Varna system in operation during Vedic times.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
