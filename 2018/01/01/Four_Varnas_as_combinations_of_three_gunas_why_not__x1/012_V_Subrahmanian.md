Could it be that all types of humans are covered in the 4 combinations mentioned and perhaps there will be no one within the varna-dharma corpus who could be in the 5th and 6th combinations. I would hazard a guess that rakshasas, asuras....could be in the 'omitted' combination. Maybe we will get some examples in the Puranic, etc. stories for such individuals. For example, Ravana was a born Brahmin and even a knower of the Veda. But his intent and action did not correspond to his birth and knowledge.
