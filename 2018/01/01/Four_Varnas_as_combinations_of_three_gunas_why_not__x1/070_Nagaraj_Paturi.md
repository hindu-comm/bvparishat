Dear Sri Achyut-ji,

  

Are you keeping the reality around us today or the actual cases described in ancient Sanskrit /Vedic narratives in mind?

  

Whatever kind of 'real' cases you are keeping in mind, the present discussion in the thread is on the ideal type discussed in the ancient shaastra texts not either on the actual reality around us today or the actual characters in the ancient Sanskrit narratives.

  

The actual reality around us is caste not Varna.

  

The characters in the ancient Sanskrit narratives are around the ideal type called Varna found in the ancient Sanskrit Shaastras.
