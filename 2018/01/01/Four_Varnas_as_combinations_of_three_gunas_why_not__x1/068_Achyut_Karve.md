Dear Scholars,

  

If I am not wrong Varna refers to division of labour in a society or a particular organisation of labour in a society in historical time.
However Guna refers to the qualities that individuals posess. A Shudra can be as much satvik as much as a Brahman can be tamasic. 

  

I have still not been in a position to understand how the two i.e. Varna and guna have been philosophically or sociologically reconciled in this thread.

  

This is necessary before one dwells on the issue. Just quoting from ancient texts and that too without putting them in context not only affects the debate but many a times may do disservice to the person or authority who is being quoted.

  

If this is not attempted posts will merely carry mechanistic approaches which will inturn trivialise the subject under debate.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
