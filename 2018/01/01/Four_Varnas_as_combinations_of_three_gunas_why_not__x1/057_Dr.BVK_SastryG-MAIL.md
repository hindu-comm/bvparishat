Namaste



Patch up and reconciliation as ‘ Agree to disagree’ model may be ‘ politically right strategy before lunch break’; but this is pushing the key issue below the carpet. ‘ Adarshanam- alikhitam’ never triggers a ‘ retaliatory post’ .



1. The thread and discussion seems to have taken an off track route from where it started; and has landed in a ‘ bad patch pushing personal perceptions of interpreting and siding Acharya Darshanas ’.
Professor Korada has stated a personal preference only after quoting several views of different traditional schools, which present ‘Varna’ explanation as a Cosmic order; and not as a ‘Social structure’ . I do not see any animosity or hatred or disrespect for any other Acharya sampradaya in this post. Things would have taken a different turn if quotes had come from rest of the shaastra – sampradayas for adjudicating the hierarchical superiority relation of Devatas and Varna- Jati’s. For this purpose, Dharma Shaastras, Puranas and Artha Shaastra are the disciplines to get in to. **But the thread started asking ‘ Scriptures position on Varna’**.



 Even otherwise, All three Acharyas commenting on the ‘ Apaurusheya Veda’ do not seem to be intent on stepping over the toes of ‘Social structure of society’, which is the domain of ‘Dharma Shaastra and Artha Shaastra’. If ‘Acharyas differ in their ‘ domain of explaining the transcendent ( Ateendriya – Viswa janeena – Sarva purusha – Saarva yuga – sarva kaaleena)’ , why should it disturb the peace of ‘Social historical understanding of the text’ and ‘ post India secular society’, where ‘ Dharma – Varna- Jaati –Acharya Sampradaya practice’ is a ‘ personal privacy, and Constitutionally guarded Fundamental right’ ?!




 

2**. I place below the wavy and wavering nature of the debate gone through this post**, which has left the primary issue unanswered and has landed itself to unwarranted, unwanted, undesirable comments. 

 The basic questions raised have remained not addressed, either adequately or holistically in the ‘ Traditional perspective’ or Social structure perspective or ‘ Linguistic perspective’ to defend the continuing 

 practices and pride of inheritance !



 ***The basic questions embedded in the ‘ starting point of the thread’ being***: ( I leave the trail mail below as it is for readers easy referencing).



 2.A. (A-1) ‘ How to understand a given ‘traditional, social, historical track of ‘ Four Varnas’ (A-2) in relation to ‘ Shaastra technicality of Guna-Karma- Swabhava’ from anchor document of Gita, a Language document in : Bhashaa –Samskrutham, which ( A-3) draws on the a priori axiomatic concept of ‘ Guna’ from ( A-4) Vedic Documents in Language: Chnadas –Samskrutham ?



 2. B. What is (B-1 the ‘Nature of Vedic Word and (B-2) Historicity and ( B-3) Pedagogic tools to understand and track the ‘Social Structure vis-à-vis Spiritual Transcendental structure’ used by ‘Hindu Society for justifying its Social organization with a ‘Hierarchical Superiority of Brahmana’ ? or ‘ Social filtering and limited access/ denial of access to ‘Transcendental Sacred Documents’?



 2. C. In the Post Independent sovereign Nation status of ‘ India / Hindu-stan’ that was once ‘ Akhanda -Bharath and Mahabharath’, what should be the relational status between ‘ WE governed by the Constitution’ and ‘ WE /I bound by the traditional diktat’ ? During colonial rule, the same issue was used for framing ‘Governance rules’ using the thought process: ‘ Rule the Colony by their own books of law and religion’ and figure out the ways to ‘ enrich the empire’.



***Overview of the wavy and wavering nature of the debate how posts on this debate have shifted track****: *



2.1) Starting question: (Shankara) : Seeking clarity on Bhagavadgita and Scriptures ‘Four Varnas’ based on ‘Three Gunas’ and pointing to ‘ **no varna’** tag .

2.2) Breaking point : ( BM) : As we read the Vedas, the "**varna" terminology was a part of the social structure**. **Everyone was called a vish, possibly a nomad or a trader**.

2.3) Track Shift : ( Paturi) : Debate on root ‘ Vish’- विश- is the root.

2.4) Debate Shift- Track Shift Combined : (BM): Discussion on Vedic Word **\< In the Vedic composition, it is most likely a word borrowed from some of the local languages. It is a good question to think if we havethe words first or we have the roots first! And then how old is a word?**\>

2.5) Track Shifted issue contested : (BVK) Nature of Vedic Word ( and Historicity) to track the ‘Social Structure vis-à-vis Spiritual Transcendental structure , the starting point of thread, noted at (2.1)

2.6) Sideline Note to the discussion: ( MD) Guna relation For a given God linked to murthi embodiment, quality, Hierarchial superiority of gods linked to Purana

2.7) Track shift on Nature and authenticity of ‘ Purana-evidence’ : Purana Authorship and relative authority gradation of Purana - upapurana ? \< ParAshara purANa same as "Vishnu PurANa" ? who wrote "sUta gIta"?
>



2.8) Restoring the thread back to the starting point of ‘Varna’ ab initio: ( Korada) : Quotes from Upanishat and supplementation from commentaries and a position statement.



2.9) Personal position statement critiqued : (RP) - \< कुतः अप्रासङ्गिकं विशिष्टाद्वैते द्वेषस्य>



2.10) **Moderator steps in for reconciliation**: \< this is not a forum only of a particular school of Vedanta \>
