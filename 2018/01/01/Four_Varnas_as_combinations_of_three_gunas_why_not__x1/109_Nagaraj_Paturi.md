\>Regarding Caste and Varna, is it possible that Sanskrit Texts which only speak of 4 varNas were really simplifying and made 4 broad divisions, herding a large number of castes into these 4 divisions?

  

  

---- No. Absolutely no.

  

Caste is clearly a different entity than Varna.

  

Castes are hundreds if not thousands in number. Features of these castes are such that to fit them into the features of four different Varnas is impossible.

  

1. Vedic Vais'ya has agriculture and trade together as occupation. There is no caste with this combination. There are several different trading castes and several different agricultural castes different from these trading castes. Among several different trading castes only one in each region took /is given the Vedic name Vaisya. For emphasis of the Vedic nature of the name, the word Arya is added in front to make it Arya Vais'ya. This community has upanayana in contrast to the other trading communities. Agricultural castes are big in number and their population is also huge, majority in India. Since they do not have upanayana, they too do not take /not given the Vedic name Vais'ya.

  

2. Actual rulers in India come from different castes and tribes. Most of them do not have a Kshatriya tag before turning into rulers. Once they became rulers, a kind of quasi-Kshatriya status was accorded to them. Several castes claim Kshatriyahood with names such as Agnikula / Vahnikula Kshatriya. These claims do not even have a connection with ruling or martial occupations. 'Are Katika' , the meat cutting caste, Darjee, the tailoring caste and many other such castes claimAgnikula / Vahnikula Kshatriya status. Certain castes claim Surya Vams'a and Chandra Vams'a Kashatriya staus and have name endings such as Varma.

  

3. Several castes have priestly sub-castes which officiate non-Vedic folk rituals in the households of the respective castes. But they are not called Brahmins. Once SC ST reservations came into existence, certain families in Andhra-Orissa borders with certain surnames who had been considered to be Brahmins started claiming /revealing that they were actually tribal people, their relatives on the Orissa side are enjoying the ST status and the reservation benefits resulting from it, as such, they should be accorded ST status on Andhra sidealso. The case seems to be pending with commissions and courts.

  

4. Most of the 'castes', naturally because caste is a non-Vedic system, do not have upanayana or yajnopaveeta dhaaraNa. On that basis Brahmins , 'Arya Vais'yas' and 'Kshatriyas' consider people of all these castes as S'udras. 'Service' / Seva to 'dvijas' is not the way the people of these castes look at their own caste occupations. Calling different castes as S'udras on the basis of 'no yajnopaveeta' and then using the Vedic description of S'udra as 'service to dvijas' to describe the caste occupations of these castes puzzles the people of these castes because that is not the way they look at their own caste occupations.

  

The problem at the root of all this is to miss the point that 'Hinduism' is a cultural composite formed out of partial syncretism of Vedic and folk cultures, having Vedic influenced folk , folk influenced Vedic and Vedic-folk fusion as its components. Caste is a folk aspect and Varna is a Vedic one.
