Sureshji,

  

To be more specific, my question was not about origin of varnas, but about the relation between varnas and gunas. Sankaracharya in his bhashya gives a certain compositions of 3 gunas in 4 varnas. This led to the actual question 'why certain combinations of gunas were not included? Is there any logical explanation to it?'

  

If you read the whole discussion, you will get a better idea about the original query and how it was answered by esteemed members of this group.

  

As far as I am concerned, I am satisfied with the explanation provided by Vineet Chaitanyaji, Iyengarji and others.  

  

regards  
shankara
