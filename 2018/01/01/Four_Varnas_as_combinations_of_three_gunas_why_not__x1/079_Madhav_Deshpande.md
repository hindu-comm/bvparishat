Dear Shri Ramanujachar,

  

  May I point out that the Taittirīya-Saṃhitā passages that you have quoted do not use the terms varṇa and guṇa, nor do they connect the origin of different classes to Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. The term varṇa is used in the quoted Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa passage, but the passage does not connect it with guṇas. Best wishes,

  

Madhav Deshpande
