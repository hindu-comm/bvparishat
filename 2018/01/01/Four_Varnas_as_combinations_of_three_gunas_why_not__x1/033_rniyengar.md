Dear Sri Shankar,

  

In many situations arising out of ancient textual statements the 'how-part' can be explained to some extent but not the 'why-part'. Your question has to do with the 'why' and in my opinion there is no 'one and only' answer for this. I don't see what is natural in Rajas not being in the third place unless you define it to be so.

On the other hand if we see the PuraNas (ex: BrahmaaNDa) no creation is possible if Satva and Tamas are in equilibrium, Only due to some imbalance creation starts with Rajas coming into play. Infact the above purANa equates S=Vishnu, R=Brahma and T=Shiva with no sense of superiority or inferiority but only with difference of functionality.
it goes further into creation of deva, danava, martya, sthavara, jangama etc and also Time. Due to my predilection for historical analysis of our socio-cultural traits, it appears more natural to have only three varNas and not four. The above PuraNa in Ch 7 talks of only three types of human-pairs (Mithuna) born out of the face, chest and shoulders of Brahma.

Good question but no unique answer is my view.

regards

RNI
