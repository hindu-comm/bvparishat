Dear Achyutji:

  

You say a Brahman can be Tamasik and a shudra can be Satvik.

  

Can you also tell me how does one become a Brahman or a Shudra?

  

Is birth alone sufficient?

The episode of Yaksha Prashna and the BG in the Mahabharata clearly denote that it is CONDUCT alone that determines who is what. Not Birth.

  

So if as the shastra says it is conduct that denotes varna, what is wrong with the classification based on gunas?

  

After all isn't it gunas that establish causalty in one's conduct?

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
