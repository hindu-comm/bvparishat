Dear friends,

With due respect, I would suggest scholars to think analytically such that we may create a language for the new generation.

While I agree that we have to read the books to understand the story, we should also assume the additional responsibility

of being a resource for the world we live in particularly in context to our children and the youth.

The youth sees us and evaluates our conduct than reading a book. All faiths going with the books have failed. India is an

exception because it allows expansion. The expansion is to create new objective empiricism as we operate ourselves.

We discover the truth by objective self-examination than literal capture of what is written. Books give us a pathway to

proceed, but don't block us from examining our own steps.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
