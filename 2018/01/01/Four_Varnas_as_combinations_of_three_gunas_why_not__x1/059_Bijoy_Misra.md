Dear friends,

  

We had tried to handle a different problem from a neuroscience point of view.

Bharata talks about eight "rasa"s when in theory "rasa" could be infinite. So

the question cold be why certain feelings become etched as experiences.

If anyone is technically inclined, I can send the paper for your use.

Please write privately.

  

So the theory could be that sattava, raja and tama form a human signature of a

myriad qualities "guNa" we nurture and are built up with. The scale is amorphous.

The social classification is due to aptitudes which are a further modification

and manifestation of the inner chemistry. All classifications anywhere are

only conveniences. The universe is a field and not particulate. There are no

boundaries.

  

Best regards,

BM

  

PS. In BVK's analysis, here goes another diversion!
