Dear Paturiji,

  

I view the Vedic period as being of the pastoral age in human evolution. Surely the evolution of the Vedas occurred prior to the formation of the janapadas whence after agriculture became the foundation of social organisation.

  

When agriculture did become the chief mode of production it intiated the stratification of society into varnas depending upon profession each individual engaged in for his individual wherewithal.

  

Subsequently with the formation of kingdoms heredity naturally became the instrumentality through which social continuity was naturally administered.

  

This is the sum and substance of the subject matter of the Mahabharata.

  

Subsequent to the Greek invasion of India, India became a destination for world wide immigration. It is this phenomenon that triggered the evolution of the caste system. Thus the caste system then prevalent had aspects of Varna, ethnicity, language lienage as well as profession ingrained in it.

  

The feudal system of Europe however was much different than that in India primarily because the church played a crucial role in maintaining social integrity in the face of social oppression. It was in this context that Marx said that religion was the opium of the oppressed classes. Be as it may European feudalism was more near to slavery. It was for this reason that the masses revolted firstly against the clergy (reformation) and thereafter against the aristocracy (feudalism). This phenomenon was never witnessed in India.

  

As colonists the British exploited the difference in the two systems by saying that the caste system was based on birth. This was readily accepted and picked up by the Indian intelligencia during British rule.

  

We should remember that India is an ancient land repeatedly exposed to immigration. This was not the case with Europe. Even today Europe cannot exist as a single entity mainly because they are divided by tribes as is the case with Africa and the middle East.



It is therefore necessary to appreciate the literature as well as it's history with an Indian perspective looking to its long uninterrupted history.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
