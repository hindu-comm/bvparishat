Dear Professor Kannan,

  

  I agree with you that these notions of guṇas, varṇas as colors etc, do develop in the Upaniṣads, but they do not explicitly occur in the earlier literature. In my view, there is some anachronism in using later terminology to explain earlier literature, but this is commonly done in the commentaries. That blurs the lines of evolution of terminology and concepts. With best wishes,

  

Madhav Deshpande
