विश- is the root found in words/ roots like प्रविश- , निविश-, आविश-, संविश-, समावेश- etc.

  

विष्णुः is derived from विश-.

  

The meaning of विश- from all the contexts seems to be the common semantic root of enter, dwell, settle, spread, occupy, live etc.

  

Thus विश in the context mentioned should be:-- members of the group/community.

  

Then it is reasonable that some of the विश , get named based on their special feature.
