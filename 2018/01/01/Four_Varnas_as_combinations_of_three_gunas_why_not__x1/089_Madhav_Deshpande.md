Dear Nagarajji,

  

I agree with your concern about the use of the word "caste" to refer to this sūkta being anachronistic. It is anachronistic. I would prefer to use more neutral terms like classes, social groups, or constituent groups of society etc. The word "caste" is more appropriate for jāti, which is not the same as these four classes.
