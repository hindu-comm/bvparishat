Shankaraji,

  

Actually I was trying to answer the question "Why only four varnas (instead of six)" which is in a way same as the question "why certain combinations of gunas were not included".

  

Just for my learning could you please elaborate the logical explanation (other than the human body analogy) for having only "four varna" (and corresponding guna combinations)?

  

Namaste

Suresh
