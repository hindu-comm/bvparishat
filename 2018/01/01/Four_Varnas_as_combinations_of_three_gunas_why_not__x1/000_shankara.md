Pranams to all,

  

It is said in the Bhagavad Gita and other scriptures that the four varnas are based on three gunas. The combination of gunas of the 4 varnas are said to be as shown in the table given below.  

  

|           |                  |                    |                   | |-----------|------------------|--------------------|-------------------| | **Varna** | **Primary Guna** | **Secondary Guna** | **Tertiary Guna** | | Brahmana  | Sattva           | Rajas              | Tamas             | | Kshatriya | Rajas            | Sattva             | Tamas             | | Vaishya   | Rajas            | Tamas              | Sattva            | | Sudra     | Tamas            | Rajas              | Sattva            | | no varna  | Sattva           | Tamas              | Rajas             | | no varna  | Tamas            | Sattva             | Rajas             |



Though the 3 gunas can form 6 combinations as shown in the above table, why are the last two combinations (in the 5th and 6th rows) not valid to form varna?

  

This question was raised in a debate on 'Bhagavad Gita and Caste' in Kerala a few months back. I would like to know if there is any logical explanation why varnas cannot have the last 2 combinations.
