Dear Sri Suresh Srinivasamurthy-ji,

  

First of all, please remove the impression in your mind that if any thing in India is shown to have non-Vedic origin, that supports Aryan Invasion Theory. Also, please don't be under the impression that to prove every aspect of Indian culture to have Vedic origin is the only way to counter Aryan Invasion Theory. One of the chief beginnings of the now discarded Aryan Invasion Theory (which is now replaced by Aryan Migration Theory) is the classification of Indian languages into language families and the consequent theory that the languages belonging to a certain family of languages have a proto language from which all the member languages of the family originated. If you intend to prove every aspect of Indian culture to have Vedic origin, you must first prove that all languages of India originated from Vedic Sanskrit.

  

There are references to non-Vedic peoples in the Vedas themselves. Vedas themselves do not say that those peoples have Vedic origin.

  

In fact, the theory that castes originate from Varnas itself is used against Brahmins just as Aryan Invasion Theory , when it was in vogue, was used. Swami Vivekananda says in one was talks " Don't lay the corpse of the social system at the door of religion", referring to the blaming the evils of the caste system on 'Hinduism". In fact the corpse of the evils of caste system has not been laid anywhere else than at the door of 'Brahminism'. As per these theories, if people of any caste are doing any social, physical, political or any other kind of harm to the people of any other caste, it is because of the inheritance of such tendencies into the caste system from the Varna system having their origins in the Purusha Sukta and Manusmriti's instructions. It is the bringing out the fact that Caste and Varna are two different animals with two different origins, two absolutely genetically unrelated entities, that can help remove these false impressions and false propaganda.

  

I showed how Varna system is different from caste system, with many examples. I can go on even further into many other such details.

  

Regards,
