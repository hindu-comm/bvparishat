This is what I always have been trying to avoid on this forum.

  

I have been repeatedly saying that this is not a forum only of a particular school of Vedanta.

  

I request the highly venerated senior members of the forum, who due to their long experience know what response can be expected from the subscribers to the school of Vedanta about which they make a negative comment, to avoid such negative comments.

  

If they consider that there is a scope for a healthy debate / discussion between two or three different schools of Vedanta on a specific contentious issue between them is possible, they may start a separate systematic debate/discussion on that issue and participate in the debate /discussion in the manner that helps the younger scholars to learn both the method and the content.
