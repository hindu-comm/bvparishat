Namaste Paturi ji



Thanks for clarifying the nature of discussion on this thread in another post reading : \< the **present discussion in the thread is on the ideal type discussed** **in the ancient shaastra texts not either on the actual reality around us today **or **the actual characters in the ancient Sanskrit narratives**. **The actual reality around us is caste not Varna.**.. The characters in the ancient Sanskrit narratives are around the **ideal type called Varna** found in the **ancient Sanskrit Shaastras**.\>



So, the discussion is likely to proceed on ‘ What was practiced ’
and NOT on ‘How Present Practice is inherited and connected to Past’.




In light of this,



a) I feel I have nothing to add to this thread of ‘ Varnas as
combinations of three Gunas’ discussions beyond what is already stated by the Acharyas, using ‘Dharma –Karma –Samskara – Guna -Swabhaava ’ parameters. This is bygone ‘ancient narrative of history’.



b) I feel I can not contribute anything on this thread to modify the actual reality of ‘Caste’ around us in the frame of ‘ Varna’ discussion’ ! as it becomes ‘ nation-community specific faith –belief-practice religion issues’. The equation of ‘ Jaati’ (Caste = Varna) of today is postulated and practiced is a disconnected social
identity in relation to standards of ‘Varna’ set from ancient texts. And this seems to apply equally extended to all ‘Four Varnas’ of Today ! A contextual reality even if it seems to hurt the ‘ identity pride’ of some . This is tormenting present .

BVK Sastry
