Thank you very much, Prof.Nagaraj Paturiji, for your clarification. I understand. Yes, I recall, there are "Oshtamayya"s, who act as priests in non-vedicrituals. In our village the priest for "Maariyamma" was a "washerman". We are discussing these aspects as an academic topic and no disrespect is meant.

Regards,

Murthy
