Shri Nagaraj Paturi ji,

  

One problem I see in identifying varna as vedic and caste as folk/non-vedic is that it indirectly supports aryan invasion theory.

  

If caste is looked upon as an extended family what is the problem in accepting caste as a subset of varna? This is very much true with present day brahmanas who follow all vedic rites like upanayana and also belong to many different castes and sub-castes right?

  

Namaste

Suresh
