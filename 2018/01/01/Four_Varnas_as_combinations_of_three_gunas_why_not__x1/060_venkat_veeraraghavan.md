Namaste all,

  

Regarding the issue of varNa, we have to understand the meanings of the varNas described and the gunas.

  

Tamas has been one dimensionally described as ignorance. The stability of ideas, bones and will are in the realm of Tamas too.

The act of tapasya is a combination of Tamas (Stability of asan, sankalpa, yama, niyama etc) and Rajas (dharana, karma, adhyayana, etc..)

  

Sattva is the mishra of (Tamas + Rajas) (A sattvic intellect is peaceable born out of a steady understanding, world view and a buddhi that actively seeks answers to unresolved questions)

  

Now the traditional definition of Brahmana is Brahmam jAnati iti brahmanah. One who knows Brahman is Brahmana.  
Since the state of Brahman is one that abides in resolution of all opposites, the primary guna has to be Sattva.

Since this state has to be maintained with tapasya- Rajas (the fire of transformation) is a secondary attribute

  

Kshatriya is defined as Kshat trayate iti ksatriya---One who protects others from harm is a kshatriya...The primary quality is the active principle or Rajas. Since Rajas needs to be controlled and channeled by equipoise or dharma, the secondary attribute is Sattva.

  

Vaishya--(I am not sure of the definition here) May be the learned members can fill in the blanks?

  
Shudra--(I am not sure of the definition here) May be the learned members can fill in the blanks?

  

In all 4 varnas however, Rajas is an important attribute since it acts as the transformative agent between Sattva and Tamas. Since the vedic idea of varna was to promote evolution, it has to be a primary or secondary attribute.

  

To sum up, the primary attribute represents outward manifestation and the secondary attribute represents inner adhara.

Since in this world we evolve through karma, rajas which is its guiding principle has to be either primary or secondary. In this case, the actual combinations for varnas is limited to rajas as primary or secondary with the other 2 gunas taking turns as secondary or primary thereby yielding 4 combinations only.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
