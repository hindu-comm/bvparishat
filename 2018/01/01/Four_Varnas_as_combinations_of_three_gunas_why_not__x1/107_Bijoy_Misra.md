Please allow me to extend my thought a bit further.

  

Textual analysis happened and becomes a part of scholarship in the west, because

a word is considered the beginning of the knowledge. India did champion (and this

is where I have been thoroughly impressed) is that the word is a manifestation,

It is the thought that is the root. The initial manifestation of the thought isbhāva.

bhāva is self-generated and one can monitor oneself as championed through  

the Gita. The Gita would continue to then suggest to examine life than examine

the books. I need not go further on the Gita here.

  

My submission is that we give some time to self-examination and expansion

than keep busy in text reading and text analysis. We distill the thoughts from the

words than get stuck with the words themselves. Hence the path to self-contemplation

and personal discovery. We must sharpen our language to express ourselves

to the children and the public. We must take the material in and then examine it

rather than reproduce it. Sheer curiosity is only a beginning, we have a larger task.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
