Dear Shri Karve,

  

The notion of Varṇa predates the emergence of the notion of three guṇas. Before the notion of three or four Varṇas emerges, the R̥gveda uses the terms āryavarṇa and dāsavarṇa, and there are collective references to ubhau varṇau. While the Puruṣasūkta describes the origin of Brāhmaṇa, Rājanya, Vaiśya and Śūdra from the primordial Puruṣa, it does not use the term varṇa or guṇa. The explicit statement of the Bhagavadgītā: cāturvarṇyam mayā sr̥ṣṭaṃ guṇakarmavibhāgaśaḥ is perhaps the oldest available statement linking the notion of guṇa to varṇa.
