नमस्ते ।  
  
  
S \~ "truth" \~ Brahma \~ brAhmaNa varNa  
R \~ "beauty" \~ Vishnu \~ kshatra varNa  
T \~ "love" \~ Shiva \~ shUdra varNa  
  
When all S,R,T more or less retain a harmony, one gets vaiSya (from viS, that also generates viSva = "all").  
  
VarNa-s in my opinion are applicable only upto dvApara (all varNa-s had natural access to swarga). In kaliyuga only jAti-s are applicable.  
  
P.S.  
Equating T as "ignorance" is itself some ignorance. "Tama" in addition to "love", translates into "purity of character".
