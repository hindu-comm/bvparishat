\>While the Puruṣasūkta describes the origin of Brāhmaṇa, Rājanya, Vaiśya and Śūdra from the primordial Puruṣa, it does not use the term varṇa or guṇa.

  

--- Dear Prof. Deshpande,

  

What couldBrāhmaṇa, Rājanya, Vaiśya and Śūdra mentioned in this sukta be? Your statement that it does not use the term varNa is really interesting. Because this part of the sukta is extensively quoted as the origin (not even as the one describing the origin but origin itself ) of the 'caste' system equating the varna system with caste system, as if the sukta created the caste system.

  

The four in the sukta

  

a. not called as Varnas by the sukta but they are varNas only?

  

b. they are not varNas because the sukta does not call them so? if not varNas what can we call them, what is the common name for the four?

  

c. they are castes because they are not called varNas?

  

d. they are neither castes nor varNas ? what are they? There seems to be a system, a social system in the description. What can that be called?
