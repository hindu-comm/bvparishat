Dear Nagarajji,

  

  You have raised an excellent question. Using the terms and categories of varṇa and guṇa to describe the creation of the four classes within the society as found in the Puruṣasūkta does involve anachronism, though these terms are indeed used in later Indian literature to describe these classes. As I mentioned previously, the R̥gveda knows the term varṇa only in the context of āryavarṇa and dāsavarṇa, and talks about these two varṇas using the expression ubhau varṇau. It seems to me that this earlier usage of the term varṇa was later on extended in post-R̥gvedic texts to the four classes of society.
Then the theory of explaining these four varṇas in terms of guṇas arose in the period of the Upaniṣads and the Bhagavadgītā. I would clarify the situation with a developmental account like this. With best wishes,
