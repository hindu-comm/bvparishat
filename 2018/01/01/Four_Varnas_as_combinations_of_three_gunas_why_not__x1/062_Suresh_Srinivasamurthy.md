Sri Shankaraji,

  

I am not saying that Sri Shankaracharya is explaining the prevailing varna system. The reference to purusha sukta -‘ब्राह्मणोऽस्य मुखमासीत्’ (ऋ. १० । ८ । ९१) इत्यादिश्रुतेः establishes the entire universe (not just the society) as the "body" of Brahman. So everything in srushti is **broadly** divided into **four** varna and guna/karma are distributed accordingly. So in every society it is possible to identify people with these four varnas and corresponding gunas.

  

It is also possible to have varna within varna also. The possibility of other combinations (corresponding to other parts in the human body) cannot be ruled out but they more or less fall within the four varnas as observed by Sri Subbuji earlier.

  

  

Namaste

Suresh
