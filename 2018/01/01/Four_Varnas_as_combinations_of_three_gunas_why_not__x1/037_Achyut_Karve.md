Dear Scholars,

  

1\. Do the Gunas as stated in the Bhagvad Geeta relate to an individual or to a social group?

  

2\. Can anyone tell from where these Gunas emanate from within an individual.

  

3\. Does the word 'jati' relate to the individuality of the individual or to the effect of the day to day work that a person engages in for his wherewithal?

  

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
