Sri Suresh Srinivasamurthy-ji,

  

\>If Brahman as the universal Self is accepted to be the origin of all name-forms, then it follows that everything in the world is vedic :)

  

So as Hindus we should not have any problem in looking upon every particular entity/element in nature as a devata and the entire universe as a manifestation of the supreme Brahman / Purusha.

  

-------- This logic leads to absurd conclusions such as - not just caste but all the social systems such as estate system of medieval Europe and different social systems of tribes all over the world originated from Vedas.

  

----------

  

Castes are not at all bad. They are different from Varnas does not mean that they are bad.

  

\>So what is bad is the inter caste rivalry and the false notion of superior/inferior castes and that needs to be eradicated and not the caste itself which helps to sustain diversity.

  

-- Absolutely!!

  

\>The entire society is like a human body and varnas correspond to the four major parts and castes are like different organs/tissues/cells. They all need to recognize the importance of each other and work in unison.

  

  

--- As far as varnas are concerned human body view of varNas found in Rigveda means exactly that "hey all need to recognize the importance of each other and work in unison."

  

Castes too have been working and need to work in unison with each other.

  

Purusha Sukta is not talking about castes does not mean that they should not or do not work in unison.

  

Caste system in India worked fine for millennia.

  

Hierarchies, inter-group prejudices etc. are not the defining features of caste system. These social psychological developments are found all over the world and they operate through the prevailing social system of the time and place. People wrongly diagnose these problems to be rooted in social systems like caste.

  

In any case, caste-system is prevalent today in some aspects and is giving way to new modern social order in some other aspects.
