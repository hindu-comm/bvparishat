Dear Nagarajji,

  

You are correct. My wording was rather sloppy in that piece of writing. If I were writing it today in a more calmer academic environment, I would express myself with more careful wording. The problem lies in part in dealing with Manusmr̥ti's descriptions which expand varṇas into many jātis as products of inter-varṇa marriages (saṃkarajāti). Manu also talks of jātis that are outside of those born from the mouth, arms, thighs and feet, for instance:

  

mukhabāhūrupajjānāṃ yā loke jātayo bahiḥ /

mlecchavācaś cāryavācas te sarve dasyavaḥ smr̥tāḥ //

"In the world, all those jātis that are outside of those born from the mouth, arms, thighs and feet (of the Puruṣa), whether they speak Ārya speech or Mleccha speech, they are all considered to be Dasyus."

  

In such passages, the notions of varṇas and jātis get inextricably entangled. This is no excuse for my earlier somewhat inaccurate usage, but the Sanskrit texts begin to show interconnection of varṇas and jātis. This does not happen in the earliest texts like the R̥gveda, but does show up in Manu and other Smr̥tis.

  

In any case, thanks for pointing to my earlier somewhat inaccurate usage. Best,

  

Madhav Deshpande
