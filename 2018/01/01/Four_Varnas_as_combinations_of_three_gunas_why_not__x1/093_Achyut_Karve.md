Dear Deshpandeji,

  

I see the usage of the word Varna in the Rig Veda referring to local and immigrant groups. It may be the same as that presently happening in the US as as blacks, whites, asian, Latinos etc. 

  

Through the passage of time the word Varna might have been used with a changed connotation.

  

Even if it be so does the verse'cāturvarṇyam mayā sr̥ṣṭaṃ guṇakarmavibhāgaśaḥ' say that guna or karma determine varna or it only states that I have divided the world by varna, guna and karma.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
