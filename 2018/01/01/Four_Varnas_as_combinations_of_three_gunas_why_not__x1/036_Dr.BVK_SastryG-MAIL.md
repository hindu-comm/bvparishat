Namaste Misra ji



Focusing on the specific point \< In the **Vedic composition, it is most likely a word borrowedfrom from some of the local languages**. ….
And then **how old is a word**? >



The question precisely the point of divergence between Orientalists –Colonials and Traditional schools. There is an intersection point of thought, but there is NO real essence or scope for discussion here.

If at all any meaningful progress on this line of discussion needs to be done, then Orientalists need to answer the question on ‘ Relation of Language and Consciousness, The Transcendence and Language of the Transcendent’. That will draw the ‘ Scientists of Brain, Cognition, Consciousness, neuroscience.. quantum physicists..’ to this debate. And also keep the ‘Indologists out of this debate. The entire foundation of ‘Treating Samskrutham as a socio-historic language’ needs to be sacrificed first before further debate.



***Tradition holds*** : This is the foundation of classical Vedic sampradaya and ‘Varna-Ashrama Vibhaga’; an inseparable thought in Gita.



a) Vedic Word Exists beyond Time and Space, as an integral constituent of form *( Naama –Roopa Sahacharyaa Nityatva*). 

b) The ‘Vedic Word’ is at least as old as ‘ Creation’; if not existing a priori creation.



***Anti-Tradition school hold*** : This

a) Vedic Word is historica;, social, linguistically derived from a
PIE language and a social degenerating or refining process of language.

b) The ‘Vedic Word’ is historically later than the time line set by ‘ Biblical God creating this Universe, some 4000 BCE kind of time line’.

c) The ‘Varna’ categorization of society is a ‘oppression perpetuating system.

d) The language of Veda can not be interpreted beyond the boundary of
Social language dynamics and as provided in the Language classification anchored to ‘ Tower of Babel story’.



The debate to be meaningful needs to decide which side of the ‘ language perception’ is being used in the resource work.

Look forward for your views pl.
