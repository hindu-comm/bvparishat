Namaste



1. On \< relation between \< वर्ण and गुण \> and \< adjectival> and \< **Unfortunately the fundamentals of चातुर्वर्ण्य have been grossly misunderstood and wrongly practiced over millennia.**\> :



The key seems to be at what is the entity to which all / whom all / what all - ‘varna – guna – karma ’ goes as adjective !

Would it be ‘Shareera, Jeeva, OR several things’ ?

Would the construction of sloka be limited to the construction as :



\< ब्राह्मणक्षत्रियविशां + शूद्राणां च \> = { ‘ Brahmana – Kshatriya – Vaishya’ AND Shudra’ } 

OR 

\< ब्राह्मणक्षत्रियविशां शूद्राणां \> - \< च> = { ‘ Brahmana – Kshatriya – Vaishya’ Shudra’ AND OTHERS UNCLASSIFIED > 

Such technicality of construction is not uncommon or unnatural .



Just providing additional references that may be useful for further exploration, to facilitate further thinking.



a). Gita 15-2: \< adhashchOrdhvam prasrutAstasya shAkhA
**guNapravruddhA** viShayapravAlA: \| adhashcha mUlAnyanusantatAni
**karmAnubandhIni manuShyalOkE** \|\| \>



b). Gita 15-8 : **\< sharIram** yad **avApnOti** yachchApyutkrAmat **Ishvara**: \| gruhitvaitAni samyAti vAyurgandhAnivAshayAt \|\|
Ch-15-Sl-8



c). Gita 15-10: \< utkrAmantam sthitam vApi bhunjjAnam vA **guNAnvitam** \| **vimUDhA nAnupashyanti** pashyanti GYAnachakShuSha: \|\| (Ch-15-Sl-10)





2. The sweeping statement \<** Unfortunately the fundamentals of चातुर्वर्ण्य have been grossly misunderstood and wrongly practiced over millennia.** \> is difficult to justify for the length of time span indicated . But this statement surely holds its ground in \<Post India Independence period ‘Mandal’- madness> .
