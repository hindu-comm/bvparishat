Why only or certainly a word from the local languages? why not from the language of the users themselves? What is the basis of this idea 'it is most likely a word borrowed  
from from some of the local languages'? How does it not fit into the language of the users? Why is one compelled to find sources outside the language of the users? The logic of evolution from simple to complex leads to the logic of roots to words.
