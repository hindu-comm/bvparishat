Paturiji,

  

Thanks a lot for your critical observations.

  

1\. You are right that Gita doesn't describe the compositions of the 3 gunas in 4 varnas. This explanation occurs in the Gita bhashyas.  

  

2\. Sankaracharya names the primary and secondary gunas of Sudra - Tamas and Rajas. Somehow, you have left them blank in your revised table.  

  

3\. I watched this debate on the Gita and Caste System (Youtubelink given below) a few months back. So, I don't remember the verses quoted. The rationalist raised the question 'why there are only 4 varnas, while logic demands that there should be 6 varnas, since 3 gunas can have 6 combinations?'  

  

4\. We can begin with BG 4.13 and the Sankarabhashya on this verse.  

  

5\. I have no doubt that Varna and caste are different. I merely wrote that this question was raised in a 3 hour long debate on 'Bhagavad Gita & Caste System' between Swami Chidananda Puri and an rationalist named Ravichandran. Swami Chidananda Puri is a traditional scholar and has been actively involved in spreading Advaita Vedanta and in strengthening Hindu Dharma in Kerala for more than 2 decades. The debate is in Malayalam. It is available online for anyone who is interested and can understand Malayalam.

6\. As you say, there is a possibility that Sankaracharya was merely explaining the composition of 3 gunas of persons belonging to 4 varnas which were prevalent in his time.

  

Suppose a person is having 5th or 6th combination of 3 gunas, to which varna will he belong? This question is valid, unless and until it is proved that the last 2 combinations of 3 gunas cannot occur in a person.

  

Now I feel that Vineet Chaitanyaji's argument is the only answer for this question, available to us at present. The same idea was expressed by Iyengarji and Murthyji subsequently.

  

regards  
shankara
