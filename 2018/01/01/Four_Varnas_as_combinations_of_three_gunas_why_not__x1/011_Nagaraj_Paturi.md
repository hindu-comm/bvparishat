Shankara-ji,

  

1\. This is not directly from Gita.

  

2\. Sankara Bhagavatpada's quote can be tabulated as follows:

  

|       |              |                | |-------|--------------|----------------| | Varna | Primary Guna | Secondary Guna |

|           |                   |                   | |-----------|-------------------|-------------------| | Brahmana  | Satva             | Rajas             | | Kshatriya | Tamas             | Rajas             | | Vais’ya   | Rajas             | Tamas             | | S’udra    | --Not mentioned-- | --Not mentioned-- |

  

3\. Did the Kerala discussants quote verses?

  

4\. Which textual source are we discussing ?

  

5\. You said that they were caste. Varna is different from caste. Best example is the word Krishyaadeeni in Bhagavatpada's bhashya. No caste called as Vais'ya today has agriculture as its traditional caste occupation. Varna is a found in Sanskrit texts and regional language texts derived from them. Caste is the one which is found in actual reality. Sanskrit texts do not discuss caste(s).

  

6\. Whichever text is the source of the table quoted by you, it seems to have attempted to explain the available categories of four varnas in termsof Gunas. Its purpose does not seem to map all the possible permutations of gunas with the available Varna categories.
