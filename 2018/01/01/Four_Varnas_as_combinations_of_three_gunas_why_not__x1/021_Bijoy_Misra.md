Paturiji,

Quite possible. Those sections of the Vedic literature would need more analysis.

I have heard that vish is a Munda word. I went to the Himalayas last month

and I heard it among the Bodas in north east Assam.

  

My language knowledge is limited, but I have reason to believe that our current

understanding of many of these needs revision and new analysis.

  

Thank you.
