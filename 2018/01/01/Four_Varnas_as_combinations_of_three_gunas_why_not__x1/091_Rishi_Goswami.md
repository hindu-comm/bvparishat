Namaskar Vidvadjanaah.  
I have a query. I have heard someone say that even Brahmans have different catogories upon their works. Suppose if a Brahman is working as a trader, he may be vaishya brahman. I've even heard someone saying marjar/bidal brahman and hamsa brahman. Also, the one who eats the food served on the 13th day after death( terahvi ka bhoj) is somewhat kAka brahman/some other name? I don't know where all of this is written but if there is, what are different types in Brahmanas kshatriyas etc?

Thankyou.  
Rishi.
