नमो विद्वद्भ्यः  

\*\*\*\*\* this is in regards to Sarva Darshana Samgraha statement.

This is only to clarify the position of Visistadvaita regarding this issue of BhedAbheda. **This post is not related to "Varna" topic.**

Let us examine here if there is any similarity between Visistadvaita and Jainism. It is very well known that Jainism accepts “anekAnta vAda” or Saptabhangi vAda.

The term, Saptabhangi refers to the seven points of view from which reality can be viewed ."Syad' means "from one of the perspectives (stand point)". But it does not mean doubt and it only refers to a particular point of view.

The methodology of seven fold predications, as per this anEkAnta view, are as follows :-

1.  . syAd asti : From a particular point of view 'It is".

2.  syAd nAsti : From a different point of view "It is not".

3.  iii) syAd -asti -nAsti : From a still different approach to problem
    "It is and is not"

4.  syAd –avaktavyam : From another point of view “lt is inexpressible"

5.  syAd asti avaktavyam : From a point of view “It is and is
    inexpressible"

6.  syAd nasti avaktavyam : From another point of view "It is not and is
    inexpressible"

7.  syAd asti nAsti avaktavyam : From a different point of view “It is
    and it is not” and is inexpressible.”

## The concept of visistAdvaita

  

The opinion of Sri Ramanujacharya is that Brahman is the ever existing reality that is always endowed with attributes (savisEsa) and is to be understood according to the different phases or avathas, ie. In the phase of dissolution or unmanifest state or pralayAvastha, there is only one entity Brahman. In this state there is abhEda (non- difference or unity); and in the phase of creation (sriSti), there is difference (bhEda or plurality) between souls, matter and Isvara, the Lord. **Note that non-difference (abhEda) and difference (bhEda) phases are not simultaneous and do not refer to the same state**. In the state of pralaya, the term sUksma cit acit visista Brahma is used in Sribhasya. Here Sri Ramanujacharya defines sUksmatva as impossibility of differentiation in terms of names or forms (or nAma rUpa vibhAga anarhatva). In fact Sri Ramanujacharya states in Sribhasya, that in the state of pralaya, even Brahman himself cannot differentiate between himself and his body (or souls or matter)

  

"svEnApi svasarIratayA prthak pratipatti anarha dasA" - sribhashya

  

This means that in the state of pralaya, Sri Ramanujacharya essentially does indicate that it is not possible to differentiate between souls, matter or Isvara. This state is beyond the grasp of intellect. Essentially that state is "abhEda". We should remember that Brahman is beyond comprehension.

  

na tatra cakshur gacchati na vag gacchati no manah

na vidmo na vijanimo yathaitad anushishyad

anyad eva tad viditad atho aviditad adhi

iti shushruma purvesham ye nas tad vyacacakshire



यस्यामतं तस्य मतं मतं यस्य न वेद सः।

अविज्ञातं विजानतां विज्ञातमविजानताम् ॥

 - this is the famous **warning** from Kenopanishat which states no amount of shastra-jnana is enough to clearly determine the nature of Brahman. Brahman is not logically or using texts such as vedas, determinable. ie. **Brahman is a singularity beyond comprehension.**

  

**However, Visistadvaita siddhanta is stated in the work “sarva darsana samgraha” of vidyAranya as essentially identical to anekanta view of Jainism.** **For an impartial observer, this is not correct**. In the Jainist view, these different points of view refer to the same entity at the same time. However, in the view of Visistadvaitins the bhEda and abhEda are in different phases, namely, during the creation phase and the dissolution phase, respectively.
