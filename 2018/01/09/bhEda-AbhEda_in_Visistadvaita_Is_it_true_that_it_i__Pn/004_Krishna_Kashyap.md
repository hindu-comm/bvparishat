Thanks Suresh Ji.

  

This is a good summary, given in Vedartha Samgraha. However, it is true that many people have difficulty in understanding visistadvaita. Since Advaita and Dvaita are on the two ends of the spectrum, probably it is easier to understand.

  

However, there is a complete thesis on this written by KS Varadachar, which I had translated. I did not want to write such a huge answer.

However, I wanted to address some specific issues in detail. I will do so when I get some time. Now I am stuck with some work deadline.
