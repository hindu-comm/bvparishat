Thank you Sri Kashyap ji, for the clarification. From what you have delineated it is clear that abheda and bheda are postulated as obtaining in **different avastha**s. However, is it possible to say that abheda and bheda are obtaining in the ***same enti*ty,** Brahman, the only reality, although in **different avashtas** of that entity? It would then appear that the two viruddha dharmas, bheda and abheda, are in the **same dharmi.** The Sapthabhangi nyaya that you have stated also pertains to **different points of view of the same reality**.
