Namaste

  

Again if God is the Material Cause of the world there is Abheda of the world and God because world is coming out of God. But there is Bheda also because God and Cit and Acit vastus of the world cannot be same as God. Cit and Acit also cannot be same.Again there is Viruddha Dharmas of Bheda and Abheda. Maadhvas solve this saying God is not Material Cause for world but only Instrumental Cause. A potter only makes a pot. He and the pot are not the same. Therefore God is only Nimitta Karana but not Upadana Karana. There is only Bhedabetween God and world. No Abheda.Advaitis solve this saying God is Material Cause and Instrumental Cause also but this whole process is Illusion only. Its not really happening. Therefore there is no real Viruddha Dharmas in God. World and God are same. There are no two things but One. There is only Abheda between God and world. No Bheda.
