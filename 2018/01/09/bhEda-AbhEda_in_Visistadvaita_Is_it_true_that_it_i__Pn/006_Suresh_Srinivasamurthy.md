Sri Krishna ji,

  

//This means that in the state of pralaya, Sri Ramanujacharya essentially does indicate that it is not possible to differentiate between souls, matter or Isvara. This state is beyond the grasp of intellect. Essentially that state is "abhEda". We should remember that Brahman is beyond comprehension.//

  

The above statement gives an impression that in VA, abheda (oneness of Brahman with the jiva) is accepted only in pralaya (before creation).

This is not correct. At any point of time there is difference between the chit, achit and Ishwara.

  

Abeda is based on the fact of "aprithak siddha vishesha" (inseparable oneness) due to shareera-atma bhava. This is the pradhana pratitantra of VA that makes it different from Advaita and Dvaita (and integrates them too!). Though the body (jiva/jada) is different from the Self (Brahman) it has no separate existence apart from Brahman. The body derives its existence from Brahman. Brahman as the "cause" pervades the world which is an "effect". So material cause is justified as the effect is not eternal to Cause. At the same time there is no mixture in characteristics between body and self.

  

Hope that clarifies.

  

Namaste

Suresh
