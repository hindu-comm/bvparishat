Dear Sri Suresh ji,

  

The above explanation of 'abheda' as the effect having no existence apart from Brahman is stated by Shankara in a number of ways:

  

एकविज्ञानेन च सर्वविज्ञानप्रतिज्ञानात् न ब्रह्मव्यतिरिक्तवस्त्वस्तित्वमवकल्पते । BSB 3.2.32

  

कार्यं च कारणादव्यतिरिक्तमिति वक्ष्यामः — ‘तदनन्यत्वमारम्भणशब्दादिभ्यः’ (ब्र. सू. २ । १ ।……  

  

ब्रह्माव्यतिरिक्ताश्च सर्वे विज्ञानात्मानः ;  Tai. Bha. 2.11.4.  

  

कार्यं च कारणेनाव्यतिरिक्तम् । Br.up. bha. 1.6.1  

  

In Dvaita too they hold the world/jiva to have only dependent existence/reality, paratantra satya, while Svatantra satya is of Brahman.

  

Thus, the aprthak siddhi idea is contained in other systems too.
