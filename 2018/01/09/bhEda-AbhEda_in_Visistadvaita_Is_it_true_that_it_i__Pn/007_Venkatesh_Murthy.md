Namaste

  

Aprithak Siddha Vishesha cannot be justification for Abheda of things with Viruddha Dharmas. Jeeva has limitations like Alpajnatva, Alpashaktimattva and so on. Ishwara has Sarvajnatva, Sarvashaktimattva and so on. How can there be Abheda of Jeeva and Ishwara with Viruddha Dharmas like these? Even for Body and Soul there are Viruddha Dharmas like Death for body but no death for soul. Either Abheda has tobe deniedOR we have to say the Viruddha Dharmas are not real.
