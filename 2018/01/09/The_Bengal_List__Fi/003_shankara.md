Namaste,

  

There is an error in the citation. It is not JASB but JAS (The former is the journal of Bombay Asiatic Society and the latter is from Calcutta). Page no is also wrong in the citation. Actual page no is 209.

  

It is available at the following link.  

<https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.29752/2015.29752.Journal-Of-The-Asiatic-Society-Of-Bengal-Vol-xli-1872#page/n235/mode/2up>  

  

regards  
shankara
