Namaste !

  

BTW, is "The Bengal List" name of some journal ?

  

I came across it here:

NALANDA: The Other side of its history:<http://bhpromo.org.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=59&Itemid=65>

  

## Broadley, (1) JASB, 1872, pp.299 ff. ;  (2) Ruins of the Nalanda Monastery at Buragon (1872), Bengal List, pp.242-56

  

Is it available online ?

  

Thanks and regards

Narayan Prasad
