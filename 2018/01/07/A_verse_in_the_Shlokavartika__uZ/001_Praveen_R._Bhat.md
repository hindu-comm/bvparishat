Namaste Subbuji,

  

Looks like the text reads मिथ्याज्ञानाऽविशेषेऽपि।

  

Pt. Ganganatha Jha translates this as follows:

"And (thus) the falsity of cognitions being common to all systems of philosophy, it is not proper to reject the Sankhya, andbe partial to the Bauddha philosophy alone."

  

Kind rgds,  
--Praveen R. Bhat  
/\*येनेदं सर्वं विजानाति,तं केन विजानीयात्।Through what should one know That owing to which all this is known! \[Br.Up. 4.5.15\] \*/
