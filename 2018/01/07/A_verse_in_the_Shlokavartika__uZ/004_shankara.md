I was already looking for the kArikA earlier, but found only part 1 at <https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.496013>. I wasn't able to find the part 2 anywhere, which should have this shloka. Perhaps, someone here, such as Shankaraji,may be able to enlighten on the availability of the same.

  
The English translation available at <https://archive.org/details/slokavartika015341mbp> has footnotes quoting Karika, but I am not sure if they include entire translation. In any case, nothing in there indicates what Sankhya means in the said shloka. Maybe you will be able to better trace it.

  

Kind rgds,
