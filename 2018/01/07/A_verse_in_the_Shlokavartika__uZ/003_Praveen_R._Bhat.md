I was already looking for the kArikA earlier, but found only part 1 at <https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.496013>. I wasn't able to find the part 2 anywhere, which should have this shloka. Perhaps, someone here, such as Shankaraji,may be able to enlighten on the availability of the same.

  
The English translation available at <https://archive.org/details/slokavartika015341mbp> has footnotes quoting Karika, but I am not sure if they include entire translation. In any case, nothing in there indicates what Sankhya means in the said shloka. Maybe you will be able to better trace it.
