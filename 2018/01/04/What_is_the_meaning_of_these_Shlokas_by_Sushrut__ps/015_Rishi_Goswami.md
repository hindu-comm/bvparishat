Also, a valid question was raised about Shree Ram which I want to know.  
Bhagwan Ram went kill a deer for Sitaji. Dashrathji also accidentally killed Shravnkumar intead of the deer. Same case with Pandu. Being from ksahtriya kulam, they are allowed to have anishiddha mansam. Does that mean Bhagwan Ram may have also been a nonvegetarian? I have no clue so I'm just asking. I'm not making an assertion.  
Thankyou.  
Rishi.
