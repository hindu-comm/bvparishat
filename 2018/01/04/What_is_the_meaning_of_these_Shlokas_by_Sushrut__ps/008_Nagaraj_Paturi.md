Sri / Srimati Shashi-ji,

  

My post was not against discussing the topic raised by the thread initiator.

  

It is just limited to your mention of Shankaracharya's Parakaya pravesha narrative.

  

I am not against discussing sex related matters as long as they are based on textual evidences.

  

Sex as taboo is the influence of Victorian Ethics.

  

Warm regards,

  

Nagaraj
