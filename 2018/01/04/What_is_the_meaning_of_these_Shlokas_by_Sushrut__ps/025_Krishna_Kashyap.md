Interesting information.

Again, did the first jiva come with a sharira or not? this goes back to vriksha beeja problem. which came first?. this is same as the karma avidya anadi chakra. did karma come first or avidya? **Hence Nature and Nurture issue is not easily solvable.**

  

One can dismiss this and say all jivas were created equal very long time back and some jivas misbehaved and they ended up in wrong yonis and started doing wrong karmas - as indicated by this verse.

  

यथा सुदीप्तात् पावकात् विस्फुलिङ्गाः सहस्रषः प्रभवन्ते सरूपा:

  

This is again a convenient logic used by some vedantins to remove any possible sin or discrimination on the part of the creator the Lord. However, then again the questions remain :

why did Brahman create in the first place? He could have just been happy with himself or itself? these statements appear to give some views:

  

लोकवत्तु लीला कैवल्यं - bramha sutras,

  

which state this universe is a play of the lord. further it says dont question this Leela since it is like questioning the play of a little kid, which builds a castle with sand and destroys it the next moment.
**In essence, Brahman is a singularity and beyond all logic**. Hence this problem is not something which can be answerable. Brahman is either not knowable at all (as per advaita) or cannot be known completely (as per visistadvaita and other schools).

  

तत् विदितात् अधि - केन उपनिषत् . It is beyond all comprehension.

  

there are further controversies since "sristi" may be denied completely using maya theory. Let us not get into such details, since it is going to be a never ending tarka. again tarko aprathistanat api !!

  

Today, coming back to LGBT issues, our shastras can only indicate some aspects to it.

  

**The good news** is that our shasthras do not discriminate LGBT to the extent other scriptures do- which could result in extremism of imposing laws that lead to stoning them to death or throwing them off buildings.
