Namaste Shashi Joshi



 Just to clarify the points raised **\< there are many motives** for people to **'dig' into Sanskrit works** for **proving or disproving** some pet theory of the moment \>

 And add to this motivations \< **Provoking, Harming** \> also.



 Some spend their time and energy in mandirs and some in Vegas. Their (Ishta) Kama –Dharma = desires are not for public debate ! No one can stop a researcher from ‘Swecchaa –Swaatantrya –Swaadhya’:: Freedom and licentious self-Study and motivated interpretation ! 



1. The two quests related to ‘Sanskrit digging’ are differently motivated and find different end results. The outcome may be to the liking or otherwise by factors of personal cultural sensitivity issues.

 The curios quest cannot be made to cost damage to the
structural integrity of discipline, being quoted out of context using
selective quotes for presentation.



2***.** The ‘Shaastra kaaras motive’*** in ‘ (Traditional Shaastra)
Sanskrit-resource-digging’ is to understand ‘Shaastra paddhati’ for a professional practice and ‘Abhyaasa- Phala’ for achieving a goal.

 It is not for historical curios analysis. What is the guidance from the ‘Text – now ’ (Vartamane – Vyaavaharike) ?

- In this case, Sushrutas Ayurveda text aimed to provide guidance for Vaidya practice for the goal of Swasthya- Saukhya – Swastha Rutu Charya in life style for prescription.

- Therefore, Ayurveda becomes a Upa-Veda integrated to ‘Vedangas ( jyotish) and Veda- prayoga- parihara (Daiva vyapashraya). Here ‘Sanatana Dharma’ guides for ‘ Purushartha’.



 ***The ‘ Modern researchers motive***’ in ‘ (Traditional Shaastra)
Sanskrit-resource-digging’ seems to be a curios to understand ‘Poorva-abhyasa = past society/ people /community practice’ as history of discipline and 

 Community practice of past. ‘ Ayurveda -Abhyaasa- Phala’ becomes an alternate –complementary green low cost hand maid of
Pharma- medicine.

- Sushrutas Ayurveda text’ study comes in a segmented way to pick partial eclipsed views and practices of tradition and community
to target a smear campaign model ‘ Kettle calls pot black’. 

- Ayurveda –Study is forcibly disconnected from its original design, pedagogy , purpose, practice and language ! Academia and Media guides ratings and ranting for ‘excitement through the blog post likes’.



3. You have already answered your defense on the question \< **But what about things of this mortal world?** Our rishis never shunned any topic, that is why we have scriptures on almost anything! \>

 in your post :



 \< "Just because it is said here, doesn't mean it is sanctioned. A book on cookery may describe how to cook dog's meat, but that doesn't mean you should eat" \>.



4. My two cents addition and extension from my side for the ‘History Research Buffs, promoters and defenders of this approach’ –



 \< "Just because it is deliberated in the text, it doesn't mean it was a historical social reality and carried a ‘Shaastra’ sanction. A prayaschitta mentioned for ‘ Gurutalpa-ga / maatru-gaami ’ (= sleeping with Guru’s wife / bed sharing with mother) in ‘Dharma Shaastra, Purana ‘ may describe how to get rid of sin of sharing bed with Masters wife/ bed sharing with mother ’ , but that doesn't mean ‘ that the society permitted /practiced / promoted such acts and then provided measures of expatiation for the sin". The \< relevant ( ?) \> passages cannot be used to make an ‘ anthropological construct and Indology research’ argument of ‘ relevant today for laws to regulate ‘ incestuous pornography’ marketed as adult entertainment or authority to dispense legal verdict of ‘mantra- yajna – yoga –tapas pariharas’ as ‘ alternative complementary supplementary punishment’. 



 Please explore the evolution, concepts and history of civil and criminal justice legal discipline in many nations where ‘ religion got violated by regime’ . And of course ‘ Religious institutions and
leaders going down by ‘Dharma –Shaastra violation’. Latest incident just costed Indian society a small sum exceeding 10,000 crores in the ‘ partial name of Sach’ ( Truth)! OMG, Please pardon, if you can.
