Namo vidhvadbhyah:

  

ǒपतूरेतोऽितǐरƠात्पुǽषो भवित । मातुः रेतोऽितǐरƠाǔ×Ƹयो भवÛ×युभयोबȸजतुãय×वाÛनपुंसको भवित । - garbhopanishad

  

If the father’s seed is more potent, it becomes male; if the mother’s seed is stronger, it becomes female. If the seeds are equal, it becomes an intersexual (napu÷saka, neither male, nor female).  

  

this is the statement of garbhopanishad. Unfortunately the text is not showing up well on this browser.

  

summary - a napumsaka is not by nurture according to garbhopanishad.

that means the the issue of heterosexual thoughts or marriage etc does not occur to them by nature.

  

if every thought we get is from nurture and nothing comes out nature, then genetics has no value. can we prove unequivocally that genetics has no value using Hindu Scriptures? this is my question.

  

that particular quote regarding "one should develop good thoughts" has an issue too. If we compare non- identical twins who have similar surroundings, will their thoughts be identical? Not true. genetics and hence Nature does play a part.

  

पञ्चैतानि महाबाहो कारणानि निबोध मे \|  
साङ् ख्ये कृतान्ते प्रोक्तानि सिद्धये सर्वकर्मणाम् \|\| 13\|\|  

  

अधिष्ठानं तथा कर्ता करणं च पृथग्विधम् \|  
विविधाश्च पृथक्चेष्टा दैवं चैवात्र पञ्चमम् \|\| 14\|\|  

  

These verses of chapter 18 bhagavadgita indicate that there are 5 reasons for any action. adhistana is body and karta is jiva. actions or thoughts depend on the type of nervous system, body parts and capabilities etc, and also the individual who has karmic baggage, in addition to other reasons. One cannot say his body does not play any part regarding his thoughts. and thoughts do become actions.

  

Nature for a napumsaka is not the same as for others; and nature does affect the thoughts and actions of that person. One does not have a choice to choose ones'body or to become a napumsaka or heterosexual.

  

Obviously one has to develop good thoughts etc. but what is good for one is different for other based on body. What is acceptable to society etc may be different.
