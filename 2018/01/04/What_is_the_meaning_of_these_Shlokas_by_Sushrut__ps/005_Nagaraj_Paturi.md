\>I would say that even Shankaracharya debated on Kamashastra.

  

-- This hagiographical narrative is one of the most ridiculous ones occurring in such works.

  

How on earth can any debate of an extraordinary meemaamsaka (who unfortunately has been depicted like a joker in one of the recent Telugu movies on S'ankaraachaarya ) and a prodigal reviver of Vedanta get digressed into an ubsolutely unrelated topic of 'practical experience of the contents of Kamasutra/Kamashastra' ?

  

These hagiographies sometimes!
