All tendencies, called vasana, is by nurture. What is nurtured, positive or negative, becomes one's nature. The Upanishads, Bhagavadgita, etc. are quite clear about this. These verses, said to be from the Yoga vasishtha would sum it up:

  

शुभाशुभाभ्यांमार्गाभ्यां वहन्ती वासनासरित्। पौरुषेण प्रयत्नेन योजनीया शुभे पथि।।

अशुभेषु समाविष्टं शुभेष्वेवावतारय। स्वमनः पुरुषार्थेन बलेन बलिनां वर।।

द्रागभ्यासवशाद्याति यदा ते वासनोदयम्। तदाभ्यासस्य साफल्यं विद्धि त्वमरिमर्दन।।

  

There is also the famous quote:

Watch yourthoughts, forthey become words.Watch your words, forthey become actions.Watch your actions, forthey becomehabits.Watch yourhabits, forthey become yourcharacter. Andwatch yourcharacter, for itbecomes yourdestiny.  

  

The exhortation for the practice of shama, dama, etc. is based on the very principle that it is one's actions, nurturing, that makes one's nature.
