Namaste

Please permit me to voice a few concerns on the nature of such questions on a public forum and out of context quoting traditional texts, seeking a link to sexual behavior and temperament. The issue raised is partial aspect of larger question debated in the text ; the text passage seems to be drawn out of context. (I would have appreciated if the quote below carried the 'Adhyaya reference and heading and context of discussion').

**Concern -1**: Why drag in 'homosexuality' debate on a public forum where majority of the scholars seem to be experts in tradition and language ? Is it a priority issue for research ? And even if it be so, can an Ayurveda practitioner make counseling recommendations the way the text suggests ??

**Concern -2**: If the quoted section is needing an explanation from the perspective of 'Homo sexuality', the relevant comparative passage if any from ' Kaama -Shaastra' should have been looked at first, before looking in to 'Ayur-Veda' pointing to the birth of a person with a 'disorientation of sexual temperament, incapable of physical act and pervert means for overcoming the syndrome called ED ! How the parental sexuality leads to the ' Psycho-Physiological Temperament and sexual orientation of progeny, the recommended treatment to facilitate such persons to enable them have the pleasure of physical act through sexual union' are clearly a specialist discipline even in medicine !? Does the forum need this elaboration?

  

**Concern -3**: If shopping for 'flowers' is done in a street where 'stones' are sold, one cannot complain for lack of good smell. The quoted passage from 'Ayurveda' work provides the following information:

a) The features of individuals with several kinds of sexual disorientation, inability, disability, perversion and aberration.

b) Ayurvedic explanation on how an 'impotent male' is born ( like low sperm count...). And Ayurvedic remedial measure to make such a person virile, physically fit

 for a sexual union and medical remedies to 'make the person potent to get a child'.

c) The text also points to some of the perfumes/ smells/acts that cause a ' emotional invigorating stimulation' resulting in Viagra kind of effects to improve blood circulation and to 'overcome the temporary ED symptom. The details listed in the text is a reflection on the diversity of social perversions of sexuality, far beyond the ' homo-sexuality' or even that of LGBT models.

**Concern -****4:** **Should one be happy that the ancient society in which Sushruta****’****s work came in to practice had all the perver****sions and disorientations of sexuality OR proud that Ayurveda- acharyas** **‘** **observed and identified****’** **all these**** human sexuality** **temperaments** **and suggested a counseling- medical correction ? way before modern Gyno-practice becomes a profession / Viagra becomes** **the largest advertised and** **global****ly** **selling** **‘****pill****’** **? Or should one feel satisfied** **that** **Indian society was not exception to human** **frailty** **of** **‘** **Sex****’****, even if the reckoning were to be made from** **‘** **Indra as** **‘** **ahalyaa** **–****jaara****’****? and treated by the** **‘****divine doctors of Ayurveda****’****?** **Should Ayurveda practitioners be worrying about** **Ginseng- Opium- V****iagra rasayanas** **on the authority of Susruta** **more than educating about** **‘****Swastha-****Vrutta- Rutu Charyaa- Brahma Charyaa****’** **?**
