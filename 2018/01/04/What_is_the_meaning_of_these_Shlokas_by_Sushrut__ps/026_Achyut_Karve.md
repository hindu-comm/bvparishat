Dear Scholars,

  

Is it necessary to ascribe intent to nature?

  

How can the part know the whole?

  

Is it not well known that laws of causation have no universality? They only signify how many appreciates nature.

  

Are they therefore not referred to as efficient cause and not the real one?

  

Is it that the written word is the ultimate truth?

  

Should even the scriptures not be appreciated in their historical context as first steps in the evolution of human sensibilities?

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve
