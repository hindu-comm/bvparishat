With all due respect to the feeling of members on this group, I do want to present my views.

Apologies up front if I am not able to communicate fully.

  

I understand that there are many motives for people to 'dig' into Sanskrit works for proving or disproving some pet theory of the moment. (Ref to did Rama eat meat thread or was there non-vegetariansim in Vedic times...)

  

But regarding this particular topic of Sushrut shlokas, I would say that even Shankaracharya debated on Kamashastra.

Kamasutra is not considered a taboo work. It deals with all topics under it very sincerely yet dispassionately, a rare feat on such a topic!

  

To know what Ayurveda says on such topics that are relevant today (may not be deemed fit for in person mixed age gathering), is very important.

Kamasutra deals not with medical aspects of mind (just desire part), but in today's medical field too we have study of this topic. Though not mainstream topic of discussion, it sure doesn't get stern scoldings.

  

Maybe the learned in this group can be more patient as well.

  

I, with all my respect for Rishis and shAstra, do look for - what all did our ancestors cover? What all interested their intelligence?

It is actually fascinating, eye-opening to read such things as well. Spirituality has been talked for ever and ever, with not much left to bring forth.

But what about things of this mortal world? Our rishis never shunned any topic, that is why we have scriptures on almost anything!

It is great, our strength.

  

Kamasutra comes with a warning as well - "Just because it is said here, doesn't mean it is sanctioned. A book on cookery may describe how to cook dog's meat, but that doesn't mean you should eat"

  

Apologies once again if I mis-communicated, since there is no mis-intention.

  

  

  
  

Thanks,  

\~ Shashi
