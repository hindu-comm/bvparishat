Haraye namah  
Namo vidvadbhyah  
I apologize for my delay in reying due to no internet connection. I wanted to know what our Rishis have written in our scriptures. What I believe is anything if done with the right intent is Dharma. Killing is bad, even an ant but not a soldier for the nation. In case of Kaam(desire), when it becomes addiction is vaasana. Anything, not necessarily sexual desire. This is not for the intent to insult or cause any harm. I just was researching for myself on this topic, where on the net I came accross 16 types of Shandas(men with sexual inability, broadly termed as eunuchs). I searched for Irshyashanda where sushruta has written the following.

It's a public forum with highly experienced schollars, but I don't know where do I find anything in Kaamashastra or Ayurveda. I wanted to know what the Rishis may have experienced about it and what is the provision fir such men. What is the kartavya akartavya etc. Not to insult or demean anyone, but I want to know for myself the meaning of those shlokas.

I partially understand what's written but I'm not so mature ti get the whole meaning/tatparya. So I asked on this forum. I apologize again to the schollars who found it discourteous or ashishta. I have no intention to break maryada of respective schollars.  
Thankyou  
Rishi.
