If everything was summed up as nurture only, then e.g. how did Prahlad come up in Hiranyakashipu's family - a total opposite to his father's given nurture.

  

Gotra won't have any meaning if nature/genetics didn't have a role to play.  

  

Even in modern genetics, they talk of predisposition based on certain genes.

What would be of interest is if any sanskrit medical works talk about any kind of genetics, a bit quantifiable if possible. We do have enough qualitative references to gene or nature factor.
