To clarify what Rishi Goswamiji may be interested in =

  

Rishi Goswami Ji's question is valid for some reasons:

  

In Semitic religions, any LGBT kind of activity is sinful and in fact, the punishment is "they should be killed". What are the views of Hindu Scriptures regarding this issue? seems to be a valid question and a research topic to me. Are Hindu Scriptures similar to them?

  

Further, Medical Research indicates information which is contrary to those Semiticscriptural views. Hence there is a huge reformation going on to change their views regarding such social aspects.  

  

Also, there is a debate on if LGBT tendencies are by nature or nurture? what do the Hindu scriptures say regarding this?Incidentally, Garbhopanishat indicates that it is natural and not apsychological disorder!

  

I am not an organizer. However, I wanted to clarify some people's views on this subject. This subject may be taboo to this group. I just wanted to share my views. sorry If I am offending anyone.

  

Obviously, Dr. BVK shastrijirightly did mention that if this subject is drilled too deep, unnecessaryand irrelevant information may pop up. Probably this may need some moderation.
