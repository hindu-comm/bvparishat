Yes Shashiji. Being a Ram bhakt myself, I won't indulge in kutark or shanka. It was just my jijnasa for that. Like the shloka, प्राणात्यये तथा श्राद्धे प्रोक्षितं द्बिजकाम्यया । देवान् पितॄन् समभ्यर्च्च्य खादन् मांसं न दोषभाक् ॥ says that one can eat khaadya maansam only. And it is only nishiddha for Brahmans. Other varnas are allowed. Based on this I asked my jijnasa about Shree Ram.  
Thankyou.
