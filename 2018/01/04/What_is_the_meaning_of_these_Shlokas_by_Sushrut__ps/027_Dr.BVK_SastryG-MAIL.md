Namaste  
  
On similar ' jijnyasaa' issues, I recall a piece of advice from my elders and share the same, for what it may be worth.  
  
It was an amplification of two wisdom statements :  
a) Na devacharitam charet : Do not blindly imitate the ways of Divine Avataras.  
b) Devo bhootvaa , devam yajet : First Become , Then Be a 'Deva' and Then do the 'Deva- yajna'.  
  
Yoga, as anushaasana is the path way to 'Become Deva'. What suits 'Tapas and Swadhyaaya' is the social charter of profession and lifestyle , food habits and practices. If one decides that one is a 'Brahmana' then the same needs to be established by Thought, action, deed .  
It is not quoting text to justify the ' Ishta -Kaama-Charyaa' and taking shelter under the 'Deva-charita'.
