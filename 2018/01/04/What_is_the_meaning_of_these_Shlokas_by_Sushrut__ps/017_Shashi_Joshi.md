Rishi ji,

This topic of Ram and meat eating, I brought up because all the threads on the net that ask this question are not interested in anything else of Ramayana. They just want to prove their own agenda with this topic. That becomes malintent. They say that if your own god Rama ate meat then what is wrong to do so now.

  

By that logic not just meat eating, all other things of that society should be brought back, like the varna ashram, prana jaye par vachana na jaye etc.

  

Please search for discussion on that thread separately.

  

My intent was not to bring up such topics but ro give examples of red herrings.  
  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
