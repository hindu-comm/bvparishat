I was reminded of the case of Ashleelataa against the Marathi book, Anangaranga of Kalyanamalla,edited by Gajanan Raghunath Mule of Karjat in early 1900s.It was dismissed by Chief Justice Mr.Brown,with the remark that,"Anangaranga gives an insight into the Ethics of Hindu Erotics". The blind followers of the British could not digest it.
