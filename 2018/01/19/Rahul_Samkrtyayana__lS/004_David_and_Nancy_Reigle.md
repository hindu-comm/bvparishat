Dear Sri Sudip Haldar,  
  

Rāhula Sāṅkṛityāyana wrote three articles describing his trips to Tibet in search of Sanskrit manuscripts, and what he found there. I have scanned these articles and given links to them in my blog post, "Sanskrit Manuscripts in Tibet":

There I have also given links to other articles I scanned pertaining to the manuscripts that he found, including more current listings of them. He was an extraordinary person, who has my highest respect.

  

Best regards,

  

David Reigle
