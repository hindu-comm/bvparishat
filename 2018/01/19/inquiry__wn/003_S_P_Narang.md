Dear Professor Pataskar,



The book was edited by Vibhutibhushan Nyayacharya (Bhattacharya) and published by the Sampurnanand Sanskrit University, formerly Government Sanskrit College, Varanasi in the 60s, as far as I remember. The introduction and paraphrasing, both done by Vibhutibhushan himself is in Sanskrit.He was the librarian of the Institute at that time and became its librarian subsequenyly.
