Pranams to all,

  

Works of Mahakavi Kalidasa in Tamil in the open domain seem to be very rare. In my search, I found only the following editions, which I have uploaded to <https://archive.org/details/Works_of_Kalidasa_Tamil_Translation_Commentary>

  

Meghasandesa with Tamil Commentary - M Duraiswami Aiyangar 1913  
Raghuvamsa Sarga 1 to 6 with Tamil Commentary - CR Acharya 1991  
Kumara Sambhava Sarga 1 to 3 with Tamil Translation 1899  

Sakuntalam Tamil Translation - Nakai Vetachalam Pillai 1907

  

Please let me know if you come across any other editions of Kalidasa's works in Tamil on the internet.  

  

regards  
shankara
