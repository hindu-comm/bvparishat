Friends,

  

Happy Vasantapanchami.

It is popularly known that Indian philosophers created the number theory

and also conceived of the concept of zero and infinity. I would like to get

any reference on the development of the concept from the knowledge point

of view. Where is the concept of zero first advocated and how did one reach

to the concept of infinity? We see the wordsशून्य (void) and असंख्य (innumerable).

  

You may write to me privately or post your views here.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
