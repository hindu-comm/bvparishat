Dear Scholars,

  

Why is the decimal number system written from right to left and not from left to right?

  

In vernacular languages in India numerals are counted with units first and then the tens as ('ekvis' 'bavis' in Marathi) however in English they are counted tens first (as twenty one, twenty two,etc.) How does it reflect on the evolution of writing the decimal numeral system and also on the origin of the sign '0' for Zero or Shunya.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
