Dear Subrahmanianji,

Thanks for the response.

But are these codifications mandatory or suggestive?

To my belief these are suggestions to individuals to make themselves better human beings. In this sense these codifications can be said to be secular. Further non compliance to these does not draw social reprimand or punishment.



Buddhism and Jainism to my understanding is the first shift from a secular framework to an order which were later emulated by various religions. 

My question is, in this sense was performance of yajna ever controlled by an order.

With regards,  

Achyut Karve.
