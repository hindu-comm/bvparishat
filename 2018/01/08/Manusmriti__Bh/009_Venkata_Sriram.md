...........

codification for human behaviour in Vedic texts.

.......

  

You have asked the question to cite from vedic texts and those have been referred....

  

Now, what do you want ? shrutis are the breath of Ishwara so the vidhi-s and nishedha-s are the commands of Ishwara and non-performance invokes pratyavAya dosha. It is upto oneself to follow or not follow.
If followed, leads one to abhyudaya and chitta shuddhi.

  

..............

Further non compliance to these does not draw social reprimand or punishment.  

.......

  

Smriti-s follow shruti. So, there are ample punishments prescribed for non-compliance. However, these smriti-s have evolved from time to time. The punishments that were applicable in ages of yore is not / may not be applicable to current circumstances.

  

........

My question is, in this sense was performance of yajna ever controlled by an order.

.......

  

Need further clarity on the above question.

  

rgs,

sriram
