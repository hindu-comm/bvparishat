Dear Venkata Shriramji,

  

........

My question is, in this sense was performance of yajna ever controlled by an order.

.......

  

Need further clarity on the above question.  

  

It is important to understand that an order is an organisation which not only prescribes behaviour but also renders justice.

  

Was this true regarding performance of yajna by a yajnik?

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
