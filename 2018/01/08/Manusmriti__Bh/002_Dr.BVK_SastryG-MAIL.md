On \< Can the Manusmriti be interpreted as a continuation of Vedic thought? > and justification quote \<‘ यद्वै किञ्च मनुरवदत्तद्भेषजम्’ (तै. सं. २। २। १०। २) इति \> .



1. This precisely is the point where ‘Historicity’ clashes with ‘ Tradition’ ! and framework of ‘ Understanding Vedic Samskruth Word/Term’ becomes challenging ! 

Gita points to such a scenario and uses a specific term **\< ****श्रुतिविप्रतिपन्ना** ते यदा स्थास्यति निश्चला । समाधावचला **बुद्धि**स्तदा योगमवाप्स्यसि ॥२-५३॥ **Shrutivipratipanna buddhi** ॥ 2-53 ॥ \> 



2. a) The position on \< Manusmriti as a continuation of Vedic Thought> is fine. But ‘ Justifying ‘ Manu’s authority from ‘ Veda’ ??



 b) This position makes ‘ Manu (smriti) Primary’ and ‘Shruti’ to be ‘ secondary’ later than Manu ! as the quoted text has
an endorsement on Manus words as ‘Smriti’ ? 

 The logical problem that arises here is : How Can a current text endorse a future writer ? If the answer is ‘Darshana/ Alaukika / Ateendriya’, then which of several ‘ Manus ’ is referred in the quoted smriti ? 

 It is well documented that there are different Manu’s and they have teir rulership –domains classified where there rule is implemented’ Bharatavarsha – Bharat khanda now is under ‘ Vaivasvata Manvantara’

 ; where the ‘Vaivasvata Manu’ is post ‘Vedas’ and far predates Bhagavad- Gita and current compiler of Manu smriti.



Acharya Shankars quote is separated from Manu and TS . From Acharya Shankara’s context of writing , there is no reason to make any ‘ identity equation’ between ‘Manu’ referred to in TS and Manu associated with Smriti’ - a document which we are having as ‘ Manusmriti’.



According to the currently available text narrative, the current
‘Manusmriti’ itself is a several rounds abridged narrative of
‘Dharma discourse recollection’ edited from some ‘lost in time’
ancient larger source which could be ‘ Maanva Dharma Shaastra / Sutra / Smriti..’ ! The same passage presents \< वेदविरुद्धत्वं वेदानुसारिमनुवचनविरुद्धत्वं \> that ‘ Manu follows Veda’.
