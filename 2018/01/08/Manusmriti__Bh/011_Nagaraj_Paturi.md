Social order does not control technological actions.

  

Yajna is a technological actions. Technological actions have a technological order.

  

Yajna has a technological order, highly elaborate, meticulously systematised, well preserved through oral tradition, partially documented in the written tradition, with a good number of professionals still skilled in the execution of it.

  

There is a social order aspect of technological practices, including rules that only well trained professions should execute the practice.

  

In the social order of both the Varna and caste systems, training in knowledge and skill areas was a family activity, children getting trained right from their early childhood by the senior family members or the senior members of their varna or caste.

  

Yajna performances have been part of this social order.
