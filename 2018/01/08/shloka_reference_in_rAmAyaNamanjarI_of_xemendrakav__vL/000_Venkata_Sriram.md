Namaste,

  

Dr.V.Raghavan refers to a shloka fromरामायणमञ्जरी in his work "Studies on Ramayana". The shloka runs as:

  

'सर्वे दुःखमयं तदस्तु भवतां श्लाघ्यो विवेकोदयः'  

  

The meaning runs as 'It is all sorrow; may it lead you to blessed vairagya and viveka".

  

I need the exact reference section where it has been used in रामायणमञ्जरी.  

  

Thanking you in advance....

  

rgs,

sriram
