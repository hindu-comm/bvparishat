The verse is cited in *Vyāsa Bhāṣya* on *Yoga Sūtra* 1.47.

A *hi* in the beginning of the 2nd *pāda* would have made the verse look "normal".

  

The verse occurs in the *Mahābhārata* twice with slight variations:

  

12.17.20

*prajñā-prāsādam āruhya aśocaṇ śocato janān/*

*jagatīsthān ivādristho manda-buddhṇn avekṣate//*

  

12.151.11

has the same except the last *pāda*:

*prajñayā pratipatsyati.*

*  
*

The first *pāda* occurs in Vana-parvan also.

  

The same idea with similar wordings occurs in

*Dhamma-pada* 2.28 (in Pāli)
