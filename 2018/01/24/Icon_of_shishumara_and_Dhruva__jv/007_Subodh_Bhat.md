This icon if I am not mistaken is one amongst the hundreds of 'Archa Pratimas' worshipped in Uttaradi Mutt. I am basing my assumption on the cover-design of a book called 'श्रीकृष्णामृतमहारणवः' by Bhagavtpada Madhvacharya, published by Uttaradi Mutt, which has this Photo. Shimshumara rupa is the Scorpion shaped rupa of Vishnu which is the controller of Dhruva-Loka.
