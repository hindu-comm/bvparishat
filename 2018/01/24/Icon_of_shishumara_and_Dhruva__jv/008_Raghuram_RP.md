there is a misconception that shimshumara rupa is scorpion, please look at the deity closely, it has scales on its body. Scorpions do not have scales on their body.  

It is actually Gangetic Dolphin  

Refer to the Zoological dictionaries by Dr. Tirumalacharya. Here he quotes RV and TS as proof for it (but actual verses not given). He has says "shimshum marayati iti shimshumaraha". This books is treat for zoologists who also know samskrita knowledge. Its a great book and I salute him for the work  

I am trying to find what is the meaning of shimshum. learned people please help here.
