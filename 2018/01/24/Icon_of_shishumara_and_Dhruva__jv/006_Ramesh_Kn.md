Respected Sri.RN.Iyengar ji,

  

Sorry for the late reply...

As I have not opted for email updates I did not know about this thread..

Thanks to Dr.Nagaraj Paturi ji for prompting me personally..

This is a panca loka vigraha worshipped in madhwa households in daily puja it seems..

Tried to contact Bryan Hill / Phillip hill , no replies as he has taken sanyas and not interested in worldly matters and email..

  

namaskarams
