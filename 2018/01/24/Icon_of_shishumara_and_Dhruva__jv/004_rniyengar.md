Dear Sri Sunil,

Thanks for this information. It is very interesting and useful. I received a private mail also with similar information about the wide prevalence of this icon in the Madhwa-sampradaaya. I received a photo of a pooja performance in the Uttaraadi Mutt also. The Russian blog mentions about an icon sculpted out of coral. The icon in the Uttaradi Mutt seems to be a metal casting. The legends about Dhruva (Maharaja) etc may differ from region to region and PuraNa to PuraaNa. But the Upaasana of Shishumaara with Dhruva at the tail-end is reminiscent of the original Tai. AraNyaka mantra. The observation of the Shishumaara constellation must have created a deep spiritual and mystical impression on the Hindu mind c 3000 BC to have preserved an unbroken tradition to the present day albeit with turns and twists.

Thanks

RN Iyengar
