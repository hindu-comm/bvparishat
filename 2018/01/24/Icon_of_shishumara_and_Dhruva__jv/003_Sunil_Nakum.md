Namaskar,  
  

FYI, Google provides a way to [Search by Image](https://www.google.com/intl/es419/insidesearch/features/images/searchbyimage.html), you may give it a try.  
  

I've tried it and most results have same image without any reference to origin, e.g.  

<https://divyakataksham.wordpress.com/tag/lord-vishnu-vishnu-shloka-47/>

  

The following link from a book website shows very similar image. I guess either this image is taken from the same source (vigraha) of which that blog post image was taken, or they both are same image with some digital modification.

What may interest you could be this link in Russian. This website has almost the same image as you posted, but since it mostly contains the self-taken pictures in and around the temples, probability is more to get to the root of it.  

  

<http://gadadhara.ru/vadiradzha/>

  

Here is the translation of the paragraph adjoining the image, from Russian to English!  

  

> This other of the sacred relics It depicts the Lord, manifested above > the head in the form of a starry sky. This is the name of Shishumara. > The tail of the Lord here symbolically depicts the Milky Way and the > Polar Star on which Dhruva Maharaja, with the folded hands, is seated, > the great devotee of Lord Vishnu. The Bolstess is sculpted from a > single piece of red coral

  

Best Luck.  

  

Dhanyoshmi,  

Sunil
