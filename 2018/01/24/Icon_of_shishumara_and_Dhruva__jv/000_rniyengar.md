Dear Sri KN Ramesh & Dear Members;

  

I found the attached image at<http://knramesh.blogspot.in/2012/08/>

  

Please let me know where this icon is located. Is it worshiped in any temple or household?  

It appears to be a pancha-loha casting. Or is it just a computer animation? Please provide details.

  

Regards

RN Iyengar
