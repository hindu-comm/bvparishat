Dear Paturiji,

  

I can sympathize with your concerns but the subjects are so interconnected that it is very difficult to repond under different heads.

As also in the course of the debate new view points emerge.

For example on the question of jati, Akash is not a jati viewed separately. However when we think of the five elements i.e. fire, earth, sky, water and air Akash can be considered as jati. Thus jati can only be appreciated within a frame of reference. It cannot be considered open-endedly.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
