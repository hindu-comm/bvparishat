Ashokji,

I had scanned Bhatrhari before. He is naturally going into the "word" view of it.

He would go to guNa and bhAva. I will check again.

My effort is to locate any text that would claim discovery of the cyclic nature of life

and possibly extrapolate to the universe.- creation, dissolution etc.

Human heart beat is possibly not too difficult to detect. The competing process

could be the night fall and waiting for the daylight. The declaration of rhythm

may be hidden in any story in the Vedas (which I have not read carefully).

Rta as an order might hinge upon the idea of repetition and hence a perpetual field

of repetitive binary events. Counting then becomes an application.

Best regards,

Bijoy
