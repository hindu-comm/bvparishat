Dear Shri Rishi Mahoday,

  

“साध्यवत्प्रतियोगिकान्योन्याभावासामानाधि- करण्यम् ।" This is from the vyApti-panchaka - one of the five definitions of vyApti taken up by Gangesha for refutation. It is not used for defining pratiyogitA. In simple terms, this attempts to define the condition for vyApti to exist between the hetu and the sAdhya to be used in an inference (anumAna). In the inference, "the mountain has fire, due to the smoke" (parvato vahnimAn dhUmAt), fire is the sAdhya (what is to be inferred), smoke is the hetu, and mountain is the pakSha. For an inference to be made possible, there must exist a vyApti relation between the sAdhya and the hetu, or in other words the sAdhya must "pervade" the hetu. The definition of vyApti that you have cited says“साध्यवत्प्रतियोगिकान्योन्याभावासामानाधि- करण्यम् ।". Let us analyze this. sAdhyavatpratiyogika-anyonya-abhAva means the mutual absence (anyonya-abhAva) which has the locus of the sAdhya (sAdhyavat)
as the pratiyogi. The hetu (smoke, for example) must not have the same locus (samAnAdhikaraNa) as this anyonya-abhAva. What does this mean? The hetu must not occur in a locus that is different from the locus in which the sAdhya (fire) occurs.हेतौ साध्यवत्-प्रतियोगिक-अन्योन्याभाव-अधिकरण-निरूपित-वृत्तित्त्व-अभाव इत्यर्थः। This definition of vyApti is proved to be defective where the sAdhya (fire) occurs in more than one distinct locus. For example, fire can occur not only on a mountain, but also in a kitchen (mahAnasa). The kitchen as a locus of fire is different from the mountain. Yet, the hetu, smoke can occur both on the mountain and in the kitchen and an inference of fire can be drawn both in the kitchen and on the mountain.
