Dear Mishraji,

  

I think we need to interpret kshana as time tending to Zero which in physics is defined as instantaneous which is not the case with blinking of the eye. The Kshana concept can also be viewed from the point of view of sphota.

  

Humans are conditioned by the phenomenon of persistence of vision. This sets limits on the ability of humans to separate two events discretely in time. This is also true with listening. If a beat is repeated more than twenty times a second the human ear appreciates it as a frequency instead of as being separate or discreet beats.

  

This said the appreciation of time in Vedic language is conspicuous.



The fact that a long vowel is counted equal to the sum of two short vowels is not to be found in any other language. This throws light on the ability of humans to count time through successive speech sounds.
What is more facinating is parts are in halfs and in one eighths. The presence of a pluta vowel affords counting in three's. The Kshana is 1/2 raised to 18th part of a matra or of a laghu vowel.

  

In the case of astronomy we get parts in terms of one thirds and half.
For example a right angle is 90°. An isosceles right angle triangle has the other two angles equal to 45°. In the case of an equilateral triangle each of the angles is equal to 60°. These measures can in no way be represented in terms of powers.

  

Thus we see that the Kshana was arrived as parts of a matra by the power of two just as the decimal number system is arrived by the power of 10.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
