The word pratiyogika is used in the context of anyonya-abhAva, mutual absence. If X is different from Y, we say there is anyonya-abhAva (or bheda) between them. X is called pratiyogin and the other, Y, is called anuyogin. Hence, X-pratiyogika-bheda is that bheda (difference) which has X as pratiyogin. X-pratiyogika-bheda-abhAva would then mean the absence of difference that has X as pratiyogin. So svAshraya-pratiyogika-bheda is karmadhAraya samAsa, not shaShThI-tatpuruSha.
