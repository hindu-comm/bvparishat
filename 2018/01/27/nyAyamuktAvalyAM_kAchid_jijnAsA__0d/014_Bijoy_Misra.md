Paturiji,

It is a good orientation. In math, p and q are assumed to be known.

What we check if we can derive p and q from the basic analog observation.

There must be a conceptual idea to go to a "unit" by segmenting the analog space.

I am looking for any analytic literature that might discuss segmentation.

Jainas bring in "soul" but I have not seen the source definition.

Curious to learn what ideas were discussed.

Best regards,

Bijoy
