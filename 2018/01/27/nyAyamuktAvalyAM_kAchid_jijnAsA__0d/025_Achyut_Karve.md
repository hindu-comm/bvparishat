Dear Scholars,

  

It happened one day that I asked my brother who is good in maths what is '1'. He replied that it was a number. On further questioning he argued can we not see say one pot or some other object of the sort say a cow or the even the sky. This answer of his to my mind was not satisfactory.
Hence I ruminated for somewhile and the answer which served my purpose was that '1' stands for a whole. A whole is no object but a sense and hence stands the test of being a universal concept to man. In short '1' is the mathematical representation of the sense of a whole not of the whole (object).

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
