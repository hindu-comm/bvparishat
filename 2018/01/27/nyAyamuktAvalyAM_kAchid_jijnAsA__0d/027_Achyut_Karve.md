Dear Scholars,

  

On the question of one and many Patanjali in his Mahabharata on the question of 18 añ's says (Reference can be provided by members) though the akash (sky) is one its parts are many. There can be many parts but not many ones. Two, three, four, five are not many wholes because each of the parts of a number (natural numbers) is itself a whole as also the wholes put together do not form a single whole. 

  

The invocation of the Chandyoga Upanishad is very illustrative.

  

All this if WHOLE means 'Purna'.

  

With Regards,

Achyut Karve.
