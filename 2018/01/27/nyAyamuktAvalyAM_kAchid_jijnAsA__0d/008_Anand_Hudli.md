These concepts, jAti and bheda, are treated differently by different schools such as nyAya, mImAmsA and vedAnta. For instance, the (advaita) Vedanta school does not recognize any jAti to be even real, besides sattA (existence). And bheda (difference) is also treated as not real. So it is hard to come up with a mathematical definition when there is no universal agreement over what jAti or bheda means. The nyAya concept of jAti is prompted by the principle of lAghava to explain uniform and repeated experience. When one sees a cow, for example, and later sees another cow, there is a uniform perceptual experience. In order to explain this uniform experience the concept of jAti, cowness is introduced. Udayanacharya laid down six factors that rule out the formation of a jAti, known as bAdhakas, as mentioned in the first post above. For more information, please consult the excellently written book on Indian logic by Mahamahopadhyaya Kuppuswami Sastri:

The discussion on sAmAnya (jAti) occurs between pages 18 and 37.
