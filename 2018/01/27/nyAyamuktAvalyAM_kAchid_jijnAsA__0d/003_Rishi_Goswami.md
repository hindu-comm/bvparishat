Thankyou so much Anandji for the help.  
If Vyakti(aakash) is abhinna from jati(aakaashatvam), then it is vyaktyabheda dosh.  
What I'm failing to understand is the correct meaning of Pratiyogik over here. If we are to replace sva(aakaashatvam) with prithivitvam, what will be swashray-pratiyogik(prithvi-pratiyogik)?  
And, what is the samas in swashray-pratiyogik-bhed-abhaavah possibly? It's shashthi tatpurush or karmadharay?  
Thankyou  
Regards  
Rishi.
