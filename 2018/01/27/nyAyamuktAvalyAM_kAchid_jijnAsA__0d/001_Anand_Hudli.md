I don't have the dinakari commentary with me, but I can explain in simple terms, if that helps. eka-vyakti-mAtra-vRttistu na jAtiH. There cannot be a jAti consisting of just one individual. AkAshatva cannot be a jAti, because the Ashraya of AkAshatva, i.e. AkAsha, is a single individual and not many. As per nyAya, AkAshatva is supposed to inhere in AkAsha which is its locus or substratum (Ashraya). What the further explanation below seems to be saying is that there is an absence (abhAva) of difference (bheda) between svAshraya (AkAsha in this case) and another entity which is also the Ashraya for AkAshatva. If X has Akashatva, then X cannot be different from AkAsha. Hence, vyakti-abheda.
