Namaste Sri Rishi mahodaya,

  

The term pratiyogi has been used in different ways.You can refer to nyAyakosha for the various definitions of pratiyogitA (virodhitvam, vittivedyatvam etc).

  

Simply put, it can refer to abhAvIya pratiyogi or sAmsargika pratiyogi (absential counterpositive, or relational adjunct).

  

When it comes to absence, the abhAva/bheda pratiyogi is the counter-positive, ie the thing that is absent / different. When it comes to relation like sAdrishyam or AdhAra-Adheya (chandravat mukham or ghaTavat bhUtalam), the qualifier (prakAra) in the relation (samsarga) is the pratiyogi.

  

Regards,

Venkatraghavan
