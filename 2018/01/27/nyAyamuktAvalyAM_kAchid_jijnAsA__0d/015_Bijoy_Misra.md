I did find the conceptual definition of "infinity" in Jaina literature,

it's Prakrit text called Ganitanuyoga, compiled from the previous texts.

They talk about a massive "loka" universe, which is large, but finite.

Outside of it, there is "aloka" universe which has no end, "ananta."

Apparentlly the concept goes back to Mahavir or even before him.

A finite quantity can be innumerable, "asankheya", but not "ananta".

There are more nuances.

  

shUnya is possibly a Buddhist concept, but I have not found the text yet.

Here we have to distinguish between "non-existence" and "absence of

existence". I do not know how they would go. I am looking.
