Dear friends,

  

The repetitive nature of an action leads to counting. We count steps, or we count the blinks.

Steps measure space, blinks measure time. That is not the same as counting cows.

Here body function, we assume repetition. Day and night or seasons are astronomical repetitions.

Otherwise we have an application of counting, originally created to measure space or time.

  

So when we talk of numbers mathematically, we assert an absolute unit in our frame. The

mathematical operations are made with the base unit. We have binary, octal, decimal etc.

In Indian system, the repeatable space unit has been called an Angula, the average width

of a human finger. The averaging is a mathematical concept, where the objects have to be

declared the same.

  

I see the Jaina literature that champions measurements. I am looking for the source

document that would suggest the definition of a unit through first declaring similarity

and then averaging. We have astronomical literature and geometry literature, but they

already assert the base units.  

  

There has to be a discovery somewhere on the repetitive nature of pulse beating, breathing

or the eye blinks, or the sky observations. The concept of mAtrA in chhanda might be connected.

  

Thank you.
