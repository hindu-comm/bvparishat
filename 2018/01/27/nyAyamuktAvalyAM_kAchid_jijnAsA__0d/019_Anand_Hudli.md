Dear Shri Mishraji,

  

In the words of Prof. Ingalls, "Perhaps the most interesting relational concept of the navya-naiyAyikas is that of paryapti." It is probably a link from Indian logic to natural numbers, and hence mathematics. The old theory (before navya-nyAya) held that number is a quality that inheres in its substratum. If there are two pots, two-ness as a quality inheres in each of the two pots. However, the new theory (of navya-nyAya) postulated a new relation called paryApti that allows two-ness to inhere not in each of the two pots but in the two pots taken as a pair, i.e. inhering in the collection rather than in each individual member of a set. paryaptishca ayameko ghaTa imau dvau iti pratIti-sAkShikaH. The advantage of paryApti is that the substrata of two-ness, three-ness, etc. now become mutually exclusive, while in the old theory they were not. To clarify, two-ness inheres in a collection of two pots (and other collections of two objects), but not in each pot, three-ness in a collection of three pots, etc.

  

Ingalls' highly useful book for those interested in navya-nyAya is available here:

<https://www.amazon.com/Materials-Study-Navya-Nyaya-D-H-H-Ingalls/dp/8120803841>

  

The discussion on paryApti occurs on page 76. I could not find a free download of this book.

  

Anand
