।।श्रीहरि:।।  
  
Mahoday Shree Venkatraghavanji,  
Thankyou very much for such an easy explanation of the query.  
  
Thankyou very much Mahoday Shree Aanand Hudi ji also for easily explaining Aakashatvam and Jaati badhak.  
  
A ghat is different from another Ghat. Ghat can have svashray-pratiyogik-bhed. But Aakash being only 1, cannot have svashray-pratiyogik-bhed. So Aakashatvam is not a jaati. I very well understood this point by your(Venkatraghavanji's) wonderful explanation. I am grateful for that.  
  
What I'm not able to grasp is the exact definition Pratiyogi. If anything has Abhaav, it's pratiyogi. This is what I've understood. I maybe wrong. Ghat has svashray-pratiyogik-bhed, that means ghat has svashray(ghat, say shyam ghat)-pratiyogik(anya-ghat, say rakt ghat)-bhed in it. Shyam ghat has raktghat-pratiyogik-bhed. But Aakash doesn't have svashray-pratiyogik-bhed. If this is the correct definition of pratiyogi, How is ghat pratiyogi of sanyog in "घटवद् भूतलम्" .  
\*\*"घटवद्भूतलमित्यादौ संयोगस्य घटः प्रतियोगी भूतलमनुयोगि। चन्द्रतुल्यमुखमित्यादौ सादृश्यस्य चन्द्रः प्रतियोगी मुख-मनुयोगि।"\*\*  
I searched dictionary, Kalpadrum. The definition of Pratiyogi is something like this, \*“साध्यवत्प्रतियोगिकान्योन्याभावासामानाधि- करण्यम् ।"\*  
Where,  
Sadhya is ghat? Sadhyavat= Ghatavat. Pratiyogikanyonyabhav=? ShyamaGhat-RaktaGhata-Bhed probably.  
Samanadhikaranyam= Paksh, Bhootalam? What Pratiyogi exactly means is not clear to me.  
  
Thankyou  
Regards  
Rishi.
