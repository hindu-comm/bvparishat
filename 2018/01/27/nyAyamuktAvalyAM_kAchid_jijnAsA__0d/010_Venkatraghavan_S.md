Namaste Rishi mahodaya,

  

In addition to Sri Anand Hudli ji's explanation:

  

स्वाश्रयनिष्ठ = आकाश निष्ठ,स्वाश्रयप्रतियोगिकभेदाभाव: = आकाशप्रतियोगिकभेदाभाव:= आकाशे आकाशप्रतियोगिकभेद: नास्ति \|किन्तु घटे घटप्रतियोगिकभेद: अस्ति \| Here,

स्वाश्रयप्रतियोगिकभेद: = having theस्वाश्रयas theभेदप्रतियोगि.  

  

In your anvaya, you need to takeस्वाश्रयनिष्ठnot asआकाशत्व- you have already takenस्वasआकाशत्व(if that was the case, there would be no need to addआश्रयनिष्ठ). Thus,स्वाश्रयनिष्ठrefersto the absence of aभेदdharma colocated withस्व, which has theस्वाश्रयas the bheda pratiyogi. This is referred to in the second part of the lakshaNa,स्वाश्रयप्रतियोगिकभेद:.

  

Put together this means - The absence of a difference colocated with an attribute, which has the attribute's locus as the counterpositive of the difference. A difference with an object can be located in that object only if that object is an individual of a species - for example, a man A is different from man B. Thus difference from man (A) can be located in man (B).

  

However, that is not possible with AkAsha. If you take sva = AkAshatva, svAshraya (=AkAsha) pratiyogika bheda dharma is absent in the svAshraya (AkAsha) because AkAsha is not different from itself, nor is there another AkAsha which is different from this one. However, if you take sva = ghaTatva, ghaTatva pratiyogika bheda dharma is present in ghaTa, because any one pot is different from any other of the same species.



Thus ghaTatva jAti can exist for pots, but AkAshatva jAti cannot exist for AkAsha.

  

Regards,

Venkatraghavan
