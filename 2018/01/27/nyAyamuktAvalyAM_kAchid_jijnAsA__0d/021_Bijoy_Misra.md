Dear Shri Anand,

I knew Prof Ingalls, he was here. "ghata" is a word. In such logic, a word is an object.

I do not want to belabor the point. Do think objectively what a mathematical idea is

and how it might develop. Classification is a visual phenomenon, multiplication is

conceptual. Let me know a text that would discuss mathematical ideas of counting,

measuring, comparing and extrapolating.

Thank you.
