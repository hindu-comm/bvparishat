"claim" is the wrong verb. We only deduce from hints. These discoveries would be

so empirical that the person may not know the future implication.

Possibly a search on Rta in the Vedas would be a start. I have not done it.

The story could be pre-vedic. It may be cited as a legend.

Jaina literature that I am reading now talks about Rahu eating up the moon.

So they invoke good and bad. This invocation could be more primitive than

day and night, since the same moon does not show up the next night.

  

These are some random thoughts.

I would love if anyone has command on the Vedic literature to look for the topic.  

I will come to it in May.
