\> My effort is to locate any text that would claim discovery of the cyclic nature of life.

  

---- Claiming discoveries is a modern /western tendency rooted in the documentation for historicising /chronicling purpose in general and the benefits accrued from the copyright and credits from the invention /discovery in particular.

  

Such claims are very rare and almost impossible to find in the ancient Indian texts.
