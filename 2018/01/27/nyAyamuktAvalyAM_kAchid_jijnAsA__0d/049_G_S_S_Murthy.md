Apropos Achyut Karveji's noting, " The fact that a long vowel is counted equal to the sum of two short vowels is not to be found in any other language.", may I add the following:

In Sanskrit prosody a laghu is treated as a guru if it is followed by a samyuktaakshara. This is a very insightful discovery. Whether Pingala discovered it or it is a pre-pingalaconcept I would like to know. I think it is a very fertile area for further research.

Sorryif my noting has veered off the course.

Regards,

Murthy
