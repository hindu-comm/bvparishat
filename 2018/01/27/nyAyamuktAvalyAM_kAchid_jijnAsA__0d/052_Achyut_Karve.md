Dear Scholars,

  

The compilation of the Vedas is itself a numerical exercise. The division of the Vedas into Ruchas, Suktas and mandala shows how Indians used numbers to compile literature instead of using titles.

  

Secondly the classification of Ruchas into Chanda's each of specific length again reflects the deep sense of both numbers and time.

  

In old gramophone records it was a practice for an artist to announce his name at the end of the track. Was a similar practice in vogue in Vedic times to tell the number of Ruchas or cantos contained at the end?

  

It would be better if we head the thread as origin of numbers rather than as the origin of the number theory.

  

Can we think of how ancient humans would have compared two quantities as one being more or less than the other in the absence of number words like one, two three, etc.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
