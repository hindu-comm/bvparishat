Namaste Rishi mahodaya,

In addition to Sri Anand Hudli ji's explanation:

  

स्वाश्रयनिष्ठ = आकाश निष्ठ,स्वाश्रयप्रतियोगिकभेदाभाव: = आकाशप्रतियोगिकभेदाभाव:= आकाशे आकाशप्रतियोगिकभेद: नास्ति \|किन्तु घटे घटप्रतियोगिक भेद: अस्ति \|

स्वाश्रयप्रतियोगिकभेद: = having the svAshraya as the bheda pratiyogi  

  

AkAsha is not the bheda pratiyogi of an AkAshatva niShTha vastu (AkAsha). Whereas a pot is the bheda pratiyogi of another ghaTatva niShTha vastu = another pot. To explain, a pot is different from other pots, but space is not different from other spaces. Thus jAti can exist for the former, but not the latter.

  

Regards,

Venkatraghavan
