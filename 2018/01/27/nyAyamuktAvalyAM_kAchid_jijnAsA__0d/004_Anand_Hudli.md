An individual is an instance of a class (jAti) or it could be one-of-a-kind entity, example AkAsha. An object instantiates the properties of the class. For example, if class cow is defined as "having horns, a dewlap, etc", a particular cow would be an instance with its specific horns, specific dewlap, etc.
