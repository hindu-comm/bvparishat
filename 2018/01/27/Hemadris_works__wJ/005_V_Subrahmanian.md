Thank you Madhva ji, for the reference. I could view the required pages in the Part 1. From p.79 onward there is a discussion on the identity of Hemadri as the author of the Chaturvarga Chintamani and the present work on commentary of the Raghuvamsha. The editor opines that the two are different entities, separated by about three centuries. The discussion considers several pieces of evidences to so conclude.
