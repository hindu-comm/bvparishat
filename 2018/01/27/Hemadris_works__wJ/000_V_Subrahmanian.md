On p.46 of the above pdf we have:  

  

//Hemadri is well known as the author.of the Caturvargacintamani comprising five parts, viz., (I) Vratakhanda (2) Danakhanda, (3) Tirthakhanda (4) Moksakhanda and (5) Paarisesakhanda. Of these the third and fourth khandas have not yet come to light. Hemadri's work is held in great esteem and has been drawn upon by later writers on Dharmasastra. Hemadri wrote on other subjects as well. He is the author of a commentary on Saunaka's Pranavakalpa and also of a Sraddhakalpa, in which he follows Katyayana. His Ayurvedarasayana, a commentary on Vagbhata's Astangahrdaya, and Kaivalyadipika, a gloss on Bopadeva's Muktaphala are also well known. 57//

  

  

Is anyone aware of the availability of the works (3) Tirthakhanda (4) Moksakhanda stated above as 'not available?'

  

Also, is the 'Kaivalyadipika, a gloss on Bopadeva's Muktaphala ' available for download?

  

Are there any other works of Hemadri other than the Chaturvarga Chintamani available now?

  

Thanks and warm regards
