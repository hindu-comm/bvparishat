hemadri means hema+adri ( mount of gold) , this interpretation i listen since my childhood in the praayaschitta reference and during discussion about shraadhdha praayaschittam i was told by a retired sanskrit teacher that hemadri is vedic lady sage, this mail postings mention hemadri - a male charecter,, kindly helo me to clean my mind- hemadri is male or female?

regards,
