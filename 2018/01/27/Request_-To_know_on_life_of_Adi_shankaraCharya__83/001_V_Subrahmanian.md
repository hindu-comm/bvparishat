What we know of the debate is from the account in the Madhaviya Shankara Digvijaya. Therein, sarga 8 deals with this debate in about 136 verses. The conversation involving philosophical questions and answers is contained therein. The next sarga, 9, also could be of interest where the debate with Saraswati, wife of Mandana Misra is described. You can download the pdf of the book in Sanskrit with commentary here:

An English rendering of the Digvijaya, though not corresponding with the Chapter numbers with the original, is attached herewith.
