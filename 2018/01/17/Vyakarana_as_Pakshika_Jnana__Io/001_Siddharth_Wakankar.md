My Sanskrit Grammar Teacher,Prof.M.V.Mahashabde of Mumbai used to revise the Ashtaadhyayee everyday saying it was his daily practice since he was a Vyaakaranaacharya from Varanasi.Till his death inJanuary

1995,he did it regularly fearing that he may forget it.As is well.known,if we lose touch with a subject for a long time,we may forget it,esp.Vyakarana or any language.
