The following may not be exactly related to this discussion: At the 'shraddhanjali' meeting of late Vidwan MM Sri N.Ranganatha Sharma, someone said, as reported by his daughter: He had told her: If I do not seem to remember Vyakarana, know that my end is nearing. And it came true that he did not respond cogently to something about the subject she asked him. The second or the third day after this he passed away.
