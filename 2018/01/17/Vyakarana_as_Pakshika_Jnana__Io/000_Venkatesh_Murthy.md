Namaste

  

In one Vyakarana videos the Lecturer has said Vyakarana is a Pakshika Jnana meaning the Vaiyakarana must be in touch with Vyakarana every Paksha or 15 days. If he is out of touch for more than 15 days he will forget it. He must be practicing it every 15 days to keep in touch.

  

I would like to know the personal experiences of Vyakarana scholars here. Do you keep studying Vyakarana like Panini Sutrasat least once in 15 days to not forget it? What is your opinion?
