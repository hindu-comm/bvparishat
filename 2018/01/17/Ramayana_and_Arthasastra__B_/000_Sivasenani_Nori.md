In one of the other threads Dr. K. Aravinda Rao garu talked about the similarities between Ramayana and other works like Arthasastra etc. going to the extent of describing Ramayana as Lakshya and Arthasastra etc. as Lakshana.

  

My thoughts when noticing these similarities were that there was a corpus of common knowledge which is referred to in Ramayana, while it is expanded in the Sastra works. The kvacitsarga of Ramayana where Rama teaches Dandaniti to Bharata who has come to request Rama to return, is a sort of summary, whose full purport is the domain of works like Arthasastra. The Mandala theory of inter-State relationships, for instance, is mentioned in Ramayana but expanded at great length in the Arthasastra. Similarly the eighteen tirthas (administrative officers) are mentioned as a group in Ramayana but their titles, even though Bharata is advised to spy upon fifteen of them. We find their titles in Arthasastra and other works.

  

While one might be tempted to look at the Sastra works as a commentary, an explication, of Ramayana, I think the correct characterisation is that literature assumes that the reader is aware of the then state of Knowledge whereas Scientific works lay down and explain that Knowledge.
