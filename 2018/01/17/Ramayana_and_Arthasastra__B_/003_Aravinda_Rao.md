I may correct myself and clarify a bit. My idea is not that Ramayana is the lakshya grantha for political thought alone, it is much more than that. It is an analysis of the whole gamut of human experience and knowledge of the time. Thus it is an epic, a kavya, and a lakshya grantha for political science, aesthetics, bhakti principles and many such.

For illustration of politics, I quote from my own notes

  

"Politics of succession and political sagacity are brilliantly shown by Valmiki in the sargas 19 onwards. Tara is shown as a wise and politically shrewd woman. She addresses the monkey warriors who were running away. It was apparent to her that Rama wanted to install Sugriva as the king of Kishkindha. It is a foregone conclusion for her. She accepts the reality. Her very first words to the warriors indicate this (4-19-9). “Rama has killed Vali to make Sugriva the king. Why are you all running away?” Rama’s mission is only to kill Vali. There is no threat to other warriors, she implies. The warriors however do not understand this. “Go and save your son Angada. Let the fort be protected and let Angada be installed as the king”, they say. Tara knows that it is not possible. She says “when my husband, the king of warriors is fallen in battle, why do I need Angada or the kingdom (4-19-18)?” She thus avoids the issue of making Angada the king.

She approaches Vali, going past Rama, Lakshmana and Sugriva who were standing nearby. She falls on the body and cries. “You had taken away the wife of Sugriva. As a result, you have come to this end”, she says. Thinking about Angada she says, “This Angada was brought up with great love and affection. How will he serve under the angry Sugriva (4-20-17)?” She implies that Sugriva would surely be the king and Angada would be serving under him. She further says “Oh Sugriva! You got what you wanted. Your brother has been killed and you will get back your wife Ruma. Enjoy the kingdom without any threat (4-20-21).” Here too, the implication is that Sugriva would be the king. Tara declares that she would do *prāyopaveśa*, fasting unto death by the side of Vali (4-20-27).

Hanuman enters the scene now. He consoles and counsels Tara. Again Valmiki displays the technique of suggestion (*dhwani*). Hanuman says “every being enjoys or suffers the good and bad effects of the good and bad deeds done by them (4-21-2)”. The suggestion is that Vali met his end because of his own fault. “You have to take care of Angada and look after his welfare. Millions of warriors were commanded by Vali, but such a mighty hero is no more. Vali was judicious in his decisions, he used to display liberality (*sāma*), concession when needed (*dāna)* and forgiveness (*kṣamā)*.” This is a master stroke of irony. Hanuman knows that Vali was not judicious in punishing Sugriva. He did not display the liberality or forgiveness. The next suggestion is that Tara has to take over and decide the future course of things. He says “all these great warriors and also your son Angada are at your command. About the future course of actions, you please direct Sugriva and Angada who are both steeped in grief. Angada will rule under your guidance. Let the funeral ceremonies be done for Vali and let Angada be the king so that you can be in peace. (4-21-8,9,11)”. Hanuman has slowly tried to endear Sugriva to Tara and Angada. He was also testing waters by making a suggestion that Angada should be the king.

Tara seems to be equally shrewd. She says “I would prefer to be in the embrace of my fallen hero rather than caring for hundred sons like Angada”. What she implies is that she is now interested to ensure safety of Angada. She does not want Hanuman to think that Angada would be a rival for the kingdom. “And also, I have no control over the kingdom or on Angada. Sugriva is the only person capable now. Oh Hanuman! Do not entertain such ideas about Angada. His father (Sugriva) is the proper person to take care (4-21-13,14,15).” She suggests that Angada would pose no threat to Sugriva and that he would serve Sugriva like he would serve his own father. It is clear that Hanuman succeeded in getting the assurance he wanted."

In another instance,

Valmiki portrays Hanuman as a minister adept in the four-fold strategy of sama, dana, bheda and danda. Hanuman had earlier displayed his talent for *sama* in his first meeting with Rama. He praised Rama and Lakshmana for their royal features, told about his own king’s virtues, proposed friendship and promised a win-win situation. He used *dana* while talking to Tara when Tara rushed to see the dead Vali. He proposed that Angada can be made the king. This is a sort of political trial balloon to know Tara’s mind and Angada’s ability to claim the kingdom. Tara, politically shrewd as she is, sees the future clearly and hastily disagrees with this suggestion. In the present episode, when the prince Angada is dejected, and is trying to sow the seeds of dissidence in the minds of the chieftains, Hanuman is using the third strategy, bheda, division of the opponent’s team".

Similarly, for sringara rasa in sarga 28 of Kishkindha kanda

"On another occasion Rama sees the redness in the evening sky.* *The redness of the evening sky makes him think that the sky is wounded. The long line of clouds look like a strip of dressing cloth tied on the wound. In the middle it is looking red and it is looking white at the edges. The sky is not wounded; it is Rama’s heart which is wounded. This transference of his bleakness and gloom to the sky is a great visualization by Valmiki.

 सन्ध्यारागोत्थितैस्ताम्रैरन्तेष्वपि च पाण्डुभिः ।**

 स्निग्धैरभ्रपटच्छेदैर्बद्धव्रणमिवाम्बरम् ।। (28-5)**

 This image of wounded sky is quite modern, if we can say. In his poem “The Love Song of Alfred Prufrock”, T.S.Eliot describes the evening –

“Let us go then you and I,

When the evening is spread out against the sky

Like a patient etherized upon a table”. 

Here too, the protagonist is gloomy, like Rama in our present text.

* *On another day Rama sees the evening sky. There is also warmth in the air and white clouds are seen in the sky. The sky with its white clouds looked like a person pale with the grief of separation from his lover. The redness is like the paste of sandal wood applied on a person to reduce the grief and the warm breeze is makes Rama think that the sky is sighing (4-28-5). **

 On another day Rama is recalling Sita and sighing. Meanwhile he sees the mild warm breeze in the evening sky and notices the redness in the horizon. The sky with white clouds is seen as a lovelorn person who is pale. The redness in the horizon appears like a sandal paste applied on the sky in order to soothe the pangs of separation (4-28-6). In reality it is Rama who is suffering the pangs and who is sighing. It is a poetic commonplace to describe the estranged lover as though heated up in agony (*viraha-tāpa*). Such heat is reduced by applying coolants like sandal wood paste. In this verse Rama’s gloom is transferred to and visualized in nature.

The earth, radiating heat after receiving the first shower of rain appears as Sita heaving a hot sigh (28-7). It is Rama who is heaving a sigh that he sees it in the nature around him.

Rama sees a series of lightening followed by thunderous sounds in the sky. To him the sky appears like a person who is being lashed by a whip and who is groaning in pain. The lightening is like a whip lash and the thunder is like the groan of a person. It is his heart which is being internally whip-lashed.

 On another occasion he sees lightning in the dark cloud. This lightning looks like Sita who is helplessly wriggling in the hands of Ravana, unable to free herself. Here too, the human agony is visualized in nature. The same lightning was seen by the devotional poet Annamayya who described it as goddess Lakshmi on the bosom of the dark hued Vishnu (4-28-12).

I am sorry for the temptation of a long email. I was really excited teaching Ramayana.
