I guess so, Sir.

  

Here one difference may be noted. While the Mahabharata also has the equivalent of Ramayana's kacitsarga (Dhritarashtra teaching Yudhishthira, when the latter goes to forest to enquire after the well being of his mother Kunti, Gandhari and Dhritarashtra in their vaanaprastha), such summary treatments are somewhat unusual in the Mahabharata. When the Mahabharata takes up a topic, it tends to deal with it exhaustively - like a Sastra would do. Entire Arthasastra is said to be about 6,000 Slokas (actually only 5,300 odd Slokas are available in the printed book, but here a Sloka could be a measure of 32 aksharas), whereas the Santiparvan alone is some 14,000 Slokas plus (and it discusses Rajadharma, Apaddharma and Mokshadhara, but still the length is more like a Sastra and less like a passing reference) and then the Anusasanaparvan is another 8,000 or so Slokas (Daanadharma).

  

Mahabharata is an encyclopedia of ancient India. As it is said in Mahabharata itself:

  

धर्मे चार्थे च कामे च मोक्षे च भरतर्षभ। यदिहास्ति तदन्यत्र यन्नेहास्ति न तत्क्वचित्॥
