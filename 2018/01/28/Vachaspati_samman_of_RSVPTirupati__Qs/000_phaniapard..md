I am happy to inform the scholars of the group of the conferment of "Vachaspati" Samman on Dr. K. Aravinda Raoji IPS (Rtd), former DGP of Andhra Pradesh and a sanskrit scholar, by Rashtriya Samskrita Vidyapeetha, Tirupati.This will be conferred on him in the convocation of RSVP on the 5th of February,2018. Dr. Rao has rendered a great service to the language in the erstwhile AP and continues to spread awareness of sanskrit and upanishads in both states now too. He writes a column on these subjects in a popular telugu daily. He is a great source of strength to organisations like Samskrita Bharati and Surabharati Samiti. He is a major participant in Indian Indology conferences and a member of many national level institutions devoted to Samskritam and samskriti.

Hearty congratulations,Sir.
