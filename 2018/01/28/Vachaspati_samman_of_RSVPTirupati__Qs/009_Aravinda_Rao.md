Thank you all sirs, for the good wishes. I was myself surprised when it was informed. I will really try to deserve it.

I do like the autocorrelation, particularly from an avadhani.

My recent interest is in the Ramayana, which I am teaching in English on a local tv channel. About 180 episodes have been uploaded on the you tube too.
