I have answered this on Quora.

  

[https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-meaning-of-ganga/answer/Nityanand-Misra](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-meaning-of-ganga/answer/Nityanand-Misra)

  

**Quick answer**

The word ‘ganga’ has the following meanings:

1.  She who goes (i.e., flows) 2.  She who takes one to the feet of Lord 3.  She who is approached by those desirous of ‘moksha’ (liberation)

**Detailed answer**

**  
**

The word ‘ganga’ (IAST*gaṅgā*, गङ्गा) comes from the root ‘*gam*’ (“to go” or “to move”) as per the*Nirukta*, where Yāska offers the etymology of the word while commenting on the Rigvedic mantra*imaṃ me gaṅge yamune*(RV 10.75.5). Yāska says*gaṅgā gamanāt*(N 9.25), meaning that the word ‘gaṅgā’ comes from the root ‘gam’. Thus, the simple meaning is—

  

1\) “she who goes (flows)” is Ganga.

As per Paninian grammar also, the word comes from the root ‘gam’ by the Unadi Sutra ‘gan gamyadeh’ (IAST*gan gamyādeḥ*). The derivation is as follows:

*gam → gan gamyādeḥ (US 1.115) → gam gan → tasya lopaḥ (A 1.3.9) → gam ga → naścāpadāntasya jhali (A 8.3.24) → gaṃ ga → anusvārasya yayi parasavarṇaḥ (A 8.4.58) → gaṅ ga → gaṅga → ajādyataṣṭāp‌ (A 4.1.4) → gaṅga tāp → tasya lopaḥ (A 1.3.9) → gaṅga ā → akaḥ savarṇe dīrghaḥ (A 6.1.101) → gaṅgā*

This is how the word ‘ganga’ (IAST*gaṅgā*) comes from the root ‘gam’ (“to go” or “to move”). Commentaries and dictionaries explain the word as follows

  

2\) She who takes one to the feet of the Lord: This explanation is found in the ‘Shabdakalpadrumah’ (गमयति प्रापयति ज्ञापयति वा भगवत्पदं या)

  

3\) She who is approached by those desirous of ‘moksha’: This explanation is also found in the ‘Shabdakalpadrumah’ (गम्यते प्राप्यते ज्ञाप्यते मोक्षार्थिभिर्या)
