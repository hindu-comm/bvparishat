Dear friends,

  

Glad to know about this workshop on Dhvani. Good job. I appreciate organisers.

  

I have been teaching Dhvanyaloka text to our Masters students for last few years in JNU.

  

After returning from ICCR chair, again I have taken up this course and this semester I’m teaching this text to Mastets students, exceptionally through Sanakrit medium.

  

Every time I feel a new perspective and new inner meaning in the text. “Ananda -vardhanah kasya, Nasidananda-vardhanah”.

  

Thanking you,
