Vyaahritis are lokas. Lokas are visualised as objective vertically upward physical levels. They ( lokas ) are deeper and deeper planes/levels/degrees of inward subjective experience of one's own inner world too.

  

dhee -> dhiyah has/have all these levels. Correspondingly, Savitr and its prochodana of dhiyah too have all these levels. Correspondingly dhyaana indicated by dheemahi too has all these levels.

  

Doing Om (after learning the proper procedure -if available, through the Guru-), opens the saadhaka into this entire (all degrees of the ) inner world. Uttering vyaahritis is just identifying the places visited during the journey.
