Dear List members:

  

  

1\. Can you please explain the exoteric and esoteric significance of the vyahritis wrt the Gayatri mantra?

  

2\. Why is there a difference between different schools of Vedas in the 3rd vyahriti?

  

3\. Some say Svah and others use Suvah. And those who use Suvah use Ogum instead of Om as prefix for both Suvah and Sathyam.

  

Can some one elaborate?

  

4\. On page 132 of the book Aghora By Robert Svoboda, there is a claim made that the Gayatri mantra being repeated is not the real Gayatri and that it (the real gayatri) has been hidden. It is said that this supposedly real Gayatri is so potent that it has to be perfomed immersed in water due to the extreme heat created. I know the present mantra is the savitri, but can some one comment about this claim?

  

Thanks

  

Niranjan
