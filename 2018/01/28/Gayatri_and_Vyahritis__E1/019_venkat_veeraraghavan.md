Thanks for the paper Sir.

  

You write //The actual pronunciation ought to be like an elongated humming sound reverberating in a hollow space.//  

  

Is this like "Auumm"?

  

Is there anyone who can clarify the pronunciation wrt the Madhyandhina Shakha?

  

And any inputs on how and why these differences came about?

  

Normally the Augm is used only AFAIK in combination with Suvah and Sathyam.

I understand that Suvah is a different form of Svah, but doesnt it alter the tonal nature of the chandas etc? Although the chandas is not applied to the mahavyahrtis and only to the mantra proper. Any thoughts on this?

  

Thanks,

  

Venkat
