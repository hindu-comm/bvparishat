Dear Sri Siva Senaniji:

// ba for va, ja for ya, or la for ta, are used it is usually a case of there being a vikalpa, and different regions following different options. In the case of Anusvaara, Whitney (in his translation of the Taittiriya Pratisakhya) suggests that some (Vedic sakhas) view the anusvaara as the nasalisation of the preceding vowel, whereas others take anusvaara as a separate component (like in the Taittiriya sakha). All these matters were decided by Parishads of the learned in years gone by.//

  

the agnimILe vs agnimIDe should probably be added to this list.

  

What I dont understand is the Shabda or sound came first and the script to represent the said sound next. There must have been some standards on which the script was to be parsed in literature?

And considering the fact that we have had unbroken oral traditions passed on, this shouldn't be the contentious issue it has turned into.

  

  



  

//Regarding examples, we have many beyond oguM suvaH and oguM satyam. To cite from commonly recited sUktas: gaNapatiguM havaamahe, omIdaguM sarvam, oguM Somiti SastrANi SaguMsanti, teshaaguM sahasra yojaneva dhanvaani tanmasi, ekaviguMSatiSca me, trayoviguMSatiSca me, purusha evedaguM sarvam, ISvaraguM SaaSvataguM Sivamacyutam, ISvareeguM sarvabhootaanam taamihopahvaye Sriyam etc. //

  

When I said only case of Augm for Suvah and Satyam I meant within the Gayatri mantra.

I am still not clear of the purpose behind this special usage for Suvah and Satyam in YV.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
