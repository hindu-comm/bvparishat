\>On page 132 of the book Aghora By Robert Svoboda, there is a claim made that the Gayatri mantra being repeated is not the real Gayatri and that it (the real gayatri) has been hidden. It is said that this supposedly real Gayatri is so potent that it has to be perfomed immersed in water due to the extreme heat created. I know the present mantra is the savitri, but can some one comment about this claim?

  

---- This forum is not suitable for enquries because these "real Gayatri type claims are unverfiable.
