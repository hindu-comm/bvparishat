As you yourself observed Sir, the Vyahrutis are not a part of the mantra. So there is no impact on Chandas.

  

All pronunciation differences - be it in ऋ, ज्ञ or even श, ष and स -
that we see are a result of Siksha Sastra not being followed correctly. In some cases, especially where separate letters, like ba for va, ja for ya, or la for ta, are used it is usually a case of there being a vikalpa, and different regions following different options. In the case of Anusvaara, Whitney (in his translation of the Taittiriya Pratisakhya) suggests that some (Vedic sakhas) view the anusvaara as the nasalisation of the preceding vowel, whereas others take anusvaara as a separate component (like in the Taittiriya sakha). All these matters were decided by Parishads of the learned in years gone by.

  

Regarding examples, we have many beyond oguM suvaH and oguM satyam. To cite from commonly recited sUktas: gaNapatiguM havaamahe, omIdaguM sarvam, oguM Somiti SastrANi SaguMsanti, teshaaguM sahasra yojaneva dhanvaani tanmasi, ekaviguMSatiSca me, trayoviguMSatiSca me, purusha evedaguM sarvam, ISvaraguM SaaSvataguM Sivamacyutam, ISvareeguM sarvabhootaanam taamihopahvaye Sriyam etc.
