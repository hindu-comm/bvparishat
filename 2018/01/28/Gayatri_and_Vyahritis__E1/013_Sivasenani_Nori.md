Ogum (heard in the Taittiriya sakha) is Om with the anusvaara being elongated, on account of a savarNa like a sibilant or a hakaara following it (oguM suvaH, oguM satyam, saguMhitA etc.). In the maadhyandina sakha, the principle of elongation of the anusvaara is accepted but the pronunciation is different. The actual pronunciation ought to be like an elongated humming sound reverberating in a hollow space. There is a special symbol somewhat like the inversion of the Greek letter omega to represent it in Devanagari. In Telugu, it is being printed as ఓగ్ం (ओग्ं) but it should be noted that there is only an anusvaara following the vowel and that there is no consonant involved at all. If more information is required, there is a paper by Prof. M. Gopal Reddy in the journal of Dept of Sanskrit, around 2008. If you want, Sir, I can search for it and send it.

  

SuvaH and svaH are different forms of the same word like prithvI and prithivI.
