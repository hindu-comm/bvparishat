While I have the greatest respect possible for Vedic scholars (I can't over-emphasise this), there is a study of the hippocampi of London taxi drivers with similar results (<https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/london-taxi-memory/>). It seems that any act of massive memorisation will change the structure of the body in broadly similar lines.
