Dear Michel,

I recollect to have discussed this on BVP or attached a published paper by the same author in 2015. I am attaching the article once again. In fact I highlighted this work at the National Seminar on "Intellectual Traditions of ancient India" that I had organized at Jain Univ. in 2015. The context was of Raga Music and singing without scripts.

  

While the present news item is certainly interesting, I suspect the claimed effects may happen with other languages also. As you know the Tamil Divya-prabandhams (4000 verses each of 32 to 60 syllables approximately) are memorized by many Sri Vaishnavas (not necessarily Brahmins) in South India. On the other hand if the increase in grey matter is due to Vedic memorization, I wonder whether some particular sound (for example: the nasal sound -M) has a major role in this build up. Obviously this is a rich area of further research taking one to yet uncharted dizzy areas of Indian Heritage and Culture.

Best regards

Narayana
