Friends,

  

I don't see why it should be true for recitation memory, it could be purely the brain activation to engage

in the task. Musicians, artists, engineers, mathematicians could all possibly be demonstrated to have

more developed grey areas in different sections of the brain. What determines brain segmentation to

different tasks is still not solved.
