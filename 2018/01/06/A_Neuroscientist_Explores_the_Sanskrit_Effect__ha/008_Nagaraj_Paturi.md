James F Hartzell seems to have got unnecessarily researched about a well known common place phenomenon.

  

There has been a general impression particularly during modern times that blind 'rote', 'memorising' , 'taking by heart' is a dull, dumb, non-intellectual activity.

  

Youngsters are being brainwashed against 'memorising'.

  

Many posts in the thread saying 'nothing very special about Veda Pandits' are doing the good work of breaking the stereotype that Brahmins / Vedic scholars have some intellectually superior aspects.
