Dear Professor Iyengar,

  

  I completely agree with you. Whether something is the effect of a particular language or that of intensive training in memorization needs to be sorted out. I have suggested to James Hartzel that he should conduct similar studies of Buddhist monks in various parts of the world who memorize and recite vast amounts of texts, and musicians and other people who engage in intensive training. He agrees with me for the need to do such studies.
