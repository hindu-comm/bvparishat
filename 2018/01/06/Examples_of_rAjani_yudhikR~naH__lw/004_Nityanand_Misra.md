Thanks, Prof. Deshpande Ji. It would indeed be useful. My motivation was to see if the examples ofराजनि युधिकृञः (A 3.2.95)anywhere show कृद्योगा षष्ठी explicitly as तव राजकृत्वा or तव राजयुध्वा. While that should be the case as per the अष्टाध्यायी, would be good to see examples. *Prima facie*the verse inभट्टिकाव्य which hasबुद्धिपूर्वं ध्रुवन्न त्वा राजकृत्वा पिता खलम् (६.१३०) appears to have द्वितीया withराजकृत्वा asत्वा राजकृत्वा, but all major commentaries say that त्वा is to be taken with ध्रुवन् (ध्रु गतिस्थैर्ययोः) sinceराजकृत्वा would require aकृद्योगा षष्ठी. The commentaries give this reason to reject the readingबुद्धिपूर्वं ध्रुवं न त्वा राजकृत्वा पिता खलम्, as then there is no way to not take the anvaya ofत्वा with राजकृत्वा.

  

Unfortunately the other two examples also do not show theकृद्योगा षष्ठी explicitly. So we have a case where the theory (कर्तृकर्मणोः कृति) has no famous example forराजकृत्वा. The vigraha is the usual

राजानं कृत्वान् राजकृत्वा. But दशरथः त्वां राजानं कृत्वान् should be दशरथः तव राजकृत्वा as per commentaries onभट्टिकाव्य. This change in the case from accusative to genitive is interesting. I do not know if it is covered in any commentaries. Even for other examples of क्वनिप्, the usual vigraha is shown asपारं दृष्टवान् पारदृश्वा, I am not aware ofकृद्योगा षष्ठीexamples for words likeपारदृश्वा. Although a commentary on Champubharatam shows it [here](https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/पृष्ठम्:चम्पूभारतम्.pdf/२०४)(विस्मयस्य ... व्रीलस्य .. पारदृश्वना).
