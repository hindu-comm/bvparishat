Dear Nityanandaji,

  

  It would be a useful exercise to collect all rules of Pāṇini for which we do not have examples attested in truly old literature. Works like those of Bhaṭṭi and Nārāyaṇabhaṭṭa are composed by grammarians who are following the rules to grammar to produce their usage, and hence there is some necessary circularity. I have shown that for some rules of Pāṇini, examples are to be found in literature \[like the oldest portions of Carakasaṃhitā supposedly composed in Gāndhāra\] that comes from time and region close to him. The region would be close to his hometown of Śalātura in the Swat valley. It is possible that certain usages that were prevalent in the northwestern region in Pāṇini's time were not to be found in the usage of the northcentral India where Patañjali locates his Āryāvartta and Śiṣṭa. Best wishes for the New Year,
