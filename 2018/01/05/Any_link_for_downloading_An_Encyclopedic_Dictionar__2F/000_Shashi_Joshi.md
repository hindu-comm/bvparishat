Respected members,

  

Does anyone know of an online source for[An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Sanskrit on Historical Principles](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/awork/homepage/pd-sample.php)  

  

The only source I could find is on<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/> but the text is not available publicly.

I did search the net for it, but no success so far.  
  

dhanyavAda,  

\~ Shashi
