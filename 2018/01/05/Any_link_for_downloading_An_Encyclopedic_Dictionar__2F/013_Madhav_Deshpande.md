Hello Marcis,

  

  I am not acting as a defender or justifier of any particular dictionary project. I was only contrasting the Deccan College dictionary with the Śabdakalpadruma. That was Mr. Joshi's question.
Modern computer databases may indeed make some aspects of a project like this outdated, and I agree with you on that point. Is it more extensive than the Bohtlingk-Roth dictionary? From the seven or eight volumes that I have, those eight volumes already exceed the total length of Bohtlingk-Roth dictionary, and the DC dictionary is still only dealing with vowels. Is it a dictionary without an end. I hope not, but it is clear that it is not going to be finished within my life time. Is it useful? Yes, I find it very useful. With best wishes,

  

Madhav Deshpande
