To be more precise, the last word in Vol 9, part III, published in 2011 is अपि, and the discussion of this word begins on p. 4778 and ends on p. 4808, the last page of this volume. Is it more extensive than any other dictionary? Yes, I would say so. Clearly this dictionary, whenever it will be completed, is not for beginners, but for specialists who want to consult a very wide range of the usage of a given word. One would indeed need a lot of patience and deep interest to read that many pages on अपि. To some extent, the same is true of the Bohtlingk-Roth dictionary or the Śabdakalpadruma, Vācaspatya and the Prakrit Abhidhānarājendra. None of these are designed for beginners.
