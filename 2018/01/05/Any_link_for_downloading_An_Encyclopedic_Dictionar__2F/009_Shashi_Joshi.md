Madhavji,

Ateeva dhanyavaad.

  
I presume you have more than this pdf in your possession. How does it compare to shabdakalpadruma?

  

It doesn't seem to be computer typed. Any reason why, if you know?

  

And why such large volumes, what extra are they including?

  

When is expected to finish?

  

And where is the 'Historical Principles' in it?  

  

  
Thanks again,  
Shashikant Joshi
