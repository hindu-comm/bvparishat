Yes, I do have some volumes of the Deccan College Dictionary. You can find a brief description of their aims and scope on the following website:

  

<http://www.dcpune.ac.in/dept-lex-dictionary.php>  

  

The first volume gives an extensive description of the historical methodology. I hope you can find it in some library near you. I don't work at the Deccan College, and so will not be able to give you more details. While the Śabdakalpadruma and Vācaspatya are useful collections of information, they are not historically organized. The Deccan College dictionary collected citations for words from about 3000 works and attempts to give an extensive account of how the usage of a given word and its meaning change over time and across different contexts and genres of Sanskrit literature. This is far more extensive than any other previous Sanskrit dictionary. But for the same reason, it is going to take a very long time to complete.
