Namaste,

  

 Let me say what I think (have spoken about it in the past and even written in the Preface to Frish'sSanskrit-Chech-Russian-English Vocabulary):

"not historically organized" - all dictionaries outside India in XIX where "historically organized" - PWG, PWK, MW. What need to do it again in XX century? The more in XXI century, when we need to work corpus of texts digitally, like Oliver Hellwig does (alone!).

3000 is not that much, actually, because even PWG (inmid-XIX century<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/PWGScan/2013/web/webtc/indexcaller.php>) had circa 2700 sources, see <https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/Cologne/issues/194#issuecomment-352287375>

For that we have<http://kjc-sv013.kjc.uni-heidelberg.de/dcs/index.php?contents=corpus>

For that comparative linguistics would be required (at least to know the Avestan parallels, to see how meanings evolve).

But as written in reviews about the Poona Dictionary before - it was outdated even when it started, see KEWA and EWA.  

<http://samskrtam.ru/kewa-ewa/> (Mayrhofer allowed to put them online). One can't understand the whole evolution inside Sanskrit alone.

Prof. Deshpande, let me disagree. How are 300 new sources "far more extensive"?635,000 times sources are quoted in PWG.

It will be never finished, we must be fair. It would take 1800 years. Just one more

dictionary without an end.

  

What pains me is that smartest Sanskrit scholars where there, including Palsule, and still nothing was put to an end.

It's not about money. What is the reason - I would like to know myself. If I understand right only a few people work on it now.
