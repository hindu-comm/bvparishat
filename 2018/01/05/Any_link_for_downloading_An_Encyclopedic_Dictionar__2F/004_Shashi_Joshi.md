Yes, seems so.

Here are the various links I found for this title:

  

<http://www.dcpune.ac.in/publications-encyclopaedic.php>  

<https://www.amazon.com/Encyclopaedic-Dictionary-Sanskrit-Historical-Principles/dp/B00M4BZW3I>  

(Only Eleven Books of this dictionary have been published so far. The project will run into several more volumes till it is completed. It is the most comprehensive project ever undertaken in the field of lexicography.)

  

<https://www.vedicbooks.net/encyclopaedic-dictionary-sanskrit-historical-principles-parts-p-16778.html>  

<https://www.alibris.com/An-Encyclopaedic-dictionary-of-Sanskrit-on-historical-principles-Amrit-Madhav-Ghatage/book/2036495>  

  

None of the links give any preview of 10-15 pages, as to what the contents are.

  

  

  

  

  
  

Thanks,
