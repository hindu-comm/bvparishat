Friends,

I am sharing a document on behalf of India Discovery Center here.

I prepared the document to plan our next seminar for the period 200BC-500AD

to be held locally in April. In our work we take Indus Period 5000BC-1500BC,

Vedic Period 2500BC-700BC. Classical Period 700BC-200BC.

Our goal is eventually to track down society till now for our own understanding.

Scholars interested in details may check our website <http://www.indiadiscoverycenter.org>

or write to me to help connect to the presenters.

Please feel free to comment if you have an opinion.

Thank you.

BM
