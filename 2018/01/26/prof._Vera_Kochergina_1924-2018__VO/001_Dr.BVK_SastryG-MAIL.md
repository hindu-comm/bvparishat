Namaste



Sad to see the veterans of ‘Western Parampara’ of Sanskrit Enthusiasts and teachers is dwindling; and sadder is the fact that the ‘ Local Native Bharateeya paramparaa’ of ‘Paninian scholars .

Should we, then call this Samskruth Scholars team an ‘ endangered species’ needing special attention for preservation and efforts for rejuvenation and replication ? 



The situation also opens the deeply hurting debate : What has made the ‘Samskruth studies’ to become a dwindling stream – Staring as mighty
‘Ganga’ from Himalayas , sought by every one for its ‘ glory and mystic enchanting powers’ and now, seemingly ending like ‘ Saraswati’ ?
Has time overpowered the ‘ Life of Gods language’?



May be we need to rethink on Application and Utility of Samskruth: Global **‘ VINIYOGA’ benefits** beyond the narrow lanes of classical goals of ‘ Moksha’ and explore the ‘ Purushaartha’ aspects.



May be time to revisit the ‘ battle: sanskrit’ program as a .Rebuild : Samskrutham from Sanskrit’ . There is a lot of wisdom in what Madam Saroja Bhate ji had posted earlier : \< Dialogue between the oriental erudition and modern scholarship is the need of the time. We should honestly accept पुराणमित्येव न साधु सर्वम् while glorifying the achievements of our predecessors. at the same time a deeper penetration in to the treasure of literature of the past is bound to yield many a precious gems of wisdom relevant to the modern times.For this however **a clear unprejudiced open approach is badly needed. The main problem is: Who will do it?** \> \[ Post of Monday, 1 January, 2018 \] .



Let us think of doing the needful work together so that Marcis does not have to feel \< with Bopp and continues with Lenz, Petrov, Fortunatoff, Peterson Kochergina, Likhushina and ends on me.>



**We need to work together for keeping the ‘ Samskrutha-Ganga-Gita –Pravaha’ flowing by rejuvenating Samskruth language tools needed to understand Ramayana and practice Yoga’s of Srimad Bhagavadgita. **
