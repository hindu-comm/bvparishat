Namaste

  

Usually in schools the concept of fire and human timeline(evolution of humans, invention of fire), is taught from a western perspective. In our school we have tried to integrate the western and eastern philosophies wherever possible. I needed help in this regard. I have learnt that Agni Mathana was the prevalent method from ancient times for starting a fire. I needed exact details on where it is mentioned and finer details of materials used. There are youtube videos of agni mathana. There is a mention in 95suktha of 10th mandala of RV (urvashi and pururava). Some details are mentioned in apastamba and bodhayan gruhya sutra is what I heard but I cannot find it exactly. I also wanted to know if there are any agnihotris near Bangalore. We wanted to take children there and show the way to preserve fire.

  

Similarly I wanted references for the concept of time from nimisha to kalpa. Where are the exact calculations mentioned?

  

Thanks i advance.
