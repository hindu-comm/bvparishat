Haraye namah.  
Vidvadbhyo namah.  
Namaskar Deeproji.  
PragreeshwarAn nipAtAh\|1\|4\|56\|\| is adhikAr sutram - adhireeshware \|1\|4\|97\|\| uptill here. The words which fall between them are termed NipAta sanjnyak.  
  
ChAdayo asatve\| satvam linga-sankhya-anvitam dravyam. Any word which has the potentiality to be linked with linga and sankhya/vachanam is a satva/dravyavachi shabda. Such words are not considered as nipAtas even though their pAtha is in the chAdiganam.  
For eg. The word 'pashu' has been used in the chAdiganam, but when it is an avyaya and when it isn't depends on it's usage and meaning. "ग्राम्यं पशुमानय।" over here the ling is pulling, vachan is dvitiya ekavachanam. So it isn't an avyaya even though it is read in the chAdiganam. "लोधम् नयन्ति पशु मन्यमानाः।" Here pashu is adravyArtha prayog. So it's not linked with ling and vachanam. It means 'samyak' over here so it's only in asatve chAdayo nipAtah syuh. Here it gains nipAt sanjnyA and hence svarAdi sutrena avyayatvam.  
  
Upasarga-vibhakti-svara-PRATIROOPAKAASHCHA nipAtAh.  
Upsarga-pratiroopakAh vibhakti-pratiroopakAh swara-pratiroopakAh ch nipAtAh syuh ityarthah. Pratiroopak means that they look like upasargas, vibhaktis(sup and ting) and swaras, but aren't.  
  
1. Upasarga-pratiroopak-nipAtah. = अवदत्तम्. Here 'ava' is not  
Upasarga but upasarga+pratiroopak. It is not upasarga sanjnyak, still because of it's swaroop it is nipAta sanjnyak, hence avyay. If it was an upasarg, "अच उपसर्गात् तः" this sootra will have तकार आदेश hence "अवत्तम्" this wrong rupa would get formed.  
  
2. Vibhakti. अहंयुस्। aham is not अस्मद् शब्द रूप।it is vibhakti pratiroopak. So it is a nipAta. If it wasn't nipAta and was ting, vibhakti luk would take place, that is sup vibhakti, सु would go away and anishta roop would be made. In ting, अस्तिक्षीरा has asti vibhakti pratiroopak avyay. It is not tingant. If it was again, anishta roopa aapatti.  
  
3. Swara. Some words like अ आ इ ई ....... औ। they are not swaras. That means they are not those which are read in the "अच् प्रत्याहार।" अचः स्वराः। so these are not ach. They just look like ach. So any अच्त्व-निमित्त-कार्य wont take place.  
  
I hope I've answered all your questions.  
Thankyou.  
Regards.  
Rishi.
