Thanks for confirming my views to the audience.

  

\>LashaNa and Lakshya are pairs, but LashaNa grantha and Lakshya grantha are not.

  

Yes, you are right. Pairing upLashaNa and Lakshya is regular and is found often. Pairing upLashaNa grantha and Lakshya granthais rare. But need for such pairing, rarely though, may arise.

  

Dr K Aravinda Rao garu is currently working on Ramayana. My guess is that his question is in that context.
