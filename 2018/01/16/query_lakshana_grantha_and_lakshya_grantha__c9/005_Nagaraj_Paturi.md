closest to the verb root 'laksh-' of Sanskrit, in English, seems to be the verb root 'mark-'

  

lakshaNa = characteristic, feature has a synonym 'mark'

  

lakshaNa = the process of characterising has a synonym 'marking'

  

lakshaNa = the book resulting from or having for its content, the process of characterising. How to say this in in a single word in English? The closest seems to be characterising text/work. Can we say 'a marking text/work' ?

  

lakshya = aim, goal, target. What makes the root 'mark-' interesting is that we have usage of the noun 'mark' in the sense of 'target' also. Lakshya , in fact, is the target, focus for characterising. 

  

lakshaNa = characteristic, feature is the meaning that is useful in the words for s'abda vritti suc as lakshaNaa vritti, and artha bhedas such as lakshyaartha etc. mark is a synonym of characteristic characteristc, feature etc., too.  

  

That is why I thought there is a great commonality between the semantics of the roots laksh- and mark-. But there is no usage of any derivative of mark- in the sense of a text/work resulting from or having for its content, the process of characterising.
