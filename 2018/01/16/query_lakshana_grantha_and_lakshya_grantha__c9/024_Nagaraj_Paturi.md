Interesting tabulation.

  

Since there is a tradition of viewing the Ayurveda, VyaakaraNa and Yoga s'aastras as a set of three cleansing sciences, this verse has been viewed as referring to the same.

  

In the beginning of the work itself, Hari says:

  

तद् द्वारम् अपवर्गस्य वाङ्मलानां चिकित्सितम् /

पवित्रं सर्वविद्यानाम् अधिविद्यं प्रकासतॆ // वाक्य\_१।१४ //

  

Hence, he seems to have only वाङ्मलचिकित्सा in his mind in theकायवाग्बुद्धिविषया verse also.

  

Interesting to note from this verse is the word a(a)dhyaatma s'aastra in reference to Yoga s'aastra.

  

In any case,

  

I completely agree with your vaag yoga view of Samskrutam.

  

I was giving a talk on divinity of Sanskrit recently at Goa as part of the first ever Indic Thought Festival.

  

I was arguing that 'divinity' of Sanskrit should not be viewed in the lines of Abrahamic religious ideas such as "God said, 'let there be light! there was light!' ". Many linguistics books dealing with theories of origin of language have been saying that India has a divine origin theory of language which is that goddess Sarasvati created language. I have always been puzzled at this. Wherefrom do these books get these stories?

  

I said that we have two things in the Vedic tradition:

  

Language as a phenomenon itself is divine.

  

Sanskrit is useful for aadhyaatmika saadhana because it encapsulates in itself the sanskaara of the Rishis and the Dharma of the s'ishTas.

  

You have been using the word vaagyoga in reference to this spiritual practice incorporated in Sanskrit, that Hari elaborates in his Vaakyapadeeyam.

  

That is the divinity in our view.

  

All our devatas (not gods , we don't have gods) are with us to be experienced by us, to interact with us, all the time. Speech, particularly Sanskrit speech is one such.

  

Thanks for giving me an opportunity to share these views.
