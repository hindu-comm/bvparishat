The main point made so far (which I take to be: ‘lakṣya is more like ’subject matter, domain,’ not necessarily a particular text being explained/supported, an object text’) is in keeping with the discussion under the Vārttika "lakṣya-lakṣaṇe vyākaraṇam" found in the introductory part of Patañjali’s Vyākaraṇa-mahābhāṣya.  
  
The juxtaposing of lakṣya and lakṣaṇa found in the specified context may have had its origin in the Vārttika tradition, just as the later (roughly 15th-18th century A.D.) juxtaposing of lakṣyaika-cakṣuṣka and lakṣaṇaika-cakṣuṣka found in the tradition of the Pāṇinīyas.
