The following may be of some interest here. The Vartikakaara after discussing as to what Vyakaranam is, came to the conclusion that it consists of both lakshya and lakshanam, and wrote the vaartika (refer to Paspasahnika, nearer the end) लक्ष्यलक्षणे व्याकरणम्। However the Bhashyakaara re-established that Sutram alone is Vyakaranam, by stating अथवा पुनरस्तु सूत्रम्। and then resolving the objections against Sutra alone being Vyakaranam.

  

The view that Vyakarana is its own lakshanam applies only to the subset of rules, namely samjna, paaribhasha and atidesa Sutras. Following the maxim प्राधान्येन व्यपदेशः (naming is based on importance), since vidhi and allied sutras (like niyama and pratishedha) are the important ones in Vyakarana, it is appropriate to call Vyakaranam as Lakshanasastra only.
