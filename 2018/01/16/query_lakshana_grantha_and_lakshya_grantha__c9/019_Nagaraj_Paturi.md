If you are not connecting Ramayana and books like Artha s'aastra , Kaamandaka etc. , if you are not pairing them up, as lakshya grantha and lakshaNa grantha to each other, then you can say that Ramayana is a book of lakshyas and Artha s'aastra , Kaamandaka etc. , are books of lakshaNa.

  

If you are aim is to bring out the distinction between these two kinds of books in communicating a similar content, -that aim is a laudable one- in that case, to say that Ramayana is a book that communicates through lakshyas = cases, while books like Artha s'aastra , Kaamandaka etc. communicate through lakshaNa is fine. So without mentioning any lakshya-lakshaNa relationship between the two, you can say that Ramayana is a book of lakshyas and books like Artha s'aastra , Kaamandaka etc. are books of lakshaNa. In that sense, you can say that Ramayana is lakshya grantha and books like Artha s'aastra , Kaamandaka etc. are lakshaNa granthas.
