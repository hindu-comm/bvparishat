Thanks a lot for the pool of ideas. I learnt about the descriptive and prescriptive grammars.

  

I had this doubt regarding the lakshya grantha when I was giving talks on Valmiki's Ramayana and was realizing that there are so many insights into political strategies. Texts such as Arthashastra, Kamandaka Nitisara etc, came later, presumably and hence, Ramayana could be called a lakshya grantha and Kamandaka etc, as lakshana granthas.

I was venturing with translations such as *analytical work* and *demonstrative work.*
