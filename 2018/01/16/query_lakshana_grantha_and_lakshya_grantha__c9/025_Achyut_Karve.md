Dear BVK Sastryji,

  

' Can it also be resolved to give the meaning ‘ Vyakarana is as much its own lakshya and it is also its own lakshanam’.  

  

This is more than epitomised in the Maheshwar Sutras which is the least understood part of the Ashtadhyayi.

  

It is true that the duality of the lakshya and lakshanam can only be transcended through Yoga.

  

It is unfortunate that modern scholarship believes or takes the letter to be more revealing than the spirit.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve
