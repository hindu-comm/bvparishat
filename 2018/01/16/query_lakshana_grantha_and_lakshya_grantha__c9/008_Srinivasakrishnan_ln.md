From the point of view of linguistics, this contrast between *lakṣya*and *lakṣaṇa*is captured in English as that between
'*descriptive*' and '*prescriptive*' linguistics. Thus we have descriptive and prescriptive grammars.

  

In the Indian context, '*lakṣya*' always refers to *śiṣṭaprayoga*, usages of those who are considered worthy of emulation.

  

In general linguistics, '*descriptive*' might refer to a sentence, for example, which a native speaker would produce. The sense of *śiṣṭaprayoga* is there however in the *lakṣya**uccāraṇa* of Standard English called RP (Received Pronunciation) English.

  

Hope this helps.
