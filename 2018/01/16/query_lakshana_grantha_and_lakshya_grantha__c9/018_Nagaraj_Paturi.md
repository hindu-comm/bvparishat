Oh, the pair lakshya grantha and lakshaNa grantha can not be used in that sense.

  

One may say, ' lakshyas = examples for the lakshaNas in the s'aastra granthas dealing with political strategies and the like can be seen in the narrative action portions of Ramayana', if that is what is intended to be said.

  

Mentioning 'narrative action portions' is necessary because there are non-narrative portions of the book where the 'theory' is directly mentioned as part of conversations in the form of upades'a.

  

If that is not what is intended to be said, if what is intended to be said is that kaarya , narrative action in Ramayana, has / instructs / exemplifies - political strategies other than /in addition to - those in the s'aastragranthas, then this lakshya - lakshaNa way of saying does not fit here.
