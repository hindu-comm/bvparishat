Namaste Subbuji

gauNIvritti can be roughly translated as a secondary connotation. Any pada connnotes its padArtha by means of a vritti, in this context, meaning connotation. It can either be direct (shakti) or indirect (lakshaNA). gauNIvritti is by lakshaNA.

  

Jaimini AchArya in his pUrva mImAmsa sUtra says that vedic shabda can take gauNa artha in the following six circumstances:

  

1\) tatsiddhi - where a thing performs the function of the other. For example, the vedic sentence yajamAna: prastara: refers to the yajamAna as a prastara, a clump of darbha grass. Here the prastara is a substitute for the yajamAna, and can be used in situations in place of the yajamAna when he is physically absent. The yajamAna cannot be a clump of grass, so the usage is a gauNa prayoga.  
  
2) jAti - where the same characteristic possessed by two things is the basis for a word referring to one thing directly is used to imply the other. For example, the vedic sentence 'agnir brAhmaNa:' refers to brAhmaNa as agni on account of both agni and brAhmaNa being born from the mouth of virAT. Again the brAhmin is not fire in reality, only figuratively.

  

3\) sArUpya - where two things have a similar form is used as a basis for two objects being compared. For example, the vedic sentence 'Adityo yUpah' where the sacrificial post, the yUpah, which has been newly painted, is figuratively referred to as the sun because both shine brilliantly. This is a case of the yUpah being compared to the sun, again a figurative usage.

  

4\) prashamsA - praise. For example, the vedic sentence 'apashavo vA anye go ashvebhya:', where the veda says that animals other than the cow and horse are not animals at all. The aim of the veda is not to actually claim that the other animals are not animals in fact, but to praise the cow and horse

  

5\) bhUma - if a majority of things share a common ground, then the usage of the word to convey the majority includes the minority not referred to by the word. E.g. the sentence 'SRShTI: upadadhAti' - here the word SRShTI: refers to a kind of brick used in the construction of the yajnavedi. There are several mantras that contain the word 'SRShTi:' which are recited during the construction of the altar (upadhAna). In addition to these mantras, a few other mantras that occur in the same location are also to be chanted. Thus on the basis that a majority of the mantras refer to a common ground (bhUma), the word SRShTi: refers to both the many mantras that explicitly contain with the word, and those few that do not.

  

6\) linga samavAya - presence of attributes. The sentence 'prANabhRt upadadhAti' - here prANAbhRt refers to another kind of brick used in the yajnavedi construction. Only first mantra chanted when constructing the vedi contains the word prANAbhrt, the remaining mantras contain only the word prANa. Thus by prANabhRt, not only is the mantra containing the exact word prANabhRt meant, but also other mantras containing the word prANa.

  

AhArya Aropa is one of the two types of Aropa or superimpositions mentioned in nyAyA, the other being anAhArya. Here the term AhArya Aropa refers to a superimposition that is deliberately intended.

  

gauNIvritti, in my view, refers to the mechanism by which a word conveys its meaning (in the case of gauNIvritti, the word - meaning connection is in a secondary sense), whereas AhArya Aropa refers to the deliberate superimposition of one object on the other. That is, the former is pada-padArtha sambandha, whereas the latter is padArtha-padArtha sambandha. This is just my opinion, so am open to be corrected.
