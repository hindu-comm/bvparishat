Namaste

  

Here are two terms:आहार्यारोपः and गौणीवृत्तिः  Are the two different concepts or the same? For the second term, the example that comes to the mind is: सिंहो माणवकः where the term simha is not used in its literal, primary, sense but in a secondary, gauNii sense. I request an explanation of the terms with examples.

  

Thanks and regards
