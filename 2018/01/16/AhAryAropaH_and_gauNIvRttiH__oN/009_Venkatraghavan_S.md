Namate Subbuji,

You are very welcome. This explanation I heard from my teachers, but the original source is the Jaimini sUtras 1.4.23 to 1.4.28 and SAbara bhAShya to these. A translation of the sUtras is available here -<https://archive.org/details/mimamsasutra00jaimuoft>

  

The same examples are given there also.

  

To add one further consideration - traditionally in pUrvamImAmsa, a distinction is made between the gauNI vritti and lakshaNA. According to them, it is only lakshaNA that conveys secondary meaning, whereas through gauNI vritti, a particular quality is transferred - that is, the force of the word is in conveying a particular attribute present in one object as being present in the other.

  

  

Regards

Venkatraghavan
