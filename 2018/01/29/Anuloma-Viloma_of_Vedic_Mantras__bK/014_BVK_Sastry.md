Namaste Rajkumari Trika



Here is the grey area in your response post.



a) The entirety of ‘Tantra Shaastra’ is based on ‘Yoga’ of ‘ Aksharas used as Mantra-Yoga’ at the level of ‘ SAMYAMA’, a state where ‘ Dharnaa- Dhyana –Samaadhi’ are unified and focused. ( Traym ekatra samyamaH). The ‘ Akshara’ foundations of ‘Tantra’ come from ‘ Veda-Aksharas’ also known as ‘ Samskrutha Varna- Maalaa ( expanded from Maheswara Sutras) . The general rules comes from Vedaanga Shikshaa ; The special rules from Pratishaakhya; The Tantra application rules from ‘ Tantra technical works’. This is expanded totality of ‘Yoga-Samskrutham’ foundation of ‘ Akshara – Brahma’./ ‘Brahma-Akshara’.



b) Mahamurtyunjaya Mantra is a veda mantra, used in yajna and Tantra differently. This Mantra comes with a ‘Svara’ ( accented letter sequence). Abhinavaguptas extensive technical writing on Tantras provide step by step practice instructions’ Of course, the language is terse and technical. And as usual, the ‘ academic translations and popular perceptions of ‘Tantra’ ( portrayed through visual Photoshop grandeur in movies and serials) has destroyed the soul of Abhinavaguptas teaching ! One will know of it only when one enters deeper in to this portal and begins real technical dialogues. The mesmerism of Words is not going to help the transcend the ‘web of words (Shabda – jaalam). Worldly People will take any ‘ instruction’ from ‘Guru’ as ‘ unquestionable dictum’ and attribute every result to ‘ Guru’ without understanding the law of ‘ Cause and Effect Correlations’. Karma- Phala is not an easy judgement to be simplistically attributed to a single, singular cause, as faith people would like to and love to simplify it .



c) When this \< Mahamrutyunjaya mantra> was tried out in the way as indicated in the post, what were the guidelines for practice instruction ? was there just an inversion ( pratiloma/ anuloma- viloma> of \<svaras> ? OR was it just \< akshara – reversal> ? or More practical’s involved ?



 This needs to be clarified.
