Namaste





On \< ***न स्वरं प्रतिलोमयेत्*** .. Why do you think this is noncompliance? 

 **Isnt the meaning of this rule meant to imply that the svaras do not undergo reversal** 

 (Or

** maybe svaras are not considered in reverse usage? ** \>



***My response:** ***



1) The context for the discussion is about ‘FASTER SIDDHI’ :
- ****



 The line referred is \< **I was told by a Swamiji in Rishikesh that the chanting of mantras as anuloma-viloma gives faster siddhi.> **

 The person authority –Text invoked is \< Shri Gowtham Sarmaji was kind enough to refer me to the anulomakalpa a parisista of the atharvaveda.>



 **Only the scholars of that tradition may be capable of addressing this issue.**



2) The Connected questions raised read :

\< Are there similar rules for anuloma-viloma of vedic mantras in Rig/ Yajus/ Sama? 

 \< Has anyone in the list had prior experience with reversing vedic mantras and practicing with them? \>





 **Technically, Traditionally and Practically : There (may be / will be ) are such practices / OR the Atharva model will be adapted appropriately in practice. **

****

** On Prior experiences : Here say matters are not going to be any more interesting like ‘ counting the teeth of a crow!’ ( kAkasya kati vaa dantaaH - pareekshaa) .**

****

** On Possibility/ Probability of Swara-Pratiloma: Check what the Physical Indriya of Speech can do and what ‘ Manas’ can do in Ateendriya range. **

****

** On Practice/ Practicing : The issue is not for public debate and public entertainment ! **

****

** Summary: IF the exploration is on an advanced topic and application of ‘Veda –Prayoga – Sheeghra Siddhi’, better have a clear understanding on ‘ Vedangas, Yoga- Aagama –Tantra parts’.**

****

** When one ‘experiences’ the technicalities of ‘ Prana –Pratishthaa’ and ‘ Panchabhoota Panchopachaara Poojaa’
where individual ( Jeeva - Saadhaka interacts consciously and dynamically **

** with the Cosmos ( Ishwara Shareera PRakruti and Shakti) , the relative nature of ‘ Faster- Slower’ in Siddhi will be understood. **

****

** **

** For this, the study-practice of ‘Samskrutham as Vak-Yoga: Language of Yoga/ Mantra Yoga ( PYS 4^(th) chapter ) is needed. **

** This is out of the ‘ Oriental Sanskrit Studies domain –pedagogy which treats ‘Language f Veda as Classical/ historical / Local Tribal’ completely devoid of ‘ Consciousness of Speaker’. **

** The ‘model of ‘ itihaasa- deshiya jana- moolaa vak’ is not the proposition of ‘ Aatma-moolaa Vak’ in Veda –Mantra –Yoga Samskrutham. **

****

** Till The CRITICALITY of this PARADIGM Shift is realized for ‘ SAMSKRUTHAM FOR YOGA –SIDDHI -Practice’, enjoy the window shopping of the texts, narratives and passages of tradition as nice bedtime stories ! and have nice dreams (Swapna) !!**

****

** Peace.**

****

**Regards**
