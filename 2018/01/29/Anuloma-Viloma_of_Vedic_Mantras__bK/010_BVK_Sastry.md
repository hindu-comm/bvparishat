Namaste



On \< But unless one starts at the level of theory, practice cannot be explored… light on the theory and the literature for now.> Related to
\<***न स्वरं प्रतिलोमयेत्**> and *** .. \<**Swamiji in Rishikesh that the chanting of mantras as anuloma-viloma gives faster siddhi** \> 

Note: Pl. Don’t get off the track of explaining the above mantra in Vedanta Adhyaatma mode and asking for meaning of ‘SVARA’ in relation to ( AKSHARA BRAHMA) ! The frame of interpretation used here is looking at Samskrutham as VAK-YOGA / YOGA- BHASHAA / MANTRA – BRAAHMANA BHASHAA / GUHYA BHASHAA. Samskruth terms having multivalent derivations and meanings is not uncommon. MW dictionary will not help in all these deliberations.

 The present models of Sanskrit learning, globally, have totally dropped out these dimensions of Studying PANINIAN SAMSKRUTHAM; almost every school seems to have preferred to have just one peeping hole of ‘ SANSKRIT = Classical language of Hinduism, a world religion, a rule cluttered mumbo-jumbo, a brahminical language in which Vedas are written; and rules of grammar provided by Panini , a language which has hybrid Buddhist version-vernacular.

In \< ***स्वर**- प्रतिलोम \> ***the direction gets reversed. Technically it becomes starting with Samhara karma and moving against the normal mode of Creation flow. What does it mean in terms of physiological effort and movement of organs , the flow of air and movement of tongue ? When \< svara-pratiloma takes place>, there is no more outbound ( Vaikhari) speech. Then what remains is ‘ Speech Inside’, which needs to be manipulated internally. The effect will be on ‘ SPEAKERS INNER BODY MIND LIFE EENRGY = Saadhakas Prana – Manas – Shareera> . The SVARA –SHAASTRA rules are meant to safeguard the ‘ WELL BEING OF THE SAADHAKA’. If the practitioner is ready to experiment and hurt themselves before hurting / helping others, go ahead and explore by all means ! It is a free world .



In the given mantra practice like \< Bala TripuraSundari mantra: Aim Klim Sauh- Sauh Klim Aim.  \> what is seen –shown in practice is ‘ SVARA’ ( = Varna-maalaa antargata akshara samooha ) inversion. The mode of SWARA – INVERSION / REVERSAL (PRATILOMA ) OF ACCENT ( SVARA) -
The technique of TRACKING BACK, ACCENTED LETTER / INVERSION OF ACCENTED LETTER does not seem to be explicitly documented in the text.
Does it still exist in practicing tradition ? a million dollar question for investigation !

2. Your next question would be : Are there rules for observance and compliance for \< ***स्वर**- प्रतिलोम \> ***? If so , where are they? Who practices –teaches -? How will it lead to Faster Siddhi ?

 Yes. There are rules of language- mysticism –Science of Consciousness and Energy in Sounds. ( akshara – beeja chaitanya shakti).

 The rules to be used in APAURUSHEYA VEDA MANTRAS and VAIDIKA/ AVAIDIKA TANTRAS differ. This is foundation of ‘ Ashta vikruti Patha’- to generate special application benefits of ‘SAMHITA’ ( UNIFIED PACKAGED TEXT as MANTRA –SUKTA) . Each Patha unfolds the ‘ PADA – ANTARGATA – CHAITANYA SHAKTI’ differently. So the rules for Krama- to- Ghaa differ. When traditionalists make ashta vikruti Paatha sound like lung power exposition simulating ‘ Frog- Croak repetition’ ( as
Patanjali calls it :: manDookavat raTaraTAyate) , the exercise becomes one of ‘ Scholarship and skill display of training in word gymnastics flow out’. It does not deliver the unique benefits it is supposed to deliver. Does this frame of ‘ashta- vikruti patha training’ still exist in ‘ Veda- Patha shala ‘ practicing tradition ? a million dollar question for investigation ! Does Sanskrit Universities have any platform to deliberate on this aspect ? Again a a million dollar question for investigation ! 

 The Rule Generics of this discipline, technically called ‘SVARA –SHAASTRA’ come from Vedanga Vyakarana of Panini . There is no use jumping for a Google search to locate an obscure manuscript and ask for meanings. This part of Vak-Yoga tradition : Building Shikshaa Shaastra as foundation of Vedanga Vyakarana has gone underground in India itself for over three hundred years ! The relics of this tradition are still available in deep parts of Yoga traditions, Buddhism Meditation techniques and ASEAN mystic schools ( who have lost connection with Paninian – Vedanga tradition). The gap is filled inadequately by Colonial and oriental inputs , creating more chaos than necessary.

 The Discipline Application Specific rules come from specific texts like parisista of the atharvaveda , Mantra mahodadhi, Prapancha saara , Devataa – Vishista aagamas. 

 The practice guidance is deeply linked with Vedanga Jyotisha and several other allied disciplines.

Given this backdrop, what would be the next action ? End of window shopping mantras for siddhi ??
