Namaste



My responses indented below:

^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry ( )** :

---------------------------------

**From:** [bvpar...@googlegroups.com]() \[mailto:[bvpar...@googlegroups.com]()\] **On Behalf Of** venkat veeraraghavan  
**Sent:** Thursday, 1 November, 2018 5:31 PM

**Subject:** Re: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Anuloma-Viloma of Vedic Mantras



Dear Sir,



I am genuinely confused by your answer.



When I read this response from your esteemed self, I only end up more confused than before.



This is not some fault I am trying to ascribe to yourself, but it is my own ignorance.



You write:

**Technically, Traditionally and Practically : There (may be / will be ) are such practices / OR the Atharva model will be adapted appropriately in practice.**



**\>\>There may be / will be/ are => Which of the 3 is it in your personal experience? Because the follow up questions vary in each case and this thread is likely to become very complicated if I devise an "if then else" loop to cover all 3 scenarios.**

^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry ( personal experience )** : **There may be** – is a limitation of my awareness of texts and practice ; This calls for Search.


**There will be** – is a firm opinion, as without such process, the mantra process steps can not be advanced. Details: Explore: Abhinava Guptas works on Tantra.


**There are** – is a pointer to what comes as a part of my own tradition of practice. This is limits within my practice tradition, which may or may not be extendable .



 

---------------------------------





When \< svara-pratiloma takes place>, there is no more outbound ( Vaikhari) speech.



--> Doesn't the AV parisishta indicate that svara is not reversed, is there an alternative verse somewhere that gives the rules for this reversal of svara? If so kindly give references pls.

^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry ( alternate verse Reference )** : Everything in Practice does not carry a reference from a text. The guidance is custom provided by Masters as ‘ Upadesha’. This is beyond ‘Academic scholarship and quotes from text.

---------------------------------



Also, even in the anuloma chanting of rks, vaikhari is frequently transcended to madhyama and sometimes pashyanti vAk while doing japa. For ex: Gayatri japa is frequently done as upamsu or manasik and here the speech involution takes place with time and diligence of the sadhaka.

^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry ( Vak-Transcendence )** : The ‘ feeling of Mantra loosing in Japa, Feeling of a pervasiveness, Abstract state without any thought and meaning ripples (Shabda Vrutti) - can not be equated or considered as ‘Vak-Transcendence. ( Ateendriyataa, Vaachaam- agocharataa- Vak- Darshana). There are specific check modes to test whether Japa has gone to a stage of ‘Pratyaahara, Dharana, Dhyana, Samadhi, Samyama, Viniyoga’ – technicalities of ‘ Vak. The Tantra terminology and Yoga terminology have close run, but also carry unique flavors.



Upaamshu japa is ‘Sookshma’ but not ‘ attednriya’. ‘ Maanasika’ is NOT speech involution or reversal ! It is observing the mantra in a ‘ pre-articulation stage’.





---------------------------------





This is not a case of window shopping, but trying to make sense of jumbled information and lack of help from within traditions that are built towards adhyayana as opposed to yoga/tapascharya.

^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry ( Taste of Sugar and naming the Taste as Sweet )** : If passages from different texts and traditions are inadvertently mixed, the outcome is ‘ jumble information’. OR in popular terms ‘ Saambaar where one can not identify the individual veggies’ . Americans call it as Soup and Salad models. Tradition calls it as ‘ Paanaka –Rasa nyaaya’.



One needs to get on practice rather than explore the road map paper in these scenarios and then recheck the document with the help of teacher.
This is where Yoga of Samskrutham comes in.

---------------------------------



I can understand vaguely your comment about the yoga aspects having been separated from the bhasha. Do you have any practical pointers towards redressing this imbalance?

^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry ( Vak-Yoga Practical pointers )** : What is Yajurveda :
Agnir me Vaachi Shritah…… Vak- hrudaye, Hrudayam mayi, aham amruthe, amrutham Brahmanai/ Vak Yajnena Kalpataam ( Rudra PRashna – Chame) mean ? Any one who explains the practicality of this ?

---------------------------------





I am unsure what you mean by the following:

\>\>If the practitioner is ready to experiment and hurt themselves before hurting / helping others, go ahead and explore by all means ! It is a free world .



I have nowhere spoken about experimentation. Why then would I ask a question in the open forum?

^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry ( experimentation - Privacy )** : What should be in the pooja room should be in the pooja room; and what should be in the bed room should be in the bed room. The topic you have touched upon is asking details of what happens inside the ‘ Shareera’ and in the open forum. So, the only way it can be explained is go ahead and experiment. Music teacher teaches how to sing a raga. If student desires to experiment differently, teachers say –‘ go ahead and try’!

---------------------------------





I would appreciate it greatly if you can give some references from any of the texts you have quoted regarding such applications.

^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry ( Texts ref )** : Yajurveda –Rudra Prashna above for further exploration; abhinava Gupta on Tantra.
