Anuloma/pratiloma of a mantra is not in the form of Vikriti patha as in Veda, but is a part of tantra/technique.

  

It comes within the purview of varNa nyasa and is a method of application.

One ex in Tantra is the Bala TripuraSundari mantra:

Aim Klim Sauh Sauh Klim Aim.

  

I am however not sure about its application in Vedas since it involves Swaras and rules for such reversal with substitutions that are normally passed on master to disciple.
