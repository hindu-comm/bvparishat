Dear BVK, I read your reply to Rajkumari Trikha. You wrote,"The ‘ Akshara’ foundations of ‘Tantra’ come from ‘ Veda-Aksharas’ also known as ‘ Samskrutha Varna- Maalaa ( expanded from Maheswara Sutras).

My understanding: Sanskrit VarNamala did not come from Maheshwar Sutras. It was given in Vaajasaneeya Pratishaakhya. Kaatyaayana brought it into focus first five rows from /K/ to /m/. Thanks N.R.joshi
