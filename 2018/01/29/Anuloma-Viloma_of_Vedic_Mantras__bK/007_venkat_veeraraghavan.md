Dear Sri Sastryji:

  

The line you refer to:***न स्वरं प्रतिलोमयेत्***

In the example illustrated the svaras are not given.

  

Why do you think this is noncompliance? Isnt the meaning of this rule meant to imply that the svaras do not undergo reversal (Or maybe svaras are not considered in reverse usage?)

  

Venkat
