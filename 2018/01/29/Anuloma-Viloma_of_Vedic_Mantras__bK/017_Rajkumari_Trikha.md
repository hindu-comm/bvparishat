Dear scholars,

Happy Diwali to list members. My post was shown as queued in my mail box. Only today I found that it is delivered, and there has been discussion upon it too.

 I am writing in response to Dr BVK Shastry. The query was about reversal of vowels in samput of a mantra.

As I have learnt from tradition, the vowels are not repeated except ऊँ, only consonants are repeated.

  

I personally tried mahamrityunjay mantra in Sir Gangaram hospital, delhi, on floor of its children's ward, sitting on a blanket in 1988 when my daughter was v v critical. I didn't observe any hard and fast rule. But I did japa with full concentration and faith. By God's grace she survived, and regained health after a very long surgery in 1989.

The mantra was taught by my late revered father as follows

  

ऊँ हों जूं सः। ऊँ भूर्भवः स्वः

ऊँ त्र्यम्बकं यजामहे सुगन्धिं पुष्टिवर्धनम्। ऊर्वारुकमिव बन्धनान्मृत्योर्मुक्षीय माममृतात्।

स्वः भुवः भूः ऊँ। सः जूं हों ऊँ।

This is my personal experience, which as a rule should not have been disclosed. I have violated the rule, as I know अभिरूपभूयिष्ठा परिषदियम् .
