On \< My understanding: Sanskrit VarNamala did not come from Maheshwar Sutras. It was given in Vaajasaneeya Pratishaakhya. Kaatyaayana brought it into focus first five rows from /K/ to /m/. >.



1. ‘Samskrutha Varnamaalaa’ is an Organization for learning Samskrutha Bhashaa. When this was formulated, Who did it can be an eternal debate. Even if some historicity is resolved, it is just a satisfaction. It does not change the ground reality rules to learn and use the language. 



2. ‘Samskrutha Varna-Maalaa’ and ‘ Maheswara Sutras Order and arrangement of Varna-Maalaa units’. Maheswara Sutra is a special arrangement of ‘Samskrutha Varna-Maalaa’ ( or Vedic / Pratishaakhya set of phonetic units). Why was there a need for special arrangement ? Paninian tradition answered it as Convenience of ‘ Samjnaa’ Notations development for making Cryptic Grammar formulae. It is well known that Pratishaakhyas use the Samskrutha Varnamaala with svaras ( accents) included for unique identification. Panini’s Maheswara Sutra convention moves the ‘Swara- tag’ to Sutras from Primary set formation.



Where do we see pointers to these thoughts ? Siamese language (Thai) has a comparable Varnamaalaa set , but has accented swaras counted as separate units. Tamil Brahmi (Dravidian) has dropped Mahaprana aksharas; introduces some special phonemes to make their alphabet set. Newari language has a similar set of alphabets where same swara with different accents is considered independent counting unit of alphabet set.
Looking broadly , Samskrutha Varnamaalaa looks as old / eternal as Vedas. The Maheswara sutras are derived inspirational rearrangement for grammar purpose.



**And how does this connect to Yoga- Tantra ? in the context of present thread ? The Yoga-Tantra- Aagama ways of Using ‘ Mantras with Samskruth Varnamaala’ sounds/ phonemes’ use the ‘Vak-Yoga’ technicality to practice ‘Mantra sounds’ for ‘ Siddhi’s. This is Yoga way of learning-using Samskrutham for Total Wellness / Siddhi’s listed as utility application benefits (= Mantra – Akshara Viniyoga). This is the lost tradition of ‘Vak-Yoga’ spiritual linguistics of Panini-Patanjali- Yaaska schools; and the substitution is made by
‘Social-historical- conversational linguistics’ tightly set in the Biblical model of ‘ Language classification, called ‘ Tower of Babel’.

**( Note: Hunch ( even if one thinks it is Oakish derivation ! - BABEL
is sounding similar to ‘ BABHLU’ – one of the Vedic names of Maheswara, found in Rudra prashna. Did Maheswara Sutra – Maha- Babhlu –Sutra ; and did this become the tower of Babel story ?? Tower of Babel = Pinnacle of BABHLU / Mountain Kailash ?? I don’t know. Could be some entertaining fancy thought also. Did not Vedas precede OT/Bible and Vedic languages degenerated had an influence on Latin/ Greek / Roman ? Why always look at only Hebrew ?? Why not Turanian,
