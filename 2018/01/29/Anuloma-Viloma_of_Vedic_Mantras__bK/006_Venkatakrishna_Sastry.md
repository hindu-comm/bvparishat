Namaste

  

1\. The anuloma- vilomak kalpa warning is there upfront -first line of the text image shared .

  It reads \< ***न स्वरं प्रतिलोमयेत्***  \> . The illustrated examples just don't seem to be compliant with this condition.

  The technique is also \< not a plain reversal -imaging of the given line as reverse direction reading of BOOK  as KOOB ! 

  

2\. Such techniques are shown in some Sampradayas as \< Niranjan Ji:
It comes within the purview of varNa nyasa and is a method of application.

One ex in Tantra is the Bala TripuraSundari mantra: Aim Klim Sauh Sauh Klim Aim.  \> . And in todays practice , as I see with my limited exposure (even in the core cirles ) there is much to be desired for improvement and correction in practice.

  

3\. True that such ' Aksara - Beeja variations and fusions ' like hybridizing the seeds' produce different outcomes; and some of them are
Siddhi's achieved through a different path. Works like Tantramahodadhi elaborate on such applications. It is like a guide for climbing mountain from a hanging cliff and still say that one is on the top of the mountain. Great effort. Would that be the pleasure of mountaineering or goal of climbing the mountain ? 

  

4\. All said and done, when one discusses such technicality of Samskrutham/ Veda/ Yoga applications, it is like discussing the nuances of soccer game : the play, the training and the coach strategy . But what one seems to forget is that there are ground rules for preparation of soccer game and playing it for a medal on international arena. Like this, the deliberations on ' Auloma-Viloma of Veda Mantras' calls for a ground preparation in ' Upa-Veda and Vedangas/ Yoga- Yogaanga / Upayaoga - Viniyoga' disciplines. This is the bridge that has suffered damage in Vedic studies/ Tantra studies by keeping out the ' Yoga aspects of Vak-Yoga;Samskrutham' as Vedanga. And the entry to this discipline is through ' Correction of Sounds Articulation' and ' understanding what it means as inner resonance with the cosmic processes'.  When one is able to experience 'Devanagari Varna maalaa' as ' Sounds of Shiva-Shakti :: unified harmonized Vibrations of Energy- Consciousness Combine (much touted as  Kundalini awakening) then the journey of veda to Tantra as an application will commence. This in essence is first seven chapters of Prapancha Saara and several works of Tantra. Much to be learnt from Mastres and in person; not for public forum debate.
