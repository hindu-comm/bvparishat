Shri Venkatraghavan ji,

Your information is related to tantrik bija mantras, which are to be recited anulom bijamantra ..Then the concerned mantra ... viloma bijamantra. This bija mantra is like bracket \[  \]. This is called sampurta in mantra shastra, and it speeds up desired results. People generally don't trust other's experience. So it is better to try yourself to judge the effect. You can choose a mantra and it's bija mantra as per your wish, with the help of expert. I have positve experiences, but only with mahamrityunjay mantra with samputa.

Rajkumari Trikha
