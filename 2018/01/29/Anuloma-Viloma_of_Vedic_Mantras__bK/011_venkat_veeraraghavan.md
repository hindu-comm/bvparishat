Dear Sir,

  

I am genuinely confused by your answer.

  

When I read this response from your esteemed self, I only end up more confused than before.

  

This is not some fault I am trying to ascribe to yourself, but it is my own ignorance.

  

You write:

**Technically, Traditionally and Practically : There (may be / will be ) are such practices / OR the Atharva model will be adapted appropriately in practice.**  

  

**\>\>There may be / will be/ are => Which of the 3 is it in your personal experience? Because the follow up questions vary in each case and this thread is likely to become very complicated if I devise an "if then else" loop to cover all 3 scenarios.**

**  
**

When \< svara-pratiloma takes place>, there is no more outbound ( Vaikhari) speech.  

  

--> Doesn't the AV parisishta indicate that svara is not reversed, is there an alternative verse somewhere that gives the rules for this reversal of svara? If so kindly give references pls.

Also, even in the anuloma chanting of rks, vaikhari is frequently transcended to madhyama and sometimes pashyanti vAk while doing japa. For ex: Gayatri japa is frequently done as upamsu or manasik and here the speech involution takes place with time and diligence of the sadhaka.

  

This is not a case of window shopping, but trying to make sense of jumbled information and lack of help from within traditions that are built towards adhyayana as opposed to yoga/tapascharya.

  

I can understand vaguely your comment about the yoga aspects having been separated from the bhasha. Do you have any practical pointers towards redressing this imbalance?

  

I am unsure what you mean by the following:

\>\>If the practitioner is ready to experiment and hurt themselves before hurting / helping others, go ahead and explore by all means ! It is a free world .

  

I have nowhere spoken about experimentation. Why then would I ask a question in the open forum?

  

I would appreciate it greatly if you can give some references from any of the texts you have quoted regarding such applications.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
