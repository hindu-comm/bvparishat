Dear Learned List members:

  

I was told by a Swamiji in Rishikesh that the chanting of mantras as anuloma-viloma gives faster siddhi.

  

Shri Gowtham Sarmaji was kind enough to refer me to the anulomakalpa a parisista of the atharvaveda. Are there similar rules for anuloma-viloma of vedic mantras in Rig/ Yajus/ Sama?

  

Has anyone in the list had prior experience with reversing vedic mantras and practicing with them?

  

Could you share your thoughts/ experience on these aspects please?

  

Thanks,

  

Veenkat
