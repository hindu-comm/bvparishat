People like Sarma Sastrigal etc. are the oasis in desert considering the present turmoil, disturbances and Dravidian hatred politics in TN.
Currently, TN is undergoing a very bad phase of dirty hatred politics.

  

I have great respect for Sastrigal and he is succeeding in his mission with the grace of Mahaperiya. Sastrigal is conducting sensitisation programs & orientation classes to unmarried girls and married women on several behavioural aspects and dressing. Instances have been reported personally that after attending the seminar, ladies have taken to traditional dressing of maDisar and unmarried are sporting with kumkuma, bangles and paTTu vastram.

  

I pray to God that Sastrigal be endowed with good health and long life....

  

rgs,

sriram
