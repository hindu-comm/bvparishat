Hi,

  

I am currently working on a research project at IIT Kharagpurto perform OCR for Sanskrit written in the Roman diacritic font.

  

For this, if we can get a scanned digital copy of Bhagavatam/Gita which only contains the verses and shlokas, it will be easy to test it on the OCRas we have the ground truth with us.We are specifically avoidingbooks which also contains textual explanations along with shlokas.

  

It will be extremely beneficial for us if you could provide such digitally scanned copy of Bhagavatam/Gita. I am also cc-ing my co-authors here as well.

  

You help is much appreciated.

  

Thanks,

Bodhisattwa
