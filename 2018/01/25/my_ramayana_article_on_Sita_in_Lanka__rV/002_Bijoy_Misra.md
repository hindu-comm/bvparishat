Nagarajji,

  

We struggle abroad to help our children understand what we inherit.

My entry to Valmiki was pretty late, I see the power of education in him.

He had probably an idea of the role of women in the society.

He creates many strong women characters: Kaushalya, Sumitra,

Kaikeyi, Manthara, Tara, Surpanakha, Mandodari and Sita among them.

Only Lakshmana and Hanuman are strong among men. Rama's

strength is noticed only in reactions, Ravana is a failure.

  

I am grateful to BVP to have given me an opportunity to learn.

  

Best regards,

BM
