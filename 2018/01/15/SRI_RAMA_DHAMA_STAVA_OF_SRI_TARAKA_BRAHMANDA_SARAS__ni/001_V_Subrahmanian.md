Namaste

  

Thanks for sharing the pdf of these useful works. The Chapter 6 of Chandogya is called Sad vidya. Brahman in that Chapter is called Sat. So, if the revered author has tried to see the Bhuma vidya in the Ramayana, it goes without saying that all the other Nirguna Brahma Vidyas are also included in that. For, Bhuman is another name for Brahman.

  

One can also study the Sri Rama Bhujanga Stotram of Shankaracharya, where Rama is considered as Nirguna Brahman ultimately:

  

  

Bhujangaprayatham Param Veda Saram,  
Mudha Ramachandrasya Bhakthya Cha Nithyam,  
Padan Santhatham Chinthayan Prantharange,  
**Sa Eva Swayam Ramachandra** Sa Dhanya. 29
