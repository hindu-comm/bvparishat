To Sri. V.Subramanian,

Thank you very much ,sir, for the quick response and clarification.

Shri Sankara Baghavadpada in his work -श्रीरामभुजङ्गप्रयात्स्तोत्रं ,mentions about the state in Bhuma Vidya as-

विशुध्दं परं सच्च्चिदानन्दरूपं

गुणाधारमाधाराहीनं वरेण्यम्।

महान्तं विभान्तं गुहान्तं गुणान्तं

सुखान्तं स्वयं धाम रामं प्रपद्ये ॥

In this opening verse itself, Acharys brings out all the attributes of Nirguna Brahman.

The last pada ofthis verse सुखान्तं स्वयं धाम रामं प्रपद्ये - सुखान्तं -the state of BHUMA , स्वयं धाम रामं- the self illuminating prakasha SriRama -explains the attributes of brahman.

So in the concluding verse also he confirms this.

This is in agreement with Sri Taraka Brahmananda Sarasvati’s interpretation of Sri Rama.

I agree that all the vidyas mentioned in Chandogya lead to the realisation of brahman and Bhuma Vidya is one such path.

After reading the commentary in Tamil by Brahmasri S.V.Radhakrishna Sastrigal, I thought that there must be some reason for singling out BHUMA VIDYA by the composer of SRI RAMA DHAMA STAVA.

As I understand ,Acharya Shankara Baghavadpada describes any deity as “ PARA BRAHMAN” and this is essence of Advaita Vedanta.

With regards
