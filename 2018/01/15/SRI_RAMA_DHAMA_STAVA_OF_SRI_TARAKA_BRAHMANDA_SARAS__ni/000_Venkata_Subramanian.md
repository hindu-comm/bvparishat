Sri Taraka Brahmananda Sarasvati, who lived in 18th century in South India had composed a hymn “ SRI RAMA DHAMA STAVA”- WITH HIS OWN COMMENTARY ON TAITTRIYA UPANISHAD SARA PRAKASIKA. This hymn has 38 verses as commentary on Anandavalli portion of the Upanishad.This hymn is taken from the book” SRI RAMA STUTI MANJARI” Published by Sri Vighneswara Venkateswara Trust Chennai. Sri S,V RADHAKRISHNA SASTRIGAL had given a detailed commentary of the verses in TAMIL.

Sri Taraka Brahmananda Sarasvati was a great Advaita Vedanta scholar.He had explained the Valmiki Ramayanam from Advaita point of view. According to him, Sri Rama is Brahman, Sri Sita is Jivatma and Sri. Hanuman is the Acharya. Sri Govindaraja also has similar views but explains from Visishtadvata point of view.

Sri Taraka Brahmananda Sarasvati identifies Sri Rama as brahman -explained in Taittriya upanishad and also presumably reaching Him- by BHUMA VIDYA(explained in detail in 7th chapter of Chandogya upanishad). In verses 16 to 24, he ends the verses as “तद् भूमाख्यं ,रामधाम प्रपद्ये)

A pdf of this hymn is attached for reference.

Another pdf of Ramayana Sankshepa also is attached. This is a detailed commentary on ist sarga of BALAKANDA- well known as “संक्षेप रामायणं or नारद वाक्यं”The auhtor of this work also mentions about BHUMA VIDYA ( please see pages 3,29 and 30).

Chandogya Upanishad mentions -BHUMA VIDYA AND DAHARA VIDYA IN CHAPTERS 7 &8.

  

I wish to know as to SRIMAD VALMIKI RAMAYANAM mentions only BHUMA VIDYA .

Does it mention other vidhyas also?

Scholars of this forum may be able to throw light on this point.
