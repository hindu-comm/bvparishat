To Shri Madhav Deshpande,

Thank you very much for pointing out the topographical errors in the document sent.

I will verify and correct the errors and resend the document.

Since I did not have time to re-read the document typed (perhaps no patience on my part and being a novice in typing), the errors have crept in.

Please allow me some time to verify the document and carry out corrections, where ever necessary and make the document a readable one.

Once again I express my thanks to you

With regards

N.S.VENKATA SUBRAMNIAN,
