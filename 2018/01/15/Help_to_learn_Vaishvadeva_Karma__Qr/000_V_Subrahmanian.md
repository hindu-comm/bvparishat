Namaste

  

A grihastha friend is inclined to learn the Vaishvadeva karma (a nitya karma meant for householders) as per Yajurveda. Anyone who can teach him in Bangalore would be a great help to him. Also the appropriate text in Kannada or Devanagari script is also required. Help from the scholars of this forum is thankfully acknowledged.
