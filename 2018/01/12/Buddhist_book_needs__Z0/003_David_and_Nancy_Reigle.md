Dear Sri Dwivedi,  
  

The Yogācārabhūmi is a huge text, much of which has not yet been recovered in its original Sanskrit. As may be seen in its Chinese and Tibetan translations, it consists of five major parts. The Viniścayasaṃgrahaṇī is the second of these five major parts. Only small fragments of the Viniścayasaṃgrahaṇī in the original Sanskrit have so far been recovered. Virtually none of parts three, four, and five of the Yogācārabhūmi in the original Sanskrit have been recovered. However, we are more fortunate with the first and primary part of the Yogācārabhūmi, the so-called maulī-bhūmi. This consists of seventeen sections or bhūmis. Almost the whole of this was discovered by Rāhula Sāṅkṛtyāyana on his trips to Tibet in search of Sanskrit manuscripts in the 1930s.  
  
Sections or bhūmis one through five were edited by Vidhushekhara Bhattacharya and published in 1957 as *The Yogācārabhūmi of Ācārya Asa**ṅga*, Part 1, University of Calcutta. I have posted a scan of this here: <http://www.downloads.prajnaquest.fr/BookofDzyan/Sanskrit%20Buddhist%20Texts/yogacarabhumi_chapters_1-5_1957.pdf>  
  
Most of the other sections or bhūmis have been published individually in various publications, which would take too much space to list here. Two of these bhūmis, however, circulated as separate texts in old India: the śrāvaka-bhūmi (section thirteen), and the bodhisattva-bhūmi (section fifteen).  
  

The śrāvaka-bhūmi was first published in 1973 by the K. P. Jayaswal Research Institute, Patna, edited by Karunesha Shukla, as *Śrāvaka-bhūmi of Ācārya Asa**ṅga*. This is probably available online somewhere. Part II of this was published 1991, containing introduction, appendices and indices. A new and improved edition of the śrāvaka-bhūmi prepared by the Śrāvaka-bhūmi Study Group of Taisho University in Tokyo is being published in Japan in parts since 1981.  
  

The bodhisattva-bhūmi was also published by the K. P. Jayaswal Research Institute, Patna, in 1966, edited by Nalinaksha Dutt, with a second edition in 1978. I have posted the first edition here: <http://www.downloads.prajnaquest.fr/BookofDzyan/Sanskrit%20Buddhist%20Texts/bodhisattvabhumi_1966.pdf>. An earlier edition was prepared by Unrai Wogihara and published in Japan in two volumes, 1930 and 1936. I have posted these here: <http://www.downloads.prajnaquest.fr/BookofDzyan/Sanskrit%20Buddhist%20Texts/bodhisattvabhumi_vol_one_1930.pdf>; <http://www.downloads.prajnaquest.fr/BookofDzyan/Sanskrit%20Buddhist%20Texts/bodhisattvabhumi_vol_two_1936.pdf>.  
  

Regarding the Ratnagotravibhāga-vyākhyā, this was included in the edition of the Ratnagotravibhāga prepared by E. H. Johnston and published by the Bihar Research Society, Patna, in 1950. My scan of this is posted here: <http://www.downloads.prajnaquest.fr/BookofDzyan/Sanskrit%20Buddhist%20Texts/ratnagotravibhaga_1950.pdf>. I have also posted another edition of this text published in Japan, and various indices published separately, with the Sanskrit Buddhist texts at: <http://prajnaquest.fr/blog/sanskrit-texts-3/sanskrit-buddhist-texts/>.  
  

As pointed out by Shankaraji, the Mahāyānottaratantra-śāstra is simply another name for the Ratnagotravibhāga.  
  

The Saṃdhinirmocana-sūtra remains mostly lost in the original Sanskrit. Only small fragments have so far been recovered.  
  

Best regards,
