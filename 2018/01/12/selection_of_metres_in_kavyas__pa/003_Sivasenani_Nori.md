Sir

  

Earlier kavyas were read out aloud. As such, end of a chapter was not immediately apparent. So different conventions were developed to signify the end of a chapter. One technique is to repeat the last lines at the end of a chapter - say the last name of Vishnu's thousand names सर्वप्रहरणायुधः is repeated at the end. We see this mostly in stotras and songs. A brilliant take on this is seen in Panini's AshTadhyaayee, wherein the last Sutra is अ अ॥ This both signifies the end of the work and also restores अ to its intended pronunciation (i.e. of being a samvrita).

  

Another technique is to change the metre. For example, if you listen to Adityahridayam - you will find a change in metre in the last Sloka; this change in recitation is immediately apparent to a listener. In some kavyas, this changed metre extends to two or three padyas as well (This was already said by Sri Vishwas - I am elaborating in English, just in case his import was missed). Another technique is the recitation of chapter-end colophon. We see this in Gita: "इति श्रीमद्भगवद्गीतासूपनिषत्सु ब्रह्मविद्यायायां योगशास्त्रे कृष्णार्जुनसंवादे सांख्ययोगो नाम द्वितीयोऽध्यायः"

  

There is another use of metre. My grandfather, Br. Ve. Nori Narasimha Sastry garu wrote a play in Telugu called BhagavataavataaraNam where the four disciples of Vyasa speak in

different metres - signifying their differences - and then speak in one metre, signifying the resolution of differences.
