Dear All,

  

**Dr. Vishwa Adluri**will be speaking on

**"The Mahābhārata: The Principal Monument to Bhakti"**

The talk will be for an hour and a half duration (6 pm to 7.30 pm)

followed by Questions and Answers.

  

Venue:**Indian Institute of World Culture, Wadia Hall.**

Date :**14th August (Tuesday), 2018**

Time:**6 pm**

  

**About the Topic:**

The Mahābhārata has been approached typically under one of two rubrics: either history or myth. In this lecture, Professor Vishwa Adluri shows why neither approach does justice to the Sanskrit work’s transformative intellectual-aesthetic project of making Brahman cognitively accessible and experientially relatable in its saguṇa form—as Nārāyaṇa and Hari.

  

**About the Speaker:**

Vishwa Adluri is a Professor in the Philosophy Department at Hunter College, New York. He holds PhDs in Philosophy, Indology, and Sanskrit, and has published monographs, and edited volumes and articles on the Mahābhārata. Together with Joydeep Bagchee, he is the author of The Nay Science: A History of German Indology (OUP India, 2017) and Philology and Criticism: A Guide to Mahābhārata Textual Criticism (Anthem, 2018).

  

The speaker has worked on the Mahabharata for over 15 years.  

Hehas academically confronted many Western distortions of the great work.
