Shubh Prabhat.

  

In current turbulent business environment 'Leadership' is one of the most talked about topic and scary as well.  

  

Considering different traits and attributes of leader there are so many literature and thoughts from 'WEST' is available on this area.

Like John C Maxwell, Marshall, Greenleaf etc.  

  

I'm curious to know is there any similar kind of literature available in old Indian wisdom or some extended work from some scholars on those old Indian wisdom which talks about 'Leadership' and it's traits, attributes in details.

  

PS.- I'm aware about Dr. Ghosh and Dr. Poojan's book on Srimad Bhagwad Gita in context of leadership.
