There is some context behind the pradosha vrata:

  

Pauranically ekadashi was the day halahala was released during samudra manthan, while esoterically in the yogic tradition, ekadashi is the tithi when certain toxins are released in the system. This is why upavasa is prescribed in all traditions.

  

In the Tamizh siddha tradition, it is believed that using amalaki and agathi keerai (a type of spinach hard to digest by humans but much loved by cows) to break upavasa at parana on dvadashi tithi helps to digest this poison and transmute it into amrita. This amrita makes your mind one pointed and focuses prana.

Pauranically it is believed that dwadashi was the tithi on which amrita was obtained.

  

Now the twilight of next day's tithi trayodashi is called pradosha because it is a period of great opportunity to further progress spiritually by worshipping Siva and Shakti. It is said that even small mistakes and faux pas get magnified during those 3 hours of twilight, so the best way of spending that time is by meditating on the panchakshari.

  

The pradosha kala is a bit like grahana without the asoucha rules. It is best spent in meditation and avoiding negative vibes and activities that lead to negativity.
