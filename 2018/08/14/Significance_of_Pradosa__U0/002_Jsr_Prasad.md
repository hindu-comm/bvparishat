Sri Veeraraghavan ji, illustrated it very right.  

  

After consuming the haalaahala, Shiva feels drowsy. He takes rest on maa Parvati's lap at a place called Surutupalli near Nagalapuram in present Andhrapradesh. On trayodasi day, having approached by the devatas, Shiva performs Sivatandavam. That moment is said to be celebrated as 'pradosham.' Every fortnight, people from Tamilnadu and Andhra throng in numbers to perform abhishekam to Nandeeswara. The leading deity is called '[Pallikondeeswara Swamy](https://www.templepurohit.com/palli-kondeswarar-temple-surutapalli-lord-shiva-sleeping-posture/).'  

The big Nandi statue near the entrance of temple, is a delight to see, alongside many rare moorthis inside the temple.  

  

probably it is the only temple in the world, where one can see Shiva has a form and reclining in the sanctum-sanctorum. Performing pujas on pradosham day, considered to be very very auspicious. I had a chance to visit this temple, recently.
