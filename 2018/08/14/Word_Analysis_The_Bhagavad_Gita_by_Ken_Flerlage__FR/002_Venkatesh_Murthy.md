Namo Vidvadbhyaha

  

Very Interesting and Very Helpful. The Top 3 Words in Gita are Arjuna, Supreme, Knowledge. This is telling us a very important thing. Gita is addressed to a person like Arjuna and like us and it is for us to gain the Supreme Knowledge - Brahma Jnana. This is the most important message of Gita. Nahi Jnanena Sadrusham. न हि ज्ञानेन *सदृशं* पवित्रमिह विद्यते. This is the most important message of Gita, no doubt. Other messages like Bhakti are also important but less important than Jnana. Gita is a book of Knowledge.
