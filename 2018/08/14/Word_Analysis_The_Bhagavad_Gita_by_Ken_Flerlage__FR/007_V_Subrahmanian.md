There used to be a word-search in Devanagari for Bhagavadgita in the Gitasupersite of IITK. In alphabetical order one could view each word in the Gita and go to the verse from the selected word. Now the feature is absent in that site. I have made a request by this voice mail to them. I shall await their reply:
