Subject:Incorrect attribution of authorship

Though the author of the book has been shown here as Dr S.M.Katre, a perusal of the introductory part of the book clearly shows it as the creation of Rao Bahadur P.C.Divanji, a judicial officer in the the Bombay Presidency of pre-independance India. Dr Katre has added an introduction to the book.
