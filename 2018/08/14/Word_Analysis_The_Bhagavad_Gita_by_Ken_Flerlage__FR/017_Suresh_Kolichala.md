Dear all,

  

I had written programs in the past to analyze the common words and phrases in the Bhagavad Gita and Anugita to present an inter-textual analysis between these texts (in 2011). Unfortunately, I do not have the programs with me now. However, by quickly downloading the Gita text from the website suggested by Amba Kulkarni, and using the cloud generation program provided by Pradyumna Achar, I could quickly generate the following word-clouds, chapter by chapter.

Click on each chapter number to get the word-cloud generated for that chapter. Obviously we have to change the program to exclude the frequently occurring *avyayas*such as *tu*, *ca*, *manyē*, etc.and other non-descriptive pronominal and nominal stems.

  

You can see all word counts for all chapters in this simple text file sorted by the frequency:
