The main challenges will be in

1\. Typing the gita text, or obtaining an already typed version from a source generous enough to provide permission/license to re-use,

2\. Performing पदच्छेद

3\. Adding विसर्ग at appropriate places

4\. Converting anusvaara and makaara appropriately

  

i.e., "किमकुर्वत" should be treated as two words किम्, अकुर्वत

"समवेता युयुत्सवः" should be considered as the two words समवेताः, युयुत्सवः  

"किं and किम्" should be considered duplicates of each other as far as word analysis is concerned.

  

Subsequent to this, the programming part is relatively straightforward.

I will attempt a first version of this tomorrow, as it is a holiday and I will have some free time.
