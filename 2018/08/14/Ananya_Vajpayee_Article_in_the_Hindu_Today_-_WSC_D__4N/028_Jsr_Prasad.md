Srini ji,

  

I do not know, whether this discussion is leading to some other views than the actual purpose of the thread.

  

What I understood from your response is that an organization called RSS can not think (probably bankrupt of think tanks?) and only glorifies the glorious past.  

  

In the link that I suggested, Late Vajpayee Ji, one of the very few straight forward, steadfast, patriotic and intellectual politician, refers to some of his predecessors like Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyay and others. One need not to educate how the RSS ideology was banking upon the intellectuality of the like of Pt. Deen Dayal ji and others. BJP, the modified version of Janasangh, is nurtured and molded by Vajapeeyi ji, with a strong vision and mission. However, Sri Advani ji joined, helped to build it a lot. In effect, today what we see is the Prez, VP, PM, Speaker - LS, entire cabinet, CMs of 22 states, Governers of 30 states (are equipped with RSS training). How can one forgets the Pokhran tests done very boldly while maintaining a high confidentiality by Vajpayee govt. During Kargil war, Pak threatened us that they can bomb us with a nuclear weapon, if the army don't pull off. Vajpayee ji firmly, reportedly told that by next day morning, Pak will not there be in the world map. Except Indira during Bangla war, no other PM has shown so much of firmness. So far, in RSS, we saw that all the Sar Sangh Chalak appointed are highly educated.  

  

Dr. Ambedkar, MK Gandhi openly appreciated the cast free volunteerism in Sangha. This was documented.  

  

Dr. Gurumurthy, Dr. Swaminathan, Dr. Subramanian Swamy and others are, indeed, a think tank supporting the age old ideologies of the sangha. There might be many other unsung heroes there. Recently, Sri Ratan Sharda published a book titled 'RSS 360.' It narrates the inside view of the RSS.  

  

Believe me, even i never went a 'saakhaa.' Nor I subscribe to any political ideology. This is purely a common man's response.

  

A request, if your kind self or any other member wants to discuss more about this point, then, kindly open a new thread in that regard. I am stopping on this point, in this thread.  

  

Thanks
