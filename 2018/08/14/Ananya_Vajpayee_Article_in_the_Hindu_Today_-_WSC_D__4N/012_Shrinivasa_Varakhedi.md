Thanks to all scholars for their responses and inputs.

  

As prof. Rukmani pointed out, we should respond to the article in right place. I request Dr: Anuradha or Dr. Shivani who were present in the forum venue and had good exchanges with the author to write a rejoinder.

  

I will also contribute to the write up. Other scholars will also help with more inputs.

  

Hope this will work.

  

Warm regards,

Shrinivasa Varakhedi
