in this scenario ananyvajapeyi kind of arrive and say that" there is contradiction in answer and practicality.so answer is not correct as majoritarian are not accepting it practically". they show us stories,experiences to prove there point. so thats why RSS kinds of major Hindu organisation need "think tanks" to find practical answers to these questions. i read wonderful article on this<https://swarajyamag.com/ideas/the-rss-must-build-a-massive-venture-capital-fund-to-win-the-narrative-war>.

  

RSS can not think. RSS and more particularly, its forerunners like the Hindu Mahasabha can not think. All they could do and still do is express a form of 'loss of empire' anxiety, originally a Pune disease which in time was successfully exported to the rest of India.

  

How can you wage a narrative war, leave alone win it, without a basic framework of thought on which there is broad agreement between likeminded folks. It has to be an agreement beyond 'the Glory that was India' or 'hum kitne mahan the'. I may be excused for my bad Hindi as it was not the language sung at my cradle nor was any form of Sanskrit, classical or any niSThA-laden pidgin, for that matter. Where are our set of universal principles which we agree upon? Do we have such a body of thought? Have we made forward progress since Swami Vivekananda, Aurobindo and Gandhi? This is India's intellectual crisis.

  

The great unwashed among the academic community may revel at BJP's electoral success that 'our time has come'. But the serious minded may still have to think deep thoughts. Can Swarajya mag's wished for money and RSS leadership buy quality thought? It could produce Desi Indology Release 2.0, one which is not so obsessed with English as is its predecessor. Can India made Clark's patent leather shoes cure polio? I am waiting for a well funded think tank to puzzle out this one.

  

Cheers,

  

Srini
