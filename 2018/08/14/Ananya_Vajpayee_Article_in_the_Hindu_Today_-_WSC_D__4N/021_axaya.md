\> Vidwan Srinidhi ji,

\> Thanks for sharing a video link of Dr. Kaushal and a link to swarajyamag article. I am yet to watch it. Seemingly RSS may have or may not have political linkages, but what they say is not different from the  
\> shaastra. At the same time, one cannot vouchsafe entire responsibility of removing caste evil to RSS, an NGO. Hence, what you said - 'then we need to openly accept that thousands of year original text were  
\> misinterpreted and we were following ill practice' becomes a reality. What we see and discuss now, is it not part of a big conspiracy, in the name of indological translations and deliberate  
\> mis-interpretations? Yes, we understand what it mean exactly. One of the members said it right, 'data' vs 'belief/experience.'  
  

I'm the member being alluded to here; my intent was to point out dialectical issues - not quite what has been said so far.  
I'd like to point out a few observations (none of them mine in particular),  
  
- Ambedkar in his MA thesis notes that the only definitive characteristic of 'caste' is endogamy.  
- Ambedkar in the 'Annihilation of Caste' (AoC) acknowledges that practices of endogamy are widespread within both Christianity and Islam,  
both in India and outside it. He was not the first, some early Protestant and Jesuit missionaries thought similarly.  
- Ambedkar notes that 'Hindu endogamy' is 'deplorable' over these because it is governed by a belief in the śāstra.  
This is also the position arrived at by the missionaries, after they 'realized' that caste is inherent to 'Hinduism' (cf. False religion).  
- It is noted that śāstra is written by brāhmaṇa and therefore he is the person responsible for misguiding people (cf. Catholic priests).  
- Hindu 'religion' are mere (man-made) rules not 'principles', and thus 'deplorable'.  
- brāhmaṇa forms a 'tribe' (cf. Levite priests)  
- śāstra is seen as responsible for the creation of 6000+ castes in India.  
- There are thus, rules in the śāstra for every 'caste' instructing them atleast on which caste to not marry.  
- Th assertion being made is that there is a 'system' of laws (cf. the current Judicial system), where corrupt priests make (false) laws  
and control the 'laity'. The 'laity' is controlled by making the assertion that these laws are 'God' given - following them is necessary  
for 'salvation'.  
- This is why 'destruction' of 'brāhmaṇa' is necessary, and inter-caste marriage must be made mandatory, in order to eradicate the 'caste  
system'.  
  
Is there such a 'system' in India ? Is this more 'practical' over the 'meritorious chaturvarnya'.  
  
The theological notions of 'false religion' which are at the root of such assertions continue today in the secularized form today: 'religion'  
becomes 'culture or civilization', but none of the associated epistemologies change, because of the internal consistency to the system of reasoning.  
  
This is precisely why a similar system for 'women' is the current object of Indology's quest. As the article attached previously notes, crime  
stastistics are actually often an order of magnitude lower in India; India's IT industry is also noted as being more gender neutral than SV.  
However, India being the land of 'false religion' must necessarily mean that Indian women are treated worse, because the śāstra compells them to.  
This is all secularized of course - talking about 'religion' has been politically incorrect for some time.  
  
The mode of argument 'we have a few experiences that will nullify yours' will not work fully, because there is no opposing theory for it to support.  
It'll be seen as being merely incidental - no doubt a benign influence of European civilization. This happens with crime stastistics w.r.t women; it  
has happenned with crime stastistics w.r.t SC/STs too - the rate of crime is about \~20 times lower than non SC/STs. Such data is ignored (when convenient)  
because it is 'unreliable', 'underreported' and most importantly because the numbers don't capture how 'oppresively' people are treated. You'll note that  
this was also the object of 'The Economist' 's criticism recently. The mode 'your nation/race/... is equally if not worse' will not work either:  
the Americans and Europeans are not being \*compelled\* to act on false beliefs. You (we) are.  
  
These views are based on S.N Balagangadhara's work. This thesis was first presented in the 'Heathen in his Blindness'. This book however is far too  
dense; there is a more accessible introduction called 'ಬೌದಿಕ ದಾಸ್ಯದಲ್ಲಿ ಭಾರತ' by Prof. Rajaram Hegde. There are others which deal with other issues,  
  
<https://www.palgrave.com/de/book/9783319387604>  
<https://india.oup.com/product/europe-india-and-the-limits-of-secularism-9780199460977>  
  
(Prof. Vishwa Adluri's work is also converging to similar lines of thought.)  
  
Some necessary disclaimers. It is not being denied here that certain people are ill-treated on the basis of caste, gender and economics. The Indian  
state itself, along with its intellectual retainers, has imposed/continued an organized system of 'linguistic apartheid' on this deśa, and we are  
perfectly happy with this 'caste system' (though of course, in the above value system it's not as 'corrupt').  
  
It is also not a conspiracy theory - conspiracies require intent. It'd be silly to say someone planned this 300 y ago - it'd mean that they actually  
had access to the 'truth'. The West has always dealt with with alien cultures this way. This is merely their experience of India - the question is why  
is their experience the object of 'scientific truth', on which our society must be based.
