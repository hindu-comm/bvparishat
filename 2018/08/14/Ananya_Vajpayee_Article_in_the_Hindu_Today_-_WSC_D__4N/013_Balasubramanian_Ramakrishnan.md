I was a little reluctant to comment on this - taking my cue from sureshvarAchArya on his initial reluctance to express his thoughts in the naiShkarmya-siddhi - sahasra-kiraNa-vyApte khadyotaH kiM prakAshayet. But it's been nagging at the back of my head, so here goes:

  

1\. I personally think it would be better to just unconditionally accept whatever life experience which the panelists have quoted, e.g., the mImAmsA studies issue, discrimination, etc. Part of the issue is that when counter-examples of different experiences by other women in the field are immediately cited, it may seem to the other side that their life experience is being questioned. Especially, given the fact that there is some element of suspicion on both sides of the aisle as to motivations. The bigger issue is what does a panel like this seek to achieve? The motivation of such panels should ideally be "What is the way forward, given these things happened to me?". Do they think this is the experience of all women? Do the panelists think that the system is so corrupt it can't be changed? Do they think there is anything worthwhile to be "salvaged" in Sanskrit studies or should Sanskrit studies be done only to complain about "sociological evils" "propagated" by Sanskrit? Have they done an objective survey of what the current situation is, etc., etc.? Unfortunately the panelists do not seem to have addressed any such topic. While personal experiences are certainly valuable to discuss, that alone cannot be the theme in a panel in a conference like the WSC. I would blame whoever ok'd this panel for not taking a pro-active role here in determining subject flow - surely they should have anticipated some blow-back.

  

2\. I personally think the discussions on texts such as Rama's treatment of Sita, etc., derailed the panel discussions. I just don't think these can be discussed in a panel setting. If the claim of the panel is misogyny in Sanskrit texts (even accepting their interpretations), every other religion has the same issue, some way worse! So there's no point in tying Sanskrit studies or the language to misogyny, at best it can be ascribed to a male dominated power structure expressing themselves through Sanskrit. What does Sanskrit as a language have to do with this issue in particular? And that is indeed my point 3.

  

3\. The more important issue here is the issue of kAka-tAliiya-nyAyaH or the post-hoc ergo propter-hoc problem using a different terminology. What does gender discrimination in Sanskrit studies mean really? Given the fact that gender discrimination exists in every conceivable field, are the panelists saying that studying Sanskrit makes men more prone to discriminating against women? If so, how do they propose to prove it scientifically? Just because A happens in the presence of B, A = gender discrimination, B = Sanskrit studies, does not mean B caused A. There is also an inherent truthiness (word popularized by the comedian Colbert) in statements like those of Profs. Truschke and Vajapayee. They seem to be feeding an anti-Hindu audience with what they want to hear. Here's something that they should know. There's a professor of South Asian Studies in Georgetown, Prof. Christine Fair, who has written about how she was harassed by Dr. Subaltern - Dipesh Chakraborty in U Chiacgo and Sheldon Pollock who was the South Asian Studies chair at that time refused to help her out (see<https://www.buzzfeed.com/christinefair/himtoo-a-reckoning?utm_term=.ke1BYg5Yo#.qjVG7xZ7E>). You might also know about the Berkeley Tamil chair fiasco. I have read many other blogs by Sanskrit post-docs in the US on harassment at Columbia, etc. Here's a man ascribing fascism to a "language" and when he is in a position of power does nothing to help women. Perhaps Pollock's reading Sanskrit made him a silent accomplice?!! List-members may or may not know that in the Indology list (decade+ back) a member Steve Farmer essentially said all Indians are bad programmers (I am not exaggerating here) and write bad computer code. He claimed India is a nation \*full\* of bad computer programmers. BTW, an Ivy league professor came to back him up. There was not a single dissenting voice except my friend Vidyasankar Sundaresan. Profs. Truschke et. al should first clean house before going to "help" other nations. Indologists in general should first solve racism and sexism in their own back-yard before offering their services elsewhere. This much is clear to me.

  

4\. An instance which really angered me (this panel actually not so much, my gripe is only as detailed in 1) was the loud questioner after the kUDiyATTam lecture-demonstration where he asked the lady to talk about gender discrimination in kUDiyATTam. Luckily the lady said that she personally had no problems and explicitly mocked the use of sub-altern theories to study the situation of Indian artistes. I really wanted to go the guy and ask him "Did you inhale a cylinder of stupid just before you came in or are you just naturally stupid?" - seriously! How dumb/hypocritical are you when you have literally 1000s of show-biz women in the US complaining about discrimination on TV, twitter, facebook, etc., including an \*\*A-list\*\* TV actress complaining about assault \*on set\* (see<https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/05/pauley-perrette-ncis-exit-multiple-physical-assaults-allegations>). When there are unscrupulous men in power, there are these issues. That much should be clear. This has nothing to do with Sanskrit or Indic art traditions, except in a tangential way. Why are all these dumb people writing stupid papers using sub-altern or whatever other nonsense they can come up with and trying to pigeonhole an entire culture? See also the previous article by Prof. Fair where she says she dropped out of the Harvard chemistry program because of sexism. Is this a chemistry issue or an unscrupulous men issue? If you want to claim that this is a Hindu/Sanskrit issue or that they are exacerbating things, you need to prove it, not just trot out vague theories and just personal experiences. You need to control so many variables that it may not even be practical.  
  
I should probably stop here :-).
