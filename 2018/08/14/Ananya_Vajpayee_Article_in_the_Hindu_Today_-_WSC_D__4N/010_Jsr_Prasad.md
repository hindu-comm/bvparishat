Respected Prof. Rukmani madam,

  

It is a pleasure to see your reply and thanks much for expressing your valuable views! I totally agree, perhaps others too. I had an experience with a Telugu news paper, while sending a rejoinder to Prof. Kancha Ilaiah's article. They did not publish it, in spite of a reminder. The problem is some websites, some news media project and glorify one section/category of views only. Now, some of us will give a try with the Hindu paper, and see whether they really are unbiased towards any rejoinders.  

  

Best regards,

Prasad
