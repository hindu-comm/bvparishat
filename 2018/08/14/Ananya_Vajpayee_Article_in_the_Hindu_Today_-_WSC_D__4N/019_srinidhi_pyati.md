I have posted it because J r s prasad sir expressed that he want to know her views on these subjects [and.as](http://and.as) there are no book available,i found this may help to understand her style of thinking ( specially who haven't went to WSC.).

The point raised by you (Nagaraj sir) is very important and answer lies in her interview(,as she says)" many scholars are not comfortable to openly talk about women's position in vedas,smritis,dharmashastras. and no scholar is critical about these parts (especially shudra women position )". as the result who talks and criticize these parts will become ideological

friends.And these kinds of ideological backing make there bonding strong and they will never come back. If we examine this incident in broader way then question that raises is 'do we have a single majoritarian
answers to these questions,which could create a narrative? what we have as an answers are not practical, in the case of varna, majoritarian narrative is, that it is not based on birth,but this is not practical and will not be backed by dharmashastras. or if we find dharmashastra and smriti backings this answer ,then we need to openly accept that thousands of year original text were misinterpreted and we were following ill practice,.like in the case quran this kind of narrative is built by scholars to negate its ideological backing for terrorism. for last fifty years RSS has telling that varna is based on birth,but we are experiencing that majority of society is not accepting it practically. in this scenario ananyvajapeyi kind of arrive and say that" there is contradiction in answer and practicality.so answer is not correct as majoritarian are not accepting it practically". they show us stories,experiences to prove there point. so thats why RSS kinds of major Hindu organisation need "think tanks" to find practical answers to these questions. i read wonderful article on this
