I don't think 'data' is ever the point of contention in these 'debates'. If this were the case, wide spread 'polling' would've been conducted prior to the airing of such views.  
  
No, it's theology at play - you can't contradict 'beliefs', with 'data'. If you'll recall, this is an issue with the portrayal of women in India in particular, and of India in general.  
  
For reference, see this deconstruction of the recent Reuters survey which placed India as the most dangerous place for women on the planet.

If this were true, it'd serve to explain a lot of things, both past and present.
