First of all, thanks to Prof. Varakhedi ji for alerting members, by providing first hand information about this episode, a few days back!

  

I concur with last sentence of Ananya Vajpayee in the article. After all, who amongst us is not ready to join the movement, to remove the so-called 'caste' barrier?Because, we're not 'hypocrites.'  

  

However, her opening remark and closing remark are misleading, hence, analogy itself is wrong. If caste problem is juxtaposed to a gigantic mountain, which obstructs our progress, that is perfectly fine, because we've our own concerns as said before. However, mount Kailasa is said to be fixed, stationary, unlike other flying mountains in Krtayuga (ref to Indra in Sundara: पक्षान् चिच्छेद वज्रेण तत्र तत्र सहस्रशः।।); Ravana going on its way and commanding the mountain to get off from his way, is ridiculous. I'd have shed tears (in her own words) for Sri Madhu Margi Chakyar performing the act of Ravana as he is an accomplished artist, but not surely for Ravana as exemplified in real deeds. So, is not the analogy itself wrong.

  

She alleged that Sanskrit Professors, that day, made absurd claims about caste etc. As far as we are informed, all who responded, are reputed international scholars. Being student of a 'great' indologist, she only sees absurdity in them! Also, she mentions usage of the word 'harijan.' its vyutpatti is clear to any Sanskrit knowing person, isn't it? Nonetheless, she used another word representing a person belonging to scheduled castes - 'dalit.' Here, either she is not aware of its forbidden usage or forgotten, as seen in a recent judgment by the Hon'ble Bombay High Court.  

Some of other immature comments are:

  

//Many colleagues identified themselves as Hindus, giving primary allegiance to their “sacred texts”, not as Indians committed to egalitarian citizenship guaranteed by the laws of the land.//

  

//But in the age of Hindutva, outdated injunctions glorifying a hierarchical and unequal social order have risen again from the ashes.//  

  

It is amusing to read about remarks on caste, as if, like in science, was 'invented' by someone in the past. Ananya is a small player in a big game of some indologists.  

  

Regards
