Very apt and excellent example in Prof. Ujjvala madam, Prof. Paturi ji!

  

Yes, there are very few Meemamsaa scholars even in male category.  

  

Could one generalize Prof. Bose's personal experience, while feeling bad about her deprived of studying the desired shaastra. Kerala boasts of encouraging girls to study Nyaya, Vyakarana etc. What is more interesting is, I found most of them belong to Muslim, Christian communities!
