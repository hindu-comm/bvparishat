//Prof. Panwar’s moving and inspiring account of her own journey from manual scavenger in rural Haryana to Sanskrit professor in the capital, as told on the television show “Satyameva Jayate” (2012)...//

  

This is really inspiring. I watched that episode of SJ in 2012. Are not we proud of her? But it is intriguing to read that -

//That night Prof. Panwar analysed the low status of women and sudras in the *Manusmriti* and the *Rig Veda*.//
