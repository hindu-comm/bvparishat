Prof. Ujjvala Jha's CV

  

<http://www.unipune.ac.in/dept/fine_arts/centre_for_advanced_study_in_sanskrit/san_webfiles/pdf/Prof%20%20U%20Jha.pdf>

  

She is a Meemaamsaa scholar.

  

I request Prof. V N Jha who is on the list to convey my request to her to post on BVP her experience in studying Meemaamsaa

  

in the context of Dr Ananya's claim in the article,

  

" Prof. Bose described how as a young student in Kolkata, she was forced to switch from the study of Mimamsa (Vedic Hermeneutics) to Natyasastra (Performance and Aesthetics), because the former was considered a prestigious subject reserved for male scholars, while the latter was a lesser topic open to females. "

  

My observation is that Meemaamsaa has been an intimidating choice even for males. I know 11th century documentation where Meemaamsaa is absent among the s'aastras listed as being represented in a vidyaavilaasa goShThi.

  

It is not specifically reserved for males nor is it being currently in universities being specifically prohibited for women. Its intimidating nature has been found among both males and females.

  

Prof. Ujjvala Jha has been a role model for other women, why , even men, to take up the challenge.
