When an article of this nature appears in a respected Newspaper like The Hindu a number of readers form their opinion from that article. There is no point if we just exchange views amongst ourselves and point out the errors of the article to our BVP readers who in any case are supposed to be familiar with them. What needs to be done in my view is for a knowledgeable person ,of which there are many amongst the BVP members, to write to the same paper a rejoinder giving the other side of the picture, so that there will be a balanced understanding of the facts of the case. We Sanskritists often keep quiet when something like this happens and after venting our frustration amongst ourselves, let it die a natural death till the next time something like this happens

Hope this is taken in the spirit it has been written by a concerned individual.
