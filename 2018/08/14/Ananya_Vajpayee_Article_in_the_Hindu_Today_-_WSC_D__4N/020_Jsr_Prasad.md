Vidwan Srinidhi ji,

  

Thanks for sharing a video link of Dr. Kaushal and a link to swarajyamag article. I am yet to watch it. Seemingly RSS may have or may not have political linkages, but what they say is not different from the shaastra. At the same time, one cannot vouchsafe entire responsibility of removing caste evil to RSS, an NGO. Hence, what you said - '*then we need to openly accept that thousands of year original text were misinterpreted and we were following ill practice*' becomes a reality. What we see and discuss now, is it not part of a big conspiracy, in the name of indological translations and deliberate mis-interpretations? Yes, we understand what it mean exactly. One of the members said it right, 'data' vs 'belief/experience.'  

  

As suggested by Prof. Varakhedi ji, let Dr. Shivani, Dr. Anuradha and other scholars come up with a strong rejoinder in this specific instance. Members can add more inputs for a consolidation. In BVP, many such discussions happened before on several such issues.  

  

Particularly it is interesting to see young vidwans like you have a concern about these issues too, and write in a language that the other side 'understands.' Many more youngsters should come forward like you! We were not only looted for centuries together but culturally invaded and being invadedcontinuously now also. Confronting cultural
distortions at personal/team level shows that you stand for the protection and preservation of your dharma.  

  

Balasubramanian Ramakrishnan ji, has provided a great food for thought!
