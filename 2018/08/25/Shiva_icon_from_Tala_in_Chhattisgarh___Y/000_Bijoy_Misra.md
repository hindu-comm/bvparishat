Friends,

  

We don't talk much about iconography in this list. i met an old friend last week

who had excavated an area in Chhattisgarh while he served as the Collector

in the area in the '80s. He had art interest and then came to Harvard to do a

PhD degree. Dr. Kalyan Chakravarty returned to India and retired as the Director

General of the Art Museums. In Harvard he studied with late Prof Pramod Chandra

of Varanasi.

  

I am attaching the picture of the discovery below. He interprets it as an icon in

Pasupat cult stemming back to Harappa. He has produced a two volume

monograph entitled "Walking with Shiva" published from Delhi. I will post

a report of his seminar if there would be interest.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
