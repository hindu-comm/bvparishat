The interpretation of this image is fraught with difficulty, it seems to me. One person who has tried to put it into a context of related images and of textual sources is Hans Bakker, in his book The Vākāṭakas: An Essay in Hindu Iconology, Groningen: Egbert Forsten, 1997. Gonda Indological Studies, Vol. 5. Perhaps this is also of some use: <http://puratattva.in/2011/09/11/tala-the-riddle-of-an-icon-1080> .
