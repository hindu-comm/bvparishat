Dear Professor Paturi,

I am very pleased to read your question about Sri Radhaji.Vrindavana is the centre of Sri Krisna bhakti.Devotees belonging to

all schools have established their Asramas and mathas there.As far as I know all schools wordhip sriKrisna with Radha.There are various quotations relating to it are avl. In different puranas.DeviBhahavata,Padma,Skanda,Brahmavaivarta,etc.and Gargasamhita,Brahmasamhita,etc.many Pancharatra texts read that Radha and Krisna are two apparent forms of One and the single [Paramatmaa.Acc.to](http://Paramatmaa.Acc.to) the Gargasamhita the all 8 pataraanis are the manifest forms of sri Radhaji.She is not mentioned
only in the SrimadBhagavata which is explained by Mahatmas with diifferent views.Saguna Upasanaa is yugala Upasanaa.I have known that in some parts of India Rukmini and Vitthala are worshipped.Bhagavaan SriKrisna says on different occasions that if Radha is not happy I am never happy.The supernatural Goloka is here depicted with many legends popular in Vaisnava's homes.Similarly in sri SitaRam Upasanaa without sita's pleasure Ram is never pleased.This had been written by Karapatra Swami in his book titled Bhaktisudha.

Nothing more do I know.I am an ordinary man following Upasakas like you people.Please excuse me if I wrote something contrary to the Shastras.

Pranamami bhuyah.
