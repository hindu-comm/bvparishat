There are views ranging from

  

non-recognition of Radha as part of Bhagavata sampradaaya as there is no direct mention of the name in Srimadbhaagavata puraaNa

  

through acceptance of Radha as a concept but from outside
Srimadbhaagavata puraaNa

  

and through acceptance of Radha as a concept but from withinSrimadbhaagavata puraaNa interpreting a certain event in Rasalila as describing Radha only though name is not mentioned

  

to the view that Sri Krishna can not be without Radha and Radha is superior to Sri Krishna.

  

To my knowledge, in Gaudiya Vaishnava, Radha is taken as the aa**raadhy**ataa /aasvaadyataa in Sri Krishna and hence the idea of Sri Krishna without Radha is a misnomer.

  

-----------------------------------------

  

Prof. Deshpande , though Maadhva by family tradition, seems to be not following any 'Vaadabheda' to use the frequently used term from many Bhakti poets.

  

-----------

  

My intention was as Dr B V K Sastry said, not to ask the poet to follow a specific tradition.

  

----

  

Prof. Girish Jha too, as can be seen from his mails too saattvika to force any one to do anything.

  

It appears to be his abhinives'a for the primacy of Radha that made him express the way he did.
