Dear colleagues,  
Dharma and Bhakti start from the faith.Only that Tarka\[logic\] is  
permissible there which is approved by  
Veda-Shastras.Tarkaapratisthaanaat.// As far as the Srimad Bhagavata  
is concerned acc. to Indian Vaisnav Saints Shukadeva ji approached  
his father Veda Vyasa.He began to narrate the srimadBhagavata and as  
soon as Radha's name was pronounced Shukadeva reached the stage of  
Samaadhi.This is why Veda Vyasa removed Radha's name from the  
SrimadBhagavata.But in several contacts Radha is mentioned  
indirectly.During the Raasalilaa Gopis, looking for srikrisna, went to  
the middle part of the forest and found a particular Gopi sitting with  
tears in her eyes.VedaVyasa sings,  
" anayaaraadhito nunam Bhagavaan Harir iishvarah/ Yan no vihaaya  
govindah priityaa taam anayad rahah"  
  
Radha's name was removed but the root radh with upasarga "aa"has been  
used. In some other contexts the word raadhas ha been employed and  
somewhere Radha is remembered in different styles. In other  
Puranas such as Padma,Skanda,Brahmavaivarta,DeviBhagavata and the like  
Radha's name has been directly written.Many Pancharatra texts also  
read Radha's name directly.The Gargasamhita depicts Radha in detail.  
Radha and Krisna are anaadisiddha nitya divya dampatii in  
Goloke.WhenKrishna came to the Martyaloke Radha became the role model  
for devotion in parakiyaa bhaava. This is why Radha is not married to  
Krisna.Vaisnavas of different schools consider Radha their svaamini \[  
aadyaa aachaaryaa\]. In the Gagasamhita and some other texts  
there is a legend that many devotees expressed their desire to marry  
or embrace sri Ram. He prohibited them as he was Ekapatnivrata and  
inspired them to come to Dvaapara for Kaantaa bhaava.This is one of  
various reasons of Krisnaavataara.These things are the matter of firm  
belief.If you would try to prove these things on logic then the whole  
theism  
fall and scatter on the ground.  
Dear Indologists,I came to know this idea at the lotus feet of old  
saints.There are many other things and texts which I could not quote  
for fear of expansion.  
If my views are not acceptable please excuse me.
