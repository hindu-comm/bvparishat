आदरणीयाः माधवमहोदयाः,

  

पुनीतपदस्य presence in Monier Williams' & Apte'sdictionarieswas puzzling, along with MW mentioning the source as MBh. Thank you for the reference toBöhtlingk's along with his "Es ist wohl zu lesen". It not only points to the "possible source" for the MW entry, but also demonstrated to me, a student, the attention-to-detail of the lexicographers of the Wörterbuch.  

  

(And yes, the word पुनीत appears in Kannada & Tamil too)

  

इति सादरं,

\- सुदर्शनः
