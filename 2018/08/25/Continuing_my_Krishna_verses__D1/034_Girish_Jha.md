Dear Professor Deshpande,

I had expressed my humble suggestion about Radha ji.It's a matter of spiritual bliss and nothing else.As far as I know Radha is worshipped with Krisna everywhere.Your poetry is not a general one but it should be considered a devotional poetry.Hence my advice is not aimed at any narrow thinking but is to deepen the love emotion.A few years back Prof.Rasik vihari Joshi has also written a lot on Radha-Krisna Bhakti.Bhakti poetry has to be preserved within the bounds of Indian Culture.Nothing more to write.All are here Sanskrit Scholars.Jaya Radhe Shyama.Pranamaami punah punah.
