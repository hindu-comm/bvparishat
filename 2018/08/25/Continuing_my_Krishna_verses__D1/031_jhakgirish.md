Dear Professor Paturi,

I regret to inform you that since today Bharatiya Vidvat Parishat has ignored my membership as whenever I want to post my view clicking reply all it doesnot appear on the screen of my Computer or my Android Mobile phone.Until yesterday it was all right. I don't know any reason for it. I remember some years back you had changed my email Id on the request of Mr Vir N.Pandurangi for me.Without the pleasure of these shastraic discussions I would be sad.

I would like to request you to look into the matter and revive my membership. Just 1 hour back I posted a reply regarding Radha for the pleasure of you scholars.I am afraid it may have not been sent to your email addresses.

Kindest regards.
