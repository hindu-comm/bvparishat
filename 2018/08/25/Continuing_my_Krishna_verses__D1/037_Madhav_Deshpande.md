Continuing my Krishna verses

Krishna says to me:

  

अजानन् मां ममास्तित्वं नास्तीति यदि मन्यसे ।

कस्ते मतिं चोदयति क्षणं तत् त्वं विचिन्तय ।।५२२।।

Not knowing me, if you think that I don’t exist, think for a moment as to you impels your thoughts.

  

यदा त्वं मां चिन्तयसि तदाहं सन्निधौ तव ।

यदा न मां चिन्तयसि तदाहं सन्निधौ तव ।।५२३।।

When you think of me, I am near you. But even if you do not think of me, I am still near you.

  

मयि त्वं सर्वदा मित्र त्वय्यहं चास्मि सर्वदा ।

मनस्ते तमसाक्रान्तमभेदं द्रष्टुमक्षमम् ।।५२४।।

O friend, you are always in Me and I am always in you. However, your mind, overwhelmed by ignorance, is unable to see the non-difference.

  

मनोगतं तम: सर्वं यदा नश्यति विद्यया ।

तदा ते हृदयाकाशे मामेवेक्षिष्यसे सदा ।।५२५।।

With wisdom, when all the darkness in your mind will disappear, then in the space of your heart, you will always see only Me.
