Dear Sudarshan Ji,

  

  Here is the only reference to the use of पुनीतानाम् as a noun in Böhtlingk's Sanskrit Wörterbuch, Vol 4. He gives a reference to Mahabharata, but says that it is better to read सुनीतानाम्. Monier Williams' reference to Mahabharata for this word is probably based on Böhtlingk. Böhtlingk is referring to the old Calcutta edition, as he was working many decades before the appearance of the BORI critical edition. Here is the reference in Böhtlingk:

It is clear that पुनीत has such a rare and doubtful occurrence in Sanskrit. But it does appear in most modern languages, the best example being the Devi song recited by Jasraj पुनीतपदपङ्कजा..., where it almost re-enters in a vernacular-Sanskrit combination. It does appear in Hindi and Marathi dictionaries. The word probably had a continuous life in Prakrits. With best wishes,
