When the Calcutta Sanskrit College made the request to Sri Sastriji to accept the honor, he politely refused, telling them that he was already honored with that. The College insisted that he accept it as this was being given also keeping in mind that Sastriji's great grand father (mother's grand father) had taught in that institution and that it would be fitting to confer their first such honor on Sastriji.
