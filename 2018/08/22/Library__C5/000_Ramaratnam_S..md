Dear members,

Our organisation is in the process of building up a Sanskrit Library. We propose to have books on Vedic Literature, Classical Sanskrit Literature, darsanas and allied subjects. If any individual or an organisation is in possession of a ready made list of such books, with the names of books, name of the author/s or names of editors, name and address of the publisher, please forward that list. We will be very much obliged. We are looking for books in Sanskrit, Sanskrit plus English, Sanskrit plus Indian languages, Sanskrit plus English plus Indian languages.  

with grateful thanks,
