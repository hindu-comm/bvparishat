Conversation between me and my Sanskritist sister Manik:

  

Manik to me:

कृष्णकाव्यानि रचयन् मत्कुणं भजते कथम् । "How can someone who writes poems on Krishna also devotes to bed bugs?"

  

Me to Manik:

कवीनां च कपीनां च पदानां नास्ति बन्धनम् ।।

"The steps/words of monkeys and poets have no restrictions."
