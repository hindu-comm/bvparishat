Thank you Mr. Subramanian. This is what I have always believed to be so. So many detailed shastras, the Vedas themselves with their swaras could not have been preserved in memory alone. I am grateful to you for giving a proof.

It is said by the West that ink was discovered in China, but I have my doubts regarding that.

Regards,

Uttara.
