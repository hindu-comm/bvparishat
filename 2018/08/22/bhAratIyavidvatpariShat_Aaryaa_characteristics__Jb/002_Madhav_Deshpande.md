Dear Murthy Ji,

  

  I have not done a statistical analysis of the use of the Āryā meter. However, the rule12-18,12-15 seems to have been followed to a very large extent. Īśvarakr̥ṣṇa's Sāṃkhyakārikā seems to follow this structure throughout. The Marathi poet Moropant (1729–1794) wrote 108 different Rāmāyaṇas, many Parvans of the Mahābhārata, and numerous other poetic works, mostly in Āryā, and his works follow the rule 12-18-12-15 quite systematically. There is a certain traditional way of reciting Āryā verses in Maharashtra, and by habit I recite an Ārya to check whether it is structurally sound. On other aspects of Āryā that you have mentioned, there may be variation, but I have not checked that.
With best wishes,
