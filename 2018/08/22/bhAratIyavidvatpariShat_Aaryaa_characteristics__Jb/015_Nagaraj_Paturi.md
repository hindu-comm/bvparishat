These points are there in the audio. I am putting them into text for the convenience of those who did not follow the audio:

  

The Telugu kandamu version of Aaryaa has 12 (3x4) maatraas in the first and third lines and 20 ( 5x4 ) maatraas in the second and fourth lines.The 20 in the second and fourth lines is 3 +2.

  

In the 1st + 2nd and 3rd + 4th grouping among the eight gaNas, the 6th is either jagaNa or sarvalaghu. The last syllable of the second 4th paadas/lines is guru. jagaNa can not be odd number gaNa.

  

It is easy to sing this in the pattern

  

na na naa na na - na na naa na na

  

na na naa na na - naa na naa na - naa naa naa naa

  

The first line rendering should in a tone of expectation of the second.

  

The second line first half

  

na na naa na na - naa na naa na  

  

in aarohaNa with a tone of expectation of the second half.

  

The second half of the second line in avarohaNa, falling, concluding tone.
