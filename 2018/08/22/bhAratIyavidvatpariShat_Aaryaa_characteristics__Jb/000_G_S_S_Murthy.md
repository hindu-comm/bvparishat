Respected Scholars,

Aaryaa, the well known Metre, has the following characteristics:

Maatraa gaNa of 4 maatraas is employed.

First half consists of i) 7 gaNas and a guru at the end.

ii) odd gaNas cannot be jagaNa

iii) sixth gaNa has to be either ja gaNa or sarvalaghu. If it is sarvalaghu yati has to occur after the first laghu.

iv) if seventh gana is sarvalaghu, yati has to occur at the end of sixth gaNa only.

Second half also has seven gaNas where the sixth gaNa is just a laghu. If the fifth gaNa is sarvalaghu, yati has to occur at the end of 4^(th) gana only.

Additionally a yati is normally given at the end of 12 maaatraas in both “half”s. Kedarabhatta\[vruttaratnakara\] does not seem to insist on this.



(There is a kaarikaa

यस्याः पादे प्रथमे द्वादशमात्रास्तथा तृतीयेऽपि ।

अष्टादश द्वितीये चतुर्थके पञ्चदश सार्या ॥

These conditions are necessary but not sufficient.)



In my limited and amateurish experience of composing, I find that it is not easy to follow these restrictions. Dr.Jagannathan who is a member of this group has in fact published a kavya, “Gandhavali”, getting rid of most of these restrictions.

I do not follow why these restrictions are there. To me, it appears that there is no *rhyme* nor reason for such restrictions. Is there any particular way in which an aaryaa is to be recited or sung, where the need for these restrictions can be felt? Even the 12-18,12-15 rule seems arbitrary. I would like to be educated by scholars on this.
