Poojya Sataavadhaani R Ganesh -ji is well versed in aaryaa in various languages including my mother tongue Telugu.

  

Since he, as an avadhaani is an aas'ukavi extempore composer of verses, he knows how the singing style is the key to the complex looking rules turning out to be fun.

  

The Telugu "kandamu" is very much similar.

  

Once you catch the singing style, you may feel this meter to be the easiest and the quickest to compose.
