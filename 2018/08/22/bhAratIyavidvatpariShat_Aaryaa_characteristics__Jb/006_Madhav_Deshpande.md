It was instructive to hear the recitation of Āryā by Shri R. Ganesh, and his explanation that the recitation of Āryā in his region fits within certain Tālas. As far as know, the recitation of Ārya in the region of Maharashtra is not designed to fit a particular Tāla, though there is a certain traditional way of reciting Āryā. I have attached an audio recording of an Āryā verse in my voice in the typical Marathi style. I am no singer, but here is an illustration.
