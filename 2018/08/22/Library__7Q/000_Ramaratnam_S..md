Respected scholars,

In continuation of our request for lists of Sanskrit books, we would also like to make an earnest appeal. There could be a number of houses in India where a lot of Sanskrit books are lying idle without ever being used. There are chances that the father or the grandfather of the family was a scholar in Sanskrit and he had accumulated a number of Sanskrit books but his descendants are no more interested in Sanskrit. They still would not like to throw away the books but may consider the maintenance of books as a burden. Space is another problem in every house. Such persons may come forward to donate the books to our library. We will gratefully acknowledge their kind gesture. We request the members to spread this news among people known to them. If the books are in good condition we will use them straightaway. Otherwise we will take photocopies of the books and preserve them.  

  

with regards,

Dr.S.Ramaratnam,

Vice Chancellor,

JK University,
