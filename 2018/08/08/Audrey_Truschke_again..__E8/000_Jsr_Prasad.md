Namaste.

  

American indologist, Dr. Audrey Truschke, felt regretted upon Hyderabad police canceling her invited lecture on 'Unpopular Stories: Narrating the Indo Islamic Past and Navigating Present-Day Prejudices,' to be held on 11th Aug. Now she seems to be trying to read Aurangazeb using a new lens.
