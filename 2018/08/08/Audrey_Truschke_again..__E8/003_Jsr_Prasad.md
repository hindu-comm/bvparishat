Some indologists, who want to become popular, often take a short route by attacking gods of Hindu dharma in general, and Ramayana in particular. A woman activist went to the extent that she wants to book a case against Sri Rama under section 498(A). A cine critic in Hyderabad, abused Sri Rama in a live TV debate. He posed himself as a saviour of a particular community. A revered Swamiji took lead to protest those adverse remarks by marching to a 'dharmaagraha yaatra.'  

  

The result is - the cine critic was asked to leave the city by police for a few months, but they served an externment order to the Swamiji, too.  

  

The so called critics, academicians, indologists do not dare to target religions other than Hindu dharma. Perhaps, they're well aware that the Charlie Hebdo 'cartoon' sort of incident may repeat, and hence, are highly cautious.
