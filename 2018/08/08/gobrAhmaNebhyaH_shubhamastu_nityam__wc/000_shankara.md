Korada Mahodaya,

  

You explained in another thread that 'go' and 'brahmana' are upalakshanas for animals, birds, etc and human beings respectively.  

  

Could you please explain further why we need to consider 'go' and 'brahmana' as upalakshanas, rather than take the literal meanings of the two words? I would be very much grateful if you could explain more.  

  

regards  
shankara
