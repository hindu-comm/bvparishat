Dear shrI rAmAnujAchAr,

  

Thank you for forwarding this information. When I accidentally came across one of the kANva-shAkhA lectures by shrI-vijayarAghava-shAstrI on youtube, I found it very difficult to search and obtain all the other parts. Somehow the search and also recommendation features on youtube are not able to tie these 8 parts together. Finally I figured out the numbering scheme and was able to get the other parts as well, which I sent to the advaita-list a couple of days back. It's a good thing subbu-ji forwarded it here, we were able to get a link to the tArkShya web-site from you. Your web-site has all the lectures in one location and they all seem interesting. As a note to list members, I would like to point out that google chrome was not able to load the videos properly from the web-site below. However internet-explorer loads the videos properly.

  

Ramakrishnan
