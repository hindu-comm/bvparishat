Dear Shri Ramanujachar,

  

  Thanks for sending this informative document regarding the TARKSHYA project. I just want to bring to your attention that theURL – <http://bhomi.csa.iisc.ernet.in:8080/ihg> is not working at this time.
If there is another online way to access these videos, please point me in that direction. Thanks once again.
