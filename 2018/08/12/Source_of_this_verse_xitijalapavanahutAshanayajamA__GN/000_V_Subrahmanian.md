In the Maskari's bhashya to Gautama Dharma Sutra, the following verse is cited as from a purana:  

  

'क्षितिजलपवनहुताशनयजमानाकाशसोमसूर्याख्या मूर्तयो भगवतः शर्वस्याष्टौ' from a purana (source not known)  

  

While searching for the source of the purana I ended up finding that this verse, in part, cited by the commentary to the Brhajjataka of Varahamihira.

  

Any information about the original source of the verse is welcome.

  

warm regards
