Here is the image where the verse/line is cited:

  

![image.png](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/f03f5992e22cb/image.png?part=0.0.1&view=1)  

  

While searching for a match, I got this:
<http://www.sanskrit.nic.in/DigitalBook/B/Brihajjatkam.pdf>  Pl. see attached image.

  

Since some other author also has cited the same form, at least the first line, it is likely that there is a popular work that has this verse.
