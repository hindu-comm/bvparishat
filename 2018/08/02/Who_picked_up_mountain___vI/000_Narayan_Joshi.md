Request to both Shree Shankarji and Abhis'eka Chatterji,

It is not good idea to present partial information about Mount Sinai.

We know that Prophet of Islam did not pick up mountain in his life time. So he was referring to the ancient deed of the ancient God. Now mount Sinai is connected with Jewish history in the Old Testament of Bible. Now please let BVP scholars know who was the God in the old testament who picked up the mountain and why?

Thanks. N.R.Joshi
