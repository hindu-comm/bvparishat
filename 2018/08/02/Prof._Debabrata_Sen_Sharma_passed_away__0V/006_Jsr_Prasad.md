Dear Sri Sudipta Munsi,

  

As condolence messages reveal, it is a great loss for Sanskrit scholarship. We pray for the *sadgati* of respected Prof. Debabrata Sen Sharma ji, as reverentially submitted by Prof. Sundareswaran.Let us not debate at this point. We had a couple of discussions on the usage of this expression, some time back.
