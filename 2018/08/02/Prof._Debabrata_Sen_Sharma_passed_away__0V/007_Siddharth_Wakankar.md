I also was well conversant with his scholarship and was a friend of his.He was a gentleman scholar and I used to address him as Decent Sen Sharma instead of Dr Sen Sharma and he would gently laugh and appreciate my feelings and reverence for him.

  

I am a very small person to say anything about his astounding scholarship in different fields.He,however,never carried his greatness with him while talking to his friends and juniors like me.That was his real greatness.

  

We twice met in Calcutta in 1990 and then in 2010 at the Asiatic Society and in the Ramakrishna Mission,Golpark,Calcutta.

  

I sincerely pay my respects to him.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
