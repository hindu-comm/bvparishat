My sincere condolences to passing away of revered prof sen Sharma. I attended some of his lectures & had the opportunity to be acquainted with him. His scholarship was as greatas was his amiability & warmth of heart as a person. His passing away has created a vacuum in the academic world. May his soul leave in peace forever. Tushar Sarkar.
