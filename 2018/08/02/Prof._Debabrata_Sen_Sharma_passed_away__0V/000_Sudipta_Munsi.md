Dear List Members,

  

It is with a heavy heart that I report the sad demise of Prof. Debabrata Sen Sharma (1929-2018). Prof. Sen Sharma passed away at his Calcutta residence this morning. He was one of the profoundest scholars of Kasmira Saivism and had the distinction of studying the philosophy under the legendary Mahamahopadhyaya Dr. Gopinatha Kaviraja of Varanasi. His Ph.D. dissertation on the same topic was published under the title 'The Philosophy of Sadhana'. He also edited and published the Matsyendra Samhita. An Introduction to the Advaita Saiva Philosophy of Kashmir, Sattrmsattattvasandoha, Aspects of Tantra-Yoga are some of his notable works. He taught at the Department of Sanskrit, Kurukshetra University. He was honoured by the President of India, Late Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, in recognition of his contribution to Sanskrit studies. During his last days, he held the Surendra Paul Chair in Indology at the Centre for Indological Studies and Research, Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Golpark, Calcutta, where he used to teach core Sanskrit texts of Kasmira Saivism to budding scholars, apart from delivering monthly lectures on Kasmira Saivism. A human being, filled with gentleness, humbleness and scholarship, Prof. Sen Sharma will continue to be one of the most important sources of inspiration for future scholars of Kasmira Saivism.

  

प्रसृत्यै शिवदृष्टेर्यो धृतव्रतः सदा भुवि।  
अद्य देवव्रतः सोऽयं गच्छेच्छिवमयीं स्थितिम्॥  

  

May his soul rest in peace.

  

  

Sincerely,
