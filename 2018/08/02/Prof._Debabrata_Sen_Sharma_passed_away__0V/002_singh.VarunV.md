Dear Sudipta Munshi ji,  
Namaste. Rest in peace or RIP is NOT hindu samskriti. It an abrahamanic epithet. It might be a small yet significant thing. We say something like may he attain sadgati or shaanti. Rest in peace or RIP is for christians as they rest (below the earth) in peace until judgement day comes.  
  
Dhanyavaad,  
Varun Vikram Singh
