Because ***this work originated so long ago*,** different manuscripts offer various versions of its title. The database of the[A.C. Woolner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Woolner "A.C. Woolner")manuscript project at the[Library of the University of Vienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Vienna#The_University_Library "University of Vienna")gives the following variant titles, gleaned from different manuscript[colophons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing) "Colophon (publishing)"):*Haṭhayogapradīpikā*,*Haṭhapradīpikā*,*Haṭhapradī*,*Hath-Pradipika*.^([\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatha_Yoga_Pradipika#cite_note-WoolnerDatabase-2))

***The*Hatha Yoga Pradīpikā*was composed by Svātmārāma in the 15th century[CE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era "Common Era").^([\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatha_Yoga_Pradipika#cite_note-3))******as a compilation of *the earlier* hatha yoga texts.*** Svātmārāma incorporates older Sanskrit concepts into his popular synthesis. In the*Hatha Yoga Pradīpikā,*Svātmārāma introduces his system as preparatory stage for physical purification that the body practices for higher[meditation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation "Meditation")or[yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raja_Yoga "Raja Yoga"). It is based on[asanas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asana "Asana")(postures) and[pranayama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pranayama "Pranayama")(breathing techniques). (highlighting mine)

[James Mallinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mallinson_(author) "James Mallinson (author)")has thoroughly studied the origins of hatha yoga and has worked with classic yoga texts such as the*Khecarīvidyā*. He has identified a collection of eight works that introduce early hatha yoga and contribute directly to its official formation in the*Hatha Yoga Pradipika*. Many of his conclusions from these early works revise earlier understandings about the formation of yoga.^([\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatha_Yoga_Pradipika#cite_note-5))
