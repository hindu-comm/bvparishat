नमो विद्वद्भ्यः।

  

Recently there was an article in NYT about Baba Ramdev, his Patanjali products, Yoga and politics that covered Yoga so:  
  
"This narrative about yoga’s ancient roots has become a sacrament for Hindu nationalists, and it is echoed in the West. But it is mostly myth, an idealized origin story of the kind so many would-be nation-builders, from ancient Rome to the Zionists, have fostered about themselves. The oldest Hindu scriptures contain almost no mention of physical postures. Even the Yoga Sutras, the so-called bible of yoga, include only a few short verses suggesting comfortable postures for sitting. Many of the postures practiced in yoga today appear to have emerged in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Dozens of modern ashtanga yoga postures are similar or identical to those found in a gymnastic routine introduced to India by the British in the first decades of the 20th century and originally developed by a Danish fitness instructor named Niels Bukh, who later became notorious for his pro-Nazi sympathies. Bukh, needless to say, has been conveniently forgotten by both Indians and the yoga-loving celebrities of Hollywood."  
  

The NYT article ([here](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/26/magazine/the-billionaire-yogi-behind-modis-rise.html)) and the paragraph quoted above was referred to in

It makes one wonder if such is the western illiteracy, crookedness or both!
