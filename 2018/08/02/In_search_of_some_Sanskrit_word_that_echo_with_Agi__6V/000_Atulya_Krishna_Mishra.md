Hello Everyone,

  

This is Atulya.I joined this group today early morning while I was searching for some Sanskrit word about my website domain.

I'm an 'Agile coach' working in Pune.An ardent lover of 'old Indian wisdom', Sanskrit and Srimad Bhagavad-Gita.

But unfortunately don't get enough time to explore [them.in](http://them.in) depth after 12/14 hrs. Of my routine corporate job.

  

I'm quite sure I landed at right place to discuss about my current problem but not sure whether it's up to the mark and according to the group norms, yet it's always better to ask when in confusion.☺

  

As I said I'm an agile coach, I'm giving some context about Agile here so that I can get max. Benefit out of your help.

Agile ,is a way of developing software (more than process) ,you can say it's mindset, way of working, Methodology more can be found on (www.agile [manifesto.org](http://manifesto.org))

Agile talks about, people, collaboration, cross functional team, no command and control , more liberation, constant change, respect, openness, courage, innovation, quality product, shorter time, frequent feedback etc.

  

My pain point is I'm searching for a sanskrit word which echo these (or some of )sentiments.

  

Yesterday I tried few words like, सृजन, अनित्य,पण्डित and mingle with 'agile', but I'm not quite happy with their appeal.

  

Can some of you please help me to Zero down a more beautiful, self explanatory, appealing Sanskrit word that echo the spirit of 'Agile software development' ?

  

BTW, सृजन is already taken as hostname.

Some of other domain I thought of which are not in sanskrit is-

  

[agileliberator.com](http://agileliberator.com)

Cognitiveagility.com

BuccaneerAgilist.com

AgileNirvana.com

  

  

Help please ?
