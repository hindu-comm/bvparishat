As far as I was able to gather from a few very general reads (prompted by this discussion), the Nazis (I refer, of course, to a particular nationalist organization, the NSDAP; note that Nazi means in German general „nationalist“) didn’t directly refer to Indian svastika, but rather borrowed from a certain by then established nationalist/ antisemitic symbolism (which by itself was only IN-directly connected to the Indian svastika).  
  
In fact, if one looks up an English dictionary (klicke OED or even wikipedia), one finds that the term „swastika“ (spelled with „w“) doesn’t seem to refer just to the multifold indian or the NSDAP-misused incarnations of the symbol, but to a variety of similar symbols found in many different cultures around the globe. I’d be really curious to know how this English coinage came about.
