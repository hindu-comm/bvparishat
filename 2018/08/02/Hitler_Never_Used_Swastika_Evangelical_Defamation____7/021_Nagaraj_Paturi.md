Swastika is an auspicious symbol is a fact collected from 1. archaeological evidences 2. present day ground reality observations.

  

If there are no textual references describing or prescribing swastika as a symbol of auspiciousness , this can not undo the fact evidenced through archaeological material that it was taken as a symbol of auspiciousness and it can not undo the fact that it is being taken as a symbol of auspiciousness.

  

More pertinent question would be when and where is the name swastika first found in reference to this symbol?

  

Whenever and wherever the first use of the word is found, that the word has "svasti" as part of it can not be denied. That the word "svasti" is found as a word for wishing auspiciousness right from the Vedamantra times also can not be denied.

  

So the only question that awaits an answer is what is there in the shape of this symbol that makes it get the name svastika which is undoubtedly connected to the svasti mantras of the Vedas ?
