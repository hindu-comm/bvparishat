While I understand the sentiments about redeeming the swastika symbol, I am baffled by the claim that Nazi Germany or Hitler didn't know its association with "Aryans" (or India, Indo-Europeans). Even before Hitler, the German Nationalists (Nazis) have been using the Swastika as their emblem. They considered that it is a pure Aryan symbol, that originated in Europe among the Aryans and that it is a special characteristic of the Aryan peoples as a whole and of the Germanic people in particular.

  

It all started when Heinrich Schliemann, a German archaeologist,
discovered the archaeological site of Troy, where he also discovered the symbol of swastika which he associated with the migration of "Aryans." For the Germans nationalists, the “purely Aryan symbol” Schliemann uncovered was no longer an archaeological mystery—it was a stand-in for their superiority. German nationalist groups like the Reichshammerbund (a 1912 anti-Semitic group) and the Bavarian Freikorps (paramilitarists who wanted to overthrow the Weimar Republic in Germany) used the swastika to reflect their “newly discovered” identity as the master race. Schliemann was definitely aware of its use in India, and that, in fact, its use by Vedic "Aryans" is what enabled him to theorize that the swastika was a "significant religious symbol of our remote ancestors", linking it to ancient Teutons, Greeks and Indians of the Vedic era \[Schliemann 1875\] \[Brown 1933\].

  

As the swastika became more and more intertwined with German nationalism, Adolf Hitler’s influence grew—and he adopted it as the Nazi party symbol in 1920. “He was attracted to it because it was already being used in other nationalist, racialist groups,” says Steven Heller, author of The Swastika: Symbol Beyond Redemption? \[Steven Heller,2008\].
