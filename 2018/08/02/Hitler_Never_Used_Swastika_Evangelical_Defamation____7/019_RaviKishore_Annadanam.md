Namaste,

  

In Ilkley Moor, Yorkshire, England, there is a sight with a Swastitka like symbol marked on stone, is attracting many tourists since years. At this moment no one is able to date this, however are guessing it could be from stone age or bronze age. My point here, Swastika (not the word, but the symbol) not new the ancient world, not just limited to bharata khanDa.

I have also read some articles in the past how some Germans thought themselves as super aryans (after the aryan invasion theory by British), and tried to re-invent their past by linking bharatiya things to their native. This usage of Swastika symbol also possibly due to this linking.

  

Dhanyavad,

Annadanam Ravi Kishore
