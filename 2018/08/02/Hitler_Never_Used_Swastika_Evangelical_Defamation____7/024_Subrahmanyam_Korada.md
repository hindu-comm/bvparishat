नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

A शब्द may be used in different senses in different regions -

  

शवति means गच्छति - for the people of कम्बोज whereas for आर्यs शव is a dead body -- पस्पशाह्निकम् , महाभाष्यम् ।

  

So if the term स्वस्तिका is being used to mean something sacred then put it under पृषोदरादिगण (पृषोदरादीनि यथोपदिष्टम्

पा 6-3-109 ) .

  

And also it is not acceptable to tradition to say - ' this word is not employed ' ( अस्त्यप्रयुक्त इति साहसमात्रमेव - पस्पशा .)

simply because - महान् शब्दस्य विषयः ( the literature is at once too vast ) and it is also not possible to offer an account

of each शब्द and its usage in different senses.

  

We simply follow शिष्टप्रयोग ।

  

One need not necessarily exhibit an exploded view of a शब्द - what is the प्रकृति and what is the प्रत्यय etc , each time .

  

Panini was well aware of this problem and so he suggested पृषोदरादि ।

  

धन्यो’स्मि
