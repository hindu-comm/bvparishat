Dear scholars,

          Namaste. My name is KG Sheshadri and thought that the following attachment \[shortened to 18 pages and accessible on their website\] would be an addition to the present discussion on Svastika. Similar cross cultural studies on various symbols, plants/fauna may throw interesting light on ancient India and other civilization links.

  

With warm regards,

Sheshadri
