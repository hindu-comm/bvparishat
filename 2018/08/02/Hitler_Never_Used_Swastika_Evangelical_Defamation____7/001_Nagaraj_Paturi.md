Today, when you use Google translate to find out the English translation of the German word Hakenreuz, it gives Swastika instead of the Hooked Cross.

And if you were to search for Swastika, it gives Hakenkreuz.

An online miracle in translation has been performed that has made all trace of the Hooked Cross disappear from the Hakenreuz!

We cannot immediately undo the years of bigotry that has come our way through such dishonest tactics, but we can definitely ensure that the translation is corrected. A Twitter user @AbhinavAgarwal has suggested a way to get the translation right. Hope people take few minutes of their time and contribute towards correcting the translation. This is a good time to show what a billion united Indians can achieve.

All you need to do is go to[*https://translate.google.com/*](https://translate.google.com/).

-   On the left side, choose ‘English’ and write ‘Swastika’ and on the
    right side choose ‘German’ for translation. It will show
    ‘Hakenkeuz’. -   On the bottom right , click on ‘suggest an edit’ and put the meaning
    as Swastik and click on ‘contribute’. -   Now on the left side choose ‘German’ and write ‘Hakenkreuz’ and on
    the right side choose ‘English’ for translation. It will show
    ‘swastika’. -   On the bottom right , click on suggest an edit and put the meaning
    as Hooked Cross and click on ‘contribute’.

All of us can right this wrong of Swastika demonisation by correcting the translation and raising awareness about Swastika’s centuries of association with welfare and prosperity.
