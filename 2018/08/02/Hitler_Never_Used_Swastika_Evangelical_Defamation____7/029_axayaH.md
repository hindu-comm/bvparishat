This is a slight digression. The notion of anything and everything 'traditional' being 'suspect' and 'inferior', has deep roots in Protestant theology: everything old is corrupt and the work of devil, and must be suppressed. This is what Lutherans/Calvinists argued against the Catholics,... and in an amusing way is what passes for 'secularism' in the Indian constitution, its Judiciary, and in the Anglical Intelligentsia. This is also why 'Brahmins' are hated: they are the equivalent of Catholic priests. Not surprisingly, the goal of German Indologists for a long time has been to 'scientifically' interpret Indian texts, which according to them are completely inaccessible to Indians.

That whatever 'white folk' say is taken as pramāṇa in India, is a political issue; it'd be wise to neither to play their game, nor argue in their terms. Why ? The results can often be a pyrrhic victory. Indian Judiciary is one of such egregious examples. It can't define 'secularism', 'religious', or 'essentially religious', after a 300 year legacy, yet in the interpretation of these terms lies the life and death of each and every practice in India. Yet, we pretend to understand these terms, to a degree sufficient to be able to make draconian laws. It's absurd. If you follow the debates on Sabarimala closely, you can here the echoes of those Europeans who landed here 300 years ago and described Indians as worshipers of Satan.  
  
This thread is woven very carefully in the work of S N Balagangadhara and his students. See,

The talk also mentions (AFAICR), why it was in Secular Germany, that anti-semitism flourished.
