Interesting arguments by the learned Professors!

  

Then, Mahabhashyam is not conforming to the auspiciousness of the swastika symbol/ornament. Because, it appeared that the words 'swasti' and 'swastika' don't denote the same meaning. Need to explore any other Sanskrit texts?

  

Is there a deeper meaning encrypted in the shape of symbol itself..

  

Regards
