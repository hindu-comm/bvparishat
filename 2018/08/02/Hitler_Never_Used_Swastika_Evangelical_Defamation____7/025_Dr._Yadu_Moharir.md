Namaskar

  

I had already read all the links provided by Prof Paturi-Ji

  

However, I failed to to comprehend WHY ? HOW ? Swastika became the pious / holy symbol !?

  

We can can always keep on repeating the tradition or "gataanugatika" (shiSHTa payoga) aspect of Indian culture.

  

But s that or should that be the correct position ? OR we have to wait for Windy Doninger and other to provide their interpretation of HOW ? & WHY ? and then get disturbed of foreign interpretation ?

  

As a scientist I am just asking the question ?

  

Any thoughts HOW it may have become the pious symbol would be appreciated for all the scholars.

  

Thank you all in advance for responses.

  

Kind Rgds

  

Dr Yadu
