Dear Sri Suresh-ji,

  

1\. The article from Smithsonianmag.com has already been shared by Prof. Madhav Deshpande in his recent post. The points you are making are already made through that post.

  

2\. You said, " I am baffled by the claim that Nazi Germany or Hitler didn't know its association with "Aryans" (or India, Indo-Europeans).
". Where, in the Swarajyamag article, is the statement that Nazi Germany or Hitler didn't know its association with "Aryans" (or India, Indo-Europeans). The statement in the article is

  

"It is a common misconception that Hitler used the Swastika symbol.**But Hitler himself never used the word "Swastika"**to refer to his symbol. He called it “Hooked Cross”(“Haken Kreuz”)."  

  

3\. Major part of the article is contradicting the view that there is any Aryan source for the antisemitism with which the symbol is associated by providing Christian sources of antisemitism of the Nazis.

  

4\. You may see the consequences of association of Swastika with antisemitism,'Aryan supremacy', 'Brahmin supremacy', 'Hindu supremacy', 'elitism' etc., in the need for Prof. Girish Nath Jha to explain that his building in JNU being in Swastika/Svastika shape is not wrong in the post:

where he had to explain:

5\. Hitler, his antisemitism, his genocide, etc., are all invoked as a straw man to discount even the most valid Indian nationalist arguments only because of the conspiracy of propagation of association of the obsolete and unscientific concept of 'Aryan race' and the symbol highly respected by 'Hindus' and absolutely not connected with Hitler's need, creed or deeds with Hiltler, Nazis and their antisemitism and genocide.

  

6\. Any evidence of any archaeologist or any other kind of researcher discovering swastika in his/her research and that having connection with Hitler or Nazis using that symbol for their diabolical activities does not prove invoking Hitler, his antisemitism, his genocide, etc., as a straw man to discount even the most valid Indian nationalist arguments only because of the conspiracy of propagation of association of the obsolete and unscientific concept of 'Aryan race' and the symbol highly respected by 'Hindus' and absolutely not connected with Hitler's need, creed or deeds with Hiltler, Nazis and their antisemitism and genocide as right.
