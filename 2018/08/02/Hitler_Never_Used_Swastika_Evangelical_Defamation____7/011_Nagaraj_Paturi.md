Sri Suresh-ji,

  

I am glad to know that you are with me in my concern.

  

The task of restoring the right meaning of any word or symbol can be easily achieved by repeated use of it in the right sense and repeated talk of the wrong done to it.

  

Please point out the location of the statement in the article, " Hitler didn't know its association with Aryans ". I shall try to point that out to the authors.

  

If we agree that both Swarajyamag and Smithsonianmag articles are based on sound research, we can infer that Nazi use of the symbol has both connections: Christian Hooked Cross and the archaeological findings of what they thought were Swastikas.

  

None of this proves that Swastika symbolises what it is being believed or is being made to be believed is true.

  

A lot of such conscious and unconscious semantic/semiotic harm done to Indic words and symbols needs to be undone urgently.

  

Hope you agree.
