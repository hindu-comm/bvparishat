Trying to follow up the history of the symbol in nazi germany (there are plenty of articles about it in german, they basically say that nazis knew it was an ancient symbol of some kind, but it was already established among certain groups as an antisemitic symbol since the beginning of the 20th cent.), I found this site which I thought may amuse some of you as well: <http://www.proswastika.org>
