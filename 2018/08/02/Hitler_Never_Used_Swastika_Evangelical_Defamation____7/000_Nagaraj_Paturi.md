It is a common misconception that Hitler used the Swastika symbol.**But Hitler himself never used the word "Swastika"**to refer to his symbol. He called it “Hooked Cross”(“Haken Kreuz”).

Hitler first saw the Hooked Cross symbol in a Christian monastery (Lambach Abbey) which he attended as a boy\[11\]. He later adopted it as an emblem for his party. There is no evidence that he ever heard of the word “Swastika”. Hooked Cross had been a sacred symbol of Christianity since its inception in ancient days and it is very natural to find Hooked Cross symbol in old churches and chapels.

The hooked cross was seen as a Christian symbol in Nazi Germany.

From 1933 onwards, Catholic schoolchildren in Catholic schools of Nazi Germany were taught in their religious instruction about “the close affinity between Cross and Hooked Cross”.

Nazi SA (Sturmabteilung) members, often with the approval of their Protestant ministers, marched to worship in churches draped with the Hooked Cross\[12\].

Here is the image of the union of Cross and the Hooked Cross used by the Churches in the Nazi era.

Hooked cross had nothing to do either with Hinduism or Swastika. It existed as an important symbol of Christendom since its very existence. It was found on early Christian Graves of Rome in 2rd century CE.
