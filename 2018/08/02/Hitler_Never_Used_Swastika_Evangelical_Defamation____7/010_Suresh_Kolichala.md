Dear Nagaraj-ji,

  

Sorry, I didn't see Deshpandeji's email. As I said earlier, I understand the reason for the need to redeem Swastika and make it disassociated with Nazi's obsolete and unscientific concept of 'Aryan race'. I am totally with you. However, it may be an uphill task as the term Swastika andHakenkreuz were used synonymously for more than a century, and for the Jewish people Swastika has been a symbol of fear, of suppression, and of extermination.

  

See the Ngram Viewer on use of the term "swastika" in the 20th century:  
  
<https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=swastika&year_start=1800&year_end=2008>  

  

Also I do not agree with the statement in theSwarajyamag article thatHitler didn't know its association with "Aryans". It is apparent from the literature thatHakenkreuzwas just considered a German term for Swastika. If we look at Hitler's Mein Kempf, where he described his blueprint for Aryan supremacy, it is very clear he considered Hakenkreuz as a symbol of "Aryan race" in hisskewed view of Indo-European history.

  

Regards,

Suresh.
