Abhyankar's dictionary of Sanskrit grammar on the word *pratinirdiśyamāna* quotes the following line from Kaiyaṭa's Mahābhāṣya-Pradīpa, without giving a reference as to where this line occurs. Is there a searchable text of Pradīpa available online?
Otherwise, if anyone has come across this quote from Kaiyaṭa, please let me know where it occurs. Best,
