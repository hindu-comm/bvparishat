Respected Seeker.

  

Srimad Bhagavad Gita is Self Knowledge of the Highest Order. It is called Brahma Vidya.

I'm sure when you personally attend a discourse of an enlightened Master, it will strike you immediately.

  

In my opinion it is not being said to anyone else. It is an inner journey of self-introspection. If you read the Bhagavad Gita a bit more, you will also realize Bhagawan is saying - "among the Pandavas, I am Arjuna".

  

For something to be very intimate only ONE is possible. From ONE then manifests Diversity.

  

(to go on, **Arjuna** simply means "the one who is **alert**. the one who is **aware**. the one who is a **willing** student. the one who is **totally** devoted with one-pointedness.").

  

Jai Gurudev

Ashwini
