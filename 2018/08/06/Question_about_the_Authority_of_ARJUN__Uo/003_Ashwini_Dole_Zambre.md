Respected Sirs'

  

I am very much thankful for the two valuable opinions, I have received from the group.

  

While asking this question, I have already thinking in mind the possibility of various answers. But when I think inside me. I pictured 'Gita' as a 'Atmasamvaad'. आत्मसंवाद of 'Arjun' . Just like we all have a inner voice. This voice guide us in critical situation. But while thinking on this, remaining four pandavas position and situation come in my mind.

And that's why I asked the question.

So thank u very much for your valuable and important response.

  

Thanks and Regards

Ashwini Zambre
