Respected Scholars,

  

We all are aware about the knowledge about Shrimad Bhagvad Gita.

  

For example, It is told by Bhagvan Shri Krishna to Warrior Arjun who was one of the Five Pandav. The place where Gita was told etc. etc. and many more things.

  

But My question is all five pandavas were there for war.

  

Then why Shrikrishna told Gita to only Arjun.?

  

He could be called to other four and gathered them all and then tell the Gita to all. I know he was the 'Sarathi' of Arjun. But why Arjun ?

Yes! I know the first yog in Gita is Arjun Vishad Yoga. But why only Arjun?

  

  

Pls. Help me in this matter

  

Thanks in Advance to everybody.
