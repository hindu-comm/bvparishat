Dear Murthy Ji,

  

  Thanks. This is an excellent twist. There is a sort of vernacular joke in saying मत्कुण: दिवं गत:. In Marathi, the word दिवा \[\< दीप\] refers to a lamp, and I remember that my grandmother used to catch bed-bugs from the nets and throw them into the kerosene lamp to get rid of them.
