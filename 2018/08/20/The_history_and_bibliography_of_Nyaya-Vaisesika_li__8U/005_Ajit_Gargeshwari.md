One should use MSQL as a back end tool and get webOPAC interface. Then once can enter millions of records pull up the needed information easily and effectively. Excel as database manger has several limitations. Searching on excel sheet without a front end will be very difficult. If the data base is small Excel works well. This data base will grow and excel will not work well
