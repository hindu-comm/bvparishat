If the number of books and articles that will go into the database will be for less then 20,000 in number one can use Zotero. Zotero is free software. One can create subject wise bibliographies by splitting the database and still one can use Zotero. All Information contained in say for example Vedic bibliography by Dandekar can be inputted into Zotero and one can export biobibliography details in the format one needs Zotero can be integrated into many Library management sytem
