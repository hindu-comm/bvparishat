Thank you Prof. Shivani ji for such a detailed and scholastic rebuttal. Strange to note that some scholars in this particular thread were so quick to agree without any further examination that the audience (which included Prof Aravind Kumar, Prof Kutumba shastry ji etc. ) were 'intimidating, hooligsnistic' in their questioning.

  

I think, if some here in this mailing list have access to RISA/Indology forum, they should post Prof. Shivani's response there.

  

Thank you Prof. Shivani once again.
