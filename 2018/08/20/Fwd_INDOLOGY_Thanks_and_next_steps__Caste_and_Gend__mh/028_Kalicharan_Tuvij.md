Namaste,

I don't know if this is relevant, yet to simply state a fact: the are still those like me who follow the source religion of Hinduism (and not one of the streams, or sects) who regard Aditi as the (unambiguous) supreme deity, and give daily worship to her (with some believing Swastika to be her symbol).
