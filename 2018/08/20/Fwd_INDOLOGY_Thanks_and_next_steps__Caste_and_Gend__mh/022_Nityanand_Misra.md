And what a detailed, specific, and revealing response this is by Prof. Shivani Ji. I hope Ananya Vajpeyi and Adheesh Sathaye read this (I doubt if they will ever respond). I also hope this response (and the response on Sanskrit by Sh. Jayaraman) is published in part or full on a platform like Firstpost or Swarajya, who are more open to views from all sides than publications The Hindu. We cannot let the Ananyas and Audreys go unchallenged.
