The post I shared in the beginning of this thread says that the presentations in the forum are not autobiographical. (The Hindu article indicates autobiographical nature of what Prof. Mandakranta Bose said. But that could also be a passing reference). On that basis, "autobiographical" as a basis of misplaced nature of the forum does not stand.

  

---------------------------------------------------

  

The crux seems to be the view of "political". Prof. Srinivasa Varakhedi objected to the forum on the basis of that being "political". Now the responses by some or all of the audience in the forum are being called bad ('bad' is the gist setting aside all the misfit series of abuses hurled such as xenophobic, misogynist etc.) on the basis of they being "political". Both sides are viewing the other side of the argument as bad on the same basis "political". Prof. Varakhedi's view seems to be that motives to malign or misrepresent India or breaking India using its fault lines is "political" in the bad sense of the term. For those who are calling the response in the forum as "political" raising the questions of misrepresenting Sanskrit, its literature, India, its society and culture etc., Indian nationalism reflected in those questions seem to be "political" .

  

I explained to Prof. Varakhedi in my response to his mail , in all my earnestness , that "political" is not considered as bad by the western academics. I found them mentioning names of Indian political parties and their actions as context for their highly acclaimed academic papers. I thought that is the way they show contemporary relevance of their academics.

  

What is "political" ? This needs to be resolved.
