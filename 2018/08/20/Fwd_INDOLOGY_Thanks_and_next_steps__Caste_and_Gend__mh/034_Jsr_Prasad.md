Dear Dr. Anuradha,

  

Your response added more value to what had been already narrated before. Congratulations to you for articulating your observations in a decent, strong, plain manner and standing by Dr. Shivani. Yes, you too, are a gifted daughter of this sacred land. All your responses should be an eye-opener to many.  

  

I could not resist to second the views of Prof. Ram:

Best regards,
