Dear Dr. Shivani and Dr. Anuradha,

You have done a splendid job. I felt extremely happy reading the mails posted by you, and I deeply appreciate you for coming forward to raise your voice against the narrative of one of the most vociferous scholars of recent times. It takes a lot of courage to do so, and you have done your job admirably well. Both of you richly deserve our kudos for your posts!  

The general tendency of scholars who do not belong to the so-called \`\`left-wing" or "right-wing" is to stay away from engaging with ideologues, as they would gang up and shout. By virtue of sheer intimidating volume of voices, people get confused and more of than not also get carried away.  

Your posts have thrown a lot of tight on what transpired in the session. Thanks to both of you for taking time to write in some detail of what really happened there, so that people like us who could not be there got a balanced view.  

Best regards,

-ram.
