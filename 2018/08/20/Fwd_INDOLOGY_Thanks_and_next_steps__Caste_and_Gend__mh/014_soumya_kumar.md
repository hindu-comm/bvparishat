Respected Members,

  

I am writing this in response to the question raised by Dr Nagaraj Paturiji and later by Dr Shivaniji,

  

Dr Nagaraj ended one of his mails by asking: What is political?

Earlier to raising this question he has very pertinently pointed out that in western academia, it is a quite common practice to factor in political in academic discourses.  

  

Why is it so?  

  

The very subject, Political Science for example deals with the effect of State on society. State as is well known refers to the legitimised structure of power. For example, in the case of India, it is broadly legislature, judiciary and administrative bureaucracy that constitutes the State.

Sociology, however deals with this in slightly different manner. It defines politics as - effect of society's influence on state. In this background, the frustration and desperation experienced by likes of Dr Ananya Vajapeyi makes sense.  

  

Let us not forget that this whole structure is infiltrated by innate distaste to what is Bharatiya and is very comfortable with artificial categories that is remote from the experience of a common bharatiya.  

  

The so called "proper academic questions and definitions" that has been sanctified by the state and modern day academia is being questioned strongly by BVP and others. That also explains why Dr Ananya, Dr Kaushal and others refused to answer the questions raised by veterans like Dr Kutumba Shastri, Dr Aravinda Sharma and others. No wonder that German Oriental Society, DMG characterises BVP as - anti-academic ideology called “Swadeshi Indology". Any thinking which is contrary to their thought is conveniently denigrated as ideology and "their" version as science.  

  

The framework of scholarly discussion developed by western Indologists is being questioned seriously and therefore they feel threatened. This is upsetting the castle built by them and they do not know how to react.  

  

With regards,

soumya
