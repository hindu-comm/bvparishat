My humble suggestion is that we should move beyond these repetitive traps and patterns of having to respond to their accusation of something being there or not being there in the Indic tradition. Any attempt to show that we also 'have something' that they like or we 'don't have that thing' that they dislike in hope of their acknowledgement and appreciation will only be ridiculed further as can be seen in RISA/Indology mailing lists. For some of these 'South-Asian' scholars their academic engagement has very little to do with any search for truth and consequent furthering of the frontiers of knowledge. Its more of a 'bias confirmation' - picking evidences to their convenience to a preset motive and narrative. Therefore, pandering to their wishes will not help much. Rather, the responses, as and when necessary, as in this case, must thoroughly examine and expose their motives, fallacies and tricks as effectively done by all the three respondents - Dr. Shivani, Dr. Jayaraman and Dr. Anuradha. More power to them.

  

Two things would be helpful at this juncture:

  

1\. Can scholars who have access to RISA/Indology mailing list post these responses there?

  

2\. Can someone with connection to Swarajya magazine assist in getting a detailed coverage of this whole issue - may be with interviews of these scholars also.

  

Best regards

Vinayachandra
