Dr Shivani-ji,

  

Thanks for the post.

  

Everything was groping in the darkness without this.

  

It was a candid report on the event. A balanced presentation of views.

  

While we were desperately waiting for such a first hand report from the audience, I did say, "if there are any". Was saying that those "if any" did disservice to the cause taken up by respected Prof. Varakhedi who initiated and asked for the discussion. But your report shows that there were no such members among the audience of the forum. I did not agree with any of the extreme remarks made by Prof. Soni or Prof. Sathaye. But was influenced by their posts to the extent of saying "if any". I regret that and apologise to those who got offended by that "if". This is a learning for me now that in such an emotional situation of sides, even something like "if any" can be hurting to the members of the group feeling unjustifiably wrongly accused.

  

Your mention of facts such as no mike to the audience reveal it all. They provide answers to many questions of why at all there was a scope created for a certain way of interpreting the happenings.

  

Prof. Sathaye,, the developments in the forum under discussion seem to have left both the speakers and the audience frustrated, of course, for different reasons. You offered apology to one of the sides. You may or may not think that the other side is justified in taking this as - a bias, taking of one side than the other, taking of one side than both. But given the facts reported by Dr Shivani, the bias comes out clearer. Prof. Soni and you could have explained the logistical and infrastructural or organisational inevitabilities faced by you in stead of unjustifiably demonising the audience that includes venerable scholars. Your and Prof. Soni's expression coming out through your choice of words to describe the response from the audience was unnecessarily exaggerated if not inaccurate and misrepresenting.

  

Dr Shivani, thanks again for the report the quality of which is attested by the kind of scholars that have instantly admired it.

  

Warm regards,
