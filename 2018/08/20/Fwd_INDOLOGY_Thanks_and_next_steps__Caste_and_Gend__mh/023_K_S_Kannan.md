Apropos of the mails of Dr Shivani and Dr. Jayaraman.  

  

The authentic voices of Dr. Jayaraman at the outset and Dr. Shivani who gave the final blow - are indeed highly commendable, and hold a mirror to their righteous indignation and commensurate braveness in raising their voice against a reprehensible iniquity.

  

With his uncanny insight, Dr. Chamu Krishna Sastry cautioned me (and a few others)

,

even before the "Open" Forum began

,

that a bashing of the Hindu heritage

was

about to begin on stage.

H

alf an hour before the "Open" Forum began

,

Dr. Varakhedieven

sent a mail

to Dr. Adheesh Sathaye purporting that one-sided representation on the stage is unbecoming and

can

lead to

bias,

ill-will and embarassment. Sensing trouble, and just minutes before the "Open" Forum commenced, Dr. Adheesh Sathaye came to me and beseeched in his suave, placatory, and almost imploratory voice that peace be maintained, and to listen patiently to the experiences that the

invited speakers

, "our honourable guests",

were to present.  
  

It is obvious from these that what happened on the stage was clearly agenda-driven and

was

so predictable

, after all

.

  

Dr. Chamu Krishna Sastry endeavoured to drive sense into the brains of the (Orwellian) Double-speak experts by showing the living example of Veda Vijnana Gurukula, and even presented the Principal of the esteemed institution before the audience for any clarification, and backed his statements with statistics. All fell on

the

stone-deaf ears that adorned the stage

which also

held on to the mike as though they would never get

yet

another opportunity to address

a quiescent

audience non-stop. They were apprehensive perhaps that no other organiser of such a conference would collude with them so well to give a one-sided presentation.  
  

The trio on the stage so very well exemplified the opening verse of Nīlakaṇṭha Dīkṣita's

Kali-viḍambana:  

na bhetavyaṁ, na boddhavyaṁ,

***   *na śrāvyaṁ vādino vacaḥ* \|***

***jhaṭiti prativaktavyam***

***   sabhāsu vijigīṣubhiḥ \|\|***

  

For an international event of that scale, wherein even a Union Minister was to take part in an official manner, greater transparency was indeed called for: What exactly was the deal, then, between the organisers and the doctors on the stage who were more or less given the assurance that the audience would be patient no end? Should not those be sued for libel who branded the

generally

reticent and restrained

audience as hooliganistic? It is difficult to gauge the impunity, impertinence, and intransigence of the intolerant elements that adorned the stage.  

  

To be styled an "Open" forum, it would have been behoving had the organisers betrayed a modicum of sense in planning and announcing at the outset that a last half an hour would be reserved for an interactive session (after an hour or so of the presentation by the panelists). The audience grew a little restless only towards the fag end of the allotted duration of the program, when there did not seem to be even the slightest provision for the audience to raise issues.Even then, there was nothing that can be legitimately labeled as trolling (= "inflammatory or inappropriate messages") - only raising of concerns.

  

The least that the organisers of the conference must do is

\- to publish

an uncensored video of the "Open" Forum, retract the uncivilised epithets they have showered on the patient

and scholarly

audience, and issue a public apology, and promise to behave responsibly henceforth.
