Respected Scholars,

  

I am going through the discussions on caste and the condition of women.

  

Why do we not compare the condition of various classes and of women in Europe during Feudalism and those of various classes and of women in Pre-Independent India?

  

Why did a Revolution like the one in France not take place in India?
What were the conditions of working men and women in England during the Industrial Revolution?

  

Why are Christians leaving the church today? How the church in the West and in America is plagued with sex scandals even today? How the church engages in covering such scandals?

  

Are race relations secular in today's Europe and America?

  

When did women get the right to vote in Europe and America?

  

All these question need to be asked to those who seek to wantonly criticise the Caste System and the condition of women in India in Feudal times.

  

Achyut Karve.
