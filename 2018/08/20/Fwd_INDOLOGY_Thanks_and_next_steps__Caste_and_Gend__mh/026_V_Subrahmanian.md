We do have in the Bh.Gita:

  

मयाऽध्यक्षेण प्रकृतिःसूयते सचराचरम्। हेतुनाऽनेन कौन्तेय जगद्विपरिवर्तते।।9.10।। A clear acknowledgement by Bhagavan that the 'She' is the actual 'prasuutikaa' / prasavitree.

  

We also have by the same Lord the other statement:

  

मम योनिर्महद्ब्रह्म तस्मिन्गर्भं दधाम्यहम्। संभवः सर्वभूतानां ततो भवति भारत। 14.3 where the Purusha clearly specifying that 'mahat brahma' = prakriti in this context, and that is His yoni where He places the seed. Although it is not to be literally understood, still, the role of the Purusha and Prakriti in creation is clearly demarcated and understood.
