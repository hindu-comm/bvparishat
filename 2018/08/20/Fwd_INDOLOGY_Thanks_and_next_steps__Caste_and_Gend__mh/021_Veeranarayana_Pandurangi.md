I congratulate My friend Shivani, colleague too, for her 'first' post in an age. I enjoyed it. I am (and whole india should be )proud of her style, choice of words, most importantly the subject.

  

The problem is that we don't write it. Many of the members of bvp were there in wsc including Profs Aklujkar, Anuradha chaudhari, jayaraman and others. Now I am happy they are sharing their experiences. We expect more.

  

  

The writing makes things look authentic. That is case of Dr Vajapeyi. We have seen prof. Girish nath jha's response to her pieces earlier.

  

I hope Dr shivani will write again and again in the forum.
