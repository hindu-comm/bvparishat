Pranaam

I appreciate, "अतः मनसि प्रश्न उपतिष्ठति - किं विश्वसंस्कृतसम्मेलनम् इति समस्तपदे 'विश्व' इति विशेषणपदं 'भारतीय'इति शब्देन परिवर्त्य भारते एव सम्लेलनं सीमितं कुर्मः इति ।"

The first-hand status report suggests that this WSC is no more different from the last one. Also, since participants are from around the world, the East and the West, differences in "opinion and intents" are natural, and we all know about it.

  

Even if we can not replace the'World" for 'Indian' or still better "Bharatiya" in WSC, I am curious to know if there is a SanskritSociety in India representing the"AkhilBharatiya" status, like Indian Science Congress? Not to be confused with the literal title if there already exists one. Hope my point is clear. We must minimize dependence on external forces.

Need is to consolidate the scattered individual or Institutional efforts.

Best Wishes

Regards

Sati Shankar
