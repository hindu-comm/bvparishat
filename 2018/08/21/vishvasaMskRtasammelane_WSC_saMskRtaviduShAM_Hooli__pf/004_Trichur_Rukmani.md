Hello Jayaraman,

I think you as a direct participant in the said session, have given a firsthand account of what transpired there. Written in your beautiful, simple Sanskrit and presented in an objective manner I think, if you can get this translated into English and sent to the Hindu paper as a rejoinder to Ananya's reporting it might clarify a lot of the points raised by the writer of that report. My concern is with the general perception that Sanskrit scholars are in general very close minded and this write up by Ananya only added grist to that perception. In fact two of my neighbours came to me after reading it and wondered how this is possible in an international scholarly meeting and almost insinuated that it is because of '**these orthodox conservative attitude**' of Sanskrit scholars..Having been associated with the IASS for a very long time it pains me to see that, as reported by you, only one side of the picture was presented and the session ended up perpetuating the old paradigm of '**women bashing'**.

Thank you once again Jayaraman
