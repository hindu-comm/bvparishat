Dear all,

I happened to give a talk in Sanskrit recently in the Sanskrit Academy, Hyderabad. The topic was 'The Relevance of Vedanta in Modern Times'. The academy has uploaded the talk in the following link.

Scholars may excuse me for the grammatical errors, which are due to lack of practice. I am posting this merely to provoke young scholars to pursue study of original Sanskrit texts.
