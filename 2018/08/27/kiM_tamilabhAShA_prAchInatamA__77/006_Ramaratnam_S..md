The PM's speech on Tamil must be viewed as an arthavada vakya and not as a vidhi vakya. He must have only meant that Tamil is one of the oldest languages of the world. He was not speaking on a political platform, nor was he speaking in Tamil Nadu, nor has he started his election campaign yet. Moreover by just saying that Tamil is the oldest language he is not going to win all the 39 seats from Tamil Nadu in the election. We know it and the PM knows it much better than us. He is not at the mercy of any particular state and he does not have to indulge in any political gimmicks, as expressed by some of the members. He has got his own standing in the political arena and the people will decide on the issue of the next PM of India.
