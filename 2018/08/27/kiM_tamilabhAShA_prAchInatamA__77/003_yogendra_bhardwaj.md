Many kavyas are available in tamil language which are similar in sanskrit, I mean tamil linguists or writers followed sanskrit and lots of words are available which are adopted from sanskrit by Tamil. No doubt that tamil is one of the ancient language and one of our indian classical language.

I think that sanskrit is ancient than tamil. Parhaps modi ji said "Tamil is most ancient language." For voting purpose only. But this is a mistake which can again create debate between two language's followers. So we have to be attentive and decent debate for it's conclusion.

Your suggestions welcome💐.
