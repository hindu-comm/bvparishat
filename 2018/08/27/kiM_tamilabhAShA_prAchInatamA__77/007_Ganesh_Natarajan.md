It looks like a political overture only. Otherwise it is clear that Sanskrit is more ancient than Tamil. The oldest available book in Tamil ("Tholkappiam") follows many Samskrit grammar rules even without change in the names.... Even as per puranic history, Agastya who is one of the composers of hymns in Rgveda came to south and initiated the Tamil language. PM may not be unaware of these facts. But not sure why he is telling like this... This is the 2nd time he has uttered this.....

  

Regards,

Ganesh.
