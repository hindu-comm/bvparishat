1. If a word very close to a word found in Tamil today is found in the earliest Vedic text, it does not compellingly prove Tamil to be either contemporary to or earlier than that earliest Vedic text because there is a very great possibility that Tamil shares those words along with many other Dravidian languages.

  

That is why people have been using the phrase 'Dravidian family influence' on the language of the Vedas and not 'Tamil influence'.

  

2.Specific dates of 'origin' of languages do not exist. Historical Linguists estimate a rough period around which a given language could have got 'separated' into an 'independent' language from its cognate languages. This means the period around which this language and its cognate language which were earlier mutually intelligible dialects changed into mutually unintelligible tongues. As per the Indo-European Language Family theory of origin of Sanskrit, period (not date) of origin of Sanskrit is the period during which it became unintelligible to the cognate Indo-Iranian languages. Similarly period of origin of Tamil is the period during which Tamil became unintelligible to its cognate Dravidian languages. All these periods are are pre-historic i.e., belong to a time which has no written records and the periods are assigned on the basis of certain methods of historical linguistics.

  

If the period assigned to Tamil's separation as an independent language from its cognate Dravidian languages is older than the period assigned to the separation of Vedic Sanskrit from its cognate Indo-Iranian languages, then only Tamil can be called a pre-Vedic language.
