Just in order to provide a 'pramana' from the Tamil literature that Tamil enthusiasts might quote, there is an ancient verse in old Tamil works that says that 'Shiva 'gave' Samskrita to Panini and its 'equal' Tamil to Agasthya in the yore': \[Kanchi puranam and Tiruvilayaadal puraanam\]:

Srivaishnavas (followers of Ramanuja) believe that the Azhwars, some of them, were of a period much more than 4000 years ago.

//Before we outline their number of pAsurams (as to how it gets added to 4000), let us see their origin and dates of birth. Tradition assigns high antiquity to the AzhwArs taking them to 4200 BCE to 2700 BCE and also regards them as Divine incarnations (as amsaas of the Lord¡¦s paraphernalia). According to guru paramparas, the first four AzhwArs namely Poigai AzhwAr, BhUtatthAzhwAr, PEyAzhwAr and Thirumazhisai AzhwAr were born at the end of Dwapara yuga, which corresponds to 4200 BCE. Madhurakavi also is belived to be born in Dwapara yuga corresponding to 3200 BCE. NammAzhwAr, KulasekarAzhwAr, PeriyAzhwAr and ANdAL were born during the first century of Kaliyuga which approximates to 3103 BCE to 3003 BCE. The remaining three AzhwArs ThoNdaradippodi AzhwAr, ThiruppAN AzhwAr and Thirumangai AzhwAr took birth in the years of 298, 343 and 399 respectively in the Kaliyuga which corresponds to 2803, 2758 and 2702 BCE. (From A Govindacharya, the Holy lives of Alwars). //

  

According to some, Kannada is perhaps the oldest language.
