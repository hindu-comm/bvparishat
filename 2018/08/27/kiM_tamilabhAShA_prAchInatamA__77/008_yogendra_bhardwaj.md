Sorry to say, Mr.PM modi said that "tamil is the oldest language of the world before vedas. Sanskrit also contributed something for indian culture" what is this view? This is ridiculous , actually what are you saying ?It is matter for us because you are representing India, you are representing us mean people. Than why are you saying like that?You are not illiterate, not low level thinker ....Than???

Think again ....

You have to know "Manimekhlai" "shilapaddikaram" like these kavyas followed sanskrit and other things, you know about words.

Next is what? like Indo-Aryan theory will be arise and north-south conflicts start after these statements ...So sanskrit people should be meet with Shri Modi ji and ask about this statement and clear it.
