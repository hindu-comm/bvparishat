Dear Sirs,

  

I agree with Sri. Yogesh Bharadhwajji in this regard. Our honourable Prime minister Sri. Modiji may be a pramaaNa-puruSha in the areas of his competence. But he is certainly not so in this issue. More over, it may be a mistake of his personal/official resource-persons' as well. As pointed out by Sri. Yogeshji, this could also be a political move to allure the Tamil masses. Any way, he should not have committed such a mistake. Having occupied such high offices people should be more careful and responsible. But we should never forget or even ignore the fact that Sri. Modiji's commitment for Sanskrit, India and sanaatanadharma is far more greater than any of our present political leaders and people of power. Hence any criticism in this regard, especially from this group (BVP) should be balanced and considerate. This is what I humbly wish to submit.

  

With utmost regards

  

Ganesh
