Thank you Prof. Wakankar Sir. I have a copy published by Sanskrit Vidya Samithi, Chennai under the supervision of Shri.Srivatsankacharya.

  

However, am looking for the usages of avyayAs for daily usage in my daily conversations with my sanskrit friends. Sometimes, I have to grope for proper words and the conversation stops in between. Proper usage of avyaya keeps the conversation flowing smoothly.

  

rgs,

sriram
