Dear Sir,

  

Pl.refer to the excellent Avyayakosha brought out some 20/30 years back by the Kuppuswamy Sastri Research Institute, Mylapore, Madras-600004.

There is another book in Sanskrit published some 20 years back by Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan,Tirupati,dealing with Idioms in Sanskrit etc.

  

You must have got the old book,A Guide to Sanskrit Composition, by V.S.Ghate.

  

Best luck in your search.

  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
