Wrong. ने+अक ए is not in पदान्त and does not take पररूप. It will become नयक only. Here the splitting is incorrect.

नी is the root meaning to carry/lead and ण्वुल् is the suffix becoming अक having the meaning doer. Both give give the meaning one who leads, i.e. leader.



अयादिसन्धि means ए, ओ, ऐ, औ takes अय्, अव्, आय्, आव् respectively before vowels.
