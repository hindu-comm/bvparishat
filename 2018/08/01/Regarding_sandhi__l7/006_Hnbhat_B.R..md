You are wrongly splitting and asking for meaning. Your first letter contains confusion about अयादिसन्धि. Fist learn अयादिसन्धि correctly and then ask for meaning. Also learn the difference between सन्धि and समास.

  

अयादिसन्धि means ए, ओ, ऐ, औ takes अय्, अव्, आय्, आव् respectively before vowels.



Please join respectively as above the split sandhi by you and see if they give correct forms as नायक etc. and if not your splitting is wrong. ने and अक will give only नयक when joined and not नायक.

  

To know the word formation, you will have to learn grammar.
