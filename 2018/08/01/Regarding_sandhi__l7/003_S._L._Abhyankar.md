नमस्ते श्रीमन् रायवरपु-पवनकुमार-महोदय !

  

Inदेव +आलय; - देवालय; the Sandhi is done, because it is compulsory to do Sandhi, when composing a compound word.

  

Howeverनायक is not a compound word. It is a derived word. In Sanskrit, words are "derived" by affixing prefixes प्रादयः (उपसर्गाः क्रियायोगे)and suffixes प्रत्यय-s. Understanding "derivation" of a word is understanding its etymology. The wordनायक is derived from धातुः नी.

  

In Apte's dictionaryat \<<https://dsalsrv04.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/apte_query.py?page=888>\>.etymology ofनायक is given asनायक*a.*\[नी-ण्वुल्\] Guiding, leading, conducting

  

Etymology or derivation is not simple. To put etymology ofनायक*from*नी, may I put it asनी => नय् => नायक. As can be seen,न in नय् has become ना. That is a वृद्धि-प्रक्रिया and not a संधि of ने+अक.

  

Actuallyसंधि of ने+अक would becomeने$क, not even नयक. because in the instance of एङ: पदान्तादति the सूत्रम् एचोऽयवायावः does not apply.

  

The root cause of your confusion is due to your premise thatनायक is ने+अक. It is not.
