I agree with Dr. Rukmini in paying compliments to Dr. Adheesh, as I was one of those who attended the WSC, Vancouver. With 18 panels and an equal number of sessions, taking place simultaneously at different rooms for full five days, it was not easy to organise a conference of this magnitude. And then there were evening programme like the Kudiyattam. There were so many queries and questions at the table. Dr. Adheesh managed them all with a smile. He was here, there and everywhere. He was courteous to everybody. I can quote just one example. He had met my wife, Mrs. Sasikala just once at a meeting in Chennai, a couple of years back. At the UBC lounge he spotted her, identified her by name and greeted her saying that her name was the same as that of his mother. Leaving alone one particular unpalatable session, about which we have already had a long discussion, all other sessions were informative, useful and well attended. It may not be possible to mention the names of speakers and their thought provoking papers here but one can say that it was a rewarding experience. Dr. Adheesh was ably assisted by Dr. Ashok Aklujkar and his wife, Dr. Vidyullekha. She presented a paper on several manifestations of Rama being present at different places at the same time (Ananda Ramayana). Being inspired it, it looked as though she herself was present at different places at the same time. She looked after the coffee breaks so nicely that one forgot about the breakfast, lunch and dinner. Once she noticed that non-egg eaters had a small problem. For the next break she immediately ordered vegetable somas and milk cakes. Therefore we can forget about the one particular incident and pay accolades to Dr. Adheesh generously for the excellent way he conducted the conference. एको हि दोषो गुणसंनिपाते निमज्जतीन्दोः किरणेश्विवाङ्कः /
