One review:

  

This book provides details of various yagnas and how & when to perform the yagnas.  
  

Another review

  

While this book is not a practical, how-to manual on the procedure of yagyas,..........  

  

....... and indeed there is a small appendix dedicated to Smarta yagyas which provides some mantras, yantras, and procedural instructions..........
