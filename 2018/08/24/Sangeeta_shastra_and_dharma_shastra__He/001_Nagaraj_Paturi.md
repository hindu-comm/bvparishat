Dear Sri Agni,

  

The content in the article to which you provided the link and the topic that you discuss in your post are completely two different worlds not connected to each other.

  

The content in the article is about Carnatic music being used for Christian devotional songs.It is a response to protests in some quarters to such use of classical Carnatic as 'plagiarism', 'cultural misappropriation' etc.

  

You are discussing whether upavedas are allowed for nonbrahmin nondvija varnas etc.

  

There is absolutely no connection between the two topics.

  

To your question of Indian classical music and varNa /caste, please be reminded that the art of Naadasvaram has been always in the hands of two communities: 1. The caste who. have hair cutting , massaging, ethnomedicine and ritual instrumental music as their caste occupation

2\. The Muslim community called pinjaar ( the greatest celebrity of the art Sheik Chinna Moulana <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheik_Chinna_Moulana>

was an example.

<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheik_Mahaboob_Subhani>  

<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasim-Babu_Brothers>  

are other examples from the community.

  

The vaaggeyakaaras ( singer-poets) of mystic yogic songs have been mostly nonbrahmins and they composed and sang their zongs in classical Carnatic only.
