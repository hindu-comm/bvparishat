Respected Agni ji,  
  
What sastras teach is science and thus anyone who applies them gets  
results of some sort. But if the result is not used for the purpose it  
is mentioned in the same sastras, then no ultimate well-being (śreya)  
will be derived.  
  
For instance aṣṭāṅga-yoga is mentioned with eight aṅgas beginning with  
yama, niyama, āsana, prāṇāyama. One who follows till asana or  
pranayama will achieve good health and peaceful mind. But then today  
people use these steps to get good health and use it to engage more in  
bhoga (sensual enjoyment). Original purpose of yoga-sastra was to get  
rid off sensual attachment and reach samādhi, the last stage of  
astanga-yoga (due to which it was known as yoga).  
But today purpose is bhoga, and thus it should be called BHOGA and not YOGA.  
  
Similar is the case here as you have asked -- can sastriya sangeet be  
used in worshipping Jesus?  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
