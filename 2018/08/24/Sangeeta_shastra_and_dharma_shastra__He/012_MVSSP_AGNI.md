Sir. I agree with you and I feel with out attaining the yama standards
no one can achieve the standards of aasana or pranayama. Now a days these are just physical satisfaction of feeling yoga. Not a real yogam.
But here in this case I never asked weather they reach the nada Brahman but asked only is there any condition which restricts those practices.
Being its a new dimension these may not be answered by shastra directly but the ultimatum of the thought is not worship but to promote conversion hence can we say that it's wrong. I asked only because I just want to know is there any nishedha in shastra .
