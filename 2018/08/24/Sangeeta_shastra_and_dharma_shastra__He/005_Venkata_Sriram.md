Let christians sing their own songs. Chrismas Carols are there. No problem !

  

But hijacking our vaaggeyakaaraa's kirtanas composed by Annamayya, Purandara Dasa etc., singing the same lyrics by replacing with Jesus is objectionable for us.

  

A sheer and shameless plagiarism !! And our karnatic singers like Krishna, OS Arun, Aruna Sairam, Nithyasree Mahadevan ...all are sold for money and dancing to their tunes !

  

Hopeless fellows !

  

rgs,

sriram
