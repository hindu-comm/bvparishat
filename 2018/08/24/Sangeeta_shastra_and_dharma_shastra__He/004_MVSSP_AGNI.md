Nagaraj paturi sir thank you for your reply. My question is completely different from the article but the article is the base for my question hence I mentioned it. By your answer iam not completely satisfied. I know that any varna can study the samgeeta because of that I mentioned "chaturvarna phala pradam". There are several lower caste people such as mala dasari in alwars and several nayanars who sung about the god. The surdas is a sudra and the raskhan is a muslim. My question is not about study of them in sangeetam . It's about dharma shastra's application in samgeeta shastra especially in the present scenario of kritis on jesus/ non hindu god. Although all people are allowed to learn sangeetam can the creation of kriti in mela karta ragas on jesus/non hindu gods is acceptable or not. I need the version of dharma shastra and the version of samgeeta shastra on this.
