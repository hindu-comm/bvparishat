In the above mentioned article the writer specifies that there is no such type of copying . He also tells that using others views and terminologies is there in practice. "Chinne moole naiva vruksho na saakhaaha ". I asked slokas in dharma shastra and samgeeta shastra. if its there in the same shastra then using mela karta ragas by non hindus becomes a wrong act by dharma shastra. It becomes a sin.
