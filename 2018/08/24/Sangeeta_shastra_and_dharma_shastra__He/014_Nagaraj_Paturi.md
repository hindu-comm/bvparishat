There is resistance too from within Christianity itself to such adoption :

A whole host of pagan practices and symbols were absorbed into Christianity. In an effort to convert those worshipping pagan religions, the old pagan ideas were simply given new names and assigned new meanings. One of the better-known examples of religious syncretism is Christmas. Christmas was invented as a substitute for the older, pagan Yule celebrations. Instead of worshipping a sun god on the 25th of December, the pagan was told he was now worshipping the Son of God. The symbols and rituals and practices all remained, only under new labels. Bible evidence shows that the birth of Christ was in the fall of the year, likely late September or early October at the latest, and not on December 25th. The Bible in no wise institutes the worship of the birth of Jesus, much less authorizes the absorption of pagan religious practices.

There are many examples of syncretism in the modern Christian religion. Another example is Easter, which is loaded with symbols, practices and rituals incorporated from ancient Greek and Roman pagan celebrations surrounding spring fertility. The pagan practices of the worship of Ishtar, the fertility goddess, were absorbed into Christianity. The new meaning given was to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ. But the Bible does not institute the worship of the resurrection.

### Christmas, Syncretism, and Presumption

##### byJohn W. Ritenbaugh *Forerunner*, "Personal," December 2001

  

  

**Joseph's Drive to Expand**

Before he died, Jacob made a prophecy regarding the traits of his descendants, the tribes of Israel, "in the last days" ([Genesis 49:1](https://www.bibletools.org/index.cfm/fuseaction/bible.show/sVerseID/1475/eVerseID/1475 "verse")). Notice what he says about Joseph: "Joseph is a fruitful bough, a fruitful bough by a well; his branches run over the wall" (verse 22). The people of Joseph are a productive lot. To produce goods and services requires a vast amount of energy—call it zeal, enthusiasm, or drive. They live in a well-watered land that enhances agriculture and industry. The people are so driven that they extend their influence and zeal beyond the boundaries of their countries.

Historically, the people of Joseph have moved into other countries, taken the raw materials to make their products, built manufacturing plants, and influenced the native culture. When the British or Americans colonized, they brought their way of life and imposed it on the natives. Americans continue to introduce movies, television, rock music, household appliances, big cars, etc., to impoverished nations around the globe.

These things just typify the inherent drive of the people of Joseph, a proclivity to expand beyond the frontiers in every endeavor. They are an aggressive and innovative people in science, industry, education, government, and religion. This is generally beneficial and productive, but in one area, religion, it has profound repercussions.[Satan](https://www.cgg.org/index.cfm/fuseaction/Audio.details/ID/167/Satan-Part-1.htm "library")has taken advantage of this characteristic, producing a religion that allows Israelites to think that they are Christian and yet still be free to explore the frontiers of religious thought.

This proclivity is not confined to the people of Joseph, as we can see by tracing God's revelation to man. God first gave His religion to Israel through[Moses](https://www.cgg.org/index.cfm/fuseaction/Audio.details/ID/2226/Moses-Servant-God.htm "library"), and later, through Jesus Christ by means of the[Holy Spirit](https://www.cgg.org/index.cfm/fuseaction/Library.sr/CT/RA/k/1648/What-Is-Holy-Spirit.htm "library"), He gave to His church an improved, spiritual religion based upon the original. The early apostles preached and taught this revelation, writing books that provide for us the foundation for Christianity.

But what has happened through the centuries? People have felt free to expand their religious horizons into areas of thinking far removed from the orthodox teachings of the Bible. They say, "Isn't this idea interesting? Wouldn't it be good if Christianity absorbed this? Look at the benefits it would bring!" Thus, they throw away the holy days and the[Sabbath](http://www.sabbath.org/), but accept pagan holidays, the[trinity](https://www.cgg.org/index.cfm/fuseaction/Library.topic/ID/378/Trinity.htm "library"), and heaven and[hell](https://www.cgg.org/index.cfm/fuseaction/Audio.details/ID/3548/Disproving-Hell.htm "library"). Through the centuries, the truth is forgotten, and the false ideas that sprang from human reason become a major part of the religion.
