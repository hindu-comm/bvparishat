Sir,

  

Most of us believers in sanaatana dharma, follow a shishtaachaara and sampradaaya. If the music trinity is taken as a pramana, the parameshthi Guru to new age scholars like TM Krishna and the like, Sri Muthuswami Dikshitar composed about [39 kritis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottuswara) using western scale that is equal to Sankarabharana raaga. He sang them in Sanskirtam and the worshipped god was not obviously 'Jesus.'

  

We blissfully forget their contributions and service to our own dharma, by stirring controversies.

  

A Muslim cleric in Hyderabad, recites innumerable number of slokas from Vedas, Puranas only to demonstrate that 'Allah' has been mentioned at several places in Samskrita literature. The gullible people are slowly getting convinced that 'tenets of Islam are no different than Hinduism' and nothing wrong in converting to Islam as our literature amply refers to their religion/god/prophet. But do we have the concept of 'kaaphirs' in sanaatana dharma, as their holy book teaches? May I remind you the infamous debate between the traitor Zakir Naik and Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, a few years back?  

  

Most of the Churches in Kerala (possibly in TN too) have a 'dhwaja' installed and they light the deepams/candles and probably performing the naivedya. Why are we falling deaf ears on what is being appropriated from our own tradition. Europian currency may be stronger than rupee, many times, but now most part of the Europe is being dominated and controlled by Muslim community.Do we allow India to be only next to Europe? I need not remind anyone here, how the East Indian company penetrated its tentacles during colonization.  

  

A 'language' may not have nothing to with religion. But here, we neither have just a language nor a 'religion,' because Samskritam is much much more than a mere language. You know it better as a Sanskrit poet, right?

  

I really appreciate Sri Sriram for his bold words.  

  

Thanks,

Prasad
