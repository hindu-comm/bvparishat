Again, may I repeat the same.

  

We should know which topic is dealt by which s'aastra.

  

Dharmas'aastra is not the place to look for answer for your question.

  

Dharmas'aastra does not cover issues like 'religion', 'other religion' etc.

  

Sangeetas'aastra does not cover this question either.

  

Even if, for the sake of argument, consider for a moment that they cover this question and prohibit such singing, law of the land today doesn't help you to implement that.

  

The article by T M Krishna to which you provided link, is not responding to the questions it claims to be responding. It shows , due to
confusion of concepts on the part of the author of the article, intertextuality among the texts of Sangeetas'aastra and the lyrics of vaaggeyakaaras and among various texts of lyrics of vaaggeyakaras , deliberate allusions of one vaageyakara to the older one or to s'aastra lines as an aesthetic poetic technique as the same as what is happening in the classical Carnatic Christian lyrics.

  

There are many Hindu-Christian syncretic practices among sections of Indian Christians. How much of it is part of the natural tendency in Indian cultural history and how much of it is part of the well known well documented approach of Christian evangelists to use 'Hindu' cultural practices to harvest is always a question of debate.

  

The present issue is centred around that.
