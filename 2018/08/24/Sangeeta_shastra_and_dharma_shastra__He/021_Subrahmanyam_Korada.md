नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

"chaturvarna phalapradam" .This facility will allow you or not is a doubtful one when creation of kritis in mela karta ragas for worshipping of Jesus/ any other non hindu god

  

                                   
----- Vidvan MVSSP Agni  

  

First of all try to understand that there is no God in आर्यसम्प्रदाय -- it is a rough translation ---

(roughly = without claim to accuracy )

a person who answered - a hen has got three legs - is awarded First Prize ( because it is nearer to the actual answer - two and others said - four / five etc .)

In translation the nearest one or the word with some semblance is accepted when an exact equivalent is not available --

  

व्याकरणम् is not Grammar

  

विवाह is not marriage

  

दानम् is not donation

  

पुण्यम् is not merit

  

तपस् is not penance

  

ईश्वर (अष्टैश्वर्ययुक्तः) , भगवान् (षड्गुणयुक्तः) etc are used to denote ' God " .

  

अनुकरणम् -- धर्मः / अधर्मः -- is discussed by Patanjali under ऋलृक् , but it is within आर्यधर्म , not at all with regard

to अन्यधर्म ।

  

Any such activity would be agitating to the followers of आर्यधर्म and leads to a chain reaction .

  

अनुद्वेगकरं वचः (गीता) - is उपलक्षणम् ( etc. ) . So it is अधर्म ।

  

धन्यो’स्मि
