Vedic hymns have divine mathematics. Not a letter can change. You can see checksum at the end for validation.

  

Regarding language different from religion. Let us see if any of these who want to try...play around with other religions and come.back alive..then we can talk...Let us have a level.playing field to even entertain the question.

  

Still here is my answer ....Sanathana dharma is based on gratitude and respect. That is why we start with gurubhyonamah. By playing around with names they are disrespecting the very foundation on which all artifacts are based. In that case ..answer is no...disrespect and ingratude is not welcome. Simple.

  

Still..If someone wants to eat their shit and asks what Vedas says about it...I can only laugh...
