Thanks for reply venkata sriram ji. Iam asking that writing kritis on jesus / non hindu god is allowed by dharma shastra or not . I want to know the slokas of dharma shastra/ samgeeta shastra which stops such type of practices. The rules and regulations of sangeetam are followed and they didn't violated the rules of sangeetam or ragas in the present case of jesus - Carnatic album. But the issue is if such creation is allowed by dharma shastra or not. If no version is there as restriction then these people are the creators of a new era. It's a great reform too. Hence I want to know the version of both the shastras in this case .
