Can a code of conduct of conduct of community A be applicable to community B?

  

Will the community B follow the code of conduct of community A?

  

Community A can have a principle that it does not allow community B to harm its (community A's) life, property, culture, identity etc. Why/ it is not even a principle. It is just a basic instinct to save oneself or one's own group from aggression from the other group. It not be part of code of conduct at all.

  

But since Dharma s'aastra describes/prescribes these issues as right cum duties of different varNas, protection of vilnerable individuals from the aggressor individuals of the same group and protection of the whole group from individuals and groups attacking it from outside has been described /prescribed as the duty of the kshatriya varNa.

  

-----------------------

  

Using adoption of the cultural elements of the community which is the target of religious conversion for the purpose of conversion taking it as an evangelical strategy is dishonest and unethical.

  

The article you referred to, does not address this question of dishonesty and unethicality. It does not distinguish between intra-religious intertextuality and emulation that involves and contributes to the identity of the community and inter-religious imitation that harms that identity and is employed as an evangelical strategy.
