Dear BVK Sastry Ji,

  

Thank you very much for your time and detailed responses to my queries. I first seek your apology if I have hurt your/anybody's beliefs. Let me explain my point of view of asking the questions...

  

I am exploring Bharatiya history based on the Samskrit literature, available books etc. In this context I infer that after Brahmana's period, Sutra period starts, where many great rishis have formulated the

sutras for each veda shakha (like Baudyana, Apastamba etc.). Sandhyavandanam is an age old practice which should have started during that time. Exploring on that, will give more information, is my thought process, which propelled me to ask the below questions. In that aspect, I am not exploring them as a western would do. I want to understand the difference in the context of various shakhas to find out the significance of the difference.

  

Let me take an example, we say "sapta rishis". During my study on this topic I found that (i) Rg veda lists 7 rishis ("Seers of Rg veda - V G Rahurkar), (ii) Mahabharata lists sapta rishis. (iii)In our Sandhyavandanam also we recite sapta rishi names. I noted slight differences in the names between these 3..... Hence I wanted to explore on them...

  

And I humbly deny your view that the Rishis are not human beings. Because based on my understanding, they were the "mantra drashtas" (who have seen these mantras) through their great yogic power and tapas. The
अनुक्रमणीmentions the Rishis name also. Hence I am not able to understand your point that the rishis are mystical and never refer to a person who lived in the yore.

  

Request you to share your thoughts/any references, which will help me in this regard...

  

Thanks again,

Ganesh.
