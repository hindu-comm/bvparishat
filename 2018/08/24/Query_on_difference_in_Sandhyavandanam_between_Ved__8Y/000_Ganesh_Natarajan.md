Dear scholars,

  

I would like to get some clarification regarding various Sandhyavandanam procedures. I think there are slight differences between the Sandhyavandam of various Vedas. For example we get separate book for 'Yajur veda Sandhyavandanam' , 'Rg veda Sandhyavandam' etc.  

  

1\. What differs mainly in these?

  

2\. Does the list of Rishis differ in any way? \[ In Krishna Yajur I recite - "Atri, Bruhu, Kutsa, Vasistha, Gautama, Kashyapa, Angirasa rishayaha..." is it same across all veda shakhas of Sandhyavandam?

  

  2a. Any idea why the above particular order is maintained? Can we assume its chronologically arranged? (like Atri is most ancient)

  

3\. Is their any difference between Iyer/Aiyangars Sandhyavandana?

  

4\. Is there any book/research paper already done on 'comparing the sandhyavandana procedure'?

  

5\. I can see the below versions in the internet: (i) "Krishna Yajur", (ii) "Rg veda (iii) "Sama veda" (iv) Sukla Yajur Kanva Saka. Is there any other version available?

  

6\. Is there a Sandhyavandanam procedure based on Atharva veda?

  

7\. Does Tarpanam also has different versions?

  

Thanks in advance for your time.

  

Thanks,

Ganesh.
