Namaste



My responses on the questions below are indented and placed below. This and topics like this almost end up as ‘Chit-Chat- Curios’ and ‘ Social Media Titi-Bits’ for over years and across several group posts. In reality, these details are meant for practical implementation ( abhyaasa –anushthana) and not for ‘ pravachana – charchaa’.



If you had followed the theme of ‘ VINIYOGA’ mentioned several times by Dr. Yadu in this forum, and ‘ contemplated on ‘Samskrutham as Vak-Yoga’ in my earlier posts, these issues would have been clerarer.

Dear scholars,



I would like to get some clarification regarding various Sandhyavandanam procedures. I think there are slight differences between the Sandhyavandam of various Vedas. For example we get separate book for 'Yajur veda Sandhyavandanam' , 'Rg veda Sandhyavandam' etc.

^^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry ( on ‘slight differneces )** : The differences are clear, unique, instructions on Applied Yoga for specific goals under specific heads of Vedas.

 The revenue to government comes from many streams. But specific stream of Income Tax has different format/ department and procedures , which is different from ‘Excise, customs…’.

 The administrative formats and names keep changing and get updated/ customized for context. So does the modes of payment. Some pay direct; some go on line; some pay by card !





------------------------------------------





1\. What differs mainly in these?

^^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry ( on what differs )** : Applied Yoga Instructions for Customized Practice of Sandhyavandanam : The UTILITY APPLICATION BENEFIT = SANDHYAVANANDANA JAPA -VINIYOGA





------------------------------------------



2\. Does the list of Rishis differ in any way? \[ In Krishna Yajur I recite - "Atri, Bruhu, Kutsa, Vasistha, Gautama, Kashyapa, Angirasa rishayaha..." is it same across all veda shakhas of Sandhyavandam?

^^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry ( on list of Rishi’s)** : Yes. They do differ and serve different purposes.





------------------------------------------



  2a. Any idea why the above particular order is maintained? Can we assume its chronologically arranged? (like Atri is most ancient)

^^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry ( on Rishi particular order – Ancient or modern )** :
**This question is inappropriate and offensive to tradition**. Veda is a Darshana and ‘ TIME- PLACE TRANSCENDENT’ ( Ateendriya- Apaurusheya). The Rishi associated with Veda Mantra , also is a ‘ Yoga- Kriyaa’ to be used in ‘Sandhyaa – practice’ in a given order. (Rishi is NOT a NAMED PERSON) . The sequence of Rishi’s is a sequence of Applied Yoga Instructions to be practiced in the Sandhyavandana as Applied Yoga.



This understanding is provided by Yaska and several other works, who consider ‘Samskrutham as ‘Vak-Yoga’: The language of ‘Vedas (**Mantra- Chandas**), The language of Consciousness (**Brahma**), the Language of **Yoga**, The Language of **Devataa**’, the Sequential sounds of Cosmic Music heard by the Seer ( **Shruti – Sukta- Rushi Darshana**).



*Where did one loose this fundamental understanding given in tradition ?* When Colonials made the proposition of ‘ Historic Veda, Migrating bards bringing an alien language to India’; and the proposition has been gulped, assimilated to blood and brains and repeated by ‘ current scholars’. This is where ‘ The Cow ( GauH = Knowledge of Samskrutham) got corrupted and failed to capture the starting point of ‘ Patanjali Mahabhashya’ reading –‘ Atha GauH ityatra kaH shabdaH ?’ And Yaska’s listing of Veda-Shabdas used in ‘Brahma-karma part of Sandhyavandanam ) as ‘ GauH- gmaa –jmaa - kshaa…’.





The researchers of ‘Sanskrit and disciplines of tradition narrated using the language: Sanskrit’ are no doubt serious persons and scholars, looking for ‘ live benefits from Sandhyavandanam’ ; but the material they are using for research is ‘ a text body on a postmortem table’. 



Therefore, where one should be asking for ‘What is ‘Atri Rushi – Yoga Kriyaa’ instruction associated with ‘Gayatri’ , the inappropriate question asked is ‘ Ancientness of Atri as a historic person’. This is the inappropriateness.



------------------------------------------





3\. Is their any difference between Iyer/Aiyangars Sandhyavandana?

^^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry ( on practice differences )** : Yes. Each system advocates does ‘Sandhyavandanam’ as a ‘ Customized- Personalized Practice of Vedic Yoga, technically called as ‘ Swaadhyaaya, Brahma- Karma’, Ishwara – Pranidhaana’, Tapas.



In current practice, the practice is used as a ‘ cultural specificity marker’ in a ‘ ritual’. How will wearing ‘ Bhasma- Vibhooti’ make a difference for Sanhyavandanam from wearing ‘ Gopichandanam’ or ‘ Pundra Naamas’ ??

Tradition has an answer for these as ‘Yoga- Vedanta Combined prakriya’, for a UTILITY- APPLICATION BENEFIT and groom ‘ IDENTITY OF BRAHMANA COMMUNITY’.

Modern Communities have an answer as a ‘ Cultural identity marker’ to divide the ‘ BRAHMANA COMMUNITY by marks on face and body .





------------------------------------------





4\. Is there any book/research paper already done on 'comparing the sandhyavandana procedure'?

^^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry ( on Sandhyavandana Research )** : Partially and Peripherally, like seeking the difference between a red and black cow !

 The current models used and practiced are a ‘ loose exploration, without a focus, lacking clarity on what to look for, working with inaccurate postulates on ‘Historic Veda and Yoga’,

 Such ‘ Cyber Academic’ approach is not research in modern sense (= Objective Scientific ) or traditional sense (= Tapas / Jijnyaasaa/ Meemaamsaa).

Such approached are chit-chats, without ever having a concern ( Shraddhaa – Vairagya – Adhikaara) for understanding ‘ UTILITY- APPLICATION OF SANSHYAVANDANAM’.

It is Like studying ‘COW’ by skin color and body size without ever thinking ‘ Why Cow’ ? (= VINIYOGA of GauH).

Exemplary knowledge on skin color of cow does not help to understand the taste of ‘ milk’ or change the change the’ color of milk’ given by cow.





------------------------------------------





5\. I can see the below versions in the internet: (i) "Krishna Yajur", (ii) "Rg veda (iii) "Sama veda" (iv) Sukla Yajur Kanva Saka. Is there any other version available?

^^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry ( on Veda Specific Sandhyavandana procedures )** : Yes, Pl. check with traditional schools and practitioners.





------------------------------------------





6\. Is there a Sandhyavandanam procedure based on Atharva veda?

^^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry ( on Atharvana veda Sandhyavandana procedure )** : Yes. And many modifications of it also.





------------------------------------------



7\. Does Tarpanam also has different versions?

^^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry ( on 7- Tarpanam )** : The answer is yes. ‘Tarpanam’ is a procedure of mystic end, to feed and quench thirst of several ancestors ( if one trusts and believes the tradition).



The procedure, timing, materials used are all different !



If living human beings are uniquely different, why not the departed ones journeying through their ‘uniquely different Karma cycles’ ? There is no ‘Single Hell OR Single Heaven OR Single ‘God’ OR Single Life process postulate in Vedic Traditions.



‘ Bahoonaam janmanaam Ante, jnanavaan maam prapadyate’

‘ Vasaamsi jeernaani yathaa vihaaya, navaani ghunaati naroparaani’ …





------------------------------------------





Thanks in advance for your time.



Thanks,

Ganesh.
