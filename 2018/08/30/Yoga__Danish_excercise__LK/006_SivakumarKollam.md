SAdara pranAm

Recently read the title "SIVANADA KILLED YOGA" in which many of my doubts including that on vajroli got cleared.

A westerner can fully understand any of ancient sastra only if he changed his mindset by sitting with a master like in the case of Sir Jone Woodruff.Such genuine foreigners are little.

Having heard Sri Malhotra we can suspect the international conspiracy to convert to Christianity,as the Pope has already declared openly that 21st century is set for converting whole of Asia and YOGA is a good impediment for.

More deplorable fact is that Indian academicians who are with an eye of international fame praises all such nonsensical literature.

Of course' let noble thoughts comes to us from all world'

  

With pranAm
