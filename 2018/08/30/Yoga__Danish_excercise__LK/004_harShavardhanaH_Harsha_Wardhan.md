Namaskar to all

  

The Hatha Yoga Project (<http://hyp.soas.ac.uk/publications/>) at the SOAS in Oxford University is doing excellent work in this matter. They have brought out a yoga nighantu, sort of. It is called Roots of Yoga (<http://hyp.soas.ac.uk/roots-of-yoga/>), and it clearly documents the ancient origins of hatha yoga practices. Edited by HYP leader James Mallinson, who I find is an impartial scholar and incidentally a Natha sampradaya mahant himself.

  

Incidentally, the latest paper from him on Vajroli mudra, the most controversial part of Hatha:<https://www.academia.edu/37387077/Mallinson_2018_Yoga_and_Sex_What_is_the_Purpose_of_Vajrol%C4%ABmudr%C4%81_.pdf>

  

best

Harsha
