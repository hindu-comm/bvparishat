The book you allude to as 'impartial' is co-authored by the person who actually makes the claim that 'modern' Yoga is Danish. Mark Singleton, also a faculty at SOAS, and a collaborator of James Mallinson, makes the claim in his '*Yoga Body, the Origins of Modern Posture Practice'*.  
  
Worse, Mallinson, a Mahant of the 'Ramanandi Sampradaya', (a news story that was quite popular \~2y back) shares the views of Mark Singleton, as noted in this interview.

Attestation by a Mahant lends immense credibility to this view.
