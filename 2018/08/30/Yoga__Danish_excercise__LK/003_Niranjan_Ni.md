Trying to find all answers in the Yoga Sutras is not a good approach.

Patanjali an avatara of adishesha and an amsha of Baladeva is considered the Deity of Yoga.

  

Why would the Lord of Yoga bother beyond stating "sthiram sukham Asanam" --whatever is needed is covered eloquently in that sutra.

  

Another point for consideration is asana for Yogis was a starting point for meditation rather than the circus act it has been made into by the Yoga alliance and American "Yogis" and "Yoginis". Add deviants like Bikram and you get Hot Yoga. Pls dont go looking for that either in ancient books.  

  

There are many works like Gheranda samhita, Goraksha shataka and other works that will give you the basic poses. Many like the asana you suggested were probably derived later independently as a special case of parvatasana.  
  
Paul Brunton met a Yogi near Adayar in Chennai who was practising many many more postures than what is available in the public domain. Hatha Yoga has died out nearly in India while it is still practiced by certain adepts in Nepal and Tibet. The vidya is the same only the temporary custodians have changed.

  

Also this is a feature that came from the martial arts into the mainstream. Much of instruction in ancient India as you know was through Guru Vak and was not documented or very rarely done so.

Rest assured I have seen and met adepts who can answer for atleast 2000 years of history of this art form in India. What that so called western scholar says is his own speculation.

  

The vidya is still available to the deserving and those of good faith. Not to people who wish to commercialise and brand themselves. There are 2 existing schools one in Kolli hills in Tamilnadu and another in the Himalayas that hide themselves fiercely. I have seen their adepts do stuff that you would consider magic or sorcery.

  

One adept told me that it is not so much the pose but the movement of the prana facilitated after opening certain varmas that helps in healing and rejuvenation. The pose is only half of the puzzle.
