I don't know if you can see it behind the pay-wall. I don't want to reproduce the entire article for copyright reasons. While, there are some good points thatKwame Anthony Appiah makes, I'd like to draw you attention to the following:

  

"In reality, what most people know today as yoga—postures, breathing exercises—has little precedent in premodern sources. You’ll search the ancient Yoga Sutras in vain for the downward-facing dog or the other famous poses. The story of their origins is, in part, the story of Western physical-culture manuals devoted to calisthenics and gymnastics. In fact, the scholar Mark Singleton has detailed specific similarities between yoga and a Danish gymnastics system that was taken up in the early years of the 20th century by the British and others."

  

It's amazing that one person can write some nonsense, and how it gets propagated. Didn't we have a special panel discussing 13th century texts which discuss yoga poses in detail? Who is this Mark Singleton and is he part of the anti-India/Sanskrit mafia?
