I may have been hasty in praising the author without fully considering the subtleties of the issue on hand. The book is excellent, no doubt, and I stand by my review. What I had in mind when I wrote that, is this: I recalled reading somewhere that Mallinson seemed to have modified his stance, as it came to be noted that some original compilation texts he is translating at HYP, like the Hathasanketachandrika and the Hathabhashyapaddhati, had big chunks of text devoted to asanas of Hatha proper that were as detailed and varied as those in vogue today. (Don't seem to be able to trace it today, but the issue is moot.)

  

Here's my position: When I use the term Yoga, I automatically mean pranayama and dhyana primarily, while asanas I take to be just the preliminaries. When the rest of the world uses the term Yoga, particularly the west, they mean asanas primarily. Given the numerous dharanas and kumbhakas already noted, the existence of numerous asanas (not a mere handful) is a given to me. It is quite elementary: a culture that had sense and strength enough to think up a system as elaborate as Yoga, and devoted many millennia to its refinement, must have had practitioners and thinkers who must have taken the time to tinker with something as basic as body positions. Hatha tradition tells us there are 84,000 asanas - the number may seem fanciful to neophytes, but I think it signifies a huge asana corpus yet to be unearthed, or perhaps lost to time.  

  

I had flaming debates with many westerners and halfwits on internet forums in the light of the controversy over the Mysore palace exercises and Tirumalai Krishnamacharya's additions/modifications to the asana corpus. I withdrew after realizing that my position and those of my detractors had no common meeting point.

  

There is also another point often glossed over - an artificial divide is sought to be put in between the Yoga traditions as appertaining to the Vedic/Brahmanical tradition and the Buddhist tradition. This is so patently false and misleading. Some enterprising "researchers" are endeavoring to show that Yoga is Buddhist in origin and that the Brahmins appropriated it. What bosh.

  

Mallinson's overall approach strikes me as balanced, nonetheless. He cannot, of course, transcend his milieu's zeitgeist. But that should not detract from his merits. Regardless of their position, the West is doing excellent research work in Yoga. We should learn from them.
