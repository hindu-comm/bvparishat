Chicago – Among the handful of white Europeans speaking at the World Hindu Congress 2018 to be held here fromSep. 7-9, is independent Belgian scholar Koenraad Elst, PhD, who is scheduled to speakSep. 8on “Implications of mis-portrayal of Hindus on Bharat’s policies and destiny.” Elst has a**track record of publicly critiquing Western Indologists for theoretical stances derived more from collective prejudice than incontrovertible evidence.**

·***How did you become exposed to Indian culture and whence this abiding sympathy for Hinduism?***

I’m from a provincial Belgian Flemish background, but my father, though a staunch Catholic, was a committed Hatha Yoga practitioner. When I began searching for my own truth, I took up Chinese and Indian philology and history. Later I was in Varanasi researching Indian philosophy.**My meeting in 1989 with historian and publisher Sita Ram Goel catalyzed this radically new chapter in my life.**

·***What are the key Indological controversies that your publications have addressed?***

This was also when I was exposed to my first controversy: Ayodhya.**The consensus had been of a Hindu temple forcibly replaced by Babri Masjid.** But “eminent historians” suddenly turned that consensus into a “Hindu fascist concoction” such that reasonable settlement became impossible. In the polarization that followed, the whole of Western academe fell in line with the eminences, which served as an argument of authority for their brand-new orthodoxy.

That controversy forced me to study the theology of Islamic iconoclasm. My first major publication, in Dutch, was on the controversy about*The Satanic Verses*, Salman Rushdie’s novel about the beginnings of Islam, esp. its turn against the three goddesses of pagan Arabia and thus against polytheism. It is little-known that the Rushdie affair had started as a ramification of the Ayodhya conflict.

In the 1980s I still espoused the Aryan invasion theory, not knowing it was already being questioned by KD Sethna through his research on cotton, absent in Rig-Veda but evidenced in the Harappan archaeological record. Reading his book in 1990 against the linguistic background, I realized there was no real proof for the established view that the Indo-Aryans came from Central Asia. More evidence has since accumulated for India itself as homeland of the Indo-European (“Aryan”) language family.

Mahatma Gandhi was a complex figure, and some of the good said about him is still true. But the negative side has been pushed under the carpet because, by being murdered, he became a saint, never to be questioned. I thought the time had come to restore the balance. Assassin Nathuram Godse had a case, and many of his contemporaries were on the same wavelength, but it became unsayable.

·***How has the Western academy received your counter-theses and treated you personally?***

**The Ayodhya controversy made me a pariah.**That is why I really savored the news in 2003 that the foundations had been dug up and the pre-existence of the temple had become undeniable. A few “eminent historians” in Delhi still tried to sow doubts, but most understood that the game was up. Not that anyone has formally conceded, let alone apologized, but the sudden silence about the historical side of the affair is eloquent enough. In 2010, after the court verdict acknowledged the Hindu claim to the site, I received congratulations from one of the American professors hated by Hindus for a stance deemed sacrilegious. But that was about all.

I was nevertheless fortunate in an intellectual sense. Firstly, my stance opened the doors of the otherwise secretive Hindu movement, which allowed me to write a remarkable**Ph.D. thesis about it, published as*Decolonizing the Hindu Mind***. Secondly, I was still around to witness the moment when the old consensus got vindicated and all the eminences had egg on their faces.

My article on*The Satanic Verses*was published in a Belgian Leftist journal, because in those days the European Left was still candidly secular, not in the Indian sense of “anti-Hindu.” A few years later, though, it became militantly pro-Islamic and therefore started treating me with hostility. In India, the power equation in academia has not changed, not even under the Vajpayee and Modi governments: so,**both in the West and in India, I am*persona non grata***. Though Islam has lost my interest, I am still reduced to my positions on it. However, the torch has been taken over by ex-Muslims, who write in the same vein as me. No*fatwa*can stop it anymore, not from the Mullahs nor from “eminent historians.”

My pleas for the Out-of-India Theory likewise led to exclusion, but less grimly. Evidence in favor of OIT is accumulating, and the younger generation of scholars is acknowledging it as a contender.**In Belgium, I have been re-accepted by Orientalists and Indo-Europeanists as one of them.**

Chicago –Belgian scholar Koenraad Elst, PhD, will be speaking onSeptember 8at the Chicago World Hindu Congress 2018 on “Implications of mis-portrayal of Hindus on Bharat’s policies and destiny.” The second part of the interview with him is given below. The first part was published last week in India Post issue dated August 24:

·*How would you evaluate University of Chicago’s Indology output?*

The portrayal of Hinduism by Wendy Doniger is mediocre and biased. That her Veda translation is flawed has been pointed out by other Indologists. The shoddiness of her view of Hindu history, wrongly called “alternative”, is not in doubt.**However, the Hindu reaction of trying to get her book pulped has turned it into a free speech issue, transforming their detractor into a martyr.**

·*Are Indian unity and Hindu identity necessarily compromised if Indo-Aryans had come from outside?*

No, of course not. Switzerland was started by a confederacy of a few German-speaking regions, then joined by a few French and Italian regions who liked this political formula, regardless of ethnic origins. It is a much healthier state than, for instance, Belgium.**Groups of different provenances can get together around a unifying idea**, and Dharma could be just that.

Numerous countries have an immigration or conquest as their founding myth, including the United States. And even if the “Aryans” had immigrated, that event would be some 3500 years ago, which is much earlier than, say, the population that turned Australia into a modern state.**The grimness of the whole debate is a bit ridiculous. The British understood how useful this otherwise academic theory could be in legitimizing their colonization and to pit one Indian group against another, both on linguistic and on caste lines. Numerous Indians interiorized it and, whereas in Europe this quaint Homeland question is now of little interest, you can still hear it debated across the Lok Sabha benches.**

·*Can India’s Muslims become authentically Swadesi (‘indigenous’) without disowning Islam?*

**Having lived through apostasy myself and witnessed the walk-out from the Church of most of my nation, I am convinced that “disowning Islam” need not be so dramatic.** Many will try to have it both ways: bend over backwards, or rather bend the teachings of their religion, to make them palatable to modern sensibilities. Content-wise, this would have to become a religion that Mohammed could not have recognized as his own (without*jihad*or*shari’a*?), though a step in the right direction. By contrast, it is very harmful for outsiders to join this rosy but false view of Islam.**Alarm over Islamization in Europe is overdone, but it is rendered plausible by appeasement policies.**

Whether this makes Muslims or ex-Muslims more “Swadeshi”, more “Indian”, is not my concern, nor is it their own. It is an**RSS mode of thinking, stemming from the high tide of nationalism after World War 1, and the Indian freedom struggle**. Globally, nationalist doctrine has gone out of favor and, nationally, India has been master of its own house since 71 years.

·*Why are Hindus often unable to articulate issues and sometimes even take offense at your criticism?*

**Their eagerness to please, to smoothen sharp edges and lower their distinctive profile, is a large part of the problem.**On Islam, I advocate critical thinking about the doctrine but sympathy towards its believers; Hindus mostly do the reverse. MS Golwalkar said: “Islam is a great religion, but the Muslims are great fools!” Thus, Hindus fall for the sheer buffoonery that temple destruction is “against the tenets of Islam.” It is**just like the behavior of Western statesmen who keep bombing and invading Middle Eastern countries but praise Islam to the skies. Watch out with these ‘Islamophiles’: they kill Muslims by the thousands; whereas critics of Islam have never harmed a Muslim.**

**Another source of friction is my applying the historical method to Hindu tradition.**Thus, the Rig-Vedic text itself shows that it is the product of a specific time and place, viz. bronze-age Northwest India. This is not liked by traditionalists for whom it is the ‘Hindu’ equivalent of the Quran, God-given at the time of Creation, standing outside history. It gives details about historical people and developments. Similarly, I second Western scholarly opinion that the Vedic hymns had no knowledge of reincarnation.**Hindus would prefer everything to be*sanatana*(eternal).**

Anyway, it is indeed the case that Hindus often prove “unable to articulate issues.” This is mainly due to never coming to grips with outside reality.**I see Hindus mostly attempting to convince each other or preaching to the choir. Far better to solicit feedback from the enemy, or at any rate from reality.**
