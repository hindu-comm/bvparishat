Respected Scholars,

  

My apologies for posting a non-sanskrit post, since this is regarding Freeing Temples from State Control.  

  

It is familiar fact that Temple Trusts come under State Government but they have provided lot of details and historic information in very crisp way. For example, if we ever wondered/criticized why there are PAID DARSHAN in Hindu Temples, it is worth spending few minutes of time.

  

It is from a Chennai based [Indic Collective Trust](http://www.indiccollective.org/).

You may watch the same video at Swarajya along with the article, <https://swarajyamag.com/videos/watch-j-sai-deepak-of-indic-collective-on-freeing-temples-from-state-control>  

  

Dhanyoshmi,

Sunil
