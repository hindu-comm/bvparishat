This is a veryinterestingarticle givingan idea of the status of scientificknowledge about Cosmos and Prof.Ashtekar's contribution to it bringing out a parallelism between Advaita/Buddhism and the nature of the universe as per physics. I believe it will be of interest to several scholars in this group.
