Thank you Dr M Deshpande for posting the information on,

"Schliemann had found Troy—and the remains of civilizations coming before and after it. And on shards of pottery and sculpture throughout the layers, he found [at least 1,800](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/40812?msg=welcome_stranger) variations on the same symbol: spindle-whorls, or swastikas."

If I remember correctly it was Hittite city. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
