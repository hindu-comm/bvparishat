Dear members,

  

Please find the first and second circulars concerning an International
Conference to be held in Odisha, India. Some relevant Newspaper articles are also attached. I request the members to participate in large numbers and make it a grand success. I also request that wide publicity be given to the Conference - colleagues, friends and students may be informed, copy of the circular may be put up on the notice board and the social media may also be utilized to spread the news. We will be indebted to the members for this kind gesture.

  

with regards,

Dr.S.Ramaratnam,

Vice Chancellor,

Jagadguru Kripalu University,

Odisha
