Respected scholars,

  

TheManthanabhairava Tantra is one of the most important texts besides of the Kubjika-mata in Trika-Saivism.

The Kumarika khandam portion of it has been published in english translation in several volumes.

  

Are the entire sanskrit text or the translations available online?
