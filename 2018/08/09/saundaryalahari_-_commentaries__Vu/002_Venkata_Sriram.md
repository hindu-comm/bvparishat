Thank you Shankara Ji...A scholar told me that Vidyaranya's commentary is also available in Kamakoti Peetha. AFAIK, Vidyaranya didn't write any commentary on SL. I checked with few scholars there and also sthAnika archaka of Kamakshi temple (brother of Kamakoti Sastrigal).
They don't have any clue of Vidyaranya's commentary.

  

Are you aware of this Sir?

  

rgs,

sriram
