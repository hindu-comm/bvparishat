Dear scholars,

The verse अल्पीयसापि यत्नेन शब्दमुच्चारितं मतिः । यदि वा नैव गृह्णाति वर्णं वा सकलं स्फुटम् ॥ has been quoted by Abhinavagupta in *Dhvanyalokalocana.* In the Kasi edition (with the *Balapriya* commentary ) it is ascribed to Bhartrhari. However it seems that the verse appears in the *Slokavarttika.* Iwould like to get the exact reference. Could anyone get me the same. Thanking in advance, nks.
