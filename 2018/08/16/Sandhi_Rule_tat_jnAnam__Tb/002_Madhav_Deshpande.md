Dear Krishnaprasad Ji,

  

  The sounds represented by the letter ज्ञ are ज्+ञ. Therefore, तत्+ज्ञानम् is phonetically the same as तत्+ ज्+ञानम्. Here there are two processes, 1) voicing of त् before ज् \[by झलां जश् झशि\] and the change of the resulting द् to ज् before ज्+ञानम् \[by स्तो: श्चुना श्चु:\]. Thus we get the final result तज्+ज्ञानम् which is phonetically the same as तज्+ज्+ञानम्.
