Respected Scholars,

  

May I put forth a Note written by BhimsenShastriji with repect to the Sūtra ‘vāvasāne’ 8.4.56 (and I translate here his comments from Hindi to English), “Various grammarians think that ‘vāvasāne’ is an exception – apavāda to the Sūtra ‘jhalāṃ jaśo'nte’ 8.2.39.Consequently, in the form ‘rāmāt’, the exception ‘vāvasāne’ applies first to change the /t/ to /t/ \[remembering the Paribhāṣā ‘parjanyavallakṣaṇapravr̥ttiḥ’\] and then only as an alternative – pakṣa does one change the /t/ to /d/ by ‘jhalāṃ jaśo'nte’ 8.2.39…. However I am not of this opinion. Because by accepting this one will be unable to reach the two forms ratnamuṭ and ratnamuḍ from ratnamuṣ. Since cartva will effect first by 8.4.56 /ṣ/ shall change to /ṣ/ and then jaśtva by 8.2.39 effects alternatively to change /ṣ/ to /ḍ/; but the form ratnamuṭ with a /ṭ/ shall remain unobtained”.

Thus, as per Shastriji, jaśtva by 8.2.39 is effected first and then an alternative cartva in avasāna.

  

Now, Kanshi Ram in his Laghu under ‘vāvasāne’ 8.4.56 adheres to cartva first and jaśtva next. He writes, “ The grammatical procedure adopted is in consonance with Jñānendra Saraswatī’s view which in the context of this rule is worth noticing. He says the application of the sūtra ‘jhalāṃ jaśo'nte’ 8.2.39 should not precede that of the presnt sūtra \[‘vāvasāne’ 8.4.56\]. Instead by virtue of the Paribhāṣā ‘yena nāprāpte yo vidhirārabyate sa tasya bādhako bhavati’ the present Sūtra \[‘vāvasāne’ 8.4.56\] is considered to be an exception to ‘jhalāṃ jaśo'nte’ 8.2.39 in the avasāna instance. So being an exception, the present sūtra \[‘vāvasāne’ 8.4.56\] applies and the pada-final phoneme /t/ is replaced by /t/. Since the sūtra ‘vāvasāne’ 8.4.56 is optional, the rule ‘jhalāṃ jaśo'nte’ 8.2.39 applies in the alternative and the pada-final /t/ is replaced by /d/.”

  

Hope I have not derailed the discussion at hand.

  

In addition, although I canot remember the reference at this point, there is another discussion on whether ‘tad’ is dakārānta or takārānta in the gaṇapāṭha and the conclusion, taking support of the wording of a Pāṇinian Sūtra veers towards it being a dakārānta.
