Dr Iyengar,

Thank you.

I am sending you the paper privately.

You may get answers to the questions.

We go with the view of a universality of expression (neural, cognitive) and rendering as localization (vascular, muscular)

Samagaana would be a class of rendering like any other language.

We will discuss more after you read the paper.

Best regards,

BM
