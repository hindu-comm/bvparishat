\> I contacted Deepro Chakrabarti and received from him his presentation. It is full of information, I am trying to get the paper of Dr. Neelotpala Gandhi from Gujarat University.

  

Please ask them to share their papers on BVP or you please share them with their permission.

  

I wish Amritam of Sanskrit was only organised at WSC and Amritam of the 400 to 500 papers received the attention of the English print media and that attention was shared on BVP.
