Friends,

I did ask during WSC XVII if anyone wanted to check the slides.

I sent to all who requested.

i did not post since the topic is theoretical and tilts to neuroscience.

I am posting the slides as the PDF file. It would only make sense if you have followed our previous work.

You would enjoy if you join the field of studies in speech science.

You may write to me if you wish to pursue thesis work for advanced degree.

The principal goal of our work is to study how does a thought signal convert itself into an acoustic signal.

This includes the segmentation process and the organization. We are utterly speculative in the paper,

a lot more neural analysis is being made. We are making a mathematical model to create the signal.

I will send you the full paper if you would have further interest. I won't post publicly.

Best regards,

BM
