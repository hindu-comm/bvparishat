Namaste



A post with many points to address.



1**. RNI** : You are right in asking for the current science relevant question \< Nevertheless I am interested in speculating how Vedic ancestors might have mapped "thought signals on to acoustic signals".>.



 This certainly is asking how to explain a current phenomenon of Life where in ‘Thought is articulated as Language Speech in Time- Space Context, with a conscious construction of a sequence of sounds, generated through a physiological /neural activity , triggered and guided by an ‘ instrumentally intangible, abstract entity called ‘ Thought’ emanating as a ‘ Transformation of Mind- in Action’ ( =
Vivakshita - artha vaachaka - vakya nirmitih :: Smrutyuttha vaak-roopa- Chitta – Vrutti) and filtered through the apparatus of ‘ Buddhi’ ?? This is the foundational line of Vedic Philosophy
connecting ‘ Language to Consciousness’ and expressed as ‘ Bhashaa is Brahmi/ Sarasvati Devataa’. 



This shift surely begins with a demand for unlocking the clutter of ‘history- Indology – Theology – Previous publication reference’ on Samskruth research . 



***On ‘Saama- Gaanam’ and Panini tradition*** : There are sutras which prescribe how to get to right accents in ‘Saama Gana’ as a part of ‘ Samskruth Language’ ; More specific detailing comes in Pratishaakhyas which build Panini’s work with special enhancements for Veda –specificity. Starting reference : Panini :: 1\\.2\\.34 yaj\~nakarmaNyajapanyU\~NkhasAmasu .



**On ‘ Music without limitation of Knowledge’** : As far as I understand, traditional grammarians like Patanjali, Bhartruhari leave the discussions of ‘ philosophy of music’ to the disciplines of ‘ Rasa Sutra / Rasa –Shaastra ( Natya Shaastra) which use the concept of
‘ Vak-Yoga’ ( which explains ‘ music without language:: Technically called Antar- Naada in Ashtaanga yoga esoteric practices;).



I remember writings from ‘ [Ta.Ra.Su](http://Ta.Ra.Su), Kannada writer on ‘ Bhairavi Venkata Subbaiah’ ( filmed as ‘ Hamsa Geethe); DVG’s work – ‘ Kalopaasakaru’ ; Shishunaala Shariff’s works ;and a book on ‘ Karnataka Musician Kempegowda, (a contemporary of Swamy vivekanda ) on this theme. There are references, historical within the frame of the past century, where ‘ accomplished musicians are said to have experience and witness the ‘ inner music flow ( Naada – Raaga Pravaaha) as a part of ‘ aalapanaa’ as witness without conscious intervention. That part of singing where musician resonates totally with the Nature, making one’s body an instrument – media for cosmic tunes to flow effortlessly is said to be highest order of musical performance. Swami Tyagarajas compositions, Deekshitars compositions are said to be of this order. Some say Sri Jayachamarajendra wodeyar had this level of ‘ Music sensitivity accomplishment’. Same / Similar thing happens with Veda chanting in highly charged environments where Yogi’s chant. This was part of narratives of ‘ Ashtaanga Yoga Vijnana Mandira’ at Bangalore. The term ‘ Sarasvati Darshana, Naada –Darshana, Antarnaada’ are used in this connection. The music learning system associated with the name of Hanuman is said to be addressing this goal. Technical Yoga Upanishads like Naada- Bindu Upanishat provides practice guidance to explore various phases of this ‘ Music without limitation of Varna- Akshara Sounds and grammars’. This is all ‘ Naada – Anusandhaana – Samadhi’ instructions which emanates from looking at Samskruth as the language of ‘ Yoga’ for attaining ‘ Higher level of awareness and sensitivity,
where one has the ability to ‘ See the Spoken Word’. 



 This line of thinking is built using the Vedic / Upanishadic expression ‘ Purushasya Vak rasah’ and term ‘ Vak- Jyotih’. It is a live tradition, not to the liking of social linguists, indologists, consciousness researchers carrying dislike for ‘ adhyaatma traditions and preferring only ‘Bhakti’ soft path !



 The superstructure on this (forgotten foundation and discarded
fundamentals of ‘ Shabdaartha Shareera ( From Bhartruhari) / Vagartha- yuktataa from Kalidasa / Veda- Akshara from Paninian tradition /
Akshara –Brahma Yoga from Gita tradition ) are connected to ‘ Four level analysis of ‘ Para- Pashyanti- Madhyama Vaikhari’ ( Patanjali: Chatvaari Vaak parimitaa padaani..) ; the ‘ Rasa’, the ‘ Naada – Svara / Varna- Akshara concepts. ( The term Naada-Swara has now become synonymous with ‘ Naaga- Swara, a wind instrument used by snake charmer and magicians to generate Serpent attracting Sounds ! !
Thanks to the mass media maniac models of entertainment promotion .



2**. Misra ji** : Thanks for sharing the presentation slides. Please share me also your paper on the line of research and thinking on ‘a universality of expression (neural, cognitive) and rendering as localization (vascular, muscular)> It would be a study at the intersection of ‘ Sciences and Instrumentation connecting the
phenomenon of Language as a Mind activity which shows footprints on speakers Physiology and impressions on Psychology’.



 My exploration so far has lead me to form a hypothesis on these issues. And several papers with a research status carry a fundamental hermeneutic error of ‘ Inaccurate Translation and mapping of Samskruth Technical key terms :: Manas / Chitta/ Buddhi / Smruti / Bhashaa / Vak/ Indriya / Shareera … .



 Unfortunate as it stands, those who have interest don’t get the support to explore ; And those who have resources go lone wolf way to use freebie resources infested **with inaccurate models**.

 Summarily, the total work seems to be going on in island mode - orchestra model ! lacking ‘ unity of focus and clarity on ‘What the traditional perspective has presented in the technicality of the words : **Saanga** ( Shadanga - Upaanga – Vedaanga ) – **Veda – Addhyayana needing ‘Samskrutham of Panini- Patanjali- Yaska Sampradaya.**



( **Note**: The expression **‘ inaccurate’** is made by an arbitrary preference of taking the traditional schools and texts as a reference; in case it is worth and valuable to do so; call it an emotional block if one thinks so ! May be one should look at the source texts with a dispassionate ‘ Rushi Darshana view’ to get to the ‘**Universality of Expression’** locked in texts. This calls for abinitio fresh thinking and shifts in ‘ Language –Pedagogy – Research models from ‘ History and External Instrumentation measure – locked
approach’ to ‘ Internal Human ‘ **Shareera – Chitta- Vrutti ’**
Instrumentation measure model using Yoga of Gitas’ for Re-Search ).
Are we ready, as a team for creating a ground for this paradigm shift and upgrade ? 



3**. Narayan Joshi ji** : On \< Please feed us Amritam of Sanskrit.
\> ‘Samskrutham – Yoga – Amrutam’ package is lost in transit between the historic time line 17^(th) century on wards. The Navigation system of Samskruth learning- Researching Pedagogy of Panini-Patanjali- Yaaska is virus infected and needs a re-boot. Only then would ‘ Yoga’ get liberated from the ‘ Yoga-Studios’ and help to discover ‘ Samskrutham which is Vak-Yoga’.



What is the plan for Team work ? or ‘Dharma Kshetra’ or ‘ Kuru-Kshetra ‘ model of operation ?? Both have their clear choices, resource needs and final deliverables. ‘ Amruth Manthan needs taming the ‘dragon, tying it to mountain and churning the ocean and be ready to face ‘ deadly poison before elixir of Life’.
