Respected scholars, Namaskar!

Many scholars from India attended WSC2018. Why are they not telling us of papers of their interests? their presentations? Scholars of Indian origin working in USA also attended WSC. Why are wenot hearing about their presentations? I contacted Deepro Chakrabarti and received from him his presentation. It is full of information, I am trying to get the paper of Dr. Neelotpala Gandhi from Gujarat University. Why focus on one single event when 400 to 500 papers presented in WSC? Please feed us Amritam of Sanskrit. Thank you. NRJOSHI
