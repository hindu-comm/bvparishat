Dear Dr.BVK, Thanks for your helpful response. I will look into the commentary onPanini ::1\\.2\\.34 yaj\~nakarmaNyajapanyU\~NkhasAmasu.

  

Please note I did not sayMusic without limitation of *Knowledge.* **I don't know what you mean by this.** Please clarify.

  

Your".....singing where musician **resonates totally with the Nature**, making one’s body an instrument – media for cosmic tunes to
flow effortlessly...." is well taken. Yes, I know about the Kannada references cited by you. This is what I meant as language without consonants. Quite interestingly Jaiminiya Upanishad Brahmana(I.2. 3-7)upholds this as the basis for Saamagaana. The language is archaic but the sense of the text is clear. Please keep me posted about non-musicology Sanskrit texts that refer (even cursorily) to Saamagaana and/or Sangiita. At CAHC we are working on this topic.

  

Thanks

RNI
