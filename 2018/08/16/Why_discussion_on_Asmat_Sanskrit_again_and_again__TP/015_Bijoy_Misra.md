Dear Dr Joshi,

This is a method of segmentation that we think defines the phenomenology. In a larger sense it is the "context",

which would have a longer time scale that the rendering, which is more "dynamic".

In a mathematical way, the rendering is a dissipation of the instability created by the stimulus.

I will explain more in our modeling paper that we are creating. I will inform when we complete.

Best regards,

BM
