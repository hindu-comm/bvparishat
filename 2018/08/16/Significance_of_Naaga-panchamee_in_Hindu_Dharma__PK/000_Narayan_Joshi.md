Respected scholars, Namaskar!

  

Today is Naaga panchamee. What is its importance in the month of Shraavana? In Indian temples, sometimes one finds two intertwined naagas carved on stone slab and lying under a tree. Why are snakes and naagas a part of Hindu religion? Vishnu is lying on cobra, Shankar has snake around his neck. I know Puranic stories but why to worship Naagas today on Naaga panchamee day? Thanks.
