With regard to such practices Sampradaya may differ from region to region. In the Tamil region the पितृतर्पण is commenced usually after the आब्दिकश्राद्ध.

Dear members,

When to start doing pitru tarpana?  

After completion of 1st aabdeekam or from the eclipse in case if it occurs within the year or from the very next amaavaasya which occurs after the 12th day sapindeekaranam?
