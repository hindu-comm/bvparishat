Namaste,

  

Attaching a paper 'Viduraniti A Political & Cultural Study by Ramchandra Tiwari published in 1958 in JIH.

  

You could also refer to the works of Ludwik Sternbach on Chanakyaniti. Detailed bibliography is available in Ludwik Sternbach Felicitation volume 1.  

  

You might already be familiar with Shodhganga site. There are a few Ph.D. theses on Vidruraniti and other niti texts at this site. Giving below links to 2 such works.
