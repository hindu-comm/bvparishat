The common langoti/kaupina worn by brahmacharins and sannyasins who are not into wrestling or related martial arts, involves just a kaTi sUtram, a thick thread that is readily available, that is permanently tied round the waist. The kaupina, generally a white cotton cloth of about two feet length and six inches width, is inserted in between the kaTi sutram and the point of the navel so as to make a two-layer hanging of the koupina cloth. Then both the layers are taken back in between the thighs to be secured in the kaTi sutra that is touching the spinal cord on the back waist. It is a very simple process unlike the somewhat complicated time consuming method of the ones demonstrated in the videos. And the kaupina is worn not on any undergarment; it directly touches the private parts. It is almost like the one in the picture here:

Hope this helps.
