Dear Listmembers:

  

In traditional circles it is well recognised in tradition that Pehelwans who practice Kushti and Yogis like Samartha Ramdas and the Nath Sampradaya Gurus adviced wearing Langot or a Kaupina that apart from protecting the lower back and the testicles, also helped in preserving brahmacharya.

  

It has come to my attention through interaction with pehelwans and yogis that the there are atleast 2 different form of the langot.

  

1\. As a Triangular piece of cotton ending in a long rectangular tail

2\. A long piece of rectangular cloth

  

While 1. is more commonly used in modern akharas, the rectangular cloth was tied tightly around the waist more in the style of a kaccha thereby binding the lower lumbar back (L5-L1) and the hernia more securely than 1. which just binds these in 1 layer of protection.

  

Are there any learned members who can throw a broad and deep light on how the Langot was tradiitonally worn for different purposes? i.e the different ways of tying the Langot/ Kaupina?

  

It would be interesting that Shri Adi Shankara Bhagavatpada has even written a poem on the kaupina / langot which is a required cloth worn by Sanyasis.

  

Thanks,

  

Niranjan
