Dear Members,

  

Just to clarify:  

  

It is well documented that both Brahmacharis and Sanyasis are to compulsorily use

LANGOT / LANGOTA / KAUPINA for maintaining brahmacharya and practice of Yoga .

  

There are different ways of binding a langota

  

1\. Triangle shaped cloth as shown here:-

The above is mostly used in akharas for Kushti

  

2\. There is another type which involves a long cotton cloth as shown here:-

I am looking for some clarification about the second method.

  

Regards,
