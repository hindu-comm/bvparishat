\|\|Hare Krishna\|\|  
  
I came across following sloka in Hari Bhakti Vilasa which is mentioned  
to be from Devi Agama:  
  
devy-āgame śrī-śivoktau—  
guru-śayyāsanaṁ yānaṁ pāduke pāda-pīṭhakam \|  
snānodakaṁ tathā chāyāṁ laṅghayen na kadācana \|\|88\|\|  
guror agre pṛthak-pūjām advaitaṁ ca parityajet \|  
dīkṣāṁ vyākhyāṁ prabhutvaṁ ca guror agre vivarjayet \|\|89\|\|  
  
However I could not find devi-agama. Can anyone help me out to find  
the devi-agama as well as the proper place at which this sloka appear.  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
