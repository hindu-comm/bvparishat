<https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/never-too-old-school-meet-96-yr-old-student-alappuzhas-literacy-mission-80373>  

  

Reminded of a subhashita:

  

``` गतेऽपि वयसि ग्राह्या विद्या सर्वात्मना बुधैः । यद्यपि स्यान्न फलदा सुलभा साऽन्यजन्मनि  ||

gate'pi vayasi grAhyA vidyA sarvAtmanA budhaiH yadyapi syAnna phaladA sulabhA sA anyajanmani

Meaning:

Though one has attained old age, there should be the endeavor to acquire knowledge by all means.  Even though it might not bear fruit (in this birth), yet the pursuit of it will become easy in a different birth.

Best regards, ```
