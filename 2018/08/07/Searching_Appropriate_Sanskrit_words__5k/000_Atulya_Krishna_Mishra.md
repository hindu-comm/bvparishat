विद्वत्जन् !

प्रणाम,

  

I'm learning and trying to speak the 'same language ' of this forum in certain context.

  

I'm somehow lost ,I tried Google but I know Google shows what it contains no matter whether it's right or wrong.

  

I'm searching for " Appropriate exact words" that are literal translation of following English words in Sanskrit.

  

TEACHER

COACH

MENTOR

GUIDE

CATALAYST

CHANGE AGENT

SERVANT LEADERSHIP

COACHING

  
Thanks in advance.
