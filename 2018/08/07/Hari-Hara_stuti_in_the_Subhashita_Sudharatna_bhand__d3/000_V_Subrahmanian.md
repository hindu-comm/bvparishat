There is a section in the above work for the Hari-Hara stuti. The verses there are more or less available in the following URL:  

  

<https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_vishhnu/hariharastutiH.html?lang=sa>  

  

I would like to know whether the entire set of verses, in different meters, is a composition/collection from one work/author or these are standalone verses composed by different persons. Any information on this is welcome. Identifying the verses to their source/s will bring out many more facts.

  

The subhashita book referred above is downloadable here:
