In the contemporary parlance, the neologism 'fringe elements' has a connotation. Those who physically attack the persons who hold, practice ideas other than their own , particularly from the Hindu community, are being called 'fringe elements'.

  

You using that word in the context of Sanskrit scholars protesting misrepresentation of Sanskrit, its literature, India and its culture through verbal debate was completely out of context and your recent post explaining the meaning of 'fringe elements as "  people who hold extreme views and are not ready for any discussion. " betrays your lack of proper understanding of these words and their usages.

  

Leaving aside your wrong choice of words, your understanding of the scholars scholars protesting misrepresentation of Sanskrit, its literature, India and its culture through verbal debateas people who hold extreme views and are not ready for any discussion shows your lack of proper information about the event and your gullible buying of false propaganda.
