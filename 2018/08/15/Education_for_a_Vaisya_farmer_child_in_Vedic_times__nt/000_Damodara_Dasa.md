Respected Vidvaj-janas,  
  
It is found almost everywhere in Vedic Literatures that a child of  
Vaisya (farmer etc) gets upanayana not before 12 years of age. I am  
very curious to know what would be their everyday engagement till 12  
years of age (obviously at home)? Would they learn any kind of  
reading, writing, arithmetic, etc.? They must be playing a lot the  
whole day, isn't it?  
  
I suppose they would be playing learning their fathers' work till  
upanayanam. But then when they go to gurukula after 12 or 14 years of  
age, would they not forget farming etc due to their being out of touch  
of it for 5-6 years?  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
