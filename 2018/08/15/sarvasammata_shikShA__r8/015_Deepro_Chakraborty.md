Dear Ramakrishnan Ji,

  

Both versions of the Sarvasammataśikṣā along with the commentaries were edited and translated into German by Ralf Stautzebach in 1994. This edition also includes the Pāriśikṣā and its commentary Yājuṣabhūṣaṇa.

  

A friend of mine made a scan of it for me in Halle.

  

You can find it h[ere](https://ia601507.us.archive.org/7/items/ParisikshaUndSarvasammatasiksha/Parisiksha%20und%20Sarvasammatasiksha.pdf).

  

Regards,

Deepro
