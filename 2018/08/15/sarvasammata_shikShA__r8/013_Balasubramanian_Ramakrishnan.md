Hello Subbuji,

  

I have not seen any reasonable analysis of dates for any shikShA texts. They all seem to be some guesswork on top of other guesswork. One guess is that the vyAsa sikShA is from the 13th century, which would push these texts by at least a century or so. But the previous date is pure guesswork IMHO.
