Namaste,

  

Sarvasammatasiksha (SSS) is not found in the list of published works of Siddheshwar Varma, avaialble in Siddhabharati part 1. Moreover, his first ever publication is dated 1919. Attaching the list herewith.  

  

If you have access to Suranjana Chaudhury's book, could you please share the screen shot of the relevant page?

  

Siddheshwar Varma mentions about the longer version of SSS, in '[Critical Studies in the Phonetic observations of Indian grammarians](https://archive.org/details/CriticalStudiesInThePhoneticObservationsOfIndianGrammariansSiddheshwarVarma)', page 14. There too, he does not say anything about having edited SSM himself.  

  

regards  
shankara
