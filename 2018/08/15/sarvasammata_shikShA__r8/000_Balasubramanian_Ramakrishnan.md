namo vidvadbhyaH,

  

In her critical edition of the kAlanirNaya shikShA, Suranjana Chaudhury mentions that apart from Otto Finke, whose book on the sarvasammata shikShA is available in [archive.org](http://archive.org), Prof Siddheswar Varma also edited a longer version. I quote:

  

“But in 1905 Siddheswar Varma had edited another MS. no. 998, Madras. Here he found one seventy verses along with four chapters ... “.

  

The Finke edition consists of only 49 verses. I am interested in getting a copy of the edition prepared by Prof. Varma. An internet search did not provide me with anything. If you have any information regarding this edition, please let me know.

  

Thank you.

  

Ramakrishnan
