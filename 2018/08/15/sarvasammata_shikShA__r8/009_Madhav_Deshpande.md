Yes, I have a physical copy of the book "Sanskrit Texts on Phonetics, A Collection of Śikṣā Texts" reproduced by Lokesh Chandra, New Delhi, 1981, and it contains printed reproductions of hand-written transcripts of manuscripts including the Sarvasammata Śikṣā with the commentary of Mancibhaṭṭa (pp. 536-579). The book gives no information on where the original manuscripts are and who made these hand-written transcripts.
