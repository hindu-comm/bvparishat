Ramakrishnanji,

  

Got the attachment. I think the author may be relying on some seconday source here. I have already mentioned the reasons in my first mail.

  

Varma says on [page 41](https://archive.org/stream/CriticalStudiesInThePhoneticObservationsOfIndianGrammariansSiddheshwarVarma/Critical%20Studies%20in%20the%20Phonetic%20Observations%20of%20Indian%20Grammarians_Siddheshwar%20Varma#page/n30/mode/1up) (not page 14 as I wrote earlier) his 'Cricital studies in the phonetical observations of Indian grammarians', that he 'examined' the manuscript no. 998 (Madras, 1905). He must have been referring to the 'Descriptive catalogue of Sanskrit manuscripts, GOML, Madras published in 1905.

Ms Chaudhury might have concluded that the longer version of SSS edited by Siddheshwar Varma was published in 1905.  

  

regards  
shankara
