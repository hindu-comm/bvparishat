I don't know if there's a typo in the book. I found a document <http://www.peterffreund.com/Dissertation/Freund_Dissertation_Vedic_Library.pdf>

  

In that he says that the sarvasammata and other siksa-s can be found in Chandra and Vira, "Sanskrit Texts on Phonetics," pp. 536–579. As per google books, link <https://books.google.com/books/about/Sanskrit_texts_on_phonetics.html?id=y3cJAQAAIAAJ>, the bookhas a collection ofshikShA texts.The image is not good and I can't read the contents.

  

Does anyone have this book?

  

Thank you!
