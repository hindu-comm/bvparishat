Dear Sir,

Kindly we in touch with Prof. V.N. Jha Sir, he is a great teacher of Nyaya and represents deep knowledge in very easy way. As per my limited knowledge of Nyaya-Siddhanta-Muktawali you can read first Navya-Nyaya-Bhasha Pradeep of MM Maheshchandra Nyayaratna,for getting absolute meaning of the defined terminologies .
