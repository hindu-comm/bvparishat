As I know in mumbai there is a university campus of RASTRIYA SANSKRIT SAMSTHAN. Its definitely have atleast 5 faculty for nyaya.In that you can get an acharya for nyaya. Go there and consult them . It's address will be available to you on website : [www.sanskrit.nic.in](http://www.sanskrit.nic.in) . If you are interested in getting lessons online I heard that in youtube the nyaya lessons of vidwan mani dravida sastry ji are available . By searching in youtube you can get them.
