Hello Mahoday Agniji.

I have been to Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan and Rashtriya Sansthan in Vidya Vihar both. There are a few teachers there. But not as to teach Nyaya.

I think Nyaya is a very Shushka subject. I've spoken to Sir Girish Janiji. He's a highly reputable schollar and he suggested Shri RajBahadurji.

I study in GT Sanskrit MahaVidyalay affiliated with Sampurnanand, and he was an ex-teacher out there. On speaking with him, he said he won't be able to teach now, as to content and satisfaction. It's been a long time he left teaching or has taught Nyaya to anyone.

The person from whom I'm learning from currently, is Guruvara Shri Damodarji, they both are friends. He said to my father that people who study Nyaya, after Vyakarana would need more attention and he's a bit hesitant/reluctant(?), I don't know.

But I really find it so difficult to understand it Pankti by Pankti. We say in Hindi"Pankti lag nahi rahi", even on understanding, when there is lack of satisfaction, we say this.

Damodar Guruji also helps me alot, but the satisfaction that's needed isn't coming to me. My head spins when I read Dinkariya abd Ramarudriya. Damodarji Guruji has taught me LSK, Tarka Sangrah and is currently teaching me VSK-Bhvadi Prakaran. Damodar Guruji is a Vaiyakarana by profession,so it might be a tedious task for him to teach Nyaya, still he's very helpful and trying very hard to make me understand. But he's in favour of finding another Naiyayik Guru.

I'm very keen to learn Nyaya.Step by Step. I've met ManidrAvida Shastrigal personally at Shankaralaya, Chembur and introduced myself to him there. It was a pleasure meet him. And I do follow him and his lectures. Still, I think internet has its own limitations. And I'm in real need of a Guru.

Thankyou for being so generous Sir.  
Regards.  
Rishi.
