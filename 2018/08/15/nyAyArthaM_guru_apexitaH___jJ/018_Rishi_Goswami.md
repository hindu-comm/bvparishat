Namo Haraye..

Namo Vidvadbhyah.

I went to the link provided by Shri Nagaraj Mahodaya.

I'm a little confused here. What is Bhasha Pariccheda exactly? Is it another independent work by Vishvanathji?

Even though Shankarji clarified, but still I'm not sure. Is it another commentary on his Karikavalis? As Muktavali is the explanation of his Karikavalis?

So what is Bhasha Parichheda? Is it the same as Muktavaki Tika?

Thank you.
