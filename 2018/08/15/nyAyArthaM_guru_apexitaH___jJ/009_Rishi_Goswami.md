।।श्रीहरिः।।  
  
Greetings to all very helpful schollars. \_/\\\_  
  
  
I had the honour of meeting Shri V N Jha last week. He had given me ashvAsana that he would try to solve my doubts in nyaya as much as possible and he'd allow me to come to his home in Pune, whenever he gets time. He's a very nice person dedicated to the Prachara of Shastras to everyone. Hence, he travels all over the country sharing this knowledge for everyone.

My purpose for writing is different here. I am referring to Dinkariya-Ramarudriya conmentries currently. In Hindi, I have the Chokhamhha prescribed Balapriya Tika. And I downloaded a Gujarati Tika by a Jain Schollar in pdf.  
  
--  
  
I have difficulty in understanding Sanskrit sometimes, the Tika, and the Hindi has lack of vistAra and becomes very confusing at times, and Gujarati is very good but still many doubts remain unanswered.  
  
Hence I'm searching for a good Tika, maybe in Sarala Sanskrit or with good expansion in Hindi.  
  
I had a book of Shri Varadacharya of Mysore. He wrote Tarka Sangraha Tika in Sanskrit. It wasnone of the best Tikas I'd ever read. It was easy and very well organised covering all points even from Nyaya Siddhanta Muktavali. He has written a book on Nyaya Saurabham also, but I don't know if it is available on Nyaya Muktavali.  
  
Shankaraji, please provide PDF if available online. His books aren't available online and the book is also not mine. I tried contacting [samskrti.org](http://samskrti.org) through email but there has been no response. The book wasn't mine so I had to return it to someone after completing Tarka Sangraha.  
  
I'll contact the Pune Pathshala soon. But till then can you suggest some good Tikas in Hindi/Gujarati/Sanskrit Fot reference? Has Shri Varadacharya written any on Nyaya Muktavali?  
  
Please give me some advice also. I have heard of a book called Nyaya Bhasha Pradeepa. Should I learn that book first before Muktavali for better understanding of the technical terminologies? Or os there any other book in Navya Nyaya I should read before Muktavali? What is your Margadarshana Aacharyavaras?  
  
Regards  
Student  
Rishi.
