Thank you Shankarji very much for providing Tarka Sangraha of Shri Varadacharya online.

Yes, I am indeed in touch with Shri V N Jha Mahodaya, and he has assured me to come to his home in Pune sometimes for clearing doubts. Or asking on Whatsapp.

Bhattji, I'm unaware of any South language. There maybe Utkrishta tikas in Telugu/Kannada but I only know Hindi/Gujarati and limited knowledge of Sanskrit. I can read Tikas myself but sometimes I get stuck on certain points hence I need Hindi reference. Hindi tika is swatantra and not based on Thr Shastrarths taken up in Dinkariya Tika.

I'm not sure what Bhasha Parichheda is about. I have book with Vishvajathji's Karikavali and his own personal Muktavali Commentary on it,and Dinkariya Ramarudriya tikas on the same.

  
I will try and learning Navya-Nyaya-Bhasha-Pradeepa as suggested. I hope it helps me further grasp Nyaya-Muktavali with less difficulties.

I'm greatful to all helpful schollars here, and apologize for little late response.

Regards.  
Rishi.
