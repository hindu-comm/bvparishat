Namaste,

Shri. Rishi Goswami, I suggest you to visit Abasaheb Patwardhan Vedashastra pathshala, Pune.

You will get deep knowledge of Nyaya there. There are lot of authorized scholars (who have passed the traditional exams of Muktavali, Dinakari, Pakshata etc. texts from Srngeri or Kanchi Kamakoti math). You can stay there with prior permission of trusties. You can contact me on the following whatsapp no. [9403984653](tel:(940)%20398-4653)

  

Thanks.
