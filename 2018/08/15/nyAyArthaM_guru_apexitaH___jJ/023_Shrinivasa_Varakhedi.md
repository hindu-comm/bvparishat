You may meet Sri Pandit Rajeshvara Shatry in Pune. He is teaching Nyaya in traditional way. He is a disciple of Pandit Dr. Devadatta Patil. His contact is : 8830705610  
  
You may try with Nyaya ramayana of Prof.. Veeranaraya Pandurangi an abridged version of Dinakareyam published by PPSM Bengaluru.  
  
Another very good work is Balapriya commentary of MM late Prof. NSR Tatacharya on TSDeepika.  
  
Better to go to Pune weekly twice and learn from a direct Guru.  
  
Regards,  
SV
