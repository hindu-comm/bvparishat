Here are some suggestions:

  

1. You can come to Bangalore and seek lessons from experts like Vidwan Haridasa Bhatta who taught Nyaya for several decades in the Purna Prajna Vidya PeeTha, Bangalore and retired. He stays close to the campus. You can see if he can teach you if you stay in Bangalore.

  

2\. Vidvan Srihari Dhayagude is also an expert in Nyaya living in Chennai. You can contact him through Sri Mani Dravid Sastrigal and see if you can stay in Chennai and study.
