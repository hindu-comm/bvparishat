Our BVP members deserve special attention on occasions of national recognition, hence need to be in an appropriate thread.

  

Hearty congratulations to Prof. Vasantkumar Bhat Ji, on achieving this great honor! His services to kavya literature are recalled.

  

Pranams and hearty congratulations to Mahamahopadhyaya Prof. K. V. Ramakrishnamacharyulu sir, Ex VC, JRRSU, for a much awaited honor. He's a pioneer in Vyakarana and Sanskrit computational linguistics.

  

It's very heartening to see, every year, a couple of scholars awarded are our active forum members.

  

Best regards
