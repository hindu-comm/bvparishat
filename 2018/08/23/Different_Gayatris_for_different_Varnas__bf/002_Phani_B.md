"Brahmins are allowed to learn and teach the Veda, while the others like kshatriyas and Vaishyas are allowed only to learn the veda."  

  

This is not True. While I don't recall the exact sutra what is prescribed is one should learn from a Brahmana and if not possible from a Kshatriya and if not possible from a Vaishya.

This is from Apastambha gruhya sutras. So as a corollary it follows that Kshatriyas and Vaishya's were also teaching.
