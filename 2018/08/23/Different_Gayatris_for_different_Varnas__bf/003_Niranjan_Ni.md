Dear Sir,

  

I do not consider Arya samajis or Gayatri parivar to be traditional in any sense of the term.

The swara for the Savita Gayatri by Sri Ram Sharma is so appalling that it cannot be mentioned in any respectable forum. This is the man who claims to have done 25 purascharanas of Gayatri and is touted as Yuga Rishi. These days many followers give the Rishi moniker too freely to their Gurus out of blind devotion. I guess this is part of the muddling in kaliyuga. Still respect the man for his attempt at popularising Gayatri, but this might be another case of the blind leading the blind.

The Veda is less than useless when rules of siksha, svara and chandas are willynilly bent and broken in the name of proliferation.

  

I have no quarrel with these people spreading the Veda, but it has to be passed on in pristine form!

  

Tradition would imply sampradaya that is unbroken ... nouveau traditions like the "naya swami" moniker used by many like kriyananda and others like the veerashaivas would not count. Usually there is one powerful Guru who is certainly no Rshi and after that it dumbs down to a sub sect of the vast marquee that is considered Hinduism.

  

I am still unsure why kshatriyas japa in trishtubh mantra and Vaishya in Jagati is not prevalent. Rajputs and other sects still identify as kshatriyas. Many like the chettiyars and Vishwakarmas still identify as Vaishyas.

  

So why do these dvijas ignore their nityakarma?

  

ANd how can their mantras be in Gayatri when it is specifically mentioned that they use Trishtubh and Jagati?

A regional book in Telugu cannot supplant the vaak of the Grihyasutras.

  

There are many Tamil books that give sandhyavandana procedures that are totally divorced from the respective grihyasutra.

  

This is a recipe for disaster.

  

If dharma is truly that which bears, isn't the nityakarma of the respective tradition the dharma of that varna/shakha? If this is ignored is it a surprise that society as a whole is heading down?

  

What then is the purpose of all these mattas ? Propagating advaita/ dvaita/ achintybhedhabheda etc?

All the heads of these mattas do is revamp old temples and give pravachans on Bhagavan etc.

  

All this is nice, but without nityakarma there is no adhara for dharma.

Svarupalakshana is a result of chittashuddhi which is only possible by following nityakarma at a minimum. Not otherwise.



I am confused. Does anyone know if any of the mattas are doing anything in this regard? Brahmins are only 1% of the population. That leaves a lot of people who are left at a loose end. In another 10 generations even Brahmins will not know what their nityakarmas are. I see the lack of interest within the current generation of my own family. Why go far?

This reminds me of Krishna's warning to follow svadharma instead of following paradharma.
