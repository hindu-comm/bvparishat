Respected Niranjanji,  
Pranams.  
  
I have just few points to make here from sastras:  
  
1. In kali-yuga different nitya-karma has been prescribed in sastras,  
specifically in Bhagavatam -- it is chanting the Holy Names of Lord  
Hari.  
Check the attached PDF.  
Also check Kali Santarana Upanisad at Link:  
<https://ia800601.us.archive.org/22/items/kali_santarana_upanisad/kali_santarana_upanisad.pdf>  
  
2. In Kali-yuga all the powers of individuals have reduced and are  
constantly reducing and thus it is not surprising that for majority it  
is not possible to have sufficient purity, piety, memory, speech,  
determination, etc. to be able to continue the established nitya-karma  
of varnasrama-system which needs broader varnasrama society in place  
without which it is not possible for majority to stick to it.  
References:  
prāyeṇālpāyuṣaḥ sabhya kalāv asmin yuge janāḥ \|  
mandāḥ sumanda-matayo manda-bhāgyā hy upadrutāḥ \|\|SB 1.1.10\|\|  
  
tataś cānu-dinaṁ dharmaḥ satyaṁ śaucaṁ kṣamā dayā \|  
kālena balinā rājan naṅkṣyaty āyur balaṁ smṛtiḥ \|\|SB 12.2.1\|\|  
  
For more quotes read Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 12, chapter 2  
  
3. Moreover, the purity of lineage is also not sure in Kali-yuga and  
thus it is not sure that a brahmana will born from a brahmana  
(although it happened so in previous yugas). The reason is that  
samskaras are not in place and thus ṣouls fitting to parent's or  
lineage's varna is not sure to be placed in womb and thus everything  
is mixed, which can rightly be called varna-sankara. Reference for the  
principle of samkaras being required for purity of lineage are many  
but I can refer to Bhagavatam:  
  
saṁskārā yatrāvicchinnāḥ sa dvijo ‘jo jagāda yam \|  
ijyādhyayana-dānāni vihitāni dvijanmanām \|  
janma-karmāvadātānāṁ kriyāś cāśrama-coditāḥ \|\| SB 7.11.13\|\|  
  
Thus in kaliyuga one has to be judged only by symptoms (lakṣaṇas) as  
it clear later in the same reference:  
  
yasya yal lakṣaṇaṁ proktaṁ puṁso varṇābhivyañjakam \|  
yad anyatrāpi dṛśyeta tat tenaiva vinirdiśet \|\|SB 7.11.35 \|\|

vayaṁ viṣṇo brāhmaṇāḥ smo ‘brāhmaṇā vā ye yajāmahe” iti śrutiḥ

Practically we are seeing this everyday in our gurukula -- boys from  
same parents have different qualities to be engaged in different works  
and qualities do not match even with those of parents. We are trying  
to engage seeing their symptoms and so far so good, we are getting  
some success.  
  
  
Hope this helps clarifying some points.  
  
Thankyou,
