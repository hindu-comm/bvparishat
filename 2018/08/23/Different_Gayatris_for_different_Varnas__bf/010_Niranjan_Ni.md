Dear Sri Damodara Dasa:

  

I have no issues with namasankirtana.

  

Kindly avoid deviating from the root of this thread and keep your posts germane to topic.

  

I will be interested in your inputs specific to the questions I have raised in my first question.

  

My question is regarding the classic Vedic paradigm related to Grihyasutras as applied to Kshatriyas and Vaishyas.

I am not seeking information on the Gaudiya world view of which I am elaborately and intimately familiar.

Thanks again for all the review.

  

As for the rest, kindly start a new thread and those interested in pursuing that line of thought will freely join.

  

Warm Regards,

  

Niranjan
