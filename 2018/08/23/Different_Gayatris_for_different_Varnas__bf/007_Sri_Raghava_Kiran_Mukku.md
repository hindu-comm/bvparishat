नमो विद्वद्भ्यः।

  

@Vidvan Damodara Dasa:

  

I understand that the popular verses like "कलौ कल्मषचित्तानां पापद्रव्योपजीविनाम्। विधिक्रियाविहीनानां गतिर्गोविन्दकीर्तनम्॥" do not recommend नामसङ्कीर्तनम् as a substitute for नित्यकर्म (विधिक्रिया). Instead, they mean that the \[only\] salvation for isनामसङ्कीर्तनम्
for those who do not perform the prescribed नित्यकर्म (विधिक्रिया), be it due to lack oftradition or lack of knowledge or even lack of personal interest. The phrases like पापद्रव्योपजीवनम् explain why does this deviation from the prescribed duty is prevalent. It is expected that we try to reform ourselves by performing various prescribed duties, instead of lamenting that the deterioration is due to the effect of Kali.

  

My understanding may not be the final authority, I would gladly accept the guidance from the scholars on the list. शिष्टाः प्रमाणम्।
