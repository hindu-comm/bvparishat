The footnote in the page referred by you has the following:

  

The Gâyatrî which the teacher shall recite to a Brâhma*n*a is the same verse of which it is said below, chap. q, II, that it belongs to Vi*s*vâmitra (Rig-veda III, 62, to); the Trish*t*ubh which is taught to the Kshatriya is a verse ascribed to Hira*n*yastûpa, Rig-veda I, 35, 2; the*G*agatî which is to be repeated to a Vai*s*ya is Rig-veda IV, 40, 5, belonging to Vâmadeva, or Rig-veda I, 35, 9, belonging to Hira*n*yastûpa. See the note on chap. 7, 10.  

  

There was an older thread on Vais'yas and Sandhyavandana.

In that this post,

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/c7YF6u8pWzI/1JifnLZFCAAJ>  

  

shows that a Vaisya was taken as a student.

  

The book cited in this post

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/c7YF6u8pWzI/SjJoL0dGCAAJ>  

  

shows that the mantra used by Vais'yas the same mantra of Savitri which is in Gayatreecchandas.

  

Different Saavitree mantras in different meters from different Vedas to different 'varNas' is not prevalent today.

  

--------------------------------------------------

  

Vis'vabrahmaNas have been earning and teaching Vedas.

  

Veeras'aivas have been learning and teaching Vedas.

  

There are many such realities that are not reflected by these texts.

  

---------------------------

  

If you talk of "these days", Arya Samaj has teaching and learning of Vedas by people irrespective of caste and gender.

  

There are many new organisations like Gayatree Parivar taking Gaayatree mantra and Vedas across caste and gender.

  

It is a different picture today.
