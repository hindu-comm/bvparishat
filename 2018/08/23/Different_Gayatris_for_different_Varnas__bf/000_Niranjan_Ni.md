Dear List members:

  

As per The Shankhayana Grihya Sutras as given here-->

  

<http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbe29/sbe29035.htm>  

  

Brahmins are taught mantra in Gayatri meter,

  

Kshatriyas in trishtubh

  

and Vaishyas in Jagati.

  

Is there a Grihyasutra/ a brahmakarma like compendium for each varna on how these mantras are supposedly applied?

  

For ex: It is well known that Brahmins are allowed to learn and teach the Veda, while the others like kshatriyas and Vaishyas are allowed only to learn the veda.However these days Brahmins are only allowed to learn and teach the Vedas.

  

When did this departure from ancient tradition start?

  

Can the vidvans throw some light on this?

  

Thanks,

  

Niranjan
