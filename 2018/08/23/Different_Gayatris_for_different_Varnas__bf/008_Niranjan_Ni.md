Dear Sri Nagaraj Sir:

  

I apologise for the "rant" but it was not directed against any person or organisation.

My observations on lack of svara are objective enough to be validated independently without taking my word for it.

  

I am sincerely looking for references and sources that clarify the root issue.

  

Dear Sri Damodaradasa  
  
I have read the Srimad Bhagavatam and I have a different opinion on what the text says that is different from the Gaudiya version.

  

I refrain from developing the theme of nityakarmas as seen by Gaudiyas so as to avoid breaking forum rules regarding keeping a discussion single threaded and On Topic.

  

I agree with some of your comments on children with different values/ talents being born to parents and varna sankara.

  

I'll just leave you with a single statement reason for my not pursuing the Gaudiya version here. Gaudiyas follow the pancharatara system which is like an exception to the main Vedic path and hence it constitutes a different paradigm to the tradiitonal Vedic school of thought.

  

Yes we live in kaliyuga which is filled with untruth and hypocrisy, but NOT everyone is born so and a small minority do manage to uphold the highest virtues upheld in earlier Yugas. Even in dvapara you had Duryodhana and Dusshasana --I am sure you will agree many in kaliyuga are better vessels than these two.

So a path is usually a horses for courses choice in sanatana dharma rather than a blanket prescription for all. This is where sanatana dharma differs significantly from the abrahamic traditions. In sanatana dharma the devotion is to DHARMA and not to God directly. The understanding is that dharma which constitutes the body and soul of the supreme being if protected, God is automatically pleased and drawn to us.

  

Thanks again for your contibution.

  

Niranjan
