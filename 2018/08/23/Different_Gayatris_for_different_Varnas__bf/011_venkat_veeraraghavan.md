Different mantras in different chandas makes a lot of intuitive sense.

  

The chandas-devatas match up as follows:

  

Gayatri- Agni

Trishtubh- Indra

Jagati-Vishvedeva

  

as per KYV.

  

Agni is considered the mouth of the Devas and this ties in with the Purusha sukta that references "ब्रा॒ह्म॒णो॓‌ऽस्य॒ मुख॑मासीत्" also Agni is the first priest ("ॐ अग्निमीळे पुरोहितं")

Indra is King and referenced as rajanya and not explicitly as kshatriya "बा॒हू रा॑ज॒न्यः॑ कृ॒तः"  
Vishvedevas may be considered as a unified form of the cosmic trinity as exemplified in the cow which was considered an embodiment of all the divinities and Vaishyas were essentially protectors of cows.

Also the Vishvedevas at some level represent the complete expansion of shakti representing multiplicity / abundance / wealth and so on. "ॐ गौ॒रीर्मिमाय सलि॒लानि॒ तक्ष॒त्यॆक॑पदि द्वि॒पदी॒ स चतु॑ष्पदी । अ॒ष्टाप॑दी॒ नव॑पदी बभू॒वुषी॑ स॒हस्रा॑क्षरा पर॒मॆ व्यॊ॑मन् ॥"

  

Just my 2 cents.
