As to Prof. K. S. Kannan's suggestion ( The reference here may possibly be to the birth of fire) , here the word जातः means संवृत्तः and not born.

“**कुङ्कुमगन्ध इदानीं जात**”**इति**- कुङ्कुमगन्धः संवृत्तः - This fellow is (already) having the fragrance of *kunkuma*(बहुव्रीहिः).
This is spoken of a person who has made all set for bathing
