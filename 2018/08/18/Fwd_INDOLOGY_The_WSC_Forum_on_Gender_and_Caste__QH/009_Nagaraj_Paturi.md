AadaraNIya Nityanand-ji,

  

When it was just Mrs Vajpeyi's words, I too thought it was the same old manipulative representation. Even now I would never be carried away by exaggerations like 'hooliganism' etc.

  

But when I see Profs like Adheesh Sathaye and Jayandra Soni are reflecting the impression that something was not right, I thought there must be some basis though it might not be as exaggerated as it is made out to be. Even after getting this feeling, I said, "if there are any".

  

No point, we non-participants guessing.

  

Let us wait for the participants to present their observations and experience.
