Exactly what happened that is being called hooliganistic? What was said and who said it? Is there a video recording of the event? Or a transcript?

  

Prof. Varakhedi’s account is specific and reliable. Ananya Vajpeyi’s account is hardly specific at all, she is just crying victim (as usual). Prof. Sathaye’s long-winded response is again not specific. It appears he is taking the blame to shield some others. This is what I felt after reading all three. I may be wrong in my interpretation.

  

PS: I do not know much about Adheesh Sathaye’s credentials in Sanskrit, can somebody comment. What I do know is that he thinks knows Hindi, he tries to show off that he knows Hindi, but the fact is his Hindi is horrible (to say the least). An example where he shamed himself publicly on INDOLOGY is [here](http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/2016-September/044107.html): “अगर आप हिंदि पढते-पढते दूसरी भाषा के एक-दो वर्ड्स देखतें, तो कोई बाद नहि ना ?”) Spelling, grammar, choice of words, construction, everything was horrible. His Sanskrit may be better.
