If any of the audience of the forum responded overenthusiastically agressively giving an impression of intimidation or obstruction, they did a disserviceto the cause thatwas taken up by

  

1\. Prof. Srinivasa Varakhedi

  

2\. the participants who offered a scholarly counter to misinformation etc. without giving scope for obfuscation towards issues of civility, decency etc.,

  

We should condemn such audience if there are any.

  

If there were no such audience, misinformation should be countered efficiently.

  

Such audience, if there are any, must be now realising how their unnecessary anxiety is counterproductive as it makes their case weak and damages the cause that they thought they were serving.
