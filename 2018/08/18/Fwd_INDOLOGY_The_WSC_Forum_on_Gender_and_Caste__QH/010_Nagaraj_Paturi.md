I agree with Prof. Bijoy Misra when he says "an autobiographical opinion lecture is a mismatch for apublic panel that has the goal of creating collective public knowledge".

  

This was what Prof. Varakhedi too expressed.

  

Prof. Sathaye says such events happen in US universities.

  

They happen in Indian universities too, don't they? But not as part of a conference meant for sharing research papers etc.
