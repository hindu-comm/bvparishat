Prof. Paturi ji has already commented on this part. Because, this shows the rigidity of the text showing it in poor light and the texts are no mirror for the reality of Hindu sangha. That is why I asked who is considered to a Brahmana or for that matter, who is considered as Shudra? The status of these two categories is not static, rather dynamic as in the saying quoted by Prof. Vasanta Kumar Bhat ji. One may quote many examples from चातुर्वर्ण्यभारतसमीक्षा in support of this interchangeability of this so-called 'caste.
