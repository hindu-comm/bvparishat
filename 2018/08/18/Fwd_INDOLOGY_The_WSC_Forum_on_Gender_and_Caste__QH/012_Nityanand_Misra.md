I fully agree, there is no explanation at all, which smells of ulterior motives. Reading from his response

  

“a number of disrespectful and inappropriate exchanges and statements were made. Invited guests and presenters were interrupted, shouted at, demeaned, and intimidated.”  

  

Again, no details. Who said what? In what context? When were the presenters interrupted? Who shouted at whom? How were they demeaned? Who intimidated? *Intimidated*?

  

Is not intimidation a crime in Canada? I do not know what specific laws are applicable to British Columbia, but from this [page](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-423.html) it seems intimidation is a crime punishable up to five years. Do the organizers who want us to believe that multiple people conducted criminal offences at the conference? If they did, did the organizers report the criminal offences to the police? If they did not report, are the organizers not guilty of not reporting a crime, which again [appears to be an offense](https://www.torontodefencelawyers.com/blog/general-category/crime-report-crime-canada/) under section 22 of the Criminal Code of Canada? Do the organizers imply that they were abetting crimes in broad daylight?
