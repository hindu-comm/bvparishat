Prof. Paturi Ji,

  

With due respect, how can we assume that there was any hooliganism at all? I, for one, cannot assume anything unless I have myself seen the video myself or heard the audio or read the transcript. For some people, even asking valid but tough questions can be hooliganistic behaviour. Another question I would like to ask is how reliable is Ananya Vajpeyi’s account, if it is reliable at all? She is not new to writing misleading articles. Do we not remember she wrote [this](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/lead-article-by-ananya-vajpeyi-why-sheldon-pollock-matters/article8361572.ece) not too long ago, also in The Hindu:

  

*Almost none of the petition’s 132 principal sponsors and backers, or the thousands of signatories, are experts of Sanskrit, other classical languages, literature, history or the humanities, or indeed scholars at all.*  

*  
*

Painting 132 signatories to the Pollock petition with such a dismissive stroke without even bothering to check their credentials says a lot about her bias. She is shouting racism and casteism on an open platforms without stating what exactly was said and in what context. Is this not a big problem? Do we not see that her article **does not have a single quotation**? She claims Sanskrit pundits lectured her and her colleagues on:

  

Quote

*grammatical rules by which “Harijan” can mean “child of god” in Gujarati (as envisaged by Gandhi) or “embodiment of god”*

Unquote

  

I would like to know which Sanskrit grammatical rules were cited for this? I am not aware of any grammatical rules which can be used to interpret *jana* as “a child” in Gujarati and“embodiment” \[??\] in Sanskrit. It all sound very suspicious: I suspect she is making up parts of this. I would urge scholars who were present to come forward and clear the air.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
