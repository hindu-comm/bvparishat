Dear friends,

Unfortunately the organized denigration of Sanskrit has been a sustained movement in the west by

a group of individuals. I have not fully figured out their mission or their resources. All I have concluded

is that they read a text from a social angle and not from a literary angle. Reconstructing India's past

through text analysis is good archaeology, but it has nothing to do with people who produced the text.

The goal of some of these "scholars" has been to convince others to abandon the literature by

showing examples where the literature would not map to the modern taste. This process

is organized and is political in nature, in my opinion. I take Varahaminira as a scientist and

little care about his private social life just like I would take Einstein as a scientist and not bother

about his private life. These touted "scholars" are more interested in the reconstruction of the man's

life than the product of the man's creativity.

  

I was reading some of the translations various individuals had done, but lately I find them shallow,

political and unfortunate. Our two friends who are busy bad-mouthing Sanskrit literature are

"brainwashed" by these shallow literature. To get to original text is a massive enterprise and it

is not a fickle opinion. individuals have a right to express their personal views and they do.

But to consider a personal view as "scholarship" is an imposition. I have felt it as a part of

the colonial legacy though I have not studied fully. It is a method to create "division" in the

society, which is a political tool to govern. External governance is only possibly if the existing

society can be destroyed. India has sustained herself in spite of these efforts of destruction.

  

I could not figure out the role of Prof Mandakranta Bose in the current effort of sowing political

process in the scholarly conference. We prepared a paper and worked six months intensely

to learn the tools from many resources. What the panel is advising is that the social background

of the contributors could also be factor in the citation. I am sorry for my sisters in their perceived

situation of being "demeaned", but I guarantee them that their creative contributions would be heralded

by their brothers if they create them. "scholarship" is not job creation, but advancing human

knowledge to help unravel the mystery of the universe. "scholarship" is not a personal "commentary".

  

I have a general complaint for the modern studies. Most of them appear as "engineering",

and are driven to find "solutions". I appeal to all to discover the "science" behind the phenomenon

and try to understand it. it s not how we organize the universe, but what is the universe?

We get stuck between the appearance of a man and woman, not to wonder what is the

difference between a man and a woman, and if there a difference. Let me appeal to my

sisters to think on this and prepare a paper for the next WSC. Massive worldwide research

might follow.

  

Best regards,

BM
