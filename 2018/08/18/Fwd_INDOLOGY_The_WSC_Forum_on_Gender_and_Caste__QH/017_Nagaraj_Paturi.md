Sri Subrahmanian-ji,

  

I do not think, I can not imagine that you have intentions of supporting the claims of people that Hindu society in general and pre-modern Hindu society in particular was inhuman towards 's'udras' and that is being proved by the words in certain ancient Sanskrit texts. If such a supporting is the purpose you wanted to serve by bringing these references into discussion here, I want to tell you and the people who base their claims on the texts that most of these texts are no mirror for the reality of Hindu society in general and pre-modern Hindu society in particular. It is arm-chaired textualist understanding of cultures and that legacy of early Indology that continues even today in most of Indology is what has lead to many misunderstandings of Hindu society and culture.

  

If your intention is not to support such claims, please add a few sentences to explain how your references do not prove or disprove such claims.
