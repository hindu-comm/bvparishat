First I congratulate Prof Sathaye for having handled the organizational leadership diligently.

I read his note about the Forum that is being discussed. He does not say the motivation

for scheduling such a Forum with the panelists involved. "Treatment of women in Sanskrit Litreature"

could be a scholarly discussion. "Characterization of Sita in Vakmiki's Uttarakanada" is a

research paper. "Treatment of me in life through social condition" is an autobiographical opinion lecture.

A public panel has the goal of creating collective public knowledge.

Prof Sathay may help explain his motivation. Leadership has its own baggage.

In such situation the outcome was predictable.
