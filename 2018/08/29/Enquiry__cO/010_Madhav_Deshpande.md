Dear Prof. Jha,

  

  As Vishal Jaiswal says, you can use 7zip to unzip the zip file.
When I clicked on the WeTransfer link, it gives you the option of downloading each file individually. Then you do not need to unzip a zip file. Try that option. If it does not work, let me know. We can try something else. Best wishes,
