Namaste,

That is great news. Currently it appears that one can search by name, author, subject and institution, and the books matching the search criteria appear. If the development eventually leads to the search for a particular string within any text body, with the results showing where and in which text it occurs (like advaitasharada, for example), that would be simply phenomenal. In any case, this is very good.

  

Thanks to everyone behind this effort.

  

Kind regards

Venkatraghavan
