Dear Mr. Shantharam,

  

Many thanks for the information about the interesting course. I have uploaded the information as [a post on my blog संस्कृत-प्रसृतिः](https://sanskritaprasruti.wordpress.com/2018/08/14/introduction-to-basic-spoken-sanskrit/)as linked here.

  

However, more details are needed.

  

Please clarify timings and on which website one can view the course. OR will the lectures be made in YpuTube videos ?

  

I think it will be good if the lectures can be made as YouTube videos. By that they can be viewed across the globe at times convenient to the viewers.

  

When the course will be conducted online, will there be facility for questions by viewers, as is available on many TV programs ? MaybeDr. Anuradha Choudry may be speaking to an audience, with whom she will be interacting.

  

So, more details are needed, please, about how the course will be conducted and how it can be viewed.
