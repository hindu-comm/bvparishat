# Fact check: India wasn't the first place Sanskrit was recorded – it was Syria

## As the Narendra Modi government celebrates Sanskrit, a look at the oldest known speakers of the language: the Mitanni people of Syria.

"After yoga, Narendra Modi has turned his soft power focus to Sanskrit.
The Indian government is enthusiastically[participating](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/16th-world-sanskrit-conference-in-bangkok-sanskrit-should-be-propagated-to-purify-minds-of-people-says-sushma/article7363971.ece)in the 16th World Sanskrit Conference in Bangkok. Not only is it sending 250 Sanskrit scholars and partly funding the event, the conference will see the participation of two senior cabinet ministers: External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, who inaugurated the conference on Sunday, and Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani, who will attend its closing ceremony on July 2. Inexplicably, Swaraj also announced the creation of the post of Joint Secretary for Sanskrit in the Ministry of External Affairs. How an ancient language, which no one speaks, writes or reads, will help promote India’s affairs abroad remains to be seen."

The evidences found in Syria do not prove that Sanskrit was spoken there. What are found from there are some written documents where some words similar in sound to words common with the Vedic version of Sanskrit are found spilling over here and there. The words are considered to belong to a theorised proto-Indo-Aryan language which is theorised to have branched out from a theorised proto-Indo-European language and are not considered to belong to Sanskrit.  

[Mitanni-Aryan - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitanni-Aryan)

[Mitanni - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitanni#People)

In fact , they do not belong to Sanskrit at all.

So

1.  The evidences point to the**relation**of the people there with
    some language suspected to be genetically related to Sanskrit,**not
    Sanskrit itself** 2.  The evidence**does not**establish that that language not Sanskrit
    but a language suspected to be genetically related to Sanskrit
    was**spoken**there 3.  What are found there are**some words**of that language not
    Sanskrit but a language suspected to be genetically related to
    Sanskrit , that too**scattered here and there**and**not a full
    sentence**of even that language not Sanskrit but a language
    suspected to be genetically related to Sanskrit.

Given these facts, to say that Sanskrit was spoken in Syria is wrong.

Then comes the question of the date of these evidences being older or later to the earliest date of existence of Sanskrit (of course in its Vedic version) in India.

The date of the Syrian evidences could be more or less established. (circa 1400 BC).[Mitanni - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitanni)

The earliest date of existence of Sanskrit (of course in its Vedic version) in India is not yet established with certainty.

The whole point of whether the events that lead to the Syrian evidences of the relation of a dynasty that ruled Syria and had relation with a language not Sanskrit but a language suspected to be genetically related to Sanskrit occurred earlier or later to the earliest date of existence of Sanskrit (of course in its Vedic version) in India or not, depends on the establishment of the earliest date of existence of Sanskrit (of course in its Vedic version) in India which is not yet finalised.

Given these facts, to say that Sanskrit was spoken in Syria earlier to be spoken in India is wrong.
