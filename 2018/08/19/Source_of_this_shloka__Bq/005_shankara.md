Namaste,

  

Another version of this subhashita is quoted by Hanuman Prasad Poddar in 'Radhamadhavachintan' -[http://hi.krishnakosh.org/कृष्ण/श्रीराधा\_माधव_चिन्तन_पृ.\_965](http://hi.krishnakosh.orgकृष्ण/श्रीराधा_माधव_चिन्तन_पृ._965)

  

कार्येषु मन्त्री करणेषु दासी धर्मेषु पत्नी क्षमया च धात्री।  
भोज्येषु माता शयनेषु रम्भा रंगे सखी लक्ष्मण सा प्रिया मे॥  
  
He doesn't mention its source, though we can conclude that it is from some kavya based on Ramayana.  

  

regards  
shankara
