Dear List Members:

  

I have come across the following shloka in various texts but have no clue as to the original source.

  

Can anyone help?

  

Karyeshu dasi; Karaneshu mantri;  
rupecha lakshmi; kshamaya dharitri;  
bhojyeshu mata; shayaneshu rambha;  
shat karmayukta kuladharmapatni  

  

I read somewhere that this is Sri Rama describing Sita to Lakshmana, but I have not seen this anywhere in Valmiki Ramayana.

  

Thanks,

  

Niranjan
