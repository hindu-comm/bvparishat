Sir,

  

Happy to note that you'd a positive intention in asking this question, initially. Yes, one should not tailor its tone and tenor to suit one's needs. What exactly I mean is to refute the patriarchal, misogynistic
shades (that could be possibly and wrongly interpreted by Ananyas, Kaushals and the like), by bringing a supporting bhaava reflected in the kind of slokas, referred by Prof. Korada ji (कार्येषु योगी...). Yours Vanaparvan reference to Draupadi and Satyabhama is another bhaava that justifies the position of women, in the words of women. It is a sheer coincident to remind all about Dr. Jayaraman's personal experience at the 'asmat samskritam,' at Vancouver, wherein Dr. Kaushal misinterpreted the dialog between Urvasi-Pururavas and attributing the words of Urvasi to Pururavas thus creating a misconception about Vedic literature. Hence, one need not alter/tailor the text, but need of the hour is to interpret ancient Sanskrit literature in proper light with proper training, sraddha and bhakti. Indeed, you helped me by answering your own question -

समानी व आकूतिः...
