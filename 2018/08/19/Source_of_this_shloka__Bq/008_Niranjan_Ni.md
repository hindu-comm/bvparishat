Thanks Sri JSR Prasadji. Sri Harunagaji and Sri Koradaji for your valuable inputs.

  

Sri JSR Prasadji: You said "tailor its tone and tenor suitable for contemporary times"

  

Sir: Will not doing that distort the text and be against satya?

  

There is a conversation between Draupadi and Satyabhama in the Vana parva that many feminists would find offensive. Does that invalidate the opinions of Draupadi who is regarded as one of the panchakanyas and therefore placed very high in the Hindu pantheon.

  

If we are to take the "yad yad acharati sreshtah" lines of the BG seriously, we may have to stop pandering to the current zeitgeist and its "majority" opinion which is being driven by certain cabals within the media and the academia, which are in no way representative of the majority opinion among even women.

  

I saw elsewhere Sri Koradaji described a patni as one who assists the pati at the 5 sacrifices.Given that definition, where is the offense in this ? And there is an equally presecriptive one for men as Sri Koradaji pointed out.



This is just my 2 cents. Please do not misunderstand.

  

Please do let me know if you think differently and if so why.

  

Thanks again.
