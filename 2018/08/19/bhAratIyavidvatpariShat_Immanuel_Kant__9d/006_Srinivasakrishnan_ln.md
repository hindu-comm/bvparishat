Why is it ‘apparently unrelated to the forums scope’? Is it out of scope for members of this forum to exchange information on topics of related interest?

  

How’s one going to understand the western way of looking at India unless one studied their suppositions? Or a drumbeat on the study of India’s mental science for 25 years (or is it 250 years, I forget ) good enough for such purposes?

  

Puzzled,
