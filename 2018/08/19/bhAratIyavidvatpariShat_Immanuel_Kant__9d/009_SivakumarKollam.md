SAdara praNAms to all Vidwans,

Like to bring to the attention that Swami Sivanandaji Maharaj, one among the three "Himavadvibhoothees" and who started the Divine Life Society had studied and written on many of the western philosophers.All the essays were brought out in a single volume "Essays on Philosophy" "This illuminating volume has been specially written for those who are soaked in Western philosophic thought and the scientific method of arriving at conclusions. These Essays in Philosophy are not based on mere belief or superstition, not on mere scriptural injunctions and declarations, but on good reason backed by the personal experiences of a living Sage of Self-realisation. As such, they are bound to appeal to, and transform, people of all shades of thought and opinion."
