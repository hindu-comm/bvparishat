I am surprisef at how you can manage to pick up issue with a post that supports your 'exchange'.

  

Now let me be straight.

  

Yes, this forum is not for exchanginginformation on topics of any kind of interest.

  

Only topics that fall witbin the scope of the forum as mentioned in the introduction of the forum ars allowed to be discussed. Western philosophy in general is not within that scope.

  

But topics of western philosophy that connect yo or help undersstanding Sanskrit, Sanskrif literature sastras Indic Knowlexge systems are within the scope.

Please note my word 'apparently'.

  

This topic, unless its connection with the forum's interest is shown, may appear to be outside the scope of the forum.

  

I wanted to justify the discussion by showing its relevance to the forum's interest.

  

Your lanvuage of drumbeats, coffees and moths can no longer be allowed.
