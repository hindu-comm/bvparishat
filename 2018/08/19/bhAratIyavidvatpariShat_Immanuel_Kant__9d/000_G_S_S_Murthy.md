I found this article interesting and quite relevant to me. In the hope that it may be liked by some others in this group, I am giving this link. The author uses slang words but otherwise gives a very good introduction to Immanuel Kant'sphilosophy. By the way, has any scholar attempted a Sanskrit translation of any of the works of ImmanuelKant?
