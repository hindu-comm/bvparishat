Thanks, Murthy-ji. This is useful.

  

If I may. For most topics of European philosophy and history, I find the recent 'Very Short Introduction' series by Oxford rather useful. They are usually written by an expert in the field as an introduction to the subject. These are very small books, usually no more than 100 pages long and the good thing is they come with a good professional bibliography, Vey handy in case you wish to pursue the subject further. These books are extensively used by undergrads in liberal arts colleges in this country.

Hope this helps,

PS: In my uninformed view, Kant's a very 'difficult' sort of philosopher. So blogs are definitely useful but a short professional primer may be equally so too.
