Don;t we have examples in Sanskrit literature of people from all walks of life writing and reading letters? Skilled manuscript researches are not always required.

  

As for modern general readers, there is no such thing in the case of Sanskrit. Some people are ready to read old manuscripts, some need British-era-kind of books, some don't read anything that employes Sandhi, and most don't read Sanskrit at all.
