Yes. Good idea, though seemingly tough to put into action. It seems that this has been the practice (not using marks and signs) with scribes writing manuscripts in all regions of India. I have seen the case of manuscripts written using Malayalam script.

Members, please do not take this as an attempt to show off one's ability in annoying people by presenting with long Sanskrit passages without word or sentence boundary markers.

  

From my point of view, the biggest issue with Sanskrit prose, in its modern "regular" style, which other languages like English and HIndi don't generally have to face, is that while reading Sanskrit, one often encounters chunks of text that are devoid of spaces in between, mainly because they are composed of a sequence of words of a special kind. For example, the sentence अहमिदानीमिदमङ्कयामि. The "regular" style does not allow a space in between this sentence. Even if we go with some innovative ways like writing as अहम् इदानीम् इदम् अङ्कयामि, one is almost helpless with chunks where all words have दीर्घ, गुण or वृद्धि सन्धि amongst themselves. On seeing such chunks, which are more difficult than the mere example given above, all one gets is a feeling of exasperation. And then only after a deep breath one begins reading that chunk. Is it not a common experience with most members? Of course, one can use superficial marks above the words to denote boundaries, but all that for such petty issues looks unprofessional and unncecessary. It is not that ideas have never been conveyed in the past without explicit words markers. And not imploying the markers, such as spaces, at all, saves us from sudden outbrusts of exasperation while reading.

  

Following this constraint of not using any word markers, and with a step forward, by removing all sorts of विराम and sentence markers, I have tried to write a passage, keeping it as comprehensible and lucid as possible to allow for a peaceful, jerk-free reading, which comes at the minuscule cost of accepting the style and getting oneself to start reading it.
