It is common to see in South Indian Srivaishnava temples a separate shrine for Sudarshana (chakra).

The obverse is the 16-handed icon, the reverse side has Narasimha in Yogamudra. The most famous and awe inspiring icon is in the Kanchipuram Varadaraja temple. Google search will lead to many more images. Kura-narayana-muni (कूरनारायणमुनि 1160 AD *earlier to Acharya Vedanta Deshika*) has composed Sudarshanashatakam a beautiful stotra in 100 verses. The mUrti has besides 16 hands, three eyes, standing in the pratyAlIDha posture embedded in a hexagon. The 75th verse is

ज्योतिश्च्हूडालमौलिस्त्रिनयनवदनः षोडशोत्तुंगबाहुः

प्रत्यालीढेन तिष्ठन् प्रणवशशधराधार षट्कोणवर्ती \|

निस्सीमेनस्वधाम्ना निखिलमपि जगत्क्षेमवन्निर्मिमाणः

भूयात् सौदर्शनो वः प्रतिभटपरुषः पूरुषः पौरुषाय \|\|

  

The sixteen hands holding symbolic weapons are described in the Dhyanashloka.

There is a Sudarshana-kavaca-stotra composed by Sri Vallabhacharya.

It would be interesting to know the representation of Srinath-ji on the reverse side at the Nathdwara temple.

It should not be surprising to see the Narasimha figure, even though not clearly visible.
