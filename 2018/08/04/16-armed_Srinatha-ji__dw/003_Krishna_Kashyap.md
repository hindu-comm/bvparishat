Ahirbudhnya Samhitahas a lot of details on the concept of Sudarshana. The stotrasof Sri Vedanta Desika summarize the details in simple short poetry style.

Ahirbudhyna, a sattvic form of Siva teaches Narada in this Samhita about Sudarshana since no one seems to have seen this Sudarshana except Siva when Mahavishnu kills an asura. It is a very interesting and powerful concept. Sudarshana signifies all cycles in life like the cycle of life and death, etc. One should read this text to get the details.
