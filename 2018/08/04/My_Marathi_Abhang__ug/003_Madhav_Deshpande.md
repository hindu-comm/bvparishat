Dear Prasad Ji,

  

  I am so happy to read your appreciation of my Marathi Abhangs. I don't know about the clinical effects of chanting the name of Vitthala, but, indeed, reading the Abhangs of a saint like Tukaram brings tears to my eyes. As far as I know, the word Abhang as a name of a certain poetic form is found only in Marathi, but I may be wrong. I don't know if this word is used in Kannad to refer to any creations of saints like Purandaradasa and Kanakadasa. The devotion to Vitthal is common to both of these regions. With best wishes,
