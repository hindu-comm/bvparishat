Sorry for the delay in responding Dr Rajendra Gupta-ji.

  

Thanks for appreciating the views.

  

Thanks for sharing.

  

Hope it connects the younger generation with their roots and removes the misconceptions creeping in.

  

I will be glad if they move from lovers' days to celebration of love.
