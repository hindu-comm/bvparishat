Dear Sir,

Thank you for your wonderful work! I am doing my PhD research at Madurai Kamaraj University on Vaastu Shastra.

Is it possible to have English subtitles with your presentation or to make the same in English?

Surya Siddhantham is a priceless scripture and your work is so much appreciated but I speak only English and Russian.

  

Many thanks!

  

Very sincerely,
