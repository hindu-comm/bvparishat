Namste Goswamiji ,  
I don't think Prof Iyengars paper mentions anything about Big bang theory or microwave radiation.  
  
Einstein special relativity may have some vague or figurative references in ancient Science or mathematical texts. One may find figurative mention of these concepts and how one interprets figurative concepts is left to ones imagination. Indians made a lot of advancement in science, mathematics astronomy, chemistry and several exact sciences these is no dispute but trying to find 20th century science or mathematics in ancient science texts is close to impossible.  
  
This is my opinion.
