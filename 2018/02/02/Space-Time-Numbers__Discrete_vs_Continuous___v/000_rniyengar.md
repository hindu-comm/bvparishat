The discussions on number/space/time going on in another thread on Nyāyamuktāvali, are not properly structured. The concept of Space-Time in Indic knowledge systems (IKS) is too deep and esoteric to be discussed in terms of western paradigms/categories. Nevertheless, modern mathematical notations (off shoot of IKS only) can help one to appreciate the indigenous concepts better. However without a historical perspective such discussions skim the surface. Vedic texts also have to be put in a historical framework before transiting into the classical period.



I have not found a statement yet as complete as the one in MaitrayaNi AraNyaka that says Sun is the origin of Time (s*ūryo yoniḥ kālasya*.....). I have discussed this at some length in my book "Parashara Tantra". Part of this is available in the attached publication on the Seasonal Solar zodiac, that our own Jyotiṣi-s have forgotten. If one goes by translations and Wikipedia meanings of words such as *yoni* one gets nothing, (certainly not the concept of zero)!



As far as continuity/discreteness etc between Music-Time and Astronomy-Time are concerned there is no difference at the conceptual level.In the absence of Tāla (beats) time is sensed through Svara. This is quite clear in Sāmagāna and also in Rāga Ālāpana where they do not have Tāla.



As far back as 500-300 BC the *Nāradīyaśikṣā* figuratively prescribed that the transit from *svara* to *svara* should be smooth like the movement of **shadow and sunlight**. This is as good as a mathematical condition that *svara* must vary as a continuous function of *śruti*, as against discrete pronunciation of jumping from *svara* to *svara* prohibited or at least disliked in Sāmagāna. This is similar to the *amūrta* and *mūrta kāla* and how Mai.Ar. discusses continuous and discrete Time starting with *Nimeṣa*.



Since I posted my paper on Concept of Probability in Indian Music recently on BVP I will not burden the members further about discrete *vs* continuity of Svara in classical music and on how many *svaras* are there in the Indian octave.

Thanks
