'Cosmological Speculations in India' is welcome idea. There is much written material on it. Trying to prattle that there is STR, Quantum mechanics in Navya Nyaya and that mathematics of Big Bang theory was known or hinted in Vishnu Purana are different issues. Any how there might be a different thread on this. Lets discuss further in that thread
