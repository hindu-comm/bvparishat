Haraye namah  
Vidvadbhyo Namah

Namaste Iyengarji. If the discussion deals with Einstein's special relativity, as you mentioned above, spacetime; I would like to add. The concept of spacetime has been explained nyaya-muktavali. Though my doubts have been cleared and you(and other schollars) might be aware of this, still I would like to add.

Vishvanath Bhattacharyaji mentions this in dravyatva-jati-siddhi. "Sanyogasya vibhAgasya va samavAyikAranatayA dravyatva jaati siddheriti." We can prove that dravya is a samavAyikArana of sanyog as Aakash and Kaala have nitya sanyog. Therefore jaati siddhi. This is the point, still sanyogataya there are issues; sanyog being nitya and anitya. But vibhaag being only anitya, jaati siddhi. But the point is that Aakash and Kaal have nitya-sanyog.

Also, I'm a bit confused. How is Surya kaalayoni? What does this mean exactly? As Vishnu, at the time of the emergence of universe had existed in four forms - Vyakta, Pradhan, Purush and Kaal. Kaal Brahm pre-existed. Pradhan, Mahat, Purush etc combined and formed an egg. This egg was where the universe was in state of development. Hiranyagarbha. Then it started expanding and all universe came into being. This, I read in Vishnu Puran, Pratham Amsha, 2nd and 3rd Adhyay. What does the hymn exactly mean? I'm sorry if I'm diverting from the topic.

This theory is also very apt for the Big Bang. They say, that Microwave radiations are proof that universe was much hotter than it is now. So they arrived at the conclusion of the big bang. So, if we say there wasn't any creator(Vishnu), still energy(pradhan), purush(matter), vyakta(I'm not aware) and kaal pre-existed. Also Hiranyagarbha started expanding faster as the hubble discoveries that universe is expanding. So it's quite possible that the universe was hot as Hiranyagarbha was a tejah-punja and thus was golden in appearance. This theory also removes all the doubts which arise with the Big Bang, how did an explosion take place without matter? Where did energy come from? If time was born after the Big Bang, in which time did the Big Bang take place? All these questions don't appear to us if we look at the Hiranyagarbha theory.

Regards  
Rishi.
