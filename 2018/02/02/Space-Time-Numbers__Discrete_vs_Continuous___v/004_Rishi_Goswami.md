Haraye Namah.  
Thankyou Ajitji.  
I'm not an astrologer or mathematician which the discussion is about apparently. I may have drifted from the discussion. I just have interest in knowing the theoritical part of modern science, or rather post-einstanian science.

I have tried to reveal my speculation about special relativity in nyaya-shastra. As Bharatiya Nyaya-shastra doesn't deal with astro-physics, but it accedentally proved a point if payed attention, could be a huge discovery, much before Einstein. The aakash-kaal nitya sanyog.

I would just want to know what schollars think about the Big Bang. Can the Vishnu Puran cosmology be effective? It's just a speculation, can be wrong.

Regards  
Rishi.
