Hello Prof. Iyengar,

  

I tried unsuccessfully to get your paper from the archives by using the search function. I joined recently, so I might have missed it. So a pointer to your original mail or a copy by private email would be greatly appreciated.

  

Could you also point me to the reference in the nAradIya shikShA which talks about discrete vs. continuous?

  

Thank you!

  

Ramakrishnan
