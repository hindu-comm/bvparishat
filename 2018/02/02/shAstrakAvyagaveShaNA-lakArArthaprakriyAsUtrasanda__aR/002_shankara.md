Namaste,

  

Suruparaghavam is available online at the following link.  

  

<https://archive.org/details/SuruparaghavamWithCommentaryOtherWorksOfGomatidasaElatturRamaswamiSastri>  

  

Srichinhakavya was published in Trivandrum Sanskrit Series. I could not find it on the internet.

  

I wonder whether all the sastra kavyas in your list were ever published. (Worldcat search shows only the titles 3 and 8 in addition to 1 and 4 discussed above).  

  

regards  
shankara
