Namaskar Aanandamji.  
Namaskar to all Schollars.  
There can be two meanings of 1 word based on vigrah.  
  
1 विश्वस्य मित्रं इत्यस्मिन् विग्रहे पूर्वपददीर्घे विश्वामित्र इति रूपम्।  
2 विश्वमेव मित्रमस्य इति विग्रहे पूर्वपददीर्घे विश्वामित्र इति रूपम्।  
  
The friend of the world.  
The world is friend of his, that person.  
  
Poorvapadanta-deergha is through Panini Sutram mitre charshau as previously mentioned by schollars.  
Another example of Poorvapadanta-deergha is vishvaavasu by sutram "vishwasya vasuraatoh".  
  
  
  
Hope this helps  
Thankyou.
