Namaste,  

  

As per my understanding विश्वामित्र word formed by विश्व and अमित्र by the rule ofसवर्ण दीर्घसंधि.

  

I'd like to know the origins of this word.

  

My doubt:  

In संस्कृत I have heard commonly to refer enemy, अरि word is used (examples: मुरारि, स्मरारि, पुरारि, जंभारि). But, if

विश्वामित्र means enemy of the world, based on my understanding, why it was not referred anywhere asविश्वारि?

  

I have tried to search if there was a previous post regarding this, I could not fine, so I have posted this.

  

Also, sorry for mixing English and Devnagari in this post.

  

Dhanyavaad,

Annadanam Ravi Kishore
