Dear List members:

  

  

I have a question regarding Mrityunjaya Homa.

  

In a Vedic context is there any special application of a Mrityunjaya homa with respect to Mahamrityunjaya mantra as given in the RV?

  

I am looking for extra addenda in addition to the Yajurveda prayoga for homa.

  

Thanks...

  

Niranjan
