\>\>I have seen the Taittiriya Aranyaka mantras starting from श्रद्धायां प्राणे निविष्टः....being chanted while the shrAddha brahmanas take food.

  

Usually it is the abhisravana mantras which includes purusha sooktam
that are to recited during a shrAddha ceremony... Not this...

They are here:<http://vedamahasabha.in/assan.pdf>

  

Alternatively vishnu sahasranamam is chanted when even purusha sookta cannot be recited when the brahmanaas partake food..

  

However the trisuparna mantra along with the portion of श्रद्धायां प्राणे निविष्टः.. can be recited when the vaideekas/brhamanas take food after a homa/good ritual..

  

\>\> I would like to know where this is

श्रद्धायां प्राणे निविष्टः occurs in Maha Narayanopanishad

It is here with both bhatta bhaskara & sayana bhashyams along iwth translations:

<http://estudantedavedanta.net/Mahanarayana%20Upanishad%20-%20Swami%20Vimalananda%20%5BSanskrit-English%5Dc.pdf>  

  

Page 293 says may I with these oblations become untied with Brahman and attain immortality.

  

\>\>Is it the idea that the neivedyam ultimately goes to Brahman?

YES. Answer is in the previous rik.. antascarati bUteshu...

  

\>\>प्राणाय स्वाहा....... and ending with ब्रह्मणे स्वाहा .  

This appears to be the shortened version of श्रद्धायां प्राणे निविष्टः made by the vaideekas like done for kamOkArsheet manyurkAsheet namo namah instead of chanting the 2 riks in complete on upakarama day ...

  

\>\>Why is it there is no mention of the specific devata in those mantras?

It is from Sruti.. One cannot question SRUTI why it is not there?

Utmost you can get the rishi, chandas & devata for the mantra.
