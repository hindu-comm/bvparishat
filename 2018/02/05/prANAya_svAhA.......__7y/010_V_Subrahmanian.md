Namaste All,

  

I thank all the scholars who kindly responded to the question. I am glad that there are good references in the texts shown in the thread. I would request Sri Venkataraghavan to write a short post on the topic summarizing the various aspects put forward here. Especially, when we see the 'brahmaNe svAhA' being an aspect that is not followed universally, we are reminded of the other daily practice of the chanting of 'ShivAya VishnurUpAya....' verses present in the Kannada and Telugu smarta-s and not there in the Tamil section.

  

warm regards
