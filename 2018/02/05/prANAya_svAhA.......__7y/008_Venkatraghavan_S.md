Namaste,

The second book is available here:<https://archive.org/details/JaiminiyaBramhanaTranslationCommentaryHendrickWilhelmBodewitz1165Brill>

Thanks for the reference, it is really helpful. The footnote on page 263 does seem to corroborate the view that "brahmaNe svAha" was a later addition to the prANAgnihotra ritual. Will look up the reference mentioned.

  

Regards,

Venkatraghavan
