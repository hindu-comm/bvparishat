Thanks Venkat ji, for the Chandogya references. This karma is with reference to the food the individual tconsumes. My question was about the 'brahmaNe svaahaa' that occurs in the end. Should we take it that this last utterance is the one that signifies that Brahman is the one that eats the food individuals eat, and therefore the whole world is satisfied? Is this the basis for using this for the neivedya for any devataa?
