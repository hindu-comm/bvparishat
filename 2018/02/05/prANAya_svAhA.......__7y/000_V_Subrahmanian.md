Namaste

  

  

It is a practice during neivedyam (and our taking meals) to chant these mantras starting fromप्राणाय स्वाहा....... and ending with ब्रह्मणे स्वाहा . I would like to know where this is vihita and what the mantras mean exactly. Who is the devata that is addressed here? We use this in the neivedyam for all devatas. Is it the idea that the neivedyam ultimately goes to Brahman? Why is it there is no mention of the specific devata in those mantras?

  

I have seen the Taittiriya Aranyaka mantras starting from श्रद्धायां प्राणे निविष्टः....being chanted while the shrAddha brahmanas take food.

  

Any clarification is welcome.

  

Thanks and regards
