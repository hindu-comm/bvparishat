Actually when I said that I meant the chanting of these mantras while the shrAddha brAhmanas commence their bhojanam. While we do the parishechanam ourselves, on the shraaddha occasion, the grahastha does that for them and the purohita chants those ...svAhA mantras while the brahmanans put one grain after the other into their mouth. I am aware of the abhisravana mantras and we usually chant the Purusha and Narayana sUktam during that time.

  

Thanks for your other references below. I think the neivedyam procedure has these mantras because we would have invoked the prAna in the deities at the beginning and that gives us the bhAva that they are live deities. Hence these mantras and the devatA name does not occur there since as endowed with prANa, all devata-s are the same.
