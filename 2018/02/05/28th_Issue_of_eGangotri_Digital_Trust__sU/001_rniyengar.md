Great work! Keep it up.

  

Thanks for sharing the details. In fact Govt.of India should acquire digitally all manuscripts stored outside India also and put them online for free public reading, awareness and eventual publication, if found worthy.

  

Just preaching about history and tradition does not take the younger generation any where.
