Namaste,

  

Sanskrit text of this stotra is available at the following link.

<https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_devii/devidashashlokii.html?lang=sa>  

  

Though this stotra is attributed to Kalidasa, stotra collections like Brihat Stotra Ratnakara published by Nirnayasagar Press in 1912 & 1952 and by Dhawale Prakashan in 2013 contain a stotra named Ambashtaka attributed to Sankaracharya. All 8 verses of this ashtaka are found in Asvadhati stotra.

  

Link to earlier discussion at BV Parishat group on this stora.
