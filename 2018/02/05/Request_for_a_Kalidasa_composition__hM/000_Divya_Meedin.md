Respected members,

  

I recently happened to listen to a beautiful rendering of Mahakavi Kalidasa's Devi Aswadhati / Dasa Sloki Stuti. I would be grateful if I could get its script in Sanskrit or English, with meaning. I eagerly look forward to any help/pointers in this regard.

  

Sincerely,

Divya
