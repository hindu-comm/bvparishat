Dear Shri Abhyankar,

  

  As you have guessed yourself, 'ā' is both dīrgha and vr̥ddhi in relation to a short 'a'. Which aspect becomes functional simply depends upon what prescriptive rule we are looking at. In the case of P.1.1.101 (akaḥ savarṇe dīrghaḥ), it is the dīrgha aspect of ā that is seen, while in deriving pāṇḍava from paṇḍu, it is the vr̥ddhi of the first vowel that is prescribed by Pāṇini. In any case, 'ā' is the only case, where both terms, namely dīrgha and vr̥ddhi, become applicable. In the case of 'u', the guṇa is 'o' and vr̥ddhi is 'au', while 'ū' is the dīrgha.
