Dear Deshpandeji,

  

I am going through your book length article on the above subject.

  

Patanjali says that the purpose of grammar is to overcome confusion or doubts. However from your article it appears that these rules are creating more problems than affording solutions for pragmatic problems.

  

In the circumstances is it not necessary to find new ways for solving pragmatic problems?

  

I think that the main lacunae lies in not describing or defining the human phonetic corpus in detail (**in terms of articulation**) resulting in each author relying on his own (subjective) phonation or taking refuge under some philosophical system. 

  

At the beginning of the article you have said that "These (i.e. Maheshwar Sutras) serve as a fundamental reference catalogue of certain sounds, arranged in a particular order conducive to the proper and concise formulation of the grammatical rules. Its purpose is not to give an inventory of all Sanskrit sounds, nor to teach correct pronunciation but purely to facilitate concise formulation of rules."

  

The above goes contrary to Patanjali's view who holds that the Maheshwar Sutras also serve the purpose of instructing each letter chastely.

  

What I have attempted is to formulate sutras so that the variations that letters undergo in usage are also listed in the manner of the Maheshwar Sutras.

  

For example the sutra ट क प ड त ज ग द ब चट् helps an individual to observe the changes that vowels undergo both in pitch and articulation when अ is suffixed to the stops or consonants..

They are these sutras that I have uploaded in the video on Youtube.
