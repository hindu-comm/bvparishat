Dear Scholars,

  

I think that the ideation of Savarna should be worked out on the basis of minimum difference rather than on the basis of similarity. If there are 'n' number of aspects that go into the actualization of a particular letter those letters can be considered to be Savarna in which number of [difference.in](http://difference.in) aspects is the least.

  

Thus once the number of aspects of articulation for each letter are enumerated we can then quantify how far or near each of the letter is from any other letter. Proximity will determine how effective one letter is a Savarna of another. In cases where the need for replacement is dire and a proximal Savarna does not serve purpose a distant Savarna might be more practical and useful.

  

This said done the question of the need of replacement of letters in Sanskrit still remains open.

  

I hope the above premise is theoretically valid.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
