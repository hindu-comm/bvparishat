You should have started a new thread on शिवसूत्राणि, because your responses digresses from this thread, which is about सवर्ण-s. Actually the सूत्रम् immediately after तुल्यास्यप्रयत्नं सवर्णम् (1'1'9)is नाज्झलौ (1'1'10). This explicitly clarifies that even if some अच्-s and some हल्-s may have same आस्य and प्रयत्न, they are not to be considered as सवर्ण-s. This is exactly why your post detailing all शिवसूत्राणि digresses from the present thread, which is about सवर्ण-s.

  

Keeping the focus onसवर्ण, I glanced through the critical word-index of अष्टाध्यायी and get that the wordसवर्ण can be found in just of 5 of the total 3950+ सूत्र-s of अष्टाध्यायी. The सूत्र-s are =>

1.  1'1'9 तुल्यास्यप्रयत्नं सवर्णम्
2.  1'1'58 न
    पदान्त-द्विर्वचन-वरे-यलोप-स्वर-सवर्णानुस्वार-दीर्घ-जश्-चर्विधिषु
3.  1'1'69 अणुदित् सवर्णस्य चाप्रत्ययः
4.  6'1'101 अकः सवर्णे दीर्घः
5.  6'1'102 प्रथमयोः पूर्वसवर्णः => This is missed out in thecritical
    word-index (!) 6.  8'4'65 झरो झरि सवर्णे => Does this mean that concept ofसवर्ण
    applies also to consonants ?

Actually this wordसवर्ण would also become अनुवृत्त fromतुल्यास्यप्रयत्नं सवर्णम् (1'1'9) intoनाज्झलौ (1'1'10).

  

One curiosity has been bogging my mind since long.

Resultant isआ forअच्-सन्धि-s of अ+अ, अ+आ, आ+अ and आ+आ. These are byअकः सवर्णे दीर्घः (6'1'101). This makesआ to beदीर्घ ofअ.

But in वृद्धिरादैच् (1'1'1) आ is a वृद्धिरूपम् and as per अदेङ्गुणः (1'1'2) अ is a गुणरूपम्.

  

The question then is, "What exactly is the relationship between अ and आ ? Is it गुण-वृद्धिrelationship or ह्रस्व-दीर्घrelationship ?

-   OR do they have both relationships ?
-   What is the distinction between the two relationships ?
-   How does one understand, which relationship is valid in which
    instance ? RATHER -   How does one make a choice of which relationship to apply when,
    specifically in respect ofअ and आ ?
