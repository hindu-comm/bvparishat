**Dear Madhav,**

**I appreciate your exegesis that makes things clearer. But one must retrospect on why our own grammars the AÀ¶¡dhy¡y¢, the K¡¿ik¡ and the K¡¿ik¡vivara¸apaµjik¡ should not suffice. There was further extension of the subcomentaries – Padamaµjar¢, Prakriy¡kaumud¢, Siddh¡ntakaumud¢ with the B¡lamanoram¡ andTattvabodhin¢ should not be sufficient for the purpose? Still one lacks a few essentials.**

**These deal less with Sanskrit than with paralinguistic elements including the problem of bal¡balanir¸aya and application of laukikany¡ya for Vy¡kara¸a. **

**No problem of bal¡balani¸aya rises with the Wackernagel, Macdonell or Whitney. **
