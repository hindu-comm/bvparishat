Dear Colleagues,

  

In response to Shri Karve's questions about savarṇa in Pāṇini, I want to mention that I wrote a book-length treatment of this subject in 1975 under the title "Critical Studies in Sanskrit Grammarians: Theory of Homogeneity (Sāvarṇya)." Those who are interested in a pdf of this book can access it from the link below:

The link will remain active for a week. With best wishes,

  

Madhav Deshpande
