‘I suddenly felt that since it is on Krishna, could it be that it isमथुराधिपते.’

**The *mathu*- of the word *Mathur**¡* मथुरा is a variation of *madhu*, which is of Vedic origin, perhaps with relation to *mad*. The hypothetical \**Madhur¡* is formed with *madhu. Mathur**¡* is a dialectal variation that has come to stay replacing the original word \**Madhur**¡* . A voiced origin of the th of Mathur¡ can be traced from the name of its southern parallel *Madur**¡* with d for dh. *mathur**¡**dhipate**Å* is also recited with the variation *madhur**¡* *dhipate**Å*. I spoke from personal experience. **
