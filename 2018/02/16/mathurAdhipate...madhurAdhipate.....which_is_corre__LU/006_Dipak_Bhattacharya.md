The *mathu*- of the word *Mathur¡* मथुरा is a dialectal variation of *madhu*, which is of Vedic origin, perhaps with relation to *mad*. The distortion has however, come to stay. The hypothetical \**Madhur¡* is formed with *madhu. Mathur**¡* is a dialectal variation that has come to stay replacing the original word \**Madhur**¡* . A voiced origin of the th of Mathur¡ can be traced from the name of its southern parallel *Madur**¡* with d for dh. *mathur**¡dhipateÅ* is also recited with the variation *madhur**¡* *dhipateÅ*.

Vallabh¡charya was not influenced by the dialectal variation.
