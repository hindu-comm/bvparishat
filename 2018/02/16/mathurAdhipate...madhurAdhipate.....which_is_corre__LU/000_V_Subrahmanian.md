While thinking of the famous madhuraashTakam, I suddenly felt that since it is on Krishna, could it be that it isमथुराधिपते...? And when I gave a search with this word, I was surprised to get results:

  

<http://stotram.lalitaalaalitah.com/2011/03/hymns-to-krishna-madhurashtaka.html>  

  

(वल्लभाचार्यकृतम्)

अधरं मधुरं वदनं मधुरं नयनं  
मधुरं हसितं मधुरम् ।

हृदयं मधुरं गमनं मधुरं मथुराधिपतेरखिलं  
मधुरम् ॥ १ ॥

Very few results with this word were obtained. However, with the popular word '.मधुराधिपते..' countless results were found. 

  

Is there any निर्णायकः for this? In any case it is called 'मधुराष्टकम्' popularly and it is because of the maadhurya paanam by the poet and not because it is of a person of whose everything is madhura.

  

Thoughts of members here are welcome.

  

warm regards
