That was my first thought. So, I checked whether it was Nandinagari. It isn't. It is also not Modi, Siddham, Newari or Sarada to the extent that I checked. I also looked for ణ (ण) in a wide range of scripts (Javanese, Cambodian, Thai, Sinhala in addition to Indian scripts but this particular shape seems to be unique to Telugu and Kannada.

  

What is also intriguing is that even where a string of Nagari letters could be made out, the cluster does not seem to part of a valid word. I am wondering if it is some sort of Prakrit and if the text is a Jain text.
