Thank you, Sir, for the pointer.

  

I checked up नारदबैठ् (<http://vedicreserve.mum.edu/shiksha/Naradabaith.html>) and can see how it would be next to impossible to decode such a text without knowing the reference text and the encoding system.

  

Given that the text has 28 sides, five lines to a page, it must be either an incomplete one (there seem to be no auspicious letters or salutations at the beginning; am not sure if there is a colophon) or must be a similar index to some other text.

  

Regards

N Siva Senani
