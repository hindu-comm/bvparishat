Salutations to all scholars.

  

Mr. Naushad, a friend of my classmate from school acquired a manuscript in Atlanta. A couple of leaves from this were sent to me for identification. I am unable to identify the script, much less the text. I request scholars to look at it and give some pointers in identifying the script and the text. Details of the manuscript:

  

Material: old hand made parchment, two to three times thicker than normal paper

Arrangement: Vertically folded like a harmonica, written on both sides

Number of leaves; 14 leaves, 28 sides

Procured in a garage sale in Atlanta, Georgia, USA by Mr. Naushad

  

To me, the script looks like a member of the Nagari family but the ocurence of the Telugu / Kannada character ణ (ण) is curious (second folio, second line, seventh characterr). Also the cluster of symbols "8\|\|\|" seems to stand for a virama.

  

Regards

N. Siva Senani
