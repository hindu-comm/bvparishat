Dear Scholars,

  

   As I already indicated in my message "What is Gandhola ?", I have already completed the translation of "In Bihar", which consists of pp.187-230 of the book"Очерки Цейлона и Индии" (Sketches of Ceylon and India) (1878) by theThe Russian Indologist Ivan Minayev, who visited Bihar in 1875. He has mentioned the names of Cunningham (4 times), Broadley (2 times), Taranath (3 times), Faxian (4 times), Xuanzhang (5 times) and Mohammed Bakhtiyar (once).

  

   Ivan Minayev's this memoir has historical and archival importance. So far this Russian article, as far as I know, was never translated into English or any other Indian language.

  

   Kindly suggest whether this English translation could be published somewhere. Translation of the first 3-4 pages is attached.

   Thanks and regards

   Narayan Prasad
