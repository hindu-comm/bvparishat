Namaste

  

With regard to the two verses that you have described as being in bad taste, I have heard that they have been added by some disciples of Madhva and not compositions of Madhva himself. The clue is: ...यतीन्द्रे भक्तिरस्तु मे - an obvious reference to Madhva by one of his disciples.

  

I also heard that this 'practice' of adding verses by someone who is not the author of the original work is seen in a/some works of Jayatirtha as well.
