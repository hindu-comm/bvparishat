Hi

  

I was reading a book Empires of the Indus by Alice Albinia who has written about her travels along the Sindhu River. In that she mentions about Khalash People who reside in Chitral region of Pakistan. She details about the striking similarities between Aryans Hinduism and the Khalash people like worshipping nature Gods reverence for horse etc . Does any one who know about these people can throw more light on this.

  

wiki link on khalash people

Thank You
