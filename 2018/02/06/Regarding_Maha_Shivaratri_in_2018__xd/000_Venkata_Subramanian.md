According to many panchangs (almanac) MahaShivaratri is to be observed on 13th February 2018 Tuesday nighṭ

But in the panchangam published by Manonmani Vilas Press Pvt Ltd , Chennai , It is specified that on 13th February 2018 Mahasivaratri is to be observed in all temples and on 14th Ffebruary 2018 Mahasivaratri is to be observed according to SMRITI.

ON BOTH THE DAYS THE CHATURDASHI THITHI IS ON MIDNIGHṬ

On what day the householders should observe MAHASHIVARATRI- IS IT 13TH OR 14TH?

IF SO WHAT IS THE AUTHORITY/

SHRI SRINGERI MUTT PANCHANG SPECIFIES ON 13TH FEBRUARY/

WHICH IS CORRECT/
