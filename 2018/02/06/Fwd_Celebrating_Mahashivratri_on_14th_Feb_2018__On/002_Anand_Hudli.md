Scholars,

  

The following text from Dharmasindhu summarizes the rules applicable for determining the date for observance of shivarAtri.

  

अथ शिवरात्रिः। सा निशीथव्यापिनी ग्राह्या। निशीथस्तु रात्रेरष्टमो मुहूर्त इत्युक्तम्। तत्र परदिन एवार्धरात्रौ परा पूर्वत्रैव तद्व्याप्तौ पूर्वा। दिनद्वयेप्यर्धरात्रव्याप्त्यभावेऽपि परैव। दिनद्वये कार्र्त्स्न्येनैकदेशेन वा अर्धरात्रव्याप्तौ पूर्वेति हेमाद्र्याशयानुसारी कौस्तुभः परैवेति माधवनिर्णयसिन्धुपुरुषार्थचिन्तामण्यादयो बहवः। परेद्युर्निशीथैकदेशव्याप्तौ पूर्वेद्युः संपूर्णतद्व्याप्तौ पूर्वैव। पूर्वदिने निशीथैकदेशव्याप्तौ परदिने संपूर्णतद्व्याप्तौ परैव। इदं व्रतं रविवारभौमवारयोगे शिवयोगयोगे चातिप्रशस्तम् ।

  

According to the rules mentioned above, if there is ekadeshavyApti (partial cover) of Chaturdashi duringनिशीथ kAla on the second day, in this case, Feb 14, and sampUrNa vyApti on the first day, in this case, Feb 13, then the first day, Feb 13 is chosen for observing shivarAtri. The Sringeri panchanga, based on sUryasiddhAnta calculations for tithi ending times, has chosen Feb 13 to be the shivarAtri observance based on this rule. Kanchi, on the other hand, has sampUrNa vyApti on both days, according to the dRg-gaNita and modern calculations. They have taken the majority opinion, i.e. that of nirNayasindhu and other works, and decided to follow the observance on Feb 14. Note that the sunset times of Sringeri and Kanchi differ and hence, the start ( and ending) times ofनिशीथ kAla differ in the two places. It is interesting to note that even if Sringeri were to use dRg-gaNita or modern calculations for tithis, still the date of Feb 13 will hold. Indeed, other modern calculations based panchangas that I have seen, such as the one from Solapur, Maharashtra, called Date Panchanga (quite popular in those areas), have declared Feb 13 as the date for shivarAtri. All this means desha-bheda plays an important role in determing shivarAtri this year. One needs to find out theनिशीथ kAla start and ending times at a particular place in order to determine the date for shivarAtri. A further tricky part could be the selection of the method for computing tithi ending times - sUryasiddhAnta or AryamAna or dRg-gaNita, etc.
