Very many thanks to Sri Dr.Korada Subrahmanyam and Sri Anand Hudli for clarifications and lucid explanation regarding the Thithi Nirnaya for Mahasivaratri in 2018..

Sri Anand Hudli is correct in saying that desha-beda also determines the Thithi nirnaya.

14th must have been preferred because of vyapthi of chadurdashi in midnight -lingodhbhava murti time.

On 13th also vyapti of chadurdashi is in mid nighṭ

In Tamilnadu many temples observe mahasivaratri on 13tḥ

But it is observed on 14th also by otherṣ

Sri Anand Hudli has given the reason in a convincing manner
