Dear friends,

Good morning.

In our slow walk here in understanding India's cultural history we are in

200BC-500AD period. We are encountering Manusrmiti, which I have

not read. I would like to hear from the scholars who might have researched

on the material: the date, the author(s) and the text.

Also I would like to know if a critical edition is available.

Thank you.
