Namaste,

  

Dr. Surendra Kumar's Visuddha Manusmriti can perhaps be considered a critical edition of Manusmriti though it was not prepared in the conventional manner after critically studying various manuscripts of MS. Surendra Kumar's aim in preparing this edition was to purge the Manusmriti of all interpolations.

In his edition of complete Manusmriti, he points out interpolated verses and also provides copious notes explaining the reasons why he considers them to be interpolations.
