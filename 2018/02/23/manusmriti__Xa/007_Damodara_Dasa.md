Hare Krishna.  
  
Dear sir,  
  
I am studying Many Smrti with Medhatithi's commentary both translated  
into English be renowned Indian Scholar Ganganath Jha, who is also  
considered an authority on mimamsa. He has nicely translated. It is a  
ten volume set with original Sanskrit, suddhipatra, etc as in a  
standard scholarly text. You can search for it. Currently cost may be  
about rs.15000.  
  
You may want to contact me for more information.  
  
Dasanusas,  
Damodar das
