Patrick Olivell's critical edition is good and based on Manusmriti evidence. Of course even he considers some 200 verses as Interpolation using higher criticism which we can ignore. Similarly, I find Surendranath's Vishuddha Manusmriti which rejects half of Manusmriti as Interpolation using Higher criticism, which is speculation and sometimes on flimsy grounds as problematic.  
  
It is better to use Patrick's critical edition (minus his higher criticism) along with tradional commentaries like those of Kulluka.
