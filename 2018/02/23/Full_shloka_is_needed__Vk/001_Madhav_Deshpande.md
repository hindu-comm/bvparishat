Dear Joshiji,

  

  Here is the verse you are asking about:

  

*ये नाम केचिदिह न*:*प्रथयन्त्यवज्ञां*

जानन्तु ते किमपि तान्प्रति नैष यत्नः \|.

उत्पत्स्यतेऽस्ति मम कोऽपि समानधर्मा

कालो ह्ययं निरवधिर्विपुला च पृथ्वी \|\|

  

It is found in Bhavabhūti's Mālatīmādhava. It is also found at the beginning of Bhaṭṭa Umbeka's commentary on Kumārilabhaṭṭa's Ślokavārttika.
