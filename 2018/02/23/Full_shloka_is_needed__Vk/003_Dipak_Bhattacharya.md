23.2.18

Dear Colleagues,

I may be mistaken, but I vaguely remember the third quarter as *utpatsyate hi mama ko* *’pi sam¡nadharm¡*/ as published in the edition by Saradaranjan Ray

I wonder how the adverse criticism of Bhavabh£ti, as to be inferred from *ye n¡ma ke cid etc* was published! There was no press. Nor could sales take place to have an indicator as a determinant.The first performance at the King’s theatre must have been observed by critics. But their number could only be limited while the report *bh¡san¡¶akacakre* *’pi chekaiÅ kÀipte par¢kÀitum* *svapnav¡savadattasya d¡hako* *’bh£n na p¡vakaÅ*// seems to indicate mass public criticism and a widely accepted living theatrical tradition without any stereotype. 

Best
