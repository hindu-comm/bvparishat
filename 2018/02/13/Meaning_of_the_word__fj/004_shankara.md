Namaste,

  

Monier Williams and Vachaspatya mentionछुच्छु the masculine form of this word. Vachaspatyam gives its feminine form as छुच्छुका. Both lexicons cite Brihatsamhita Chapter 85 verse 37 (As per MW it is Br. Sa. 86.37). Bhattotpala explains it as a type of rodent.

  

शिवा श्यामा रला छुच्छुः पिङ्गला गृहगोधिका।  
सूकरी परपुष्टा च पुन्नामानश्च वामतः॥ Br. Sa. 85.37  
  
छुच्छुः छुच्छुन्दरी मूषकजातिः - भट्टोत्पलः  

  

Relevant page from Bhattotpala's commentary is attached.

  

A goddess named छुच्छुन्दरी is mentioned in sahasranamas of Goddess like Matangi Sahasranama, Pratyangira Sahasranama. The latter is from Rudrayamala, so more details can be found in commentaries on Rudrayamala.
