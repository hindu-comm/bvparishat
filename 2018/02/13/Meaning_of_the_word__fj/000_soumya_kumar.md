Respected vidvans,

  

In the Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra, while dealing with Vimsamsa kundali, Maharshi Parashara has mentioned about ruling deities of different amsas. All the divisions have been named after goddesses. One of the deity is **छुच्छुका.** I tried various books - tantra and mantra to understand the nature of this goddess, but was unable to locate any goddess as such.

  

One of my friends said that his friend opined that this is schutva sandhi word and as such represents Kamakshi, one who is holding the parrot like pApas in her hand.

  

Please enlighten me whether this usage is right or not. The relevant shloka from Brihat Parashara is pasted below. The verse is from Chapter 6 and numbered 19/20 depending on different editions.

  

  

  

  

  

With pranams
