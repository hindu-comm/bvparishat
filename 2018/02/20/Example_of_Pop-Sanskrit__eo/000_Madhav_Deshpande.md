In today's issue of the Marathi newspaper Sakal, I came across the following headline:

  

निर्यातीभिमुख धोरण

"Pro-Export Policy"

  

The wordनिर्यातीभिमुख is an interesting combination of निर्यात and अभिमुख. The wordनिर्यात has the oblique formनिर्याती- in cases other than the nominative. Thus the formनिर्यातीभिमुख is actually a combination ofनिर्याती andअभिमुख. A pure Sanskrit sandhi would have given निर्यात्यभिमुख, but then the Marathi reader would not recognize the first word asनिर्याती-. On the other hand, the expression -भिमुखinनिर्यातीभिमुख is evidently recognizable as अभिमुख.Therefore, the somewhat unusual sandhi seems to have been adopted. There must be similar examples in Marathi as well as in other Indian languages of limited adaptations of Sanskrit.
