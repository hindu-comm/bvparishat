Dear Scholars,

  

I am going through the “Dhatu Patha Handbook” by Sri Ashwini Kumar Agarwal Page No. 137 (kindle edition)

For the root क्ष्णु *kṣṇu*, the conjugation ready root or stem is given as क्ष्ण् *kṣṇ*. But I am not able to find this stem क्ष्ण् *kṣṇ* in the dictionary, Where as the other stems like नु *nu*, क्षु *kṣu*, स्नु *snu*, I am able to find them in the MW dictionary. Can you please help me why I can not find stem क्ष्ण् *kṣṇ* in the dictionary.

  

Regards

Ramana murthy
