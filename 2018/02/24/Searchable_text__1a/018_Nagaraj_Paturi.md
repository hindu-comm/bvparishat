Adhikaara as in KarmaNyEvaadhikaarah is different from the adhikaara as in the apparently hierarchical /grading words such as uttamaadhikaarin, madhyamaadhikaarin and adhamaadhikaarin.

  

Even if jnaana and karma are considered to be hierarchically graded by S'ankara, there are just two grades.

  

Among these two grades, if Arjuna is considered to be 'eligible' (though the intent seems to be 'suited') for the lower grade called karma, even then, it is still not madhyamaadhikaarin.

  

Adhikaara to what? To the instruction contained in the book Geetaa?

  

Is jnaana the highest grade instruction from it and karma the lower (at least as per S'ankara)?

  

For books, usually uttamaadhikaarin is the ne who understands the intended communication of the author completely, madhyamaadhikaarin is the one who understands the innermost intent only partially and adhamaadhikaarin is the one who understands only the superficial aspects of the intended communication not the innermost aspects even partially.

  

Is Arjuna such a madhyamaadhikaarin receiver of Krishna's instruction? That is why he is madhyamaadhikaarin?

  

Or

  

Are there three graded paths (graded by S'ankara) instructed in the book - to the same goal (?) - and Arjuna, as per S'ankara, is considered by Krishna to be 'eligible' to only the middle grade path and that is why he is considered as the adhikaarin to madhyamaa and hence madhyamaadhikaarin?
