So far, we have not seen the words of S'ankara declaring Arjuna as madhyamaadhikaarin.

  

So far, we have not seen Madhvaachaarya's words making a direct or indirect indication that he was counter-arguing such a description of
Arjuna by S'ankaraachaarya.

  

IMHO, if we get a direct evidence for the words of S. Radhakrishnan-ji, its well and good.

  

Otherwise, we may consider that that is the interpretation of Sri Radhakrishnan-ji.

  

Similarly, the view that Madhvaachaarya in his beginning of Geetaataatparya was responding to the alleged view of S'ankara could be an interpretation by Sri Bhavani Sudhindra (?) could also be his interpretation of Madhvaachaarya's words under the influence of Sri Radhakrishnan'sinterpretation of S'ankara.

  

We need not toil to prove these modern understandings right by searching for words which come close to these interpretations.
