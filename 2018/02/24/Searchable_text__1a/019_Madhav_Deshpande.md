Dear Nagarajji,

  

  Here is the passage form Radhakrishnan's introduction to his TR of the Bhagavadgītā \[p.67\]:

It is now clear to me that Śaṅkara himself does not use the term madhyamādhikāri in reference to Arjuna. However, the Bhāṣyaon the verse "*vyāmiśreṇeva vākyena buddhim mohayasīva me*" \[BG 3.2\]uses the term mandabuddhi to refer to him: *yadyapi viviktābhidhāyī bhagavān tathāpi mama mandabuddher vyāmiśram iva bhagavadvākyam pratibhāti.* On the contrary, Madhvācārya calls Arjuna *uttamādhikārī* at the beginning of his Bhagavadgītā-Tātparya-Nirṇaya.
