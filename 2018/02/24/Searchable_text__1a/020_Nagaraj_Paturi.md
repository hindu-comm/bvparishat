Dear Prof. Deshpande,

  

1\. \> On the contrary, Madhvācārya calls Arjuna*uttamādhikārī*at the beginning of his Bhagavadgītā-Tātparya-Nirṇaya. Contrary to what?

  

2. S'ankara does not call Arjuna 'mandabuddhi'. While paraphrasing the first person expression of Arjuna, he uses the first person expression'*yadyapi viviktābhidhāyī bhagavān tathāpi* ****mama**** *mandabuddher vyāmiśram iva bhagavadvākyam pratibhāti.'.* So S'ankara is saying that Arjuna is considering himself or making himself appear to be 'mandabuddhi' .

Sri V. Subrahmanianji pointed out this finer aspect already when he said, " यद्यपि विविक्ताभिधायी भगवान् , तथापि मममन्दबुद्धेः व्यामिश्रमिव भगवद्वाक्यं प्रतिभाति । This is the thinking ***by Arjuna***, ***as per Shankara***, BG 3.2 bhashya"  

  

3. Why should Arjuna, use expressions such as 'व्यामिश्रेणेव वाक्येन बुद्धिं मोहयतीव मे' ? In books such as BhG, which are composed in the form of a conversation between a guru and a s'ishya, the s'ishya represents the target reader / target audience of the book. When the composer of the book realises that the explanation given so far by the guru could be difficult to the targetreader / target audience of the book to grasp, further clarifications may help the targetreader / target audience of the book, the composer of the book makes the s'shya say, ' I am not able to grasp. I am a bit confused. Please clarify. '. This is a very good technique to make the targetreader / target audience of the book feel that the book is able to read his mind and respond to all his questions almost as an interactive presentation.

  

4. So the mandabuddhi that is presented by Arjuna as his is, in fact, that of a certain level ofthetargetreader / target audience of the book.

  

5. Prof. S. Radhakrishnan's expression madhyamaadhikaarin is not coming from this vyaamis'rENEva context. It is coming from a jnaana-karma context. His defective expressions such as salvation for moksha show his capability of making defective expressions such as madhyamaadhikaarin.

  

6. There is no proof that Madhvaachaarya was saying Arjuna is a uttamaadhikaarin in response to any words of S'ankara. Nor is there a proof that S'ankara had a view contrary to this view of Madhva about Arjuna.
