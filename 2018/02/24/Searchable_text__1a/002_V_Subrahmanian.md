Here is a resource:
<http://advaitasharada.sringeri.net/display/bhashya/Gita>    The chapters are arranged on the right panel and one can open it and expand all verses bhashyas will be seen. One can then use the control F and initiate a search. Or, one can go the anveShaNam of the main menu and give a word and select Bhagavadgita and that will give you results in the entire Gita commentary, if the word is found there. To my knowledge, there is no one single page where the entire Gita commentary is available for a search.
