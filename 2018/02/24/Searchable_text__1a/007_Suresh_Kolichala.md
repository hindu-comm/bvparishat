Dear Madhavji,  
  
Have you checked the supersite of IIT-K which has the text for all the important commentaries including Śankaraand Madhva.  
  
<https://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in>  
  
Also the following paper appears to discuss the topic in detail, which I have only a snippet view access on google books:  
  
Bhavani, Sudhindra: Is Arjuna amadhyamadhikarin? \[Engl.\]. In: Studies in Indian history and culture: volume presented to Dr. P. B. Desai ... 1971. - pp. 412-415  
  
The following snippet appears to confirm Sankara proposed Arjuna as a Madhyamadhikarin.  

*  
*

Madhva has therefore, hastened to correct this impression left by Śankara and dispel the myth of*Arjuna's*being a*Madhyamadhikarin*. At the very beginning of his Gīta-Tatparya he hailsArjunaas a front rank Adhikari (Uttamadhikari) and as the best beloved of the Lord (Atmanah priyatamah).
