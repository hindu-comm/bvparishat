I am trying to find if and where Śaṅkara uses the term madhyamādhikārin in reference to Arjuna in his Gītābhāṣya. Radhakrishnan, in his introduction to his translation of the Bhagavadgītā, attributes this view to Śaṅkara. I have not yet found a passage in Śaṅkara's Gītābhāṣya where he used the term madhyamādhikārin for Arjuna. I would appreciate if anyone else has come across such a passage.
