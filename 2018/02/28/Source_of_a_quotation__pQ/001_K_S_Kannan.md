The author of this must have been a North Indian:

this is a verse in *anus"Tubh*

with one syllable extra (in the opening quarter here)

somewhat slurred over, as in Hindi,

which makes it hear like a half-mAtrA,

and so gives the semblance of 8 syllables only.

  

Even the Bhagavad Gita has more than one verse

(and obviously the epics/purana-s have)

where we have 9 syllables, as here, in a quarter in the*anus"Tubh*verse.
