Sir,

Namaskar and thanks for your reply. But it is detailed explanation of Sanatan dharma. I am searching for exact definition, as Muslims or Christians define their dharma. Shastras say धारणाद्धर्मः i.e.dharma is sustainer. Or Dharma is that which is practised. This is very vague, as even immoral practices also resorted. I feel Sanatan Dharma should be renamed as मानवधर्म
