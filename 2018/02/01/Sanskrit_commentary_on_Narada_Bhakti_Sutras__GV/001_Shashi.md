Srirama ji,

This link seems to be broken.

And I am unable to find any text by him on the subject.

Please let me know if the text is available elsewhere. I am studying NBS currently.

I did find a link to an audio by him [here](https://archive.org/details/NaradaBhaktisutras).

  

Dhanyavada.

Shashikant
