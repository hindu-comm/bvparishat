Michael Witzel's scathing criticism of Shrikant Talageri's work on Out of India theory based on Rigveda studies

  

<https://www.academia.edu/18428668/The_Incredible_Wanderlust_of_the_Rgvedic_Tribes_Exposed_by_S.Talageri?email_work_card=view-paper>  

  

Michael Witzel's paper, (link given below for convenience again) has exposed what I always suspected, and objected to, about Michael Witzel's nasty tongue in trying to discredit Shrikant Talageri. The strategem he applies is to demand Shrikant recognize and quote only western sources as base references while determining the geographical references, linguistic and historical references. He sneers at Puranas as 'Fantasies'. He discredits Shrikant's knowledge of Sanskrit. He says Shrikant has not said anything new than what was stated in his (Shrikan'ts) 1993 work.

  

Shrikant's tome obviously assiduously tries to prove that Vedic people were internal to India, and that migration occurred outward than any claim of AIT. Obviously, Michael's silly claims show that he has no understanding of puranas, and the way to read history through puranas. Ramayana, for instance, has the entire Raghuvamsam described in chronological order. Writers like Shri Kota Venkatachalam have proved that Max Mueller's way of looking at timelines is all wrong.

  

I wonder if any in the group have studied both Shrikant's work as well as Michael's criticism thereof so we can gain insight into the breaking India forces at work here.
