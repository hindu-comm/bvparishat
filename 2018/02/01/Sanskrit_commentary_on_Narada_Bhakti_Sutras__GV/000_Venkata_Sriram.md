Namaste,

  

There is a beautiful commentary in Sanskrit on Narada Bhakti Sutras by Swami Harshananda ji of RK Mutt, Bangalore. I have purchase this online and reading it.

  

I am enjoying this and thought of sharing with you as it is the custom that the 'madhura-padArtha' should never be eaten alone.

  

Here is the link for e-book.
