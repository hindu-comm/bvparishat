A friend of mine in Canada is looking for a printed book to purchase or a pdf version ofBalagopala stuti of Bilvamangala.

  

The book seems to be available in the form of images of manuscript written in Gujarat. But the script in those images seems to be not very much readable.

  

He is looking for a proof read legible copy.

  

Any pointers are greatly appreciated.

  

Thanks in advance.
