Dear Scholars,  

  

'Why is the decimal number system written from right to left and not from left to right?

  

In vernacular languages in India numerals are counted with units first and then the tens as ('ekvis' 'bavis' in Marathi) however in English they are counted tens first (as twenty one, twenty two,etc.) How does it reflect on the evolution of writing the decimal numeral system and also on the origin of the sign '0' for Zero or Shunya.'

  

This is a question I raised with respect to another thread a week or so ago. To my knowledge except for Arabic no other ancient language is written from right to left. Hebrew needs to be checked.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve
