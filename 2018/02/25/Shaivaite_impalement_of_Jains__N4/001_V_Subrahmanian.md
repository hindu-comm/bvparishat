There are more details available in this page:
[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impalement_of_the_Jains_in_Madurai](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impalement_of_the_Jains_in_Madurai), the highlight being:

  

// The Pandyan king mentioned in the legend (variously called "Kun Pandya" or "Sundara Pandya"^([\[7\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impalement_of_the_Jains_in_Madurai#cite_note-FOOTNOTESteven_Paul_Hopkins200281-7))) is identified as the 7th century ruler[Arikesari Maravarman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arikesari_Maravarman "Arikesari Maravarman").^([\[9\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impalement_of_the_Jains_in_Madurai#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKlaus_K._Klostermaier2005176-9))*Thus, the first mention of the legend dates nearly 500 years after the event supposedly took place.* The[Meenakshi temple](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meenakshi_Amman_Temple "Meenakshi Amman Temple")frescoes depicting the event were created only in the 17th century, around a thousand years after the incident.^([\[8\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impalement_of_the_Jains_in_Madurai#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAshim_Kumar_Roy1984111-8)//)
