I was reading about the life of Sambandar, a Shaivaite poet, who was one of the Nayanars.  
  
<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambandar>  
  
The wikipedia article says that according to Shaivaite legend, after Sambandar converted a king from Jainism to Shaivism, the king, with Sambandar's consent, impaled around 8000 jains.  
  
//According to a Saivite legend, Sambandar performed music for the king, which cured the king's disease. Later, Sambandar reconverted the king back to Shaivism.\[1\] The legend goes on to state that with Sambandar's consent, the king impaled around 8000 Jains//  
  
  
Given that this legend is that of Shaivaites (supposedly the oppressing party), has this legend been verified to be true? Do Jains have a similar legend of being victimized in this context?
