About this "legend", I found the following information from one of the references in wikipedia (please see attached) -

  

  

-   John E. Cort (1998).[*Open Boundaries: Jain Communities and
    Cultures in Indian
    History*](https://books.google.com/books?id=WWfnXbVWjKcC&pg=PA181).
    State University of New York
    Press.[ISBN](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number)[978-0-7914-9985-6](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-0-7914-9985-6).

The reference claims that there could have been an exodus of Jains from Madurai due to economic hardship or persecution *as indicated by a gap of about 600 years in the inscriptions at the Jain monasteric site in Madurai*.

  

This seems to give credence to the "legend".
