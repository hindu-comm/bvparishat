I found the following information on the net -

  

//Hiuen-Tsang, who visited India from 629 to 645 AD, describes the influence of a south Indian Brahmin queen on her husband who ordered the execution of many thousand Buddhists including 8,000 in Madurai alone. //  

  

The story and period corresponds to the impalement of Jains, except that in the story it is Buddhists who are at the receiving end. However, what I want to know is whether Hiuen-Tsang really wrote this. Members may kindly help.

  

  

PS: There is no need to get emotional or attribute ulterior motives. I just hope for a scholarly discussion.
