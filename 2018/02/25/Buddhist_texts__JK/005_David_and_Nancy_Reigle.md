Dear Sri Sudip Halder,  
  

Regarding Kumāralāta's Dṛṣṭānta-paṅkti, or Kalpanāmaṇḍitikā, as far as I know this Sanskrit text is only available in fragments. Most of these were published by Heinrich Lüders in his book, Bruchstücke der Kalpanāmaṇḍitikā des Kumāralāta, Leipzig: 1926. Sylvain Lévi then wrote an article in French regarding the authorship of this text, which was known from its Chinese translation as the Sūtrālaṅkāra by Aśvaghoṣa: "La Dṛṣṭānta-paṅkti et Son Auteur," published in Journal Asiatique, July-September 1927, pp. 95-127 (<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.78784>).  
  
These fragments and those discovered since have been input and posted at GRETIL here:

Best regards,
