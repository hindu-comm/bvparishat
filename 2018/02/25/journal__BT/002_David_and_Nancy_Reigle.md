Dear Sudip Halder,  
  

You can view this issue of this journal at the Hathi Trust site. It was digitized by Google, so it should be available on the Google site, but I could not find this volume there. Nor has it been uploaded to Archive.org. Only institutions can download the whole volume from the Hathi Trust site. Individuals can download single pages only. From your previous post, I assume that what you are looking for in this issue is the Ratnamālā. It can be viewed here:

Best regards,
