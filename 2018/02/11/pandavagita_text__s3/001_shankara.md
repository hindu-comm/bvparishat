Namaste,

  

This seems only a selection of verses from Pandava Gita. Pandava Gita published by Khemraj Srikrishnadas and Gita Press have 83 verses in them.

A manuscript of the Pandava Gita at the link given below, contains more than 100 verses. Its colophone attributes Pandavagita to Brahmanda Purana which is not mentioned in either Khemraj or Gita Press editions of the text.

shankara
