He liked to define maya as: maa = NOT & yaa + That

  

Maa is not NOT. yaa is not THAT.

  

Maa is something like mat in Hindi, used as a negation marker with imperative verbs.

  

e.g., मा कुरु धनजनयौवनगर्वं । in the same stotra quoted by you.

  

yaa is the streelinga form of यच्छब्द, meaning which/who.

  

So deriving"Something that is not changing is maaya", from

"maa = NOT & yaa + That"is wrong.

The discussion is on the definitions of Maayaa from an Advaita Vedanta point of view.

  

If you said, 'all the grammatical exercises, though they are direct quotes from Sankara himself, provide only the etymological meaning (yaugikaartha) and not the contextual connotational meaning (rooDhaartha) ', the point would have been well taken.

  

But bringing wrong etymologies as an alternative to well substantiated etymologies is not proper.
