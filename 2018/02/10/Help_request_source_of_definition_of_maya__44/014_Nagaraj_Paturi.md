Thanks Sriram, for reminding me this joke from your mentor who is my mentor too.

  

-------

  

Coming back to the serious side,

  

'maayaa' is a word not limited to Advaita Vedanta.

  

1\. It has its daily use, as a non-technical term, where it is used in the sense of illusion and is found in words like maayaavi, maayaayuddha

  

2\. It has its use in S'riti and other such sources respected by different schools of Vedanta. Each school interprets it as suited to it.

  

3\. Since it is S'ankara who is the authority for the Advaitic interpretation of the same, it is well in order to base Advaitic understanding on his own words.

  

Any 'Du krjn karaNe' (if it is viewed so ) is found in the thread, it is done by Sankara himself whose words 'Du krjn karaNe'are and are being quoted to make fun of the discussion in the thread.
