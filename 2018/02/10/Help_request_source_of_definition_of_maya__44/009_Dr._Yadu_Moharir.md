Dear List:

  

My teacher, Swami Rama: always use to say that often Sanskritists gramarrians keep making things more complicated than that need to be forgetting Acharya Shankars's wanring

  

*न हि न हि रक्षति* डुकृञ् करणे  

  

He liked to define maya as: maa = NOT & yaa + That

  

Something that is not changing is maaya.
