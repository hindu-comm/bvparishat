Respected vidvans,  
  

I came across two definitions of the word Maya while hearing lectures of Sri Visvatma Bawraji/Sri Maheshanand Giri. They are:  
  
1. वस्तुतः अविद्यामाना अपि विद्यमानवतयाति प्रतीति विषयतामिति माया I  
2. मीयते अनया सा माया I  
  
**Are these sentences from any of the upanishads or some other book? Or they can be attributed to these great souls only?**  
  

Sri Sankara says:  
  
मायां तु प्रकृतिं विद्यान्मायिनं तु महेश्वरम् in his Brahma Sutra Bhashya and also I came across the sentence प्रकृतिं स्वां मम वैष्णवीं मायां त्रिगुणात्मिकाम् , in his bhasya on Gita. **Do the above sentences substantially support the argument of Sankara or not, I am unable to comprehend completely.**  

  

  

Kindly enlighten and guide
