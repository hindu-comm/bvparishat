Respected Shri Subrahmanian-ji,

  

Thanks very much for your detailed reply. I was able to find the book 'Minor Works of Sadasiva Brahmendra' published by Sri Vani Vilas Press at<https://archive.org/details/MinorWorksOfSadasivendraSarasvatiPrakarananiVaniVilasPress> . As you mentioned, it does contain two works with the same title.

  

By God's grace, I was also able to find the translation of Atma Vidya Vilasam published by Kamakoti Kosasthanam, quoted in its entirety in The Mountain Path Magazine of Ramanashram (Link:<https://realization.org/down/mountain-path/46-2.2009-April.pdf>)

  

I have had no such luck thus far with Volume 1 of The Crest Jewel of Yogis. I shall eagerly await the same to be shared by you as and when possible.

  

Sincerely,

Divya
