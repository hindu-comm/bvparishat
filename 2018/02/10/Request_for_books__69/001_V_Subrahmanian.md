There is a publication by Sri Vani Vilas Press, Srirangam, of the past years, called 'Minor works of Sadashiva Brahmendra' containing several hymnal works including the above (1) cited by you. There are two works with the same title 'Atma Vidya Vilasam'. I have a xerox of that and if you do not find a pdf, I can scan and share the same privately.

I shall share the above privately. Alternatively you can download a most recent book 'The Multifaceted Jivanmukta' by the same author of the above book, which includes the above book in a very elaborated form:<https://www.sringeri.net/2017/11/17/affiliate-news/vidyatheertha-foundation/free-download-book-multifaceted-jivanmukta.htm>
