Suprabhat.

  

For the exact postal address of the Shankaracharya of the Karavi,that is,Kolhapur Peeth, you may contact Prof.A.Kru.Deshpande of Kolhapur,who is translating this book in Marathi.If you so wish,you may refer to my name and talk to him on 09271211505. He will guide you about the payment mode also.I purchased this book some years ago when I met the Shankaracharya in person and paid rs.180/- only at that time.

Best luck in your efforts .  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar
