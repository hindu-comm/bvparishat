Suprabhat.

  

This book can be purchased from the ashram of the Shankaracharya Math on the bank if the river Panchaganga in modern Kolhapur and is priced at rs.180/- only.

  

Really,a wonderful treatment.

  

It's Marathi translation with notes [etc.is](http://etc.is) being done by Prof.A.Kru.Deshpande,a devout devotee of Mahalaxmi from Kolhapur.Like other books,this one from the Vedavani Prakashan,will also be well received by scholars and devotees as well.
