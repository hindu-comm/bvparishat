with regds, the word may be structural one. a temple of any structure which is just like a ganda (onion ) in Panjabi or a round item. A number of Tibetan words including customs have migrated to Panjabi. Lohri has also a relation to Tibetan particularly saalu which was known as a festical ( of course not in a good sense) became Lohri in Panjab (earlier the song suggests that it was not a good custom and it was a festival of revenge). Its migration to Bodh Gaya cannot be ruled out. spnarang

Namaste,

  

It is Tibetan word for the Buddhist temple at Bodh Gaya, as per the footnote on page 149 of the following book.

  

<https://books.google.co.in/books?id=l3s9BAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA149&ots=ZbYf1UxCbc&dq=gandhola%20gaya&pg=PA149#v=onepage&q=gandhola%20gaya&f=false>  

  

"The word 'Gandhola' in Tibetan means the 'Pure House' and refers to the holy site of Buddha's enlightenment at Bodh Gaya."

regards  
shankara
