Namaste,

  

It is Tibetan word for the Buddhist temple at Bodh Gaya, as per the footnote on page 149 of the following book.

  

<https://books.google.co.in/books?id=l3s9BAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA149&ots=ZbYf1UxCbc&dq=gandhola%20gaya&pg=PA149#v=onepage&q=gandhola%20gaya&f=false>  

  

"The word 'Gandhola' in Tibetan means the 'Pure House' and refers to the holy site of Buddha's enlightenment at Bodh Gaya."

regards  
shankara
