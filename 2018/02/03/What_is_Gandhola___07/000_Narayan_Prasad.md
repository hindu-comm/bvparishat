Dear scholars,

  

  The Russian Indologist Ivan Minayev (1840-1890) wrote one article "V Bihare" (In Bihar) that was published in 1876. It deals with his memoirs of travel to Bihar (Biharsharif, Nalanda, Bargaon, Pawapuri, Giriyak, Gaya, Bodhgaya) in 1875. As far as I know, it has not yet been translated into English or any Indian language. The same article was incorporated in a book titled "Ocherki Tseilona i Indii" (Sketches of Ceylon and India) that was published in 1878.

  

   I am translating the above article into English and will complete it within a week. In the above book it is printed on pp.187-230.

  

   Regarding Bodhgaya temple Prof Minayev uses the term Gandhola. I am not aware of this term and request scholars to elucidate this term. The required Russian passage translated into English appears something like this:

  

"From whatever side you approach the Buddha-Gaya, it is not visible from afar: the famous Temple Gandhola catches your eye only when you are a few steps from it. Gandhola is a tall tower (160 ft), built in the form of a tetrahedral pyramid made of bluish-red brick; it stood in the middle of a vast courtyard and had several covered extensions on the east side, out of which only the pillars have now been preserved.".

  

  Best regards

  Narayan Prasad
