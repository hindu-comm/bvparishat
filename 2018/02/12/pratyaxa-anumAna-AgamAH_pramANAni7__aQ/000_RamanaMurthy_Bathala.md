Dear Sir,

From Yoga Sutras of Patanjali:

प्रत्यक्ष-अनुमान-आगमाः प्रमाणानि॥७॥

Direct perception, inference and competent evidence, are proofs.



First things first. What is knowledge? Anything we perceive (know) through our sense organs or through mind is knowledge.

This aphroism says there three sources of knowledge. प्रत्यक्ष-अनुमान-आगमाः

1.

**प्रत्यक्ष** **(Direct):** This is the knowledge acquired through our own five senses of knowledge (jnanedriyas) and mind.

  

2. **अनुमान** **(Inference):** This knowledge is acquired using our intellect based on previous प्रत्यक्ष (Direct) knowledge.

  

3. **आगमाः** **(Scriptures):** This is not knowledgewe acquired. It is the knowledge acquired by some other great personalities. They have written their knowledge in the books. Examples of scriptures are Vedas, Bhavadgita, Bible, Quran, Puranas, etc.

  

What happens if the knowledge acquired by the source प्रत्यक्ष (Direct) differ with the other two sources, namely, अनुमान (Inference) & आगमाः (Scriptures).

  

I have gone through a number of books of YS, but unfortunatelynot a single book, I have come across, has talked about this. So finally I posting here.

  

Let me explain my doubt clearly.

**Knowlde through Direct Sense Organs:** Suppose that I have acquired knowledge through sense organs that a particular object “XYZ” is black in colour.

**Knowlde through Inference:** And thorugh inferenec I concluded that the object “XYZ” is yellow in colour.

**Knowlde through Scriptures: **And some one in the scriptures mentioned that the object “XYZ” is white in colour.

 Now I have three different knowledge obout the same object “XYZ”, this knowledge being acquired through three different sources.

Which one is the correct knowledge--- through Direct or Inference or Scriptures?

Is the object black or yellow or white?

In the aphorism, “प्रत्यक्ष-अनुमान-आगमाः प्रमाणानि”, the source प्रत्यक्ष is mentioned first, hence by following this order, I should conclude that the object is “black”? Or should I give importance to scriputures and conclude that the object is “white?”. Which one.



Let me take the realistic & practical examples.



Example 1 : ब्रम्ह सत्यं जगन्मिथ्या

**Knowledge acquired through Direct Sense Organs (प्रत्यक्ष):** I am seeingthis word. I feel happy when I eat sweet. When hurt, I feel pain. So this world of names of forms exist. I am experiencingthis world. Existencethis world is true. I am not able perceive ब्रम्ह (God) through, at least, any one of the five senses of knowledge. So the God does not exist. So finally the knowledge acquired by प्रत्यक्ष (Direct): This world exists and God does not exists.



**Knowledge acquired through आगमाः (Scriptures**): The scriptureslike Vedanta, say that this world of names and forms does not exist. God only exist. It says “Your experience of this world is delusion. Look at the mirage. You can see water in the mirage. Your प्रत्यक्ष (Direct) knowledge says that there is water in the mirage. Does water really exist? No. Don’t you think that your Sense organs are fooling you? Cheating you? There is rainbow in the sky. This is your प्रत्यक्ष (Direct) knowledge. Does rainbow really exist? Can you go and catch it? No. So all the five Jnanedriyas are fooling you. Like water in the mirage, like rainbow, you are experiencingthis world even though this world does not exit. Believe me. I am scripture and ultimate authority. This world does not exist. Only God exist.” So the knowledge acquired by **आगमाः (Scriptures**): This world does not exist and God only exists.

Now I have two knowledge acquired through two different sources.

  

Knowledge 1: This world exists and God does not exists.

Knowledge 2: This world does not exist and God only exists.

  

Both are knowledges. But which one is correct? प्रत्यक्ष or आगमा?



Now one more example:

Example 2: Solar and Lunar eclipeses.



**Knowledge acquired through अनुमान (Inference):**

I do the follownig experiment in the lab;

Then I come to gain the followng knowledge that: During solar eclipse, moon comes in between sun and earth and in lunar eclipse, earth comes in between sun and moon.

****

**Knowledge acquired through अनुमान (Inference):**

When Rahu and Ketu swallows sun and moon, ecclipses are formed.



Now I have two knowleges:

Knowledge 1(acquired through Inference). Eclipses are formed due to astronomicalphenomena.

Knowledge 2 (acquired through Scriptures): Rahu and Ketu causes eclipses.

Both are knowledges. Both are obtained through valid sources. Which one is correct?



In the example 1, प्रत्यक्ष (Direct) contradicts आगमाः (Scriptures) and in the example 2, अनुमान (Inference)** **contradicts आगमाः (Scriptures)



Comments are solicited.
