Namaste Ramana Murthy ji,

  

Given that the fields of operation for scriptures as a pramANa and other two are different, there is no real comparison possible. Yet, with the example of the reality of the world proven by direct perception/ experience and inference too, the unreality of the same can be known only through the scriptures. The idea that what scriptures say is doubtful is similar to an illiterate finding science doubtful. The scientific results such as observation under a microscope or through a telescope areobjective knowledge verifiable in a lab, so would a scientific mind say. Now, what is not visible to the naked eye is replaced by such knowledge, meaning pratyakSha is contradicted. Yet, how did the masses learn that something can be seen under the microscope/ through a telescope? Through the "scientific scriptures" made by someone who had subjective knowledge and made it objective by giving a process to others.What is e=mc^2 to mean for one who knows just about basic science otherwise! Similarly, what is verifiable to one after following shabda is available in a process for karma, upAsana or jnAna, verifiable for others. I particularly do not think there is a difference in trust in scientific findings pending verification oneself and shraddhA in shAstras pending verification.  
  

As for the example of eclipse, AFAIK no oneclaims that Rahu and Ketu swallowing up the sun or moon as being real. It is mythology leading to alaukika upAya for protecting against alaukika effects of eclipse. The entire Veda karmakANDa is alaukika approach to laukika or pAralaukika phala. That being the case, it cannot be proven to be illogical either, although it is not logical, since it is a-logical. If one says that the eclipse is due to astronomic phenomena and another questions why such phenomena and gravity and so on, one will have to state in the end "thats how it is". This very "thats how it is" is stated in a story that Rahu and Ketu make the phenomena happen! Ridiculous, but thats as far as our reach is. Whys are left equally unanswered in the end. For one, gravity or advanced science is a satisfying answer to move on and for another the shadow deities!

  

Finally, what is really pratyakSha is one's own self, everything else is questionable. No inference or scripture can prove that you do not exist or need tell you that you are conscious. Everything else is as real as is a dream during the dream. This is what the scriptures state and thereby reveal it to be mithyA. Only one who has followed through to culmination can state it to be true or false. And there are people who have confirmed the same in what is called as vidvadanubhava. The set may be small, but it still objective, open to verification by the means prescribed not by other tools.
