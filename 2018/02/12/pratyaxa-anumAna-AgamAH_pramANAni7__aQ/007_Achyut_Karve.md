Kindly be on the look out on whether one has not missed out the previous sutra namely "Sutra 1.5  vrittayah pangchatayyah klishta aklishtah" or even the ones previous to that. The words  " klishta aklishtah" warns the practioner not to jump to conclusions. Single quotes from works such as the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali may lead one into confusion.
