Pratyaksha is preferable to anumaana except in a few cases like alaatacakra (firebrand, which when rotated gives the impression of a circle of fire being there, whereas there is only a single firebrand) and aadityagati (can't see the motion of Sun, though it does move). Anumaana is based on Pratyaksha (vyaaptijnaana) and should be used when Pratyaksha is not tenable.

  

Each of these domains have their own vishaya. That which can be known through perception or inference should be only through those. Those which cannot be known through these two should be known through Sruti. Example: existence of svarga and apsarasas.

  

The above can be found in Sankhya kaarikas. In Sankhya, Pradhana is the subject matter of inference. Eight cases where Perception does not work (अतिसौक्ष्म्यात् अतिदूरात् etc.) are also discussed.

  

In Vedanta, Brahman is the subject matter of Sruti alone. In Advaita, the experience of Brahman can reinforce the same but the order is fixed: we know that Brahman exitsts because Sruti says so and not because somebody feels that he or she is the world and Sruti supports that experience. Why? Because then we don't know whether the experience of a jnaani is valid or that of a mad man, or somebody high from smoking Punjab's finest.
