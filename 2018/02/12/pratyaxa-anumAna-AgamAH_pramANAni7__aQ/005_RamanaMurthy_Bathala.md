Dear Sir,

Salutations !!!

  

I beg to differ with some explanations in the mail.

  

**1) Your comment: **

“ *Classic illustrations of how missing ‘Yoga’- Nirvachana’ paddhati of Samskrutha Shabda ‘ has affected the understanding of the texts of tradition. On the top of which one can add errors due to (a) Translation –Meaning Mapping errors and (b) Motives in using lens of theology to interpret Vedic Tradition and (c ) absurdities in observed practices with multiple-layers of corrupted understanding* “

**My comment**: Most of the material I have posted, including the translation” is based on the book “Meditation As Spiritual Culmination- Yoga Aphorisms Of Patanjali- Raja Yoga Lectures By Swamy Sarvagatananda 1977 To 1981 – Volume One” Pages 58-66.

  

Here is the link to the book.

2) **Your comment:**

*\<प्रत्यक्ष-अनुमान-आगमाःप्रमाणानि॥७॥ -Direct perception, inference and competent evidence, are proofs.> The current translations and explanations / practices do not touch upon this range of Yoga practice guidance. *….

In fact this is the translation given by Swamy Vivekananda in His book on “Patanjali Yoga Sutras Commentary by Swamy Vivekananda”

Here is the screenshot from the book by Swamy Vivekananda.

3) **Your comment:**

* In Yoga-Sutra, the term \< प्रत्यक्ष\> is NOT limited to \< Direct perception \> based on ‘Senses ( Indriya –Vishaya – grahana/ again narrowed down to eyes ( =drushta) and ears ( =shruta))’.*

* The sutra also covers ‘ Buddhi based perception’ and ‘ Attendriaya darshana’ also*.

**  
**

**My comment:** All the books I have referred says प्रत्यक्ष is the knowledge by sense organs of knowledge.

**Buddhi based perception.** Buddhi changes over a period of time and maturity. Then perception also should change. The buddhi (intellect) I had in my boyhood is not same as that I have. So as buddhi changes, the knowledge also changes. Hence the color of the XYZ may change from black to blue as buddhi changes.

**  
**

**Ateendriaya darshana.** I accept there is Ateendriaya knowledge (parapsychology). But whether this अतींद्रिय knowledge comes under प्रमाण knowledge is debatable. If comes under प्रमाण knowledge, then which category – प्रत्यक्ष orअनुमान or आगमा?

  

And finally, the प्रत्यक्ष need not be confined to just eyes and ears. It can be extended to all the 5 sense organs of knowledge. For the purpose of brevity, only two are taken.
