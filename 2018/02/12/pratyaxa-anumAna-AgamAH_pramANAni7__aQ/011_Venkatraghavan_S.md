Namaste,

  

In short, we cannot generalise and say one pramANa is always stronger, everywhere. Each perceived contradiction between pramANas needs to be individually tested to determine whether a contradiction really exists and if it does, which pramANa is valid. In general, parIkshita pramANa (one that has been examined) will be stronger than aparIkshita pramANa. The test for the validity of a pramANa in any instance will vary - presence of tAtparya linga, support from other pramANas, its confirmation through vyavahAra, absence of subsequent contradiction etc.

  

Regards,

Venkatraghavan
