I think in the sutras on Vruttis Patanjali is talking of the sources of knowledge in general i.e at the highest level of abstraction. These vruttis get illumined when the Drastha is enseated in his own place for which one needs to practice Chitta vrutti nirodh which in essence is Yoga.

  

It not correct to use these vruttis as tools to further knowledge. Such use of these vruttis may lead to Vastusa prayoga meaning applying tools non sensuously.
