Dear sir,

  

Pranams. Let us explore the aphorism शब्दज्ञानानुपाती वस्तुशून्यो विकल्पः॥९॥

  

 Let us start from the literal meaning of it.

शब्द-ज्ञान- अनुपाती वस्तु-शून्यः विकल्पः॥९॥

**Translation 1: Conceptualization is the result of words and ideas, empty of object.**

****

**Translation 2: Verbal delusion follows from words having no corresponding reality.**

**My interpretation: **

We all know that sound is produced by an object, either with life (man, animal, etc) or without life (fan, radio, TV, mobile). We hear it with our ear which is one of the five organs of knowledge (Jnanedriyas).

  

We are hearing means we are getting some knowledge. What if we hear even though there is no object. In other words, what if get knowledge even though the object does not exist? This is the question this aphorism deals with.

Let us see graphically how we get knowledge. (courtesy: Internet)

[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MaUHVNzMYdU/WoU6r1M4mMI/AAAAAAAACBk/IXUwB2QmrvYF7l4BgDyMWyI8YQ-gfNs5wCLcBGAs/s1600/3.png)](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MaUHVNzMYdU/WoU6r1M4mMI/AAAAAAAACBk/IXUwB2QmrvYF7l4BgDyMWyI8YQ-gfNs5wCLcBGAs/s1600/3.png)

  

  

There are external object. The sense organs pass information to the manas. The vrittis are formed in the manas. We get the knowledge about object.

 This aphorism deals with hearing sense organ (ear). What if sensory organ (ear) passing information to the manas even though there is no object in the external world? Since information is coming from sense organ (ear), manas accepts that as true and cognizes and forms vrittis or knowledge. This vritti is called Vikalpa vritti. This Vikalpa word is limited only to sense organ of hearing (ear).



Let us come to the aphorism

शब्द-ज्ञान- अनुपाती वस्तु-शून्यः विकल्पः॥९॥

वस्तु-शून्यः –There is no object, either with life or without life.

शब्द-ज्ञान – We are getting Vrittis (knowledge- ज्ञान) in the mind(Manas) through the sound heard by our ears.

  

Vrittis are generated in the mind, because sound is heard through ears but there is no Vastu or object (वस्तु-शून्यः) which produced that sound. The Vrittis thus which are formed in the mind in this way are called Vikalpa (विकल्प) Vrittis by Patanjali. In other words, Vikalpa knowledge or Vrittis do not have external source of generation.

Let us take an example. I am walking in a deserted place. No other person can be seen in the horizon. Suddenly I heard someone calling me. I turn back and see who was calling. No one was seen. That means वस्तु-शून्यः (no object). But I heard my name being called. When I heard my name being called, Vrittis are formed in my mind. Those Vrittis are called Vikalpa Vrittis. Actually no one called me. I heard the sound.

Some time we read in the books, आकाशवाणि speaking from the sky. (Here आकाशवाणि is not radio!!!). Is there any object which produced this sound? No. If there is really an object which produced this sound, what are its properties like shape, weight, color, whether it is with life or without life? As for my understanding as seen in movies and as read in books, there is no object (वस्तु-शून्यः)

  

Let me take one more example. I am afraid I may face criticism with the followig explantion.

Vedas or Srutis: The following is definition of श्रुति.

  

  

[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2y5iHcBKoy8/WoU6_mZ6-SI/AAAAAAAACBo/A2DFyriqqTgMEV1PtsVdEekUWYel_ujdgCLcBGAs/s1600/sruti-wiki.jpg)](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2y5iHcBKoy8/WoU6_mZ6-SI/AAAAAAAACBo/A2DFyriqqTgMEV1PtsVdEekUWYel_ujdgCLcBGAs/s1600/sruti-wiki.jpg)

  

श्रुति means “that which is heard”.

Who heard?

Ancient Rishis /saints.

Was there any object which said that?

  

This is the question that is interesting. If there is an object (with or without life) then the knowledge got by Rishis is प्रत्यक्ष knowledge. And this knowledge documented in the Veda books becomes आगम (प्रमाण) knowledge.

  

What if there is no object which produced the sound heard by Rishis? Then, if we follow Patanjali definition given in this aphorism, it becomes Vikalpa knowledge . And this knowledge documented in Veda books again becomes आगम (प्रमाण) knowledge.



**Further Analysis: **

The natural question is why Patanjali confined this Vikalpa knowledge only to hearing, not to other things like seeing, smelling, touching, and tasting?

  

Let me remove the word शब्द from the Aphorism.

ज्ञानानुपाती वस्तुशून्यो विकल्पः॥९॥

  

If we translate: “The knowledge obtained without existence of the object is called Vikalpa knowledge”

  

Now take the case of water in the mirage.

Since we are able see the water with eyes, it should be classifed as प्रत्यक्ष (प्रमाण) knowledge.

Since there no water (वस्तु-शून्यः) it has to be classifed as Vikalpa knowledge.

So which is correct: प्रत्यक्ष or विकल्प?

  

I am not saying my understanding this aphorism is correct. After reading books and hearing through various sources, I assimilated this. I am open to change it if someone convinces me.
