These are broad principles of testimony. Each of them has its own field of application. If your inference of the colour of an object tells you something different from perception you might as well lay the blame on the sense organ itself. Anumana in Nyaya has a five membered syllogistic formulation and in general when applied to the example in question will lead to the conclusion. Navya Nyaya has dealt with some of these pratyaksa questions and comes to some interesting conclusions. As for sabda it is to be used only in such instances when there is no other way of gaining knowledge about it as in the case of 'dharma' for instance. Every branch of knowledge has its own vocabulary and method of application and śāstra also has laid down certain broad guidelines.
