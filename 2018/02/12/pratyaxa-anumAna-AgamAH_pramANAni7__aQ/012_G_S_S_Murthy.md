It is my understanding that pratyaksha, anumaan and aapta vaakya are equally relevant in the quest for "truth" undertaken by science. Here what we learn

In text books without going through the strenuous steps of observations and reasoning is "aaptavaakya". Science does not look for absolute truth. " Truth" in science is that which explains maximum of observations with minimum of assumptions. Science builds models to explain observations and every model or theory may become "false" by discovery of new or more accurate observations which cannot be explained by the theory.

At the first level of observation, sun and stars go round the earth. But accurate observation s of apparent movements of sun,planets and stars lead us to heliocentric theory.

Pratyaksha alone is not pramaan. Pratyaksha and anumaan together lead us to more and more refined Truth ( A hierarchy of aapaata satya).

Murthy
