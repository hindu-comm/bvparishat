Dear Members,

  

Just to use multi-file search don't buy MAC BOOKS. It is also possible through Windows as well by installing "Sublime". With this application, you can also write your coding etc. Especially it is for Programs, recently I have tried to search text files. It's working properly.

  

SUBLIME:

*Sublime*Text is a super fast and feature packed text and development editor. If you are going to be coding regularly you want to try this amazing editor (IDE).  

  

How to Do it?

  

After installing the sublime: Mostly we have all the "e-texts" together in a folder. If not place them in a folder. Then open the particular folder in sublime.

  

In Sublime: --> Go File: --> Select the particular folder (which you placed all the e-texts): My folder name: "Dr Jim Hathayoga" appearing in Image-1

Then press: Ctrl+ Shift + F (Image - 2)

Type the word the which you want to search in "Find" and press Find button.

Here I am using the word "Haá¹­hayoga" find in different e-texts:

You can observe the findings in different e-texts.

  

Thank you
