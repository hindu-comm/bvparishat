Namaste,  
  

I'm in the process of making small calendar for kids that includes regular information like tithis, months, seasons etc. and as an element to give fuel to their curiosity it mentions the names of the larger units of *current* time as per the shastra (i.e. kalpa & yuga), that under normal circumstances they are not introduced to.  
  
There is umpteen information regarding these timeless cycles of the time and things like overlapping of Yugas, and sandhya or samdhi kal at the end of each Yuga, etc. but that is beyond the scope of my current requirement and thus discussion. Also note that the calendar is in perpetual form so it is upto the user of the calendar to set a particular day/month, thus discussions about when the specific thithi falls is of not much value here.  
  
The requirement is to present basic information like current month and year in a simpler way. I've listed these bigger units of time as per my little understanding, and expect some one to validate or point to any mistakes so that I mention only correct information on the toy calendar.  
  

51st Kalpa, Shveta-Varaha Kalpa, (Brahma's 51st day)  

7th Manvantara, Vaivasvatha or Sraddhadeva  

28th Mahayuga  

Kali Yuga  
  

५१ कल्प, श्वेतवराह  
७ मन्वन्तर, वैवस्वत or श्राद्धदेव  

२८ महायुग

कलियुग  
  

Dhanyoshmi,  

Sunil
