Sri Madhvaji,  
  

I hope you are asking about aesthetic designing and not about the design calculation of panchang.  

  
So for designing I use [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) that is very easy and capable Open-source software at par with that of CoreDraw and Adobe Illustrator, I'm comparing them from illustration point of view for Laser Cutting applications.  
  

It's already been designed and almost ready for the final cut, but then I thought to include little homework for bit senior kids thus introducing bigger units of time (yuga, kalpa, etc) as mentioned into the original post.  
  

Dhanyoshmi,  

Sunil
