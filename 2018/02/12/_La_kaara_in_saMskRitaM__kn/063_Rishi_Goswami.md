With due respect to all schollars and Karveji, I think it is not necessary for 2 aksharas to be Savarnas for having abhed between them.  
For eg, when we say ralayorabhedah, one is murdhanya while the other is dantavya, still, they are replaced by each other in many instances. For eg, Raghu and Laghu.  
Similarly, va and ba are replaced by each other when they are not Savarnas, even their talvadisthan is different. Va is dantoshtha and Ba is Oshtha. The eg, here is Suvahu and Subahu, I have seen many examples as such.  
  
If we say that Pratishakyas state that !a(I am writing ळ् as ! in english as I don't have the font). !a and !ha can be replaced by da and dha, that doesn't mean they should have the same talvadisthan and abhyantar-prayatnas, not necessary for them to be svaras also.  
  
For concluding ! and !ha as a svara or a vyanjana, I wont say anything. But we can certainly find out by counting Matras or aksharas in various chhandas, for if it is a swara, it can be considered as "laghu" like मसृण is नगण for all 3 are laghu. It can be a vyanjana if the sanyoga-poorva-varna is a guru. I don't think there is any other way to find out it's achtva or haltva.  
  
I don't understand Marathi. What was the part where Karveji mentioned that they can be used in Lan-sootram? According to his research, ! Is used in rilri(!)k maaheshwar sootra. So does Karveji, mean to say it can't be antarbhoot in Lan-sootram?  
  
Thankyou  
Regards  
Rishi.
