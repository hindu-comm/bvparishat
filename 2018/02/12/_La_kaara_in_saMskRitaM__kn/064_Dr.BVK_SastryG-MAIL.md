Namaste

1. Savarna is NOT decided by thinking ! Savarna is decided by IDENTIFYING the ' Sthana-Prayatna Saamya'.

2. The replacement or substitution of \<ra - la replaced by each other in many instances\> is technically called ' Apa-Shabdita'. The process of uccharana and shravana shows the clear independent nature of the two phonemic units. The ' acceptance of slack pronunciation' and 'technical replacement in Vyakarana Process' are independent issues. Slack pronunciation is user fault. Technical replacement is a rule convention.

On \< Raghu and Laghu \> see how meaning changes by substitution and process in \[Raghu-Vamsha and Laghu -Vamsha\] ; \<Raghu-- Raaghava and Laghu-- Laaghava>

For further contemplation please.
