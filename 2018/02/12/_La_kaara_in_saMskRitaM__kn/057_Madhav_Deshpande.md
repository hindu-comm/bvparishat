Dear Shri Karve,

  

  Some of your statements are factually incorrect. In Vedic texts, depending upon the Śākhā, ळ combines with ह yielding ळ्ह, for instance गूढ becomes गूळ्ह. In languages like Marathi, ळ combines with other consonants, i.e. ळ्य. Your statement "As per my understandingड and ढ cannot be voiced retroflexively in the said words." makes little sense in terms of known phonetics of this sound. Depending upon the Veda Śākhā, we can have ईडे or ईळे. The Śākhā readings provide something like dialectal variation in Vedic Sanskrit.
