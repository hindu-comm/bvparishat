Nagaraj ji,

This retro La is common in Rajasthan as well, again, common rural folks.

But both La and la are in use, not exclusive La. But a word that is said with La is NOT said also with la.

  

E.g.

bALa = hair; to burn

bAla = as in bAlakANDa, but not used alone as bAla, that would be a chhoro, TAbar (child or children), tingar (toddler)

kALa = death, end time, Yamaraj

kAla = tomorrow, kal of Hindi

kALoo = name of a person, as in Kaliya of Sholay

loddo = the head, back of the head, skull

roLA = ruckus, shouting,

moLi = the red sacred thread we tie on wrist

  

Etc.

None of these words will carry a meaning or the same meaning if La was replaced with la.

  
  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
