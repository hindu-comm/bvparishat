Dr. Śāstry ji,  
  
On Raghu vs. Laghu - meaning does not change because of the use of l or r, but simply due to convention and dialectal variation.

  

Before sanskrit was standardized by Pāṇini, there were certain spoken dialects that used laghu and certain others which used raghu (to mean the same/similar things), and that is how we have inherited both these words in standard sanskrit.  
  
In standard sanskrit we use these words with slightly different meanings because sanskrit is not spoken in multiple dialects today (like it once was) - so there is no need to use both raghu and laghu with identical meanings.  
  
Regards,  
Ram
