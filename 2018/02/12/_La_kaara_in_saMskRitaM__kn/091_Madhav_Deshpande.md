Shri Anand Hudli's observations based on the Vājasaneyi-Prātiśākhya are important. According to this Prātiśākhya, while the Kāṇva Śākhā has the sounds ळ, ळ्ह, Jihvāmūlīya, Upadhmānīya and Nāsikya, the Mādhyandina Śākhā does not have them. In modern times, while the Kāṇva Śākhā is found in the south, the Mādhyandina Śākhā is generally found in the north, including the northern Maharashtra. It is not clear if the difference in the phonologies of the Śākhās began already in north India, before the Kāṇva Śākhā was transmitted to the south, or whether these differences arose as a consequence of the geographical bifurcation of the Śukla Yajurveda. This needs a substantially deeper historical study of these traditions and their transmission. With best wishes,
