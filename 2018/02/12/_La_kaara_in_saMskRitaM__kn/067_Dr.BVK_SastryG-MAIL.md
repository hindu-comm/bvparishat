Namaste Ramakrishna



1. On \< On Raghu vs. Laghu - meaning does not change because of the use of l or r, but simply due to convention and dialectal variation.
\> 



It seems that my teachers of Samskrutham and Your Teachers of Samskrutham follow different rule books and resources. 



May I know which illustrious school and tradition of Samskruth Paninian / Indology studies is championing this model of ‘ Samskrutha – Pada –artha Nirvachana’ ?

Seems there is a need to revisit the fundamentals of the definition: What makes a Samskrutha Shabda/ Padam ? Sup-ting antam OR slack usage ?



2. On \< that is how we have inherited both these words in standard sanskrit. \> 



What is Standard and Non-Standard Sanskrit ? What I have been taught is there are two categories : Chandas and Bhahsaa . Chandas is ‘ Darshana’ (Transcendental Vision / Shruta – Shruti in Tradition; Pre- Paninian, archaic in modern Academic )



Which ever root you go, Raghu is NOT the same as Laghu : by meaning or usage or articulation. If this is to be taken as a dialectical variation, how may I be sure that your name will still be the same by ra-la change ?

Rama - is NOT the same as ‘Lama ’ ?? would it be a dialectic variation ??



3. On \< sanskrit is not spoken in multiple dialects today (like it once was) - so there is no need to use both raghu and laghu with identical meanings. \>



 I am not able to understand this statement. Please help me understand on what you mean by \< Sanskrit- multiple dialects - like it once was… ?? \>

We cannot be oblivious to the fact the by changing ra to la it also effects/changes the point of articulation of ghu. Thus the akruti of both the words differ conventionally though they may attract the same or slightly different meanings.
