Dear Scholars,

  

The position I am taking and the questions I am putting out are based on my experience while studying the literature of the tabla.

  

This literature evolved in a course of about 300 years in the plains of western Uttar Pradesh.

  

It evolved in small isolated Muslim communities as an art form and yet reflects the uniqueness of Sanskrit phonation.

  

The literature that I now have at hand reflects the process of phoneticrefinements that art forms undergo in the process of evolution before they can be captured in the form of certain phonetic rules.

  

I believe that Sanskrit whether Vedic or laukik also must have gone through such stages before it could be presented in the form of rules. 

  

Such an effort i.e formulation of rules becomes necessary only when the unique form that has evolved is exposed to the possibility of total annihilation. I have heard performing artists of the day express that their arts would die with their death.

  

In the circumstances to treat the Ashtadhyayi merely as a rule book at par with contemporary grammar may do more damage than good to the subject. 

  

The Ashtadhyayi in my opinion should be dealt with or interpreted more as a book on Sanskrit aesthetic rather that just a book on grammar.
This will avoid mechanistic interpretation and help in reproducing if I may say daivi vak.

  

Any grammar of a language starts with instruction of the alphabet. That is precisely what Panini has done in the Maheshwar Sutras. One should not however forget that they have not been presented as discreet individual letters but as Sutras which have an aesthetic form. That they also serve the purpose of anubandhas shows Panini's ability to compose. 

  

By putting Panini's work to the rigour or Western Logic will do no good to the purpose of understanding Panini's ideation of the then existing unique form that Sanskrit took as a language.  

  

Where can modern grammarians reach if they believe that Panini's articulation of the alphabet was the same as theirs? Foisting western phonetic standards on Panini is debasing the very heart of the subject. It is no wonder therefore that scholars find the subject becoming more confusing than it was before, creating more differences of opinion on account of the different tongues that each scholar speaks.

  

It would be better if scholars start doubting their own tongues and bring them in line with the instruction of the Maheshwar Sutras rather than doubting the rules of the Ashtadhyayi.

  

Such type of effort of ordering all the letters into sutra form is I thing not available even in the pratishakhyas. It is for this reason I believe that the Ashtadhyayi is a work far beyond that of the Pratishakhyas.

  

  

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve
