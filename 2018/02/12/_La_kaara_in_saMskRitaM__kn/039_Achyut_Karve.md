Is there any word whether vedic or otherwise where ळ comes either at the beginning or in the middle?

  

If not if it only appears at the end of a word how can the Pratyayas be suffixed for the word to be capable of conveying meaning. This in the light of my previous comment that one cannot suffix a vowel or a consonant to ळ This might be another possible reason for not including ळ in the Maheshwar sutras.
