Dear Shri Balasubramanian Ramakrishnan,

  

  I am so glad you brought up the issue of Kāṭhaka sections in the Taittirīya tradition. While they contain ळ in the place of intervocalic ड, it is important to note that the Kāṭhaka-Saṃhitā retains the intervocalic ड and does not change it to ळ, as you can see from the following extract:

  This probably suggests that as some Kāṭhaka passages were incorporated into the Taittirīya corpus, they were phonetically assimilated with the norm of the Taittirīya tradition. Thus, the presence and absence of ड and ळ is a matter of a specific Śākhā tradition, and ultimately relates to different dialects in which the Śākhās were transmitted.
