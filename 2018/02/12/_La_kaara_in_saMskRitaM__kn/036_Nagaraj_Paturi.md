Venkatesh Murthy-ji,

  

In Tamil , retroflex L is pronounced by common rural rustic speakers of the language. So generalising that only educated pronounce retroflex L , is not tenable.

  

In Kannada too retroflex L has a phoneme status , i.e., the status of a distinct sound causing difference in meaning. huLi = sour / a liquid dish ; huli = tiger.

  

In Telugu , we have minimal pairs such as kala = dream kaLa = art.

  

Interestingly, kaLa = art is a Sanskrit borrowing. But you know that it is kalaa.

  

So retroflex L is typically south Indian.

  

If Panini not accommodating retroflex L in his Maahes'wara sutras, is to be accrpted as a limitation of his coverage of Sanskrit phonemes, that should be proved by showing the phonemic status of retroflex L in Sanskrit.

  

kaaLa does not help this purpose becsuse kaala is used in Sanskrit where kaaLa is used.

  

But even when the phonemic status of L is proved it does not support any conspiracy theory.
