Thank you, Shri Venkat Sriram, for pointing out that ळ also occurs in the Taittirīya texts. My point was simply to say that ळ occurs only in some of the Vedic Śākhās and not universally. As far as I know, the only word where it occurs at the end of a word is बाळ् in बाळिति in the Atharvaveda Saṃhitā.
