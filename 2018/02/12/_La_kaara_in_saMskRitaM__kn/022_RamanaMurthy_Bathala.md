Dear Sir,



The following is from Telugu Grammar by CP Brown.

The following is from Monier-Williams.

The following is from WHITNEY

Is the telugu letter ళ is same as sanskrit ळ ḷa?

How come? The telugu ళ pronounciation is similar to ల ल la in Telugu.

But sanskrit ळ ḷa changes to ड or ढ instead of to ल la?

There is a bit of confusion here.

One more thing is there is ఱ called బండిర or శకట రేఫ (शकट रेफ) . I have not seen this letter either in Vedic sanskrit alphabet nor in classic sanskrit alphabet. Does this exists in other south Indian Dravidian languages like Tamil. Kannada? Here is the screen shot from Telugu Grammar by CP Brown.

Did Panini left over this letter also?

  

When I was studying elementary classes, I used to see the letters ళ ळ ḷa and ఱ. Now I can hardly see them in text books or newspapers.

  

Once I asked my teacher like this. Sir, the letters are called अक्षरs , which means they do not have क्षर (diminishing / destruction). Now these two letters are vanished / diminished in usage. How can we call them अक्षरs ? I did not get any convincing reply.

  

Regards

Ramana murthy
