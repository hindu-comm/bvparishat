**The retroflex**ळ **½ is an allophone of · occurring in intervocalic position. In NIA languages in intervocalic position it usually occurs as the trilled QÌÍ. P¡¸ini does not mention all the allophones. The nasals are all mentioned including allophones; cf. *mo**’**nusv¡raÅ* and the *jhal¡Æ ja¿* rule. But one is left to find out which d is a phone as in *deva* and which an allophone as in sadbhiÅ (\<sat). **
