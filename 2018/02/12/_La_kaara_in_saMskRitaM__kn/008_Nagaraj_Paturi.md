Banishing means saying " it is not allowed to be used"

  

Panini never says anything like that anywhere in his book.

  

The siddhi of a word which includes ळ can not be achieved through Panini's sutras, since the phone is not included in the Maahes'wara sutras. This can at the most be called a limitation of Panini's AshTaadhyaayee.

  

If it can be shown that post-Paninian authors stopped using ळ on account of the phone not being included in the Maahes'wara sutras, then it can be said that Panini's AshTaadhyaayee had a 'banishing effect' with regard to this phone though it did not have a banishing statement in it.

  

For this 'banishing effect ' to be proved, details of pre-Paninian and post-Paninian usages in Laukika Samskrita are to be systematically provided. If there is a clear pattern of abundant or even rare use in pre-Paninian times and sudden disappearance after Panini , then there is a scope to attribute the pattern to "banishing effect"
