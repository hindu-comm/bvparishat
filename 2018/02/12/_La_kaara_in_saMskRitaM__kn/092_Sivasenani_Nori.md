प्रणम्य विद्वांसः समर्प्यते।

  

Veda influences laukikavyavahaara, not the other way round. Otherwise there ought to be no mahaapraaNas in the Vedic recensions popular in South India. At the very least, the wide spread omission of mahaapraaNas in daily usage must have resulted in at least one Vedic word where the alternative form has an alpapraaNa. No such changes are found. On the other hand, we find usages such as yaddevaa (now popular as eddevaa) meaning avaheLanam in Telugu, resulting from Vedic texts like यद्देवा देवहेळनं कुर्वन्ति।
