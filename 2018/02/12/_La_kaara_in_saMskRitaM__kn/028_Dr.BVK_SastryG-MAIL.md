Namaste



Do we know what makes the basic ‘ varna- akshara –samooha’ of Samskrutham? Is ळ a part of it or Not ?



The debate seems to be using some dangerous suggestions, needing review.



1. The Vedic Sukta ‘ where one gets the sound unit ‘ ळि’ is still alive in usage; and existed prior to Panini. The deliberated kind of phonetic shift \< In Veda, " ळ " kaara replaces 'ड' kara and not lakaara as in Dravidian languages. > has not taken place till date either in the textual tradition or ‘spoken vedic’ or ‘ dravidian langauge influenced segment of Vedic lore’ ( in Kerala/ Tamil Nadu or else where).



If any one has heard / endorsed / modified the use of बळित्था with any of the variations incorporated , noted above , i would be obliged .



2. The new phonemic variant - ऴ ( ऴ - unicode 0933 with Nukta – listed as a separate Character ) - in Unicode and NEW DEVANAGARI SCRIPT post 1970 in Digital media needs a traditional Paninian perspective analysis . And this extends to several new script symbols incorporated in Unicode for which Samkrutha Varna-maalaa teaching seems to be still not ready.



3. If Vedic akshara-samooha had \< ळ and its combines and conjuncts \>, If post Paninian Non-Samskruth /Dravidian languages carry the \< ळ and its combines and conjuncts \> and current documents of Vedic Samskruthamstill carries \< ळ and its combines and conjuncts> in the live tradiiton, What might be the reason for Panini NOT to list it in Shiva-Sutras or consider for Pratyaharas OR for Sutras ( and pushing this ळ sound to Dhatu –Patha / anubandhas) needs to be explored. Panini must have had a good reason for doing this, if he was so careful to wrok with the nearest similar sounds ‘ ॡ लृ’.



4. This also opens up an interesting and critical debate : How authentic would be the claim of Schoalrs of Vedic tradiiton claiming ‘total rigidity / staticness/ invariance’ of the ‘ Sounds and structures of Veda’ to the last limit of ‘ even a single swara’ ? Dont we find the phonetic unit ‘ळ’ in Vedas ? If this phonemic unit is postualted as a ‘ part of Vedic voiced document’, then why we dont have a conssitent tradiitonal posiiton on what this sound unit should be ? What would be the ‘Veda –Lakshana’ for this unit with all the 33 or 64 descriptors ?
Why only Mantra shaastra holds on to this phonetic unit ळ ? And from where the so called Prakruts and Dravidian langauges invented or improvised on their ‘akshara- samooha’ and made it a part of several words ? If Shiva is considered as a ‘Dravidian God’, why was he averse to part with ‘ ळ’ to ‘Vedic tradition rule maker Panini in Shiva-sutras ? and confine it only to ‘ Tamil’ where the last sound is ळ्’ ??
