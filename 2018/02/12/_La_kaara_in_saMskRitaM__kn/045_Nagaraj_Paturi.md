No usage is 'wrong'.  

  

The whole point is whether it is considered as part of the standard version of Sanskrit or not.

  

How is the 'standard' version decided?

  

On the basis of whether the lakshaNa work covers it or not?

  

or

  

On the basis of whether the lakshyas from s'iShTas include it or not?

  

If the books in laukika Samskrita with a date establishing that Panini knows the work prove that L was used by the stage, Panini can be found fault for not covering the corpus adequately.

  

If the books in laukika Samskrita with a date establishing that Panini knows the work prove that L was not used by the stage, Panini can not be found fault for not covering the corpus adequately.

  

If the books in laukika Samskrita with a date later to Panini have L,
Panini can not be found fault for not covering the corpus adequately.
