This is an excerpt from my book Unveiling the Atlantis of Sanskrit Phonology.

  

"In the case of ऋ, लृ and ळ, they do not modulate to the points of the consonants, as is the case with अ, इ and उ. There is a difference between ऋ, लृ and ळ. ळ can be voiced only if it is prefixed with any one of the अच्s. It is never suffixed by or conjoined with the अच्s. Wherever they do occur, they have to be disjoined from ळ. Thus, अग्निमीळे will be voiced as अग्निमि+इळ+ए and कमळ will be voiced as कम्+अळ. The ऋ, लृ. र and ल will not be retroflex in voicing कमऋ कमलृ कमर and कमल, i.e., the sub-apical part of the tongue will not touch the pre-palatal at 6 or 7 while voicing कमर and कमल, where as the ळ will be retroflex while voicing ळ in कमळ. ळ therefore is not a variant of ड़ as is commonly believed. ळ is a posterior variant of लृ beyond ण. ळ is more a variant of र as the र् in Hindi words कर्म and धर्म. In conclusion, it may be said, that ऋ, लृ and ळ are voiced one behind the other retroflexsively just as is the case with ट* *class hard and soft consonants. For reasons best known to Panini, ळ is not included in the Maaheshwar Sutras, even when it is seen and heard in the Vedas. ळ is a सवर्ण* *of ऋ and लृ and thus can find its place in the second sutra of Maaheshwar after लृ. Thus, the second sutra in the Maaheshwar Sutras should read as ऋलृळक्. This arrangement will leave no room for लृ or ल to be classified as dental."
