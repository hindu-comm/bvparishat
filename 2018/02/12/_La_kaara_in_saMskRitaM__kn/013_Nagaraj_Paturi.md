What the south Indian priests say is considered to be an influence of their mother tongues on their ritual Sanskrit expressions. That is not taken into account as standard Laukika Samskrita usage.

  

Such ळ is found in the English pronunciation of some south Indians too. But that does not make ळ one of the phones/phonemes of English.
