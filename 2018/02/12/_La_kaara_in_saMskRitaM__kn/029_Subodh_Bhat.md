\- I still maintain that ळ kara was banished from Sanskrit, because of the act of omission. He did not include ळ kara in his Maheshwara Sutras, which are meant to enumerate the अच् s and the हल् s permitted in Sanskrit.

- This is also supported by the usage of ळ kara in Grantha and Tulu lipi manuscripts of Mahabharata, Puranas and other Manuscripts available in various Orient Libraries all over South India.

- In fact by this act of omission, several words in ancient Sanskrit is Lost to us. For example काळ means dark and काल means time in ancient Sanskrit. Now in Paninian Sanskrit both becomes काल and the ancient usage of काळ meaning dark is totally lost to us today.
