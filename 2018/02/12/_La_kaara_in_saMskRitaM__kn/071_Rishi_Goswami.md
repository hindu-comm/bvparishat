Haraye namah.  
  
Vidvadbhyo namah.  
  
With due respect to all schollars,  
Everything can be derived 8 types. Samhitartha, adhyayartha, shlokartha, vakyartha, paadartha, shabdartha, aksharartha and Tatparyartha. Raghu and Laghu in shabdartha maybe same, but their Tatparyartha varies according to usage. Whereas Romaharsha and Lomaharsha have the shabdartha and Tatparyartha as the same.  
  
We see the vyutpatti of Rama as 3 types mainly. 1 is yoigik shabdartha, ramate anena iti Raamah (ghayn pratyayant). 2nd is Tatparyartha - Sundara/Manojnya and TamAlapatra and Dasharathaputra, Balarama, Parashurama etc many Tatparyarthas. 3rd is aksharartha - “राशब्दो विश्ववचनो मश्चापीश्वरवाचकः । विश्वानामीश्वरो यो हि तेन रामः प्रकीर्त्तितः ॥"  
  
So we saw the last 3 arthas - shabdartha, aksharartha and Tatparyartha in the word Raama. Same as shlokartha uptill Samhitartha.  
  
So Raghu and Laghu cannot be considered as one example applicable to all contexts. Some dhatus such as girati/gilati, or sphura/sphula are applicable in all contexts based on their Tatparyartha. Vyakaran is based on Laukik(Pauranik/Samhitaadi Rishivakyas) and Vaidik usage. Rishivakyas are to be considered as pramana for Vyakaran. So Paniniji has only constructed vyakarana based on the practical usages of words. Some words can also be found that are not siddha by Ashtadhyayi. Panini Vyakaran doesn't deal with Arthasiddhi, it only deals with Vyutpatti and Prakriti-pratyaya. Aacharyas have understood the Vedas and have written down their commentaries based on 8 principles.  
  
So there is no rule or mechanism assigned to such words and their usage. Rishivakyas are the only Pramanas for their formation and usage. Aacharya-vakya is Pramana in their Arthas and Vyutpattis. Each shabda can be derived differently based on each Aacharyas point of view. We can't equate one eg woth all the other examples.  
  
This is what I have understood. Thankyou.  
  
Pranam to all schollars.  
  
Regards  
  
Rishi.
