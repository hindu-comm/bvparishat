The 5 prashna-s taittirIya brAhmaNa 3.10-12, AraNyaka 1 and AraNyaka 2 are borrowings from the kAThaka shAkhA. The examples below are from the last chapter. These prashna-s have a number of phonological features different from the rest of the taittirIya corpus. One of them is retaining the samyutAkShara shn and not converting it to sh\~n. The latter would make the insertion of the consonant t between sh and n as abhinidana as required by the taittirIya prAtishAkhya redundant and is followed at least by Tamil taittirIyaka-s. I have discussed this in the paper which I had submitted to the WSC and had posted its link a while back.

  

Nevertheless, there are 3 instances of La occurring in the AraNyaka chapter 6, pitR^i-medham anuvAka 7.

The La is substituted for Da as pointed out by Prof. Deshpande, but here the la is converted to La. They are all from the word nala - a reed.

  

I am interested in knowing where this occurs in the samhitA. Admittedly my knowledge of the samhitA is not as good as the shAkhA. I know of no instance where this occurs in the samhitA. In the shAkhA, La occurs only in AraNyaka chapter 2 and the instance I quoted above. It is entirely non-existent in the brAhmaNa. As a matter of fact the taittirIya prAtishAkhya does not mention La as a consonant at all in chapter 1. The commentator of the tribhAshya-ratna cites the sUtra 13.16, pR^iktasvarAtparo lo DaM pauShkarasAdeH pauShkarasAdeH \| to include La in his list of consonants. But the fact is that it talks about conversion of la to Da and not la to La or Da to La. The commentator is actually unable to cite any valid examples from the saMhitA, but does quote the AraNyaka 6. The bhAShya for that sUtra is pretty confusing and not up to the mark (as pointed out correctly by Whitney)

  

Interestingly, the shAyana bhAShya published by the bibliotheca Indica uses la and La in the chapter 6 and chapter 2 as well. This seems to be incorrect. True the word nala is pronounced naLa in chapter 6, however the instances in chapter 2 are conversions of Da to La (similar to the R^ig veda), as shown by the same mantras occurring in the acchidra section with the Da instead of La.
