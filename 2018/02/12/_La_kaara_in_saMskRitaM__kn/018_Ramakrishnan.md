In spoken Vedic, whenever the डकार occurs between two vowels, it is optionally pronounced as a ळकार (similarly the ढकारis optionally replaced byळ्हकार)  
  
For example अग्निमीडे is pronounced as अग्निमीळे as the ड्is between vowels; and *मीढुषे*becomes मीळ्हुषे in pronunciation.

  
Therefore the ळकार is treated as an allophone of theडकार

 (and the ळ्हकारis an allophone of ढकार)

, it is a pronunciation-related observation, not a grammatical change, hence not mentioned in theअष्टाध्यायी

.  
  
This use of ळकार&ळ्हकारin pronunciation is optional, and it does not affect the meaning. However ळकार&ळ्हकार dont exist as independent sounds.  
  
Similarly रकार & लकार are considered allophonic in some cases (even in standard sanskrit, but also in vedic) - for example शुक्ल means the same as शुक्र, लाजा (used in Ashokan inscriptions) is the same as राजा etc.  

  

There is no law that this vedic pronounciation is not fit for use in standard sanskrit - however standard sanskrit tends to favour a regularized pronunciation in addition to regularized grammar - to avoid ambiguities after the emergence of prakrits (since the 4th century BCE) -- you are therefore free to use theळकारand theळ्हकारwhen they occur at intervocalic positions (i.e. between vowels).
