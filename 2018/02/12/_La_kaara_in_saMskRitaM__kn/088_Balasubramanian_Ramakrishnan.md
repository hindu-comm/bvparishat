Interesting. But as per the taittirIya prAtishAkhya, 21.12-13, that's not the definition of a yama.

  

sparshaad-anuttamad-uttama-paraad-AnupUrvyan-nAsikyAH \| 21.13

tan-yamAn-eke \| 21.14

  

The other prAtishAkhyas also call only these the yama-s. So do pretty much every vedic shikShA text. No one mentions the La-kAra anywhere.

  

This makes me doubt how ancient or authentic this text actually is.
