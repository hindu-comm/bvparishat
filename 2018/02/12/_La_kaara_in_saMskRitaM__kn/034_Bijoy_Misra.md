This discussion is veering out.

  

Panini as he claims and as the way one can analyze, is trying to put together

a grammar for the language that is used among the people around him.

He would give many examples where the Vedas would have a different use.

Maheswarisutra is not derived from the Vedas but it a compilation of varNa

that are units of expression. I have not seen any studies claiming the completeness

of the system from the human point of view. My feeling has been that the varNa

assembly was discovered independently from biological and acoustic reasons and

then mapped on to the language to create the grammar. varNa is a speech unit.
