Namaskara,

  

As per Sri Dayanand Saraswati jiळ कार is considered as one of the four yama varna. And is a pratyeka varna.

He published a sutratmaka panini shiksha which he found was much more ancient than the slokatmaka shiksha which is famous now.

Sri yudhishthir mimamsak ji has later published this shiksha aswell.

I have attached couple of screen shots from his varnocharana shiksha regarding this for your kind perusal.
