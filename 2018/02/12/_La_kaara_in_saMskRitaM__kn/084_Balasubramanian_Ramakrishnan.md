Dear Prof. Deshpande,

  

I believe that the La was actually not original to the taittirIyaka-s. The taittirIya prAtishAkhya does not even recognize the La as a vya\~njana in the first chapter. The commentator has to resort to special pleading to include that in his list of consonants and his commentary there is not really up to the mark in that section. shrI Venkata Sriram did say that there are occurrences of La in the samhitA, but I very much doubt its existence there (Whitney said the same thing 150+ years back). There is however no occurrence of it in the brAhmaNa portion except the ones I quoted before. There are many instances where the intervocalic Da is preserved as is in the taittirIya texts. In fact, it is very uniformly preserved. As for adaptation of the kAthaka passages, phonological peculiarities were actually preserved by the taittirIyaka-s and not discarded. They are:

  

1\. retaining the samyutAkShara shna and not converting to s\~na

2\. the vyAhR^iti-s are bhUr-bhuva-svaH in these 5 chapters only and not bhUr-bhuva-suvaH as in the rest of the taittirIya corpus

  

Whether these were the only differences between the two shAkhA-s is uncertain, but these two are preserved. The matter is more complicated than that since:

  

1\. The intervocalic D and Dh are not converted to L and Lh in the other kAthaka borrowings. For example, sumR^iDIkA sarasvati occurs twice in the AraNyaka 1, and is not converted to sumR^iLIkA sarasvati. In the brAhmaNa 3.11, ShoDasheShu shrayadhvam and not ShoLasheShu shrayadhvam. There are other examples as well.

2\. The same R^ik yaddevA devaheLanaM in the AraNyaka 2 occurs in the brAhmaNa 3.7 (not a kAThaka borrowing) with a very minor variation, but the intervocalic D is preserved.

  

So these suggest that

  

a\. The La is not original to the taittirIyaka-s and it is very consistent except for the occurrence in AraNyaka 6 (unless shrI Venkata Sriram can produce some references to the samhitA)

b\. it was not uniformly pronounced like that by the kAThaka shAkhinaH either, unlike the R^ig vedins. If they did not have the L at all, then somehow only these passages in the AraNyaka 2 got the L conversion by the taittirIyaka-s for some reason, but not because of their shAkhA norms.

  

Regarding b, another piece of evidence is the edition of the kapiShThala kaTha samhitA by Raghu Vira, has the following on page 7:

  

"D and Dh between two vowels are thrice changed to L and Lh"
