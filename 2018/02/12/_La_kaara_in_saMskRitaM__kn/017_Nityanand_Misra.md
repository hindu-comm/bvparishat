The logic, in my opinion, is not tenable. Use ofळin Grantha/Tulu scripts is not evidence that Mahabharata and Puranas have use ofळ. More likely, it is regional variation for writing ल.As far as Vedic usage is concerned, the Rigveda Pratishakhya explainsळ as a transformation of ड (and not ल):द्वयोश्चास्य स्वरयोर्मध्यमेत्य संपद्यते स डकारो ळकारः.

  

Many believe the Unadi Sutra-s to predate Panini (some opine they were authored by Panini, one may refer the book *Unadi-sutras in Sanskrit Grammatical Tradition* by Kanshi Ram for more on this). The Unadi-Sutras also do not haveळ.
