Namaste

  

It is observed in some languages the educated class people can easily pronounce Retroflex letters like Na and La but the illiterate people cannot. This shows evolution and refinement of language requires retroflex La also. Banishing away La from language is a backward step. There is a nice article in Economist blog saying the retroflex letters in Sanskrit are coming from Dravidian Languages. From Sanskrit they came to North Indian languages.

But the mystery is why Panini did not allow La when he knew he had to allow other retroflex letters like Na?
