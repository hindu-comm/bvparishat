\- ळ kara was in common Sanskrit usage before Panini. Panini banished from its useage.

\- We all agree that Sanskrit was pre-Panini. Vedas and even Vyasa the author of Mahabharat and Puranas was not averse usingळ karas.

- Old 'Grantha' and 'Tulu' script manuscripts of Itihasas and Puranas do use ळ karas sumptuously.

- Modern Devenagari editors of Mahabharat & Puranas have omitted ळ kara and used ल kara in its place.

- In Vedas however due to the importance to oral traditions, pada-pata and swaras they could not edit and henceळ kara remains.

Hence in conclusion we can safely say that banning ळ kara was post-Paninian phenomenon. Before that Sanskrit used ळ kara in abundance without any reluctance or restrictions.
