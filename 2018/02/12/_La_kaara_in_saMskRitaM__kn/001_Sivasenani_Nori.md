In the Paninian framework (which covers both vaidika and laukika Sabdas), there is no La (ळ). This is the general position.

  

In Veda, La is ordained by the PraatiSaakhyas. Similarly in certain places, usage of La is tolerated in laukikasanskrit, on account of aacaara (I have seen a two-centuries old Sanskrit work in Telugu letters using La regularly). The difference is that these La users in laukikaSabda do not insist on La and are happy with la (ल) as well, but that optionality is not admitted in the vaidikaSabda.

  

With passage of time usage of La in laukika Sanskrit seems to be decreasing. The situation is similar w.r.t. usage of ba in the place of va. Older works seem to have either more regularly, but newer ones and editions seem to prefer va consistently. Maybe the effect of increased communications and interaction across the country, resulting in more standardisation.

N Siva Senani
