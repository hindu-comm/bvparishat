Why must Panini not have included ळ in the Maheshwar Sutras? The first possible reason is 'ळ does not come at the beginning of a word but the same is the case withलृ. But there appears to be one more reason. ळcan neither be called a consonant because one cannot prefix it to a vowel because the moment one suffixes a vowel to it it loses its retroflex character. It cannot be called a vowel because it cannot be prefixed or suffixed to a consonant.
