Namaste

  

Even today we can hear South Indian priests usingळ Kara in Poojas. They sayमंगळनीराजनं समर्पयामि instead ofमंगलनीराजनंसमर्पयामि. In Venkatesha Mangalam and other Mangalam stotras they regularly sayमंगळ only like अमुकदेवाय मंगळम् and so on. They also sayकाळिका instead of कालिका in Kali Stotras and Poojas.ळ Kara is alive and well in Laukika Sanskrit words today and used by many people though it is not in Paninian Sanskrit.
