Dear Shri Karve,

  

  The best source for the versified Pāṇinīya Śikṣā is the critical edition by Manomohan Ghose published from Calcutta in 1938. It provides this Śikṣā in five available recensions and two commentaries with a translation. There is a prose version of Pāṇinīya Śikṣā published by Yudhishthir Mimamsak along with Āpiśali Śikṣā and Cāndra Varṇasūtras.
The versified version is more well known as compared to the prose version. The versified version refers to the story of Pāṇini being blessed by Śiva. However, this story is unknown to Kātyāyana, Patañjali and even to Bhartr̥hari around 500 A.D. The prose version of the Śikṣā is very close to the Āpiśali Śikṣā and is probably older. However, upto the time of Bhartr̥hari, there is no awareness of a Pāṇinīya Śikṣā as such. Perhaps, Ashok Aklujkar can say something more authoritative about Bhartr̥hari. The phonetic categories given in the different versions of Pāṇinīya Śikṣā do not completely match what is required for the functioning of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. My student James Bare wrote a dissertation in 1975 on this subject comparing the phonetic categories of this Śikṣā and the various Prātiśākhyas with the requirements of the rules of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. George Cardona has also written a monograph on this subject. All I can say is that this is a very complex subject and there are no easy answers.
