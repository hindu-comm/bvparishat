Madhav ji,

  

You might want to check if in ḍh, ḍ combines with h, or whether this is a single phoneme not involving any merger.

  

If ḍh is a single akṣara, ḷh is its allophone and is also a single letter - not a samyuktākṣara.

  

We write it as ḍh or ḷh not because it is ḍ+h orḷ+h but because of a lack of a unique letter in the script.  
  
In Marathi (and in dravidian languages),ळ is not an allophone but a distinct akṣara so please do not retrofit this on Old-Indo-Aryan.

  

Thanks,  
Ram
