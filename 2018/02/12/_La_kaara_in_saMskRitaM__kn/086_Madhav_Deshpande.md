Dear Shri Balasubramanian Ramakrishnan,

  

  Thank you for your finer analysis of the Taittirīya texts and the occurrence of ळ in those texts. I have wondered why the Taittirīya Prātiśākhya does not have this sound, and yet some commentators to struggle to include it. Most likely this reflects a change in the tradition since the composition of the Prātiśākhya. I have documented such shifts in the recitation of the Śaunakīya Atharvaveda, but I have not studied the Taittirīya tradition in such detail. Your message makes it clear that we need such detailed studies of possible transition in the transmission of these texts. With best wishes,
