Dear Sri Ramana Muthy garu,

  

ఱ of Telugu has nothing to do with Sanskrit.

It has been included in the Telugu VarNamaalaa because it occurs in dEs'ya ( words not borrowed into Telugu from Sanskrit or any other language) words. It occurs in Tamil and other south Indian languages too.

  

By the time of early Telugu inscriptions itself it came to exist just as a script symbolreminiscent of a past pronunciation. When it was pronounced, it is believed that it was pronounced as the retroflex version of ర.

  

Yes, Telugu ళ is similar to this in being the retroflex version of ల. This too is included in theTelugu VarNamaalaa because it occurs in dEs'ya ( words not borrowed into Telugu from Sanskrit or any other language) words. It too occurs in Tamil and other south Indian languages too.

  

Incidentally this dEs'yaళ is close in pronunciation to the Sanskrit /Vedicळ.
