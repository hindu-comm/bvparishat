Dear Shri Karve,

  

  I have been reading your comments and it appears to me that you are not aware of the context of the occurrence of ळ and ळ्ह in the R̥gveda and in the Kāṇva Śākhā of the Śukla Yajurveda. The Prātiśākhyas clearly state that ड and ढ occuring between vowels are replaced with ळ and ळ्ह respectively. This makes it abundantly clear that the sounds ळ and ळ्ह do not occur at the beginning of words or at the very end of the words, but they can occur only between vowels, for example ईडे being replaced with ईळे in the first verse of the R̥gveda. According to the R̥gveda Prātiśākhya, this change occurs according to Vedamitra, suggesting that this change was not universal, but occurred only in certain schools of the Veda. Pāṇini shows no awareness of this change, perhaps because the R̥gveda version that he was familiar with did not have this change.
