Dr. Śāstry ji,  
  
Do you know/agree there were multiple Sanskrit dialects spoken in Pāṇini's lifetime - and his grammar is a 'standardization' of their morphology?  
  
If there was just one spoken dialect, then there was no need to standardize its grammar - the aṣṭādhyāyī would have been entirely unnecessary.  
  
I maintain that raghu/laghu, roma/loma, śukra/śukla, nīra/nīla etc are dialectal variations in those spoken sanskrit dialects (some dialects of sanskrit conventionally used l instead of r). These dialectal variations of r/l were not used for every word, so there are no r/l equivalents for all words, but certainly the variations did exist, and l was more common in some dialects while r was more common in other dialects of sanskrit.  
  
Regards,  
Ram
