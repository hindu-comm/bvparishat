Dear Scholars,

  

I am attaching a pdf of my book titled 'Unveiling the Atlantis of Sanskrit Phonology'. The book, I think, is self explanatory. The book is a product of the results experienced by me after I started doubting my own tongue and trying to understand what the Maheshwar Sutras could mean.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
