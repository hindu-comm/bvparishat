A rare post in which “c” in "My 2c” stands for ‘gold cent”.

What a great damage India has done to itself in the last seventy years or so!  
  
How great our gratitude should be for organizations like Sanskrit Bhāratī that are trying to rebuild the cultural palace of India, no matter how many shortcomings beset their effort!  
  
Thanks Shri L. Srinivas.
