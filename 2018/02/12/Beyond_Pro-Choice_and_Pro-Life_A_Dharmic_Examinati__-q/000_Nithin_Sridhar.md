In this talk, I argue that it is time Indians move beyond the extreme positions of Pro-Life & Pro-Choice in the Abortion debate, which has created huge social fault-lines in the West. Towards this end, I have tried to provide an Indic & Hindu narrative on abortion based on Hindu Dharmashastras. Do watch & Share.
