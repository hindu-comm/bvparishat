Incidentally, and no offence meant,  

there is a lot for Sri Rishi Goswamiji  
to improvehis standard of Sanskrit.  

There simply are too many errors in his writing samplings.  
  

It is perhaps too early to jump into these niceties,  

but the effort must go on.  
The keenness however is commendable.
