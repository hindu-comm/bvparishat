Thankyou Shivasenaniji, for wonderful help.  
Thankyou Kannanji.  
Namaskaraah.  
  
  
Also, can we use Vidhiling for Sambhavana? Are Samprashnanand Sambhavana the same?  
  
For eg, स तु अवश्यमेव स्वपत्नीम् ताडयेद् इति।  
He may be hitting his wife.  
  
You were very helpful.  
  
apart from "vudhinimantrana....prarthaneshu ling" all these arthas, can we use it in Sambhavana? Is it right?  
  
Samprashna { 【 iti kaaryam na va? "kim nu khalu bhoh vyakaranam adheeyeeya?" 】 iti balamanorama.}  
Can we say Sambhavana is Samprashna or can be antarbhoot inside?  
  
Like, he must be tired.  
स तु विश्रांतो भवदेव।  
Or he might not eat rice.  
स तु भक्तं न वा खादयेदिति.  
  
Regards  
Rishi.
