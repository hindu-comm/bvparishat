Haraye namah.  
Vidvadbhyo namah.

मान्या विद्वान्सः! अहं संस्कृतव्यवहारे कतिचन प्रयोगान् वक्तुमसमर्थ:। आंग्लभाषायाम् हिंदीभाषायाम् वा ये प्रयोगाः रुढा: तेषां संस्कृते अनुवादं कथं स्यात्? इत्याशंकाम् निवारयन्तु कृपया।

How do I say "He let the sand slip through his fingers?"

Usages of "ऐसा होने दिया" + "करने दिया" ?  
English - "he let that happen" etc.

Some usages such as "करने लगा" + "मन्द हवा बहने लगी"  
English, "wind started flowing" OR "he started playing cricket."

Some usages such as  
"वह गीत गाता रहा।"  
He continued to sing that song.  
He went on singing that song.  
Like "करता रहा" + "बोलता रहा" etc.

  
Some usages such as,  
"वह ज़रूर दारू पीता होगा"  
He may be drinking wine.  
"वह अपनीपत्नीको मारता होगा।"  
He may be hitting bis wife.  
Usages like "may have been", "might be" etc.

As long as - यावत्?  
  
As usual/ as always- हमेशा की तरह इस बार भी - प्रायेण?

जबसे - तबसे  
English - Since he arrived at the hall..... Everyone started staring at him.  
तबसे लेकर ..... अबतक।  
From that time.... uptil today.  
यदाप्रभृति ...... तदाप्रभृति???  
यदावधि - तदावधि????

"You're almost there."  
You have almost reached.  
तुम बस पहुंचते ही होंगे।  
बस आने ही वाला है। etc..  
Almost forty years old.  
संस्कृत - कल्पप्देश्यदेशीयर्???  
स तु अयम् आगच्छति???  
सा चत्वारिंशत्वर्षकल्पा।

After all she is my sister.  
सब कुछ होने पर भी वह मेरी बहन है।  
सर्वं भूत्वा अपि, सा मम भागिनि:???

These are some usages which have troubled me alot. I do not know how to speak them. I have noted them down, collected them from a lot of time. I have to stop in between I speak Sanskrit. So, I want to know how to speak them. I researched many of them myself too. But I couldnt solve all of them.

I would be very delighted if you all help me.

Thankyou  
Regards  
Rishi.
