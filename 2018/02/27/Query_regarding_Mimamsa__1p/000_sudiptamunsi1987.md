Dear Scholars,  
  
I will be highly obliged if examples for the following are provided preferably from Mīmāmsā and Dharmaśāstras:  
  
If there is an explicit prescription for a duty (say, +D), and an explicit prohibition (say, -D), then -D will overrule +D. But if there is an explicit sub-prohibition (say, -D1) that blocks the possibility of -D, then -D will be overruled by -D1, irrespective of the consideration as to whether -D1 re-establishes +D or not, or it speaks of a new kind of prohibition altogether (instead of upholding +D).  
  
Best regards,
