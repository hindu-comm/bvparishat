In jyotiShToma, which is the prakriti yAga - षड्विंशति अस्य वङ्क्रयः. This says the number of rib bones of the sacrificial animal is 26.

  

Let us consider the case of the ashvamedha, a vikriti yAga.

  

+D - taking the rule प्रकृतिवत् विकृतिः कर्तव्या, this mantra (षड्विंशति अस्य वङ्क्रयः)

has to be chanted during the sacrifice of the horse in the ashvamedha also.

  

-D however, the horse has 34 rib bones. So the prayoga vidhi for ashvamedha says चतुर्त्रिंशत्येव ब्रूयात् , prohibiting the use of the previous mantra and to useचतुस्त्रिंशद्वाजिनो देवबन्धो mantra instead.

  

+D there are oxen and goats also sacrificed in the ashvamedha. Should the vikriti rule hold in their case also? No. The prayoga vidhi for them saysनचतुस्त्रिंशति इति ब्रूयात्षड्विंशतिरित्येव ब्रूयात्.

  

Thus, there is first a codanA (प्रकृतिवत् विकृतिः कर्तव्या), then there is a special rule for vikriti, then a counterexception for other parts of the vikriti.

  

This is quoted as an example of pratiprasava. D is reinstated by pratiprasava, but accommodation is made for the special rule of -D in the case of the horse, otherwise that vidhi will lose any scope for application.
