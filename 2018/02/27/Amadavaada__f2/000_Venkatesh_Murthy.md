Namaste

  

I was listening to some Gujaratis calling Ahmedabad as Amadavad. I am thinking this is good change of name becauseमद is intoxication andअमद is non intoxication.

  

Gujarat state has prohibition of alcohol. Thereforeअमदवाद is a fitting name for Non Intoxication Principle. Home of Gandhiji.
