Yes, I got the confirmation. He passed away last night about 2.30 AM.
He had a heart ailment before.

  

Very sad indeed. He worked in the RBI, Chennai, and was a regular participant at the Sringeri Mahaganapati Vakyartha Sadas. He has trained many aspirants for the prestigious Tenali Shaastra Exams. He was a Devi Upasaka too and used to conduct several sabha-s for various purposes. Very recently he had conducted a Dvaita-Advaita sabha at Chennai, a first-of-its-kind.
