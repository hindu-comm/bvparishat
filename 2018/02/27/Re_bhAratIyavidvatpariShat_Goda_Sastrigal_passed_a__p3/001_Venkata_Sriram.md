Goda Sastrigal was an authority in shankara vedanta and srividya mantra shastra. Inspite of all this, he was so humble and lead a simple life.

  

He was a heart patient but didn't care his health and used to tour a lot for attending shastra / vidwat sabha. Disciples used to advice him to take rest owing to his ill health but he used to deny saying that for me, rest means 'final rest' and that is what has happened.

  

Very unfortunate incident !
