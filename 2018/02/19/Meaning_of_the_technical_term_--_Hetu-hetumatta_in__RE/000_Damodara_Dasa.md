\|\|Hare Krishna\|\|  
  
Respected Vidvaj-janas,  
  
I specifically want to know the meaning of the techincal term  
"hetu-hetumatta" used in the commentary below  
  
In Hari-bhakti-vilāsa, Ch.1 it is mentioned:  
  
viṣnusmṛtau--  
paricaryāyaśolābhalipsuḥ śiṣyādgururnahi\|  
kṛpāsindhuḥ susaṁpūrṇaḥ sarvasattvopakārakaḥ \|\|45\|\|  
  
niḥspṛhaḥ sarvataḥ siddhaḥ sarva-vidyā-viśāradaḥ\|  
sarva-saṁśaya-saṁcchettānalaso gururāhṛtaḥ \|\|46\|\|  
  
Sanātana Gosvāmī's Commentary:  
tattadguṇayukto'pi kevala nijaparicaryādyarthaṁ śiṣyānubandhako  
gururupekṣya iti likhati -- pariccaryeti\| lābhaḥ dhanādiḥ; śiṣyāt  
dīkṣayet śiṣyaṁ kuryādityarthaḥ; yadvā śiṣyāt śiṣyataḥ sakāśāt  
paricaryādilipsūryaḥ; sa gururna bhavatītyarthaḥ\| tarhi kimarthaṁ  
guruṁ syāt? ityapekṣayāṁ likhati -- kṛpāsindhuriti; paramadayālutayā  
lokahitārthameveti bhāvaḥ; atroktānāṁ susampūrṇa ityādīnāṁviśeṣaṇānāṁ  
hetuhetumattohyā; āhṛta vyāhṛta uktaḥ vā \|  
  
My Translation of the commentary:  
"Even if endowed with the said qualities, if a guru is accepting  
disciples only for engaging them in one's personal service, such a  
guru is to be avoided (upekṣya). To mention this sloka starting with  
paricaryā is written here . lābhaḥ means profit in the form of money  
etc.; śiṣyā dīkṣayet means making disciple or else one who is desirous  
of extracting service etc from his disciples; such persons should not  
become guru -- it is said here. Then for what sake one should become  
guru? To answer this it is written the sloka starting with kṛpāsindhu,  
meaning only out of intense compassion for the sake of giving ultimate  
benifit to people in general. The adjectives like susaṁpūrṇa etc that  
are mentioned here are to be understood in the light of the principle  
of hetu-hetumatta."  
  
Also please see if the above translation of the commentary is correct.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
