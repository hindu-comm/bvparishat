Hetu-hetumattaa is literally 'cause and effect.' cause is hetu and that which is endowed with hetu is effect. hetu-hetumadbhAva is another way of expressing the one you are asking about. The adjectives given to the ideal Guru are to be understood in a particular order: The tikakAra gives one example: Because he is kripasindu, he is intent on doing good to the whole world. Since he is susampurnah, he is nihsprihah sarvatah - detached from everything, that is being himself Purna, he is not in want of anything, so he is completely desireless with respect to anything in the world. hence he is siddhah, established. Since he is sarva vidya visharadah, he is able to annul the doubts of all, or all doubts. he is free from tardiness, tamas. such a person is called a Guru.

  

I have given a near-complete meaning. Maybe someone else will be able to connect the gaps too. In any case the hetu-hetumattaa is: one adjective of the Guru results in another adjective. This is the purport.
