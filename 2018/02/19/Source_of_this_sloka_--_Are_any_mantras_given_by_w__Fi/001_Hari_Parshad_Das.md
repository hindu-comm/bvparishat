According to most authorities on mantra-śāstra, ladies have rights to accept and give tantrik mantras. According to some authorities, they have rights for Vedic mantras too.

  

Please find attached a verse from Bhattoji Dixit's Tantradhikarinirnaya where he specifies that ladies have rights into tantrik mantras.

  

In the real world, there have been many ladies in the Gaudiya Sampradaya itself who gave such mantras. For example Sri Haridas Shastri (whose book excerpt you have posted) has ladies passing down mantras in his own parampara. You can see his parampara here —<http://www.sriharidasniwas.org/index.php/sri-guru-parampara/our-guru-shishya-parampara.html>

  

sādhu-caraṇa-rajo'bhilāṣī,

  

hari parshad das.
