\|\|Hare Krishna\|\|  
  
Thankyou for the quotation.  
  
Sorry, the sloka that is attached herein mentions that it is from  
Bhagavatam 10th canto. But I am not able to find it there. Can you  
help.  
  
Also the sloka doesn't mention that stri etc have the eligibility to  
give mantras. It only establishes that they are eligible to get the  
tantrika mantras and the samskara thus achieved is known as vaisnava  
samskara.  
  
Besides this, I heard that in some tantras that are for worship of  
demigoddesses like durga or kali, their mantras can be given by women  
also. Also that some of the siva mantras can be given by women. And  
that visnu mantras are not to be given by women. I am yet to find a  
reference for this.  
  
The HBV sloka that I quoted seems to be from Rudra Yamala or Kularnava  
Tantra i.e. either sakta or saiva tantras.  
  
Thankyou,  
Your servant,  
damodara das
