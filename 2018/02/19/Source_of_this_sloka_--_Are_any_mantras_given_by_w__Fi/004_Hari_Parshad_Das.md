It is quoted by Bhattoji Dixit so it is present at least in his manuscript of the Bhagavatam. The bhagavatam does not have only one manuscript or edition. Besides that, this is only one verse which gives this conclusion. There are many other verses which give similar conclusions in other tantra samgrahas. If needed , I could point them out.

Please try to understand this in an objective way. It seems from your statements that you have already taken a position regarding this in your mind. If the aim is to interpret sastra to suit a predetermined conclusion then I fear that it is not the way of doing sastrartha.

  

When the verse says that they receive 'adhikāra' into the mantra, the adhikara is not mentioned as being partial. The very term adhikara usually implies complete acquisition of rights regarding that mantra unless otherwise stated. The Haribhaktivilasa does not say that the initiated vaishnavi cannot give mantra to others. When these topics are being discussed, the Haribhaktivilasa makes a huge distinction between uninitiated ladies and initiated vaishnavis.

  

So everything in Haribhaktivilasa has to be understood as pertaining to initiated vaishnavis.

This is not seen anywhere at least in the Haribhaktivilasa or its commentary.

Yes but since it is quoted in Haribhaktivilasa, it's authority remains intact.

  

Regarding what you said about Varnashram and sadacara, the traditional schools of Gaudiya Vaishnavism do not see any issue with ladies passing down tantrik Diksha. For them it is completely in line with principles of varnasrama. I have not seen any traditional Gaudiya Vaishnava from any century speak against it. Haridas Shastri ji also accepted initiation in a line where lady mantra gurus are present. Please let me know if any Gaudiya Vaishnava from any century speaks of it as against being varnashram.
