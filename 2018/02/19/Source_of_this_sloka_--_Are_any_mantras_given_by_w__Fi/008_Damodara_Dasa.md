Pranam Prabhu.  
Sri Sri Guru Gaurangau Jayatah  

  
\>\> In case you are willing to discuss this off-conference, please let me know.  
  

All respects to your desire.  
  
But I would like that this discussion go on in this conference with  
other scholars contributing to this end. Just to put the question back  
on track (as it went on to many other points):  
  
I would like to know, referring to the word striya-datte in the  
mentioned sloka,  
  
1. I was curious that which type of mantras women gave (if at all they gave)?  
  
2. whether in ancient tradition i.e. either in any of the four  
vaisnava sampradayas or sankara sampradaya, it has been found or  
allowed that women give certain mantras and accept the position of an  
acarya?  
  
3. Also whether there are such cases in shaiva or shakta sampradayas?  
  
4. Regarding Gaudiya Sampradaya, I already know. So no need to state  
those examples.  
  
5. Proper source of the sloka  
  
Thankyou,  
Dasanudas,  
Damodara das
