Varnasrama is not a separate sampradaya that existed independent of individual vaiṣṇava/śaiva/vedānta sampradayas. Neither can anyone claim that their interpretation of varnasrama is the only correct one. You've read some of Kane's books on Dharmaśāstras, so you will know that varnasrama is defined not by one sage but by many sages and they usually have variations in opinion on how specific rules are to be applied. For example in the sannyāsa-āśrama section of Kane's book, he says how the earlier sannyāsīs were not pontiffs of maṭhas but now many sannyāsīs are pontiffs of maṭhas even though previous sannyāsīs have spoken against acquisition of property by sannyāsīs. The rules are present but they are not always written in stone, and there may be differing opinions too.

  

Varnasrama is defined by the various sampradayas who claim to have adhered to it since their inception. The Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhuḥ itself says —saṁmataṁ bhakti-vijñānāṁ bhakty-aṅgatvaṁ tu karmaṇām — Vedic karmas according to varna and ashrama that are helpful to bhakti are a limb of bhakti. Thus the sampradaya and its various branches accept the system of varnashram for those who are still bound by its rules. Therefore to say that the practices that were carried out in the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition from its very beginning may have been outside of varnashrama is a strange claim to make, and most probably it can be easily challenged by all those who belong to the traditional parivāras of Gaudiya Vaishnavism. Almost all of them have had vaishnavis passing down mantras.

I am sure that your intentions are sincere and you truly wish to find out what śāstra says. Definitely other scholars can say what they have seen in their respective sampradayas, but what happened in the past in the Gaudiya Sampradaya is very clearly mentioned in history and nobody within or outside the sampradāya has opposed it till now.

While it is a historical fact that ladies in the past as well as present who are sadyovadhūs have been less involved in taking positions of authority within religious groups or institutions, it is not the case with the brahmavādinīs. Moreover, this statement of yours is taking significant liberties with the past as well as present. Since you have mentioned shankara sampradaya, I believe you consider it as an authority in matters of varnashrama. Even in the shankara sampradaya, there have been various cases of ladies becoming mahamandaleshwaras and getting rights to accept as well as bestow mantras on others. For example, kindly see this news report:<https://www.amarujala.com/news-archives/astrology-archives/nirbhayananda-puri-fifth-woman-mahamandaleshwar-of-niranjani-akhara>

  

These various pontiffs of the shankara sampradaya who are mahamandaleshwars are also a group of vidvans, and they are not from the Gaudiya Vaishnava sampradaya. Thus, their opinion should be counted too by an unbiased researcher as your good self.

Since we are speaking about dharma-śāstras, here is a quote from dharma-śāstras given in the Vācaspatyam lexicon regarding adhikāra —“सर्व्वे स्युरधिकारण” इति स्मृतिः

In most cases I agree. However, ladies can also be categorized as brāhmaṇīs, and as I have pointed out in the other email, Haribhaktivilāsa commentary says that rules which are applicable for brahmanas are applicable for brahmanis too. Since the Haribhaktivilasa does not give any specific restriction for brahmanis, we will have to find another scripture which can be accepted by the Gaudiya vaishnavas as being even more authoritative than haribhaktivilasa and which specifically prevents initiated brahmanis from performing the function of diksha.

My opinion is that what you are saying here can open up a can of complications. Ideally I would like to discuss this off conference if you are interested.

Unless quoted as purvapaksa, I don't think that verses are quoted just like that so that someone will later come and question their level of authoritativeness. Frankly speaking, there is absolutely no statement in the Haribhaktivilasa which prevents specifically an initiated vaishnavi from performing any puja or diksha related functions.

I am not sure in what way this statement applies to initiated vaishnavis. This statement is not written as a vidhi-vākya, and moreover Sunīti was not an initiated vaishnavī. To cite the case of an uninitiated lady and apply it in the domain of initiated ladies causes logical fallacies. In ISKCON and other sampradayas too, rules for uninitiated and initiated ladies are quite different and one has different considerations for initiated and uninitiated members of the sampradaya.

  

In case you are willing to discuss this off-conference, please let me know.
