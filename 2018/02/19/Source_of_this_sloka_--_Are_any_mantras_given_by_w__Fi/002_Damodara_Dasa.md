\>\> In the real world, there have been many ladies in the Gaudiya Sampradaya itself who gave such mantras. For example Sri Haridas Shastri (whose book excerpt you have posted) has ladies passing down mantras in his own parampara.  
  

Yes, that I know. But because we have to depend on sastra and  
varnasrama tradition, I am looking for some references based on sruti,  
smrti, and sadacara.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara das
