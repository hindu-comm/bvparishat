I think whole compound ending with वान्तामृतैः should be linked with अस्तोकाप्लुतम् qualifying शिव instead of connecting with अभिषिञ्चेत्! Rest of commentary Rishi seems perfect. That means always शिव is always soaked by the nectar of moon and need not be be taken for अभिषेक on full moon as seems to be interpreted by Rishi.
