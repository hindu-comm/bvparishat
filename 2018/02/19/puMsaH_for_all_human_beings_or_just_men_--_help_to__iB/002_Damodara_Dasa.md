Pranam Prabhu.  
  
I think that is not the full meaning of it. Here in the commentary the  
word used is 'karmasu,' i.e. in the matter of karma or religious  
duties and sadacara, men has pradhanya or dominance and thus the male  
word is used.  
  
I think it cannot be expanded to anywhere when the word brahmana is  
used brahmani is also included. For instance, in sastras we find that  
yājana is one of the duties of a brāhmaṇa. But this belongs  
specifically to male brahmana and not female brahmana. Female brahmana  
has some eligibility to do yajana but not yājana.  
  
I think, in the commentary, it means that the duties that are now  
being mentioned are primarily mentioned keeping in the mind the males  
and not females. Females may be eligible or even required for some of  
these duties, but not all of them.  
This is also our general way of describing things. What is dominant is  
addressed.  
  
Thankyou,  
Your servant,  
damodara das
