While other scholars may reply I will attempt to give as literal as possible translation of the verse and commentary here:

  

***puṁso gṛhīta-dīkṣasya śrī-kṛṣṇaṁ pūjayiṣyataḥ***

***ācāro likhyate kṛtyaṁ śruti-smṛty-anusārataḥ***

  

**Translation**: For a person who has accepted initiation, the code of conduct pertaining to worship of Śrī Kṛṣṇa is being written now according to śruti and smṛti.

  

**Commentary**:

  

**puṁsaḥ puṁ-mātrasyety arthaḥ \|**

  

**Translation**: The term 'puṁsaḥ' means 'for any person'.

  

**śrī-viṣṇu-dīkṣā-grahaṇa-mātreṇa sarveṣām eva tatrādhikārāt \|**

  

**Translation**: Because merely by accepting Śrī Viṣṇu-dīkṣā, everyone gets a right \[pertaining to such worship\].

**  
**

**yadyapi strīṇām apy adhikāro’sti iti pūrvaṁ likhitaṁ, tathāpi karmasu puṁsaḥ prādhānyāt puṁsa ity atra likhitam \|**

  

**Translation**: Although it has been mentioned previously that ladies too have rights to such worship, still due to predominance of men in such acts, the term 'puṁsa' is being mentioned here.

  

**evam agre lekhyaṁ brāhmaṇam ity ādikam apy ūhyam \|**

  

**Translation**: Similarly when the verses written ahead mention 'brāhmaṇam' \[a masculine term\], one should understand it similarly \[to include initiated women\].

  

**Note**: An example of this can be seen in the 13th verse of this very chapter. The 13th verse says —***sālasyaṁ ca durannādaṁ brāhmaṇaṁ bādhate’ntakaḥ*** — Yamarāja punishes a ***brāhmaṇa*** who is lazy and who eats contaminated food. Although only the masculine gender has been used, it does not mean that the condition does not apply for a ***brāhmaṇī***. A ***brāhmaṇī*** should also ensure that she is not lazy and that she does not eat contaminated food, or else ayvāpti-doṣa (fault of incomplete domain of application) will come into effect.

  

**śrī-kṛṣṇaṁ pūjayiṣyata iti tat-pūjārthaka ity arthaḥ \|**

  

**Translation**: The phrase 'śrī-kṛṣṇaṁ pūjayiṣyataḥ' means 'pertaining to the worship of Śrī Kṛṣṇa'.

  

**śruty-ādy-anusāreṇa kṛtyam avaśyaṁ kartuṁ yogyaṁ yat yat karma, śruti-smṛty-anusārata ity asya likhyata ity anena vā sambandhaḥ \|\|**

  

**Translation**: The phrase 'śruti-smṛty-anusārataḥ' indicates that whatever acts are mentioned according to śruti and smṛti as being compulsorily worthy of being performed. Or it can mean 'whatever is written here is according to śruti and smrti'.

  

(**End of Translation**)

  

**Please note**: I have tried my best to be as literal and logical as possible in this translation, and wherever I have added my explanations, I have put them in brackets and supported them with quotes found in the haribhaktivilāsa itself.

  

sādhu-caraṇa-rajo'bhilāṣī,

  

hari parshad das.

**Automatically Inserted Signature**: Dear receiver. In case I am not able to reply to your emails due to lack of time, kindly do not take it negatively. In the age of the internet and social media, it is almost impossible to respond to hundreds of individuals who are simultaneously communicating with us using these platforms. Although my attempt is to try and respond to every possible email, it is simply not possible sometimes due to work overload and time related constraints. Kindly understand my predicament and excuse me if I am sometimes unable to reply to your emails.
