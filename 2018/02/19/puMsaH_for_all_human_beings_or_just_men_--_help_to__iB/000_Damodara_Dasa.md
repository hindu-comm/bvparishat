Respected Vidvaj-janas,  
  
In the Hari-bhakti-vilāsa, Chapter 3rd (topic sadācāra) beginning it is stated:  
  
puṁsaḥ gṛhīta-dīkṣasya śrī-kṛṣṇaṁ-pūjayiṣyataḥ\|  
ācāro likhyate kṛtyaṁ śruti-smṛty-anusārataḥ\|\|2\|\|  
  
Sanātana Gosvāmī's Commentary:  
  
puṁsaḥ puṁmātrasyetyarthaḥ, śrī-viṣṇudīkṣāgrahaṇamātreṇa sarveṣāmeva  
tatrādhikārāt yadyapi strīṇāmapyadhikāro'sti iti purvaṁ likhitam,  
tathāpi karmasu puṁsaḥ prādhānyāt puṁsa ityatra likhitam\| evamagre  
lekhyaṁ brāhmaṇamityādikamapyūhyam\|  
  
My translation:  
"The word puṁsaḥ here should be taken to mean 'of all human beings'  
because just by taking viṣṇudīkṣā everyone becomes eligible for that.  
Although it is said before that women also becomes eligible for that  
(karma), but because in acts of karma dominance is that of men, here  
it is written 'puṁsaḥ' which seem to indicate men only. In this way it  
should be understood in other places to come in this book when  
brāhmaṇa etc are mentioned."  
  
Is my understanding of the commentary correct? Any comments and  
additions welcome.  
  
Thankyou,
