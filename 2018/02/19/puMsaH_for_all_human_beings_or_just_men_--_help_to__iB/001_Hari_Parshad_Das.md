What it says here is that whenever the term 'pumān' is mentioned, 'strī' should also be counted as upalakṣaṇa, just as when 'brāhmaṇa' is mentioned, 'brāhmaṇī' should be included as upalakṣaṇa. Her name need not be mentioned separately. Just as someone says — brāhmaṇo na hantavyaḥ, a brāhmaṇī is also included in that instruction by upalakṣaṇa and her name need not be mentioned separately. Since Haribhaktivilāsa has already said — strīṇām apy adhikāro 'sti (ladies have rights), so it will not keep mentioning ladies separately everywhere. They are to be understood as included wherever the men are mentioned. To make a long story short, the Haribhaktivilāsa says that initiated ladies acquire the same rights.
