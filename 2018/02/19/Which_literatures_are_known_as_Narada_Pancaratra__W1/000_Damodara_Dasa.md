Respected Vidvaj-janas,  
  
Narada Pancaratra is famous. There are certain samhitas that are known  
as Narada Pancaratra. Three are in my knowledge---  
1. Jnanamrtasara Samhita  
2. Bharadvaja Samhita  
3. Jayakhya Samhita  
  
Besides these are there other samhitas that are known as Narada Pancaratra?  
  
Also how it is known that some samhita is Narada Pancaratra or not?  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
