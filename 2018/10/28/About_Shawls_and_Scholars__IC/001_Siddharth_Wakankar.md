Dear Sir,

  

You are absolutely right.

  

In fact,many a time,the shawls have much less warmth and more of a show and pomp and they are hardly used afterwards.

  

Similarly, flowers get withered away within a day or two and consequently dispatched to the dustbins.

  

The mementos also get piled up and are difficult to dispose of,as they are not useful to others and pose a maintenance problem.

The shawls can be used as shirts, Jhabbas etc.if properly stitched.

  

Last year,I gave away 15-18 shawls to orphanages, old.age homes and Nari samrakshan.gruhas,so that,at least,they could be used.

  

Our teacher used to say(and I also profess it) that give me only one flower as a token and don't waste money on bouquets etc.

  

Other mementos also meet the same fate after some years.

  

The organisers should seriously ponder over this genuine problem.

  

Best luck in their efforts.

  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
