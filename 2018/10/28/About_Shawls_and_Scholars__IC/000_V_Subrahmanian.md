Namaste

  

It is the experience of scholars that in any forum of Veda, Vedanta, Shaastra, Purana, music, dance, etc. the scholars, chief guests, etc. are 'honored' with shawls - of various types, silk, art silk, woolen, cotton, polyester, and so on. Also come things like mementos, non-perishable decorative garlands of various types. I also see the 'Mysuru PeTa' (turban) placed on the head of scholars in certain functions. Some scholars have told me that the collection of these items pile up in their houses, often creating maintenance problems.
There are dozens of shawls in their cupboards, several mementos of various hues and sizes, many Mysuru turbans, citations, etc. with layers of dust accumulating on them. 'What is to be done with them?' is the question one faces. How many can we gift away to family members, friends and so on? What will they do with them, further? Who wears gaudy shawls with rich embroidery unless he is unmindful of the glances and comments? Who wears the gifted turbans once again? It is like the turban a bridegroom is required to wear on the wedding muhurtham and never again in his life.

  

Fruits and cash awards alone stand the best disposal, viniyoga. But the other non-perishable things stated above are hard to dispose. Do organizers of functions think about this? Should not there be a dialogue initiated and a remedial tradition put in place? Can't the money spent on these things be put to any better use? Offering a bouquet to every guest on the dais also is a formality. Soon after the guests disperse, the bouquets left over are swept away and reach the trashcan.

  

How do functions in foreign countries, universities, etc. fare in this?

  

The above is not about vidwat but related to vidwans.

  

Thoughts from members are welcome.

  

warm regards
