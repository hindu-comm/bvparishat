Thank you Madhav for sharing this great news. Scholars like Padmanabh Jaini are becoming exceedingly rare, His towering scholarship combined with his utter humility represents everything that our culture embodies. I have had the good fortune of meeting him a few times but envy you for your being in the presence of this veteran 'jñānavr̥ddha' on his 95th felicitation ceremony.

P.S. Is the usage 'jñānavr̥ddha' correct?
