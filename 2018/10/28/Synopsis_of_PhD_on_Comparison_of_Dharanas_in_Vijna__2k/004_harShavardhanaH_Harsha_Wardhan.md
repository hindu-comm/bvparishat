Sri Puranik,

  

Congratulations on your PhD.

  

The synopsis is interesting. If it is ok with you, pls consider uploading the entire thesis on Shodhganga (my search there has not traced this thesis) and sharing the link here for the benefit of us all.

  

Sharing a thought: My understanding on this subject matter is that VB seeks to nullify the mind, while PYS seeks to unite the mind (zero-pointed/flat vs one-pointed/focussed)

  

VB's approach is somewhat reminiscent of the Zen koans of Japan, in my opinion. Amanaska is also a parallel here. Laya is the overall tradition, of course.

  

thanks

Harsha
