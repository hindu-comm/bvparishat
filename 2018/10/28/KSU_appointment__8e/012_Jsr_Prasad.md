Sorry to see the recent comments. I don't think, the member Sri Ramananda Chatterjee has filed a PIL in a high court and the judge Prof. Nagaraj ji rejected it outright. Would any member claim this to be a legal forum like consumer forum to resolve issues? The Moderator would have rejected the thread initially itself,had he thought of doing so, which is made clear from his recent response narrating the entire background of this thread.

  

First of all, the very member should realize contempt of his own statement \<What do you mean by, "if any member knew meaning" in so called Bharatiya Vidvat Parishat.\>. Probably he's not aware the fact that there are very senior and most eminent scholars, at national and international level, participate in the discussions besides very young and talented scholars.

  

Freedom of expression is fine, but not hate speech. Just because one of his/her posts is rejected, how can a member "hate" the moderator? It seems that that the respected member wants to create a split and confuse some of us.This reminds us the following verse -

  

पारुष्यमनृतं चैव पैशुन्यं चापि सर्वशः ।

असंबद्धप्रलापश्च वाङ्मयं स्याच्चतुर्विधम् ।।

  

BVP has two moderators. I have been a part-time (for which I am comfortable) moderator since Sri Ajit Gargeswari's time. I assist Prof. Nagaraj ji when he's out of station at times. As far as my experience go, he's sincere, prompt, scholarly and impartial in moderating the list as observed in comments of Prof. Kannan ji and Prof. Wakankar ji and some others too.  

  

The purpose of starting this thread (saraswati samhaara..) is lost in the midst of unwarranted expressions. Prof. Nagaraj ji is not responsible for any kind of 'samhaara' at KSU. Hope, members would realize the sensibilities of a Moderator and express maintaining the propriety.

  

Soon, we are going to celebrate 10 years of BVP reflected in an International conference in the month of January '19. Prof. Nagaraj ji will post the 2nd circular soon. All respected members, who believe that this is is not 'so-called BVP,' are most welcome to join and enrich proceedings with their insightful papers.  

  

Best regards

Jsr Prasad
