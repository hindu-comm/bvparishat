Without getting persona, is there any merit in the \[exaggerated\] statement? I would like to know if the VC who seems to be a scholar of Kannada and Jainology (from this [link](http://www.ksu.ac.in/en/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PADMASHEKAR-biodata1.pdf)) has enough expertise in Sanskrit? Should not Sanskrit University VCs be from the field of Sanskrit only?
