Dear Scholars,

  

I break my silence. We have seen enough corruption in India and other places. Academic corruption is bigger than any thing else. Let us uphold the sanctity of BVP. BVP is a place where people come for academic matters. I don’t discourage members not to share their feelings and agony about the incidents that are happening around us in the academic centres. But, most times we will become muted spectators. Better IF we are able to do an objective assessment of such situations to create awareness in academic circle. Thats not happening.

  

As a core committee member of the list, I stand for moderator. Fairly the issues are dealt by the moderator without taking any side as always. Members are requested to adhere to the modesty of the list. Chair is a sacred position in the meetings. People respect the words of chair. Moderator is the chair of the list. Members can privately discuss the matter with Moderator or with any core committee members if needed.

  

Anyways please continue with this thread if you want to assess the case objectively or to construct any theory on the basis of these issues. Any solution also holds good.

  

I reserve my takings on this topic for sharing. Time will come to share.

  

Warm regards,

Shrinivasa Varakhedi
