Respected list members

  

There was a thread “Sarasvati-samhara at KSU” (or with a similar title) on bvparishat recently. I could not respond to it and I cannot find the thread now (has it been deleted?), hence writing here.

  

Does anybody know more details about the appointment in question? The post to which the appointment was made, whether it was a reserved post, how many candidates were interviewed, etc. Any news channels, newspapers, or magazines which have covered the topic?

  

Thanks, Nityananda
