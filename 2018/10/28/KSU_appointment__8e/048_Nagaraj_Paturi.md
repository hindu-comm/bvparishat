Names of Dr Ananya Vajpeyi and Prof. Sheldon Pollock were taken to discuss their scholarly opinions or their opinions on scholars , scholarly works and scholarship. They were not related to hiring and firing. To discuss scholarly opinions or opinions on scholars , scholarly works and scholarship is well within the scope of BVP and well within the ideals of BVP. Issues of hiring and firing too as far as their implications for the scholarship in the areas of focus of BVP are concerned, can be discussed in BVP. I wanted to avoid dragging names of scholars not related to the story of hiring under discussion.
