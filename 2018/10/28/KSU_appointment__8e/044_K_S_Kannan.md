I am a person who holds that complacence is complicity.

My worry was only whether all this would only end up in mere mutual mud-slinging on some platform and nothing more.

If you have evidence (as you seem to be confident about), have you, may I ask, initiated legal action, or are happy with mere sharing discontent? Even assuming that the whole galaxy of scholars offer unstinted support to the cause, does it change the situation one bit if no action is taken ultimately?

Anyhow, it is up to the moderators to see what is meet.
