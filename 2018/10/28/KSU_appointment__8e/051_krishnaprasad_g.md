Nobody is cared about the corruption here.,if so, then that would lead to legal implications. Nobody has said here that someone is involved in the corruption and dragging anyone's name. (The earlier names were brought only to expect replies I guess)

  

Then what !  

My only concern(and I hope everyones too) here is, there are people here whose hierarchical position is high. Like VCs Registrar Professors, and they are the people, who hire, or part of hiring, and are continuously participating, currently and in future too.

Why this discussion is not taking academically like, forming and framing some strong committee and rules such as only academic certificates are not sole criteria for the acaedimc post.

  

Ain't this confined to academics?
