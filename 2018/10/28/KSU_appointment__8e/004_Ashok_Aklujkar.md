I do not know from the following English text who exactly is asking for the meaning of the verse. Anyway, I am stating how I understand the verse on the assumption that caṇakaº is a typo for caṇakāº and abhyūṣạ means a cake-like or वडी-like preparation:

  

“O donkey, why are you eating a low-quality morsel on account of carrying a load of clothes (because you rendered the service of carrying a load you are being fed whatever the owner found for you; like potters, washermen/dhobīs used — and still use -- donkeys to carry their loads). Go to the stable of the king (and) eat the chick-pea cakes (there) freely/happily. Those who are in charge here callt all tailed-ones ‘horses’. The ruler takes only what they say as the truth. Others remain uninvolved /quiet."

  

This is a beautiful anyokti or allegorical verse, agreeing with the point intended in the posted email.

  

See Monier Williams under abhyūṣa.
