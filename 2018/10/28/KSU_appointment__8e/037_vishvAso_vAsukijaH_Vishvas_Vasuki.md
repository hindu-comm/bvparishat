Evidence, sir.

Moderators should use their best judgement on what to allow based on evidence. To treat the thief and the sage with equal exclusion is analogous to "secular" equal treatment of desert cults and dharma.

I don't know what BVP's bye-laws are - so can't answer. Who made them? Settled comfortable seniors without skin in the game? Can't they be changed?

Chronicle of Higher Education carries occasional articles on corruption - <https://www.chronicle.com/article/How-Academic-Corruption-Works/244703> .

I don't think that is a serious risk - Posters are the primary violators - and they're not anonymous. BVP can apologize and remove the posting. Or moderators can post an explicit statement on its site for record: "BVP does not endorse or deny these allegations, all views belong to the posters." (as is common practice in corporate emails.)  
  
More to the point, every worthwhile thing in life comes with risk - it is futile to want respect and standing without accepting the associated risk.
