आर्य JSR prasAda,

  

Your point about not being guarded about announcing one's opinion of the forum and some moderator is well taken. I just wanted to post a tangential remark in response to your note "May I submit that still we recite '..जिह्वा मे मधुमत्तमा । कर्णाभ्यां भूरि विश्रुवम्।..' irrespective of variations in Northern/Southern Vedic intonations. Satyam and Rtam are eternal irrespective of times no.". While that's true, it is also true that every practising Apastambin should be saying a variations of ते यं द्वि॒ष्मो यश्च॑ नो॒ द्वेष्टि॒ तं वां॒ / वो जंभे॑ दधामि । no less than 8 times every single night this season as part of sarpa-bali-upasthAnam. That we think in simplistic terms may be correlated with our own fall in terms of anuShThAna. bhartRhari put it well I think-  
  
दाक्षिण्यं स्वजने दया परजने शाठ्यं सदा दुर्जने प्रीतिः साधुजने नयो नृपजने विद्वज्जनेष्वार्जवम्।  
शौर्यं शत्रुजने क्षमा गुरुजने नारीजने धूर्तता ये चैवं पुरुषा: कलासु कुशलास्तेष्वेव लोकस्थितिः।।
