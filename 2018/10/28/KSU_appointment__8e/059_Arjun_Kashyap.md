Thanks to all the scholars who are somehow responding on the issue.

  

"यथा राजा तथा प्रजाः" if the head of the institute, so-called VC is promoting all this, how can other Co-workers respond directly, may be that made them to post the issue in this forum hoping a solution.

One of the member suggested that why can't we take it to the media etc. Really i thank for the suggestion.

Hereby am taking it to the Karnataka state media and later to the national media. Hope we can see some solution for the incident.

  

Being a young Gardner i must be aware of moths, which can destroy the entire garden.
