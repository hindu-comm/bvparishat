Shree Vishvas-ji,

,

We tried it on some earlier occasions.

  

Google groups system/software does not provide for deleting individual messages by individual members of a thread by the management.

  

Moreover, as long as the thread remains , not deleted , the control by the management not to allow further posts to the thread does not work. The "lock " command in the google groups system did not work on many earlier occasions.

  

In addition to this, discussing general conditions prevailing in system with regard to recruitment etc. citing a specific incident as case in point is different from discussing that specific incident and the specific individuals.
