Respected Prof. Ashok Aklujkar,

  

Who is asking for the meaning is Dr Ramanand Chatterjee-ji. He was the initiator of the thread under question. Once the thread was closed by me he came up with the post asking for the meaning of the verse. I understood the anyokti in the post apart from and conveyed through the one in the verse, because I was not able to believe that the learned scholar-member really did not know the meaning.As such, I did not allow the post seeking the meaning. In a later post to a new thread, I said that it was interesting that respected Dr Krishnaprasad-ji too posted exactly the same verse as the one for which Dr Ramanand Chatterjee-ji
wanted to know the meaning. My assumption that Dr Ramanand Chatterjee-ji was asking for the meaning despite himself knowing the same was proved right with the following post by him (Dr Ramanand Chatterjee-ji. ):

-----------------------------------------------------------

The discussion on an appointment at KSU was started by a post sent by Dr Ramanand Chatterjee-ji mentioning a link to a video of an 'interview at KSU'

  

After being repeatedly asked through offline messages by Dr Ramanand Chatterjee-ji to allow the post, I started a deliberation in the management group whether to publish the same or not. When I realised that other members were feeling delicate to respond to my opinion seeking with regard to the question of whether to allow the post or not, I took my decision to allow the post. Venerable scholars such as Prof. Wakankar discussed the issue in a general fashion without going into the names of individuals. But when I found that the issue was dwindling into names of individuals and interpersonal organisational issues not connected with the topic, I first asked not to digress into such directions. But it occurred to me that it was better to close the thread. I did that and received the appreciation of respected senior members such as Prof. Kannan for that decision.

  

In response to those admirations, Dr Ramanand Chatterjee-ji sent a message saying, "I really hate Paturi. Aji Gargeswasri was an excellent moderator.".

  

I did not allow that post too to get published on the list.

Hope this helps.
