Dear Prof.Paturi,

  

I fully am aware of the problems of the persons at the helm,who carry out their duties diligently and most objectively,though,their attitude may not be liked by some one.

  

It was very appropriate that you closed this thread with much caution and prevented the flow of personal vendetta,because,many scholars are hurt by this kind of attitude of the authorities.It so happens that under the influence of feelings,emotions and the abhinivesha,many persons cannot remain objective, because,the subjective element does peep in and later it creates problems.

  

Thanks for your timely wisdom.

  

May you exercise this control in future too,saving the scholars from ignomy.

  

Best luck.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
