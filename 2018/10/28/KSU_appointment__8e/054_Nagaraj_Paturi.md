Sri Kiran-ji brought up the issue of lack of rigour in the procedures of awarding those academic certificates such as PhD itself.

  

That is one of the root causes of bad recruitment.

  

If rigour is insisted at the stage of awarding academic certificates such as PhD poor quality of recruitment can be nipped in the bud.
