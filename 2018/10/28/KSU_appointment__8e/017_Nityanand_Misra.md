I agree with Vishvasa that deletion of the thread was not required. Locking the thread or not allowing future posts is understandable, but deleting the thread altogether sends out a wrong message, i.e. BVP censors/expunges discussions on uncomfortable topics. If legal avenues are available forairing/registering/seeking redressal as Prof. Kannan said, then legal avenues are also available for suing somebody for making a defamatory post on BVP. The video speaks for itself.It is a serious issue if the person who was being interviewed was appointed to teach at a Sanskrit University. Can we afford to be silent spectators to daylight robbery?

  

It is good that BVP is completing ten years. It should get a legal status, as some people have suggested in the past. Perhaps the *parishat* can be registered as a society.
