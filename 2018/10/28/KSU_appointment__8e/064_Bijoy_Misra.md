My thinking is Prof Upinder Rao has an obligation to comment.

He posts here and is a seasoned scholar.

He was possibly there as an "expert" as I have heard about interviews in India.

The situation could be similar in most appointments.

In many situations the candidate is pre-selected.

It happened to me in my youth. In a couple of occasions, the interview was arbitrary.

In the third, I was pre-selected ( I had won a scholarly prize etc). I declined my selection.

It was the early days of the formation of ISRO, Indira Gandhi was in power.

Then political turmoil increased and I left the country to protect my parents.
