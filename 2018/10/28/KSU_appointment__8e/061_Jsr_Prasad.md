Kautilya spoke about 40 ways of corruption in administration and governance. It has penetrated so deep to the root level in all sections of society. Academic field is not an exception. Some academicians can be more corrupted because they are 'intellectuals' and can smartly manipulate the system. Furthermore, scholarship has nothing to do with one's character. Even without proper education, some people are 'clean' in character. After all, character is an inner trait based on sukrta!

  

A Samskrit University is in news due to corruption in appointing faculty members sends wrong signals to the higher authorities and creates a negative perception of individuals/institution. Enthusiastic students to pursue Sanskrit study at that particular place, would definitely dwindle (this can be understood from the blog of KSU students).

  

Appreciationto the young forum members and KSU students for their constant efforts to dig out truth from the rubble of recent corruption at KSU. I, too, am against corruption concerned with any individual or institution. So, let me just echo what Prof. Kannan Ji, had said in his recent mail and I extend my full support to the cause. How far BVP is an effective medium to voice the concerns is, indeed, being debated now.  

  

Next, Sri Vishwas's optimism is admirable. But, that should reflect in a positive speech; vaak-paaruShyam cannot be condoned, which I reminded respected members recently. How can one could achieve one's goal, when one ignores the age old saying - ..परैर्विवादे सम्प्राप्ते वयं पञ्चोत्तरं शतम् .. Main issue should not be digressed.

  

Due to alleged corruption, a VC (in-charge) of Pondicherry University was removed in past from her duties and it become an issue at UGC level. Court accepts all kinds of evidences and a video is not an exemption. However, one may face defamation (luxury litigation in India!) if charges levelled against someone are unproven.
