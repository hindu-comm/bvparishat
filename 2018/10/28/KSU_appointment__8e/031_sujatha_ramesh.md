I second the opinion of Vishwas and Mishraji. Removing the post /shying away from the facts does not solve the issue. I think the intent of the other honorable member of the Parishad was to convey the ground reality. Abusing the scholarly community (right in front of the students) by the concerned VC is a regular practice at KSU. We as students feel very depressed when our beloved scholarly professors (names mentioned earlier) are not treated well. You can check the kind of feedback we, the students of KSU documented few months back in this blog (Check the other testimonials as well. Here we all students hailed the professors)

Please pay attention to highlighted texts in the attachments (content is from the above blog)

  

In effect, the current issue is about the***rampant corruption and the inflow of low-pedigree professors in to KSU***than anything else. I hope these inputs help us to regroup and focus on the potential solutions for this problem.
