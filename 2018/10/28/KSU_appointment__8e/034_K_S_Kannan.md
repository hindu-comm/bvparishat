I understand very well the concerns of Sri Vishwasa/Misra and others on the one hand, and of Smt. Gayatri Indavara and Sujata Ramesh and others on the other. It is true that corruption needs to be exposed, and that people need to be on guard against the corrupt.

  

But the only problem is : How do we handle issues when somebody makes false accusations on the forum? Let us say I apply for a job, and someone else gets it. I may accuse people of unfair play, and it can even be true sometimes. But what of cases where my assessment is wrong, or when I am just frustrated and furious, and so make the accusations? And what if the corrupt make counter-accusations on the same platform? Who will determine the truth and how?

  

Is BVP to address all such issues? Do its bye-laws declare that this is a forum for airing all ills that beset Sanskritists? We may do well perhaps to see how other academic fora handle this, and whether there are some useful lessons for us. And lastly, what if someone sues BVP tomorrow for allowing libel on its platform? Or is it impossible? Or are there easy escape routes?

  

These are my broad and generic concerns. If someone can come up with constructive suggestions as regards how to handle these,

I am sure everyone on the forum will be benefited.
