My praNAms to all the prominent scholars,

  

Dear sir,

If the discussion is about a terrible incident related to VidvwAn-s, that too in a forum monitored by the same group of scholars or Co-scholars, what can be a better option rather than deletion or prohibition of mails.

Moreover, people are no where bothered about the incident, and don't want to discuss on the issue but they strongly react when some of the scholars, part of the incident is questioned.

Again all may think I am a victim of kSU issue, so I am commenting on individuals. But I am no where connected to the incident and am not even abusing any individual, being a Sanskrit person I really feel tremendous pain after seeing the video clip, that's the only reason to raise the voice here.

  

Here, one can be part of a nasty incident and later he can draft a mail proving himself an innocent and that can be posted by a friend in behalf of him, this kind of activity is allowed in this forum without any regrets..

  

Finally this thread will be deleted in a while.

  

Thanking you.

Arjun Kashyap.
