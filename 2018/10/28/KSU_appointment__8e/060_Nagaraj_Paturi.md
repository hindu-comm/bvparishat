I too am surprised at your assumptions. Words about rigour in PhD are not intended to be any correction of any mistake. They are intended to bring back the discussion to the right track. Adults using juvemile expressions such as throwing some easy biscuits do not suit the dignity of either the speaker or the forum , meaning of the expression does not fit the context.
