I am very confident that the answer to this is yes. To explain, the corrupt belong to several categories -  
a\] ie "expectably brazen, and care two hoots about calumniation over fora."  

b\] those who are conscious about their "image" (ie what will happen to their reputation if caught participating and cooperating in corrupt appointments).

  

In the interview both categories of persons are present. The second category is what the video presenters tried to target, I infer.

Every single person here who has seen the video has whatever evidence was presented, if he/she is sharp enough. Each of us can do one little bit to pursue other modes of action (contacting news orgs, higher authorities etc.. though I don't have much faith in the latter). Whatever they do, it would be stupid of them to announce it in public in answer to questions such as this.
