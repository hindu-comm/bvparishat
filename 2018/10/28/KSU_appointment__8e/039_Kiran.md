Having listened to a bit of this discussion... the fundamental question in my mind... How did the candidates in Video 1 and 2,  

secure a PhD ?  

  

I forget the subjects, but both candidates mentioned PhD.. the second video candidate has worked on Aalankara Sashtra but has  

no clue of Upama.. Can this be possible ? The corruption in selection was possible because an unworthy candidate had a PhD.  

One can understand how degrees are secured without being worthy of it, but how can PhD be ?

  

Thanks..
