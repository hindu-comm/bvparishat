shrI nAgarAj - Closing the thread and prohibiting responses makes sense (maybe), but could you please clarify why did you deleted the thread? you could have deleted just the offending messages within the thread. Owing to your deletion, offending parties might just be laughing their way to the next "interview". Beyond a certain point, restraint becomes something negative.  

  

shrI kaNNan - The part of your message where you say "There could very well be other authentic and licit avenues for the airing/registering/seeking redressal of the iniquities that individuals/systems are open to or prone to." partly does not make sense. Discussing individuals may reasonably be declared out of scope, but discussing the system "vidvat"-s work in should very much be within the ambit of "vidvat pariShat". Without such open discussions, I am afraid some "vidvat"-s will continue to appoint imbeciles without a shade of shame. Where else would vidvat-s be expected to conduct such discussions online?
