I really appreciate your comments. But, I think, you read between the lines of my response. You may please read my message again! Sole intention of quoting that sloka is not to prevent naming or shaming scholars involved in that episode. I am in no way connected to that episode, people or institution. That was just an attempt to remind a respected member not to -

  

\- hate the Moderator

\- call this august forum as so-called Bharatiya Vidwat Parishat

  

This applies to me, you, Sri Nagaraj or any member of this forum. May I submit that still we recite '..जिह्वा मे मधुमत्तमा । कर्णाभ्यां भूरि विश्रुवम्।..' irrespective of variations in Northern/Southern Vedic intonations. Satyam and Rtam are eternal irrespective of times no.  

  

Prof. Nagaraj might have deleted the thread helplessly as his system is not configured on the lines that you rightly pointed out. But, being a Moderator of another forum, you must be experiencing how unpaid and thankless the Moderator's job is.

  

Unfortunately, this discussion took a different turn and purpose of initiating the very thread in question, by Sri Ramananda Chatterjee ji, is seemingly lost.

  

So far, I did not comment on that video episode, here is my single most remark of Bhagavan Badarayana, applicable to the involved -

  

ऊर्ध्वबाहुर्विरौम्येषः न च कश्चिच्छृणोति माम् ।

धर्मादर्थश्च कामश्च स धर्मः किं न सेव्यते ॥

  

Thanks!
