I may point out one very important point.

  

Corruption cannot be uprooted unless and until some Sanskrit scholars enjoying higher positions do not oppose to such practices.If they stop supporting such authorities with a greater stress on quality,automatically,the things will change for the better.

  

Who,however,will show such a kind of courage at the cost of his position etc. Is the.main point.

  

Best luck.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
