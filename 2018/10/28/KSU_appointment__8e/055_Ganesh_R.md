Dear and respected scholars,

  

I am following all the mails in this thread and honestly feel that the stand of youngsters like Sri. Krishnaprasad and Sri. Vishvas Vasuki are more convincing and true to the spirit of sanaatanadharma. The learned senior members too would have noticed this. Any stand of convenience, to that extent, weakens the spirit of such forums. Yes, I do know that a scholar need not become an activist and he or she too being a common person in all other respects, intrinsic weaknesses and situational helplessness are bound to occur in handling such situations and arriving at a commendable stand. But not even ready to gaze at the problem, that too from a "safe distance" is paining.

  

With warm regards

  

Ganesh
