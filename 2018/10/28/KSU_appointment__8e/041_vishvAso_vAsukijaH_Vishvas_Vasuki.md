Dear shrI kaNNan,

  

Reiterating the greatest respect I have for your and others' scholarship and gentle sentiments, I clarify that my comments are meant to be taken constructively by the mailing list admins and their implicit and explicit supporters. Your concerns were reasonable and I tried to address them the honestly; but I still think that your express support for shrI nAgaraj's moderation actions were quite mistaken. Moderation is a complex task involving moral dilemmas (unless one reduces it to mechanically following "by-laws"), and so such mistakes on the part of the moderators' or even yourself are quite natural and unavoidable - as great examples from the epics show. Though as a follower of father manu I personally recoil from "prestige", I too would like BVP to be blameless (and prestigious) - not among corrupt / silent profs who select incompetents to teach the next generation - but among (past/ present/ future) shiShTa-s whose scholarship does not come with cowardice. One should ask oneself what real shiShTa-s would think. üôè
