Dear All... Respected Scholars and fellow students/enthusiasts.

  

I am a current student at KSU, with humble beginnings in Samskrit. I am doing my best to get knowledgeable.

  

The discussion on the issue has turned from the issue, to whether the issue is to be discussed at all.  

  

Since the issue at hand is clear.. lets see what can be done to address it.

  

As students, it affects us a lot if we get a Sahitya-teacher who cant give a single example on upama or cant  

pronounce a word correct. We are doomed before we even begin. As of now, the institute is more of a  

adult-education system, where most of us are professionals enrolled out of interest and enthusiasm. What

we get out of the institution makes a lot of difference to us; and might make or break our enthusiasm.  

  

Having said that... What can we do ?

  

1\. As students (with no union) we will give an undertaking that, we request a academically strong institution in  

terms of entry-criteria, faculty, research possibility etc. After-all its tax-payers money that the Institution uses.

Its a great thing to have such a University right in the middle of the city with easy access, in the first place.

For building such an organization, we as students will provide our utmost support. This undertaking will be

posted to HRD as well.  

2\. If enough students agree and willing, we will try to get all the faculty, governing-body and students together and

discuss the ways in which the University can become one among the best. This has to be done without reference

to the videos etc. in question; else the whole meeting would become a defensive Arnab show !

Your suggestions are welcome.  

  

Thanks and regards,

Kiran
