The point raised by Sri Vishvasa/Misra is quite proper.

But the problem is where and how we draw the line between

addressing systemic illness and naming/shaming particular individuals.

The issues become delicate - as systems cannot be isolated from individuals,

and proving/disproving charges become uncomfortable, even if indeed possible,

on an academic platform.

  

As not all mails can be practically scrutinised before publication on the platform,

it becomes inevitable for the moderator to exercise some restraint and

give some ruling the moment things tend to become uncomfortable/undignified:

limiting liberty listlessly lest the list lowers to be a locus of limitless libel.
