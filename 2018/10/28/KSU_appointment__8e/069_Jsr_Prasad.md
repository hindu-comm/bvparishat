I appreciate Prof. Varakhedi ji for his timely intervention and clarification.

  

Respected Prof. Kannan, you are so polite and sensible in sending your responses. Everyone is going through all exchanges in this thread. It is crystal clear from your responses, where exactly you stand in this issue. Indeed, we must thank you for analysing the matter at hand and trying to justify even from the Moderator's side. In academic discussions, one could encounter very few scholars like you, who always maintain a positive attitude!

  

Regards
