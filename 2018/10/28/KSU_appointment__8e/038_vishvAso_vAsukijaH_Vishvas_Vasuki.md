I would like to slightly expand on this with particular reference to the particular case in question.

One might answer the following questions:  

  

\- Is it abundantly clear that an incompetent person was selected to be a professor of Sanskrit language and literature?

\- Is it abundantly clear that this selection had happened well before the sham interview?

\- Is it abundantly clear that such preselection was announced by one person right in front of other interviewers?  

(Lot more inferences can be made, but this should suffice for the following.)

  

\- Can one expect a reasonable person to respect an academic forum or its chief constituents if they mostly don't even have the courage to say these plain \*facts\* (not opinions or accusations) aloud in public despite being securely placed in terms of livelihood etc.? On top of it, what if they even actively prohibit and suppress its such public statement of \*facts\* by others? On top of it, what if they clothe such actions in terms of bye-laws, "system vs individual" and propriety? (With apologies since I tend to think in terms of itihAsa-s, this is beginning to sound a lot like some mahAbhArata characters.)  

  

One suggestion I have with regards to the bye-laws, what ever they are - on top of it should be clearly written - "Shruti, smRti and purANa-s are our ultimate guide beyond the following laws."
