Arya shrI nAgarAja,  

  
I am moderator of a mailing list called sanskrit-programmers, and I just checked that one can delete individual posts in a thread - please see this screenshot - <https://i.imgur.com/4cCVu8m.png> . If you cannot do the same, it is a configuration problem at your end. You need not have deleted the entire thread. The rate of response was not so huge as to overwhelm moderation.  
  

You quoted the following message to justify your deletion:

Did it occur to you to check with the persons named if they favoured deleting the thread? Just a couple of phone calls would have done. I quite sure (like 100% in some cases) of the fact that personally working (or having worked) in the midst of such corruption and downfall, they would have been most grateful to have the problem discussed in this mailing list.  

  

You can still republish the thread yourself while specifying the terms and conditions of discussions that will be allowed. That would assuage all parties involved, I think.  
  
shrI JSR prasAd quoted manu "पारुष्यमनृतं चैव पैशुन्यं चापि सर्वशः । असम्बद्धप्रलापश्च वाङ्मयं स्याच्चतुर्विधम् ॥", but we're not living in manu's society, and even revered father manu provided for shaming and exclusion IIRC. shrI kaNNan mentioned his concerns about naming/ shaming - but if indeed this pariShat has impartial members then that should not be a problem as there will be people to call out untenable accusations. I myself have participated in a few heated debates here, and nothing - barring the moderator overreach - stopped me from responding to misrepresentation. As shrI kaNNan said, it might be "uncomfortable", but it should not be avoided - well established senior people can afford comfortable silent dignity - but not junior people and future generations of scholars who will pay the price. I agree with revered vRkodara that notions propriety should not paralyse one too much -
