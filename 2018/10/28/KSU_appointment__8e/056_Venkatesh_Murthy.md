Namaste

In Mahabharata also there is Ekalavya incident. He was more qualified candidate than Arjuna to learn Dhanurvidya but Dronacharya was eating food of Hastinapura and he loved Arjuna. He made Ekalavya sacrifice his right thumb and become disqualified. I am not defending corruption but we must understand corruption has very deep and long roots in this country. It is uphill task to uproot this huge tree but at the same time we cannot be silent spectators. We must express our protests.
