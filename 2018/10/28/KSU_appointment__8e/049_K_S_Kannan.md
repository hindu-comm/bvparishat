Exactly. How many are still complacent regarding such issues!

When it is issues of malicious/misguiding ideology, things are straight enough.

No legal implications, mere academic differences of opinion/approach and debates.

*The forum is meant for academic debates, I guess.*

  

My limited point has been that when you accuse individuals of corruption, that can have legal implications.

Anyhow, this is the task of the moderators, and I have nothing to add here.
