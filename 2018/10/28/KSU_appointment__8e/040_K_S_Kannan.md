Dear Vishwas and others,

  

There is a great deal of truth in what you are saying.

  

But I tried to step into the shoes of a moderator, tough as his role is, and see difficulties from his perspective. I realise I do not have the equipment - of experience or legal info - required to handle situations like these. My only concern was the prestige of BVP, and I have no other stakes of my own. Those aggrieved, and those better equipped than me especially legally, can take things to their logical conclusions, and I guess I have not much to contribute to this discussion any further. I hope I have not offended anyone in the course of the deliberations thus far.
