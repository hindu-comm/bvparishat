Namaste

  

In this searchable doc of VasishTha dharma sutra, there is a mention of Yamagita, twice, with some verses cited therefrom.

  

<http://peterffreund.com/Vedic_Literature/kalpa/dharma/vasishtha_dharma_sutra.html>  

  

On a search on the net for a text of Yamagita, I got this:

  

<https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_giitaa/yamagiitaa.html?lang=sa>  

  

and another book. But the verses cited in the above mentioned doc are not to be found in these texts. Could anyone please throw more light on the Yamagita, the various texts and the one exactly cited in the ancient text Vasishta dharma sutra?

  

Thanks
