Subbuji,

  

The verse no. 14 is same as Manusmriti 4.80  

  

न शूद्राय मतिं दद्यान् नोच्छिष्टं न हविष्कृतम्  
न चास्योपदिशेद्धर्मं न चास्य व्रतमादिशेत् १४  
  

Instead of limiting the source to a text named 'Yamagita', we may also look for any text in which Yama is the speaker, such as Yamasmriti, Brihad Yama Smriti, etc. यमगीतान् श्लोकान् could also mean that the verses uttered by Yama.  

  

I already checked Yama Smriti available at online Peter Ffreund's website and could not find these verses.  

  

  

regards  
shankara
