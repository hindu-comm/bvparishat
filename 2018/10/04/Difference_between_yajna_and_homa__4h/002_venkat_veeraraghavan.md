Wow! I did not know that.

  

I just thought a Yajna was a large scale homa with many other attendant rituals like daanas, large scale bhojana, etc.

  

But what you say makes sense. In the Bhojana vidhi there is a line in the prayer that goes " tvam yajnastvam vashatkArastvam visnu purusah parah"

This also goes in with the notion of Vishnu as the Lord of the yajna.

  

Perhaps this is a throwback to the original sacrifice of Narayana mentioned in the pancharatra. The one that started all other sacrifices.

This also ties in with the imagery of vIrabhadra pursuing the yajnapurusa a deer (Vishnu is frequently represented as one).

  

This leads to the next question is it possible to assume that a homa is an offering to the internal fire while a Yajna is one to the primal fire as an appeasement? Surely there scope for the linguists to look into patterns wrt svAhA svadhA etc as somehow starting with "sva"

  

any thoughts on that?
