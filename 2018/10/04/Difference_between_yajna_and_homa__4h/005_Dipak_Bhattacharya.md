I noted the deliberations on yãga and homa. As a student of Bhūtanātha Saptatirtha and Pattābhirāma Sāstri I still remember their teaching that yāga is the whole affair of offering to the god or to God including saṃkalpa, tyāga and other paraphernalia while homa is the āhuti – that is āsecana pradhāna. It is long ago but I vaguely remember that both of them followed Cinnaswami Sastri’s Yajñatattvaprakāśa. There were other books too like the Ādhānapaddhati.
