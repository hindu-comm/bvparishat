Namaste,



There is difference between yAga and hOma.



kAtyAyana srauta sUtras differentiates between yAga and hOma.



" tiShTat hOma vaShaTkArapradAnA yAjyapuro(a)nuvAkyAvanto yajatayah " sayskAtyAyana.



When the yajna karta offers the dravya in the fire with" vaShaT " in standing position it is called yAga or yajana.

So, dravya-tyAga in standing position with vaSaT, vauSaT etc. is for yAga.



" upaviShTahomAh swAhAkArpradAnAh juhOtayah " which means when the yajna kartaoffers the dravyas uttering the " swAhA " in sitting position it is called Homa /

Havana. So, dravya-tyAga in sitting position with swAhA, juhOti etc. is hOma.



with regards,

sriram
