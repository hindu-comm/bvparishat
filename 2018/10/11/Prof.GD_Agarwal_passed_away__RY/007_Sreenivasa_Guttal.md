Pranav's mail has all the details that we need to ponder about, but the key question asked by Sri Veera Narayana pandurangi aacharya remains.....  

  

who is responsible for the death of such an outstanding knowledgeble person who was fighing a lone battle by fasting for 112 days at the age of 86 save the identity of this country?

  

  

In my view..

  

Bharatiya vidwat parishat.....

  

Please think and respond.
