To all in Bharatiya Vidvat Parishad,

  

It is unfortunate that even in his death, people are unable to learn more about what he was asking for.

  

Please read his Statement on Fast from this link:

<http://gangatapasya.in>

  

If you would like an article that captures his thought, read the
Swarajyamag Blog that we wrote in the light of the following:

  

“*nadī* *vegena* *śuddhyati/vardhate”*

*- Ages-old Indian Wisdom*

A river *cleans herself/flourishes* with swift flows

  

“*patiśokākulāṃ dīnāṃ śuṣkaśrotāṃ nadīmiva”*

-   *Maha Bharata III.65.13*

*Analogous relation exists between a wife distressed and filled with grief on account of her missing husband and a river whose source streams/flows are shrivelled*

Here is a petition that we started which still is valid except that Swami Sanand is no more:

Please read, learn and STOP thinking of "Cleaning Ganga" -- Ganga is eternally pure. She washes away sins - and has physical properties to kill bacteria and Coliform.

  

The release of sewage and effluents is WRONG in the first place according all our Dharmasastra-s. What goes on in the name of "Clean Ganga" is just treatment of sewage and effluents.

  

What is needed is "FLOWS in Ganga" which is being choked by dams/hydro-electric power projects which are economically as well as ecologically unsustainable in the delicate high seismic zone of Himalayas.

  

Please listen to Puri Shankaracharya's Directive to Government which they have not followed and they deserve all the shame for having let a sterling and committed human being to die for their incompetence to understand what is at stake:

As a student of Swami Gyan Swaroop Sanand, I would be glad to respond to all questions that you may have about him/his work.

  

Finally, please listen to this song which captures what Swami Sanand had in mind which is sung as a Plea to the Prime Minister:

May there be an awakening of Sakshi-Prajna of All Bharatiya-s at least now. I am attaching an image that summarizes the entire effort.

Pranav
