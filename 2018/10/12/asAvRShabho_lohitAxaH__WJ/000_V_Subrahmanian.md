Namaste

  

In the Vishnu Sahasra Nama Bhashyam, for the name 'lohitaakshaH', Shankaracharya has cited a vedic passage with the two words: 'असावृषभो लोहिताक्षः' इति श्रुतेः \| 

  

I am requesting help to locate the source of this mantra, along with the Sayana bhashyam, if any.

  

Thanks and regards
