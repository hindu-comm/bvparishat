Respected scholars,

I am looking for a compendium of example-verses, quoted in major Alankarashastra granthas. If the compendium contains the name of the poet and the source work, where known, alongwith the name of the granthaand the context where it is quoted, it would be very helpful. I will be grateful for any guidance on the matter.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
