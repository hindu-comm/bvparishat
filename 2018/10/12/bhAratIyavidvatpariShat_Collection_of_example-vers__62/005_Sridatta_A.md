There is "Prakrit Verses in Sanskrit Works On poetics" in Two Volumes by V.M. Kulkarni.  
Volume I contains the Prakrit and apabhraṃśa verses along with Sanskrit chāyā, Appendixes and Indexes.  
Volume II contains English Translation (with Introduction, Glossary and Notes)  
One may download both the books from <https://jainelibrary.org> .  
I don't know if similar books exist for Sanskrit verses.
