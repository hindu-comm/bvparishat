Long ago I too worked for the benefit of Dr Grimal, on bhavabhuti citations. all citations of bhavabhooti shlokas in different lakshnagranthas (32) were collected. I did not collect the computer files, Since I had nothing to do with kavyas, I think Dr Grimal has written something on it. Nevertheless, it was wonderful experience, especially reading srngaraprakasha of bhojan. Off course reading kavya is always a pleasure. Files must be with Anurupa Naik, librarian, on whose gist system I worked.
