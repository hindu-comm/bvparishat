Thank you very much, Prof.Aklujkar, for the trouble you have taken in guiding me.

I have soft-copy of (iii) listed by you and Vol.8 goes up toletter "Che" only. I am afraid I have no access to (i) and (ii) listed above. I also have hard copy of "subhashita-ratna-bhanDagara" of NirnaySagar.

I believe there is a general need for a compilation of the type I am looking for, if one does not already exist. Perhaps one of the Sanskrit Universities in India could take it up as a project.

Actually, I wanted to consolidate the verses of Valmiki Ramayan quoted and referred to in alankaraworks. Maybe, there is a research paper which meets my needs.

Thanks and Warm Regards,

GSS Murthy
