I am not aware of any book focusing comprehensively or exclusively on examples in the Alaṁkāra texts. However, the following may give a substantial start, since the anthologies of good poetry (subhāṣita-saṁgrahas) frequently derive their content from the Alaṁkāra-śāstra texts:

Ludwik Sternbach. (i) 1978, 1980. *A Descriptive Catalogue of Poets Quoted in Sanskrit Anthologies and Inscriptions.* 2 vols. Wiesbaden; Otto Harrassowitz.

(ii) 1974. *SubhåΩita, Gnomic and Didactic Literature.* Vol. IV of A History of Indian Literature. Gonda, J. (ed.). Wiesbaden; Otto Harrassowitz.

(iii) Mahå-subhåΩita-saµgraha. 8 volumes,available at<https://archive.org/details/MahaasubhaasitasamgrahaVol1-8>

  

In the edition of Vidyākara’s Subhāṣita-ratna-kośa prepared by D.D. Kosambi and V.V. Gokhale, Harvard Oriental Series, the notes frequently contain effort to trace the sources and authors of the Subhāṣitas.
