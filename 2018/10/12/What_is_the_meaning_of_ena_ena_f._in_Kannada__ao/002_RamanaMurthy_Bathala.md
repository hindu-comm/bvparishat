Dear sir,

Thanks for the reply.

The word ಎನ ena (f.) is an independent kannada word. I am referring the Kannada grammar book:

A MODERN CANARESE GRAMMAR-1899-Ed.I-A S MUD BHATKAL Page No.51

The context is the declension of nouns in Kannada and the author has given two words ಸೇವಕ (సేవక) and ಎನ (ఎన) as two feminine words. Please see the screen shot for more information.

1) ಸೇವಕ (సేవక) is a masculineword, but in the book it is given as feminineword. The feminine word is ಸೇವಕಳು (సేవకళు).

2) I tried to find the meaning of the ಎನ (ఎన) but could not get the convincing one. The meanig given does not look like feminine noun. See the screen shot.

(From : Dictionary Canarese and English by William Reeve)

I would be thankful if you provide the meaning and declensions in plural.

of ಎನ (ఎన)



One more doubt:

Here are the declensions of ಮಾತೃ (మాతృ).

Please see just the markings (to save time).

Grammatically, Genitive Plural has three forms:ಮಾತೃರ (మాతృర), ಮಾತೃಗಳ (మాతృగళ) and ಮಾತೃರುಗಳ (మాతృరుగళ).

The first one ಮಾತೃರ is given in the book. Can you please confirm the existence and usage of the other two forms viz., ಮಾತೃಗಳ and ಮಾತೃರುಗಳ.?



I searched on line for the word ಮಾತೃರುಗಳ but could not find even single occurrence.
