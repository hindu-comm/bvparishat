Hello Harshada,

  

  The first part of Svarita is Udātta and the latter part is Anudātta according to Pāṇini \[1.2.32\]. It is a combination of a rising+falling tone \[Pāṇini: samāhāraḥ svaritaḥ\]. However, according to several Prātiśākhyas \[R̥gveda-Prātiśākhya 3.45, Vaidikābharaṇa on Taittirīya-Prātiśākhya 1.41\], this initial part of the Svarita is Udāttatara, that is of a pitch higher than that of Udātta. It is this part of Svarita that produces the highest pitch level in recitation, compared to Udātta, making Udātta effectively the middle level.
