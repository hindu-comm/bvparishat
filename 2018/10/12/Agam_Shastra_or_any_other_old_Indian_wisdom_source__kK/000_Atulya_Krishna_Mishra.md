Pranam,

  

I'm an Agile coach by profession, working with organizations to help them change their delivery process, building highly productive team, streamlining business, coaching business people to understand VUCA world and need for change in org. Culture and their usual way of mechanical working.

  

I'm borrowing lots of ideas from 'old Indian Wisdom' to make people realize whatever is imposed on us in a nice pacakge from West in form of framework/methods/Methodology/process is basically already exist in our old Indian wisdom. Whether it's Ramlila analogy for self organized team work, leadership lessons from Ram/Krishna, Patience ,persistence ,mental equipoise etc.

  

In 'Agile Fraternity' culture change and org. (re)design is most talked topic these days. Lots of work has been done in this area where organization have started to move away from traditional command and control, hierarchical model to flat, green and teal Organizations.(i.e Holacracy, Re-inventing organizations)

  

I was in discussion with someone where he mentioned we can learn org. Design/restructuring from "Agam Shastra" and it's more effective.

Teal, holacracy theory of West is just mere a reflection of what we already have.

  

I searched a lot and lot anything related to it but in vain ( may be most of professionals, management folks like us even don't know whether or not such a idea also exist in old Indian wisdom)

  

Any source, from where I can learn more about it and potentially use it as a source to design a paper for a world class agile conference ?

  

Any help in this regard will be highly appreciated.

  
  

Best
