Namaste Atulya Krishna 

  

1. Thanks, as an agile \* coach, for borrowing lots of ideas from 'old Indian Wisdom' to make Organizations and Professional people realize whatever is imposed on us in a nice package from West in form of framework/methods/Methodology/process is basically already exist in our old Indian wisdom. Whether it's Ramlila analogy for self organized team work, leadership lessons from Ram/Krishna, Patience ,persistence ,mental equipoise etc.

  

2\.  In this post you are exploring the lead to explore and learn org. Design/restructuring from "Agam Shastra".

  

   Responding specifically for your question : \<Any source, from where I can learn more about it and potentially use it as a source to design a paper for a world class agile conference ? Any help in this regard will be highly appreciated.> :

  

a\) There are no ready made writings that can be quoted as they are. The statement that 'ancient Indian wisdom had every thing that any one discovers / invents is a matter of pride; but fails to answer a curious question: If you had it, what prevented you from practicing it first and leading the world ?

 A pointing statement that 'It is in India' helps to narrow down the focus and build a pride; but does not land the seeker at the right spot. To make a sure delivery, a postal mail address augmented with a zip code(and an e-mail/ land mark Contact number where necessary !) is needed.

  

b) Aagama Shaastra is only 10% input provider for the question you are exploring. The rest 90% information needs to be supplemented from other resources of 'Artha Shaastra and Dharma Shaastras'. 

  

c\) I would be glad to write a co-authored paper on this theme, show how AGILE can be moved to ' People environment from Software Code environment' and point out how the wisdom of traditional disciplines can help to usher in the upgrade of the paradigms presented in Six Sigma and Agile, and the holistic concept of CSR.

  

Please contact me off the list for details.

***\* What is AGILE ? :***Agile method is a **software development process** which mainly *aims to bring incremental development by encouraging rapid and flexible response to changes*. It follows a collective approach to project management which helps in reducing time-to-market significantly. Practices followed by agile can be applied to any knowledge-based complex creative development.

Six sigma and Agile are two different types of methodologies . Six sigma is a process improvement methodology and agile is a software methodology .  
While six sigma and Agile exist in multiple numbers of forms and exploited on similar lines of concepts, there is a stark difference in their views.
