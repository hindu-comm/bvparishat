Neema Majumdar and Surya Tahora are organizing a retreat to throw light on the spiritual teachings of Vedanta. This is intended to be an exposure to the Vedantic vision in a natural environment without any distractions, which can bring about a major shift in perspective and transform your entire life.[Neema Majumdar](https://www.discovervedanta.com/authors.htm)and[Surya Tahora](https://www.discovervedanta.com/authors-surya.htm)are both disciples of Swami Dayananda. The program will contain a small group of individuals from all over the world who are all interested in learning about the Self.

The**Kena Upanishad**starts with a direct and profound question: “Impelled by whom or in whose presence are we able to think, speak, breathe, see and hear?” The teacher answers this seemingly unanswerable question with amazing lucidity and makes his students see with clarity the nature of themselves. The teaching is both in a form of a dialogue and a compelling story of Lord Indra’s search for the truth.

In the chapter 6 of**Bhagavad Gita**, Lord Krishna unfolds to Arjuna the importance of meditation in transforming our vision of life and recognizing our connection with the universe. The practice of meditation helps us to unleash our talents, skills and contribute to the well-being of ourselves and others; and in the process, free ourselves from our afflictions.

During the retreat, the teaching of these two texts will be reinforced with meditation and dialogue sessions. More details about the retreat are available in this[brochure](https://www.discovervedanta.com/downloads/Brochure-Intensive-Retreat_Rishikesh_1-10-Dec-2018.pdf).

Indic Academy is willing to sponsor two participants to attend the retreat. If you are interested in this program, please send a mail to [indic...@gmail.com]().

**Date**: December 1st to 10th, 2018

**Location**: Swami Dayananda Ashram, Rishikesh
