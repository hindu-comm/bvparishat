Namaste,

  

Some people are passing strange news about the start of maharashtrian festival 'gudi padwa' and linking with celebrating of death of Sambhaji Maharaj by brahmana ministers.

  

The FB is being flooded with these sort of misleading information by certain hate-spreading groups which are to confusions and hatred.
According to them, Sambhaji was a shudra and those who killed him belonged to brahmana varna and thus 'gudi padwa' is a victorious celebration of annihilating a shudra.

  

I would like to know the actual reason behind celebration of 'gudi padwa' from maharashtrian scholars here. I think it is similar to our telugu new year 'ugaadi' that marks the herald of vasanta rithu which is a new year as per panchanga.

  

rgs,

sriram
