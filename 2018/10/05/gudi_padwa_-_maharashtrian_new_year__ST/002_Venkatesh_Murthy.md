Namaste

  

Due to elections next year this type of false information will be spread to divide Hindu votes by hook or crook. In earlier days also pseudo-secularists were dividing Hindu votes and winning election with minority votes. Same plan continues now also. It is vote bank politics. Expect more in the coming months.
