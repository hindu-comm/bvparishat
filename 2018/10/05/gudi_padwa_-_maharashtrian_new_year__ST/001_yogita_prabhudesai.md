Namaste,  
  
Maybe I am not the correct person to explain this. But what I know  
that I will share with you.  
  
The flooded messages about Sambhaji's death and Gudi Padwa is false.  
  
1)Gudi Padwa is an auspicious day celebrated as a New Year in Hindu Calendar.  
  
2)The Mughal Emperor, Aurangzeb was chasing Chhatrapati Sambhaji  
Maharaj as Aurangzeb wanted to conquer Swarajya. But Sambaji Maharaj  
didn't came to his hand for years. Finally, Aurangazeb caught Sambhaji  
Maharaj and his poet-friend Kavi Kalash. They both were first asked to  
get convert to Islam but they refused. So Aurangazeb tortured both of  
them for about 40 days. First, Aurangazeb ordered hot rods to be  
inserted in their eyes. Then they cut their tongue, nose , ears, etc.  
But not in a one go. Day by day they were tortured by removing their  
body parts. Still Sambhaji Maharaj and Kavi Kalash sustained. So,  
Aurangazeb thought to kill them on the day before Gudi Padwa. So this  
way, the auspicious day will get ruined. He slaughtered their bodies  
into pieces and threw it in the forest and declared their death.  
Villagers gathered those slaughtered pieces stitched them up and did  
the funeral on Gudi Padwa.  
  
There are the Samaadhis of Sambhaji Maharaj and Kavi Kalash near Pune  
where they were killed.  
  
So to whom we should blame? To Brahmins ? To Sambhaji? or to  
Aurangazeb? People only wants to blame. But do not want to listen the  
truth. :)  
  
I hope this will help you. :)  
  
Thanks,  
Yogita
