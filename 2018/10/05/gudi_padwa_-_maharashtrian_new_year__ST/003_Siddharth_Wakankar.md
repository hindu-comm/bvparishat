Suprabhat.

  

It is a pity and travesty of destiny that politicians say anything regarding Hindu festivals [etc.to](http://etc.to) promote their vested interest to fan the feelings of the gullible public to get their votes.

  

Almost every Hindu thing is represented in a new way under the garb of freedom of speech and fundamental right.

  

It beggars description and this has been the reason-along with a wrong interpretation of Ahimsa and Kshama-that has brought the downfall of our country.

  

Let the Almighty protect us by removing our doubts and giving us sadbuddhi to look to our roots.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
