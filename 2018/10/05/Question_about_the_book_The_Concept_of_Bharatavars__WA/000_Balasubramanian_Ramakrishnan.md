namo vidvadbhyaH,

  

Has anyone read this book (<https://www.sunypress.edu/p-6607-the-concept-of-bharatavarsha-an.aspx>) by Prof.Chattopadhyaya? It seems relevant to a paper that I am writing, especially chapters 7 and 8. It is available for a lesser price in India, but I was wondering if anyone here has some opinions about the book. I am likely to buy the book either way and I think I know what to expect after reading this:<https://scroll.in/article/852113/history-shows-that-bharatavarsha-has-not-always-been-the-same-thing-as-the-country-of-india>

  

But I am curious if anyone has read it and about their opinions.

  

Ramakrishnan
