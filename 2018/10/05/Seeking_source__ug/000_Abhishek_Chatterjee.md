Respected scholars,

I am looking for any source from scriptures regarding the Legend surrounding the famousmathematicalPuzzle[Tower_of_Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi#cite_note-2).

From Wikipedia--"The puzzle was invented by the[French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_people "French people")[mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician "Mathematician")[Édouard Lucas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89douard_Lucas "Édouard Lucas")in 1883. There is a story about an[Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India")temple in[Kashi Vishwanath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashi_Vishwanath_Temple "Kashi Vishwanath Temple")which contains a large room with three time-worn posts in it, surrounded by 64 golden disks.[Brahmin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmin "Brahmin")priests, acting out the command of an ancient prophecy, have been moving these disks in accordance with the immutable rules of Brahma since that time. The puzzle is therefore also known as the Tower of[Brahma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahma "Brahma")puzzle. According to the legend, when the last move of the puzzle is completed, the world will end.^([\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi#cite_note-2))

If the legend were true, and if the priests were able to move disks at a rate of one per second, using the smallest number of moves it would take them 2⁶⁴−1 seconds or roughly 585[billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1,000,000,000 "1,000,000,000")years to finish,^([\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi#cite_note-3))which is about 42 times the current age of the Universe."

Is such a legend anywhere to be found in any Indian scripture?
