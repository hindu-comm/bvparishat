Respected Scholars,

   During translating from Russian "Sketches of Ceylon and India" I came across a long passage quoted from "The Theistic Annual, January 1872", but translated into Russian by Prof Ivan Minayev. If this reference is available online anywhere, I could quote directly the English version instead of translating the Russian text back to English.

   Thanks and regards.

   Narayan Prasad
