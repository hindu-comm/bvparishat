The colonial state of India continues to wreak needless destruction on Indian traditions. The state-sanctioned violence in Sabarimala brings  
great sadness to me, but worse, I'm not very surprised. This is sadly but a symptom of state-sanctioned inequities in Art. 25-30 in India.  
  
The key word in these articles is "essentially religious" - a completely undefined term. Unlike Christians (and other people of the book),  
we have neither a shared understanding of what "religion" is; let alone what "essentially religious" is. Yet, by forcing absurd laws in these  
ambiguous terms, Indian peoples have signed the death warrant of their traditions - weak as they are after a millenium of tireless destruction.  
  
In the wonderful work of Jakob de Roover talks about this with great clarity. I beseech people to put serious thought into the theology whose  
logic we've come to internalize, but whose epistemologies remain entirely alien to us.
