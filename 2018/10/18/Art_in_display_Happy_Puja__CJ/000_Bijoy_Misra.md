Dear friends,

I belong to Puri in Odisha, but grew up in a town called Cuttack.

Cuttack was a port city and active in gold and sliver trade with the

Far East. The local artisans developed a massive industry of

filigree that they supply to the world of art. There is a tradition

of display of their work annually through the Puja. Every street

produces its own style and brilliance. Here is the video of this

years's work sent to me by a friend.

Happy VijayaDasami.
