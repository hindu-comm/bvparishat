It is not a single word यन्तः in all the occurreces. In the first lineसेपुर्महो**यन्तः it is present participle शत्रन्त \_**

**इण् गतौ + शतृ = यन् - यन्तौ - यन्सः plural of the word यत्!**

**The two others**

देवयन्तः महो राये चितयन्तः

are in the same way, plural forms of**शत्रन्त s देवयत् and चिन्तयत्! The first derived from a nominal root नांधातु from the word देव derived with णिच् suffix conjugated as देवयति - देवयतः - देवयन्ति! शत्रन्त is declined as देवयन् - देवयन्तौ - देवयम्तः!**

**The third चिन्तयन्तः is derived from a root चिति समृत्याम्, चुरादिः with शतृ suffix declined as चिन्तयन् - चिन्तयन्तः here the plural form of चिन्तयत्! The root is declined as चिन्तयति - चिन्तयतः - चिन्तयन्ति**

**Hope you will understand what is शतृ suffix. It is prescribed by the a Paninian rule लटः शतृशानचावप्रथमासमानाधिकरणे**३।२।१२४।
