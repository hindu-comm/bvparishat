Thanks, sir for your blessings.

  

Hope is that this will inspire people to realise the value of their work in furthering the field in stead of thinking of routinely completing the formalities in order to acquire a degree. Once they realise the value of their work and get a confidence that that will have a good reception and impact , they can work with greater excitement and will feel the incentive for the efforts that they put in.

  

Thanks again and deep regards,
