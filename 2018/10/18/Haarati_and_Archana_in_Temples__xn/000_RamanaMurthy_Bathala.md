Dear Sir,

  

  Performing Haarati whenever a devote enters a temple and archana (quoting name and nakshatra etc.,) on the request of the devotee are common in the south Indian temples. It is the tradition in the south Indian temples.

  

  I visited a few small temples in North India (Gujarat). I have never seen performing Haarati and archana for individuals there.  
Is mine an isolated incident or is it common there?

  

Regards  
Ramana murthy
