Respected Scholars,

  namasaskAra !

  

  I want a soft copy, if available online, of "The Theist's Creed. Calcutta. 1874". A long passage from this reference also has been translated into Russian by Prof. Ivan Minayev. Google search did not display any result (on [archive.org/books.google.com](http://archive.org/books.google.com)).

 Thanks and regards

 Narayan Prasad
