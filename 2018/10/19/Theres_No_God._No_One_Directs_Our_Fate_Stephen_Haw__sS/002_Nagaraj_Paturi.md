As reported in the news, there are two different usages of God by him.

  

One in the sense of "laws of nature". In that sense, he talks as though he accepts the existence of God:

  

> 
> > He says he uses the word 'God' in an impersonal sense, like Albert > Einstein did, for the laws of nature, so knowing the mind of God is > knowing the laws of nature. >
> 
> > 
> > "My prediction is that we will know the mind of God by the end of this > century." >
> 

Christian God is a personal God.

The other sense is the "one who created the universe and one who directs our fate".

In that sense, he says, "it's my view that the simplest explanation is that there is no God. No one created the universe and no one directs our fate."
