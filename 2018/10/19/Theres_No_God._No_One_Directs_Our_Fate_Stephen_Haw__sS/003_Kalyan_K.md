Coincidentally, I am currently reading the Ayodhya kanda of Valmiki Ramayana, where a stoic Rama tells Lakshmana that his going to the forest is fate or destiny. Lakshmana counters by saying that brave men do not honour destiny. Lakshmana says we can overcome destiny by human effort. This debate about fate and human effort is age old.
