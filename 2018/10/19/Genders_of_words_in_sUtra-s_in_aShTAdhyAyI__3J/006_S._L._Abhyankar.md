That's an interesting angle, नागराज-महोदय !

My father taught me that an adjective, when describing, also eliminates other options. When saying "black cloth", all other colors get eliminated.

It also becomes appealing logic that, to be emphatic about elimination, the word क्रियार्थायाम् is placed after क्रियायाम् !

Am anxious to learn of your take on अर्थवदधातुरप्रत्ययः प्रातिपदिकम्
