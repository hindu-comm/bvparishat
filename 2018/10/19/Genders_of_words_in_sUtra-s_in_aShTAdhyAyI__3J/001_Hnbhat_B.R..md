Structure of each Sutra dictates tbe gender unlike Bhagavadgita slokas which follow the general rules for simple sentences. Not rhe 
विशेषण-विशेष्य-भावः of your choice and you like. In both, the first prescribed the suffixes tumun, and Nvul in the sense second part lays down क्रियार्थायां क्रियायाम् and here there is no विशेषण-विशेष्य-भावः
between the first part and second part, but in the second part only. In the second part, there is no विशेषण-विशेष्य-भावः as all are independent words and the last word प्रातिपदिकम् is संज्ञा and अर्थवत् शब्दस्वरूपम् is संज्ञि and two others are अधातुः and अप्रत्ययः are adjectives for शब्दस्वरूपम् but do not follow the gender of noun qualified as the are in tatpurusha comp and not bahuvrihi as you suggested!
