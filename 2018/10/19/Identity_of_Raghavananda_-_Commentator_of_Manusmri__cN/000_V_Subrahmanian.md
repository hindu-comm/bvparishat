Namaste

  

There is a six-commentary edition of the Manusmriti. One of the commentators is Raghavananda. Is there any information available about his identity? There is one Raghavananda, 13th Century CE, of Kerala who is said to have written a commentary to the entire Bhagavatam. He is also the author of the Sarvamata sangraha.Is he the one who wrote the commentary to the Manusmriti? From the commentary it is clear that he is an Advaitin.

  

  

Thanks
