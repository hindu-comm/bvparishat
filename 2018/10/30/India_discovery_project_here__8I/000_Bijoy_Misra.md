Friends,

  

I thought I would write a bit about our efforts here to clear my mind

and receive any feedback. Our over all goal is to create an educational

center for helping out high school and college students about India's

culture. The thrust is the view that the culture evolves, but rudimentary

humanity lives in the culture. India has been lucky not to have compromised

the basics of its fundamentals through the processes of history. But then the

question is what has been the path and what values can be analytically

cherished by the future youth of Indian descent. Our view is to record our

impressions as objectively we can and let the youth accept or reject.

Our first test with the youth would be next year spring.

  

In order to tackle the problem, we have been holding research seminars

every six months for the last two years. This Saturday would be our fifth

seminar. We divide India's known history into eight chronological periods:

Indus, Vedic, Classical (700BC-200BC), Golden (200BC-500AD), Hindu

(500AD-1500AD), Mughal (1500AD-1750AD), British (1750AD-1947AD)

and Current (1947AD- onwards). in every period we create six tracks:

Geography and People, Language and Literature, Philosophy and Religion,

art and Culture, Science and Technology, Economy and Politics. The

groupings and the periods were determined through an analytic reasoning

five years ago.

  

After studies and discussions, our efforts rest on discovering traits that

could summarize the period. The following pairs have evolved through

our work. Indus: Industry and Innovation, Vedic: Language and Organization,

Classical: Literature and Conduct, Golden: Aesthetics and Analysis.

We are at the period 500AD-1500AD, and the pair that is evolving

is Art and Design.

  

The point that triggered me to write this note is the strong trait of

individuality that apparently became a practice in the society during this

period. Individuality nurtured talents and excellent design work emerged.

New markets were found and trade flourished. Creative work received

patronage and state support. These are strong positive points of a talent

driven society where the individual excelled. India developed varieties

of food, dress, jewelry, expressions, drama, poetics and mathematics.

  

Individuality also possibly has its negative points, where the individual

gets contained and starts imitating. From a mode of self-expression, one

develops the talent of flattery and appeasement. We have not studied that

far, but I thought to write about it as I observe the present day activity of

many. Human insecurity possibly reduces one's trust in oneself and one

begins to depend on unknown objects. Shankara empowered people by

declaring freedom of man, but then the social and political system to

maintain the freedom of creativity became unstable.

  

When I prepare for the seminar, I wish to relive India a thousand years ago.

Dr JSR Prasad in the group helped me get some of the references. I can

share my Science and Technology slides after the seminar if anybody wants

to study. My friends Dr Paturi and Dr Iyengar have helped our efforts in various

ways. I am grateful to Prof Ashok Aklujkar and his wife Prof Vidyut Aklujkar

who first triggered a formal idea of discovery during their visit to Harvard in 2000.

Their visit was supported by Rajiv Malhotra's Infinity Foundation and I first

revealed my idea to Rajiv during that time.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
