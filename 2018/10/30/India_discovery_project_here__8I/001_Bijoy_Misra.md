I should have also added a context to the year 2000 i referred. I had

just returned from a cyclone relief trip to Odisha. Odisha was affected by

a massive cyclonic storm in 1999 Oct. I went on relief mission in Dec.

During this trip I saw misery and also saw the elements of human empathy.

Though I had thought about India before in various ways, the trip influenced

me to give time to refurbish my Sanskrit and study literature. I started teaching

Sanskrit with the aid of the book by Prof Madhav Deshpande, whom I contacted..

i trained many who are active in various ways in scholarship and leadership.

  

Thank you for reading this personal story.,
