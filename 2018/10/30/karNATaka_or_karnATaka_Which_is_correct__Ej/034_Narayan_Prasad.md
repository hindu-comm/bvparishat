\<\<I'm wondering if there are analogs of (1) and (2) above in Kannada language. For example, is there an old Kannada grammar which talks of how Sanskrit tadbhava and tatsama words are to be treated in Kannada language.>\>

  

Yes. Theशब्दमणिदर्पण of केशिराज (c.1260) does treat this point in detail. A sample page from F. Kittel's edition (1899) is attached herewith. The whole book of its 1920 edition is available here:
