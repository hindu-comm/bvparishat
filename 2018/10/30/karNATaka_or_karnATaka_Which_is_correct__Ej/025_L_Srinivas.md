raṣābhyām no ṇaḥ with aṭkupvāṅ etc clearly does not apply to Kannada language. Formally, Kannada itself would place a svarabhakti vowel after the 'r' or assimilate the 'r' to the following dental. Thus the form 'karnataka' in Kannada is a hybrid one. Does Kannada usage or Sanskrit grammar hold sway here?

  

It's a bit like Sanskritists saying one must write अन्ताराष्ट्रीय even while writing in Hindi whereas Hindi users have been merrily using अन्तर्राष्ट्रीय without any qualms. I daresay half the Hindi users do not even know that the latter form is not the sanctioned grammatical form. What's more, they don't care. If you have any doubts about it, just track the slow disappearance of anunāsika in modern written Hindi. It's being replaced by anusvāra everywhere.
