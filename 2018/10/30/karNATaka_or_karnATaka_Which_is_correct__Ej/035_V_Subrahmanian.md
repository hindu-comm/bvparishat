A news item today:

  

<https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/the-word-karnataka-has-existed-since-1336/article25466591.ece>  

  

# ‘The word Karnataka has existed since 1336’

  

//While former CM D. Devaraj Urs is credited with renaming Mysore State as Karnataka on November 1, 1973, according to historians, the word ‘Karnataka’ was in vogue some six centuries ago.//

  

But can't make out anything about 'Na' or 'na'. Maybe a Kannada edition of the above news will throw some light on this.
