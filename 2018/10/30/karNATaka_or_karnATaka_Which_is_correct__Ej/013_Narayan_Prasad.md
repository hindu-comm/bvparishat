Namaste.

  

To my knowledge, the best reference for this query is P.G. Kulkarni's "kannaDa bhASeya charitre" (History of Kannada Language), 1967.

The relevant pages (3-7) are attached as pdf.

In ch.2, pp.13-27, the etymologies of the words "kannaDa", "karNATa", "karNATaka" have been discussed.

  

The author says on p.3, last sentence, before the quotation of Ranganatha Kavi (c.1675):

""The three words 'kannaDa', 'karNATa', 'karNATaka' denoting both language and pradesha have been in use from 3rd century BC till today."

And then he quotes the actual use from literature starting from 17th century AD and going back up to 9th century AD. Later he quotes from inscriptions.
