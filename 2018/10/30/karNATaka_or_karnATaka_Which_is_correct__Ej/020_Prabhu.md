ShrIpAd-ji, Many interesting and speculative points!

  

1\. Regarding:  

"Somehow it is difficult to connect etymology of Karnataka with Kannada. How does the "r" come in ?"

My understanding is, "**rN**" sound in the transformation

karNATaka ==> kannadDa might be similar to

dharma ==> dhamma where the "**rm**" gets morphed into the dvittva of the type "**mm**".

Likewise "**rN**" to "**nn**" in the former case.

  

(slightly off the main topic of this thread)  

2\. Regarding:

"दीर्घोच्चार and the adaptation of the देवनागरीअवग्रह ऽ"  

My understanding is, in Sanskrit, **ए** and **ओ** are dIrgha only,
there are no hRsva forms of them...

the reason being **ए** (= अ + इ) and **ओ**(=अ + उ) are each a combination two hRsva swara-s.

In other languages like Kannada there exist, natively, both hRsva and dIrgha forms like **ಎ ಏ** and **ಒ ಓ**.  

  

Regards

Prabhu
