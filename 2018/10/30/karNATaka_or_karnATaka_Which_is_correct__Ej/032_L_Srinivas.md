It's a good point to be taken with following additional observations:

  

1\. Tamil language never uses 'damila'/'dramiDa', or 'aravam' being Skt andTelugu designations respectively for Tamil language. 'tamiḻ' is always used. The last letter is an 'l' with an underbar

  

2\. Tamil language has standard rules for Tamilizing Sanskrit words. These rules are codified already in the old Tamil grammar tŏlkāppiyam (written ca. 1-3rd cent AD). So the possibility of Sanskrit grammar rules being ascribed prescriptive authority over Tamil orthography simply does not arise.

  

I'm wondering if there are analogs of (1) and (2) above in Kannada language. For example, is there an old Kannada grammar which talks of how Sanskrit tadbhava and tatsama words are to be treated in Kannada language. If so, are rules of orthography discussed in such loci in those grammars?

  

Thanks,
