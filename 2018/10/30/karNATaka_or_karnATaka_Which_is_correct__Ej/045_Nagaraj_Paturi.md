The news article to which Sri V Subrahmanian-ji shared link says:

  

She says inscriptions show that the Karnataka empire was founded in 1336, with scholar Vidyateertha — the teacher of Vidyaranya — instrumental in it. Inscriptions also reveal that Vidyaranya did not exist at the time. The last great Hoysala ruler, Ballala III (1292-1342), started attempting to bring all of south India together, and the move yielded results in the time of Harihara I. “My historical conclusions are based on inscriptions and iconography I studied for nearly a decade. I don’t know why colonial historians glossed over the fact that the region was known as Karnataka and why post-Independence historians blindly followed Sewell. None of them is ready to take the truth head-on,” Ms. Filliozat says.  

  

with scholar Vidyateertha — the teacher of Vidyaranya

  

itself shows the poor information on the part of Ms. Filliozat.

  

Vidyateertha is not supposed to be referred to as a scholar . He was a swami.

  

teacher of Vidyaranya is also not accurate as per the tradition which the 'historian' is expected to be aware.

  

Moreover, there are records such as Raayavaachakamu, a first hand account of Sri Krishnadevarayalu's life. In that book, there comes a context where a karNeeka = accountant is called for and is asked to provide the balance sheet. The accountant starts by mentioning the opening balance saying, " When Sri Vidyaranya Muni founded the kingdom , the opening balance was ....... "  

  

-----------------------------------------------

  

Vidyanagara was the name of the capital.

  

Vijayanagara was the alternate name.

Calling a kingdom after the name of its capital is not uncommon even today.
