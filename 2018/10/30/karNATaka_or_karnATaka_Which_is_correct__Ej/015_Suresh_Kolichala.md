I have never heard this etymology. What is the source for this explanation?

  

In my opinion, कर्णाटक is the Sanskritized spelling (/n/ following /r/ becomes retroflexed --*nati s**ūtra*). Any explanation to do with ears is folk-etymology.

  

कर्नाटक is definitely the native spelling as evinced in the family names such as girīṣ karnāḍ (ಗಿರೀಶ್ ಕರ್ನಾಡ್/ಕಾರ್ನಾಡ್). There are several regions in South India named based on the regional features such as palanāḍu, velanāḍu,cēranāḍu (\<kēraḷaṁkēra - coconut?)(cōẓa nāṭu (சோழ நாடு)) etc.

  

Regards,

Suresh.
