नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

कर्णाटभाषा --

  

In 15th Century there was a great Telugu poet called श्रीनाथ - ’कविसार्वभौम’ -- who translated नैषधम् into

Telugu as शृङ्गारनैषधमु , and also authored works like काशीखण्डमु , हरविलासमु , भीमखण्डमु , क्रीडाभिराममु etc

(in भाषाप्रवीण ( Telugu ) my specialization was श्रीनाथयुगमु ) --

  

when people heckled at him , for having more Kannada words in his poetry, he retorted --

निजमु ना पलुकु कर्णाटभाष (really , my language is कर्णाट)

  

what he meant is -- it is people's language -- कर्णेषु अटतीति कर्णाटा - भाषा

  

By adding कप्रत्यय it will be कर्णाटक ।

  

Such mistakes are committed in Andhra also - the name of a new project is - Gnana (Jnana?) - they

meant ज्ञान ।

  

In all fields , including Language (Sanskrit is no exception) ,there has been serious deterioration of

standards and already the institutions are filled with such people - and it is a point of no return .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
