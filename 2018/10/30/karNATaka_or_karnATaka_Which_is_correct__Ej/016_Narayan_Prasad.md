Namaste,

  Please see the attached title page of the Kannada grammar called "ಕರ್ಣಾಟಕಶಬ್ದಾನುಶಾಸನಂ" (कर्णाटक शब्दानुशासनं)composed by Bhattakalankadeva in 1604 and published first in 1890 and then revised edition in 1923. Both the sUtras and the two auto-commentaries are written in Sanskrit. But the examples are, of course, in Kannada. The script used is also Kannada.

  Regards

  Narayan Prasad
