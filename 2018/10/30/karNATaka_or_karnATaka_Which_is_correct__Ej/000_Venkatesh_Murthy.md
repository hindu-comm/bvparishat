Namaste

  

I want to know which spelling in Sanskrit and Indian languages is correct?

कर्णाटक or कर्नाटक? I think the first spelling is correct according to Panini rules likeरषाभ्यां नो णः समानपदे

  

Karnataka Government has taken the second spelling. It may be incorrect.

Others also use the incorrectकर्नाटक. In 2 days Karnataka Rajyotsava is celebrated. Many people will be writing wrong spelling.
