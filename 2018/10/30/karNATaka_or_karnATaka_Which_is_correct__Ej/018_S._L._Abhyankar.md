May I venture different guesses

\(1\) Karnataka region got its name given to it by people of neighboring regions, speaking another tongue, say, Marathi. Some Marathi author chided "you need not know the Kannada language. Just put some pebbles in a tin and shake the tin. What sounds will emerge, will be Kannada." So the etymology can be कर्णे अटतीति कर्णाटकी भाषा"

\(2\) But name of the language has always been कन्नड. And name of people speaking कन्नड has always been कन्नडिग-s. There has been a newspaper, named संयुक्त कर्नाटकಸಂಯುಕ್ತ ಕರ್ನಾಟಕ not संयुक्त कर्णाटकfor more than 50-60 years.  

\(3\) I was born in an erstwhile princely state, which was the first one to be voluntarily merged into Indian Union. After linguistic reorganization in 1957, it is in Karnataka. Before that it was in Bombay State. The princely family's mother-tongue and of many of the capital city जमखंडी was Marathi. In the villages the most common language was Kannada. Rather, almost the whole populace spoke both the languages. In our high school there were four divisions for every standard, 2 for Marathi medium 2 for Kannada medium. After the princely state became a part of Karnataka state, there was a song sung during ನಾಡಹಬ್ಬ State Festival (ನಾಡ / ನಾಡು meaning state ಹಬ್ಬ meaning festival) ಉದಯ ವಾಗಿದೆ ನಮ್ಮ ಚಲುವ ಕನ್ನಡ ನಾಡು "Our nice Kannada-state is born."

Somehow it is difficult to connect etymology of Karnataka with Kannada. How does the "r" come in ?

\(4\) But Kannada connects up with the name of मुनि कणाद. Maybe मुनि कणाद had his ashram in the region and the language spoken by the natives got the name from his name. Etymology of कणाद itself is given as कणान् अत्तीति कणादः

In the field of atomic science कणाद is credited to be knowledgeable of atoms long before Dalton.

But sub-atomic particles are mentioned in अणोरणीयान् समनुस्मरेद्यः (गीता 8'9) itself (!) See अणोः अणीयान् (!)

Anyway maybe कणशः नादाः अस्यामिति कणादा (कण्-नदा => कन्नडा) भाषा

Maybe कणशः नादैः कर्णेषु अटतीति कर्णाटकी भाषा => एषा अत्र भाष्यते इति कर्णाटकः

\(5\) It must be granted that Kannada speech is very clear in pronunciation of every syllable, so much so that in Kannada script one can write "get" ಗೆಟand "gate" ಗೇಟ(so also नोट ನೊಟandनोऽट ನೋಟ)very distinctly.

देवनागरी does have दीर्घोच्चार letters for अ आ इ ई उ ऊ ऋ ॠ

In Kannada scriptदीर्घोच्चार has been extended to ए and ओ also.

Maybe, the दीर्घोच्चार-symbol in ಗೇಟ ನೋಟ is an adaptation of the देवनागरीअवग्रह ऽ as in तेऽपि सोऽपि.

In अष्टाध्यायी there is mention of दीर्घोच्चार, but not of अवग्रह as the symbol for it,

Though much later than अष्टाध्यायी, अवग्रह ऽ is a good दीर्घोच्चार-symbol to have been adopted in देवनागरी.

Kannada script very much digested it as an integral part of its script. यदि नादाः कणशः, तथैव लेखनीयापि (!)
