Yes. Even Brhatsamhita (6th Cent.) and the more ancient Parasharatantra refers to a southern region as कर्णाट. The -ka suffix is a later Sanskritic variation. Whether न or ण was used in the ancient period can not be decided by quoting Sanskrit texts. RaajatarangiNi refers to this country or region several times. I have not yet had chance to refer to the original. In some Sanskrit texts there is reference to नाटदेश . In music नाटराग is famous. My guess is the original kar-naaDu became kar-naaTa (कर्नाट ) . Some people retained this with na->Na and others omitted kar- and made 'naaDu' into 'naaTa'. Either way it is a type of Sanskritization.
