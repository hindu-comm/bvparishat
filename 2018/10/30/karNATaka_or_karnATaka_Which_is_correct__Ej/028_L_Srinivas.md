Dear Madhav,

  

Thanks for your comment. There's a general tendency one notices nowadays - if one's old enough, that is - to be hypercorrect in matters of language. The net effect of it is that one language has to defer to the rules of grammar of another, deemed more classical or more authoritative. This was the case until 100 years or so back.

  

Kannada is used by tens of millions of speakers - 34.8 million in 2001 or 66% of the state population in 2001, by one reckoning. That's a huge number by any reckoning. That's why it's surprising.

  

Regards,

  

Srini
