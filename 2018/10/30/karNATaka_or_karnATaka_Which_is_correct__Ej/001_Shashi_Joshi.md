I think there is a reference of कर्णाटक in Hitopadesh and in that it mentions the reason for the name - that the people of the region pull ears when fighting, I am not sure if that was a satire by the author of the time !  
  
Unable to find it off hand, am travelling right now.  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
