Once while searching for Dravid word meaning/etymology, I found on net a shloka which says which places are drAvida Deshas.  
  
So, this shkoka is probably from Skanda Purana. आन्ध्राः कर्णाटकाश्चैव गुर्जरा द्रविडास् तथा महाराष्ट्रा इति ख्याता पञ्चैते द्रविडाः स्मृताः।।  
  
So I think many words are Avyutpanna Pratipadikas in Sanskrit, still because of the language's flexibility, we can use Dhatus and Pratipadikas and Vakpatu people can derive it perfectly. Vakpatu people can derive many more meanings giving language's flexibility. Because, in Kaumudi also, in probably some Sutra relating to Janapada names, it was written in Balamanorama that that desha is Avyutpanna.  
  
I think it won't be incorrect to write कर्नाटक in the original script Kannada script but I don't know if original Kannada language uses it with or without retroflex. And to us, probably because we're used to seeing ण everytime after रषाभ्याम्, it becomes little awkward and itchy to look at it. Not being Kannadiga, I'm not aware of the correct pronounciation/spelling in Kannada language. It may be ण or न also. On Sanskritization, it does become retroflex but what is the Kannnada form?  
  
  
Even in northern languages, Krishna became Kaanha, Kanhaiya, Baladeva's Deva probably became Daau in short. Anantashayan name is very interesting, Podhanath- podh is a root in Vrajbhasha for sleep, and the lord who sleeps literally-Podhanath.  
  
Sorry for diveting, anyways, it's Sanskrit word, it may/may not have become slang and if it is Kannda word, it may have Sanskritized due to Rashabhyam Rule.  
  
But question is what is word in Kannada (irrespective of it's variant in Sanskrit).  
  
I'm sorry if I student am interefering in scholars discussion.  
  
Regards  
Rishi.
