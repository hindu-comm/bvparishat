Narayana Prasad Ji

  

In this limited context of "Karnataka" being referred to in older texts, one could include bhagavata purana 5th skanda's RShabhadEva's vRttAnta also:

  

tasya ha vā evaṁ mukta-liṅgasya bhagavata ṛṣabhasya yoga-māyā-vāsanayā deha imāṁ jagatīm abhimānābhāsena saṅkramamāṇaḥ koṅka-veṅka-kuṭakān dakṣiṇa-**karṇāṭakān deśān** yadṛcchayopagataḥ **kuṭakācalo**pavana āsya kṛtāśma-kavala unmāda iva mukta-mūrdhajo’saṁvīta eva vicacāra.

  

BTW I haveheardthat **kuṭakācala** referred to above is the Kodachadri hills in the present day dakShiNa kannaDa district.
