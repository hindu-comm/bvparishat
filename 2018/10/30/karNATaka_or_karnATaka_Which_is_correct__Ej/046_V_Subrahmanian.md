One Guru of Vidyaranya is Sri Shankarananda as Vidyaranya himself says at the beginning of his Panchadashi:

  

नमःश्रीशंकरानन्दगुरुपादाम्बुजन्मने  
सविलासमहमोहग्राहग्रासैककर्मणे\|१\|

namaH shrIsha.nkarAnandagurupAdAmbujanmane  
savilAsamahamohagrAhagrAsaikakarmaNe \|1\|

The next shloka is to emphasize the need for attaining purification by serving the Guru:

तत्पादाम्बुरुहद्वन्द्वसेवानिर्मलचेतसाम्  
सुखबोधायतत्वस्यविवेकोऽयंविधीयते\|२\|

tatpAdAmburuhadvandvasevAnirmalachetasAm  
sukhabodhAya tatvasya viveko\~yaM vidhIyate \|2\|

*  
This analysis of the truth is done for the easy and effortless comprehension of those whose minds have been rendered pure by service to His two lotus feet \|*2*\|*

*  
I offer my prostrations to my Guru shrI sha.nkarAnandaH, whose only work is to destroy the crocodile-like ignorance with all its consequences and effects.*\|1\|

In the 'Birudavali' of Sringeri occurs the name 'Vidyanagara' and 'KarNataka':
