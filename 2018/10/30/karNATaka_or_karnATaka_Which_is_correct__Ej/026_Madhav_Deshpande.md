Dear Srini,

  

  You have raised an appropriate question. I know nothing about Kannada, but this same question keeps on being raised in relation to Marathi usage. Should the Marathi usage follow the intuitions of its users, or be constrained by rules of Sanskrit grammar. From what I understand about this debate, the general opinion these days is that Marathi should follow its own usage, rather than being defined in terms of Sanskrit.
