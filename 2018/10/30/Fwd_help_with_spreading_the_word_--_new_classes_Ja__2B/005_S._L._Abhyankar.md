नमस्ते श्रीमन् विश्वास-महोदय !

It seems you are not happy even when I have already said "I am sorry ...."

Anyway, having said that, the fact remains that there certainly are issues with the scope/contents and duration, which I have detailed separately in my interaction with Mr. Swarup, also with yourself and Mr. Naresh Cuntoor,

I have proposed that those issues be sorted out among us.

Shall we do that, before posting any more messages to the group about who said what and how ?

Shall we focus on the core point - issues about scope/contents and duration ?

Any suggestions from any member about "scope/contents and duration" should of course be welcome.  

Cordially, S. L. Abhyankar
