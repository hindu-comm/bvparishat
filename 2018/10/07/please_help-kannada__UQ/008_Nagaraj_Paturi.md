Sri Ramana Murthy-ji shared a snapshot from a Kannada dictionary in which the meaning the young of the animal is given.

  

"current Kannada" is a vague concept.

  

The snapshot has a meaning 'dwarf ' also.

  

In Telugu, there is gūni in the sense of humped back.

  

kunni used in the sense of calf is in all probability must be connected to gunna/gunne in that sense to whichever period the usage in that sense belongs.
