Dear Sir,

  

I have complicated the second question. I put in a simple way.

What is the Kannada word for young? Is this ಗುಂನೆ /ಗುನ್ನೆ *gunne* (ending in ಎ *e*) or ಗುಂನ/ಗುನ್ನ *gunna* (ending in ಅ a)?

ಗುಂನೆ /ಗುನ್ನೆ *gunne* (ending in ಎ*e*)): This is the word used in the grammar book. But this word is not found in dictionaries. I referred three dictionaries.

  

ಗುಂನ/ಗುನ್ನ *gunna*(ending in ಅ *a*): This is the word found in the dictionaries.

  

Regards

Ramana murthy
