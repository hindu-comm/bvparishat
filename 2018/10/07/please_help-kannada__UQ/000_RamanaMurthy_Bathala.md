Dear Schloars,

  

The following is from : AN ELEMENTARY GRAMMAR OF THE KANNADA OR CANARESE LANGUAGE-1864-Ed.II-THOMAS HODSON

  

![1.jpg](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/1cad9045ce722/1.jpg?part=0.1&view=1)

  

  

In the screenshot above, the kannada word ಗುಂನೆ is transliterated as gunne (ಗುನ್ನೆ).

  

I have two doubts here.

  

1\) After ಗು (gu) the sound is m(ಮ್), but in the transliteration, it is given as n(ನ್). The expected transliterationis gumne, but it is given as gunne. The same kind of transliteration is given in the dictinary. Please see the screen shot.

2\) In the dictionaryI can find only ಗುಂನ (gumna) but not ಗುಂನೆ (gumne). But in this grammar book it is given as ಗುಂನೆ (gumne).

  

  

  

I request scholars to help me out.

  

Regards

Ramana murthy
