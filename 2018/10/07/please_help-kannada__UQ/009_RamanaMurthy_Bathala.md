Dear Sir,

  

It seems both the words ಗುಂನ/ಗುನ್ನ *gunna* (ending in ಅ *a*) and ಗುಂನೆ /ಗುನ್ನೆ *gunne* (ending in ಎ *e*), exist in Kannada.

  

ಗುಂನ/ಗುನ್ನ *gunna* (ending in ಅ *a*): This is the mainstream word found in the dictionaries.

ಗುಂನೆ /ಗುನ್ನೆ *gunne* (ending in ಎ *e*)): This is the dialectal variation of mainstream word ಗುಂನ/ಗುನ್ನ *gunna*, used in Mysore region.

  

This is found in "A KANNADA-ENGLISH DICTIONARY BY REV. F. KITTEL". See screen shot. Please see the markings.
