The word "gunna" or "gunnu" is not in usage to mean a "calf of an animal" in current Kannada. I have checked in "sankShipta kannaDanighanTu" published by Kannada SaahityaParishad. Word, "kunni" exists and it means "a calf". "gunna" on the other hand means,a scratch or a mark, especially a mark made by the nail of a top(buguri) on the body of another buguri.

  

Regards,

Murthy
