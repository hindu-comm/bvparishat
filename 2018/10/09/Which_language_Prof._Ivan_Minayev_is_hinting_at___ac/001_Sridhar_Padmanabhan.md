Namaste. I have gone through this. While going through the Wikipedia, I found that Persian and Arabic was quite common and even official language till late 19th century. Hint of the language what Prof. Ivan Minayev might be Persian and Arabic. These languages also have a good literature works from India.

  

Thanking you
