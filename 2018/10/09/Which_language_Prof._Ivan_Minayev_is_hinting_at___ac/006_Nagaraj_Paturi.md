The sentence as translated by Sri Narayan Prasad-ji in the initiating post itself is not well formed:

  

they speak a peculiar language, different from both Urdu and***Bengali***Hindus and have original literature in this language."

  

both Urdu and***Bengali***Hindus?

  

Urdu is a language and "Bengali Hindus" is not.

  

Is it Bengali of the Hindus?

\>As far dialects areconcerned they may not have the literature.

  

                                --Sri Sridhar-ji  

  

The word 'literature' is sometimes used in the sense of oral literature like folk or tribal literature also.
