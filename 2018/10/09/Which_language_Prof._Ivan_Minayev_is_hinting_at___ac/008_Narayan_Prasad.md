Thank you Dr Sridhar for your reply.

  

Prof. Ivan Minayev was a great scholar. He knew also English, French, German, Sanskrit, Pali (he conversed in Pali with the Buddhist monks) and also Hindi including a few dialects. Moreover, he has mentioned the Persian language later in the same chapter "Muslims in India":

  

"The law of 1793 ignored the position of the highest Muslim officials, intermediaries between the government and the secondary tax collector, or zemindar; in place of these intermediaries with their troops, the company appointed its collectors with a small and unarmed police staff. ....

The prisons were managed by Muslims. Cadi sat in civil courts, and even when judges from among the English began to appear occasionally. The country was governed by Muslim laws; the proceedings were conducted in the Persian language, known mainly only to Muslims."

  

It is clear from the context that instead of expressing his view in a roundabout way without mentioning the language name itself, he would have mentioned the name of the language, had it been either Persian or Arabic.

  

Warm regards

Narayan Prasad
