Thank you very much Sir for pointing out the mistake.

  

\<\<Is it Bengali of the Hindus? \>\>

  

Yes sir.

  

The original Russian "отличным и от Урду и от ***Бенгали*** нндусов" means "different from both Urdu and Bengali of the Hindus.

  

The Russian word "нндусов" is the genitive plural of "нндус" which means Hindu.

  

Warm regards

Narayan Prasad
