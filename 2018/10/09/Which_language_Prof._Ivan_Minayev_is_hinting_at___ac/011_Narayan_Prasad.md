Sir,

 Thank you for your reply and suggestion.

 It is clear from Prof Minayev's statement that he is hinting at a language that not only has literature, but that is also spoken by the Muslims, most probably in Bengal, because he gives its contrast with Benagali (and Urdu). Garo and Khasi are languages spoken by the tribal people in Assam and Meghalaya. So it is doubtful whether Prof Minayev means these two languages.

 Warm regards

 Narayan Prasad
