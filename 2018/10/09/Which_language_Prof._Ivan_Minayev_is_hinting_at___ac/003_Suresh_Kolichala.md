There are several non-Indo-Aryan languages spoken among the tribes of eastern Bangladesh and parts of Meghalaya, viz., Garo, Khasi, Bodo, Mihir, Kachari, Dimasa etc. While most of the these languages are Tibeto-Burman languages, Khasi is an Austro-Asiatic language (different from the Munda languages of eastern India). Please take a look at the maps I drew for the book "Languages and Linguistics of South Asia" (2016) published by Walter de Gruyter.
