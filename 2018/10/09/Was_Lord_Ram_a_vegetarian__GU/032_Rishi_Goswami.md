Dear schollars,  
  
It is my bAlabuddhi and I shouldn't interfere in conversation, but according to me it's important to have all types of Vargas in society to maintain Vyavastha and Santulana.  
  
Skiled and Unskilled both sectors are equally important similarly veg and non veg also.  
  
We have all types of eating habits in the jungle which might have been anukrita by Rishis.  
Herbivores  
Carnivores  
Omnivores and  
Scavengers.  
  
If we don't have any of the one, we will have issues in the food chain. Since Humans are Omnivores, we needed to make some rules to balance the food system.  
  
If we only had vegetarian food, we would cut jungles to plough fields. Result would be disastrous for animals as well for their homes would get destroyed.and we know the disasters of deforestation.  
If we only had non veg like in stone age, we would be killing entire biodiversity for hunger.  
  
Now the circumstances are such that each person should become veg as global warming issues and many other issues. If we're consuming animals today, we're doing so much injustice towards them, as for having good meat, we need food and grains to keep animals healthy and that meat is given to us, so we're actually wasting grains as well as meat. Dharma changes according circumstances as Yudhishthir says in Mahabharata.  
  
य एव धर्मः सोSधर्मोSदेशकाले प्रतिष्ठितः।।  
  
According Desha and Kaala Paristhiti today, going completely vegetarian is the perfect solution but in days when population was in control, there was a requirement to have both types of people to deal with ecological stability.  
  
Basically, eating Plants also is a kind of Himsa in Hinduism, because they're also Jeevas.  
  
जीवो जीवस्य जीवनम् Is basically the eternal law of nature which can't be changed.  
  
There are 5 inevitable Paaps that all humans commit and hence Hinduism prescribes Vishvedeva Puja to be free of those 5 Paaps. It should be performed by All, irrespective of caste. It is one of the compulsory rituals, like Antim Samskara and Shraddha of Pitridevas.  
  
The 5 Rinas also inckude Bhootarina where Humans nees to revere and respect Nature, 5 elements which is the most basic key point of Hinduism and is the least focused part unfortunately. Mukti from5 Rinas and not commiting 5 Mahapatakas, doing the 5 Mahayajnas and Vishvedeva Puja for the 5 inevitable Paapas, Ahimsa, Satya, Daana and Yajnas are some of the basic key elements of Hinduism, each Manushyamatra is accustomed to follow irrespective of caste.  
  
Hence, I think even eating plants = eating animals. There's no difference. But the rules are laid down for ecological balance and sustainance of Vyavastha. Hence Varna system was called Vyavastha by Rishis.  
  
Hinduism is therefore the most logical and scientific religion ever, the rules laid down seem to be in the benefit of everyone. The key element or Hetu for DharmaShastras was only Bhadra, Kalyana. Hence Dharma is defined yato'bhyudaya-nihshreyasa-siddhih sa dharmah ajd Sukhasya mulam dharmah.  
  
It is just my speculation according to what I've been thinking. If at all I'm wrong due to bAlabuddhi, please do correct me.  
  
Regards.  
Rishi.
