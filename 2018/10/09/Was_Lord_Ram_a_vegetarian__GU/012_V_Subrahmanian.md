Someone sent me a small collection:

  

Manusmriti

chapter 5 verse30:

  

"It is not sinful to eat meat of eatable animals,for God has created both the eaters and the eatables".

  

Aapastanba Grishsutram(1/3/10):

  

says, "The cow should be slaughtered on the arrival of a guest, on the occasion of 'Shraaddha of ancestors and on the occasion of a marriage".

  

Rigveda (10/85/13): declares, "On the occasion of a girls marriage oxen and cows are slaughtered".

  

Rigveda (6/17/1) : states that, "Indra used to eat the meat of cow, calf, horse and buffalo".

  

Vashishta Dharmasutra (11/34): says, "If a Brahmin refuses to eat the meat offered to him on the occasion of ,'Shraaddha' he goes to hell".

  

Hinduisms great propagator Swami Vivekaanand said thus: "You will be surprised to know that according to ancient Hindu rite and rituals, a man cannot be a good Hindu who does not eat beef ".

(The complete works of Swami Vivekanand vol :3/5/36)

  

"The book The history and culture of the indian people" – published by Bharatiya vidya bhawan, Mumbai and edited by renowned historian R C Majumdar (vol 2, page 18 says): This is said in the mahabharata that "king Ratindra used to kill 2000 other animals in addition to 2000 cows daily in order to give their meat in charity"

  

There is also a reference inBrahadaranyako panishad for consumption of particular meat preparation for obtaining particular type of offspring.
