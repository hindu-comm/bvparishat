The story of Agastya accepting Ilvala's brother vatapi cooked as a goat when he accepted the hospitality of the Asura shows that the consumption of meat went beyond the controlled conditions of a Yajna etc even with Brahmins. I have read in certain versions that Agastya cursed meat eating and since the south follows Agastya they adopted those practices.

  

Having said that, the meat was also sanctified by first offering to the deities and Lord of Sacrifice. Indiscriminate slaughter was not followed and only animals with certain markings were selected. It was ensured that the animal received a higher yoni and obtained mukti from the yoni it was being sacrificed in. This is very different from modern factory farming
