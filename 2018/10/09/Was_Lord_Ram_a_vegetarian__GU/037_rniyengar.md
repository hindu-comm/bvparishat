I agree with you Srinivas. It would be wrong to conclude that Ahimsa and Vegetarianism is soley due to Jain influence.In ancient times and even in historical times were Jains 100% vegetarians?

  

On the other hand JC Jain in his authoritativebook (*Life in Ancient India as per Jain canons, 1947* *available at Archives*) describing the food habits of Jains in ancient times has the following to say.(Extracts without violence to the original text, since it is too long)

"Ordinarily a Jain layman or monk..was prohibited from..NV food.. Among the articles..wine, meat are mentioned along with rice, curds, milk etc as food received by monks while begging..., question arose what a monk should do if bony flesh or bony fish was offered in his bowl. It is stated that he should avoid bones and ask for flesh....Here the commentator mentions that majja (wine) and maamsa may be accepted as a cure for \`luuta' a kind of disease ...from a spider, at the instance of a physician. Besides,...in the country SINDHU people lived on meat.... Under such circumstances a saadhu was allowed..NV food. (Brihatkalpa Bhaashya 1.1239). Lastly it has been stated in the Viyaaha....,Revati a follower of Mahavira sent him maarjaara-krita-kukkuTa-maamsa for the cure of the disease. The commentator Abhayadeva provides two meanings for this (a)Flesh of a cock killed by a cat. (b)A plant of species Virala mixed with citron.."

He (the author JC Jain) concludes "..when no other food was available except meat...Jain monks....were obliged to take it rather than starve them to death.."

Discussions about Hinduism & Culture can be confusing (often self contradictory) in the absence of proper historical perspective.
