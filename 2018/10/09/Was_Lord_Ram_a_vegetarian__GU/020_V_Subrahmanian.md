Dear Sriram ji,

  

I am not sure if the above is exactly the case. Take for instance:

  

Swami Vidyaranya has, in his Jivanmukti viveka, in the Vasanakshaya prakaranam, mentioned that the South Indians fault theNortherners(brahmins) for their meat-eating habits and the latter taunt the former for their practice of girls marrying their maternal uncles and so on. So there is this 'vasana' to hold one's own practices as high and fault those of others as censurable. Such vasana according to the author is not conducive to spirituality. 

  

This was in the 14th Century CE. Surely, I think he was not unaware of the 'controlled' conditions aspect. It also shows that during those times, the Southerners (brahmins) were not in the habit of eating meat. Even today in parts of India there is animal sacrifice:

\[Inside Kamakhya Temple, Guwahati, Assam - Pasubali Area inside Maa Kamakhya Temple of Guwahati (Assam).\]

  

Another video with the caption: 

# \[Brahmin Hindu pandit slaughters goat : Durga Puja Bali or sacrificial offering in Bihar\]

  

I don't think these are really 'controlled' conditions.

  

I think, in the South, Brahmins gave up (a supposed practice of meat eating) perhaps because of the influence of the Three Acharyas. This is my guess, though.

  

The ancient smrits, books, are available in translation too, these days. Anyone can access them and see, read, interpret the passages and use them for their agenda.

  

warm regards
