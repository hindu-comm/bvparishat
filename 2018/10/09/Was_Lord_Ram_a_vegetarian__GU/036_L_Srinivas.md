This is a very good point.

  

It's ignorance to attribute every ancient custom to the influence of Jainism just because today it's seen much more among the Jainas. One example comes to my mind. School and university Tamil text books consistently teach that the practice of sitting in one place and ritually starving oneself to death, encountered frequently in the ancient Tamil texts, is a Jaina practice. It's rarely ever mentioned that the same practice is encountered under the name of 'prāyopaveśa' in Ramayana and other 'Hindu' texts.
