We discuss about a Kshatriya king, who was permitted to consume non vegetarian food. If he's not allowed to do so, it is the violation of Rajadharma. As a prince in exile, he had killed many demons and punished appropriately the evil doers. What was his authority? In spite of he being in exile, he was still the prince under whose jurisdiction, subjects should act and behave. This is the answer to episodes like Vali-vadha.

  

Next, who made him god? Is not we?? He says humbly - आत्मानं मानुषं मन्ये (I consider myself as a mere human). He is said to be the embodiment of Dharma as reiterated by Marica. how a human being should endure the difficulties and hardships in life was the clear message of Rama's character. In stead of copying it we are misled by statements like Rama is your god, and your god eats meat.. and so on and so forth.

  

Otherwise, it is something like we try to make a distinction between veg and non-veg gods. Let us only talk about a strong, valiant, dharmic human being who surpassed all unprecedented problems, created by Vidhi.

  

Just now I saw a reply by Prof. Wakankar ji, with regard to hunting. *Mrigayaa* is allowed for kings in ancient India.
