Dear inquisitive friend,

  

Formerly,in the period of the Brahmana.texts,an Atithi was known as a Go.ghna,meaning,for whose meal, a cow was killed.

  

In the Uttararamacharita of Bhavabhuti also,you find such a reference.

  

Moreover,hunting was one of the pastimes of the Kings,enjoined by Smrutis.

  

Why should we feel ashamed if our Gods etc. eat meat.It was their aahaara.thats all.The matter ends there.

  

Sorry for this frank opinion which could be difficult to digest.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
