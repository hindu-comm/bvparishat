Sri Niranjan Ni-ji,

  

My intention was to say that the food habits found in puraaNa texts can not be quoted for "Brahmins once ate this" kind of conclusions.

  

Interestingly individuals (not you or those like you) who claim to be historically critical and as such would maintain a clear distinction between mythology and history freely quote from mythology as if it is history when they find that such quoting helps them in manipulating the present generation's attitude towards " Hinduism", " Hindu food habits" etc. Some Hindu youngsters like such manipulations as they are useful to justify their newly acquired food habits against their family traditions. Some other Hindu youngsters get annoyed at such interpretations and express disbelief at puraaNas having such descriptions, getting trapped into the self-contradicting -mythology as history- trick played by the historical critical writers. The present thread began with the expression of such a disbelief only. Hence my response.

  

I wish I could help these youngsters understand all these complex nuances; but I know that it is not easy.
