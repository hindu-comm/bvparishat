It is yes, in case of emergencies, wherein you are left with no option but to eat meat/non vegetarian only to save your precious life.

On what authority we rewrite smrtis? That is not the purport discussed here. We suppose to follow Parashara in Kaliyuga, कलौ पाराशरस्मृतिः. but we are following Manu based on its relevance. Once Sringeri Mahaswamiji were asked, can you suggest to re-write Dharmashastra suitable to current times? 'We are not sitting in this Peetha to encourage such endeavours' was His answer.

Obviously this could be done, as tons of literature is available in this direction.
