May I please add to this thread?

  

In our traditional knowledge systems, we had knowledge of herbs, roots and plants that were several fold more potent than the nutrition that is provided by controlled agricultural practices of today. Additionally, the soil of jungles is extremely rich in nutrients, and resultantly, what grows there, way more powerful, provided someone has the knowledge. To add to this, most Gurukuls headed by Rshis were located in Jungles (another meaning of the word 'Gotra' - means 'Forest' (<http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?mode=3&script=hk&tran_input=gotra&direct=au>)

  

Codices on Ayurveda, I am certain, still contain such knowledge, and several scholars on this group will shed light on that..

  

Therefore, it is highly likely that one could practice being "vegetarian" but not in today's interpretation of the term.

  

Also, I think the topic of Shaak versus Paak has been discussed before on another thread. And from my recollection, shakaahaari simply means when one eats raw / uncooked vegetables. Does my memory serve this groups requirements? Please correct me if I am wrong.

  

So, in one opinion that I present here, one can practice vegetarianism with the right knowledge of plants, and herbs.

  

I may be entirely incorrect though.
