Most probably not.

  

In the Aranya khanda we find:

मांस हेतोः अपि मृगान् विहारार्थम् च धन्विनः \|  
घ्नन्ति लक्ष्मण राजानो मृगयायाम् महावने \|\| ३-४३-३१

He clearly says Kings hunt deer for flesh and being from a family of Kings he is no different. I am do not think they ate meat during vanavas since the period of tapasya has its own rules.  

  

Since Rama clearly says to Guha during Ayodya khanda:

कुश चीर अजिन धरम् फल मूल अशनम् च माम् \|  
विद्धि प्रणिहितम् धर्मे तापसम् वन गोचरम् \|\| २-५०-४४  

  

"Know me as under a vow to be an ascetic, wearing the robes of kusha and deerskin and by piety, I am determined to live in the forest by eating roots and fruits only."  

  

They were vegetarian during vanavasa.

  

I seriously doubt they were vegetarian in the palace since there would be no need to stress kanda mula when that is their normal state.
