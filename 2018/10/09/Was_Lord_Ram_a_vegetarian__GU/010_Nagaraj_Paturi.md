'Hinduism' has never been a completely vegetarian culture. Non-vegetarian food habits were and are part of the traditional food habits of certain caste groups and almost all tribal groups. That was never viewed as violation of norms of 'Hinduism'.

  

Diversity of food culture was part of diversity that is the hallmark of 'Hinduism'.
