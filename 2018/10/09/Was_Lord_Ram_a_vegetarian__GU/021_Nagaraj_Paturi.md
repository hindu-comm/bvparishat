Vandana-ji,

  

First of all, please come out of this mode : " If meat eating is bad, it is bad for all. All must stop eating meat. Or if meat eating is OK, it should be OK for all. All should be allowed to eat meat. "

  

This mode of thinking comes from the uniformity oriented worldview. 'Hinduism' is a diversity-oriented and diversity-centric pluralist worldview/culture.

  

If you keep worrying about what others say, you can not understand Yama, the 'god' of death taking 'life' of every creature away. If they ask you, "Your god yama takes away life", then? you can not understand Shiva being layakaari. If they say, your god Shiva destroys (in fact what Shiva does is not destruction, it is devolution. but ifthey say), then?

  

-----------------

  

If you want Rama to do what you do or you want to do what Rama did, it is not possible. Rama wore a crown, do you want to wear? Rama did not use a fossil fuel driven vehicle. Do you want to stop using? Rama faced difficulties in life to make his father's promise to one of his wives true. Can you do such things in your own life?
