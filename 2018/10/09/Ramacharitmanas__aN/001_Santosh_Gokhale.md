Dear Shri RadhaKrishnan ji,

  

Pl. check the lectures by Swami Akhandananda Sarasvati on Youtube, 83 audio episodes in all.

They are serial in nature (i.e. follow the Ramcharitmanas text line for line), not topical (Like those of Pt. Ramkinkar Upadhyaya)

  

The lectures are without unnecessary embellishments, and are true to the text (Gitapress edition).

Kind regards

Santosh Gokhale
