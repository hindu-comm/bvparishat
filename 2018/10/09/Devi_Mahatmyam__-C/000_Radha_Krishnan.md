Dear All Scholars,

Namamsi.

  

I want to know if there is any bhasya for Sri Devi Mahatmyam (of Markandeya puranam) based on Tantras?

  

There are some Bhasyas example, shantanavi, etc. But they are not based on Tantras.

  

Also is there any comparison between Lalitha Sahasranama and Devi Mahatmyam?

  

Thank you in advance.
