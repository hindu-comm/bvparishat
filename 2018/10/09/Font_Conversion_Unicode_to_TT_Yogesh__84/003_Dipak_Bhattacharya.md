Dear Colleague.

If your default font is MSW you have to save a file with DVTT Yogesh and see the result. I pasted a paper with DVTT- Yogesh and its font is now available in my computer! So, you have to paste a paper with DVTT YOGESH or ASTT Durga in Windows MSW. When I did that Windows generated the font in my computer. If your computer allows you may download such a file from the Internet. I got help from my vendor so that the operation was smooth
