What is this source for traditional śloka?

In the popular culture, this ga*ṇesa stuti*śloka isgenerally recited after *śuklāmbaradharaṃ*, but in one of the versions of*Skānda purāṇa*text, what follows after *śuklāmbaradharaṃ* is a janārdhana stuti. Furthermore, there are differentślokas that follow*śuklāmbaradharaṃ***in*Śivapupurāṇa* and *Viṣ**ṇusahasran**āma* as well. So, where is theśloka of*agajānana padmārkaṁ* is from? Is there any traditional literature where these twoślokas are juxtaposed next to each other?

  

The question of whether theśloka of*śuklāmbaradharaṃ was*originally meant for ga*ṇesa* is another topic that may have been discussed on this forum earlier, although, I could not locate any such discussion with my limited search.

  
Regards,

Suresh.
