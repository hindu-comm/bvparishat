Dear Sri Damodara Das

Sthapatis can give opinion on site selection, construction and artistic features. But the type of temple, and its direction would be dependent on the Yajamaana, the owner or the promoter. This is what I could gather from the classical Agama texts. Since you are mentioning about Pancharatra tradition, I am quoting here from the Naradiya Samhita also called Narada Pancharatra (Publn. KSV, Tirupati)

All the four cardinal directions are acceptable but the choice depends on what the donor desires. The four corner directions are of course prohibited for main entry and facing of the deity. Agama texts (Shaiva, Vaishnava, Shaakta) are not just about temple worship rituals. Many of these texts are compendiums of village planning including temple layout and design. Surely you are aware that there are specific canonical or doctrinal characters for Pancharatra (Agama) temples and worship.

best regards

  

RN Iyengar
