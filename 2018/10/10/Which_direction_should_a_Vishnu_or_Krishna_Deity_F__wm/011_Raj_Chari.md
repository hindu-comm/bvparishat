It is common knowledge that Vishnu/Krishna shrines in general face east.

First please work with a stapathi for further clarifications and installation procedures.

Pratishta must be done according to paancharaathra or vaikaanasa agama saastras.

North and West facing shrines are also possible. But they are rare.
