\|\|Hare Krishna\|\|  
  
Respected Vidvaj-janas,  
Pranams.  
  
We are constructing a small Krishna temple (capacity 300 devotees) for  
our vedic village. Our design is almost complete but we are not sure  
in which direction should:  
1. Deity of Lord Krishna should face (N, E, W, S)  
2. The temple main gate face  
  
I am looking in to pancaratras and it is taking much time. If someone  
in this group has some references or information about it, it will be  
very helpful for us.  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das  
  
ps. I have seen that in many traditional temples the deities face East.
