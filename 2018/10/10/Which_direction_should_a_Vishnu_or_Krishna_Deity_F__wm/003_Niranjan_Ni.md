It is better that you take the advice of people who have actually built temples.

Talk to a professional sthapathi. By so doing you will also be supporting a worthy traditional professional.

  

There is much involved in terms of shilpashastra and vastu that needs to be considered.

The Pancharatras may give certain opinions on worship depending on desha/kala, but the rules for temple construction are as old as they come.

  

It is better that you keep a consultant to visit and draw you proper plans. Temples are best not constructed as a DIY project by amateurs
who would not know where to start.
