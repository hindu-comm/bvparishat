Thank you Shankara Ji.

It indeed is the same work. I confirmed with the manuscript.

The published book title has 'Nilakantha Dikshita', but the inside text has 'Shrikantha Dikshita'. <https://archive.org/details/NyayaSiddhantaManjariJanakiNathBruhatTarkaPrakasaAbidhaNilakantha/page/n181>. So this is the same work as in Manuscript.
