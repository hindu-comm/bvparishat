Hari Om,

  

Dear group members,

  

I'd like to chant the Hanuman Chalisa properly. I'm fine chanting in Sanskrit but since it's in old Hindi there are a lot of differences.

  

So far I haven't been able to find a proper recording to follow along or a place that explains how to pronounce it properly. I'd really like to do it perfectly.

  

I know this isn't a pure Sanskrit question so please forgive me for that.

  

Looking forward to the replies,
