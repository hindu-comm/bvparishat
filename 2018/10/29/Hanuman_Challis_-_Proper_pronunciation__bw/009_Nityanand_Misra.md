Dear Sh. Vivek

  

Sorry for the late response, I was busy with finishing my book on the Kumbha Mela last week.

  

I would recommend listening to any of the below to learn how to sing the Hanuman-Chalisa

  

1\) Rendition by Hari Om Sharan

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hL0PAYoPDJk>

  

I believe this is the 1995 rendition by Hari Om Sharan which was released by Super Cassettes Industries Limited. The music composer was credited as Hari Om Sharan. There is an older popular rendition by Hari Om Sharan from 1974, which was an LP (S/7LPE 4010) released by The Gramophone Company of India Limited. In my expanded and annotated translation of the Mahaviri commentary, which is available [here](https://www.amazon.in/dp/9387471594/), I have given the musical notation of the Chalisa mostly following the 1974 rendition by Hari Om Sharan. The notation pages are attached in this email as a PDF (in case you can read notation).

  

2\) Rendition by Jagadguru Swami Ramabhadracharya and devotees at the Salasar Balaji temple in Rajasthan

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWVBSXtnG80>

  

This is the rendition with the reading which is commented upon in the Mahaviri commentary by Swami Ramabhadracharya

  

3\) Rendition by Pandit Channulal Mishra

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl0PtcPlnBc>

  

This is from the new album called Chalisa by Pandit Ji and is highly recommended for music-lovers.

  

PS: There are many other recordings available on YouTube, including by including those by Lata Mangeshkar, M S Subbulakshmi, Pandit Jasraj, Rajan Sajan Mishra, S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, Anup Jalota, Shankar Mahadevan, Anuradha Paudwal, Bombay Sisters, Mahendra Kapoor, Hariharan, Kavita Krishnamurthy, P Unnikrishnan, Pandit Sanjeev Abhayankar, P B Srinivas, Pandit Rattan Mohan Sharma, Swami Ganapathi Sachchidananda (mass parayana), etc.
