Dear Nityanand Misra,

  

Thank you so much for compiling that. The recordings sound wonderful. I had a look at your book and just ordered a copy. Very excited to read it.

  

I can chant Sanskrit perfectly but I'm not at all familiar with Hindi. I know that often the last "a" is dropped and other things. So I figured learning from a proper recording is the way to go.

  

I also looked for online material in pronunciation differences between Sanskrit and Hindi but so far haven't found any good sources on that.

  

Thanks again for all your input. I will pass on the things I've learned to others who are interested.

  

Much appriciated,

  

Vivek
