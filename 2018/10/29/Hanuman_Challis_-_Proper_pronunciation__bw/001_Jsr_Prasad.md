Dear Sri Viveka,

  

Our member, Sri Nityananda Mishra ji has contributed in this direction. He's translated beloved Jagadguru Maharaj's Mahaaveerii on Hanuman Chalisa into English.

  

If I recall correctly, Nithyananda ji compiled a Hanuman Chalisa video sung by various vocalists/artistes. Hope, he or any other scholar would clarify soon.
