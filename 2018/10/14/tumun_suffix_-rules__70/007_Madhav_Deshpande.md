For what it's worth, in 1980 I published a book "Deshpande-Evolution of Syntactic Theory in Sanskrit Grammar (KAROMA 1980)" that is entirely dealing with the syntactic issues related to -tum, and attempting to sort out the differences of views between Pāṇini, Kātyāyana, Patañjali and Bhartr̥hari. The pdf of the book is too large to be attached to this message, but I will be happy to share it with anyone who may be interested. Please send me a personal message.
