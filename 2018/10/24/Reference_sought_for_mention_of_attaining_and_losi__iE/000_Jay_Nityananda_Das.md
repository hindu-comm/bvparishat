Dear friends and respected Scholars,

  

Sadaram vande. Hare Krishna!

  

\- I was asked by one of my Muslim friends to provide Pramanas regarding attaining svarga by pious credits and losing the same due to exhaustion of pious credits in Vedas, Shrutis.

  

\- Though I gave him the below references from Srimad Bhagavad- Gita, he was not satisfied.



9.20 te punyam asadya surendra-lokam asnanti divyan divi deva-bhogan and

9.21 te tam bhuktva svarga-lokam visalam ksine punye martya-lokam visanti

  

Translation from ISKCON Bhagavad-gita as it is:

  

Bg 9.20: Those who study the Vedas and drink the soma juice, seeking the heavenly planets, worship Me indirectly. Purified of sinful reactions, they take birth on the pious, heavenly planet of Indra, where they enjoy godly delights.

  

Bg 9.21: When they have thus enjoyed vast heavenly sense pleasure and the results of their pious activities are exhausted, they return to this mortal planet again. Thus those who seek sense enjoyment by adhering to the principles of the three Vedas achieve only repeated birth and death.

  

\- However this friend of mine is insisting to know pramans from the Vedas for this. This will give certainly increase his faith in Sanatana dharma, particularly in reincarnation as He said.

  

\- I will be very grateful if someone can help me in this regard.

  

Hope this finds you All in good health!



Das,
