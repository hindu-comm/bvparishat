Namo Namah,

  

I am interested in learning Sanskrit language. I have no prior knowledge of it but since I am Hindi bhashi I think I can try learning it. I am learning it on my own. I have also enrolled for spoken Sanskrit class workshop held by Samskritam Bharathi in my campus which will commence from tomorrow till 10th of Nov.

I want to know the duration of the course " Panini's Vyakaran". I'll be interested if it's online as I can't attend regular classes. I live in Bengaluru.

Dhanywaad.

> Nyaya Shastram is, together with Shastriiya Vyakaranam, considered the > foundation for study of Samskritam in Gurukulams and Universities > throughout India. This has indeed been the classical tradition for > hundreds of years. Yet in the modern Samskrita Universities, the > traditional method for teaching this Nyaya is tough to follow. As a > result, after students complete the one year Nyaya requirement, most > choose to major in other subjects like Samskrita literature.

A new Nyaya text-- Vidyadharii -- makes Nyaya > readily accessible and easy to follow through the use of a pictorial > approach. Concepts which have traditionally seemed tough and obscure, > now become lucid and simply through the use of pictures. Join us and > see how it works!
