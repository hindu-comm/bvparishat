Respected and dear members of the Parishat,

  

I have the pleasure of informing you that UGC (India) has helped us prepare the E-Contents of a course on *Indian Grammatical Tradition- PaaNinian Grammar*.The modules have been written by Prof. Kapil Kapoor and Prof J P Dimri (Formerly Professor, Department of Russian, EFL University, Hyderabad), who have deep insights into the two disciplines- Linguistics and Sanskrit .We hope that this introduction will be of use to students of both the disciplines. It is one of 18 papers prepared for students at the Post-Graduate level under the UGC EPG Pathshala Programme. We get to access the material by typing “**Linguistics EPG Pathshala INFLIBNET**” on Google. The page opens directly on Linguistics. The present course is Paper 14.



With kind regards,



Pramod Pandey
