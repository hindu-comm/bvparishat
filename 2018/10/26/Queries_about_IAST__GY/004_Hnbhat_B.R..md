You are mixing English custom and Sanskrit transliteration. Apostophy is used after any name English or Sanskrit according to English grammatical usage and in transliteration it is used for avagraha in Sanskrit used in place of purvasavarna which is conentional to denote missing 'a' in devanagari script, but not a grammatical requirement.
