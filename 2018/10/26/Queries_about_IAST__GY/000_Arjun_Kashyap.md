Dear prominent scholars,  

  

I have few doubts in the transliteration of Sanskrit, I strongly beleive those will be solved here in this forum;  

  

1\. The word pārvatī in sambodhana isपार्वति!, in the usage of English that can be transliterated as O pārvatī, with दीर्घान्त because the 'O' is already indicating the sambodhana so no need of ह्रस्व ending. (is this kind of assertion is right?)  

  

2\. I have seen many texts using kalā-s/ mālā-s in case of plural. Is this usage right? or is thereany alternative for such usages.  

  

3\. In the places of षष्ठीविभक्ति-- 's is commonly used, if there is a word in IAST i.e. sītā/gītā; should that be written as sītā's/gītā's or sīta's/gīta's?  

  

4\. While anusvāra usually 'ṃ' is used, in few places I have noticed using 'ṁ', which is the right one?  

  

Which are the right usages in these cases as per रूढि,Kindly guide me.  

  

Regards.
