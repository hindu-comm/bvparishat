Dear sir,

Thanks a lot, I really got some helpful information from your reply.

Yes I do know the difference between translation and transliteration. I got the clarity for first 2 and the last point but,

If in case of plural kalA-s and mAlA-s are right then in the usage of apostrophe ('), if it is reserved for avagraha, how can we use it in sItA' s etc.

I apologise if the question is repeated.

  

Regards

Arjun Kashyap.
