I guess you know the difference between translation and transliteration.

Transliteration is presenting a given text in a different script.

  

1\. "Oh pArvati" is neither translation nor transliteration.

"pArvati !" is the transliteration of the *sambuddhi* form.

"Oh pArvatI" is translation, not transliteration.

  

2\. *kalA*-s, *mAlA*-s :

"-s" is a good way of presenting a Sanskrit term in a plural form.

( I leave "-s", the plural marker, unitalicised - in order to indicate its extraneity.)

This becomes necessary often in the case of non-translatables/word-discussions.

You are thereby indicating that you have added an English-plural-suffix to a Sanskrit word/base.

Otherwise you may not be sure about the role of the "s"

as to whether it belongs to the word-ending or whether it serves as a plural-indicator

\- as in, say,*rajas* and *rAjAs*.

  

3\. sItA's/gItA's - are the right forms.

Why will they lose their long final?

Hold on to the *prAtipadika*-form.

  

4\. "m" with a dot above or dot below?

I prefer the former, though both are current.

  

My preference is for its resemblance with the mark of the Sanskrit *anusvAra*.

The other is on account of its symmetry with the diacritics for the cerebrals (*mUrdhan*-s).

Each has its own logic, but then, use one of them consistently throughout,

and indicate at the outset what you are wont to use.

  

5\. I hope this serves your purpose and clarifies your doubts,

but there may be better answers/approaches than mine.

So you are welcome to explore further.

  

(Sorry for my own system of diacritics - owing to some problem with my computer.)
