Sir,

  Thanks a lot for the link. This translation is based on the 2nd edition.

  I recollect having been informed of this English translation about 12 years ago. But I had not seen this book.

  For those who are used to the Paninian style of grammar, the first edition will be more interesting.

  For a recent work "A GRAMMAR OF MALAYALAM" by Dr Ravi Sankar S Nair may be downloaded from here:

  Thanks and regards

  Narayan Prasad
