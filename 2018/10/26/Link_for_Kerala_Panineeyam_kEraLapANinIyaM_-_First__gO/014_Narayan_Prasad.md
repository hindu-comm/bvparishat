Sir,

 Thank you so much for the information.

 This 1896 edition book is very valuable and hence it should be preserved as a soft copy with good resolution.

 I don't know whether the reprint edition of 1996 has preserved its paginations or not, because I have not been able yet to see the first edition.

  

 In the online version of its 2nd edition the English Introduction of Narayana Pillai has been removed, I don't know why. Maybe, due to his remarks at the end which I have already quoted in my initial message.

  

 Best regards

 Narayan Prasad
