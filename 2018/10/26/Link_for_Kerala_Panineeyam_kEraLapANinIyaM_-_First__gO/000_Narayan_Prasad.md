Extract from theEnglish Introduction of P.K. Narayana Pillai, p.xxvii (2nd edition 1917):

“**Though it professes only to be a second edition, a superficial reader mayfail to discover much ground common to both the editions. To all appearance the present edition with the alternations and additions, amounts to what one may call an‘allotrophic modification’of the original work**”.



 “**I feela sort of personal loss in the omission of the Sutraswhich proved such a delight to me to tackle and to master.**”
