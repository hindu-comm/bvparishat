Thank you, sir, for this link. Earlier also you have given a general link and I did browse through that.

  

From this article:

  

\<\<At the end of this century up to 95% of the world’s languages will be moribund or extinct (Krauss 1992: 4-10, Crystal 2000, Nettle & Romaine 2000, Whalen 2012: 155-173).>\>

  

References are from two different centuries. Hopefully, "this century" means 21st century. I have not checked what Krauss (1992) and others have said.

  

Best regards

Narayan Prasad
