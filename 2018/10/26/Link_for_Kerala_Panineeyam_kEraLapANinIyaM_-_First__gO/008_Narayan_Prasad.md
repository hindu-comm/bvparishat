Dear Sir,

  namaste !

  The link you have given is for the 2nd edition.

  I have a xerox copy of the 1st edition. But it is very faint and is not properly readable.

  The first edition is a Malayalam grammar in the sUtra style, whereas the 2nd one is in the kArikA style.

  For a better idea of the first edition attached are a few scanned excerpts from this book.

  The first sUtra states what is varNNam.

  The 2nd sUtra defines what is svaram.

  The 3rd sUtra defines what is vyanjanam.

  Regards

  Narayan Prasad
