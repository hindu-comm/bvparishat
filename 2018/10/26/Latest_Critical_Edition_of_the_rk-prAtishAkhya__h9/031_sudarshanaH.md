Thank youSri. Sridatta, for the information about the IGNCA's manuscripts library at Bangalore.

  

Interested scholars may first search for the manuscript online at the [IGNCA's online catalog search](http://ignca.bestbookbuddies.com/cgi-bin/koha/opac-search.pl)& obtain the "call number". This number is needed to extract the microfilm tape at their archives. The ever helpful librarian Mr. Prakash at the library, will be able to quickly retrieve your manuscript.

  
Regards,

Sudarshana
