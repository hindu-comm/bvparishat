Dear Professor Jha,

  

  Here is the WeTransfer download link:<https://we.tl/t-tFbcTdYtkl>  

  

Please download the files soon, before the link goes dead in a week or so. When you download, I think it downloads as a zip archive, and then you have to unzip it to access the three pdfs. Let me know if you have any difficulty in downloading. With best regards,

  

Madhav M. Deshpande

Professor Emeritus
