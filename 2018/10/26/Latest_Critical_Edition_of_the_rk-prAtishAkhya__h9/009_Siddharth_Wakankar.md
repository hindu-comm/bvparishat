Dear Sanhita,

  

I think, now, youngsters like you should try your hand at critically editing such works which were published years ago.

  

In fact,the entire Kavyamala Series of the Nirnay Sagar Press,Mumbai, needs to be re.edited by consulting the newly found MSS.

  

It will be a very good addition to the rich collections in the libraries.

  

It is a team work if some friends come together and undertake this gigantic task.

  

I would like to help(if at all it is needed) them whenever it is possible.

  

Best luck.

  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
