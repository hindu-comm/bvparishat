As Prof. Madhav Deshpande ji and others noted there is difficulty in access of manuscripts and their digital copies (even for scholars). Some manuscripts libraries entirely lock access, whereas some others charge exorbitantly even per page for the copies. So this depends on the institutions and the concerned officials there, whereas some others are cooperative.

Also many organisations like eGangotri or IFP, British library Endangered archives etc. having done great work by digitizing
manuscripts making them available online.

Also National mission for Manuscripts,IGNCA have digitized large number of mss. and have digital copies, as the rights are with the owners like institutions and private individuals, they don't share the digital copies without the owners' prior permission.

I feel there should be a legal solution with the passage of a bill or change in rules wrt rights and access of manuscripts.

As of July 2018 NMM has digitized 283 lakh pages of 2.96 lakh manuscripts as noted in this Press release
<http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=180869>

Here in another press release by Ministry of Culture, they note "To resolve the copyright issue, Ministry has constituted a committee to draft a Bill regarding accessibility of Manuscripts." <http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=177091>

Also there is issue of memory around 1000 terabytes of space is required to store them. And there is lack of web space to access them via web portals.

Here I may also note the position of Director of NMM was vacant from 2014 to 2016 as the director wasn't appointed.

In this newspaper report, the official from IGNCA says they have a target of December for the launch of online Digital Manuscripts Repository platform. <https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/3-lakh-ancient-indian-manuscripts-will-be-accessible-online-soon/article24754254.ece>

But I don't know about further progressions regarding this. One may contact officials of IGNCA and NMM for further details.

Also it seems the library of South regional centre, IGNCA which is located near Kalagrama and Bangalore University, Mallattahalli , Bengaluru open to students and scholars. I think one can access the books and microfilmed manuscripts through a membership. The library is open on Saturdays from this month as well. The residents of Bengaluru and Karnataka can visit and contact them for details. The library has 22,000 microfilm rolls covering 2,85,000 manuscripts.
