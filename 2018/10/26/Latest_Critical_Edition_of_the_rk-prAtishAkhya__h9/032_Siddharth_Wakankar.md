Dear Shri Ajit,

  

Sorry for the delay in my answer to your mail.

  

There are two angles to look at the problem,one,of the custodians of MSS.and two,of the scholars who need the copies.

  

Generally,the custodians feel that due acknowledgement be made by the scholars of the Institute which provides copies.It so happens that despite signing the agreement form undertaking to give two copies free of charge,the scholars either don't give copies or even do not give due credit for the institute.

  

Secondly,after getting the copies,some scholars make money out of it by giving copies to others and the Institute suffers financially.Hence,some Institutes charge exorbitantly,which is many a time difficult for the individual to pay and he abandons his work.

  

Thirdly, those who are ready to do free of charge microfilming/digitisation of MSS.do not give undertaking that they will direct the scholars to the respective institutes for getting copies of MSS.thus again, depriving the original custodian of his monetary dues.

  

Fourthly,it so happens that after the publication of the text based on the MSS., the author conveniently forgets his agreement and does not give copies to the institute.

  

This is against ethics,prompting the custodian to refuse to supply copies.

  

From the angle of individual scholars,it is beyond their capacity to pay such a high charge for copies of MSS.of his interest.

  

One thing could be done.

  

The respective state governments should take initiative,like the NAMAMI [etc.to](http://etc.to) provide funds to the custodians to digitise their MSS.and make them available to scholars after announcement of such endeavours.

  

There are many issues involved in this process which could be discussed in meetings and not by just letters and mails.

  

Hope,you got some tangible things from this mail, though,I have limited my scope to only a few points.

  

Just let me know your views.

  

Thanks and regards.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
