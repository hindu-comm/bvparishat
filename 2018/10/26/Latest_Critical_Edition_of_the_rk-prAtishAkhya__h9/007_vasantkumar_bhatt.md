Respected Prof. Deshpande ji,

Namaste !

Please provide me a pdf copy of Dr. Mangaldev's edition ( with English translation). It will be very useful to me as well as my one Ph. D. Student.

  By the way, I would like to inform you that there is a manuscript of one विवृति commentary, which is unpublished, in Kerala university MSS library (Trivendrum).

Regards and thanks
