While Veerendrakumar Verma's edition of the R̥gveda-Pratiśākhya with an extensive Hindi commentary is indeed very useful, he does not consult any new manuscript material. In his preface, he gives a brief survey of different editions of the RP, and refers to Mangal Deva Shastri's edition in three parts. In the first part of that edition, Mangal Deva Shastri gives details of the manuscripts he consulted for his edition.
This is the only edition that comes close to a critical edition based on a study of different manuscripts.
