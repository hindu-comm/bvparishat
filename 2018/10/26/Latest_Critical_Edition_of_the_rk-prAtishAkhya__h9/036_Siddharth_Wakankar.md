Dear Prof.Deshpande,

  

Thanks for your appreciative mail.  

  

I worked in the Oriental Institute, Baroda,for more than 32 years,that too,in the Manuscripts Section.As a result,I have a rich and varied experience and first hand information of what happens in such institutes.

  

Some scholars,who are giants in their field,don't even give copies of the publications.

  

Such instances galore.Therefore,I remarked=less said is better and more said is worst.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
