Namaste Prof. Deshpande ji,

  

In the experience of our public charitable our foundation Sri Gargeshwari Digital foundations whose mission is to Scan and digitize rare books and manuscripts. Many good institutions having manuscripts are ready to get their manuscripts digitized but are reluctant to make their scanned material publicly available even for published works. Since our foundation does all digitizing free of cost for institutions having manuscripts and rare books getting access to collections has not been a problem, it really depends on the management of the institution whether to grant digesting permission or not. A few institutions and individuals who have large manuscripts collection are reluctant even now to get their collections digitized even if it is for free, after explaining that digitization doesn't damage their manuscripts and even after offering them written non public distribution agreement.
