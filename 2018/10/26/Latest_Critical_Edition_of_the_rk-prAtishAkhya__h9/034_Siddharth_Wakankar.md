Dear Ajit,

  

You are absolutely right.Thanks for your prompt and valuable input.

  

The MSS.are meant to be studied.So,all possible help be given to the scholars,do that knowledge gets shared.It will prove the Indian stand that vyaye krute vardhate eva nityam.

  

How many custodians will subscribe to this view is the main point.

  

It has become a kind of a business to supply copies if you have the collection.

  

Less said is better,more said is worst.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
