Thank you I am aware of IGNCA and NMM  

10,000 terabytes Sounds like a impossible figure that nearly 10 petabytes of data. That would require a data center ten the size of the worlds The total storage o google is around I petabyte

Here we have Kolos’ upcoming data centre, which will be located on the North of the Arctic Circle in Ballangen, Norway. Kolos are calling it the world’s largest data centre as it is expected to scale up to a capacity of 1000 megawatts of computing power.

The facility, which is expected to open in 2018, will boast nearly 6.5 million sq ft of space acrossfour-storeys.

The facility will be powered to a large extend by Norway's abundant hydropower capability.

Overall, the new data centre will not only offer a large facility, but is also due to deliver a unique hyperscale data centre, built with sustainability and security in mind

Please note all digitized books nad manuscripts in the world the size does not exceed 2.5 petabyte that would for more 16,500 crore books
