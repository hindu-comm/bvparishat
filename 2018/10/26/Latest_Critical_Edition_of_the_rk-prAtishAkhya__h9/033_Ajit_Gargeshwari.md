You views are correct I have no dispute . I am not trying to argue with a profound scholar like you These are my views.

  

One making money out of manuscripts being digitised has to be proven. Oriental institutes are custodians of the original they cannot claim rights on materials they have not written. Have oriental research institutes exhausted all manuscripts resources available with them. If they cannot get all the editions why not allow others who can.

Oriental institutes are designed to do research. Digitising is a specialist job why enter into areas where you have no expertise facility or money. Digitisation is slow expensive and time consuming process.

  

If the originals perish and get detoriarated neither will you have the originals neither digital copies. Many are so fragile physical handling of originals need to be minimised.

  

One can have an agreement with Digitiser's. If Digitiser's makes profits then it can be shared. There is a difference between making money to meet expenses and making large profits. If authors who have taken your material not given you acknowledgement in their publication and have broken your agreementthen you can go to court.

  

Our foundation never claims any right cultural or copywrite for materials belonging to institutions or individuals possessing rare books or manuscripts.

  

If you want better editions of books newer editions then its the duty or MSS depositaries to make their materials accessible to all interested scholars the only way to do is to get your collections digitised first. For your own internal or external use first then you can consider if you want to charge for your digitised materials or ask users to pay you a fee for consulting or using materials belonging to you.
