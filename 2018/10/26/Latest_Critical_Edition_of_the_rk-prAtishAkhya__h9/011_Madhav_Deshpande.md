I am almost certain that now we have access to a larger number of manuscripts of the R̥gveda-Prātiśākhya and its commentary by Uvaṭa than what was available to M.D. Shastri, and so there is indeed some scope to produce a new critical edition. However, to my knowledge, among the existing editions, M. D. Shastri's edition is as close to a critical edition as we can have.
