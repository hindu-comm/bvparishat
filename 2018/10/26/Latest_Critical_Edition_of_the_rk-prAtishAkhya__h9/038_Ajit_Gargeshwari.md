From here how do we go forward.

I have tried a possible solution like people weaving charaka keep one folio down the scanner with the depositary having control over the digital output with a promise they will make the digital resource if not the original accessible I can see the possibility of our manuscript wealth reaching all scholars and public as well without one having to beg plead or use back channels to get photocopies or PDFs. There are donors who will sponsor are we ready to supplement and compliment government and institution efforts. If all partner and work together from this moment not wait for ever it can be done.
