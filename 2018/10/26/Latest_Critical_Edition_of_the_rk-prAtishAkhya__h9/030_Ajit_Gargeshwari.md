Please don't quote news papers and blogs. I was interested to make available and access of manuscripts as digital copies and how to create such arepository which supplements and complements existing repositories which have made a partially some the manuscripts available with them accessible to interested scholars. My idea is to make our manuscripts heritage accessible to scholars free of cost so that they can come out better and improved version of existing texts and new texts
