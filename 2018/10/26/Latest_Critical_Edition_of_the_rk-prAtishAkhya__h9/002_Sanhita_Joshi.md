Respected Wakankarsir,

  

Firstly thank you for the response!

  

I am a native Marathi speaker. I have thecopy of the edition and the translation ofRk-Prātiśākhyaby Pt. Shintre which is published in 1939 from Mumbai. But it is not critical edition. I came across the critical edition of the same by Mangal Dev Shastri (published in 1931) alone. Hence, I was curious to know about any later or recent critical edition of the same.

  

Sincere regards

Sanhita Joshi.
