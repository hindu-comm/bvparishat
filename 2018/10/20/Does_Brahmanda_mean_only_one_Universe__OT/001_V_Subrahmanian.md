Yes, Brahmanda, jagat, vishva are all synonyms and means universe.
There is one Brahmanda at a time, consisting of 14 loka-s. Satyaloka is the highest above Bhuloka and there are seven 'under' Bhuloka, ending with pAtAla.

  

There is an expression 'anEka-koTi-brahmANDa-janani' to denote the Adya Shakti. This means that several Brahmanda-s come into being and get destroyed sequentially.
