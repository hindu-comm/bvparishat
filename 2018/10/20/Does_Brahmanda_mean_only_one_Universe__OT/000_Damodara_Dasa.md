Respected Vidvaj-janas,  
  
The words, Brahmanda, jagat, and visva appear in sastras innumerable  
number of times.  
  
Is it correct to say that brahmanda means one universe and that jagat or  
visva refers to all the brahmandas collectively?  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
