That is not the state of scholarship.

  

That is the state of political manipulation of academics.

  

Imagine if China owned up Buddhism not communism and used Buddhist achievements as contributing to its Chinese national pride.

  

They are not doing it.

  

So it is safe or not harmful, in terms of competition in global market to side with Buddhism to use it to denigrate Hinduism achievements of which are being used for contributing to the morale boosting of Indian nation which is the other big contender in the global competition of economies.
