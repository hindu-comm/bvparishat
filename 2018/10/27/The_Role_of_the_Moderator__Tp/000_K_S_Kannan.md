We commend Prof. Paturi's alertness and sense of restraint in ensuring that

the Forum does not descend into becoming an easy playground for libel and scandal,

howsoever true (or not) the content of the charges that are/could be made.

  

There could very well be other authentic and licit avenues for the airing/registering/seeking redressal

of the iniquities that individuals/systems are open to or prone to.
