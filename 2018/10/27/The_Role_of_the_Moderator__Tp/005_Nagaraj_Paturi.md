\> Question for Clarification : Where did the current debate fit in or  
violate the BVP frame work ? Was the starting of the thread a ‘ Specific  
incident / specific individual OR a SYSTEM ISSUE ?  

  

------ Management allowed it only because it thought starting of the thread probably was a 'system issue' ( a discussion on system in general), not specific incident/specific individual.

  

It has already been explained how it later dwindled into a discussion on specific incident/specific individual.

  

Rest is already explained.

  

The senior member is requested to point out a specific portion of the BVP posting guidelines which he feels is violated by the management.
