It is not from any root in the धातुपाठ, but from a nominal verb from अमत्र meaning a vessel as explained by Sundareshan. पाणिद्वयम् अमत्रं कुर्वन्ति - अमत्रयन्ति इति अमत्रयन्तः! अमत्रयन् - अमत्रयन्तौ - अमत्रयन्तः plural of verbal noun शत्रन्त - अमत्रयत् stem.

Meaning: making both hands as vessel to eat पाणिद्वयं भोक्तुम् अमत्रयन्तः!
