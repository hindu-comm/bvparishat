Sri Ramana Murthy-ji,

  

Prof. Korada has already warned to choose the right books.

  

Writer of the book from which you shared the snapshot does not seem to have the discerning ability to distinguish between treatment of a linguistic form

  

from a historical and descriptiveperspective. Panini's treatment is descriptive and need not have consonance with historical perspective that this author

  

appears to seek to carry. The word 'artificial' in reference to the analysis of linguistic forms done by a grammarian is used by Paninian school itself. Bhartrihari representing his school, does this in his Vaakyapadiyam. But that is from a different philosophical perspective than this.
