Dear Dr Ramaratnam,

It says you are the author. Would you please write briefly how the poets or poetics

have influenced the drama and folk theater? Particularly, it would be of interest to

track the dhvani simulation in various poets' works and their portrayalon stage through

Natyashastra or other protocol. You can post excerpts if they are available.

Thank you.

BM
