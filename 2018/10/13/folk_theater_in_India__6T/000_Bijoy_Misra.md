Dear friends,

Lately we have been studying various literature on poetics and expressions

to understand the development of literature. I just studied Mammata's Kavyaprakasha

today. My impression is that the book is a compilation of ideas already in practice

like Panini's grammar does to the spoken language. While creation of "dhvani" is a

writer's skill, I would think that it has its application in the dramatic presentation

of stories where acting would involve suggestion.

I would like scholars to share their observations on the literature of poetics, like

ध्वन्यालोकः, काव्यादर्शः, and काव्यप्रकशः.  

Best regards,

BM

  

PS. While I talk about studies, I share the announcement of our next

seminar Nov 3. Be my guest in the Seminar if you would visit Boston.
