Dear Scholars,

This is to state that the folk theater in India has been discussed at considerable length in *Dance Drama in Theory and Practice* published by Munshiram Manoharlal, Delhi. It could be useful for anybody working on the ancient theater of India.  

with regards,

Dr.S.Ramaratnam,

Vice Chancellor,

Jagadguru Kripalu University,

Odisha
