Dear Dr. Bijoy Mishra,

  

I thank you for your mail. Most certainly I will send a write up on the points raised by you. I have been teaching and researching on Dhvani and various aspects of Drama for the past 50 years and so it is my duty to do it. But please give me some time. I am preoccupied till the end of the month. You may also visit my website at [www.ratnam.weebly.com](http://www.ratnam.weebly.com) I am attaching a material which may be of interest to you.  

  

with regards,

ramaratnam
