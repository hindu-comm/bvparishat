Very kind of you Mr Subramanyam korada. I myself an arhatha veda Pandit and do smartkarma and Purohit Karma.

  

In smartkarma Karma ankuraropana had only Palika but where is in aagama there is use off three things namely "Palika Sherawa ghatika".

I am new to agama, I am told about the shapes of these utensils as.. ghatikaa is like pot shape or what we call kooja in Telugu, and palika is bowl like in shape and sharava as plater in shape as you said. so I have posted this query here just to confirm these shapes.

thank you for your information and I need some what information about the ankurarpanam in shaiva agama vidhanam thankyou.
