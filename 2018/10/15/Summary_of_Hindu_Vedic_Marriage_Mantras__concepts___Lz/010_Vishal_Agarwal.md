Namaskar!

  

Yes, it is Doc No. B16 from the list attached. This is a project that I have been working on for some time now. The goal is provide an emic (insider) view of our world views, darshanas, understandings etc. without undue reliance on inapplicable etic Indological/anthropological and other theories even though I am fairly conversant with the latter. As the docs are in various stages of preparation, I'd be glad to share whatever is ready if you write to me offline.

  

Regards,

  

Vishal Agarwal
