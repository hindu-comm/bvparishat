Namaskar,

  

Does anyone have a concise overview document about the meanings, ideology, translation of Hindu Vedic Marriage?

  

I need this soon if someone has it. This is for a non-indianaudience (western) so that they get an idea of what a hindumarriage means. Hence it cannot be very deep in Sanskrit etc. it should give the summary in simple terms in English. Of course if the mantras like saptapadi etc. are explained it will be great. mention of sanskritmantras is OK. I am not looking for a serious deepvyakhyanaor comparison of vyakhanas

  

thanks

  

I deeply appreciate this.
