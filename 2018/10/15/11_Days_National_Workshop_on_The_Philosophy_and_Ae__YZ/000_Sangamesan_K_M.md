**11 Days National Workshop**on

**ThePhilosophy and Aesthetics of Abhinavagupta**

****



 The Department of Sanskrit Sahitya is organising **11 Days National Workshop**on**The****Philosophy and Aesthetics of Abhinavagupta**from 1^(st)to 11^(th)of November, 2018. The Main objective of the Workshop is to provide an understanding about the Trika philosophy of Kashmir, which highly influenced Sanskrit aesthetic theories.

 The theories of Rasa and Dhvani play a prominent role in eastern literary criticism. It is Abhinavagupta, who firstly interpreted the philosophical undertones of these theories with an innovative perspective. In this venture, he has used the theories and categories of Kashmiri Saivism. Several poeticians like Kuntaka and Mahimabhatta also had a sound footing in Kashmir Saivism. The students of Sanskrit literature are expected to be familiar with the philosophical background of the aesthetic theories of Abhinavagupta and other Kashmirian poeticians. For this, College/University teachers handling Sanskrit literary criticism are to be equipped with a thorough understanding of the different aspects of Kashmir Saivism with special reference to its application in aesthetics. This National Workshop aims to fulfil this need and to better the academic level of the campuses.

 Eminent Scholars like Prof.Navjivan Rastogi, Prof.
Kamalesh Dath Tripathy, Prof. C. Rajendran and Prof.Sachidanda Misra will lead various sessions of the workshop. Medium of Instruction will be Sanskrit and English. There will be talks on general and particular topics on Kashmir Saivism, textual classes on relevant portions from
Kashmir Saivism and Sanskrit aesthetics. College/university teachers and research scholars interested in Indian philosophy and Aesthtics can apply. Preference will be given to the teachers who are engaged in teaching Sanskrit poetics and doing research in related subjects. Number of participants is limited to 40. Full time attendance on all days is compulsory. Working lunch and light refreshment will be given to all participants. No TA/DA will be provided to the participants. Interested persons are directed to apply online on or before 20^(th)October, 2018.
