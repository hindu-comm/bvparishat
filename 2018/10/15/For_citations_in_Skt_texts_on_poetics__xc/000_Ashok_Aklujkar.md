I should have added to my earlier post the following highly valuable work from a truly formidable scholar who, unfortunately, mostly remained under-appreciated:  
  
Kulkarni, V. M. 1988, 1990. Prakrit Verses in Sanskrit Works on Poetics. Two vols. Delhi: Bhogilal Leherchand Institute of Indology (Extension Centre, Patan, North Gujarat).B.L. Series no. 8.  
  
It also seems largely unknown to most members of this forum that Professors Rewa Pradad Dwivedi and Sadashiv Kumar Dwivedi have re-published almost all major Kāvya-śāstra works (originally published largely in the Kāvya-mālā Series of Nirṇayasāgara Press and in isolated editions). Better readings at several places is a valuable contribution of their effort. The publisher is Kālidāsa Saṁsthāna at Varanasi, 221 005. As of the last year, when I was in Varanasi for nearly two weeks to give lectures, six substantial volumes had been beautifully published under the title Sāhitya-śāstra-samuccayaḥ. All scholars of Sanskrit kāvya should have these volumes in their collection.
