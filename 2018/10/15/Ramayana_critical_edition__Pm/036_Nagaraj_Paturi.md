\> Here I would disagree. The above has a hidden implication that Valmiki was unable to capture the complete story of Rama, even in 20000+ verses. This would show poorly upon Valmiki. Moreover, if one claims that there is no original Ramayana, then one would have to give weightage to those stories that portray Rama in a very poor light. However, this is not the reason for my stance. I am just talking of the slippery slope that one can fall into, if one says there is no original Ramayana.  

  

--- You need not disagree with me. Because that is not my view. That is the view of a section of historical critical researchers. Your disagreement amounts to be with them.

'urtext' of Valmiki's Ramayana being pramANa being different from that being the only pramANa.

  

The Indic versions of Ramayana do not differ in spirit from Valmiki Ramayana.

  

To realise or to explain this aviruddhataa and ekavaakyataa is beyond the scope or size of a small email message.
