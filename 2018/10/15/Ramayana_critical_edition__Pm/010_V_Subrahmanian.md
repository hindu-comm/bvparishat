Here is an instruction/advice to Kausalya from Rama, in an earlier sarga:

  

अग्निकार्येषु च सदा सुमनोभिश्च देवताः।  
  
पूज्यास्ते मत्कृते देवि बाह्मणाश्चैव सुव्रताः।।2.24.28।।  
  

  
देवि O devi, मत्कृते for my sake, सदा always, देवताः the gods, अग्निकार्येषु in offering oblations to the fire god, सुमनोभिश्च with flowers, ते to you, पूज्याः worthy of worship, सुव्रताः true to their religious vows, ब्राह्मणाश्चैव brahmins also.  

  

For my sake, O devi worship the firegod with offerings of oblations and flowers, and brahmins who are true to religious vows.

  

  

In this sarga:<https://www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in/sloka?field_kanda_tid=2&language=dv&field_sarga_value=25>
Kausalya addresses Rama:

  

  

सर्वलोकप्रभुर्ब्रह्मा भूतभर्ता तथर्षयः।  
  
ये च शेषास्सुरास्ते त्वां रक्षन्तु वनवासिनम्।।2.25.25।।  
  

  
सर्वलोकप्रभुः lord of all the worlds, Siva, ब्रह्मा Brahma, भूतभर्ता supporter of beings, Visnu, तथा also, ऋषयः rishis, शेषाः the remaining, ये सुराः those gods, ते to you, वनवासिनम् dwelling in the forest, त्वाम् you, रक्षन्तु protect.  

  

May Siva, lord of all the worlds, Visnu, supporter of living beings, Brahma, rishis and all the rest of the gods protect you while you dwell in the forest

  

This entire sarga is worth reading. In various families, even today, during certain times / occasions of the year, serpents are worshiped. Asura, Balindra, is worshiped. I would think that if it was not a family tradition, Kausalya would not indulge in it.

The popular belief is about the worship, in Rameswaram, before/after the battle at Lanka, I was hinting at the regular, daily, devataarchana in the royal household of Rama. This would have included all devata-s including Shiva. From Kausalya's (cited) words, the Trimurti-s were worshiped. It can be reasonably guessed that Rama, in the normal times, as the eldest son of the family, would have performed the household puja, during normal times when Dasharatha could not do it.
