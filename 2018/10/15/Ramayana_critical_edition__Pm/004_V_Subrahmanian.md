There is a reference in the Ayodhya Kanda that Kausalya worshiped Shiva (and other deities) and she is seeking the divine protection (of the deities she worshiped) to Rama on the eve of his departure to the forest. From this I concluded that Rama's family was in the practice of worshiping Shiva. I recently saw the verses. If I locate them I shall present themto you here.
