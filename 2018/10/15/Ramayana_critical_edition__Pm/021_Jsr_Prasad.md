Sri Kalyan ji,

  

It is perfectly fine to agree to disagree. If you intend to look at literal meaning then you'll always land in (-mis)translation. But if you respect the prakaraNam (context) then you need interpretation. You may like to know the four types of word classification in Naiyayikas, to appreciate real spirit of word derivation.

  

Bhartrhari kindly offered 14 types of contextual factors of meaning. *anyasabda-sannidhi* (interpretation based on proximity with certain words) is one of them.

  

For verse, 5.55.17 it is not my interpretation, you may read it again. I said, most of the commentators translated/interpreted as 'रक्षणसमर्थेनापि' ।

  

I'd be happy to *agree* with given translation, if respected VaiyakaraNas here *disagree* the way the following was interpreted -

  

सर्वलोकप्रभुर्ब्रह्मा भूतभर्ता तथर्षयः।  
  
ये च शेषास्सुरास्ते त्वां रक्षन्तु वनवासिनम्।।2.25.25।  

  

By the way, you need to correct the typo at 'तथर्षयः' ।
