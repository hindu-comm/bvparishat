//Here sage Valmiki is pramANam, not the translator. I couldn't find this expression at 2.22.18 using IIT-K on line interface, you may please post the sloka itself//  
  
Dear Sir, you did not find it in IIT-K website because it is not critical edition. Here is the verse  
  
  
2022018a मयार्चिता देवगणाः शिवादयो; महर्षयो भूतमहासुरोरगाः  
2022018c अभिप्रयातस्य वनं चिराय ते; हितानि काङ्क्षन्तु दिशश्च राघव
