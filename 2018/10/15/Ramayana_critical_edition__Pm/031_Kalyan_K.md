//Not that the foreigners are not good Sanskrit scholars.Most of the time,they have some ulterior motives, notions,ideas [etc.to](http://etc.to) interpret Sanskrit Texts.  
  
Moreover, many don't have much clear insight in our culture and tradition and may interpret the text in a very different way,not in consonance with our tradition.//  
  
Dear Professor,  
  
My first preference would have been for a translation in Telugu of the critical edition, done by a scholar of both Telugu and Sanskrit. Since I am not aware of any such translation (while there are translations in Telugu, I dont know of any critical edition translation), I have to go with the one that I currently have.
