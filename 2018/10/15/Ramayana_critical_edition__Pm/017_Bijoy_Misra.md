Dear Sri Kalyan,

If I were you, I won't touch any translation work not produced by a person

who is not fully versed in Sanskrit or an Indian language.  

Translations done with the help of dictionaries must be rejected.

You can read the original loudly, you would understand. I would advise

to avoid English texts on Indian literature for any scholarly analysis..

Thank you.

Bijoy Misra
