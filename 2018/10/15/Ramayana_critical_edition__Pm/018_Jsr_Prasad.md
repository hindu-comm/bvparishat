धिगस्तु राजसं भावमनीशमनवस्थितम् ।

  

**ईश्वरेणापि** यद्रागान्मया सीता न रक्षिता ।। 5.55.17 ।।

  

is the lamentation of Hanuman having burnt the Lanka. ईश्वरेणापि = रक्षणसमर्थेनापि was the general translation offered in Bhushana, Tattvadipika and Tilaka.

  

What is more interesting is Padma Vibhushan Jagadguru Ramabhadracharya Ji once interpreted रुद्र forई्श्वर in one of his video lectures.
