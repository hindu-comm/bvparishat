Dear Sri Kalyan ji,

  



Thanks for quoting this verse. As you know, असुः = प्राणः according to Yaska. असुषु रमन्ते इति असुराः । Revering them is justified in example of 'उत्तिष्ठन्तु भूतपिशाचाः एते भूमिभारकाः । एतेषामविरोधेन ब्रह्मकर्म समारभे । So, the prayer is for 'avirodha.' Serpent worship in vyavahaara is seen in 'sarpa kaavu' (abode of snakes) in place like Kerala, even now. In paramaartha, sarpa represents the sushumna naadi. Ultimately, the prakaraNam decides whether it is the यौगिकार्थ or रूढ्यर्थ to be taken.
