Sri Paturiji  
  
  
//To get back to your original enquiry, your efforts to see which aspects of the popular beliefs about various aspects of Ramayana are found in the 'original text' ('urtext', 'archetype' or 'autograph') of that work is well appreciated. //  
  
  
Thank you. Let me explain the reason for my efforts. It is simply because I happen to belong to the group of Hindus that considers Valmiki Ramayana alone as the Pramana to understand how Rama behaved under various conditions, what dharma he followed, how did his story develop etc. I am among the group of Hindus who believe Valmiki Ramayana is the original and all other later (if they are really later, but see below) stories are just that -later stories. It does not mean I have contempt for the later beliefs/stories or look down upon them. It is just that I dont consider them as Pramana to understand the character of Rama. I want to see Rama as Valmiki saw him. Nothing more, nothing less.  
  
  
//That beliefs/understanding about Rama, Hanuman etc. among the masses of India and among practicing Hindus go beyond the text of Valmiki's Ramayana is so well established among the historical critical researchers//  
  
  
Here I dont disagree. But I dont belong to the above group. For me Valmiki alone is the original source.  
  
  
//so much that some of them theorised that Valmiki's text itself is a compilation of a certain version(s) of the narrative that were prevalent among the masses from several centuries before the composition of the text.//  
  
  
Here I would disagree. The above has a hidden implication that Valmiki was unable to capture the complete story of Rama, even in 20000+ verses. This would show poorly upon Valmiki. Moreover, if one claims that there is no original Ramayana, then one would have to give weightage to those stories that portray Rama in a very poor light. However, this is not the reason for my stance. I am just talking of the slippery slope that one can fall into, if one says there is no original Ramayana.  
  
  
//So as per such historical critical perspectives, the popular beliefs/understandings regarding /connected to the events and characters in the narratives need not always be looked at as additions to or modifications of an 'original text' ('urtext', 'archetype' or 'autograph') of Valimiki's Ramayana. //  
  
  
I would look at anything that is not there in the Valmiki Ramayana (and that too critical edition only) as an addition or modification. Here we have to agree to disagree. Having said that, I would also give weightage to Ramopakhyana of the Mahabharata, as that too is an ancient story.  
  
  
//That apart, placing historical critical perspectives as a basis for checking the 'validity' of popular beliefs//  
  
  
I have no interest in judging the validity of the beliefs of others. My stance is, "If xyz is not there in Valmiki Ramayana, I dont take it as Pramana". If someone else wants to believe in xyz, then that is their choice. But dont ask me to believe in xyz.  
  
  
I could have just read the free version of valmiki Ramayana on the net, but that too would not satisfy me. I believe I have to go into the critical edition alone to understand the mind of Valmiki. Here I agree that I am placing some faith on the editors of the critical edition.  
  
  
//As long as an enquiry doesn't involve such condescension towards the reality of a culture, historical critical enquiry as one of the interesting and enjoyable academic activities available in the contemporary academic world, doesn't lead to further problems.//  
  
  
While I appreciate your advice, this exercise is more than academic for me. I want to understand Rama, as Valmiki saw him. Hope that clarifies my intentions.
