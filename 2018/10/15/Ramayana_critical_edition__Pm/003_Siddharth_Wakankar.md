Dear Scholar,

  

Could you read the volumes of the English Translation of the Valmiki Ramayana,so ably done by Prof.Robert Goldman and his wife, Sally Sutherland.

  

Moreover,if you read the Introductions to the different Kandas of the VR.by the respective General Editors,many of your doubts or queries will get solved.

  

Best luck in your search.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
