//If you want to see Rama as Valmiki saw you need to see it as text of Dharma.//  
  
Ok, I will keep this in my mind.  
  
  
//Those who see it as an 'othering' 'oppressive' text can not help you see it as Valmiki saw it because as any other does not his own text as a 'toxic',' othering' and 'oppressive' text.//  
  
  
I will keep this also in my mind while reading Prof Pollock's translation. Thanks for your inputs.
