I have that book with me...also he has authored a book 'rAmAyaNa samAlochanaM' which I have. Good books from critical perspective on Ramayana. He is a retired professor of Botany from Osmania University but good sanskrit scholar. He is a madhwa by faith and a good friend of Mahamahopadhyaya Pullela Sriramachandrudu Garu and the Critical Edition of Ramayana has the preface from MM Pullela Garu.

  

Our revered member Aravinda Rao Ji knows this gentleman.
