I was able to procure the critical edition of Ramayana and its translation. (Some volumes are translated by Sheldon Pollock, the favorite punching bag of many. More on that later.) For those who may be curious to know the answers to my questions (after my first quick, but by no means thorough, read) -  
  
  
//1. Is Rama portrayed as incarnation of Vishnu? //  
  
Yes. But he is normally shown as a human being.  
  
  
//2. Is Sita portrayed as incarnation of Lakshmi? //  
  
Yes. But she is also normally shown as a human being.  
  
  
//3. Does Aditya hrudayam occur in the critical edition? //  
  
Could not find it!! (Will need to confirm.)  
  
  
//4. Is rAmo vigrahavAn dharmah there in the critical edition? //  
  
Yes.  
  
  
//5. Is Hanuman treated as incarnation of Shiva? //  
  
Could not find any references.  
  
  
//6. At the end of the war, do Brahma, Shiva and Indra appear before Rama? //  
  
Yes.  

  
  
7. Does Rama say that he considers himself a human being? Does Brahma reveal to Rama his divine nature?  
  

Yes.  

  
  
8. Does Rama worship Shiva?  
  

Could not find any references.  

  
  
9. Is Ravana treated as a devotee of Shiva?  
  

Could not find any references. Will need to confirm. (Open to corrections).
