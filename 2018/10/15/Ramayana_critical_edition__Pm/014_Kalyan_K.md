सर्वलोकप्रभुर्ब्रह्मा भूतभर्ता तथर्षयः।  
  
ये च शेषास्सुरास्ते त्वां रक्षन्तु वनवासिनम्।।2.25.25।  
  

//May Siva, lord of all the worlds, Visnu, supporter of living beings, Brahma, rishis and all the rest of the gods protect you while you dwell in the forest//  
  
  
If you look at the verse, neither Siva nor Visnu are actually named. There is no need to invoke their names in the translation.  
  
  
Sheldon Pollock gives a different translation for this, which in my opinion captures it more accurately -  
  
  
May brahmA, the sustainer of creatures and lord of all the worlds, may the seers and the rest of the gods guard you while you are living in the forest.
