//A translation by a translator who considers the source language toxic and the source author and work 'othering' and oppressive is justifiably suspected to be biased against the source author and work and his translation is justifiably looked at as a mistranslation.//  
  
  
Paturiji, it is one thing to suspect bias and another thing to show it in the translation. Prof Pollock himself implied somewhere that while there is freedom of interpretation of text, there is less freedom of translation, for the translator has to stick to the text. I would not consider Prof Pollock's translation unworthy, despite all his opinions, unless I actually see some material that thoroughly discredits his translation. I haven't seen any such material.  
  
While we are on the topic, here is my problem with some Indian translators (I may be wrong here). With all the good intentions in the world, they tend to superimpose current day or later day beliefs and ideas on an ancient text.
