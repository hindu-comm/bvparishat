Namaste to all scholars  
  
Please let me know if anyone has read the Ramayana critical edition. I am aware of the (Sanskrit and translated) version of Ramayana on the net. I am not referring to that one.  
  
I have a few questions to the scholars on the critical edition (minus the uttara khanda).  
  
1. Is Rama portrayed as incarnation of Vishnu?  
  
2. Is Sita portrayed as incarnation of Lakshmi?  
  
3. Does Aditya hrudayam occur in the critical edition?  
  
4. Is rAmo vigrahavAn dharmah there in the critical edition?  
  
5. Is Hanuman treated as incarnation of Shiva?  
  
6. At the end of the war, do Brahma, Shiva and Indra appear before Rama?  
  
7. Does Rama say that he considers himself a human being? Does Brahma reveal to Rama his divine nature?  
  
8. Does Rama worship Shiva?  
  
9. Is Ravana treated as a devotee of Shiva?  
  
Any help on these questions would be gratefully appreciated.
