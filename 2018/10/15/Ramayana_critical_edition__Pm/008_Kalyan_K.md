//There is a reference in the Ayodhya Kanda that Kausalya worshiped Shiva (and other deities) and she is seeking the divine protection (of the deities she worshiped) to Rama on the eve of his departure to the forest.//  
  
  
Above reference is from 2.22.18. Here Kausalya says she worshipped gods, Siva and others, great seers, spirits, (even) great asuras and serpents. (Sheldon Pollock's translation).  
  
  
//From this I concluded that Rama's family was in the practice of worshiping Shiva. //  
  
  
Can we conclude from the same that Rama's family worshipped spirits, asuras and serpents also?  
  
  
I could not locate any reference to Rama himself worshiping Shiva (as is popularly believed).
