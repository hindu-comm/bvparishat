Dear Paturi ji,

  

Very nicely stated. For instance Hanuman is admitted to be Shiva-incarnation by Vaishnavas of the Northern region. Tulasi Ramayana is pramana for them. In the South this is not the case. Like this there are many views/beliefs across many people. All do not strictly go by the Valmiki Ramayana alone. As you have rightly observed, Valmiki has in his narrative given expression to practices, beliefs, etc. prevalent during his time and clime.

  

warm regards
