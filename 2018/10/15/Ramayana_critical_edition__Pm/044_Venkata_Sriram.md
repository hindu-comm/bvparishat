Namaste,

  

If the objective is to understand 'vAlmiki-hrudaya', then upAsana is required. For upAsaka, it is immaterial whether rAmAyaNa belongs to BORI edition or Gita Press Edition etc.

The person who is sceptical about 'Aditya-hrudaya', 'uttara-kANDa' and other episodes, how can he visualise the vAlmiki's vision ? Your pUjya-pitrupAda once told me that vAlmiki was a riSi (a seer) and can we fathom His vision unless we raise ourselves to that stature ?

  

A mantra-drSTa can only understand another mantra-drSTA.....that's what I feel. A riSi can understand another riSi.

  

Finally, the closure with words of pUjya jagatguru rAmabhadrAchArya :

  

**वाल्मीकि रामायण समझने के लिए एक लाख राम नाम का प्रतिदिन जाप आवश्यक है \|**  

  

rgs,

sriram
