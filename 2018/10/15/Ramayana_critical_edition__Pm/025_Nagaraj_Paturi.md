Dear Sri Kalyan-ji,

  

To get back to your original enquiry, your efforts to see which aspects of the popular beliefs about various aspects of Ramayana are found inthe 'original text' ('urtext', 'archetype'or 'autograph') of that work is well appreciated.

  

That beliefs/understanding about Rama, Hanuman etc. among the masses of India and among practicing Hindus go beyond the text of Valmiki's Ramayana is so well established among the historical critical researchers so much that some of them theorised that Valmiki's text itself is a compilation of a certain version(s) of the narrative that were prevalent among the masses from several centuries before the composition of the text.

So as per such historical critical perspectives, the popular beliefs/understandings regarding /connected to the events and characters in the narratives need not always be looked at as additions to or modifications of an'original text' ('urtext', 'archetype'or 'autograph') of Valimiki's Ramayana.

  

That apart, placing historical critical perspectives as a basis for checking the 'validity' of popular beliefs ( I don't conclusively say that your enquiry has this in it) in itself is an elitist condescension towards the reality of a culture.

  

As long as an enquiry doesn't involve suchcondescension towards the reality of a culture, historical critical enquiry as one of the interesting and enjoyable academic activities available in the contemporary academic world, doesn't lead to further problems.
