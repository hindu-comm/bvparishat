Dear Shri Kalyan,

  

Not that the foreigners are not good Sanskrit scholars.Most of the time,they have some ulterior motives, notions,ideas [etc.to](http://etc.to) interpret Sanskrit Texts.

  

Moreover, many don't have much clear insight in our culture and tradition and may interpret the text in a very different way,not in consonance with our tradition.

  

Best luck.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
