//'urtext' of Valmiki's Ramayana being pramANa being different from that being the only pramANa.//  
  
Then consider that it is the only pramANa for me. I think my posts have made this point abundantly clear already.  
  
//The Indic versions of Ramayana do not differ in spirit from Valmiki Ramayana.//  
  
The "spirit" of a text is something that is subjective. What you see as a text of dharma, Prof Pollock might see as a political text.
