\> And I could be wrong here, but I tend to have some distrust for commentators

  

\>But the commentators dont always agree with each other.

  

\> They tend to superimpose their own ideas on the text.

  

\> The Bhagavad Gita is the best example. We have various commentators interpreting the text differently to draw diametrically opposite conclusions.

  

------ That there are more than one commentator itself shows that there was never a rigid or stagnated understanding and there was a tradition and culture of differing interpretations. You are being advised to consult multiple commentaries itself shows that you are not being advised to go with a single idea. But consulting commentaries is always a good idea because then you are not travelling with the limited tools of comprehending an ancient work with a complex and rich cultural background. Commentators open up your mind to several new ways of understanding than you alone would have captured.
