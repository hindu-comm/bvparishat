//There are some five or six commentaries for the Valmiki Ramayana. With the help of these one can study the text.//  
  
  
Thank you. But the commentators dont always agree with each other. More on that later.  
  
And I could be wrong here, but I tend to have some distrust for commentators. They tend to superimpose their own ideas on the text. The Bhagavad Gita is the best example. We have various commentators interpreting the text differently to draw diametrically opposite conclusions.
