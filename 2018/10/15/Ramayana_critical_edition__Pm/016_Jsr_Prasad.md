Both interpretations are possible, however, it is the prakaraNam again that fixes contextual meaning. Brahma is part of Trinity that create, sustain and dissolve the cosmos. Brahma without Vishnu and Siva is incomplete in vyavahara, neither there is a system of worshipping him, except a single place in India.

  

If the reference is to the para-Brahman, then it is devoid of any guNas. Even Yogis do not pray him, they contemplate on it to achieve असंप्रज्ञातसमाधि ।
