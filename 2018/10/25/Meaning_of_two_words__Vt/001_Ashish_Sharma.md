Dear All Learned Scholars

  

I'm also eager to understand the difference between the two words.

If there is no difference then why not?

  

Pathbhrasht and Yog bhrasht difference between two ways or is it saying something difference?

  

Please reply.

  

Soumya Ji,

Please give details who has said that there is difference between both. Context will help us to understand issue in detail.

  

Best Regards

  

Ashish Sharma

OSD to President of

Indian Council of Astrological Sciences
