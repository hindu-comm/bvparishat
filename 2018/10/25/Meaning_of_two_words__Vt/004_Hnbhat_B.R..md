No difference in the meaning of 'bhraahta' any how calling implies something to fall from somewhere either from some way to somewhere or

  

or a hill top or tree. In English, patha means a way and in yoga
brashta it can mean both "fallen from yoga', if attained and if not attained, "fallen from the way to Yoga" in the niddle, before attaining the goal of Yoga, as you interpret from the context. What makes the difference? Please read the cy in English onयोगभ्रष्टोऽभिजायते।।6.41।।
