Respected Ashwini Kumarji,

  

thanks for your response and please excuse me for delay in answering, as I was busy otherwise.

  

The word "bhrashta" has the meaning of fallen down or fallen from. Hence yoga bhrashta may mean something else isn't it?

  

Kindly guide and oblige

  

with regards.
