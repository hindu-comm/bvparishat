Namo namah,

I think our elders Gurus n people claiming Dharmic are seriously confused.

Our Dharm never told us to keep following a path of bring tolerant n compromise just to keep the other side happy.

Shri Ram fought for his rights and Shri Krishna explained in 18 chapters about why fighting with Karavs was very well part of Dharm.

Dharm is not for making one weak...Pls watch the video of Shri Rajiv Malhotra ji as to what is our Dharma towards society in current times.

We have to fight tooth n Nail not just sit behind Dharma flag saying we are peace loving n blah blah ...

If the tradition says no entry on some genuine reasons then it should mean no entry....

  

Dhanywaad
