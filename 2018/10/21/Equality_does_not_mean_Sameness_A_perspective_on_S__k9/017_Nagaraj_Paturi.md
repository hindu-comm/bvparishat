I was at Nagpur when I posted this and the subsequent discussion was going on.

  

The issue raised by the article writer is the issue of how to understand 'equality'.

  

That 'equality' is enshrined in the constitution and the court wanted to secure that is obvious.

  

The issue raised by the author is - how to understand that 'equality'?

  

The issue is tied to the debate of uniformity vs diversity.

  

Once, a team of foreign anthropologists after finishing their fieldwork in a tribal area in Nilgiri hills , gave their used electronic gadgets to the locals , with the sincere good intentions of giving ***equal*** facilities to the tribals as ours. But the tribals were found to have thrown away all those gadgets and to be living as earlier. They did not like the 'equal' facilities.

  

We introduce our 'education' with all the enlightenment we got about atomic structure, algebra etc. to tribals with the view that they must reach a level of '***equality'*** in 'education' to us. We make it compulsory to them. Our intentions are well meaning, good. But there is debate about whether this is *bringing* ***equality*** or *imposing **uniformity.***

I accept that cultural relativism can not go to the extent of condoning cultures that harm humanity at large.

  

But a balance between cultural relativism which is a sublime democratic goal and the security of humanity is to be kept as an ideal. As long as cultural relativism is harmless, it is to be secured.
