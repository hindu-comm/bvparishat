Vishalji  
  
//While we Hindus try to be goody goody, law abiding, our Dharma will be dismantled brick by brick by those who twist Dharma to their convenience.//  
  
Rest assured, it wont be an easy task.  
  
  
//In Kerala, things have come to a pass where the bare majority of Hindus (55%) are now in danger of being crushed totally because of their unthinking support to Communists (preceded by a blind adherence to casteism).//  
  
In a democracy, people get the government they deserve. (But how is all this relevant to the current discussion?)  
  
  
//I am not being alarmist or a Hindu fanatic, I am stating the facts. Within our own lifetimes, Hindus have been cleansed out of Kashmir and reduced considerably in Bangladesh.//  
  
I agree to the above, but I dont see the relevance to the present topic.  
  
//Because, we always try to be dharmic, goody goody and do not give tit for tat.//  
  
Being dharmic does not mean you dont give tit for tat. I am not sure why people consider following dharma as a sign of weakness. Was Rama weak? Was Yudhishthira weak? Did they not give tit for tat to their enemies?  
  
  
//Comparing Sri Rama to the Hindu hating murderous chief minister of Kerala reflects your lack of viveka.//  
  
  
I did not compare them. I said, had Rama been the CM of Kerala, what would he have done?  
  
  
//That same chief minister, and many others of other states in India have refused to implement court rulings (e.g. shia - sunni conflict over a graveyard) giving the excuse that it will incite violence.//  
  
Again, I fail to see the relevance of this! Please enlighten me.
