Namaste Kalyan ji,

  

The main point is that Rama should have been awake before judgement too and acted as per Dharma.

  

Here is what "Rama" like Govt should (or might) have done.

  

1. \[Before the judgement\] The CM of Kerala is the CM of Kerala and its people. Not CPM alone. On what basis did he file an affidavit to SC saying that Kerala Govt supports women's entry? CPM has every right to say that (probably as a part of the CPM plan to civilize and educate the irrational believers of Kerala and give a life to the dying the party.). The affidavit filing should have been after a set of public consultative exercises.

  

2. \[Before the judgement\]He should have created a commission of authorities comprising the following:

-   The Tantri (who holds the position of the father of the deity as per
    the Kerala worship system) -   Temple worship as per Kerala style  
-   Tantra Shastra and Mantra Shastra -   Previous chief Priests -   Key religious heads of institutions -   Women devotees of Ayyappa -   Other lay devotees and affected parties (there is a supreme court
    decision not to include non-affected parties) -   Other relevant ppl.

This commission should have held public hearings with devotees and held Shastra Charchas leading to a consensual decision. Debates are the way from the time of Adi Shankara.

  

3. \[Before the judgement\]CPM is a non-believing party. What is their business in ruling the temples of Kerala? Will they allow some of the normal devotees to run AKG Centre or CPM Politburo? They should simply have created an autonomous body to run the temples with devotees, instead of puppets like those of TDB, now and ask them to represent the temple's case properly. They should have had the uprightness to say that we are non-believers and have no business running a temple nor trying to destroy it.

  

4. \[Before the judgement\] Govt should have held a scientifically managed referendum (even an unofficial one) of women devotees who constitute 10% at Sabarimala at any time as well other women devotees to know if women devotees feel if this is a discrimination and seeking their opinion.

  

5. \[After the judgement\] Govt should have allowed TDB (Travancore Devaswam Board) to file a petition, thus giving an impression that TDB was with devotees, which they were going to, just after the judgement.
Instead CM called TDB Chairman to his office and fired him and instructed him to enforce the decision.  

  

6. \[After the judgement\]The Govt and all its ministers and DGP and other party members and official functionaries were gloating on their success at the SC and were all out implement the decision at any cost.
Statements by ministers and DGP and others so contemptuous of tradition and they went head with plans to even have women police on the 18 steps. This arrogance and contempt is what energized the devotees and brought all their plans to naught. They should have simply requested the SC that we need time to build a consensus to implement law and go about it in a humble and proper manner.

  

Now it is quite clear that the game has gone out of the Govt's hands. Without bloodshed at the holy precincts it will be practically impossible to take unwelcome women to the holy 18 steps. But even that will be totally useless. Because, the temple's supreme authority, Tantri, has declared unambiguously that he will close the temple and lock it down before such an event takes place. There will be no open sanctum sanctorum for the women who might climbed the 18 steps against tradition to see!!

  

My humble 2c worth thoughts.

  

Krishna Kumar
