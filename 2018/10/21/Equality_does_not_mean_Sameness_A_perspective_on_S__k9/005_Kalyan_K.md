Vishalji  
  
  
//In Ramrajya, the law applied to everyone, but did not have the same laws for everyone.//  
  
I think you meant, same laws were there for everyone.  
  
  
//In India, there is one law for Hindus, another for Muslims and Christians.//  
  
Are you talking of personal laws or laws in general? The latter are the same. For the former, the SC asserted the need for a UCC.  
  
  
//The petition to open the gates of the shrine was filed by a Muslim advocate,//  
  
I dont understand the relevance of this. I am sure most, if not all the judges were Hindus. So what is your point here?  
  
  
//and till yesterday, 3 of the four women activists who attempted to breach the shrine's traditions were Christians or Muslim and the fourth was a Communist.//  
  
  
There was a woman from Andhra who was neither an activist nor a communist.  
  
  
//They could not find ONE Hindu lady who was willing to kow-tow to Hinduphobic Kerala Communist party.//  
  
Please see above. So implementing SC verdict is seen by you as kowtowing to the Communist party?  
  
  
//The SAME court in Kerala refused to admit a petition by a Hindu group that wanted Sunni mosques in Kerala to be opened to Muslim women. //  
  
  
The verdict on Sabarimala was passed by the Apex Court, not a Kerala court. The Kerala High Court in fact, had ruled in favor of existing practices in Sabarimala.  
  
//The SAME courts want to rule even on matters like the height of Dahi Haandi//  
  
For safety purposes this is needed. Not sure again what your point is.  
  
  
//but other than the Halala-Talaaq verdict which was defeated by the 'secular' parties in the Rajya Sabha.//  
  
GOI passed an ordinance on the issue of triple talaq. The Supreme court correctly ruled against the triple talaq practice.  
  
  
//And as usual, the name change of Allabahad to Prayag was followed by the usual 'articles' in Scroll and Wire (the two Communist newspapers in recent time) about why this was ahistorical.//  
  
  
I dont understand the relevance of this here.
