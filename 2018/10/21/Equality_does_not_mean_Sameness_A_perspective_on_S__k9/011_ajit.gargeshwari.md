Can courts ask society to change or the society decides how courts should work. Courts work as per constitution of India they are not bounded by dharmic laws neither are they the interpreters of Shastras and dharma. If courts are not interpreters of Shastras or dharmic laws then why take dharmic and religious matters to court? I am curious. are religious matter taken to court world over or is this trend specific to India. If a matter is taken to court then a judgement has to be delivered and the judgment delivered will be as per the constitution of India if constitutional issues are involved and law of India if the matter pertains to laws. Even now legal options are open one can appeal against the delivered judgement or change the laws . If the laws are changed then the court decides if it is per Indian constitution. Leaving the legal issue. my question is can social issues be resolved by courts unless the society is ready to change. Are the law makers of India doing enough to make laws which hold constitutional validity keeping in mind emotions and sentiments of society at large.
