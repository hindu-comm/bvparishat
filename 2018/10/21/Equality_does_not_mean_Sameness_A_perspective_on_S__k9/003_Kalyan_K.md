Sri Ramana Murthyji and Sri Paturiji  
  
Reading the Ramayana and obviously being influenced by Rama, I am wondering what would Rama have done if he were the Chief Minister of Kerala. Would he have abided by the Apex court verdict and the constitution, which is the modern day dharma? Or would he have taken into account the wishes of the devotees as a just king? My guess (purely a guess) is that if Rama had sworn to abide by the constitutional dharma, he being the embodiment of dharma, would have taken the former option, just as he decided to go to the forest, even though people were overwhelmingly in favor of his coronation.
