Respected scholars it's very fine to say that the judiciary of India is under 60 or 70 families. 1.As I know we got independence in 1947 only just 70 years ago. 2. It's absolutely true that no law is above the Constitution of India. 3. Supreme court prefers the dharmic texts but not in the case of fundamental rights. The apex courts has quoted the scriptures in case of some TTD cases . It respected the dharmic laws or agama sastra and stopped the govt in making some changes. 4. Sabarimala is an issue of rights for the apex court not feels it as a dharmic law. 5. It's absolutely true that the society has change resistance. Lets take an example of some previous laws i.e. The laws which abolished 1.Sati 2. Child marriage and the Widow re marriage ,etc. All these are nearly against the dharmic scriptures and several protests failed to stop them. Divorce is a new issue which is unrelated to the past society. The protests from local community exists. It's natural in an ongoing process. Let's see what happens!
