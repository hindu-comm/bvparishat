It's depressing to read an endless stream of self-flagellating/pointless/undirected posts so often. It's worse on Twitter - the popular "Intellectual Kshatriyas" berating Hindu society as being "morons" who can't "fight back" against "post-modernist intellectuals", while they happily collect more RTs and Likes with their thousands of followers (\*slow clap\*).  
  
It's like being trapped with the Zealots on Masada (ironically, a wonderful time to be a Jew; not so much a Hindu) ! I'll try to summarize various 'arguments' given so far, and then try to distill a way forward.  
  
- 'There are many temples that restrict Men in India.' or 'There are temples restricting Women in Japan and Italy.'  
The law \*does not care\* whether there are a few temples where Men are not allowed, nor whom it was filed by. File a PIL and they'll happily have those removed too. The court cares even less that Japan/Italy has temples/monastries that restrict women.  
  
- 'It was filed by a Muslim, and now some non-Hindus are maniacally trying to enforce the judgement!'  
This is true, but it was Trupti Desai in the Maharashtra case. This argument is to be posed by someone who is willing to see Sabarimala tradition destroyed if a few hundred/thousand Hindu women turn up in Nilakkal. The pre-conditions for this \*will\* happen if not today then in a decade's time.  
  
- 'SCs judgement is welcome but people's sentiments should be respected' - (RSS/BJP [et.al](http://et.al)).  
These are the current ruling parties, with ostensible 'pro-Hindu' tendencies. Their statements, reticence and ample precedence should make us readily infer that they \*welcome\* the judgement. Are they non-Hindu ? No ! Does delaying the decision help in the end ? I'd be surprised if it did.  
  
- 'SC's judgement is mistaken.' or 'Restriction vs Discrimination' and 'Hinduism is most progressive towards Women'  
Yes, the judges hear you! The judgement in its rambling form itself mentions, "Hindu religion as this religion does not discriminate against women but, on the contrary, Hindu religion accords to women a higher pedestal in comparison to men and such a discrimination is totally anti-Hindu, for restriction on the entry of women is not the essence of Hindu religion."  
  
OK.  
  
Now I'll tell you what's actually going on. See, in their "greatness" and "progressive-ness", the drafters of the constitution (incl. your Patel, Nehru & Ambedkar) held that British laws of "social reforms" should not only be preserved, but their agenda must be expanded (this is not a conspiracy; this is well-documented). Thus the "Fundamental Right of Religion" are deeply compromised when it comes to Hindus (defn. coherently as everything not originating outside). It was believed that not having a noose around our necks would "strike at the very root of the State", and that only the minimum amount of "worship" is guaranteed (to Hindus). This is the backstory. The prequel to this is about Missionary-Moral rhetoric about Sati (see, Meenakshi Jain's Sati), Devadasi and "caste system" (see, Western foundations of Caste System), and other imagined "evils", which is interesting in and of itself.  
  
The sequel is about consequences.  
  
I advise you to please read Art-25 of the constitution, <https://indiankanoon.org/doc/631708/>, and listen to the talk by Jakob de Roover on his book (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaK5prUZp4o>).  
  
25. Freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion  
(1) Subject to public order, morality and health and to the other provisions of this Part, all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practise and propagate religion  
(2) Nothing in this article shall affect the operation of any existing law or prevent the State from making any law  
(a) regulating or restricting any economic, financial, political or other secular activity which may be associated with religious practice;  
(b) providing for social welfare and reform or the throwing open of Hindu religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of Hindus  
  
Art 25-b, as you can guess was meant to support the Dalit Temple entry movement. Art 25-a was meant to "administer" Hindu institutions. These however conflict with Art 26 which allows an organization to "to manage its own affairs in matters of religion" (amognst others) which provides some limits to state-interference, but these can be bypassed.  
  
Here is the two-pronged judicial recipe to destroying \*any\* Indian tradition (if any of you care to be Asuri-c judges),  
- If it concerns people, invoke Art 25(b), to "throw open" the institution.  
- If it doesn't concern people, use Art 25(a) to interfere in "secular" affairs of the institution. To bypass Art-26, use Gajendragad's (interestingly from a family of Sanskrit scholars) "essential religious practices" test, and tweak the criterion to make the tradition fall under the "secular practices".  
- If it concerns people of a different faith use strategem (2).  
  
That's it! Congratulations, you've helped preserve a "pristine" religion by removing "superstitious accretions"! You can throw in a few references to Art 14/21 and the "cosmos of freedom" to satisfy those hipster urges while you're at it.  
  
Humor aside, if you look at the court case judgements (incl. Sabarimala), this is precisely what has been happening for 70-ish years, \*after\* our "independence". Admittedly, the judges aren't always adversarial, and sometimes Hindus are all too enthused when Art 25(a) is used to beat down some obscure Muslim tradition. The Indian constitution, as it pertains to Hinduism, is a charter for its reform. Have you agreed to this ? Have I ? The constitution was drafted by colonial elites elected by a little over 10% of the population in the British colony. Is this "democratic" ? Is this "dharma" (whatever that might be) ?  
  
Do you know why these people were pretending to be Ayyappa devotees ? It's because the rights provided by SC apply only to the particular "religion"; however if indications serve right, this is likely to be removed soon (\< 10y). The court judgement in the Puri case gives clear indications for this possibility (though it remains a 'suggestion'). These will continue to happen because the judges are given absolute powers over what is "essentially religious" and what is "securlar" - they have powers exceeding those of any priest, maulvi or a dharmasastri (ironically a paraphrase of Fali Nariman). They are the theologians deciding what Hinduism is and what it isn't (since we are not the religion of the book), slicing and dicing it as they merry well please.  
  
What is driving all this ? As India becomes ever closer to its chosen goal of being a cultural imitation of Anglo-Saxons, its "morals" will increasingly resemble those of those lands. If you'd have read the NyT/WaPo articles on Hinduism over the years, this verdict was easily predictable. Or indeed, the English media in Delhi. This'll continue, until (a) Art 25 is destroyed (b) we're destroyed (c) through some "magic" the cultural genocide can be stemmed inspite of an apathetic/adversarial state.  
  
I'd call these the "articles of Hindu doom", and be extremely wary of these. Note also that BJP/RSS \*will not\* touch these - the state is bankrupt, and will not let go of the easy money from the Temple loot. Idealogically, 'Hindutva' is also weakly aligned towards this "reform Hinduism" project (as seen in the Sabarimala case). State-sanctioned reform is extremely dangerous; I think as a society not accustomed to "religions of books" we imagine judges to be people we can "negotiate" with. This is akin to walking around with a loaded revolver. Fatal mistake.  
  
If you're in a position of power, please lobby BJP/RSS workers to change their stance. Otherwise it'll also be 2000 years of banishment for us.  
  
(I'm not a jurist, so please take the details with a pinch of salt. The views here are based on a reading of the Master's thesis of Anil Rao, University of Ghent)
