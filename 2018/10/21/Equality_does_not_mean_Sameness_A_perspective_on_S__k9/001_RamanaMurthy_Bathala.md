Dear Sir,

  

Court see the meaning of "equality" in the "constitution", but not in the "scriptures".

  

Courts are secular, not spiritual.

  

Whether one is spiritual or secular, he/she has to follow the law of the land. There is no option.

  

"We the People of India...." took the resolution to follow the constitution.

  

Decision by the courts may not be correct in the context of religion, but we need to follow because we are bound by the constitution.

  

Regards

Ramana murthy
