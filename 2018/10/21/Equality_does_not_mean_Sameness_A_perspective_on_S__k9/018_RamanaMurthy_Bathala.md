Dear Sir,

  

You made good point:  
"But a balance between cultural ....."

  

But important point is who is going to define and decide the "balance"? Is it people/society or government or constitutional institution like judiciary?

  

People: Can people in India decide what is right or wrong (read "balance")? India is not matured like other countries like US. Time and again it is proved. Take for instance, the people are electing the criminals. They are sending criminals contesting from jails, to the assembly and parliament. Majority of the people are voting based on religion, caste, language, regionalism etc. Can such people decide what is balance?

  

Government: We have seen, most of the times, government does not act if it is against its vote bank politics.

  

Judiciary: As a last resort, We can hope this is one which can take balance between cultural relativism and the security of humanity.

  

Here is the one more example.  

  

Every year we are polluting the God given this earth with smoke of crackers during Diwali. How much Asthma patients are suffering due to this, people do not understand. They want the tradition and religion.

  

Government did not do enough fearing that it will impact its vote bank.

  

Finally, it is the court, in the larger interest of the health of the society, took the decision today.

Who is taking the balanced decision here?

  

Regards  
Ramana muthy
