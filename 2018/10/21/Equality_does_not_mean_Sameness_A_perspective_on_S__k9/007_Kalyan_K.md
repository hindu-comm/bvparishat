Vishalji  
  
  
//There are a few temples in India which do not allow men. I abide by the tradition. And likewise, I abide by the tradition that Parsi shrines do not allow non Parsis in. //  
  
Ok, if you respect traditions, that is fine.  
  
  
//Each place has its rules, and if we do not like them, we should go to some other place or create a parallel.//  
  
  
Not everyone would share the above opinion. Some people would think that if rules are unconstitutional or harmful, they need to be changed. I am neither here nor there on the issue of Sabarimala. The question I am interested in is, given the SC verdict, should it be implemented or not.
