Kalyan-ji,

  

In Ramrajya, the law applied to everyone, but did not have the same laws for everyone. In India, there is one law for Hindus, another for Muslims and Christians. The petition to open the gates of the shrine was filed by a Muslim advocate, and till yesterday, 3 of the four women activists who attempted to breach the shrine's traditions were Christians or Muslim and the fourth was a Communist. They could not find ONE Hindu lady who was willing to kow-tow to Hinduphobic Kerala Communist party. The SAME court in Kerala refused to admit a petition by a Hindu group that wanted Sunni mosques in Kerala to be opened to Muslim women. The SAME courts want to rule even on matters like the height of Dahi Haandi but other than the Halala-Talaaq verdict which was defeated by the 'secular' parties in the Rajya Sabha. And as usual, the name change of Allabahad to Prayag was followed by the usual 'articles' in Scroll and Wire (the two Communist newspapers in recent time) about why this was ahistorical.

  

While we Hindus try to be goody goody, law abiding, our Dharma will be dismantled brick by brick by those who twist Dharma to their convenience. In Kerala, things have come to a pass where the bare majority of Hindus (55%) are now in danger of being crushed totally because of their unthinking support to Communists (preceded by a blind adherence to casteism). I am not being alarmist or a Hindu fanatic, I am stating the facts. Within our own lifetimes, Hindus have been cleansed out of Kashmir and reduced considerably in Bangladesh. Because, we always try to be dharmic, goody goody and do not give tit for tat. Comparing Sri Rama to the Hindu hating murderous chief minister of Kerala reflects your lack of viveka. That same chief minister, and many others of other states in India have refused to implement court rulings (e.g. shia - sunni conflict over a graveyard) giving the excuse that it will incite violence.

  

There are a few temples in India which do not allow men. I abide by the tradition. And likewise, I abide by the tradition that Parsi shrines do not allow non Parsis in. Or Mecca and Medina do not allow Kafirs to enter these cities (well, I wouldn't want to be killed on the spot if caught). In fact, I recall as a kid visiting a mosque in Srinagar in 1978 where my Aunt was not allowed to enter in because she did not conform to their dress code (and she was wearing a gown going to her ankles)! We did not create a ruckus over that. Each place has its rules, and if we do not like them, we should go to some other place or create a parallel. Just like this list helps us avoid the rampant white supremacism in the Indology list where different rules are followed for westerners (and their non-white stooges) versus those for self confident and assertive Indians.

Sri Ramana Murthyji and Sri Paturiji  
  
Reading the Ramayana and obviously being influenced by Rama, I am wondering what would Rama have done if he were the Chief Minister of Kerala. Would he have abided by the Apex court verdict and the constitution, which is the modern day dharma? Or would he have taken into account the wishes of the devotees as a just king? My guess (purely a guess) is that if Rama had sworn to abide by the constitutional dharma, he being the embodiment of dharma, would have taken the former option, just as he decided to go to the forest, even though people were overwhelmingly in favor of his coronation.
