<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhu-Kaitabha>  

**Madhu**([Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit_language "Sanskrit language"):मधु) and**Kaitabha**([Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit_language "Sanskrit language"):कैटभ),[Rakshasas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakshasas "Rakshasas")or demons of[Hindu mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_mythology "Hindu mythology"), are associated with Hindu[religious cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_cosmology "Religious cosmology"). They both originated from one of the ears of God[Vishnu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnu "Vishnu"), while he was in the deep sleep of[Yoganidra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoganidra "Yoganidra"). From his navel, a lotus sprouted on which[Brahma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahma "Brahma"), the creator, was found sitting and contemplating the creation of the[cosmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos "Cosmos").

[Bhagavata Purana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavata_Purana "Bhagavata Purana")states that during the creation, the demons Madhu and Kaitabha stole the[Vedas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas "Vedas")from[Brahma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahma "Brahma")and deposited them deep inside the waters of the primeval ocean. Vishnu, in his manifestation as[Hayagriva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayagriva "Hayagriva"), killed them, and retrieved the Vedas. The bodies of Madhu and Kaitabha disintegrated into 2 times 6 — which is twelve pieces (two heads, two torsos, four arms and four legs). These are considered to represent the twelve seismic plates of the Earth.

According to another legend, Madhu and Kaitabha are considered demons, designed to annihilate Brahma. However, Brahma spotted them, and invoked the goddess[Mahamaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durga "Durga"). At this point, Vishnu awoke, and the two conspiring demons were killed. This led to Vishnu being called[Madhusudanah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhusudanah "Madhusudanah")- the killer of Madhu and mahamaya came to be known as kaitabhi,.
