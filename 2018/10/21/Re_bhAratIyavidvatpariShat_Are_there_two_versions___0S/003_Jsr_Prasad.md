Very good analysis about 'take home message', Dr. Yadu ji. This is how one should interpret and analyse puranas. Most of such concepts should not be taken in a literal but in a metaphorical sense.

  

However, Srirama abandoning Sita maa happened due to hear-say, but the intention of doing so, had a purpose. Believing and acting based on hear-say is purposeful or 'just like that' may make the issue distinct.
