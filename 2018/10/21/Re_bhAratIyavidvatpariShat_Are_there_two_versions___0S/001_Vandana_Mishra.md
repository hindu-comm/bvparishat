Namo Namah,

  

As we all are aware of our Bhartiya education system flaws regarding many subjects like history, science, maths, arts and many is there any reliable source from which we can elighten our minds (as well as our next generation). Many things on Google and wikipedia are fake and they are controlled by others............whom to rely on? My Brother, his wife who are in their early 30s are highly colononized. My teenager son accepts few things but always asks for proof regarding science and mathematics. For eg. he doesnt beleive that Rishi Boudhain ever did any thing fruitfull!!!

Please guide.

Dhayawaad.
