Namo Namah,

I don't agree that Shri Ram sent Sita ji to Van just based on some hear say thing. There are many inference s to be drawn. But the inferences drawn may also differ on, the one drawing inference. A person with positive progressive mindset will look into it as a matter of a huge sacrifice of King's and Queen's own personal happiness for the sake of their subjects.

A person with negative and low IQ may think that Shri Ram was a senseless man, who even didn't believe his wife just on mear tumor based

Washerman's story.

Dhanywaad.
