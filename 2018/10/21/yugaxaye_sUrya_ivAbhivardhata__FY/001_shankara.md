Misraji,

  

The state of pralaya is described in Agni Purana chapter 368. Its Devanagari text is available online at [https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/अग्निपुराणम्/अध्यायः\_३६८](https://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/अग्निपुराणम्/अध्यायः_३६८)

  

Similar descriptions of Pralaya must be there in almost all Mahapuranas and Upapuranas.  

  

regards  
shankara
