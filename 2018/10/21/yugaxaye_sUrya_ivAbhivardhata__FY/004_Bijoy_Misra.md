Dear Prof JSR,

Possibly It does not matter. The key word is क्षय.

There is some correlation withयुगक्षय to the expansion of the sun's size.

The question is if we have any astrological reasoning of connecting natural

disasters to sun's parallax. There has been scientific research in the former

USSR and in the US on the radiation influence of the sun, but the size story

is different.

Do you have any strong astrology resources? Can you check? They declare

it as direct understandable phrases.

Regards,

BM
