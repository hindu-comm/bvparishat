Dear friends,

  

I had written about this phrase earlier.

I encountered again now in Ch 47, St 9 in

Sundarakanda. It seems to be a popular

simile for Valmiki used in the context of battle.

The question is if you have seen such reference

in other compositions elsewhere or come across

any analytic interpretation in some literary context.

  

As some of you might know, this phrase connotes

the present day scientific deduction how our star

will end its life in due course.

  

Best regards,

BM
