Dear Shankarji,

  

This is interesting. The closest I found is

  

ततस्तस्यानुभावेन तोयाहारोपबृंहिताः ।  
त एव रश्मयः सप्त जायन्ते सप्त भास्कराः ।। ३६८.६ ।।  

  

Possibly there is a correlation of natural disaster to sun's parallax.

I don't recall to have sen such description in Srimadbhagavatam.

Possibly more explicit reference would be found. Let us look.

  

Thank you.

BM
