Thanks, Nagaraju gaaru. For the current purposes, I agree that we need to treat*peṭṭi* and *poṭṭa(ṇa)*as derived from two different roots, although in myopinion, both of them belong to the set of words derived from a single pre-Aryan, pre-Dravidian root.

  

Burrow thought words such as \*[*pōṭṭa*](https://dsalsrv04.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/soas_query.py?qs=pu%E1%B9%ADa&searchhws=yes) 'cavity, basket, container' are derived from a Dravidian root with the meaning of 'hollow' (Burrow 1945). Kuiper thought many words related to*[mūṭa](https://dsalsrv04.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/soas_query.py?qs=m%C5%ABta&searchhws=yes)*'bundle'*,muṭṭa, puṭa, poṭṭa, poṭṭala*are derived from a Proto-Munda root (Kuiper 'Proto Munda Words In Sanskrit' 1948).

  

My opinion is that the words such as*puṭa* 'cavity'; *pēṭṭa*, *poṭṭa* 'belly';*pēṭa*, *peṭṭa*, *potta* 'basket';*piṭaka*,*pēṭa*,*peṭṭa*,*potta***'box' are derived from a singleniṣāda root \**pe**ṭ* 'hallow,' 'hallow container'. As some of the Dravidian languages show therounding of front vowelsbetween bilabial and retroflex (e.g., peṭṭi \> poṭṭi ‘box’; peṇ- \> poṇṇu ‘woman’), I find similar rounding of vowels after labials in various Prakrits as well. Furthermore, since we find the alteration of /m/, /p/, /b/ and /v/ among the common archaic words across various Indian languages (bala, vala, malla 'strong, strength' etc.), I believe*mūṭa* 'bundle' should also be clubbed with sameniṣādic root. Obviously, further research is warranted.

  

For the current purposes, I propose that kannada*poṭṭa(ṇa) and Telugu poṭlam*are related tomarathi *poṭaḷa* (पोटळा/*पोटळी*Medicaments tied up in a corner of a cloth), and Hindi*poṭ* 'bundle, package'*;poṭḷ**a* 'large bundle' etc.*,* with a possible connection to*peṭṭa/**peṭṭi*'box'.

  

Regards,

Suresh.
