Tamil has the derived form poTTalam Sanskrit poTala in the sense of a package, never a 'box' as in match box. I see twin processes working here. The Marathi retroflex 'poTaLa' could be reason for the final retroflex Na. We need also to account for the change in meaning. How did poTTaNa get the meaning of a box? I don't think matches ever came in bundles. We should find out historical evidence from Kannada for the changes.
