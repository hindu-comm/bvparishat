You might remember that I seconded your proposal for tracing non-Indo-European non-Dravidian origins of Indian language words.

  

From the evidence of puṭ \> puṭṭi= basket-boat /puṭṭa/buṭṭa =basket, we can see that the root has got to do with the half-spherical concave shape. poṭṭa = belly, pot-belly, pregnant bellyseems to have got its origin in the half-spherical convex shape thus connected to the same root puṭ . boṭṭu could also be connected to the root.

  

It has to be considered whether poṭlam /poṭnam of Telugu and poṭna /poṭṭaṇa of Kannada also have got to do withis root becausepoṭlam /poṭnam ,poṭna /poṭṭaṇahas got to do with shaping the material such as paper into a half-spherical concave shape. But since the word has no ancient usage and since paper is a later arrival, origin outside this root need not be ruled out.
