Dear Sir,

  

Initially I thought it was typo when I come across the word paTTaNa (పట్టణ/ಪಟ್ಟಣ) translated as box.

  

1\) I found the same word paTTaNa (పట్టణ/ಪಟ್ಟಣ) carrying same meaning box at another place in the same book.

2\) But more confusion followed. In the same book, paTTaNa (పట్టణ/ಪಟ್ಟಣ) carrying the meaning city / town is given at another place.

Whether it is typo or consciously written by the author, is not known. Moreover the book is published by credential sources like Government of Karnataka.

  

I referred three dictionaries. Not a single dictionaryhas given the meaningof 'box' to the word paTTaNa (పట్టణ/ಪಟ್ಟಣ).

All three are referring to 'town/city'.

  

a\) Kannada-English etymological dictionary by Norihiko Učida & Bando Bhimaji Rajapurohit
