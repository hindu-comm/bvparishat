Dear scholars,

  

The words 'beMki poTTaNa', 'beMki peTTige' and 'kaDDi peTTige' are the Kannada equivalents for English 'match box'. 'paTTaNa' in 'beMki paTTaNa' is more of a case of mispronunciation.  

  

Also, as rightly mentioned earlier by Shri. V Subrahmanian, 'paTTaNa' isthe Kannadaequivalent for English 'town'.

  

with regards,

Shrivatsa
