The change of short /o/ \> /a/ is sporadically found in Kannada, particularly in Bellary Kannada (cf. Sound Change By D. N. Shankara Bhat ch 3). This change is very similar to how the old Sanskrit (primitive Indo-Aryan) lost the original IE short /ĕ/ and short /ŏ/ which merged with short /a/ (ऎ,ऒ>अ).

  

**\[DEDR 4388\]**

**peṭṭi**'box' (Tamil peṭṭi box, chest, basket; peṭṭakam chest, box; Telugu:peṭṭebox, safe; Tulu:peṭṭigèbox)

    >**poṭṭi**(change of /e/ and /i/ to /o/ after the labials)

    >**paṭṭi **(change of short /o/ \> /a/)  
  
ಬೆಂಕಿ**+**ಪೆಟ್ಟಿ>ಬೆಂಕಿಪೊಟ್ಟಣ \> ಬೆಂಕಿಪಟ್ಟಣ.

  

In Telugu matchbox is called **aggipeṭṭe(**అగ్గిపెట్టె).
