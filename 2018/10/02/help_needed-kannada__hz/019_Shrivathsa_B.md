poTTaNa is any small enclosure to hold stuff.

Before polythene became common we used to get sundries in poTTaNas. The process used to be called poTTaNa kaTTuvudu (making poTTaNa) - a conical enclosure made using newspaper which was closed at the top after filling and thin jute or cotton thread run over the conical shape to prevent it from unravelling.

  

poTTaNa of a different variation is used even today commonly by those who pack paan (biiDa)... Enclosing the paan in a paper.

  

To my mind the word's dhaatu may be close to that of puTiikaraNam. (puTa saMshleShaNe?)

  

The word for a page is called a puTa in kannaDa which may indicate that any page like thing was used for puTiikaraNa (enclosing).

  

Volumes of books which "enclose" information are called saMpuTas in kannaDa.

  

poTTaNa may be a corruption of poTanam.
