Dear All:

  

Many thanks to Shri R.S. Rana, Curator Shri Krishna Museum, Kurukshetra who has allowed us access to scan there 100 odd manuscripts.

  

Few that are digitized already are viewable below

Slightly old news , but thanks to Prof. Shankarji Jha, and Mrityunjaya Kumar, Manuscript Inchharge of Panjab University Manuscript Collection, we have an active center at Panjab University now.

  

Scans from first 2 almiras are viewable here:

The Library has total 13 almirahs. So maybe we need a year to finish them.
