Many thanks, Prasadji and Prabhuji for the useful responses. In the meantime, I am led to believe that शतः सिद्ध is a corrupt form of स्वतः सिद्ध and शताय गताय (it means in Kannada "irrespective of the consequences") is a corrupt form of स्थिताय गताय ("स्थितस्यगतिः चिन्त्या" often occurs in commentaries).I do not know if शतपथ ( means in Kannada "repeatedly tracing the same path")has any connexion with the BrahmaNa of the same name. Any other suggestions are welcome.

Regards,

Murthy
