Dear scholars,

  namaste !

 It's a great pleasure for me to announce that I have completed the English translation "Sketches of Ceylon and India" of the original title "Очерки Цейлона и Индии" published in 1878 in two parts (total v+284+238 pp) by a great Indologist Prof. Ivan Minayev (1840-1890). It is his travelogue which he wrote after visiting Ceylon and India in 1874-75. In this book he has presented a vivid picture of the social, economic and political conditions of the then Ceylon and India. He was mainly a Buddhist scholar and knew English, German, French, Pali, Sanskrit, Hindi and some of its dialects. He conversed in Pali with Buddhist monks.

  His books published in English translations have been indicated here:

  The publication of the English translation "Sketches of Ceylon and India" is planned next year (hopefully by August).

  

  I would like to know whether any scholar could find some time to have a look at this translation and give some comments / suggestions/ review before its publication.

  

Its subject index is given below.

  

Thanks and regards

Narayan Prasad
