Prabhu-ji !

  

Not that there was anything wrong in yours.

I thought, your message was inviting enough for me to try my hand at it.

But for trying, I wanted to know the complete original quote.

I also wanted to know the original quote, because I was not comfortable with the mention "If wealth is lost, noting is lost"

I wanted to check, if the original quote actually mentions so.

It came to notice, that original quote of Bill Graham has mainly 3 parts only, speaking of losing "nothing, something, all".

With the use of सतिसप्तमी I was able to set translation of the quote in 3 पाद-s.

But अनुष्टुभ् meter cannot have only 3 पाद-s. Hence thought it good to add the 4th to conform to the अनुष्टुभ् meter.

Thought also came to mind, if it can be set in another meter, keeping 4 पाद-s, maybe, with less number of syllables per पाद, without adding anything beyond what is there in the quote.

It also came to mind that शीलम् is a better word, than the word चारित्र्यम् used by you. The word शीलम् is well-emphasized in a सुभाषितम् saying ऐश्वर्यस्य विभूषणं सुजनता .....शीलं परं भूषणम्
