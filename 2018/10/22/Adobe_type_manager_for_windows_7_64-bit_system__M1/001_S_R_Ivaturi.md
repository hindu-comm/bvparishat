@Dr\. Janaki Acharya  

  

I don't think that you need ATM for Windows 10. The support is inbuilt. But sometimes Pagemaker may not work properly. You have to run it in compatibility mode. As far as I know if you have ShreeLIpi fonts installed on your computer, they will work fine. I use PM7 with Anu fonts 7 on Win 10 OS without any problem.
