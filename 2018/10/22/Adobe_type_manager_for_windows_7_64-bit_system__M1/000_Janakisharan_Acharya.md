Respected All,

  

My Pranamas !

  

I don’t think this is appropriate forum to discuss below said topic, still अगतिकोऽहं asking this.

  

I am editing a book and it is typed in Adobe Page Maker 7.0 with Shree Lipifont (type 1) (Shree Lipi 2.0 version). Now I upgraded my system from windows 7 (32 bit) to Windows 7 (64 bit), but this Adobe type manager software is not compatible with 64-bit system.

  

Can anyone help me locate Adobe Type Manager Light for a 64-bit operating system? The downloadable version on Adobe's websites and others appears to only be compatible with 32-bit systems. Or, is there another type manager program that will allow me to use Type 1 fonts on a 64-bit, Windows 7 (64-bit) system?



With due regards

  

Dr. Janakisharan Acharya
