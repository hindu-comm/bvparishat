On the auspicious day of Mahalaya Amavasya, I am happy to share my new e-book titled "Caṇḍika: The Story of Goddess Durgā & its Vedāntic Import".

  

Brief Description of the Book:  
Navaratri or the festival of nine nights is one of the most important festivals celebrated by the Hindus across the world. The festival is a celebration of the Goddess Chandika and her war against various Asuras. The story of Chandi or Durga as she is popularly known contains within itself deep insights of Vedanta philosophy and acts as a practical facilitator for attaining Moksha or the final liberation from the cycle of birth and death. This book sheds light on this Vedantic import of Goddess Chandika.

  

The book is only available as E-book in Amazon Kindle and can be purchased from-<https://www.amazon.in/dp/B07JVBQV67>
