Respected Vidvaj-janas,  
  
Are upavedas like Ayurveda, Dhanurveda, etc. and Vedangas like Siksa,  
chhanda, vyakarana, etc. included in Sruti?  
  
If yes, then do they also share the characteristic of their words  
being always unchanged, unlike puranas and smritis?  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
