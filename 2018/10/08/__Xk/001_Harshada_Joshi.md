Respected members of the group,

  

I have a doubt regarding description of vedic accents.

  

Panini has defined udatta as उच्चैः उदात्तः।, anudatta as नीचैः अनुदात्तः। and svarita as समाहारः स्वरितः।

We find that the english translation of this is done as follows -

accent with a high pitch is udatta, with a lower one is anudatta and the mixture of both is svarita.

  

In the introductory part of one of the translations of Rigvedic suktas, I came across this explanation -

In the Rigveda, the udatta represents the middle pitch, the svarita the highest and the anudatta the lowest.

  

My question is, which meaning is to be referred to? Or was there any difference in pronunciation of these accents according to different branches of Veda-s?

Please guide.

Thanks.
