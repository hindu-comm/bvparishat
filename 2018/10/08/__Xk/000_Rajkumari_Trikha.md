Dear all, namaste,

A T.V.show (Aadhi haqiqat Aadhar fasana ) on News 18 India has telecasted that in Puri, 50 Kms away from Konark sun temple there is a village called Kakat Put.

  

There are some600 years old Tamrapatras , which are blank, but when anyone comes to that pandit to ask any question, the letters in uriya language , appear on Tamra Patra, containing visitor's question and it's answer.

  

I want to confirm its genuineness from our group's members, specially uriya scholars, near about Puri or Bhubaneswar.

Thanks for bearing with my lengthy pos
