Dear Sir,

  

First: Kindly include a subject line so that members can respond.

  

What you ask of is possible. In Tamilnadu there are a few people who do what they call Jiva nadi readings. I assume this literally translates to "live nadi" implying that the palm leaves /tamra patra have nothing prewritten but the writings appropriate to the person appear when the person in question visits.

  

Such things are possible with Yaksha/Yakshini siddhi and the siddhi of other kshudra devatas. Whether the nadi reading really comes from Agastya or Brighu Maharshis as claimed?---Your guess is as good as mine.

  

Try an experiment- If the past is completely true and the near future wrong it is some form of low spirit.

If the future is roughly correct it may be from a kshudra devata.

If you have some form of regular worship like sandhyopasana or panchayatana worship, and you follow rigorous niyama this worship creates a kavacha around you that cannot be pierced by kshudra devatas.

99% of the time everything predicted for you will fail since your future is continuously being reformed by your penance.

  

If the prediction is still correct, it might just be a Rshi's nadi.

  

My 2 cents.
