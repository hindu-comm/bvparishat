It was a wonderful experience listening to this audio of the rendition of the above episode. I can't thank enough Dr.Kannan and Srimati for this treat. MM Sri Swaminathan Sharma had once said: those who come to study Vedanta have to first read the Kavya-s, for one can find the great Kavi-s to be Vedantins. Dr.Kannan too expressed the view that Kavi has the Adhyatma understanding and hence alone can bring out the excellent sentiments of human nature.

  

I would like to have the reference and the full form of the verse where Valmiki addresses Sita 'I know your father-in-law, Dasharatha and your father Janaka who could even confer moksha on the right candidate.' If this shloka, along with the Mallinatha or any other commentary is provided, that would be a great help.

  

Thanks and regards
