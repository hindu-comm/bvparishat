Respected scholars,  
  
I want to know if there is any research work available on a Sanskrit  
novel,awarded by Sahitya Akademy, named sindhukanya, authored by  
Shrikant shripad Hasurkar.  
I want to suggest this piece of work for literary or linguistic study  
for my research scholar under my supervision and want to avoid  
repetition of research on same topic.  
  
Any information in this regard will be highly appreciated.  
  
Looking forward,
