Thanks for the link. Another classic from Hindi Grantha Ratnakara Karyalaya, which survives after a century of publishing books as Hindi Grantha Karyalaya. The home of the current fourth-generation proprietor, Sh. Manish Modi, next to the Thakurdwar post office in Mumbai still has a nameplate with the name of Pt. Nathuram Premi, a visionary much ahead of his time, and the old name Hindi Grantha Ratnakara Karyalaya written below it.
