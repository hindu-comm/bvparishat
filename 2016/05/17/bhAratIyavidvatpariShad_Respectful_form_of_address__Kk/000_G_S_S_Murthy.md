Dear Scholars,

In Sanskrit classics and Puranas even sages and divine persons are addressed in singular. Sometimes भवान्/अत्रभवान् is used. In Hindi and other cognatelanguages, plural form of addressing is perhaps the norm. It looks to me that this practice of addressing in plural is coming into voguein Sanskrit too.I am not sure if it is a welcome development. Scholars could opine.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
