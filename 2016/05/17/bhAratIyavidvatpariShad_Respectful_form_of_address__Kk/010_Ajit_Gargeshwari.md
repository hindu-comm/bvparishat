This has nothing got to do with Tamil or Hindi Indians don't adress their elders or gurus by name. Hence third person is used to adress elders in works. Many saints adress themselves in plural. They ham ne kaha instead of mai ne kaha. The same logic applies in Sanskrit as well. Even in Kannada one gurugala matu etc.
