The respectful third-person style of talking has seeped into the Tamil style. I am not aware of other south-Indian states.  
  

When I joined as an Assistant Superintendent of Police in Tamil Nadu way back in 1984, and was sitting in a police station, the Inspector asked, "Would the ASP like to take tea or coffee?" Having been born and brought up in Punjab, I could not make out that the ASP being talked about was none other than myself. So, I asked him "Which ASP?" The confusion continued for sometime before I could understand that he was asking about me.  
  

Several years later, I felt nothing odd when, as a DIG, I would ask my DGP, "Would the DGP like to take tea or coffee?" I had become a Tamilian by then!  
  

Confusion arose when a foreigner visited my department and one of the officers asked him something like, "Would the dignitary like to ......?"  
  

Interestingly Hindi does not use the third-person system of address. The distinction is तू,, तुम, and आप. Similar distinction exists in Tamil as நீ, நீர், நீங்கள். However, while addressing a very senior officer the subordinate sometimes uses the third-person even in Tamil, although the word நீங்கள் is the equivalent of the respectful आप in Hindi.  
  

I am not aware whether there is an equivalent of आप in Sanskrit which is second person and not third person. This leaves only two choices --- either address everyone as त्वम् which to our Indian minds will be distasteful when addressing elders, or to continue with the third-person भवान्. Perhaps one could make the use of भवान् less frequent.
