Bhavaan is respectful / honorific (more s'ishTa)singular. That is how it differs from tvam. The singular in that does not remove the respect in the expression. This gives a greater accuracy in the expression, than where you have plural as the expression of respect thatleads to ambiguity whether the plural used is for communicating respect or for describing plurality. It gives greater accuracy compared to even expressions like aap that convey respect but not the clarity about how many personsare being addressed respectfully.
