Many thanks for the comments of scholars on this point.

1\. Instances of respectful plural being used to refer to and address respected persons can be ferretedout in Sanskrit literature. Philosophers/Commentators refer to Sri Shankaracharya as Sankarabhagavatpaadaah.

2\. It is also agreed that Sanskrit grammar does not prohibitsuch usage

3\. Exceptions prove the rule as they say. Even in Abhijnanashakuntala although the sage refers to himself in plural, his disciples address him with Bhavaan.

4\. In Indian languages I know, usage of plural for respected persons is the rule. It is this fact that impels modern Sanskrit writers/speakers to use plural even in Sanskrit. अमुकवर्याः आध्यक्षम् अवहन्. अमुकवर्याः अभाषन्त, अमुकवर्याः उपस्थिताः आसन् instead of अमुकवर्यः आध्यक्षम् अवहत् इत्यादि.

भवदीयः,
