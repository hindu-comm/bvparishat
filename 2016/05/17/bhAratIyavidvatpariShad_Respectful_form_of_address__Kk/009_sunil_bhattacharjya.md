While Aap is only in singular, the plural is aaplog, but hum can be used both in singular and plural while humlog is in plural only. .There are exceptions, such as in the Lukhnowi style, where even a child is addressed as aap. Another exception is that a sanyashi would generally speak of himself in pluranl and not in singular.
