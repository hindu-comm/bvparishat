Sir / Madam,  

 Kindly refer to a post you have put up in the google group भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत् inviting articles for your journal. The message does not give some of the essential details. Could you kindly give the following details:  
  

What is the expected length of the articles in words?  

What should be the medium --- English or Hindi or Sanskrit?  

What are the focus areas? For instance, will it be relevant if I write an article on the need for simplifying Sanskrit grammar to make the language popular among the masses and suggest the type of simplification that would not harm the basic structure of the language?  
  

The deadline of 25th May seems to be somewhat short. You may consider extending it to the end of this month.  
  

Regards,  

Dogra, Chennai
