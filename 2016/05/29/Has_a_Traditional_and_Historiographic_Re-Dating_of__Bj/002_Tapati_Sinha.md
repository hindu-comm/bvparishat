Thank you sir for the link on IVC dating. I am working on IVC related topic and Vedic India.

  

For those who are interested on the topic of misconceptions on dates of Indian History, I would like them to read the following articles.There were few interesting articles posted in the journals of ‘**IndiaFacts Research Centre’.**

Few weeks back, a question was raised by one of the members of this group regarding the Inscriptions of Asoka and dating of Indian History. These articles were written on similar issues. You can also read these articles and the complete archive by visiting [www.indiafacts.co.in](http://www.indiafacts.co.in/).

These articles are written by [Dr. Raja Ram Mohan Roy](http://indiafacts.org/author/dr-raja-ram-mohan-roy/). The site has introduced the author as follows:

Dr. Raja Ram Mohan Roy earned his B. Tech in Metallurgical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, and Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering from The Ohio State University, USA. He has worked as a Research Scientist and Project Manager for over 20 years in Canada. He has written three path breaking books on Indian history titled “India before Alexander: A New Chronology”, “India after Alexander: The Age of Vikramādityas”, and “India after Vikramāditya: The Melting Pot”. He is currently working on his fourth book on Indian history titled “India before Buddha: Vedic kingdoms in 2nd millennium BCE”.
