A few years back we heard of re-dating, of Buddha, recently in a lecture *( thread available in BVP),* on re-dating of ASoka with possible earlier foot-steps and now

a reporting that our civilization dates back to 8000 years,

  

<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Indus-era-8000-years-old-not-5500-ended-because-of-weaker-monsoon/articleshow/52485332.cms?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=TOI>  

  

Much controversy and critique of BhAratIya tradition for its non-historicity has been in air recently. Archaeological supports, DNA foot printing are coming up with support as well.

Is not it a time for our learned BVP members to begin thinking for re-writing the time line of country which has never had a full stop, as its tradition has been reminding?

  

Who knows, after a few centuries and other Sheldon Pollock may come to analyse literary history of Sanskrit of India for our current time slot and declare a re-shift in trend and attitude in Sanskrit Scholarship?

  

Just shareing my thoughts, nothing to hurt any body.

Best Wishes

Sati Shankar
