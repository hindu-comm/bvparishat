Respected Scholars,

  

I am only a Sanskrit-lover, I have this doubt. Mostly north Indian priests famously recite one sloka on every auspicious occasion, that is

  
"mangalam bhagavAn viSNu mangalam garuDadadvaja ;  
mangalam punDarIkAkSa mangalAyatano hari".  
  

I am utterly confused. Please enlighten me if it is Sanskrit or sanskritized Hindi. Please forgive me for engaging scholars' attention to such a small issue.

  

Regards,
