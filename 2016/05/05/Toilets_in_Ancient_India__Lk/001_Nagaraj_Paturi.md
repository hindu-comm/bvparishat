Any write-up on the history of flush toilets is not going without the mention of IVC toilets. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flush_toilet>

has this:

Toilets that used water were used in the Indus Valley Civilization. The cities of Harappa and [Mohenjo-daro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohenjo-daro "Mohenjo-daro") had a flush toilet in almost every house, attached to a sophisticated sewage system. See also Hydraulic engineering of the Indus Valley Civilization. They also appear in Knossos and [Akrotiri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrotiri_(Crete) "Akrotiri (Crete)") of the ancient Minoan civilization from the 2nd millennium BC

Locations of IVC sites are beyond the original cites of Harappa Mohanjedaro. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Indus_Valley_Civilisation_sites>

  

In fact, the site they mention as an examplefor flush toilet sewerage is Dholavira located on Khadir Beyt, an island in the Great Rann of Kutch in Gujarat .
