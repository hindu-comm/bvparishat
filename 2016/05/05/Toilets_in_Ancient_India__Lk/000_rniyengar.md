Dear Prof.Aklujkar, in another thread you wrote:

  

Can we be reasonably sure that there is no reference to scavenging in pre-colonial Indian texts?  
  
By the way, some years back I made this note: Kalhaṇa’s Rāja-taraṅgiṇI 4.573 has the word pāyu-kṣālana-veśma.  

  

I am interested in this question and have looked into some of the texts. Vishvakarma Prakasha while indicating the position of various rooms (shaalaa) in a site meant for a residence does indicate a direction and position for "Vaahsthala" or "Vaashaalaa" that is the Latrine. This seems to differentiate Latrines from Snaanagr.ha or bathing room.The Manjusri-vAstu is a Sanskrit Buddhist text from Sri Lanka similar to Mayamata etc. In this text also a definite direction and location is specified for the Latrine in the Chaityas. However, this may not answer whether or not manual scavenging was in vogue. On the other hand I recollect a report by BB Lal about excavations in the so called "Mahabharata sites". I think it was in the excavations at Hastinapur (c 1200 BCE) he shows the figure of a pot-above-a-pot- above- a-pot-----above-a-pot going deep into the ground almost like a tube well, which is interpreted as a latrine. It would appear in such a contraption scavenging was not required.****

**I am writing from memory but I will provide the references in a few days time**.
