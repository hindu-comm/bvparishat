Forms such as लता पुष्पं पुष्प्यति are legitimate, but something likeलता दुर्लभंपुष्पं पुष्प्यति (literally, "theplant flowers a rare type of flower")is more likely to be used.

  

आत्मानम्, as before,can be seen implicit in these instances, sinceपुष्पं andफलं (both,accusative)belongtoलता andवृक्षः respectively in these examples.

  

Actually I think these are very good examples, carefully chosen.

  

Now let me go to the furthest extreme:

राम: सीताम् आसने तिष्ठति ।

  

This is somewhat equal to :

  

"Rāma sits Sītā in the chair."

Which is acceptable in English. So, even though Sita doesn't belong to Ram (though perhaps as his wife, she does), thereis a sense of आत्मीयता between Ram and Sita here, in the sense that Sita takes help of Ram in order to sit in the chair.

  

Still, I suppose it is important to adduceशिष्टप्रामाण्यम् for this third example, before making similar uses (in the आत्मीय sense only).

  

Another implication, as indicated earlier, is that in examples such as:

लता नित्यंपुष्पं पुष्प्यति ।  

There is no need to considerनित्यं as अव्ययम्, sinceनित्यं as accusative will do. This is applicable to the whole list of अव्ययानि of accusative forms (andeven ablative in certainway).

  

In the end consensus is the only authority. But in themeantimewe should keep askingthe difficult questions.
