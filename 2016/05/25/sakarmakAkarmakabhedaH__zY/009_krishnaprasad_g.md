namaste  

the old traditional way to teach about sakarmaka dhatu is scrappy. And leads to confusion as it happened to you. for accusative in indian lang we put genetive case  
  

There is a work called Dhatuvrttisara by Unknown author and has many commentaries which gives clear ideas about sakarmaka and akarmaka by giving beautiful and simple sentences for all Dhatus. It was first edited incompletely by Anundoram Borooah in 1870s  
  

  
  

In Sanskrit if a Karta is who one does some action or to be more specific actually does a work is called karta i.e FINAL work is done on some thing (or on some object) then the object on which the work is done takes dviteeya vibhakti or accusative case  
  

for instance  

If a person is simple sitting or standing, that doesn/t means he is working on any thing because he is idle . hence तिष्ठति is akarmaka.  
  

चल कंपने here वातेनांबरं चलति simply shaking is not a work hence akarmaka  
  

अत्ति भक्षयति खादति हरिः फलं here hari eats a fruit , eating is a work and is done on fruit hence it took dviteeya and all the listed roots here are sakarmaka.  
  

घटं जानाति has also सन्निकर्ष hence sakarmaka  
  

द्विकर्मक is also like this final work is milking hence in Karmani prayoga miliking still remains in accusative and for गो genetive.  
  

So this is just commen sense mukhya karma which actual work is done still reamins in dviteeya in karmani prayoga. There is an exception for commen sense and hence karika गौणे कर्मणि दुह्यादेः प्रधाने नीहृकृष्वहाम्
