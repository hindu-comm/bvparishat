प्रणाम ।

  

The translation is good enough.पाद is the objectof उदङ्कन् (nominative) and aśva (nominative).

आत्मानम् is a theoretical tool usedto explain the fact that the accusativeपादम् belongs to the nominative aśva. There is no need to religiously believe in its realexistence.

  

I am aware thatएकैकंmeans "each and every". I used the enumeration - the "sum all" -aspect of the meaning. There will belimitations of a translation.  

  

Regardingउदंकन् I don't care about its meaning because that is not going to change the argument. However, scholars are welcome to share any information.

  

Thepoint was: "a so called intransitive verb taking aकर्म. So that अकर्मक / सकर्मक are not useful categories within Sanskrit."

  

The implications are far from trivial. Due to artificial frameworks Sanskrit has gathered a long list of अव्ययानि, many of which are notअव्ययानि but just the troops from theaccusatives employedin कर्मकर्तृ usages.

  

And though I bungled on my other examples (अरक्षितम्, निराश्रयम्) I still maintain that they are correctlyunderstood withकर्मकर्तृ प्रकरण.

  

I believe this is my concludingpost in this thread.
