It looks like Mr. Tuvij is mixing up the nominative and the accusative of words in the neuter,

simply because they have the same form.

  

I guess internalising a language requires more effort -

reading a lot of literature in the language,

and where necessary/possible more with the aid of commentaries in the same language,

than with the aid of renderings in another language.

  

His rendering of *aviśeṣa* as gross body in the cited Sankhya text is also dubious.
