No, this is primarily a demonstrative / didactic usage, and in that sense evenall the more correct. For example, see here:

<http://learnsanskrit.org/nouns/pronouns/questions>

-   नरः**किं**गच्छति

    naraḥ**kiṃ**gacchati

    **To where**does the man go?

However,किं स्थानं गच्छति is indeedwhat can be said anacceptable व्यवहारिक usage. The reason might have more to do with the fact thatस्थानम् (plugging even one more accusative)here removes theambiguities of किम् (which can be अव्यय, or can mean: what, how, who, etc).

  

So I will take "किं स्थानं गच्छति" as the विवक्षा in that case, rather thanकिंगच्छति.

  

The central point remains: any Sanskrit verb can be सकर्मक or अकर्मक depending on the presence or absence of द्वितीया terms in the sentence. So much so thatसकर्मक andअकर्मक are not useful categories at all.

  

We don't need puzzles either: where कर्ता itself becomesthe कर्म, like aRussell's Barberparadox or something.

  

For example, in

स: तिष्ठति ।

we can add आत्मानम्

स: आत्मानम् तिष्ठति ।

  

-a demonstrative example, granted,but suffices to umderscore the point.

  

On the other hand, retaining the categories ofसकर्मक andअकर्मक necessitatesadding a fewmore, as in saying-

आत्मानम् is क्रियाविशेषण. Like स्वयम्, etc.

  

However, a theory (ifone needs theorising at all)is economical (and better)ifit uses lessernumber of categories to explain the same set of data.स: (तम्)आत्मानम् तिष्ठति uses nothing more than thebasic कारक-structure based on naturalistic principles.
