Misra is right in pointing out the split as

*vinā viśeṣaiḥ (*in the *Sāṅkhya Kārikā* verse).

  

That is the more popular reading,

and can make better sense.

  

However, Gauḍapāda has taken it as *vinā**aviśeṣaiḥ*.

  

Yet, Tuvij's interpretation, ortranslation as he chooses to call it, of
*aviśeṣa*as "gross body" is gross mistranslation,

going against the grain of the original.

  

Tuvij is pushingआत्मानम् everywhere (pun intended).
