नमस्ते ।  
  
किम् गच्छति ? is consistent. The answer could be, अयोध्याम् गच्छति ।  
"goes to which (city)?" is the English translation.  
  
राम: अयोध्याम् गच्छति । Here we have अयोध्या plugging in as the accusative in this sentence. In Sanskrit obviously it is not necessary that all vibhakti-s be plugged-in (or be presented) in a single sentence.  
  
So we have,  
राम: गच्छति ।  
or, simply  
गच्छति । where even the nominative राम: is divested.  
  
राम: अयोध्यायाम् गच्छति on the other hand - where we have Ayodhya in locative - technically means,  
"Rāma goes in the context of Ayodhyā."  
It can, depending on the paragraph, mean anything from "Ram goes to Ayodhya." to even "Ram goes to (Patna) for deliberating on an issue regarding Ayodhya."  
  
परस्मै vs. आत्मने  
  
राम: अयोध्याम् गच्छति । means, "Ram goes to Ayodhya."  
राम: अयोध्याम् गच्छते । means, "Ram moves to Ayodhya."  
  
In my opinion, all Sanskrit verbs admit being कर्मक or अकर्मक (depending on whether the accusative has been plugged or not into the sentence).
