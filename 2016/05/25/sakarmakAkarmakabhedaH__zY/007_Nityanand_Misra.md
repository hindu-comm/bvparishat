I have not come across a usage like "किम् गच्छति" as a question. I do not know what you mean by consistent, but it sounds odd in Sanskrit. Usually the usage is कुत्र गच्छति due to विवक्षा of आधार. A usage like किं स्थानं गच्छति still sounds okay, but not किं गच्छति. One can justify किं गच्छति with grammar if it occurs in a शिष्ट usage, but does it? Such usages are व्यवहारवेद्य and dictionaries or grammar cannot help much here.

  

“Wie geht es Ihnen?” sounds perfect in German but “How does it go for you?” sounds odd in English. One cannot understand the sense of “Wie geht es Ihnen?” using a German-English dictionary or German grammar book in English. One has to live the German language to understand “Wie geht es Ihnen?”
