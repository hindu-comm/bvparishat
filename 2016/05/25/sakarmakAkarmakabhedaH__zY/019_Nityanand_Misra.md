As Prof. Kannan pointed out, you have mixed up nominative singular and accusative singular as the forms are the same in neuter gender forअकारान्त words. In SK 41 (निराश्रयं लिङ्गं न तिष्ठति),निराश्रयं is theneuternominative form and not the accusative form. The corresponding usages in feminine and masculine would be निराश्रया छाया न तिष्ठति andनिराश्रयो जीवो न तिष्ठति, respectively.

  

Similarly, in H 2.17,अरक्षितंis theneuternominative form and not the accusative form. With the ellipsis, the reading is to be understood asअरक्षितं \[वस्तु\] दैवरक्षितं \[सत्\] तिष्ठतिसुरक्षितं \[वस्तु\] दैवहतं \[सत्\] विनश्यति.The corresponding usages in feminine and masculine would beअरक्षिता \[सम्पद्\] दैवरक्षिता \[सती\] तिष्ठतिसुरक्षिता \[सम्पद्\] दैवहता \[सती\] विनश्यति andअरक्षितः \[निधिः\] दैवरक्षितः \[सन्\] तिष्ठतिसुरक्षितः \[निधिः\] दैवहतः \[सन्\] विनश्यति.

  

And no, there is no implicitaccusative आत्मानम्. Not only do the translations leave a lot to be desired, your reading in SK also appears to be incorrect (It isविना विशेषैः to my information)

The previous usages are very different from what you have above. I do not think you know what you are talking about.

It was unknown to majority of writers that‘कर्ता itself being the default कर्म’?This make no sense to me.Grammarians created categories which did not exist?What are you trying to say?
