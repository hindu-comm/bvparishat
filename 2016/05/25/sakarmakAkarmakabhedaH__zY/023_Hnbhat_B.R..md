Again wrong translation. As it is पाद is the object of उदङ्कन् as is in the right order.

अश्वः एकैकं पादम् उदंकन् तिष्ठति।

एकैकं is adjective to पादम् कर्म for उदंकन् and does not need any आत्मानम् for the intransitive verb तिष्ठति.

एकैकं पादम् means each foot and not all feeet as far as I can understand.

You can refer to any commentary for the meaning of उदंकन् in the context than your own translation.
