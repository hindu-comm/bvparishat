नमो नमः।

Vidwan Nityananda Mishra says,

{{I have not come across a usage like "किम् गच्छति" as a question. I do not know what you mean by consistent, but it sounds odd in Sanskrit. Usually the usage is कुत्र गच्छति due to विवक्षा of आधार.}}

Vidwan Kalicharan Tuvij says, ****

**{{**किम् गच्छति ? is consistent. The answer could be, अयोध्याम् गच्छति ।**}} **

**{{**this is primarily a demonstrative / didactic usage, and in that sense evenall the more correct.**}}**



While going through these exchanges, the following thoughts came to my mind.

कुत्र (incorporating the त्रल्‌-प्रत्ययः) is basically related to an अधिकरण (सप्तमी विभक्तिः). Therefore a query such as “रामः कुत्र गच्छति?” should normally call for a reply incorporating the destination in सप्तमी विभक्ति only. But as is the established practice of the Sanskrit language, the destination is treated like a कर्म and hence it is in द्वितीया विभक्ति.

If the reply is expected with a द्वितीया विभक्ति; then the query too should have been with the same विभक्ति. But that is not so in Sanskrit. Apparently, the destination is treated like an अधिकरण in a query, while the same is treated like a कर्म in the reply.

I find this rather strange. Would the scholars kindly shed some more light on this peculiarity of Sanskrit?
