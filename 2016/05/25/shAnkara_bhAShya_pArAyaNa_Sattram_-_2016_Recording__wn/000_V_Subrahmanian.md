AShānkara Bhāṣya Pārāyaṇa Sattram, an annual feature, was held from May 14 to 18, 2016, at Japadakaṭṭe (Japyakshetram) near K.R.Nagar, Mysore.
During the evenings there were lectures on the theme of Mandukya Upanishad with the four-part kārikās. Eminent scholars - MM Swaminathan Sharma, Sri Mani Dravid Sastrinaḥ, and Sri
