Yes, @kashcit with 659 followers is most likely Vishvas Vasuki, he earlier used the handle @vAsukeya if I remember correctly.

  

But I think the most followed BVP member on Twitter is Udayana Hegde (@udayanah) with 1,417 followers.

  

On the biased reporting in The Hindu, I just tweeted here: <https://twitter.com/MisraNityanand/status/735640097744400384>, list members who agreed with remarks by Prof. Paturi here please retweet and spread the message.
