In fact social media following does not work that way... not most followers really follow in practice when it come to spread some information unless it interests them... in the same way as not all the 1.5k group members active in discussion...but only a handful ones....or unless some are on the job of trailing....

But even then it helps disseminate information.

Best wishes

Sati Shankar
