I agree with Rajiv ji. Lets end this discussion BVP mailing list will NOT be involved in any activism. A separate entity can and will be created for this. I have copied this mail to the management team so that all are on the same page on this topic  
  

I don't wish agree with this comment " My view is this group lacks the prerequisites." One should only do things one will excel in, and not flirt with things beyond one's expertise" This is your view please don't be judgemental on others. One cannot speak of others competencies and capability. One can only speak about what one is capable off Thanks
