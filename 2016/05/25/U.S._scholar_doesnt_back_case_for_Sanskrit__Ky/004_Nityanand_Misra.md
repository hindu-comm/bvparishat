Maybe we write a letter to Anuradha Raman, the author, or the editor of The Hindu. Prof. Rani Sadashivamurthy did so a few days ago (on the ET article if I remember correctly), but it was not published in its entirety by the publication.

  

A better option, in my opinion, is to use the social media to create awareness every time we come across such misleading titles and/or journalistic biases. At an event in Mumbai recently, Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy \[correctly\] said something on the lines of “Don’t bother too much about what the mainstream media says. The real media is social media. And if we are winning there, we are winning.” I had also requested Sanskrit scholars and students to be active on social media in my interview with DD News Vartavali. **If Sanskrit scholars have a united voice on social media, it cannot be suppressed by anybody**.

  

Perhaps it is high time to give a legal status to BVP (proposed by Sati Shankar Ji several times) by registering it as a non-profit society. We have 1000+ members. If we have an official Twitter account, we will have many followers who will happily retweet and spread the voice of Sanskrit scholars of this country. Imagine the official account of Samskrita Bharati (3000+ followers) or RSS (with 115K followers) RTing a tweet by BVP which corrects the biases in a news article: the reach of BVP's voice may be even more than the original news article. I must say the official voice of BVP need not be a political voice, but a voice whose purpose is to serve the cause of Sanskrit scholarship. Support to spread that voice should be welcome from any political or non-political organization.

  

PS: Anuradha Raman tweets using the handle @raman_anuradha. Why don't some list members who are active and have significant number of followers on Twitter (Vishvas Vasuki comes to mind) tweet on this, tagging her?
