In fact the very term, called "scholarship" is generally used as a veil, Some time it is used to express professional edge and some tine as a escape from social responsibilities.

But point to think is it really possible to focus and keep confined to studies and writings when country, its tradition burning and conscience being ruptured? There must always be a balance. Dont scholars, in all the disciplines, have a responsibility toward that?

These words of mine must not be taken as if aimed to BVP and its members, it is directed to scholars in general,

So what a wall is raised in the name of scholarship it gives confused signal, of being used either offensive or defensive.

  

so far as social media is concerned, it is mainly for activists and those who are socially alert, all inclusive... to construct or distruct.

BVP as such and given its nature, I am afraid, may not make such activism as its main object, and it should not do.

  

Nothing official, nothing to hurt or oppose anybody, just sharing thoughts,

Regards

Sati Shankar
