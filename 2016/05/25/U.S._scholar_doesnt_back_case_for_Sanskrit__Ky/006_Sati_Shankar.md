On..

"......Perhaps it is high time to give a legal status to BVP (proposed by Sati Shankar Ji several times) by registering it as a non-profit society. We have 1000+ members. If we have an official Twitter account, we will have many followers who will happily retweet and spread the voice of Sanskrit scholars of this country. Imagine the official account of Samskrita Bharati (3000+ followers) or RSS (with 115K followers) RTing a tweet by BVP which corrects the biases in a news article: the reach of BVP's voice may be even more than the original news article. I must say the official voice of BVP need not be a political voice, but a voice whose purpose is to serve the cause of Sanskrit scholarship. Support to spread that voice should be welcome from any political or non-political organization. ..."

Having it as a registered Society or not is matter of decision by the Group managers as it would be increasing their involvement with respect to time.

  

But what we can do is to come on Social media even if it is not registered, but the problem with available social media is that time line runs very fast and retrieval of contents is not as convenient as in case of Google Group, so they are momentary reflections... but even then very powerful... mischief played by MSM like the Hindu, which should be forced to change their name itself, as the are almost 180 degree opposite.

  

But BVP must have atleast twitter and facebook for fast communication and to gain force. It will get large followers given current situation in the country.

It is easy, quick and free. Even if BVP management is reluctant, members can follow each other and proceed.

We Indians do every thing but generally after time is over.

  

To begin with my twitter handle @satishankar, and on facebook with the same name.

Regards

Sati Shankar
