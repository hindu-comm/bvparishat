Dear Rajiv and friends,

  

By converting BVP to an activist unit, would destroy the erudition and the scholarship in the group.

An activist is a protester, not a producer. The first activity is political and is done by mobilization.

The second is done through contemplation. All would not have skills to participate in both together.

Sri Aurobindo had to confine himself in order to create his literature.
I think BVP should continue in

its larger reconstruction charter than protesting the polemics.

  

Protesting the media and arbitrary raw scholarship is necessary. Rajiv should continue to lead this

effort and others would follow as needed. BVP can register itself and stand up in unity in occasions

of need or condemnation. The new meta-Indology group should be supported to help develop the

analytic reasoning on the protests. We should raise funds to support individuals who could articulate

protests in timely manner. 

  

There is also disconnect of the Indian media from the native scholarship. It could be because of

English language and lack of bilingualism. The foreign language scholars present themselves as

bilingual with very little depth. All BVP scholars must participate in public lectures and forums in

promoting their line of work and research to reach out to the general mass. Public outreach skills

by the scholars should be encouraged and cultivated. 

  

So is my thought.
