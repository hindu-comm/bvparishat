I did not propose converting BVP into activism; some others did on this thread.

I explained the error in attempting such a thing without understanding it thoroughly; I pointed out the danger of imagining it to be a simple, casual affair.

My view is this group lacks the prerequisites.

Many activist groups exist with decades of experience.

One should only do things one will excel in, and not flirt with things beyond one's expertise.
