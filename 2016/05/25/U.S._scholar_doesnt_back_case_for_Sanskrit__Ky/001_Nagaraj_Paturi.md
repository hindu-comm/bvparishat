The title of the news report is misleading.

  

Inside the report, it has,

  

"In a short email interview to *The Hindu* , Prof. Henderson said he was not a Sanskrit scholar."

  

"Mr. Henderson did not to respond to a question on how Sanskrit would enhance the understanding of IIT undergraduates"

  

Where is any proof for the title inside the report?
