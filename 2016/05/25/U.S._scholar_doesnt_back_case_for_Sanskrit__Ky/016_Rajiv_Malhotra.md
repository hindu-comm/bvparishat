I agree with Shri Sati Shankar below. Random, inconsistent and casual efforts are a waste and wont produce impact, except the individual doing it might temporarily "feel good" about himself.  
  
Before doing any such social media, BVP must discuss the following strategic issues:  

-   Is BVP strictly "academic" as it claims? Or does it also want to get
    into *mainstream public activism*? The latter involves different
    focus, competence, risks, types of work. It cannot be casual,
    reactive, and done once in a while. -   If BVP decides to get into mainstream activism (which is what social
    media is meant for), then it better be an explicit decision, and not
    something a few members wander into occasionally when they are
    emotionally upset. -   If BVP makes such a change of its direction, it will have a lot of
    new things to learn. I am unaware of its leaders having much
    expertise in this activism domain. In fact, I see the members here
    reacting against such efforts at times, seeing them as
    "unscholarly". -   One of the new things to study would have to be the *organizational
    machinery of the opponents*. Only then can you have a strategy to
    engage/counteract the opponents effectively. This knowledge like any
    area of expertise requires extensive study, practice and perfection.
    It is not a simple machinery. Western academicians are highly
    engaged in social-political public spaces, but this is not
    casual/random. It is driven by solid foundations, organized plans,
    training on the methods, etc. I spent the past 25 years full-time
    engaging this machinery.

My general sense is that BVP presently lacks the prerequisite capabilities to participate effectively in social media. Its leaders must articulate a clear position, vision and strategy on it, if they would like to get involved in social media. *Suggestion*: Appoint a task force/committee to come back with a short report/proposal on the topic.

Regards,

Rajiv
