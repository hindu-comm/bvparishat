Dear list members

  

If anybody has the contact details (adress and phone/mobile number) of Mahāpaṇḍita Revāprasāda Dvivedī, can I request them to please respond to me **off the list**?

  

The entry on him in the*[Inventory of Sanskrit Scholars](http://www.sanskrit.nic.in/digitalbook/i/inventory%20of%20sanskrit%20scholars.pdf)*(p. 73) does not have any contact details.

  

Is Panditji still actively writing? I know he was till 2011, but I am not sure if he is any more.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
