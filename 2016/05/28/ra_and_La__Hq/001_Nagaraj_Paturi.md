The south Indian ळ is not the subject matter of Paninian rules. Hence one can not expect a rule from AA for this.

  

In the Sanskrit borrowings of south Indian languages, ल becomes ळ in many other contexts thanwhen र is followed by ल.

  

कला \> कळा ,कालिदास \> काळिदास 

  

ताल \> ताळ

  

गोल \> गोळ etc.

  

If any rules need to be formed about this, it should be in the grammars of the south Indian languages , in the sections dealing with Sanskrit borrowings.

  

What is interesting , in relation to this is that this south Indian influenced many north Indian languages.
