Is there any attested example ofईळ स्तुतौ in laukika usage? The Vedic usage अग्निमीळे is the subject of specific Prātitśākhya texts and rules, which do cover the consonant ळ. Given that ळ does not occur in the Śivasūtra-s or anywhere in Paninian grammar, it is clear that its use in laukika Sanskrit is non-standard. The use in books byRV Krsnamacariar, Punnasseri Nambi Neelakantha Shastri, T Ganapati Sastri is to be understood as effect of regional pronunciation, and not as evidence for its existence. As an analogy, the retroflex flap ड़ used in place of the \[unaspirated\] voicedretroflex stop ड in many places in Taranatha Tarkavacaspati’s वाचस्पत्यम्, but that cannot be used to infer that ड़ is standard in Sanskrit.

  

Only the use ofळin Vedic texts orally transmitted by tradition and accounted for by Prātitśākhya rules is justified. In the other cases, it is an orthographic anomaly influenced by regional, non-standard, and Prakrit-influenced pronunciation.
