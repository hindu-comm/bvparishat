Misra ji  
  
You said

  
"the consonant ळ. Given that ळ does not occur in the Śivasūtra-s or anywhere in Paninian grammar, it is clear that its use in laukika Sanskrit is non-standard. The use in books byRV Krsnamacariar, Punnasseri Nambi Neelakantha Shastri, T Ganapati Sastri is to be understood as effect of regional pronunciation, and not as evidence for its existence"  
  

Then why did not they use completely the letter ळ ? Do you have Nischaya regarding the usage only because of Regional influence or guessing?  
  

Here is a quotation from Tantra Grantha written by Sri Madhvacharya  
  

अजः, आनंदः, इंद्रः.........लक्ष्मीपतिः....ळाळुकः (as far me I could not found this in veda) which is 50 names of god. Not considering the letter क्ष etc as they are not svatantra akshara but not in the case letter ळ.  
  

between did you read the attachment which I have sent. ?  
  

Further I don't have any thing to reply because I don't have proofs. Some scholars strongly argue that , there was an independent existence for ळ in old sanskrit. Espcially in Madhva philosophy, there exist a MSS which direct disciple of sri Madhvacharya has written, in that he constantly uses both la La. sri Madhvachary uses Mahavykarana (which is dfferent from Paninian, ref V Raghvans Article How Many Vyakaranas On Felicitation vol of Charudeva shastri)  

  

Even Panini agrees his purva acharyas. So according to other vyakaranas La would be present. Due to wide popularity of Panini it may have lost. Also Panini mentions the rule based on region. So Prayoga sharanaha vaiyakaranah.  
  
  

I will divert from the topic here.  
  

Sri Madhvacharya uses different forms of words also  

for instance  
  

संख for संख्य (war) (this usage is see Not only in the MSS written by Desciple of sri Madhvacharya but also I have seen old mss from Srilanka uses संख and not संख्य for further reference please refer printed edition Janakiharana by Godukumbara 1968 England)  
  

भत्सन for भर्तस्न (भर्त्सयति) (this usage is also have the samavada from Janakiharana)  
  

रुग्म for रुक्म (he even changes this in Rgveda, hence रुग्मांगद रुग्मिणी etc, I have not checked Critical editon of Mahabharata whether this usage exists but according to Ksirasvami the sutra patha is thus नहिवृतिवृषिव्यधिरुजिसहितनिषु but according to vamana sutra of panini is thus नहिवृतिवृषिव्यधिरुचिसहितनिषु because of this patha bedha rukmi has evolved.)  
  

दुःषन्त for दुष्यन्त (this has the samvada from Critical edn Mahabharata. And further R D Karmarkar uses in his Abhijnana Shakuntala edition)  
  

बाहुषाळी (this has the samvada from amrtakataka vyakya. and is derived from षळ गतौ बाहुभ्यां सळत इति बाहुषाळी)  
  

So unless for proving or disproving ळ existence has no निश्चय one cannot decide निश्चायकप्रमाणाभावात्  
  

Thanks
