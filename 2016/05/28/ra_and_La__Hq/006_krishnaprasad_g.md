I have seen all south Indian books written or edited by scholars like RV Krsnamacariar, Punnasseri Nambi Neelakantha Shastri, T Ganapati Sastri, etc using ळ in their books. There are many researches have been done on this. You will get it by looking into old journals like Sahrdaya, Udayana Patrika, Vijnana chinatamani, Chandrika etc.  
Sri Bannanje Govindacharya says, there is a sanskrit letter ळ in loukika usage also because Kasakrtsna Dhatu paatha lists ईड स्तुतौ and also ईळ स्तुतौ and regarding Vaidika usage is we have famous mantra from Rgveda- अग्निमीळे पुरोहितं  
  
here check the sample of the article by Sri Bannanje. He has also written in detail in Kannada language.
