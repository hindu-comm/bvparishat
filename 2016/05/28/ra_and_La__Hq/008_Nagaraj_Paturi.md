\>However, the reason forळ in plurals such as ūḷḷu, trāḷḷu, kāḷḷu etc. has nothing to do with *nati sūtra*. It is because the original plural in Dravidian has a retroflex -ḷ (It is *-kaḷ* in South Dravidian languages such as Tamil, Kannada etc.). Early (pre-Nannayya) Telugu inscriptions also show -ḷ for non-human plurals.

  

ūḷḷu, trāḷḷu, kāḷḷu are not possible in Telugu. ūl̥lu, trāl̥lu, kāl̥lu are the correct words. The germination of retroflex l̥ is not possible in Telugu. The articulatory mechanism itself is such that the tongue drops from the hard palate down to the alveolar ridge to make the second l into a non-retroflex one. The Telugu plural suffix, either derived from -kal̥ ( leaving ka in eluka, chiluka etc. through wrong splitting ) or from \*-l̥ , is l only. The retroflex in ūl̥lu, trāl̥lu, kāl̥lu is a phonetic change from the r, ḍ, l respectively of ūru, trāḍu, kālu.Pre-Nannaya l̥ is a stage before l̥>l historical change.

  

It is also true that the plural formation rule fromChinnaya Suri is not related to the l>l̥ change occurring in the environment of v_v inside aword.
