I thought about my own question raised above and realised that Rishi Valmiki's use of Panchami is deliberate and not accidental.  
  

The Rishi did not create the story of Lord Rama, as a novelist creates a story. The story simply flowed from the Rishi to humanity and, therefore, Panchami is the most suitable vibhakti. He was a medium and not the creator. Hence, Tritiyaa would be inappropriate.  
  

Scholars may give their opinion.
