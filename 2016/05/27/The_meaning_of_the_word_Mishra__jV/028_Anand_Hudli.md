Dear scholars,

  

There is a book called "ब्राह्मणोत्पत्ति दर्पण" by Makkhan Lal Mishra, Neeta Publishers, New Delhi, 2006. I have cursorily glanced through the pages and found that the book contains descriptions of North Indian Brahmana communities such as the Pancha Gauda brahmanas, the Maithila Brahmanas, the Kanyakubja Brahmanas, Mathur Chaturvedi Brahmans, and others, besides South Indian Brahamana communities. It appears the surname Mishra appears in many of these Brahmana communities. I did not notice any reference to Brahmin-Kshatriya marriages in connection with the Mishra surname.

  

Anand
