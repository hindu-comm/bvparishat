What gave you the impression that I have a derogatory feeling for Kṣatriya-s? Where did I say anything that gave such an impression? My objection was to your position that Miśra-s were descendents of children born out of wedlock. You very well know that the phrase ‘born out of wedlock’ means ‘an illegitimate child’, or ‘a bastard’. This is a scandalous claim, especially when no proof of it exists.

  

Do you not think that you should be more careful while making an uncorroborated claim that a community descended from bastards? I take it personally as I belong to that community. You come from Bengal, where Caitanya Mahāprabhu was born Viśvambhara Miśra, as the son of Jagannātha Miśra. Are you implying his forefathers were bastards? The lack of sensitivity is sickening,

In your first post you claimed Miśra-s were descendents of children born *out of marriage*. Now you are contradicting yourself by proposing a possibility that one of Vācaspati Miśra’s forefathers *married* a Kṣatriya women. Please stick to one stand.

I do not think the citation of any source will be disapproved by the moderator. Please search for the proof and share when you have it.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
