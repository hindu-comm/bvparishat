Dear Mishraji,  
  
I do not have any derogatory feeling for kshatriyas like you have .Lord Krishna. Lord Ram, Lord Buddha were all Kshatriyas and so was king Janak. Were they lower than any brahmin? Hanuman Ramayana says that Mandodari told Ravana that she was a kshatriya woman and she wanted to fight against Lord Ram in that war but Ravana did not permit. Any pious Hindu take the name of the panchakanyas including mahasati Mandodari.  
  
I read long back that the children born out of samparka of brahman father and kshatiya mother is called Mishra. That has nothing to do with the scholarship of the Mishra descendents. To prove that none of the forefathers of Vacaspati Mishra.married a kshatriya woman you will have to trace his family history, so the example of Vacaspati Mishta's scholarship in this case is irrelevant. Further, I will not take the trouble of searchng for the proof of what I read, as what is the surety that my reply will be approved by the moderator. If moderatorji asks me to search for the proof of what I wrote I will definitely try to do that.
