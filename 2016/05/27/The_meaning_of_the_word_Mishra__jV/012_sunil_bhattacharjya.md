Dear Nityanandaji,  
  

May be I should have used the phrase"within wedlock" in place of "out of wedlock" . May be my English was faulty as "out of wedlock" means to me as "as consequence of". I did not mean any illegitimate marriage. I can understand the reason for your anger and hope you understand now in what sense I wrote.
