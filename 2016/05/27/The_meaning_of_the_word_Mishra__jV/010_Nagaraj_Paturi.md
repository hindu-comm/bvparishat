When I found a post from this person in this thread, I expected a decent expression such as " I did not want to offend anyone through my post. But I apologise ifI did inadvertently..." or something like that. But I never expected that he would blame it on the moderator to have allowed such a post. In any scholarly discussion, evidences are expected to be providedfor the approval of all thescholarly audience and not on demand from the moderator.

  

Where is the question of respect for Kshatriyas here?

  

This is a question of an implausible sociological process being proposed as a theory to an august scholarly audience.

  

There are many such hearsay popular gossip 'theories' of community origins and many such folk etymologies. Scholars do not take them as sound academic theories.
