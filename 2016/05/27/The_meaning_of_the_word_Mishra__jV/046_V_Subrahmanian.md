Namaste

  

I would like to have a clarification from the learned members here. It is well known that the surname 'Rao' and ('Bāi' for females) is used by both Brahmins and non-Brahmins, both in the South and in the North (Maharashtra, for example). I would like to know whether a similar practice exists for the surname 'Mishra' in those regions where this name is commonly used.
