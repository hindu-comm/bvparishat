Dear Ajitji,  
  

I am hurt by your following sweeping statement

  
  
"As you know he is trying to maintain a view which has no factual evidence. The other responses were very informative. We need to further look into those texts mentioned by scholars"  
  

Earlier when there was a query from Shri Nityanand Mishraji regarding where I found the mention of Jinasena's work "Harivamsa" in relation to the times of Lord Mahavira, I wrote a reply and quoted from the source I referred to. Unfortunately my reply did not appear in BVP. Even before that I wrote another reply to a mail from Prof. Korada Subramanyamji in connection with the discussion regarding the meaning of the word "Nischala", and that mail too did not appear. It is for this reason I am wary that If I try to locate the source which said that the term "Mishra" is connected with the children of a brahmin father and a kshatriya mother, it will be a waste of my efforts if that mail dos not appear in the BVP. So I want to avoid of tracing the source I read years ago and which the other scholars of BVP had been unable to trace so far, unless moderatorji assures me that I can go ahead with the tracing the source, which I read years ago.  
  

Regards,
