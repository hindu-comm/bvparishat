Dear Sunilji,  

I have no objections to any posts. Please trace the source. It would have been better if you had traced the source first and then written. Please re-post your earlier post mention of Jinasena's work "Harivamsa" in relation to the times of Lord Mahavira. So Please don't say your post did not appear all posts will appear.
