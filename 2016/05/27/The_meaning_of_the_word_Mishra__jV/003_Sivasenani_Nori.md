To the extent I know it is an honorific, used after the names of learned people. It is often used a second time after somebody named Misra, as in अमुक् मिश्रमिश्रैः यदुक्तम् ...

  

If one is looking for a Yaugikaartha, the miSraNa would be of different Saastras, which would would give the ability to discriminate. SishTas are learned in more than one Saastra (for instance, see Mahabhashyam under 6.3.109 पृषोदरादीनि यथोपदिष्टम्); in DharmaSaastra works, Judges are often required to be learned in more than one Saastra.
