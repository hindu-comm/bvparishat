The good intensions of the thread initiator AadaraNIya Subrahmanianji were clearly evident from his response to a beautiful explanation from AadaraNIya Sivasenaniji. There is scholarship in those posts and the etymological post by AadaraNIya Nityanandji.Such discussions are not out of place here.

  

AadaraNIya Sunil Bhattacharjyaji could have avoided the insensitive and unscholarlypostthat does not match his erudition of great depth and width.

  

I agree that we should discontinue the discussion in such unwarranted directions.
