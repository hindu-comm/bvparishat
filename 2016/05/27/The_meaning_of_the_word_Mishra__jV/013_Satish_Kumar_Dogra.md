When I read the post asking for the origin of the name Mishra, I felt an amount of surprise, because I thought it was odd to be tracing the origins of what appears to be a caste-name with little relevance to the type of discussions one finds on this Forum. The explanation as mixture-of-castes brought more surprise, as it rang bells of a joke I had read long ago. The explanation sounded odd in a Forum that has all along maintained its dignity, decorum and seriousness of intellectual pursuit.  
  

I request all members of the Forum to close this discussion, so that we could get back to business again. Flippancy and mutual acrimony are completely out-of-place on this Forum.  
  

Let us forgive and forget and bury the hatchet, as the age-old saying goes.  

  

Regards,  

Dogra
