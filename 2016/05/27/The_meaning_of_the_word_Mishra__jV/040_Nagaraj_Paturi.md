I have a question on this surname Misra /Mishra that experts who thought /worked on the issue should be able to answer. The usagesquoted from the ancient works usually have the word as akaaraanta pumlinga, whereas the contemporary pronunciation of the word seems to be aakaaraanta, e.g.
'mis'raajee' .How can this be explained?
