There is also Śrīvatsāṅka Miśra.

  

The root for the word ‘मिश्र’ in the धातुपाठ is ‘मिश्र सम्पर्के’ (DP 1921).As per मेदिनीकोष, the word ‘सम्पर्क’ is used in the senses of ‘मेलक’ and ‘रति’ (सम्पर्को मेलके रतौ as per). The word ‘मेलक’ denotes ‘combining together’ or ‘uniting’, as the अमरकोष confirms – मेलके सङ्गसङ्गमौ. The word ‘रति’ can mean either ‘प्रीति’ (pleasure or delight) or ‘रमण’ (bodily union).

  

Now coming back to ‘मिश्र’. The derivation is ‘मिश्रयति इति मिश्रः’, with the suffix अच् (पचाद्यच्) ordained in the sense of agent (कर्ता) by the rule नन्दिग्रहिपचादिभ्यो ल्युणिन्यचः (3.1.134), taking पचादि as आकृतिगण (काशिका confirms this by saying ‘पचादिराकृतिगणः’). Or one can take ‘अज्विधिः सर्वधातुभ्यः’. In either case, the suffix would be in the sense of ‘agent’ (कर्ता) and not object (‘कर्म’). This derivation ‘मिश्रयति इति मिश्रः’ is confirmed by the explanation of the word मिश्रेय in the अमरकोष by the व्याख्यासुधा commentary.

  

So ‘मिश्र’ by itself means ‘one who combines or unites’. This is the literal यौगिक meaning, and all other meanings (‘combined’, ‘honourable/best’, or ‘a kind of elephant’) are रूढि. That the word ‘मिश्र’ is used in कर्म also is confirmed by मुण्डमिश्रश्लक्ष्णलवणव्रतवस्त्रहलकलकृततूस्तेभ्यो णिच् (3.1.21) which carries over कर्मणः from 3.1.15 to get \[कर्मणः\] मिश्रात् \[करणे वा\] णिच्, मिश्रं करोति = मिश्रयति. However, when used used in the sense of object (i.e. in the meaning ‘combined’), it usually occurs as the उत्तरपद of a compound as per the वाचस्पत्यम् – ‘संयुते उत्तरपदस्थः’, for example in usages like गुडेन मिश्रः गुडमिश्रः (समास by पूर्वसदृशसमोनार्थकलहनिपुणमिश्रश्लक्ष्णैः, A 2.1.31).

  

The only meaning that makes sense for the मिश्र title or family name is ‘honourable/best’ which is byरूढि and not योग. The शब्दकल्पद्रुम and वाचस्पत्य list this sense as ‘श्रेष्ठः’ and ‘श्रेष्ठार्थे’ respectively. The people called मिश्र or the मिश्र community must have been considered among the foremost in learning and knowledge. While there is no explicit need to look for यौगिकार्थ in this sense, but if one wants to then the proposal by Sh. N Sivasenani makes sense.

  

PS: Sh. Sivasenani cites पृषोदरादीनि यथोपदिष्टम्. This is not needed as from the word मिश्र is the standard पचाद्यन्त form with मिश्र् (मिश्र सम्पर्के) + अच् and does not exhibit any वर्णागम, वर्णविपर्यय, वर्णविकृति, or वर्णलोप which are the characteristics associated with पृषोदरादि: भवेद्वर्णागमाद्धंसः सिंहो वर्णविपर्ययात्, गूढोत्मा वर्णविकृतेर्वर्णलोपात्पृषोदरः.
