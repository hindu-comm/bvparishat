Dear Dr. Bhattacharjya

  

The phrase ‘out of respect’ means ‘because of respect’. Other similar phrases are ‘out of interest/pity/curiosity’ which mean ‘because of interest/ pity/curiosity’. While I could not find this sense in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary, the online version of Macmillan Dictionary confirms this sense: <http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/out-of-interest-respect-pity-etc>

  

However, the phrase ‘out of wedlock’ means ‘of unmarried parents’. So the sentence ‘He was born out of wedlock’ means ‘His parents were not married when he was born’. This example is also from the online version of Macmillan Dictionary: <http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/wedlock>

  

English is indeed a funny language, as Mr. Bacchan [describes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSrMb8IBsTQ) in *Namak Halaal* (1982): “You see sir I can talk English, I can walk English, I can laugh English because English is a very funny Language. Bhairon becomes Baron and Baron becomes Bhairon, because their minds are very narrow.” This comic*tour de force*is included on page 118 of *Chutnefying English: The Phenomenon of Hinglish* by Rita Kothari and Rupert Snell (Penguin Books India, 2011, ISBN 9780143416395).

  

Thanks, Nityananda
