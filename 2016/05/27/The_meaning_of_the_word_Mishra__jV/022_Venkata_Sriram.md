Namaste,  
  
I vaguely remember the opinion of Kanchi Mahaperiyava in the collection of His discourses "The voice of Jagatguru". In telugu, it consists of some 10-12 volumes called "Jagatguru Bodhalu". In one of the volumes, Swamigal explains the origins of Pathak, Dwivedi, Trivedi, Chaubey, Jha, Mishra etc.  
  
Sri.Siva Senani Ji echoed what Paramacharya explained. They didn't stick to "one shAkha" of veda and studied multiple veda shAkhAs of sukla & yajurveda. Owing to their proficiency in multiple veda shAkhAs, the honorary title "mishra" was given.  
  
I can't quote the exact words of Paramacharya as I don't have those books now with me.  
  
regs,
