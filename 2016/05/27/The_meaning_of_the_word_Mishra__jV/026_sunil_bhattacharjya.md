Dear Nityanandaji,  
  
After receiving Ambaji's mail I also looked up and found that there is divided opinion on the phrase. "Out of wedlock" . It appears that probably it is better to describe children born of unmarried parents as children born outside the wedlock rather than calling that out of wedlock., The use of the phrase "Out of wedlock" to describe such children seems to be a later development in this funny language.. That is probably an effort to de-stigmatize such children to the extent possible.  
  

Regards,
