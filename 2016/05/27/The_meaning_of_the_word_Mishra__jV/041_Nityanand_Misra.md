The pronunciation is influenced by mother tongue, where there is either schwa syncope or schwa elongation at the end of the word. The situation is not very different from that ofगुप्त/गुप्ता, a surname found in vaiśya-s. Most commonly, people pronounce my last name asमिश्रा and would address me or my father as मिश्राजी. However, it is not uncommon to find learned people, especially in my home state of Uttar Pradesh, who are careful enough to pronounce the last name as मिश्र and address a person as मिश्रजी. When I sign my name in Hindi, I use मिश्र (and so does my father). Similarly, most people would pronounce गुप्ता/गुप्ताजी but we do have exceptions like the Hindi poet मैथिलीशरण गुप्त who is credited as गुप्त (and not गुप्ता) almost everywhere.

  

The audience also matters. The refined Hindi speaking (or Sanskrit-aware) audience which is accustomed to and familiar with the pronunciation मिश्र. When I am speaking amidst such people (भद्रलोक), I pronounce my last name as मिश्र while introducing myself. When I am speaking amidst a common audience or an English speaking audience unfamiliar with the original title and the nuances of pronunciation, I pronounce it as मिश्रा. It is inconsistent, but when in Rome, .....

  

Another difference is the use of 'h' while transcribing the name in English. The spelling ‘Mishra’ is more common and the spelling ‘Misra’ is less common, but both are the transliterations of the same last name.
