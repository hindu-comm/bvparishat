Yes, me too remember to have read so in the writings of Sri paramaachaarya.

I also recollect a reference to Mishra in the medeavel play (prahasana) lTakamElakaM. Here punkaTamishra, a character speaks of it's name Mishra as one who practices both the karma and unsanskrit kaaNDa-s : vyaakhyaayatE'smaabhiH karmameemaamsaa brwhmameemaamsaa ca. Katoti darshanadvayajnaanaad catamaran mishraaH. (P.36, chaukhambaa edition, vidyaabhavan geanthamaalaa series number : 87, Varanasi, 1962)
