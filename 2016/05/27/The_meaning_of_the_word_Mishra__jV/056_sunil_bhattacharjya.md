Namaste,  
  

To my understanding, the focus should be on the word "Mišra",which happens to be a Sanskrit word with a meaning, rather than on the word "Misra"? Kindly correct me if I am wrong.  
  

Is there any historical association of the great rishi Gautama, with the word "Mišra"?  
  

Regards,
