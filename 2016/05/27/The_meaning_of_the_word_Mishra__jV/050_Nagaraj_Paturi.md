In Telugu, the sambodhana prathamaa of Raama (RaamuDu) being Raamaa! O Raamaa! (in the colloquial form) is usual. Though grammars of classical Telugu mentionhrasvaanta as the norm in sambodhana form, there are evidences from the lakshyas of classical Telugu writers that the deerghaanta form was prevalent as sambodhana in the spoken form.

  

There are names of poetesses of the Nayaka periodin the forms such as Rangaajee, Krishnaajee etc.

  

Names of Maratha kings have forms such as S'ivaajee, S'ambhaajee, S'ahaajee etc.
