It does, the surname is commonly found in Uttar Pradesh (not in western UP, but in central and more even more so in eastern UP), Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa, and also some parts of Bengal. There are Miśrafamilies settled in parts of Rajasthan too, but they are rare.Apart from Kānyakubja, Maithila, and Utkala Brahmins, the surname is common among Sarayūpārīṇa Brahmins also. For more on the *gotra* and*śākhā*of the Miśra families among Sarayūpārīṇa Brahmins, one may refer Panḍita Rājanārāyaṇa Śāstrī (1998). Sarayūpārīṇa Brāhmaṇa Vaṃśāvalī (11th edition). Varanasi: Master Kheladilal Sankataprasad Sanskrit Library.
