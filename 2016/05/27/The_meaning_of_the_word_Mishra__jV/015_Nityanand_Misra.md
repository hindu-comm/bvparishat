Dear Dr. Bhattacharjya

  

Not ‘may be’, it certainlywasfaulty. The phrase ‘born out of wedlock’ means ‘born of unmarried parents’ as per Concise Oxford English Dictionary (Eleventh Edition, see snapshot). This specific meaning is confirmed by [Merriam Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wedlock), [Collins](http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/born-out-of-wedlock), and [Longman](http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/wedlock) dictionaries. The phrase has to be usedveryselectively and carefully.

  

Now that you have clarified you did not mean ‘born illegitimately’ and your use of the phrase ‘born out of wedlock’ was due to faulty English, I take back my remarks on insensitivity.

  

Still, the claim that those born to Kṣatriya mothers and Brāhmaṇa fathers were called Miśra-s needs to be corroborated. There was actually a Sanskrit term for children born to Kṣatriya mothers and Brāhmaṇa fathers: ‘mūrdhavasikta’ (मूर्धावसिक्त). The term ‘miśra’ is not used in Sanskrit in this sense.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
