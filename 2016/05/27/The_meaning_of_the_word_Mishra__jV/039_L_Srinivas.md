On the honorific aspect of the name or name suffix *miśra,* we have this line, 'āryamiśrāḥ pramāṇam' in the opening lines of Kalidasa's mālavikāgnimitram. Here the writer Sri MR Kale appends a note explicating the use of the plural - pūjye miśrapadaṃ nityaṃ bahuvacanāntam; marīcimiśrairdakṣeṇa iti viṣṇupurāṇāt. This note itself appears to be a quote from the commentary to mālatīmādhavam.  
  
Clearly, *miśra* here appears to be an honorific to the names of certain rather distinguished brahmanas.  
  
My 2c,
