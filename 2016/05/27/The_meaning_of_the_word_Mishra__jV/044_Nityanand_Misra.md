It could be English influence, but even in the eastern languages of Avadhī and Bhojapurī the terminal schwa is elongated in some words. So ‘rāma’ becomes ‘rāmā’, as in the refrain ‘rāmā’ or ‘ho rāmā’ present in every line of a song in the Caitī genre of folk music, e.g. one may listen to Pandit Channulal Mishra’s rendition of “kaise sajana ghara ja’ibe ho rāmā.”
