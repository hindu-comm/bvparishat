This issue of Baalaajee was almost resolved : 1. That it is an arvaacheenanorth Indian usage 2. Most probably a Rajashani usage 3. Most probably a consequence of Hathi ram baba math administration 4. Most probably a word used in the sense of Vallabha or Prabhu in general, in reference to several different deities including Hanuman, here applied to Sri Venkateswara .

  

Now, here in this thread, the focus is on the deerghaanta form of Mishr as Mishraa /Misraa.

  

Trying to see if there are similar forms so that we may arrive at a rule.
