\>Many North Indian names end in "आ", for example Sharma, Varma, Chopra, Mehra, Mehta, Arora, etc. Could this be the reason, words ending in "अ", such as Gupta, Shukla, Mishra,are also "coerced" into similar spelling?

  

---- Yes, that's a great possibility. Better than "coerced", there is a word used in linguistics called "analogy" . Analogy is the reason behind many linguistic changes.
