Namaste

  

The word/name 'Mishra' is known to have existed as early as over a millennium. Vachaspati Mishra, the author of the Bhamati, Mandana Mishra of Brahma siddhi, are two popular ones. In the Dvaita tradition, a much later name, Vanamali Mishra, is also heard. 

  

What is the significance of that name? Does it connote a particular family/sect?

  

I have heard that the name 'Gauda' as it occurs in Gaudapada is that of the region: gauda de≈õa.

  

warm regards
