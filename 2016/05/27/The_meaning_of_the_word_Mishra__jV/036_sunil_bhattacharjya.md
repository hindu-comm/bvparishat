Dear Ajitji,  
  
Thank you for the assurance that I can go ahead with locating the source of the origin of the word. 'Mishra". Kindly bear with me if I take some time to retrieve that source, I wrote what I read about the origin of the word "Mishra", though I did not have the reference ready in hand, with the hope that there wll be many scholars, who might already be aware of it and they may supplement what I wrote.  
  

As advised, I am separately reposting my post in connection with the times of Lord Mahavira.  
  

Regards
