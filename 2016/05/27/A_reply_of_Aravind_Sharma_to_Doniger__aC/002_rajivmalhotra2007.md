The movement against Wendy Doniger got sparked by the "***Risa Lila: Wendy's Child Syndrome***" article some 15 years back. It led to numerous interventions by both sides. Some of the prominent movements in the Hindu diaspora in USA got started as a result of this controversy. Arvind Sharma joined this battle. Soon many other scholars did likewise. S.N. Balagangadhara and various others met at my place in Princeton multiple times for getting themselves involved in this.  
  
The various writings were compiled and summarized in a seminal book, "***Invading the Sacred***" published by Infinity foundation. Arvind Sharma wrote the Preface and Balagangadhara the Foreword. This book is available free as a pdf downloadable at: <http://rajivmalhotra.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Invading-the-Sacred-Final.pdf>  
  
Next a new phase will begin in this fight in July, when the book, ***ACADEMIC HINDUPHOBIA***, is scheduled to be launched by Dr. Subramanian Swamy. Location:: India Int'l Center, Delhi. Date: July 10. Time: 4 pm. For an overview, see: <http://hinduphobia.com/>
