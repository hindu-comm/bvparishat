Wow! What an article! I wish there were thousands and millions among us who could analyse issues with such clarity.  
  

One question that often bothers me is: have the majority among us betrayed our religion by not rising to its grandeur? What should be done to bring back the tradition of the Rishis? If others manage to sell nonsense about Hinduism, it is because we, upon whom lies the responsibility of bursting the balloons, have not raised ourselves to that level.  
  

Good to see that there are Rajiv Malhotras and Arvind Sharmas among us who hold the flag!
