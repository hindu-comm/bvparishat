Respected ShriRN Iyengarji,

  

I need some expert guidance.  

  

What should be the meaning of Kumbhidhanyaka? Is it an alternative for Kusula?

  

Also can you please oblige explaining the second line of the shloka from Unadi Kosha?

  

Is Kramuka a special vessel for keeping Tambula or Betel leaves?

  

Regards.
