Dear friends,  
  
The 32nd century BCE date of Mahabharata war as well as the 19th century BCE date of Lord Buddha are fully backed by the puranic chronology, other textual and astronomical evidences. The date of the Nandas automatcally follows if we give credence to the puranic chronology.  
  
As regards the Chandragupta Maurya, he was a scion of the Nandas by the petrilineal genealogy, even though his mother Mura might not have been from the same varna as that of the Nandas. In fact the Matriarchal lineage has not been generally endorsed / approved in the Puranas. So why should the historians take the Maurya clan as separate and not consider Chandragupta as belonging to the Nandas ?? Any comment?
