*Response*: This is like saying the following: All Vedanta is from the same genealogy. Vallabhacharya is described in Wikipedia as "xyz..."

(The above is a Wiki level view of Benjamin.) 

Therefore, when we want to critique

a major figure from the Vedanta genealogy, it is unimportant to study him specifically. If we know one, we know them all....  

  
This would not be considered a scholarly approach.  
  

Similarly: Generic Marxism simply cannot be applied to frame Pollock, except in a very preliminary stage of analysis. In fact, Pollock is critical of Indian leftist postcolonialists who attack Sanskrit texts in total. He boosted his career by criticizing Orientalism, and thereby he cleared space for his own new methods to enter. He has developed a new/original reason for studying the old Sanskrit texts; his purpose and his approach is based on more recent western theories which he modified for his use. He spends 100s of pages explaining his methods called political philology and liberation philology.  

  
If X = generic marxism and the postcolonial critiques based on it, and if Y = Pollock's theoretical toolkit, it is a major blind spot to say

 that

X = Y. You cannot simply sideline

Pollock's works, and claim to be responding to him by citing generic marxist ideas. (A well-known scholar has recently slipped down this slope by making the assertion that his list of 40 prior Indian thinkers had already critiqued Pollock. Therefore, my entire effort on Pollock is mostly a waste (except for political benefits of spreading awareness). I am still waiting for such scholars to substantiate their assumption that X = Y.)  

  

I also note that most of the criticisms of Pollock appearing on this list are *reactive*. They tend to find flaws in some specific statement of his. They are not proactive, which would require approaching his theoretical framework more broadly first. There is an important need to locate Pollock within western thought

.  
  
I hope Prof Kannan's forthcoming conference to critique Pollock will get into deeper analysis of Pollock and not avoid that hard work by substituting X instead of Y. Otherwise the papers presented there will also be seen as "more of the same things that many persons have already said". It is only worth doing such a conference series on Pollock only if there is something distinct and critical about him which we recognize as important to respond to. A key blockage in many scholars is that they have not yet figured out what this distinction is. Hence they either say we are giving Pollock too much importance, or they feel the latest critiques are merely a restatement of old responses to western Indology.  

  
I am looking forward to Kannan's conference being over, because

it will produce some well-informed scholars on Pollock per se, and we can start some real debates on Pollock.
