This is really a good argumentative evidence that manual scavenging started in modern times only. Indeed, we Indians, especially the 'forward castes' took initiatives to eradicate this inhumane practice in India. Sulabh International is a perfect example. The septuagenarian, Dr. Bindeshwar Pathak (1943-) has led the moment from front, being a 'Brahmin.' He is a modern Rishi. He lived with families of scavengers in connection with his PhD work. Indian government has conferred on him the second highest civilian award. More about him can be had from [here](http://www.sulabhinternational.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/profile-dr-bindeshwar-pathak.pdf).
