It seems manual scavenging existed in India especially in the cities much before the British came. One historical reference could be the martyrdom of the 9th Sikh guru, Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur. When this venerable guru was martyred i.e., in 1675 in Delhi, his head and body were chopped off by order of the Mughal emperor and kept on display outside the *kotwali* (police station of those days) in *Chandni Chowk*. The Sikhs were naturally hurt, worried and concerned for the mortal remains of the Guru. The story goes that the head and the body of the martyred Guru were taken from the site under cover of darkness by members of a certain community of manual scavengers of Delhi and taken to Anandpur Sahib in the Punjab where appropriate funeral rites were administered to the slain Guru by his son, the 10th Guru, Sri Guru Gobind Singh. This community of manual scavengers were proclaimed as brothers by Sri Guru Gobind Singh.  
  
This story should not be that hard to check.  
  
Hope this helps,
