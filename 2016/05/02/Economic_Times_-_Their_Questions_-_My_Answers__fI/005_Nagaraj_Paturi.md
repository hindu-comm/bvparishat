\>ET Magazine followed up with a second round of questions to Kannan, asking, among other things, how he would define manual scavenging, untouchability and other discriminatory practices in the context of his observation that several historians had declared there was no slavery in India. Kannan did not send answers to the follow-up questions.

  

--------- ' there was no slavery in India' is a statement about ancient and medieval history. manual scavenging is a modern time phenomenon. What was the proportion of human inhabited land that had concrete /stone based structures in ancient and medieval India ? How can there be manual scavenging in a country whichin most part of the human inhabitations had open air defecation? When could have the construction of dry toilets started in India?

  

[This article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gong_farmer)on what is called as 'gong farmer' may provide a clue.

  

Was it hereditary there? Watch this

Was Sanskrit there?

  

Sanskrit or no Sanskrit we , as Indians have to condemn all inhuman and discriminatory practices in Indian society and try to eradicate them sooner than later.

  

Blaming Sanskrit does not contribute in any way for such eradication. Practical action does.
