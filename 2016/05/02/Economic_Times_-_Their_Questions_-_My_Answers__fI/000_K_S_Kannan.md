In order that I be not mistaken, I must lay bare the questions raised byKP Narayana Kumar (Asst Editor,ET Magazine,Economic Times)and the answers given by me.

  

I may be permitted to do this as some have hinted at dissatisfaction towards my answers as cited (very selectively, of course) by ET.

  

The questions asked were as follows :

  

Questions :



1.You have pointed out that Pollock’s idea of secularization involves rejecting or side-lining what the tradition refers to as “Paramarthika” or the realm of transcendence. But there is a less discussed context of caste-prejudice to Sanskrit which has caused human rights violations such as untouchability in this country. There is also evidence to prove that Sanskrit and the Vedic culture contributed to laying the foundations of society on unequal terms by conceptualising and assigning an unjust societal structure that differentiated between people by background. Given that the language has been at the centre of the caste-divide which shaped the destiny of millions of people over centuries, is it not important for modern India to explore the language in its political context as well? Your comment please.

  

2\. When you speak of the transcendental aspect of thelanguage, you are suggesting a kind of knowledge that encouragedhumans to be more empathetic, compassionate and other such. This is indeed true as there is much wisdom in the Vedas and India has been recognised as a land of deep spirituality the world over.

But despite this,the Vedic culture also laidrules that encouraged a set of humans to become masters and another set to become slaves of the society. How do you explain the co-existence spirituality and violation of rights? Is it not necessary to investigate the flaws in a particular culture even as we continue to celebrate its richness and depth?



3\. According to census data, less than 15,000 people in India speak Sanskrit. What sort of a role has the ancient caste structure played in restricting the popularity of the language? So is it not the case that segregation imposed during the earlier times, itself is to be blamed for the lack of popularity?  

  

  

4\. Pollock also makes the point about the language which belonged to liturgy in the first place, later also being used to deify royalty. Today when India is a free country, is it not important to understand how language contributed to perpetuating monarchy for centuries, given that there is clear evidence to the effect that Sanskrit was almost a dividing line between the elite class and commoners?



5\.   Despite the celebration of science in the Vedic culture, it is clear that almost all technology used today in India – from mobile phones to computers to printing press to healthcare to all modes of transport – were all invented in the West in more recent centuries. Does this not second Prof Sheldon’s take (Theory of Practice) that excessive reliance of the Vedas came in the way of practical examination and therefore curbed scientific experimentation here. I refer to hospitals, transport systems, defence technology - all of which was invented in the West. Surely the work of Edison, Wright Brothers and Bill Gates, for instance, has an as significant, if not, greater impact on daily life in today’s India ? Your comment please.

  

And the answers I gave were as follows :

  

**Q1 & 2.**

**  
**

The issue of human rights violations has reared its head only in recent times, and being used primarily to target certain communities specifically, and not universally/uniformly.  
  
While slavery was prevalent in many parts of the world, many historians have declared that there was no slavery worth the name in India.  
  
The West with its major human rights violations has exported this discourse to Indians but it does not practice this at home when it comes to blacks or overseas when it invades other nations. The devastation brought by Russian communism cannot be attributed to the Russian language.  

  

Because of the divide between sacred and king realms, whatever any text might have said did not in all cases have any state sanction. One cannot conflate text ==> political oppression. For instance, the Buddha did not explicitly attack any socialsystem, not even in his private dialogues.  
  
Also, note that just because many terrorists have Arabian affiliations, you cannot blame the Arabic language. If you want to attribute bad things to Sanskrit, then you must also attribute India's wealth and material advancement in certain periods to Sanskrit.  

  

**Q3.**

Less than 5 % of the Indian population today speak English, and it is the English-speaking elite (IAS officers/judges etc) that devise laws or implement them. Which*novel and**current*caste system has effected this segregationary tactic - to keep the masses under thraldom and subjugation? English should then be accused of all sorts of social problems in India as per your logic. In the past century at least the political discourse in India has not been determined by Sanskrit language media or politics, or IAS, etc.  

  

**Q4.**

Monarchy prevailed in most parts of the world till a few centuries ago; so you subscribe perhaps to the theory that says Sanskrit was universally spoken. Some Arab countries have monarchy even now, so you suspect the hand of Sanskrit even there. You perhaps also suspect that all reigns in all countries that advocated the dictum that "the king can do no wrong, " were all vitiated by their Sanskrit heritage; which other language can uphold such ideas, after all? In other words, let us apply the same criteria to all nations at a given time. In fact Pollock says that all ancient languages and cultures have similar issues.  

  

**Q5.**

Yoga and Ayurveda were invented millennia ago in India, and are a multi-million dollar business today. Their focus is health care, which includes spiritual health. They can handle many modern ailments also - despite Pollock's verdict that Shastras destroy creativity.  

  

For example, please note: Laplace was all appreciation for the Indian discovery of zero/the decimal system; even the binary system, for that matter - without which there would have been no computers or mobiles - was an Indian contribution; ask van Nooten. Ask Manjul Bhargav on where originated the Fibonacci numbers.
