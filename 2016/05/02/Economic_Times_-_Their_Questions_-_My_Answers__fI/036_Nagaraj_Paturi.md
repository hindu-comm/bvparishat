\> I would like to read some of your published debates on this issue. Please post links to them. Thanks.

  

------- I did not mention any of my published debates on this issue anywhere in this thread.

  

Since you highlighted my statement "But I have decades of experience in being in the thick of these debates from inside the university system.",your presentmessage seems to be in response to this statement of mine. Please let me clarify this:

  

I entered the University system in1984 as a post-graduate student, in 1986 as a research student in a School of Humanities and Social Sciences of a university dominated byMarxismin full swing,with post-modernism in just an entering stage into that university at that point.Given my disposition, anyone can imagine how I would have felt and responded to the regular and continuous attacks on all those aspects that I love.I was and am known,,for never keeping silent, in spite of being alone in my ideological position,during thoseregular academic activities like seminars, conferences, symposiums etc.,enjoyable for their rigour, unacceptableon account of being contrary to mystand.This situation compelled me tolearn the knowledge of the other side as rigorously as possible. I enjoyed these efforts of mine for the value they were adding to my understandingand the success they gave me incritiquing the other side meaningfully andin making the other sideadmit their flaws. During the later years,I have been watching post-modernism, cultural studies etc. replacing Marxism in its significance. By then, Iassumed teaching responsibilities and as is natural, updating my knowledge with all these new developments was part of my life. My study area and my jobinvolving research project collaborations was always in closeinteraction with activist-academicians from various ideologies such as extremist Marxism, Dalitism, Feminism, poltical theatre groups, community theatre groups etc.But I took care that my official teaching, researching and Telugu and English publishing , paper presentingcareer was not narrowed down to and wentmuch beyond these debating participationswhichhave always been there with me asone of the activities. I am happy to see thatall my academic output however little or big,regional or global it is,generated many newsignificant understandingsabout traditional Indian knowledge systems, cultural forms, works of classical Indian literature etc.(Academia.edu may provide an overview)Ihave been alyric-writer for classical dance, TV and Radio discussant, public speaker etc. In everyone of these activities, I always tried to contribute to these aspects in different ways. This is not the right forum or occasion to provide a self-evaluation or self-audit ofmy academic contributions.

  

Hope this clarifies my statement "But I have decades of experience in being in the thick of these debates from inside the university system" which has no claimsof my publications on this issue. 

  

Just to tell you, how much I really meant to say, "I am all admiration for you for the amount of understanding youacquired about all these nuances ofcontemporary university-centred academic debates, in spite of being from outside that system.", wholeheartedly,let me tell you that I agreed to join Sri Nityanandjiin writing a piece on your understanding ofmethods and your own methods-kit.

  

I had to respondwhen you said I was ''avoiding that hard work by substituting X instead of Y"

  

Appreciating each other from our own contexts may contribute for greater co-operation amongst us in those efforts that have a common cause.

  

I apologisefor this long post.

  

Thanks for your patience.

  

Regards,

  

Nagaraj
