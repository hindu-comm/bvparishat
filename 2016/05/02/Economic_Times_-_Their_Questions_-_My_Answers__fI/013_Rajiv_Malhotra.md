Pollock's LOG book cites dozens of examples of prashasti writing to glorify kings. He claims that this was the earliest form of Sanskrit writing. The primary use of writing kavya was to facilitate royal power, he insists. There is an implied brahmin-kshatriya conspiracy theory here: Kshatriyas sponsored brahmins, and brahmins wrote prashastis and kavya that glorified the royalty in the eyes of the public. The brahnmins also taught the royalty enough sanskrit and kavya to make them appear learned and sophisticated. This was a brahmin-kshatriya franchise system (my term) which spread across south asia and then to southeast asia.  
  
TBFS summarizes his view and gives my response. His logic is convoluted and his writing style jargon ridden. But once you decode it, there is a definite thesis he has; it is a subversive one and I strongly disagree with it.
