Prof. Prasad ,

  

The logic is simple and straight. Irrespective of whether open defecation is good or bad, manual scavenging can not co-exist with open defecation.

  

Manual scavenging is a consequence of British style urban toilets.Indian manual scavengers newly emerged during the British rule asIndiancounterparts of the British 'gong farmers'. Whoever takes the credit of modern urbanization of India and introduction of British style urban toilets has to take the credit for the emergence of manual scavenging also.

  

We can not blame the British for the emergence of their own 'gong farmers' or our manual scavengers because these inhuman professions are consequence of urban sanitation in the absence of the new technology of flush toilets.

  

But the point is , one can not blame a country for having huge percentage of human inhabitation having open defecation and a huge prevalence of manual scavenging at the same time.

  

History of British style sanitation is as follows (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2763662/>):

  

The history of sanitary work in British India began with the reports of the Royal Commission of 1859. The commission reported in 1863 on the sanitary conditions of the Army. The mortality rate among British troops was 69 per 1000.([2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2763662/#CIT2)) The commission recommended the establishment of a Commission of Public Health in each presidency and pointed out the need to improve sanitation and prevention of epidemics in civil society for improving the health of the British Army. Under the Military Cantonments Act of 1864, a sanitary police force was formed under the charge of military medical officers to improve military hygiene. To improve civil sanitary conditions, sanitary boards were formed in each province in 1864. Sanitary Inspector Generals later named as Sanitary Commissioners replaced these boards and took over the charge of sanitation. In 1870, the sanitary department was merged with the vaccination department to form a central sanitary department. From 1870 to 1879, sanitary departments were set up in each province. Under the orders of the Governor General of India in 1880, Sanitary Engineers were employed in all major provinces. The Sanitary Commissioner of India and the provincial sanitary commissioners had no executive powers and were advisors to the government. They carried out the inspection of sanitation, the supervision of vaccinations, the maintenance of vital statistics, and the collection of meteorological data. In districts, civil surgeons (Districts Medical and Sanitary Officers in Madras and Deputy Sanitary Commissioners in Bombay) were in charge of sanitation. The local self-government policies of Lord Ripon strengthened the efforts to improve sanitation by increasing the availability of funds at the local level. In 1885, the Local Self-Government act was passed and local bodies came into existence. These were now responsible for sanitation at the local level but the necessary staff was not provided by the Central Government. In 1912, the Government of India sanctioned the appointment of Deputy Sanitary Commissioners and Health Officers with the local bodies and released funds for sanitation.

  

Sharing the history of Indian urbanization pdf. That, in the places and times without flush toilets, is the history of growth in manual scavenging in India.
