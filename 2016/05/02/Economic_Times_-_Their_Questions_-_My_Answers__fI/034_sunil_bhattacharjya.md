Dear Prof. Paturiji,  
  

I do not claim to be fully conversant with the ideas of Karl Marx, yet from whatever I read about him long ago gave me an impression that what Karl Marx stood for early in his life was substantially different from what he endorsed late in his lfe. So it appears to me that just saying Marxism may not really mean anything unless that is qualified in some way to indicate at what stage of his life what he said. Kindly correct me if I am wrong. Rajivji may also say if he would like to.  

  

Regards,
