Dear Kannan sir,

Your answers are sharp and apt. They make lot of sense. Above all, the whole tone, texture and thought on which these questions are framed is very biased and provocative to say the least. I don't see any sort of honesty or humility to understand behind these typical journalistic probes.

Regards

Ganesh
