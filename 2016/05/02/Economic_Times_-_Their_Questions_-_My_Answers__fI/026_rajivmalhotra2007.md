I would like to come to Prof Kannan's defense on his response to ET journo. He acted perfectly reasonably under the circumstances, and here is why.  
  
I was the one initially approached by the journalist from ET. But after my first round of response (most of which he ignored), I realized he was on a witch hunt, wanting to argue with too many biases. His mind was already made up. I was about to leave for a trip, and ET was in a big hurry to cover complex issues in simplistic ways. So I thought it was better to bring in Prof Kannan, especially given his forthcoming conference of Pollock's works. This is when I introduced the ET journalist and Prof Kannan, and Kannan took over the discussion with the journalist. Frankly, the journalist was in a great hurry to try and "prove" his case. He was not at all open minded, but had learned the Pollock camp's positions, and that is what he wanted to go with.  
  
Kannan and I were not alone in this ET matter. Former chief election commissioner, N. Gopalaswami, is also a member of my discussion list. The list has been actively discussing all the media/academic developments on this Pollock related controversy. Shri Gopaswami wrote in my discussion list the following experience with ET's journalist: "***I was asked questions for more than half an hour, and 4,5 lines were written about that. but I tried to convey the same -that English and Spanish Latin etc had nothing to do with but the English and Europeans were brutal to indigenous communities in the Americas. But these writers come with an agenda - foot soldiers of SP - and they won't reflect all your views but what is not inconvenient to them.***"  
  
So Prof Kannan and I are not alone in facing this treatment. This is how our media works.
