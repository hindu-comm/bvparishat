This cultural studies/ post-modernstuff is from the same Marxian genealogy only. Benjamin is described as 'an eclectic thinker, combining elements of German idealism, Romanticism, Western Marxism, and Jewish mysticism'. For anyone, who studied these 'isms' , it sounds weird because the irreconcilable fundamental differences among them.

  

\>Pollock rules out religious evangelism as the driving force in this conspiracy theory.

  

------ I did not say that Marxist conspiracy theorylooks at the priestly class- ruling class nexus as evangelical. For the Marxists, it is statusquoist, counter-revolutionary and pre-emptive of people's revolt.

  

BTW, genealogy is the favourite epithet of the fans of post-modern Foucault.

  

I brought Marxist linkinto discussion so that Indian audience may quickly get connected with something that they are familiar with.

.

Whether it is Marxism or its descendent, cultural studies/post-modernism, the pointhere is that the approach is not inductionist (Facts to theory), it is deductionist , i.e.deducethe facts from the theory you already have on hand.For example, you already know that monarchy is bad, kings are bad, exploitative etc. How do you know? - What else can they be? The just system is rule by the proletariat, no private property etc Everything else has to be unjust. Or else, from a non-Marxist pro-democracy point of view, monarchy is wrong because it is not democracy. Democracy is something that can naturally survive. If anything else like monarchy has survived, it needs explanation. There has to be some culprit that helped such a wrong /unnaturalentityto survive. In this case, the culprit found is Sanskrit. The poets writing praises of kings are wrong because they should have known that kings are bad, kings are exploitative all because theyare kings, monarchy is bad because it is not democracy etc. Sanskrit is wrong because they used that language in sustaining a system that is wrong because it is not the system I have or I would like to have.-- This is the logic.
