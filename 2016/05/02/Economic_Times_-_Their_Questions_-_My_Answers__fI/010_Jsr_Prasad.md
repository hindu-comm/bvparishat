Respected Prof. Aklujkar Ji,  
  
Namaste. Thanks for this inquiry which motivated me to look further. Please permit me to submit the following opinion:  
  
Question: Practice of manual scavenging is modern or ancient practice? Is it linked to caste system in India?  
  
I shall only supplement what has been already referred to by Prof. Paturi Ji. Please afford me for a moment as the following may look a bit deviated from context:  
  
As philosophers, we know that man is the outcome of the conglomeration of five gross elements and he lives on the things made up of these five elements, Ex: 'सर्वं द्रव्यं पाञ्चभौतिकमाह ।' So, the gross elements are the principle elements of all life forms. Chandogyopanishad says – एषां भूतानां पृथिवी रसः । पृथिव्या आपो रसः । अपामोषधयो रसः । ओषधीनां पुरुषो रसः । and so on. As we know, 'oshadhi' means all herbs, including pulses, food grains and cereals.  
  
Man has to plough and till the land and do agriculture in order to sustain his life based on above plant products. Animals also dependent on plants unless they are 'carnivorus/omnivorus.' Since ancient times, Indian society has been agrarian and irrespective of caste everyone was directly or indirectly involved in agronomy. Hence, Kautilya emphatically referred to 'वार्ता' (1. agriculture 2. cattle breeding and 3. trade) as one of the विद्याs, that one has to undergo.  
  
For sustainable crop growth and health of the soil, organic manures were needed. Good amount of this was being obtained from the dung and urine of cows/buffaloes. They were directly led to the fields where
composting use to take place. Man has also contributed to this traditional process.  
  
All these equally exist in internal and external world. Any variation in the above ratio would lead to 'diseases' in human body and 'disasters' in the ecosystems.  
  
People use to get themselves relieved from nature calls, at these vast agricultural lands. They did not construct toilets at their homes. All the faecal matter and urine of the human and animals becomes an excellent organic manure, as they contain nitrogen (N⁷).  
  
For a while, if we look at the modern equivalents of five gross elements (which I learnt from Ayurvedic scholars) –  
  
पृथ्वी is carbon  
आपस् is hydrogen  
तेजस् is oxygen and  
वायु is nitrogen  
  
Invariably, role of nitrogen in crop production is highly significant. With the help of sun light and moisture, earthworms and other insects contribute to the composting process, which was just perfect and enough for the plant growth. Furthermore, it is also ensured that ancient/medieval Indians did not use any chemical fertilizers to boost the crop yield.  
  
However, this story belongs to pre-industrialization era. When machines replaced the ancient tools and techniques, when inorganic material replaced the organic products, we started to live in an artificial world. After all, man's greed is the prime reason behind such so-called material 'progress.'  
  
अस्तु प्रकृतमनुसरामि...  
  
When we abandoned using human waste for manuring purposes, and started to use rivers, ponds, canals and other small streams exclusively for lavatory purposes, some good techniques of agriculture become disappeared suddenly. Due to which, all the waters become contaminated by harmful bacteria, besides contributions by industrial pollution. Faeces mixed in water, cause diseases like jaundice. Godavari water is a good example of industrial pollution as sugar cane factories contribute to such contaminations. Rivers Ganga and Yamuna are perfect victims to modern industrialization. Sunlight cannot help us here because, polluting matter is not in a carbon state.  
  
Ultimately, value of agriculture lost its importance in our holy land, which was used to be called 'अन्नपूर्णा.'  
  
As rightly pointed by Prof. Paturi, sewage systems and flush toilets are the modern invention in 19th century. In addition to this, as the forwarded link states - “*The earliest written reference to the disposal of human waste is more than 3600 years old and is found in The Holy Bible. "And you shall have an implement among your equipment, and when you sit down outside, you shall dig with it and cover your refuse . . . " For hundreds of thousands of years before the bible was written, human beings simply squatted when they had the urge to relieve themselves*.”  
  
A small animal like cat, does the same act as stated above in the Bible.  
  
Because of the effects of modernization -  
  
a) the whole world become a concrete jungle  
b) we have gradually abolished using human excreta contributing to crop growth  
c) colonization brought so many foreign influences, including constructing toilets at our homes  
  
One way, it can be construed that, had not we abandoned the practice of using human excreta in agriculture, Mahatma Gandhi would not have said as following - “*No one should clean and carry human manure of others just to earn one's livelihood. There must be some scientific method of human waste disposal*.”  
  
Centre for Innovation in Public Systems (<http://www.cips.org.in>) is working on a project on 'Eco-Sanitation.' They started to bring back the ancient techniques and training rural folk, accordingly. As per their [report](http://www.cips.org.in/documents/2014/UPAAM_Workshop/Smt._Santha_Sheela_Nair.pdf) -  
  
- in the World, about 2.5 billion people living without toilets, one - third of them in India.  
- of the 1.1 billion people practicing open defecation throughout the world, almost 60% are Indian.  
  
After the British robbed us off from our land, they deliberately labelled some people as 'shudras' or lower castes. So, the invaders ordained some of them, to do manual scavenging. Indeed, the caste system like AIT, is a British 'contribution' in the annals of Indian history.  
  
So, which way Sanskrit literature is connected to casteism, manual scavenging and bonded labour? Should 'अजापुत्रं बलिं दद्यात् देवो दुर्बलघातकः' be the buzzword in connection with the plight of Sanskrit.  
  

Apologies for a long discussion.  
  

Regards,  

Prasad
