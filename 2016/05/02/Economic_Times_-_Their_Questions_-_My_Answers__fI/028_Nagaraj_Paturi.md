\> One historical reference could be the martyrdom of the 9th Sikh guru, Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur.

  

----- Since you say 'historical', not legendary, let me take you to a historian's write-up the 'martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadur'

Since this article was published in the context of an NCERT text book controversy and on account of other content in the article, there is a scope for digression. I request for no digression. My focus is only on his statement on the availability of historical sources:

  

"For the historians, difficulties have been created because the execution of Guru Tegh Bahadur in Delhi in 1675 is not mentioned in any of the contemporary Persian sources. Nor are there any Sikh contemporary accounts, those written towards the end of the 18th century depending on \`\`the testimony of trustworthy Sikhs''. They are, therefore, often conflicting. "
