Good one. I agree about the nature of the that kind of history writing. But the point here is , his point about the availability of historical sources about this issue.

  

My hunch is that if there is a reference to 'manual scavengers' in the legend that you received, the word usedPunjabi or Hindi, may have a meaning of a person of sanitation/cleaning occupation in general also.
