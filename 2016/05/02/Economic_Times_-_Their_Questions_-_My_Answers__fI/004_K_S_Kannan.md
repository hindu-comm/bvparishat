The words of Prof Jha and Shatavadhani Ganesh give a boost to the confidence of scholars on our side.

  

There is strength in collective wisdom: If our scholars have not given befitting replies, it is up to the more knowledgeable scholars to throw hints at more valid points, and thereby strengthen our side.

  

**A paritos"Ad vidus"Am ...** to use the words of Kalidasa.  

  

Thanks both for their kind words.
