Dear Sri Rajivji,



This is specifically in response to your message below in which you characterized my post mentioning Benjamin as a result of 'avoiding that hard work by substituting X instead of Y'



Your response begins by quoting my words.

Benjamin is described as 'an eclectic thinker, > combining elements of German idealism, Romanticism, Western Marxism, > and Jewish mysticism'. For anyone, who studied these 'isms' , it > sounds weird because the irreconcilable fundamental differences among > them. >

This quote clearly has my words 'Benjamin is described as ' , which clearly show that it is not I who was calling Benjamin 'an eclectic thinker, combining elements of German idealism, Romanticism, Western Marxism, and Jewish mysticism'. I also said, "For anyone, who studied these 'isms' , it sounds weird because the irreconcilable fundamental differences among them." What sounds weird? Someone being described as
'an eclectic thinker, combining elements of German idealism, Romanticism, Western Marxism, and Jewish mysticism'. Why? Because anyone, who studied these 'isms' , knows 'the irreconcilable fundamental differences among them.'

If it is a wiki level understanding of Benjamin, themixing of the unmixable, must be lying with the contributor to the wiki, not with Benjamin. You seem to believe either that Benjamin's thought not eclictic or that in his eclictic mix, these are not the component 'isms'.

I , along with the other members of the list, would have been benefitted by your more complex but brief introduction to Benjamin's thought showing how and where the wiki level understanding went wrong.



You also said,

If I were to discuss Vallabhacharya vis-à-vis , say, Sankaracharya, yes, the details of Vallabhacharya's specific school of Vedanta stand as significant. But if I were to discuss Vallabhacharya's criticism of a non-Vedanta school of thought, basing his criticism on the common bases of Vedanta, then I need not go into such details. I can just say, the point on which Vallabhacharya is basing his argument is common to all schools of Vedanta.

  

Sri Rajivji,I am all admiration for you for the amount of understanding youacquired about all these nuances ofcontemporary university-centred academic debates, in spite of being from outside that system. But I have decades of experience in being in the thick of these debates from inside the university system. I am with you in asking for rigour. But my working in Cultural Studies, probably, helped me to see these debates from the perspective of the general zealots of these knowledge areas from outside the system too. My father being a traditional Sanskrit scholar, (a colossal one in that) helped me see how it feels to them when you ask them to shift into these language games.

  

I believe that it is necessary today, to make lay audience understand how and why all these different strands 'left' intellectuals can join hands with each other. For that to show their points of agreement helps more than showing their points of disagreement.
