Dear Dr. Prasad,  
  
You have taken much trouble for me. The reference of “This” in your words “This is really a good argumentative evidence …” was not clear to me. I thought you had textual evidence in mind and was expecting you to cite a text or texts that spoke of scavenging for the first time or at an early time — gave us a means of deciding, at least tentatively, when the practice of scavenging began. Sorry for the misunderstanding.  
  
Having spent early years of my life in a village, I am familiar with the practice of using the fields for answering calls of nature and am aware of its merits (except when an epidemic spreads) as well as of the reluctance Indian city-dwellers have in following the practice. At least until the early 1970s, I found North Americans very uptight in indulging in it (unless they had gone camping). The Europeans were relatively relaxed about it at least in the case of children.  
  
Can we be reasonably sure that there is no reference to scavenging in pre-colonial Indian texts?  
  
By the way, some years back I made this note: Kalhaṇa’s Rāja-taraṅgiṇI 4.573 has the word pāyu-kṣālana-veśma.  
  
a.a.
