\>4.On Monarchy:



Three points are made by the interviewer here:



1.Prof Pollock records several instances of Sanskrit being used to glorify Kings in INDIA (Language of Gods)



2. The kings used Sanskrit to take advantage of the reverence people had for Sanskrit, though the people did not understand that language.



3.And if that system relied on the language that commanded a spiritual connect toperpetuateitself, .is it not important to ask whether this was ethical ?



-------- This argument is typically Marxist , irrespective of whether the interviewer is aware of the Marxistgenealogy of this argument. It all started with the Marx's analysis of the relation between the priestly class and the royalty in the older Europe and between the Church and the State in later Europe. As per the historically deterministic Marxist theory, individuals are just helpless in the hands of history, history is bound to set things back to the right order, i.e.protocommunism that existed during the beginning of history. As per this, the natural course of events is that the poor, the common people should have revolted against the rich and the ruling class. To the question of why such a natural course of events did not take place, the answer given in that philosophy is that the priestly class and the ruling class colluded with each other, time to time, praising each other, removing the anti-king ideas from the minds of the poor. The supporting evidences were given from European history to this theorization. Indian Marxists tried to understand what this means in terms of Indian history. They replaced the priestly class of Europe and the European church with Brahmins and the European state and European kings with Indian kings and published Marxist histories of India. In the timeline, Prof. Pollock’s books come only after these Indian Marxist writings. During the cold war days , Marxism was a joke in American discussions. As a result, there were rigorous history writings in US, without any tinge of Marxist presumptions. If an Indologist brought the Marxist interpretation of Indian history into American Indology, it could appear to be a fresh new outlook. Prof. Pollock’s theories of Kavyas as glorifications of Kings was quotidian in Indian academics due to the domination of Marxists in Indian academics, but were fresh and new to American Indology.



Leaving aside this Marxist geneology of this theory, let us examine its veracity: Which Kavyas glorified which kings? Did the Sanskrit poets glorify their patron kings ? On the one hand, it is said that Sanskrit poets did not provide enough historical information about their patron etc. causing difficulties of historical research about them. At the same time it is said that they glorified their kings. How can these two go together.

  

(examination of veracity to continue)
