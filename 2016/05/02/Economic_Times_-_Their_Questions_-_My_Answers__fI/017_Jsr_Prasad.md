Dear Sir,  
  

I should not have used the work 'evidence' which was written in haste. Its my fault, pardon me. Your quite interesting reference to '*pāyu-kṣālana-veśma*' in Rajatarangini is thought provoking. I think, if the very word refers to a toilet with built in sewage system, it does mean, at least in the 12th century ancient Indians had invented it, six centuries before the British did it.  
  

Now, there could be a new thinking in these lines.  
  

Regards,  

Prasad
