Dear Sri Rajivji,

  

1.These multiple threads on ET related matters are not a critique of Prof. Pollock. They are a discussion of the questions put to Prof. Kannan by the interviewer from ET.

  

2\. Prof. Pollock's name may appear occasionally in these threads as the interviewer mentioned his name.

  

3\. Since we are discussing the words of the journalist who might or might not be aware of the toolkit of Prof. Pollock, we need not go all the way up to that.

  

4\. I started my posts by saying I was responding to the message from Prof. Kannanto the list members to provide responses to the questions put to him.

  

5\. The article says thatyou directed the journalist to Prof. Kannan. After reading yourposts in these threads, one gets an impression that you could have simply responded to the journalist bysaying thatall these questions are already answers in such and such pages of TBFS.

  

6\. I did not want to assume that the journalist was basing his questions on the theory of anesthetization of power because there was no evidence for such awareness in his questions.
