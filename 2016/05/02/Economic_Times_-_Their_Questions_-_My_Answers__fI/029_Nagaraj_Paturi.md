\> I would like to come to Prof Kannan's defense on his response to ET journo. He acted perfectly reasonably under the circumstances, and here is why.

  

-------- Since this post followed my post, though I am not sure if it was a response to my post, let me clarify that my post did not createa need for Sri Rajivjicoming in defense of Prof. Kannanon his response to ET journo. I never indicated that he did not act reasonably in that context. I too thought that he acted perfectly reasonably under the circumstances.

  

This is not in objection to Sri Rajivji explaining the circumstances. I wanted just to clarify my position.
