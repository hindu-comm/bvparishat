Dear Prof. Jha

  

Given the questions of the Asst Editor at ET and the selectively quoted responses of Prof. Kannan, I wonder if the folks covering this topic at ET are interested in publishing from the perspective of our intellectual tradition (Anvaya, Vyatireka, etc). Perhaps journals like Swarajyamag will publish it without much edits.Recently Deccan Chronicle and Asian Age did a full-page feature on Prof. Vamsee Juluri, and the journalists who did that may be contacted (if Prof. Juluri can be heard from San Francisco, I am sure you can be heard from Pune).Or maybe journalists like Rupa Subramanya or Sadananda Dhume can do better justice in putting forward this perspective. There are journalists and platforms who will publish, they need to be reached.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
