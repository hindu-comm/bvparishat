Since I was approached by ET for an interview, I would like to explain some facts that are not public on what transpired.  
  
The tone of the questions I got was already biased. Imagine someone asking along the following lines: 'We know Indian civilization is oppressive and the question is to have you verify this, unless you can change our mind.' In other words, the starting point is not neutral and open minded. Since I have gone through a large number of media interviews (the one cited in "Inside Higher Ed" article was another recent example), I have become cautious. It is better to avoid being misquoted, when one detects a preconceived bias.  
  
Below is my position on the specific item concerning Pollock that he asked me about. *This position of mine has not come across in the article*. Partly I take responsibility: I did not want to go on fighting the journalist due to my own personal commitments elsewhere at this time. Here is what I have to say:  
  
Pollock's grand sweep of the history of sanskrit includes the following distinct stages/phases or epochs. He insists that these dont overlap, and they are separated by major events that cause disruptions. His main claims include the following:

  

1\) sanskrit had always been EXCLUSIVELY used for rituals/liturgy only and there was NO OTHER USE. It was banned for shudras and women. It was strictly oral and never written.

  

2\) buddhism caused a major disruption. Buddhists started writing in sanskrit which others had never done. Buddhists wanted to disrupt the abusive vedic social structure and open the discourse to everyone.

  

3\) In response to the buddhist attack on them, the vedic brahmins wanted to be competitive w buddhists, so they were forced to start writing the sanskrit. It was no longer possible to keep it secret from the masses as a way to oppress.

  

4\) the first writing in sanskrit by Vedic brahmins was valmiki's ramayana. This was king sponsored. The Ramayana has served as a narrative of royal power over people. It served the purpose of maintaining royal power over enemies because kings saw themselves as Rama and told their citizens to see their enemies as Ravana.

  

5\) sanskrit spread across many kingdoms because it served the king's interest to oppress and control the masses. Brahmins conspired with kings by supplying them with specific sanskrit kavya, training them on how to use it and constantly praising the kings in front of the public.

  

My response: Each of the above is filled with assumptions that are refuted by important scholars. For example scholars make the following counter claims:  

-   The ban on shudras/women access to sanskrit was not as claimed -
    Arvind Sharma's book "Hindu Egalitarianism" gives lots of evidence -   Sanskrit writing was not necessarily started by buddhists - evidence
    unclear either way  
-   Sanskrit was not limited to spiritual uses only and had many other
    kinds of shastraa and other texts -   The chronology of pollock is false, that all works other than Vedas
    belong to a period after Buddha. He manipulates dates to fit into
    his own theory of cause and effect of the historical developments. -   Ramayana was not post buddha and nor was it influenced by buddhist
    texts.  
-   The post-buddha spread of sanskrit cannot be explained as strictly
    due to kings wanting to use it for their oppression and power. There
    were many texts with no political purpose or agenda.

The existence of sacred texts in sanskrit is no different than the existence of religious texts in latin and arabic. Similarly the use of sanskrit to produce political works is similar to the political usages of latin/arabic. In other words the thesis he has on sanskrit could also be applied to all other old languages.  
  
These statement of mine make sense when one knows the questions I was being asked.  
  
Overall reaction to article in ET: A highly manipulative but subtle job, giving the false impression of being balanced. However, every mention of my book and the controversies it has sparked is playing into our hands exactly the way we want. The goal has been to generate more views and more scholarship from various sides. Watch out for Prof Kannan's conference series and some others things in the pipeline. This will wake up many good scholars on our side and the discourse is headed for more churning.
