From the outset, we must keep in mind that the article is nothing more than , what commonly referred to as , in the

journalist's world, a, "who said what" article. The second important point is that it is a Times Group publication, which is being extensively and intensively classified under,the category of "prestitutes". The third issue of importance is that, if you are taking most, if not all, the main stream media in India, for example Times of India, The Hindu,Economic and Political Weekly. etc etc.the question of who owns and what has been their inclination. These issues give us enough basis to decide for our own self,what to read, how to read and to what extent to trust the "ethics" of the publication.

  

In the light of the above,the article is a "who said what" article in which the most effective weapon in the hands of the journalist remains ,"whom and what to include and whom and what to exclude". The article begins with a title which has two parts, "Sheldon Pollock offers scholarly opinion on Sanskrit" and "a language that the government seems keen to massify".

  

The learned editor quotes hardly a paragraph, on behalf of the first and the prominent part of the title, on what Prof. Pollock's Scholarly opinion offers, without really saying anything about the fundamental hypotheses, not to teach but to give any scientific support, on which the learned Prof. has based his opinion and without giving almost any information about the "Grand Strategy" of "Cosmopolis"and on his being "Philologically Selective".

  

Interestingly the article narrates at length a film maker to criticize how the decision to change name of GurGaon is illogical which has

nothing to do with Pollock's opinion, but used as a thread to criticize Sanskrit, its countable users in India and hence Government

policy.The journalist selects S Chandramohan, one of India's young Dalit poets who writes in English, to criticise Sanskrit

and praise English as behind ever success...May I ask percent of people who speak English in entire Europe, (excluding Britain) and how many speak original British English in United States?

  

Then comes, at length, Ananya Vajpai, a disciple of Pollock, in reference to Indian Civilization,Vedic parmarthika and

its ill effects which eliminated the scientific culture and development in pre-medieval India. This is a hit on the very being of

our traditional Sanskrit scholars who purportedly own the tradition as they are being alleged to destroy scientific temper of India and they seem to be silent.

  

The journalist then selects a few to counter the above with this or that example. Then regrets for not receiving a reply from prof. Kannan,

who has informed in this thread of short notice and time shortage.

  

So nothing to worry. When "Money" is taught to economics students for the first time, the famous monetarist's controversy (in US),

is introduced as, "Money matters vs Money does not matter". In the same way, here Pollock matters( to some) and does not

matter(to others).Knowingly or unknowingly we are on a double edge sword.

On one hand , thanks to Mr. Rajiv Malhotra, for igniting the fire which is certainly going to agitate, with added efforts of Prof kannan and others, at least a part of Indians. On the other hand we are making famous Pollock's conclusions and the Classical Library and unless a competing alternative comes up from Indian scholars and from India itself,they are going to dominate the media and succeed in their propaganda under the cover up of "cosmopolis".It is time to be creative and put forward the alternative which is scientifically capable enough to replace Prof. Pollock's opinion and conclusion, in true sense of scholarship.
