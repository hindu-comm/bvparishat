One of the axioms of human studies is that languages or texts written using them do not create -or not the origins of- social, cultural or other such realities of human life. They try to understand/grapple with those realities. Some of them, though turn out to be not so effective at the end of the day, try to exert influence onthose realities.

  

So to say that Sanskrit language or texts written in that language created any social or cultural reality such as caste system betrays lack ofunderstanding of such axioms of human studies.

  

Apart from this even a common write up such as a Wikipedia article on Varna (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varna_(Hinduism)>) cautions, "This quadruple division is an ancient stratification of society is not to be confused with the much more nuanced *jati* or caste"

  

What Sanskrit texts reflect, discuss etc. is Varna system , not caste system. We can also say that Varna is textual and caste is real in India, though there is also an influence of vocabulary of Varna in the talks about and labels of a miniscule section of castes such as Brahmins.

  

Even AnulomaViloma discussions in the Sanskrit texts are not related to castes at all.

  

Some Indian historians discussed the label sachchudras mentioned in some historical documents as an attempt to accommodate certain castes, members of which ascended to royal throne, within the Varna paradigm that has been the legacy of the Sanskrit texts. This is an example of how texts try to grapple with the reality that does not suit theframeworks through which those texts operate.

  

So to talk of "clarity on the connection between Sanskrit and caste-discrimination" that is allegedly provided by Prof. Pollock's research betrays a lack of such nuanced understanding of Sanskrit and Indian social system.
