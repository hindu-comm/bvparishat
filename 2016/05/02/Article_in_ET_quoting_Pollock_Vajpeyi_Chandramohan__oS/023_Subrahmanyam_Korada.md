नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

The following may be useful to counter the ' scholar ' --

  

1\. he is called a 'scholar ' - according to Indian Tradition if one has studied पदवाक्यप्रमाणशास्त्राणि ( व्याकरणम् , मीमांसा and न्यायवैशेषिके ) then only he is considered a विद्वान् / पण्डित and he will be eligible do discuss big and small issues . The one who is doing Research is also called a Scholar !

  

2\. The first point is - are the quotations really authoritative ? Patanjali (in पस्पशाह्निकम् , महाभाष्यम् ) cautions about the authority of any given text -

  

क्व पुनरिदं पठितम् ? भ्राजा नाम श्लोकाः । किंच भोः श्लोका अपि प्रमाणम् ? किंचातः ? यदि प्रमाणम् , अयमपि प्रमाणम् भवितुम् अर्हति ..... प्रमत्तगीत एष तत्रभवतः । यस्तु अप्रमत्तगीतः तत्प्रमाणम् ।

So one can at the outset refute many quotations put forth by the 'scholar'.

  

3\. There is the problem of interpolations in Dharmasastras, Puranas , Itihasas etc . First this problem is to be solved .

  

4\. If a statement in Dharmasastra goes against Veda then the latter prevails.

  

5\. We cannot decide as to what is said in Veda with regard to a specific aspect as all the 1137 Vedasakhas are not available (only 12/13 are there).

  

6.The युगधर्म also has to be taken into consideration - people generally take all विधिs and निषेधs , that are said in Vedas etc as they are .

  

7\. There are no so many castes in Vedas etc - only four , that too , according to गुण and कर्म - how can one justify the application of the same to the present day society ? Today most of the ब्राह्मणs are जातिब्राह्मणs.

No doubt , in शङ्खस्म्रुति etc some names are given to the children born out of inter-caste marriages - today they are called Backward Castes etc. So the original वर्णव्यवस्था is no longer applicable .

  

8.Naturally , people do have some habits such as पशुमैथुनम् ( sex with animals) and the same was banned in धर्मशस्त्रs whereas the same was banned in Switzerland / Belgium (?) just last year only !

  

8\. Did the ' scholar ' study at least 50 स्मृतिs - there is '
यवनादीनां श्राद्धम् ’ । We never look down anybody . Other people also have to follow the धर्मs prescribed for ब्राह्मणs - it is clearly stated .

  

More points with quotations will be there in the next posting.

  

धन्यो’स्मि
