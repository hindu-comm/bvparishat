On: "*It is also well known that the use of Sanskrit was limited to sections of the society, broadly labelled as upper castes; and that the history of exclusion and marginalisation in India is closely linked to the manner in which access to Sanskrit was controlled in the past."*

It may be noted that great social reformer Saint from Kerala, Sri Narayana Guru (1856-1928), and his equally celebrated poet disciple Kumaran Ashan were both well versed with Sanskrit. Guru has authored many works in Sanskrit -- *Darsana Mala, Brahmavidya Panchakam, Nirvruthi Panchakam, Slokathrayi* etc. On being asked by Mahatma Gandhi, whether he knew English,Guru famously questioned Gandhiji back, whether he knew Sanskrit!

  

Guru was from the backward Avarna community of Ezhavas and rejected casteism, and promoted new values of spiritual freedom and social equality. His movement led to the reform movement among Hindus of Kerala.

  

So there are excellent examples of espousal of Sanskrit by the non-upper caste Hindus too.
