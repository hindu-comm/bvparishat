Dear scholar friends,

  

I have not studied political philosophy. I observe something I would call "political labeling"

which is used as a process of "free speech". An object, an individual, a person or a

group can be labelled with various terms to check if they stick. In India we call it

"calling names" or "curse". While Indian literature and society admonished cursing,

the latter is a popular expression of "free speech" in the west. The US is a factory

for it. Calling something with a "one liner" is a style. My observation is that some

of the Indology scholars possibly unknowingly also fall into this "one liner" expressions,

and claim that they are using "free speech." 

  

Through repeated reinforcements and media coverage the label might stick.

Once the label sticks, the affected person has to make efforts to remove the label.  

I do not know how the technique was invented, but it seems to work! My thinking

is that it is a product of creating binary categories. This is where Indian philosophical

speculations came in to claim that the binary thinking of "high" and "low" is artificial!

  
So I think.
