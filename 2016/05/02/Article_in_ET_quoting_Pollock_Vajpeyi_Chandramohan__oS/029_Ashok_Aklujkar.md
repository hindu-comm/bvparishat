Much material directly or indirectly relevant to the current discussion (especially to the four excellent points made by Dr. Nagaraj Paturi) is available in: Houben, Jan E.M. 1996 (ed) Ideology and Status of Sanskrit: Contributions to the History of the Sanskrit Language. Leiden: E.J. Brill. An Indian edn., with the addition of an updating introduction, was published by Motilal Banarsidass in 2012.  
  
If any members of this forum are interested in reading my article (“The early history of Sanskrit as supreme language”) in the above-mentioned volume, they should contact me privately.
