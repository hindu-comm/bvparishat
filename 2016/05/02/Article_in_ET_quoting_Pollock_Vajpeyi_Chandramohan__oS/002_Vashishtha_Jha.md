My expectation from ET would be to also publish another article to report whether there was and there is oppression and discrimination where there was and is no Sanskrit. I am simply suggesting to applying the principle of anvaya and vyatireka of Indian intellectual tradition to claim whether Sanskrit is or was the cause of oppression or discrimination.

  

" ... every document of civilisation is at the same time a document of barbarism. " is the colour of Pollock's goggle, it appears. Indian tradition does not accept this vyaapti. Inidian intellectual tradition does not take any thing blindly.

  

Does Pollock have any training in Nyaya ? The clarification published here "to balance" does not reflect he has. What he certainly has is a strong 'political motif'. How can therefore his opinion be called 'scholarly' ? This is not the concept of scholarship in India.

  

Prof. Kannan should keep on noting all this for discussion in the coming seminar.
