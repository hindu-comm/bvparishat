Dear Sri Nityanad,

I don't know if Aravind Sharma says that. He would be wrong in those phrases.

"Academic" community has to understand "faith" in order to analyze "faith".

As I said in my post, "faith" is not a picture. Sanskrit is not a text or a few

isolated sentences. Lately I have a feeling that operations touted as

"Hindu Studies" have little to do with the Hindus. They are remnants of

European efforts to "understand" India and to caricature her in order to help

create sympathetic attitude among their individual countrymen. They do not care

that such attitude must change because people of Indian descent are part of the

"population" now. As I said in my review of Rajiv''s book, people of Indian

descent never had a reflection what distinguishes them as a block of population.

Scholars in India must turn themselves as activists to protest against derogatory

dealings on India. You have a role to play in this as an active scholar. There

are no "two sides" for an activist. Boycotts, protests and rejoinders are in

order. You have to guard the interests of more than a billion people.

Pollock's interest in JNU is a good case to ponder politics in "scholarship".

Best regards,

BM
