Dear Prof. Mishra Ji

  

If you think the term “both sides” conveyed the sense that “we are bystanders”, let me restate that as:

  

*Good to see “our side” (your and mine) is also being given coverage in the media, though the coverage is still more on “their side”.*

  

Between a Camille Bulcke and a Karpatra Swami, “we” (you and me) will be on the same side, that of Karpatra Swami, and you probably know this. However, please do consider that just using the term like “both sides” or “two communities” does not make one a “bystander”. Arvind Sharma is quoted by McComas Taylor as follows (‘Mythology Wars: The Indian Diaspora, “Wendy's Children” and the Struggle for the Hindu Past’, Asian Studies Review, 35: 2, p. 160):

  

*Sharma maintains that the new challenge is to adjudicate differences of opinion between the faith community and the academic community, on the basis of criteria acceptable to both.*

  

And yet, Arvind Sharma’s endorsement is the first one sees in TBFS (on the dust jacket), and his interpretations are used by Malhotra to counter Pollock. I don’t think Arvind Sharma is a bystander. A phrase does not a bystander make.

  

Lastly, it is good to see that the media is at least interviewing people like Prof. Kannan, Sh. N. Gopalaswami, Sh. Rajiv Malhotra. The coverage is still biased in the ET article: Pollock makes the headline and Kannan does not, and an impression is given that Kannan did not answer some questions. Still, this is better than the post-MCLI petition scenario where views of only one side (“their side”) were published.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
