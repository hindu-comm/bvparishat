There is also evidence to show that in the time of Valmiki Ramayana, Sanskrit texts were read by shudras:

  

पठन्द्विजो वागृषभत्वमीयात्स्यात्क्षत्रियो भूमिपतित्वमीयात्।

वणिग्जनः पण्यफलत्वमीयाज्जनश्च शूद्रोऽपि महत्त्वमीयात्॥

– वा॰रा॰ १.१.१००

  

And on King Bhoja there is the other anecdote that the भारवाह corrected his grammar by replying:

भारो न बाधते राजन् यथा बाधति बाधते
