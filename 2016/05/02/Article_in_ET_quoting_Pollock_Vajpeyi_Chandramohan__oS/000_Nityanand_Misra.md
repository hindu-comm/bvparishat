Good to see both sides are being given coverage in the media, though the coverage is still more on the liberal narrative in this article.  

  

Pollock appears to be performing a balancing act. He quotes Benjamin to say that every document of civilization is a document of barbarism, and his total oeuvre aims towards balance. 

  

"I interpret the history of Sanskrit as one of the most remarkable achievements of human culture. It enabled a form of cosmopolitanism that had few peers in the ancient or modern world. And it interacted with regional literary cultures in a way that permitted true and enduring diversity... however, every document of civilisation is at the same time a document of barbarism (Walter Benjamin), and there have indeed been occasions where it has been important for me to foreground the latter: the place of Sanskrit in the articulation of inequality and domination. But as you will see, my total oeuvre aims toward balance, based on evidence and argument, in the true spirit of scholarship."
