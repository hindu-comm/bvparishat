Please look at the title:

  

"Sheldon Pollock offers scholarly opinion on Sanskrit - a language that the government seems keen to ****massify****" (emphasis mine)

  

What a ridiculous self-contradiction! On the one hand , the same article says,

  

"It is also well known that the use of Sanskrit was limited to sections of the society, broadly labelled as upper castes; and that the history of exclusion and marginalisation in India is closely linked to the manner in which access to Sanskrit was controlled in the past."

  

This means masses of India should have been provided access to Sanskrit. My previous post shows how the observation in the quote here is wrong. But for a moment, even if we agree that it was right, then the solution is 'massification' of Sanskrit only. But the very title of the article has the tone of opposition to the efforts to 'massify' Sanskrit.
