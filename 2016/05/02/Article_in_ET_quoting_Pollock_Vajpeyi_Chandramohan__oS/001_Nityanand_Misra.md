"ET Magazine followed up with a second round of questions to Kannan, asking, among other things, how he would define manual scavenging, untouchability and other discriminatory practices in the context of his observation that several historians had declared there was no slavery in India. Kannan did not send answers to the follow-up questions."

  

Is it not better for the author (KP Narayana Kumar) to write "a response was awaited at the time of printing this article" than saying "Kannan did not send answers"? For all the the reporter knows, Prof. Kannan might be busy or traveling.
