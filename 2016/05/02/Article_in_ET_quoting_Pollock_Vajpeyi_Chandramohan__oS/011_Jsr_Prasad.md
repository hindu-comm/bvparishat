Shall we call this as yellow journalism or acts of paid media? I can't resist to comment on following views in the article, though they are not critical:

*Sanskrit was never the common man's language, the actor says..*

actors becoming professors and historians these days, really? So, behold, so much of entertainment is guranteed..  
  
*Ironically, in these times of the internet and cell phone, Sanskrit has become a significant point of debate and discussion.*  
  
- Alas! I need to type out the sentences from this article as ET do not allow 'copy' and 'paste' of its conent in this times of internet..  
  
- In context of, 'whether mother has to send to the old age home or to be taken care at our own home,' does it become a sudden point of debate and discussion? Either way it is one's own dharma, right?  
  
*In the recent past, there have been several controversies pertaining to Sanskrit... HRD minister Smirti Irani's declaration that IITs have been asked to teach Sanskrit to students “for facilitating study of science and technology as reflected in its literature*.”  
  
This is not a new thing, one and half decade back, IIT Kanpur has offered Sanskrit courses to its students thoroughly approved by a committee. I am aware of the scholar, who taught over there. A professor from IIT Delhi has also helped them to draft the syllabus. Words like science and technology put in double quotes, reveals the attitude of author of this 'master piece.' If the author(s) can't google about Indian achievements in science and technology, let them try to search 'PHISPC' which has published good number of scientific volumes. That gives information on how Sanskrit instigated scientific temper.  
  
.*.the language has been appreciated for its poetry and mythology.*  
  
Sorry, it is called 'purana,' no mythology business here.  
  
*It is also well known that the use of Sanskrit was limited to sections of the society, broadly labelled as upper castes; and that the history of exclusion and marginalisation in India is closely linked to the manner in which access to Sanskrit was controlled in the past.*  
  
The author is deliberately ignoring facts or himself is ignorant of the same. Mahabhashyam was written in the colloquial Sanskrit style. Next, in king Bhoja's kingdom, it was believed that everyone was a Sanskrit poet. An ambassodor went in search of people, who can not write Sanskrit poetry, ultimately, he succeeds in getting a weaver. Then the weaver replies -  
  
काव्यं करोमि नहि चारुतरं करोमि  
यत्नात्करोमि यदि चारुतरं करोमि ।  
भूपालमौलिमणिरञ्जितपादपीठ  
हे भोजराज कवयामि वयामि यामि ।।  
  
Scholars can add more such instances in this context.  
  
*He \[Prof. Pollock\] has also argued how the reliance on the Vedas as the source of ultimate truth has discouraged trial and error and practical experimentation in recent centuries in India. In contrast, it was practical experiments that laid the foundation for the Renaissance in Europe.*  
  
In Indian context, trail and error is about truth and un-truth only. We never wanted material progress, but, instead the spiritual progress. So is it wrong, if we have not give a trails to trace the 'god's particle' in the name of big bang experiments?  
  
Ananya Vajpeyi's statement with regard to 'all Indian science is western,' is like a proverb in Telugu – 'egg goes to chicken to riddicule it.' She needs more maturity in academic debates.  
  
Chandramohan's comment on teaching Sanskrit in IITs – IITs do not produce religious practitioners or philosophers, but just engineers. So, how students accept anything that is irrelevant to their curriculum? He himself is said to be an IITian in the article. He should not simply attribute caste system to the Sanskrit scriptures but show concrete evidences.  
  
*It was English education that created the architect of the Indian Constitution BR Ambedkar.*  
  
But why is he silent on Dr. Ambedkar's strong suggestion to make Sanskrit, the national language? Also, the Indian constitution has heavily drawn insights from Arthasastra and other important texts, is my belief.  
  
Other views in the article are either answered by scholars or they just to be ignored.

Economic Times is owned by the Bennet and Coleman with an inhetent British '*samskara*,' started some one and half century back.

Whether such articles educate or fabricate about the ground realities?
