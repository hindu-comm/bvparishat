Dear Sri Nityanad and friends,

  

The phrase "both sides" in the mail would seem to suggest that we are "bystanders" in this process.

Sanskrit is the soul of the culture of India.  Any denigration to it affects India as a nation and Indians

as a group in the world. Such denigration has been methodically executed through various agencies

over time leading some to think that Sanskrit in India was discovered by William James. Such is the

prevailing narrative rampant in the west and is also, as I learn, made popular in India among the new

youth. The "sides' are not Rajiv Malhotra and Sheldon Pollock, but they are the Indian society and

her culture versus the interpretation by the western "scholars" through whatever motivation. 

  

The following scholarly question can be posed: "How much a culture can be interpreted without

practicing it?" The culture is not written in books, the culture is in people's living, conduct, understanding

and beliefs. Dry anthropological cultural interpretation is dangerous because presupposes a standard.

Prof Pollock or whosoever he quotes are wrong because a qualitative evaluation of "high" and "low"

hides the basic tenet of life which is the living itself. Unfortunately I do not have any sympathy for the

two dimensional interpretation of humanity. This is where my science and thinking would deviate

strongly from representation of linearity in culture. I would have sympathy for Pollock and Co if

they learn to write with qualifiers, They should say it is "their" perception and not use "generalized"

sentences.

  

While free speech is OK, free speech to denigrate a culture is not OK.
Sheldon Pollock and many

like him in the west lack the scientific skills of analysis and the humility of presentation. He should

himself read Newton's Principia in order to understand why our observations would need always

qualification. Rajiv Malhotra thinks it to be willful manipulation, but it could be ignorance and lack

of preparation. But either way it is not a scholarly enterprise and the product becomes a political

document like many such commissioned products in history. One's own association could create

a cover to think all scholars in the world might have such association.
Hie interpretation that Valmiki

was hired by a king is my clue that he looks to other scholars through a self-made lens. 

  

What Rajiv Malhotra is after a serious soul searching for all things Indian. He may have flaws

in his accumulation of documents. As I said while I reviewed his book, he is the Paul Revere of

India's possible awakening. i live two hundred yards from where Paul Revere was caught by the

British after he was returning from Concord. I am glad that Rajiv's books are out, and that his

message is communicated. His was the solitary dangerous journey in the night. The man who

bailed Paul Revere out that night in 1775 was a man called John Hancock, a lawyer. Many others

might have thought that Paul Revere was breaking the laws by galloping in the night. 

  

While Gandhi fought for independence, the government servants might think of "both sides".

It takes time to think that a little security does not cause dignity.
Many decades had to go before

people left offices to fight for freedom. I would think the same would be the case in this new

reawakening. The inertia could be stronger because there is no "occupier". But intellectual

slavery is more dangerous than physical slavery. I myself did not comprehend the depth of the

the disease in me before I read Rajiv. I would request all free thinking Indians about the dignity of

Indian culture and its interpretation in the world. India is only a sample. It must protect herself

and also create protection to many other indigenous cultures in the world.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
