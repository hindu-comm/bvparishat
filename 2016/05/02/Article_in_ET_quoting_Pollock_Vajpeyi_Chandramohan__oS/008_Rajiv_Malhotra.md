I also learned that ET had been approached by the Pollock camp weeks earlier, and he got lots of time to craft the story line with them. But we got asked only in the last minute, in a hurry with short deadlines given. I could not afford the time to do a second iteration with them, especially since they asked questions with a clear tilt, and seemed to ignore much of what I said already.  
  

Kannan also faced severe time pressure from them - hardly the method if their truly wanted genuine knowledge.  
  

We have advanced over the past 25 years from being ignored to being non-ignorable. Please watch the fight in my Columbia Univ lecture last week. This video has gone viral in the past week with 20,000 views: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olQlPZuEWLY>
