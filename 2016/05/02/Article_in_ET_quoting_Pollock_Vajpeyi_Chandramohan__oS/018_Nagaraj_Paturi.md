**1. Which people labelled as lower castes wanted to learn Sanskrit and were denied the opportunity? When Sanskrit was spoken in major part of the Indic subcontinent, people labelled as lower castes spoke dialects of Sanskrit that are called Prakrits. Sanskrit was the standard form spoken all over the Sanskrit-speaking areas in the same form whereas the Prakritas spoken by the people labelled as lower castes had regional variations. The situation is similar to a common variety of Kannada being usedby the elite all over the places and the non-elite Kannada having regional variations. Sanskrit plays reflect a reality of the Prakrita speaking characters understanding the Sanskrita spoken by the Sanskrita-speaking characters and vice-versa. That was how the reality was in all the Sanskrit-speaking regions. Then why at alldo the Prakrita-speaking people labelled as lower castes need to 'learn' Sanskrit when they already understand it and speak it in a different form of their own? Do the speakersof non-elite dialects of
Kannadaneed to learn the elite Kannada as a course in a school? Don't they understand the elite form and respond to in their own dialect?**

**2. In other parts of the Indic subcontinent (for example, in south India ), where Sanskrit was not the spoken language, Sanskrit was used only as a language used for studies, book-writing etc. People labelled as lower castes did not need to communicate in that language or to understand that language., because their way of life did notneed the use of Sanskrit.**

**3. One may argue that the non-Brahmin authors of Sanskrit,areall kings, hence kshatriyas not people labelled as lower castes. But that is not true. In India, kshatiyas find mention only in books. In the actual reality and actualhistory, kings were mostly people labelled as lower castes that were accorded Kshatriya status after becoming kings. For example, the Reddy kings or Rayala dynasty kings of Vijayanagara were all 'people labelled as lower castes' only.**

**4 People labelled as lower castes feeling denial of opportunity to learn Sanskrit began only during therecent period of history. But this situation lasted only for a short while. Modern education very soon provided opportunities for all people irrespective of their caste or religion to learn**
