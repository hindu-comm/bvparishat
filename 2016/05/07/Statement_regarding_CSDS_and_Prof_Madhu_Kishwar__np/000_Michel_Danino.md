Respected scholars,



Most of you may be aware of the context behind Prof Madhu Kishwar’s legal notice to CSDS: <http://swarajyamag.com/politics/academic-intolerance-csds-denies-affiliation-to-madhu-kishwar-2> . CSDS’s behaviour in this affair deserves the designation of academic goondaism. The issue is not just Prof Madhu Kishwar’s career but also the greater issue of a Left-dominated body trying to crush all dissent, as has happened in many other institutions earlier.



A few of us drafted the statement below intended for India-based academics; it has received 47 endorsements so far from academics in a number of institutions across the country. (I understand that a separate statement is being prepared for non-India-based academics.) We will close the endorsements tomorrow evening and will release the statement to the press. Should you wish to add your name to it, kindly write to me offline with your academic designation.



With regards,



Michel



------------------------------------------------------------------------

We, the undersigned academics, wish to express our whole-hearted support to Prof. Madhu Kishwar in her challenge to the discrimination she has suffered at the hands of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies’ administration. We are appalled at the unethical and illegal treatment meted out to her even though she is widely acclaimed as an academic as well as a public intellectual. Equally important,  the CSDS’s administration has not had a single complaint against her through the twenty years that she has served that institution.

It is hard to believe that an institution claiming to uphold high standards of humanities should have stooped so low simply because Prof. Madhu Kishwar does not toe its ideological line. This crude victimization and harassment, culminating in the denial of affiliation to CSDS required for her to avail of the prestigious Mahatma Gandhi National Fellowship instituted by the ICSSR, reveals a definite pattern. Such an action is unprecedented since no educational institution in India has ever denied affiliation to an ICSSR fellowship holder, leave alone a National Fellowship awardee of ICSSR. The reason cited for this denial of affiliation (as spelled out [here](http://swarajyamag.com/politics/academic-intolerance-csds-denies-affiliation-to-madhu-kishwar-2)) is ludicrous, especially when it turns out that in the last fifteen years, CSDS has given affiliation to scores of scholars, including rank outsiders.

This act of vindictiveness against Prof. Kishwar speaks volume s about the intolerance and hypocrisy of those who have in recent times loudly projected themselves as champions of tolerance and liberalism. We call on CSDS’s administration to stop this discrimination and victimization forthwith, tender an unconditional apology to Prof. Madhu Kishwar and take all steps to rectify this shameful situation.
