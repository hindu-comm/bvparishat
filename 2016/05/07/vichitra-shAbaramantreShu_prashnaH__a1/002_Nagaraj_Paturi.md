There are regional language versions of these.

  

One of my teachers told me that the word could mean 'tribal' with the word 'shabara' /'s'abara' meaning tribe or forest-dwelling.

  

I heard the 'texts' (purely oral ) ofsome of the scorpion mantras with words and sentences sounding Telugu. But the meaning appears to be nonsensical, with believers of them considering those meanings to be encryptions.
