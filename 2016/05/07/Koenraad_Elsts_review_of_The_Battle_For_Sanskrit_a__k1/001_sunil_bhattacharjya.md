Dear Rajivji,  
  

Koenraad gave a good review. Koenraad writes  

Malhotra observes that most Hindusare not aware that a war is raging for the destruction of their civilization. Thy don't come out of their comfort zone, out of their career and family concerns, and hence have never developed a sense of the enormous hostility that is targeting them in the ugly wide world.  

  
Having said that Koenraad narrows down quite abruptly to American scholars, as if they alone are doing that. This hostility, in fact, started way back in the 18th century with the work of Sir William Jones.  

Konraad also wrote about Sheldon Pollock's horrendous interpretation of Ramayana events and made the comment

“Anything good in the book is of course, the product of borrowing from Buddhism” (in accord with the reigning assumption “Hinduism bad, Buddhism good”), so he juggles the chronology to make the Budha predate Valmiki.

  

Pollock is neither the first nor the only person to try to utilize a distorted chronology against Hindus. Right from William Jones there have been many Westerners and their Indian followers alike, are endorsing the distorted chronology. Believe me or not, even our own people and good scholars like Talageri accept the Max Mullerian chronology. One has only to ask them the date of Lord Buddha or the date Chandragupta Maurya, to check that  
  

So while Rajivji's is a laudable work and may his tribe increase, we have not to forget that even more urgent wotk is remaining to be taken up, such as arriving at the correct Chronology of the ancient Indian History.  
  

Regards,
