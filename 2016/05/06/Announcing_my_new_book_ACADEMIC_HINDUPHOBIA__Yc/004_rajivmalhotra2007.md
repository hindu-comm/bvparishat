This is a collection of OLD essays dating back to the 1995-2004 era. Much has changed since. For instance:  

-   My views have evolved as has my writing style.  
-   I have moved to many other topics of research.  
-   Many players on both sides have changed in their work as a result of
    these old fights, and some even switched sides since then.  
-   The dynamics of the kurukshetra changed as a result of the
    interventions made at that time. For instance, the school textbooks
    fights now under way are a direct result.

A lot of new persons have entered this arena recently, and they tend to be ignorant of all this background. Therefore, many of them make the same mistakes and/or repeat the same work that has already been done. They propose naive ideas without knowing what has transpired already. Many persons write to me for this past information, because it is an important part of the history of the Hindu intellectual revival movement in the West which also spread into India rapidly. Today, both sides are global - the Hinduphobics and the pro-Hindu forces.

  

Many people suggested that we bring out these old essays in their unedited/raw form. They convey the intensity of what took place for that defining decade. It brings nostalgia to the old timers, and it is intended to provide a foundation for new entrants wanting to take these encounters forward.

  

There is enough archived material for many other volumes on the various encounters of that period. But I am too busy with my new work. So it is up to others to locate, curate and put that material together.
