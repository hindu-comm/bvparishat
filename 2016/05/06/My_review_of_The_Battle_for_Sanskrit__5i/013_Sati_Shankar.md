Situation is becoming clearer now with new discoveries based on scientific testing, we have to come out with all the mental and social taboos, we are no more colonized and are free to think and breath.

Quoting the link from this thread... <http://www.sci-news.com/othersciences/linguistics/science-indus-script-sanskrit-language-01777.html>

Stay fast to re-write own history and destiny.

Best wishes

Sati Shankar
