Thanks for your comments, it is useful to read your views. I agree with many things you say, and disagree with some others, but I guess that is but natural: *muṇḍe muṇḍe matirbhinnā*.

  

I would like to mention two things

  

1\) The focus of my article is the book TBFS, and not Pollock's oeuvre or lens. My comments on Pollock's statements are mostly in footnotes or appendixes: these being tangential to the main article, it is natural that the treatment is superficial. If I were to write a paper (like the one by Hanneder) or a book (like TBFS) to specifically critique a paper or the body of work of an author, the focus and hence the treatment will be much different.

  

2\) It is not easy to develop new Pāṇḍava-s. It takes natural talent and years of *sādhanā* to be a Bhīma or an Arjuna, many can be like them (*bhīmārjunasamā yudhi*, BG 1.4) but not equal to them. The words of a senior leader may amount to criticism, but there does exist a *nyāya* that criticism is not for criticizing something but for praising what is praiseworthy: *na hi nindā nindyaṃ nindituṃ pravartate’pi tu vidheyaṃ stotum*. We can surely learn a lot even from the criticism of tall scholars.

  

We live in interesting times.
