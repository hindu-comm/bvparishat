Dear Sati Shankarji,



We have discussed the book enough. Research is always incremental it was happening in the past, now and future. I do not see any point in opening this thread and discussing the same topic. Our Group member has reviewed the book and the review is available publicly. One cannot stick to one topic for ever .
