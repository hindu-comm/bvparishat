Friends,

I don't wish to argue,. I gave an example of "House is under fire."

In our fields of physical sciences, it is called the signal theory.

In certain situations the signal itself is the rasa!

One could imagine this by meeting one's mother as might have

happened to many on Mother's Day yesterday!

Best regards,

BM
