Dear Sri Nityanand,

  

I have difficulty to understand the observation in your mail. If you have not spent some time in understanding

Prof Pollock's views, how would you disagree with what Rajiv Malhotra is observing. The point that Rajv

makes is not that Prof Pollock is not studious, what he says is that Prof Pollock uses a political lens.

Rajiv's observation might look distant because of his insertion of Shankara chair episode, but that

won't diminish the power of his presentation on the denigration of the scriptures and the cultural use

of Sanskrit language. 

  

My father was freedom fighter. He would tell us stories about how informers would caution the activists

on the impending British raid. Rajiv is such an informer. To evaluate the quality of messaging is different

than to appreciate the message itself. "House is under attack" has content value and no speech value.

The reason I admire Rajiv because it is a different kind of journalism.
We don't check the style, syntax

or the packaging, but the contents. That he has made a readable book on a difficult topic to alert immigrants

like me and native scholars like you is the compliment we offer. 

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
