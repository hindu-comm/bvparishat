Dear friends,  

Kindly permit me to send the message anew, as it remained incomplete and there was some garbling in that last mail.The corrected mail is as below:  

Namaste  

Now it is widely known that the archaeological findings like those in the Indus valley (Sarasvati-Sindhu basin) site-exacavations have pushed back the Indian antiquity. If I remember correctly, even the famous historian Romila Thapar also concedes that the historical implications of these new archaeological findngs have to be recognized.  
  
Added to this, the recent availability of the sophisticated astronomical softwares, combined with search for the appropriate data and their proper interpretation, have given us new tools for historical work. Recent astronomical studies by Prof. Narahari Achar on the dates of Lord Buddha and of King Kanishka have convincingly proved that the historical information given in the Puranas and in the Rajatarangini are right. It is little known that Prof.. Achar has also worked on the astronomical dating of Adi Shankaracharya.  

  
The Rajataarangini, the Mahabharata and the Puranas have abundant historical and astronomical data, which should be utilized to examine the traditional beginning of the Kali era, when Lord Krishna passed away and the Pandavas installed Parikshit on the Hastinapur-throne and then they left for vanavasa. The date of the Mahabharata war is an extremely important milestone in the ancient Indian History and I sincerely hope that a fresh study of the astronomical and other data given in the Mahabharata and the use of the astronomical tools will help us in finding the date of the Mahabharata war.

These datings will automatically prove beyond doubt the antiquity of the Sanskrit language.

Regards,

Sunil Bhattacharjya
