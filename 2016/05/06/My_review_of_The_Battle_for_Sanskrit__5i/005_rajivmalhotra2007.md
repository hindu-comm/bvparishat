First of all, I want to thank Nityananda Misra ji (NM) for putting in so much effort to read my book closely and write a balanced review. It is indeed very helpful to me. I will pass on many editing issues he has raised to my publisher for correcting future print runs.

  

There are a few important points I wish to make below, some of which are responses to the review, while others serve to add further clarification.

  

***1) American Orientalism:***  

  

Since each civilization has had its own history of encounters with the west, each has its own distinct kind of experience of Orientalism. The Chinese have a field of study called Occidentalism in which they reverse the gaze upon the west. Blacks call this Whiteness Studies (led by Nell Painter who wrote “*The history of white people*”, and numerous others). Hispanics have produced extensive work giving their side. Edward Said’s *Orientalism* was largely the Arab experience of the west though it did lip service to India.

  

However, the Indian study of Orientalism has been most intensely from the Left in its postcolonial studies. I have written before on this, as to where it falls short. First, it is NOT done from a Vedic traditional standpoint at all, and it regurgitates the liberal white American self-criticism. So these Indians are parroting what liberal white Americans write about their culture a critical way. This has morphed into subaltern studies, where it adopted the western liberal lens that had been developed to sympathize with the non-white oppressed, and they started to use that lens to attack Indian civilization’s “oppression of the masses”. So it turned into self-hatred in the hands of the Left. Second, these leftist/postcolonialists are fed by the US establishment, and hence their tendency is to respect certain boundaries when it comes to criticizing the west. Third, such criticisms tend to conflate USA and Europe with a single brush, which is patently wrong. The very purpose of chapter 2 is to highlight this difference between Europe and America.

  

In particular, the Pollock school per se has not come under the microscope now. I will return to this issue in the final point below.

  

***2) Dalit anti-Ram song:***

  

Please note that this song appears in a section of my book, titled, “*Third party echoes: Pollock’s ideas go viral*”. The purpose there is to show how his ideas went viral through *third-party echoes*. In other words, the examples being cited in this section are not Pollock’s own writings but those of others who have become influenced by him, and who started to echo them forcefully in many forums.

The anti-Ram song I cite was in a teacher training manual funded by the US federal government’s National Endowment for Humanities. This was in the mid-1990s. Lynn Cheney, wife of Dick Cheney, was the head of the NEH. The purpose of this US gov’t project was to bring “multiculturalism” into US schools by teaching the Ramayana as an example of non-Christian faiths. The book was a guide for teachers to teach the Ramayana in US schools, purportedly under the guise of bringing them an appreciation of the third world. It was clearly a method of popularization that was clearly driven by human rights agendas. That was still the early stage of US interventions in Dalit affairs.

  

Soon after it came out in the mid-90s, I started a campaign to criticize it on grounds that it was inappropriate for American teenagers, because they lacked the maturity and background about Hinduism to be able to appreciate such material a balanced manner. Please read the protest letter we wrote to the government authorities:

There was feeble support for my efforts from political/religious Hindu leaders at that time. They were too arrogant, defensive, dismissive of my findings, etc. Only many years later they started to show interest in these issues I had raised.

I am glad to say the US government decided to end this program to “popularize the Ramayana” in US schools.  

  

This was one of the mobilizations we did long before it became fashionable for Hindu groups to fight against school textbook biases. In fact, it was such early activism by a few of us that gave birth to most of the groups that are active today - such as HAF, DANAM, CAPEEM, etc.)

  

***3) NM wrote:*** “it is a bit too much to expect a chair professor on Hinduism in Western academia to be an active disciple of a guru and have a traditional lifestyle.”  

  

*Response*: There is precedence for this in US academics. Please note that almost all the faculty for Judaism Studies are officially ordained rabbis. Many Sikh studies chairs and Buddhism chairs are practicing persons and teachers from their respective faith. In the latter case they tend to be disciples of the Dalai Lama. I also have experience installing such faculty in a manner that achieves our goals without violating the rules of equal opportunity for hiring. If one wants to do this, there are some methods available.  

  

But the Columbia chair bandwagon was enamored by the secular, critical and leftist (so-called “objective”) approach. They were going with the flow of the academic momentum and not wanting to question it at all. This is what happens when our side lacks any critical response capabilities and the audacity to carry it out.

  

The real issue is whether Sringeri has the faculty to supply. The individuals would need not only Sanskrit knowledge and training in multiple ways, but also English and modern idiom competence. Why should the center started by Adi Shankara based on his debating and scholarly skills be incapable of supplying the finest experts on the same topic today?

  

***4) NM wrote:*** “writing new *itihāsa*‑s or *smṛti*‑s in Sanskrit may not serve much purpose…”

  

*Response*: I accept that it need not be in Sanskrit. So let it be in English and Indian languages for the public. I am not thinking of itihas and smriti in the old sense. Think of Harry Potter movies as western attempts to produce their equivalent of purana/itihas and kavyas. We need modern contemporary works inspired by and consistent with our own values. Who will do this?

  

I find leftist’s and Christians hijacking the performing arts, especially dance. A common theme now is to perform Hindu dance with proper dress/symbols and grammar, but telling stories about Jesus and about human rights abuses in Indian society. (A conference is being discussed that would expose this influence of Pollock and give responses from our side.)

  

Regarding new smritis: Pollock’s liberation philology is in fact a movement by his school to develop what amounts to the equivalent of new smritis. These works would champion human rights of the oppressed through new theories, codes, regulations, quotas, laws, and even international legal dictates imposed upon India. I regret to say that our thought leaders are on the defensive, rather than leading such innovation from our Vedic perspective.

NM wrote: “all leaders or teachers of Hindu religious institutions and movements cannot be expected to understand and debate Islam and Christianity.”

  

Response: Not all, but the major leaders must have this experience, especially those sent to represent us in global forums. A competitive team must know the theater it will play in, and understand the other teams it will be playing against. In my 46 years living in the west, I did not find our representatives (government, Hindu organizations, Hindu political groups) to be on par with others in this capability. I found them very ignorant and not even aware of their own limitations. Too blind sighted and arrogant to listen and understand to new inputs.

  

***5) NM wrote***: “he ignores works like *Satyārtha Prakāśa* and Vedārthapārijātaḥ when he asks why Hindu leaders failed to do ‘purva-paksha of Islam, Christianity and Western secular thought’.  

  

*Response*: I am aware of these works, but aren’t they dated? Are we assuming the world has been static since then, and so we can rest passively because “someone long ago already did it”? Even to the extent such works would still be up to date, they are hardly taught, hardly mainstream in our collective consciousness. This is an area that needs constant activity by our side. There is no such things as ultimate/final purva-paksha/uttara-paksha of the dynamic, competing civilizations that are on the march.  

  

***6) My two important concluding remarks on this review:***

  

A) A) Nityananda Misra ji completely ignores discussing Pollock’s lens/tool kit. He picks small issues of isolated factoids here and there. But what makes Pollock important in the first place? What is new and different about him compared to earlier Indologists? Until this is clear, it would seem like a lot of fuss about one Western scholar out of so many. In fact, I wrote this book to address this issue. Figuring out Pollock is what took most of my time, and not minute details here and there. I refer readers to my summary article, “*The challenges of understanding Sheldon Pollock*”. Read: <http://swarajyamag.com/culture/rajiv-malhotra-explains-the-challenges-of-understanding-sheldon-pollock>

B)  

B) This takes me to the final point: Where are the Pandavas? My book diagnoses why this kind of response from our side did not happen all these decades, and what blockages we must remove in order to facilitate it. Rather than leading such a Pandava force, some of our prominent leaders got defensive, and started attacking me for suggesting that they must wake up and do something. One of them has famously claimed that all this response to the Pollock school had already been done, and he listed 40 names. I responded by requesting for a bibliography of such writings that critique Pollock’s work, and I am yet to hear back with any shred of evidence. The fact is that very few among our senior leaders truly understand the nature of this threat we face. I am fortunate to have the blessings and endorsement from many of them. I am humbled by the support I get from them. Here is my view of the way ahead: What we need to do (and *will* do) is to develop *new* Pandavas. Prof Kannan’s forthcoming conferences on responses to Pollock will be the start of such a Pandava response. The leaders with cynical attitudes toward this mobilization will be bypassed. We hope they will leave us alone to do our svadharma.
