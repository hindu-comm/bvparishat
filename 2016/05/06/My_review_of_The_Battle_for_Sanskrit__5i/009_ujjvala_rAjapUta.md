I don't think one should not include comments about design, typesetting etc in book-reviews, but it's not the same as visual effects in a film. Visual effects in a film most often happen to be well integrated with the content and contribute towards रस etc, like वर्ण-s in a good काव्य. On the other hand design and typesetting generally don't relate to the content except in the case of themed design which I think is not present in the book under question.
