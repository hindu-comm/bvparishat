Dear Bijoy Mishra Ji

  

My statement (*I agree with many things you say, and disagree with some others*) was in response to Rajiv Malhotra Ji's mail on this thread. In the mail, Rajiv Ji said many things apart from his observations on Pollock's lens. So what led you to conclude that I disagreed with Rajiv Ji's observations on Pollock's lens? If you read my article, I have covered, and also agreed with, Rajiv Ji's observations regarding the political side/aspects of Pollock's writing at several places.

  

You say "We don't check the style, syntax or the packaging, but the contents." To you, a book review should perhaps focus only on the message of the book.I am a bibliophile, and I love the whole process of producing a book (design, typesetting, printing, binding, etc).To me, a book review should also talk about these finer aspects. That does not mean I discount or ignore the message of the book. I cover these aspects over half a page in a 30-page article. I hope that is not too much? You may want read note 75 on page 18 in my article.

  

*Most book reviews do not include comments on design and typesetting, and most book reviewers do not know these fine aspects well enough. Contrast this with movie reviews where technical aspects like visuals and special effects are commonly commented upon. To me design and typesetting are very important in a book as they impact readability, though not as important as the content of the book.*

  

As well as the first statement in section 5.2 on the same page

  

*Finally, some comments on finer aspects of the book which are primarily the publisherâ€™s responsibility but with which the author should be concerned.*

  

Thanks, Nityanand
