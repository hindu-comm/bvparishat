An internet group by its own nature works as motivator. Once attention is craved to some idea,possibly after a numerable conversation, it says good bye....

What is important is that those who feel capable of contributing and when find topic of a thread compatible to their capability should begin sticking to that topic like professionals,

introduce division of labour to avoid repetitions, and contribute to develop the topic, and after some significant amount pf contribution is made, they can put all together as a workshop for final discussion. and finally output should come to public as contribution to the topic. This way we can add more value to the time we devote to read threads.

  

I am writing this not to suggest or hurt in any way the learned members of this group, but is what I have been feeling myself. We come cross so many topics, become excited for some time and the out of sight out of mind....

Regards

SS
