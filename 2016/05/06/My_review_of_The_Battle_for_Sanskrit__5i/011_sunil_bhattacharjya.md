Namaste Bijoy Mishraji,  
  

We have to look critically at what Sheldon Pollock says or writes and fight against what he does detrimental to us. Actually, what Pollock did was to put his findings/observations in the chronological framework so meticulously prepared by his western predecessors. Added to that was his western theological convictions,and we have what Pollock said. Today we can fight it out with this Pollock, but tomorrow another Pollock will rise to take the present Pollock's place. I think it is important that we demolish the western-conspired Indian chronology once-for-all and establish the true Indian chronology, so that no more Pollock can rise in future.
