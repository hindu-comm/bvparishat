**Registration is open until May 15, after that only with a (relatively small) extra fee.**

***Background*: two of our best PhDs over the past 25 years have emerged from this course!**

**You will earn a one year creditin these fast-paced classes, during nearly eight intense weeks.**

**As time allows, the cultural background of the sentences/stories we readwill be provided.**

**  
**

**The course prepares you for the (initial) use of Sanskrit in conversation with Pandits, for furtherreading andgraduate research about Hindu & Buddhist Nepal and India.**
