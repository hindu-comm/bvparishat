Thanks, Mamataji, for this list from the Shabdakalpadruma. However, we should note that while the general notion of 18 languages is relatively widespread, there is no standardization of the list of these languages, and different sources are coming up with variant lists. The Jain list does not include Sanskrit, as the Kuvalayamālā passage shows. It imagines 18 languages being spoken by different merchants, and Sanskrit is not part of the languages described.
