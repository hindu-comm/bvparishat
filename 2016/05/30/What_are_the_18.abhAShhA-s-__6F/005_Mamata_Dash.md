Namaskar to all.

Acually in the bhutasaMkhyA system bhAshA means 6. six languages were more famous. Among them Sanskrit is there. In this list variations of Prakrit languages also taken. Whether Pishel's Grammar (English translation by Subhadra Jha) will be helpful for this, but that book also deals with Prakrita languages?
