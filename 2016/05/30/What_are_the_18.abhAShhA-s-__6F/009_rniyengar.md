The Shabdakalpadruma after giving the 18 names refers to प्राकृतलङ्केश्वरव्याकरण for further details. Next the languages are prescribed for use in dramas. For exampleशकाभीरी by शकार ;दाक्षिणात्या by योधनागरिकादीनाम्etc. I do not think the 18 names refer to languages as we refer to them currently.

Some time back there was discussion about 18 scripts in BVP. In both cases the number 18 appears to be just a notional number like 18 Puranas, samhitas, siddhantas, shilpa-acharyas.
