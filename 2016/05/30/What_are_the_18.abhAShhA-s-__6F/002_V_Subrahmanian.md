Dear Sir,

  

Thanks for your reply. Could you please provide the above details, if a list of the 18 languages are available, in whatever format that is convenient?

The scanned material appended by you makes interesting reading. I understand that the languages were not given a distinct name apart from the names of the regions they are native to. In the Karṇāṭa region, which is very likely to be Karnataka of the modern times, the sample words do not sound familiar to me at all. Are they similar to Tulu?
