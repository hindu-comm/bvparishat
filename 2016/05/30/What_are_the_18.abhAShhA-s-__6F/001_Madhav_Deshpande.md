Dear Shri Subrahmanian,

  

  I don't know what this author had in his mind, but the notion of 18 different languages is known from many other sources. Viśvanātha in his Sāhityadarpaṇa calls himself an expert in 18 languages (aṣṭādaśabhāṣā-vāravilāsinī-bhujaṅga, colophon of chapt 1, and for details of these bhāṣās, chapt 6, verses 158-69). The notion of 18 regional languages is frequent in the Jain Prakrit literature, and I have attached a description of these 18 languages as described in the Jain work Kuvalayamālā. I have discussed this list in one of my publications dating back to 1979. With best wishes,
