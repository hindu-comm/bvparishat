Not necessarily. We also have the phenomenon of transfer of merit. I would not be surprised if the project started because a scholarly Jain monk (like the late Jinavijaya-muni, Punyavijaya-muni and Jambūvijaya-muni,or like the currently active Vijaya-śīla-candra-sūri) mentioned to a rich Jain devotee that survival of mss through their copying needed to be arranged urgently and the devotee agreed to fund the project because copying mss and preserving them is considered to be s a meritorius act. At least a part of the merit acquired by the scribes could naturally have been thought to go to the patron of the project (very much like the merit of sacrifice going to both the Brahmin priest and the Yajamāna).
