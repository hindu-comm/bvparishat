We must ask all manuscript libraries to digitise all their manuscript and upload them to archives.If they don't want to give them free we create a manuscript store similar to JSTOR At least scholars will know what's available. This will be the next phase to cataloging. Perhaps people with power in manuscript libraries should seriously consider options.Will they ever or will they wait for the originals to get destroyed or be happy in making them inaccessible or accessible to a privileged few who get access at a great cost and effort.
