Dear Dr. V. Subrahmanian,

  

You have asked a very pertinent question. At present, I do not have the time needed to find an explicit statement that says, ‘Although X performs the necessary action(s), Y gets the fruit/credit of the action(s).’ However, the very passage you cite speaks of such a transfer (from prayojya kartṛ to prayojaka kartṛ, so to say). In law, too, the inciting agent cannot free himself/herself from the consequences of the incited action by saying “I did not do it myself/personally.” What applies on the pāpa karma side should apply also on the puṇya karma side.

  

Although I cannot cite a directly applicable source that generally specifies ‘who gets how much’, I have the impression that the Smṛtis do contain statements dividing guilt and credit between two or more parties. If you do not take dadate too literally, even the Śākuntala line tapaḥ ṣaḍ-bhāgam akṣayyaṃ dadaty āraṇyakā hi naḥ implies the principle I have appealed to.

  

Transfer of karman in dhārmika traditions has seemed contradictory to several scholars, especially the Western ones, but I am not sure that it is entirely missing in the religion traditions.

  

Pl google with “transfer of karma” for several Internet discussions.

  

The issue has bearing on the doctrine of divine grace as well.
