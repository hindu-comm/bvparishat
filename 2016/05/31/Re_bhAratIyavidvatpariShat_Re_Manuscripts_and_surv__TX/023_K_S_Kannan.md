I am only trying to extend the logic in your opening sentence:

If it is the case that

since **both know** it is an evil act, sin accrues to both;

can it not be the case that

if **both know** an act to be meritorious, merit accrues to both?

  

May I also know whether the reasoning set forth by you is your own,

or one explicitly stated in the *śāstra*-s -

as, for example, made clear in your subsequent passages?

  

Would be thankful for a reply.
