A correction:

  

In the sentence: //Actually only because one is hired to perform an upāsana on behalf of the yajamāna it is ruled that the phalam goes to the former and not the latter.//

  

The former-latter is to be changed to read: 'goes to the latter and not the former'.

  

The error is regretted.
