In the context of this thread, I felt it is apt to point to what Vint Cerf, a Turing Award (equivalent to Nobel in Computer Science) Winner, hailed as 'Father of the Internet', and calls himself 'Chief Internet Evangelist' says about 'digital vellum':

The digital technology has not as yet provided a long-lasting method for preserving information for over centuries. The 'vellum' on which many Latin texts were written which still survive for 2000 years are inspiration for the 'Digital vellum' project.  
  
The reason for parampara bija-raksha is even more fundamental in the light of the limits of the new technologies.  
  
Best Wishes,  
Pranav
