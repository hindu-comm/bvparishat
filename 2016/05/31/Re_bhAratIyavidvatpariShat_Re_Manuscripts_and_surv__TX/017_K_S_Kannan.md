There is this well known verse:

  

***kartā kārayitā caiva***

***  prerakaś c'anumodakaḥ /***

***sukṛte duṣkṛte caiva***

***  catvāras sama-bhāginaḥ //***

  

The doer, the sponsor, the promoter, and the endorser

\- all the four have their share,

in acts of merit as well as demerit.

  

As to the word *sama, "*equal"*,*

it may mean exactly equal, or in due proportion,

depending upon the context.
