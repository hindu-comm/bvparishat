Yes. I agree that this is a point for debate. When I read the news item I was wondering for myself, what could have been the reaction of intellectuals in ancient India when writing had become the order of the day (say 100 BC-100 AD) to the oral tradition of transferring texts, particularly the Vedas. Some might have felt scripting them, as indeed it was done, was sufficient. Fortunately, the feeling of sacredness (that is a type of religiosity) associated with Vedas (even if their original meaning was not widely understood) prevailed to continue the archaic-chhandasic (आर्ष छान्दस) practices. \[As an aside: आर्ष is a very respectable word, butछान्दसis to make fun of people who are too slow\].I for oneappreciate the devotion of the people who are rewriting the manuscripts. They are not only earning their livelihood through hard work but also deriving a sense of satisfaction for contributing to a larger cause, which is for the promoters; their religion and culture.

Thanks
