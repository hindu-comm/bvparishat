With respest to the vidvans, I may say that, whether we have any idea, that how many texts have been published. If you will take survey of the manuscripts repositories, you will find may be 20% of the texts are in print and rest are yet to see the light. If we put that much of effort to bring out these texts may be critically edited or just reproduction of the text, it will be saved. Of course there are texts like Abhijnana Sakuntalam or Kumarasambhavam, which have number of editions, but we are not exploring the commentaries on these texts. we are just happy with a Com. of Mallinatha.

Ofcourse the likhana parampara is to be maintaned, but should we not take the advantage of the modern facilities ?

Already we have lost so many texts. Now it is high time now the vidvans should think of publishing the unpublished texts rather coping the printed text on the palm leaves. All these days the Jain texts were preserved in the paper format.

with regards to all,

Mamata Dash (Mishra)
