Manual hard copy reproduction on high quality weather-proof material is a part of monastic tradition that is

steeped in world culture.  To my mind, it has been a function of preservation of manuscripts in its developmental

mode for archival purpose. There are two points. The first is if the hard copy is a necessary product

for knowledge delivery. The second is if a librarian should think of shelf life more than the availability of the material.

The topic to ponder is when does material become a treasure and how does one preserve a "treasure."

Should a material be found a thousand years from now for whatever purpose? It is a relevant debate.
