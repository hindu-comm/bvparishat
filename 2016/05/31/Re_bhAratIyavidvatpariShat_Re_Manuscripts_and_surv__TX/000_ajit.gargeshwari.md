My previous message went only to nityanandaji. May be they are writing the manuscripts to gain punya. I agree digitising of manuscripts and making them accessible to all should be the priority. Archives give free and permanent storage. What's the use of digitising and keeping it on the library computer and if they don't back up periodically the data may be even lost. We must create awareness that digitising is not enough universal knowledge should be made available to all. There us no cost involved in dumping scanned manuscripts whoever scans them to [archives.org](http://archives.org).
