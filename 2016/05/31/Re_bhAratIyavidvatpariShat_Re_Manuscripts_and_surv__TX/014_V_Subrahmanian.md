Is there any textual authority for the above conclusion? For, in the Brahma sutra bhashya for 3.4.44,45 and 46, I understand that the conclusion is that since the priest is commissioned (by payment) by the Yajamana (Swamin), the fruit of the chanting (upasana) goes to the latter and not to the priest even though he does the upasana (on behalf of the yajamana). Here are the relevant pages:

<http://www.bharatadesam.com/spiritual/brahma_sutra/brahma_sutra_sankara_38255.php>  

  

Even though the above case is of upasana, I think the idea involved is same.

  

I am open to correction, though.

  

warm regards
