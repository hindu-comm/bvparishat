Sir, this is a genuine case but the present Jain case is where the copyists are employed for the purpose. They cannot be put in any of the categories above.

  

I am also reminded of the famous story of Vālmiki where Narada asks him to ask his familiy members whether they would share the sin arising out of his indulgence in dacoity. They say they will not share his sin; they are there only to enjoy the means he provides for their survival. This is a case where the family is not willfully encouraging the sinful act.
