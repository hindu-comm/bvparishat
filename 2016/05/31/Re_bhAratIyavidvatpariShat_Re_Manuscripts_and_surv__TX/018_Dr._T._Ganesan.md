In the ancient text, Sivadharma, 12: 123 (still unpublished) we find this passage according to which the person who imparts the dharma, he who facilitates ? such imparting of dharma, the performer of the dharma, he who makes him perform (aides in his performance?) and he who protects such dharma and the performer--all these five persons--get equal fruit.  
  

उपदेष्टानुमन्ता च कर्ता कारयिता च यः ।

    कृतानुपालकश्चैव पञ्च तुल्यफलाः स्मृताः ।  
  
Another passage, Ibid. 12: 126ab: दातुरप्यधिकं पुण्यं तद्दत्तं योऽनुपालयेत् ।  
clearly sates that the person who protects (any donatio or endowment )gets more puNya than the donor himself.  
  
Thus another passage, 12: 127  
     

तस्मादुपदिशेद्धर्मं स्वयं वापि समाचरेत् ।

कारयेदनुमन्येत कृतमन्यश्च पालयेत् ।

  
advises one to perform any of the five acts mentioned in the aforementioned passage.  
  
In this connection one is reminded of the ancient Pasupata concept and practice according to which the Pasupata follower behaving in a demeaning way in public and thereby inviting the public censure, gets the puNya of the individual (s) who censures him, which is transfer of merit from one person to another.
