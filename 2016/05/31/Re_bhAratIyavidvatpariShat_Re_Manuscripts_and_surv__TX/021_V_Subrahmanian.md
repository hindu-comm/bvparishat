That is because both the hirer and the hired know very well that killing is a criminal offence. Even in the shāstraic sense it is incumbent upon everyone to be aware of 'mā himsyāt sarvā bhūtāni'.

Actually only because one is hired to perform an upāsana on behalf of the yajamāna it is ruled that the phalam goes to the former and not the latter. If it were not for the fact that certain karma-s are possible only by employing others, this question about who is the real doer (the hirer or the hired) and who really gets the phalam would not be discussed: Brahmasutra bhashya 3.4.44-46:
