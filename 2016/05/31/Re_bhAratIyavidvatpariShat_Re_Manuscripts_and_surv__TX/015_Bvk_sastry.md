On Prof. Bijoy Mishras observation  

  
\< The topic to ponder is when does material become a treasure and how does one preserve a "treasure."  
Should a material be found a thousand years from now for whatever purpose? It is a relevant debate.>  
  

If this may be articulated differently, who will make an investment on a ' manuscript of tradition' and why?  
  
For a museum model art- collector, the media of manuscript, its antiquity and rarity is the ' treasure-possession value'. Example: Mona-lisa art scroll, dead see scrolls, palm leaf on which sarvamoolagrantha was scribed.  
  
For an Education institution, the treasure is matter on the media ! Teachers to teach the subject matter are dispensable people!  
  
For a seeker, the ' treasure' is the vision in the matter- language. Neither the media or antiquity bothers. It does not matter whether mahabharata was written with an iron stylus or a broken tusk! The message is critical.  
  
The profound issue in Mishra jis post is drawing attention to the need of balancing investments in digital document archiving with education- research teaching content in the media. And that has greater relevance to Vedas, which preferred a totally non- material media of voice to survive!
