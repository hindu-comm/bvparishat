Without discounting the obvious benefits of the digitisation (and/or  
printing digital hard copies if needed), the परम्परा of "literally"  
writing an ancient text cannot be brushed away by looking at the  
quantity of sheets written. It is important to retain the लेखनपरम्परा  
even if it appears anachronistic for the purposes of बीजरक्षा. Also,  
the influence of the आदर and नैरन्तर्य shown by these "skilled  
writers" (लिपिकारs) on sustaining the energy and spirit of the  
tradition they are re-scribing, is HUGE.  
  
I am sure others in this thread did not undermine any of these but  
were emphasising the need to use an efficient method, without  
completely replacing the original idea.  
  
Of course, the perspective of पुण्य, mentioned by Ajit-ji cannot be  
ignored either:  
  
गाङ्गमङ्गलतरङ्गभङ्गदप्रान्तसुश्रिहरिवेश्मकृत्समः।  
यद्गतैकतमवर्णलेखकः सत्यतीर्थ इह भाष्यमालिखत् ।। इति श्रीमध्वविजये।
