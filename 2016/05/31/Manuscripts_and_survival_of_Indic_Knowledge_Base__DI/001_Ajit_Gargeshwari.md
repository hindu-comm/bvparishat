A great effort all need to appreciate. I hope they have photographed or scanned the originals first and then are rewriting so that scribal and other errors will be reduced. I do understand they are being proof read. The originals too need to be preserved. By rewriting the life span will be increased by 500-600 years but digitizing it will be perpetual and for ever.
