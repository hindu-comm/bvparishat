It is a good thing to preserve manuscripts, but the idea of rewriting manuscripts in an age where computing and digital printing are commonplace is anachronistic. If reproduction of manuscripts as hard copies is indeed required, why not digitize the manuscripts and print ten copies using digital printing at a fraction of the effort? The time spent in rewriting 6,500 manuscripts could be better used to digitize and proofread many more.



“Bhojane boasts of rewriting three sheets, 11.5 cm cross 5.5 cm, everyday \[sic\].”



Is it really the best use of the skills of a 73-year old skilled ‘writer’ to rewrite all but three sheets in a day? How many words would the three sheets have?



“What we are writing today will last for at least 500 years. The machine-printed books, on the other hand, won’t even last 50 years.”



Except that 200, 500, or even more copies of the machine printed books can be reprinted any time for distributions. What use are single copies of rewritten manuscripts locked in a library today when all manuscripts are being digitized and made freely available?



PS: The single word “everyday” is an adjective, while the two words “every day” form an adverbial phrase. In the quoted sentence, an adverb is needed and hence it should be “every day.”
