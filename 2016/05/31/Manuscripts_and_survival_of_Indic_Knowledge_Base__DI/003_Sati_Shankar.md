Preservation is very important, but with rapidly changing technologies and world power structure there is a danger involved.

What if its access is restricted, or suddenly deleted from data centers, or pushed back in priority search?

How many of us go and read 100000'th page of search?

India is guru in software development but a search for a book in our digital library of India is pathetic.

These are a few practical problems which should be kept in mind while digital preservation is talked.

  

With all the environment, space and cost related drawbacks, preservation in material should not be ignored, it is these that are making us aware and surviving,

Sati Shankar
