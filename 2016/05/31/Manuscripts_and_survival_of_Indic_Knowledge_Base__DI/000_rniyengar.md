There is so much noise made about Sanskrit and Science, history, mathematics.......& what not by MHRD, political parties and others. But many good things go unnoticed and unreported in this vast country with myriad cultures. Still, occasionally it is heartening to know that some people are actually practicing what they preach. I found this article interesting.
