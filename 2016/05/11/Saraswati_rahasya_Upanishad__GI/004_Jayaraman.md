Namaste Swamiji  
  
This upanishad is not to be searched in the Taittirya Shakha - samhita, aranyaka, brahmana or upanishads.  
It is not there.  
  
I found a pdf of the source -  
<http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_upanishhat/sarasvati_upan.pdf>  
  
Looking at the contents it seems to be a later text attributed to Krishnayajurveda.  
But one is not sure whether is can be found in other branches of Krishnayajur veda like Katha, Maitrayaneeya etc.
