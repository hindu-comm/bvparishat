The above Upanishad is listed as part of 108 Upanishads. It is of the KY. Whether it is in the current adhyayana sampradaya is not known. It is very likely that Upanishad Brahmayogin's commentary is available for this too.

  

You can download the entire 108 upanishads with the above Acharya's commentary from archives.
