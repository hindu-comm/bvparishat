Although the muktikopanishat lists sarasvatIrahasya as belonging to KYV, the published text has the Rgveda SAnti mantra (vA^n me manasi pratishThitA), not Saha nAvavatu or Sanno mitraH. And there are quite a few Rca-s pertaining to sarasvatI and vAk taken up for discussion in the beginning of this upanishat. So, searching in Rg-brAhmaNa portions may also be useful, although I think that for many of these minor texts, such searches may well be fruitless.

Namaskaras,
