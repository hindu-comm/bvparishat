Dear Sir,

Thank you for the reply. I got the commentary of Upanishad Brahmayogin. But he starts his commentary from 46th mantra only.

If I can know where in the KY Veda the Upanishad occurs, I can refer to Sayana bhasyam. I have Sayana Bhasyam with me. I want to know the location only.

Thank you in advance.
