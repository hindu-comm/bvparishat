Dear List members,

  

The 'Scholars for People' have made a massive submission (see attached) to the California State Board of Education & the Instructional Quality Commission (attached) REBUTTING the arguments of US Marxists/Hinduphobic scholars ('SAFG') that

  

1\. "There was no India before 1947",

2\. "It is debatable if Hinduism is an organized faith even today",

3\. and their other attempts to erase India, Hinduism, Hindu Dalit Heritage from US history textbooks.

  

These Marxist/Hinduphobic/India-Bashing 'scholars' also want to replace the use of India with 8 other terms like 'Islamic Civilization', 'Islamic World'.

  

In the context of 9-11 terror attack on the US, they want the school textbooks (for grades 6, 7 and 10 in California) to instead talk about 'extremism in Hinduism, Buddhism..." etc.! They want to rob the Valmiki Dalit Hindu community of Rishi Valmiki's legacy by removing his name from the textbooks. They are also opposing the Indian and Hindu organizations' attempts to highlight the contributions and achievements of Kannada, Telugu and Tamil language speakers; and want to pit South Indians against North Indians; Sanskrit against Dravidian languages; Dalit Hindus against other Hindus.

  

Additionally, these Leftists term the Baburnama as a 'humanistic work' (one wonders if invader Babar were a humanist, what would we call Guru Nanak who decried his violent invasions in the Shri Guru Granth Sahib?). All of their suggestions are designed to demean and dehumanize Hindus and Hinduism, and erase India altogether (with terms favoring Pakistan and Islam). They have singled out India and Hinduism for this negative treatment.

  

It is not out of place to mention that a prominent List Member also played the role of a Gungadin/ Gurundocchishta-bhoji in the past, to wage ideological battles on the hearts of our 10 year old children through our school textbooks. You all know who he is.  

  

Attached is the full document that was submitted. See in particular the covering note, and Appendices A and B.  
  

We need to create public pressure in order to be effective and to force them to review it (they have ignored previous submissions by other Hindu groups). Time is of the essence, the hearing is on May 19th.  
  

**Would you be willing to add your name as a supporting scholar? Please let me know. Please mention your discipline of specialization, and professional affiliations at various universities (if any).PLEASE WRITE TO ME OFFLINE and do not reply to the entire list.**  

  

Best Regards,
