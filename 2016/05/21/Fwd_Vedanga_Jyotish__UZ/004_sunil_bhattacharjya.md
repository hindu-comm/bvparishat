Vedanga Jotisha has to be as old as the Vedas as a knowledge of the Veganga jyotisha is essential for study of the Vedas. Further the Vedanga Jyotisha is the most important Vedanga, The Suryasiddhanta claims itself to be the Vedanga jyotisha and this claim appears to be genuine, from what it writes about itself in the beginning of the text. It claims to be written in the Treta Yuga and that means it could not have been originally composed later than the time of composition of the Ramayana.  

  

On the other hand the Vedanga jyotisha as compiled by a later author, who mentions Lagadha in third person, and there is no mention of Lagadha in any of the Vedic texts anywhere nor in any of the ancient astronomical texts .It refers to astronomical events of mid-Second millennium BCE, but it could have been written much later than that by one named Suchi.
