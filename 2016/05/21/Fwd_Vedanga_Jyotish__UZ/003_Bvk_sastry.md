Namaste

  

1\. Vedanga Jyotish is not a separate discipline or text different from ' jyotish'

  

2\. Vedanga jyotish is one integral discipline which is studied in parts like: Ganitha,phal jyotisha, muhurtha, parihara. These are top line tags.

Many specialities and sub-disciplines emerge as branches here.

  

3\. In a modern education system, analogy, the top line starting with Science, the specialists emerge as isolated blocks which do not see the big picture or have handshake process across disciplines. This is the status in vedic disciplines where vedanga jyotisha as a top line discipline under Veda- Vidyas is seen in narrow lens of ' street practice astrology by bird picking up leaf'. This is an incorrect approach to study vedanga jyotisha and needs correction through education.
