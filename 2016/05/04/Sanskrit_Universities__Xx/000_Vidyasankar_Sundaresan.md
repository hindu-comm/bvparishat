Is there a proposal for three new universities or is it about funding of existing Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan campuses?

"In a report submitted to the Lok Sabha, the ministry said the government is funding three Sanskrit Deemed Universities. Two of them will be in Delhi, the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan and Sri Lal Bahadur Shastri Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha and one in Tirupati, the Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha."

  

Best regards,
