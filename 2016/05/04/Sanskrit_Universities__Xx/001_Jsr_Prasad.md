Dear Vidyasankar Ji,  
  

Again it seems the mis-representation of the facts by press. All three are independent Universities. Ms. Irani must be aware of the two existing Sanskrit Universities in Delhi, if not the one in Tirupati. Funding higher education institutions is a policy matter of the ministry, any government has to invariably support it.  
  

Regards,  

Prasad
