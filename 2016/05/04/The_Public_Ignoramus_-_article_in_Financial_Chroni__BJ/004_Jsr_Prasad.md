Thanks to Prof. Michel Danino for sharing this wonderful piece. It is well articulated while exposing the misdeeds of pseudo secularists. Subsequently, it attracted responses from eminent Sanskrit scholars like Prof. G.C. Tripathi.  
  
For those, who are yet to read the article sent by Prof. Michel Danino, here is the gist:  

-   Prof. Michel starts his article by quoting the MHRD's suggestion to
    teach Sanskrit in IITs. -   He tries to show that if Sanskrit is not needed in IITs, then it
    equally applies to other subjects, like history. -   Cultural and historical importance of artifacts like 'Rani ka vav'
    on par with Egyptian pyramids, Japanese Pagoda etc. A course on
    Indian Knowledge Systems at Gandhinagar was taught by 9 scholars. -   JNU's futile efforts to start courses on Indian culture and Yoga and
    biased views of School of Language, Literature and Culture studies. -   Congress government's recommendation of the intensive study of
    Sanskrit thorough its National Policy on Education (1986). And
    subsequent court judgment on teaching Sanskrit is not against the
    secular fabric of India. -   Wonderful examples on all science not western, but equally from vast
    Indian knowledge corpus. -   Various Indian branch of sciences and problem of its non-inheritance
    to next generations. Here, he argues that, consequentially,
    ignorance of knowledge traditions, caused lack of self confidence
    and cross-disciplinary thinking is also lost. -   Various Sanskrit research/related activities in IITs at Roorkee,
    Kanpur, Bombay, Kharagpur and Gandhinagar. -   At the end of the article, Prof. Michel aptly concludes - '*Let the
    thali of Indian culture be offered to them, and let them be free to
    accept or reject this or that dish - but after tasting it*.'

Before they could give their response after tasting it, I've already relished this expression, joyfully!  

  
I think, our neighboring country China is a parallel example to India, in context of self developed indigenous science and technology. Because, Joseph Needham in his multi-volume work, 'Science and Civilization in China' (1950) pointed out that west was blissfully unaware of the scientific advancements of China in things ranging from gun powder to mechanical printing etc. His 'Needham's question' become famous since then.  
  

But, there are two things here -  
  

\- China enjoys unstinting support from its communist government. I think, no one is interested to question the authenticity of the Chinese indigenous achievements in the name of 'Chinese Scholars/Studies.'  
  

\- No political intervention or twisting of facts is seen, to belittle their own achievements.  

  
- No band of foreign scholars invaded their intellectual space to refute Chinese achievements till 15th C.  
  

In case of India, it is the other way round! Some *deshabhaktas* always look forward to insult, ridicule the greatness of our mother land.  

  

However, it is a different case, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and martial arts have drawn heavily from Indian knowledge bank of Ayurveda and Yoga.  
  

Reards,
