Dear Tapati,



I agree one hundred percent with your posting. Yudhisthira Mimaamsaka said in his books that in the ancient time the kshetra of use of Sanskrit was much wider beyond the borders of the subcontinent. Research is required. Thanks. N.R.Joshi

Postings by Sri Joshi and Sri Hegde are both interesting. But it is India which has preserved Sanskrit in its original form till date and still scholars study various scriptures in Sanskrit, it is also used in daily life of people here on different occasions, whereas we find
vikriti of varnas as we travel to West and further beyond to different lands.  
In Ancient times, the expand of the land where Sanskrit originated was not limited to present landscape of India, it must have been a larger area as described in Ancient literature in Sanskrit.  
To establish the original home of Sanskrit, a restructuring of Indian history may be the need of the day.
