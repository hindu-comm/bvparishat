Great food for thought is offered by Sri Sunil ji and Sri Damodara Das ji. Actions speak louder than words. Congrats to Damodara ji for practical establishinh of the social system based on 'guNas' in his village.

With regard to the comment on equality of women with men, there could be a distinction at genetic level itself, in both. As, semen is said to be 'आग्नेय' and ovum is 'सौम्य' in nature. 'रजस्' is predominant in women whereas 'सत्त्वम्' is the dominant guNa in men. Of course, there can be exceptions to this always.
