Namaste Prof. Prasadji,  
  

Yes, Prof. Kannaji did not want to run away and that is why he gave the second set of questions in his mail to BVP. If we look at it carefully, we will see that the second set of questions was, in fact, embedded in the first set of questions also. What I meant by saying that we should not run away, is that (having already decided to deal with the second set of quesions) Prof Kannnji should not back out, for the fear that whatever he wrote may be twisted by the other party. However, if the opponents continue to be belligerent, the question of strategic planning to deal with them may arise subsequently.  
  

Regards,
