\> I would be happy if some of our list members can consider these and suggest some good answers (and if possible with good references).

  

------- Good or not I shall try to respond to these questions.

  

1\. Sanskrit---> Caste---->slavery or slavery-like social practices

  

"Caste---->slavery or slavery-like social practices"

is beyond the scope of the Sanskrit related discussion that all this intended to be and beyond the scope of the forum.

  

Iposted my arguments negating "Sanskrit---> Caste"

  

2\. Interviewer:You did not give me a direct answer on whether caste system had contributed to the lack of numbers among Sanskrit speakers in the country. Would urge you to please answer that directly.

  

----- Direct answer: No.

Details: Lack of numbers among speakers probably means a drastic fall in the number of Sanskrit speakers. First of all as per Prof. Pollock, Sanskrit was just a liturgical language, never a general spoken language. If we go with this for the sake of argument, how can the number fall from zero ? According tothe interviewer himself, "It is also well known that the use of Sanskrit was limited to sections of the society, broadly labelled as upper castes; and that the history of exclusion and marginalisation in India is closely linked to the manner in which access to Sanskrit was controlled in the past". If there is a drastic fall in the number of Sanskrit speakers, it means "sections of the society, broadly labelled as upper castes" are the ones who gave up Sanskrit speaking. It is difficult to understand how caste system contributed to sections of the society, broadly labelled as upper castes givingup Sanskrit speaking. As per 'the history of exclusion and marginalisation in India is closely linked to the manner in which access to Sanskrit was controlled in the past', I already showed how this is a wrong perception of the past picture of language speaking in India.
There I argued that as long as the mutual intelligibility between Sanskrit and Prakrits was intact,it is absurd to imagine Prakrit speakers trying to learn Sanskrit and they being stopped from learning.

Here the interviewer's argument seems to be Sanskrit ----> Caste -------> Lack of numbers among Sanskrit speakers. i.e., Sanskrit is in the course of suicideby means ofcaste created by itself. Leaving aside the veracity of such an argument, since Sanskrit is our focus,

Caste -------> Lack of numbers among Sanskrit speakers is not our concern for the present. We have already shown that

Sanskrit ----> Caste is wrong.

  

3\. 'Access' to modern school education: The Beautiful Tree: Indigenous Indian Education in the Eighteenth Century

by Dharampal :"This major work entitled "The Beautiful Tree" provides evidence from extensive early British administrators’ reports of the widespread prevalence of educational institutions in the Bengal and Madras Presidencies as well as in the Punjab, teaching a sophisticated curriculum, with daily school attendance by about 30% of children aged 6–15, where those belonging to communities who were classed as Shudras or even lower constituted a good number of students, and in some areas, for instance in Kerala, where Muslim girls were quite well represented." From [a review](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17931651-the-beautiful-tree)

As far as British education is concerned, that it is more a sociological issue of occupational shift is evident from the resistance to admission into schools found across the length and breadth of the country, even among orthodox Brahmin families.How herculean atask it has been to persuade people to admit their children into schools has been well documented.

4\. The beaten track 'glorification of Kings' /monarchy issue in the next post.
