Sri Senani's comment has a stance. It may be that Prof. Kannan is running out of time due to his academic commitments, but, not certainly running away from questions. He would not have brought forward the second set, to the notice of the group, had he thought of evading them. We can reduce his burden of thinking over these, by looking into each question, thoroughly. I think, we are already doing that. Later, Prof. Kannan may take well-meant views that suits his thinking.  
  
In the beginning of thread, Prof. Kannan declared that he had apprehensions about his position might be misrepresented by filtered quoting.  

  

Thanks
