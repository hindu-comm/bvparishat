I can also add that the दिग्दर्शिनी commentary by सनातन गोस्वामी on हरिभक्तिविलास 1.47-55 starting with एवं विप्र एव गुरुः स्यादित्यायातम्states that only a Brahmin can be a Guru for all, and gives a hierarchy on who can give mantra to whom. Does this not show that what you call as misconception (Varna based on birth) is what Sanatana and Jiva Gosvami stated in their commentaries?
