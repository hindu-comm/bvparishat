Respected All,  
  
Few first thoughts with respect to the following question by ET:

  
  
3. You did not give me a direct answer on whether caste system had contributed to the lack of numbers among Sanskrit speakers in the country. Would urge you to please answer that directly.   

  

This question is entwined with two issues. 1. anatomical structure of caste system in society and 2. its so-called oppressive effect on number of Sanskrit speakers. Let us keep aside the first issue and concentrate on the second for a moment.  
  

The media hype related to number of Sanskrit speakers in our land, is based on Census of India. This is being updated since 1971. Latest survey done was in the year 2011, but we are yet to see the statistics. In a chart of '*comparative speaker's strength between 1971-2001*, given by the MoH at its [website](http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_Data_Online/Language/Statement5.aspx), following are the details available:  

Persons who returned their language as mother tongue:

  

|              |       |       |        |        | |--------------|-------|-------|--------|--------| | Language     | 1971  | 1981  | 1991   | 2001   | | **Sanskrit** | 2,212 | 6,106 | 49,736 | 14,135 |

Now, let us see the contrast with our national language:

  

|           |             |             |             |             | |-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------| | Language  | 1971        | 1981        | 1991        | 2001        | | **Hindi** | 202,767,971 | 257,749,009 | 329,518,087 | 422,048,642 |

When there has been steady increase in the number of Sanskrit speakers since 1971, how come the number dwindled to 14,135, suddenly in 2001? In contrast to this, there has been steady increase in case of Hindi. Also, another analysis with regard to the *percentage of number of speakers* to total population is as follows:

**Sanskrit**: 1971  1981  1991  2001  
 N\*  N 0.01  N  

  
\*N = negligible  
  

**Hindi**: 1971  1981  1991  2001  
 36.99 38.74 39.29 41.03  
  

So, these are the magic figures that decide the existence of Sanskrit speakers in our country.  
  
Now, the question is how many people wanted to register their mother tongue as 'Sanskrit' in the census forms distributed over all these years. In the 2011 [census form](http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011-Schedule/Shedules/Hindi_HH_Side_A_NT.pdf) column numbers 10 and 11 ask us to specify 'mother tongue' and any two other known languages, respectively.  
  
But when I filled the form in 2011 to be handed over to the census staff, I could not see column number 11. (it's a different case, we could have manipulated the data by writing Sanskrit as mother tongue in column 10).  

  

Is the mechanism of collecting all important data through census is accurate? Why not Linguistic Survey of India or Central Institute of Indian Languages compile the data on native speakers of respective languages. I heard from a friend that through Samskrita Bharati moment, there are at least hundred thousand Sanskrit speakers now in India. Why that number doesn't appear in the census? For that matter, Rashtriya Sanskrit Samsthan can prepare a format and distribute to all Sanskrit teaching institutions (including NGOs) to collect the exact census of Sanskrit speakers in India. Is that too difficult? Can the government take any initiative in this direction?  
  

In ancient India, forget about documenting number of Sanskrit speakers, our ancestors not even worried about attributing creative works to self but rather attributed them to their Guru or a famous kavi/śāstrakāra.  
  

When the above technical process found to be correct/incorrect, then only the oppressive effect of caste on number of Sanskrit speakers, can be addressed properly. For your comments please.  
  

Regards,  

Prasad
