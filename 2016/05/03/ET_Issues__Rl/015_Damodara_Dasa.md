Hare Krishna.  
Respected Nityanandaji,  
  
Thankyou very much for raising this question. I was expecting someone  
to raise this question so that more of in depth discussion can go on  
to dig deep in to the root of the matter. I am now compiling a small  
document in reply to this for the perusal of scholars in this group.  
It may take a couple of days and thus I beg pardon for not be able to  
participate in this discussion till then.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
