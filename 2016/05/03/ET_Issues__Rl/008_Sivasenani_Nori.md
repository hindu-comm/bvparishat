The problem with modern media is that power has corrupted them. It is patently unjust that in scholarly matters, non-scholar journalists and editors want to take the final call. I don't know if journalists of an earlier realized this power vested in them and approached with care and humility, but anecdotal evidence from the last decade or so is that media people actually relish it, abuse it and have institutionalized it. Even a low-ranking person such as a driver of a media van throws his weight around! Reports of blackmail by journalists have become so common that nobody blinks an eye about it any longer. "Earlier we had a naxal problem, now we have a journalist problem - and we will deal with them" seems to be response.

  

Anyhow, coming back to journalists arrogating the position of arbiters to themselves, I think scholars should first pose a "balance-test" to any journalist who approaches them. Either directly or indirectly know the views of the journalist and engage with them only if they are genuinely balanced (or sympathetic). Any rejection to engage must specifically state that if at all the scholar's name is quoted saying that he refused, it must be stated that the refusal is based on lack of confirmation of neutrality of the journalist in question. Alternately, the scholar may offer to write a column stating his views within broad word-limits.

  

It is easier said than done to refuse an offer to appear in a paper with large circulation (everybody has an obligation to serve the organization they are working for by giving it as much publicity as possible), but when it is realized that the very purpose of contact by these unethical journalists is to further an agenda specifically by besmirching one's name, it might be done. For instance, any answer to the second set of questions can be twisted to portray Prof. Kannan in a bad light. The alternate strategy is to take an explicitly worded opposite stance such as "Pollock's real agenda is to kill Hinduism by distorting history and by anchoring your article in such a person's view, you are furthering the same agenda. Please come and attend the seminar on Pollock and then we can discuss the answers in detail."

  

In fact it is said that Swami Chinmayananda was a sceptical journalist in his purvashrama, got such an invitation to study Bhagavadgita first, and the rest is history.
