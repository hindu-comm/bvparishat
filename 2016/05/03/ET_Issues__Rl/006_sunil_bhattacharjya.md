Dear Prof. Kannanji and friends,  
  

It is an irony that the supporters of Sheldon Pollock (to whom the Murtys have given the responsibility of translating the Ramayana, in preference to the Indian scholars), are raising the issue of the so-called caste system and that shows that Sheldon Pollock is totally unaware as to when and how the ancient Indian society itself felt the necessity to have the division of work-responsbilities on people depending on their ability and aptitude, even though the Ramayana itself had discussed this issue in detail. This is the so-called
superficial scholarship od Sheldon Pollock.  
  
Tthe Varna system (not the British-created caste system) was unanimously welcomed by one and all in the ancient society in the Treta yuga, as that was evolved solely for the good of the society. Obviously, the able-bodied people with aptitude for administration and martial activity became the Kshatriyas. As they looked afer the rule of law, they became the most powerful section of the society. and a glamorous lifestyles went with that too.  
  
Another section included those who could look after trade and business activities and they became the Vaishyas. Because of their nature of occupation they became the rich class of the society, in keeping with the adage"*Vanijye Vasati Lakshmi".*  
  

The Kshatriyas as well as the Vaishyas needed to be given the general education as well as the speciality training for their occupation and that onerous task went the section who were more interested in knowledge and education as well as in teaching, than in gaining personal authority and wealth. They had to live an austere life and their boys were sent to the gurukul for studying under the guru, at an early age of 7 to 8 years. The boys had to live in the ashram for their studies and the serve the guru for as long as 12 years or at times more than that. Eventually the brahmins became the poorest of the lot.  
  

The remainng section of the people did not have the ability and the aptitude to qualify for the work responsibilities given to the Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and the Brahmins and they were called the Shudras. Being unskilled or semi-skilled they were given the responsibilities of "Paricharyaa", and in cases they became the personal or domestic or professional helpers or attendents of the Kshatriyas and the Vaishyas (and not of the brahmins, though falsely alleged by the westerners and their misguided Indian followers). There could have been stary cases where some of the shudras could have been ill-treated by the people, whom they attended to, but that was never by the brahmins, whom the shudras did not attend to..  
  

The Varna system was not absolutely rigid and there has been cases where people like Satyakam were initiated to be brahmin and Vishwamitra, a Kshatiya king could become a Brahmin rishi. Further, the Rigveda has the example, where the same family had the members with different work-responsibilities, appropriate for different varnas..The system of slavery, where the slaves are maltreated, has been the sole legacy of the western society and never of the Indian society. Megasthenes, who came to India more than two thousand and three hundred years ago, did not notice a servant-class in India. The so-called caste system was a creation in paper by the British administration for their census records.  
  

The Indian society followed the rules of dharma as enshrined in the different smritis respectively appropriate for the different periods of time. The first Smriti was the Manu Smriti, which was for the earliest Indian society, thousands of years ago. The ignorant and the anti-indian people use the Manu Smriti as the punching bag, even though the Manu Smriti has never been for these days and not even for the Mahabharata times, some five thousand years ago. .  
  

This discussion will not be complete. without mentioning that there were some people who had to be legally ousted from the society for their grave actions highly injurious to the public welfare and morals and harmful to the state and they had to legally banished or ousted.for limited period or even for life dependinding on the gravity of their actions. In one case, even the great Gautama rishi was ousted from the society for many years and he was taken back in the society only after he did lomg penance.  
  

Hope this will make the intelligent people understand the baseless allegations of the anti-Sanskrit groups and realize that Sanskrit has no role to play in these false allegations against the Hindu society in India.

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
