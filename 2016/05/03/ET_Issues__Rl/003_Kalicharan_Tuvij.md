नमस्ते,  
  
(not intended as a direct answer)  
  
In a battle of wits the more intelligent and resourceful usually have an unassailable advantage. Importantly, they are in a position to institute reward-incentive system (the basis of nearly all human activity). Their idea is to outwit the opposition, and eliminate them or constrain their aspirations ("put them in place"). This almost sounds fair and natural, mirroring the more brutal (honest?) ways (as we have discovered of late) the Homo sapiens won over, and indeed eliminated, other human-ancestries.  
  
Accentuating the fault lines (which we know all societies have had), driving wedges among unsuspecting people, and other more subtle tactics, are some of the methods for implementing the important corollary - "elimination of the stupid" - of the main theorem "survival of the fittest".  
  
This is पूर्वपक्ष, and so the उत्तरपक्ष : what should be the response?  
  
The default response is already known. A BVP member in another thread inadvertently characterised the opponents' side as "liberal". Should this mean that our position is that of being illiberals and regressives (though the member most likely meant "conservative")? This can be, principally, understood as a Brahminical response : "we will continue to stick to our traditions, just like we did in past". After all, we survived many previous onslaughts by sticking by the side of indigenous traditions, didn't we?  
  
Conservatives are needed: they are the safest bet, the repository, of indigenous knowledge systems - in face of the disruptive, persistent, fad called modernity.  
  
However, this is defiance, not response. And the conservatives have historically constituted at the best only the half of the story.  
  
There is nothing conservative in "pornographic art" seen all over the ("sacred") temples and the caves, just to give an example. Traditions are - have always been - furthered by more innovation, and not by more tradition. Innovators have been our tallest leaders and authorities, not the (highly respected) traditionalists.  
  
The response should be : (visioning) more innovation. Safety, paradoxically, lies in uncertainty.  
  
A rediscovery of our lost basics is the right response, but is also an innovation. As an example, let me cite two of the deepest anchors of Indian Thought :  
  
A) Indra drinking Soma, and  
B) Sudas Paijavana, the Vedic Chakravartin, being of Shudra.  
  
Here, A) belong to abstract realms, and in my opinion is deeper than anything humanity has come up thus far (inclusive of material sciences). For the present context, however, let us dwell upon the latter anchor point, B).  
  
That a Vedic leader was Shudra can only mean that "Shudra" means some thing else altogether. Purusha Sukta has been long shown to be a post Vedic addition - being of a late Sanskritic orientation, trying to depose Vedic deity Aditi as the overarching deity of the pantheon.  
  
To say the least, a Shudra was not - never has been - the "serving Varna". So the question is, do we need organised research to find out this, or do we need apologists' explaining, "..but the Varna was merit based and anyone could become Brahmin".  
  
Labelling people - on merit or any other yardstick of hierarchy - is immoral, period.  
  
Even Hollywood movies are better than us in attacking some of these questions ("The Divergent, 2014").  
  
To summarise, responding in terms of categories (liberal, conservatives, left, right, etc) or fault lines (castes, driving wedge) drawn by our opponents in the war of wits is a self-defeating approach. The correct response is: embracing uncertainty, and a liberal research driven build up. One of the parameters success would be gaged by is the number of breakthroughs and innovations worked by non-Brahmin (female, minority, tribal, Dalit) researchers of Sanskrit in the present and the future. It was Dr Ambedkar, after all who was the first to write about the anchor B) mentioned above.  
  
The nature of problem is structural, and needs more than quoting texts. At the same time, this very structural depth, because of its synthetic nature, can prove to be inviting to some of the very best of Indian talent in future. This uncertainty is our only answer.
