Namaste Sivasenaniji,  
  

Your wrote

  
  
\<For instance, any answer to the second set of questions can be twisted to portray Prof. Kannan in a bad light>.  
  

In my opinion, Prof. Kannan should not run away without sending a proper reply to the questions raised in the second set. If he considers what I wrote as sufficient he can send the same, with or without any additional points. It is quite possible that the journalist himself is a victim of false propaganda and further, there could be other people /authority behind the particular journalist and they could be deciding what to publish and what not to.  
  

Your fear that whatever one writes may be twisted, seems to be too far-fetched. If that really happens, there will always be an opportunity to give a fitting response. In a battle of wit no BVP member can be ignored easily.
