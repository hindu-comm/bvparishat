Sir,

May I submit that "run away" is not appropriate with respect to a scholar who is organizing a seminar to counter the poison being spread by Pollock and his ilk?

I would suggest that "strategic retreat" or "considered refusal to engage" is a better choice. If we avoid offensive phrases, it would be easier to get focus on your main point that it is better to engage.
