Dear All,

  

I am thankful to you all for your comments and suggestions,

and more importantly, your concern for the cause.

  

Howsoever well and appositely may we respond,

the press, with its present predilections and proclivities,

is but bound to distort. We cannot afford to forget this.

They are worth responding to only if they undertake to print

the whole set of questions and the whole set of answers.

  

So then, just as the other camp has its own platform(s) to propagate its ideas,

we shall have our own, too. Rather than reply hurriedly and prematurely

to their probing queries and teeming teasers,

let us build/strengthen scholarship on our own side first - the tougher task, though it be!

The conference series aims at that - as its top priority business.

  

Let our actions speak.

Let our well-produced volumes (ie in terms of content) speak:

***kriyA kevalam uttaram !***

***  
***

Whatever the agenda - latent or patent - of the Western Indologists be,

blazing trails whether of European or American Orientalism,

they have nevertheless set enviable academic standards - by no means fit to be ignored.

And further, howsoever their fashions may change, their "designs" remain the same!

  

Rather than getting entrapped, therefore, in the clutches of their paradigms and parameters,

we must endeavour to regenerate and rejuvenate our own time-honoured criteria

in evaluating, edifying, and ennobling civilisational attitudes

\- all products of little else than hard work.

  

It is then that the maxim of Manu (2.20) can come true again :

***etad-des'a-prasUtasya***

***  sakAs'Ad agrajanmanaH /***

***svam svam caritram s'iks"eran***

***  pRthivyAm sarva-mAnavAH //;***

as, too, the aspiration of the Awake :

***bahu-jana-hitAya***

***bahu-jana-sukhAya.***

***  
***

My prolixity please be excused.

  

KSKannan
