To continue the story, Economic Times followed up my answers with another set of questions. **I did not reply** for two reasons : I was busy with some urgent work, and I also had apprehensions my position might be misrepresented by filtered quoting.

  

These are loaded questions, and require loaded answers.

I would be happy if some of our list members can consider these and suggest some good answers (and if possible with good references).

  

No more are "they" ignoring us. They are sitting up and taking notice. Hereafter we are going to face more and more questions - many from our own people.

Thank you for sending me a reply.

  

I am sending you my take on your replies and would request you to please respond to the additional facts i have to offer :

On 1 and 2. You said: "While slavery was prevalent in many parts of the world, many historians have declared that there was no slavery worth the name in India." - How do you assess, label or rank untouchability, manual scavenging and bonded labour - all of which has been recorded as practices associated with the caste system? If such practices do not signify mental and physical slavery, what does?

  

3\. You did not give me a direct answer on whether caste system had contributed to the lack of numbers among Sanskrit speakers in the country. Would urge you to please answer that directly.

On English: Isn't caste a factor that restricted access to schools and English education even during the early decades after gaining Independence to those labelled lower castes? Or are you saying that every citizen of India had free and equal access to schools for all since Independence; that there was no difference between an upper or lower caste person wanting to study English ? There is evidence to prove that caste restricted access to both Sanskrit as well as English.Please do clarify. 

  

4.On Monarchy- the context of Sanskrit is relevant only in India. I would have appreciated it if you would have argued to the point.

Why would i connect Sanskrit with Arab world? That does not sound logical at all.   

  

I would like to repeat the question here so that we are more clear.

  

Prof Pollock records several instances of Sanskrit being used to glorify Kings in INDIA (Language of Gods) ; i was actually wanting to know whether you have come across this argument specifically, which has a strictly Indian context, and what your response is to the same?

  

The interesting aspect here is that as per Prof Pollock's narrative -
in the beginning Sanskrit was the language of liturgy and the denial of access to all people was on account of a notion of worthiness which was again defined by background.The same language is later appropriated by the royalty and moves into the arena of the political. This is a significant observation because - as per this narrative - the Kings were taking advantage of the fact that the language commanded a history of reverence among people who - despite their own inability to understand the language - connected it with divinity. So royalty was drawing upon the common man's reverence for the divine by using Sanskrit.

  

The gaining of freedom in 1947 and guarantee of equal rights surely gives us the necessary bandwidth to look at the past and wonder why all were not equal in the past and to critique the far less libertarian system of monarchy. And if that system relied on the language that commanded a spiritual connect toperpetuateitself, .is it not important to ask whether this was ethical ?

  

Thank you for sharing your views with me. I am seeking clarifications from you only so that i gain a straight and direct response to the points i made.
