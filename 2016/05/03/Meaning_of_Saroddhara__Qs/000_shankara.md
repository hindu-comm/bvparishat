Pranams to all,

  

I wish to know the meaning of 'Saroddhara' found in book titles such as Garuda Purana Saroddhara, Sangitopanishat Saroddhaara, Katyayana Smriti Saroddhara, etc. Does Saroddhara mean that the new work is an adapted version of the original text or merely selections or quotes from it?  



regards  
shankara
