Respected scholars, Namaskar!

There are not many words in Sanskrit which use

the special short vowel Ḷ .

Is there a word MAM Ḷ in Sanskrit? If yes, what is its meaning?

The word GAM Ḷ means earth. Is that correct?

There is another word KḶPTI (device ?).

I am looking for more words with their meanings where the vowel Ḷ is present.

Please help. Thanks.
