Respected Sir,  
Namaskaara !  
The Devnagari version edited by Great Pandit ji, Prof. Revaprasaada ji, is also an eclectic edition ! In my opinion it is not a critical edition !  
I request you all to read my book for SOME new light on the text of this drama, Abhijnaanas'aakuntalam. I will be obliged by your thoughts.  
Thanks,  
vasant bhatt
