I recall the lecture delivered by Prof V Bhat on the same matter in Sanskrit Academy Hyd way back in 2008 where after discussions Late Prof. Pullela Ramachandrudu and Prof Narasimhachari endorsed this view. A critical edition of AS was needed for long, though the play is available in a good condition in the form of teaching text. The lecture given by Prof Bhat was punished by Sanskrit Academy Hyd. The salient points are covered in a small monograph.  
  
Thanks to prof Bhat for his constant effort of many years in bringing out this new edition with Kashmir readings. Look forward to the publication.  
  
With best regards  
Shrivarakhedi
