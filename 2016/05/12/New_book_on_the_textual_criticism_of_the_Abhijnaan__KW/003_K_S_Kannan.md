Sahitya Akademi, Delhi, has, I suppose, brought out a fairly extensive critical edition. ed. Gaurinatha Shastri.

  

Another edited by SKBelvalkar was also brought out by the same organisation earlier.

  

Details must be available on their website.

  

Critical edn.s of all works of Kalidasa have been brought out by them.

  

Newer mss will entail newer edn.s.
