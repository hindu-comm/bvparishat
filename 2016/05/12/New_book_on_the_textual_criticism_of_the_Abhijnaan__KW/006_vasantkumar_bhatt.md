Respected Sir,  
Dr. Gaurinath ji has consulted not a single manuscript for his Devnagri recension, it is very sad, but it is a fact. It is again a eclectic edition., Not a critical one.  
Dr. S. K. Belvalkar has not given an introduction, nor a list of manuscripts utilized by him due to his old age & illness. ( Dr. V. Raghavan ji also did not take care as an editor / publisher ), Dr. Belvelkar ji has not given any variant in foot-notes. Again,, it is also an eclectic edition. Because in the name of Kashmiri version, he has accepted Devnagari & Bangali readings !!!  
So, I have attempted to edit the Kashmiri recension again with the help of Five Shaaradaa manuscripts. ( Out of the five MSS, there are two manuscripts written on Bhoorja-patra !!! )  
Thank you for showing interest in the matter.  
Namaskaara,  
vasant bhatt
