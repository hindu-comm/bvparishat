Dear Dr. Bhatt

  

Congratulations for the publication of the work, and many thanks for sharing a free copy.

  

Do you plan to bring out a critical edition if the play based on the all the available rescensions? Has such a critical edition of शाकुन्तल been compiled already?

  

Thanks, Nityanand
