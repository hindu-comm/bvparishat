नमस्ते  
  
I believe these have more to do with वैदिक vs लौकिक. The following are some of the research suggestions:  
  
A) Principle of Animacy (<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animacy>) suggests neuter gender for inanimate objects. And they are "not supposed to act as genuine कर्ता". In the modern age, Animacy has evolved and one might need to treat animals and inanimate objects (e.g. cars in an animation cinema) as masculine/ feminine gender and assume the role of full fledged कर्ता. Sanskrit allows a प्रातिपदिक to assume different genders (as seen in adjectival usage), not without a reason.  
  
B) In द्विकर्मक usages, one of them should be in vocative. e.g., वव्रे वासुदेवम् सहाय in place of ambiguous वव्रे वासुदेवम् सहायम्. We may call this "vocative absolute".  
  
C) re द्विवचन usages: this is a very specific concept in Vedic point of view, where it denotes some kind of "symmetry" available within a context. So राम: च लक्ष्मण: च should be the preferred usage, unless one is very clear on the symmetry of the द्विवचन context. Even पाणिनि has noted exceptional nature of छन्दस् in this regard.  
  
I currently don't have the time/ resource to present a better case for the above points.
