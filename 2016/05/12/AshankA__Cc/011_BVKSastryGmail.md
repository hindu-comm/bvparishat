On \< पौर्वापर्यक्रमः \> in Samskruhtam and implications on \< Taatparya nirnaya/ Anvaya Prakriyaa> : it is a key issue to recognize why English is unique just as \<Samskrutham> is unique !



Samskrutham, has two modes of expression and technical analysis: Chandas and Bhashaa.



1. Samskrutham in ‘Bhashaa’ mode uses \< पौर्वापर्यक्रमः \> for accentuation of meaning impact \< like sequencing of which word comes first and what follows it> in two ways.

- In the sentence, the sequence is used for constructing the flow (Chandas) by guru-laghu vinyasa ( bhangee-bhaniti vaichitrya) .

- Within the word (= Pada) , for proper rule application to bring out the speakers intention ( vivakshaa as poorva-padartha pradhana or uttara padartha pradhana> , changing the rule of Samasa ( compounding sequence) . Example of neelotpalam split in different ways. This technique is mainly used by commentators for making their preferred interpretations – be it Shaastra or kavya vyaakhyana.

This is what makes ‘Samskruth Shabda’ to be ‘ non-translatable’ using any single dictionary’ ! And it also marks the limitation of ‘ Monier-Williams’ like dictionaries which claim to be the Royal- and Authoritiative High Way for deciding what the given text means and how it is to be translated ! And ‘ who has the English language capability to translate the Sanskrit classics’.



2. Samskrutham in ‘Chandas’ mode uses \< पौर्वापर्यक्रमः \> for \<Ashta-Vikruti Patha> . According to the established convention in tradition, In Samhta mode, the \< पौर्वापर्यक्रमः \> reconstruction is not applicable. In rest of the seven modes, there are strict rules to follow. And how the seven modes of \< Ashta-Vikruti patha> impacts \< Vedaartha Taatparya> is debated in multiple streams. Some scholars in Andhra –pradesh think that Ashta-vikruti variation has no impact on meaning; And some think that it has an impact in meaning and \< Phala-Vishesha>. The debate is a raging issue, which has disturbed the \< Ghana-Paathi> status of a \<Vaidika Brahamana, just having the knowledge of Samhita, as a Veda-Paathi>. This also has a serious impact on how \< Dahsa-Granthi> mode of Vedic tradition and text preservation is to be transmitted to next generation. Obviously the \<Ghana-Pathis and Dasha-Granthi’s> are endangered sub-species in the larger picture of \< Scholars and Practitioners of Vedic Texts –traditions supported with the Practical and Philosophy :: Vidhi-Vidhana and Shaastra-Darshana> .



3. So What ? The ancient society of India ‘ (Varna-Ashrama Standard )’ - was shaped by ‘ –Veda- Vedanta Darshana and Aakhyana’ ( = Vision and Deliberation of Vedas and its conclusions) by Yoga practice and
use of language called ‘Samskrutham’.



This has drifted to be a society of ‘ Caste standard ( = jaati – kula) by embracing the \< Ramayana and Mahabharata as refined social narratives ( itihasa –katha – charita) of Vedas and Vedanta anchored to Bhagavad-Gita as ‘ upanishat-saara vedanta’.



 And this has further moved on to shape the next layer of society anchored to \< Gods in Purana, worshipped at ‘Devalayas’, where Yoga and Samskrutham are at the minimal most end ! (even though lip-sympathy is paid for their glory).



And What next ? This ‘Caste –Cow-Curry (Jati-Mata-Kula –Mandir anchored society) is further drifting to a ‘Globalized thinly spread Spiritual community of South Asian origin’ which has its roots of ‘Dharma-Language, God Concept, tenets of philosophy and sciences in ‘Yoga’ works ( including invention of Zero and countless superstitions and oddities) ’ told in an archaic classical language of ‘PIE’ origin
called ‘Vedic Sanskrit’ ( if not Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit) derived from the narrative of ‘Tower of Babel’ telling spread of civilizations and branching of human languages as an effort to get back the ‘ magical word to reach God in heaven’ (?!).



The backdrop of Samskrutham (Chandas and Bhashaa) studies nad instruction-pedagogy has become ‘English’, which has the primary requisite of \< पौर्वापर्यक्रमः \> word order sequence in sentence to construct the meaning ! The statement \< ‘John eats apple’ does not mean the same as ‘ Apple eats John’.
