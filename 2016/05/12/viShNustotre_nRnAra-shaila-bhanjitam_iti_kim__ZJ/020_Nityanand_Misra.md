This vigraha is untenable.

The word is भञ्जित is from भन्जो (भञ्जो) आमर्दने which is used in the meaning of destroying something (breaking into pieces). E.g.ऊरुभङ्ग = destruction/fracture/breaking of the thigh.  

The words विभक्त and विभाजित are from वि भज् which means to divide something (but not break or destroy it). E.g.चातुर्वर्ण्यं मया सृष्टं गुणकर्मविभागशः = by the division of गुण and कर्म (not destruction).

The roots are not the same and the meaning is not the same.
