नारदादि-वन्दितं \| नृनार-शैल-भञ्जितम्  

=  
"(having) worshipped by Narada" \| "(having) broken the nri-nAra barrier"  
  
Please note that शैल is an oft used पौराणिक alternate for (आर्ष) पर्वत.  
  
In my opinion, this is a subject unto itself (properly transmitted in गुरूकुल setting) — with the नर-नारायण पर्वत at Badrinath (pointed out by RNI ji) being an important keystone to it — however, for a purely scholarly in-context reading,  
  
नृनार-शैल = the barrier between नर and नारायण.  
  
  
regards,
