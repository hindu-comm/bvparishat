Thanks for pointing this out, sir. As far as finding a satisfactory delicious understanding of the usage goes, this seems to be the most promising line of inquiry. It must have been that chokkaNNa-ayyangar went on pilgrimage to badariinAtha and confirmed some local legend, which must once have been common knowledge.  
  
Can people who know please list pertinent legends about the nar-narayan hills? I tried to search online, but did not find any story about these hills.
