Given the valuable information supplied by Prof. Iyengar, we can takeनृनार-शैल-भञ्जितम् in the sense ‘(made to break —> separated—>) set apart (from its surrounding)by the Nara hill and the Nārāyaṇa hill, enclosed bythe Nara hill and the Nārāyaṇa hill.’I do not think there is much strain or semantic acrobatics involved in understanding the compound in this way.
