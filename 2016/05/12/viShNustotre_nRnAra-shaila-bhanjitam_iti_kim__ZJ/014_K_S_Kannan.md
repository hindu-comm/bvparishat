The **Verb-first-bahuvrīhi** is well illustrated in this famous verse on hanUmat

  

***dūrīkṛta-sītārtiḥ***

*** prakaṭīkṛta-rāma-vaibhava-sphūrtiḥ/***

***dārita-daśamukha-kīrtiḥ***

*** purato mama bhātu hanumato mūrtiḥ//***

***  
***

In the third *pāda*, we have a *ṇijanta* construction, placed again, at the beginning of the compound, not the end.

  

In either senses of *bhaj* suggested, it is difficult to justify the placement of *bhañjita* at the end of the compound, except for exigencies of metre.
