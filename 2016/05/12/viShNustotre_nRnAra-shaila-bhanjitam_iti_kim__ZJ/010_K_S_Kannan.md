*bhan"jitam* affords a problem even in the earlier **interpretation given by PR**.: why did not the poet choose to use*bhan"jakam* which is more straightforward, and

does not affect the metre either, and

occurs more naturally?

  

Is not **Verb-first-*****bahuvrIhi*** more common and more natural

\- if we were particular in retaining *bhan"jitam*, that is.
