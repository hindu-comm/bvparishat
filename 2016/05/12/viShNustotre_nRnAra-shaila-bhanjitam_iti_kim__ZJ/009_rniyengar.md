Please check whether नृनार-शैल refers to the *Nar-Narayan* hills on either the side of the Badrinath temple in the Himalayas. These twin hills are mentioned as the meditating Nara and Narayana in the Puranas also.There is a place famous as Narada kunDa or shila also there. The verb may have to be interpreted or emended?
