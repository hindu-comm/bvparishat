Namaste Sampath Kumarji,  
  
Yes, I know that Vimshottari dasha system follows a maximum life-span of 120 years but very few people (excepting people like Vinay Jha) know that Vimshottari years are lunar years. In the natal horoscope, depending on the Moon's position in a particular paada or quarter of the nakshatra in which the Moon is in, the starting of the Vimshottari dasha is decided. Consequently the Vishottari dashaa follows the sidereal lunar year. Vayu purana clearly says that 3,030 Manushya (human) years. are equal to 2,700 solar years and from this one can find out that Manushya year is Lunar sidereal Year (and not the Lunar year of 12 Savana months).  
  

The Ashtottari dasha, of course, follows a maximum life-span of 108 years and not 120 years. I shall not go into the discussion oj the ashtottari dasha here.  
  

I am not against astrology, but what I wished to say is that the astrological predictions are not always final. I myself saw astrologers making correct predictions, many a times. However, take the case of Adi Shankara's horoscope, which was found to predict a maximum life-span of 16 years, but he went on to live for 32 years. There are many such examples. That is why one should not predict anybody's life-span as final as that may have a negative effect on that person. Hope you understand my view-point.  
  

Regards,
