Namaste Sampath Kumarji,  
  

Congratulations to you for teaching the Jaimini astrology courses *have* and that you even consulted some unpublished manuscripts. Hope you would take the necessary steps to bring out those unpublished manuscripts for greater good of the believers in the esoteric field of Astrology.  
  

As regards your proposed research into the techniques for predicting the death year and the plan to prepare a course for teaching that, may I request you to be kind to keep in mind that the Vedas tell us to live for not less than one hundred Autumns or Tropical Solar years (i.e. 108 Lunar years in the Vimshottari dasha). That could very well mean that astrology is not a fatalistic subject and the astrologers should be able to suggest astrological ways and means for longer life. If you subscribe to the above Vedic view, may be you will like to call your new course as "Astrology for trying to live for one hundred years" or on similar lines.  
  

Regards,
