Dear Sunilji

Namste...

विंशॊत्तरी means it is 120 years scheme, not 108 or 100..

there are so many institutions , which they are conducting courses ...

but not teaching a single predictive technique apart from text books, but in my case, first i teach the calculation of lifespan of the native ,based on Jaimini system,

after that i give 35 examples , and demonstrate 1 or 2 examples...

i thoroughly vigorously tested those methods in 700 Horoscopes....

and some techniques are deciphered for finding death year... some of these articles are published in saptarishis web site..

so now my plea is - suggest a good catchy caption for this post-doctoral session or course....

thank you...
