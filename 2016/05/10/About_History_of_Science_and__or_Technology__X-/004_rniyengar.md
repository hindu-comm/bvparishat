At the Jain University, Centre for Ancient History & Culture, our main focus is research on "History of science and technology" in India. We have no formal courses, but work towards publications, both Journal papers, manuscripts and monographs. In the seventies, there was a move by Delhi University to introduce the subject formally. I do not know what was the outcome. IITB Mumbai, has an active group on history of Mathematics. You will get the details from the IIT web page..
