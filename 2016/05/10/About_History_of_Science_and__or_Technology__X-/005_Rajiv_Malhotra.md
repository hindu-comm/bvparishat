Infinity Foundation started its History of Indian Science & Technology (HIST) research and publishing project in year 2000. The first project had the goal of 20 volumes to be based solely on *hard empirical* claims.  
  

The web site is at: <http://indianscience.org/>  
  

Ten volumes are available in print now. The series editor who may be contacted for copies is: [oc_h...@hotmail.com]()  
  

Five of these volumes have been translated into Marathi by an organization led by Ganesh Arnaal who may be contacted at: [ganesh...@gmail.com]()

  

Recently, Indus Univ in Ahmadabad signed an agreement with us to continue developing this series. They also teach courses and plan to develop educational films on HIST.  
  

We also did 10 annual conferences on HIST in different universities. Recently, Indus has resumed these. Those interested may contact: Dr Bhandari at: [rakibha...@gmail.com]()
