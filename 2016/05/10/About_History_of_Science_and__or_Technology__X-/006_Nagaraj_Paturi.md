Glad to know about the research focus at Jain University and the research project at Infinity Foundation.

  

HIST as part of HST can lead to several interesting issues and consequent theorizations on the processes of knowledge evolution : can these processes be non-linear or must they be viewed as only linear? Issues such as polygenesis and mono-genesis, diffusion and 'unity of mind' etc.borrowed from Cultural Anthropology and applied to the HIST's relation toHST etc. multiple views of the same 'focus' (e.g. as in the case of (Allopathy and Ayurveda).

  

Having them as UG and PG courses as part of the same program can lead to youngsters participating in these connection making.
