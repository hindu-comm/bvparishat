नमस्ते ।  
  
From युग to योग, उ changes to (a regular Sanskrit feature) its गुण grade- ओ ; युग in this way is a step backwards from योग, and easier to deal with.  
  
————————————————————————  
युग  
  
aeon/ eon, age of the world, generation, race of men  
  
pair, couple, brace, युगल  
  
symbolic for number 12, symbolic for number 4  
————————————————————————————  
  
How do we make a unified, single sense of युग, out of so many diverse meanings? Curve-fitting is not the answer, because a curve is fit through data-points, and not through other curves.  
  
दैविक विश्वदर्शन inherent in the देवभाषा is the natural answer. Here is one oversimplified approach:  
  
There are four लोका:- पृथिवी, द्यो, अन्तरिक्ष व समुद्र ।  
  
During सत् युग on पृथिवी, all the four are connected.  
During त्रेता युग on पृथिवी, three (पृथिवी, द्यो, अन्तरिक्ष) remain connected.  
During द्वापर युग on पृथिवी, two (पृथिवी, द्यो) remain connected.  
During पुष्य (कलि) युग, पृथिवी remains disconnected from the other three. (कलि also means, "१").  
  
This a proper definition of चतुर्युग, and so of युग ।  
  
युग - because at a time only two realms are coupled/ decoupled - means "couple", "coupling". Further, there are ४ लोका: (and १२ आदित्या:) that are the ध्येय of the coupling process, so युग must also allude to numbers ४ and १२.  
  
————————————————————————  
  
Reverting a phoneme (अ) ahead of युग, again, we get योग.  
अ here adds, primarily, the meaning "effort". So we get the drift what योग really means. Verbalisation of this meaning yields many different translations found in the thesaurus entry.  
  
A more fundamental treatment to the semantics of युग would obviously entail inclusion of the data-point (वर्ण) analysis of the semantic-curve (शब्द) योग / युग. This is again because of Sanskrit being essentially a दैविक भाषा, not a सामान्य भाषा (ref. the 2007-BORI paper by Dr N.R.Joshi).
