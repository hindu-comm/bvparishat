thank you very much.recently i am working on critically edited bharatartha dipika commentary on danadharma by arjuna misra extracted from the mahabhata anusasana parva. according to catalogue of the sanskrit manuscripts in the raghunath temple library by m.a.stein page no 196 ms.no.2539 i came to know that one of the manuscript is located in this library. so if you kindly help me to get the manuscript it will be very helpful for my work.
