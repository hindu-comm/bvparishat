Dear All:  
  
By popular demand, I have now stopped using [scribd.com](http://scribd.com) for uploading my manuscripts.  
  
Please check out:  
  
<https://archive.org/details/@dharmarthatrustjk>  
  
And in future this will be the place of all manuscripts will be uploaded.  
  
Also, sonmeone was very kind enough through my FB page to contact me for one manuscript Veer Chudamani:  
  
<https://archive.org/details/VeerChudamani4864Alm22Shlf1DevanagariTantrm>  
  
that is listed in Tantrik Sahitya of Gopinath Kaviraj Ji  
  
<https://www.scribd.com/doc/110871999/T%C4%81ntrik-S%C4%81hitya-Gopinath-Kaviraj>  
  
I got that done as you can see above but asked him to give me reference to every Raghunath temple manuscript in there:  
  
The result is the excel attached.  
  
Currently we a re digitizing a few Mahabhashyas and the first one can be seen below  
<https://archive.org/details/MahabhashyaWithPradeepCommentary5thChapterKaiyyata2GhaDevanagari>  
  
Once the Mahabhashyas are done then we will immediately move to digitizing the Gopinath Kaviraj List.  
  
Thanks and regards,  
  
eGangotri Team
