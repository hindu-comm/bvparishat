Sir,

  

I could not find any other volumes of MB edited by Bakre. As per the information provided at the Mahabharata resources website, Gujarati Printing Press had published only Virata and Udyoga parvas with multiple commentaries.  

  

<http://mahabharata-resources.org/mbh_comm.html>



There is a better quality scan of Virata Parva at [archive.org](http://archive.org) - <https://archive.org/details/rmanmahbhratam04maha>

  

regards

shankara
