HariH OM!

  

Vidvabhyo namaskāraḥ,

  

I came across a book titled "Mānameyaślokavārtikam" in Sanskrit authored by Mahāmahopādhyāya Lakṣmīpuram śrīnivāsācāryaḥ.

  

He has compared several darśanās and provided a comprehensive outlook.

  

I just want to know whether there is any English translation of the same available and known to any of the scholars on this forum.

  

Dhanyavāadaḥ
