Friends,  
  

I did spend some time in hearing through various presentations in the video.  

I had to admire the efforts by the presenters in understanding Dandi, the transition  

to Kannada poetics and creation of secondary literature. Deven Patel of UPenn  
also presented. Certainly the overall knowledge base of the presenters on the topic  
was much limited and Prof Nagaraja Rao was a good presence in creating directions.  

I wish he had a full length presentation, but that would have been too high for the  

audience.  

  

Since these are funded activities, I would think a lot more young scholars of Indian  
origin should get involved in such analysis. Over all they seem to be looking into  

a process through which the Sanskrit poetics did migrate to other languages and  

possibly abroad through literary exchanges. I think this is of scholarly interest.  

A group in Israel hosted the event. I was happy to see that many different individuals  

in the world were talking about topics which are strictly Indian at its origin and built  
on Indian scenes and stories.I do not know why Indian scholars were not adequately  
represented.  
  

Are there Dandi scholars or scholars on kavya exist in this forum? I thank the post  

and hope more such postings to assist scholars' participation..  
  

Best regards,  

BM
