Namaste,  
  

Thank you for the post. I just went through the link \<<http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=23412>\>, where the views of
pf Dr. **Frederick Smith** are given. I could not agree with him as my experience in the Shimoga village was very different. There are many families in that village, where even the small children can speak excellent Sanskrit and that too so fluently that I was amazed. This reminds me of an article in the READERS DIGEST, which I read many years ago. The article tells us that in a school the French teacher had to take leave and she could not be present in the very first month of the French class. The principal sought the help of a person who knew French and requested to keep the students busy during the French class-period for one month. The students were learning French for the first time. When the teacher returned after one month, she was shocked to find the students speaking very good french, which her previous students could not do even after her teaching them for one year. This amply proves that efficiency in learning a new language vastly depends on, from whom one learns that.  
  

Regards,
