Friends,  

I am posting the link to the last session in the Conference.  

It is about a hundred minutes, but could be educational.  

I complement the organizers to record this important discussion  

among bright individuals thinking on India.

You can view Prof Nagaraja Rao's piece in this session.  

  

They are discussing the influence of दाण्डी's काव्यादर्श in spreading poetics in Tibet, Mongolia, Chin, Japan,  
Burma and Indonesia. They do come to the conclusion that Indian culture has a transformation effect which  

manifests through cultural assimilation propagated through language and literary contributions.  
  

I would have liked the discussion to be have been held in India with many Indian practitioners participating.  

Style of communication and lyricism in language are signatures of culture. I would think that the ornamental  
style is organic to India and a native person observes it around. In my view, it is the style that makes the  
transformation not the text. The text is a record of the organic culture.  
  

Hopefully many scholars who have analyzed this may comment after viewing the recording. Do appreciate  

the sincerity of many young scholars thinking deeply about India and her literature.  
  

Best regards,  

BM
