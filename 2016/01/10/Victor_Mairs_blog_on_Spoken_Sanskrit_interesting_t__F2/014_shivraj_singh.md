EMH is a myth. Crash of 1987. Do you really think that the companies had lost their value as indicated by the crash and then recovered all the lost "value" a couple of days later?  
  
Palm and 3Com in the decade of 90s is rather well known EMH buster.  
  
Then there are a kind of mutual funds whose valuation is different from the stocks they contain!  
  
Besides Shiller (another nobel winner) has shown that EMH is not kosher. He has found predictable patterns in the behaviour of US stock marker. I will leave the details for you to look up. Mutual fund managers' performance alpha, it has been established, is mostly hype.  
  
Coming to the main thread of this debate. Pliant Brahmans is a known phenomena. What is surprising about it? It exists today and it existed earlier. You can give x amount of rupees to get a kundli matched or get the muhurat you want.  
  
Subhramanya is correct that many western scholars got information from brahmins whom they paid.  
  
If you travel to udaipur and visit the city palace you will see the room, still maintained, where James Tod worked along with his brahmin scholar. Many such examples exist.
