I want to know where one can purchase grovelling and pliant Sanskrit scholars and in what form? Not that I plan to buy (or sell) some, but interested to know if the market is [efficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis) or not.

  

Or did you mean to say that co-opting Sanskrit scholars is akin to purchasing them?
