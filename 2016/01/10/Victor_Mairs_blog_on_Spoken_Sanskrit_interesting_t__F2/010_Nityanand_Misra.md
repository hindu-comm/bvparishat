If it was just business school jargon and proved useless in 2008 as you claim, Eugene Fama would not have been awarded the [2013 Nobel](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2013/fama-facts.html) in Economic Sciences for it. Anyway we can move on as it is not the topic at hand.

Could you please be a bit more specific. My question is the same: where and in what form can one "purchase groveling and pliant Sanskrit scholars" as you claimed? Maybe we can add "how" to it. It is a bold claim to make, and such a claim needs to be substantiated with specific and credible evidence.
