1. "Efficient market" etc is business school jargon and is passe. Exposed as being useless in 2008

  

2\. Obviously, this is not like going to the market - but more of
Geopolitics and setting up right incentive structures like in a corporate environment.

   American academia also has its own incentive structures.

  There were "Area Studies" created in the US to fight communism. 
Indology/South-asia studies also falls under this area-study category..

  Norman Brown who initiated indology in the US originally came from the secret service.

  

  Unfortunately, most Sanskrit academics from India have no idea of the background of the academics, their ideology, Institutional process and funding mechanisms in US and Europe. 

 

  BTW - I do recommend Rajiv Malhotras , Breaking India as well as his new book "Battle for Sanskrit". <http://thebattleforsanskrit.com/>

  

  Best,

  S.
