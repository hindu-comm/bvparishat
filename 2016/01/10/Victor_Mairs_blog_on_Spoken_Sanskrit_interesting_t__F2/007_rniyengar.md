Dear Moderator, On 6th Jan you posted: "All messages of scholars will be posted. There will be no censorship on scholars. We ourselves fight against censorship and hence we should not be doing it ourselves. ........."

But, now I find one message has been deleted between Jan 20 and Jan 22 in the present thread. At least on my console it says "This message has been deleted." I am curious to know how this happened. Is the delete option available to all members or what is the protocol?

  

regards
