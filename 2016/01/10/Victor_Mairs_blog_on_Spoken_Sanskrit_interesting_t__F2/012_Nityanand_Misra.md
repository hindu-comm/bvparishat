Dear Sir,

  

I do not need to have a fetish for Nobels to contest a trivialization of EMH. For the record, I have worked for nearly nine years in financial markets where both passive fund management (based on EMH) and active fund management are real. In the US alone, nearly 4.5 trillion US dollars was invested in passive strategies across mutual funds and ETFs as of mid-2015. I have read enough about Efficient Market Hypothesis and the debate around it and in my \[experienced\] view, it is neither useless nor simply business school jargon (as you claim).

  

I appreciate the general points you make, but it would be good if you could be more specific about such examples. I found your statement "grovelling and pliant Sanskrit scholars \[are\] purchasable" to be an over-exaggeration. There may be some examples, but I would like to see concrete evidence before concluding that this is the overbearing reality when it comes to Sanskrit scholars.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
