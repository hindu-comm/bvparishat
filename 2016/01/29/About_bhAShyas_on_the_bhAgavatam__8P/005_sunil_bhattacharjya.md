Dear Mishraji,  
  

The Puranas have to meet five criteria called 'Panchalakshana'. Out of these one criterion requires the Royal genealogies to be keep uptodate. Several puranas have updated the genealogies upto the Gupta period. That to me, means that Puranas were written before the Gupta period. The Bhagavata purana was recited to the dying king Parikshit and the
Bhagavata Purana claims itself to have been composed immediately sfter Parikshita was coronated. That means this purana was composed about 5,000 years ago.
