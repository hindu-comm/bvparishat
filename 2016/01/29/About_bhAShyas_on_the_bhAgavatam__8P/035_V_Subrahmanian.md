Sir, to my knowledge Dhanapati Suri is an Advaitin. He has written a work 'bhāṣyotkarṣa dīpikā' to bring out the nuances of the Shānkara Gitā Bhāṣyam. I do not know if he has written a commentary to the Srimadbhāgavatam and that too according to Dvaita tenets. 

  

Also, there is a work by namegUdArtha dIpikA by Sri Madhusudana Saraswati as his own commentary to the Bhagavadgita.
