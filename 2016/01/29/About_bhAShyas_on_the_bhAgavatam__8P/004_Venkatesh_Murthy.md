Namaste

  

Because of the difficult language some people believe Vopadeva the grammarian is the author of Bhagavata. But others have rejected this. Others say it is written by some South Indian saints like Alvars. There is a belief it is a commentary on Gayatri Mantra because the first Sloka ends with Dhimahi.

  

There is also another famous Bhagavata known as Devi Bhagavata.
