Thank you for the reference. On page 20 in the sample PDF, all of these 136 works are called commentaries on the Bhagavata. This is most likely incorrect, and what you say (*commentaries or works related to Bhagavata*) appears to be correct. This ‘list of commentaries’ includes many works titled Anukramanika, Stotra, Sara, Campu, etc which are highly unlikely to be commentaries on the Bhagavata. In fact, number 98 on the list is the Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu of Rupa Gosvami which is certainly not a commentary on the Bhagavata. Either Mohendra Nath Chatterjee or Demian Martins has erred in calling all these 136 works as commentaries on the Bhagavata. Or perhaps Chatterjee relied on a source without cross-checking.

  

It may be worthwhile checking with the list in the New Catalogus Catalogorum.
