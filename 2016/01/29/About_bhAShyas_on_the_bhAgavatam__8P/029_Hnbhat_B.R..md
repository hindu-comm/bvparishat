89-92 are certainly campu-s, Bhagavata-campu-s by different writers. 99 and 100 also independent campu-s,based on bhagavata. But it is strange that भागवतचम्पू of Anantha Bhatta has been left out.  
  
  

112 seems to be सूचिका but not sure of its nature.

The commentary listed by Vamshidhara is on the first verse only. By the way, I found nos. 74, 75 and 76 by Vopadeva, to whom the authorship of Bhagavata is often ascribed. These three titles may or may not be commentaries.
