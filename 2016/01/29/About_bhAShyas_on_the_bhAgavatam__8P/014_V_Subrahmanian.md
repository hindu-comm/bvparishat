Swami, here are my doubts regarding your above statement:

  

In that commentary Vamshidhara has given long arguments with citations from various sources to prove Hari-Hara abheda, trimurti aikya, ideas such as: whenever Vishnu slays asuras, he resorts to the 'tamas' of Rudra, etc. He has also cited the Padma Purana Bhagavata 12th Canto māhātmya which says, among other things: He alone is a great / true vaishnava who holds Hari, Hara and Durga to be non-different and all of them to be Brahman.

  

I mentioned the above as I do not know the type of vaishnavism that is prevalent in Haryana.
