Dear Mr. Saha,  
  

At the time of subscribing to the BVP list, I did express my desire to continue the correspondence with the name as Gitarthi, but soon realized that it is better to continue the correspondence with my regular name Sunil Kumar Bhattacharjya (Sunil KB, in short). So, if you please, you can address me in my regular name.  
  

1)  
You have made the point:  
\< **These 'some people' include *literally* all descendants of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's parampara. All of them claim to be descendant of Madhva.**\>.  
  
On this, I have to disagree with all those descendents of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu parampara, who claim Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to be descendent of Madhacharya. Adi Shankara wrote "Bhaktyartha kalipitam dvaitam, advaitadapi sundaram", yet he led the aspiring advaitins to the goal,
the bliss of " Ekatva with Brahman". Chaitanya Mahaprabhu too, as I see him, enjoyed the prem of Radha-Krisha, yet knowing that Radha-Krishna and all of us are only one.  

  
2)  
As regards Lord Krishna's name, all Hindu's including Adi Shankaracharya (who wrote Bhaja Govindam) have reverence for His name. If Ishvara Puri gave one mantra of the Lord to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, that does not alter the philosophy of Achintya Bhedabheda. .
