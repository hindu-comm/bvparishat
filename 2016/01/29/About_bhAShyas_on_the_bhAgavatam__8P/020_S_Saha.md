Dear Gitarthi,

These 'some people' include *literally* all descendants of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's parampara. All of them claim to be descendant of Madhva.  

  
  

> As regards Keshav Kashmiri Bhattacharya being the guru of Chaitanya > Mahaprabhu, I understand that he gave Shodshakshari mahamantra to > Chaitanya mahaprabhu. Initially Chaitanya Mahaprabhu did challenge > Keshav Kashmiri Bhattacharya for a bebate in Sanskrit grammar but that > never took place and many believe that it did not take place due to > intervention of Mother Saraswati herself.

  
This is a Nimbarka/Advaita side claim mostly. It was [Isvara Puri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isvara_Puri) who gave mantra to Chaitanya.

You are right. Achintya bhedabheda is basically Sridhara's Advaita,with all the parts that emphasize Advaita thrown out. Jiva Goswami himself in his sandarbhas effectively admits it as such and claims that Sridhara included 'mayavadin'(Advaita) ideas in his bhasya only to lead other Advaitins to Visnu-bhakti (which is a theological fiction in my opinion,but that's a separate matter).
