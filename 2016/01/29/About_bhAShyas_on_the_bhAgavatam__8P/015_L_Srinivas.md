Dr Misra,  
  
I wouldn't know about dating and such.  

  
\> Sri Ramanuja's Visistadvaita group buys into its every letter as I see in the temples.  
  

I'm somewhat confused by this statement. What do you really wish to say here - what have you seen in the temples?  
  
In passing I may mention that there's a big body of commentarial literature on the Divya Prabandham (also called the Dravida Veda). The commentaries use the Ramayana, several purana texts like the Vishnu purana and the Vayu purana and of course, the Veda and Sastras as proof texts . One will have to struggle really really hard to find a reference to the Bhagavatham in these commentaries. In fact as far as these commentaries are concerned, it is as though the Bhagavatham did not exist.  
  
Based on my own experience, the Bhagavatam has hardly had any influence on the Ramanuja sampradaya. If you were to believe some western writers, it's quite the other way around.  
  
Thanks,  
  
Srini
