Dear Nityananda Mishra ji,  
  
Dr. Demian Martins(PhD) published an edition of the *Siddhanta-Darpana* from the Jiva Institue of Vaishnava studies. The Jiva Institute hosts a small sample of that work online. In it,a list which is copied from a list of commentaries on the Bhagavata Purana from the edition of the Bhagavatam published by Mohendra Nath Chatterjee in 1895 exists. It is there in page 20 of the sample document(which is a fragment of the full one) that I am linking here.There are like 136 commentaries/works related to that scripture.
