Dear Mr. Saha,  
  

People from Ramanujacharya's school did write commentary but Ramanujacharya himself have not said anything about such need. Adherents of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's Achintyabhedabheda school, did write commentaries but Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has not spoken of such need.  
  

As regards Keshav Kashmiri Bhattacharya being the guru of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, I understand that he gave Shodshakshari mahamantra to Chaitanya mahaprabhu. Initially Chaitanya Mahaprabhu did challenge Keshav Kashmiri Bhattacharya for a bebate in Sanskrit grammar but that never took place and many believe that it did not take place due to intervention of Mother Saraswati herself.Some people do claim that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was a disciple of the Madhva school. But to me it appears that there is less of difference between the Bhedabheda school and the Dvaitadvaita school than between vedabheda school and the Dvaita school.  
  

If you heve information as to who was chaitanya Mahaprabhu's guru, why don't you share that wirth us.
