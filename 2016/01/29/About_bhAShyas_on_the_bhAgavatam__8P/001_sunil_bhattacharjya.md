Dear friends,  
  
With all regards to all the great commentators of the Bhagavata Purana, one should not lose sight of what Vedavyasa himself said about how easy or how difficut for the women and other lay persons (who did not have the chance to go to Gurukula education) to understand the Bhagavata Purana. According to Vedavyasa, he first composed the Mahabharata for all the lay persons (which included the women), but after the epic was completed he was unhappy as it turned out to be difficult for the lay persons to understand it. That is why, on the advice of Narada, he composed the Bhagavata purana,to make it surely easy for one and all to understand. Those who believe that Vedavyasa, one of the 24 avataras of Lord Vishnu, succeeded in his second attempt, read the main text, usually translated to vernacular language. I also recited the Bhagavata purana (the translation of that) in my childhood before my grandmother, who was fond of the Bhagavata purana, but her eyesight became weak for reading it herself. There is also the custom of observing the Bhagavata Saptha where the original Bhagavata Purana is supposed to be read.  
  

What I understand is that the great Madhvacharya seemed to have felt that the Bhagavata Purana is a difficult text for people to understand, without his commentary, which was from the Dvaita standpoint. The guru of Sridhara Swami thought that the Bhagavata Purana was an advaitic text and that is why he advised Sridhara Swami to write another commentary. That is how probably the race for writing the commentaries began.  
  

Now coming to the other great Acharyas, to my knowledge Adi Shankaracharya seems to have not expressed any view of the Bhagavata purana. Did Ramanujacharya or Chaitanya Mahaprabhu or Nimbarka Bhagavan or Jagadvijayi Keshav Kashmiri Bhattacharya (the guru of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu) express any opinion on the need for commentary on the Bhagavata purana ?  
  

Regards,
