Dear Gitarthi,  
  
  
Sri Viraraghava,who was in Ramanuja's sampradaya,wrote the Sri Vaishanva commentary on the Bhagavatam. Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's sampradaya has produced many commentaries on the Bhagavatam,beginning from Jiva Goswami's(Mahaprabhu's immediate disciple) *Krama-sandarbha*,Srila Vishwanath Chakravarti Thakur's *Saratha-Darsini*,Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur's *Gaudiya-Bhasya* and what we have online of Srila Prabhupada's commentary. And Sriman Mahaprabhu is usually not counted as a disciple of Sri Keshava Kashmiri. Mahaprabhu's theology is *acintya-bhedabheda*,while Kesava Kashmiri was a *Dvaitadvaita* adherent of the Nimbarka Sampradaya.  
  
Also,apparently Sri Vijyadhvaja Tirtha,the Madhva scholar who wrote the *Pada-ratnavali* commentary on the Bhagavatam,thought that Adi Shankara commented upon that text.
