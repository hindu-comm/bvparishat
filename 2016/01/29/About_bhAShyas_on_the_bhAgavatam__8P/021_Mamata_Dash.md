Dear Bhagavatapreminah,

  

The New Catalogus Catalogorum : An Encyclopedia of the Texts in Sanskrit Vol. XVI. has documented the text and the commentaries on the text. With out referring to the volume, one should come to end of the commentaries available on Bhagavata.

  

The text has Coms. in Adaita, Visishtadvaita, Dvaita, Suddhadvaita, Acintyabhedabheda, Dvaitadvaita, Mimamsakadvaita and Ramanandiya school. Bhagavata tattvadipa of Vallabhacharya is understood as an exposition on the text, not a com.

Scholars are requested to go through the documentation, where more than 100 commentaries are noticed.
