Does anyone have any idea about the theological leanings of the following  
authors of commentaries on the Bhagavata Purana?  
  
I know that Sridhara was a famous Advaitin,Vijayadhvaja Tirtha a  
Dvaitin,Viraraghava a Vishishtadvaitin and Vallabha a Suddhadvaitin  
and Jiva Goswami and Vishwanath Chakravarti Thakur Gaudiyas.  
  
I am asking about the following commentators  
  
(1) Vamshidhara(authored the Bhavartha-Dipika-Prakasha)  
(2) Radha-Ramana Goswami(is he Gaudiya?)(authored the Dipini)  
(3) Sukadeva/Shukadeva Acarya(authored the Siddhanta-Pradipa)  
(4) Purushottamcharan Goswami(authored the Subodhini-Prakash,so in  
Vallabha's line?)  
(5) GiridharLal Goswami(authored the Balaprabodhini)  
  
Thanking everyone in advance,  
  
Saha.
