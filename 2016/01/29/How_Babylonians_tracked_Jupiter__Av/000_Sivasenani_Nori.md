*Science* journal has published a [paper](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6272/482.full) explaining how Babylonians, in 350 BC, described the path of Jupiter using geometrical forms, a technique similar to Calculus which is credited as being "developed" much later in Europe. This [article](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/01/math-whizzes-ancient-babylon-figured-out-forerunner-calculus) in Science Magazine explains the contents and background of the paper in a friendly manner.

  

I am sharing this as techniques similar to Calculus are also found in ancient Indian texts and awareness of such techniques in the ancient world might be useful to those who are working in that field.
