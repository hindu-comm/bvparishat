Well, start with an introduction.  

What is "fundamental" ? what is a "law"? And why "first"?  
  

Giving a context and orientation would help the presentation.  

As I said before, you should provide a "segment" or a "section" in full  

and post it for better use of reading time.  

  

I think you have an idea, but the thrust is unintelligible to me with the time I can give.  
  

Please feel free to ignore if you think I am asking for clarity.  

  
Others may have opinion.
