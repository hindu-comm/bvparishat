I concur with your concerns and have duly taken them into account (even if immediately not evident).  
  
Indeed, generality is an important virtue: not only for the things being talked about, but also for the audience being talked to. For example, I talked in the second post about द्यावापृथिवी in a self-contained manner which ensured those that aren't scholars of Veda are not put at disadvantage. Yet, I took troubles to still term the idea as द्यावापृथिवी so that the Veda-vida-s can for themselves validate whether the definition is in opposition to primary source. Or the mathematician can come up and say, "Look, I see a fault in your handling of the example of numeral system". The point is, generality improves the chances of falsiabilty of the theories being constructed, and as we know falsiabilty (the ability to be proven false, unlike fairy tales or Santa Clause) is considered among the highest virtues of a theory.  
  
Next, let me expand a little more on द्यावापृथिवी, in this instalment.  
  
द्यावापृथिवी consists of क्षेत्र — द्यो and पृथिवी, which have as subsets द्यु1, द्यु2, द्यु3 etc of द्यो, and पृ1, पृ2, पृ3 etc of पृथिवी.  
  
Allowing for the possibility of some subset being common between द्यो and पृथिवी, let  
द्यु0 = पृ0 be that set.  
  
Note that this set (i.e. द्यु0 which is same as पृ0), as mentioned earlier in formulations 1-4, may consist of further subsets, elements or can even be empty.  
  
When this set is empty, we say " द्यो and पृथिवी are not connected." Let us define this term as असत्.  
And the state where " द्यो and पृथिवी are connected", i.e. when the क्षेत्र द्यु0 = पृ0 indeed has some element or subset, be defined as सत्.  
  
Again, these definitions of सत् and असत् are self-contained as far as present discussion is concerned (but can be falsified by observations from Vedic texts).  
  
There is an immediate implication of the idea of द्यु0 = पृ0 which I might take up next.  
  
  
N.B.  
  
Since we talked about संख्या as one of the implementations of द्यावापृथिवी, let me relate further by emphasising that द्यु0 = पृ0 is evidenced in संख्या fundamentally as:  
-0 = +0
