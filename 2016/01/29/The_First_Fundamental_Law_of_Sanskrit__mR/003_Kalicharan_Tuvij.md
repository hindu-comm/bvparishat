Thank you both of you for your response; BM's suggestions are pertinent, and seen that way.  
  
Nothing more to add here (btw I am not a Prof.) except perhaps that धर्म is the right word (while religion is not) and therefore shall be used in the contexts to follow (if used at all). धर्म by definition is "a valid conclusion of a consistent discourse, expressible as some law" - just my opinion, but which lets me better phrase the name of this thread as "प्रथम: धर्म: मूल: संस्कृतस्य".  
  
To build the context towards the formal statement, also to be self-contained, let me introduce the following ideas:  
1. Two sets (say, क्षेत्र), द्यो and पृथिवी.  
2. Granting these may yet consist of subsets, the subsets द्यु1, द्यु2, द्यु3 etc of द्यो, and similarly पृ1, पृ2, पृ3 etc of पृथिवी.  
3. Further possible divisions to be done in the manner of, e.g. पृ11, पृ12, पृ13 etc as subsets of पृ1, and so on.  
4. Granting that the complex reality being expressed/ experienced may consist of multiple copies of द्यो and पृथिवी, the instances द्यो1, द्यो2, द्यो3 etc of द्यो, and similarly the instances पृथिवी1, पृथिवी2, पृथिवी3 etc of पृथिवी, and so on.  
  
The formulations 1-4 might look innocuous, yet can be shown to be presupposing the following:  
A) The same द्यावापृथिवी is assumed to work out all the details of a complex reality (being expressed/ experienced) by potentially acting at both the subset and the superset levels.  
B) The basis set, द्यावापृथिवी, is assumed to be composed of exactly two components: द्यो and पृथिवी.  
  
A-B are axiomatic in nature, so we don't need go any further into these for the purpose of the present discussion.  
  
  
N.B.  
  
However, to facilitate understanding of the context developed thus far, let me give an informal illustration (not very intuitive one though) of how द्यावापृथिवी can work. The numeral system, also known as Hindu numerals or संख्या, is an important example of द्यावापृथिवी where the positive numerals belong to पृथिवी, and the negative numerals to द्यो. This system is projected as being capable of measuring any quantity: by pure numbers alone, or by the means of vectors (supersets) etc, or by sequences like the decimals (subsets).  
  
Again, the example of the numeral system as a precise implementation of द्यावापृथिवी (among many other possible examples) is produced here only for illustration. One should defer till later to ascertain the validity and consistency of the relation between द्यावापृथिवी and संख्या mentioned here, or the other examples possibly to be explored later. There is yet other point: द्यावापृथिवी occurs heavily in the Vedic literature, even though for the present the discussion is to be considered self-contained.
