नमस्ते BM,  
  
I think when RNI said "unusual" he meant "interesting" and not "inadequate". I appreciate the fact that he asked an important clarification.  
  
As far as this thread is concerned, already at least BM, RNI, and KT - I consider as collaborators. If we further go on, we can expect to be joined, vigorously, by Sanskrit scholars (as primary specialisation) who though now perhaps overwhelmed with "unusual" terminology will see through the connection. And not to forget the fact that Vedic ideas completely form the framework here, my own past work being in the Veda. The next example (semantic) of a toy-model of द्यावापृथिवी should, hopefully, invoke more interest, therefore.

N.B. : I thank you again for the suggestion; it would indeed be an honour to collaborate (formally or otherwise). For the present, I am working alone (in the strict sense of academic orientation).
