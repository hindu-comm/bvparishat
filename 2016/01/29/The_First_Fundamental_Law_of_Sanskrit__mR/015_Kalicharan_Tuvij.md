नमस्ते RNI,  
  
Thank you for posting.  
Zero is better known, and generalised, as the principle of Identity in higher mathematics. Emmy Noether showed that the principle of Symmetry (which is based on mathematical Identity) is the principle behind all universal laws (including even Gravity).  
  
All modern Physics models use this principle (e.g. gage theory) to build predictive models of physical reality.  
  
This is old news in Science. However, if you want further clarification I will try to explain, within available contexts, the Identity. Yet that is not needed because I am anyway covering it wholesomely in the present discussions. Out of ten or so names mentioned of it Veda, I have mentioned only one: पर्व for the present purposes.  
  
Please don't go by popular writings proclaiming zero as an invention (invention means, artificial implementation). At worst, zero can be said to be an implementation of Identity (but I meant Identity when mentioning zero).  
  
Just as the modern linguistics is an outcome of research on Sanskrit, the modern Science is an outcome of research on numeral systems. The race is still on to uncover the deepest layers of the numeral system.  
  
Sanskrit and numeral system both come from the same दैविक layer. This thread seeks to establish, and find, the same.
