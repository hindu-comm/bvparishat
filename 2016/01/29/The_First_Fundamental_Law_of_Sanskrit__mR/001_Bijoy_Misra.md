Dear Prof. Tuvij,  

Thank you for the posting.  

I think you would make a stronger contribution by staying with Panini than dragging religion into it.  

Sanskrit is scientific and that has to be analytically established. The convergence of Hinduism to  

Sanskrit is more of convenience than necessity. In my view, the ideas of "Hinduism" existed before  

Sanskrit language was formalized. We still have to investigate the older Indian languages and their  

relationship to the natural events and human vocal system. This is indeed fundamental work.  
संस्कृत is already an adjective, we would not need extra qualifiers to decorate it.  

I would love to hear more.  

Best regards,  

BM
