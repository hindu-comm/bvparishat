नमस्ते,  
  
By first fundamental law of Sanskrit, I mean:  
one of the starting principles of Sanskrit (first or second, not that relevant).  
By starting, I mean "grounds up".  
Principle means सिद्धांत. But here a naturalistic one, not contrived.  
  
A naturalistic starting principle is a Law (which I translated as धर्म). The basis is naturalistic (gravity, zero, etc), but the implementation can be artificial (building bridges, planes, etc).  
  
If the basis is artificial, it is called rule (not law). Panini's system belongs to this category. On the other hand, I have proposed a naturalistic basis (law, not rule). And hence the need of theory and proof.  
  
Re context and orientation:  
By "The Giants carry little on their shoulders, so must we become Ants." I meant - among other things - that there is no available context on this subject, and so we (must) build a self-contained context ("work, and bear like ants").  
  
On posting in full:  
Perhaps you are right. In that case I should come back to this thread and post my full paper (or give link). I may do that, but that may take a year or two (time limitation). Clearly, discussion as a style may not work, is perhaps not working, since scholars are too specialised in their respective fields to be able to respond within reasonable time.  
  
Still, this thread is open and I will like to hear more.
