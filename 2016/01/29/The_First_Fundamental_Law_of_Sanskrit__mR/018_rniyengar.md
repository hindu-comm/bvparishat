The dissection of "Dyaavaa-prthvi" in the thread rang a bell in my mind as being somewhat similar to breaking a "doublet" in fluid mechanics. (Interested persons can get an idea on wikipedia). Out of sheer curiosity combined with my search for 'zero" in the vedic texts I asked my question. I know nothing about principle of identity or symmetry in higher mathematics, nor about Emmy Noether's work on Gravity.

My own simplistic and naive understanding of Zero has been as the 'Únion of all null sets', \|\| सर्वेषां अभावानांसमाहारः शून्यः \|\|Well, this may not make any sense to learned Naiyyaayikas. Please excuse me!

  

So, I am out of reckoning.......Thanks to Dr.Misra for his kind suggestion, but frankly I am unequal to the task.

  

Regards
