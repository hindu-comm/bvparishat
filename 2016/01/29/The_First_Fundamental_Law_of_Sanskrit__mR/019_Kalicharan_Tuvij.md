Shri RNI and Shri BM : I will give this some more try, as I am quite liking the conversation. I have only said that the theory is falsifiable from even the specialists' positions (mathematicians, physicists, logicians, samskritists, vedists, etc); but to understand and exercise control over the flow and the matter of this thread no domain-specific expertise is a requirement. In fact in the discussions to follow immediately, it is exactly the kind of मेधा of men of Science/ Technology such as RNI and BM that is required to make the thread progress to a point where Sanskritists can easily take up from (if not earlier).  
  
Even as I write I am aware of my own limitedness, but then also positively of my "Ant credentials" which RNI and BM also have demonstrated amply already by their humility. BM has been very perceptive in assessing with laser precision from the outlines itself that the thread is indeed the subject he has keen interest in. The point is, different specialists may come along even later: no need to wait for them. Experiments are expected to fail most of the time, aren't they.  
  
If propriety is an issue in someone's mind, let me reinforce my earlier intent of free sharing by stating that any Indian living in India has unlimited rights to make use, commercial or otherwise, of any intellectual capital being generated in this thread, and any contributor to this thread also agrees to this condition.

Let me do a quick summary of द्यावापृथिवी क्षेत्र discussed so far:  
द्यावापृथिवी has two components द्यो and पृथिवी which are connected via पर्व.  
Subsets द्यु3 of द्यो consists of all relations (talks) of द्यो.  
Subset पृ3 of पृथिवी consists of all relations (talks) of पृथिवी.  
  
पर्व is the क्षेत्र through which an element or set in द्यो talks to an element or set in पृथिवी. We can see पर्व as the bearer of that communication.  
  
Note that "bearer" of communication is different from communication (talk) itself, as we know it is द्यु3 and पृ3 that are the talks.  
  
पर्व is then the bearer of talks between द्यो and पृथिवी. Similarly there can be bearers of talks for communications within द्यो. Let us group all such into one subset and call this subset as द्यु2. Continuing in the same manner, let us assign पृ2 as the bearer-subset for all talks within पृथिवी.  
  
Now we have, for example in द्यो, द्यु3 which is the talks, द्यु2 which is the bearer of talks, and द्यु0 (i.e. पर्व) which is a special bearer (bearing talks from द्यो to पृथिवी).  
  
Let us club all subsets and elements of द्यो that "do the talking" and label it द्यु1. Similarly, club all subsets and elements of पृथिवी that "do the talking" and label it पृ1.  
  
Finally, let us club all the remaining subsets of द्यो and label it as द्यु4. Similarly label as पृ4 all the remaining subsets of पृथिवी.  
  
To conclude here, the द्यावापृथिवी model is:  
द्यावापृथिवी \| ( द्यो \| द्यु0, द्यु1, द्यु2, द्यु3, द्यु4) (पृथिवी \| पृ0, पृ1, पृ2, पृ3, पृ4)  
  
This is all there is, fundamentally, to द्यावापृथिवी.  
  
Let us consider an example now, to clarify our thinking.  
  
A Football match: a toy-model of द्यावापृथिवी  
  
The football game is chosen for the following reasons:  
a) football is a good representative example of team related games.  
b) football is a very dynamic and fast paced game played at a reasonable complexity level, hence is very naturalistic.  
c) the rules, though many of them being artificial, are designed to keep complexity level reasonable, by separating the game activity from the activities of the rest of the world, as well as limiting the scope of game activity (e.g. players on the field don't do tax returns, etc).  
d) games are fun, and they have universal appeal. They reveal many things and possibilities about humans (not experienced in routine life).  
  
So, suppose we have teams क and ख on the field, in action.  
The two teams are immediately understood as the two components of द्यावापृथिवी.  
  
More importantly, पर्व here is a set of two elements: the ball, and the referee. As we have already seen, पर्व belongs to both components, and is the only means of communication between the two. (In a football game, the teams only interact with each other via the referee or the ball.)  
  
In each team, we have different players classified as defenders, midfielders, forwards, and goalkeeper. All these belong precisely to one or other of:  
( द्यो \| द्यु0, द्यु1, द्यु2, द्यु3, द्यु4) (पृथिवी \| पृ0, पृ1, पृ2, पृ3, पृ4)  
  
While the answer may be immediately evident to some of the readers here (especially those conversant with football terminology), I will take up this in the next posting.  
  
  
N.B.  
It should not escape our attention that the same द्यावापृथिवी which implements into संख्या is now being shown as equally applicable in the radically different football example. This is just scratching the surface, though.
