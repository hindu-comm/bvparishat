नमस्ते ।  
  
Theorising is a necessary evil. Let me put this way:  
A Law is a discovery, and theorising is like building a path (or, context) that facilitates the understanding of the discovery. A path to a destination.  
  
It is essential - as Prof BM rightly points out - to be as direct and succinct as possible; a straight road is as we understand the best road. But building a straight road is a particularly difficult task. So that's why the present theorising is far from complete/ mature (and which is not from any of my notes or memory or whatever) and is just a preliminary, in-context attempt to make something accessible to someone. If I succeed in this effort, I expect to be corrected and improved upon by others (even about the present theory, if not to talk of other possibly better approaches) who are by then in possession and understanding of the law.  
  
Bluntly put, if BM did not intervene in this thread, in instalments hypothetically I would've posted a monotone whole text. In reality BM has so far intervened and pointed out lacunae in my approach and forced me accommodate better formulation; that's true even as I write this. Indeed, my promise to spell out the law was conditional: dependent on response, there being is no use talking to my shadow.  
  
And no one would notice; as "it should not be anyways possible - after ages since Panini - to be still able to talk about प्रथम: धर्म: मूल: संस्कृतस्य."
