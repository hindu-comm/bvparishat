नमस्ते ।  
  
The क्षेत्र द्यु0 = पृ0 connects as well as separates द्यावापृथिवी — i.e., acts as the barrier between द्यो and पृथिवी. This fulfils separation as a basic requirement as per formulations 1-4.  
  
Let us call द्यु0 = पृ0 as पर्व (knot).  
  
Barriers define boundaries which restrict communication (allowing free communication only within the boundaries). द्यो and पृथिवी are allowed to "talk" to each other only via the पर्व क्षेत्र. पर्व therefore necessitates the existence of "talk" within द्यावापृथिवी.  
  
That is, द्यु1, द्यु2, द्यु3 etc in द्यो "talk" with each other only in द्यो; पृ1, पृ2, पृ3 etc "talk" with each other only in पृथिवी; and द्यु1, द्यु2, द्यु3 etc of द्यो "talk" with पृ1, पृ2, पृ3 etc of पृथिवी only via पर्व क्षेत्र.  
  
Let us first consider the talks in द्यो. What kind of talks are these? Where these belong?  
  
According to axiom-B, द्यावापृथिवी has unlimited explanatory and predictive power. This means no comprehensible (or, finite) idea should be beyond it.  
  
Therefore, the "talks" of द्यो must be a subset of द्यो. Let us arbitrarily assign द्यु3 to be that subset. Similarly, let पृ3 be the subset of पृथिवी containing all talks of पृथिवी.  
  
To conclude this posting, the existence of the separator (connector) पर्व क्षेत्र, द्यु0 = पृ0 necessitates the existence of द्यु3 and पृ3 as the "talk subsets" of द्यो and पृथिवी respectively. We also saw how the talks can also be termed as connections, relations, operators etc.  
  
N.B.  
  
In संख्या implementation, basic operators - and + are द्यु3 and पृ3 respectively, 0 is पर्व.  
And this is how द्यो and पृथिवी interact with each other via 0 (पर्व) :  
-3 +3 = 0  
  
Beyond this point संख्या, or even advanced models (e.g. algebraic topology, so on) of mathematics, will be rather restrictive to account for all richness, so we might as well take up a semantic toy-model example of द्यावापृथिवी.
