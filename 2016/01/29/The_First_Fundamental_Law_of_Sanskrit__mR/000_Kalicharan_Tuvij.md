नमस्ते ।  
  
Purpose of this thread:  
  
1. To propose "the first fundamental law of Sanskrit" that underpins a deep basis principle (hitherto not discussed elsewhere to the knowledge of this author) of the देवभाषा.  
  
2. To share and discuss this first principle with BVP scholars and researchers, so that this author is spared (originally intended) time and effort in bringing out all that in a publication form (disadvantageously monologue), which in the general interests is better suited to be shared - and let grow - freely.  
  
3. To show, within the context, among other things that Sanskrit far from being merely a mathematical language (courtesy पाणिनि as we know) is of the nature of pure maths itself; even so, while the first principle is rooted in the दैविक formula of द्यावापृथिवी and therefore belongs to a system that is more than merely multidisciplinary.  
  
4. Sanskrit is a common ground, a meeting place, for all diverse streams of Hinduism. Therefore, to show (hopefully) that the first law is better seen as springing from that common ground (restricted to Hinduism).  
  
I will be illustrating further, gradually, with time permitting.  
  
  
KT.
