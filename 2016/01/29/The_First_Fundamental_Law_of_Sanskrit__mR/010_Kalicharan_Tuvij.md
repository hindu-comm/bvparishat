Prof BM,  
  
I've already indicated my pledge to - rather than deliver a monologue - make the subject matter accessible to all BVP scholars who choose to interact in the thread, no matter however naive stuff they come up with.  
  
That is why I appreciated your presence on the thread, independent of your express interest or not in the subject.  
  
"The Giants carry little on their shoulders, so must we become Ants." - if you know what I mean.  
  
Adopting a discourse model is not a new scholarly mode in our tradition. Internet facilitates it, why not make use of it in the manner.  
  
Reverting to the topic,  
The exposition has been self-contained, so multiple reads will help clarify the ideas. Yet I will soon take up a toy-model of द्यावापृथिवी which is a semantic example, so that will help us be at more ease.  
  
In the meantime, do you have anything particular in mind?
