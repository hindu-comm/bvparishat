I can link you with the Vedanta-sara with two commentaries.  
  
<https://archive.org/details/The.Vedantasara.of.Sadananda.With.Commentaries.of.Nrisimhasarasvati.and.Ramatir>  
  
The text of Sadananda with the commentaries of Nrishimhasaraswati and Ramatirtha. This Ramatirtha was the Guru of Madhusudana Saraswati(citing from Neal Delmonico's translation of the Vedanta-Sara).  
  
  
Is it all right?
