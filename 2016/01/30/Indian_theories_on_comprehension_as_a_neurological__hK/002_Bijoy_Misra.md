Nagarajji,  

I have come up to 400 stanza in Book II.  

He hints about the process and creates the vocabulary of स्फोट.  

I am of the view that there is semantic processing filtered from the sensory input.  

I would wait eagerly on your views. I would encourage others to comment.  

Indian analysis on information processing far outweighs than what modern science  

has come up so far. The idea is that "it is possible" to have our voice and  

thinking "pure", approximating देव as Prof Tuvij wrote. It is a magnificent  

cosmology.  

  

Gandhi died 68 years ago. He would like that we are thinking India's contributions.
