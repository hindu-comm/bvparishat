\> I am not a fan of Pillali's work,



Yes, I can understand. I too have many problems with that translation.



For example, let us take the unit ade of the sequence of the three verses :



यथानुवाकः श्लॊकॊ वा सॊढत्वम् उपगच्छतॆ /

आवृत्त्या न तु स ग्रन्थः प्रत्यावृत्ति निरूप्यतॆ // वाक्य\_१।८४ //

प्रत्ययैर् अनुपाख्यॆयैर् ग्रहणानुगुणैस् तथा /

ध्वनिप्रकाशितॆ शब्दॆ स्वरूपम् अवधार्यतॆ // वाक्य\_१।८५ //

नादैर् आहितबीजायाम् अन्त्यॆन ध्वनिना सह /

आवृत्तपरिपाकायां बुद्धौ शब्दॊ ऽवधार्यतॆ // वाक्य\_१।८६ //

This unit, particularly the last verse of the threeis an explanation of how the memory of sense-effect of each of the phones in a sequence of phones, say a word, registered in the brain is retained in the brain and how all such 'seeds' (memories) of (sense-effects caused by) thethe sound (wave of each of the phones) contribute together with (thesense-effect caused by thelast (phone's)sound(wave) to the flashing of ( the identity andmeaning of ) the word, asthe cumulative outome of the repetetions (ofaffecting of senses byall the phones).

As an anology, the case of memorization of the veda mantras is cited in the first of the three. Though the duration of retention in the case of memorization of the Vedas is longer and the same in the case ofword- cognition and word-comprehension is minutely small, the point of similarity isthe cumulative effect of all the retentions on the final outcome.

Such nuances are not properly captured bythe translation of aadaraNIya vidwan Raghavan Pillai.
