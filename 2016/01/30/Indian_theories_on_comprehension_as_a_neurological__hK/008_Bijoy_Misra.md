Dear Nagarajiji, Bhatji,  

We have analyzed these in our group here. I would like to see any discussion on बुद्धि.  

In our earlier work we coined a phrase called ":cognitive memory". This has to do  

with the semantic comprehension which we claimed is a an internally guided activity  

beyond the lexical assimilation. We are trying to connect prosody into our earlier  

thinking.  

I would like to get hold of any vedic literature (i have not read the Vedas) dealing  

with छन्द connecting to प्रत्यय if it exists.  

Thank you.  

Bijoy
