Dear friends,  
  

I am indeed sorry for the negativity of my observation, but this was the reaction  

of a Physics student who wanted to stay in India for family reasons.
There was  

a lot of technological work, but nothing "original Indian". People looked to the  

west for ideas and work. The whole line of work in cosmology, health sciences,  

neuro-science, number theory, musicology and languages were not advanced.  

I left being oppressed through the strange political events of the '70s.  

  

India is just not another country looking for attention in the world.
It discovered  

human living and knowledge of the universe. Hopefully we champion the areas  

of wholesome aesthetics of human life as conceived by our early scholars.  

I agree it would need more investment in human resources and might be slow  

in its reconstruction. But we try with determination. We have to think original  

like Valmiki, Panini, Bharata and Bhartrhari. Please forgive me if I touched any  

sensitivity, but do feel the freedom of academic inquiry that India taught to  

the world.   
  

Best regards,  

BM
