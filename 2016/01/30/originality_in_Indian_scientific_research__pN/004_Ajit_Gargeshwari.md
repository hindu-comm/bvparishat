There were good scientists in India in The past and there are at present. A great Scientist remarked goverment spending towards fundamental scientific research is low and lower still for humanities what can one expect We produce less papers than China which is fact which cannot be ignored. Our best brains prefer to work is US or Europe than in India. This is good topic But may not be related Sanskrit Studies was my point. Thanks
