I agree Prof. Mishars remark is a sweeping negative comment which can be ignored. He needs to update his knowledge about contribution of Indian Scientist after Sir C.V. Raman. probably he knows Sir C.V. Ramans work and nothing else. One can go to Google and gather enough generic information.  

After having said this it is true particularly in the area fundamental sciences or basic research Indian contribution is dismissively low. Since this A Sanskrit List lets discuss what concerns us rather than Science and India scientists contribution. We can skip Scintific discussions unless it pertains to Sanskrit
