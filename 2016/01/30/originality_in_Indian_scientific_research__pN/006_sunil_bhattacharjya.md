Dear Dr. Mishra..  
  
It appears to me that in your first mail you wanted to draw attention to the psychosomatic effects of the Varna-system on the human beings. If Valmiki is to be believed, the need the for the Varna-system was realized in the Treta yuga only. We also know that "Birds of the same feather flock together. Thus there was the formation of the different Varna groups, which led to different lifestyles in the different varna-groups, such as in the vocations, food-habits as well as in the types of social interactions within the different varna-groups. It is quite possible that there also occurred the consequent psycho-somatic effects.
