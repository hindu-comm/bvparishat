Dear Vishvas,

  

The problem with the source you cite is that it is, after all, a blog. It is not a peer-reviewed publication. There are a bunch of articles cited at the end, but no inline citations. The author of the blog writes anonymously (he may be known to some people though). Unless his/her findings are put to the litmus test of peer review by experts in the field of genetics, the article does not deserve to be taken seriously. I am not a geneticist, so I will not pass a judgement on the article. But if Nature publishes his article, I will read it. One must also remember that the author is an expert at personal attacks and name calling (his laundry list where he labels those he strongly disagrees with as ‘mlechCha subversionists’ and describes them in unflattering terms is on full display here: <https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/11/29/the-mlechcha-subversionists/>)

  

Given this, please tell me which academic publication (or forum) of repute would accept this blog as a credible/reliable source?

  

Thanks, Nityanand
