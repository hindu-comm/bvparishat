It is misleading (mathematical dishonesty) to discretize a variable and use rank correlation and then report that as "some correlation" between the continuous variable and an ordinal variable.

Anyway, how can you be sure that author discretized the distance and used rank correlation or are you guessing? The author may have also assigned numerical values to ranks and used raw correlation. Are you guessing? If you are, please say so. If you are not guessing and know it then please let me know what measure of distance was used? What numbers were assigned to caste ranks? Which rank correlation measure was used (Spearman's rho or Kendall rank correlation coefficient) for ordinal data.

At least be precise and clear when you talk mathematics.

Sorry Vishvas, this is not lack of spoonfeeding. This is hiding mathematical approach, statistic and level of significance used.

You showed rank correlation to be measurable after a variable transformation. Not the same thing Sir, we need to be precise and unambiguous in math. Journals like Nature are. The blog with its careless use of mathematical terms is not.

In defending careless use of mathematical terms and guessing transformations or citing natural language in defence in place of questioning the author what he exactly meant by that unclear statement, your arguments are more emotional and less rational.

I am at a loss to understand the tendency to disrgeard peer review and scientific publishing standards and take quasi scientific blogs to be authoritative.
