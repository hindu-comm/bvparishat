Dear Vishvas,

  

I have some trouble understanding your post.

1\) What do you mean by प्राचीनजनसञ्चारपाण्डित? The term जनसञ्चार is used for mass communication. What do you mean by पाण्डित (पण्डितस्यायं पाण्डितः?)? प्राचीनजनसञ्चारपाण्डित=Old mass communication scholar-related? I do not get the context for mass communication.

2\) What is नाकतिदूरम् (or is it नातिदूरम्)?

3\) Lastly, what is अजयविद्वत्परिषत्? Do you mean Ajit Ji by अजय? This is not Ajit Ji's forum, he is only moderating it on behest of the owners.

  

लेखनं आर्याक्रमणविषये should be लेखनम् आर्याक्रमणविषये (मकारस्य पदान्तस्य अनुस्वारः आदेशो भवति हलि परतः, अत्र त्वचि परे न स्यात्).

  

If the blog article was on poetics, music, or literature, I would have had this problem. But don't you agree that genetics is a field of natural science? Do you think a piece of scientific writing which is anonymously authored, which is without inline citations, and which is not peer reviewed is reliable or credible? Irrespective of whether the reader is old school (प्राचीनजनसञ्चारपाण्डित?) or not (पामरेभ्योऽस्मादृशेभ्यो?), should not the reader be concerned about acceptable standards in scientific writing? Even Wikipedia, citations from which are not accepted by universities, does not accept blogs as reliable sources and recommends inline citations for articles.

  

You say the author is not inexperienced (is that what you mean by न अदत्तहस्तः?) in publishing in magazines \[like\] Nature and Science. If that is the case, can you please identify the author and list his/her publications? Also, it beats me why the author is writing anonymously on things like genetics and AIT if he/she is capable of publishing in journals like Nature and Science.

  

Here are some tips on evaluating a source from OWL (Purdue University's Online Writing Lab).

I would apply each of these to the manasataramgini blog article. Especially the third last last point:  

“How credible is the author? If the document is anonymous, what do you know about the organization?”  

I know nothing about the author or organization (if there is one) behind the blog. Hence, I would rather not rely on the article.  

  

Thanks, Nityanand
