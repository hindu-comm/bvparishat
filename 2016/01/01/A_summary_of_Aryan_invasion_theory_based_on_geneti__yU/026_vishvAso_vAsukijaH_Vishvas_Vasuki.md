Addressing the more general point raised (in this and another thread) by shrI nityAnanda about whether a blog article is worth discussing:

  

The answer is patently yes, IMO. This thread, and the blog author's statements have helped clear several misconceptions (such as the one about the 2009 Nature paper). It has presented a clear plausible view, based on genetic and other evidence about how AI may have happened. More to the point, it presents a clear opinion which one can discuss - and in this case, it is about as good as the opinions we send each other by email (it is not like shrI nityAnanda puts inline references in his emails).

  

Ultimately, irrespective of what shrI nityananda or myself think, I am certain that scholars are able to judge by themselves whether reading a blog post (anonymous or otherwise) or an email based upon it is worth their time. After all, as the great poet said: सन्तः परीक्ष्यान्यतरद्भजन्ते मूढः परप्रत्ययनेयबुद्धिः॥ . If some people are not interested (as often happens with any large population), they can just skip and go to the next thread.
