Dear friends,  
  

I have not read the blog that is referred, but I have enjoyed previous posts by Sri Visvas. AIT is a questionable concept  

but has been championed by people through unscientific work. The literature has grown, but such literature on wrong  

assertions is common in the history of science. New genetic work done here at Harvard and in India appears to  

contradict any foreign incursion at least for the last forty thousand years. This work is open literature.

I hosted Dr Reich's talk in 2009 when the results were first published.
The idea is the population in India did possibly arise  

through two streams one inhabiting the south and other inhabiting the north. The exact migratory path is still debated.  

But it has little to do with some people to sneak in through the Khyber pass!  
  

I don't approve of the anonymous ":hit and run" blogs. I do request Mr Visvas not to encourage such wasteful work.  
  

Happy New Year.
