Thanks Nityanandji. AIT can be discussed on BVP but should be restricted to experts and discussions should focus on peer-reviewed publications ideally it should be started by the authors themselves. The thread initiators should actively take part and close such discussion as I or the moderation team of BVP list are not AIT experts. Having said this the moderation team do read with great interests books articles and view on different aspects of AIT.  

Its best not to bring Blogs to the notice of BVP list unless the blog has peer-reviewed research on AIT
