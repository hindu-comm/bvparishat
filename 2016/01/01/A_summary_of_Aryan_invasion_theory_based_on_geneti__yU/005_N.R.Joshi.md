Discussion on AIT and OIT



If aryans reached Indian subcontinent in prehistoric time, they have to come by land route that covers the land of ancient Persia (Now called Iran) and Afghanistan. I do not see much effort on the part of the interested scholars to look into the ancient history of the land now called Afghanistan. I cannot understand this reluctance to retrace the path of Aryans from Afghanistan to Europe. It will produce wealth of new information if efforts are undertaken with open mind by the scholars interested to know the truth behind AIT.I am not in favor of AIT or OIT. I am in favor or the ancient Mahabharata empire. Thanks . N.R.Joshi

Since the AIT, OIT etc.. are of concern to hindu history, here is a summary of one formulation ( <https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2015/12/12/a-note-on-the-early-expansions-of-the-indo-europeans/>) of AIT based on genetic evidence -<https://atlas.mindmup.com/2015/12/3ad6d9908a930133bcfa17117fe97817/ait_mt_2015_v2/index.html> . General flow is: Top to bottom, left to right.
