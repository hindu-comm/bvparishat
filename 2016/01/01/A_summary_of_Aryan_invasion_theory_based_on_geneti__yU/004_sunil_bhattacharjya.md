Namaste Ajitji and Nityanandaji,  
  

There are random collections as presented in the different blogs at different times and there have also been sporadic works of fundamental nature including such works based on archaeological and astronomical evidences, in the AIT & pro-AIT debate. All these will settle only when the important milestones in the ancient Indian history are settled. The so- called genetic evidences have not been able to present any umambiguous testimony in this debate. Till a comprehensive textbook addressing the ancient Indian Chronology from a scientific viewpoint becomes available for the students of the new generation, this to & fro tussle between the pro-AIT camp and the anti-AIT camp will go on. **Let us hope that sooner than later, the Apex body on Historical Research in India will organize an official debate, where the scholars of both the camp can come together to sort out the issue.**  
  

Regards,
