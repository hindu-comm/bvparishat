Dear friends,  
  

Even the so-called established academic historians have to be questioned. In her paper entitled "Puranic Lineages and Archaeological Cultures",Prof. Romila Thapar has written as follows ;  
  

***Many attempts have been made to work out the chronology and perhaps the most detailed is that of S.N.pradhan, Chronology of Ancient India (Calcutta, 1927)***  
  

Any conscientious scholar would certainly wonder as to how could an established academician like Prof. Romila Thapar endorse the book of Sita Nath Pradhan, which, to my knowledge, tells us that the Mahabharata war foght around 1150 BCE.  
  

Regards,
