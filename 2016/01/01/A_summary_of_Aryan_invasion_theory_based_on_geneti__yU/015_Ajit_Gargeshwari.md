Dear Sunil ji,  
  
Your dates on Indian chronology is well known on this list lets leave chronology. If

 

you have anything against Prof. Romila Thapar

please take it up with her on the appropriate forum. than a one line rejoinder here. Date of Mahabharata war is always a conjecture and no absolute proof can be given. Lets us focus on AIT on this thread else lets close this thread.  

  
Dear Vishvas ji  
  

This note is for Vishvas; May be Visvas has nothing else to think right now except make remarks on those who say that his views are not acceptable this is one of the main problems of AIT we have too many unverified claims and blogs.We have engineers and doctors who randomly write on AIT. Many good articles have been written by both the proponents and those who are against AIT in Academic journal and books. I request Visvaji to display his credentials in genetic, Comparative philology mythology linguistics, Philology Indo european linguists and related inter disciplinary areas before he starts objecting to anything I have to say on AIT. I have already said I am not an expert on AIT that doesn't mean I will accept whatever any blog or Visvasji says on AIT.

  
  
अजितस्य विद्वत्परिषत् = अजितविद्ववत्परिषत्। ममाभिप्राये इदम् एवास्यास् सभाया उचितं नाम। यतो हि राजेव (:-)) सभां पालयत्यसौ यदृच्छया, नास्त्यस्य प्रष्टा कश्चिदिव भाति।  

Writing is prolix Sanskrit does not make one a better scholar this my opinion  

  

Regards
