It has presented a clear plausible view, based on genetic and other evidence about how AI may have happened. More to the point, it presents a clear opinion which one can discuss - and in this case, it is about as good as the opinions we send each other by email (it is not like shrI nityAnanda puts inline references in his emails).

Sir, my mails are not meant to be cited or taken as authority anywhere, more so in scientific matters like genetics, statistics, or history.

If somebody did that, I would opose that too.

We need to respect scientific rigour. Which the blog artickes do not exhibit and which Nature articles do. Do you think the whole scientific community is mad to discount anonymous faceless blogs like MT? If you do, you are living in a parallel universe.
