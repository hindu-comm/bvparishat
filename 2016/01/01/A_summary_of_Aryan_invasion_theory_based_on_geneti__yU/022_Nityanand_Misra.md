I am sorry to post on this thread despite saying in my previous post that it was my last. But as Vishvas Vasuki askd asked me to show a flaw in *any single scientific piece of writing* on the manasataramgini blog, let me satisfy his challenge by scratching the surface (I am sure more flaws can be discovered if the articles are peer reviewed).

  

Article link: <https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2009/10/05/a-note-on-some-recent-work-on-india-genetics/>

  

In a statistical context (where we have PCA, eigenvectors, distances being discussed), the author says:

  

Quote

"There is some correlation between caste rank and north Indian location and the closeness to the Europeans. Thus the kashmIrian brAhmaNa-s are closest to the Europeans in this sample, followed, northern vaishya-s, kAyastha-s and south Indian shUdra-s."

Unquote

  

There is a flaw here. Either the author has an incorrect understanding of what ‘correlation’ is and where it should be used, or he is misusing a mathematical term in a statistical context. Caste is categorical variable. Caste rank is an ordinal variable. Closeness or distance is a real valued variable. A correlation between a numerical (real) variable and a categorical/ordinal variable (group or rank) makes no sense at all. Further, what makes the author say ‘some correlation’? Correlation has tests for significance and is either significant or insignificant at a certain significance level. If the author did not use the term in the mathematical sense in a statistical context, then what is the meaning of ‘some correlation.’ Some is a word used to express an unspecified number or amount. So it can be used only with a countable set or measurable quantity. Which does not make sense here.

  

There is another minor flaw. The second statement starts with the word ‘thus’. It should not as it does not follow from the first.

  

In the article from Nature (which the author calls English scientific tabloid) under <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2842210/>, I did not find a single statistical term being used loosely used or a single statistical technique being misapplied.

  

This is the difference between an established source like Nature magazine where every sentence is proofread, reviewed and edited, and a quasi-scientific blog.

  

It is surprising (or is it shocking?) that Vishvas Vasuki who appears to be a rational individual is unable to see through this and puts the MT blog articles on the same level as articles published in Nature.
