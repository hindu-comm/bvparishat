Dear list members

  

The list owner, moderator, and Dr. Bijoy Misra are justified in saying that the thread has not added much value on AIT or genetics. Vishvas has said that he may share a bibliography of recent papers and books on this topic and their summaries. I welcome this. That would bring something useful to me and the list. I also welcome the criticism of my posts by Dr. Bijoy Misra and the scholar who emailed the moderator, and hope it will help improve my contributions to the list.

  

I do think there are some aspects other than AIT and genetics which came up in the course of the exchanges. I will start another thread on the same.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
