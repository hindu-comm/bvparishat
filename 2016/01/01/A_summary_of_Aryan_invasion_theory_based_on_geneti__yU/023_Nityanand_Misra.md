Dear Vishvas

  

You have pasted snapshots (where you searched for a term: ANI) and copy-pasted portions from a blog. I have not seen any original contribution from you on the thread, hence I am not sure of your experience in genetics. In other words, so far, your posts have not exhibited a deep understanding of the subject.

  

Nevertheless, it appears you have read \[portions of\] some papers on genetics and AIT. I am sure there is more than two papers and what the MT blog says that has been published recently on genetics of India population.

  

May I request you to please compile a bibliography of recent books and papers on this topic that you have read and briefly summarize (in your own words) the works and offer your views (agreement or disagreement, again in your own words). That will be helpful to everybody on the list and will save my time too.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
