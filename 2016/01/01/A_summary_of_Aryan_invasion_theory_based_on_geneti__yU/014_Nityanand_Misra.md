Dear Vishvas

  

Let's abide by the decisions of the moderator and trust Veeranarayana Pandurangi Ji's choice. I personally believe its best to raise moderation issues privately with the list owner (Veeranarayana Pandurangi Ji) and moderators (Shrinivasa Varakhedi Ji and Ajit Gargeshwari Ji).

To reiterate, I asked (rhetorically) if

A\) a piece of scientific writing which is

B\) anonymously authored, AND

C\) without inline citations, AND

D\) not peer reviewed

is reliable or credible.

  

Your counter-examples are based on clause C alone, you probably interpreted my ANDs as ORs. Nevertheless, I would like to say

1\) On Pañcatantra and Hitopadeśa: these are fables, they are not scientific writing (does not meet clause A).

2\) The Adventure article: It is not anonymously written (does not meet clause B). It may or may not have been peer reviewed, but it was certainly edited and reviewed by the magazine staff. The Adventure magazine had as many as 13 editors (see here <http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/writers-photographers.html>) with John Rasmus being the Editor in Chief. To add, National Geographic is one of the foremost scientific organizations in the world. A publication from such an organization simply cannot have the same reliability as a post by an anonymous blogger.

It is difficult to cross-verify. No page numbers cited for books. The bibliography has 6 books and 14 articles and there are no inline citations. Do you know which statement in the article is from which book/article.

I do not think I should be asking the blogger. You cited the article on this forum, hence IMHO you owe an answer to the question about the identity of the blogger. You seem to know him. If he is aसुप्रतिष्ठित scientist, why can you not name him?Who gives theअधिकार of naming the blogger?

  

I am sorry I cannot (and no rational individual can) accept it blindly that the author is aसुप्रतिष्ठित scientist: a name and list of publications is needed.

Do you have enough training in genetics to conclude that the content of the article isयुक्तियुक्त?Or is it your faith in the author that makes you believe so?I am not a geneticist. I cannot evaluate whether what the author says isयुक्तियुक्त or not. If the article was peer-reviewed or edited then there would be a good chance of the arguments beingयुक्तियुक्त. We need some yardsticks, and OWL tips only help us assess if the publication meets those yardsticks.

  

We need some standards in scientific publishing, else even Bubba Free John can be cited on genetics and AIT.
