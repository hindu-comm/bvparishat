Namaste  

  

The first two volumes of *Tulsidas: The Epic of Ram*,the seven-volume English translation of Gosvāmī Tulasīdāsa's Rāmacaritamānasa by Prof. Philip Lutgendorf (University of Iowa), have been recently published by the Murty Classical Library of India (MCLI) and are now available for purchase.  

  

The two volumes cover the complete Bālakāṇḍa of the epic. The first volume covers stanzas 1–175 and the second covers stanzas 176–361.

  

The bibliographic details along with table of contents of the two volumes are available from the Harvard University Press website under the following links (from where they can be purchased too)

This is the newest English translation of the Rāmacaritamānasa, nearly 135 years after Frederic Salmon Growse translation gave us the first one around 1880 CE.
