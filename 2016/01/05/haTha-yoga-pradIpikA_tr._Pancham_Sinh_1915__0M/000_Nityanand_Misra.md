Dear list members

  

I am looking for a scanned copy of the English translation of Haṭha-yoga-pradīpikā by Pancham Sinh (1915).

  

I am aware of the digitized text on sacred texts website ([here](http://sacred-texts.com/hin/hyp/index.htm)) and [archive.org](http://archive.org) ([here](https://archive.org/details/HathaYogaPradipika-SanskritTextWithEnglishTranslatlionAndNotes)).

  

I am looking for a scan of the original book.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
