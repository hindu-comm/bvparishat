\~\~ śrī-śrī-rādhā-dāmodarāya namaḥ \~\~

  

I am attaching the pronunciations of :

  

hrasva

dīrgha

pluta

  

लृकार

  

as well as the pronunciations ofलृट् and लृङ्

  

It should be noted that since लृकार is a svara, we should be able to pronounce it continuously as we can pronounce all other svaras. If we pronounce it as "lri", then the continuity cannot occur. Hence, the pronunciation is as i have given in the audio file attached.

  

sādhu-caraṇa-rajo 'bhilāṣī,

  

hari pārṣada dās.
