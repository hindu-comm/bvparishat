Dear all

  

FYI

Please see attached Unicode code page for Devanagari. Please have a look at the vowel ऌ that comes after vovel ऋ

Does it look like लृ as in लृट् lakaara ?  

I dont understand the confusion between the vowel and the conjunct cosonant.

As as been said before by others, the vowel ऌ does NOT have any 'r' sound at all to best of my knowledge.

  

I remember an entire article in Sambhashana Sandesha many years ago on this subject.I request someone at Samskrita Bharati to let us know what issue this article appeared. All issues are online so we can refer there easily.

  

  

regards
