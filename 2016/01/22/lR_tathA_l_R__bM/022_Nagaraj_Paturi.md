Dear Sri Shrikant Jamadagniji,



You are absolutely right. The script symbolsare different. But are being taken as the same.



But the audio of the Maheshvara sutras shared by one of the posts in the thread shows that some learned scholars too pronounce wrongly.



So there is a need for clarification.



Thanks and regards,



Nagaraj
