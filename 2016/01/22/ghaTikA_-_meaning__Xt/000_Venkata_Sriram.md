नमस्ते,  

  

The wordघटिका also means a "Pot" which were abundant in gurukulAs where vEdAs and other shAstrAs were taught.

  

श्री भाट्टसोमेश्वर in his commentary onतन्त्रवार्तिक explains as:  

  

घटिकायाम् कुम्भाभ्यां निक्षिप्य, तत्त्द् वेदविभाग परिक्षाकाले

तानयाकृष्य .........वेदं पठ इत्यध्येतराः अनुयुज्यन्ते इति घटिकामार्ग्वर्तिनो

अनुयोगः ॥

  

In days of yore, the vedic examinations were conducted using the "Pots" (घटिका) and the place

where these were kept were calledघटिकास्थानं . To test the vedic excellence of the student,

examinations were conducted using these Pots.

  

For example, to find out whether a particular student has mastered a particular mantra (ऋक्) orअनुवाकः

from a vEda, the Pots were arranged in such an order that serves as a clue that examiner was

asking him to chant a particularऋक् of a particularसूक्तं of a particularअनुवाकः in a particularमण्डल.

If the examiner wants to listen 5th rik of 3rd sUkta of 4th anuvAka from 2nd maNDala of Rg veda,

then the following number of pots were arranged in a cluster as 2-4-3-5 pots respectively.

  

Later, this system took micro-form owing the difficulty in arranging pots and jotting down of

numbers in palm leaves got replaced. These palm leaves were dropped in the Pots and

a leaf was picked up randomly from pot and was given to the vedic student study to recite

on the spot.

  

As the vedic schools were filled filled with "ghaTikAs", they were called as "ghaTikAsthAnAs".

Of course, in purAnAs, the word "Asrama" "Guru-kula" were mentioned which later transformed

as "ghaTikAsthAna" eventually. 

  

I was speaking to a vedic scholar who told me that vidyApITa and vishwavidyAlaya

were of modern origin only whose mention is not to be found in our ancient texts.

  

regs,

Sriram
