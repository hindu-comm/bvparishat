Dear Dr. Dey,  

I am sorry for being late in replying. May be I am missing the context.  

Ludwig commented in German in his translation of the Rigveda. Grassmann translated into German, but read along with his Woerterbuch zum Rigveda they can be regarded as translation with commentary. Geldner too did the same in the twentueth century. I have heard of Brereton-Jamison's translation (HOS) but not seen it yet.  

Best
