I don't think any of the works mentioned by by Prof Bhattacharya are commentaries on the entire Veda. They may be explanatory and scholarly works on a topic dealt in the vedas. No foreigner has written any commentary on the Vedas. All their works focus on translation interpretation and analysis. If one can consider works of Kapili Shastri as commentary on the veda then one may include the works mention by Prof. Bhattacharya

न जायते म्रियते वा कदाचिन्नायं भूत्वा भविता वा न भूयः।  
अजो नित्यः शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणो न हन्यते हन्यमाने शरीरे।।2.20।।
