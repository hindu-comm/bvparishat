Namaste,  
  

It appears to me that one aspect of the sapinda marriage has not been looked at. May be that in the Gandharva style of marriage or the prema-viavaha (or love-marriage in the English language), which is considered the highest form of marriage, there could have been some leeways allowed and the marriage of sapindis accepted, provided, of course, both the boy and girl don't have health issues. Arjuna and Subhadra's marriage obviously fell in this category and that could be the reason why Lord Krishna supported that marriage, whereas Lord Balarama objected to that as the latter believed in the conventional standards.  
  

Regards,
