Dear Venkatesh Murthy Ji

  

As you began this thread with a question, I am curious if the question is primarily from a legal perspective or a Dharmashastra perspective or from the perspective of a biological fitness? The thread has seen comments on all of these. A couple of points to add on your response.

Certainly not all children born from consanguineous marriages are deformed, and I am sure Prof. Korada Subramanyam Ji did not mean “all children” born from such wedlocks are deformed. The right questions to ask from the perspective of biological fitness is:

  

Is there a higher rate (risk or probability) of certain genetic disorders in children born to consanguineous marriages, as compared to other marriages? Is this change statistically significant?

  

I suggest you compile a list of papers or books which have dealt with such studies over large sample sets and where inferences are based on sound statistical analysis (hypothesis testing at a certain level of significance).  

  

One of the papers I know of is

  

Hanan Hamamy. *Consanguineous marriages: Preconception consultation in primary health care settings*. Journal of Community Genetics. July 2012; 3(3): pp. 185–192. Link: <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3419292/pdf/12687_2011_Article_72.pdf>

  

From the section*Consanguinity and health parameters:*

  

*The reproductive health criteria related to consanguinity show that in first cousin marriages as opposed to nonconsanguineous marriages, fertility rate is slightly higher, abortion rate is not different, stillbirths and infant mortality rates are slightly higher and birth defects frequency is estimated to be around 2–3% points more than the background rate among newborns in the general population (around 2–3%).*

  

From the conclusion:

  

*Consanguineous marriages are associated with an increased risk for congenital malformations and autosomal recessive diseases, with some resultant increased postnatal mortality in the offspring of first cousin couples, but demographic and socioeconomic confounders need to be well controlled. No major adverse associations with reproductive parameters such as miscarriages and fertility have been documented. Associations with quantitative traits and complex adult-onset diseases are vague and inconsistent, suggesting the importance of implementing future research in this area.*

The above citation is a general observation. As it is neither a legal perspective nor a Dharmashastra perspective on the specific topic of cross-cousin marriage, it may not be very relevant here.  

  

Thanks, Nityanand
