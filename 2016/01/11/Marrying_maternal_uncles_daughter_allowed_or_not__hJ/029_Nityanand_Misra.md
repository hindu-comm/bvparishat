Dr. Paturi Ji

  

There may be a paradox/self-contradiction between two recommendations/teachings (e.g. teaching 1: One should not lie; and teaching 2: One may lie to save one's life). There may be a paradox/self-contradiction between two descriptions (e.g. description 1: X happened; and description 2: X did not happen). But how could there be a paradox/self-contradiction between a teaching (MBh verse 13.44.18) and the description of an event (Arjuna/Pradyumna's marriage with a sapinda)? The former is what MBh recommends, and the latter is what it describes as what happened.

  

I hope the commentator Nilakantha understood the spirit behind the letters of Mahabharata. His commentary may throw some light.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
