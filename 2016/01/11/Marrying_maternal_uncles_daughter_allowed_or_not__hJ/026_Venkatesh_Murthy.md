नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Manu and other Smrtis allow Sistacara depending on local customs also. Cutting off mother's head by Rama cannot be compared with marrying maternal uncle's daughter. Because cutting off mother's head is not Sistachara in any place. But marrying maternal uncle's daughter is accepted custom for many many generations in South India. We have to compare apples to apples but not apples to oranges.

  

Is it धर्मव्यतिक्रमः or शिष्टाचार ? This is the question to answer.

  

Moreover local customs have to be respected.

  

It is also not true children born will be deformed. We can see many many examples of children of these marriages are perfectly normal.

  

Kindly see this book page 46 -

  

'Local customs and practices trump textual descriptions and details of rituals and practices and this has also been upheld by Supreme Court of India.'
