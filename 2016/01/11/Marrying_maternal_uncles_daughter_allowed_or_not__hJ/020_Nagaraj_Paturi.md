\>Well, the Mahābhārata also has examples of polyandry (Draupadī) and \[rākṣasa\] marriages involving abduction of the bride/brides

\>(Arjuna abducting Subhadrā; and also Bhīṣma abducting Ambā, Ambikā, and Ambālikā for Vicitravīrya). It is a different thing for an \>epic to document an event (or a practice), and for dharmaśāstra-s (Gṛhya Sūtra-s, Smṛti-s, etc) to allow/approve it.



It is true, it is a different thing for an epic to document, let us say 'reflect', 'include', 'cover'an event (or a practice), and for dharmaśāstra-s (Gṛhya Sūtra-s, Smṛti-s, etc) to allow/approve it.



But why would at all an itihaasa like Mahabharata include such practices?



Let us take the case of polyandry. Draupadi is listed among pativratas. Manyfrom the present day ask, 'can a woman with multiple husbands be called a pativrataa ?'. I ask them, 'if you were to study a tribe in whichpolyandry is practised and if you notice the tribal community find fault with a woman who has an affair with a man other than her 'ritually' married husbands, would you say, 'what is wrong, she anyway has multiple husbands' ? Can we say call it weird if that community admires the equally committed love of a woman of that community to all her multiple husbands ? The cultural relativistic, pluralistic understanding that is required to appreciate the spirit of such a community in disapproving or admiring such behaviours is what the author of Mahabharata seems to have intended to instruct through his work.



Even some university title-holding anthropologists describe the matrilineal system that prevailed in Kerala in a highly politically incorrect and offensive manner within and outside their class room teachingbecause of lack of such a cultural relativistic and well nuanced understanding of practices unfamiliar to them. Author of Mahabharataappears to have intended toavoid such poor understandings of human cultures.



Only such a magnanimous intention on the part of that author can, I think, explainthe coverage of such a wide range of cultural practices, including those which anticipate some of the newly emerging ones such assurrogacyin Mahabharata.



Des'aachaaras aviruddha to the spirit of the s'ruti and smritis also need to be viewed with such an understanding instructed by such great Itihasas.



Thanks for your patience.

Nagaraj
