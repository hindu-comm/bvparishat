Namaste Sri Deekonda ji

  

There may be cases like this. But there are also cases with perfectly normal children. The scientific research on this is saying the birth defects and other problems is slightly higher for cousin marriages.The reference paper quoted by Sri Mishraji and others alsoare saying only 2-3% higher. Sorry your case may be in that extra 2-3%.

  

But what about other cousin marriages producing normal children? They will say cousin marriages has some advantages. It is good for the girl. She is not marryinga stranger and going to bed with that stranger. She knows the husband's family and has affection for that family before marriage itself. The family cultures will be matching. There are so many advantages for the girl. It has advantages of love marriage and arranged marriage both. Because if it is only love marriage the cultures may not match. And parents may not be willing. If it is only arranged marriage the girl or boy may not be willing but forced toagree by elders.

  

There are different types of cousin marriages. But onlyfew are correct according to Dharma. Maternal uncle's daughter and paternal aunt's daughter may be

married. Even a girl can marry her maternal uncle. But Maatula Kanyaa is the hot favorite. Even manySouth Indian films have love storieswith MaatulaKanyaa. Majority of cousin marriages are of this type.
