Smṛti texts do not approve of sapiṇḍa marriages. For example Yājñavalkya Smṛti says (YS 1.52-53): अविप्लुतब्रह्मचर्यो लक्षण्यां स्त्रियमुद्वहेत्। अनन्यपूर्विकां कान्तामसपिण्डां यवीयसीम्॥ अरोगिणीं भ्रातृमतीमसमानार्षगोत्रजाम्। पञ्चमात्सप्तमादूर्ध्वं मातृतः पितृतस्तथा॥ These verses are also found in Garuḍa Purāṇa. Similary, Manu Smṛti says (MS 3.5): असपिण्डा च या मातुरसगोत्रा च या पितुः। सा प्रशस्ता द्विजातीनां दारकर्मणि मैथुने॥

  

Kumārila Bhaṭṭa observed the practice prevalent in southern regions and condemned it. For a comprehensive reading including definitions of sapiṇḍa, please refer P. V. Kane (1941). History of Dharmaśāstra. Volume II, Part 1. pp. 452-466. Poona:Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute. Kane covers the explanation that Kumārila Bhaṭṭa offers for the case of Arjuna and Subhadrā. Kane also covers the justifications of cross-cousin marriages offered by some works but they are later works (compared to Kumārila Bhaṭṭa’s work) if I remember correctly.

  

There have been several discussions on BVP on the topic, Prof. Korada nicely summarized the situation[here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/0GBw9HBQZUI/g_WFmckxCVcJ), before remarking  

*“as per the tradition and also scientifically marriage between near / related people is not advisable.”*  

  

Sapinda relationships are also defined in the Hindu Marriage Act which says  

*(f)(i)“Sapinda relationship” with reference to any person extends as far as the third generation(inclusive) in the line of ascent through the mother, and the fifth (inclusive) in the line of ascent through the father, the line being traced upwards in each case from the person concerned, who is to be counted as the first generation;  
*

*(ii) two persons are said to be “sapinda” of each other if one is a lineal ascendant of the other within the limits of sapinda relationship, or if they have a common lineal ascendant who is within the limits of sapinda relationship with reference to each of them;*

As per the same act, one of the conditions of marriage is  

*(v) the parties are not sapindas of each other, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two;*  

  

The custom permitting such marriages, as referred to in the Hindu Marriage Act, is prevalent in southern India alone. In other regions, especially in northern India, such marriages are socially unacceptable and are considered incestuous as cousins are seen are brother and sister: girls and women tie rakha-s for cousins on Rakshabandhana and Bhai-Duja days.
