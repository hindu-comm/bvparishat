Thanks Prof. Paturi Ji for your thoughts. I agree that nobody has the right to judge a community in its admiration or disapproval of specific behaviour (e.g. how a community which practises polyandry views adultery), or call it‘weird’. I also agree with your statement that the author of the *Mahābhārata* had a“cultural relativistic, pluralistic understanding.”However, it must be remembered that the same *Mahābhārata*, whose author shows this understanding and who was witness to cross-cousin marriages (marriages with *sapiṇḍā*-s), says that marriage should be with a girl who is neither *sapiṇḍa* nor *sagotra*. In the didactic dialogue between Bhīṣma and Yudhiṣṭhira in the *Anuśāsana Parva*, Bhīṣma supports the what is said in the *Manusmṛti* (MBh verse 13.44.18 in the Gita Press edition):

  

असपिण्डा च या मतुरसगोत्रा च या पितुः।

इत्येतामनुगच्छेत तं धर्मं मनुरब्रवीत्॥

  

Hindi translation by Rāmanārāyaṇa Datta Śāstrī Pāṇḍeya Rāma:

“जो कन्या माताकी सपिण्ड और पिताके गोत्र की न हो, उसी का अनुगमन करे। इसे मनुजीने धर्मानुकूल बताया है।”

English translation by Kisari Mohan Ganguly:

“One should wed that girl who is not a Sapinda of one's mother or of the same Gotra with one's father. Even this is the usage (consistent with the sacred law) which Manu has declared.”

I have not seen the commentary by Nīlakaṇṭha on the above verse.While the author of Mahābhārata shows a greater understanding of human cultures and may not describe a system/practice in unflattering terms, he does give space to the dispassionate opinion of Bhīṣma (which might as well be the opinion of the author).

I agree, and as the above verse shows, *deśācāra*-s which are *viruddha* to the guidelines in *Dharmaśāstra*-s need to be viewed dispassionately as instructed by the *Mahābhārata*. In public discourse, there is no space for politically incorrect and offensive manner (e.g. description of matrilineal system of Kerala in unflattering terms), although we cannot dictate what people do ‘off the record’. Similarly, there is no need to be an apologist or take offence at dispassionate analysis in public discourse: historical studies on marriages with *sapiṇḍā*-s and their prevalence in certain Vedic communities in spite of them not being recommended in the *Dharmaśāstra*-s would only help our understanding of a culturally diverse country.



Thanks, Nityanand
