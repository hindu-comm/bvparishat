Namaste,  
  

Sometime ago I read an anecdote, according to which Ravana came to know that Lord Vishnu would be born to Kaushalya, in order to kill Ravana. To avert that, Ravana kidnapped Kaushalya and put her in a metallic box and let the box go in the river, hoping that she would die. Luckily for her Dasharatha saw the box and tried to bring the box out of the water but in that process he too fell in the water and he and the box landed in some isolated island. Later on they could come back home and Dasharatha married Kaushalya. They had a daughter "Shanta", who had some physical disability, because of which Shanta could not walk well. It came out that Dashartha and kaushalya were related and that is why their daughter was born with health problem. Shantar was given to Dasharatha;s friend Lomapada, who married Kaushalya's sister and they did not have children. Gradually Shanta's disabilty disappeared..  

  

From this anecdote it means that in the ancient times, people knew that there could be health problems in such unapproved marriages.
