\>However, it must be remembered that the same *Mahābhārata*, whose author shows this understanding and who was witness to cross-cousin marriages (marriages with *sapiṇḍā*-s), says that marriage should be with a girl who is neither *sapiṇḍa* nor *sagotra*. In the didactic dialogue between Bhīṣma and Yudhiṣṭhira in the *Anuśāsana Parva*, Bhīṣma supports the what is said in the *Manusmṛti* (MBh verse 13.44.18 in the Gita Press edition).

--------- Is this a self-contradiction or a paradox (a seemingly absurd or contradictory statement or proposition which when investigated may prove to be well founded or true.)/ virOdhAbhAsa (AbhAsa of virOdha) ?



Best way out in such cases is to rule out self-contradiction, given the greatness of the authorand try to understand the spirit behind the letters that can accommodate both what is made to be instructed in such dialogues and what is depicted in the book.
