Respected Scholars,

  

After all this long discussion about marrying maternal uncle's daughter, I think it is time to record our experiences or observations about the negative results of this relationship.

I would like to share our family's saga of giving daughters to sister's sons. This (evil?) yes I can call it so, was practiced since the time of my great grand father. Even my sister who is 68 was given to our cousin in marriage. I was too young to resist or protest. My aunt (my sister's mother-in-law) was also given from our family and her mother-in-law was also from our family.

  

My sister has a daughter. When she was 5 years old she developed leukoderma (Vitiligo). Despite, best available treatment, it did not go completely. We could only arrest it from further spreading. Doctors have told this girl that the reason for the ailment is inbreeding. One of her two brothers is also not in perfect health. It was hell to find a boy for her, in spite of her PG qualifications and good Job. She curses my parents, and the entire system day in and day out. I have also observed, that in many muslim families, where there are first cousin marriages, the progeny suffered from inborn defects.

  

This is for the information of all our brothers. In-breeding marriages, apart from being incestuous, in my opinion are a scourge, it should be condemned without resorting to any excuse. But, unfortunately, some big politicians in south India are encouraging such evil practices by following them in this modern society.

  

Dhanyo'smi
