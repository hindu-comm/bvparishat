Whatever dharma shastra says if one marries within ones own family both have the same genetic pool. This gives rise to in breeding. The decision is left to the individuals to decide if given a choice. But in most cases the individuals are not consulted and the couples tend to go along with family. This might have suited families that existed fifty or hundred years back when elders used to decide everything they refused to take a back seat and allow individuals to make decisions. Early marriages before the girl and the boy used to start earning was prevalent. One was were forced to be with family business or learning . Dissent and reasoning was not tolerated. Now in a changed environment marriages within a family is not the norm and are gradually being discouraged with increased awareness.  
  

Dharamashastra says marrying within the same gotra is prohibited. It makes no sense. People who have the same gotra might not be even remotely related. The law was amended to allow such marriages Dhamra Shastras are not absolute like the vedas. cChanges can be made depending on the will of the society.  
  

Venkatesh Murthy ji's remark  
  
'She is not marryinga stranger and going to bed with that stranger. She knows the husband's family and has affection for that family before marriage itself. The family cultures will be matching. There are so many advantages for the girl. It has advantages of love marriage and arranged marriage both. Because if it is only love marriage the cultures may not match. And parents may not be willing. If it is only arranged marriage the girl or boy may not be willing but forced toagree by elders."  

  
My reply  
  

My grandmother first saw of grand father only in the marriage hall when the ritual of opening the parda between the bride and the bride groom takes place he saw my grand mother. They were related to each other. When goverment took away our lands under the amended laws. He was forced to study further and make living no family came to his rescue. I see no advantages for the girls. Girls in olden days were not educated were forced to be dependent on male members and were not given choices. Now its changing with women becoming aware of their rights. Why should parents agree or disagree if one wants to marry unless one cannot stand on their feet or need their money or help? Why parents or any one else be bothered at all its a individuals personal right freedom privacy and decision. I am a south Indian and the very concept of Matula Kanya is revolting to me. If it Pitula Kanya is sister and matula kanya its not .How silly can argument get.  
  

Anyway would like to end with this note do want to enter into long and protracted debate due to time restrain But will answer replies soon.
