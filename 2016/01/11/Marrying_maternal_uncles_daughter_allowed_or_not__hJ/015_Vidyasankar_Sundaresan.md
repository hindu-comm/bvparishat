Part of the joy and also frustration of askinga scholarly group like thisa question, "what vivaaha practice should be followed?," is that nobody will tell you exactly what to do! There are the sapinda arguments on the one hand and customarily allowed practice in south India (excluding Kerala but including many parts of Maharashtra and Orissa) on the other hand. One can listen to lots of traditional points on both sides without ever getting convinced one way or the other. And then there is the loss of genetic diversity argument that you will hear nowadays from the perspective of modern science as well. However, an instance of marrying within close relations here or there does not necessarily cause health problems for children born into the marriage. However, if such a practice is continued for many generations, the chances of losing genetic diversity and therefore of perpetuating problematic genetic issues will increase rapidly.  

  

My personal take on it is this. If you or the immediately concerned family members have any kind of reservations about the practice of marrying cross-cousins (or a maternal uncle), please don't do it! There is no point in getting into a marital relationship with doubts and hesitation. If you or the family or your community have no problems with the practice, please don't worry whether that violates some other traditional rule.

  

So, do not force a cross-cousin marriage upon unwilling young people citing family custom or deshaacaara as reason. The world today is very different from even twenty years ago. On the other hand, do not force it the other way round either, citing some traditional reason that has been alien to your own community tradition for at least a few centuries now.  

  

Best regards,

ps. Namboodiri Brahmins in Kerala traditionally did not adopt cross-cousin or maternal uncle marriage customs, but that is also correlated with their other rule that only the eldest son married a Namboodiri girl. The younger sons entered into spousal relationships with women of other castes that were matrilineal and matriarchal in their practice. The vast majority of Namboodiri girls died unmarried, so there was no dearth of choice of bride for any young Namboodiri man. The Nair and other castes also avoided the practice of a girl marrying a maternal uncle, because the girl and her uncle both belonged to the same tharavad, the female lineage equivalent of the male lineage gotra.
