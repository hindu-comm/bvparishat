Namaste Venkatesh Murthy Ji

  

Kane mentions that this verse (from the *Khila* portion of the *Ṛgveda*) is cited to justify sapiṇḍa marriages in the *Smṛticandrikā* and the *Parāśaramādhavīya*. Both *Smṛticandrikā* (c. 1200 CE) and the *Parāśaramādhavīya* (c. 1350 CE) are much later compositions than the *Smṛti*-s and both were authored in the South. As Kane points out, the same verse is interpreted to mean the opposite (i.e., as pointing to prohibited degrees of marriage) by Aparārka and Viśvarūpa when commenting on *Yājñavalkya Smṛti* I.53 (Kane, HODS, Volume II, part I, pp. 461-462). Kane also observes that the*Smṛticandrikā* goes a step further in by citing a verse addressed by Yamī to her brother Yama which “does not clearly refer to cross-cousin marriages” (ibid., p. 463). So, the interpretations of*Smṛticandrikā*and the*Parāśaramādhavīya*are debatable. It may help to see all interpretations and commentaries on the verse to see how the understanding of the verse varied with time and/or geographical regions.

  

It may also be helpful to look for works which trace the origin of *sapiṇḍa* marriage in South India. Was *sapiṇḍa* marriage originally approved in Vedic times, later abandoned in rest of India and explicitly forbidden/condemned by authors of *Smṛti*-s? Or did it originate in the South from the regional non-Vedic culture? How about Namboodiri Brahmins of Kerala where cross-cousin marriages are prohibited (e.g. see Mencher and Goldberg, *Kinship and Marriage Regulations Among the Namboodiri Brahmans of Kerala*, Man, 2(1), March 1967, pp. 87-106).

  

Lastly, Anilkumar Ji brought up medical aspects and genetic effects of consanguineous marriages. On this, one may refer Kumaramanickavel G et al (2002), Consanguinity and ocular genetic diseases in South India: analysis of a five-year study, Community Genetics, 5(3), pp. 182-185. The abstract of the paper is available here: <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14960889>.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
