Namaskaar Sri Mishraji

  

When there is conflict between श्रुति and स्मृति the श्रुति will win according to Mimamsa.

  

In श्रुति there is a Vakya like this -

तृप्तां जहुर्मातुलस्येव योषा भागस्ते पैतृष्वसेयी वपामिव “Oh Indra! We offer to you the fat seasoned in the ghee that is thy portion, as the maternal uncle’s daughter or paternal aunt’s daughter is one’s lot in marriage”. मातुलकन्यापरिणयनस्यानेकश्रुतिस्मृतिसिद्धत्वात्
