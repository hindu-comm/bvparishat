Well, the Mahābhārata also has examples of polyandry (Draupadī) and \[rākṣasa\] marriages involving abduction of the bride/brides (Arjuna abducting Subhadrā; and also Bhīṣma abducting Ambā, Ambikā, and Ambālikā for Vicitravīrya). It is a different thing for an epic to document an event (or a practice), and for dharmaśāstra-s (Gṛhya Sūtra-s, Smṛti-s, etc) to allow/approve it.
