Way back in February 2015 when the same topic was discussed I had posted: Please see Harivamsha which is Khila of MBh. Vide Vishnuparva Ch.61. Pradyumna married S'ubhAngi daughter of his maternal uncle (i.e. Rukmi brother of RukmiNi). 

His son Aniruddha married Rukmi's granddaughter. This, if taken as historical, must have happened more than 2000 years back!
