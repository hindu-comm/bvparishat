The point in the 'same Mahabharata' and the emphasis in the word 'the same' has a pointing towards the opposition between the described and made to be instructed by one character to the other. I think the opposition between the two is the central semantics of the sentence quoted from AadaraNiya Nityanandji's post.

  

My question was how do we look at this opposition?

  

There must be some purpose in the description of an event which is apparent opposition to what is made to be instructed by one character to the other.

  

My understanding of the purpose is to instruct a spirit broader than that is apparent.
