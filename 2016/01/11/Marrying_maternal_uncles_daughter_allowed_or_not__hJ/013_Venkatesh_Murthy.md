Namaste

  

Yes there is a Mahabharata story -

  

"It hath been heard by us that there was a great Rishi of the name of  
Uddalaka, who had a son named Swetaketu who also was an ascetic of merit.  
O thou of eyes like lotus-petals, the present virtuous practice hath been  
established by that Swetaketu from anger. Hear thou the reason. One day,  
in the presence of Swetaketu's father a Brahmana came and catching  
Swetaketu's mother by the hand, told her, 'Let us go.' Beholding his  
mother seized by the hand and taken away apparently by force, the son was  
greatly moved by wrath. Seeing his son indignant, Uddalaka addressed him  
and said, 'Be not angry. O son! This is the practice sanctioned by  
antiquity. The women of all orders in this world are free, O son; men in  
this matter, as regards their respective orders, act as kine.' The  
Rishi's son, Swetaketu, however, disapproved of the usage and established  
in the world the present practice as regards men and women. It hath been  
heard by us, O thou of great virtue, that the existing practice dates  
from that period among human beings but not among beings of other  
classes. Accordingly, since the establishment of the present usage, it is  
sinful for women not to adhere to their husbands."

  

Coming to Sapinda relations we have to study the current practice. We are doing पिण्डप्रदान of offeringsesame mixedrice balls to only

पितृपितामहप्रपितामह and मातृ-पितामही-प्रपितामही in the regular श्राद्ध ceremony. Only in Mahaalaya Paksha there is पिण्डप्रदान

to other Pitrus like maternal grandfather. But in that same Mahaalaya श्राद्ध ceremony we are doing पिण्डप्रदान to even friends

and others. If we accept Sapinda to include offering Pinda to common person the friend's son will also become Sapinda. Because

he will also offer Pinda to his father. Then even friend's daughter cannot be married even if he has different Gotra.

How to solve this problem of Sapinda?
