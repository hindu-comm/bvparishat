Namo Vidvadbhyaha

  

I want to know if our Sastras allowa man to marryhis maternal uncle's daughter मातुलकन्या and also

paternal aunt's daughter पैतृष्वसेयी. Some people have criticized this practice in दाक्षिणात्यs. In

दाक्षिणात्यs a girl can even marry her maternal uncle. But in Mahabharata times itself we can see

Arjuna from Northmarrying his cousinSubhadra. Then why this complaint against दाक्षिणात्यs?

  

All these Vivahas will not be Sagotra Vivaha. Therefore they are not prohibited. What is Hindu

Law saying?
