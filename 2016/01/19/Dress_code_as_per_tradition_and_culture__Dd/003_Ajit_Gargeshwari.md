I agree with points 2 & 3. We should be focusing on points 2 & 3 and any other points members may have.  
  
With reference to point one normally removes the judges ignorance if the judges asks for it. One cannot assume the courts are ignorant. In this case the judge has not asked for public or scholarly opinion. One might have not asked yet gone can give advises as we live in free society but may not be accepted by the court. There are constitutional and legal issues which the court decides. In many cases courts have appointed and taken experts help as needed. Writing about sub judice matters will not help. You may want to check with a legal expert on this. Dr. Kalivardhana has clearly said " I am not trying to delve into politico-judicial domain and test correctness of opinions. I am just interested in theśāstraicinjunctions or traditional recommendations." I mentioned this as due to the posting format members may have missed these two important statements
