We can only discuss shastras and Sanskrit on BVP. Matters pertaining to court are best discussed within the courts or with the government directly . Lets restrict BVP discussions only on Shastras. My understanding is courts are entitled to take up any issue pertaining to Law & Indian Constitution lets us not decide or discuss what matters courts are entitled to take or not to take. Courts can decide on that not BVP mailing list. Thanks
