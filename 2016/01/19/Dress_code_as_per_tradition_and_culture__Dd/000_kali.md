HariH OM!

  

sarvebhyo namaskaraH,

  

I am not trying to delve into politico-judicial domain and test correctness of opinions..

  

I am just interested in theśāstraicinjunctions or traditional recommendations.

  

Recently, the TN Govt has gone on appeal against a single judge order on dress code to be followed in temples and hindureligious places.

  

The judge hearing the appeal has reportedly (DC 19th Jan 2016, pg 3, Chennai edition)posed the question: "Do you want to introduce the cultural and traditional practices that were followed before the British period?". He is reported to have remarked that "Tradition and Culture are not fixed entities".

  

I am trying to seek the opinion of the learned members of this forum regarding the following:

  

1. Was/is there any śāstraicinjunction as far as the dress code for temples is concerned?

  

2. Does traditional recommendations stay fixed over a time period or keep changing?

  

3. If they keep changing over period of time do they still retain thespirit of śāstraicinjunctions?

  

4. Whatis the cultural and religious impact of unrestricted dress practices in places of worship?

  

5. Finally, are courts and governments entitled to decide what is śāstra or tradition?

  

The last question pertains to imminent danger of mis-interpretation of śāstra or tradition by an ill-informed/not conversant with/inimical member of judiciary/administrationwhich is bound to encourage over enthusiastic elements on both sides of the divide.

  

An unbalanced and/or inimical rulingwill ultimately jeopardize age old customs and practices which are still pursued religiously by purists, in addition to encouraging attacks on religious sentiments of followers.

  

Where are we heading to?

  

DhanyavadaH
