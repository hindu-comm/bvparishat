1\. Suppose some scholar-member were to point out that judgment J-1 made by a certain modern judge runs counter to statement S-1 in such and such śāstra (preserved inSanskrit or some other ancient Indian language actually or possibly related to Sanskrit). Would the initial poster’s act of pointing out or our discussion of it amount to a disrespect for the judge/court? Is it not an ethical right or responsibility of the specialists to remove a judge’s ignorance?

  

2\. There are many statements in the śāstras, the rationale for which statements is not stated in the śāstra texts or is not known from the saṁpradāya-vṛddhas. The field would benefit from putting our heads together and trying to find out why the śāstras prescribed or proscribed certain things or actions.In the present state of our knowledge, even a collection of the (possibly different) rationales given in different parts of India may turn out to be as enriching as a close reading of relevant śāstra passages for any hints they may contain as to the reasoning behind traditional practices or prescriptions. (The exercise would be particularly valuable because Hinduism (in a broader sense of the word) at present largely comes across as a religion in which even its priests do not know why they engage in certain acts the way they do.)

  

3\. The social scientists of modern India commonly classify rationales into religious, philosophical, ethical, political, economic, hygienic, medical, legal, etc (an influence, at least primarily, of colonial education). The dharmic traditions of India do not follow such a classification grid. Are there any benefits, theoretical or practical, in not adhering to the currently dominant grid? Would our collection of possible rationales help us in understanding this difference fruitfully?
