Namaste  
  
As a part of literary Research activities of the Research Department of Krishnamacharya Yoga Mandiram - Vyāsabhāṣya to Yogasūtras have been translated into Tamil by me and have been published during the last week of December 2015. The work started in the year 2012.  



To enhance clarity of the translation, views from the four sub-commentaries of Vyāsabhāṣya viz. Vācaspatimiśra's Tattvavaiśāradī, Vijñānabhikṣu's Yogavārttika, śankara's Vivaraṇa and Hariharānanda āraṇya's Bhāsvatī have been provided as footnotes. Views from other commentaries like Bhoja's Rājamārtāṇḍa and Sadāśivabrahmendra's Yogasudhākara have also be included in some places in the footnotes.  
  

The translation is in three volumes  

Volume 1 - First pāda,Volume 2 - Second pāda,Volume 3 - third and fourth pādas.  
  

This is for your kind information.  
Also, I request scholars to suggest some research journals which may consider reviewing this work.Cover pages of the work attached herewith.
