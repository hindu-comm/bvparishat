But certainly wrong end not in Gitapress Edition as yourself have given in your first post:

Here is a phrase from Chapter I in KiskindhA (stanza 106 in Gita Press)  
जनकं पृष्टसीतं तं

Now you are giving a wrong reading as पृष्टासीतः जनकः as from Gitapress and declare it as Arsa.

Gita Press has correct reading and the commentators have correctly given the Vigrahavakya.

Yourself going against the grammar and calling it आर्ष a wrong compound formed by you attributing it to Valmiki. What is the matter?
