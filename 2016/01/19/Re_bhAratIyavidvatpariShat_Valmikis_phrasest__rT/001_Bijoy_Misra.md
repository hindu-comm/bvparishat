We know of Valmiki's famous line सीता मया दृष्टा  

Similarly the विग्रह here could be जनकेन सीता पृष्टा  

The question is whether the resultant बहुव्रीहि would be पृष्टसीतः जनकः or पृष्टासीतः जनकः ?  
  

As I understand, the first is Paninian and the second is Arsha.  

Is this right?  
The second is used in the Gita Press printing.
