You are right. I was stuck with the wrong impression.  

Everything seems to be in order.  

Let me continue.  

Thank you all for help.  
  

Our Valmiki reading anniversary would be May 8.  

We plan to stage three episodes:  

(i) Kaushalya's blessing to Rama (we have an elderly enthusiastic Kaushlya)  

(ii) Rama's meeting Bharata in Chitrakuta  

\(iii\) Rama and Lakshmana meeting Hanuman and Sugriva over Rshyamuka mountains  
  

I will edit material to enable the participants to memorize. Each episode could be twenty minutes.  

Please write if anyone has ideas.  
  

Best regards,  

BM
