Thanks for this link. I enjoyed the write up. There is a message to scholars (young and old) here at BVP also: I quote from the article:

  

"But again, that connection to modern mathematics and being able to tell the public accurately – that’s the beauty of what Sanskrit students can do in the future. Read these things. Know about them. Write about them. Do it in an accurate way. It’s not your agenda to show that everything originated in India. It’s your agenda to show what originated in India in an accurate and clear way.

How will the world make a judgement if India doesn’t begin to be its own ambassador about the things that happened here?

Please make it your duty to contribute accurately to our knowledge base while helping to preserve the treasures of India. I wish you great success in your future endeavours!"

  

I have highlighted the line I liked most! Thanks Sri Subramanian,
