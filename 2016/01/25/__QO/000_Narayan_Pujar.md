Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Tirupati**( Accredited at A Grade by NAAC, and declared as Centre for Excellence in Traditional Shastras, by the UGC )**has been striving successfully since its inception to protect and propagate the traditional shastras and to establish their unfailing relevance to the modern world. As a premier institution of Sanskrit education in India, the Vidyapeetha has recognised long ago that the purpose of education is not only to make the students acquire knowledge but also to bring out their hidden potentialities for their overall development. Conducting competitions of various kinds viz. literary, cultural, sports is one of the effective ways of drawing out the talents of the student. Keeping this in view, the Vidyapeetha organises every year literary, cultural and sports competitions for its students. As an extension of this programme, the Vidyapeetha now intends to organize a four day “Youth Festival” for the students of all Sanskrit institutions in India, in 28th to 31st January, 2016, under Vidyarthi Vikasa Yojana organized by Vagvardhini Parishat, an organization promoting literary and shastraic studies among students.
