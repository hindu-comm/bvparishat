Dear list members

  

Some of you may have already seen this. Prof. N S Ramanuja Tatacharya has been conferred the Padma Bhushan today.

  

I join all of you in congratulating Prof. NSR Ji on this well deserved honour.

  

Here is the notification on the website of the MHA: <http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/PadmaAwards_25012016.pdf>

  

Thanks, Nityananda
