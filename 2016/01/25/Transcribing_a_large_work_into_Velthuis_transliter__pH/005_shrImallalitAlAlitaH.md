No one may wish to put his effort to such promise, which has no legal-backing.  
  

My suggestion:  

Buy OCR software of Oliver(gives reliable results). Or learn to use tesseract, etc.(free software with learning curves)  

Use good scans.  

Convert to Devanagari with OCR.  

Convert to Velthuis with aksharamukham.  
  

If you have enough money, pay money and people will readily work with you.  

People need money to live! Rest is clear.
