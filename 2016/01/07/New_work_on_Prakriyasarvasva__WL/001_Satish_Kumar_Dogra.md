I contacted the number given in this post, and was told that the book *Prakriyasarvasva* *i*s partly in Sanskrit and partly in Malayalam. I am sharing this information for the benefit of those who, like me, might not be knowing Malayalam.  
  

Meanwhile, the person at the other end promised to send me a list of Sanskrit-only books. Once I get the list, I will share on this Forum.  
  

Dogra, Chennai.*
