Dear Satish Kumarji,  

I am the editor of***Sarvasvasamrddhi***. The person whose name I had given in my post is an official of our University. It seems that there is some misscommunication.

Our new work,***Sarvasvasamrddhi***is awork in sanskrit.It is a study exclusively in Sanskrit, on the*Prakriyasarvasva.*It contains four papers, as I have mentioned in my post.

It is the latest numer in the Calicut University Sanskrit Series brought out by the Department of Sanskrit, University of Calicut. We have not brought out any edition of*Prakriyasarvasva.*

I am a member of faculty. I would be glad to answer further queries. But the Publication officer (whose number I had given) is the authorised person to deal with the sales of books.
