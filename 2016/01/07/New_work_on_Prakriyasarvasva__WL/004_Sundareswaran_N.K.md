Dear Dongraji,

Glad to notice your ardent devotion to Sanskrit (I visited your site). Actally our latest book*Sarvasvasamrddhi*would come to open market only after ten days. Shall let you know as soon as it does. Meanwhile I would recommend our own publication **Subbaramiyam** to you. It comprises different genres in Sanskrit - like short story, poem, drama, sastric subjects like Grammar, Mimamsa and even Sanskrit aesthetics. You may go through the attached list of our publications (which is not updated. Our latest number is the 54th).
