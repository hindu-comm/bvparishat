Thanks Shri Sundareswaran,  

 I would be happy to get a list of books in Sanskrit. My interest is in getting books that are either exclusively in Sanskrit or would help one polish one's knowledge of the language. For instance, a book of translation from English into Sanskrit or a book of Sanskrit grammar could be very useful for me. But these should not be very introductory in nature, as I have fair amount of knowledge about Sanskrit grammar. What I need is an understanding of the more complex grammatical structures.  
  

If there is a novel in Sanskrit, I would love to get and read it.  
  

I shall be grateful if you could help me locate such books and tell me the contact person to whom I need to send money to get them by post / courier.  
  

Regards,  

Dogra, Chennai.
