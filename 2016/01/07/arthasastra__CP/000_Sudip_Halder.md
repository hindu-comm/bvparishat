respected scholars,

recently someone told me about two commentaries available on kautilya's *arthasastra*. these are ***jaymangala-kroda patra***,(different from famous *tika jaymangala*) & another one is ***vedanta-siddhanta- samgrha**.*

**

but i didn't found any information in NCC/CC.

  

so, i request all of you if anyone have idea about this work please share with me.

  

  

regards
