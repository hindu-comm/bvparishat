An interesting video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNI07egoefc>  
  
My Comments:  
  
This video applicable not only to visual art, but to all categories of aesthetics. Unfortunately, the bad news is that this will not change soon in the west.

  

The eastern art traditions feel comfortable in considering particular personalities as "authorities" in various arts. Sri Bharata-muni is the authority in nāṭya (dramatics), Mammaṭācārya is the authority in alaṅkāra (literary ornaments) and kāvya (poetics), Sri Ānanda-vardhana is the authority in dhvani (theory of suggestive poetry), Sri Rupa Goswami is the authority in bhakti-rasa (mellows of devotion) and so on.

  

In the Indian tradition, one cannot simply overrule their works and call his work "art". One can certainly improve upon them or challenge them, but such a challenge better be very good, for it will face stiff opposition from the intelligentsia who believe in the previous authorities. Only after centuries of struggle does a new form of art find its place in the Indian tradition.

  

In the west, all authorities are subject to a challenge by anyone and everyone at any point of time. Nobody can become an authority, for many dislike that word. Every authority in the west is challengeable and there is no absolute starting point to start learning most particular arts.

  

The result of an overdose of the "be yourself" mindset is that over the generations, the lowest common denominator also becomes known as art. A splatter of colors becomes known as a painting, random and unpleasant noises become known as music and uncoordinated body movements become known as dance.
