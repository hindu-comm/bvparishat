I don't know if he is a list member but do remember some post of his. He has too many blogs of his own

  
  

I end this note by requesting each senior scholar to post a note on the latest  

research work they have undertaken or wish to undertake. This could attract  

the new students and junior faculty to focus better and create something new  

and original. India has been known over time for her thinking capacity. BVP  
can help lead the effort by letting scholars exercise more in creative thinking.  

  
For this to happen we need quickly close threads. Then meaningful research and technical details from reputed scholars will start flowing in
