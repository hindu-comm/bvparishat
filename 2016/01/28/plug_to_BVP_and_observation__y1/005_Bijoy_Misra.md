Dear Nagarajji,  

Scholarly discussion is like an academic discussion. My request to all senior faculty members  

is to help announce their line of work to encourage new research. There is no need to publish  

papers here but it would certainly be helpful to present ideas and encourage new analytic thinking.  

It is high time India looks at the world and leads the research in Indology than just react to  

outside work which are mostly based on cultural ignorance. To think "new" is a pressure by  

itself, but it is the new creative work that shines as India's scholarship in history. Let the postings  
suggest the vastness of India and her potential in research. Prof Pandurangi and Prof Varakhedi  
may elaborate more on their comments in the video tape of Rajiv's talk at Karnataka Sanskrit University.  

Best regards,  

BM
