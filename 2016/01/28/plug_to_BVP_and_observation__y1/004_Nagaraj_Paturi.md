\> I have not seen any new research work in the list so far.



------ I don't think members consider lists to be the best places to publish new research.



Still, there were many new points that were made on this list by different members. But since lists are lists and not peer reviewed journals,such posts making new posts might not have followed all the protocolsand style sheets of research journals.



It may be a good idea to compile all the new points made by different scholars on the list.



\>This could attract the new students and junior faculty to focus better and create something new and original.



------- I don't think even junior scholars consider lists to be the best places to publish new research.



Junior scholars do get attracted to the list if they find conversations among senior scholars worth learning for them. I think alreadyBVP is able to give that inspiration. I see many junior scholars joining the list and participating in a big way. I find a few scholars younger by age butprodigally and venerably advanced in theirknowledge on this list.
