Friends,  
  

As an epilogue to Rajiv Malhotra's talk in Karnataka Sanskrit University  

Prof Pandurangi and Prof Varakhedi did give a plug to BVP and invited  

Rajiv to join the group. He might have joined. They also said that the  

list now consists of 1800 participants.  
  

I have been a member of the list for more than two years and I have benefited  

learning much of the new texts which I had no opportunity to come across.  

I rationalized my ignorance since I have never been a full time student in  

Sanskrit and I entered the literature with intent to design course material for  

the young men and women coming up abroad. I have occasionally posted  

my thoughts and have received useful feedback.  
  

While we do see scholarly analysis on scriptural materials, I have not seen  

any new research work in the list so far. Indology research needs historical  

analysis, correspondence of ideas, analysis of grammar and texts, evaluation  

of translations and creation of new materials among others. While it is good to  

react to the negativity propagated by vested individuals in the west or in India,  
the BVP as a group must proceed towards originality than wandering in triviality.  

Indian scholarship in historical times has never been defensive. I would urge  

all scholars to think of fresh ideas and extend knowledge in their own sphere  

as much they can.  
  

I end this note by requesting each senior scholar to post a note on the latest  

research work they have undertaken or wish to undertake. This could attract  

the new students and junior faculty to focus better and create something new  

and original. India has been known over time for her thinking capacity. BVP  
can help lead the effort by letting scholars exercise more in creative thinking.  
  

Best regards,  

BM
