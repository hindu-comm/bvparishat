Dear Friends,

  

I am looking forward to collate an Old Malayalam manuscript with some other Śāradā and Nāgarī manuscripts. These are a set of small number of verses (65 to be precise) from the Tantrāloka of Abhinavagupta. I must confess that I am completely ignorant of Old Malayalam. Would someone recommend an expert who I can manage to check the readings with using Skype etc or someone living closer to Udupi/Manipal/Mangalore? I would highly appreciate any help.

  

Thanks in advance and best wishes.

  

Mrinal
