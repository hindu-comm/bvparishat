This is the reason I suggested lets us not bring in needles controversies on BVP list. Please see the message in para two. Such controversies don't bring good to any one. They only leave us divided which is victory for the trouble makers. Probably Visvasji when he posted first did not understand but I did from the very beginning . I had even set guidelines for posting on AIT thread. Now its up to members to decide if discussions can be done in on this list in a dispassionate and impersonal manner. This is your list and almost all our members who themselves are top scholars can decide. If you want to discuss further please see the guidelines and reduce naming others and making attacks on individuals who may or may not be members of BVP. If it cannot be done lets close this thread and move on Thanks  
  
This a message we received from highly reputed scholar who is not stranger to AIT controversy. "The following post should be summarily removed from the list. To pass judgement on the "intellectual honesty"
of a person who is not a member and hence can not defend himself is cheap and unfair. It does not befit BVP to promote such statements.

with regards in the interest of the fair name of BVP"  
  
  

Please post you replies on this note directly to the moderators and not to the list if you need any further clarifications  
  

Other posts are welcome Thanks again. This is our list lets enjoy
