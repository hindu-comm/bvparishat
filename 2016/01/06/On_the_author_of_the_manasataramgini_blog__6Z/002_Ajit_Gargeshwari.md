Quotes on scholarship that illustrate Academic approach,selected by a student and web page designer (see below) from an interview in the book*Mastery: Interviews with 30 Remarkable People*by Joan Evelyn Ames.  
  
"An effective scholar needs three things: learning, the ability to see connections and, above all, \[an\] intellectual ability to distinguish."  
  
"The first rule of work must be readiness to examine your positions and to modify or abandon them without delay or embarrassment as soon as you know they are inadequate."  
  
"Intellect is the ability to see what the crucial issues are, to ask the right questions and then to understand the implications of the evidence."  
  
"Your perspective on a question must always be enriched by new questions, new evidence, and a growing knowledge of the wider context of the events or thoughts that concern you."  
  
"The understanding of Indian Culture can only aspire to objectivity if it includes a sincere effort to see how things are in the subjective perception of Indians. One has to be able to enter into the spirit of our world, to be with them intimately, to see what they are saying and why they are saying it, to go beneath the surface of their texts. There has to be empathy."
