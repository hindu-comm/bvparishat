Dear list members

  

As our dear friend Vishvas will not share (despite knowing) the identity of the author of the manasataramgini blog (or gospel?), let me make an attempt. All of the links below are accessed on this date (Jan 6 2016).

  

Multiple online message board posts, article comments and a Facebook post (examples[here](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/TheHeathenInHisBlindness/conversations/topics/6421), [here](http://forums.bharat-rakshak.com/viewtopic.php?p=1170357), [here](http://indiafacts.org/caste-system-colonial-idea/), and [here](https://m.facebook.com/KalavaiVenkat/posts/1469683233312048)) unambiguously identify the author of the manasataramgini blog as a person named L Aravind Iyer.  

  

L Aravind Iyer's home page is [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/staff/aravind/). On his official page, Aravind Iyer has a very interesting disclaimer which I swear I have never seen on the official page of an academic/researcher (for example see [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/staff/zhangd3/)):

“*This is the official webpage of L. Aravind. Any other webpage, blog (other than one linked below), social networking page claiming to belong to or represent L. Aravind/Aravind L. Iyer or his views or opinions is either some other person or the work of imposters. L. Aravind is also not associated with any other email address than the one provided here.*”  

There is no blog linked below.

  

A Wikipedia article on him is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aravind_L_Iyer). The article is very short, all references are from his own home page (which corroborates my guess that the article is planted by a fan or well-wisher) and the article receives less than 3 hits per day on average as seen [here](http://stats.grok.se/en/latest90/Aravind_L_Iyer)(which is rather small for a ‘supratiṣṭhita’ scientist, but anyway). Four times in the history of the article, he has been identified as the author of the blogs manasataramgini, Hauma Hamiddha, and somasushma as attested by the diffs [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aravind_L_Iyer&diff=385931621&oldid=385866269), [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aravind_L_Iyer&diff=387550666&oldid=387512412), [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aravind_L_Iyer&diff=387743289&oldid=387681087), and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aravind_L_Iyer&diff=388254036&oldid=387743289). All four times, the statement has been deleted by a user. The users inserting and deleting the statements have no major contributions to Wikipedia.

  

As per the online sources above and Wikipedia historical versions, Aravind Iyer also writes the blogs Hauma Hamiddha ([here](https://musingsofhh.wordpress.com/)) and somasushma (archived from geocities[here](http://www.oocities.org/somasushma/)). The archived somasushma blog carries his name and has his photos [here](http://www.oocities.org/somasushma/pictures.html). The photos are of the same person as one who features on the Wikipedia article on Aravind L Iyer[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aravind_L_Iyer).

  

On TheHeathenInHisBlindness webgroup, there is a person whose email name is *somasushma* and who signs as L Aravind with the link *[somasushma.wordpress.com](http://somasushma.wordpress.com)* (which is a private blog, maybe a newer version of the blog on oocities).   

  

The description by Vishvas Vasuki matches the person. Vishvas Vasuki says भार्गवोऽसौ. On his archived geocities blog [here](http://www.oocities.org/somasushma/), Aravind Iyer says "Whom do I descend from? From the redoubtable bhR^igu, atharvAn (paternally) ..."

  

It may also be pointed that L Aravind's beliefs and approach is not beyond question. His observations and approach have been challenged by [Prof. S. N. Balagangadhar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._N._Balagangadhara) (Ghent University) on multiple ocassions, some of which are (copy-pasted from a message board) [here](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/TheHeathenInHisBlindness/conversations/messages/5580), [here](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/TheHeathenInHisBlindness/conversations/messages/5583), [here](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/TheHeathenInHisBlindness/conversations/messages/5589), [here](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/TheHeathenInHisBlindness/conversations/messages/5592), [here](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/TheHeathenInHisBlindness/conversations/messages/5593), [here](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/TheHeathenInHisBlindness/conversations/messages/5595), and [here](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/TheHeathenInHisBlindness/conversations/messages/5603).

  

So it appears very likely that the anonmymous, \[ocassionally\] name-calling, know-all author of manasataramgini is Dr. L Aravind Iyer.

  

The million dollar question is why does a scholar need to be anonymous, disown all other blogs on his official homepage, create other anonymous blogs like Homa Hamiddha, and try to keep his identity a secret by deleting (or getting others to delete) references on Wikipedia?

  

The reason beats me, but this is **intellectual dishonesty**. Vishvas Vasuki, in my opinion, is wasting everybody's time by citing such dubious sources and lending them credibility. 

  

*Caveat lector*.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
