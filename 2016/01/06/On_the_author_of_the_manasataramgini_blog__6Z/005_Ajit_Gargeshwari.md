All messages of scholars will be posted There will be no censorship on scholars. We ourselves fight against censorship and hence we should not be doing it ourselves. Since the private mail came from a reputed scholars. I thought I should covey his views. Please continue the discussions I have no problems Lets keep the tenor and spirit as suggested by members Thank you
