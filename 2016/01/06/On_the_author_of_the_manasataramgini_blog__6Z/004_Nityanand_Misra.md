Dear list members,  

  

Please take my statement as an allegation, I am not passing a judgement. I am happy if the allegation is contradicted, challenged, and criticized. I am even willing to change my position if I am proved to be wrong or convinced otherwise.

  

But I do not understand the request to censor or delete messages, for I do not think questioning the reliability of a source and journalistic/intellectual integrity of a writer who is not a member of BVP is against the group policy. If it is against the rules of the forum, then I am sorry for violating the rules of the group and my message and the thread may be deleted.

  

Questioning the integrity of a source not on the group is not new to this forum or other lists. Some examples:

-   On August 3 2015 in
    [this](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/4r-I9NPNLNE/nXm9Q_5HDAAJ)
    post I accused the journalist Salma Mahmud (not a member of this
    forum) of plagiarism (lifting portions) in her article on Panini
    from Wikipedia.  
-   On August 22 2015 in
    [this](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/4r-I9NPNLNE/nXm9Q_5HDAAJ)post
    I accused, in an indirect way, the journalist Sidin Vadikut (not a
    member of this forum) of shoddy journalism (not cross-checking facts
    and taking Wikipedia for granted).  
-   On the Indology list in the month of [July
    2015](http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/2015-July/thread.html),
    Rajiv Malhotra (not a member of Indology list) was accused of, and
    even pronounced guilty of, plagiarism. There were mails against him
    and in his support, but I don't remember anybody asking to censor
    the accusations of plagiarism just because Malhotra was not a member
    of the group.  

Thanks, Nityanand
