Dear Prof. Korada,

The question was not about तुन्दपरिमृज, which was well explained by the Vartika and with your usual explanation from grammatical point of view.

The question is about the counter part, of तुन्दपरिमृज, not explained by the वार्तिक and निपात with क-प्रत्ययः।  
Simply कर्मण्यण् तुन्दं परिमृजति - तुन्ददरिमार्जः and its usage.

Thanks for your excellent explanation of तुन्दपरिमृज. The other word, if used at all, would mean one who moves his palm across/ around his belly with pain or some other reason would be तुन्दपरिमार्जः and he is asking for its usage.

For the use of तुन्दपरिमृज, there is मुरारिप्रयोग ---  

.‘इह युवतिवदनकान्तिभिराप्यायिततुन्दपरिमृजः शेते ।’ अनर्घराघवे7-110

He wants प्रयोग for तुन्दपरिमार्जः.
