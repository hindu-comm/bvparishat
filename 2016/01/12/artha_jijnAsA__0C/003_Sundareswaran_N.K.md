While explaining the Amarakosha passage

पराचित परिस्कन्द परजात परैधिताः।

मन्दस्तुन्दपरिमृज आलस्यः शीतकोलसोनुष्णः। ।

the Malayalam commentator, T. C. Parameshwara Moossad, states that all the six words in the second half (of the verse) mean a lazy person. He quotes the sutraतुन्दशोकयोः परिमृजापनुदोः and thus shows the derivation of the wordतुन्दपरिमृज. And then adds thatतुन्दपरिमार्जः is an alternate reading. He does not mention about the difference in meaning ( lazy person and the person who caresses his belly), as is shown by Dr. Bhatt.
