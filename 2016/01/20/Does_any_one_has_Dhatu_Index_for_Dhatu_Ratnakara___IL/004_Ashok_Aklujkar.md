There is an alphabetical index of roots of the PāṇinIya Dhātu-pāṭha on pp.331-359 of \_Word Index to Pāṇini-sūtra-pāṭha and Pariśiṣṭas\_ by S. Chitrao and S. Pāṭhak, published by the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute in 1935.

Otto Böhtlingk’s 1887 Pāṇini’s Grammatik, an edition that still remains unsurpassed, also has an “Alphabetisches Verzeichniss der Wurzeln” on pp. \*84-94\*- As I recall, one of the volumes of S.M. Katre’s \_Aṣṭādhyāyī of Pāṇini\_ (Poona; Deccan College) also has such an index in Roman/Latin script.

  

I cannot check if the Dhatu-ratnākara follows the order of the PāṇinIya Dhātu-pāṭha but I would expect it to (at least to a large extent).
