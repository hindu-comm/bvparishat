Dear list members

  

A former classmate of mine is looking for English books to help her get a better understanding of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. She does not want to read original text or translations, does not know Sanskrit and is not comfortable reading in Hindi or other Indian languages. She is especially looking for books which elaborate on righteousness of the characters and treatment of women in the two epics (she is more curious than judgemental/feminist).

  

There are a lot of easy-to-find English books (e.g. works of Doniger or Devdutt Pattanaik) which give a narrow, biased, or even mistaken perspective on these matters. What might help here would be the traditional perspective in English, like what works like Dharmakutam and Ramayana Mimamsa of Svami Karpatri offer.

  

Any books the list can recommend? I know of Shatavadhani Ganesh Ji's *Human Values in Ramayana*, but no idea where to get it from.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
