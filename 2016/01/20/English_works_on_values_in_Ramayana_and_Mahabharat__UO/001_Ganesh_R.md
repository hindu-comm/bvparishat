Dear Mishra mahOdaya,

It is so kind of you to remember by small booklets. They are published by the Gandhi Center of Human Values, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan,
Bangalore center. Here original quotations from these two epics with simple English translation are given. These are specially meant for the beginners. Apart from these, many other titles on similar subjects authored by different scholars are also available. Special mention must be made about the book pack of ten titles dealing with various aspects of Sanskrit literature that includes the Vedas, Upanishads, arthashaastra, dharmashaastra, alamkaarashaastra, sixty four arts,
sciences etc. This is particularly meant for the youth.

Regards

Ganesh
