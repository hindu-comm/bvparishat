Hare Krishna.  

\>Special mention must be made about the book  
\> pack of ten titles dealing with various aspects of Sanskrit literature that  
\> includes the Vedas, Upanishads, arthashaastra, dharmashaastra,  
\> alamkaarashaastra, sixty four arts, sciences etc. This is particularly  
\> meant for the youth.  
  

I am interested in this pack of ten booklets. But need to know it is  
authored by whom and where it is available.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
