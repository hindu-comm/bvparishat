Respected Sir

I have recently received the charge of a newly created Centre at BHU named Bharat Adhyayan Kendra estd by the ministry of HRD to intensely support and promote interdisciplinary research in Indic studies.

I would like to invite you to deliver lectures on the prospects of Sanskrit study and researches all around the world or any subject of your interest in the next month preferably or any date suitable to you. The Centre will bear all the expenses on your visit to India to and fro. Hope you will spare some time for Sanskrit teachers and students of the Univ and also entire Kashi to be benefitted with your experience and knowledge.!

We would like your valuable advice to decide future Sanskrit research policy of the Centre for the promotion of interdisciplinary researches for exploring elements of modern branches of studies.

With best regards and pranampoorvak.

Yours sishya

Sadashiv
