Professor Korada,  

 I am a novice in Sanskrit, but based on your explanation, let me venture to say something and please tell if what I am saying is correct.  
  

When two nouns join together to form a समास then one acts as a noun and the other as an adjectival. (The word adjectival is used in Western linguistics to denote those words which independently are not adjectives as parts of speech, but act as an adjective in a particular context). Thus शिशिरमधुरम् and मधुरशिशिरम् are two ways of joining two nouns, and depending upon their arrangement, the first one becomes the adjectival while the second remains a noun, or nominal as it is sometimes called.  

In English since compounding is not common, unlike Sanskrit, it would be difficult to find examples, but let me make up one. Both 'flood' and 'money' are nouns. These can be joined to form two compound words: flood-money and money-flood. In the first one 'flood' becomes an adjectival and gives the meaning 'money that was collected for flood victims". In the second 'money' becomes the adjectival and gives the meaning 'a flood of money'.  

In Sanskrit, the indication that the second word remains a noun and the first does not remain a noun is that the second word undergoes विभक्ति declensions while the first one cannot be declined as per the विभक्ति. Thus, you can say पाचकपाठकम् पश्यमि. पाचकपाठकेण सह गच्छामि
