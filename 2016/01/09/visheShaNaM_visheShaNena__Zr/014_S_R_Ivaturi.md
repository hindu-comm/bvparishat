Prof. Korada has explained well the position with the compounds queried by Sri Chandrakant Kulkarni. I would like to add some points to make it more clear.

The question is in शिशिरमधुरम् how can विशेषणं विशेष्येन be applied when both are adjectives for जलम्?

The answer is:

We must understand that any compound has two characteristics. 1. The structure 2. The dissolution to get at the meaning which is called the Vigrahavakya. Both are governed by grammatical rules. But both are different.

For framing or forming a compound we need to look into the aspects such as capability (समर्थत्व), order of the words (उपसर्जनत्व), losing or not of the vibhakti etc. Thus the sutra विशेषणं विशेष्येन requires a qualifier and the qualified. But when both are the qualifiers, what to do? Simply consider one of them as the qualified. Then the qualifier becomes the upasarjana, and becomes the first member of the compound. So in a compound such as शिशिरमधुरम्, the words can change their positions and thus we have the form मधुरशिशिरम् also. This technicality doesn’t take into consideration the meaning of the compound, where both the words are but qualifiers of जलम्। Hence Prof. Korada says that you can’t bring the third word to force a meaning. *Because the construction of a samasa is not based on the meaning of the words, but the status of the words only.*

The second characteristic of the compound is its meaning. And it always depends on the context, except in case of some compounds such as the avyayibhava, tatpursha/karmadharaya (some), or the dvandva (some). The bahuvrihi is always dependent on the third member. This is particularly true if compound is used as a qualifier to another noun. For example, take the case of a compound like वीरपुरुषः which can be विशेषणपूर्वपदकर्मधारय (वीरश्चासौ पुरुषः) if it is a stand-alone compound, or बहुव्रीहिः (वीराः पुरुषाः यस्मिन् सः ग्रामः/देशः) when it is a network compound. (Sorry for the use of computer jargon, but I feel it makes the point clear). In the second case it depends on the qualified noun for getting the plural.

Thus the meaning of शिशिरमधुरम् is cool and sweet (water). But how it is formed is explained by the scholars here.
