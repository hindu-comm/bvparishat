Dear Sahaji,  
  
This is the most relevant point you raised. As the subject of Immortality is paramarthika and belongs to the domain of spirituality, it could be that the views of censuring the Immortality of Self from the Vyavaharika standpoint or the domain of transiency, are being criticised from the same standpoint. May be the author of the new book will be able to enlighten the uninitiated, more on this.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
