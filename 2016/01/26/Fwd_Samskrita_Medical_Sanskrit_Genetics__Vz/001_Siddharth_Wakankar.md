It is a very praiseworthy,but,a very daunting task. I do feel that young scholars of Sanskrit should try their hands at this commendable endeavour. In course of time,this will prove to be very productive and conducive to research in Sanskrit.

  

I wish success to this academic effort that aims to bring together the Sanskrit scholars and the Scientists for a collaborative activity.
