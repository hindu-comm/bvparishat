Dear scholars

I agree to the discussion above. Prof. amba, and Ramanujan are great contributors to Sanskrit and allied studies. Dr. Prasad (HCU) started a great work. I observed the translations of medical terms above. Scholars with a common aim may come together to build a team for this great cause. This is the right time to start some good and big project.

But in the process of making greek/Latin technical word into sanskrit, it (new word) should not be difficult and ambiguous. Very common words precisely may be brought into sanskrit as they are (in stead of making it very difficult to use).
