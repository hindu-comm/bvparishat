Namaste Sivasenaniji,  
  

In fct by citing the details of the king Ashoka, Mr. Sanjeev Sanyal is actually accepting the timeline given by the Marxist historians and that is why the Marxist historians do not want to oppose that and they are just ignoring what Sanyal says by just calling the issue as tricky. I guess, further disussion on this will not be permissible in this thread.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
