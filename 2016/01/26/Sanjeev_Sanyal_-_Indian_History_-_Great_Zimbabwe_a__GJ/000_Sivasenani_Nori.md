For a while, Sanjeev Sanyal, a much talented man of many facets has been writing on Indian History. He has three books to his credit. He recently spoke about "How Much of Indian History is Really True?". This is available at <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukq_8FeQTaA>

  

This is an interesting talk for many reasons and deserves to be heard and recommended. Let me share the highlights. There is a case study of Ashoka, where he deconstructs Ashoka's edicts, books on Ashoka and the current standard version of Ashoka "the Great" in Indian history books and shows howthe presentversion ofAshoka is nottrue. He argues that Conquerors' History has been adapted by India's leaders after independence, with modifications to suit their ideology and asks why we should not work towards an Indian version of Indian History. While this by itself might not be a novel question, at least in this group, the way he poses this question is veryengaging.He consciously distances himself from the Hindutva brigade, which is seen by manyas throwing wild accusations while making grand unsubstantiatedclaims for ancient India, andpresents himself as a mild, reasonable person whois merely curious.The way he defines the "Indian version" is designed to include Islam, Judaism and Christianity. For instance he talks about the mosque Arab traders built in Kerala while Prophet Mohammad was still alive and did not yet reach Mecca. He poses the question as to why this version of Islam, spread peacefully by traders and not by invading armies, is not talked about in History, as presented to school children and lay public in India. As I said his style is very engaging and is useful in spreading the scepticism about the current mainstream version. One reference from his talk would resonate in this forum.

  

Sanyal talks about Great Zimbabweandshows how politics colours and distortshistory, with a suggestion that something similar might have happened with reference to Aryan Invasion Theory. "Zimbabwe" in the local languageis the wordfor"ruins" or "stone houses". Later the country itself got so named (and sadly, it is prettyclose to ruins now, financially).There were many ruins, and the biggest one was named Great Zimbabwe. This was a great city with huge walls and indicated a thriving civilization, but different colonizers fed the natives different versions in which northerners came and built this city. Initially Biblical characters were the inspiration (Queen of Sheba, for one) and then Arabs and others were offered as the people who constructed this city; one thing was common, native black people were incapable of constructing such a great monument. Only after independence in 1980, did the truth emerge that it was indeed the native black people who built Great Zimbabwe and that a great civilization flourished for hundreds years from 900 AD in that site. Unlike in the case of AIT, there seem to exist material on record where rulers asked historians to revise the version.Anyhow, [here](https://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/GreatZimbabwe_TeachersNotes.pdf) is a version put up by British Museum, where the distortion isacknowledged in plain terms, by a respected Institution in the land of the Conqueror.A Zimbabwean version is available [here](http://www.manuampim.com/ZIMBABWE.html). Admittedly, compared toAIT,this is an extreme case: the issue is central (the country got its name from the issue), thedistortion is blatant, the evidence overwhelming and there is material on record showing political demands for distortion. Still the analogy seems toask "why can't Indians do what Zimbabweans did: correct their history?"
