Namaste,  
  

Patanjali is also a very ancient name. Bhagavata purana, Matsya purana, Brahmanda purana and Vayu purana mention this name. This pauranic Patanjali was the disciple of Kauthuma, one of the sons of Parashara. I understand that some people in Gonarda (Gonda) believe that Patanjali was the guru of Vedavyasa. This Patanjali might have composed the Yogasutra. If this is so, the grammarian Patanjali could have been another person.
