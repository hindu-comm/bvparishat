"पातंजलि" is used as common noun Baba Ramdev . He can keep a spelling of choice he need not adhere to any cannons of grammar or Sanskrit spellings. Sanskrit words should follow grammatical rules and one should be able to derive them. This rule may not be applicable for all proper nouns that we encounter.  

  

Was पातंजल in the display boards under question followed by another word such as योग or was it simply पातंजलि ?  
  

Baba Ramdev may have just yoga in mind and not necessarily



पतञ्जलि yoga . In my view its an independent word



पातंजलि. Any way the popular yoga schools teach asanas and pranayama as a physical exercises and don't adhere to पतञ्जलि yoga or his school of thought though they might derive inspiration from this ancient tradition.  
  

Talking about hilariously wrong spellings the subject line of this thread itself is "correct wor"
