Namaste

  

Thank you. One question. By reading the Sloka itappears first चित्तशुद्धि is important. Then वाक्छुद्धि.

Last शरीरशुद्धि. This is correct because if you have only pure Sanskritwords and pure body but impure thoughts

in mind what is the use? Mind has to be pure even if words and body are not. Some Bhakta says wrongly विष्णाय नमः

and a learned person विष्णवे नमः. If the mind is pure God will bless them both.
