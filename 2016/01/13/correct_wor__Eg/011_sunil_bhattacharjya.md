Namaste,  
  

Some people believe that Shri Goninda Bhagavadpada, the guru of Adi Shankaracharya, was an avatara of Patanjali, while there have been others to claim Shri Gaudapadacharya to be an avatara of Patanjali. It could be that all these personalities could have been from the Patanjali gotra or pravara. The Puranas give a hint on there being a Patanjali gotra / pravara. Dharmashastra permits naming of a child after an ancestor. If this is so, it could be that the Pauranic Patanjali composed the Yogasutra and his disciple Vedavyasa wrote the bhashya on it.  
  

I think there is an anecdote that something fell on the hands of a rishi while he was giving anjali (offering) and his name became Patanjali. The etymologists may please look into the origin of the name.  
  

Regards,
