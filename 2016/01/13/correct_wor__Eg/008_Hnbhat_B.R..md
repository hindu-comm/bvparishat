\> Patanjali is also a very ancient name. Bhagavata purana, Matsya purana, Brahmanda purana and Vayu purana mention this name. This pauranic Patanjali was the disciple of Kauthuma, one of the sons of Parashara. I understand that some people in Gonarda (Gonda) believe that Patanjali was the guru of Vedavyasa. This Patanjali might have composed the Yogasutra. If this is so, the grammarian Patanjali could have been another person.

The question of identity was discussed long ago in our group.

The question in this thread raised whether पतञ्जलि is correct or पातंजलि is correct.  

\>Scholars may kindly clarify which is correct .. patanjali or paatanjali

\>पतंजलि  or  पातंजलि because on the display boards of Ramdev Baba
