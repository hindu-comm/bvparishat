**Patañjali**is a proper Indian name. Several important Sanskrit works are ascribed to one or more authors of this name, and a great deal of scholarship has been devoted over the last century or so to the issue of disambiguation.^([\[1\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patanjali#cite_note-NCC-1))

Amongst the more important authors called Patañjali are:^([\[2\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patanjali#cite_note-2)[\[3\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patanjali#cite_note-3)[\[4\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patanjali#cite_note-gavin-4))

-   The author of
    the*[Mahābhāṣya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mah%C4%81bh%C4%81%E1%B9%A3ya "Mahābhāṣya")*,
    an advanced treatise on Sanskrit grammar and linguistics framed as a
    commentary
    on[Kātyāyana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C4%81ty%C4%81yana "Kātyāyana")'s*vārttika*s
    (short comments)
    on[Pāṇini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini "Pāṇini")'s*[Aṣṭādhyāyī](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini#Ashtadhyayi "Pāṇini")*.
    This Patañjali's life is the only one which can be securely dated
    (as one of the grammatical examples he uses makes reference to the
    siege of the town of Sāketā by the Greeks, an event known from other
    sources to have taken place around 120 BC). -   The compiler of the[Yoga
    Sūtras](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga_Sutras_of_Patanjali "Yoga Sutras of Patanjali"),
    an important collection of aphorisms
    on[Yoga](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga "Yoga")practice,^([\[5\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patanjali#cite_note-5))who
    according to some historians was a notable person
    of[Samkhya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samkhya "Samkhya"),^([\[6\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patanjali#cite_note-6)[\[7\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patanjali#cite_note-phillips-7))contemporaneous
    with Ishvarakrishna's Samkhya-karika around AD
    400^([\[7\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patanjali#cite_note-phillips-7))He
    was native to Kashmir. -   Patanjali is one of the 18 siddhars in the
    Tamil[siddha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddha "Siddha")([Shaiva](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaiva "Shaiva"))
    tradition. -   The author of an unspecified work of medicine
    (*āyurveda*).^([\[8\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patanjali#cite_note-HIML-8))

In some Sanskrit grammatical works, Patañjali is called "the man from Gonarda". Gonarda is the ancient name of Gonda - a district of Uttar Pradesh, about 50 km north of Ayodhya. Greek chronicles mention about Paatanjali, when they laid their siege on Saket i.e. Ayodhya in 2nd century BC. This implies that Paatanjali most probably was from Gonda, a district of immense importance where Buddha and Mahaavira resided. In fact Shravasti, just off Gonda, further to north, was a center of power during that millennium and was the capital of the said Janapad. Beside, this was an area of traditional Sanskrit learning. Some hold the view that he was born at the "[Gonarda](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koneswaram_temple "Koneswaram temple")" situated at[Thiru Kona Malai](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trincomalee "Trincomalee"), Sri Lanka. This tradition is corroborated in[Tirumular](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirumular "Tirumular")'s seventh-century Tamil*[Tirumandhiram](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirumandhiram "Tirumandhiram")*, which describes him as hailing from*[Then Kailasam](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koneswaram_temple "Koneswaram temple")*([Koneswaram temple, Trincomalee](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koneswaram_temple "Koneswaram temple")), and tradition has him visiting the[Thillai Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thillai_Nataraja_Temple,_Chidambaram "Thillai Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram"), where he wrote the*Charana Shrungarahita Stotram*on[Nataraja](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nataraja "Nataraja").
