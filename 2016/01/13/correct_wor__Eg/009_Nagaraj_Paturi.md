\>पातंजलि because on the display boards of Ramdev Babaपातंजलि is written



Many display boards have hilariously wrong spellings. This could be one of those.



Was पातंजल in the display boards under question followed by another word such as योग or was it simply पातंजलि ?



If it is an independent word पातंजलि, then it isthe caseof महापांडित्यम् of the display board maker.
