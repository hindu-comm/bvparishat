Namaste

  

Patanjali is Adi Sesha according to some legends.

  

<http://artoflivingsblog.com/maharishi-patanjali/>

  

In this blog there is English translation of a Sloka -

“I bow with my hands together, to the eminent Patanjali, who removed the impurities of the mind through Yoga, of speech through Grammar, and of the body through medicine” (Translation of the verse from Bhoja Rajamaarttaanda Commentary on the Yoga Sutras).

  

I like to see the Sanskrit Sloka from the original if someone knows it.
