नमस्ते ।  
  
I think Shankarji is correct when he says: "Gita Press edition claims to preserve the original reading, Mool Paatha. Therefore any wrong word be accepted as Aarsha word."  
  
Except, in the end there should be a yardstick to judge if the grammar in question, ArSha or Paniniyan, is correct or not.  
  
In that sense I would eventually disagree with hnbhat ji's statement: "Sanskrit can have such usages, of the verb ब्राह्मणं कुशलं पृच्छेत्, माणवकं धर्मं पृच्छेत् etc. are cases of double object, द्विकर्मक. जनकः रामं सीतां पृच्छति will be the normal sentence."  
  
instead I can think of ब्राह्मणं कुशल पृच्छेत् as more "correct" form, where कुशल is in vocative, not accusative. Similarly, जनकः रामं सीते पृच्छति, and so on.  
  
So, in:  
hyaami dharmaj\~nam raajaanam satya vaadinam \|  
janakam pR^iSTa siitam tam kushalam jana sa.nsadi \|\| 4-1-106  
  
--janakam is in accusative, but pRiSTa is in vocative, whereas "siitam tam kushalam jana sa.nsadi" is a phrase qualifying janakam (tam assuming the role of avyaya).  
  
In this way, I think this formation is indeed Arsha, and should be understood accordingly.
