नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

If there is उद्भूतावयवभेद - if you have a विवक्षा to refer to the अवयवs (mountains) then it is mountains - Himalayas .

  

Rather if you want to refer to a single range it is Himalaya.

  

  

तिरुमल (Tamil - तिरु मलै = श्रीपर्वतः) is referred to as सप्तपर्वताः / seven hills and also as तिरुमलकोण्ड (Telugu) - Tirumala hill.

  

This is discussed in शास्त्रs - वृक्षाः / वनम् etc. There is difference in terms of wording though.

  

धन्यो’स्मि
