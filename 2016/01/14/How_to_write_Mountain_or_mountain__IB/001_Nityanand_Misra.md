Specific to this case, Himalaya is a mountain range and not a single mountain. So the plural should be used without the capitalization.

  

In general, capitalization in such cases depends to some extent on the style guide you follow. You may want to refer a style manual. Please find attached the section on Topographical Divisions (8.52) in the Chicago Manual of Style (16th edition).
