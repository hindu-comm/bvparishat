In response to Murthyji's response, the question is about the usage of the Himalaya in the western language of the western people and any reference to the usage in the earliest Geographical Accounts by the wester Georaphists would settle the question and not by the standards of Kalidasa in Sanskrit language and not by the use by the Indian writers in Indian English. One can refer to any such uage by RK Narayan, Ravindranatha Tagore or Sarojni Naidu.

The quoted passage itself suggests Himalaya, king of a range of mountains. नगाधिराजः if taken literally, the geographical position. It is Sanskrit language and poetic language. ProfKorda ha suggested the possibility of plurality like वृक्षाः, and वनम् in Sanskrit language itself.
