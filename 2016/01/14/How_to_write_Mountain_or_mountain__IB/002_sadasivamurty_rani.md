1\. Mountain is mountain only (should be written without capital letter in its beginning) since it is a common noun except when it is written at the beginning of a sentence.

2\. As stated by Sri Nityananda Misra Ji Himalaya is "range of mountains" only. So on all general occasions it should be used as range of mountains only.

3\. But in specific contexts its singular form also is often used:

"हिमालयो नाम नगाधिराज:"

महेन्द्रो मलयस्सह्यो देवतात्मा हिमालय:।

ध्येयो रैवतको विन्ध्यो गिरिश्चारावलिस्तथा॥ etc.

In such instances using Himalaya mountain (in singular and with out capital beginning of mountain) is not wrong.

These three are acceptable.

4\. The fourth one Himalaya Mountain is due to the eagerness of the writer to draw the attention of his readers.

Regards,

**Prof. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
