When we refer to all the mountains together, we call it The Himalayas.  
  

If you refer to a particular mountain, you may refer to it as a mountain, such as the Kanchanjunga mountain.  
  

Since all the mountains in Himalayas are taken as a range of mountains, one generally talks of the Himalayan Range.  
  

Himalaya is never used in singular. You may talk of Himalayan heights, but then Himalayan is an adjective and not a noun.
