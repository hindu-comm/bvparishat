Dear Dash ji,  
  

The word कालीन is grammatically incorrect. In Ashtadhyayi there is a sutra कालाट्ठञ् 4.3.11 which says that the suffix ठञ् is added to the stems related to काल and the stem काल itself in the sense of sesha(शैषिक). काल + ठञ् -> कालिक. Similarly पूर्वकालिक and उत्तरकालिक. Although the word कालीन is grammatically incorrect but mostly it occurs in Nyaya texts.

  

With regards,  

Pavankumar
