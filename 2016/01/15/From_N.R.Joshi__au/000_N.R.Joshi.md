Reapected Scholars, Namaskar!



YayAti and Sharmis'tha had a son named Puru. Apte dictionary gives spelling Puru while Shrikant Talgeri in his book on Rigvedaused the spelling PUru (i.e.Pooru). Which one is correct.?

Were there two Purus with different spellings in the ancient India? Please help. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
