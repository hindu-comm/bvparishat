For a translation of the inscription of 860 A.D. from Nalanda describing establishment of a Buddhist monastery/academy, see:

"The **Nalanda inscription** is an inscription located in [Nalanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nalanda "Nalanda"), [Bihar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar "Bihar"), [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India"), and has been dated to 860 CE. The inscription talks about king Devapaladeva of [Bengala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pala_Empire "Pala Empire") who had granted the request of Sri Maharaja of Suvarnadvipa, [Balaputra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balaputra "Balaputra"), to build a Buddhist monastery at Nalanda."
