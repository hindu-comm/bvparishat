Taxila or Nalanda were more of Buddhist Viharas at least when buddhism was at its peak in these centers of learning than brahmanical Asramas. Hindu subjects, may be even the vedas were thought. There is a theory even Mahavira was a student of Taxila. Can they be called asramas is my doubt. As has been already pointed out by Prof Deshpande "Most of our knowledge comes from either the descriptions by Chinese visitors like Hsuan Tsiang or from accounts of their destruction in Persian" we need to look into these books as we don't have contemporary inscriptions. I agree with definition of asrama or what an asrama is as given by scholars.
