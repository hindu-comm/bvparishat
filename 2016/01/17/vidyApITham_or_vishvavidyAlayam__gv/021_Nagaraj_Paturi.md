Dear Sriram,



Thanks formentioning the inscriptions mentioning ghaṭikāsthānaswhich is an important word in the context of ancient Indian institutes of higher learning.



The word was mentioned by Prof. Dipak Bhattacharya as part of this thread.



Your claim thatghaṭikā was the ancient name for agrahāras needs more substantiation.



The article shared by Prof. Deshpande,in line with its pūrvapakṣa by Prof. Romilla Thapar putsāśrama and agrahāra side by side.



Focus of that article wasneitherāśramas nor agrahāras as institutes of higher learning. In fact, anāśrama as found described in Sanskrit literature is not just an institute of higher learning. Butmanyāśramaswerenevertheless institutes of higher learning while playing many other functions not limited to higher learning. Some of the āśramas as per the descriptions were nānāśāstrasthānas too, akin to what are called as universities today.



agrahāras too had svādhyāya , śāstra adhyayana adhyāpana as part of their functions. This is one of the similarities between agrahāras and āśramas.



There are a huge number of dissimilarities toobetween agrahāras and āśramas. I was trying to point to one of such dissimilarities. There are descriptions of princes staying ināśramas to studywith a rishi. Your mention of Mayuravarma's study at Kanchipuram could be similar. Was Kanchipuram an exclusive Brahmin settlement? But I do not remember the description ofa prince staying in an agrahāra for study.



Leaving this issue aside, I was wondering in which kind of settlementswere the rishis who worked as the mediums for the Vedas lived? Irrespective of whether the wordāśramafinds mention in the Vedas and the Upanishads or not, were not the dwellings of who worked as the mediums for the Vedas and handed them down to the lineage of those who orally perpetuated them,āśramas? If not, what kind of settlements were they?
