The central part of the article shared by Prof. Deshpande is the following:

  

Seen in this way, it is at least possible that the references to agrahāras which we find mentioned primarily in inscriptions, and those to āśramas which are so frequent in classical Sanskrit literature, concern one and the same historical institution, or better perhaps: two different institutions with considerable overlap. Agrahāras were donated to Brahmins because their donors expected their occupants to live more or less in accordance with life as it was presumably lived in āśramas, and Brahmins depicted āśramas in this particular manner at least in part in order to entice their rulers to create such settlements, or more of them.

  

All this is, for the time being, just a hypothesis which has to be tested.

  

Was there an agrahāra to which a king's son was sent for studies?

  

There are many other such questions that are relevant to the present thread and that can help testing the hypothesis of the author.
