To my knowledge, no Sanskrit documents describing the monasteries/academies in Taxila or Nalanda survive. Most of our knowledge comes from either the descriptions by Chinese visitors like Hsuan Tsiang or from accounts of their destruction in Persian. Often the Chinese visitors used Chinese approximations of Sanskrit or Prakrit local names, and someone who can read the original Chinese accounts can try to figure out what these approximations may be. Watters in his notes on his translation of Hsuan Tsiang's travel account of India tries to give Sanskrit/Prakrit equivalents. I don't have the book at hand, but one can find it in a library in India. From my reading of this translation many years ago, I do not recall any word similar to Vidyāpīṭha or Viśvavidyālaya. These institutions were first and foremost Buddhist monasteries/academies, that also included many non-Buddhist subjects. This much is clear from the descriptions by the Chinese visitors.
