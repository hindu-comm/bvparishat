In Thomas Watters' "On Yuan Chwang's Travels in India", Vol 2, p. 171, we find the term Nālandā Saṅghārāma describing the monastery / academy at Nālandā, and Yuan Chwang's description of the place indicates it as a mainly Buddhist academy. All the scholars he associates with this place are Buddhist teachers.
