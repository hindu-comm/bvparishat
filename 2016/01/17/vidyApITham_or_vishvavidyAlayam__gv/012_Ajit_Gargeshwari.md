Thanks for pointing to Nalanda Copper Plate inscription.This clearly shows by 9 Century at least Nalanda was primarily a Buddhist Vihara and not a Brahmanic Asrama. May be secular subjects and Sanskrit were thought at Nalanda during 9 Century. Taxasila was an ancient Brahmanic seat of learning as Panini himself is said to have from this academy, later when Buddhism was at its peak the focus of this academy was Buddhism.  
Hasmukh Sankalia in his book University of Nalanda has argued that Nalanda was a University but even he has not said that it was a Asrama
