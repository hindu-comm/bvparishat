It is not clear what Dr Bhat wanted to communicate. The mark '>' is usually put in front of the words of the other person to which the user of '>' wants to respond.

  

But Dr Bhat's post begins as

  

\> None of the Sanskrit words suggested अग्रहारः, घटिका (=synonym of अग्रहार?) suggest the meaning of u·ni·ver·si·ty (yo͞o′nə-vûr′sĭ-tē)  
\> n. pl. u·ni·ver·si·ties  
\> 1. An institution for higher learning with teaching and research facilities typically including a graduate school and professional schools that award master's degrees and doctorates and an undergraduate division that awards bachelor's degrees.  

  

This gives the impression that someone previously in this thread posted
these three passages.

  

But I did not find anyone posting these passages.

  

I guess these are the passages posted by Dr Bhat himself presumably in response to all the previous responses to the thread initiating post.

  

Later part of his post totally confusing :

  

"The first is found in वाचस्पत्य, and it gives as a grain storage for use for the students."

  

----- Which (word) is being discussed here? Probably 'it gives as a grain storage for use for the students' means 'वाचस्पत्यgives the meaning of some word asa grain storage for use for the students'.

  

This is followed by some

  

३ स्वकर्म ब्राह्मणस्याध्ययनमध्यापनम्यज्ञो याजनं दानं प्रतिग्रहणं दायाद्यं शिलोञ्छः\|

४ अन्यच्चापरिगृहीतम् ५ एतान्येव क्षत्रियस्याध्यापनयाजनप्रतिग्रहणानीति परिहाप्य दण्डयुद्धाधिकानि ६ क्षत्रियवद्वैश्यस्य दण्डयुद्धवर्जं कृषिगोरक्ष्यवाणिज्याधिकम्

Probably this is a supporting quote for the passage that occurs later to these 3, 4, 5 and 6 (the numbering is unintelligible):

आपस्तम्ब prescribes अध्यापन, as one of the षट्कर्म of ब्राह्मण. Modern scholars claiming ब्राह्मण by गुणकर्मविभाग, may question this division. In other words, those of Teaching profession, would be called ब्राह्मण, like Professors in University. According to Apastamba, the others are not entitled to teaching profession अध्यापन and exclusively ब्राह्मण-s.  

Concluding line seems to be

विश्वविद्यालय is anyhow accepted as the modern equivalent of University and there is no equal word in Sanskrit.
