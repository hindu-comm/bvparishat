Dear Nagaraj Garu,

  

Kanchi Paramacharya used to give discourses on the ancient guru tradition of India which was recorded and published in the form "The Voice of Guru - The Guru Tradition" which was published by Bharatiya Vidva Bhavan. 

  

In one of His discourses, Swamiji mentions that the oldest name to vedic school wasघटिका andकाञ्चिपुरं one of the oldestघटिकास्थानं. His Holiness mentions that there is an inscription on one of the pillars of Sri Pranaveshwaraswami Temple in Talagunta in Shimoga District. This inscription was printed in Epigraphica Indica Vol.III.

  

It says that the मयूरवर्मा, a king, travelled all the way from Shimoga to Kanchipuram to studyशास्त्र underवीरशर्मा. The inscription says "घटिकां विवेश".

  

Yet, in another inscription vide Volume II (Part V), the King Skandasisya won aघटिका after defeating a King Satyasena vide the inscription (स्कन्दशिष्यस्ततो अभवत् द्विजानाम् घटिकां राज्ञः सत्यसेनात् जहार यः). The "द्विजानाम् घटिकां" needs our special attention here which was the ancient name for "अग्रहारं".

  

regards,

Sriram
