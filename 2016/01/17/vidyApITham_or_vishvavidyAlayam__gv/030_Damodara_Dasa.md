Hare Krishna.  
Respected vidvaj-janas,  
  
As far as I understand, a gurukula is a place where children from age  
about 7 to 15 years study and is usually called asrama or gurukula.  
Here the basic traning into sadacara, one's own branch of veda,  
sanskrit, ritualistic activities or samskaras, and philosophy are  
given.  
  
Then there are seats of learning for specialization in particular  
fields where a student may opt to go or is sent by guru or father to  
master a particular field and study there under adhyapaka(s). These  
can be called differently from gurukula or asrama.  
  
Usually asrama is the word (when used in context to residence place)  
used for hermitages of sages or rsis living in forests. The word  
gurukula means the home of the guru or the dynasty of guru. Thus if  
the "university" happens to be at the home of the chief guru then it  
can be called gurukula. Siimilarly if the university happens to be at  
the home of chief guru living in forest (typically known as asrama)  
then the university can be called asrama. But if it happens to be  
neither and is established as a separate entity either by king or a  
group of brahmanas forming an institution then it may be called  
differently.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
