नमो नमः।

Presently we find two different words used in Sanskrit in the sense of University. But which was the word used in ancient times? Was it विद्यापीठम्‌ or विश्वविद्यालयम्‌ or any other word? Which was the word used in connection with तक्षशीला, नालन्दा etc.

Or is the word “विश्वविद्यालयम्‌” just a direct translation of the English word “University”?
