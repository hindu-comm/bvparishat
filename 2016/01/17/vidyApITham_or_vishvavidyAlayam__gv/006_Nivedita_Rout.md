A"srama is the suitable word as Prof. Rani Sadasivam Murthy pointed out here. A good reference on this notion may be found in one of the 9th century's Cambodian inscriptions (The Prasat Komnap stele inscription of Ya"sovwarman (dt. 889c.A.D.), vv. 52-62). These verses speak of a royal ordinance of king Ya"sovarman to a Vai.s.nava A"saram (which was established by him) about the duty of Vai.s.nava Acaaryas, Adhyaapakas and Kulapati of the A"srama. It indicates that certainly this educational system of Cambodia was transmitted from India. We also very well know that all our great epics refer to A"srama/gurukula as the centre of education.
