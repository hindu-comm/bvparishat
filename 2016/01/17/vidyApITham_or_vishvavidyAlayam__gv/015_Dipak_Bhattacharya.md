Professor Deshpande correctly pointed to some exclusive sources of our knowledge of ancient education centres. I hope the addition of the following pieces of information will not be superflouous. Ghaṇṭikāsthānas have been mentioned by Amalānanda (Vedāntakalpataru BS 3.4.20) where the AV was recited. Appayyadīkṣita clarifies that those were holy places. Veda recitation allows one to infer training of the same. The word *āśrama* is not used. But the mention of grant for the maintenance ofteachers and students of the Vedas is found.
