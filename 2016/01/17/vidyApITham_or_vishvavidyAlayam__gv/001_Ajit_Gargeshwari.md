If we say that modern concept of a University did exists in Nalanda or Taxasila then we can call it a University. There was no pitha or permanent Chair named after a founder hence calling it a Vidya Pitha may not fit into the technical usage of the word. Probably Vidyalaya or 'center of learning' Some cities became renowned because of their teachers. Chief among them were Varanasi, Taxila from the day of Buddha and Kanchi in the beginning of the Christian era. Varanasi was famous for its religious teachers. Taxila was known for its secular studies.I don't know what they used to call themselves from inscriptions. In all probability a conglomeration of teachers who could teach having residential facilities . University Of Nalanda by Hasmukh Sankalia D. available at DLI is good book on the subject
