"Which was the word used in connection with तक्षशीला, नालन्दा etc." is only one part of the original thread intiating post.



Thus the thread's focus is not just Taxasila and Nalanda alone.



The focus is the question



"in Sanskrit in the sense of University.. which was the word used in ancient times? Was it विद्यापीठम्‌ or विश्वविद्यालयम्‌ or any other word?"





There is a sub-question "Or is the word “विश्वविद्यालयम्‌” just a direct translation of the English word “University”?"



To the sub-question , the answer is a clear "yes". The word “विश्वविद्यालयम्‌” just a direct translation of the English word “University".



Were there universities or entities comparable to universities in ancient India? If there were, what were they called?



To this question, the answer is "Yes, there wereentities in ancient India that were comparable to present day universities. Taxasila and Nalanda were part of but not all of those. "



Sanskrit literature has description of places comparable to universities. In some of that literature theywerereferred to useāśramas.



Talking of the present day terminology in connection with universities andits connection with the ancient Sanskrit terms, kulapati being used today has past usages. The pūrvapada kula in this samāsa may be connected to the uttarapada in the word gurukula.



Kanchipuram, Varanasi and many other well known vidysthanas deserve mention in this context.



In Vakyapadiyam, there is this verse:



पर्वताद् आगमं लब्ध्वा भाष्यबीजानुसारिभिः /

स नीतॊ बहुशाखत्वं चान्द्राचार्यादिभिः पुनः // वाक्य\_२।४८६ //

पर्वतात् here is interpreted as त्रिलिंगपर्वतैकदेशश्रीपर्वतात्

This parvata is another such place that could have been a university-like vidyāsthāna.

There could be a few more such places.
