Namaste

  

I agree we must have open mind to consider both AIT and OIT or even a third theory. In Vedas we hear

कृण्वन्तो विश्वमार्यम् . This is not a slogan but we have to consider what if the entire Jambu Dveepa was filled

with Aryan civilization. There are two observations made -

There was only one super continent Pangea. There was one Aryan religion.

Hindu artifacts are found in America

  

Look at recent history. Aryan religion influence has been contracting. In ancient times we already know Pakistan, Afghanistan and other countries

were following Aryan religion. Now Aryan religion influence has contracted to only India.

  

Therefore we can consider Aryan Contraction Theory ACT. In very ancient times it was covering entire world. It contracted and contracted and now it is

only in India. Even in India in recent history Kashmir has converted to Yavana religion. And Northeast to Christianity. But we can also see some reversals. Many temples are built again in America, UK and other places. It is expanding. In future again we may have Aryan religion every where on the planet.

  

Drawback of AIT is itis sayingAryan religion was not existing earlier in India but brought in. Drawback of OIT is it is sayingAryan religion was existing only in India but not other parts of the world.

  

Sorry if this is not a scientific approach but both AIT and OIT have problems.
