Dear Friends,

  

Dr.Bhat's remark is very apt! Both AIT and OIT arouse passions and emotions, which as pointed out previously by several members,has to be kept under check.

  

My intention in posting the link to S.Kak's article was two fold. First, one has to define AIT and/or its opposite OIT. Second, a historical time line, within the context of Indian Civilization/culture has to be proposed for AIT or OIT for any meaningful debate. Just talking of immigrants, and population movement 30000-40000 years ago leads us no where. Like any other science, Genetics has also errors due to measurements, sample size and variable significance levels in hypothesis testing.

Now coming to specifics: BVP and scholars must be interested in this for the reason AIT is very much dependent on Sanskrit. As far as I have understood (pl correct me) AIT is about Sanskrit speaking people coming from outside (M.Wheeler's Invasion has given place to Immigration) the subcontinent into India circa 1200 BC. \[If some one claims they came into India say in 5000 BC it is not AIT!\]. Subhas Kak in his article seems to propose OIT might have happened c 3300 BC, which (to me) appears plausible. Neither of the theories are provable in the sense of a mathematical theorem. We can only advance our hypotheses and present verification of the same, which may get overturned by others; bringing forth newer hypotheses. As of now proponents of AIT are in majority and also have large number of verifiable arguments. But these are all sufficiency arguments, not necessarily be acceptable as uniquely so. Even if Sanskrit speaking people were to have gone out of India, the colour and hue of spread of IE might have been similar. But no one has argued for or against this case logically so far. Since AIT is intimately connected with Max Mueller and he was not aware of Indus-Sarasvati civilization, a new issue for both the sides is to harmonize their theories with the new archaeological findings. This is easier for the AIT-wallas, simply because they started their journey 150 years back. OIT-wallas can not ask for a handicap! They have to work hard and catch up fast. Whatever be the truth, it is the history and culture of Bharat that is of interest to BVP. My appeal to those who stand by indigenous roots of Sanskrit is to investigate in a scholarly fashion, the relation (+ve or -ve) between Vedic/Puranic texts and the Indus-Sarasvati Valley sites. The first is textual, culturally internalized as tradition; the latter is strictly physical, geographical, artifact based and visible.

Thanks

  

RN Iyengar
