As you requested me to comment on this, here are my quick comments. In the scentific world, the most widely accepted theory regarding origins of modern humans is the Out of Africa theory. There is also the multiregional theory, but that also eventually traces the origin of Homo erectus to Africa. There may be beliefs that the humans manifested on Himalayas. For example, Jaishankar Prasad's epic Kamayani starts with the famous rhythmic lines on Manu, the first human, sitting atop a Himalayan peak:

हिमगिरि के उत्तुंग शिखर पर बैठ शिला की शीतल छाँह

एक पुरुष भीगे नयनों से देख रहा था प्रलय प्रवाह।

But science does not subscribe to this belief.  

  

Even though not all scientists are atheists, there exist countries where scientists are more likely to be religious than others, and not all scientists think religion and science are in conflict (see here: <http://news.rice.edu/2015/12/03/84282/>); it is better not to mix theories of origins of humans in scientific world and religious/literary world.

  

  

Human body manifested first
