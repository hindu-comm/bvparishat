Dear friends,  
  
There have been more and more work on this. Later stidies tell us that Ötzi, the 5300 years old iceman belonged to the haplogroup G, the sub category G-L9, Scientist explained adding that haplogroup G suggests that earlier people migrated to the Ötztal valley from Fließm -- a municipality in western Austria founded in the sixth century. Scientists performed DNA tests on ‘Ötzi the Iceman’ and and could positively identify 19 living male descendents in Austria, who have the same ancestry as Ötzi. This surprising discovery is yet to be revealed to those most closely affected by it. The 19 men have not yet been informed of the results and it is not known whether the researchers will do so. It is possible that the scientists would extend the study to other communities worldwide.
