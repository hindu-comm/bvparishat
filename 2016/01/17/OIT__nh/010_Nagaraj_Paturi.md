AIT did not remain just a matter of scholarly debates.

  

1\. British rule in India was justified on the basis of AIT.

  

2\. Political parties emerged on the basis of the 'race' interpretations of language classification theories of IE and Dravidian.

  

3\. Current political debates too are centered around this theory.
