Dear Prof. Paturi,  
  
I agree discussions should continue. Please continue  
  

This message" My modern friends are so much overwhelmed by the so called hypothesis of western historians based on imaginary and psychologically haunted grounds, so they can not digest anything against their thought, not even the proofs of Geological facts! Their mind & brain does not work beyond their own created boundaries....It is useless to argue with so close-minded ones....Hope they will be treated well sometimes by NASA investigations....Let NASA bless them!!"  
  

I feel the above post violates the established posting standards of decorum that all members on this mailing list adheres to. One cannot make allegation against any group or individuals however passionate one may feel about AIT unless one can back it established methods to express disagreement. Posting one liners trying to be over joyous without support for ones statement will not help any one not even scholars is my opinion. I am sure you or all our member would not like discussion and posting in this manner (The manner in which above posting is made).  

In my view, One should desist from branding all historians from the West or East. There are many great western scholars and many poor Indian scholars. One has to write about them and their writing in the normal established manner of writing. What has NASA got to do with AIT. Is not a good practice to drag in unconnected organization or individual into controversies on which they not linked or bothered about. NASA is not a member of BVP.  
Please note in this thread Dr. Bhat wrote when the same massage was posted twice and the second message of Dr. Bhat was on On भर्तृहरिः view on proposing hypothesis and defending the logical theories which is applicable to AIT or any other theory in general. Thanks
