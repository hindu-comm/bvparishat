It was just a coincidence that post followed the post with the NASA stuff. I did not expect or intend that to happen that way.



I agree with you in saying that the post was going totally on a tangent. Your moderator's note was timely.



My response was to the attempts at avoiding the discussion orsuch two sides are common; take it easy kind of approach. 



I was just trying to explain the reasons for why people get so intensely involved in this topic every time it comes up for discussion.



There was a pro-British Telugu poet who very clearly said in one of his poems (around 1910-15):



The English came yesterday



The Mohammedans a day before



You (Indians) too came a day before that



Don't unnecessarily react forgetting this fact.
