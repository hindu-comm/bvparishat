This article by Kak overplays the DNA of a stomach bacteria over the  
human DNA of the Iceman, and almost borders on being unscientific. The  
Europe's oldest natural human mummy, dating from 5,300 years ago, had  
his full genome sequenced and was found to belong to haplogroup  
G2a-L91 (G2a2a2, formerly known as G2a4), which is not at all present  
in India. The Y-DNA haplogroup G2a2a2 (L91), a relatively rare  
subclade, found nowadays in the Middle East, southern Europe  
(especially Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica) and North Africa. G2a2  
(PF3146) is otherwise found at low frequencies all the way from the  
Levant to Western Europe. In conclusion, Neolithic farmers in Europe  
would have belonged to G2a, G2a2 (+ subclades) and G2a3 (and at least  
the M406 subclade), and shows no significant ancestral connection to  
India.  
  
Here is the article on his human DNA results:

This list should be able to separate Science and Pseudo-Science, and  
avoid encouraging jingoistic pseudo-scientific proclamations, in  
keeping with the glorious Indian tradition of vivecana  
'discrimination'.
