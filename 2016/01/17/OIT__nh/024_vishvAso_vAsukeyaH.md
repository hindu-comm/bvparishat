मान्याः,  
  
Please find the H Pylore paper attached.  
  
Kindly note that shrI subhASh's inference: "In research published in the 8 January, 2016 issue of the*Science Magazine*, the EURAC authors announced that the Iceman’s stomach has ‘H. pylori’ that is of Indian origin (but now extinct) and not related to the hybrid variety of the modern European “admixture.” This means that Indians as migrants were present in Europe in 3300 BC." is a wild overstatement.  
  
Let me say this very clearly: The paper DOES NOT say that "Iceman’s stomach has ‘H. pylori’ that is of Indian origin (but now extinct)". Given what they've written in the paper, I would be surprised if the authors announced such a thing. Indeed, the authors only state: "The “Iceman” H. pylori is a nearly pure representative of the bacterial population of Asian origin that existed in Europe before hybridization. ... It has been suggested that AE1 originated in Central Asia, where it evolved into hpAsia2, which is commonly found in South Asia."  
  
Given the above, I think we may be falling (again) for the trap of speculating on things one has not even read.
