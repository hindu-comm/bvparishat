My modern friends are so much overwhelmed by the so called hypothesis of western historians based on imaginary and psychologically haunted grounds, so they can not digest anything against their thought, not even the proofs of Geological facts! Their mind & brain does not work beyond their own created boundaries....It is useless to argue with so close-minded ones....Hope they will be treated well sometimes by NASA investigations....Let NASA bless them!!
