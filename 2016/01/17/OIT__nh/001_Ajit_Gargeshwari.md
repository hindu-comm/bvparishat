"Much of Oppenheimer’s theory is based on mitochondrial DNA, inherited through the mother, and Y chromosomes, inherited by males from the father. "  
Questions are often asked how were the samples extracted what are the chances on contamination? Any way I am not a genetic expert. If independent genetic experts can confirm such finds then we can further debate its implication but my understanding is that genetic arguments of AIT debate are not on firm grounds as the sample obtained itself many a times are not beyond doubt. One can argue either way one may even say modern man originated from India and not Africa. Such debates will remain endless with points and counterpoints from both the camps. euro Asia mailing list has several such discussions.  

One can see these links for those who wnat to know more
