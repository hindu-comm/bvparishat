Dear Friends!

Glad to know from these mails that my modern generation is coming nearer to the fact that Human body manifested first in Indian Continent.

As you/we know according to Geology - originally the Earth was covered by waters (ocean), the first appearance of dry earth was as Himalayas - just like a lotus - the highest plateau Tibet surrounded by the highest mountain peaks!

That was the first birthplace of Human body, consisting wisdom to use and conquer the Natural resources - physical, mental and psychic.

As Human population was increasing, simultaneously the span of dry earth capable to survive the progeny on it with flora and fauna also was elaborating in all directions.So the Human population was spreading all over, the journey was taking along the seeds of it's knowledge, culture and language originated in Himalayan region.

*Thus the Aaryans (the first indigenous intelligent human beings pro to investigating all heights and immense possibilities of versatile life) traveled around the earth. They traveled to North, West, East and South, enriched those regions with their wisdom and culture.*

*Urmila Sharma, Varanasi, Bhaarata.*
