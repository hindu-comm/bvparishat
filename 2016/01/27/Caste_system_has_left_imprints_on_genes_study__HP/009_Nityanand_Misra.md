Thanks Ajit Ji, but why the suggestion? The thread has not strayed from its topic and the discussion has been a nice one. Is it because the topic is perceived as controversial, or is it because there is a disagreement of views, or something else? What purpose would a discussion list serve if all threads with disagreement or uncomfortable topics are to be taken offline?
