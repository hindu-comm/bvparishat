Dear friends,  

In the line of my earlier posting, I would suggest people present and discuss their own work  

than analyzing third party work. Third party collaboration has to be done, but we have to  

give its its space and time before we announce our understanding in the collaboration.  

I do urge originality in work. Hope all appreciate. Book reviews can be tried as a part  

of the collaboration.  

Thank you.  

BM
