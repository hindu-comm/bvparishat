After Sir CV Raman got his Nobel Prize , Indian scientific research went into a copying mode.  

This was possibly state-sponsored first by British and then encouraged by the Government of  
India to create volume. The ambition was Vishvamitra style imitation competition which created  
some techniques but no knowledge. When I came to Pune Observatory about forty five years  
ago, such copying was rampant. My Sanskrit exposure is less than thirty years, but what thrills  
me is the amazing work on the fundamentals. To distinguish between what works and what could  
be true has been the hallmark of Indian thinking. But then the compilation of each शास्त्र must  

have been preceded by centuries of development where speculations must have been nurtured.  

We have to feel that energy and simulate it back in our educational processes.  
  

Lately I have been thinking about the Indian theories on comprehension as a neurological  

process. Like we have four stages वाक्, do we have stages of प्रत्यय, the process by  

which sensory information is discriminated and goes to बुद्धि?  

We are trying a follow up to our Bangkok work. I understand that the Buddhists probably  

thought through. We are just starting to dig. Please write if you have come across any  

literature or worked on the problem. Valmiki seems to know.
