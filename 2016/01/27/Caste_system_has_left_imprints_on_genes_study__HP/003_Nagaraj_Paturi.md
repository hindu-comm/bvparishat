The researchers in this article used four language families as one of the category of variables. Mr Suresh Kolichala who is on this list, is adding one more language category 'nishaada'. We may expect 'more robust' genome analysis in future when such new categories are added.



The present study does not seem to have taken into accountthesocially institutionalized matrilinealinter-caste 'gene mixing'(?) (as in Kerala and the north-east ). 



There are many other such aspects which when included may result in a 'more robust' outcome.
