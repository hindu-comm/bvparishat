The focus of this list is to discuss primarily Sanskrit Studies and its ramifications its manifestation and its impact on Sanskrit Studies rather than every controversy that's on the web that may or might not impact traditional Sanskrit studies. The list should primarily act as a platform for Sanskrit scholars in India who want exchange notes and ideas rather than tricky controversial or issues for which there can be an endless debate. This list was started to discuss original Sanskrit texts and studies and their impact but now don't you think there has been a drift in focus. That is just a view may be members can decide.
