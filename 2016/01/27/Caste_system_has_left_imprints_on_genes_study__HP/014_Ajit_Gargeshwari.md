I agree with you. You have studied Sanskrit grammar and other areas well. How best can the list make use of scholars like you and others on the list was my concern. Should we not focus more on Sanskrit Research, Indology, Indian Philosophy, Sanskrit Literature, Grammar, Indian Sciences based on ancient Sanskrit Jain or pali texts etc. To be
explicit should not this mailing list act as a platform to share ideas and research papers and thoughts before a paper or a book is written or after a paper or book is written for continued and continuous research?  
  
This is just a thought I am throwing to all list members. Occasionally other discussions can come in but not too frequently. Please note this is a thought not a rule binding on any members.
