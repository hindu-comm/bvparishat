Thanks Ajit Ji. My impression was that threads pertaining to some other topics like Indology and Science are welcome. The description of the group reads as below (accessed January 29 2016). It may be modified accordingly if the topics are to be limited to primarily Sanskrit studies.

  

"The objective of the list is to understand, preserve and enrich the Indian intellectual heritage.To be explicit this mailing list acts as a platform to share ideas and research papers in the areas of Sanskrit Research, Indology, Indian Philosophy, Sanskrit Literature, Grammar, Science etc."
