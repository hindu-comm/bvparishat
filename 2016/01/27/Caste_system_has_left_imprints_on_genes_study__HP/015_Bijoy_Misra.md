My personal view is that the list should encourage discussion of original work or review studies,  

than getting into open-ended argumentative exchanges. I had posted this video from  

Jerusalem earlier.   
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYKdsw8e1Zk&list=PLTn74Qx5mPsTdYxkp6R3lhrG_pu_CUn8V&index=27>  
  

Every statement in the video or the intent can be contested. But we must try to create a  

parallel body of work than simply pulling down.  
  

By the way, the discussion in the video might be a simulation of discussion in India in  

different settings to let speculations float. I saw the location at Nalanda where such discussion  
was possibly held.  
  

A Sanskrit teacher did ask a question in that Karnataka Sanskrit University video to distinguish  
between चर्चा and वाद. I thought India prospered through चर्चा .
