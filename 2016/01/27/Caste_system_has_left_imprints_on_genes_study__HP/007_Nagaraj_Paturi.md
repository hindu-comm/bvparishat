*--*The article opens with following words:



India, occupying the center stage of Paleolithic and Neolithic migrations, has been underrepresented in genome-wide studies of variation. Systematic analysis of genome-wide data, using multiple robust statistical methods, on (i) 367 unrelated individuals drawn from 18 mainland and 2 island (Andaman and Nicobar Islands) populations *selected *to represent* geographic, linguistic, and ethnic diversities*, and (ii) individuals from populations represented in the Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP), reveal four major ancestries in mainland India.



Table 1 gives the sample sizes as per the factors of diversity.



Do not the samples and sample sizes at the time of selection itself get affected by the factors of diversity chosen? Does not an individual get a chance to get included in the selected sample depending on those factors? Does not the outcome depend on the inclusion or non-inclusion?



I said, "The present study does not seem to have taken into accountthesocially institutionalized matrilinealinter-caste 'gene mixing'(?) (as in Kerala and the north-east )."



only because the conclusions are about upper caste and endogamy in them. This is self-explanatory.
