Dear Prof Sundaresan,  

Academics and publishing houses also operate like Indian "castes".
Sometimes there is  

an initiation process. The British invented it by creating a protocol of the paper being  

screened by a senior scholar, a "Fellow." S. Chandrasekhar's paper was rejected simply  

because Arthur Eddington didn't like it. In India there might be strong case of conformity  

exhibited by the consistency of the thoughts in scholars. All non-conforming writers  

rarely had a chance! It's said Tulsi Das had to do some tricks in the Temple in order  

that his manuscript could be read!  

All we can say, that we should be objective in evaluating people and intellect when we  

are in charge! As teachers mostly we are. As scholars we do look for like-mindedness  

possibly out of inner insecurity! Sometimes politicians pretend as scholars! It is  

Visvamitra's curse!
