Namaste



1. This is an interesting thread of discussion , especially when Sri Rajiv Malhotra’s book ‘Battle for Sanskrit’ is being released in India .



 The thread seems to have opened a Pandora’s box to debate on the singular issue: What constitutes ‘Scientific Publishing Standards’ in writing a journal articles in English, to deliberate topics debated in a diversity of ‘ Source works -Texts and structured Commentaries’ in a non-english like language, bound by the frame of Paninian Rules ? 



2. This specific framing of the debate-issue seems to me
important. Because the thread refers to a diversity of textual resources and a wide spectrum of journals – (indology to Science) and brings in classical texts - ‘Brahma-Sutra Bhashya of Shankara’ to
‘Tulsi Ramayana’ – covering a time span of several centuries; A time period when current model of ‘ print /cyber publishing’ was unknown !



 The composers of source works ( for convenience, Keeping the Vedas out of the discussion here) - starting with Maharshi Valmiki to Sant Tulsidas ( and of course Acharya Shankara and other Acharyas in the intervening period writing commentaries on Maharshi Vyasa’s work).




 What could have been the peer review process before these ‘traditional composers ‘ published their works’ ? Does it compare to in any way to the modern journal writers or book-publishing houses would expect it to be ‘released’ for ‘ public consumption’ after a ‘ peer review’ ! And what kind of indexing –reference resource did they follow beyond a generic statement in many cases like ‘ uktam cha Vyasena’ and the like.? How was the ‘ text’ verified and validated for its authenticity and continuity in an unbroken chain ? I am sure that intelligent scholars will not respond by pointers to palm leaves surviving from Maharshi Vyasa’s time in ‘caves at Badarika ashram’ ( for palm leaves have a specific shelf life, and connected issues on scripting – scribal errors ) OR Voice tradition comparable to Veda-preservation, which spikes in the ‘human memory challenges for authentic recall. 



 Yet all these composers followed an unwritten code of ‘ Composition –Presentation Analytics -Critiquing ( = Grathana –Jijnyasa – Vimarsha) of High standards . These works have stood the extremes of ‘peer review and criticism –elaboration ( Khadana Mandana
Punarniroopana) in post period of the composition’ in a time tested way and for centuries together; and continue to be respectfully studied in traditional schools.



 Why is this issue of interest here ? The key is ‘ Text Authenticity’ ( Moola-Paatha) and ‘Clear understanding of the intention of traditional text’ (Acharya Sampradaya) before ‘ Critical analysis’ and ‘Interpretational Commentary’ that is supposed to the ‘ soul of the journal article’ to get in to a ‘Peer reviewed journal’ to set standards’.



 What then is ground reality and challenge? Despite all the claims that Rigveda is preserved without loss or deviation of a single syllable, the printed works show significant variation in reading and recitation. The classic work Bhagavadgita has a debate on the number of slokas ( 699 -700 or 701 Or 745 ?) and chapter names in colophon.

 The very text of Gita as seen in manuscripts has reading variations . See url: <http://www.bhagavadgita.eu/>, The Text reading variations with manuscript reference available at this site is post 14^(th) century ! The text variation is not just scribal errors or oversights. Each variant reading has a specific purpose and connotation. Ultimately it leads a reader wondering – What did Yogeswara Sri Krishna told Arjuna ? And how was it preserved and transmitted over centuries, and what makes us trust that the ‘Gita As It is available now’ is same as the one that was ‘ composed –compiled –published’ by Maharshi Vyasa (Vyasena grathitaam Puraana Muninaa Madhye mahabharatam ?!)



3. In this background, May I make a humble submission to the scholars who have shared their views on this post and suggested that \< We really need a critical mass of good scholars who can publish \> and highlighted the caution that \< we are better off not mixing Indian traditional approaches and modern scientific approach \> :



 Can you please help in identifying and articulating the ‘Standards that the composers of traditional texts followed’ in ‘ making public their stand and understanding of the resource works composed prior to them’ ? What happened to these standards ? How are they different from the current ‘ journal article publication standards’ ?



 Example : What were the standards for Acharya Shankara ( upper limit 700 AD) to be met in writing his ‘Brahmasutra bhashya’ on Maharshi Vyasas ‘Brahma Sutra’ ( Upper limit 700 BCE) , which is to be used to understand the nutty and Knotted issues of debate in Upanishads (Upper limit 1500 BCE), which form an ‘ integral part of Vedas’ ( upper limit 600 BCE or rather time-less) ??





Thanks in advance for the help .
