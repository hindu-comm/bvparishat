Respected Members,  

 I would like to inform members that Vimana Shastra has not been studied with the respect it deserves. The studies by the scientist of the Indian Institute of Science focuses only on one adhikarna of the text which contains only 14 adhikaranas of the 100 adhikarnas mentioned . The research on Chumbak Mani a solar cell like substance mentioned in the text by the scientists of the IIT Bombay commenced in year 1964 with detailed analytical studies in 1984-89 have been very positive. Unfortunately this aspect is not known to scientist /scholars who think the text is unscientific. A special glass prepared on the basis of Amsubodhini have yeilded good results and findings published in the year 1998 in the prestigious Indian Journal of History of Science. Presently I alongwith a friend am working on the biography of Pt Subbarayya Shastri and wish to publish the same to commemorate the 150th birthday of Shastriji. It may be pointed out that Shastriji's first known article on Vimana Shastra was published in 1911 .The topic was Bha Mani Vimana i.e using 13 Manis (Solar Cell like substance) , This vimana is not published in the test on Vimana Shastra published.
Unfortunately out of the 18 issues of the monthly in which it was published I have been only able to trace only the first six issues. It is hoped that Sanskrit institutions in Bangalore would be able to trace Shastriji's manuscripts ( about 14 in number) and preserve them for posterity.
