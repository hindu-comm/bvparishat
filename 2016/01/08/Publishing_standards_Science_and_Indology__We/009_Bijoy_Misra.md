Dear Dr Sastry,  

Let me express what my take is.  
  

1. All creative works should be considered original, hence Valmiki, Kalidasa or  
 Tulasi Das. They are not commenting on anything or creating history.  

 The material is retained through public acceptance. Revisions or modifications  

 might have happened in course of time engineered through the public.  

  

2. Commentaries were most likely evaluated in course of time. My belief is that  

  for each commentary we have now, many other commentaries did not survive.  

  We do see appreciation in texts to underscore this.  
  

3. The shastra and suutra texts give occasional reference to the previous sources.  

  One can speculate that acknowledgements existed and have not survived.  

  It could also be that a person was "commissioned" to undertake the compilation  

  and the "compiler" has been mis-identified as the "author."  
  

4. In texts like Bhatrhari one sees reference to "schools" and "groups". I would think  

  that the author was cognizant of the "critics" for acceptance of his analytic  

  material. I would think that the protocol got more organized in Buddhism though  

  I have not studied Buddhist literature in the original.  
  

Best regards,  

BM
