Friends,  

Again we are wasting time on trivial discussion. Philosophy of research is different than contents  

of research. We may talk of philosophy after having contributed to the field for at least ten years.  

While we may accept creative writing anonymously, all contents must have a face behind them  

to have any use. Human beings have a tendency to go political easily through vanity. It is  

rampant in the west. I would simply request to keep BVP list above any political slant. At the  

same time personal well thought out and considered opinions should be welcome and respected.  

The degree of scholarship we exhibit is the responsibility of the individual list member in my view.  

To discover India's heritage is the goal. A distilled contribution in any small measure is an addition.  

Let us begin the new year with a determination to contribute and not mutually criticize.  

Thank you.  

BM
