Let me try to note my disagreement with some of the below, while being respectful to the norms of this mailing list.

At the outset, let me say that ideas deserve respect only if one agrees that they are worthy - no matter who says it. Of course, to the maximum extant possible people expounding such ideas, and their efforts should be respected. I indeed respect shrI nityAnanda and shrI bijoy for their consideration, without necessarily saying the same about the fruits of such consideration.

I believe this goes well with the note in the other email on "anonymous writing and copy-paste scholarship" as well.  
  
There is some truth in the statements dealing with non-peer reviewed expositions in general, as acknowledged in my previous email. Certainly, scholarship which is deeper than one that relies on indexes, prefaces, web search and copy paste is better. All this is obvious.  
  
However, it is frankly this kind of hubris that so disturbs many scholars (some of whom I noted in my previous email) about the system, which besides injuring the spirit of science, makes it needlessly hostile to outsiders and amateurs. It exposes a (hypocritical) tendency to put the \*form of scholarship\* above the \*substance\*.  
  
If some one clearly exposes other's misunderstandings by presenting some pramANa-s in the form of direct quotes, simply mocking it as "copy-paste scholarship" is hardly a noble response. Rather, he should be thanked, or if necessary countered by scholarship of a deeper kind (if one can manage it). Otherwise, the person taking the trouble to call out mistakes will start to feel like the bird in viShNusharman's tale who tried to advice an irate monkey.

  

If bhagavaan kShemendra were writing his darpa-dalana etc.. today, he would without doubt apply his magical satire to it when speaking of vidyAmada or tapomada, or while mocking ChAtra-s or giving up on asAdhya-shiShya-s. People may be interested in reflecting on it.
