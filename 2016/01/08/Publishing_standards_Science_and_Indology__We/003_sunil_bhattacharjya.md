Yes, let the evidences be put forward and not just assertions like \<\*many\* Indian scholars somehow think that AIT is dead, it is unscientific etc., which is far from the truth.> . Good work with verifiable evidences alone will help us produce quality work. It is also possible that any good work can stand on its own feet, even if the scholastic support may take time to appear. Let us hope that the new year will let us see more mails with facts and figures than with verbosity.
