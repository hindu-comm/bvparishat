No one can trace his manuscripts its a bogus work based on either based Non existent manuscripts or manuscripts written during modern times. Let any one convincingly establish the truth about such claims and I will agree. Lets non mix pseudo science and science. Lets study ancient Indian sciences in the spirit of scholarship and give them the high respect they deserve. You are welcome to publish his works wish you all the best. He wrote what he believed to be the truth about 100 adhikarnas. Lets first see the 100 adikarnas and then speculate. I agree with this part any work written should be preserved for posterity and there is second thought on this.
