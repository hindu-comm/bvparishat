Dear all,

  

\* Let me first acknowledge and agree with shrI nityAnanda's comments about the blog post being unauthoritative; and that his warnings indeed appropriate (if a bit over repeated). Despite repeatedly saying stuff like "अङ्गीकाराभावेऽपि परीक्षा चर्चा वा न बाध्यते ननु?", I must have been misunderstood. I should have been clearer and decisive in acknowledging shrI nityAnanda's warning and helping both of us move on.*That said, I still feel that the contents of the blog deserved to be discussed and criticized (ie. it passes a certain bar of plausibility), if only for the benefit of people such as myself - it is simply not sufficient that the author's style and verbiage are not the most appealing to some people.  
*  
\* Let me also acknowledge the importance of peer review to science. Without peer review, scholars would need to wade through a lot of crap to get to significant papers. There have been many scholars (Grothendiek) who have been very bitterly cynical about the academic publishing system(and the associated "publish or perish"or "follow the fashion set by a few people" paradigms). Indeed people like Grisha Perelman and Dijkstra simply refused to participate in that circus. It is this cynicism (which is actually commonplace among academics) which found its expression in words like "rag" and "tabloid". We should allow them atleast that freedom of expression, I feel.  
  
\* "Ultimately, it is published research and citations which shapes academic discourse and not posts on BVP (or Indology), blogs, Facebook or Twitter (no matter how many likes or shares they may get)." - I generally agree with this sentiment, although discussion on mailing lists, social media and even in-person conversations play is indeed part of some necessary undercurrent of academic discourse. Please consider the fact that some people (including the Indian authors of the 2009 Nature paper themselves) held views that ran counter to the article itself. Please also consider the fact that \*many\* Indian scholars somehow think that AIT is dead, it is unscientific etc., which is far from the truth.

  
In fact, my own motivation in publishing this blog post (not mine) and the associated diagram (which I made) was to help people see the other side. The fact that it hurts me to hear people criticize Hindus for living under such illusions motivated me, not much else. I did not think that people here would be capable of improving my understanding (though I am happy to be pleasantly surprised).  
  
\* I certainly second the sentiment in "We have only been mocked (and deservedly so) for parading Vedic Math, Vaimanika Shastra and papers like*Lord Shiva: The Greatest Environmentalist in the World*in the latest Indian Science Congress."  
  
\* Regarding "There are certainly authors pushing an agenda in the field of Indology, but I do not agree with writings which paint a broad set of people as Hindu-haters or anti-India, sometimes based on stretched interpretations of one piece of writing.", I have strong disagreement. But talking more about it would upset the moderators, so I will bide my peace.
