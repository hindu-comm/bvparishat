I would like to go back to the original points raised by Sri Nityanand Misra and make a few observations, based on my having published in both scientific and non-scientific journals.

  

I agree that the level of standards and the willingness to publish papers that challenged the status quo is higher in science journals. On the other hand, rather than describing it all as publishing standards, I would talk of editing standards, peer-reviewing standards and publishing standards. Many notable scientists have been dissatisfied with how major publishing houses treat the publication of research findings as a profit making venture and are therefore supporting initiatives like the open access Public Library of Science.

  

In the world of science and technology research, you will also see a lot of me-too papers that jump on to the latest fad as well as the few really important ones that push the boundaries of current knowledge. If you organize a timeline of papers according to subject, you will see massive spikes in the number of papers on specific topics, e.g. Buckminsterfullerene or green fluorescent protein (GFP). Only a few of these papers will be really pathbreaking and these won't always be in journals like Nature or Science. And in these high name-recognition journals, you will also find papers that are later proven by other scientists to be bunkum, e.g. a 2010 Science paper on bacteria that grow using arsenic instead of phosphorus was shown to be totally false, within two years. The peer review process does have its slips, but in general, members of the scientific research community who serve as journal editors and peer reviewers are not afraid to recommend papers for publication, even if they challenge their own perspectives.

  

The first non-scientific paper that I submitted for review to a journal (I won't name it here) showed me that this is not the case for other fields. I had argued that rejecting the attribution of a text to Sankaracharya should not be decided solely on Paul Hacker's narrow set of criteria based on the Brahmasutrabhashya. I had demonstrated that very different conclusions could be drawn by comparing a given text with other key commentaries like the Gitabhashya and major Upanishad Bhashyas. This paper was rejected within a week, by the journal's editor, a fairly well known American Ivy League scholar in Indian philosophy, but without any kind of review. All I got was a short note saying that there was absolutely no need to revisit the question of authorship and to challenge the established scholarly consensus! I wouldn't have much minded it if my paper had actually been read and reviewed, instead of being rejected unilaterally by an editor. To its credit, the second journal to which I then submitted the same paper did send it on for scholarly review and it got accepted, with suggestions for a couple of minor revisions. If the editor of this other journal had decided to do exactly as the editor of the first, I would have been totally disillusioned about trying to publish anything at all.

  

I suspect that a significant resistance to challenge accepted paradigms is an issue not only in Indological fields but in much of the humanities and social sciences. To be sure, there is resistance to challenges in scientific publishing as well, because scientists are also human after all, but the nature and degree of such resistance are quite different. Overall, I agree that if we want to make a lasting change to the way things Indian are discussed, analyzed and understood in the world, there is no substitute for long-term, constructive engagement with the world of academic publishing at a high level of quality. Online forums may be fine for mooting/sharing ideas and basic discussions, but such activity (or even writing independent books, a la Rajiv Malhotra) does not really offer a viable substitute. We really need a critical mass of good scholars who can publish and Bharatavarsha is nowhere the numbers that it needs.

  

In particular, given the predominantly Indian membership of this forum, I would also like to emphasize that journals published out of India have to wake up really fast and bring up their quality and levels of scholarly rigour. There are very few that can meet international standards. We could learn a thing or two from countries like Japan in these areas.

  

Best regards,

Vidyasankar
