Dear list members

  

This is an offshoot from some issues raised on the thread on AIT and genetics. I would like to share some experiences, thoughts, and views and invite comments from members (including Vishvas). 

  

Publications in the field of pure and applied sciences are not free from issues of plagiarism and intellectual dishonesty. Late last year, I cited the paper *China’s Publication Bazaar* by Mara Hvistendahl (*Science*, Volume 32, Nov 2013, pp. 1035–1039) on this list which highlighted how even Elsevier journals are not free from these issues. However, that does not make journals like Science, Nature, or journals by Routledge/Elsevier any less great. They still have one of the highest publishing standards in the world. A generalization calling them *tabloids* or *rags* only belies an opinion or agenda.

  

From what I learn from my father's experience, there does not appear to be a systematic agenda in such journals. New research (both theoretical and practical), even if it contradicts established research, is welcomed although after critical evaluation. My father's paper on CO2 loss due to photorespiration in well-watered plants (*J. Plant Physiology*, Feb 2014, 171 (3): 319-328, synopsis [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24157314)) challenged what was an established scientific statistic for many decades using a purely theoretical approach (no practical experiment). The paper was rejected by one journal as the referees were not convinced of the hypothesis. It was subsequently accepted by *Plant Physiology* (Elsevier) and is now cited by other studies. This does not take away anything from the greatness of the first journal or its referees/editors. I can confirm this from my own experience: a co-authored paper of mine (leading author Prof. Malay Bhattacharyya of IIM Bangalore) on a new model for financial risk over asset holding period (*Quantitative Finance*, 9(8), May 2009, pp. 925-935, synopsis [here](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14697680802595684)) was rejected by a journal with comments including some suggestions for improvements. A revised edition which incorporated the suggested improvements was accepted by Quantiative Finance (Routledge). I do not have any problems with the first journal or the referees who rejected the paper.

  

If there are experiences or studies relating to these top journals which suggest a different picture, I would love to read them.

  

The case of Indology may be different, as there is more room for subjective opinions and even agenda in social sciences. I do not have the experience to speak anything on the top journals in this field as I have not published in any top Indological journal. Are they open to challenging established notions and results? I do not know, but would be interested to know and maybe the members can help. There are certainly authors pushing an agenda in the field of Indology, but I do not agree with writings which paint a broad set of people as Hindu-haters or anti-India, sometimes based on stretched interpretations of one piece of writing. There are self-appointed custodians of Hinduism who pour scorn after scorn on Western Indologists, but they only add noise.

  

Be it Indology or any other academic field, my view is scientific publishing standards deserve to be respected and emulated, and not mocked or discarded. Facts are to be welcomed, but what appears as opinions and agenda/propaganda are to be questioned.I am in complete agreement with Dr. Bijoy Misra on his views on anonymous writing and copy-paste scholarship. Ultimately, it is published research and citations which shapes academic discourse and not posts on BVP (or Indology), blogs, Facebook or Twitter (no matter how many likes or shares they may get).

  

Before I end, I may add my view that we are better off not mixing Indian traditional approaches and modern scientific approach: both are suitable in their own places (e.g. a traditional commentary or a piece of scientific writing). We have only been mocked (and deservedly so) for parading Vedic Math, Vaimanika Shastra and papers like*Lord Shiva: The Greatest Environmentalist in the World* in the latest Indian Science Congress.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
