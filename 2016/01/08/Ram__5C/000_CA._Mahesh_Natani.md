Respected Scholars,  
  
Pranam. Could you please as per your knowledge and wisdom throw light on how "Ram" is spelt 1)रां 2) राम or 3)as per Tulsidasji as in ek chatra ek mukut mani. Not able to type it using google keyboard.  
  
Sorry for the poor language. Please forgive errors if any.  
  
Shri Misraji,  
  
I understand that ati sangarsham kar jo koi, anal prakat chandan te hoi. I beg for your able guidance for one last time for my thirst for self learning of Sanskrit.  
  
Regards,  
  
Mahesh
