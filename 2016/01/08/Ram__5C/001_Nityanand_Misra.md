रां is how theबीज of the षडक्षर राममन्त्र is spelt.  

राम is how the name राम is spelt

Tulasidāsa's verse does not give a new spelling of the name राम but only the qualities of the two consonants in the name राम, namely that the syllables र and म are placed on top of all others, one as a chatra (र as the ardha-candra at the beginning of a conjunct) and other as a mukuṭamaṇi (म as the anusvara). Please refer Manasa Piyush on the verse.
