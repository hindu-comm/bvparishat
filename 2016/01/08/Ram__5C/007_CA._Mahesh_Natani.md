Do Tulsidasji refer to Ram bija, Ram naam aur shadakshar mantraraja in Naam Mahima.

What is difference in:  
Guru naam and guru mantra

Specifically Ram naam and Shadakshar mantra

Which is superior bija, naam aur mantra.

Requesting scholars to clear my doubts with relevance to Manasa, shruti and smriti.

Regards,

Mahesh
