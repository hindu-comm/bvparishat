Dear friends,  
  

Has any research work been done on the date and the real name of the courtier turned King, who had the pen-name "Shudraka"? Who were his parents and where was his capital city? Does his pen-name indicate that his mother was from a shudra family?  
  

Thanking you in advance and with regards.  
  

Sunil Bhattacharjya
