I observed the translations of medical terms above. Scholars with a common aim may come together to build a team for this great cause. This is the right time to start some good and big project.  

I have no difference of opinion that Dr.Ramanujam and Ambal are great contributors to Sanskrit and the greatnness of the project of English Medical Terminology translated into Sanskrit.

And there is no different opinion that there are many Greek, Latin and many more languages used in day to day usage by medical practitioners during the professional training as well during professional life which may translated into Sanskrit.

But I am not certain of the utility of such a dictionary. Sanskrit learners may be learning Medical Courses and and in that case they may refer to this dictionary and write the English Paper in Sanskrit ad get. 99% marks ? Or know more than their teachers who would be explaining them i classes in English! And treat better the patients after learning the etymology grammatically and use to it to select the correct medicine better than those who do not know grammatical and etymological meaning? And how the project would be useful for Sanskrit Learners or Scholars! Or more importantly for the patients? Or the doctors treating the patients?
