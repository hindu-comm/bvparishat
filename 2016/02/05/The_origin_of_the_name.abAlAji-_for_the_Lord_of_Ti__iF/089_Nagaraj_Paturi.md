Dear Dr Joshi,



1\. All the numbered points in the pdf are my own original ideas. They were not my research publication, though many of the points are results of my research on various issues as part of my academic career. The pdf contains putting together of a long series of my posts to an online list/group.



2\. Mention of American university is because the whole series was triggered by a class room exercise given in American university.It was an interesting, admirable exercise, a very good way of making students independently critically think about what is taught.The teacher asked the students to enlist reasons for why Krishna wasconsidered avatar of Vishnu rather than, say, Shiva. The moderator of the list, who was the friend of this teacher mentioned iton the list. As a matter of course, he asked why Avataras were for only Vishnu and not Shiva. The discussion went to similarities between Vishnu and Devi.I mentioned Appayya Dikshita's interesting concept of Ratna traya. Then as part of the discussion I was asked by the moderator to provide a more detailed deep rationale for the features of various gods. I obliged by posting two three points in each post. It finally turned out to be a huge list. I saved all the posts and put them together for whatever itwas worth.



3\. I think, if you read the points again, you should be able to follow.



4\. In any case, if you have any difficulty in understanding, I am at your service online or offline.
