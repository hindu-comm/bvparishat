Dear Prof S.Korada,



\(1\) First question: Thanks for explanation about the word Balaji. What about Venkata the name of the mountain where there is Tirupati temple? Is Venkata Deshi word or Sanskrit? Others have given "Vem katati iti Venkata?" Is this correct?



\(2\) Second question: Hundreds of Saints from different regions of India in the past 10 centuries written religious books in Deshi languages-example Jnaaneshvari by Sant Jnaaneshvara and Abhangas of Sant Tularama and many more. How can we say their Dashi words do not fetch Dharma? Ramakrishna Paramahansa said if child says Ba the father understands it. In my opinion Sanskrit words alone have no monopoly for fetching Dharma. Please contradict me. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
