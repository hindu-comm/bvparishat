रामा as a vocative is in universal use in प्राकृतम् (i.e. not only Hindi) throughout Northern India. And this is indeed naturalistic, evidenced by other uses (in a-ending nouns) such as यारा (vocative) for यार (male friend), and therefore is not borrowed.

  

Now, regarding बाला.

  

Again, in North we have:

बालमा (voc.) and बलमा (voc.) for बालम (male friend) and बलम (male friend).

  

balls : testicles, ball : round object, ballsy : courageous, bald : no hair on (round) scalp (thus exposed), bull, bell, etc.

  

Hindi: बल manly power, बाल hair growing on (round) scalp, बाला bangle (round), बाली earring (round), बेल a round fruit, बाली Sugreeva's powerfulbrother, etc.

  

In fact, shaving the head (scalp) at Tirupati could be related to the wordroot.

  

जी following a vocative is easy to understand. But the deeper question is indeed of the original uses of vocative. I was hoping to show it, among other things, in my thread on "Law of Sanskrit".

  

To summarise, I must emphasise again that बालाजी means "He" (not related with Krishna).

The historical questions are highly irrelevant, since the "He" could have been any male deity, theoretically. The exchange of deities, among different dhārmika orientations, in temples is a commonly observed phenomena all over India. There is more unity among dhārmika traditions than what is acknowledged superficially. The point is, the spiritual power remains the same.
