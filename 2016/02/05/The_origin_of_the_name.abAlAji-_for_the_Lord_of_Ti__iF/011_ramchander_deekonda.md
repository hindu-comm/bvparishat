Namaste,

  

I have been very curious about the deity of Tirumala since my childhood. Long time back I met one Kanpuri Brahmin in Hyderabad. While discussing about Tirupati Balaji, he told me very interesting things.

  

!. He said that that deity has nothing to do with Hindu religion. According to him it is neither Vishnu nor Shiva. It is a compromised deity of Hari-Hara-Devi (*Balatripurasundari*)

  

2\. He also told me that there were many strifes/wars between *Vaishnavas* and *Saivas* in the south. Hence in order to bring harmony between these feuding sects, Adi Sankara devised a plan,which was a part of his mission, to convert the Jain Temple into a vedic/Hindu temple. For this purpose, he made the jain tirthankara's idol a new Hindu god by coining and naming it *Venkateshwara*. 

  

3\. For this purpose, the Jain deity was decorated with *vaishnava* and *saiva* marks. Vishnu is not Nagabushana, vishnu is nagasayana, but in this deity one find *naga abharanas.*

  

4\. Jain architecture has distinct features in idols. Elongated ears, wide eyes, curly hair etc. In order to conceal those Jain features, big 'naamam' (vertical tilak marks) and big ear-coverings camouflage the face of the deity. Even the '*abhaya hastham*' is also a cover to the straight hand of the Jain deity I am told.

  

5\. He further told me, that it is Jain tradition that *tirthankara* idols stand alone. (cf:shravana belagola etc). Since Hindu gods, especially *vaishnava* idols always have consorts by their side, special place is made in the chest region of the Jain idol for the placement of *Sri Dev*i and *Bhu Devi*.



6\. That Kanpuri Brahmin also told me that shaving head is also a Jain practice, that was adopted in this tirumala Temple.

  

7\. Another important point is that the Laddu prasad is not the culture of south Indian temple traditions. It is north Indian adopted here.

  

8\. Finally it was asserted that the name Balaji, is nothing but a contracted form of *Balatripurasundari*.. Please note, many Archakas hold that the deity of Tirumala has feminine features.

  

9\. The story of Akasha Raju, and Muslim king etc appear to be just fictitious *sthala puranam*. I have been told that the Muslim story of Bibi Nanchari etc are not verifiable historically, since all Muslim rule of the south is well recorded. These stories are never recorded anywhere.

  

10\. Last, according to many the name Padmavati is closely related to
Jainism. She is the consort of a Tirthankara. This name appears to have been conveniently used here to denote consort of Venkateshwara.

  

11\. He also told me that Mahant-administration is also a north Indian concept, a remnant of Jain temple administration.

  

Dear scholars please note, I have just jotted down what I was told when I was too young. There appears to be lot of truism in what I have written above. An investigative analysis is required to refute the above observations.
