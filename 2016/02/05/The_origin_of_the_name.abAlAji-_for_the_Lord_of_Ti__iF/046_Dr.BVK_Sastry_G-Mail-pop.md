Namaste Nagaraj Paturi



On the point \< sifting through Tamil verse to discover at least one Sanskrit word from it \> , my question is connecting two specific issues in this thread and the related time lines. The focus on understanding one word in isolation through this debate cannot be limited to a narrow lane and select advancing of linguistic theories.



**First point**: The Sanskrit quoted text and tradition of Sri Venkateswara / Balaji is around 1400 A.D. ( Earlier posts by Rani Sadashiva murthy)



**Second point**: The noted verse according to Ramachandra Deekonda’s post, is a document timed to \< 5th century CE> and comes from \< Silappadikaram 11.41-51>.



**The question/s**: As the word ‘Sri Venkata’ and ‘Balaji’ appears across almost all south Indian languages as a part of ‘Hari-Dasa-Sahitya’, and draws upon the explanation in puranas of early period, How may we explore the word-osmosis across south Indian languages stretched across a time line spanning almost 1400 years (approximately) ?



**The off shoot issues being:** What was the perceived linguistic and grammar based relation of \<Tadbhava-Tatsama> word –formation and word- conversion rules between Sanskrit and regional languages like Tamil –Telugu- Kannada ? And same for word borrowings across these regional languages ? Do we have an INDIAN – INDIGENOUS –LANGAUGE GRAMMAR WORKS / Lexicons based study ? 



What footprints/ guidelines do we find in Tamil - Telugu – Kannada grammars in relation to word-osmosis and cross linking of regional languages used for Vishnu worship ?



How much of \<Tamil-Telugu- Kannada- Sanskrit> word –osmosis is present in the compositions of great Vaishnava Saint Sri Tallapaka Annamacharya (1408-1503) ? Sri Purandara Dasa (1494-1564) ? What was the take of Sri Ramanujacharya in ubhaya Vedanta proposition /Sri Vedanta Deshika in his works on this issue ?



In view of this, probably the effort to identify the ‘Telugu and Kannada words’ in the given ‘Tamil Composition’ may be something worth exploring. This may also be helpful to understand a continuity of tradition and faith in Vishnu worship; and clear many ‘ inaccurate representations of Venkateswara Balaji as ‘ Deification of a Tribal mountain chief for worship / on the same model of ‘Subramanya’ in Tamil tradition’ (?!) .





Look forward for your comments pl.

\> Since yesterday I have been sifting through this Tamil verse to discover at least one Sanskrit word from it. I have failed to recognize even one except the proper name "venkata".
