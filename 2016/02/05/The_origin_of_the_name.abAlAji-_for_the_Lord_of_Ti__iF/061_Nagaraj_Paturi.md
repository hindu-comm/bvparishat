The sources consulted by me so far did not indicate that these names are titles or birudas. They confirm that these are the actual names of the kings only.



In Telugu too, among personal names of general population as recorded in inscriptions and literary worksincluding the names of great poets,
des'ya and tadbhava words dominated till recently. Nannaya, Tikkana, Errana, Potana, Duggana, Baddena, ........ the list of names of poets can go on and on. The names found in the inscriptions for common people are usually Polamma, Ellamma etc.



It is a general observation among even common Telugu people that favouring Sanskrit names is increasing with increasing modernizationeven among families that favouredlocal 'pure Telugu'names (that were in majority)during premodern times. Another observation in this regard is thathalantatva in imitation of Hindi (English too?)names is increasing with increasing modernization.
