Dear Vidwan Ramchander Deekonda,



> Long time back I met one Kanpuri Brahmin in Hyderabad. While discussing about Tirupati Balaji, he told me very interesting things.



------ What kind of a reference is this?



There is a lot of such gossip that goeson in conversations of non-academic setup.Such conversations are a hotchpotch ofpopularized (gossipized if I may use that word) versions of academic research publicized through some half-baked media reports confidently thrown into conversations by the readers of such reports with the tone of an authentic expert in the field. It makes an interesting research topic to study such conversations, their mix oftrivialized research data and usual trivial routine gossip etc. particularlyfor academicians to realize the fate of their academic findings after they get opened into
popular circulation.



But to bring them back into academic discussions citing them asa reference point to discuss is not proper.



TTD itself took up the study of the inscriptions related to the shrine and published most of them.



The recordsavailable appear totake us back upto 9th century ADconnecting to the Pallava rulers of Kanchipuram. According to some studies, Kautuka Beram or Bhoga Srinivasa , the tiny one foot silver deity was given to the temple by the Pallava queen Samavai Perindevi , the date of the donation traced to 614 AD.



Annamacharya of 15th century AD, talks of one Tondaman Chakravarti as an important figure in the establishment of the shrine.



The lyrics of Annamacharya reflect a scenario of a wide, elaboate and vibrant, daily, weekly and other such periodical celebrations at the shrine with great grandiose. It may be noted that this is well before the big patronage by Sri Krishna Devaraya.



Early inscriptions at the shrineare mostly damaged due to the wear and tear that is quite natural in such a place of huge humanmovement from centuries.



That said, the antecedents ofmany places can be traced back to the prehistoric times ofpaleolithic or even earlier stages. But what is the point?



Regards,



Nagaraj
