That is why in the specific verse cited by Shankara in the VSN bhāṣyam from the Harivamṣa 3.88. 61, 61, 62 which are addressed by Maheśwara during the Kailāsa yātra episode:

  

अहं त्वं सर्वगो देव त्वमेवाहं जनार्दन ।

आवयोरन्तरं नास्ति शब्दैरर्थैर्जगत्त्रये ॥

\[I am thou and thou alone am I, O Janārdana. There is no difference between us, by word or by sense in all the three worlds.\]

  

That is being elucidated in the sequel:

  

नामानि तव गोविन्द यानि लोके महान्ति च ।

तान्येव मम नामानि नात्र कार्या विचारणा ॥

\[O Govinda, your esteemed names alone are mine as well; no doubt need to be had in this regard\] There Veda Vyasa, through Śiva, conveys that all the names of Viṣṇu, including the name ‘Nārāyaṇa’ are that of Śiva.
Thus the thousand names of Viṣṇu are also those of Śiva since there is no difference in name and sense between the pair Hari and Hara.

  

त्वदुपासा जगन्नाथ सैवास्तु मम गोपते ।

यश्च त्वां द्वेष्टि भो देव स मां द्वेष्टि न संशयः ॥

  

\[The worship/meditation of You, O Gopati, let that be meditation of mine too. He who hates you O Deva, hates me too, undoubtedly.\]

  

In the above the worship of Viṣṇu is equated with the worship of Śiva.

  

In the invocation to the Srimadbhagavata vykhyā Sridhara Swamin says, **in the last verse:**

In the Mahabharata is this verse:

  

रुद्रो नारायणश्चैव सत्त्वमेकं द्विधाकृतम् \|लोके चरति कौन्तेय व्यक्तिस्थं सर्वकर्मसु \|\|२४\|\|
