नमस्ते,  
  
Consider two words: बालाजी and रामाजी.  
जी is honorific. Also, बाला and रामा both are in vocative.  
  
Both बाल and राम, fundamentally mean: "male"  
So बालाजी (as well as रामाजी) means:  
"He"  
(with a capital h)  
  
Of course that would be Lord Vishnu here.  
The actual accents - how people down South here - pronounce बालाजी supports what I said.  
  
The moral of the story:  
a) Sanskrit lost accents.  
b) Sanskrit lost varied use of vocative.  
c) Tradition is therefore, as an authority, higher than a loukika bhAShA, and shouldn't be doubted so easily.
