Hathi Ram Baba Math, Balaji being a North Indian word seem to be compatible with each other.



Adoni (place of my birth), a town near Mantralayam has Mathas established by /called after Hathi Ram Baba. They are called Babaji Math and alternatively Balaji Math.



Rajput families of Adoni are associated with it.



The maths have huge collection of Vishnu Salagramas.



There seems to be a connection of Child Krishna worship in these maths.
