I agree with L. Srinivas and Nagaraj.  
  
1. Tirumala has been a Vishnu shrine at least since the 5th century CE. See the reference in Silappadikaram 11.41-51  
  
vīṅkunī raruvi vēṅkaṭa meṉṉum  
ōṅkuyar malaiyat tucci mīmicai  
virikatir ñāyiṟun tiṅkaḷum viḷaṅki  
irumaruṅ kōṅkiya iṭainilait tāṉattu  
miṉṉukkōṭi yuṭuttu viḷaṅkuviṟ pūṇṭu 45  
naṉṉiṟa mēkam niṉṟatu pōlap  
pakaiyaṇaṅ kāḻiyum pālveṇ caṅkamum  
takaipeṟu tāmaraik kaiyi ṉēnti  
nalaṅkiḷar āram mārpiṟ pūṇṭu  
polampū vāṭaiyiṟ polintu tōṉṟiya 50  
ceṅkaṇ neṭiyōṉ niṉṟa vaṇṇamum

  
I came to see the splendor of red-eyed Vishnu  
Holding in his elegant lotus hands  
The wheel that augurs death to his enemies  
And the milkwhite conch, who appears radiant  
In a cloth of golden flowers with a wreath  
Of tender blossoms flung over his chest  
On the peak of the sublime hill known as Venkatam  
Bathed by waterfalls in spate, he lives--  
The hill erect as a dark cloud  
Robed in lighting and brightened with a rainbow  
Its lofty heights washed by the outspread rays  
Of the sun and moon. (Cilappatikāram 11.41-51)  



2\. The name Balaji is due to the Maratha influence in South India in the 18th Century.

  

3\. Annamayya's lyric about various god forms should be taken in a philosophical stride. He is describing the brahman as: "You are just about as much as one imagines you to be -- as the lotus spreads to the limits of the lake". He wrote several such padams, where he describes God to be limited by the imagination of the devotee. Two more examples:

'enta mātramuna' should be interpreted similarly as one interprets Tyagaraja's 'Śivuḍanō, mādhavuḍanō, kamalabhavuḍanō, evarani nirṇayincēdirā'.

  

Suresh.
