Vidvan Nagaraj ji



  

You are right. "Balaji" for Rajasthanis (Marwadis) means Hanuman. My empirical knowledge confirms this. In the state of Telangana, specially in Hyderabad and Secunderabad there are innumerable Sweet shops (halwai shops) owned by Rajasthanis. Invariably the names of all these shops are prefixed with "Balaji". Examples: Balaji Ratanlal, Balaji Bajrang, Balaji Satya narayan etc.,

Once I inquired from a shop keeper if this Balaji has anything to do with our Venkateswara. He told me that it could also mean that; but essentially it referred to Bajrang Bali (Hanuman). Interestingly these shops are mostly situated besides Hanuman Mandirs. Hyderabad has several Hanuman temples wherein the priest are Rajasthani Brahmins.
