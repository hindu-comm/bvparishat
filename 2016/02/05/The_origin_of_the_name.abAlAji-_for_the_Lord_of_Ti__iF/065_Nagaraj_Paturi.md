My observations in my previous posts indicate that : 1. Names of common people tending more towards non-Sanskritnative core is shared both by Telugu and Tamil. 2. Names of kings tending more towards Sanskrit is also common between the two languages. 3.Sanskrit names of gods found in names ofTamil kings indicate that such names were not unknown in Tamil country during that period. 4. This does not contradict the theory of greater ratio of Des'ya and Tadbhava words in Tamil and greater ratio of Tatsama words in Telugu.



History of Telugu literature indicates that most of the Telugu poetsbecame conscious about the ratio of Tatsama words in their expression, particularly after the Des'i movement of the Viras'aiva Telugu poets.



There was an Aachchhika/Achchatenugu movement during 17th and 18th centuries whichfancied the non-tatsama (desya+tadbhava) expression as its style. That this movement did not find great popularity among Telugu populationconfirms thefavour for tatsama in Telugu.
