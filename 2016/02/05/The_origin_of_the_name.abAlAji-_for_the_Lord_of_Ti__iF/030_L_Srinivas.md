In the official 'History of Tirupati' published by the Tirumala-Tirupati Devasthanams, the Samavai inscription is dated to 966 AD. (Vol 1, p. 57). The name 'Balaji' is dealt with in this work on p 197 under the caption 'Some Crude and Incorrect Notions'.  
  
In the earliest period, most deities of Siva and Vishnu temples in Tamilnadu primarily had Tamil names. When the mahatmyams started getting written, the Tamil name used to be translated to Sanskrit or a brand new name in accordance with local traditions would be given in Sanskrit. The Tamil bhakti hymns to Siva and Vishnu called the 'Tevaram' and 'Divya Prabandham' generally do not have Sanskrit names for the deities at all. The Tamil name of the Deity was generally though not always of the type - Lord of the \<place name>. Tirupati is consistently refered to as 'Venkatam' or addressed as 'venkatavaa' - one who resides in Venkatam, or 'tiruvenkatathaan' which means the same. Names such as Srinivasan (for the deity at Tirumala) or Varadarajan (for the deity at Kanchi) are totally new fangled ones. I daresay that these names became popular after the Telugu occupation of Tamilnadu. These names are not seen much among personal names of Vaishnavas in the earlier Chola period either. Even Annamacharya invariably uses local names like 'Venkateshu' for the Lord of Tirumala, as also Tamil names for various saints such as Tirumalai Nambi (not Sri Sailapurna), Tiru Kacchi Nambi (not Sri Kanchi purna), Tondaman Chakravarti (not Pallavaputra chakravarti) . In this scale of usage, 'Balaji' is totally a new fangled name. Most authorities (incl the TTD history) think that this name dates from the period when Maratha presence came to be recorded in the area.  
  
All other speculations that the Deity in Tirumala is Durga, or Kartikeya or Siva or Buddha etc are merely polemical and utterly devoid of merit. The deity in Tirumala has a long history of textual references in Tamil dating back to 'cilappatikaram' (the Song of the Anklet), dated to something like 5th century AD . ( I dont know the authoritative dates for it). In the old Tamil literary works and in Bhakti works, Tirumala (or Venkatam, to give it its old name), has always been described as the shrine of Vishnu.  
  
Hope this helps,
