Dear Prof N.Paturi,

I read your posting " How to make sense----". I did not understand. On the top line was the name of American University. Is this your paper (research) or you are bringing to our attention work of somebody else? Anyway it is very puzzling. I will appreciate if you could post couple of lines of explanation. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
