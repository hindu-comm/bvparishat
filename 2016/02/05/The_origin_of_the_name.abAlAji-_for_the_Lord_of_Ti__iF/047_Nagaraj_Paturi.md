Dear Dr BVK Sastryji,



The term 'word-osmosis' seems to be your coinage. You probably mean by thisborrowing of words across languages.



One of your questions was :



What was the perceived linguistic and grammar based relation of
\<Tadbhava-Tatsama> word –formation and word- conversion rules between Sanskrit and regional languages like Tamil –Telugu- Kannada ? And same for word borrowings across these regional languages ? Do we have an INDIAN – INDIGENOUS –LANGAUGE GRAMMAR WORKS / Lexicons based study ?



Answer: That the words such as tatsama, tadbhava and des'ya were coined and used in traditional/pre-modern regional language grammars itself shows the awareness of the grammarians composing these grammars about there being a local core of the language, and borrowings from Sanskrit into that language withand without a phonetic change at the root level. (This awareness in the pre-modern grammarians is often overlooked by the modern linguists)



Most of these grammars have chapters on the rules of phonetic changes tatsamas (the Sanskrit words borrowed without a phonetic change at the root level) in that language undergo.



Tadbhavas (The Sanskrit and Prakrit words borrowed with a phonetic change at the level of the Sanskrit root borrowed) have also been called vikritis or vaikruta padas. Though the rules of phonetic change in these words have not been widelydiscussed in the traditional /pre-modern grammar books, there were works composed in pre-modern timesto focus on the vaikruta padas, discussing the phonetic change in these words.



The borrowings across south Indian languages were not specially identified or studied by pre-modern grammars of these languages, probably on account of the absence of the feeling of 'anya' towards such words.



Your question:

What footprints/ guidelines do we find in Tamil - Telugu – Kannada grammars in relation to word-osmosis and cross linking of regional languages used for Vishnu worship ?



Answer: There is no deity -wise or s'aivavaishNavaadi sampradaaya-wise focus in south Indian regional language grammars.Makes sense.



Your question: How much of \<Tamil-Telugu- Kannada- Sanskrit> word –osmosis is present in the compositions of great Vaishnava Saint Sri Tallapaka Annamacharya (1408-1503) ? Sri Purandara Dasa (1494-1564) ?



Answer: There is a significant amount of vocabularyborrowed from Tamil and some amount from Kannada in Annamacharya. There are modern research works on this. There must be works on similar lines on Purandara Dasa. 



Your question: What was the take of Sri Ramanujacharya in ubhaya Vedanta proposition /Sri Vedanta Deshika in his works on this issue ?



Answer: This issue is not discussed by either. Makes sense.



Contribution of Srivaishnava sampradaya towards regional languages is to accord significance equal to Vedic language to Tamil by creating the notion ofDravida Veda.



To bring the issue of greater significance to one of the south Indian languages vis-à-vis others, if intended by anyone,into this is misplaced.



Your main question:

As the word ‘Sri Venkata’ and ‘Balaji’ appears across almost all south Indian languages as a part of ‘Hari-Dasa-Sahitya’, and draws upon the explanation in puranas of early period, How may we explore the word-osmosis across south Indian languages stretched across a time line spanning almost 1400 years (approximately) ?



Answer: I am not sure of how old the use of the word Balaji is in the the Haridasa sahitya of south Indian languages. But certainly many words related to Tirumala shrine and the deity there are found in various south Indian language texts from several centuries. That certainly makes a useful and interesting study. (Part of it has already been covered in the previous research works. But more can be done.)



Your suggestion:

In view of this, probably the effort to identify the ‘Telugu and Kannada words’ in the given ‘Tamil Composition’ may be something worth exploring.



My response: Yes, study of borrowings across south Indian languages is an interesting study. Already linguists have covered great part of this issue. But there is a lot more to do.



Your observation:

This may also be helpful to understand a continuity of tradition and faith in Vishnu worship



My response:



You probably mean to say 'prevalence of the tradition across a wider area not limited to the Tamil speaking area. Yes,I agree.



Your observation:



and clear many ‘ inaccurate representations of Venkateswara Balaji as ‘ Deification of a Tribal mountain chief for worship / on the same model of ‘Subramanya’ in Tamil tradition’ (?!) .



My response:



Though I do not have a conclusive either in favour or against the idea of Sri Venkateswara having origins in a tribal deity, I would not feel it contradicting to the current 'Hindu' 'Puranic' 'Agamic' culture at all, if evidence in favour of that is found.



Let us all keep the following points about the study ofIndian culture in mind :



'Puranic' 'Agamic' culture which is today being labelled as 'Hindu' culture is not a pure Vedic culture and is a result of fusion of Vedic with folk or tribal cultures. Searching for pure Vedic roots and Vedic roots alone is largely due to a purely textualist approach of the European zealots of the colonial times.The other side of the debate to trace the roots of all that is 'Puranic' 'Agamic'to a single non-Vedic source such as Buddhist, Jain or folk or tribal is also exaggerated and reductionist. One single explanation used to explain all the available instances of 'Puranic' 'Agamic'does not work because the processes of amalgamation that resulted in the 'Puranic' 'Agamic'which is today being labelled as 'Hindu' cultureare highly variegated and complex. A patient, case by case, meticulous study alone can bring out the actual picture.



Thanks for asking for my comments.



Warm regards,



Nagaraj
