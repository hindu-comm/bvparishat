Respected Scholars,

  

In addition to what I wrote yesterday, I would like to add this:

  

There was a small museum in front of the Temple, It is now removed and an open space is created. In that museum a few archaeological pieces that were found on the Hills were displayed earlier. It was very interesting to find only Jain/Buddhist artifacts there. I saw a broken idols of Mahaveera, wooden sandals with nails (used by monks) long trumpets (these are used in Buddhist monasteries) etc. There was no important item which could be termed as distinctly *vaishnava* or *saiva* among the displayed items.Now a new big museum is constructed behind the temple. All those Jain items are missing from display. I don't know why.

  

Regarding certain terms used in TTD, the word *mirasidar* is interesting. It is an arabic word. Similarly, *peshkar, istekfal* (swagatam) *parakavani* (where money is segregated) etc are also persian.

  

Dhanyo'smi
