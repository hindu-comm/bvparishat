Vidwan Venkatesh Murthy might have said mentioned that ' in Tamil 'प' and 'ब' are the same and सी and जी are the same. This what I heard', just as part of his joke and he might very well be aware of the following. But I thought I should share the following for the benefit of those who seriously think that' in Tamil 'प' and 'ब' are the same and सी and जी are the same.'



1\. Part of the misunderstanding is because of looking at a language through its script (one of the side effects of literacy). Since the same script symbol ப்is used to representdifferent phones such as 'p', 'b', 'v' etc. in Tamil writing may give an impression that in

Tamil 'प' and 'ब' are the same etc.



2\. Tamil speakers clearly distinguish the phones (speech sound units) 'p', 'b', and 'v', for example. For example, 'b' is pronounced when the speech sound (represented by ப் ) follows a nasal 'm' (as in amba). When the samespeech sound (represented by ப் ) occurs between two vowels ( for example as in Go***p***alan ), itis pronounced as 'v' ( kōvālān ). In other circumstances, the samespeech sound (represented by ப் ) is pronounced as 'p' only. Thus 'b' of amba, 'v' of kōvālān and 'p'in other words are variants of one and the same the samespeech sound (represented by ப் ). The samespeech sound (represented by ப் ) is called 'phoneme' and 'b' of amba, 'v' of kōvālān and 'p'in other wordsare called allophones of each other. Similarly it can be shown that 'k' 'g' and 'h' are allophones to each otheri.e., variants of the same phoneme represented by 'க்' . Tamil script (as do most scripts ) is designed to represent phonemes.



3\. This pronunciation system, whichhas its own rationality and system, may influence and interfere with the Tamil speaker's pronunciation of languages with other systems of pronunciation. This mother tongue interference is common for all people learning a second language. A careful second language learner tries to reduce this influence as much as possible. Similarly, many Tamil speakers take care to pronounce Sanskrit, English and other languages as required by the respective language systems only.



4\. In borrowings, the borrowed word undergoes the phonetic changeto adapt the borrowed speech sounds to the system of the borrowing language. When Sanskrit words borrowed into various Indian languages undergo such a phonetic change,such borrowings are called 'tadbhavas'. Tamil has a tendency of a greater ratio of tadbhavas. That should not be construed as 'wrong' or 'inefficient' pronunciation by Tamil speakers. Attributing this 'wrong' or 'inefficiency' to its 'poor' script is even greater blunder. Noscript is poor in representingthe language for which it is meant. No script can be efficient in represent the speech sounds of a language for which it is not meant.
