I argued in my paper,



"“ It is traditional to do the other tradition” in Studies in Indian folk Culture, 191-202, MLK Murthy et al., (ed), Center for Folk Culture Studies, University of Hyderabad. 2004",



that this tendency in the Indian society to be aware that each one of others take a different meaning than the one taken by himself/herself for the same 'text' (including visual representations such as graphic and plastic art works ) and to allow such meanings to be taken by others is similar to what the post-modern thinkers beginning with Jacques Derrida propose as a path breaking new awareness to be held by literary critics and other intellectuals of the post-modern times.
