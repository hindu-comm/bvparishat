Dear Prof Nagaraj,  
  
I used 'daresay' because I could not be sure when Sanskrit names of deities became more popular than the earlier prevalent Tamil names. General histories of temples in Tamilnadu (like KV Raman's *SriVaradarajaswami Temple* (p. 6-7) favor Vijayanagara period as the time when the Sanskrit names of deities became rather popular.  
  
In the case of personal names based on these deities, it is clear from inscriptions that at least till the mid 14th century, names like āṭavallāṉ and ampalakūttāṭuvāṉ were more popular than 'Natarajan' , similarly names like aruḷāḷaṉ, pēraruḷāḷaṉ (instead of Varadarajan), tiruvēṅkaṭattāṉ (instead of venkatesan or Srinivasan) were more to be seen in the names of grantees of royal favors.  
  
btw, Nammaḻvār's tiruvāymoḻi (ca. 9th century) offers a play on words with the name 'venkatam' . The phrase 'vēm kaṭaṅkaḷ' - meaning 'karma will burn' - by sandhi becomes vēṅkaṭaṅkaḷ'. See below  
  
 vēṅkaṭaṅkaḷ meymmēl viṉai muṛṛavum  
 tāṅkaḷ taṅkaṭku nallaṉavē ceyvār  
 vēṅkaṭattu uṛaivārkku namaveṉṉa  
 lām kaṭamai atu cumantārkaṭkē  
  

வேங்க டங்கள்மெய்ம் மேல்வினை முற்றவும்,

தாங்கள் தங்கட்கு நல்லன வேசெய்வார்,

வேங்க டத்துறை வார்க்கு நமவென்ன

லாங்க டமை,அதுசுமந் தார்க்கட்கே. (3148)  

  
Here the phrase 'kaṭaṅkaḷ mēlviṉai muṛṛavum vēm' means 'existing karma, the karma which is yet to accrue and all other sins will burn' . The
occurrence of 'venkatam' in the third line refers to the place Venkatam i.e., tirumala.  
  
Hope this helps
