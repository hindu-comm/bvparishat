\> Since yesterday I have been sifting through this Tamil verse to discover at least one Sanskrit word from it. I have failed to recognize even one except the proper name "venkata".



\> Please enlighten me if any Sanskrit word has undergone *tadbhava*metamorphosis that rendered it beyond recognition







------- mēkam \< mēgha



 caṅkam \< śankha



 tāna \< snāna ?



origin of vēṅkaṭa is not clear.



adikāram \< adhikāram



kāṇḍam is also a Sanskrit word only.
