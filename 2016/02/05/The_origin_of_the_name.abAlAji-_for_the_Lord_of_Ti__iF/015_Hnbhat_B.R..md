I agree with जी is honorific name, but रामा and बाला are not vocative jn Sanskrit.

Totally it is a pet name popular in Andhra for like Venkatesha and the etymology is differently offerred and for Balaji is not given in Sanskrit dictionaries.  

Probably both have little to do with Sanskrit etymology and Sanskritized Telugu names. The same bogspot remarks "balaji" is mostly recent name. In Kannada, he is called तिम्मप्प. On the same line balaji means Lord of Lakshmi as the blogger gives.
