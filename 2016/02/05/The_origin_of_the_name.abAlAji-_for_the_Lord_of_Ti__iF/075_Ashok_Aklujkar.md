Would taking “bāla” in the sense of ‘young’ (with possible implication of ’strength, energy’, perhaps even 'effectiveness’) not take care of all the usages that have so far been noted? (The lengthening of the final “a” would be analogical as in “Śivājī” etc.; the word is not like an old Skt word and has a Pkt/Deśī element in any case.)
