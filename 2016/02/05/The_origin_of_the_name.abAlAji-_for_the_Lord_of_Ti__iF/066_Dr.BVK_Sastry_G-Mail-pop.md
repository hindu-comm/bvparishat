Namaste Johsi ji



On \< How can we say their Dashi words do not fetch Dharma? > Any word of any language will deliver \< Dharma / Punya / Siddhi \> when used as a ‘Mantra’. This is what the story of Ratnakara repeating the word ‘rama’ in reverse’ becoming a Sage Valmiki, writing Ramayana.



The ‘Mantra’ mode upgrade for a ‘deshi language’ word is delivered by Saints through an initiation. The deshi language users continue to use the word in ‘Deshi’ mode’ with a ‘ belief’ that they are using it in ‘ mantra-mode’.



To upgrade a ‘deshi language’ ( = Prakrutam, Apabhramsha) to a ‘ mantra –mode usage’, one needs to know the deep intricacies of ‘ Vak-yoga + Mantra yoga + Allied disciplines of Veda and Vedanga + Tantra’. This is the ‘ (Yoga) missing language link of Samskrutham to Prakrutham( =Deshi language). Vak-Yoga is the another name of Samskrutham, the language of Vedic documents and Shaastras, for understanding which we have the language tradition given by the trio -
Panini-Patanjali-Yaska, followed by Indian traditionalists and practitioners. The Harvard –schools follow a different approach from this.
