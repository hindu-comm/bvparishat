Namaste,  
  
Very hilarious comparison....especially with bagalamukhi.  
  
First of all, that book is not considered to be authentic even though published by the Samsthan of Pithapuram. All sorts of hypothetical and fancy stories are there in the book.  
  
As far as guru-charitra is concerned, the authentic one was written in kannada by Saraswathi Gangadhara which was later translated into sanskrit by Paramahamsa Parivraja Sri.Vasudevananda Saraswathi Ji (alias Tembe Maharaj).  
  
That said, the surnames of telugu smaartha families bearing "malladi" and "sripada" are the descendants of Sripada Srivallabha. Other than this, authentic information cannot be found.  
  
regs,  
sriram
