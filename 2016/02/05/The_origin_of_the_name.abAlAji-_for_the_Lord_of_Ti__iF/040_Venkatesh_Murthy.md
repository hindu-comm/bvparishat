I agree with you, sir. Even Sanskrit does not have the two 'e' and 'E' ए ऎ and two 'o' and 'O' ओ ऒ sounds. These are very much there in South Indian languages. That is why some people from Maharashtra and other states say 'pen' like 'pain' and 'test' like 'taste'. There are some jokes here also. One person was conducting tests and interviewsfor telephone operator job. He said tothe interviewer. 'I have tested all these girls. Now you test them.' But it sounded like 'I have tasted allthese girls. Now you taste them'.
