बल (= वल) can be said to be the root word. By applying different vowels and semivowels we get all other instances(including yavanawords such as vale, valley,wall, ball, bull,etc etc).

  

One of Indra's enemies is known as वल (also बल). वल, just like वृत्र, is a power of असत् that encompasses, encircles, and isolatesrealms. Since Vedika words are self-referencing, and original, the purest meaning of वल is this: circle, or something circled. An immediate example: वलय.

  

The next purest instance I can think of is the vel of vel-murukan. This vel is mystically understood to be the piercer of the barrier (here, वल). From here we can seeबल also getting itsmeaning:manly power, or even the male organ. So we have बैल etc.

  

In my view, therefore, in the North-West of India (or probably in Marashtra itself) we had the word mutation of वल as वल and बल (e.g. in Punjabi: वल्ले-वल्ले and बल्ले-बल्ले) and there onwards it spread to IE worlds. However, before the mutation, the word had its origin in the South as वेल. The second point, no doubt, needs adeeper look (finding related Southernwords).
