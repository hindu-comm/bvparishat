Respected Fellow Venkatesvara Bhaktas,

  

I would like to add one more hilarious quip for healthy fun. When asked for the vyutpatti of venkaTayya, it was explained like this: bhaktula ventrukalu cut chese vadu. One who cuts the ventrukalu (hair of devotees).

  

Regards,

  

Ramchander Deekonda
