1\. The shaving the head at such shrines has several aspects involved: one most important of them being the folk cultural practice of 'removal of inborn hair' ('puTTu venTrukalu teeyaDam'' in Telugu, there must be equivalents in otherIndian languages ) at the shrine of the family deity.



2\. Another folk cultural practice of shaving the head as a vow of 'hard to do' activity given in return to the deity for showering blessings/ favour (principle of worldview involved likely being: lose something to get something, transfer the hardship-1 bestowed by fate/ nature on you to some other hardship-2 to get relief from the hardship-1)



3\. Vedic/Brahmanical idea of removing hair as leading to/symbolic of removing papa.



Going beyond pure textual understanding of culture can help understand more such nuances.
