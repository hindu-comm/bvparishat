As always, aadaraNiya Nityanandji brought the most useful addition.



bAlA from vallabha is highly useful in this context.



Though Hathiram Babaji's Rajasthan connection might just provide us a clue that the usage has Rajasthani origin, Balaji for variousHanumans is lessuseful in this context than bAlA from vallabha.



Vallabha moved from ‘dear’ or ‘beloved’ to 'husband' and then to 'husband of land' and thus to'king' or 'lord' too.



bAlA from vallabha in the sense of 'lord' is very much apt here.
