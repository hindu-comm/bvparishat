Dear all

Balaji refers to the deity with Baala that is puccha.

Mehandipur Balaji etc. are the purely hanuman temples. I have visited it. salasar balaji etc. there are thousands of balaji in north India.

  

but that name was assigned to venkateshvara is somehow difficult to explain.

  

Perhaps it is the contribution Hathiram Matha to Venkateshvara. According to TTD History the shrine was given to Hathi ram matha by british administration sometimes in 1833 or so. Mahants administered it for long time. then TTD was founded.

  

They might have used this balaji name for lord.
