Dear scholars,



The name *Bālājī* for Lord Hanumān is largely confined to Rajasthan, and is not as popular outside of Rajasthan. Pandurangi Ji’s statement that there are thousands of Bālājī-s in north India likely refers to Bālājī temples in Rajasthan.



I would ignore what \[the current version of\] Wikipedia has to say as it is an unreliable source. Several authors have proposed etymologies for the name *Bālājī*. Among them is Lutgendorf (Hanuman’s Tale: The Messages of a Divine Monkey, 2006, New York: OUP, ISBN 9780199885824, p. 33) who like some others links the name to Sanskrit *bāla/bālā* meaning baby or infant:

Quote

“Yet this immortal warrior, protector, and healer also remains, for many of his worshipers, quintessentially a beloved child, and so at one of the most renowned of his healing shrines, he bears the affectionate epithet of Balaji (Bālājī, ‘‘the \[divine\] babe’’), a name that has also achieved wide currency.”

Unquote

However, this proposed etymology is problematic since one of the most famous Bālājī-s, the Salasar Balaji, sports a moustache and beard, features which are not found in an infant or a child. Even the Mehandipur Balaji does not have distinguishing features to say that the deity is a child or infant.



The proposed linkage with the Sanskrit word *bāla*/*vāla* meaning tail (or hair on tail) is also problematic for two reasons. One, it is not just the tail or hair on tail that is called Bālājī but Lord Hanumān himself: the sense of *matup* is missing from the word as it stands. Two, the word *bāla*/*bālā* is not used for tail (or hair on tail) in Rajasthani or Hindi (even though the meaning exists in Sanskrit).



Given the populartiy of the name Bālājī in Rajasthan, the words *Bālājī/bālā* as used in the Rajasthani languages can offer insights. In the second part of the third volume of his magnum opus Rājasthānī Sabada Kosa: Rājasthānī Hindī Bṛhat Kośa, Sitārāma Lālasa gives the meaning Hanumān for the word *Bālājī*. The derivation given by Nityānanda Śāstrī Dādhīca is from the Sanskrit word *vallabha* (वल्लभ) which means ‘dear’ or ‘beloved’. In the second part of the fourth volume of the same work, under the word *vālā* (वाला) its other forms बाला, बाल्हा, and वाल्हा are listed.



There are many attested uses of the word बाला in the sense of ‘dear’ or ‘beloved’ in Rajasthani works. In several of her compositions, Mirabai has used the word in this very sense. A few examples of her common refrain रे बाला:

1) जै हूँ ऐसी जानती रे बाला प्रती कीयाँ दुष होय

2) औषध मूल न संचरै रे बाला बैद फिरि जाय

3) माला मुदरा मेखला रे बाला खप्पर लूँगी हाथ

A famous use of the word बाला by Mirabai is in the composition

बाला मैं बैरागण हूंगी

which has been rendered by many classical and popular vocalists including Vani Jairam and Asha Bhonsle.



Given this crucial evidence from the Rājasthānī Sabada Kosa and the attested use of the word बाला in the sense of dear or beloved in Rajasthani, my conclusion is that the epithet Bālājī used for Lord Hanumān in Rajasthan literally means "the dear/beloved \[god\]" and derives from the Sanskrit word *vallabha*.

  

Thanks, Nityanand



PS: It appears the Gujarati word વ્હાલા is related to Rajasthani बाला/बाल्हा/वाल्हा, though I have not cross-verified this.



PPS: In a footnote on page 33 in Hanuman’s Tale, Lutgendorf observes:

Although most Hindus do not conflate the two deities, a poster that I saw in two places in North India in January 2006 depicts a ‘‘Balaji trimurti’’ (trimūrti, ‘‘triple image’’), in which the faces of Venkateshwara and of Balaji-Hanuman of Menhdipur, Rajasthan, appear flanking that of Balaji-Hanuman of Salasar.
