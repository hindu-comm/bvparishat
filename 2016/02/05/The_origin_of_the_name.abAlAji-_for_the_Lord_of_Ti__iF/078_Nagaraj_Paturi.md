1\. What is the source of this stotra? Is it used in the main shrine? Is bilvaarchana done at the main shrine? Need for explanation depends on that.



2\. Let us all remember that general 'Hinduism'in its majority is non-sectarian (to use an insider word not bound by any ekadevataapaaramya drishTi). That is the reason why a general 'Hindu' devotee does not react with intrigue when a certain deity is described to have features of other gods than the one which it is mainly thought of representing. It is only a. those who enjoy reviving the obsolete sectarianisms b. modern researchers interested in 'historical' facts who get intrigued by such pieces of information.



3\. As a person bitten by the bug of modern academics, I would also be interested in 'explanations' for these 'intriguing' pieces. But the same modern academics includes my field cultural anthropology which taught me to note that my findings hardly affect the view of the general 'Hindu' who takes such admixtures as commonplace.
