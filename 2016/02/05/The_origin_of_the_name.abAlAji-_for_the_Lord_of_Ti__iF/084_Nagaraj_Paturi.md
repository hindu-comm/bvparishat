Sharing an archiving of my posts in an email list on the relation between Vishnu Shiva and Devi and as a matter of course Brahma Sarasvati and Lakshmi from conceptual, historical, archaeological and anthropological perspectives.

  

Issues such as Shiva and Vishnu meditating on each other are also covered without resorting to (Advaita) Vedanta.

  

Hope turns out useful in thinking of some of the issues in the thread.
