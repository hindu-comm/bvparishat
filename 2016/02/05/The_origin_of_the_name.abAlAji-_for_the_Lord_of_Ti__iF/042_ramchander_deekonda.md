Respected Sureshji,

  

Digressing a little from the core subject, I would like to know whether there is any Sanskrit word in the Tamil verse quoted by you here. Since yesterday I have been sifting through this Tamil verse to discover at least one Sanskrit word from it. I have failed to recognize even one except the proper name "venkata". Please enlighten me if any Sanskrit word has undergone *tadbhava*metamorphosis that rendered it beyond recognition. As you know our Telugu language, specially literary (and even colloquial) is influenced by Sanskrit so much so that at times 90% Sanskrit words are found in compositions. I wonder if anything worth reading can be written in Telugu, without Sanskrit words. Please help me. Forgive me for taking this liberty.

  

Regards,

  

Ramchander Deekonda
