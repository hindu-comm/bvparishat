\> I discussed here on BVP that Sanskrit Mantra shastra does not work



You might want to say I expressed my opinion on BVP that Sanskrit Mantra shastra does not work.



\> Mantras in ancient Yajnas where animal sacrifice was performed did not produce any effects.



Unless you have a time machine, you can not say confidently whether something did or did not produce effects in the ancient times.



\> Mantra shastra is our comforting blanket like a baby has a blanket and soft toy to feel secure. Indian civilization over thousands of years' period developed many comforting blankets. Mantra shastra is one of them.



Knowledge systems/ beliefsinvolving manipulation of the 'supernatural'being brushed asideis not new. Particularly during modern period, this tendency is on increase.



But such knowledge systems/ beliefsare not unique to Indian civilization.



Simile / analogyof blanket and soft toy might not have communicated your idea properly. Because you probablywanted to say that mantras do not give the effect its user thinks they give. But blanket gives the effect of warmth the baby thinks it gives. Soft toy gives the effect of feeling of security the baby wants from it.



Uniqueness of Indian knowledge systems is that it developed a theory from out of an insider's understanding of these belief systems that prevail inmany parts of the world.



Only that theory can be discussed in email lists or journal publications.



These are not suitable venues for practicals.



That is why it is better to avoid discussions on practical efficacy of such systems here.



Theory of it can not be avoided from discussion.



Claims of efficacy and challenges to prove the efficacy both do not suit to forums such as this.
