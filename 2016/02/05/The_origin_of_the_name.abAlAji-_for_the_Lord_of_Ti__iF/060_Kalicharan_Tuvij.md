This specificallyconfirms my earlier statement regarding बाला being a vocative.

बाला, I agree, means "male lover" when used in vocative. However, when followed by the honorific जी, due to archaic features, the word बालाजी results in the meaning: male deity. (or, पुंदेवता, as pointed out by Vidvan Jagannatha S)

  

The meaning पुंदेवता alone is a common thread or themerunning through hanuman, surya, and vishnu temples found across the breadth of Bharata.
