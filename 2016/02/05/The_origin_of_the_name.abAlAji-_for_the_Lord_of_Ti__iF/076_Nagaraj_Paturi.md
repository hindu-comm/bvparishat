बालाजी is an अपशब्द from the point of view of पाणिनीयम् ।

  

Any शब्द / संज्ञा made of देशभाषा is not a साधुशब्द , i e does not fetch धर्म ।




-------- Prof. Subrahmanyam Korada







The entire thread has been running taking it for granted that the word बालाजी is not a Sanskrit word, but some north Indian language word only. It is also known to all that a non-Sanskrit word is asaadhu *in Sanskrit*. I don't think all the common people who use the word use it with the belief that it has the 'power' ( though they can not articulate it as power of giving Dharma ). I never even heard the formulaic expressions such as Sri .............. namah , including the word Balaji in it.



The thread was not focussing on Saadhutva vichaarah at all.



The focus was on the etymology of the word.



Given that focus, there was a highly fruitful discussion in the thread.
