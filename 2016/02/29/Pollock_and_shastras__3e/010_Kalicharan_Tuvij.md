Nonetheless, I think Pollock's contribution, coming from a relative outside, isn't trivial. Indic knowledge systems did collapse - into vegetative states - arguably a little over two thousands of years ago, and remain crippled till date, manifesting in virtually all domains of activities within country. Recently I had raised this point in a BVP thread (where I avoided the pitfall of sweeping generalisation about a whole history and civilisation).  
  
The collapse of Indic systems (comprehensively, during 0-1000 A.D., further leading to inevitable consequences in 1000 A.D.+) had more to do with talent deficit (associated with debilitating effects of being - for far too long - on the wrong side of "natural selection" of sorts), than with wily Brahmins colluding with deviant Kshatriya-s (and being "always like this" ever since the Big-bang of universe - or पुरुष सुक्त according to some).  
  
Human migrations (in or out is besides the point) form a significant bulk of Indian history, and despite शास्त्रिय injunctions proscribing "crossing of seas", have continued - rather, resumed within IE - to result in the loss of high net-worth/ high-investment individuals.  
  
The modes of migrations have no doubt changed significantly, yet the earliest modes (pre 1500 B.C.) might still be in some ways shaping the overall characteristics of the later ones. This is important to note, as again, without going into the question of AMT/ OIT (migrations, if need be, being thought of as relative separation).  
  
"What characteristics?" is an important question to ask, if at all we are to address the following:  
  
A) What is the nature of (eerily persistent) engagement of the West with Indic knowledge systems? For example, why doesn't the funding stop once a Doniger or a Pollock - or dozens before them - arrive at their "definite" conclusions?  
  
B) How does वेद see the Western people and its constructs? How does it see भारत itself? (there is an ongoing thread on the latter).  
  
How do we know that the answers provided to these are free from the debilitating filters - that I talked about - we've grown accustomed to for the past \~2000 years?  
  
Either the वैदिक universalism will subsume under itself the Western universalism, or the vice-versa; the bigger universe gobbling up the smaller universe, and I don't see this play ending in a tie. Though a vast majority of Western Indologists presume their roles as that of the foot soldiers (in perhaps an inexplicably protracted war), the sustenance of Indology research itself on the part of the West - or the Western characteristic as a whole - comes from a far deeper reason.
