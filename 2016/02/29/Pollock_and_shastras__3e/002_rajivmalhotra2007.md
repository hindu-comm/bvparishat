Thanks Bijoy for a very profound observation. This debunks Pollock's basic claim in his famous paper that shastras lack freedom, lack personal lived experience of the author.  
  
After this paper, his subsequent work links this to political motives of the brahmin-kshatriya nexus. He says that Vedas' goal is to maintain social order (read caste hierarchy), which requires king to play a certain role for social hierarchy. Brahmins, in turn, serve to "divinize the king", giving him this "divine power" in the eyes of the public. Hence the brahmin-kshatriya nexus.  
  
"Political philology" is a term he uses all over his tome. This is not ordinary philology as commonly understood. In fact, he scolds earlier orientalists for being too romantic about Indian texts and traditions. It is this point where he breaks away from his teacher Ingalls who had espoused interpreting Ramayana, etc. using the lens of insiders.  
  
Once people have examined his ideas on shastras, it can lead deeper into purva-paksha of the "political philology" methodology.
