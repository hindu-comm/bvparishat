Dear Rajiv,

  

It is possible that the western "compilations" are individual-centric, and the

concept of "compilation" of a "collection of scholars" never developed.

Panini brings many grammarians into his text and never claims ownership

of anything. He is an analytic observer. I believe this technique makes a

definition of shastra. It is a concept of a well-edited modern handbook, that

can hold the test of time. Even in India we are so westernized now, that we

don't want to create collective compilations. I have not studied if a shastra

must conform to the Vedas. Panini did not care. He called the Vedas as

another branch!

  

I hope the Government funds scholars to research into the technique of the

creation of the shastras and the grandeur of shastra expressions. I am

reading Natyashastra lately. I am stunned with the precision of the expressions.

Bharata should be credited for the presentation, not the contents!

  

Coming to Valmiki, it is a singular work. He imagines, weaves the story.

He can make it look realistic, but he is not examining "facts" as displayed.

He might have been given a story line as claimed, but he is a great improviser.

To me this is the subtle difference between a shastra and a kavya. 

  

Best regards,

Bijoy
