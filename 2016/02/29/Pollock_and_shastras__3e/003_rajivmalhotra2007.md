I am bringing this post here by Kalicharan Tuvij. It belongs in this thread, because this thread was set up specifically to discuss the paper being referenced..

Kalicharan Tuvij responded: 'The irony here is the manner in which Pollock uses the word "regressive". He means "unprogressive" by it, but had he used the word in the sense I used, he would've corrected his own mistake.'  
  
*My take*: "Progress" is a loaded Western term with built in assumptions about a metaphysics of "progress". It is undesirable for us to accept the implicit Western Universalism. The western idea of "progress" is not neutral; it is assigned positive values. Are we to assume that these values apply in the evaluation of Indian texts?  
  
The problem is a serious one in translations - when the terms of reference and contexts are supplied from elsewhere.
