Namaste,  
  

In spite of the western scholars trying to master the ancient Indian texts they seem to have not been able to grasp the meaning of the Hindu shastras. The Vayu purana tells us that all the Shatras were collectively known as Yajurveda, prior to the classification carried out by Vedavyasa with the help of his four main disciples. I hope the interested scholars would be able to find out that reference. After the classification, there came to be the four Vedas, the Upavedas, the Vedangas, the Puranas and the Upa-puranas etc. It is also believed that Atharva Veda portion was given the Vedic status, due to the efforts of Rishi Atharvana, and that was sometime after the first three Vedas were compiled. That whole gamut of texts encompassed all the divine knowledge, revealed (discovered through meditation) as well as conveyed down from the gurus to the disciples. Vedavyasa later on stated that he attempted to include all that was essentially there in the Vedic texts in the Mahabharata, so that the laypersons should be able to have access to the Vedic knowledge. The western scholars are simple unable to accept the concept and the merits of the shastras as we Hindus see them.  
  

Secondly, the western scholars have also not been able to understand what is truly meant by a brahmin. They simply do not understand the gun-karma vibhaga, by which the brahmins are scholars, teachers and researchers and they had to acquire and excel in all branches of knowledge so that they would be able to become able teachers. The Kshatriyas were also allowed to learn all that but there were general
restrictions on their becoming Vedic teachers, though there were some occasional exceptions where brahmins also approached Kshatriya for knowledge in some areas. The brahmins were living austere life ans were generally poor, so much so that Bhrigu is said to have prayed to his daughter Lakshmi to suggest ways so that the poor brahmin householders
can make their both ends meet. The brahmins did not have any servants whereas the Kshatriyas and the Vaishyas had all the powers and money also could employ the shudras (the non-skilled and semi-skilled people) as their assistants.  
  

Thus the western scholars are naturally handicapped in knowing about the the Hindu Shastras and this will remain so unless and until they try to accept things the way the Hindus do. Further, beacuse of their lack of knowledge about the brahmins, they would continue to join the anti-brahmin brigade.
