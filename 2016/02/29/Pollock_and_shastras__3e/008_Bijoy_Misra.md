I do not know of the traditional schools. I would define as follows:

  

shastra - that which teaches, that can be taught in a classroom, the derived knowledge may have experience value (physical). It plays on the brain.

       it is empirical, would affect all.

  

kavya - that has rasa to be enjoyed. It narrates and creates imagination. It plays on the mind. It affects through one's guNa, (non-uniform).

  

PS. rasa can create bhAva and can affect the brain, then it creates emotion. (we did the paper for Bangkok WSC)

  

The west does not have a theory for the mind and most researchers get confused by searching the mind in the brain.

  

Indian theory of mind ends in Sankhya. The latter is limited, so it is a darshana, not a shastra.

  

Yoga has shastra in it, but difficult to realize. So it has to be only taught selectively, for others it is darshana.

  

These are my thinking. I am not traditionally trained though come from Puri!
