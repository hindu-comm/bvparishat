Namaste

  

**Question**: Do we have a clarity and concurrenceon what the two words - Shaastra and Kavya mean in traditional schools ? for the purpose of this debate? Can we look beyond the 'obvious' and ' literal string translations'?

  

**Why this question ?** The two words 'Shaastra' and 'Kavya' have multiple meanings and are 'non-translatable' , to use RM's expression.

  

Within tradition, Srimad Valmiki Ramayana is a ' Kavya' and it is used as authority in 'Vedanta Shaastra' deliberations.

Mahabharata is an ' itihasa (kavya) and has within it Srimad Bhagavad-Gita, the Yoga-Shaastra embedded.

Gita, the poetic dialogue and discourse,at (18-24) declares that 'Shaastra' is the authority to guide and decide right action'( **tasmAt shAstram pramAnam** te kAryAkAryavyavasthitau;. JnAtvA shAstravidhAnoktam karma kartumihArhasi.)

Bhartas treatise on Poetics (Kavya/ Rupaka/ Natya ) is called ' Natya-Shaastra.

There are 'Shaastra-Kaavyas' and ' Kavya-Shaastras'.

  

This shows that the disciplines ,techniqueand methodology of Kavya and Shastrawere clear, well developed and used in Samskruth language in Ancient India, way before Aristotle ! In this sense, it is necessary to identify the position of traditional schoolsin understanding the scope and operation of these two words, pointing to specific disciplineswhich areintertwinedand in-connected. A poorvapaksha to Pollock can result effectively, only when the 'Siddhanta' of traditional school is comprehended clearly. 

  

When theposts here bring inSamskruth words 'Kavya' and -'Shaastra'
and how Sheldon Pollocks views are way off from the understanding held in tradition, deviatefrom the usage history, it is necessary to make the bench mark of what traditional schools understand by these words.

  

Dr. Bijoy Mishra has expressed the pious wish \< I hope the Government funds scholars to research into the technique of the creation of the shastras and the grandeur of shastra expressions \>. And follows it up with the observation

\< My point is, it takes time to build knowledge and to think worthwhile to compile. A Shastra might form when new information becomes redundant. People should be encouraged to create good mathematical models to check when empirical knowledge in a field may become redundant. By the way, there is no shastra on the earth or the universe, but only relative positions in Jyotisha. Relative positions could change in unimaginable galactic time scale. A shastra does not freeze, it educates by assembling what's known such that one is encouraged to discover new!> .

  

It may be interesting to explore why beyond-India institutions and agencies are funding Samskruth -Shaastra-research under the veil of academics ? What is there in Samskruth -Shaastra -study which attractsfunds for research, when the native scholarsfind it difficult to makea good living ? find studentsto receive the knowledge of traditional disciplines? And why was 'Jyotish' taught as a 'Shaastra in Samskruth andpositioned subservient to Vedas' ? where as it has now endedto be an' eye sore -sooth saying discipline' in the eyes of scientists ? 

  

Things to ponder;

  

I look forward for scholars ' relative positions' in responding to these issues'.
