Since my book has a critique of Pollock's views on shastras, I was recently asked to explain it. There are100s of red flags/issues discussed in my book, and I am taking this one as the first topic to focus on debating. I am *attaching an excerpt* from my book in which I argue that early in his career Pollock develops a certain clear position on shastras. Scholars have not studied this work of his adequately in my opinion. I am referring to his 1985 paper available at: [http://documents.mx/documents/ theory-of-practice-on- shastras.html](http://documents.mx/documents/theory-of-practice-on-shastras.html). It is also found at <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/h42rer2ys7xdyla/AADfxgwPIj5sBiJ7UO-Yq7N7a?dl=0>  
  
My attached analysis of Pollock claims that the following are his views found in this work and other works that developed from it:  

1.  Shastras cannot deviate from Vedas. This makes them incapable of
    new, creative, progressive ideas. In effect, shastras largely rehash
    whats in the Vedas - nothing new happens in them. 2.  The tradition does not (unlike in the west) utilize practical
    experience/empiricism of scholars - i.e. lack of agency.  
3.  He mentions in passing that certain "advances" did take place in
    some disciplines, but that these were attributed to supernatural
    agency and not human agency. 4.  Hence, 1 - 3 along with his other writings make clear that the
    shastras are frozen, i.e. limited creativity possible. 5.  In fact, his main thesis is: that only kavya (which he elsewhere
    argues is separate/in tension with shastras) is the only place where
    history gets made. This implies that shastras did not make
    historical impact. (My concern: Are we to set aside all the history
    of Indian science/technology as useless?) 6.  Though in this paper he only partially sets up the case for
    political philology as the correct lens for interpreting Sanskrit
    texts, this notion comes in full swing in his later writings. 7.  #6 leads to his major thrust that Sanskrit and its texts must be
    processed for developing political insights into oppression in
    Indian society. In other words, his approach is largely shaped by
    this motive to seek political hegemony, domination, social
    oppression. My book gives extensive examples of Pollock making this
    case very centrally.

My book praises him on many counts, while at the same time strongly criticizing on a specific list of positions. My hope is to expand the discourse by bringing in traditional voices who have thus far been aloof or left out. This lack of purva and uttara paksha (and preponderance of praise) has created an imbalance we must address. In a couple of days I hope to to write a more complete analysis of the matter of shastras.
