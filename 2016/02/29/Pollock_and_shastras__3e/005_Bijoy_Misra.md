Rajiv,

  

The closest analogy to shastra in the west in my view would be Aristotle, as long as

he is confined to his field studies. When he starts speculating, he goes into the kavya

mode. In shastra there is no wishful thinking, a description of "what exists!"

This "sat" is physical existence. It is empirical, not philosophic or analytic! 

  

On a lighter note, I was told of arthritis (it was a fluke!) forty years ago by a MIT physician. 

I procured a copy of Grey's Anatomy. This was the first shastra I ever saw. The compilation

was massive, purely to educate. Twenty years ago, I helped build the High Resolution Brain

Atlas for a mouse brain. A shastra on the human brain could be several hundred years away. 

  

My point is, it takes time to build knowledge and to think worthwhile to compile. A shastra

might form when new information becomes redundant. People should be encouraged to

create good mathematical models to check when empirical knowledge in a field may become

redundant. By the way, there is no shastra on the earth or the universe, but only relative

positions in Jyotisha. Relative positions could change in unimaginable galactic time scale.

  

A shastra does not freeze, it educates by assembling what's known such that one is encouraged

to discover new! Chandashastra did help produce raga music!
