Rajiv: Yes he is big enough to get attention, because:  

1.  He is editor-in-chief of 500 volumes to be translated under Murthy
    funding, which is 10 times what Max Mueller did. Was Max Mueller
    trivial? Was it wise (or arrogant) on the part of traditional
    sanskritists to have ignored him? What does hindsight teach us? 2.  Had it not been for my intervention, he would already be starting
    the Sringeri chairs at Columbia described in my book's Introduction.
    After that chair (which would in effect become the official
    mouthpiece of Sringeri internationally), similar chairs were being
    planned in US Ivy leagues to represent other traditional mutts.
    Where would such a trajectory lead us - a complete hijacking of our
    tradition, or a complete sellout by those who feel the US Ivy
    Leagues are superior custodians? 3.  Please dont fall prey to the same laziness that has plagued our
    traditional scholars for past few centuries, when they cited lofty
    reasons to fail to do purva paksha of top tier opponents. 4.  Please read chapter 10 of my book that lists Pollock's power base in
    India and beyond. Do not trivialize your opponent. Invest in hard
    work to do more and more purva/uttara paksha. 5.  The problem is not with Pollock. It is with our own scholars'
    combination of: incompetence, laziness, loftiness, or plain being
    sold out or hoping to be bought off one day.  

thank you.

regards,

rajiv
