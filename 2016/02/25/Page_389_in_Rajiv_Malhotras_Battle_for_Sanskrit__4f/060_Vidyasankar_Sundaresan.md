Let me, as an amateur on this list of vidvAn-s, take a moment to firmly second what Prof. Aklujkar says. "... one of the main reasons why Sanskrit is in such a precarious position at present is the aloofness of traditional scholars from what is happening around them."  
  
It is high time the community of Indian scholars looked outside their comfort zone. This forum itself may not be a place for discussing political angles, but there has got to be a place in our thinking for the impact of the political on that which is scholarly. Else, we sit around helpless, handing over our agency to those who would wrest it from us.  
  
The kUpa-maNDUka attitude should not prevail, while the ground is shifting and the groundwater is vanishing, making the kUpa run inexorably dry.

  
Best regards,

Vidyasankar
