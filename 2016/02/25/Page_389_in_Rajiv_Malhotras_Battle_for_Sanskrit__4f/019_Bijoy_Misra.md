Sunilji,

Thank you for posting. Here is the second part of the third sentence:

"How does the tradition view the relationship of a given śāstra to its object; what are the implications of this view for the concept of cultural change; is there some traditional presupposition, or justification, for the previous two notions."  

There is an inbuilt assumption that the "shastra" is expected to create "cultural change" on the "tradition".

This assumption is based on another assumption that "political elements" like "the kings" or "the Brahmins" commission these texts to cause such influence.

Having made these assumptions, he would proceed to "prove" them through sketchy readings.

Analytic literature in Indology is in real poor state. I am new to these readings, but these broad generalizations without enough qualifiers disturb me.

It is possible that it is a novice science, but we are in the twenty first century! Objective statements are required.

I will read more, but the writings are loaded with unfounded assumptions. The students in the field might have been seasoned with these, since it

has been active for decades. Rather unfortunate!

Bijoy Misra
