Dear Prof. Paturi,

  

In my mind, learning about the past of Prof. Ingalls with the OSS was nothing short of fascinating. It was a very different time, a very different world and I find nothing really wrong with it. To see that he completed his doctoral dissertation in parallel, while working undercover in Kabul, which was then lost and rewritten as a book, all this adds immense color to his distinguished career in Indology!

  

Indeed, it seems to me that this year spent under trying circumstances may have actually contributed towards the sensitivity that he displays in his writings on India. One doesn't have to suspect that he had malafide intentions towards the newly independent India that was gestating at the time.

  

Unfortunately, I cannot assert the same thing confidently about the intentions of some contemporary Indologists towards the 69 year old independent India! After all, doesn't much of the acrimony today really emanate from the unwarranted incursions of European and American Indologists into contemporary Indian public life, presuming that they know better than the judges in Indian courts and scholars in Indian educational institutions?!!

  

Best regards,

Vidyasankar
