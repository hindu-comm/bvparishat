I should have added this in my previous post.

All shastra as I see are "compilations" to "document" the existing

knowledge, empirical or scientific that was in practice at the given time.

They are not philosophical or political documents. They have lived

because they have represented their sources properly, possibly through examination.

Hence there is no purport of any perceived "cultural change".

If any effect took place, they were all positive. Bharatanatyam is still played today.

Shastra created संज्ञा for the concepts. One can create new material,

but can't use the same संज्ञा for it. New संज्ञा would develop. 

One can replace the deity or the logic, but can't use the same संज्ञा.

The openness of early Indian thinkers amazes me!
