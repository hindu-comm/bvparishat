In my opinion this is a clear and accurate answer to the problem raised by Western Indology, and only needs elaboration with linguistic dressing.  
  
In mathematical logic, for example, it has been shown that a consistent thought system through various types of REGRESSIONS (one is known as "homomorphism") keeps creating novel objects.  
  
In this way, Hanumāna - for instance - belongs to the same consistency (ऋत) elaborated in the Vedic system, even though the proper name isn't mentioned there. This principle has been known and implemented by Indians for a long time (admittedly, during "ancient" enough epochs). This unity is even to this day being accessed, and kept alive, by Ascetics ("yeah, field work").

The irony here is the manner in which Pollock uses the word "regressive". He means "unprogressive" by it, but had he used the word in the sense I used, he would've corrected his own mistake.  
  
India is a young nation today. But it has got a history, an ancient history, and a prehistory, too: any sweeping generalisation is therefore a hazard scholars should avoid at all cost.
