Respectfully, I'm not clear why the burden of providing evidence is on me. I've cited Ingalls's obituary which is signed by a set of academicians well known in their respective fields. They are drawn from the community of his students, peers or successors in the department. I see no reason to doubt their words in this regard. Nor do I see any protest from his children, grand children etc. I also looked in vain for a retraction from the Harvard Gazette itself. There was not any.  
  
If you dont want to believe what's out there, that's clearly your prerogative. I understand that.

  
  
Thanks and Regards,
