Dr Gargeshwari,



आप भी न, कभी कभी!



Prof. Aklujkar has already provided us a perspective with which we can handle such 'contradictions' in the facts we have on hand.



Prof. Bijoy Misra too added a similar balancedperspective about the different aspects of the same personality.



Reactions of Vidwan L Srinivas and others are quite understandable. I am also notcomfortable with the new information I came to know about Prof. Ingalls.



But some facts of life are such. We respect a person for a certain aspect of his/her life. But given our disposition, some other aspect of the same personality could be quite shocking.



In some other thread we were discussing the issue of some scholars that we respect, like Jagannatha Pandita having allegiance to Moghul courts.



Ideally I would have liked Prof. Ingalls not to have worked for OSS, working under cover watching out for Indians. But alas, it is a fact that he did all this.I want this information not to affect my respect for him as an American Sankritist with sensitivity towards insider's perspective.



But for that I need not try to wish away those facts about him.



Can we move on without going round androundon this issue?
