Somebody did post Prof. Pollock's 1985 paper on "shastra"..

Here is the first sentence in the abstract

"Shastra is one of the fundamental features and problems of Indian civilization in general and of

Indian intellectual history in particular."

  

This is the problem of his style. I am not sure if it is deliberate.
Certainly it is unscientific

and superficial. He may have a audience somewhere. I read today. My daughter

might have gone through this "fact' in college. 

  

Some scholars in India might like to examine him more in case they think he has merit

on his essays. His sweeping generalizations would be unacceptable to most immigrant

parents from India.  On the poetry and translation side, he must be substituted in respect

of the authors of the great Indian literature.
