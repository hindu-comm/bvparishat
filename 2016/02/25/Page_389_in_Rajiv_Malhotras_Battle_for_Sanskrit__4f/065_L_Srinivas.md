\> In Sri Ramanuja’s words – (Asti me hasti shailagre pitru-paitamaham Dhanam…:: I have the ancestral wealth of my inheritance on the peak of the mountain called ‘Hasti Shaila’ ( todays Melukote at Karnataka)’?   

The quote's actually from Vedanta Desika's vairāgyapañcakam: asti me hastiśailāgre vastu paitāmahaṃ dhanam where hastiśaila refers to Varadarāja temple in Kanchipuram.
