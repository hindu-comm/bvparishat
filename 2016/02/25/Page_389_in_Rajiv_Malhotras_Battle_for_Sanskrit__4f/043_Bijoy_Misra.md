Rajiv,

These are international and political issues. Again may not be to the charter of BVP.

Funding sources do shape people's opinion. But we should look at the product and

evaluate in a scholarly manner as much we can. This has been Prof Pollock's

problem. He is firm in believing that all creative work must have been engineered

through some royal support to create flattery. I differ on this with him strongly.

Many could do, but we must not generalize.
