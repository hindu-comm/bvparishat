This is an important policy statement. I hope it will be applied consistently. The following works of Pollock are based on political arguments, and I assume these works are not allowed to be discussed:  

1.  His theory of the aestheticization of power to explain the Sanskrit
    Cosmopolis as a political phenomenon. 2.  His thesis in the paper "Deep Orientalism" that argues how Nazis
    used the social oppression rationalized in Sanskrit texts to shape
    their own case for genocide. 3.  His theory of the death of sanskrit which focuses on the role of
    Hindu kings for this death. 4.  His work on Ramayana (or a large part of it) which argues how the
    divine/demonic pair of constructs was developed to make kings assume
    divinity and project the demonic upon their political enemies; how
    this was deployed by Hindu kings to fight turkish invaders; and how
    BJP uses Ramayana to fight Muslims.

As long as the policy is consistently applied it should be ok.  

Personally i feel this will perpetuate Indian traditional scholars remaining in comfortable silos, afraid to come out. But maybe the moderators have their reasons for this policy, which is their prerogative.
