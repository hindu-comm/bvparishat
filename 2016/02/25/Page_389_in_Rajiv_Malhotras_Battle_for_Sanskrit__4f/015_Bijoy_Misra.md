Dear friends,

  

I signed the petition yesterday. I have not read all material written by Prof Pollock to

make a determination what he really means. But I did go through his translation of

Valmiki several years ago. This is where I was thoroughly disappointed. It appeared

to me that his command of Sanskrit language was weak and his appreciation of poetry

was almost zero. He had made a joke of Valmik's elegance to some choppy text of

arbitrary prose. Upon questioning he told me that the translation was done by a

"committee" and it went out of hand. He said he had improved since etc. I am of

the opinion that talent does not develop in time.

  

I am against anyone doing a translation of a text unless the person is a native of

the culture and has deep familiarity with the metaphors and the social context

of the society that he or she wishes to contribute in. I agree that India still lacks

scholars with strong bilingual skills but the material must not be made into trash. 

I write on behalf of hundreds of thousands of us who live abroad and wish to educate

our children on India with the aid of such translations. The translations can become

curriculum material for the college and high school students.  They could also be

needed for the youth in India. Every effort must be done such that the translations

preserve the beauty, grandeur, the society and the creativity of the original.

  

Upon further reading of Prof Pollock, he comes out as a political individual and not

a creative talent. He is more concerned in finding conclusions than celebrating the

text at hand. He goes into sweeping generalizations with some sketchy evidence

with a rush to make a conclusion. I did write to him about this and he did not respond

to my last request. I gave up further reading since his writing was more argumentative

than comprehensive. After going through Rajiv's book, I have requested Prof Pollock

to engage Rajiv in a debate that I have offered to moderate.

  

While Prof Pollock's political views might get cleared or clarified through further

discussion, his qualification to lead the effort of translating literary texts of Indian

languages has bothered me. I am of the opinion he is unfit and unsuitable for the

translation project that he has accepted to lead. The Murty family must make an open

advertisement and make explicit talent requirements for the project.
They must not

proceed on an abusive business venture. The project as presented now is injurious

to our children and must be strongly protested. I thank Prof Ramasubramian to have

initiated the effort.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
