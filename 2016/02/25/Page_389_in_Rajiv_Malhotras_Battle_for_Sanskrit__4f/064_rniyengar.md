Dear Dr.Shastry,

Your points are no doubt interesting. I have the following quickies:

1\) The OR in your statement about 'tradition" has to be replaced by AND.

2\) Hasti shaila id Kanchipuram. Melkote is Yadushaila. The verse is attributed to Vedanta Desika (naasti pitraarjitam kincit na mayaa kincidaarjitam\| asti me.....\|\|)

  

regards

RNI
