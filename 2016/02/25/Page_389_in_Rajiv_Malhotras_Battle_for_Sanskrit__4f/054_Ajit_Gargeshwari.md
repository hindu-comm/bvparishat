Sanskrit studies in India is not under the verge of extinction. Standards might have come down in a few area and we need to focus o those areas. It always to good to be focused on Sanskrit and Indology in India or criticize works of Western and Indian scholars in a way work is reviewed. Part or aspect of JNU on which Prof. Pollock has given statements doesn't impact Sanskrit studies in India and is a political statement  
  

I have already given my view about the petition on another thread.
