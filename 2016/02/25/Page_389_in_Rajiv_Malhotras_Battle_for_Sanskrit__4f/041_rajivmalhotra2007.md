Dear Shri Ajit ji. I did NOT claim any spy theory for Ingalls at all. Please read my post carefully.  
  
On the broader issue of CIA role in Area Studies, this is well known.  
  
For example, please see: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_studies>  
  
Here is the history of this CIA program summarized by Nick Dirks, himself a prominent Indologist: <http://chronicle.com/article/Scholars-SpiesGlobal/133459/>  
  
Prakash Karat, CPM leader, launched a massive expose in his 1984 article published in "*The Marxist*" journal, which is available at: <http://www.cpim.org/marxist/198402_marxist_vol_org_prakash.htm>  
  
CIA has active recruitment program on US campuses, open visits for interviews. Please see CIA web site for careers: <https://www.cia.gov/careers/student-opportunities>  
  
There are several books on CIA infiltration into US academics, mostly written by leftist Americans. Yet, when it comes to Indians in Indology, this topic is kept off limits. It is fair game for western scholars to discuss but Indians are discouraged. This enable Indians to remain happily and peacefully in their silos.
