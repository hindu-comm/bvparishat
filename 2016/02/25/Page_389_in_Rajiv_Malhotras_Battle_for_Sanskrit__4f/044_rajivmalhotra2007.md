*Response*: The main thesis of Pollock's '*Language of gods ..*.' relies upon this point.  

-   He cites dozens of examples to show that it was kings (and only the
    kings) who caused the spread of Sanskrit and its texts - he coins
    the term "Sanskrit Cosmopolis" to refer to this. The kings' royal
    patronage is what drove Sanskrit. -   Furthermore, this royal patronage was driven by the quest for power.
    His signature "*Theory of the Aestheticization of Power*" is an
    elaborate explanation of how royal power drove the spread of
    sanskrit and culture. I call this a sweeping and very original piece
    of work by him.  
-   Then he says that brahmins did this work in Sanskrit and kavya as
    per king's mandate. In return, they were made powerful because
    brahmins had this right exclusively. (This is where his earlier
    conclusions about Vedic social hierarchy of power is cited.) -   Bottom line: There is a brahmin-king nexus of power driving the
    history of Sanskrit and culture.

I reverse this logic to show that USA state (as the modern equivalent of the king) is involved in Indology. Can we call it the US "aestheticization of power"? Maybe Pollock would agree with my view, as it takes his theory and applies it in reverse.  

  

Why is it within scholarly bounds to do what Pollock does, but considered unscholarly to respond by saying that American Orientalists are equally involved in the same thing - not all of them but many of them.

  

Would you consider Pollock's thesis as unscholarly because it drags in Indian politics? He is not only heavily bringing in ancient Indian politics, but also present day Indian politics - many articles on the past start by framing in terms of BJP/RSS-bashing. I am not interesting in defending or criticizing BJP/RSS. I merely wish to inform scholars that such writings are considered appropriate when done by Western Indologists.  

  

What I seek is symmetry and parity in scholarship in both directions. Nothing more or less.
