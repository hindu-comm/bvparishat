I do not think that Shri L. Srinivas did any selective quoting and twisting. Nor do I think that he engaged in conspiracy theories. Ingalls should not be given so much credit for sensitivity seems to be his point. (I do not agree with that point, for I do not see any sure connection between spying in Afghanistan and sensitivity to Sanskrit poetry or Indian culture, but if he feels that there is a connection, he has a right to say so. And, as I have already written above, he has, in my view, stated his point without any selective quoting or twisting.)

This is a fair question and will serve to bring the discussion closer to the objectives of the BVP forum.

  

For contextually balanced understanding of the details given by Shri L. Srinivas, I should add this: When one’s country is in danger, people are forced to undertake work they would not normally undertake. Linguists like Leonard Bloomfield and Indologists like Norman Brown were employed to translate enemy messages, decode cables etc. This was because of their superior linguistic skills and abilities to understand unfamiliar cultures. If they had been forced into the duties of active soldiers, they might not have come back alive to mature as scholars. (Similar are the stories of Prof. Wilhelm Rau and Agehānanda Bhāratī (= Leopold Fisher), although they worked only as interpreters in the German counterparts of Subhash Chandra Bose’s Indian National Army.

  

I met Ingalls regularly for four years (as a student as well as an occasional substitute teacher of his students), since he was my guide. I read Avestan and Old Persian with Richard Frye in two courses and later met him more than once in the meetings of the American Oriental Society. Neither ever mentioned to me that they had served in Afghanistan during a war! That was obviously not an important part of their lives in their view.

  

What was great about them (as with some of my teachers like S.D. Joshi, K.S. Arjunwadkar, and A.G. Mangrulker in Pune) was that they never expressed displeasure when a student disagreed with them. They encouraged the students to think independently and did not hesitate to admit their own errors.

  

I attach herewith a rather long review I wrote in Sanskrit of Ingalls’ translation of the Subhāṣita-ratna-kośa even before I met him. You will find his sensitivity to poetry mentioned even in that immature piece of mine. And he did not become angry with me, although I criticized him in certain areas.
