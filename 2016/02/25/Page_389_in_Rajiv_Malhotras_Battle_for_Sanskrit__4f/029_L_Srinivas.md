I would like to apologize in advance for not sharing the same love for the late Prof Ingalls.  
  
It may be noted that the CIA and American Special Forces in Afghanistan have recognized cultural sensitivity as a strategic weapon especially as the numbers of their forces [reduce.in](http://reduce.in) the occupied country. It's not a new doctrine. The British knew it from their Imperial experience. The Americans learnt it during the World War II.  
  
And oh incidentally, Ingalls did spend a few years in Kabul during World War II spying on Indian patriots who were trying to flee British Raj thru Central Asia on their way to Germany or Japan. He was an officer of the OSS, the predecessor of the CIA. The CIA itself was formed by an act of Congress only in 1947. Please refer to Ingalls's obituary in the Harvard Gazette or a book on the Great Game during the World War II. Of course as cover, he worked as an English teacher in a lycee in Kabul. It is said he was also working on his Ph D dissertation at this time.

Who says that Indologists dont learn from their field work?  
  
Thanks and Regards,
