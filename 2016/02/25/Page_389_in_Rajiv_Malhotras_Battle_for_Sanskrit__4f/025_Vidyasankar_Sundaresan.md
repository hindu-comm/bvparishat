Dear Rajiv,  

  

I do not need any introduction to you, so please take my remarks objectively, in the spirit in which I offer them. As you know, a number of us here, professional academic scholars and amateurs alike, understand and sympathize/empathize with many elements of the larger picture that you are drawing. However, quite frankly, I think your point #2 below, about Sringeri Peetham and Columbia University, overstates the case quite a lot and significantly misleads many of your readers. I apologize for the usage of a couple of words with all caps in what follows; it is just an easy way to add emphasis. Also, please note that I am writing this in my capacity as a private individual. I am not an official spokesperson for either the Sringeri Peetham or the trust that runs its affiliate in the United States. Nevertheless, I am setting down my perspective on this forum, because it is not Sringeri's style to issue press statements and public responses, and I see a lot of public and private conversations that seem quite misinformed.

  

The basic idea planned by the Sringeri Vidya Bharati Foundation (SVBF) in the USA was to endow a chair for Indian philosophy, named for Adi Sankara, in a suitable department at Columbia University. Prof. Pollock was involved in the discussions in his capacity as a Columbia faculty member who is a Sanskritist, because you cannot do Indian philosophy without Sanskrit knowledge. He was not going to be occupying that chair himself, nor could one of his own students have taken it up, simply because philology and linguistics are not philosophy. I confess that I was myself unaware of this particular nuance at one point of time, but the president of the SVBF trust was very open in sharing some of the details when I brought up my own concerns privatelywith him. In fact, I believe Sheldon Pollock would have been that much closer to emeritus status at Columbia, by the time this proposed chair in Indian philosophy would have been up and running. As far as I know, at the time you got involved with this, the discussions between the two parties were at a very early stage and not a single cent had exchanged hands. To assume that everything would have moved at lightning speed at Columbia and at other universities across the USA is to quite misunderstand the way in which the Sringeri Peetham actually operates and takes decisions. Indeed, the more typical scenario is that a lot of impatient people often criticize Sringeri for not acting quickly enough! Of course, if things had moved forward, Prof. Pollock would have been involved in selecting the occupant of the chair, but that is par for the course.

  

Anyway, the only people privy to all the details and the discussions between SVBF and Columbia University are the trustees of SVBF and the representatives of the university. Beyond a point, the specifics of what would have or would not have happened are matters of speculation for the rest of us. We can all take our educated guesses about the broad potential outcomes and you could perhaps respond to me that you know more about the actual details of SVBF's discussions with Columbia than I do, but at this point in time, it is all moot. Either because of your intervention or for some other reason, the said project has not moved forward.

  

That said, let me confidently assert the following.

  

1\. A chair endowed in an American university with donations from Sringeri followers in the United States would be NOWHERE even close to an "official mouthpiece of Sringeri internationally."

  
2. The Sringeri Peetham in India would \*NEVER\* hand over the right to speak on its behalf to any professor in a foreign university, or for that matter, in a modern Indian university. Believe me, an institution that has endured remarkably well, through all the ups and downs of Indian history, over the centuries that have seen many other traditional institutions get wiped out completely, knows well, how to preserve its tradition and how to choose the people who will preserve its tradition. The standards that are expected are extremely high and are not going to be diluted any time soon, least of all to favor some unknown future employee or a known current employee of a foreign university.

  
3. The Sringeri Sankaracharyas have always been and will always continue to be extremely choosy about delegating authority to people even among the community of pundits with traditional training, dedication and lifestyles. For this, they often get criticized nowadays for not being open enough and not adapting to the changing times in India, but the Sringeri tradition knows that you can't preserve things by being too open, so it takes this criticism in stride and doesn't play fast and loose with anything. A number of traditional pundits are on this forum and can attest to the truth of this statement.

  
4. The sword of being/becoming an official mouthpiece cuts both ways. On the other end, Columbia University would not have agreed to house a faculty member in an endowed chair to become a mouthpiece for an Indian religious organization, no matter how prestigious or ancient. The concept of academic freedom in the West would have stood insurmountably in the way, no matter how much you and I criticize the actual application of that concept. A number of university professors are also on this forum and can attest to the truth of this statement as well.

  
5. In summary, neither a very traditional Sankaracharya institution, perhaps the most traditional and conservative among them all, nor an American big name university would behave this way.

  

6\. If what you fear would have come to happen (that the occupant of the proposed chair would have subtly/insidiously compromised or cut at the root of the Veda-Vedanta tradition represented and led by the Sringeri Peetham), then the Sankaracharyas and their followers would have found other ways to react. I can assert that with the greatest confidence as well.

  

7\. As you say at the end, the real problem is not with Pollock, and I agree. As for problemsamong the tradition keepers,of incompetence, laziness, selling out or being bought, that is, again, NEVER going to happen with the Sankaracharyas of Sringeri, no matter what some people may assume or think or say today. People at the administrative level, with the authority to decide on and allocate the institution's resources, come and go. They have different operating styles and concerns, which again is par for the course, but if your concern was about the fundamentals of the Advaita Vedanta tradition, they will always endure at Sringeri, as in the past. A university professor at Columbia, who may or may not be beholden to Prof. Sheldon Pollock, is going to change nothing.

  

With all that out of the way, let me raise a bigger question. How else are Hindus in the USA supposed to engage with academia if we do not talk, and constructively so, with university administrations and the professors involved? Does it have to be a situation where we from the East make our lives in the West, yet ensure that never the twain shall meet? Not all members of this forum may be aware of it, but another initiative by a different group on the opposite coast of the US has recently been shut down as well, at UC Irvine, where the monetary donation had already been made and the university has now found reason to return it. In this case, it has been because of fears from left leaning pressure groups that a chair at UC Irvine could become "an official mouthpiece" of a Hinduism that is becoming increasingly right-wing. I am not arguing the merits or otherwise of this position, but merely pointing out that this has happened at the other end of the United States.

  

In summary, it seems to me that those who want to protect our traditions are suspicious and fearful of what will happen if an American university chair were to become an official mouthpiece for a traditional Hindu institution (although I see zero chances of that happening). Those who want to protect American universities from "right-wing Hindu" takeover are also suspicious and fearful of what will happen if a university chair were to become an official mouthpiece that will speak for Hindus (although I see zero chances of that happening as well). I can't help but think that there is a significant amount of xenophobia operating at both ends of the spectrum.

  

Overall, from where I stand, the end result seems to be this. If Indians in the United States were to have had any chance of influencing how our numerous traditions as well as the India of today are studied and portrayed, from the halls of higher academia to the middle and elementary schools, there have been enormous setbacks within the last year. No constructive discussion, even at an initial stage, can happen in such an atmosphere of suspicion and distrust, let alone an outcome that isconducive for a change for the better. And like it or not, if we can't or won't engage with academia in the West, fat chance of influencing and changing anything back in India. It is well and good to be critical of critical academic scholars, but my gut says that all this might well end up being a Pyrrhic victory with respect to the actual things that need to get accomplished.

  

Best regards,

Vidyasankar
