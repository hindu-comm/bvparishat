I have a few points on the topic of Ingalls and his personal geopolitical involvements:  

1.  Such an issue is appropriate to discuss as part of interpreting the
    work of a scholar. Both Indian and western approaches to philology
    place emphasis on the "context" in which someone did his work. We
    bring in the context to interpret the words of an Indian voice in a
    text. The same relevance also applies to the context in which a
    western Indologist has worked. What filters have motivated a thinker
    to select certain things and ignore others? What assumptions did
    (s)he make consciously or unconsciously in doing the work? etc.  
2.  Western Indologists routinely bring in such political contexts of
    Indian thinkers when interpreting them. This is true for ancient and
    modern thinkers. The biographical background of an Indian is always
    studied with great interest. 3.  Westerners do such personal "digging" about each other also, and
    many books are written that go into details of the "secret life" of
    important thinkers.  
4.  It is strange that some Indians have imposed self-censorship to be
    able to do this to westerners. This leads to idolatry of western
    Indologists. When westerners bring out such personal details about
    Indians, it is considered a favor to the Indian thinker for "making
    him seem more human" - as in the example of Sri Aurobindo's
    controversial biography (about his multiple live) that cause a stir.
    So why cant we say that bringing out such personal
    background/context of Ingalls "makes him more human"? 5.  This reversing the gaze is important to do with respect and with
    rigor, free from emotions or sweeping judgments.  

I personally know of meetings regularly held at the conferences of the American Academy of Religion (and other humanities disciplines) where important Indologists are invited to brief CIA/FBI. It is very well established that the whole "area studies" in the US was initiated by such US government agencies after the second world war, to monitor (and infiltrate) intellectual development in what was called "the third world". There is a lot written on this if you are interested. These contexts are not irrelevant in the works of scholars.  
  
Most Western Indologists tend to have multiple lives, multiple contexts in which they play regarding their Indological work. You can find a variety of things the same person has said - both positive and negative. This confuses many Indians. There is also a frequent dichotomy between the private and public utterances. For instance, there are many private bhakts of Vedic systems (i.e. as true insiders) who do not show this aspect publicly in order to remain credible with their establishment. Conversely, there are those who privately have agendas to do social engineering, but who are publicly very positive and supportive of Indian traditions.  
  
Coming back to Pollock: In my book, "*The Battle For Sanskri*t", both Ingalls and Pollock are mentioned. My approach is to use only their published writings to evaluate them. I do not rely on hearsay or speculations or what others have revealed. Ingalls comes out very firmly rooted in respecting Indian traditional contexts.  
  
His ace student, Pollock, comes out quite differently. In fact this is where the Pollock era begins: Pollock deviates from Ingalls mandate that the sacredness of a text must not be compromised in its interpretation. Pollock *explicitly* asserts that the right philology must be "*political* philology". In fact, he scolds orientalists (Ingalls would belong in this category) who he feels have romanticized the Indian texts. He wants new scholars to be social-political activists in "exposing" the oppression, the social toxins contained in Sanskrit texts. When time permits in a few days I will cite numerous such evidence of Pollock's works.  
  
The whole issue is about contexts: Who is to supply the context, the text itself, or the modern scholar armed with Marxism, feminism, postmodernism, subaltern theory, and so forth? Our scholars should not ignore this battlefront.
