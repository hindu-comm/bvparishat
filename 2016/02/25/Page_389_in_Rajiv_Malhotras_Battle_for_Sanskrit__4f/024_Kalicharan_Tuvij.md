I mean हनुमान only. I invoked an idea from Mathematics, namely "homomorphism" (for thecurrentlack of any other common currency, my bad), which has the following meaning:

  

Suppose in a consistent system (called, "group") Sthere is a relation among three entities (among many belonging to that system):

a # b = c

  

Where, # is a relation belonging to the samesystem.

  

Now, when we say that another system Tis homorphologically related, or "equivalent", to system S, it means that:

for every equation a # b = c belonging to system S, there is an equation in system T,

x §y = z

where, in someconsistent way, x is related to a; y is related to b; z is related to c, and § is related to #.

  

This is how the original system S, by "regressing"upon itself through manyhomomorphisms, continues to create novel systems (such as T) that are nothing but creative solutions to domain specific challenges.

  

This is betterunderstood through तंत्र विद्या, but as you know forums might not be the best place for it. Anyway, the whole edifice of modern science is based on this principle (i.e. onthe narrowelaboration in Maths).

  

But the point I made is simple enough: it can be demonstrated that theinnumerable Indic systems - all of them organically grown - are related to each other through a unity, which we can call the वेद itself (because it is perceived as the original system), though for all practical purposes anyIndic system (say, शैव) is independent of anyanother Indic system (say, नाट्य शास्त्र, or even वेद). Moving throughany of these worlds, mysticallytherefore,amounts to moving through any other world, includingthe वैदिक विश्व itself.

a,b,c are संज्ञाs in system S, but morph into x,y,z respectively in system T. This is the fountainhead of creativity itself, yet as I discussed above - the underlyingunity is not lost sight of. This is where BM's statement needed elaboration.

  

Pollockand others have exploited the false filters that Indians themselves have developed over the medieval ages. On my part, I canonly admit of organicभक्ति traditions as being "traditions" in genuine sense. Brahmins were earmarked to be the gatekeepers of our heritage: their scholarly traditions (भाष्य, व्याकरण, so on) weremerelythe means by which they held on to the keys ofthe treasure.  

  

Brahmins were not invested with special powers. But they were meant to be what Rsis meant them to be; the important point is, the work has been carried out. "What next" is the question.

अधिकार is a naive idea here. Of course everyone is free to do anything they want to. We are also free now to do anything we want to, and in my view we should concern ourselves with this alone.

  

English being an Anglo language, Sheldon Pollock is prima facie OK in translating from Sanskrit to English. Who knows,It might be of some help to some of the deracinated Indians as well (which may still lead them to the source).

  

The deeper issues however are far from simple, and I've posted my further thoughts on SriRM's thread (as per his request to post there).  



I've gone through the rest of the reply carefully. I accept, and indeed learned, all of that wholeheartedly. Nothing possible to add there.
