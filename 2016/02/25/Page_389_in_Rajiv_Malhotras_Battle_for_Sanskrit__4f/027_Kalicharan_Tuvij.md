Yes a संज्ञा created, but in the विश्व of रामायण. In the आयण of राम .

And that's howरामायण mirrors वेदा,yet is completely independent from it.

But if sometruths cannot be transmitted to theother without replication by the other in theform of lived experience, then no doubt we are in a big trouble, because such experiences might take quite a while - if not never -to come by, in contrast to the immediate test-ability of teachings in material sciences and cultures.

  

All the talk of generatingknowledge - evenby catching hold of some or the otherयजमान - will just remain that: talk. Third world countries remain thirdworld because they are able to find ways of sinking - not creating - money, in wasteful vicious cycles.

  

Even दस्युजन have this darkwisdom: how to survive in world, by transacting (business,work, whatever)in दास modes, so they keep their heads down and give their masters their due. They don't fit into thecharacter oftheयजमान ofयज्ञ, sacrifice.

  

How much यज्ञ is inside us? Let the scholar ask himself/ herself thisbefore making a jump.

  

Eminent A says something, and eminentB says somethingand says"I don't know what youmean. AndI am busy."

A and B, far fromcreating something, can't agree on what they are here for. Meanwhile it is all merry, and goodmoney spent.

  

And why shouldIndians need translating anything at allinto English? (out of "clerk zeal"?)

  

An average भारतीयdoesn't need शास्त्र either: all heneeds at the end of itis a capacityfor तपस्या, whithout which he remainstortured like a tethered पशु.Currently no extantknowledge system anywhere in the world is designed for this objective.
