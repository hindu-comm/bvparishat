Should we not discuss even that part/aspect of politics which affects the study, survival/preservation, or progress of Sanskrit studies or Indology?

  

In my view, one of the main reasons why Sanskrit is in such a precarious position at present is the aloofness of traditional scholars from what is happening around them. They should have taken note (or should have been enabled to take note), on a large scale, of the changed circumstances, to analyze the changes, to propose strategies that took into account even the changing political conditions and to answer, even if partially, the fundamental question of where their traditional world view differed from the present dominant world view. The attached two papers may be helpful in this regard, especially the “piṇḍa-brahmāṇḍa” one.
