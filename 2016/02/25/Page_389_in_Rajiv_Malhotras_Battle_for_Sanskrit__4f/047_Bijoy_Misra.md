Rajiv,

You have done an excellent work in analyzing Prof Pollock and creating a scholarly evaluation.

But to interpret it further is a different task. This is where I believe Prof Pollock is into

political operation, as again evidenced by his various other statements. My thinking

is that BVP should be left as a scholarly forum analyzing the merits of a product and

not of the individual's resources or pedigree.

  

Prof Pollock's political ideas are food for political discussion. There are a lot of issues

with them. I am wondering if BVP is the right forum. I am only a member. BVP lets

me express. Sometimes similar mails in Indology list get suppressed.
So I think

Indology is a semi-political list. We should keep BVP as a scholars' list if we can.,

  

Thank you.

Bijoy
