if available online.



Could not find.



The arguments of Valmiki Ramayana text being post-Buddhist are old. (There is a thread on BVP in which error in this chronology and its root were discussed)



Which of the two: Jataka texts and Valmiki Ramayana text is older is a different question.



In any case, Mahabharata text and employment of Anushtub is not considered to be post-Buddhist by any study.



Even if the claim is not invention of Anushtub but employment of Anushtub is lead by Buddhists either in Jataka texts or elsewhere, the employment of Anushtub in Mahabharata stands a counter evidence.



But as on now, we can only wait for the actual words of the claim under question.
