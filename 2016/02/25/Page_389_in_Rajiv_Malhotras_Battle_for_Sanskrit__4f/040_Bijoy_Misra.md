Personal life of people are probed when a person in power carries radical views

or makes extraordinary inventions. Prof Ingalls was a fine gentleman and a

thorough scholar. I met him briefly and I was impressed. I think a person's

youth need not take scrutiny. Prof Ingalls respected Sanskrit and India. 

So is not the case with many!
