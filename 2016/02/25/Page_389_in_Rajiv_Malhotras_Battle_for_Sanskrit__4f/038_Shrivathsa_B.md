hariH OM,

1\. The reference to Ingalls was brought up by Nagaraj and not Srinivas.  
2. Unquestioning praise of anyone is not a hallmark of scholarliness. If Ingalls was praised for something, it is fair that we hear about his other side. Hence one doesn't understand the overreaction.  
3. The reference to Ingalls' spying activity is not a "conspiracy theory". It is there in cold print in his obituary.  
4. Understanding the man many a time gives insights into the expediencies he would have encountered in his work. To negate such a possibility prima facie and giving him a carte blanche thinking that he would have been academically neutral is naive. This seems the crux of the matter even in the case of Pollock. And to this extent the input of Srinivas is valuable. We are discussing a field where academic neutrality may be claimed and still not be falsified. Does it bear repetition that humanities aren't exact sciences and that much of its research is agenda driven? All those who have worked in and on India need to be analyzed for their contributions and troubles they have caused. Let none be treated as holy.

svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  
 shrivathsa.
