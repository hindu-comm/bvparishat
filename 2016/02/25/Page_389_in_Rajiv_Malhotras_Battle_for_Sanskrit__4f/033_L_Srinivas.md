Thank you, Prof Aklujkar.

Except that when that country turns out to be mine or next to mine, I'd sit up and take notice.  
  
I really dont need to produce any evidence for anything that may flow out of what I said. We notice that mathematicians dont find it that hard to pick up Panini or other forms of grammar, just as philologists dont find it that hard to become code breakers and such. There are some habits of thought and some kind of problem solving which are shared across certain disciplines. Likewise, what you learn in one field, you apply in the next. Nothing very surprising about it.  
  
This may be tangential to poetic sensitivity. I am not going to shout from rooftops about how aesthetically pleasing are the Harvard school's translations. I may not be alone in this. Here I note the effort taken by George Hart to use a professional poet for his translations.  
  
In the current environment among western scholars where any critique of an Indologist amounts to being 'Hindu fundamentalist', one does expect a somewhat more rational and balanced outlook among non western scholars. Perhaps one has no right to such expectation.  
  
Thanks,
