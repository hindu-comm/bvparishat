My Reply : Let me ask a question why do you need to decide? Scholars write what they feel are best in their judgement. There is no binding on any one to accept any one view. You are always welcome to have another view. During that process let your criticism be focused on scholarly content rather than on generalization. You talk so much about Pollock etc. I have not seen you write anything relating to Sanskrit by quoting and analyzing original texts. May I say you are relying too much on secondary literature.  
  

If Prof. Pollock is bringing politics then they are not discussed on this list
