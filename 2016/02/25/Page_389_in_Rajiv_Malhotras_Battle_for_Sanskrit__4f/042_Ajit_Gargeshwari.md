I am still looking for evidence I don't consider news paper reports ,wiki reports and Marxists journals as any evidences.  
  
Rajiv Malhotra says CIA has active recruitment program on US campuses, open visits for interviews. Please see CIA web site for careers: <https://www.cia.gov/careers/student-opportunities>

  
  
There are several books on CIA infiltration into US academics, mostly written by leftist Americans. Yet, when it comes to Indians in Indology, this topic is kept off limits. It is fair game for western scholars to discuss but Indians are discouraged. This enable Indians to remain happily and peacefully in their silos."  
  

My Reply: This is not Sanskrit studies on which this list focuses. As I have said before this list is not meant to undermine Indologists and their contributions. Non India Western Indologists who are not members of this list.
