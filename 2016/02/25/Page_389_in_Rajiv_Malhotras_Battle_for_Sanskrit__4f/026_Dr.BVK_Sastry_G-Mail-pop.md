Namaste Kalicharan Tuviji



1. Thanks for clarifying the word \< I mean हनुमान only. I invoked an idea from Mathematics, namely "homomorphism" > as a special \< संज्ञा \> created by you.



2. As you have indicated \< This is betterunderstood through तंत्र विद्या, but as you know forums might not be the best place for it. > .

I agree. Rest of the interaction can be on off-forum mode.



3. Thanks for the words of appreciation \< I've gone through the rest of the reply carefully. I accept, and indeed learned, all of that wholeheartedly. Nothing possible to add there.\>.



Regards

BVK Sastry
