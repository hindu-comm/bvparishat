Namaste



Thanks for the correction on understanding \< hastishailagre>.



Thanks for suggestion of replacement of ‘ OR’ by ‘AND’. With this, it almost becomes a \< Private engagement for Public (Loka /Sarve) Welfare ( Kalyanam).



In Post-Independent India, With 75% of Varnas up and against the 25% ‘ Agra-Jama’-Varna segment ; and 25% ‘Agra-Janma’ Varna segment
suffering \< A-Samghata and Vishaada combined together \> =
low-density and High depression factor to make any significant impact
through any action \< due to globally scattered population with Several models of non-agglutination, non coherent goal, multiple foci and centers of action with differential priorities and preferences in resource investment and management> , the suggestion for ‘AND’ makes more sense.
