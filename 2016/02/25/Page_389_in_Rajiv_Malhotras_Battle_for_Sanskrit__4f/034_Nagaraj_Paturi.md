I am just back in front of my system.



Thanks Vidwan L.Srinivas for the Harvard.edu link. I would not have known this aspect of the career of Prof. Ingalls without this.



Thanks Prof. Aklujkar, as always, you provided the timely guidance to view such matters.



My teachers and friends who studied with Prof. Ingalls never shared these aspects of his career with me.



Prof. George Hart was the first one to share his happiness offlinewith me for this post of mine. He shared his nostalgia of his student days with Prof. Ingalls and sharedhow he is able to understand the Indian anguish at the unnecessary interference bysome of the Indologists in Indian politics. He alsoshared due to his living in India, heunderstands how offended Indians feel when their culture is looked down upon by the westerners.



Prof . Dominik Wujastyk thanked me offline for the 'stimulatingcomments' , though we had a long offline conversation on some aspects.



The same obituaryon Harvard.edu website says:

Compare the clarity of stand in “I have never met a man with whom I disagreed on such basic questions, yet whose company I so constantly enjoyed.”with the blind borrowing from Kosambi by some of the present Indologists who do this in the name of their own great efforts of'deromanticizing' 'deexoticizing' Indology, though Kosambi himself has been relegated justinto the position of a pioneer of the lineage of rigorous Marxist historiography whichmoved intomore advanced stages by the later and the present Marxist historians.



Is it not a good idea to focus on the healthy side of Indology for a balance?



Thanks and regards,



Nagaraj
