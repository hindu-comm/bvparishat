Dear friends,

  

I was shocked to find following opinion of Sheldon Pollock as referenced by Rajiv Malhotra.

  

Rajiv writes - "Pollock is also incorrect in saying that the Anushtubh chhanda was invented by the Buddhist Jataka authors and then copied by Valmiki as the meter used in the Ramayana. However, this claim is debatable"

  

Note to Rajiv: No debate is necessary. Anushtubh is found in plenty in the Rigveda. Now, is Rigveda also post-buddhist as per Pollock? Number of Anushtubh mantras in Rigveda is over 800.  

  

Rajiv asks in his book "Is Pollock too big to be criticized?' . I ask "is he big enough to be paid any attention?"
