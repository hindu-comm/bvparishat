Please read my book's chapter 5 for my analysis of Pollock's Ramayana. References are provided there, and see especially end note 45. You must go into Pollock's latest tome, his 2006 work, "*Language of the gods ..*."  
  

Some supporters I have are interested to fund a series of workshops to evaluate Pollock's work in detail and develop responses. KSU is among those who expressed interest to host it. I invite proposals from interested parties. It would be nice to have a central place that takes responsibility to do this and bring in experts by topic. Ramayana should certainly be one such topic. Rasa/kavya is another major topic. Broader topics alsoinclude:  

-   Vedic traditions and the allegation of human rights violations,
    caste oppression, gender inequality, etcc. -   allegations against shastras as a genre... -   Removal of the sacred from Sanskrit studies -   The theory of the *aestheticization of power* applied to the history
    of Sanskrit and its literature. -   Relationship between Buddhism and Vedic traditions (being considered
    mutually antagonistic).

I hope the experts here can help by providing leadership to create such a project. If interested, please write to me privately at: [RajivMal...@gmail.com]() The sponsoring sources would like to start soon.  

regards,

rajiv
