Taking the second assertion first: Do read the obituary atVbb􏰃2((􏰄Sea’VO􏰆dO􏰆R’SRc(UOhSbbS(ab􏰁􏰆g(+)􏰌)()+(RO􏰄WS􏰂􏰍VS􏰄􏰆g􏰍V􏰁􏰂􏰇Sa􏰍W􏰄UO􏰂􏰂a(
to which Sri L. Srinivas referred? One of the signatories to it is Prof. Richard Frye, who was with Ingalls in Kaburl and was a long-time colleague thereafter. What more evidence would you need?

  

Perhaps“spy” is too strong a word here.“informer,”“helper in translation,”“reporter” may be closer to the truth of what Ingalls, Frye, et al. did during the second world war (recall also that the USA was a late entrant in the war and had to do a lot of catch-up).

  

\>I don't at all agree with the views of Rajiv Malhotras views either . These are misguided statements without an iota of truth.\<

  

What is your evidence/argument for concluding that they are misguided or that every assertion/thought in them is untrue? An explanation may be beneficial to this list.
