Ajit: "You talk so much about Pollock etc. I have not seen you write anything relating to Sanskrit by quoting and analyzing original texts. May I say you are relying too much on secondary literature."  
  
*Response*: To do purva-paksha of Pollock one must quote *him*, which is what I do 100s of times in my book. Citing original Sanskrit texts would come under uttara-paksha. But first step is to understand what Pollock says - which is not an easy thing to do. Only then can someone develop uttara. We are still at step 1. Your view suggests you do not consider purva-paksha of Indology to be a fair subject here. That is fine but needs to be clarified - that this forum does not want to get involved in purva-paksha.  
  
There are many reasons I find among some Indian scholars shying away from purva-paksha of Western Indology - fear of upsetting the power structure of Indology, inability to read the dense/convoluted English works of Indologists, over-confidence, under-confidence, etc.  
  
Whatever these reasons may be, it would be nice for the forum moderators to clarify policy: Is purva-paksha of Western Indology allowed or off-limits? If it is allowed, then one must read the text being critiqued - which in Pollock's case is in English. One must cite it heavily and then analyze it, which is what I have done - more thoroughly than any other scholar I am aware of.
