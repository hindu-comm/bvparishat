Dear list

  

There have been many messages on this thread. Let me get back to a question on the original post which both Dr. Paturi and I asked.

  

Where has Pollock said that Anushtup metre was invented by Buddhists?

  

Rajiv Ji, can you help with the precise reference?

  

Thanks, Nityanand
