About the topic:

The Vedas are the fount of Bhāratīya Civilization. Held in the highest esteem by Sanātana-dharma, the word Veda indicates a vast body of spiritual and esoteric knowledge. The Veda is not created by anyone, but revealed to Ṛṣis (sages) in the depths of their meditation. Almost all traditional thoughts, secular or spiritual, find their origin in the Veda. In it we find literature of a high order, early seeds of philosophical speculation, prayer, details for yajñas and much more. This lecture aims to kindle the curiosity of the listeners by conveying the uniqueness of the Veda as well as dispel common myths about the Veda.

About the speaker:

Prof. Vempaṭi Kuṭumba Śāstrī is the President of the International Association for Sanskrit Studies. Among the numerous positions he has held, the notable ones are as Vice chancellor of the Rāṣṭriya-samskṛta-saṃsthāna, New Delhi, Sampūrṇānand Samskṛta University, Vārāṇasī as well as Śrī Somanātha Samskṛta University, Gujarāt. He epitomizes both traditional and modern methods of learning and teaching. His specialty extends to multiple areas such as Darśana-śāstra, Alaṅkāra-śāstra and Advaita Vedānta. He is also a keen proponent of Spoken Samskṛtam and has taught literary appreciation to hundreds of students in India and abroad. Prof. Śāstrī will also preside over the World Sanskrit Conference in Canada in 2018.
