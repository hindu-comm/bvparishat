Namaste

I do not know write to reply the question asked, but one thing I wanted to appreciate - is the way of asking a question. Your including the whole discussion you already had, will allow others to know the line of thought already taken, and they can continue from where you left- and it saves lot of time.

Good method. Thank you so much.
