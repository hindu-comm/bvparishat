Thanks Shivakumari Ji.

  

I spoke with Pushpa Dikshit Ji on phone yesterday evening for discussed this with her in detail. She said she agreed with the *Bālamanoramā* which implies the *saṃhitā* is by*ami pūrvaḥ*, but has not deliberated over what the *Nyāsa* says on*ami pūrvaḥ*. She suggested I speak with her again tomorrow.

  

I also called Jivana Sharma Ji, son of Govindacharya Ji (the author of the*Śrīdharamukhollāsinī* on the LSK) and editor of *Saṃskṛta-vāṇī*. Jivana Sharma Ji said his father has cited*ato guṇe* in all such places in his publications and added that in his opinion, *ami pūrvaḥ* does not apply to*tiṅ am*. He said he will discuss this further with his father Govindacharya Ji who is currently not well.

  

Today I am trying to reach Pt Ishwar Chandra.

  

PS: If Dr. Patel or anybody else needs the contact of Pushpa Dikshit Ji or Jivana Sharma Ji to speak with them personally on this question, they are welcome to mail me off this list.
