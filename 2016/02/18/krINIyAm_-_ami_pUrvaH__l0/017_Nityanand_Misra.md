They do not say it, but do they not imply it when they state*ami pūrvaḥ*is an*apavāda* (exception) to*prathamayoḥ pūrvasavarṇaḥ*?

  

This is my reasoning: the domain of an*apavāda*(particular/exceptional rule) is narrower than the domain of the *utsarga*(general rule). As the domain of the general rule (6.1.102*prathamayoḥ pūrvasavarṇaḥ*)is limited to the cases where one among the the first and second triplets of*sup* affixes follows (i.e. excludes cases where a*tiṅ* affix follows), the domain of the exceptional rule, which must be smaller, has to exclude cases where a*tiṅ*affix follows.

  

Please let me know if you disagree with this reasoning.
