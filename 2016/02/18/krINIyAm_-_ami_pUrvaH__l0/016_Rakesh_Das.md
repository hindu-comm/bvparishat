1\. Nowhere Prof. Joshi and Roodbergen say that it should be implied only for sup am.  

2\. Almost all the commentators are silent on this issue.  

3\. According to MB of the sutra औतोऽम्शसोः am stands for both sup and tin. That's what I have mentioned in an earlier message-

  
औतोऽम्शसोः इति सूत्रे शसा साहचर्यात् सुबेव अम् गृह्येत इत्येव वक्तुं शक्यम् आसीत्। अथापि भाष्यकारः, ओतस्तिङि प्रतिषेधः स्वीकृतो यत्, तेन अमा तिङ्भूतस्य अमः अपि ग्रहणं दृढीकृतम् एव।  

  
So, without strong confirmation that am is sup only, it is difficult to infer that Balamanorama-kara was wrong.

This is for the famous line सिद्धस्य गतिश्चिन्तनीया।
