There is nothing to disagree with the reasoning that अपवादः can apply only in a subset of उत्सर्गः.

In the present case, the conclusion that अमि पूर्वः doesn't apply can flow from two scenarios only.

1\. अमि पूर्वः is अपवाद only to प्रथमयोः पूर्वसवर्णदीर्घः (and not अतो गुणे or अकः सवर्णे दीर्घः)

or

2\. The अनुवृत्ति of 'प्रथमयोः' also runs in 'ami pUrvaH'.

The issue is that no traditional commentary clearly say that this falls under scenario 1 or 2. Only nyAsa is in favour of 1 when it mentions that this applies when प्रथमयोः would have applied. He also is silent on तिङ् part.

As regards derivation of अभवम्, there are proofs on both sides e.g. बालमनोरमा for अमि पूर्वः and rest for अतो गुणे.
