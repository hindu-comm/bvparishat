Thanks Prof. Das Ji. Appopos your*apavāda* argument, that is confirmed by S D Joshi andJ A F Roodbergen. In their discussion on A 7.1.25, Joshi and Roodbergen mention on p. 56 of the tenth volume of“The Aṣṭādhyāyī of Pāṇini with Translation and Explanatory Notes” that the rule 6.1.107 *ami pūrvaḥ*is an *apavāda* of the rule 6.1.102 *prathamayoḥ pūrvasavarṇaḥ*. This would imply that Joshi and Roodbergen also hold the view that 6.1.107*ami pūrvaḥ*is applicable only to the *sup am* and not the*tiṅ am.*

  

Citation: S. D. Joshi and J. A. F. Roodbergen (1991), The Aṣṭādhyāyī of Pāṇini with Translation and Explanatory Notes, New Delhi: Sahitya Akademi, Volume X (7.1.1 to 7.1.103), ISBN 9788172017811, p. 56. Snapshot attached.

  

The traditional commentaries (K, SK, LSK, etc) are quiet on whether 6.1.107*ami pūrvaḥ*applies to*tiṅ am* or not. They neither confirm it nor deny it, but the examples cited (*vṛkṣam*, *plakṣam*, *agnim*, *vāyum*, *rāmam*) are of the*sup am*alone. The only notable exception is the *Nyāsa* which clearly says *pūrvasavarṇadīrghatve prāpte vacanamidam*, as mentioned by one of the correspondents in Dr. Dhaval Patel's WhatsApp chat. All the examples quoted under 6.1.107*ami pūrvaḥ*in traditional commentaries are for*sup am* alone.I have not seen to other commentaries like*Manoramākucamardinī* and the*Śekhara*-s. 

  

Somehow the modern authoritative sources (Bhimsen Shastri, S D Joshi, Pushpa Dikshit, Ishwar Chandra, Govind Prasad Sharma) all seem to agree that 6.1.107*ami pūrvaḥ*applies only to*sup am*, either by considering the rule an *apavāda*of the rule 6.1.102*prathamayoḥ pūrvasavarṇaḥ*, or by discounting it in the case of the forms*abhavam*, *anayam*, etc.
