Won't it go against the general परिभाषा - पर्जन्यवल्लक्षणप्रवृत्तिः ? Whenever the sUtra has a scope, it will apply. I may be corrected in this regard.

अनर्थकत्व of a sUtra means that there is not a single example for application of this sUtra. As long as a single example is found for a sUtra, it is not anarthaka. Whereas in this case, there are sup as well tiG examples where the sUtra can apply. So अनर्थकत्व is not an issue in this sUtra.

What ज्ञापन would this sUtra do ?

I agree fairly on this point. Except bAlamanoramA, no one cites it. But at the same time, no commentary says in सिद्धान्तः that the rule doesn't apply in case of तिङ्‌ अम्‌.

Both can't be true for sure. Issue is who is right ? :)  
  

I would be grateful if Pushpa Dikshit ji, Govindacharya ji and Pt. Ishvar Chandra's responses can be summed up in the thread for future record and discussion. I appreciate the vigour by which Mr. Misra is trying to resolve this grammar issue.  

Thanking all in advance.
