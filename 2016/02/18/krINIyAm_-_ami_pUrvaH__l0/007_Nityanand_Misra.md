चिन्त्यम् indeed. The chance of a scribal/editorial error cannot be ruled out. Our it could be due to अनवधान of the commentator. Manuscripts/other editions may be consulted apart from the NSP one to confirm if the reading is the same.

  

Here are two references in support of my conclusion:

  

1)The श्रीधरमुखोल्लासिनी Hindi commentary on the लघुसिद्धान्तकौमुदी by गोविन्द प्रसाद शर्मा (ed. Acharya Raghunath Shastri, 2007, Varanasi: Chaukhambha Surbharati Prakashan, Volume II, p. 407) clearly says that it is अतो गुणे which causes अभव अम् to result in अभवम्. The snapshot is attached.

  

I have used the three-volume *Śrīdharamukhollāsinī* as a reference for eight years now, and given the meticulous precision with which it offers numerous step-by-step derivations, I would be very surprised if the book got it wrong.

  

2)The पुष्पाञ्जलि Hindi commentary on the सिद्धान्तकौमुदी by पण्डित ईश्वरचन्द्र (2010, Delhi: Chaukhambha Sanskrit Pratishthan, Volume I, p. 164) also confirms that it is the सुप् affix अम् that is to be inferred in the rule अमि पूर्वः. The snapshot is also attached.

  

  

I an compare the situation tothat of ओमाङोश्च (पा॰सू॰ ६.१.९५) which applies to the case of अ/आ + आ\[ङ्\] = आ. When अ/आ + आ = आ is already available from अकः सवर्णे दीर्घः (पा॰सू॰ ६.१.१०१), what was the need of Panini to include आङ् in ओमाङोश्च (पा॰सू॰ ६.१.९५)? The need was to address cases like अद्य + अर्श्यात् = अद्यर्श्यात्. Had it not been for ओमाङोश्च (पा॰सू॰ ६.१.९५), we would have had the अनिष्ट form अद्यार्श्यात् by अकः सवर्णे दीर्घः (पा॰सू॰ ६.१.१०१).To extend अमि पूर्वः to coverअम्\[4\] (replacement of मिप्), one has to find a case where there would be a need for Panini to overruleअतो गुणे (पा॰सू॰ ६.१.९७) and अकः सवर्णे दीर्घः (पा॰सू॰ ६.१.१०१). Such a case does not exist to my information.
