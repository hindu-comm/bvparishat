That is true from the prakriyā perspective. From the darśana perspective, an additional aspect to be considered is would Pāṇini intend the rule to cover*tiṅ am*when it is not needed? The extension of *ami pūrvaḥ* to *tiṅ am* serves no purpose and would be *anarthaka* (this is what I attempted to show in my first response). But Pāṇini is not *anarthaka*:

  

प्रमाणभूत आचार्यो दर्भपवित्रपाणिः शुचाववकाशे प्राङ्मुख उपविश्य महता यत्नेन सूत्रं प्रणयति स्म। तत्राशक्यं वर्णेनाप्यनर्थकेन भवितुम्। किं पुनरियता सूत्रेण।

pramāṇabhūta ācāryo darbhapavitrapāṇiḥ śucāvavakāśe prāṅmukha upaviśya mahatā yatnena sūtraṃ praṇayati sma, tatrāśakyaṃ varṇenāpyanarthakena bhavitum, kiṃ punariyatā sūtreṇa.

  

So much so that when it appears Pāṇini is anarthaka, commentators take that as a jñapana: *idaṃ vyarthaṃ sajjñāpayati ...*

  

I will be happy if this argument of mine is critiqued.

Another point to be thought over is that no traditional commentary cites an example of tiṅ am under*ami pūrvaḥ.*

I would like to add that in this case, both views cannot be accepted at the same time. If*Bālamanoramā* is correct in considering अमि पूर्वः in *abhavam*, then Bhimsen Shastri, Pushpa Dikshita, et al are all wrong in considering अतो गुणे and vice versa.
