Dear Sureshji,  

A great initiative.The site needs an update as all files of DLI have either been moved or in the process of being moved to <http://dli.gov.in>  

Not sure if the scan number will be retained or even that will change. I am of the opinion that scan number will change based on a logic. One positive out of this exercise is that one will know the titles of the books they have digitized easily  

  

Regards
