Dear Madhavji and Ajitji,

  

This is a very important matter for all scholars interested in Indian studies. A lot of effort has gone into scanning many important books, but the fuller benefit of such digitization has not been achieved for the lack of proper catalogs. When Ivisitedmy alma mater IISc last time, I met with[Prof. N. Balakrishnan](http://www.serc.iisc.ernet.in/~balki/), and raised this issue of indexing. I didn't get a receptive hearing. He didn't show much interest in fixing the problems, and asked me to workaround the "minor" problems and typos.

  

Some of the Telugu enthusiasts tried to fix the problem for Telugu works, by preparing an independent catalog with links to DLI. They have so far cataloged6637 books out of about 25,000 Telugu books. There may be other efforts I am not aware of.

It would be great if the scholars on this list can volunteer to prepare similar catalogs for Sanskrit and other languages as well!  

  

Regards,

Suresh.
