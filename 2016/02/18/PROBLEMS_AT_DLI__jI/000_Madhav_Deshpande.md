Dear BVP Colleagues,

  

  For the past several years, I have noted the data-entry problems with DLI. When you search for Sanskrit books, thousands of books that have no possible connection to Sanskrit appear in the list. I have attached a sample search page, where not a single book has anything to do with Sanskrit, and yet for each book one sees Sanskrit mentioned in its metadata. Does anybody know why this massive sloppiness is happening at the DLI? Is there no supervision of the data that gets entered? I hope someone will look into it and take some action. With best wishes,
