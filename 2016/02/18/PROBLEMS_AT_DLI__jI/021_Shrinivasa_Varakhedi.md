The Deccon college dictionary project was in closing situation. The authorities and the department heads continuously cried for financial support from the govts. The persons in the projects retired. Now literally the project got deserted. Several time since last two years it is discussed in the grant-in-aid committee of MHRD. The Deccon college is also not ready to complete the project within 5-10 years and make it available on web.  
  
Somehow very recently the problem got a solution by Rashtriya Sanskrit sansthan's intervention with an mou. Now both sansthan and Deccon college will take the responsibility of digitalising the improving the dictionary. Hopefully the project will roll on now. One strange thing that Deccon college authorities do not understand the value of making the content available online in digital form. Probably they are afraid off.  
  
Best regards, Shrivarakhedi
