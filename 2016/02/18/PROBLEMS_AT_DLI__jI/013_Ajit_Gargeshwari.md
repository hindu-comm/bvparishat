Dear Sir,  
Please get The entire DLI Data That would several Terabytes in my opinion it would be requires more than 100 to 200 2 TB HDD is an estimate. Then we can form groups rename the files and ask DLI to Update their Meta.  
If we form groups of Volunteers and delegate the work with worked out master plan monitored and Supervised by a Sanskrit, Kannada Telegu bengali etc. scholars it will be achievable.  
  

As suggested let Bharatvani or any funding agency fund the project. These will be several spin off from such an undertaking we will know whats already digitized whats not digitized, The meta can be used as descriptive catalog of printed books and in many many ways. We can later take up OCRing of the texts and so on.  
  
This will be the greatest service in my opinion not only to Sanskrit scholars and scholars who study Indian History and culture but humanity at Large
