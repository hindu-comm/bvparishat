\<It would be great if the scholars on this list can volunteer to prepare similar catalogs for Sanskrit and other languages as well!\>  

That may not be a very difficult task. But the follow up will be difficult. The diacritics should be uniform and the postings alphabetical. It will be time consuming. I wonder if our members, with their own busy schedules, can afford to spend so much time and efforts.  

In any case I welcome such efforts.
