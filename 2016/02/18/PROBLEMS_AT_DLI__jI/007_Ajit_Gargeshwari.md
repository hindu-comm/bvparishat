Gretil/starit just type books and proof read them and they don't have millions of books. The problem with DLI the title were typed by people who could not read the tile of a book and there was absolutely no supervision. Their Scan quality is not uniform. They did not check for missing pages when they scaned a book. For indexingThey should have done as physical libraries do in a systematic way. Any way that's Make in India. What else can one expect from a goverment project?
