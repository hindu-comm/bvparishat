Dear all,  
  
Currently we are aware of the problems that are prevailing in DLI. Once I had discussions with prof Rajiv Sangal Ji the then Directorof Iiit Hyd the hosting institutions of DLI books. He had assured me to give the entire collection in a disc. However, since the data was huge I could not avail the transfer memory discs. He did assure to correct the database provided the support is extended by the scholars. Even now we can try for getting the entire data if anybody takes the responsibility. BTW, Sanskrit books must be available in separate folders as the books from Sanskrit institutions are indexed with the name of institutions.  
  
Secondly now govt of India has initiated a new project portal called Bharatvani. Let's urge the Bharatvani authorities to take it up as a new project either by utilising their funding or taking the of public in the model of wiki.  
  
Nobody else would be ready to bell the cat.  
  
Best regards  
Shrivarakhedi
