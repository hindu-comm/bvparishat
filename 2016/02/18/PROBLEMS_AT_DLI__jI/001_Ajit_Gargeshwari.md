Indexing at DLI is pathetic. I have written to their support but they say the cannot help as their meta has been incorrectly entered. You find Sanskrit texts if you search Spanish Language. Scan quality is not uniform Many pages will be repeated or missing The list of defects is endless. All their good work is useless for one cannot search in DLI. Perhaps we can collectively write to people who run DLI as given in this page and get it corrected.
