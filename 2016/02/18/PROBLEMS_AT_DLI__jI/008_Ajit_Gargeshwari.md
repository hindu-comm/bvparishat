Forwarding a relevant message. I request scholars to give a feed back and how everyone can volunteer and get this done I feel books are our heritage and its important to make the old books available to all scholars for the growth of scholarship at one place and [archive.org](http://archive.org) seems to be the best place as of now. They don't charge for holding any books or media we need to upload them to their site in a coordinated way by indexing the meta file careful to make the titles searchable to one and all.

Ajitji, Sureshji,  

  

I think it may not be worth our time to prepare an independent catalogue with links (like the catalogue of Telugu books at Telugu Wikipedia), as long as DLI authorities are not interested in improving the catalogue. As per the stats at DLI site, there are more than 35000 Sanskrit books in DLI collection. There would be an equal number of Indology books in English and Hindi. Considering the apathy of the authorities, DLI may disappear any day, like Sansknet project of Tirupati Vidyapeetha and many such digital repositories run by Indian institutions. If that ever happens, this catalogue would become futile.  

  

I feel the following  

  

1. To point out the errors in the catalogue entries of Sanskrit & Indology books to DLI team/representative who will implement the changes in their online catalogue.

2. In case the DLI authorities are not at all interested in improving the catalogue, a team of volunteers can upload Sanskrit-Indology books from DLI to [archive.org](http://archive.org) taking care that the meta-data are error-free. This may need the participation of a good number of dedicated volunteers and can be carried out only over a long period of time. Since [archive.org](http://archive.org) seems more reliable compared to DLI, the creation of an independent collection at [archive.org](http://archive.org) would be worth the effort.  



regards  
shankara

===Private mail  

I am copying this mail my good friend from Poona. His name is Sankara Prasada I would like to volunteer for indexing Sanskrit and Indological books at DLI What format do youwant Title by Scan number and link to the existing web page at DLI or how?. Please let me know in detail Thanks  

There is no use meeting [Prof. N. Balakrishnan](http://www.serc.iisc.ernet.in/%7Ebalki/) I know him well. To be frank he is the associate director and his hands are full. IISC is hosting DLI data DLI data really belongs to DLI
