Namaste,

  

North Indian manuscripts use various punctuation signs ex Devanagari. Dandas, Pushpika are the commonly used symbols.

I require details on description and function of these symbols from experts and manuscripts scholars.

I request to provide the system of marking punctuation including Jaina-nagari style.

  

The following signs likely to represent the given features. May scholars validate and substantiate more on this. 

1 &2.Separators-In generaltext is written continuously.Infew mss,asmall vertical stroke added above certain letters to marks.Sometimes double marks are used.What is the difference in function of these signs.

3.Sandhi mark- A mark similar to shape of avagraha is used either top or bottom to indicate sandhi.It is also used in Sharada script

4.Continuation mark- a mark which may indicate a word break at end of manuscripts.The sign is used when the scribe wishes to explicitly indicate a word break

of line. Also used in Sharada.

5.Gap filler- When spacing/gap occurs in the folios.In order to align to format.

6.Tippani- an annotation to the text,roughly corresponding to modern footnotes.A sign similar to equal sign marked above the character

7.Bengali-like anusvara is found in some manuscripts.What does this sign represents? How this is different from normal anusvara.

8.Jain invocation.It is used as invocation or auspicious symbol extensively in the beginning of manuscript.What is origin and name of symbol?Are there any functions to individual units.

9.pada marker.-In Nepal mss , a sign may indicate end of a pada in the verse.

  

Sample images are attached.

Apart from these are there any other punctuation signs.
