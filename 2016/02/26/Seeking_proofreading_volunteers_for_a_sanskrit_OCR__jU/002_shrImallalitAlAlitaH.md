The mentioned projected appears to have stalled in 2012. You may contact the developer to encourage him to develop that.  
  
This is another OCR project:

Another One:  
<https://sourceforge.net/projects/tesseracthindi/>  
  
We may encourage these developers to get a working OCR for devanAgarI.  
After testing these you may add them to your OCR description page as an option.  
  
BTW, I'm using Oliver's software to OCR important texts for personal use.
