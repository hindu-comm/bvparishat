Dear Sir,

  

Thank you for posting that interesting passage from the Śrīmad Bhāgavatam regarding the sons of Śrī Rāma’s brothers I had attempted to post the below message on bvparisat but it was not delivered. I thought you might find it to be of interest and, if you wish, you might post it on the list for those who were inquiring about this issue.

  

Best wishes.
