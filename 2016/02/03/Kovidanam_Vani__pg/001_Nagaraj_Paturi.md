Dear Sri Ghanashyam Akella,



Let me congratulate Rays LLC, Kovidanam Vani in general and you in particular for this commendable service to Vedic culture.



Since you solicited further corrections,may Ipoint out the following the glaringly visible mistakes:



1\. It should be वैदिक संस्काराः, not वैदिक् संस्काराः .वैदिक् is Hindi influence.



2\. The woman in the voice-over was pronouncing the hrasva ikaaraantas as deergha ikaaraantas.



3\. The interviewer said, नमस्ते भवद्भ्यः. Either ते or भवद्भ्यः , one is sufficient, both can not be used..



Congratulations once again,



Best wishes,



Warm regards,



Nagaraj
