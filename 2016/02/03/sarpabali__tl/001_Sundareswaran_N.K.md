The six mantras समीची नामासि etc. that are presribed by Baudhayana in his Grhyasutra for the Upasthana at the end of Sarpabali appear in the Taittiriya Samhita (5.5.10.1).These appear in the Maitrayani Samhita too (2.13.2) as reported by M. Bloomfield in his Vedic concordance.

This is the Baudhayana's passage:

समीची नामासि प्राची दिक् इति षड्भिः पर्यायैः हेतयो नाम स्थ तेषां वः पुरो गृहाः इति षड्भिः इदं सर्पेभ्यो हविरस्तु जुष्टम् इति चोपस्थानम् (BGS 3.3.10.6)
