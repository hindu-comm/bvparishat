नमस्ते,  
  
I would like to know from elders & scholars here that what is the criteria of conferring the title "महामहोपाध्याय" to a scholar. Does it solely depends upon the no. of books / works authored independently or is it based on quality of the research done on a particular topic from our scriptures / literature  
  
Also, what is the difference between "महोपाध्याय" and "महामहोपाध्याय".  
  
In telugu literature, it seems the 1st scholar to receive the महामहोपाध्याय from British Govt. was Sri.Vedam Venkataraya Sastry.
Surprisingly, some of the great stalwarts were excluded from this honour like Sri.Paravastu chinnayya suri, Sri.Puttaparti Narayanacharya etc. who were one of the greatest scholars of this century (as far as telugu is concerned).
