Dr. Akljujkar,

  

Your knowledge and kindness knows no boundaries. After the first 5 books on Sanskrit printed in Russian (see <http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/6748038>) last year I'm thinking about a collection of Subhashitas in the style of Boethlingk's Indische Spruche, only with word by word translation. So would be glad if you could verify the other verses / sources as well, before they go to print. Thanks again,

  

M.
