Dear Sir as all replied granthAkSarI is nothing then granthalipi which is also named as "pallava-granthalipi''. Even now a days there are some gurukulAs where the kRSna-yajurveda is only read by the same script. To know more and to get a script chart please check the below link. <http://www.omniglot.com/writing/grantha.htm>

or else there is a CD to learn grantha published by Dr. Viroopaksha jaddipal from RSVP Tirupati with special variants of the script with audio.
