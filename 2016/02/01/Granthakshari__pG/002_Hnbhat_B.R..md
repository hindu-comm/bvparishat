I think it is used for grantha script used in South India, especially in Tamilnadu and Kerala and South kanara it is known as Tigalari script and also tulu script as it is used to write Sanskrit. On google search I found it as granthakshari or granthavari.

But without knowing the context he met the word it is difficult to ascertain its meaning or correct form.
