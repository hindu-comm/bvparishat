"The Royal Temple Theater of Krishnattam"  
the revised and enlarged edition of a monograph (originally published in  
1993) has been published very recently by D.K. Printworld, New Delhi.  
(I am a co-author of the revised edition.)  
  
Krishnattam, a unique Sanskrit ritualistic dance-theater of Kerala, is based  
on the Sanskrit poem Krishnagiti by the Zamorin King Manaveda (17th century).  
  
More information about the book is available at the web page

Part of the purpose of this post to this community is to generate some  
interest in Krishnagiti, a wonderful Sanskrit Kavya with shlokas and padas  
set to specific ragas and talas.  
  
Sincerely  
A. Harindranath
