I totally agree with the respected Swamijis views we need to think about all possibilities and need to be tough at times to educate those who don't know or have been given incorrect information about our Sastras. If we are silent then there are people who will continue to give distorted information. I take this as part of my learning curve and not at all hurt My apologies if I have over looked the earlier mails. Please continue the discussions but all I can say is this while educating them lets educate them in Indian way accommodating all views while finally sticking to our view in the spirit of debate. Thanks to all  

As i have said please continue to post on this topic
