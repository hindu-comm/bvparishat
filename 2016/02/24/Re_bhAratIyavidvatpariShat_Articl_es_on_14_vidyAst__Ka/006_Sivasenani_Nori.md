Prof. Mishra

Jyotisha is a Vedanga. As such faith in Veda implies faith in Veda with all its angas.

There seems to be an implicit assumption in your post that scholars should not have faith. Many would disagree with that.

The doshas mentioned by you are vyaktinishTha not SastranishTha. Accordingly the individuals concerned are to be blamed, not Sastra. For instance, Capitalism has thrown up a huge number of tricksters and cheats. It doesn't mean that we abandon Capitalism.

Also, jyotisha is only one of the tools to decide an auspicious time; some follow Sakunas, some follow sankalpabalam and so on.

Finally, if I may say so, your statements hurt the feelings of believers. Should we resort to such a mode? Say I don't believe in one or the versions of Vedanta and observe that Acharyas of that sampradaaya are raising huge donations. Then, if I say "Should not the Indian scholar community take a stand on this (particular flavour of Vedanta, which in my view is misguiding people) and rescue people?" - what would be the reaction? More heat than light will be generated. I believe that this Forum's rules specifically prohibit it.

I submit that we should avoid such statements, however strong our individual convictions are on a particular matter.

What can be done, though, is that the counterview may be presented based on facts and reasoning.
