**The phrases like** : 1. *Nonsensical "gurus"* 2. *distortions of Hindu Philosophy*

**and the statements like:**

1.We mustthrow away the theory of "sin" that is imposed on people. and

  

2.*Throwing "sin" at people and perpetuate*

*external recourse to "clean" them appears "artificial" to me.*

  

3\. *India must extricate itself from the ritual shackles*

may hold good only in private platforms and not in public meeting places like this Bharatiya Vidvat Parishad. It is just alarming to see this kind of statements here.

  

**It is nothing but insulting and hurting the feelings of staunch believers of these thoughts as traditional yardsticks of Indian style of living.**

**1. Astrology 2. Gurus (What soever of their kind) 3. Rituals and 4. Sin and Virtue (Papa and Punya)** are the four pillars of Indian traditional way of living.

It cannot be denied.

  

**We have our own several centuries of experiences in our family traditions and several decades of experiences in our personal life where these four things have their major role to play and have been found worth trusting many a time. **

More over I could not understand how this kind of statements help us in enriching our knowledge of Sastras when BVP is strictly meant for healthy discussions on Sastra.

  

Hence I request the respected members who post this kind of statements to think of the presence of other members who are staunch believers of this kind of elements twice and thrice.

  

Otherwise I request the moderators to reintroduce the system of scrutinizing every post before it reaches the group.
