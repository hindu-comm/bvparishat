And what am I mis-interpreting? shAstra-s or logic?  

And how?

Sure, now apply this to common words/sentences too.  
So, when someone says that 'this is your mother', should also not be take seriously.  

Why?  

Both are words.

Should I keep my loyalty to shAstra-s and explain as they were received by me Or should I start behaving like an opportunist who changes his color to stay popular/center of attraction.?  

Why shouldn't I save my academic loyalty, just because a few of you are ashamed of your past or hate your ancestors?

You are again pointing person. Point to fault of shAstra if you can. Otherwise, stop here.

I'm not a Hindu in the sense you are. I'm follower of shAstra-s while you aren't.  

But, what does your Hinduism has to do with validity of some shAstra?  

You are not an authority on shAstra-s. So, why are you expecting that quoting Hinu-ness, can justify your deed(blaming shAstra-s)?\]

And, how did you reach the conclusion that no knowledge and no tradition is related to rituals? By not studying it?  

Why shouldn't we clelebrate karma-kANDa part of shAstra, just because some deceiver cheated you/your wife/your family. For that blame your/their stupidity, not shAstra-s.

Why not throw away a person from here who doesn't understand/learn 'cause/effect relation-ship?  

If you are continuing to show hard words for philosophy, don't expect soft words from us.

I call a person like you un-familiar with shAstra-s.

How ignorant you are? Don't you know that every religion has concept of sin, even that one which is converting others.  

Sin is not the basis of conversion. Have some time to shed away your ignorance.

Please.  

Instead of deciding meaning according to social condition

 and benefits you can earn, like chameleon; be honest as an academician.  

Take some time to study ideas and logic of traditional philosophers.

Does shAstra say you to become dumb. It's you who shut your intellect. So, blame yourself. Why are you abusing shAstra-s for your/people's failure to use intellect.

That he somehow chooses to not use.

I don't reach to conclusions about others so fast.  

Be careful.

Does that validate your abuse of shAstra?

  

Going temple is not a proof of your study.

I see how people justify their ignorance and hate towards rituals and philosophy.

bhagavAn know why you don't go for more dharma.  
  

If you have some logic, apart from chameleon behavior, please create a thread and all can discuss about that. I request you to stop declaring rituals as culprit of everything bad in this world in every thread of this forum. It's too much to bear.  

I request you to create a personal website to propagate your pet ideas so that you can correct 'ignorant Hindus'. But, please spare this platform.
