Dear Dr Nori,

  

Unlike Bible, our Shastra is an open architecture. One should respect the "moment" as is the new knowledge propounded by the Gita.

One can keep the faith without the artificiality of the ritualism. I am afraid we are making the country weak by using the "red book" on media

and letting astrologers control people's lives. .The scholars must be educators. We perform all activities in faith but don't let some "business person"

tell us that h/she would give us "liberation.". To reform the society is the task of the scholar.

  

The only activity Valmiki does in Ramayana using astrology is Rama's coronation, pretentiously contrived by Dasaratha. The story lets the

event fail. I have a feeling that the current practice of astrology in India is influenced by the Arabs with their insecurity to hold on to power. 

Our principle is the cosmology of yoga, that rejects external influence. The scholars must analyze and write views. We stay in yoga until

the theory itself evolves to something still transcendental.

  

The Vedasa themselves evolved through time. Many reforms have been adopted as new discoveries are made. I am not suggesting that

one abandonsपूजा or कर्म, but one developsश्रद्धा. I think the discovery the latter concept was a big transition in the culture. The scholars

may analyze the applicability in the larger expanse of the society. As scholars do, the society may do.



Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
