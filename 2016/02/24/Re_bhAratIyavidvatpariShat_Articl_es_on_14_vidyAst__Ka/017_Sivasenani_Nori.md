Prof. Misra

  

The bigger point - tAtparya - of my post was completely missed. Though it is distasteful, I am spelling it out.  

  

Any Sastra is acquired with great effort, especially Jyotisha. Varahamihira bemoans how scholars of other disciplines are bhagnayatnas when it comes to Astrology. After studying the Sastra under a competent guru for years, one has to go through thousands of horoscopes, predict and then verify one's predictions by keeping track of these people's lives to become a true Jyotishka. The verification part is required because there are a huge number of calculations and literally hundreds of decisions regarding which of the conflicting rules is stronger in a given place, and there are high chances that one might go wrong. This (apparent conflict between different Sutras) happens in other Sastras also, as seen recently in what अम् means in Vyakarana, but the occurrence is a thousand-fold greater in Jyotisha. Only after more than a decade of dedication would somebody say that "I know Jyotisha". Now when you go and ask such a person, "Sir, should we not rescue our countrymen from this fraudulent practice of Jyotisha", how insensitive is it? Say we do not believe in Homeopathy. How insensitive is it to ask a practicing Homeopath who studied for five years in a medical college, in front of thousands of people: "Look, everybody knows Homeopathy is not a valid system of medicine. Now, will you please tell me: should we not rescue our countrymen from this fraudulent practice of Homeopathy?" I wished to point this out as politely as possible, but I guess it was completely missed.

  

Sir, your utterance was very insensitive. You did throw in an off-hand apology in one of the other posts saying "Again, I am sorry if my post appears to convey insensitivity." but that is grossly inadequate because though the question was directly addressed to two learned members in a most insensitive manner, the apology was neither direct, nor an acknowledgement of wrong-doing. So the hurt caused - to both the set of gentlemen-scholars - and other believers remains.

  

I think the moderators should flag such remarks.

  

My specific replies are in line.

I am not a doctor of philosophy, so the honorific is misplaced. Kindly drop it.

That is one view, but please appreciate that it is not the only view. Faith means acceptance of guru and Sastra. Once one has faith, and lucky enough to have a guru with an unbroken lineage, then that faith cannot be delinked from the practice Scripture ordains. Veda says अहरहः सन्ध्यामुपासीत. Now, according to the believers, we cannot say that this is not a vidhivAkya and not do the vidhi. So, faith in Veda necessarily means acceptance that one has to worship SandhyA every day. Whether one actually does it or not is a matter of sincerity - in belief or action. There are some modern believers, neo Vedantins etc., who come up various logics to abdicate this responsibility. Some take the route of: "Ritualism was right in a certain place and time, it is no longer relevant. We should not take every sentence literally. What is SandhyA, now we know that it is a passing phenomenon? At any point of time there are two SandhyAs somewhere in the world, and perception of the phenomenon keeps shifting longitude by longitude." The problem - for the traditionalist - with this approach is that we cannot make up rules of interpretation on the go. If there is a set of rules of interpretation that will be consistently used, let it be presented so that it would be compared with Purvamimamsa which gives a set of rules on how Veda is to be interpreted and the better system may be adopted. People who cannot produce a complete set of rules of interpretation, and survive the examination of practice and theory that it entails, should not be mocking a system which has produced its complete set. These traditionalists can then show that the rules of interpretation, presented by the modern believer, are arbitrary and not applied consistently. Others, mostly neo Advaitins take the route of mAnasikasannyAsa and say something to the effect that "after the dawn of jnana there is no need for Karma, for Sankaracarya repeatedly asserted that there can be no mixing of Karma and Jnana." The answer would be: "Satyam. However, first please give up your bank account and show that all jIvas are the same to you before claiming to be a mAnasikasannyAsin. We are not necessarily asking you to wear ochre robes." So, for the believers, only those who have renounced the world have the option not to do rites while having faith. In this view, it is intellectual dishonesty to claim to say one has faith in Veda, but will not do rites. I don't want to accuse you of intellectual dishonesty for I perfectly understand where such a view (faith without artificial ritualism) is coming from and my intention is not to hurt you. All that I say is that one must understand that there is another view possible, and that one should not make strong statements to the effect that the modern view is the only view which obtains or the only one which is right.

What happened to scholarly humility? Are scholars so knowledgeable that they can educate traditional pandits? What are the underlying assumptions? I say traditional pandits because this set believes in Astrology. Now a scholar assumes that Astrology is mumbo-jumbo and is trying to educate these traditional pandits. If the intention is to educate lay people, again scholarly humility kicks in, for it is the work of a scholar to lay out what the facts and arguments are, and not make the decisions for the people. When that happens, horrible things result. If we can empathise with Adolf Hitler's thoughts about German pride, we will find a similar sincere desire to decide for the German people, what is good for them. And, now we know how horribly wrong such an approach was.

This is blasphemy. Vedas simply are, accordingly to the belief of Sanaatanis. Whether we accept them as apaurusheya or Isvarakrita, there is no evolution. The entire intellectual heritage of Sanaatanadharma hinges on this one point: Vedas are faultless and so are a pramANa. अनपेक्षो रवः श्रुतिः। They are faultless because they simple are, and do not evolve. This is what separates Sanaatanadharma from other heretic religions like Buddhism. Remove the basis, that is the reason why a set of teachings is true, and all the teachings will reduce to opinion of one man or a group of men.

We cannot have it both ways. Either one has faith and does Karma or one does not. Doing karma without faith is उभयभ्रष्टत्वम् . If one believes that Faith does not enjoin karma, one should not do it. If one picks and chooses which Karma is done, then one should not say that one has Faith. It will be like choosing from a menu in a restaurant.
