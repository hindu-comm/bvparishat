Sir,

You did not respond to my query at all; but that does not matter. I was not challenging or objecting to any type of Jyotisha, including Horoscopes, Lampaka, Tea-leaves, Tarot, and match making. Mine was limited to the attribute "Vedanga" given by some to their brand of "jyotisha", which leads to contradictions in classifying traditional Vedic terminologies. Not every detail may be available in the Vedic texts and hence I agree Smrti are important and such statements in them which do not contradict the Vedas, by inference, should have had their origin in the Vedas. But I am perplexed with the response invoking, Karma siddhanta, Shanti, Ramayana, Sahadeva, Vyaakarana, etc. Let me point out Suryaprjnapti-chandraprajnapti is a Jyoutisha belonging to the tradition of Jina Mahavira. it has many elements similar to Lagadha's VJ. It is pre-siddhantic and hence extremely important for highlighting the original history of scientific thinking in this country. But no one considers this as "Vedanga Jyoutisha". 

  

Thanks

RNI
