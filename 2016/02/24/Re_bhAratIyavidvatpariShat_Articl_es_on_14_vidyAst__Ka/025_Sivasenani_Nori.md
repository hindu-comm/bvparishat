Allow me pose counter-questions. What were the Vedangas before Yaska and Lagada? For pre-Yaska period, if we say kasyapaprajApati's NighaNTu is the Vedanga, what about before kasyapaprajApati? 



Vedangas like Vyakarana are Smritis (Bhartrihari says in so many words) and they are to be treated as per the elaboration in the SmrityadhikaraNam in Purvamimamsa.

  

Also allow me to pose certain clarifications, as I heard over the years. (Clarification: This "heard" is not to say that it is hearsay, but more like श्रुतम् - known from elders). Jyotisha is not opposed to karmasiddhAnta - mere prediction does not change the future event. Nor will performance of SAnti change it. SAnti is only for upaSamana. They say that if a nut of the palm tree (తాటికాయ in Telugu) is to fall on one's head, it would fall on one's shoulder if one does SAnti.

  

This is the reason why even the muhUrta fixed by VasishTha for the coronation of Rama was unsuccessful. The reasons for obstruction were so powerful, that even the utmost care shown by VasishTha went in vain. While on Ramayana, in the SundarkANDa, Sita is described as thin and weak, like the subject studied on pratipat (can't recollect the Sloka immediately, if you want it, can send it at end of day). So even going by the paradigm of dating Yaska, Lagada, Ramayana etc., Jyotisha was well known.

  

Further there is a story of a curse by Parvati devi to Jyotishkas that if they reveal what is known to them completely, then they would die. As a drishTAnta the episode of Sahadeva, a Jyoishka par excellence, is cited. Apparently, he knew the future completely but could not reveal it.

  

So, faith in Jyotisha does not mean faith in a particular Jyotishka, because he cannot predict the future completely due to the curse; also, he might make many mistakes. Many people might not consult Jyotisha because what is to happen is inevitable.
