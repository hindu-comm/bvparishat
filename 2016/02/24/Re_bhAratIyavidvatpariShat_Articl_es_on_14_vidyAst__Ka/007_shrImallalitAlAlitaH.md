As Sivasenani said, your post is not based on logic. I must say that you don't even know what you are saying.  

You proposed to abandon two dimensions in first sentence, but in the next sentence you are not presenting fault of any of them. Instead you pointed fault of people by saying that there is some wrong use of those shAstra-s.  

Is it shAstra-s fault that someone uses it for wrong purpose? If that is your logic, why not abandon everything starting from food.  
न हि यूकाभयात्प्रावरणपरित्यागः , न वा भिक्षुकभयात् स्थाल्यनधिश्रयणम् । Who blames and shuns cloths just because it sometimes becomes home to moths or who stops cooking just because of fear of beggar? Not a sane person definitely.  

So, stop abusing shAstra-s for fault of people.  

Learn to differentiate rules/books from followers and abusers.  
  

Only if you could show error in those shAstra-s you proposal can be supported. So, please try to prove them illogical, un-scientific. We will try to defend those shAstra-s then, and if failed we will shun those.

No, because it serves some purpose. Ask vaidika-s, they will say that it is needed to know about the time of some anuShThAna.  

Anything serving a single purpose deserves the tag 'useful'.  

If not, then I fear that even you and me will become 'waste'!  
How many things in this world are useful to all? Not all(including you and me), definitely.

What do you mean? Calculation were correct in past and now they aren't?  

So, do you want to tell us that Mathematical Rules also change?  

Or, do you want to say that nothing is gained by calculations?

What is the relation of artificiality and auspiciousness?  

advaitin-s know that whole world is illusory. So, what? Does that mean that illusory things can't produce any result? They are not so idiot to proclaim anything as such.  
  

So, how your this invention of artificiality is helping you understand that everything is 'auspicious'?  

BTW, what is 'auspicious-ness of a particular time'? And, how do you know that?  

If every moment is auspicious, why in-auspicious things, as war, accident, rape, etc. are happening? There must be no space for any such thing as every moment is auspicious in your view. So, let us no act as blind just for sake of abusing some shAstra-s (about which we don't know anything and hence hate)?

By doing what? By shunning the shAstra-s or by shunning the person who is making it's bad use?  
BTW, what is the job of Government and Courts; aren't they supposed to stop wrong things?  

Many scholars are students of those shAstra-s and have faith in them. Why should they shun the shAstra?  

  
You have problems with those who are making business of the shAstra-s. But even that is not justified. Aren't professors and teachers using their skills to earn money? Do you want to close schools and colleges also, because teachers are using them to earn money? BTW, aren't you using your skills to earn bread for your family? Or, are you expecting every scholar to beg alms after taking sannyAsa?

Wow ! Here you have revealed your hatred.  

Why should we not take some steps against you for blindly putting faith in hatred towards these shAstra-s?  

I think putting faith in religion is better than putting same in hatred.  
  

I'm not going to accept that you don't know how to express your views. I also don't accept that you wanted to blame people only and not shAstra-s. Actually, from your past posts anyone can deduce that you don't have any soft-corner for many shAstra-s.  

So, I'm also not stopping myself to question you in same language as you did to the whole community of scholars/followers of shAstra-s.  

  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
  

Now let me stop questioning Mr Mishra and try to point the actual problem.  
  

There are two types of faults to be considered:  

1\. Fault of shAstra (we easily shun such works, if needed in parts otherwise whole. you don't need to beg for that. Once a common person knows that something is wrong, he shuns it.)  

2\. Fault of Man  
  

For deciding fault of men, let us find who they are:  

Men are of two types :  

1\. Those who know shAstra-s correctly  

2\. Those who don't know  
  

People not knowing shAstra-s are of two types:  

1\. knowing a little of shAstra  

2\. knowing nothing  
  

Those all (who know/know little or know nothing about shAstra-s) are again of three types:  

1\. Liars (Trying to fool people to pose as know-er of shAstra.)  

2\. Indifferent  

3\. Abiding to truth, they tell only that which they have studied properly and know as correct.  
  

The first type is the problem, even if he is a know-er of shAstra. What to say about those who don't know shAstra?  

So, we must find them, stop interacting with them, etc. Government may be asked to prosecute such deceivers.  

I remember that Indra proclaimed about throwing fake/non-practicing sannyAsI-s in front of wolves. I don't expect anything similar from a secular government considering human-rights, but there are laws for prosecuting who cheat, pose and break trust. That may be enough. You just need to find such deceivers.  
  
  

BTW, 'People Ignorant of shAstra-s' are of three types:  

1\. Indifferent  

2\. Learners  

3\. Haters  
  

We need to point out haters and check their hurting activities, at least at this platform. They provoke calm people to react in harsh ways. Not-reacting to them is not an option now, when you are claiming BVP as platform for Sanskrit-Scholars(including traditional scholars).
