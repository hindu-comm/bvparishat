I understand that you are pointing to the word chameleon behavior. But, let me show that in the context:  
  

Here is the first use a few sentences above:

This sentence was for attitude of scholars towards explanation of shAstra-s.  
  
Now read second sentence:  



> If you have some logic, apart from chameleon behavior, please create > a thread and all can discuss about that

  

If you properly went through the post, it will be clear that I'm not talking about Mr Mishra when I use those words.  

I'm actually talking about the dis-honesty which he is expecting from traditional scholars.  
And, this justifies my uses of words.  

I don't know how moderators reach at such conclusion.
