Really. We stopped you to abuse us, we asked you to present logic; and you are saying that we don't allow you to question. Are you trying to fool us or you really don't understand anything going on here?

  

I don't think that Mr Mishra was asking questions. He was presenting his conclusions, and he was appealing us to coinciding with that and throw our shAstra-s.

  

I again say, don't try to show yourself as victim just because someone didn't allow you to kill himself.

  

If you have studied shAstra-s and have difficulty in understanding, then please discuss about that. Scholars will kindly provide their help. This attitude will not help you get answers.

  

If you don't know anything about shAstra-s and are just guessing unrelated things, why are you asking us to follow you and throw shAstra-s?

  

And, if you want to know, learn how to ask questions and learn to hear. What most of you are doing is just abusing and blaming. That's not 'asking question'.
