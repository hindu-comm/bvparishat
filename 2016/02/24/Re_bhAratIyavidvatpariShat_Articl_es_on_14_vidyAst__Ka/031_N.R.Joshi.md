Dr. P Ramanujan explained. I did not ask question to Prof Korada on Phalajyotisha. My question was related to atronomical days and time. Many Indians back home and abroad celebrate New Year Day, Deepavali New Year etc In India it is said there are Saadetina (3 and half) good muhurtas (I forgot which one now). Our children in USA ask question why our Hindu new year day is different from January 1. What reply will you give?



If somebody misuses knowledge of astronomy and astrology what you and I can do? They say we opened our shop. If you do not like our marchandize, you open your shop and start selling what you have. What is your reply?



Different people have different belief system. Dr. Murali Manohara Joshi was Physics professor (I imagine). Did he not support teaching Jyotisha in Universities? You are Physics professor ( I think). See how much difference between you and him? Who is right?



We need to be sensitive to feelings of other people. We expect more analytical Vimars'a for our traditional knowledge from highly talented scholar like you. Yes India has a lot of empirical knowledge. But we in India are not allowed to ask questions. Form is important there, not meaning. Pardon me for a long reply. Thanks. N.R.Joshi

Dear Dr Joshi and Prof Korada,

Should we not abandon these two dimensional skymaps? I see a huge counterfeit market in India based on

these "predictions". Is it not a full waste? It worked at a given time in history. Now we know that time

is an artificial entity. Every moment should be considered auspicious.
Should not the Indian scholar

community take a stand on this and rescue people from this artificiality and pretentious business?

Or is blind faith considered pure religion?   

Please comment.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
