Your expectation fits astronomy, etc. in parts; not wholly.  
There are somethings which are शास्त्रैकवेद्यम्. That's why asked your definition of auspiciousness and it's relation to non-realness.  

You skipped. That's another thing.

True for some shAstra-s with dRShTa-mAtra-prayojana. Not for veda-s.  

So, your objections should be directed to such shAstra-s only.

Really. Then what is 'auspicious-ness' of all time if it is not bearing/bringing good?

There is nothing called Universe apart from us and our vanity. We are parts of it.  

So, how does a thing comprising of selfish beings becomes benevolent.  

Your description is poetic and imaginary. It is not reality.  
  

I don't find something called Universe apart from us. If you have some such conception, present it here. We will check that.

I appreciate your thought. But, traditional scholars are also part of BVP. They may not have skills to do that.  

  
Again, there are few things commonly accepted among traditional scholars, as varNa determined by birth, etc., validity of veda-s, etc. which are not respected by most people. People don't give a chance to hear their position.  

In this condition, how do you expect that such people will come in front and start proclaiming something opposed to their learning/belief and teaching same to others?  

  
Traditional scholars are seen as idiots/fools if not fundamentalist. They are somehow following their tradition/shAstra-s.  

How could they come in front of you to teach that thing which you hate.  
  

Since, they are not commonly accepted as genuine scholar/ human, so they stay in their shell and follow their rules. They reveal only that much which is needed and doesn't make them villain.  
  

I don't think you will like their teachings. So, leave them as they are and don't request(!) them to abuse their own shAstra-s.  

  
Modern scholars, who learn shAstra-s but don't follow them, are numerous. They earn bread because of shAstra-s, but don't have enough(or even a little) faith in authenticity of the same. They comprise other group. You may ask them to do this work, since they are 'open'(!).  

But, even that is going to hurt traditional and they will oppose.

'Throwing Sin'?  

This is an expression which shows that you don't have any appreciation for 'cause-effect-relationship'.  

According to shAstra-s, nothing is without cause. Every pain/suffering is because of pApam(sin), directly or indirectly. Your present activity/decision just lead to that in many cases.  
No one chooses to suffer. So, you have to point at some agent which takes you there. It's not your desire or conscious activity. And, it can't be without any cause. So, what is wrong in saying that sin causes suffering.  
They are telling what they know/learn. If you have something to prove that wrong, please use that, such as logic. That will be good. Proclaiming as prophet is not good for any party, either traditional scholar or those opposed to them.  
  
  

If you are trying to say that he is lying, it is wrong.  
  

If you want to say that person should try visible means and psychiatrist and there is no need of dharma(yAga, etc.), even then we don't have any problem with first part. We never oppose taking help of visible means. But, if you say that there is no need of dharma or prAyashchitta, etc. , then you are actually opposing veda-s, mImAMsA, etc. We don't have any problem if it is only you and like who oppose the dharma. But, why are you asking all to take the same position, that too without having any genuine logic or study?  
  

  

Mishra Ji !  

My objection is related to certain point of your posts only.  

Whatever is good in your posts is respected.  
  

I'm also sorry for using hard words.
