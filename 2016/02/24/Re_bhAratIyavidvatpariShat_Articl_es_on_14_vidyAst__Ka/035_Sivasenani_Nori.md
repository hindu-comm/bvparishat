Sir

  

The response to your query is that Jyotisha is a Smriti. Rest are "clarifications" as stated. They are indeed extraneous if you are not challenging validity of Jyotisha as a Sastra. Sastra as a whole is a Vedanga, not a particular book of a Sastra.

  

In Vyakaranam, Niruktam and Chandas we get books which are universally accepted as the particular books in Sastra which are to be accepted as Vedanga. In Siksha, Kalpa and Jyotisham one book as such is not accepted. While making nirnayas regarding what is Veda, what is a Vedanga etc., we need to give heed to the practice as well. If we look at the performance of karmas today, sage Lagadha's Vedangajyotisha by itself is not sufficient. Something beyond that is definitely taken. Further, even though a Sastra is accepted as a Vedanga, not everything in that Sastra might pertain to the Veda. Does Chandassastra not include metres not found in the Veda known to us today? Does sage Panini not talk to optional forms based on region? So, it is very much possible for Jyotisha to include aspects not pertaining to the Veda.

  

In your original mail you stated: "only texts of Jyotisha before Yaaska can be taken as Vedaanga by the faithful" and then gave your opinion: "I do not see any reason, other than faith and belief, for treating texts such as Yavanajaataka and Brhajjataka at par with Vedaanga-Jyotisha". Let me be explicit, it is always a matter of faith that something is a Vedanga - be it Yaska's words or Varahamihira's words. We have evidence that Kashika tinkered with the Ashtadhyayi (or that other versions were tinkered with), but the Ashtadhyayi, or an adhyaya or two, would be recited during elaborate Pujas. Believers are more inclusive, due to the way the risk-reward equation is. Let's say some people believe that Srisukta is not part of Veda but is merely a composition of someone, say, Bodhayana. Now, if I chant the Srisukta, even if it were mere poetry, there is no harm that I am doing except maybe "waste" my time (which I would otherwise utilise to watch TV or read a newspaper maybe, which are in no way intrinsically more useful to me); however if Srisukta really were a part of the Veda and I do not give it the respect it deserves (say chant it in an unclean state etc.), chant it where it is indicated etc., then I am either accruing paapam, or losing an opportunity to gain puNyam. So, as a believer, if my father and his father and so on, or in the guruparamparA made this decision (that Srisuktam is a part of the Veda), my default behaviour is to go with them. I would require proof of a very high standard, much beyond speculation which most academic writing on such matters is, to change my behaviour. If that is called faith, then I have immense faith in my ancestors and gurus.

  

To my knowledge there is no claim that the contents of Vedangas should not be known to others - be it Jyotisha or Vyakarana or others as well.
