Dear Dr Joshi and Prof Korada,

Should we not abandon these two dimensional skymaps? I see a huge counterfeit market in India based on

these "predictions". Is it not a full waste? It worked at a given time in history. Now we know that time

is an artificial entity. Every moment should be considered auspicious.
Should not the Indian scholar

community take a stand on this and rescue people from this artificiality and pretentious business?

Or is blind faith considered pure religion?   

Please comment.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
