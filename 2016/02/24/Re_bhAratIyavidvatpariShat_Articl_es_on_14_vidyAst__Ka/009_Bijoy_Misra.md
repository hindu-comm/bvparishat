Dear Sir,

  

I am sorry if I irritated you. What I wanted to convey that the Vedas themselves declared that knowledge

is not literal but experiential. The Shastras are cumulative. Wars, disease or destruction do happen, but not

because of wrong positioning of stars but because of human greed and competition. The universe is most

benevolent, it is we who fail by holding on to our vanity, in my opinion.

  

That knowledge is not literal is India's contribution to the world. I have not read all the vedas and I would

love to know if the sentence is misquoted. I admire the deep knowledge and authenticity among our scholars,

but I think there is also a role of social leadership in helping the general public understand.

  

Again, I am sorry if my post appears to convey insensitivity. Throwing "sin" at people and perpetuate

external recourse to "clean" them appears "artificial" to me. This is my opinion of observing the country from

a distance in my limited view.



Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
