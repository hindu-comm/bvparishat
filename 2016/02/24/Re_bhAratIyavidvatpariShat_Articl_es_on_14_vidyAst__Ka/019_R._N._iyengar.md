Dear Sri Nori, "Jyotisha is a Vedanga" as you say is accepted. But elucidate up to what period of Vedic tradition परम्परा /सम्प्रदाय should we limit this definition. For example in Nirukta (1.20) Yaaska says  

![Inline image 1](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/263f0609417f47/image.png?part=0.2&view=1)![Inline image 2](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/263f0609417f47/image.png?part=0.1&view=1)

This statement if accepted as valid, only texts of Jyotisha before Yaaska can be taken as Vedaanga by the faithful. Lagadha's Aarca and Yajusha certainly come under this limit. Perhaps Atharvajyotisha even though it was not the composition of Lagadha can also be brought under this definition. Beyond this difficulties arise when

present day dominant Jyotisha of horoscopes is claimed to be Vedaanga. I do not see any reason, other than faith and belief, for treating texts such as Yavanajaataka and Brhajjataka at par with Vedaanga-Jyotisha. \[As an aside, the recent paper posted by Ashok Aklujkar contains a remarkable analysis of the above statement of Yaaska and Bhartrhari on Veda Revelation\].

  

thanks
