Dear sir,

  

Sorry to say that you are misinterpreting. Nothing should be taken literally.

You must find a way to connect to millions of youth in India who are led to

believe that income comes through astrology. Some nonsensical "gurus"

are doing "courts" to bestow "grace". These are all distortions of Hindu

philosophy. I am as much of a Hindu as you could be, but I am not bound

by some line in a text! India must extricate itself from the ritual shackles

and celebrate the knowledge and the philosophy of the tradition. We must

throw away the theory of "sin" that is imposed on people. I call it artificial,

self-engineered and unfortunate. Some other cohorts take advantage

of it to do massive conversions! I see a disease!

  

Any way, we differ. Let us hold on to our views. My views are formed

through many years of introspection. I may die with them! Astronomy

has a role, but not through two-dimensional prognostications! There could

be empirical connection to eclipses, day and night, morning and evening,

but life does not depend on a chart. Man is equipped with enough

intellect to navigate his/her life. You are your ultimate master like me!

You are endowed withबुद्धि

  

Sir, you are very wise man. I am only a student. I have been with the

local temple for thirty years. I see how our beautiful cosmology has been

reduced to insincere rituals. We need स्वल्पमपि धर्म. I call is
श्रद्धा

  

Best regards, 

  

Bijoy Misra
