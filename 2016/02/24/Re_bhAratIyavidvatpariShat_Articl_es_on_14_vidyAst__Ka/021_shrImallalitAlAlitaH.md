This is my personal observation about your personal observation:  

I've found that as soon as one starts asking question to others' view, you try to stop them and ask to talk off-line. I think this is against any serious discussions. Do you think that serious discussions have no place on BVP?  

I think for the same reason many have questioned your bias also.  
  

I think that I suggested Mr Mishra to start a new thread so that the present thread remain one-pointed.  

I also suggested him to present logic, instead of making peculiar demands to scholar.  

  

I didn't abuse him, while he was more abusive to shAstra-s and scholars and guru-s. And, if you go through tone of his old posts, his attitude towards tradition and scholars related to that is continuously expressed in such way, directly or indirectly.  

You close your eyes for that and then suggest me to correct my language without going through context.  

Now, the question is how can I put faith in your neutrality and maturity?  

I think that's why many people questioned your actions in past and in a separate thread about moderators.  

  

And, since one of your post was with Moderators cap, I also question understanding and neutrality of Moderators of BVP.  
  

Please, make it a place of discussion and give chance to traditional scholars to oppose at least.  

Just because you don't want to hear shouts from traditional scholars, you can't stop them; because you already allowed someone to insult them. This is partiality.
