Dear Prof Ramanan

  

The website<http://sanskrit.jnu.ac.in/> is for all computational linguistics related work that our group does in JNU. Since my primary affiliation is with Sanskrit, the server has been aptly named "sanskrit" (with three load sharing machines called "panini", "patanjali" and "katyayaya"). Ours is a java server with RDBMS as back end. Among other applications that we have for Indian languages, we also have an application that allows a consortia of 17 universities/institutes to create the resources for their languages directly on the server as per national standard. You are requested to kindly visit the site and offer your valuable suggestions for further improvement.

  

I do not see any competition or conflict between Indian languages, more so in the technology world that we are in. Sanskrit and Tamil share the same common Indian heritage and should try to prosper with the help that language technology community can provide them.

  

Thanks and with warm regards
