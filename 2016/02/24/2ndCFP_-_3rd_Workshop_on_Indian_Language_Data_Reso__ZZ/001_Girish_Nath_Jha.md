Dear Prof Ramanan

  

I appreciate your concerns. We have been organizing this event on LREC platform since 2012 and this is the third event. This gives us an opportunity to interact with the best in the field and learn from current best practices. Since LREC has not happened in India so far, organizing WILDRE in India has not been possible so far.

  

I understand that students have difficulty obtaining travel support for international seminars like these. However, since language technology is fast emerging as an industry of its own, the students are advised to explore options outside the traditional government mode also. I am sure an active researcher in NLP would be aware of such opportunities. We will also add some information on our website on possible sources of funding as and when we come to know of it.

  

Thanks
