WILDRE – the 3rd workshop on Indian Language Data: Resources and Evaluation is being organized in Portorož, Slovenia on 24^(th)May, 2016 under the LREC platform. India has a huge linguistic diversity and has seen concerted efforts from the Indian government and industry towards developing language resources. European Language Resource Association (ELRA) and its associate organizations have been very active and successful in addressing the challenges and opportunities related to language resource creation and evaluation. It is therefore a great opportunity for resource creators of Indian languages to showcase their work on this platform and also to interact and learn from those involved in similar initiatives all over the world. The broader objectives of the WILDRE will be

·To map the status of Indian Language Resources

·To investigate challenges related to creating and sharing various levels of language resources

·To promote a dialogue between language resource developers and users

 

To provide opportunity for researchers from India to collaborate with researchers from other parts of the world

WILDRE-3 will have a special focus on Demos of Indian Language Technology. In the past few years, as more resources have been developed and made available, there has been an increased activity in developing usable technology using these. WILDRE-3 would like to encourage and widen the Demo track to allow the community to showcase their demos and have mutually beneficial interactions with each other as well as resource developers.

WILDRE-3 will invite technical, policy and position paper submissions on the following topics related to Indian Language Resources:

·Corpora - text, speech, multimodal, methodologies, annotation and tools
