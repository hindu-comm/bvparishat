Dear Colleagues,  
  
You are all well-aware that a committee headed by Shri N Gopalaswamy, Rtd IAS and Former CEC, was constituted by Ministry of HRD to prepare a vision and roadmap document along with action plans for the development of Sanskrit in the nation. The committee submitted its report to Honâ€™ble Minister for HRD last week. I am herewith sharing the core part of that report - the vision document, which is the first part of the entire recommendation report.  
  
It is open for your reviews. Kindly find the document herewith.  
  
best regards,  
shrinivasa varakhedi
