"  
Though most of the states offer Sanskrit at 11th and 12th for Arts stream students, a very few states offer Sanskrit for Science and Commerce stream students, even if Sanskrit is there in the scheme of studies, it is only in the papers, teachers are not provided. The same trend continues at UG and PG levels and therefore it is also one of the reasons for the present disconnect between Sanskrit and Science & Technology."".....

This according to me is the main reason for the neglect. With most paying jobs remaining with that sector, students are forced to shun arts and seek Science and technology.
