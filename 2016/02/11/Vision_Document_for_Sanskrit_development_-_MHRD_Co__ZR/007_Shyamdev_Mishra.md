I do not know that who were the members of committee but I have an impression that either this is not full report or the committee could not address the issue properly. It seems that this report has rather being prepared on emotional ground (though it claimed otherwise). According to the committee,it looks like that the focal point of issue pertaining the propagation of Sanskrit, is the teaching methodology and the (less ability or) inability to learn or teach in Sanskrit.

Now I have some questions ( but right now I am asking only one) which I want to put forth to the forum and the members of the committee -

For last 10 years I have seen that the number of Sanskrit speakers( including teachers and students) has been increased drastically but ironically the quantity of Sanskrit "speakers" and quality of knowledge (in related *Shastras*) are in inverse proportion. (Anybody can do the statistical survey of thePh.D. submitted by those who are, according to this report, more equipped and suitable "Sanskrit-speaking" students to shed the light on the social impact or *Shastric* enrichment or even the propagation of Sanskrit those research works have made, to find if they have added even a trivial on such fronts. Another survey of sanskrit speaking interviewees & interviewer of sanskrit shastras can be or could have been done by the committee to know if their sanskrit speaking could ever enabled them to become a better scholar of the shastras).

In last 15 years of my teaching career I never found even a single student who has done better in Shastras after learning short cut methods of Sanskrit-speaking. In fact I experienced inversely. The moment they learnt sanskrit speaking, bemusing with their this new-earned skill, they suddenly lost their interest in Shastras.

I will rise another issues regarding this during course of time.
