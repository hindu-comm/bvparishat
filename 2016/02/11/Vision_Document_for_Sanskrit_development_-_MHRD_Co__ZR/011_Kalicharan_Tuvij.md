प्रणाम,

  

Normally I would have accepted your comments as wholeheartedly as avalid criticism and wouldn't reply. But since you specificallyasked for a response (why?), it would only be my pleasure and honour (though at therisk of diverging from the original post).

The "reports" given to the government by people's representatives, as also the "precedence", in a real world are more reflective of the dominant, mainstream, andpowerfulinterest groups. I cautionedthat the government's very purpose is to resist thistemptation to accept -the "report"and the "precedence" -and todirect its reourcesrathertowards enabling(minimally)the neediestterritory.

  

The efficacy of a teacher in a classroom is measured by the progress (however small)made by the student sitting in the last row.

  

This understanding is however,subtle, not literal: if the student in the last row starts makingdemands("reports" and "precedence") onthe class, then this isbecause he/ she is the powerful group, irrespective of his/ her seating seatingposition.

  

Words such as "national interests", "what people need" etc are loaded, so I willbetter notaddress these. Security, for instance,is also a commodityof value, which needs to be distributed to all citizens (with a minimum level guaranteed for the most vulnerable).

  

The point is, the comodity must have some inherent value and only then the question of distribution (governement's involvement) arises. So, there has to be inherent value in Sanskrit (material/ spiritual not the issue here) in order to help it get propagated in whatsoever manner. This is a most generic assessment of the issue, and certainly not a sweeping one.

That's why I added "arguably" in the statement, as something which though out of scope for the context still can be defended or argued about in a separate discussion.

  

Yet,for example, if a security guard commits a theft in the establishment he was assigned to guard, it is only reasonable to summarise the situation as "he joined as a security guard in order to commit the theft".

  

Likewise, Brahmins as a class successfullysafeguarded the written/ heard tradition, so the statement : the whole class was created in order to preserve the competencies.

  

A basic observation. I can be shown to being very naive here("aren't Brahmins supposed to be.."), andthat's why, "arguably".

  

Mango falls, and one says "it was ripe".

Governement has to, simply because it has money and power. Why, because Industry in India doesn't see investment in Sanskrit bringing any result (competencies) in foreseeable future, so Industry is out of reckoning.

  

Crowdfunding? Donations? This has been the model for thepast thousandyears. Now we have a country, and a political autonomy. "What next" is the question.

I cannot possibly disagree with this. Except that I am averse to using the word spirituality when speaking on a matter of urgency (though yet belonging to thecorporeal).

And all theses scenarios will inspirerespective"reports" and "precedences". This is the way world works, and generates prosperity for the producer/ dominant groups.

  

But Sanskrit isn't there yet. If there is a value inherent in Sanskrit, then society can benefit fromgeneration (by producers)and distribution (by government)of it.

  

There are three steps involved:

1\) finding out the value of Sanskrit (research)

2\) producing the commodity (industry)

3\) minimaldistribution (governance)

  

The responsibilities 1) and 3) squarely fall on the government. However, it can simplychoose to ignore. Or, give in to "report" and "precedence",that are nothing but the demands made by vested interests, who benefit from status quo.

  

I said that the government must not choose either of these two options (ignore, & status quo). I said that Sanskrit does encode competencies of the nativesof India, the "back benchers".

Teachers are the last leg of Research. Teaching can be included in the spectrum of research (even softwares are good at teaching).But research precedes teaching, it precedes even the production step (no. 2 as mentioned above).

  

I already said "open ended". This generally means that for even the smallest of useful outcomes, for example an effectiveinput method for Indian scripts, deepest research efforts in Sanskritare required. "Open ended" also means, "letthe problems themselves decide themselves". Or, "as the research took shape", and certainly not as "advocatedin report,or aprecedence".

I am not supposed to articulate the language model for Sanskrit in this thread itself(but in another thread I've done that, and will be happy to interactthere).

The answer is "yes" to all of these.

By collective failure I meant failure in many fields of activity, many of which have nothing to do with Sanskrit per se, yet I argued that fromwithinSanskrit some oftheroot causes can be indeedidentified and remedied. This comes from the knowledge of thereal world. While addressing Sanskrit research, it is thereforeimportant that we address the backbencher -with an eye on production and distribution -and not those who benefit from status quo even in this field.
