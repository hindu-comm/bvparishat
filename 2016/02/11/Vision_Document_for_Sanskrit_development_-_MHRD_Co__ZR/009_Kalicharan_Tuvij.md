नमस्ते ।  
  
Governments exist solely for the purpose of redistribution (in a minimal manner) of commodities. The commodity can be anything: wealth, skill, knowledge, justice, roads, medicine, law, etc.  
  
In case of Sanskrit, as things stand today, is there something of worth to redistribute?  
  
A whole class of professionals (Brahmins) - arguably - was created in a remote past to preserve some core competencies, using Sanskrit as the media. But we are done with that. The preserved heritage is now here with us. So, what next?  
  
The next thing is to uncover the treasure (which was so painstakingly preserved) by constituting elite research. Going by the present state of the art, this effort alone should take at least a hundred years to be fruitful to any extent. At the worst, we would know if investing further resources in this direction would be beneficial or not.  
  
The need is doing research, not teaching. The need is for researchers - problem solvers - not teachers. Distribute solutions, not problems.  
  
Language is meant to be a facilitator, it makes us do other things easily or precisely. Today this is far from true in the case of Sanskrit. It is so difficult to master that the process itself consumes all the time. On the other hand, this situation has resulted in a serious lack of communication, and a poverty of ideas and innovation, in all the other fields (including ones related to survival) within country. In hushed tones many are already talking of the end of the Indian story.  
  
So, of course this rote based learning of Sanskrit is the wrong way, and moving in this direction only furthers harm (already evident). Sanskrit itself is not understood; its practitioners unknowingly propagate its own demise. If and when Sanskrit is understood, it can only be as a natural language (evolved or enlightened, besides the point) fit to be spoken by the specialists and the laymen alike.  
  
The government should rather direct resources to creating and sustaining open ended Sanskrit research facilities, in a publicly transparent and accountable fashion, also instituting necessary field work involving activities ranging from data collection to even collaboration with wanderers and sadhu-s.  
  
What could be the focal points? It could be that not a single line of Vedas and allied texts has been understood or translated correctly till date. Or it could be that Indians need man-making integrated within their education system. Or it could be just finding the root cause of our collective failures. Or it could be the question of survival itself.
