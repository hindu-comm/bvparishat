Dear Prof. Varakhedi,  
  

It is a good document. My only difference would be to reduce thrust  

for "international" etc. In Sanskrit, India must become the center.  

Rajiv M strongly argues about it and I am in total agreement.  

People outside are more interested in comparative theology or philology  
and not in Sanskrit research. The knowledge in Sanskrit is meager.
There  

is no emphasis on recitation and the power of sound that is key  

to Sanskrit.  
  

Please encourage to create good research centers in India. India  

must create critical scholars who may create deeper analysis of  

meters, phonemes, grammar, alphabet and recitation. These are  

original to India, outsiders have no clue. Philosophy, logic and  

literature have to be studied not like rote as they do now, but more  

analytic. Good journals must be produced in India. Give it five  

years time.  

  

I thought we should start the process right here in BVP. I would  

encourage all senior scholars to post a paper or talk about research  

ideas every six months. BVP is a great forum. I think it has  

more potential than it is used for. Let it create the nucleus of the  

future creative research in Sanskrit studies in India.  
  

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
