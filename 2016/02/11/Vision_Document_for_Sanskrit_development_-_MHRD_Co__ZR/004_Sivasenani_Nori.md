The first instalment is very encouraging, in that the problem is lucidly articulated avoiding extreme positions (such as views that proponents of Spoken Sanskrit do not care about grammar, or that scholars in academic ivory towers cannot converse in Sanskrit). They say, knowing the problem is half the solution. Here's hoping that the spirit seen in the Introduction is carried through-out and more critically, that the ten year vision would be implemented. Already there has been a steady movement towards writing Sanskrit examinations in Sanskrit only; starting with MA, it's come down to Intermediate level, in Telangana at least. So hopefully, the next 5 lakh Sanskrit teachers would themselves be well-conversant and in turn make the crores that they will teach more familiar with Sanskrit.
