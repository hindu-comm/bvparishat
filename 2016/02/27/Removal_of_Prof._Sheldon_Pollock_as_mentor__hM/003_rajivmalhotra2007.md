My own views on this matter, as expressed in my book, are as follows:  

1.  There are *positive* reasons to use the Murthy project as a way to
    revive the ecosystem in India for Sanskrit studies, translations,
    etc. This logic has nothing to do with criticizing Pollock.
    Developing a Swadeshi Indology "industry" could be a feather in
    Murthy family's cap just like their role in the development of
    India's software industry. 2.  On Pollock: My book complains against the insiders' lack of
    purva-paksha and uttara-paksha. I make clear that Pollock has not
    prevented them from doing this. So he is a worthy purva-pakshin we
    must utilize as a mirror to upgrade ourselves.
