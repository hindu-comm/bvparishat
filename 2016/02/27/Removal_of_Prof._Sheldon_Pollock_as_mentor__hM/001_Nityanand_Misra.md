There is an ongoing discussion on the Indology list on this topic. The petition has certainly unsettled some members in the Western academic world. Given the combined weight number of 132 scholars (many among the top scholars of Sanskrit and Indology in India) and the number of signatures (9,500+ and counting), Mr. Rohan Murthy's would do good if he at least responds to the petition. In the UK, a petition with more than 100,000 signatures is eligible to be brought up in the House of Commons.

  

We are living in interesting times!
