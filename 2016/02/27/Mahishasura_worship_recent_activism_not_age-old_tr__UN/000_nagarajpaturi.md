Santhals live in several different states of India apart from West Bengal.This community has been thoroughly ethnographed andstudied, right from the early colonial period. There are a very big number of publications and there isa huge amount of web material about this community.None of this mentions Mahishasura-worship. In fact all this material shows that the 'religion' of Santhalsisindigenous and has no influence of 'Hindu' elements.



There was the famous rebellionby Santhals against the British. A Durga worship begun during that movement formed into anew tradition from then and has been in practice for the last 100 years.
