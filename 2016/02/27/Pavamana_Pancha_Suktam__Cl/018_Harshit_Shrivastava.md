I am very much thankful for all the replies. The link to manuscript provided

by shankara sir, gave the following results:

  

The starting is with theपुरुष सूक्त(10.90.1-10.90.16)

  

Then the pavamana sukta is divided into five chapters:

  

\[Ist chapter\] - \[09.01.01 - 09.12.09\]

  

\[IInd chapter\] - \[09.13.01 - 09.43.06\]

  

\[IIIrd chapter\] - \[09.44.01 - 09.64.30\]

  

\[IVth chapter\] - \[09.65.01 - 09.67.32 + khila mantras (phalashruti) (only the last mantra of phalashruti is absent)\]

  

\[Vth chapter\] - \[RV 10.126 (complete 8 mantas) + RV 10.119 (complete 13 mantras) + RV 01.164 (अस्य वामीय तत्वज्ञान सूक्त, complete 52 mantras)\]

  

According to the manuscript, this is the pavamana pancha sukta.
