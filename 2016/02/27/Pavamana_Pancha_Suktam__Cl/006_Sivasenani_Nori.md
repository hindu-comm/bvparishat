Sir

  

Have you heard or read any Vedic scholar referring to the entire Mandala, or the collection sent by you as pavamaana-panca-sUkta? If so, where and in what context? That information might help resolve the question.

  

9.97 is the longest Sukta in the Rigveda with 58 Rks.

  

Regards

N. Siva Senani
