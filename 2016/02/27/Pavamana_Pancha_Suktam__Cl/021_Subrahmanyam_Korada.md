नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Now, in one of the replies given by Korada Sir, .दत्तचरितस्य चतुरध्यायपारायणानन्तरम् is one

of the given context. Does this mean after every four chapters of Guru Charitra or something else?

                  -- Vidvan Harshita Srivastava

  

Frankly speaking - I do not have any knowledge of the work दतचरितम् or the दत्तसंप्रदाय । I just produced whatever my cousin brother said in this regard. He is also not a follower of दत्तसंप्रदाय ।

So mine is श्रुतपाण्डित्यम् ।

But as the term suggests it can be after each four अध्यायs - this is subject to the decision of experts in that संप्रदाय ।

  

Better to contact any पीठम् - preferably the द्त्तपीठम् at Mysore - विद्वान् वंशीकृष्णघनपाठी may throw some light on this .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
