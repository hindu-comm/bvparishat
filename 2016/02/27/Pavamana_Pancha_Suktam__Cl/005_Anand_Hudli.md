Dear Scholars,

  

Given the length of the PavamAna sUkta, it is possible some prayoga traditions have included only a small selection of the entire collection of67 sUktas. The Rigvedic proyoga that I am familiar with,quite popular in southernKarnataka by the nameश्रीनृसिंहप्रयोगपारिजात आश्वलायनपूर्वप्रयोग,includes a small selection (7 sUktas)of the full PavamAna sUkta as part of the udaka shAnti ritual. However, when a regular PavamAna homa is done, it must include all the 67 sUktas, not less.

  

Anand
