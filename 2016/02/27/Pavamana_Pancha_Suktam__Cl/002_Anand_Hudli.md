The Pavamana sUkta includes all the suktas from 9.1 to 9.67. It is also necessary to also recite the PavamAna Khila hymn after 9.67. But given the weaknesses

of humans, Shaunaka, the author of RigvidhAna says a weak person (ashakta) may recite 9.66 and 9.67, the last two suktas of the fourth adhyAya.

One proper recitation of the entire PavamAna takes roughly an hour and a half. The PavamAna homa is performed with the mantras of the PavamAna sUkta. The sankalpa of the homa states: "pavamAnAtmaka shrImahAviShNuprItyarthaM pavamAna homaM kariShye". The dravya of the homa is "tilamishra-Ajya", ghee mixed with sesame, (or just ghee in many instances). The PavamAna sUkta is a very potent suKta for purifying one from sins just as the Rudra adhyAya is for the Yajurvedins. The PavamAna sUkta is also recited during Pitr-karmas to please the Pitrs.

  

The sUktas 9.68 onwards until 9,114in the ninth maNDala form what is called the pUyamAna sUkta. There is a tradition among Rigvedins to recite the PavamAna sUkta on ekAdashI days, followed by the pUyamAna on the dvAdashI day. The entire ninth maNDala is unique in that it is dedicated to Soma, as per the sarvAnukramaNi vAkya and sAyaNAchArya's comment, "navamaM maNDalaM pAvamAnaM saumyam iti vacanAtpavamAnaguNavishiShTaH somo devatA." The 114 sUktas are said to be divided into 7 anuvAkas, where each anuvAka has predominant chandas. For example, in the first anuvAka consisting of sUktas 1-67, the predominant chandas is gAyatri, in the second anuvAka consisting of sUktas 68-86, the chandas is jagatI, in the third anuvAka of sUktas 87-97 it is triShTup, etc.

  

In the shrauta context, the pavamAna hymn finds application in the soma yAga, as per sAyaNAchArya's comment, based on the AshvalAyana shrautasUtra,

ग्रावस्तोत्रेऽर्बुदसूक्तस्य प्रागुत्तमाया इदमादिकं सर्वं पावमानं विकल्पेनावपनीयम् , सूत्रितं च

  

Finally, among contemporary Vaidikas, some believe the pavamAna sUkta is addressed to mahAdeva (oneaccompanied byumA is soma), while the pUyamAna is addressed to mahAvishnu. Still others believe the pavamAna is addressed to vAyu. We should take this in the spirit of the mantra, "ekaM sad viprA bahudhA vadanti".
