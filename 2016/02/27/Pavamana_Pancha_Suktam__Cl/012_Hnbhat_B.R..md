So including the 5th Sukta, the four Suktas beginning with स्वादिष्ठया is called पवमानपञ्चसूक्त. Excluding the fifth, it is called पवमानसूक्त only and notपवमानपञ्चसूक्त. Confusion raised is now cleared regarding naming the question.

Only the details of the fifth Sukta and Mantras in it would be helpful.
