In the ninth mandala of rigveda there comes pavamana pancha suktam.Upon

searching the internet I found one soft copy which I already attached in this

post. According to this file it has 67 suktas having 610 mantras in total. I don't

understand that why it is called as pavamana 'pancha' suktam? Also is it the

longest suktam of all the four vedas or a collective name given to a bunch

of suktams having pavamana mantras in the ninth mandala of rigveda??
