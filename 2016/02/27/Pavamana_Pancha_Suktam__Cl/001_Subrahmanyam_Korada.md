नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

According to this file it has 67 suktas having 610 mantras in total. I don't

understand that why it is called as pavamana 'pancha' suktam? Also is it the

longest suktam of all the four vedas or a collective name given to a bunch

of suktams having pavamana mantras in the ninth mandala of rigveda??

  

                      ---- Vidvan Harshita Srivastava

  

  

It is confusing ---

  

The ninth Maṇḍalam is called Pavamānamaṇḍalam as all the Sūktas here address Pavamānasomadevatā (the deity called Pavamānasoma)  

  

[http://ancientindianwisdom.com](http://ancientindianwisdom.com/vedas-and-vedic-system/vedangas/jyoti%e1%b9%a3am)  

  

There are 114 Suktas in ninth Mandalam and 1108 ऋक्s .

  

It starts with --

  

स्वादिष्ठया मदिष्ठया पवस्व सोम धारया ।

and ends with --

तत्र माममृतं कृधीन्द्रायेन्दो परिस्रव ।

  

Eighth Mandalam has got 1636 ऋक्s in 92 Suktas.

  

गणानां त्वा गणपतिम् -- seen in the snapshot as the first ऋक् is in 8/23(1) 

  

It may be noted --

  

the ऋषिs of these Suktas are not new - गृत्समद etc , the द्रष्टs of the ऋषिमण्डलानि from 2 nd to 7 th , in the same order, are taken . Therefore it is assumed that the 9 th Mandalam is compiled by putting together all the पवमानसोमदेवताकसूक्तs from ऋषिमण्डलs .

  

My information is from the books of TTD (Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam) and other ऋग्वेदसंहिता published from Andhra .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
