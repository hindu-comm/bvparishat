I have a pavamAna homa manual by Shri Dhali Lakshminarasimha Bhat, which contains 5 Rigvedic sUktas in addition to the PavamAna itself. These are 1) Purusha sUkta 2) Vishnu sUkta 3) नतमंहोसूक्त 10.126 4) इतिवाइतिसूक्त 10.119 and 5) अस्यवामीयसूक्त 1.164.

  

The author has mentioned these are the पवमानपंचसूक्तानि. So this solves the puzzle of the PavamAna Pancha Sukta, I hope.

  

Anand
