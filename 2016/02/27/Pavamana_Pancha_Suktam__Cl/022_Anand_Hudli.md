I could not find any textual reference but I have heard priests talking about this, when I participated in a PavamAna homa. As far asshaunka's RigvidhAna is concerned, there is no mention of shiva or vishnu. In one of the verses dealing with the pavamAna sUkta, he does mention Agni, Soma, and Sarasvati.

उपोष्याज्यं च जुहुयादग्निं सोमं च पूजयेत् ॥३.१६॥

सरस्वतीं चार्चयेत पयोऽम्बुमधुसर्पिषा।
