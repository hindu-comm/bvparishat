Sivaseni Sir, I first read the term "pavamana *pancha*suktam" in the comments

section of a youtube video of pavamana suktam. Then some time afterwards,

I read the following facebook post:

](http://goog_1487972451)

<https://www.facebook.com/vedanidhi/posts/204276252972588>  

  

In it there is a section which stated clearly:

  

> *The famous and auspicious Pavamana Mantras in the ninth Mandala of > Rigveda, are 610 in number. The Mantras are well known as Pavamana > Pancha Suktas.*

  

I tried for an explanation from Vedanidhi & Datta Peetham, but I didn't get the reply.

The file which I uploaded is having *610* pavamana mantras in 67 suktams.

Anand Sir also clearly replied that that the pavamana suktam includes all

the suktams from 9.1 to 9.67. Thus it is verified. But the mystery of "pancha" continues.
