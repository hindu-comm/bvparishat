Namaste Anand-ji,

  

You said :

Finally, among contemporary Vaidikas, some believe the pavamAna sUkta is addressed to mahAdeva (oneaccompanied byumA is soma),

  

Can I know if there is any reference for the above say by Vaidikas, I heard Shaunakahas listed this in his book.

Could you please provide the reference if you have.

  

Regards

Ramachandra
