Namaste,

  

A very similar slokam in a dialogue of Lord Sri Krishna with Garuda, is found in the Garuda Puranam 2.48.41 -

मिष्टान्नदाता चरिताग्निहोत्रो वेदान्तविच्चन्द्रसहस्रजीवी ।

मासोपवासी च पतिव्रता चषड्जीवलोके मम वन्दनीयाः ॥

  

Jaimini Maharishi has provided a very detailed prayogam for celebrating the satabhishekam through the establishment of kalashas with the

sacred waters, sanctified by the recitation of key samaveda-mantras, punyahavachanam, upacharams, and prescribed homam offerings to

Agni, followed by the anointment of the dampathi with the consecrated waters - this procedure is very much in practice of the letter, even today.

The Maharishi stresses that one who follows this is blessed with good health and prosperity, deliverance from papa-karmas, and ultimately, the attainment of Moksham.

  

Regards,

-Shreyas
