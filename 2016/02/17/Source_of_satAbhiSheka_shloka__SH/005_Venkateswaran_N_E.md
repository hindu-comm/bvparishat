A person who has lived for over 80 years is considered a sahasrachandradarshI.  
The calculation of 1000 moons is as follows.  
Full moon is seen every 29 days. After 80 years and 1 month (approx) = (80 x 365) +32 days = 29232 days divided by 29 days = 1008 full moons would have been seen by a person and hence 80 years is celebrated in a grand manner especially in South India, to get blessings from the person who is a vandanIya of Lord.
