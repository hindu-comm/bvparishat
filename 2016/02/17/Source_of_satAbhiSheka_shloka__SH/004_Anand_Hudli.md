Here is the roughcalculation, assuming a lunar (actually luni-solar) calendar.

  

Every year there are 12 lunar months and hence 12 full moons. Every three years there is an adhika mAsa, so there would be 13 full moons every three years. A person who is 81 years old would have lived through 81 X 12 = 972 full moons plus (81/3) = 27 full moons, which makes a total of 999 full moons. So when this person is 81 years and 1 month old, he would have lived through 1000 full moons. It calls for the sahasrachandradarshana shAnti.
