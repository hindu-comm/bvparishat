When one is 80 years and few months old, the person is considered चन्द्रसहस्रदर्शी .

There is a popular shloka recited by purohits during satAbhiShekam performance (80th birthday) as Lord Krishna's response to Rukmini Devi when she asked him "Swami, the entire world worships you. Whom do you worship?" Krishna says : I worship the following 6 types of mahAjanAs.

  

नित्यान्नदाता तरुणाग्निहोत्री

 वेदान्तविच्चन्द्रसहस्रदर्शी

मासोपवासी च पतिव्रता च

 षड्जीवलोके मम वन्दनीयाः \|\|

  

I am interested in the source of this shloka.

  

Thanks in advance

Venkateswaran N E
