Dear Shri HnBhat BR,  

 The five-fold definition of interpretation given by you is very great! Thanks for sharing. Is it from some ancient text? If so, may I know the name of the text and author?  
  

We people, trained in the Western tradition of literary analysis, always talk of Wordsworth, Dryden, Dr. Johson and Eliot etc. but are not aware of our own tools of analysis. This Forum is a great resource for learning our own tools.  
  

Dogra, Chennai.
