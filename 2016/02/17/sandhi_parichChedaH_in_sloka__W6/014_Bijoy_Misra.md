Dear Prof Korada,

This makes sense.

I do twice a month recitation of Valmiki to experiment

how it might have been presented to the public as was

possibly the case. विलंबितवृत्ति very much comes in

play since the majority so far has been करुण. Lately

I am trying to create dramatic stage presentations where

further customizing does come in. The goal is to keep

the text in tact and create "screenplay" through the lyric.

Your instructions serve as a guide.

Best regards,

BM
