नमस्ते ।  
  
In my opinion (not mainstream):  
  
1) Sandhi between words was originally used to compress data in metrical norms. This compressed, metrical, data was easier to memorise and preserve.  
2) Sandhi was originally allowed only as internal sandhi to construct virtually any Sanskrit word (including declension) from roots etc.  
3) Internal Sandhi was meant only for specialists.  
4) As a validation of 1)-4) consider the fact that external Sandhi has not been observed in other IE languages (other than Iranian).  
5) On the other hand, "external Sandhi" is found in some so called lesser evolved ("primitive") languages of the world where sentences consisting of single, aggregated, word are normal.  
6) In light of 5) and also due to the fact that there is some (possible) loss of data in compression (a word breaking up in more than one way) resulting in ambiguity, external Sandhi cannot be said to be an integral feature (other than for data compression) of an evolved language such as Sanskrit.  
7) This data compression helped preserve our valued heritage. Now all that - stored on computer disks - is not going anywhere. The focus of Sanskrit learning and research should totally shift now to the meaning part.  
8) Mantras are triggers that connect us to various deities. Moreover, the word shabda means that in Shruti, the word is the minimum unit while the sentence is the maximum context. This is the definition of mantra, too.  
  
To conclude, external Sandhi is a carryover from data compression days, and shouldn't be used just because it gives one the sense of linguistic prowess. Instead, this urgency will be well directed towards creating new words - using internal Sandhi primarily - for modern world objects.  
  
In mantra meditation, it is well advised to chant the words in random orders (that is, not necessarily in the order given in the text): if the mantra still makes sense, then the text is Shruti.
