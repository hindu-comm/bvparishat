Dear Sri Kalivardhan,  

 I am not an expert, but a learner. And I think a learner can guide better than an expert because he knows where the shoe pinches.  
  

I have used Ramayanam and Srimad Bhagwad Geeta in a big way to learn Sanskrit. For this, I first split the words by removing the sandhi. Then, I change the poetry into prose. This makes the sentence simpler to understand.  
  

For example, the following shlokah can be simplified as shown below:  
  
तपस्स्वाध्यायनिरतं तपस्वी वाग्विदां वरम् ।  
नारदं परिपप्रच्छ वाल्मीकिर्मुनिपुङ्गवम् ।।1.1.1।।  
  

तपस्वी वाल्मीकि तपः स्वाध्याय निरतं वाग्विदां वरम् मुनिपुङ्गवं नारदं परिपप्रच्छ।  

  

As the students learns more and more of the language, he is able to handle sandhi and the poetic format without any difficulty.  
  

Therefore, in the initial stages, we should try to simplify things. If we burden the student with difficult sandhi patterns and poetic patterns, the students gets discouraged and gets a feeling that he will never be able to learn Sanskrit.
