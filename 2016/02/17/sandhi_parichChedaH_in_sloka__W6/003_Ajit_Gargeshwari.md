Satish Kumar Dogra ji,  
  

Yes its good to simplify. The questions was about shastric way of recitation and not a beginners exercise. Even a beginner first learns the correct pronunciation and later on he learns sandhi, prose order etc. If one wants spiritual efficacy by paranayana and recital then there is a shastric way to recite.
