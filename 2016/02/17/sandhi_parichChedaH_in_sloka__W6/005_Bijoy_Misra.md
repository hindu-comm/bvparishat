Dear friends,  
  
I am not a scholar of this, but more of a practitioner. I would disagree.  
सन्धि is a part of impact of ध्वनि sequencing, it is not a part of the semantics.  
I would consider it is an artifact of expression, presented in scripting as a guide.  
सन्धि should be considered different from संहति which is the impact of the वर्ण.  
The latter carries semantic content in its processing and comprehension.  

  

I observe that सन्धि indeed could be needed to keep the छन्द. At least this has  

been my empirical experience through the Gita, the Ramayana and similar  

classical scriptures. I have not been coached on the rules and the nuances. .  

I beg to be corrected.  
  

Best regards,  

BM
