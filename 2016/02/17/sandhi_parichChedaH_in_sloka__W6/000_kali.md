HariH OM!

  

sarvebhyo namaskāraḥ,

  

I just wanted to be guided by expert opinion of this forum as to whether -

  

1) we can do sandhi paricChedaḥ while reciting or quoting a sloka from, say, Rāmāyaṇa or Śubhāṣita ?

  

2) will the purity of the sloka be affected by such sandhi paricChedaḥ ?

  

3) when we teach such slokas to youngsters or freshers to Samskṛtam , will it not be easy for them to recite back if we do sandhi paricChedaḥ ?

  

4) Or, should we recite the sloka in the original form and then explain the padavibhāgaḥ?

  

5)Are there any Śāstraic restrictions or injunctions in this regard?

  

6\) Will the same rules be applicable when we recite Mantas?

  

Expert opinionof the scholars of this forum will be helpful for teaching to students.

  

Dhanyavādaḥ
