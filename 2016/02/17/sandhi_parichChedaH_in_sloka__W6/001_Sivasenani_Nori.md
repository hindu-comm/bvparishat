Sir,

If we read a poem with visandhi, then there is chandobhanga and what is recited is not poetry. So both poetry and, more so, Mantras in a particular chandas, should be recited as such, without pada-viccheda. In the case of Mantras in the form of a sentence (say, ब्रह्मविदाप्नोति परम्।) if we do padacheda, what we get is the padapaaTha and not mUlapaaTha. Only mUlapaaTha is allowed in prayoga - others are only for rakshaNa.

Regards  
N Siva Senani
