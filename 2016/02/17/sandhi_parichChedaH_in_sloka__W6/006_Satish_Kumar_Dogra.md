Binoy Ji,  

 Sandhi is crucial to poetry. Western poetry uses syllables to bring about poetic balance. Each syllable consists of a combination in which there should be one vowel.  
  

This applies to Sanskrit poetry too. For instance, if you take the shlokas of Srimad Bhagwad Geeta, each line consists of 8 + 8 syllables. Thus, the entire shlokah has 32 syllables divided into four portions of 8 syllables each.  
  

Look at the following shlokah:  
  
**य दा य दा हि धर् म स्य ग्ला निर् भ व ति भा र त**  
**अ भ्यु त्था नम् अ धर् म स्य त दा त्मा नं सृ जा म्य हम्  
  
**

This is the pattern throughout Srimad Bhagwad Geeta. If you look at the fourth portion, it is the sandhi that has reduced 10 syllables into 8 in order to fit into the pattern. Otherwise, it would be  
  

**त दा आ त्मा नं सृ जा मि अ हम्  
  
**

In fact one can take this as a subject of research and show how Sanskrit poetry uses sandhi to bring about a balancing of syllables. **
