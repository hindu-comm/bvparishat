Namaste

Doing pada-vibhAga is issue in question.

Purpose expressed is two fold.

1\. General chanting

2\. Teaching purposes.

  

1. General chanting does not need it.. because there is no teaching. And audience is probably learned lot.

Purpose of general chanting is puNya, or dharma-lAbha. Hence pada-vibhAga will not fetch it to the reciter. (शृण्वन् रामायणं भक्त्या यः *पादं पदमेव वा*। स याति ब्रह्मणः स्थानं ब्रह्मणा पूज्यते सदा ॥१४॥)

2\. Teaching needs it, for clarification to the student. So it is inevitable.

  

Then, pada-vibhAga- while quoting a verse in texts as a reference - also depends on end-users. If teaching is involved, then splitting is OK. Otherwise not required.  

  

Now question is- in teaching- where should it be? In the primary text or in the secondary explanation apart from text? Definitely not in the primary text- that is mUlam.. because, first before explaining anything, we introduce the text in the form it exists in the mUlam. That is how guru-Shishya-paramparA goes. First mulam, the pada-vibhAga.

  

In the natural language (NL) pada-vibhAga plays no role. NL has no sandhi-splitting in Samskrtam (and lets keep all Non-Samskrtam languages out of comparison for this specific issue.) Even while day to day speech, we use lot of sandhi. We say- नमस्ते। and not नमः ते। It just comes out in a flow.

  

Next question is- whether only "sa-sandhika" (nice term used in this thread:)) text is the problem before a student or any other issues? samAsa is a big issue. So is the verse initially is given to student with samAsa-splitting as well? Do you say- (while chanting or in the first step of teaching)-

कौसल्यायाः सुप्रज राम, (or कौसल्या येन सुप्रजा तादृशो हे राम) पूर्वा सन्ध्या प्रवर्तते।

उत्तिष्ठ, नरः शार्दूल इव, कर्तव्यं दैवम् आह्निकम्।।

or just as the shloka exists in the Ramayana?

  

One more - if we start making very mUlam texts with ease of beginners in mind, will it stop at only sandhis? Next level "beginners" will demand cheda within a pada. So for eg. the upasarga-dhAtu will start getting broken. I saw such texts as well - as main-texts! And it can go on- to unnecessary extents like breaking out कर्तव्यं, आह्निकं etc..!!

  

Next- metric issue of a verse-

How do we sing a song and teach it? For eg. (not going very far from present- a song that I love, from Samskrita bharati collection)

अवन्याः तलं पुनः अवतीर्णा स्यात् संस्कृतमेव गङ्गायाः धारा

धीरस्य भगीरथस्य वंशः अस्माकं वयं तु कृतः निर्धारः यैः ते।

(With sandhi-splitting and samAsa-splitting both)

None sings it this way- right? Singing involves all the aspects of the song as it is. So is the case with chando-baddha-work.

  

When a Telugu singer used to teach light music in radio named M. Chittaranjan, the first thing that happens was - "please listen to the song". Then song was played and then, they started to explain each word. So right from traditional to modern, methods are similar, because it is common sense. When a text (audio or visual) comes to you, it comes in non-broken form.



Next is- issue of very presence of sandhi in a text-

Why is sandhi there at all? Is it "put" there? Made up? Let alone metric texts, even prose texts have them.

We have it everywhere in NL. All poetry, prose, mantras- literally are full of them. The very definition of sandhi says- परः सन्निकर्षः सिंहता। The natural ability that is there within words to join with each other when they come very near. So its not a "created" issue. NL has to be accepted sa-sandhikA.

  

Next- What are other Indian languages dealing the issue like?

Take a Telugu verse-

అమ్మలగన్నయమ్మ ముగురమ్మల మూలపుటమ్మ...

Do we give the student at the very beginning- as

ఆ మల కన్న (అమ్మలను కన్న) అమ్మముగురు అమ్మల మూల(ము)పు అమ్మ.. etc.?

An obvious NO! Right? First the verse as it is- and then splitting comes to teach, make things clear to the beginner.

  

Now - the negative effects of such splitting-at-first-stage even for students-

1. Student will never ever know how the natural text looks like.

2. (S)He will always look for a broken text- which will not be available easily, and will always remain a dependent on teacher's help.

3. Sandhi-splitting in metric texts spoils the chandas.. and hence puNya is gone away.

4. It calls also for extra effort while reciting.

So one who gets used to split texts, will curse non-availability of ALL Samskrtam texts that way.

  

So let pada-vibhAga be for second stage.. atleast after one initial recitation.



As an experiment I introduced my student of Samskrtam, the visarga sandhi through NL (without going to any grammatical specifications) just once, how to spot and solve it, and then later, whenever she found one, she would instantly break it out herself successfully. Traditionally, students used to be first taught all general sandhis; so one would be easily reducing the effort of splitting so many 1000s of texts!!

  

Since digital texts have more place and scope, and future Samskrtam world has much to do with them, let us set some limitation to reckless, pointless and unnecessary breaking of words. The first timers will think- that is how Samskrtam is, which is untrue!! One who can break a shloka, can give the mUlam as well..!! Just a matter of a want to do things in line with naturalness..! mUlam, vibhAga, and then translation.. let the lesson go this way.

This is what I want to say. Thanks for patiently reading this long mail.
