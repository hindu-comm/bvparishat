Thanks for understanding the purpose of my efforts.

  

I did not discuss the names of different parts of Bhaarata varsha mentioned in Mahabharata, since that is not the purpose of the thread and also because I am not as a big expert as Dr NR Joshi in this matter.

  

Coming to my visiting of those places, I am happy with being acquainted with globe-trotters like Dr Joshi who visitedthoseplaces.

  

I am just quoting the verses of Mahabharata verbatim. Since locating any place including Vasvoukasaara in the contemporary world was not was not my purpose, I did not do that.

  

You seem to know where in the contemporary world that place is located. Please enlightenme about that.

  

Your knowledge about these places based on your first hand research in fact is useful for my purpose because that proves that the places mentioned in the verses are not fictitious but real.

  

Please share your travel experiences and your research.
