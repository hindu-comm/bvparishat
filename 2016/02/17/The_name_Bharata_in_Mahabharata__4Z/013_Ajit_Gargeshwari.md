Bharta Varsha means The Dynasty of Bharatha who were the most influential dynasty that ruled over Hastina Pura. Right from Bharathas time the rulers of this dynasty were known for their valor. With the special boons Bhismma had received they were practically unbeatable. The rulers were rich enough without alienating the Pandavas. Sanjaya always tries impress upon the king and Duryodhana the path of righteousness which will lead to great wealth and prosperity of Hastinapura.
Hastinapura no doubt had imperial ambitions but never claimed all the kingdoms should be subversive to them. Mahabharata mentions several independent and powerful kingdoms.Bharata had not still acquired the sense of a Single Geo Political Unit as per the epic. As we now have India Nepal Bhutan etc. there independent countries or Kingdoms then as per the epic. Many kingdoms did not completely agree with views of Hastinapura but did not want to confront Hastinapura directly. Many countries at present don't completely agree with US hegemony but still they don't directly confront US but negotiate so it was then.
