Why Sanjaya describes the richness of resources of Bhaarata varsha is as answer to why there is a lobha for that land?



The relation between lobha and the richness of the resources is this: the one who wins the war gets the taxes from the portions covered . The amount of taxes is proportional to the richness of the resources.



Even as part of Rajasooya, kings pay 'dhanas' to Dharmaraja.



The portion that I shared from Bheeshma parva here, thus, shows the idea of Bhaarata varsha as a geopolitical unit here.



Why I said that that was not my full answer is this.



It is true that the centralization of administration and economy was notso intense as, say, in Mohammadanperiod or during theBritish period in the period that is reflected in these verses (9th century BC)



Thedecentralized administration and economy was based on near autonomy of villages and tribal settlements. These units namely villages and tribal settlements were associated with the small kingdoms which did not wield much interference in the day to day administration of these units. Decentralization was in this sense. Even the interference of Hastinapura in the day to day administration of the kindoms that were part of their saamraajya was minimal. But still the concept of saamraajya, raajaraaja etc. were all there.



My thread initiating question was :



Did the name Bharata exist as the name of a geopolitical unit by the time of composition of Mahabharata or was it coined during national movement ?
