Dear Prof.Paturi,

  

I like MBh for the indirect way that it upholds or paints on a broad colourful canvas "dharma". This dharma is not what the DharmaS'aastras prescriptively preach, except there may be some overlap here and there. MBh also has a geopolitical dimension, but I am unable to understand your statement:  Mahabharata which described different parts of Indic subcontinent as being ruled from Hastinapura would have got rejected if that perception was not shared by its readers.

As far as I could follow the Mbh in the original, it does not say anywhere that a large country was ruled or controlled by a central king or emperor sitting at Hastinapura. The best one could gather is that in " Bharatavarsha" of that times there were several regions and rulers, some strong, some weak, some friendly, some enemies etc. Please provide the MBh text which gives you the perception that the *Indic subcontinent was ruled from Hatinapura*

  

regards  
  
RN Iyengar
