Dear Dr Joshi,



Thanks for agreeing with me.



Congratulations for being able to identify all the places described in Mahabharata and for getting appreciation of 'one Indian scholar who travelled in the middle east countries' for this identification.



The places being outside the Indic subcontinent does not contradict the theory of presence ofthe idea a vast भारत beyond the little fragments of kingdoms by the time of composition of the cited verses.



You said, "It is not difficult to recognize the Mahabharata nations from Bheeshma Parva outside.". The use of the word 'nations' is problematic in this context. Janapadas were not 'nations'.



Regards,



Nagaraj
