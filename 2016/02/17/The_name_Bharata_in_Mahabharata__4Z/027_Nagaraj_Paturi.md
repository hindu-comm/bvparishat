\>I am not interested in a question & answer session.

You seem to have misunderstood a certain style of conversation to be a demand for a question and answer session. Sir, I did not ask you to participate in a question and answer session. I thought it was a persuasive style of making you follow mymethod of inference.



The word भारत is used in both the senses side by side in the following verses:



अत्र ते वर्णयिष्यामि वर्षं भारत *भारतम्।*

प्रियमिन्द्रस्य देवस्य मनोर्वैवस्वतस्य च॥ ५॥

अन्येषां च महाराज क्षत्रियाणां बलीयसाम्।

सर्वेषामेव राजेन्द्र प्रियं भारत *भारतम्॥* ८॥

Your stand seems to be that the portion with lobha discussion and the mention of Bharata Varsha is interpolated later into the book.



I stated my poorvapaksha as follows:



The focus of the thread is the name भारत , whether its use to refer to the area close to what we today call भारत is ancient one or whether the name and its use in this sense were coined during the days of thenational movement. When youngsters here told me that their teachers told them that there was nothing called भारत in the days prior to the British rule, I felt the need tohighlight this portion of the book.



Even if you consider these lines to be interpolations, done during the times when Puranas like Brahmanda Purana were composed, it does notvindicate the stand that there was nothing called भारत in the days prior to the British ruleor that the name भारत and the idea of a vast भारत beyond the little fragments of kingdoms is a product of the political unification 'gifted' by the British.



I madeview with regard to centralization of administration and /or economy in ancient India clear in the following words:



It is true that the centralization of administration and economy was notso intense as, say, in Mohammadanperiod or during theBritish period in the period that is reflected in these verses (9th century BC)



Thedecentralized administration and economy was based on near autonomy of villages and tribal settlements. These units namely villages and tribal settlements were associated with the small kingdoms which did not wield much interference in the day to day administration of these units. Decentralization was in this sense. But still the concept of saamraajya, raajaraaja etc. were all there.
