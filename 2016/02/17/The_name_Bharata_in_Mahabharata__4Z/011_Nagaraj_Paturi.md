The following is from the portion of Bheeshma that was shared by me, as part of my initial post in this thread:



१०

धृतराष्ट्र उवाच॥

यदिदं भारतं वर्षं यत्रेदं मूर्छितं बलम्।

यत्रातिमात्रं लुब्धोऽयं पुत्रो दुर्योधनो मम॥ १॥



What is the reason for the lobha of Duryodhana that is being mentioned by Dhritarashtra here ?



Sanjayades the richness of resources of Bhaarata varsha as an answer to this question.



In what way does the richness of resources of Bhaarata varsha benefit Duryodhana if he wins the war?



This is not my full answer.



We can discuss further after an answer to this question from you.
