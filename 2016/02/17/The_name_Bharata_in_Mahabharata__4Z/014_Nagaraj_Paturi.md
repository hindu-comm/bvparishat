Dr Gargeshwari,



Bhaarata Varsha was not the dynasty. It is described as a land. Please go through the shared portion of Bheeshmaparva.



*इदं तु भारतं वर्षं* यत्र वर्तामहे वयम्।

पूर्वं प्रवर्तते पुण्यं तत्सर्वं श्रुतवानसि॥ ५०॥

and many other verses.



This portion is in fact part of Bhoomiparva.
