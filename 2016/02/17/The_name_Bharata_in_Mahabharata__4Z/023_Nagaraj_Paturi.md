Dear Dr Joshi,



You seem to have OCRed from the pdf.



It did not come through.



The verses you picked out seem to be from the description of ऊर्ध्व जनपदाः (Northern Janapadas)



You seem to have attempted to highlight words which you thought are places outside Indic subcontinent.



I am not sure I am in a position to locate every Janapada listed in these verses in the contemporary maps.



While working with one of the researchers at the University of Chicago, I realized that we are not able to match the places described in some 16th century 'maps' with the places known to us today. In that case, to be able to locate the places in these verses is obviously extremely difficult.



I already said, "I am not interested in whether the areas included in the description in the book are exactly the sameas today's भारत or not."



The intention is to counter the misinformation spread by teachers with colonized mindset that the name भारत and the idea of a vast भारत beyond the little fragments of kingdoms is a product of the political unification 'gifted' by the British.
