I am not interested in a question & answer session.

  

Duryodhana had several types of Lobhas, but this does not add up to conclude that the subcontinent was ruled from Hastinapura; nor does it indicate that Duryodhana knew the geography of Indic land mass of his days and wanted to become the sole ruler of the subcontinent. Any way Pandavas won the war! Did they say anywhere in the Epic that they are ruling "Bhārata-varṣa"? Even in the Sabhāparvan & As’vamedhikaparvan I could not find any concept that would indicate political unity or strong desire for centralization of the rulership of the subcontinent. But, there are plenty of evidences for promoting and celebrating cultural (dhaarmic) unity of the subcontinent. The word “Bhārata” appears in every parvan while addressing the Kauravas or the Pandavas, in conversations. In the Bhagavadgita also Arjuna is addressed as Bhārata in several places.

  

But the phrase Bhārata-varṣa indicating the continent bounded by the Himalayas and the Oceans is typically Purāṇic (ex: Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa).
The use of Varṣa in the sense of a piece of land is quite sparse in MB.

The word Bhārata-varṣa appears six times in the Bhumiparva and later in the Śuka-upākhyāna of Śānti parvan once. The word *Bharata* and its derivatives, in the sense of persons, clan, group, people, community occurs several hundred times. Interestingly in the Sabhāparvan, Kṛṣṇa is said to have arrived in the ***Bhāratapura***. Perhaps this means the city of the Bharata clan (Pāṇḍavas). Even then it is nice to know that some parts of present NCR (Delhi) was once called ***Bhāratampuram*** !

Now, coming back to the Bhūmiparvan which is part of the Bhīṣmaparvan of MB, Sanjaya describes the topography, physical features, rivers, countries, communities known to him in Bhārata-varṣa.

He also feels sad about the ensuing war for he touches upon the greed of the kings for fighting for the ownership of Earth/Land.

My inference is that the name Bhāratavarṣa has come into vogue after the main episodes of the original Bhāratākhyāna. The Bhūmiparvan is added into the Vaiśampāyana-bhārata by others in making Bhārata into Mahābhārata. In M.R. Yardi’s statistical style analysis also, Bhīṣmaparvan chapters 1-40 and 61-70 come out as forming a separate group, which Yardi calls the B-style of the Sauti group. It was natural to refer to the geographical entity, as our ancients became aware of it, through wars and travels (tīrthayātrā) as ‘Bhārata’. The clan of Bharata : Bhāratam janam, the progeny of Bharata, is mentioned as early as in the Ṛgveda (III.53).
