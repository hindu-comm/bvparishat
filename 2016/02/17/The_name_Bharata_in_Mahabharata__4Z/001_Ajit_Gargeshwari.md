The answer really depends on, did Mahabharata with all the verses we do have in the Vulgate edition did exist as a unified composition by a single author ? or Did the Mahabharata evolve from a small kernel of a smaller text? There is a theory, that the evolution was from Jaya to Vijya then Bharatha and finally Mahabharata. If we believe the critical edition of the texts is the most accurate reconstruction of the original then a probable answer can be arrived at. The critical edition of Mahabharata was not based on nationalistic sentiments is clear from various writings of Prof. Sukthankar S. and other member of the editorial board.
