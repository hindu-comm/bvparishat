Dear Prof N. Paturi,



Thanks for posting verses from Bheeshma parva.



The countries I highlighted from Bheeshma parva verses you posted were outside of the Indic subcontinent. Mahabharata empire was not limited to Jambudvipa (Indic subcontinent). And hence Hastinapura was not in the Indic subcontinent. This point I would like to make. Thanks. N.R.Joshi

Dear Dr Joshi,



The focus of the thread is the name भारत , whether its use to refer to the area close to what we today call भारत is ancient one or whether the name and its use in this sense were coined during the days of thenational movement. When youngsters here told me that their teachers told them that there was nothing called भारत in the days prior to the British rule, I felt the need tohighlight this portion of the book.



I am not interested in whether the areas included in the description in the book are exactly the sameas today's भारत or not.



If you can guide me to thecontext of useof the word भरत खण्ड that you have in mind, we will be able to discuss the same.



Did you have the lines of sankalpa भरतवर्षे, भरत खण्डे in mind?
