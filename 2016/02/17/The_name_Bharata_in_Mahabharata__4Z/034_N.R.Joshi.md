Dear Prof N Paturi,



I do not want to keep you guessing on Vasvoukasara. It is the name of one of the cities of Devas. You may be knowing the word Divoukasah from Amara kosha. Amaravati was the city of Indra where the sun never gets strong.



Indra's heaven was on the western border of the ancient China beyond Pamira Plateau. On this list it was discussed some years ago that Indra had war with Namuchi and Indra captured his two lady soldiers of Abalaa Senaa (Ladies kingdom).



The cities of Devas were beyond Uttara Kuru. Pandu says to his wife that ladies from Uttara kuru were endowed with natural beauty. N.R. Joshi.
