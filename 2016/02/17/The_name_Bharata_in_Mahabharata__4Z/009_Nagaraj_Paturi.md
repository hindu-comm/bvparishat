In any case, the name Bharata varsha being found in the epic is one way of looking at the idea of Bharat as a geopolitical entity at the time of composition of the epic.



There is another way of looking at it too.



The geopolitical reality described in a narrative work can not be contradicting orunacceptably different from the one known to its readers. For example a novel written today can not describe a beach in Delhi and Kutub Minar in Mumbai, capital of India being Udaipur , India as including say Mayanmar. If it does such descriptions, it gets simply thrown out as a book with all wrongs.



Similarly Mahabharata which described different parts of Indic subcontinent as being ruled from Hastinapura would have got rejected if that perception was not shared by its readers.
