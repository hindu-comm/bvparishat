Dear Prof N Paturi, Congratulations for your effort on collecting references to the word Bharata as the name of the Indian subcontinent.



But since you posted something on Mahabharata, I am tempted to write this. You did not discuss your own posting (names of the countries mentioned in Mahabharata). Now let us forget that.



When are you going to visit the countries of Shakas, Shaakalas, Kambojas, Uttara Kurus, Tukharas, Yugandharas, Shalvas, Trigartas, Vaalhikas, Srinjayas, Sahadevas, Somakas, Krivis, and many more. Theywere mentioned in Mahabharata.



Your previous posting mentioned Vasvoukasaaraa. Where was it located?
More interesting part of Mahabharata is never discussed. N.R.Joshi
