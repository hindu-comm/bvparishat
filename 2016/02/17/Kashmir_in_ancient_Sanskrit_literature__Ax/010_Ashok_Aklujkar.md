This discussion, I think, will benefit from the following book and the references given in it:  
2008. Linguistic Traditions of Kashmir. (eds) Mrinal Kaul and Ashok Aklujkar. New Delhi: D.K. Printworld. Pp. XXIV + 609.  
  
The book also has much matter of relevance for the discussion of Pata\~jali that took place earlier on the BVP forum.
