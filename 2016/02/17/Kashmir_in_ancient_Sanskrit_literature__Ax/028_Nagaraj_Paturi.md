This woman goes from outside Kashmir to Srinagar and says these things.



Please see what this group ofKashmiri Muslimsof Jammu and Kashmirhave to say [here](http://www.jammu-kashmir.com/insights/insight990901.html):




The article is titled as



Kashmir: Where Sufis are Rishis and Rishis are Sufis!



and is written by one Sultan Shaheen.



It says,



"The term \`*Rishi*' itself is clearly a derivation from Sanskrit and Indian traditions, though some Medieval Muslim scholars have tried to show that it is derived from the Persian word *raish* or *rish* meaning the feathers or wings of a bird."



It goes on to say,



"The Kashmiri Muslim *Rishi*'s ascetic and unworldly life thus bears a close resemblance to the lifestyle of the Hindu *Rishis* and *Munis* as well as Buddhist and Jain monks."



The author says,



"With such deep commitment to spiritual growth and the Islamic philosophy of Divine Unity (*wahdat-ul-wajud*), which is not different from Hindu philosophy of no duality (*Advaita*), it is not at all surprising that the *Rishis* consistently preached complete harmony among different religions and peace and understanding among their followers"



He adds,



"Aware of the tension created between Hindus and Muslims during the reign of Sultan Sikandar, one of the foremost *Rishis*, Sheikh Nooruddin wrote:



***"We belong to the same parents.  
Then why this difference?  
Let Hindus and Muslims(together)  
Worship God alone.  
We came to this world like partners.  
We should have shared our joys  
and sorrows together."  
***"



Please go through the whole article which begins with the words,



"The most dominant influence on the Kashmiri Muslims, in terms of their Kashmiriyat, is that of the *Rishi* order of Sufis. While the Sufi orders like the Suharwardi, Kubravi, Naqshbandi and Quadri, arrived in Kashmir from Persia, Central Asia, and Central and North India, the *Rishi* order evolved in the valley itself indigenously in the beginning of the fifteenth century. The Kashmir valley was already permeated with the traditions of Hindu ascetism and Buddhist renunciation.'



and ends with the words,



"Indeed in my incorrigible optimism, I still see Kashmir's sufis and *Rishis* leading India itself to a higher level of spiritual development."

It has this to say,



"We do not believe in the Kashmir problem. We believe the problem is about the whole state of Jammu & Kashmir, including those parts under Pakistani and Chinese occupation. We do not accept that any part of Jammu & Kashmir is under Indian occupation because the state legally, politically and spiritually became part of India in the early 1950s with special powers and concessions obtained from the powers in New Delhi."
