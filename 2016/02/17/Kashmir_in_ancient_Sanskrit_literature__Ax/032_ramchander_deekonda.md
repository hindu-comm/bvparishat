Respected Scholars,

  

I agree with the view of Vidvan Varkhediji that we must produce convincing material from the ancient sanskrit literature (produced in Kashmir); and scholars from this platform must establish the fact once again, that Kashmir has always been part of India as stated in Puranas:

  

                                   
         ***uttaram yad samudrasya himAdrescaiva dakSiNam***

***  
                                   
        varSam tad bhAratam nAma bhAratii yatra santatiH***

  

This, in my humble view would the best purpose of this thread.

  

dhanyo'smi
