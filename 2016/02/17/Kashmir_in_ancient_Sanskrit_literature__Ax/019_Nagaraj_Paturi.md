After having remembered so much about how Kashmir contributed to India and its integration through Sanskrit literature, and its own expression of its being anintegral part of India through its intense participation in thepan Indian Sanskrit literary activity, shall we also add expressions of intense affection expressed by the other parts of India towards Kashmir through literary expressions in Sanskrit and other Indian languages?



From my side, there is one book just at the top of my mind. That is a book, translated into English by a great scholar of Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu and other Indian languages Prof. David Shulman( with a great scholar of Telugu Prof. Velcheru Narayana Rao as the co-translator). The original Telugu book is called 'Kalapoornodayamu'. The English translation is called, 'The Sound of the Kiss'.



One of the principle male characters of the book, Manikandhara, a poet in the Dvarakacourt of Lord Krishna travels all the way to Sharada Peetham of Kashmir to achieve artistic perfection in his poetic skills. The narrative poem ends with his achieving of this goal.



One of the most popular episodes/sub-narratives of the book, the story of Sugaatri and S'aaleenuDu is set in the house of the priest of the Sharada temple of Kashmir.



The story isan utpaadya itivritta not a prakhyaata one.



The poetwaswriting itin Nandyal of present Andhra Pradesh in the 16th century.



It reflects the place of Kashmir in the imagination of that poet and all his readers throughout the centuries after its composition.
