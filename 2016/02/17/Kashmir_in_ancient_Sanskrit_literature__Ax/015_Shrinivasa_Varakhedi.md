Many great poets like Kshemendra, Kshemaraja belong to Kashmir and the literature produced by them has immensely influenced the Indian Litarary studies.  
  
Philosophers like Abhinavagupta many others have contributed a lot which are considered to be turning points in Indian philosophical thinking.  
  
Many religious texts on Shaivism have been produced by Kashmir Pandits.  
  
These facts are known to all scholars and reproduced here for others and for the purpose of record. In one sense Kashmir was very much integral part of Indian intellectual tradition. We don't see any sign of separation in any aspects.  
  
With best regards
