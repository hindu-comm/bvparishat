Unlike English, Sanskrit because of its grammatical structure that allows words to ride on top of one another, provides the possibilities of creating thickness of meaning that is not possible in a preposition-based language like English.

For instance, समास is a powerful grammatical structure in Sanskrit available for putting together a number of root-words to create a phrase replete with meaning. Similarly the use of the participle to convert a verb into an adjective as in कुर्वन् इह कर्माणि or मया पूर्वमपि प्रोक्तुम् उपदेशम् --- such grammatical structures are not available in English.

This is why Shakespeare, the great genius, had to create similar structures in phrases like "Our sometime sister now our queen". Such phrases in Shakespeare's writing would even make one wonder whether he had at some stage the good luck of a contact with Sanskrit and realised the possibility of a समास-like putting together of words.
