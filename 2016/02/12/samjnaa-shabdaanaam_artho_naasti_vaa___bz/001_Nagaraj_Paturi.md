If your memory is right, the scholar was probably mentioning the philosophy of Vakyapadiyam (Which I would call Paniniyan Linguistic Theory) that Vaakyaartha is primary and nouns in that sense do not communicate meaning (of their own).



This position in this sentence seems to reflect a kriya-centric position of syntax too, comparable to the contemporary verb-centric models of syntax.
