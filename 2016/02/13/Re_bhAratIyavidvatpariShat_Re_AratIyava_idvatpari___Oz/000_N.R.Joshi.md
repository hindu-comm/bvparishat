I agree with Dr. Siva Panucantion the study of etymological analysis of scientific terms. What difficulty DR **Andrés Alanis** is finding
for his genetics terminology into Sanskrit words, I went through the same process for physics and electronics words. We rarely see discussion on the terminology used by Aryabhatta or Bhaskaracarya in their math / astronomy books in BVP postings.



I wanted to have Sanskrit anvarthaka terminology that instantly explain the concept behind the English Sanjnaas like entropy, complex number. For this reason I studied VarNavaada in Sanaskrit semantics. I fixed the meanings of Upasargas. That helpsme to create new terminology consistent with existing terminology. VarNavaada reveals the internal beauty of meanings of Sanskrit words. Thanks . N.R. JOSHI.

Dear scholars

I agree to the discussion above. Prof. amba, and Ramanujan are great contributors to Sanskrit and allied studies. Dr. Prasad (HCU) started a great work. I observed the translations of medical terms above. Scholars with a common aim may come together to build a team for this great cause. This is the right time to start some good and big project.

But in the process of making greek/Latin technical word into sanskrit, it (new word) should not be difficult and ambiguous. Very common words precisely may be brought into sanskrit as they are (in stead of making it very difficult to use).
