Namaste

  

I thinktoday thesaying should be पाश्चात्यमित्येव न साधु सर्वम्. People are following West blindly. This is cheap imitation. Nothing else.

  

I am not saying everything in the West is bad. There are many good things but people here are not thinking which is good and which is bad. They are simply imitating. When they imitate blindly they cannot think good about tradition. Tradition becomes bad for these imitation artists.

  

There are also Western people interested in Indian tradition. They come here and get married like Hindus. The mutual admiration of West and East is good. But people following West or East must think and understand what they are doing. The problem is they do not think and understand. They only imitate. If they learn to think they can understand good and bad.
