I don't want to get into the political discussion on this forum, but just want to say that this is very simplistic and utterly inaccurate view of the modern intellectual world.

  

पुराणमित्येव न साधु सर्वम्

नवीनमित्येव न साधु सर्वम्

पाश्चात्यमित्येव न साधु सर्वम्

प्राचीनमित्येव न साधु सर्वम्

  

We have not any need to rebel against antiquity; we have not any need to rebel against novelty. If anything, we have to rebel againstmediocrity and blind imitation.

  

सनः परीक्श्तरत भजन्ते मूढः परप्रत्ययेन बुद्दिः॥

  

Remember that Kaladāsa was a rebel of his times.  

  

By the way, as you know, Profs. Velcheru Narayana Rao, David Shulman et al. have been interrogating the development ofmodernity from the perspective of indigenous traditions for the last three decades, from the same elite precincts of Western universities!

  

Regards,

Suresh.
