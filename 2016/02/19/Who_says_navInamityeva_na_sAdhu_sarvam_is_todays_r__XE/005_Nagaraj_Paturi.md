AadaraNIya vidwan Sri Sureshji,



1. \>By the way, as you know, Profs. Velcheru Narayana Rao, David Shulman et al. have been interrogating the development ofmodernity from the perspective of indigenous traditions for the last three decades, from the same elite precincts of Western universities!



------- Thanks for this information. I am happy to knowthat scholars who have a wider circulation (than just one of the Indian regional languages )are doing this work which I strongly think is the need of the hour.



Vishvanatha was a follower of indigenous knowledge traditions. He was standing in that position and was expressing his response of how modernity and developments of modernity would look to a person standing in that reference frame.

If the two professors placed themselves in that reference frame, in the shoes of a follower of indigenous traditions, and studied how developments of modernity would look toan observer standing in that reference frame, published the results of such observations of them, I would certainly love to have a list of all those publications and go through them myselfand make use of themin educating the youngsters herein suchunderstandings which are badly needed by them. I am sorry for not knowing all these publications of them.



2.> but just want to say that this is very simplistic and utterly inaccurate view of the modern intellectual world.



------ view of 'modern' intellectual world? You mean *contemporary* intellectual world? Because 'modern' has a special connotation after the post-modern. For example, those of the contemporary intellectual world who would like to look at themselves as 'post-modern' do not like to be called 'modern'. Since my description included the 'post-modern' too, to call of those described there as 'modern' may be problematic.



3. Coming to your view that mine was a simplistic view, let me tell you that I thought that I was bringing out the complex details of a group which is bundledsimplistically into just one category as'modern', western' or 'left' .



For example, I said 'American left usually is not and does not like to be called Marxist'to remove the 'simplistic understanding, that is possible in India, ofall the American left as 'Marxist.' The misconception of taking all the American left to be Marxist comes from the typically Indian popular simplistic understanding of taking the word 'left' as a synonym of 'Marxist'.



I said, 'Many American modern university intellectualsget irritated by the cultural studies, post-modern and stuff', because when people hereread 'post-modern', 'cultural studies' etc usually get an impression that the entire contemporary intellectual world might have been swayed by all this. I wanted to remove this possible simplistic understanding and said that there is not so much sway of these new approaches on all the contemporary intellectuals. (For example, Prof. Noam Chomsky expressed his serious disagreement with Derrida and other proponents of 'post-modern' )



Now insomepremierIndian universities there are academicians who subscribe to 'post-modern' and 'cultural studies', some of them moved into that from their previous Marxist affiliation. General observers from outside do not know these details and take all of them to be just 'left' or 'Marxist'. I thought viewing that way would be simplistic and wanted to clarifyby saying, 'Post-modern and cultural studies guys enjoy bashing 'modern' 'Marxist' etc.'



I thought this analysis of complexities was not enough and that is why I said, 'It can go on like this.'



I thought the bundling all these different groups into one category was happening because people see common features among them such as their anti-religious and anti-traditional approach. That is why I said, 'But all these strands get united when it comes to bashing religion tradition etc.'



One more thing I was trying to do was to remove the idea that these intellectuals are particularly against 'Hinduism'.I wanted to say that what appears to be 'Hinduism-bashing' by them is part of their antagonism towards religion in general and tradition in general which has roots in theintellectual developments in the beginning of the enlightenment age.That is why I said that they do what they do because 'They need constant self-re-assurance that they are right on the track set in by their enlightenment age gurus which is the excitement to have been able to find things different from the ones known to the tradition.'



Thus , I thought I was doing just the opposite of viewing simplistically. I was tying to show the complexity of the picture of a certain group of contemporary intellectual world which is generally simplistically viewed as ideologically monolithic and uniform.



Regards,

Nagaraj
