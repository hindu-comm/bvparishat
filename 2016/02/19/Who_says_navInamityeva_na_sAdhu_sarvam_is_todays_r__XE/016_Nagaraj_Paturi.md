\>Seems to me you're asking for a debate .



Dear Vidwan Srinivasji,



In thinking that I am asking for a debate, you mistook me.



Since I twice pointed out the lack of connection between my word rebel and Vidwan Sureshji's words, I thought I could be mistaken for coming in the way of any discussion, you wanted to start. That is the only reason why I clarified that you might go ahead having a discussion, if you wanted.



Uffff!
