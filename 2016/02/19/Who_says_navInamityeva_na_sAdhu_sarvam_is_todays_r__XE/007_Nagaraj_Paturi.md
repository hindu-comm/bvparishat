I had a prolonged internet disconnection at my place. Hence the delay inmy response.



\>Against the backdrop of such global academic environment rooted in Enlightenment and Liberalism, are you suggesting that India can offer an alternative model based on Indian traditional academics? If so, I would like to hear more.



-------- The context in the thread was not related to suggesting models of academics.



The context was the hostility this 'global academic environment rooted in Enlightenment and Liberalism' creates to theintellectuals engaged in traditional academicsand academics about traditions with approaches not rooted in Enlightenment and Liberalism. The challengethat environmentposes to these intellectuals when they want to make a point.



My point was---- it is easy to tune oneself to or to be just a part ofthe predominant environment aroundand it is challenging,adventurous and hence admirable as heroic to accept and face this challenge and succeed in making a point.
