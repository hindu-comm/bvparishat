In my previous post, I said,

"The context was the hostility this 'global academic environment rooted in Enlightenment and Liberalism' creates to theintellectuals engaged in traditional academicsand academics about traditions with approaches not rooted in Enlightenment and Liberalism. The challengethat environmentposes to these intellectuals when they want to make a point."



Within this 'global academic environment rooted in Enlightenment and Liberalism' , Indian environment has some special features:



1\. Various strands of Marxism: You agreed with me and said that I was right in saying that "left" doesn't mean "Marxist". But in India, left means 'Marxism' and due to the open pro-Marxist stance taken by successive pre-liberalizationgovernments both at the Centre and in various states, 'modern' thinking was predominantly permeated by Marxism. Marxist presumptions were accepted as axioms and as given. University academics in Social Sciences and Humanities, particularly in premier Central Universities such as JNU, were clearly Marxist. Soviet-guided Marxism and China-guided Marxism or the extremist Marxism (which was sloganeering against all kinds of imperialism including the Soviet and Chinese imperialism) , itwas Marxism all over.



2\. You agreed with me and said that I was right in saying that'most of the contemporary intellectual world has NOT been swayed by the "post-modern" cultural studies'. But in Indian university academics, the two big waves next to Marxismare 'post-modern' thought and Cultural Studies only. (Since youused the phrase, 'post-modern" cultural studies', I want to clarify/remind that 'post-modern' is different from 'Cultural Studies'. Though Cultural studies has a heavy influence of post-modern thought, it is an independent area in itself, 'Many cultural studies practitioners work in departments of English or Comparative Literature'you may see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_studies), or ignore if you are alreadyaware.) 





3\. You agreed with me and said that I was right in saying that academic intellectuals are not particularly against "Hinduism," but they tend to be anti-religious. But in India, the 'anti-religious' takes essentially the form of anti-Hindu (probably just as anti-religious in Christan countries takes the form of 'anti-Cristian'.) But what does not happen in Christian countries and what happens in India is the same anti-religiousanti-Hindu academiciansstand in support of all other religions with the strange definition of secularism as prominorityism.



As a result, the hostility this 'global academic environment rooted in Enlightenment and Liberalism' creates to theintellectuals engaged in traditional academicsand academics about traditions with approaches not rooted in Enlightenment and Liberalism andthe challengethat environmentposes to these intellectuals when they want to make a point takes a uniquely Indian form.
