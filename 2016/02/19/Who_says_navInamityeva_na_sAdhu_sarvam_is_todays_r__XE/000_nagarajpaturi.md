When Kalidas said, 'पुराणमित्येव न साधु सर्वम्'he was rebelling against an environment of intenserespect for the 'traditional' , 'in line with the ancient ordinances', 'in the model of old masters' etc. People rightly looked at him as a bold and heroic person.



But what is the environment today? Is it not just the opposite of what Kalidasa faced? Is there not an intense respect for'nontraditional', 'deviant', 'delinquent', 'latest' 'fashion of the day' etc.? Then who is a rebel today?Who is a bold and heroic person today ,



the onewho meekly and sheepishly joins the bandwagon of thistradition-bashers,joins the herdsuffering from enlightenment age fixations



or the one who boldly stands up and questions these tendencies saying, 'नवीनमित्येव न साधु सर्वम्' ?



All those who are engaged in Sanskrit and other classical studies know who needs courage today, who is exercising the courage to swim against thetideat various institutes of higher learning.



I am saying this just to share myfeelings when I sawthe blowing their own trumpets by some institutes of higher learningabout how they are infusing revolutionary, rebellious thinking in students.



Is making the students toe the line of all the new waves that blow in from outside, teaching them to be bold?
