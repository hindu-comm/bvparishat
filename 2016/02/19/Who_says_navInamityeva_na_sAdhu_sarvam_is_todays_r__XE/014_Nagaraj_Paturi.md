Dear Vidwan Srinivasji,

  

If you have some ideas to share with regard to the two scholars Professors David Shulman and Velcheru Narayana Rao, and their

  

"interrogating the development ofmodernity from the perspective of indigenous traditions for the last three decades, from the same elite precincts of Western universities!",

  

please go ahead. Only bringing the word rebel into this was what I thought was connecting two different views. 

  

Regards,

  

Nagaraj
