Your post or responses thereof can suggest multiple trains of thought, you know. It doesn't have to be confined to what led you to post in the first place. Seems to me you're asking for a debate :)  
  
I dont have anything to share really. I feel that Narayana Rao Garu is an Indologist, i.e., a practitioner of Indology in the sense of D Venkat Rao's definition of the term in the Introduction to his translation of Sri Rani Sivasankara Sarma's 'The Last Brahmin'.
