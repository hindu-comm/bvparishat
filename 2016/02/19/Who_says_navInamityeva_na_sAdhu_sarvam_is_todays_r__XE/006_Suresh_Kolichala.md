Ādaraṇīya vidwān Nāgarāj-ji,

  

Thanks a lot for the detailed clarification. You are right in elaborating that 1) "left" doesn't mean "Marxist" 2) most of the contemporary intellectual world has NOT been swayed by the "post-modern" cultural studies 3) academic intellectuals are not particularly against "Hinduism," but they tend to be anti-religious (not necessarily anti-tradition). In America, it is not uncommon to hear the criticism that academia is anti-Christian! (For example, see David Horowitz' writings on how Academia is anti-Christian and anti-American).



You are also right that most universities in Western societies -- at least most public and private nonreligious ones -- find their primary foundation in the liberal idea of independent inquiry, free discussion, and academic self-government as originated in the Enlightenment. The idea that the academic freedom, independent of sacred and secular powers, is an absolute prerequisite for transmitting and advancing knowledge thrived in the aftermath of Enlightenment. In fact, when Jefferson founded The University of Virginia in 1819, he was explicit in emphasizing its Enlightenment ideals!

  

Against the backdrop of such global academic environment rooted in Enlightenment and Liberalism, are you suggesting that India can offer an alternative model based on Indian traditional academics? If so, I would like to hear more.

  

Regards,

Suresh.
