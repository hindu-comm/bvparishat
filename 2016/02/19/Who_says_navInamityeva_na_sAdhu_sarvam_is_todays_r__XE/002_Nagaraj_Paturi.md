Another big theme to be interrogated is 'modernity'. 'Modernity' affected the west first and then through them the rest of the world.



It is the 'post-modern' project which has been highlighting the 'wrongs' of 'modernity' from its perspective.



Interesting thing is: one of the defining features of modernity has been itsbeing'anti-past' and its'breaking with the past' ; but today it itself turning out to be a thing of the past in the eyes of the post-modern.



Interrogating modernity from the perspective of indigenous traditions has not been highlighted so far. There were many writers in regional languages of India (e.g. Viiswanatha ) in Telugu who did such an interrogation of modernity from the perspective of indigenous traditions right during its onslaught through colonial rule and colonial education. Findings of such analysis have not been brought into general circulation beyond those regional languages.



These institutes of higher learning have a buzz of one or the other of these currents. Soviet-guided Marxism, China-guided Marxism,general modernity as imported from US, UK or some other country, now, Post-modern, Cultural Studies Movements of Frankfurt, Bermingham etc.



All these have their own differences and bones of contention.For example, American left usually is not and does not like to be called Marxist. Many American modern university intellectualsget irritated by the cultural studies, post-modern and stuff. Post-modern and cultural studies guys enjoy bashing 'modern' 'Marxist' etc. It can go on like this. But all these strands get united when it comes to bashing religion tradition etc. They need constant self-re-assurance that they are right on the track set in by their enlightenment age gurus which is the excitement to have been able to find things different from the ones known to the tradition.



Any other way of thinking simply irritates them frustrates them surprises them provokes laugh in them and what not.



They moved faraway from the general society all over the world and they enjoy this moving away.



Now the general society is getting surprised to see where and how far they have gone.
