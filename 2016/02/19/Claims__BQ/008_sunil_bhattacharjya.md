All these efforts will fall in line when the ancient Indian chronology is set right and all the important milestones in that are scientifically established. Recently one archaeologist-historian named Nayanjot Lahiri wrote a book on Ashoka Maurya, claiming to be giving an archaeologists view but it has totally ignored the archaeological fact that there is no archaeological evidence of Ashoka Maurya being in the Pataliputra in the 3rd century BCE. This is just to give a glimpse of what is happening.
