After reading your mail, I felt I agree at the "spirit" ; but "motive" is also important.

Calling someone "father of something" clearly is want of getting sense of "firstness" in front of the world.

Anyway- we can leave it at that.

Coming to *our* claims, even if Indians wanted to "find proofs" this day, what are ways left? What I heard from those who tried was- many ancient works are lost now, stolen or destroyed. So now we are only left with meagre material.

So, what are the sources left now, if one wanted to "prove" Indian origin of sciences and knowledge, (where it is exactly India first, undisputedly- nothing like "all is in vedas" etc.) keeping in view the foreign invasions and cultural destruction that systematically happened in India for centuries together?

Any constructive guidelines- if someone wanted to take up some particular area and study?

धन्यास्मि।
