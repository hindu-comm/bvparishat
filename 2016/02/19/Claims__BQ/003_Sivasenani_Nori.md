Madam

  

Of these, Avicenna is definitely a great scholar of medicine, philosophy etc. Now, whether you want to call him father of modern surgery or not, is a matter of opinion. It might interest you to note that in Iran today, mainstream Doctors study in Persian. In India, those who study medicine in Sanskrit are bunched under "doctors of Alternative medicine".

  

The epithet "Father of \_\_\_\_" need not be taken seriously. It should be treated as an arthavaada. That said, a few of the modern techniques indeed are said to have "originated" from the middle east, though India is the actual home. One famous example. 1, 2, 3, 4 etc. are called "Arabic Numerals" though their origin is undisputedly Indian. These got popular in the western world due to efforts of Fibonacci in the thirteenth century, who got to know of this system from North Africa. Another example, missed in the above series of photographs, is the Father of Algebra, Al Khwarizmi (often these Al- type names refer to the town, like the poet Sahir Ludhianvi). He is considered the Father of Algorithm (which is actually named after him, i.e. his latinized name), but Pingala in his Chandassastra many hundreds of earlier has already demonstrated that. As seen from these examples, this happens largely due to ignorance, and because Persia and Arabia were the bridge between India and the Western civilization. Even the name of the country shows that historical process: Sindhu \> Hindu \> Indus.

  

One more observation: most of these scholars flourished around AD 1,000. This is the period during which Islam rejuvenated the middle east while Europe was into the dark ages. I was told by a friend that during this time, many learned Persians, like some of the featured scholars, who were forced to convert to Islam under the threat of sword, actually ended up bringing great fame and respectability to the religion. Most Indian claims to have first done something are at least hundreds of years earlier.

  

Yet another note: I do hope that young Muslim scholars try to emulate these men of letters. In that sense, these posts are actually useful. It is mischief if it is intended to only stroke jingoism. And, similarly, this also opens our eyes as to how others would treat our own claims of finding everything in the ancient texts, without offering proof.
