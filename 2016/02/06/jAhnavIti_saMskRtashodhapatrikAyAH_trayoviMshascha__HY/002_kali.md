HariH OM!

  

Namaste Bipin Kumar ji,

  

While I agree with the observation of Shri Dogra I also want to add the following observations of mine:

  

1.The photo display tabs (vertical frame) on the Home page are difficult to read prior to clicking on a tab.

  

 No doubt it is a novel design to display the photo feature, but a separate horizontal tab link like others on the Home page would have been simple and impressive.

  

 It looks like duplication of effort and page display since the same photographs are displayed in "Gallery" tab link also.

  

2. When we navigate to the respective pages from the horizontal tab links on the Home page, the Horizontal tabs are no longer displayed.

  

 That means we have to use the 'backward' arrow mark on the browser as many times as we are down the link to get back to the Home page.

  

 Also that, we cannot navigate to other horizontal tab pages without returning to the Home page.

  

3.While viewing the Archive pages some of the pdf links do not work.

  

4. And, while on a pdf page, the same problem of going back to archive page - like mentioned in point 2.

  

5. Links in the Latest issue page not working.

  

6. And finally, where are the articles or news on samskritam? Even as an initial attempt, could have carried some articles on Samskritam or in samskritam.

  

 All we get to know are the names of scholars associated with the e-magazine, and photographs.

  

Please take my comments in the right perspective. While I wish to encourage such Sanskrit e-magazines, I wouldalso look at the benefits for browsing the site.

  

DhanyavadaH
