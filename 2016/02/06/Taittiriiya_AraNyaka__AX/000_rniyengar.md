Dear Scholars,

I am interested in the different commentaries on TA. I have copies of the commentaries by Bhatta Bhaaskara and Saayana. I understand there are several more including one by Rangaraamanuja.Could some one kindly list the various commentaries with publication details.

I would be obliged if someone can give links to soft copies of the commentaries other than by BB and Saayana.

best..

RNI
