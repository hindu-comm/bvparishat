Whether here or there, it is time we respond in larger numbers every time if for nothing else only to let them think that they have opponents to oppose them fight them.

We must compile a classified list of 6000 academics - and they shall not be hard to find - of course with their agreement and take out a given number,depending on the issue, every time and post it.

 It is like preparing a muster roll and it is a must - all these years they have had a free run.

 I do not agree with the idea that the scholars must only do scholastics. *Shaastra* must provide the ammunition to *shastra - Chanakya* with Chandragupta, Madhvacarya with Harihar and Bukka.

 Let us not fool ourselves - all that is happening - award wapsi, signature campaigns against Sri Narendra Modi, the Dalit pretext of Hyderabad episode, the 'freedom of expression (read 'abuse') at JNU, all this is not for some principles, nor even against Modi ji or BJP - it is an insidious war against Hindus and Hinduism, against *Dharma*.

 We been avoiding saying this out of Hindu nature of not hurting others. But now is the time to stand up and be counted for our civilisation is at stake.

  Let somebody take a lead and prepare the muster roll of teachers who will like to be counted.

 regards to all who read this.
