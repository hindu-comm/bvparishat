Dear Suresh Kolichala Ji

  

In the case *Kedar Nath Singh vs State Of Bihar*, citation: 1962 AIR 955, 1962 SCR Supl. (2) 769, the Supreme Court ruled that section 124A must be interpreted to be applicable to activities which involve “*incitement to violence **or** intention/tendency to create public disorder **or** disturbance of law and order/public peace.*” The ‘or' conjunction is important here. The judgement is available here: <http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111867/>

  

Quoting from the headnote:

Keeping in mind the reasons for the introduction of s. 124A and the history of sedition the section must be so construed as to limit its application to acts involving intention or tendency to create disorder, or disturbance of law and order; or incitement to violence.

  

And from the end of the ruling:

The ratio decidendi in that case, in our opinion, applied to the case in hand in so far as we propose to limit its operation only to such activities as come within the ambit of the observations of the Federal Court, that is to say, activities involving incitement to violence or intention or tendency to create public disorder or cause disturbance of public peace.

  

In addition, this was neither *addition of a caveat*nor an *amendment*to section 124A, rather it was an *interpretation* of 124A. The Supreme Court does not edit or amend the Indian Penal Code. It is the Parliament (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha) which amends the IPC by passing acts.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
