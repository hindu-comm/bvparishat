Friends,  

 As a former police officer I have perhaps a greater understanding of the insidious nature of what goes on in our educational institutions. Some of my postings brought me face-to-face with dangerous undercurrents whose strings extended beyond our borders.  
  

I feel highly aggrieved by whatever is happening and especially by the aggressive attitude taken by the votaries of a specious definition of freedom. Only those whose thoughts are free of prejudices and narrow vested interests can practice true freedom of expression. The roots of such true freedom lie in our Indian culture, not in Western culture.  
  

I wish to share with the members of this Forum a couple of messages I have put up on Facebook:  
  
अफ़ज़ल गुरु की मौत का शोक मनाने वालों को उन वीरों की याद किस दिन आएगी जिन्होंने अपनी जान दे कर भारत के गणतंत्र के प्रतीक भारतीय सदन की लाज बचाई थी और भारत के करोड़ों नागरिकों का प्रतिनिधित्व करने वाले सांसदों की जान की सुरक्षा की थी?  
  
उस दिन अफ़ज़ल गुरु और उसके साथी सफल हो जाते तो क्या होता, यह सोचने की फुर्सत निकालिए।  
  
पिछले कुछ दिनों से अभिव्यक्ति की स्वतंत्रता के प्रतीक होने का दावा करने वाली JNU ने पिछले बीस साल में कितने ऐसे बुद्धिजीवी पैदा किए हैं जिन्हे् अंतर्राष्ट्रीय स्तर पर अग्रिम श्रेणी में माना जाता हो?  
  
अभिव्यक्ति की स्वतंत्रता हल्ले-गुल्ले से नहीं मन की शक्ति से आती है।   
  
वितर्क दे कर JNU में घटी अतिनिंदनीय घटनाओं को न्याय-संगत बनाने वालों को गहन विचार करना चाहिए, न कि प्रवाह में बहना चाहिए।  
  

And...  
  
  
There are a handful of so-called "intellectuals" in the country who neither fit the East nor the West but are a burden on the nation like midway-hanging Trishankus. They have distorted our national value-system. Those of us who feel strongly must speak up to silence the cacophony of these self-seekers and suckers of the nation.  
  

And...  
  

Some political parties are trying to defend the shameful incidents at JNU, in which some students shouted anti-national slogans, by calling it Freedom of Expression.

Freedom of Expression has an unstated component --- that is, the thoughts to be expressed. When people like Voltaire, Rousseau and Bertrand Russel spoke of freedom of expression, they had great ideas that they wished to share and, therefore, demanded to express these ideas irrespective of whether these challenged the established set of beliefs of the society in which they lived.

Our universities have become intellectually barren lands that produce the weeds of naxalism, sedition, indiscipline and drug-addiction. How many world-class intellectuals has the JNU produced during the past twenty years? How many have won the Nobel Prize?

When you are barren of ideas, you can only produce noise. When you are aware of your intellectual penury, you feel insecure about persons of other persuasions coming and seeding the university with their ideas. That is because you know that you do not possess the intellectual wherewithal to counter powerful arguments and fight well-founded philosophies. So, you call lectures of Vendanta regressive, thus rejecting without knowing and understanding it, the entire achievement of the ancient rishis. You resist someone like Dr. Subramaniam Swamy because he could poke holes in your rubber-sheet of ignorance.

Let us understand two facts before we try to defend the JNU incidents in the name of Freedom of Expression:

1\. Slogan-shouting is mobilisation of mobs for social action, and when this action is likely to harm the interests of the nation, it amounts to sedition. Slogan-shouting should not be confused with Freedom of Expression.

2\. For Freedom of Expression to be exercised, you must possess ideas that are so great that they justify defiance of an existing system of values.

Neither of these applies to the situation in JNU.
