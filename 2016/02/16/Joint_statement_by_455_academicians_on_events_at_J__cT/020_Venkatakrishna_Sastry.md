Namaste  
  

The vision of the institution guides the action -implementation of the persons at the institution. No amount of signatures can change te 'Swabhaava-swaroopa'kriyaa of the institutions embedded in their ' vision'!  

  

The vision of the JNU as a University compared to the vision of' Benares Hindu University may be an interesting read in this connection ! ' Svabhaavastu pravartate'.

http://www.jnu.ac.in/AboutJNU/vision.asp](http://www.jnu.ac.in/AboutJNU/vision.asp) - The bill for the establishment of Jawaharlal Nehru University was placed in the Rajya Sabha on September 1, 1965 by the then Education Minister, Mr M.C. Chagla. During the discussion that followed, **Hon. M.P. Mr. Bhushan Gupta voiced the opinion that this should not be yet another university**. New faculties should be created, including **scientific socialism,** and **one thing that this university should ensure was to keep noble ideas in mind and provide accessibility to students from weaker sections of society.** The JNU Bill was passed in Lok Sabha on 16th November 1966 and the JNU Act came into force on 22nd April, 1969.  
  
  
The ten Schools and four special centres of the university produce high quality research publications, books, working papers and M.Phil and Ph,D theses. The JNU alumni occupy important positions, in academics, government, private sector, and in fact in all walks of life. **Recently JNU has been ranked by the NAAC as the top University in the country.  
**  
**JNU will continue to play a major role in the field of higher education, by seeding new ideas and creating knowledge, and by imparting high level of training with values and social commitment.**
