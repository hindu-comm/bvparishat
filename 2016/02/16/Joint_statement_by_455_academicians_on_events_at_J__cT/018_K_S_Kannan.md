This league of fifth columnists must be watched for greater potential damage. Educated scoundrels are more deleterious than natural scoundrels. Subscribers to extra-territorial loyalties must be dealt with seriously. Promoters of further vivisection of our country ought to be brought to book and put behind bars without mercy and lenience.

  

**The tougher battle** - of countering their intellectual challenges with stronger intellectual rebuttals - is a greater and more urgent a need, and must be taken up in right earnest.

  

The international network that acts surreptitiously, and at times overtly via nexus with the mass media, must be taken note of; and expressions of even greater solidarity must vociferously be made public lest silence be misconstrued as consent or even pusillanimity.
