Here is my response to the petition by JNU alumni association's international members.

Though this matter seems to be a political issue on its face, it is deeply connected with the solidarity of our nation. Sanskrit fraternity always supports the concept of Akhanda Bharat. At this point of time, we can discuss the notion like Rashtriya alhandata and the role of Sanskrit etc.  
  
We should make Sanskrit context sensitive.  
  
With best regards
