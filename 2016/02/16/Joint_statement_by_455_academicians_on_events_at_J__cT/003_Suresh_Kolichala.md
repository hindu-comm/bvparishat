Dear Prof. Nagaraj,  

  

As long ago as 1962, the Supreme Court had noted that there is a conflict between section 124A and article 19(2) which guaranteed "Freedom of Speech." In a landmark decision in that year (1962), Supreme Court decided to add a caveat to the sedition law 124A -- **it must be accompanied by violence, or direct incitement to violence**. Thisamendment meant that the Indian government could not invoke a charge of sedition unless the accused directly incited violence through speech or action.Even though the sedition law now lacks teeth, governments love it as a political tool because it is a non-bailable and cognizable offence.

  

As for the JNUSU President Kanhaiya Kumar, we still don't know of his personal involvement in the sloganeering and the Feb 9th protest.Sedition is a serious charge, let's not slap on it on a whim without proper investigation. Based on what my lawyer brother says, it is almost certain that Kanhaiya Kumar wonâ€™t get convicted for sedition.

  

Regards,

Suresh.
