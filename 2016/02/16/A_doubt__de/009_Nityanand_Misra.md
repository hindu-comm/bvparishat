I also noted in this context that the धातुरूपनन्दिनी of Janardana Hegde Ji (New Delhi: Samskrita Bharati, ISBN 978-81-87276-67-3, 2013 reprint) has a misprint on page 263 where the णिजन्त form of १२०२ तमु काङ्क्षायाम् is incorrectly printed as तामयति-ते. It should be तमयति-ते.The error may be corrected in the next edition.
