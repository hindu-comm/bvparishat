Thanks, sha\~Nkara.

I've taken note of it.

I'll try to find it in kAshI.

  

We are trying to find some nyAya-books which are out of print now. An organization has asked students to find such books. They will be editing and publishing it.

  

Any other title, which you/other scholars consider important? That will help students chose important ones.
