Dear Scholars,

I am in need of the "Vishnu Sahasra naama" commentary
(ParasharaBhattar) of the srivaishnava tradition and the one by the Madhwa tradition. Please provide elinks or share pdf files.

I already have the S'aankarabhashya of the Advaitic tradition with the vivrti of Taaraka brahmendra saraswati (Mysore ORI edition by Rama Sastry).

I am interested in understanding how some of the ancient astronomical terms have been handled by the three traditions.

thanks

  

RN Iyengar
