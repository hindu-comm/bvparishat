नमस्ते,  
  
I think this is a lost cause already, and has percolated down to other activities within country. Imagine what would happen, if in an organisation - entrusted with a scientific/ technical project of vital importance - people by force of group-think merely follow their leaders, and indulge in uncreative "follow the authority" attitude, where on the contrary, risk taking and experimenting attitude (learning from mistakes, and not pretending as if nothing has/ is happening) was the need of the hour.  
  
Indeed, this story is being repeated all over, again and again. And the more people continue with their endeavours, the more dangerous it gets for the future of society.  
  
Professionals in India have never been put under scrutiny, at least in the manner the politicians and the public figures have been. This holds true for those in academia and industry alike.  
  
The water is already above the neck. The patient is terminal, may be there is no hope left for him, but it will not hurt at least for him to know the cause of his death. However, this task also is impossible since Indians - in my opinion - are very literal in their assessments (respectful of "authority"), so they will anyway listen to only the single "authoritative" version of any story (and perhaps privately indulge in conspiracy theories).  
  
In the end, any genuine activity must of necessity takes place in the underground, or the background - away from the focus. Why, first let us ask our Sadhus and the Wanderers this: "why did you drift?"
