Dear Jhaji,  
  

This refers to my mail sent early last week. I hope you could find some material in that book "Shankaravijayam" of Shri Madhavacharya., which, you think, cast doubt on the credibility of the book. I am eagerly awaiting the same. Adi Shankara does mention one Satavahana king, who was a contemporary of Shri Harsha Vikramaditya and that seems to show the possibilty of Adi Shankara being a contemporary of Shri Harsha Vikramaditya. That does not mean that I would not think everything in the Madhavacharya's book to be not questionable, particularly if there is clear discrepancy.  
  

Looking forward to hearing from you and with regards,  
  

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
