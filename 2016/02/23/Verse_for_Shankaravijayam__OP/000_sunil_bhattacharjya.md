Dear friends,  
  

I am looking for the verses from the "Shankaravijayam" by Madhavacharya (Swami Vidyaranya), which reportedly says that Shri Harsha (probably king Shri Hrsha Vikramaditya, who was a brother of Bhartrhari) and Udayan (probably a friend of king Amaruk) were contemporaries of Adi Shankaracharya. I shall be grateful if any kind member helps me in locatin this verse. .  
  

Regards,  

Sunil Bhattacharjya
