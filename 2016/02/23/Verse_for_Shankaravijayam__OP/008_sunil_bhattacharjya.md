4\. Finally, here is the verse about which you had enquired. It is verse number 157 in chapter 15 of the Samkshepa Sankarajaya, attributed to Madhava.  
  
paTu-yuktinikRtta-sarvashAstraM guru-bhaTTodayanAdikair ajayyaM \| sa hi khaNDanakAra-mUDhadarpaM bahudhA vyudya vashaMvadaM cakAra \|\|

  

The reference here is to a someone described as khaNDanakAra, i.e. the author of the khaNDana. This is usually taken as a reference to shrIharsha, the author of a famous text called khaNDana-khaNDa-khAdya. The entire chapter is in the context of Sankara winning over a host of intellectual opponents in discussion and debate, ranging from Saivas, Vaishnavas and Saktas, to philosophers expounding various positions aligned with Vaiseshika, Yoga, Mimamsa, Nyaya, Bauddha, Arhata (Jaina) and the other Vedanta (mostly the Bhedabheda of Bhaskara) traditions.

**In this respect kindly permit to quote the translation of this verse 157, as given by Swami Tapasyananda inhis translation of Sakshepa Sankaravijaya. His translation is as follows:**  
  

**By his powerful dialectics he became victorious over (the followers of) Guru Prabhakara (the founder of the Mimamsa school), Bhatta the follower of another Mimansa school), Udayana (a leader of the Nyaya school), Khandanakara (the famous dialectitian, Harsha) and others.**  
  

**Further , Swami Tapasyananda translates the verse 141 as follows :  
  
**

**Great scholars of Avanti, like Bana, Mayura and Dandi abandoned their their perverse doctrines andbecame devoted to the study of Sankara's commentaries**  

  

All these show that there are a lot of historical material, which should not be ignored.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil.K. Bhattacharjya
