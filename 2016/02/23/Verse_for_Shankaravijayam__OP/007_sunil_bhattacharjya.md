Dear Shri Vidyasankarji,

Thank you for your response and for showing where there could be at most be only a probable reference to Shriharsha Vikramaditya in the Samkshepa Shankaravijayam. I went through my collection of papers. I could find your paper entitled

"**What determines Sankara's authorship? The case of Pancikarana**", but could not locate the paper "**Conflicting Hagiographies and History" on the Sankaravijaya literature**" I shall be grateful if you can kindly send me a copy of that,  

I have the highest regard for the Shringeri peetha and for the Shankaracharyas of that peetha, but I am unable to to accept the 8th century CE date of Adi Shankara. There are a number of reasons for that . For example, there was no king by the name "Amaruka" who lived in the 8th century CE. Then who is that Vikramaditya, whose 14th year of coronation coincides with the year of birth of Adi Shankara. There are many flaws in the 8th century date of Adi Shankara. I can go on and on on this.  

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
