Dear Jhaji,  
  

Would you like to point out any such material in that book, which, according to you, adversely affects the credibility of the "Shankaravijayam" of Shri Madhavacharya. Or is it that there could be more than one version of the book and only one of them may be the authentic one?  
  

Regards,
