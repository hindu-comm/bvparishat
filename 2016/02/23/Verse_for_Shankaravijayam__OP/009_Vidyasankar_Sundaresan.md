Dear Sunilji,

I'm afraid you are missing my central point. I am not talking about the date of Sankaracharya at all. Nor am I saying anything about the various Peetham in this particular context.

All I'm saying is that poetic hyperbole in the Shankaracharya texts should not be confused for dry factual chronology. There is much that is anachronistic in all of these texts. Anyone with some basic familiarity with Indian darshana authors would know that udayana of the nyAya school and harsha, author of the khaNDana, could not have been contemporaries of kumArila bhaTTa and Sankara. There has got to be a span of at least four or five centuries between bhaTTa and harsha. We must learn to take these ahistorical references in our stride while appreciating other aspects of such literature. For example, the strength of the mAdhavIya lies in its use of poetry to summarize philosophical arguments, which is no mean feat. Furthermore, as the verse in question is about the harsha who is a philosopher-author, not a king called vikramAditya, pursuing this line of inquiry with respect to Sankara's date becomes quite fruitless, doesn't it?

Now that you have brought up both the date of Sankara and the Sringeri Peetham, please note that the AcAryas of that Peetham have great regard for the mAdhavIya, yet they do not insist on taking such references found in it literally. Those among us who want to get into relative chronologies would do well to do the same, i.e. not take it literally. As I said before, at the beginning of my earlier response, \*none\* of the -Vijaya texts can be understood as biographies or historical accounts. Not in the contemporary sense of biography or history. You will tie yourself up in knots if you do otherwise.

Best regards,  
Vidyasankar

PS. I'll send you a PDF version of my paper on the Sankaravijaya texts separately. I presume there will be much in it with which you will disagree, but I hope you will understand what I meant by saying that it requires careful, comparative and critical analysis. If you think I have not been careful enough or that I have been overcritical in my comparative analysis, I would welcome specific points to review.
