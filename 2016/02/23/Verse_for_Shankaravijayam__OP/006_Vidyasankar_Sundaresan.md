Dear Sri Bhattacharjya,

  

As a general rule of thumb, \*none\* of the Sankaravijaya texts (or for that matter, similar texts from other Sampradayas, e.g. Sumadhvavijaya and the like) should be taken as biographies or as accounts of history, the way we understand biography or history today. That was not the purpose of the authors who wrote these texts. Their primary aim is to glorify, not to document like a modern biographer.This does not mean that they are works of mere fancy and imagination either. There is a lot of historically relevant information available in them, but to appreciate that and extract relative timelines and chronologies from them requires some amount of careful, comparative, critical scholarly work. Not once off quotations of a verse or two from here and there, not to mention speculation over speculation in interpretation even before original quotations have been identified/provided.

  

I apologize if I sound a bit too harsh, but interpreting without sufficient data is something I see an inordinate amount of nowadays and my patience is wearing thin.

  

Moving on to some specific notes pertaining to your original query:

  

1\. Equating Sri Harsha with Vikramadityaand goingon to identify him as a ruler ofUjjain/Malwa/Kashmir (with generic references to Varahamihira, Kalhana etc), as you are well aware, is a very controversial and unresolved issue.  

  

2\. Tothen identify this Vikramaditya as a brother of Bhartrhari only confounds the problem even further. Attempts to find solutions should aim at simplifying these things without bringing in unwarranted complications.

  
3. Which Satavahana king does Adi Sankara refer to and where? A mere name like Purnavarman will not do, as again, I'm sure you are well aware. We need references to dynasty names or multiple names that are uniquely identifiable.  

  

4\. Finally, here is the verse about which you had enquired. It is verse number 157 in chapter 15 of the Samkshepa Sankarajaya, attributed to Madhava.  
  
paTu-yuktinikRtta-sarvashAstraM guru-bhaTTodayanAdikair ajayyaM \| sa hi khaNDanakAra-mUDhadarpaM bahudhA vyudya vashaMvadaM cakAra \|\|

  

The reference here is to a someone described as khaNDanakAra, i.e. the author of the khaNDana. This is usually taken as a reference to shrIharsha, the author of a famous text called khaNDana-khaNDa-khAdya. The entire chapter is in the context of Sankara winning over a host of intellectual opponents in discussion and debate, ranging from Saivas, Vaishnavas and Saktas, to philosophers expounding various positions aligned with Vaiseshika, Yoga, Mimamsa, Nyaya, Bauddha, Arhata (Jaina) and the other Vedanta (mostly the Bhedabheda of Bhaskara) traditions.  
  
So, you see, inspite of the anachronisms involved in listing a number of people who lived quite a few centuries apart from one another,there is no reference to any king named Harsha in this text, implicitly or explicitly, nor is there any possibility of therebeing a reference to any such king in this chapter. Needless to say, the question of identifyingthis imaginary kingwith a Vikramaditya, positing him as a brother of Bhartrhari,talking aboutUdayana and Amaruka,and other such speculationsjust do not arise at all.

  

Best regards,

Vidyasankar

  

ps. Have you read my paper, "Conflicting Hagiographies and History" on the Sankaravijaya literature, published in IJHS in the year 2000? I thought I had sent you a copy as an email attachment more than a year ago.
