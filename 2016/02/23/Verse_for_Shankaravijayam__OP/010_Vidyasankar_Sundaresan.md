Dear Sunilji,  

  

A short reiteration of my most important point in response to you earlier. You write:

  

"Thank you for your response and for showing where there could be at most be only a probable reference to Shriharsha Vikramaditya in the Samkshepa Shankaravijayam."  
  

I showed you a reference, which makes it \*absolutely certain\* that there is NO reference whatsoever to a Shriharsha aka Vikramaditya in this text. I just don't understand how you can interpret it as "at most a probable reference." The probability is zero and my confidence in asserting this is 100%. Nobody can hold that the author of the khaNDana was a king named Vikramaditya. It is just completely impossible. And as far as I can see, there is no direct mention of a Vikramaditya or of a Harsha/Sriharsha in the Samkshepa Sankarajaya.If someone else can show a different reference within the text for a Vikramaditya and prove me wrong, I'll be glad to be educated.

  

This is not even a dead end on the road towards fixing the historical date of Adi Sankara with respect to any Indian king. It is an insurmountable wall by the side of that road and I'm also certain that trying to break through that wall will get you nowhere.

  

I'm putting this very strongly, just to ensure that the gap in understanding is not due to some failure on my part to communicate my position clearly. We have gone over similar discussions quite a few times in the past. It is all well and good to try and recover a better sense of the antiquity of our own cultural history, but we can't just invent things as we go along. We have to take the data in the original sources as they are and we need to be able to interpret them in a way that doesn't commit simple logical fallacies.  

  

Thanks,

Vidyasankar
