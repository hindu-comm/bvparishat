Namonamah,

  

 Does anyone know who is working on*[Mahā-subhāṣita-saṁgraha](https://www.google.ru/search?hl=ru&tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=bibliogroup:%22Mah%C4%81-subh%C4%81%E1%B9%A3ita-sa%E1%B9%81graha:+being+an+extensive+collection+of+wise+sayings+in+Sanskrit%22&source=gbs_metadata_r&cad=5)*and what would be expected end of the work - say 50 years? Looking for authoritative sources on Subhashita and Sternbach seems to be the most appropriate after Boethlingk.

  

M.G.
