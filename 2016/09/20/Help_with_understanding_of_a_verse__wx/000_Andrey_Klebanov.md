Respected scholars,

  

as I have so far received a lot of help with all my queries to this list, I dare to put another one.

  

Could anyone be able to help me with the understanding of the following verse (nr. 959 in the Subhāṣitāvalī):

  

न तदनुकृतं मनागपि न वा जलं सुचिरसेवितैः शीतम्।

अन्धीकृते कुदीपैः प्रत्युत धूमेन मे नयने।।

  

while the second half is somehow clear more or less, I seem to miss the point of the first half completely.

  

With many thanks in advance,

Andrey
