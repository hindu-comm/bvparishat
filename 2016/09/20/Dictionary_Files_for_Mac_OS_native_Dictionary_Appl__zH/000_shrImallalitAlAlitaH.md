I was trying to convert stardust files to the format which can be read by native application on MacOS.

I was able to convert a few of them, while many of them were taking hours and it appeared that they failed to convert.

More details are noted here:

Here is the screenshot listing converted dictionaries in the native application.

  

@vishvAs vAsukI may take note of it.
