Friends,

  

I am now at Kiskindha in my Ramayana expedition.

It is very interesting to learn of Sugriva's knowledge in geography.

Has anyone done a thesis to carve out a map? I saw the

following book published in 2014

## The Search for Ravana's Lanka (The Geography of Valmiki Ramayana)

## Please advise any opinion if you know of studies..

Thank you.
