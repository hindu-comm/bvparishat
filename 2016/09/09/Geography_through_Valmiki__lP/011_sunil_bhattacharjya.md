Dear Bijoyji,'  
  

While in Kishkindhya you may like to visit "Sigriva's cave, which is near Hampi. You may also like to visit the village Anegundi, which is not far from Sugriva's cave. I understand that the Bant (Vant?) people, living in that village, claim to be the descendants of the Vanara king Vali.  
  

Regards,
