Valmiki's geography as revealed through Sugriva's directions given to his commanders is a mixture of fact and fiction. It is mentioned

तत्र प्राग्ज्योतिषं नाम जातरूपमयं पुरम् ।

यस्मिन् वसति दुष्टात्मा नरको नाम दानवः ॥ ३१-४२-४ ॥ Gorakhpur Edition.

This is a direction given to the Western platoon. As far as I know Pragjyotish is somewhere in the Eastern part (Assam?) of India. This is just an example where the error seems glaring.
