I had seen some of these sites. I will look Dr. Shukla's book.

Sugriva gives a perspective of world geography as possibly

understood at the time of Valmiki. It appears as a different

cartographic view of the world. We now know that travel out

of India through trade was popular during the Indus period.

The question could be how was geographic information

packaged for the future travelers. Ptolemy's geography was

popular in Greece at the period (I have not studied though).
