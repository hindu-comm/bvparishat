I heard that there is an exposition on the Pranava giving 108 Nirukti taking Shastra and Smruthi as Pramanas by a Saint in Varanasi. It is in a manuscript in leaf. While one half is on philosophy of Upanishads the other is on Upasana.

Has any of the members had a chance to go through it? The Swami, who is a scholar himself, who had read it said that the same has not been printed, but during his ashrama days in Varanasi, he was given permission to read it. I am trying to get in touch with him for more details.
