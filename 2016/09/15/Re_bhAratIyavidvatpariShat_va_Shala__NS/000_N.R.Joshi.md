Dear K Tuvji, Namaste!



Thanks for mentioning my name with my VarNavaada.

Your efforts in attaching meanings to VarNas are appreciated.

However there has to be a scheme for choosing meanings to VarNas.

In my VarNavaada, meaning of say K, is connected to Kh,next connected to G, that is connected to GH and finally to the last nasal.

So the choice is not random. Seven rows and five columns of consonants form asemantic net horizontally and vertically.

So please try that way (internal connection) if you can.



I would like to add.



The meaning of the consonant k is described as Prajapati in books on VyaakraNam. K is also described as Vaayudeva by one of the aachaaryas (probably by Madvacharya). Thanks. N.R.Joshi.

Subject: Re: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} 'वृषल'

नमस्ते ।  
  
The following is a personal view, and should - at this point of time, at the maximum - be considered as a logician's take rather than an Aindra or a Nirukta approach, etc. This approach has a precedent in "वर्णवाद" by Dr. N. R. Joshi.  
  
########  
  
वृषल = व् ऋ ष ल  
  
व् = फ् = उ = पर्जन्य / मरुत देवता  
  
ऋ = "personality".  
  
व् + ऋ = वृ = something having the quality of पर्जन्य / मरुत देवता.  
  
These qualities are: covering/ overpowering पृथिवी, the power of generating life on पृथिवी (usually via वृष्टि / वर्षा), the power of Love, the power of Justice - to name a few (a subject unto itself).  
  
वृक्ष for example is वृ + क्ष ("action") = that which acts to cover (i.e. to give shade).  
In वृष, ष props ऋ even further.  
  
ल = "place", "attached to".  
  
So वृषल = someone having something to do with वृष.  
  
This is the शब्द (वेद) परिमाण of वृषल, which is rooted in the देव परिमाण of the वर्णs (पर्जन्य/ मरुत mainly in this example).  
  
वेद created the linguistic space-time; in this example, the शब्द (वेद) परिमाण of वृषल is a given and therefore not going to change irrespective of the Yuga or context we live in.  
  
The next is: how this word is incidentally employed in specific instances. The question is: what is the वाक्य परिमाण of वृषल?  
  
a) वृषल = शूद्र वर्ण, the Varna that has the power of Justice, the power of Love, the power through which earth-bound दस्युs are transformed and propelled into Varna fold.  
b) वृषली = unmarried girl that has started menstruating, that is someone ready to be able to create life on Earth.  
  
Finally, we have आख्यान परिमाण guidelines for which are given in काव्यs and पुराणs, that have recorded our long journey till the present कलियुग.  
  
a) वृषल = शूद्र = आचारच्युत, धर्मच्युत, दस्यु, व्रात्य क्षत्रिय, reasonable since शूद्र वर्ण lost its former glory, and the पर्जन्य power with it.  
b) वृषली = menstruating girl that "should have been married by now", a fertile woman that "unfortunately" yet remains childless.  
  
To the credit of Chanakya, his address of Chandragupta Maurya correctly belongs to the वाक्य level परिमाण and thus avoids आख्यान परिमाण of the word शूद्र.  
  
धन्यवाद  
KT
