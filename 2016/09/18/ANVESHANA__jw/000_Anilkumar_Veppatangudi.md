I am very happy to inform you that my debut novel is now available on Amazon.

Here's the link. Since it is Self-published, I welcome all the help I can get to promote it.

<http://www.amazon.in/ANVESHANA--SEARCH-V-R-ANIL-KUMAR/dp/B01LXJWFAO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1474174628&sr=8-1&keywords=Anveshana+the+search>

Some reviews of the book:

"This novel way of teaching / attracting one towards the trinity of Dharma, Karma and Samnyasa(renunciation) [is.as](http://is.as) far as I know, first of its kind.

Earlier poets used to do the exercise thru Kavyas and as times have changed people prefer to read Novels rather than Kavyas.

You have, no doubt succeeded in your endeavor in feeling the pulse of today’s reader and inject the Sampradaya full of eternal truths into his mind.

Not only have you touched thru the union of Nagaraj and Lakshmi, the travails of California but also very carefully tried to give the core customs of Shodasopacharapuja, eight kinds of Marriage etc. to the common man.

Congratulations,

Best regards,

Korada Subrahmanyam"

"A fascinating story of a tradition bound middle class family caught in the web of modern life with all the compromises one has to make to be “successful”. The patriarch, Ramachandra, finds the going tough and resigns to a life of deep introspection away from the pulls and pressures of the family.

The story, although close to one’s heart, explores simultaneously the vast canvas of Hindu scriptures and spirituality and attempts to identify solutions to every incident that occurs in the life of its members. There is despondency at every turn if the rules of spirituality are applied. On the surface, instant gratification is achieved if one goes by the ‘gut feeling’ or’ instincts’ and the questions of ethics or morality are given a short shrift. Nagaraj, the first son of Ramachandra, epitomizes this trend and paradoxically achieves his goals albeit with a feeling of guilt. One may agree with his ways as the alternate of following a path of ‘righteousness’ is strewn with harsh practices such as meditation, detachment and renunciation leaving the present wholly in the hands of an unknown power if at all there was one!

The ancient Hindu wisdom cautions the practitioner to eschew ‘immoral’ paths and devote the present life to one of deliverance from the cycle of births and deaths. The theory of Karma is often invoked to put the fear of God. This immediately raises the question of why we were born at all and was it a curse to be born a human if it is only to experience the deeds of the past and conduct oneself in the present as per the rules of Moral Law to ensure a less complicated future? Is there, therefore, no joy in the present? Or is the present only an interregnum between the past and the unknown future?

None of the characters in ‘Anveshana’ have attempted a solution to these problems. They have gone on a long and sometimes dedicated search to find answers but were beaten back by the multitude of options the Hindu scriptures placed before them. It is no wonder, therefore, that the patriarch, Ramachandra, gave up all hope of returning to his family and perhaps willed himself to put an end to his mortal life.

The Author’s erudition comes out loud and clear as he discusses the Hindu way of life and its philosophy. Through his characters, he gives the reader a peek into the various facets of the Hindu religion while retaining the racy nature of the novel.

It is a commendable effort to unravel the mysteries of our scriptures through a contemporary story line. It may compel one to recognize the work on par with our Itihasas and the Puranas which were meant primarily to make the esoteric messages of Vedas and Upanishads understandable to the common man.
