Shrikant Talageri in his book "Final Evidence" does cite Vedic reference

of the possible migration of people from Indus westward. I have not checked

these references. Taking Dr Joshi's Mahabharata references, one may think

that the settlements of Mahabharata are the tracks of the westwards migrating

"vedic" people from the mainland India.

  

Others here would know more and might articulate better.
