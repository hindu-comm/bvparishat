Respected Prof . N. Paturi,



Why there has to be two sides the Aryan debate?

Several times on this list I posted there is third side to the dabate.



If Aryans arrived in the subcontinent from the northwest region, why not to retrace their path backwards all the way to Mitanni, Lithuania and beyond? One has to go through the ancient history of the countries I listed yesterday. And I came across wealth of new information.



I was shocked to find out that in the known history there was the Persian empire spread from lower Sindhus all the way to Egypt.



Who were these people next door to the ancient Indians? The empire had 20 satrapis. They built the Suez canal. We cannot dismiss them or patronize them because of Avesta.



When I show my power point on history from Mahabharata to Indians, Indian scholars say O we are only interested in teaching values to our children from Mahabharata.



Third side of Aryan debate is the historical portion from the epic Mahabharata.



Did Arjuna conquer kings from the Indian subcontinent only or did he go outside the subcontinent? Whom did he come across outside?



Were kings from the countries north of Afghanistan present in Rajasooya Yajna of Raja Dharmaraja? Whatwere names of those countries?



We need scholars of the ancient history from that area and scholars of languages like Dari, Pishachi, Kafiri. Sogdiani, Pamiri. A wealth of information waiting there for us.



Start a dept--Khan Abdul Gafarkhan Dept of Northwest Languages. Thanks . N.R.Joshi

\>You will find out there is other side to this debate.



Which is this other side? The Video is presenting "There was no Aryan Invasion " side. The other side should be "There was Aryan Invasion".



Do you mean Dr Joshi, that if one tries to get the books on the Persian Empire of the known history, or at least tries to read the ancient histories of Afghanistan, Kirghizstan, Kazakhastan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, one will find out (evidences for?)"there was Aryan Invasion" side?



I always knew that you have a great interest and command over the relations between India and the above mentioned parts of the world. I did not know that you found out , on the basis of this knowledge (evidences for?)"there was Aryan Invasion" side?



Interesting.



Can you please elaborate?
