\> If Aryans arrived in the subcontinent from the northwest region, why not to retrace their path backwards all the way to Mitanni, Lithuania and beyond? One has to go through the ancient history of the countries I listed yesterday. And I came across wealth of new information.

  

------- Dr Joshi, This is not a third side. "Aryans arrived in the subcontinent from the northwest region" is the AIT/ AMT side only, which is being opposed and countered by David Frawleyji, Sunil Bhattacharyaji and others. AadaraNIya Bhattacharyaji is advising Vamadevacharyaji (David Frawley) to make use of his dating method to effectively counter the AIT/AMT. You seem to be confident that you found strong evidences in support of AIT/AMT.

  

If you are open to it, let me try to clarify to you as follows:

  

1\. You are repeatedly mentioning that you found material from 'the known' history. I do not know which period you have in mind. The debated period is 1400 BC. 

  

2.The academic disciplines that aim to explain such connections as you found have been discussing the data through their rigorous methodologies.

  

3\. You will certainly enjoy once you put your data into those discussions and see how your data affects the current debate.

  

4\. For example, you may join IE historical linguistics debates using their rigorous methodology or join Ethno-archaeology debates through their methods addingyour data to the extent that is not known to them yet.

  

5\. Laymengiving answers such as 'we study the book only for inculcating values from the book' are not the right people to give a logical conclusion to your great efforts that excited you so much. 

  

Hope you understand.

  

Thanks,
