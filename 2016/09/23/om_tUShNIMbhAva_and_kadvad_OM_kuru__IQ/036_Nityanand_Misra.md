It is one of the derivations, yes. However, it is my preferred derivation as it is has a beautiful *prakriyā* accounted for by the *Aṣṭādhyāyī* (with the suffix coming from the *Uṇādisūtra*-s).  

  

**ava (av) rakṣaṇa-gati-kānti-prīti-tṛptyavagama-praveśa-śravaṇa-svāmyartha-yācana-kriyecchā-dīptyavāptyāliṅgana-hiṃsādāna-bhāga-vṛddhiṣu (DP 1.600) → uṇadayo bahulam (PS 3.3.1) → avateṣṭilopaśca (US 1.128) → av man → ṭilopa → av m → jvaratvaraśrivyavimavāmupadhāyāśca (PS 6.4.20) → ū m → sārvadhātukārdhadhātukayoḥ (7.3.84) → ārdhadhātuka-guṇa → o m → om → kṛnmejantaḥ (A 1.1.29) → avyaya designation → kṛttaddhitasamāsāśca (A 1.2.46) → prātipadika designation → ṅyāpprātipadikāt‌ (A 4.1.1) → svaujasamauṭchaṣṭābhyāmbhisṅebhyāmbhyasṅasibhyāmbhyasṅasosāmṅyossup‌ (A 4.1.2) → om su̐ → avyayādāpsupaḥ (A 2,4.82) → luk-elision → om**

  

It is a startling coincidence that the root av has the maximum number of meanings (nineteen) in the*Dhātupāṭha*. Yudhishira Mimamsaka lists a few more meanings.

  

One can consider the *avyutpannapakṣa*also. In that case the *prātipadika* designation will come from *arthavadadhāturapratyayaḥ prātipadikam* (A 1.2.45) and the *avyaya* designation from *svarādinipātamavyayam* (A 1.1.37), with the *nipāta* designation itself coming from *cādayo'sattve* (A 1.4.57). The *Kāśikā* indeed lists *om* in the *cādigaṇa*.

  

I must add that there is another strong reason for me being in favour of the *vyutpanna pakṣa*. There is a *śruti*in support of om derived from the root *āp* (āpnoti) or the root *av* (avati). The *Gopathabrāhmaṇa* says:

  

**ko dhāturityāpṛr dhāturavatimapyeke**

**rūpasāmānyādarthasāmānyanedīyastasmādāperoṃkāraḥ**

**sarvaṃ āpnotītyarthaḥ**

**kṛdantam arthavatprātipadikam**

**adarśanaṃ pratyayasya nāma sampadyate nipāteṣu cainaṃ vaiyākaraṇā udāttaṃ samāmananti**

**tadavyayībhūtaṃ anvarthavācī śabdo na vyeti kadācaneti (1.1.26)**
