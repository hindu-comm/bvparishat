Dear list

  

The ‘Avyayakosa’ of V Srivatsankacharya (2004: Samskrit Education Society, Chennai) on p. 144 gives ‘tūṣṇīṃbhāve’ as one of the meanings of ‘om’ and cites the example ‘kadvad oṃ kuru’.

  

1\. Does any ancient Kosha list ‘tūṣṇīṃbhāva’ as one of the senses of om? This meaning is not listed in Amara, Medini, or Vishva. What, then, would be the source of Srivatsankacharya?

2\. Where is this example ‘kadvad’ oṃ kuru from? What would it mean given that the only meaning of ‘kadvad’ cited in ‘Vācaspatyam’ is in ‘a mantra containing the sound “ka”’.

  

Any pointers are welcome.
