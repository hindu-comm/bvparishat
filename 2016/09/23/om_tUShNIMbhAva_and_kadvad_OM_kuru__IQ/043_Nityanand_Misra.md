Dear list

  

Sorry for reviving an old thread. I noticed another publication with the exact examples कद्वदों कुरु. This is the Nipatavyayopasargavritti of Tilaka, edited by Appalla Somesvara Sarma (1951: TTD Press, Tirupati). The book is available from DLI and also on Wikimedia under

On pages 15 and 16 of the book, the meanings of Om are given. The वृत्ति says तूष्णींभावोऽन्त एव, and then gives the example कद्वदों कुरु.

So there are two things that come to mind.

1\) The example कद्वदों कुरु seems to be a famous one, at least at the time of तिलक who composed the वृत्ति. Any pointers to the time of this Tilaka would be welcome.

2\) Tilaka seems to suggest that तूष्णींभावः is nothing but the अन्त (or happens at the अन्त, depending on whether one parses अन्त एव as अन्तः + एव or अन्ते + एव). This details is not given in Avyaya Kosha though, which seems to suggest तूष्णींभावः as a separate meaning of Om.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
