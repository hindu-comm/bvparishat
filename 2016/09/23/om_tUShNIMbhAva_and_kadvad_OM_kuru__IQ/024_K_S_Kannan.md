It was I who first raised the question  
being now asked by Nityananda-ji and Prof Deshpande  

\- when I sought for the authenticity of the statement in question  

by way of saying that we are only assuming  
that the statement *kadvad oṁkuru* is a *śiṣṭa*-*prayoga*.  
  

The problem would not have arisen in the first place  

had Vid. Srivatsankacharya provided the Vedic source of the statement  

right in his *Avyaya-koṣa* itself (where it was to be naturally expected),  
or at least in the course of his recent clarification to Dr.Ramanujan.  
  

Or, alternatively, he should have shown an archetypal sentence  
after which he modelled this, were it his own construction by any chance.  
  

I remember an occasion when Prof. Cardona and Prof. Kiparsky had a tiff  

(perhaps in the context of the discussion of the *gaja*-*sūtra)*,  

where a sentence was erected without revealing at the outset  
the model *śiṣṭa*-*prayoga* after which it was fashioned),  

and that raised strong question marks for a while  
in respect of its acceptability as a valid *prayoga*.  
  

In any case, my speculation that *kadvad* could be adverbial in role  

seems to be vindicated in the explanation/clarification presented by Dr. Ramanujan.
