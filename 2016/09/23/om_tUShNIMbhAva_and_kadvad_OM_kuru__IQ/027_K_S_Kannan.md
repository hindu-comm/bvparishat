I guess Prof. Varakhedi would be right

if *kadvadom* is a single, i.e. compounded, word.

Furthermore, you have to take *kadvadom*

as possessing an accusative termination.

  

But *Avyaya-kośa* gives it as two distinct words

(*kuru* being the third one)

(and presuming that there is no printing error!).

  

Had it been presented as or even perceived as a compound word,

the suppositions for its possible adverbial construction

would not have arisen at all,

as there would be no scope for the same.
