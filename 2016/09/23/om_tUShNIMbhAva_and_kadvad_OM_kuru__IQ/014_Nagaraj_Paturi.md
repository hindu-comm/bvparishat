My suggestions, which were in the absence of an explanation from thelexicographer, need not be given significance now after so much material has come from the Vedic tradition itself.

  

Dr P Ramanujan has brought in the explanation from the compiler himself.

  

All the venerable senior scholars have been adding information from within the Vedic tradition.

  

Since all these are notso obvious to the audience not acquainted with the actual practice of Vaidika kriyaas ,Sri Vatsaankaaryaji should have been more elaborate in his words.

  

I for one, amfeeling lucky toget all the knowledge being provided by the scholars.
