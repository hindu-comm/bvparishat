Thanks to all the scholars who responded. Prof. Paturi’s response offers some directions to look further into and specific references would help achieve some results.

  

\(1\) From the kind explanations offered by Dr. Ramanujam and Prof. Kannan, it becomes clear that in hymns addressed to Prajāpati, “silence is consent”.

  

\(2\) We also know that one of the meanings of ‘om’ is consent (‘anujñā’), as is evident from the ‘Viśvakoṣa’ citation (‘omityanumatau proktaṃ praṇave cā'pyupakrame’, Avyayāni 47; interestingly the Chowkhambha 1911 publication edited by Sri Silaskandha Sthavira has the wrong reading ‘num’ instead of ‘om’ here) as well as the Chāndogyopaniṣad statement ‘tadvā etadanujñākṣaraṃ yaddhi kiñcānujānātyomityeva tadāha’ (Chāndogyopaniṣad, 1.1.8).

  

However, I fail to see how the (1) and (2) above can imply that silence (‘tūṣṇīṃbhāva’) is a meaning of ‘om’. One can probably say that silence is the equivalent of ‘om’ in the specific context of hymns addressed to Prajāpati, but this does not imply that ‘om’ means silence in general. To establish that, one needs a Kośa citation or an attested use of the word ‘om’ in the sense of silence.

  

Also, as pointed out by Prof. Deshpande, the example ‘kadvad oṃ kuru’ is rather puzzling. Firstly, if applied to a ‘mantra’ (masculine in Sanskrit), the nominative form would be ‘kadvān’ and the accusative form would be ‘kadvantam’. ‘kadvad’ would be the nominative and accusative form in the netuer gender (the context probably requires us to take ‘kadvad’ as the accusative). Secondly, what is the neuter ‘viśeṣya’ for the word ‘kadvad’? More importantly, where is this example ‘kadvad oṃ kuru’ to be found? Is it only to be found in some oral traditions or is it attested to in some standard ritual work (in which case we may know the context and actual meaning of the phrase better)? Perhaps Srivatsankacharya Ji alone can answer this question satisfactorily. If he uses a mobile/email, may I request scholars in the know to share his mobile and/or email address with me *off the list*?
