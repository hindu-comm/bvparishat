The idea of "Ka standing for Prajapati" is very common in Vedic literature. There are numerous statements to that effect.  
  
Numerous, again, are references that equate Manas and Prajāpati. *Manas*, as pitted against *vāc*, is also a common theme. The two are represented as *anirukta* and *nirukta*, "unuttered" and "spelt out", and hence set forth as *tūṣṇīm* and *mantra* respectively. *Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa*, for example, bears this out.  
  

*Prajāpatiṁ manasā dhyāyan* is also a recurrent formula in the *prayoga*-s.  
  

What pertains to Prajāpati is hence done silently (sometimes referred to as *upāṁśu* also). *Om* as acceptance is also a regular usage in Vedic literature, the vestiges of which are found in Classical literature also.  
  

It should not surprise us, then, that in the context of hymns addressed to Ka in particular, "Silence is consent".
