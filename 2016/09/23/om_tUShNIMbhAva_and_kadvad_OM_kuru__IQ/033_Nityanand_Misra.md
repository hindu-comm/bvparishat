The word *om* which is derived from the root *ava (av) rakṣaṇa-gati-kānti-prīti-tṛptyaavagama-praveśa-śravaṇa-svāmyartha-yācana-kriyecchā-dīptyavāptyāliṅgana-hiṃsdāna-bhāga-vṛddhiṣu* (DP 600) by the Uṇādi Sūtra *avateṣṭilopaśca* (US 1.128) is an *avyaya* (indeclinable) due to the rule *kṛnmejantaḥ* (A 1.1.29). Therefore, in all *vibhakti*-s and in all *vacana*-s, the form would be *om* alone.

  

Hence, *omaṃ dhyāyanti* is incorrect. It should be simply *oṃ dhyāyanti*.

  

This is why Durgādāsa in his second interpretation of *oṃnamaḥ śivāya*in his commentary on the *Mugdhabodha Vyākaraṇa*interprets the word*oṃ* to be in the dative case, and gives the meaning as 'Salutations to Om (*oṃnamaḥ*), for auspiciousness (*śivāya*).

  

*oṃkāraṃ dhyāyanti*is also correct, as the word*oṃkāra*is not an*avyaya*. The word*oṃkāra* is formed from *om* and the suffix*kāra* used in the sense of imitation of a sound (*anukaraṇa*) bythevārttika *varṇātkāraḥ* (V 3.3.108) on which the *Mahābhāṣya*comments *varṇātkārapratyayo vaktavyaḥ, akāraḥ*. Although the rule says*varṇāt*, in some cases this suffix is also seen from a*varṇasamudāya*, for example in the word *vaṣaṭkāra* which is explicitly used byPāṇini in the rule *uccaistarāṃ vā vaṣaṭkāraḥ* (A 1.2.35). This is also noted by Kaiyaṭa who says in the *Pradīpa:tathā kvacidvarṇasamudāyānukaraṇādapi evakāra iti.*
