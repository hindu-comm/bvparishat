\> However, I fail to see how the (1) and (2) above can imply that silence (‘tūṣṇīṃbhāva’) is a meaning of ‘om’

  

---- AadaraNIya Nityanandji,

  

From whatever I heard from the venerable scholars in this thread, what I understand is as follows : The meanings listed by Srivatsankacharyaji are part of idiomatic expressions of Vedic yajnakarma-practioners' world.

  

Expressions in contemporary Indian languages for consent are: such as U (pronounced nasally) in Telugu, Um in Kannada, aam in Tamil, haa pronounced nasally in Hindi etc. Om seems to be a Vedic equivalent of these.

  

For example, तत्र तूष्णीमेव (मनसा मन्त्रानुसन्धानेन) प्रयोगः अनेन सूच्यते । मनसा मन्त्रानुसन्धानेनis the meaning of Om here. The word तूष्णीम् is a kriyAvis'EshaNAtmaka avyaya. मनसा मन्त्रानुसन्धानेनappears to be trtIyAnta rUpa. There was a discussion in another thread on BVP how trtIyAnta rUpa can be adverbial. Silently, is being used here metaphorically in the sense of mentally, meditationally. The syllable Om here is being used here metaphoricallyin an adverbial silence :silently->mentally->meditationally. Culturally conventionalized metaphorical expressions settle down as idioms in any culture. The syllable'Om' with an extreme unparalleled unquestionable topmostsacralityin the Vedic culture being used as a substitute for many routine expressions such as expression of consent or silently->mentally->meditationallyand such usage turning into the idiom of that culture is not only natural but seems to be the beauty of that culture.
