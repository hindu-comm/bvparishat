This last response of Dr Ramanujan bears out very well and corroborates my understanding/interpretation of the debated statement. It was recorded in this List just a few hours before Ramanujan's.

  

The pitting by Ramanujan of *tūṣṇim* against *mantra*

was also set forth by me

in terms of the *anirukta* pittedagainst the*nirukta* mode,

 or equally, the *manasā*pitted against the*vācā* mode.

  

The logic of the acts pertaining to Prajāpati being done mentally was also brought out in my mail.

  

My adverbial supposition also got a confirmation.

  

It was my attempt to understand something

that I had come across, in fact, for the first time.

  

I have only to say, with Kālidāsa,

*ā paritoṣād viduṣām*

*na sādhu manye **prayoga**-vijñānam !*

*  
*

A testimony from Dr Ramanujan would always be highly valued, especially in the context of Vedic interpretation, where we have to struggle to find a match for him in the entire country.
