Thanks Prof. Kannan for this suggestion. Do you have the *vati* suffix in mind, either by *tena tulyaṃ kriyā cedvatiḥ* (A 5.1.115) or *tadarham* (A 5.1.117), to get an adverbial indeclinable usage similar to *brāhmaṇavadvartate* (Kāśikā on 5.1.115) or *rājavatpālanam* (Kāśikā on 5.1.117)? I do not think one could get an adverbial usage with the *matup*(*vatup*) suffix by *tadasyāstyasminniti matup‌* (A 5.2.94), but I may be corrected here.

  

It is still unclear to me, however, how this usage implies that silence (*tūṣṇīṃbhāva*) is a meaning of the word *om*.
