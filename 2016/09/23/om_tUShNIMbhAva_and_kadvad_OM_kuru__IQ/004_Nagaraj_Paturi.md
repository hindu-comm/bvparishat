AadaraNIya Nityanandji,

  

1\. 'Om' having ‘tūṣṇīṃbhāva’as a meaning is possible if 'om is taken as an interjection /exclamatory expression such as 'Oh!' 'Ah!'

  

'Mm!!' as a response-exclamation or a soliloquy expression is well known. Placing a vowel in front of such expressions with consonants alone is usual.

  

An actual usage /lakshya on which the compiler/lexicographer is basing his ‘tūṣṇīṃbhāva’meaning needs to be located.

  

2. 'kuru' 'kurukuru' are frequent in spells. What probably the lexicographer means is that just as the 'k' in kuru has a spell effect, Om too has a spell effect.
