AadaraNIya Nityanandji,

  

As always, your corrections to Omam dhyayanti etc. are all impeccable.

  

Durgādāsaji's second interpretation to *oṃnamaḥ śivāya* also was a pleasant addition to my knowledge.

  

I would only add that your derivation of Om from the root 'av' , though undoubtedly justifiable, is, in my opinion , only one of the ways of understanding that 'discovered' 'revealed' sound. As you know, it is one of the 'sound'-form manifestations of Brahman. It is derivable and underivable, meaningful and beyond 'meaning' at the same time. Human articulation or oral sound production can get as close as possible to it, but can never reproduce it perfectly. It is the 'audible' form of silence.

  

Om.
