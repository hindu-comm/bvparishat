The commitment of the University to preserve the philosophical and spiritual heritage of this region led to the establishment of DPRC. The Centre focuses on creating academic platforms for philosophical discourses focusing on Dvaita Vedānta of Madhvācārya. The larger idea is to integrate the Indian knowledge system into that of the world. Since its inception, the Centre has brought out five scholarly publications, and organised two international summer schools, two workshops and a national seminar. It also conducts two courses every year on Bhagavadgītā, and Indian ethics and epics. An advisory board of 10 eminent scholars ensures active guidance and support to the Centre.
