Jains' use of closely allied words *niṣidhi*, *nisidhi*, *niṣiḍhi*, *niśidhi* in the meaning of a 'tomb', 'memorial for a Jain monk' or 'the (last) resting place' is consideredto be related to*niṣādya* (निषद्या-)'a small bed or couch, resting place,' perhaps related to *n**iṣīdat*निषीदत्- 'sitting down, sittingon; settling or sinking down; resting in or on.'

  

Besides Jain prakrits like ardhamāgadhi, this term is also found in Kannada classical texts of medieval period, where *nisidhi***,***nisidhige* are mentioned in the meaning of 'tomb', 'the last resting place', 'place of study' and as 'a pilgrim center of Jain monks'.S. Settar in his book on "Inviting Death" says: "not less than three dozen records of Śravaṇa Beḷgoḷa refer to the term *nisidhi* spelling it in a variety of ways" (Inviting Death: Indian Attitude Towards the Ritual Death,BRILL, 1989,p. 121).

  

Hope this helps,

Suresh.
