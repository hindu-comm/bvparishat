Namaste Joshi ji



(I have placed this discussion in the thread related to ‘Entropy’ that you had initiatied, for convenience. Your current post was in the subject line of ‘danda-maatha’ - RE: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Meaning of "Dandamaathah". I am leaving the rest of the thread below, as it has some relevant information for this post. ).



1. Thanks.



2. On \< your Sanskrit word for entropy and for other words I listed
\> - I have placed the inputs and initial exercises to be done by the scientist to give the required feed for Samskruth linguist to begin the exercise and meet your exacting expectations of \< Anvarthaka Samjna> = Technically Appropriate communicating word for ‘entropy’ in Samskruth.



The word ‘entropy’, seen in usage, has multiple meanings and scientific technicalities associated with it. These meanings of ‘ entropy’ carry
‘ inherent leanings towards a world view, theology and perception of a scientist to point towards a phenomenon, described in technical mathematics’. 



Unless these details are analyzed thread bare and the ‘ exacting communication desired = Vivkashitaartha, is given by the scientist, the Samskruth linguist cannot begin the exercise of ‘ unique word –formation’ ( = Vivakshiata –Artha –Eka Vaachaka – Shabda). In the absence of this critical ground exercise, one can surely create a
‘Frankenstein monsters of words wrapped with ‘Pratyaya’s from Panini’
and ‘ cause confusion to later generations’. This is clearly following the model of Monier Williams Dictionary with ‘ L’ Category words ‘ incorporated in to ‘Sanskrit Lexicon’ (about 100 plus years ago) and ‘ Creating confusion Confounded’ in study of Samskrutham using Standard
Standing works like Amara-Kosha, Shabda Kalpadruma ( for Bhashaa) and
Nirukta ( for Chandas).



This is why I am repeatedly pointing to the need of ‘**Science Technicality Education for Samskruth Linguists to formulate modern Scientific Vocabulary in Samskruth’.**



**3. Here the choice is clear** **and a critical one for Sanskrit: Battle; and I did ask the question, in a metaphorical sense : Who are the takers of this challenge to lead the project : Harvard Or Benares ?
**:



Here,



One can opt for a ‘ Sanskrit-Science- Lexicon’ with ‘ quick run vocabulary’ as a working convenience of ‘today , disconnected from ‘ past’ . The consequence of which would be to create and pass on ‘ confusion confounded’ for later generations.



**OR** 



Diligently Do the ground-work and provide the inputs for \< ‘Science Technicality Education for Samskruth Linguists> to create
Language Appropriate \< Samskrutha Aadhunika Vijnana Paribhashaa =
Samskruth Modern Scientific Vocabulary’. >



This work needs a foundational knowledge of the ‘Yogas and Prakriyas ’ needed to ‘ Technically Structure the Samskruth Vocabulary’ . i.e. Yoga way of structuring Samskruth Vocabulary ( = Vivakshitaartha- Yogena -


( Shihsta –Yogya – Samartha) - Samskrutha -Pada – Nirmiti) .



4. Coming back to the word ‘Entropy’, I cannot say whether the
‘other / english language users’ adopted the technical Greek origin word ‘entropy’ and created social usage terms like ‘ economic entropy, Social entropy’ and the like. Clarity is needed on how to further process compound words with ‘entropy’ communicating a different meaning altogether – grammatically and lexically in the linguistic exercise for Samskruth word- enhancement.



Unless the ‘Artha’ = meaning and purpose of the given word is firmed up, the next step of exercise would be like driving without a GPS and Clarification on where to go – How and Why ? 



I Look forward for inputs as requested above on the word ‘ Entropy’ for the benefit of Samskruth Linguist to begin their expertise exercise.
