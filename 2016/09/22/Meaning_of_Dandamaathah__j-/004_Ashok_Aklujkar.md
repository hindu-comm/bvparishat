I consider it probable that panthāḥ in the sources cited so far is a (Kāśikā-contemporary or pre-Kāśikā) wrong reading for manthāḥ ‘curning stick/rod’.  
(a) In many Indian scripts p and m are close in appearance. A reader/scribe can mistake one for the other.  
(b) I cannot think of any compound expression or context in which pathin definitely comes close to the meaning of (manthāḥ —>) mātha. In other words, the Kāśikā and its commentators may be doing the best they could under the circumstance they faced; sthitasya gatiś cintanīyā.  
(c) The transfer from daṇḍamātha ‘who churns with a stick or with the rod-like part of the churning instrument (as opposed to the grooved extension/end of the churning instrument, which extension/end leads to getting the desired result, butter etc., quickly and with less effort’) to the idiomatic expression dāṇḍamāthika ‘one (the runner) who acts (unjudiciously) like a stick-churner’ seems straightforward.  
  
I share Dr. H.N. Bhat’s implicit advice to Dr. N.R. Joshi that questions regarding the meanings of words should be asked with a specification of the context (immediate as well as general).
