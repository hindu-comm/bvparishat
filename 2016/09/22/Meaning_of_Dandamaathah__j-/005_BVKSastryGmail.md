Namaste



1. On the statement \< Mr. Joshi **doesn't believe** there can be two different meaning contextually for any word or literal or literary meaning **for a word than etymological meaning**. \> let us stop and think for a moment : Why is such a question even being raised ? and then ‘ persistently’ ? For a moment, please keep apart Joshi. What do we as ‘ students of Samskruth’ believe OR Prove OR Establish’ ? How ? Why ? For What Purpose ? 



2. It is in this context I seek some clarifications on the ‘ **belief issue’** about the meaning of a word’. ( knowing Dr. Joshi’s science background and the deep study he has made ). Technically the entire issue is about ‘Pada-Artha – sambandha’. OR extended way of stating it as \<Vaak –Artha – Sampruktataa>. If we can not understand the ‘ nature of the problem’ and ‘ acknowledge the problem, articulate it clearly for better engagement’, the effort to reject the question
also ends up as ‘ another belief’. One can easily dismiss it as ‘ simple social convention /



Please do not quote back the texts which ‘ have already progressed by a priori acceptance of the given model of Shada /Vak –Arth Sambandha’, and with a hidden hypothesis that the issue is limited to the ‘Sanskrit’ (due to the nature of the group here). Does the text or ‘poorvacharyas’ preventing us from debating the ‘Shabda-Shakti Prakashana/ Vimarsha Tattva’ for Non-Sanskrit languages in a larger context ?



3. The question, in Joshi’s mind and it seems to me, to have a wider backdrop of ‘ Naama as ‘ abhidhana’ for a ‘ Roopa – Samjni’? debate. The illustration is specific application of a principle for test.



3a) Would the elements of ‘Abhidhana’ ( comprehended as Dravya, Aakruti, Guna, Kriyaa, Jaati..) inhere in to the elements of ‘ Nama’ ?

If so, How is it explained ? Would this be a theory or belief OR verifiable statement ? Vyavahara is \< depending on the context the correct context. \>. Does the theory go beyond this ?

 Does it extend to all categorizations of Prakruti, Pratyaya, Pada, Upasarga ? Or is it localized ?



 IF there be such a relation, would it be Unique or Contextual ( = layered as ‘ Panchasu Adhikaraneshu,) making meaning to be multivalent and also contextual; ( and for this reason needing nirukti and NOT Kosha ? )

Can this be tested for ALL World-Language-Words OR is this limited to one language context of Samskrutham Or Is this further
limited to a ‘paribhashaa’ model within one domain of Studies documented in Samskrutham ? in which case \< depending on the context the correct context. \> is correct; Each Scholar goes to create ‘Shabda jaalam mahaaranyam, buddheh bhramana –kaaranam’. 



4. If I were to imagine the question of Dr. Joshi, for the specific word ‘Vacaspatya etymology for दण्डमाथ ‘ and stretch it in to its basic issue.

It appears to me as a basic exploration on linguistic science by a material-scientist, on :



How is the relation of ‘word’ as ‘Shabda ( = streaming sounds produced with intention by a speaker) with ‘Artha’ ( = Purpose , Meaning, Wealth) to be understood for its permeation to elements of Shabda ? What are traditional theories on ‘Shabda –Artha – Shakti –Yoga in the context of ‘ Given language context = ‘ukti- vishesha’ ? If one thinks of another technical statement in this context, ‘Sarvam Brahma-mayam Jagat’ / yah shivao naama-roopaabhyam jagadaatmatayaa sthitah’ – then the mundane word discussion of ‘ ‘ may end up as serious as ‘ mahavakya’ with an effort to find out the ‘True (Word) Name of a Given Form’. 



(Many are comfortable to accept the ‘ inheritance class’ in a programming language context without a question, for some how NATURE seems to make it work ! Is Joshi’s issue some thing related to ‘ inheritance class’ ? ).



My intervention is only limited to the point indicated by the word in the post \< **doesn't believe** > . I look forward for scholars response directly to Dr. Joshi.
