Mr. Joshi doesn't believe there can be two different meaning contextually for any word or literal or literary meaning for a word than etymological meaning. He never gives the context than a book than to decide the correct meaning as he believes in etymological meaning to be correct for any context. Hence he is asking for the etymology for any word. Here also happened the same,

Vacaspatya gives the etymology  

**दण्डमाथ**

**\[L=24196\]\[p=**[**3436**](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/VCPScan/2013/web/webtc/servepdf.php?page=3436)**\]**दण्डमाथ¦पु० दण्डाकारो माथः पन्थाः शा० त० । प्रधानपथे  
दण्डमाथं धावति ठक् । दाण्डमाथिक तत्रधावके नि० ।

दण्डाकारो माथः - पन्थाः

And gives the derivation of दाण्डमाथिक.

Straight path or highway as the context require. But without the context the correct meaning cannot be decided. Straight like दण्ड can mean short cut, path without circumvention. माध is not derivedd and he has gives the meaning पन्थाः without any derivation as given by you.

It is left to you depending on the context the correct context.
