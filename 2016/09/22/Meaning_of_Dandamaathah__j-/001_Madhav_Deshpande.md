Dear Dr. Joshi,

  

  The word daṇḍamātha (दण्डमाथ) occurs as an example in the commentary Kāśikāvṛtti on Pāṇini' sūtra (4.4.37). The commentary says that the word mātha has the same meaning as pathin "road, street, path". The word daṇḍamāthika has the sense of "a person who runs along a path (straight like a) daṇḍa (daṇḍamāthaṃ dhāvati). Pāṇini's rule says that in the sense of dhāvati "one who runs" one can have the ending added to a formation with mātha as the second member (māthottarapadāt).
It is one of those rare words that occurs only as an example in grammatical commentaries, but is not known in Sanskrit usage found in available literature. It is possible that some of these expressions were used in Pāṇini's home region of Śalātura in the Swat Valley, and were unknown in the central areas of India.
