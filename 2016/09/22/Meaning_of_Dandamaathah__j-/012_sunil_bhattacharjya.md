Dear Dr. Sastry,  
  

I appreciate your point of view. Let us take the word "entropy". Scientists should may in easy for the Sanskrit scholars to coin the appropriate Sanskrit word. The earliest use of the word "Entropy" has been in "Thermodynamics", and the fundamental meaning of this word, which anybody should be able to understand in is : "measure of unavailable energy". May be, this will help the Sanskrit scholars to find the appropriate word.  
  

Regards,  

SKB
