Dear Dr. Joshi,



  I am wondering if anyone has taken a look at the various terminological dictionaries published by the state governments in India, deliberately created to find Sanskrit-based technical terms for administrative and educational areas. I know of a Padanāmakośa published by the Govt of Maharashtra for administrative terminology, and I believe they have published such kośas for other areas. One already sees the use of these terms on signs in government offices in Maharashtra. Creation of Sanskrit based terms for modern science is at least as old as the production of vernacular textbooks. I remember that when I was studying at the New English School in Pune, in Marathi medium, our laboratory was prayogaśālā. Oxygen was Prāṇavāyu, Nitrogen was Natravāyu, Carbon-die-Oxide was Karba-dvi-Prāṇavāyu, and so on and so forth. So, the process of producing Sanskrit based terminologies is an ongoing process in many states. This existing body of publications in different state needs to be looked at in the present discussion. The Sanskrit based terms are not the same in different regions. One good example is Śikṣā-mantrī "education minister" would become a minister of punishment in Marathi, and so the common Marathi term is Śikṣaṇa-Mantrī. Similarly, the prime minister of India, in Nehru's time, was generally called Pant Pradhan in Marathi (going back to the usage of the Peshwa period), which is now increasingly replaced by the Hindi Pradhan Mantri. There are lots of interesting issues.
