Dear BVK,

All right give me please your Sanskrit word for entropy and for other words I listed. Regards. N. R. Joshi.

Namaste



1. On the statement \< Mr. Joshi **doesn't believe** there can be two different meaning contextually for any word or literal or literary meaning **for a word than etymological meaning**. \> let us stop and think for a moment : Why is such a question even being raised ? and then ‘ persistently’ ? For a moment, please keep apart Joshi. What do we as ‘ students of Samskruth’ believe OR Prove OR Establish’ ? How ? Why ? For What Purpose ? 



2. It is in this context I seek some clarifications on the ‘ **belief issue’** about the meaning of a word’. ( knowing Dr. Joshi’s science background and the deep study he has made ). Technically the entire issue is about ‘Pada-Artha – sambandha’. OR extended way of stating it as \<Vaak –Artha – Sampruktataa>. If we can not understand the ‘ nature of the problem’ and ‘ acknowledge the problem, articulate it clearly for better engagement’, the effort to reject the question
also ends up as ‘ another belief’. One can easily dismiss it as ‘ simple social convention /



Please do not quote back the texts which ‘ have already progressed by a priori acceptance of the given model of Shada /Vak –Arth Sambandha’, and with a hidden hypothesis that the issue is limited to the ‘Sanskrit’ (due to the nature of the group here). Does the text or ‘poorvacharyas’ preventing us from debating the ‘Shabda-Shakti Prakashana/ Vimarsha Tattva’ for Non-Sanskrit languages in a larger context ?



3. The question, in Joshi’s mind and it seems to me, to have a wider backdrop of ‘ Naama as ‘ abhidhana’ for a ‘ Roopa – Samjni’? debate. The illustration is specific application of a principle for test.



3a) Would the elements of ‘Abhidhana’ ( comprehended as Dravya, Aakruti, Guna, Kriyaa, Jaati..) inhere in to the elements of ‘ Nama’ ?

If so, How is it explained ? Would this be a theory or belief OR verifiable statement ? Vyavahara is \< depending on the context the correct context. \>. Does the theory go beyond this ?

 Does it extend to all categorizations of Prakruti, Pratyaya, Pada, Upasarga ? Or is it localized ?



 IF there be such a relation, would it be Unique or Contextual ( = layered as ‘ Panchasu Adhikaraneshu,) making meaning to be multivalent and also contextual; ( and for this reason needing nirukti and NOT Kosha ? )

Can this be tested for ALL World-Language-Words OR is this limited to one language context of Samskrutham Or Is this further
limited to a ‘paribhashaa’ model within one domain of Studies documented in Samskrutham ? in which case \< depending on the context the correct context. \> is correct; Each Scholar goes to create ‘Shabda jaalam mahaaranyam, buddheh bhramana –kaaranam’. 



4. If I were to imagine the question of Dr. Joshi, for the specific word ‘Vacaspatya etymology for दण्डमाथ ‘ and stretch it in to its basic issue.

It appears to me as a basic exploration on linguistic science by a material-scientist, on :



How is the relation of ‘word’ as ‘Shabda ( = streaming sounds produced with intention by a speaker) with ‘Artha’ ( = Purpose , Meaning, Wealth) to be understood for its permeation to elements of Shabda ? What are traditional theories on ‘Shabda –Artha – Shakti –Yoga in the context of ‘ Given language context = ‘ukti- vishesha’ ? If one thinks of another technical statement in this context, ‘Sarvam Brahma-mayam Jagat’ / yah shivao naama-roopaabhyam jagadaatmatayaa sthitah’ – then the mundane word discussion of ‘ ‘ may end up as serious as ‘ mahavakya’ with an effort to find out the ‘True (Word) Name of a Given Form’. 



(Many are comfortable to accept the ‘ inheritance class’ in a programming language context without a question, for some how NATURE seems to make it work ! Is Joshi’s issue some thing related to ‘ inheritance class’ ? ).



My intervention is only limited to the point indicated by the word in the post \< **doesn't believe** > . I look forward for scholars response directly to Dr. Joshi.



Regards

BVK Sastry

Mr. Joshi doesn't believe there can be two different meaning contextually for any word or literal or literary meaning for a word than etymological meaning. He never gives the context than a book than to decide the correct meaning as he believes in etymological meaning to be correct for any context. Hence he is asking for the etymology for any word. Here also happened the same,

Vacaspatya gives the etymology

**दण्डमाथ**

**\[L=24196\]\[p=**[**3436**](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/VCPScan/2013/web/webtc/servepdf.php?page=3436)**\]**दण्डमाथ¦पु० दण्डाकारो माथः पन्थाः शा० त० । प्रधानपथे  
दण्डमाथं धावति ठक् । दाण्डमाथिक तत्रधावके नि० ।

दण्डाकारो माथः - पन्थाः

And gives the derivation of दाण्डमाथिक.

Straight path or highway as the context require. But without the context the correct meaning cannot be decided. Straight like दण्ड can mean short cut, path without circumvention. माध is not derivedd and he has gives the meaning पन्थाः without any derivation as given by you.

It is left to you depending on the context the correct context.
