Dear Ashok,

  

  Your suggestion "I consider it probable that panthāḥ in the sources cited so far is a (Kāśikā-contemporary or pre-Kāśikā) wrong reading for manthāḥ ‘curning stick/rod’. ....The transfer from daṇḍamātha ‘who churns with a stick or with the rod-like part of the churning instrument (as opposed to the grooved extension/end of the churning instrument, which extension/end leads to getting the desired result, butter etc., quickly and with less effort’) to the idiomatic expression dāṇḍamāthika ‘one (the runner) who acts (unjudiciously) like a stick-churner’ seems straightforward." sounds like a reasonable guess to me. I wonder if any manuscripts of Kāśikā consulted by Bronkhorst, Malhar Kulkarni, and others have manthāḥ as a variant reading. That would go a long way in supporting your suggestion.
