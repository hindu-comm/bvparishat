1\. To use Sanskrit for articulating modern academic disciplines is not to claim ('gloat') that Sanskrit is good for science or Sanskrit alone is good for (articulating) science or Sanskrit is the best for (articulating) science. It is in fact, to demonstrate that Sanskrit has a potential to articulate science too or to demonstrate that Sanskrit too ,like many languages of the world, including modern Indian languages that are being used to communicate science ideas,has potential to communicate ideas of science. It is in fact, redundantto try to prove the potential of any language to articulate any field. Even a tribal language currently with a limited vocabulary can 'grow' into a science-articulating language when employed for that purpose. But attempts in the case of Sanskrit language to use it for communicating science are probably being madeto counter the perceptions being created that it is a liturgical language and as such suited only for that purpose and/or it is a language suited to communicate only pre-modern ideas andas such is 'dead' now.

  

2.How ideas about Sanskritare good/the bestfor computersare all layman's notions and how professionals look at the way the knowledge in ancient Sanskrit works can be used for the purposes of computational linguistics particularly that related to Indian languages is different from this layman's understanding has been repeatedly mentioned in this list.

  

3\. Loss of prAtis'Akhyas and Panini are not connected.
