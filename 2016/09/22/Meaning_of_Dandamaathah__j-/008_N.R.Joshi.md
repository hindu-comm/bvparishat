Prof Aklujkar, Prof Deshpande and Dr.H.N. Bhat and BVK Shastri

Thanks for explaining the meaning of “Dandamaathah”. I am glad to know that my question generated scholarly discussion on BVP.

I will follow the suggestions of Prof Aklujkar and Dr Bhat in future.

Ref 1 Panini reinterpreted by Charudeva Shastri (p130). He did mention, “Dandaakaaro maathah. And gives meaning as a short cut.

Ref2 Apte Dict(p434) Maathah-- stirring, churning, way, road.

Apte Dict (p244) principal road, highway.

My confusion was not taking Danda as straight stick.

Maatha may be connected to Manthanam churning.

Thanks for adding to my knowledge. N
