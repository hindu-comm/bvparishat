Dear Ashok,

  

  Since Patañjali has no Bhāṣya on P.4.4.37, and does not cite either daṇḍamātha or daṇḍamāthika, our first source for this example is the Kāśikāvṛtti, and its reading of māthaḥ panthāḥ, as you suggest, could possibly be a copyist's error for māthaḥ manthāḥ. What we know from Pāṇini's rule is that he had in his view an example of a compound ending with the word mātha, and the rule itself prescribes the ending -ika in the sense of dhāvati. We don't know what that example might have been, and no such expression is attested in the ancient literature.
