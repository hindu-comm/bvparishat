Namaste



1. On \< Why can't Sanskrit adopt words from other languages directly? \> - By all means ! New words are welcome to Sanskrit. One can induct any ‘ user given word’ as long as associated inputs are provided for the ‘Samskruth –Word Generator –engine’ to process it. In the specific case, entropy : would this be a pratipadika or Dhatu , as the usage
points to invite the appropriate affix lines ? Is it a singular entity or a pre-processed entity, as the etymology of the word shows?



2. On \< Such would be the definition ofसंज्ञा\> To bring in a ‘ Samjna’ word for Samskruth rule based processing, Panini has provided specific guidelines. Following that any given word can be processed.



3. On \< Would there be a prohibition in adoption? \> - Within ‘Paninian Rule frame’, Certainly there is no prohibition or hesitation or resistance in such ‘ new word welcome’ and ‘ subjecting it to the process of ‘Sanskritization’. If such Sanskritization should not end up as ‘ many simplified words that are Sanskritized in Sanskrit Conversational Classes’ and retain the ‘Pristine Technical Meaning’, there is a certain amount of care that needs to be taken.



 The request for the ‘ new word inductors’ is to provide the input data that needs to be associated with the word: namely, the ending, nature of word, gender, pre-processing undergone, the meaning-dimensions associated with the ‘Pratipadika /Dhatu phase of the new word’.



4. In the case of the given sampler word ‘ entropy’, that Joshi ji desired , if all these details are firmed up, then the Samskruth linguists can take over and provide the usable forms for Science Teachers.



 **Failing which, such new induction and usage will yield one more flavor of ‘Anglo- European – Prakrut’, to decode which a new grammar would have to be written. And a new branch of ‘Anglo-Euro- Indology and Anglo-Euro-Indo-linguistics ’ needs to start as a new discipline.** The ‘ new word’ cannot be inducted to the ‘Sanskrit fold’ like ‘ one more addition of a ‘begum’ to ‘ *Baadshaa’s Janana, ever expanding by facny* ’ using the generic statement ‘raajaano bahu vallbhah’. Of course, Monier Williams path breaking effort has opened this gate way with ‘ L’ category words to about forty thousand words, two hundred years ago. And the review of this remains a ‘ yet to do exercise’ by Sanskrit lexicon enthusiasts.



 Such exercise would neither enrich or degrade Paninian Standard for Samskrutham. But may be construed as a ‘ Samskruth Awareness Builder with new vocabulary’ for this century.



 Who would be the inspired initiators for this pre- Sanskritizing process inputs to induct Science words to Samskrutham, starting with the sampler word ‘entropy’ ? Harvard Or Benares ?
