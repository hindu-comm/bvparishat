Namaskar!

For my own amusement I wanted to find out Sanskrit words for English scientific words like Complex number, Entropy, Probability, Stochastic process, Heat, Electric power, Inductive reactance etc.



Out of these efforts of mine, I gradually reached my New VarNavaada with fixed meanings to VarNas and to Upasargas.



I needed Anvarthaka Samjnas, not mere Sanskritization based on phonetic similitude.

Samjna should instantly explain the scientific concept behind it so that students never forget that. Thanks. N. R. Joshi
