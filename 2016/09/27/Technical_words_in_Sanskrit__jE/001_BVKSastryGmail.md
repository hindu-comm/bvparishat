Namaste



1. On \< I needed Anvarthaka Samjnas, not mere Sanskritization based on phonetic similitude.\>



**BVK Sastry**: An ‘Anvarthaka –Samjna’ means literally ‘ Formation of a word ( = pada –nirmiti) , following a rule based process ( Prakriyaa – Niyama –Anu-Gunam) , with an intention (Yatha Vaktru –Chintitam Abhimatam) - which will properly cover the all shades of speakers intended primary concept ( Vivakshitaartha- Eka-Vaachaka)’.



 This is the technicality of the ‘Paribhashaa –Samjna Karana’, the same challenge that was debated in an earlier thread on ‘Finding Appropriate Brand- Name for a Game’. This cannot be a ‘ crowd sourcing exercise’ or simple lexicon equivalence building by partial perception of meaning. Not even a pure linguistic exercise deriving the word from a ‘Dhatu’ and explaining ! The word ‘entropy’ has more mathematics, deeper paradigms of matter –philosophy-energy related world views’ to be included in making the ‘Anvarthaka Samjna’
after which new dimensions of problems start from pure Samskruth linguist In deciding the ‘ ending –gender –processes’. If ‘Sanskrit’ has ‘ Non-Translatable’ words, so does other languages and disciplines.

2. On \< Samjna should instantly explain the scientific concept behind it so that students never forget that \>



BVK Sastry: The extraction of meaning from a given ‘Samjna’ will NEVER be instantaneous, as the DECODING INVOVLES A PROCESS and VALIDATION .
This process can be fast in the context of a specific language usage context and community. But Certainly not for a newbie ! There needs to be a deeper deliberation of Techno-Linguistic Inter disciplinary exercise ( Samskrutha Tanta – Jnana Pada- Kosha Nirmiti), an exercise
on the ‘To Do’ list of Yoga-Samskrutham University. **SEE MORE
BELOW\*.**

** \* SEE MORE BELOW (The information below is to explain the deep
complexities ingrained in Dr. Joshi’s cryptic post reading - \< For my own amusement I wanted to find out Sanskrit words for English scientific words\>. This is not a trivial question; it has a deep issues involved in it. No offense intended. It is just to highlight the insight of Dr. Joshi in framing a question in simple and focused terms. **

 Joshi ji, When you ask for ‘ Anvarthaka –Samjnas’ for words like ‘ \< Complex number, Entropy, Probability, Stochastic process, Heat, Electric power, Inductive reactance etc. \>
drawn from a multitude of disciplines like Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Engineering and the like, it is a Discipline Specific Sanskritization and Technical Word formation exercises. This calls for the Samskruth Linguist to understand the ‘Technicality of the given concept, like Entropy…Stochastic process…etc;. **Thus it is a multi-discipline interactive technical exercise. It cannot be a open ended question for a ‘ language – literature –Philosophy team’ as a ‘Generic question’. **



 If the exercise is to be for Samskruth - language, then the Scientist needs to help Linguist to understand the
concept for which the new –technical word is required. In your post, you are asking a ‘Samskruth word’ as if it is a ‘Online Translation on the fly exercise, as advertised by many ‘service providers’ ! And for an already framed technical word in a specific discipline.



 Let me illustrate the deeper issues in this exercise that demands involvement of right kind of People and Adequate –Appropriate Resources from institutions and Required clarity of Panini- Patanjali- Yaska pedagogy for such a ‘Techno-Linguistic Exercise ( called Yoga way for Samskrutham; also called as Vedanga Shadanga -Vyakarana Paddhati) and a contemporary update to cover modern sciences and social disciplines. Loose usage and proliferation of scientific terms, following the ‘ illusory imposed simplicity’ of ‘ English likeness’ in ‘ social conversation chains does not help the science teams.



 The ‘ lost pedagogy and paradigm of Yoga-Samskrutham, needs to be restored to rebuild the ‘ dreamed paradise of Sanskrit as the best suited language for Computers / Technology Education and Technical Vocabulary build’. At present the Sanskrit resources are hyper actively engages in preparation of battle –mode engagement and promotion of Sanskrit awareness through conversation workshops. True these are critical and necessary; but these are not the ‘ rooms to meet the criterion of sufficiency and efficiency’ - where your specific question can be taken up for clear and scholarly engagement’.



  Here below, I provide the sampler detailing the deep challenges involved in your question on the Sanskrit –Samjna-Karana for the word ‘Entropy’. 



 The prerequisite exercise needed here would be
: To Educate the Samskruth linguist with all the associated inputs that are used in defining the word ‘entropy’ by Science teams and usage in social parlance. The Samskruth linguist needs the word –history and social usage evolution for the word ‘entropy’ ( provided below). Add to this the shades of usage like – ‘Shannon entropy’ introduced by Claude E. Shannon in his 1948 paper "A Mathematical Theory of Communication". Shannon entropy provides an absolute limit on the best possible average length of lossless encoding or compression of an information source. Look at the metaphorical and technical usages like Social entropy (<http://www.socialentropy.com/engine/> ) ; economic entropy ( <http://www.eoht.info/page/Economic+entropy> ) .





In this case, the exercise would have to start from the \< the etymology of term entropy, symbol S, from the Greek word τροπη (tropos), meaning “transformation”, coined by German physicist Rudolf Clausius in 1865. \> . Explore the link <http://www.eoht.info/page/Entropy+(etymology)> to see the plurality of Scientific definitions spread over the period 1865 to 1983 for this word and the usage contexts . And how would a Samskruth – Language Scholar be able to give you ‘Anvarthaka – Samjna’ without comprehending through proper education all the technical complexities and dependencies and paradigms of matter –energy – behavior related mathematics that sit below this one word?





The current definition of entropy in science reads as below:



**Entropy –Science Definition **: Entropy is defined technically as below (<http://www.nmsea.org/Curriculum/Primer/what_is_entropy.htm> )

**What is entropy? **The word entropy is sometimes confused with energy. Although they are related quantities, they are distinct. As described in previous sections, energy measures the capability of an object or system to do work.



Entropy, on the other hand, is a measure of the "disorder" of a system. What "disorder refers to is really the number of different microscopic states a system can be in, given that the system has a particular fixed composition, volume, energy, pressure, and temperature. By "microscopic states", we mean the exact states of all the molecules making up the system.



The idea here is that just knowing the composition, volume, energy, pressure, and temperature doesn't tell you very much about the exact state of each molecule making up the system. For even a very small piece of matter, there can be trillions of different microscopic states, all of which correspond to the sample having the same composition, volume, energy, pressure, and temperature. But you're ignorant of exactly which one the system is in at any given moment - and that turns out to be important.



Why should it be important, after all, if you know the bulk properties. Isn't that all one usually needs? It turns out that no, in fact if you want to, say, exact energy from say steam and convert it to useful work, those details turn out to be crucial! (More on this below).

For those that are technically inclined, the exact definition is
Entropy = (Boltzmann's constant k) x logarithm of number of possible states = k log(N).



Since the logarithm of a number always increases as the number increases, we see that the more possible states that the system can be in (given that it has a particular volume, energy, pressure, and temperature), then the greater the entropy.



Again, because we can't see which particular microscopic state a system is in, people often like to say that entropy is quantitative measure of how uncertain or ignorant one is about the exact, detailed, microscopic state of a system. Or, another popular way of saying this is that entropy measures the microscopic disorder of a system.



**Etymology of word ‘ Entropy’ **: - See :
(<http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=entropy> ) - History of the word ‘Entropy : <http://www.eoht.info/page/Entropy+(etymology)>



entropy (n.) Look up entropy at Dictionary.com1868, from German Entropie "measure of the disorder of a system," coined 1865 (on analogy of Energie) by German physicist Rudolph Clausius (1822-1888), in his work on the laws of thermodynamics, from Greek entropia "a turning toward," from en "in" (see en- (2)) + trope "a turning, a transformation" (see trope). The notion is supposed to be "transformation contents." Related: Entropic.

It was not until 1865 that Clausius invented the word entropy as a suitable name for what he had been calling "the transformational content of the body." The new word made it possible to state the second law in the brief but portentous form: "The entropy of the universe tends toward a maximum," but Clausius did not view entropy as the basic concept for understanding that law. He preferred to express the physical meaning of the second law in terms of the concept of disgregation, another word that he coined, a concept that never became part of the accepted structure of thermodynamics. \[Martin J. Klein, "The Scientific Style of Josiah Willard Gibbs," in "A Century of Mathematics in America," 1989\]
