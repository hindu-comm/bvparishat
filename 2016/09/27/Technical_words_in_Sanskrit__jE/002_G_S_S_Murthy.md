Dear Scholars,

The exposition of Prof.BVK Sastry on coining of equivalent technical words in Sanskrit is indeed very scholarly and admirable.What I give below is a supplement to proceed in this task.

When Panini or an earlier Grammarian used the word "guNa" or "Vrddhi" for certain specific grammatical operations, he endowed commonly used words with specific meaning in the domain of Grammar. Similarly, scientists/ mathematicians endow commonly used words with specific meaning in the domain of the subject. "Prime", "well-behaved function", "REAL number", "COMPLEX number", "color (in quantum physics)" "evolution" "speed/velocity" etc. etc. Without mindlessly translating such words into an equivalent Sanskrit word, we will have to look at what they mean in the context and arrive at a STANDARDIZED WORD in Sanskrit. Such words need to be standardized by a Board set up for the purpose. Certainly etymology of the English word can provide some guidance. But once the Board comes up with an appropriate word, the list should become the Bible for all users.

Obviously such a board would consist of domain specialists and Sanskrit scholars.

Regards,

Murthy
