Why can't Sanskrit adopt words from other languages directly?

Such would be the definition ofसंज्ञा

As Panini says,संज्ञा is a popular articulation indicating an object

which would lack an etymological analysis. I have heard that

strained translations have been tried. Would there be a prohibition

in adoption?
