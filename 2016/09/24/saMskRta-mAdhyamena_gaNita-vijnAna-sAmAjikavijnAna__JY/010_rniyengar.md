Technical vocabulary comes from the context. If we keep context properly words phrases idioms can be coined if not already available. Sanskrit is so amenable for making words from roots. The vocabulary can be increased instead of reversing from Hindi. But keep up your work. It may take a few years but is worth it, particularly in mathematical subjects Thanks. RNI
