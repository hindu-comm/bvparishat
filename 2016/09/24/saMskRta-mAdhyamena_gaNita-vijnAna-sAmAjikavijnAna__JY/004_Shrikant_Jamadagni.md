Those who are truly fluent in sanskrit are not involved in these translations. Those who do the translations lack the fluency that is need to devise technical vocabulary. How to solve this problem?  

The great Acharya Raghuvira and his extraordinary son Shri Lokesh Chandra created technical dictionaries long long time ago. I am not sure if these translators have referred those koshas. The Hindi tech lexicon created by HRD is of very little use while creating Sanskrit words.  

  

BTW: the sanskrit-text in website has the word एवम्** in the sense of 'and' !! for e.g

सामाजिकं विज्ञानम् - संसाधनम् एवं विकास  

सामाजिकं एवं च राजनैतिकं जीवनम्
