It is a very laudable effort. I have not yet seen all the texts and documents. Some of the technical words are of concern. The Sanskrit words are transposed from Hindi. For example is it correct to say

non-conductor = ऊष्मरोधक ? The word non-conductor is not specific to Heat, or Electricity or Sound.

Any way for a beginning it is to encouraged.
