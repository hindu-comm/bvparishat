I will see the translation efforts in origin and come back. Commenting before that would be an unwanted act. However if we go through the lines that are copied by Dr Shrikant Ji show that the translation is very poor and does not serve any purpose. The whole idea is to increase the capacity of the language users to start using Skt as a medium for sience. One day it leads to some innovation.
