1\. Videos

3\. Script &

4\. Audio

One has to just register at the website to download all the material. Videos can be viewed even without registration.

  

These can be used by all stakeholders like Students, Teachers, Parents & any other learner. These tutorials are special due to following reasons.

1\. Samskrit is taught through the target language

2\. Using the Script & Presentation, any Samskrit teacher can convert their class to 100% Samskrit class.

3\. All grammar points are also provided.   

4\. Songs are presented with visuals which convey the meaning and are set to tune.

5\. To facilitate reading skills, the lessons are read with intonations. If Sloka or Song, it is rendered and Drama is enacted to facilitate children enjoy the different formats.

6\. Audios are good resources for any new learner to pick up the language.

  

These material are prepared keeping both teacher and student in focus.
