Namaste

  

I am trying to know the views of scholars here, on the basis of śāstra, its interpretation and other pramanas, about the acceptability or otherwise of same-gotra marriages. I found this argument in a newspaper report:

  

<http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/people-of-the-same-gotra-do-not-necessarily-have-the-same-origin/article498800.ece>  

  

//In India, the clan (gotra) has its origin not in the birth of people but derives from the gurus they followed. For example, families belonging to the Bharadwaja gotra are the followers of Bharadwaja Maharishi. But it does not necessarily mean that all its members belong to the same family. Different families in the same caste might have followed Bharadwaja Maharishi; hence they acquired the name of Bharadwaja gotra.//
