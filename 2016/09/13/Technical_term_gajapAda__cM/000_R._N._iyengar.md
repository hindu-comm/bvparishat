Dear Scholars,

This question concerns ancient construction methods and tools. A few of these are mentioned in the Vaastu books. Surely earth was dug. soil was compacted and foundations raised. In this connection I have come across the word गजपाद. One can of course take this to be literally "elephant-foot". However, It may refer to the heavy rammer with a broad base. Please see the figures. The shape can vary from region to region. I am curious to know the different names of this tool.

In and around Bangalore-Mysore region this is called धम्मस् (ಧಮ್ಮಸ್). I like to know what is the name of this contraption in Tamilnadu, Andhra, Malenadu, Maharashtra, ....Coastal regions, ......North India, in Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati,... etc. 

Thanks
