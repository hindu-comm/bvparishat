Sriman Ganesan,



I have been taught that *smRitis* keep changing according to *des'a-kAla-paristhiti*. Please enlighten me which is the *smRiti* that is relevant to this 21st century Hindu religion or sanatana dharma or by whatever name it is popularly known.

  

My teacher used to often quote this verse in addition to "janmanA jAyate s'UdraH............................"  
  
यथा काञ्चानतां याति कांस्यं रसविधानतः !

तथा दीक्षाविधानेनद्विजत्वं जायते नृणाम् !!

  

  

Sincerely,

Ramchander Deekonda
