To quote the article :  
  
In Germany, 14 of the top universities teach Sanskrit, classical and modern Indology compared to just four in the UK.The summer school spans a month in August every year and draws applications from across the globe.

  

Francesca Lunari, a medical student who has been studying Sanskrit at Heidelberg University, agreed.

“I am interested in psychoanalysis and must know how human thoughts originated through texts, cultures and societies. I will learn Bangla also to decipher the seminal works of Girindra Sekhar Bose, a pioneer of oriental psychiatry who has hardly been studied – even in India. Learning Sanskrit is the first step,” she said.
