Yes, TIFR's findings appeared a decade ago. They have clarified that the so called movement of the Saptarshis was actually due to the precession of the earth. Even the Dhruva appears to move due to the precession of the Earth. The apparent movement of the Saptarshis was known to the Ancient sages. However, the Saptarshi calendar or Laukika calendar, which is followed in Kashmir and the north-west hilly areas of the Himalayan slopes, has a 2,700 year cycle (for convenienece sake), where each nakshatra is taken to be traversed by the Saptarshis in one hundred years, starting from the movement from Magha to Ashlesha in 3076 BCE, and this calendar is strictly not astronomical as in reality the apparent Saptarshi movement trough a nakshatra takes more than one hundred years except in case Pushya. Further, even apparently, the Saptarshis do not appear to visit all the nakshatras.
