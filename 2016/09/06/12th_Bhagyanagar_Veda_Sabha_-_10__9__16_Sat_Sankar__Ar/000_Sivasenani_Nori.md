**12**^(**th**)**Bhagyanagar** **Veda Sabha**

**Sankara Matham, Nallakunta, Hyderabad**

**10^(th) Sept. 2016, Saturday. 7:30 am to 7:30 pm**

  

The Nori Narasimha Sastry Charitable Trust is pleased to announce that the 12^(th) Bhagyanagar Veda Sabha would be conducted at Sankara Matham, Nallakunta, Hyderabad on 10^(th) September 2016, Saturday, from 7:30 am to 7:30 pm. **All those who believe in Vedapramanya are welcome.**

  

The *parīkṣa* method is followed wherein in each round, the President and Vice-President of the sabha start reciting a *panasa* (roughly fifty words) from a random point in each *kāṇḍa;* the next pair of scholars continues from where the President and Vice-President stop; thereafter the third pair continues from where the second pair stops; and so on till all the scholars present complete chanting one *panasa* each in pairs. There would be seven rounds to cover the seven *kāṇḍa*s of the samhitā part of the Krishna Yajurveda and three rounds to cover the *Brāhmaṇa*, and one each to cover the *Āraṇyaka* and *Upaniṣat* portions. Apart from Krishnayajurveda, scholars of Rigveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda are also participating this year, who would recite at the beginning or end of each round from the relevant portions of the particular branch.

  

*Ghanapāṭhis* would recite the *ghanapāṭha* of the *panasas* in the samhita; *Kramapāṭhis* would recite the *kramapāṭha*. Only the *mūlam *is recited in the five rounds of *Brāhmaṇa, Āraṇyaka and Upaniṣat*

  

At the beginning, there would be puja (10 minutes or less) to the *Vedamātā*, and at the end *Ā**ś**īrvacana* (30 minutes), followed by felicitation of Vedic scholars (30 minutes) and distribution of *prasādam*. Lunch break is between 12:30pm and 2:30pm.
