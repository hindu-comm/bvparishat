I am looking for refutation of brahmasUtras by scholars of rest of 5 darshanas or other darshanas.

His statement is - there has been no refutation of brahmasUtras by any scholar till now. I am searching resources to confirm whether this is true or not.  

\>One may accept Brahma Sutra as per existing interpretations or can make an new one.

It is not about interpretations of brahmasUtras. It is about there being no refutation of brahmasUtras. Alternate (and often contradictory) interpretations of brahmasUtras is not under consideration yet.
