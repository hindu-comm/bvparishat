The Vedanta Sutras ascribed to Badarayana is for Vedanta school of thought. Brahma Sutra is agreeable only to Vedanta Scholl of thought. No other Darshanas consider Vedanta sutras in that sense all other Darshanas reject Brahma sutras including Buddhists, jina etc. When Vedanta is refuted by other Darshanas Brahma Sutras too stand refuted.
