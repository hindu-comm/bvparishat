Unless we know the full context of the discussion of Dr Dhaval Patelji with the Swamiji, we may not be able to understand the intent of his statement.

  

Possibility1 : When people speak of differences among different schools of Vedanta, one can justifiably respond by saying the different schools of Vedanta are just different interpretations of Brahma Sutras and none of them refutes Brahma Sutras.

  

Possibility 2: When people speak of refutations of Brahma Sutras by scholars ofother Dars'anas , one can justifiably respond by saying that these refutations are directed at a certain school of interpretation of Brahma Sutras, not directed at the Sutras themselves.

  

Possibility 3: When people speak of criticisms of Brahma Sutras by modern scholars on socio-political grounds, one can justifiably say that taking a contrary ideological position to the content of one or many of the Sutras does not amount to disproving the validity of the content of a Sutra.

  

It could have as well been a general non-polemical expression of admiration ofone's favouritebook .
