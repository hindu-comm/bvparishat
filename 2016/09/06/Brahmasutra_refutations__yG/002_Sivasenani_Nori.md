Sir

  

Let us expand the consideration set to the entire Sutra-literature. We see that if an opponent (belonging to School B) wants to refute a particular school (let us call it, A), the refutation is done as per the schematic of his own School (B). We also see a tendency to pick and choose. Not everything that the other school (A) holds is disagreeable to the Opponent (of School B). In fact, we see that many Sutras from other Schools are quoted in support! We see this in Sankarabhashya, in Kumarila quoting Vyakarana-sutras etc. Further, the very act of choosing a pratIka to comment upon is a big statement. Only something worthy of expounding is taken up to expound; occasionally a Sutra might be refuted, corrected etc, but in essence, the collection of Sutras is deemed worthy of study by the commentator. Else, he is better off composing his own text.

  

So, while Brahmasutras are as such not refuted by the other Darsanas, many concepts central to the Brahmasutras are refuted. Purvamimamsa consigns the Brahma-pratipAdaka-vAkyas of Veda to arthavAda, for instance.

  

That said, I find one aspect curious. When we ask any believer (esp. great scholars), the school to which they belong, it tends to be one or the other sub-school of Vedanta, rather than Mimamsa, Nyaya or Sankhya. Even later Mimamsa writers, say Laugakshi Bhaskara, exhibit distinct Vedantic tendencies in their invocatory and benedictory verses. Vedanta has been described as Vedantakesari (I heard it a long time back, but could not trace it, when I wanted to do so in a particular instance) in front of whom nobody dares to say anything. If this is the meaning of refutation, evidence to the contrary is thin, if at all it is there.

N. Siva Senani
