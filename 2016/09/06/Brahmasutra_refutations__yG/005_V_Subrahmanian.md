There is a book, maybe of the 17th CE, named 'vyāsa tātparya nirṇayaḥ' by Sri Ayyanna Dikṣitaḥ. In that book the thesis is: That alone is Vyāsa's (Bādarāyaṇa's) tātparya which the non-Vedāntic darshanas have taken upon as pūrvapakṣa of Vedānta. That way, the author shows how all the non-Vedāntic darshanas have taken up only the kevalādvaita of Vedānta as their purvapaksha of Vedanta darshana. In other words, the author says for all the non-vedantic schools, it is only kevalādvaita that constitutes the Vedanta darshana. He quotes from those darshanas to substantiate his point. This is a very short book, in Sanskrit, available in Bangalore.
