Dear members,

While having a discourse with a swami ji, we were in a process of agreeing to a common determiner (a common text which is agreeable to both). He suggested that brahmasutra is a text where both of us should agree, as there is no refutation of brahmasutras by any of the five darshanas.

Now the questions for me is

1\. "Are there any refutation of brahmasUtra by five other darshanas?"

2\. "Are there any refutation of brahmasUtras by other darshanas?"

3\. If any of the above is correct, what are the resources which I should explore.
