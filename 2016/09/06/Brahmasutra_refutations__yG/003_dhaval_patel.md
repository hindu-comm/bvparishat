Just to make my side clear,  
  

1\. For my purpose, 'refutation' would include refutation by 'anyone anytime' i.e. it may be as modern as yesterday.  

2\. I am looking for some work / paper / thesis where the (maybe) flaws of 'brahmasUtras' are analyzed. If there are none / insignificant, then also I am happy to accept the fact. This is just for testing the hypothesis put forward by that Swami ji.
