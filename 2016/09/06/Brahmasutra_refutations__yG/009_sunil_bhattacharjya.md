Dear friends,  
  

Pedagogically one may have to speak a lot on Advaita Vedanta, but at the scholarly level, when at all it is required, what one needs to remind the other scholars is that, for the advaitin, there is only one permanent entity, the Brahman and nothing else, i.e.,as the upanishad says :."sarvam khalvidam Brahma". One may add to that the Ajativada verse (i.e., the verse of non-creation), which Gaudapada included in his Mandukya karika, but the verse belongs originally to the original Bhagavad Gita of 745 verses. That according to Shankara is Vedanta. Shankara wrote his bhashya on the vulgate version of the Bhagavad Gita of 700 verses, but it does not mean that Shankara was not aware of the original source and the meaning of the Ajativada verse. It appears that the other Dvaita and the Vishishtadvaita scholars were so busy in refuting the works of Shankara, that they either did not have the access to or the inclination to read the Ajativada verse and the doctrine. To my mind, had Shankara been alive today, he would have objected to the use of the term "Vedanta" for any other form of Vedanta, which talks about individual existence as separate from Brahman (Dvaita) or individual existence both as separate and as non-separate from Brahman (Vishishtadvaita).
