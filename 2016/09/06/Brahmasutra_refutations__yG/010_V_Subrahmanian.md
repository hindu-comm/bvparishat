परमतमप्रतिषिद्धम् अनुमतं भवति । That which is not contradictory to us in other disciplines is admissible. Shankara says this in the Sutra bhashya 2.4.12::

  

एवं तर्हि ‘परमतमप्रतिषिद्धमनुमतं भवति’ इति न्यायात् इहापि योगशास्त्रप्रसिद्धा मनसः पञ्च वृत्तयः परिगृह्यन्ते —‘प्रमाणविपर्ययविकल्पनिद्रास्मृतयः’ (पा. यो. सू. १-१-६)नाम ।
