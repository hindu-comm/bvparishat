His statement is - there has been no refutation of brahmasUtras by any scholar till now. I am searching resources to confirm whether this is true or not.

Every interpreter of Brahma Sutra Bhashya says this. There are several hundred commentators on Brahma Sutra. So Swamji view is another view.

I am looking for refutation of brahmasUtras by scholars of rest of 5 darshanas or other darshanas.

Yoga Sankhya Buddhists Jains etc have their own sutra or sutra texts. They don’t look into Brahma sutras. They do so only if needed to support their system.



Yoga sutras, Sankhya Mimamsa, or Nyaya sutras has not been completely refuted till now. No system of thought or Darshanas or their sutras has been completely discarded or has been refuted in totality. Parts have been accepted parts have been discarded and parts have been commented by non vedantic and vedantic schools of thought or Darsanas. Hence context and a clear statement of Swami jis hypothesis is needed for scholars to comment further.
