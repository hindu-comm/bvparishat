All Vedanta Texts dealing with brahmas sutras their Commentaries sub commentaries and independent texts deals with refutation and analysis of Brahma sutras from modern books to books of yester years. I am not clear what is the Swamijis hypothesis. One may accept Brahma Sutra as per existing interpretations or can make an new one.
