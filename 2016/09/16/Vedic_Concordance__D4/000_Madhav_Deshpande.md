I found a digital version of Vedic Concordance that uses the Macind font. I am wondering how I can get a Unicode version. Also someone had prepared a Stardict version of Vedic concordance ([bloomfield-vedic-sa.tar.gz](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvvasuki%2Fstardict-sanskrit%2Fraw%2Fmaster%2Fsa-head%2Ftars%2Fbloomfield-vedic-sa.tar.gz&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGtVtaJJBhjebEFF6G4zIJY_9yCYA)), listed in some old messages, but I am not able to download one. Any help?
