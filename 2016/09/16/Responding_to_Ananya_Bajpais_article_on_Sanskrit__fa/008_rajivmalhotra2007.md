Ananya Vajpeyi writes(in *Righteous Republic,* 2012, Harvard Uni Press. P. 211) that:



*“the thread that keeps Ambedkar tied to India,even as he wants to **smash India into smithereens** and reconstruct it from the ground up,is his abiding commitment to solving the mystery of duhkha,the suffering of the people – not just his people,the Untouchables, but all people, the people of India”.*



This thinking comes from Pollock, and it is the single most potent aspect of Pollock that Ananya Vajpeyi picks up into her own scholarly life mission. TBFS explores this in detail.

Excerpt from TBFS, page 316-17:



*BEGIN EXCERPT:*



This goal \[of Pollock\] of intervening in Indian society is worth stating here. He writes:

  

"… you transcend inequality by mastering and overmastering those discourses through study and critique. You cannot simply go around a tradition to overcome it, if that is what you wish to do; you must go through it. *You only transform a dominant culture by outsmarting it*. That, I believe, is precisely what some of India’s most disruptive thinkers, such as Dr Ambedkar, sought to do, though *they were not as successful as they might have been had they had access to all the tools of a critical philology necessary to the task.*"\[3\]



After recovering selective memories and (re)constructing narratives using political philology (his first goal), he supplies the methods of liberation philology for achieving social and political change (his second goal). He sometimes puts a Buddhist gloss on his goals to rationalize and justify what he is doing. He says he sees dukkha (sorrow) abounding in Indian society, for which he has found an overarching cause (samudaya). He discusses the question that was asked of the Buddha: How do we overcome this overarching cause of dukkha? To which the Buddha responds by teaching his famous eightfold path. This teaching applies to *individual* dukkha for which there is an *individual* cause.

  

However, Pollock is interested in India’s social/collective dukkha which he identifies as poverty, misery and the oppression of women, shudras and Muslims. Then, he identifies the social samudaya (cause): the hierarchical and othering structures of Sanskrit and Sanskrit-based traditions such as Hinduism. The solution he offers is political philology, that is, the political deconstruction of the language, texts and culture using analytical tools developed in the West.

  

There are two major target audiences for his strategy: academic and mainstream. The academic strategy is to deploy his particular philological lens to build up his own academic cadre, whose function is to spread his theories. The mainstreaming strategy enables him to win over non-academicians to his views. It is a successful strategy, as witnessed by the support he has garnered from such figures as Narayana Murthy and the top officials at Sringeri Peetham, as well as the Government of India.



*END EXCERPT*

  

 I have suggested including Pollock's students in our rejoinders. Vajpeyi and Arsha Sattar are the most serious sepoys of Pollock based in India.

-   · Sattar is an Indian Muslim who did her PhD on the Ramayana
    from UChicago under Doniger and Pollock. She frequently introduces
    him at events in India. Her Ramayana ought to be included in the
    Ramayana topic being done by some of the SI2 scholars. -   · Vajpeyi's focus on the other hand is on the oppressiveness
    caused by Sanskrit when it gets controlled by Hindus - hence the
    liberation being sought by attacking BJP, etc. and putting Sanskrit
    interpretation in the hands of Dalits and Muslims.
