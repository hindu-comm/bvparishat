Dear Ananya

  

On a first look, I would have safely ignored your article (<http://wpj.dukejournals.org/content/33/3/45.full>)as just another leftist rant, but since you mentioned JNU and its Sanskrit center, I had to jot down some quick remarks as response. Here are they (somebody should forward it to the Indology group because I am not a member there)

  

First impression - your article appears to be an anti-BJP and pro-Pollock pamphlet and not a scholarly piece at all. A typical Hindu-phobic pro-left rhetoric that's all one can say about your article!

  

Our building is 'swastika' shaped in the good sense that it is known in the whole of India. Swastika does not become a stigma for India just because some German fanatic misrepresents it. Most other buildings in JNU follow some western architecture. In your opinion should that be preferable to using any native designs for architecture on Indian campuses?

  

Later in your article, you have faintly suggested Sanskrit center as casteist, communal etc. But you do not know that we have helped in developing the first English-Urdu Machine Translation for Microsoft Bing Translator in the Sanskrit center of JNU. We are leading Indian government's corpora development initiative for Indian languages on a server based platform.Please check it out at at [www.bing.com/translator](http://www.bing.com/translator) and <http://sanskrit.jnu.ac.in> for details. This in my view is the meaning and power of Indian swastika and Sanskrit - taking along everyone. Sadly, the brand of scholarship you represent does want to understand this.

  

Sanskrit studies in India have nothing to do with elitism of any kind whatsoever. You are most welcome to visit our center in JNU to witness it.

  

The claim that Sanskrit has re-entered the popular imagination in in last 3 years or so is a fiction and smacks of a certain kind of argument that scholars like you take against any well meaning government. Do you have any data to support this argument?

  

Sanskrit does not represent high caste or culture at all. Please collect data from the 17 universities and 150 departments of Sanskrit and revise your article accordingly.

  

Sanskrit has done a great job in uniting India. You portray a completely altered image of it for reasons best known to you.

  

Please read the arguments given by our national leaders who supported Sanskrit in place of Hindi as the national official language.

  

Sanskrit does not have 'Brahmin domination'. Dr Ambedkar was a strong votary of Sanskrit and not one as you have projected him to be.

  

Though i admire scholars like Prof Pollock for their work on Sanskrit based Indology, but I seriously doubt the capacity of such scholars to read and interpret historical culture texts of Sanskrit. However, you have devoted at least three paragraphs in praising Prof Pollock. And I wonder if this was one of the objectives of your article.

  

By 'naturalizing' Sanskrit words in English, these words do not 'become' English words. They maintain their identity, as we maintain our identity in a foreign land. If the objective is to mis-appropriate these, then you may be simply day-dreaming.

  

And again, the rest of the article is simply anti-BJP masala and nothing else. If any government wants to promote Indian symbols and things (every other country in the world does it), then you have a problem. I am sure concepts like guru or yoga or ayurveda or kali-puja will be promoted even by the leftists if they ever come to power in India.

  

Please do not link Sanskrit to a fictitious 'cultural battle field'.
Let us say no to paid-scholarship and work towards building a genuine rational logical scholarship which benefits us and also the rest of the world.

  

  

Thank you
