Rajiv,

That is the standard politicking. Any person or group would resort to division techniques

in order to keep ruling. I admire you that you blew the whistle when most were sleeping.

India awakened would be a much larger force that the world has ever seen. Thank you

for helping to engineer it through your instinct and methods. I am amazed at Pollock's

hypocrisy and disrespect to the culture that he wants to study! While these parasitic

invasions would continue, the best defens(c)e is to build up the native scholarship and

communication in the modern day methods.

Best regards,

BM
