Dear Bijoy Mishra,  
  

*Apropos* your displeasure with Rajiv Malhotra using the word *sepoy*, and your choice to refrain from labelling, especially to the accompaniment of the citation from *Vālmīki* *Rāmāyaṇa*.  
  

The text you have cited is erroneous, and the sense/implication you have drawn from it is indeed eggregious. I guess you have missed the context. Let me supply the same, and clarify the meaning/intention.  
  

When Hanūmat meets Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa for the first time, Rāma is already impressed by Hanūmat's speech. Listing the excellences of his eloquence, Rāma tells Lakṣmaṇa:  
  

"... Even the heart of an enemy with a raised sword, would be pleased by the oration of Hanūmat ...".  
(The same is put, for an intenser effect, as a rhetorical question "The heart of which enemy ... would not be propitiated...?).  
  

There is no question whatsoever of converting another into a different opinion striking fear with a raised scimitar here.  
  

As to the text itself,  

the 4th and 5th words are  

***udyata***-***aseḥ***  

(not ***udyat***-***ase**)*.  
  

Regards  

KSKannan
