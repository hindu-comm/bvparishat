Namaste



Thanks Rajiv ji .



I hope the clarification provided by you in ‘Clarifying the scope and definition’ of the term ‘Sepoy’ which covers the following features will be summarily and appropriately applied by debating scholars to the case analysis using supporting evidence, more so in Battle: Sanskrit and Swadesi Indology . Please reconfirm if I am missing any shade of the ‘Sepoy’ Word meaning in the summary below ? in your discourse to form a checklist ? This would help to firm up the word-meaning-scope specificity.



Today’s ‘Sepoy’, in the context of this discourse, for identifying and grading and hand picking ‘ more serious- Sepoys’ (where you have started with Professor Sheldon Pollock) is one who is:. 



- serving the American Empire (just as the earlier one served the British Empire) where the method of service is largely intellectual.

- The purpose of being a 'sepoy' is seeking 'command prestige among fellow Indians' using the given superior symbols, decorations and limelight; using the training provided; accepting the compensation ; and allowed to be directed by their respective foreign nexus.

- Sepoy carries dual identities and cultures as this makes it easier to perform their role.

- Sepoys feel they are doing good to their fellow Indians because they are civilizing them by uprooting/reforming primitive ways from their own heritage.

- Sepoys deployed help govern indirectly.

- Foreign Money and agenda was used in creating a cadre of 'Sepoys'.

- The word 'Sepoy' is troubling for it is pointer to the 'awareness of conscious sell out'.



And getting back to my start up post, Do we have a appropriate Samskruth Word to cover all this ? OR do We look at ‘ linguistically – philologically – using literration’ appropriate the word ‘Sepoy’ in to ‘Samskruth Vocabulary fold’ by wrapping it with some ‘ Paniniya – pratyaya –Decoration and Ornamentation’ ?
