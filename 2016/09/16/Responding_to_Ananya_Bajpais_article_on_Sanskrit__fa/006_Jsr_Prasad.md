Namste All,  
  
Wonderful responses by Prof. Paturi, Prof. S. Ramaratnam besides the one by Prof. Girish. Thanks to them, for the motivation. My following response pertains to some specific arguments by her, though coming late:  
  

Dear Ananya,

If Nazis stigmatized the meaning of Swastika, that doesn't have any influence of its actual sense in Vedic context. Yoga is being patented as Christian Yoga in Amerikas. Does it mean two kinds of Yoga was described by Patanjali? So, Swastika shaped building of JNU, has nothing to do with the positive and negative meanings created by 'scholars' like you! False imagination can never become a reality!!

I failed to understand, how Sanskrit become an instrument during the anti-colonial resistance. It is the patriotism that drove from behind, and of course many Sanskrit scholars wrote, sang poems, play lets to motivate the masses. Though unknowingly, you pronounced correctly – 'post colonial state largely ignored Sanskrit.' True Madam, because, the BJP collision come to majority after 6 decades of independence.

No argument is offered when you said, Modi Government is legitimizing caste and Sanskrit. Sri Modi himself is not from a forward caste, nor he's a Sanskrit scholar like Babu Rajendra Prasad/Vajpayee. If Sanskrit thought to be taught to engineering students (IIT's), that is based on the scientific material the language bequethed. You so-called leftists, show aversion to point to all such indigenous concepts of science in Sanskrit. Because, you might be afraid, that won't fetch any political gain or an employment at leftist 'aḍḍā' like CSDS. There is no ghost of caste or Sanskrit that try to enter the system, rather it is the leftist wing that should leave Indian society hung up here for many decades, like Bhetala.

Remove your western lens and see how women rights have been protected, the woman welfare, respect towards women etc. Kautilya (3^(rd) B.C.) is a perfect example on these issues. Needless to say the brahmavadinis, other women sages, in Vedic scriptures. Then only one can argue, something like Hindu society was highly patriarchal. We're indebted to you as you reveled that all untouchables are known as 'Dalits' today.

As much as the records go, Dr. Ambedkar did not oppose Sanskrit. He, unequivocally, wanted Sanskrit to become a national language during the constitution days. He adopted Buddhism, as he was quite upset with fundamentals of religions other than Hinduism. Is Buddhism not a modified Hinduism?

Your reference to Pandit Pollock and his textual interpretations establishes that śabdapramāṇa is completely rejected. Here, we traditionalist don't ascribe the idea of 'seeing is believing.' We'll take up on your revered Guru, later at an appropriate context.

In JNU's instance, entire nation has moved, not only your dear dveṣapātras, the 'rightists.' Remember, like there are 'No-Good-Terrorists,' there are 'No-Good-Anti-Nationals.'

It is easy to construct that, when you say, 'significant Islamic aspects of Indian history&culture,' are be-littled, you are in the foot steps of senior leftists like Romilla Thapar etc. Sanskrit academies, or Sanskrit institutions do not receive the huge funding received by Urdu academies or Universities. Not a single Hindu pilgrim is supported by Govt. for his visit to places like Kashi or Tirupati.

I wonder, being a PhD in Sanskrit, how come you are unaware of the distinction between a 'teacher' and a 'Guru.' We use to have Gurus in Gurukulams, unlike the teachers in convents. We'd be living in a fool's paradise, if we did not realize the health potential of Yoga, whose concepts have been thoroughly appropriated with several names in several countries.

You people are suffocated due to the bubbling patriotism these days. Pseudo and paid scholarship, Hypocrisy cannot help one to oppress the facts. One who do not know the true essence of Vedanta, would only label something as 'Brahmanical.' Your band of people better read the books on caste system authored by Karapatri Swami, Mahamandaleswara of Kanakhal. But, sorry, they are written in Sanskrit..

  
Thank you,  
Prasad
