"Reading Ananya Vajpeyi's article, her two books and other newspaper articles and so on, it is clear to me that she is a part time 'scholar' (if she is one at all) and full time political propagandist. Let me get personal here -......"

  

mAnyavar,

  

I agree. and her purpose as a "political propagandist" is solved as I find some best brains of India discussing her here... she must have found herself in peace....

  

On constructive side of our tradition, however, I find myself in agreement withGrünendahl,who says,"... it would be futile to exhaust oneself in the tedious correction of factual errors and distortions, because the postcolonial charge gathers its momentum outside the sphere of prosaic factuality, preferably by means of subtle insinuation,"

  

It is necessary to focus, enrich and strengthen our own heritage and tradition, .... political, ideological and religious have attacks been there, and shall remain in future...

  

Regards

Sati Shankar
