Dear Bijoyji,  
  

The word "sepoy", was originally used by the colonial masters to mean a native soldier, who was in their payroll and whom they could order to fight for them. One can, of course, try to find out if Pollock could have exerted any kind of pressure, directly or indirectly, on his follower Ananya to raise voice on his behalf, so that it would appear that his (Pollock's) actions are supported from India. . In that sense the word "sepoy" may properly fit in, though the word may not appear to be a polished one. May be, we can think of a more polished word, in such a case, where a representative feels obliged to do certain thing on behalf of the represented.  
  

Regards,
