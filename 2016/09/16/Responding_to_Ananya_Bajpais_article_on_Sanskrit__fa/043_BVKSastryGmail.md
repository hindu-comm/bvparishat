Namaste



1. Thanks for the clarification and clarifying your reason for pragmatic selection of the word ‘Sepoy’ in the discourse intended for the target group, to achieve the two specific impacts.

2. Thanks for clarifying that the issue was not about the ‘word/ Sanskrit equivalent’ but mainly based on the ‘market’- ‘ impact’. 



3. I hope that the posts that came earlier with a little bit of animosity and dissenting sensitivity in the main thread will now be understood with a greater clarity.



And for a greater part, by training and choice, the ‘Sanskrit traditionalist’ tends to hold the ‘word-meaning association’ in the fairly rigid frame of ‘lexicon- Grammar and philological derivation’, keeping the ‘pragmatic and market issues aside. Your clarification has helped in clearing the air.
