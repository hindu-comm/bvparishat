I fully agree with Prof Girish Nath Jha's views. The British left India some 70 years back. They have forgotten India. But our Indian friends are still clinging to that colonial mentality. For them anything Indian is degrading. For these half baked scholars. it is fashionable to call themselves as communists or so called rationalists. If you call yourself a Hindu it is communal. On the other hand if you call yourself as a communist or an atheist or a person belonging to any other religion it is secular and fine with them. BJP is a political party. People voted the party to power and they are ruling. Why should you associate
Sanskrit with it? Even during Congress rule many Sanskrit Universities were established. Sanskrit belongs to the people and not to any particular party.  

With a colonial mind and a superiority complex, Sheldon as well as a number of his predecessors adopt a divide and rule policy. They divide texts into Brahminical, Buddhist, Jaina and so on. We never had such a division in our tradition. We have vaidika and avaidika darsanas,we have astika and nastika darsanas. We never had a system called Brahminical. Are Rama and Krishna brahmins? Is Valmiki a Brahmin? Even Vyaasa was born to a fisherwoman. There were sages from from all castes. With a sinister motive, the western scholars call some texts as Brahminical. Unfortunately our Indians blindly follow them and fall a prey to their evil designs because it is fashionable for them to ape the westerners ! Whenever I got a chance, I opposed the use of the term brahminical employed by the so called scholars. In the recently held World Sanskrit Conference also I raised this objection in two sessions. One grudgingly admitted his fault and the other had no answer and so he simply brushed it aside and passed on to the next question. All Indian scholars, if they have at least a little bit of patriotism should vehemently oppose the term brahminical with respect to ancient texts and put an end to the divisive policy of the western scholars. I have put these points across with evidences in my paper for the Delhi Conference to be held in February and I hope I will get a chance to air my views and expose the limitations of the 'pro-Pollockists.'
