Dear Bijoy Misra,  
  
My only concern was your understanding of the *Ramayana* text : in case you thought there was something in the context you cited bore any kinship to any "conversion at the point of the sword".  
  

What the text says, quite to the contrary, is that even the heart of an enemy who, ready with an uplifted sword, is about to strike, would be *so touched and moved*, that he would throw his sword away, and hug dear Hanumat - so palatable and delectable his speech is.  
  
Foes turn into friends when they notice benignance of heart reflected in benevolence of eloquence.  
  

Nothing could be more abhorrent to the sage-author, then, should his above words, aptly cited by you, be construed as kindred to conversion at the point of the bayonet - is all that I wanted to say.  
  

Please ensure that your interpretation does justice to the original author.  
  

The original author is, for Pollock, after all dead. He says, in his three-tier philology thesis, that a new interpretation by a moderner is as valid as that of the original. The impunity he brazenly exhibits in respect of his wild interpretations of ancient Sanskrit texts is, honestly speaking, beneath contempt.  
  

Let us only ensure that our artistic freedom does no violence to the sweet and suave spirit of the sayings of the sages such as Valmiki.  
  

Hope you do not mistake me.  

  

Regards,  

KSKannan
