Dear Shri Prasad ji,  
  
it is good we respond to an episode like this. But even better is to go deeper than individual/isolated episodes, and connect the dots to figure out the broader framework.  
  

One aspect is to track the lineages/paramparas being formed by the other side. Often their leader is fighting from behind using others to expand upon his toxic tenets. This approach is well disguised. The different components of their work get published by different members of their team, making it more challenging for us to figure out what is going on. Meanwhile, their leader goes on doing sama-dana to raise funding and prestige for his school of thought, while his team does the bheda-danda aspects. But you must connect all this to know the big picture.
