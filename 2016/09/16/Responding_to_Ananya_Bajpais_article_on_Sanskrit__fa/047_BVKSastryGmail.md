Namaste



**Prior note**: You have touched on a vital point, which it would be difficult to explain totally as a short response within the frame of this side note. Yet the issue cannot be answered in simplistic, populist or bombastic way by quoting from texts without explanation. Therefore I strive here to find a mid way to balance the response, brining in just enough technicality and leave the rest for a separate discussion.



This is an area on which I have put my three decades of research studies to hypothesize and bring out the Panini-Patanjali-Yaska way of studying Samskrutham. Traditionally it is called ‘Vedanga Vyakarana Paddhati’; Patanjali Calls it ‘Vak-Yoga’; and I am using the word ‘Yoga-Samskrutham :Yoga way of Studying Samskrutham’ . This is an effort for restoration of a traditional position critical for Paninian language studies. For many, this would appear like the story of a small boy \< who publicly announced that the emperor (or the queen ?!)
out in public had no clothes, as the ‘clothe’ could be seen only by the ‘ meritorious’ ones \> ; and I may end up getting a comment as one of those desiring to push ‘ India’ to dark ages’ ?!



Sorry if a little unintended roughness comes in the language of this response. The pointed question raised by you has many ‘ deep ills and poison pills’.





***Now, for the response***,



1. On \< I humbly disagree with you last para because **Sanskrit has also enriched itself with loan words**. \> 



**BVK Sastry(on 1)**: **Summary of response** : Yes, Sanskrit has been enriched by loan words; But loan word have NEVER demanded or caused any CHANGE IN THE STANDARD of SANSKRITIZATION or Slackening of Grammar Process Rigor. Therefore the same grammar of pre-Christian era continues to hold till date; allowing \< Sanskrit Bhashaa –segment to be enriched> and \< Guard the Sanskrit- Chandas –segment from any corruption>. The post 1700 writers make a flagrant, willful violation of this standard of tradition in several modes : mainly by using incompatible theological paradigm of Abrahamic traditions to deconstruct and distort the Spiritual Vedanga –Yogaanga approach to study Samskrutham. It is an error of ‘Sepoys’ ! When ‘Colonial’ master
commands and pays through ‘Boden fund’ the ‘sepoys’ to eat Pizza with straws and peanuts with fork, the sepoys find a way to implement the order; and not question the wisdom. Be it Max Muller or one that come in that tutelage. The King /Queen can never be wrong. Do the natives have the courage to stand up on their feet to fight the ‘ lagaan’ game?



** Now for the detail**:



Yes, \<Sanskrit, in its ‘Bhashaa’ part-> has enriched itself with words coming in for ‘Sanskritization’ from all languages at all periods.




The language standards and processes covered in Ashtadhyayi by Panini provides two classes of words. One class is called ‘Chandas’ ( Vedic, Accented). The other is ‘Bhashaa’ ( Classical Sanskrit, literary , technical Sanskrit). In Paninian tradition, the Vedanga unified approach, both these belong to ONE UNIFIED LANGUAGE STANDARD OF YOGA . There are strict criterion for a given word to belong to or fall out of this watertight classification.



The addition of words to ‘Chandas’ class takes place by ‘ Yogi’s visioning of Vedas’. The last known such addition to ‘Vedic lore vocabulary ’ in our times was authenticated by Kavya Kantha Vasihsta Ganapati Muni, also known as Kapali Shastri; the person who ‘brought to limelight Sage Ramana Maharshi and Sri Daivarata’. 



The addition of words to ‘Bhashaa’ class takes place continuously by ‘ Poets, Users of all kinds ’ regulary. Each such word needs to be compliant with the Paninian rules and processes \< 1-4-14- Supting antam padam ; 2-1-1 : Samarthah pada-vidhih ; 1-2-45: Arthavat -adhatuh -apratyayah – Praatipadikah ; 1-2-46: Krit- Taddhita - Samaasascha. \> . When any one refers to \< enrichment of Sanskrit Vocabulary and social usage standards>, it is the ‘Bhashaa –segment> and NOT \<Chandas-segment>.



 The Grammarian has NEVER restricted any new word coming to \<Sanskrit –Bhashaa segment \>. The Grammarian accepts the USER GIVEN WORD (Say X) – with USER GIVEN ASSOCIATED ANY NUMBER OF INPUTS ( X- 1 to X-n) OF meaning, gender, pronunciation, accent, which are needed for ‘SANSKRITIZATION’ Under ‘BHASHAA’ rules and Standards. The entry gate is the rule \< 1-2-53 :tadashihsyam samjnaa pramanatvaat \>. The Grammarian only plays the role of ‘ ensuring issuance of a VISA document for Travel or Legal Migration’ for a ‘ Loan word, desiring to under go the Naturalization Process called SANSKRITIZATION’.

A ‘ contemporary word’ with limited usage- need and privilege’ like a temporary traveler gets a \< wrap around \> . Examples are aplenty in Samskrutha Bharati Conversation Classes for ‘Sanskritizing –Simple modalities’. Spoken Sanskrit in families, Villages is an illustration here. It is very good to promote Sanskrit Awareness and take away the Sanskrit-phobia; but it is not enough to work with high end literature or documents of Samskrutham. A tourist traveler in USA cannot work and get paid legally for , there is ‘no-Status’. ( =Adhikaar –Yogayataa) .Ability (saamrthya ) is not the issue.



  If such a word needs a continued stay and be a part of ‘Sanskrit –Bhashaa Vocabulary’, like an upgrade of an temporary immigrant to ‘Resident Status’, there are grammar rules to be complied with. The ‘word’ should be able to willingly undergo processes to ‘ get unified with the affixes ( Pratyaya samskara) and respect the processes ( prakriyasa of Kaaraka –Vibhakti) appropriately under the rule ( 1-4-14). That is a discipline requirement by language standards for a stabilized continuous, confusion-free, usage. There are a plenty of such words which have been used in Sanskrit literature over centuries and have become a part of ‘Sanskrit Vocabulary’. Even Bible Sanskrit Translation can not and did not violate this rule. One such example – the word ‘Kaashmira –phala’ for Apple used in ritual offerings. Some day the words ‘Pizza, Cake’ may also be effectively find a Sanskritized standard. ; Sanskrit Dictionaries have listed them. Such inclusions and illustrations can be seen in several Sanskrit dictionaries including ‘ Monier Williams’ and many modern online Sanskrit dictionaries.



 I am aware that many who cannot take the rigor of Samskrutham have provided shortcuts and escape routes for ‘New Word Sanskritization’ . As Sanskrit teachers in school, for meeting temporary needs, we have done it. Go to any Sanskrit conversation Course for seven days and you will find learners finding such short cuts. These do not reset or upset the Standard rule base of Paninian standards. 



 **What then is the missing point** ? While every ‘ loan’ word that came in to \<Sanskrit- Bhashaa>, starting like an ‘ immigrant’ and progressing to the status of a legal residents and citizens in a nation, the incoming words DID NOT CHANGE THE GRAMMAR PROCESS OF SANSKRITIZATION. The rule base given by Panini has remained stable and robust as a System. The post colonial linguists and their followers miss this point on ‘Robustness of SANSKRITIZATION PROCESS’ which inducts the given loan word in to the ‘Class –Culture-Companionship of Sanskrit –Bhashaa Vocabulary with all privileges by making them pass through a rigid rule-compliance process; and if a word does not stand this test, it is mercilessly thrown out as ‘ unfit, unSanskritized – Apaniniya -apashabda’ by the learned (Shishtas). Sorry that Samskrutham does not work by the rule of
lowering standards for mass convenience. Gold is rare in nature; yet when it occurs, it is always pure. The rigor of Samskruth Class Acceptance for words also isolates bhashaa words from the exclusively guarded class of \<Sanskrit- Chandas Vocabulary and Process> which is integral to the system.



 **What is so sacrosanct in this stand of Purist Samskruth linguists ? Why is it so critical** ? Several key issues vital to tradition and history of Sanatana Dharma. 

**Key issue**: Destroy this Samskruth Standards rigidity; and allow India to lose its ‘Sacred Thread ( Brahma Sutra / Yajnopavitam) of linguistic continuity for its own Spiritual heritage. The additional points to note here are : 

(i) Traditional Schools do not accept Paninian grammar as a
descriptive or prescriptive or collage of several grammars of many languages and documents of historical periods. The entire text of Paninian grammar is based on a specific perception provided by Vedas and Yoga traditions answering What Language is ? The origin, nature, and function of Language ? . The totality of six disciplines called Vedanga cover this question, primarily from the Spiritual aspect (Yajna - Yoga). The two fold classification of ‘**Apaurusheya**’ ( Language Visioned as it is in Nature) and **Paurusheya** ( Language as a human process outcome for True and Total Articulation of Thought = Bhaava –Abhivyakti) are used to draw the rules of GRAMMAR PROCESSING.
The rules that helps to understand and get benefit from ‘Apaurusheya’ document is called the Rules of ‘Chandas’. The rules that helps to make True and Total Articulation –Expression of Thought and make Communication benefit is called ‘ Bhashaa’ document. And is
processed under Rules of ‘ Bhashaa’.

The work ‘Ashtaadhyayi’ provides a single document, a compact code unifying these two Vedic perceptions and prescriptions about Language. The key is in Bhagavad-Gita (17-15) which guides on practice of ‘Tapas of Vak’. And the same is further compacted in Patanjali yoga sutra 2-1 and 4-1. The elaboration of this Yoga of Language (Swadhyaya Yoga) , the language –Tool to understand Vedas is Patanajlai’s commentary on Panini.



** **

2. On \< Also, could one think of Panini as descriptive (of bhasha at his time) and not prescriptive forever? \>.



**BVK Sastry (on 2) **: 



** Summary of response** : No. This boxed modeling of understanding Panini is based on errors in understanding ‘Samskrutham :Language Pedagogy and Model’. 

When Panini is NOT writing a grammar of a social language, his work cannot be classified as ‘ prescriptive or descriptive’ using the hidden hypothesis that ‘Samskrutham, like all Human Languages, more so like Latin, Greek, Aramaic, Hebrew Or even English, which have a compulsive need to be associated with a descriptive or prescriptive grammar. These languages keep varying from locale to locale, across spoken communities and historical migration periods ! The grammar and lexicon approach in a period specific way becomes critical for these languages. And so is the need for update.

This is the compulsion of a theological language model derived under the inspiration of Biblical reference - Tower of Babel ( <https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+11:1-9> ) , the mother seed of IE- linguistics . and PIE theory.



** Now for detail** : The root error is ‘Thinking that Panini was a descriptive grammar writer of a language (bhashaa) at his time; and therefore ‘ not prescriptive for ever’. The unarticulated, hypothesis behind this is analyzed in traditional schools as a part of ‘ Nature and Function of Language, as Thought Articulation, Naming an entity ( Naama-Roopa Vyavahara, Shabdaabhidhanam) and embedded in to the continuing Hindu tradition of ‘ Naama-Karana Samskara’ ( Child naming). No child comes to this earth with a name.
The name has to be natural, spiritual, social and Yoga-Compliant.



 Many of colonial linguists theory on ‘ Language / Sanskrit language is getting a new look from the Scientists, neurosurgeons, Advanced researchers in the area of Consciousness, Quantum origin of life and the like. The Scientists are slowly appreciating the ‘ limitations of classical indologists and linguists presentation of language theories; and converging to study the wisdom of language classification as ‘ Apaurusheya –Paurusheya’ :: Language of Nature (Chandas) and Language of Human Society resonating to the Truth Standards of Nature and seeking Spirituality (Bhashaa). The rest of the historical local languages are placed in the basket of Prakrut, Desi and Apabhramsha. Samskrutham Language resources have no parallel to the theological linguistic theory like this ! The word ‘Deva –Bhashaa’ does not map to the story of Tower of Babel’ .



The Tower of Babel text reads as follows: : Now the whole world had one language and a common speech. As people moved eastward,\[a\] they found a plain in Shinar\[b\] and settled there. They said to each other, “Come, let’s make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar. Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth.”

But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower the people were building. The Lord said, “If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.” So the Lord scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city. That is why it was called Babel\[c\]—**because there the Lord confused the language of the whole world. From there the Lord scattered them over the face of the whole earth**. 





Here is a link of one recent international conference that took place
at Bangalore which touched upon this issue: Fourth International Conference 'Science and Scientist - 2016' : August 26 — 27, 2016, Bangalore University

The entire issue is a very complex intertwined one with a deep historical legacy. Many ‘Sanskrit Academicians’ are not comfortable to acknowledge or address, work as a part of multi-discipline team. And much less fund such serious study, unless it goes for some personal aggrandizement. Some are comfortable to be safe by making ‘packaged pointers with quotes from source works’. The deserted key issue is ‘Defining Samskrutham’, restoring the Samskruth tradition of teaching it
as a part of ‘Vedanga league of six disciplines’ needing ‘Yoga technical pedagogy’. This is a critical strategic issue for any
Battle: Sanskrit to explore ‘ Sacred Spiritual (Mantra) Linguistics of Samskrutham’.



The proposal to revisit and surface the key premise of tradition creates chills and triggers , several dimensions of phobias in
special interest groups holding three primary apple carts. The three primary apple cart-owners are :



(i) Post colonial Academicians who have held ‘Sanskrit’ to be the
historical social, literary language of Vedas. Isolating ‘Chandas and Bhashaa’ as unified tradition of Samskrutham used in Ashtadhyayi.



(ii) Modern Schools who hold ‘Sanskrit’ as the language of the oppressors and preventive of Modern India’s economic progress. Why then call Sanskrit as a part of 8^(th) schedule –National language of India ? What will be the mother root of ‘Hindi as Rashtra Bhashaa’ ? And enrich it with English, French, German, or Latin vocabulary ?



(iii) Computational Sanskrit Linguists, who want to push the ‘Sanskrit-Bhashaa part Paninian language rules to be ‘ recoded as a patented - program in English like language’ and deported it to the barrack of digital devices running OS and Applications running from remote Servers to provide ‘Automated Indian Language Translation Services’ ? Why then World IT teams are exploring Sanskrit Computational linguistics ? as a part of seeking Non-roman script voice solutions for Indian market , making Digital India dream to generate a ‘ IT service providing colony’ ? 





**The answer rests in relearning what Panini had in mind in designing the rule book called ‘Ashtadhyayi’ for Samskrutham, where in a fusion of Spiritual and Social dimension of Language is provided without a loophole for ‘any ‘Lord’ to confuse the user’**.
