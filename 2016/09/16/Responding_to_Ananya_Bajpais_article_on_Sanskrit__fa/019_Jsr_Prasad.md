Dear Sri Rajiv ji,

I appreciate adding more views to the context. I feel, responding to this kind of episodes would help us in realizing the full picture, as you said rightly. Indeed, when education/academia is contaminated with vested interests, and political intervention, it's the dharma of the lovers of this beautiful language and culture to confront, at various levels, from several platforms.

It seems, rather these indologists have thoroughly studied Machiavelli (1498 AD), than Kautilya, whose book was not based on Dharma. It is heartening to know that one of the few great exponents of shaastra, Sri Satavadhani Ganesh ji would join the SI-II.

Regards,  
Prasad
