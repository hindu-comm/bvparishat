Thanks BVK ji.

Sepoy today is the Indian serving the American Empire just as the earlier one served the British Empire.

But today's sepoy is a mutation of the earlier one, as the method of service today is largely intellectual. While the Brits used Indians in lowly posts only, the American system is more sophisticated, and this requires the colonized to serve in higher level capacities.

What is common between the Brit and American varieties of sepoys is that:

1\) both are set up to command prestige among fellow Indians; for this they have been given superior symbols, decorations and limelight;

2\) both are trained, compensated and directed by their respective foreign nexus;

3\) both have dual identities and cultures as this makes it easier to perform their role;

4\) both types feel they are doing good to their fellow Indians because they are civilizing them by uprooting/reforming primitive ways from their own heritage.

The term sepoy has roots from Mughal times, and it evolved in the Brit era and now further in the American era.

American history has a well-known phenomenon called the "frontier", an era in which "others" like Blacks and Native Americans were "domesticated". These methods were later exported by the Brits to be used in Ireland, followed by India. Even many centuries earlier than this, the Romans deployed local men from the conquered nations to help them govern indirectly. This system later turned into Roman Church appointed bishops with sweeping authority.

In the case of India, the notion of zamindar had similarities. Indian post colonialist scholars (who are largely staunch leftists) did a great job explaining this phenomenon, including branding certain India Leaders
as zamindars.

But in the process of their post-colonial studies, Ford Foundation and others appropriated them with money and stature, and hence turned them into sepoys. This is why the term is so troubling for them - as it makes them conscious of their own sell out.

My book "Breaking India" explains these things in more details.
