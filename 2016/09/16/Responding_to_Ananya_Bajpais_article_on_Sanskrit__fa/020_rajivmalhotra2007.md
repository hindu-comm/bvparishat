Thank you, Prof Jha. Below is my summary analysis of Pollock's thesis and how he locates Ambedkar and his own movement:  
  
Pollock develops a history of social abuse in India, and the solutions developed at various stages, leading up to the present time with his latest solution.  
  

The first breakthrough came with the Buddha, he says, arguing that it was a successful revolt against the Vedic Brahmins. (TBFS gives a detailed summary of his thesis on how this happened.) Buddha had examined the nature of *individual* dukkha. He diagnosed the cause (samudaya) at the individual level; and he prescribed the solution as the eightfold path, again at the individual level.

  

But Pollock is not interested in spirituality of any kind whatsoever. He wants to bring social revolution.

  

Therefore, says Pollock, Ambedkar arrives at the scene to examine the collective/social dukkha. His diagnosis is that it is caused by Hinduism, and hence his cure is the Dalit movement. This may be seen as the second revolution in liberating Indians from their Vedic heritage, as per Pollock’s history of social liberations in India.

  

However, Pollock explains, Ambedkar could not finish his job properly because he did not have the tools of Western philology available to him. Pollock sees himself and his movement as the third phase, in which Ambedkar’s dream would get fulfilled. This is why Pollock invests so much on his own patent thesis of political philology.

  

To sum up Pollock on his contribution as the successor to Ambedkar:

-   · India’s social/collective dukkha is poverty, misery and the
    oppression of women, shudras and Muslims. -   · The samudaya (cause) he identifies as the hierarchical and
    oppressive structures of Sanskrit and Sanskrit-based traditions. -   · The solution he offers is political philology, that is, the
    political deconstruction of the language, texts and culture using
    analytical tools developed in the West. -   · This will lead to what he calls “liberation philology”.

His students are taught this scheme very thoroughly. They are inspired to build careers to take it forward as their own work.

  

But we are outsiders to his school of thought and its secrets. So we must work very hard to decipher his codified, heavy jargon. It is not meant to be understood properly by people like us. This is an intentional road block he has built in order to discourage someone from exposing him. It is not a matter of discovering one isolated statement where he lays bare his entire thinking. One has to read vast works very closely and connect the dots.  

  

After all, it is risky to talk this way about him, because he is so highly regarded not only among Western Indologists, but also by our own authorities – government awards, industrialists’ grants, and Sringeri peetham type of places (almost) giving him authority as their global academic ambassador.
