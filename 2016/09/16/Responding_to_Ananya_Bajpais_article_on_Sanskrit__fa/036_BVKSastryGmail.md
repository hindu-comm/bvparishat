Namaste



**What is this sub-thread post about**? (a) To get a clarity on the scope and meaning of the word ‘Sepoy’ (b) To get the suggested Samskruth Equivalent word for the word ‘Sepoy’. 



**Why a sub –Thread** ? This is an offshoot of the thread ‘ Responding to Ananya Bajpai’s article on Sanskrit’, in which context, the meaning of the word ‘Sepoy’ came for a discussion.

 Rajiv ji has used the word ‘(the most Serious) Sepoy’ as a ‘label’ in the post to identify and label two individuals, by their mindset and active writings. 

And some are sensitive to this word as an Intentionally used ‘label’ against the ‘Chosen Few ’
Or as a coverage for a licentious ‘ libel’ to demarcate ‘WE and Others’ on a line of ideology .



In this thread of responses,
the word ‘Sepoy’ is perceived in all these meanings and several shades of sensitivities ! 

- ‘ Sepoy ’ = Agent ( V N Jha ; JSRA Prasad) ;

- ‘ A word of Ornamentation’, ‘People who do various things to make living’ (Bijoy Misa)

- ‘Sepoy was originally used by the colonial masters to mean a native soldier, who was in their payroll and whom they could order to fight for them’ expressing the need to find a ‘ polished word’ for the communication – \<‘a representative feels obliged to do certain thing on behalf of the represented.’> . (Sunil KB)

**In this context, it would be imperative to understand or technically define the meaning of the word ‘Sepoy’, with a set of criterion to tag the multiple meanings along with a suggested Samskruth Equivalent. With this exercise, the current posts can be reread for a better assessment of the situation.**



**Requested Focus for response to this post** : What is the literal, lexical and technical meaning for this word ‘Sepoy’ – a Persian word
sepāhī (سپاهی) meaning "infantry soldier" in the Mughal Empire? What would be the suggested current Sanskrit word for ‘Sepoy’ ? 



(Note: **Let me just point in advance that I have a fairly good acquaintance with Sri Rajiv Malhotra’s writings, views and blogs and appreciative of the evidence based arguments he has developed. **

**Here it is a slightly different yet a fundamental word related issue, that is raised in the context of Samskruth Scholars group.** )



**Why I consider this as an important point to discuss here** ? This will help to grade who is an ‘Agent Sepoy’, a ‘Serious Sepoy’, and a ‘ Potential ( mole) Sepoy ’. 



 (1) When ‘Words’ are used as ‘Labels’, the ‘Word Meanings’
lose their ‘ Culture-Context, Content and Intent, Precision of Communication pointers’. This transforms the given word to become fuzzy in social usage defying any scholarly chance to firm up the ‘meaning sensitivity’ for the given word – literally, lexically or through technical philological argument build up. The shifts in meaning alters sensitivities in communication. ‘Sepoy’ has become one such word , needing clarification. 



 (2) ‘Words, like a river flowing, acquire new meanings, flavors, and also loose sensitivities over a period of time in social usage in different lands and contexts’. One is familiar on the changing meanings of the word ‘Gandhi’ in social usage in Indian context! The word ‘Sepoy’ , a post 17^(th) century word has undergone many shades of meaning. A perusal of the available meanings associated with the word ‘Sepoy’ in many sources point to the fuzziness and ‘Catch-All / Cover Any and All – Fuzzy nature of this word’. 



sepoy ; (formerly) an Indian soldier in the service of the British, a horseman, an infantry person, native of India in British military service," , "infantry soldier" in the Mughal Empire, cavalry troopers in the Ottoman Empire, a cavalry trooper as a 'sowar'- horse -man; one of many, such as peons, gentoos, mestees and topasses used for various categories of native soldiers without regular uniform or discipline, all native soldiers in the service of the European powers in India. debates on the themes and writings



**Probable complex Implications of invoking fuzzy meanings associated with the word ‘sepoy’ **: When one is labeled or labels another person as a ‘Sepoy’, or placed /Get placed in a block called ‘Sepoys’, there has to be evidence to establish and justify the labeling, if it is to be serious academic beyond ‘ fuzzy social talk’ and opinionating’.





Thanks in advance for all scholars for help in clearing this fuzzy word ‘Sepoy’, which is apparently being used like the popular American expression ‘ I love you’ for which the user or listener are not bound to attach the same meaning or purpose.
