BVK ji, once a concept like sepoy (as I use it) is clear, the actual term to be deployed is a *pragmatic* choice. This choice requires first knowing *who* is the target group we want to impact, and what *impact* we want.

The choice is often made by experimenting with various terms to see what works. It is not some formal decision. The "market" decides. In our traditions also, many terms got introduced by various proponents, and some of them went viral while others did not.

So what might be the Sanskrit term is not necessarily the term I use.

In the example of sepoys, the impact I wanted and have achieved is with the Anglicized indians who are enamored by these high and mighty personalities. The purpose is to bring down such "too big to criticize" Hinduphobic personalities.

Remember the story of the small boy who publicly announced that the emperor had no clothes. This impact is not about "correct" Sanskrit.
