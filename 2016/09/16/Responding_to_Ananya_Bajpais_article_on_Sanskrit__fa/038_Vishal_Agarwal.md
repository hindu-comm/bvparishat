Reading Ananya Vajpeyi's article, her two books and other newspaper articles and so on, it is clear to me that she is a part time 'scholar' (if she is one at all) and full time political propagandist. Let me get personal here - she is a victim of Love Jihad married to Basharat Peer, who is a self-professed supporter Islamic terrorism in Kashmir. Her posts and writings clearly reveal that she is suffering from several irrational fears, and therefore needs psychiatric help for ailments like persecution complex and the like. A quick google search will reveal that others like Arundhati Roy (of whom I am not a fan either) have been attacked by her viciously too in the past - all that email conversation was outed by someone.

  

Perhaps there is a simpler explanation for her hysterical behavior - that she is a rabid Hindu hater, an RNI (resident non Indian) who is hell bent upon projecting India as a violent nation with her constipated prose. A reasonable dialogue with a hate filled irrational person like Ananya Vajpeyi cannot yield much results. Nevertheless, rebuttals are needed for the sake of the record.

  

Sorry for this post - but having followed her considerably, this is the only conclusion that one can draw about her.

  

I am told by her co-students that she has often been asked not to defend Pollock (with friends like her, he certainly does not need enemies) and that she is not highly regarded in her peer group for her scholarship.

  

Let me leave it at that.
