Dear Scholars,  
  
I really thank all my colleagues - Prof. Girishnath Jha, Prof. Nagaraj Paturi, Prof. Prasad and others who contributed and shared their straightforward thoughts as reaction to the article by Dr. Ananya. Many questions are raised to show the value of her illogical arguments.  
  
Dr. Nityananda Mishra has taken her on Indology list by pointing some data driven facts against her baseless arguments. Instead of answering those questions, Dr. Ananya chose to respond by saying that it is not relevant to discuss about political situation in India. But she only claims in another mail that she and her so called colleagues are facing suffocating situation in India. No evidences. Yes, if right wings are enjoying the good status, what is the problem ? The same situation was prevailing for rightists during left lead govt. Never people said we are in suffocating state and never any demanded for a separate state for them. This is the difference we can see between there politically oriented scholars.  
  
Anyways we need to answer her by showing contradictions within her statements. We also need to show the data to discard her views.  
  
Since I was part of the committee which developed road map for Sanskrit development, i owe the responsibility to justify the Govt policy for Sanskrit. Never we had any agenda behind this report which is accepted by the Govt in toto and being implemented in phase manner. Here I should say it is not this Govt but the previous congress led Govt that appointed second Sanskrit commission to assess the situation of Sanskrit. Later based on the same commissions report, the committee headed by N Gopalaswamy former CEC has prepared action plan. Did this lady ever see the reports of first and second Sanskrit commissions ? Both the communions were appointed by congress led Govt and we must acknowledge that no Govts were against the progress of Sanskrit though they had different opinion. Congress led Govts always supported Sanskrit development. What is the problem if Current BJP Govt continues the same policy for Sanskrit with some more rigorous way ?  
  
I really don't understand the stand of these Ananyas who protest the act of an elected GOVT with some coloured lens when the same policy was adopted by previous Non-BJP Govt. if at all some additions are made it is not hidden. BJP is open for their stand as leftists do. However, Sanskrit language or Sanskrit fraternity had nothing to do with any GOVTs. We are interested in Sanskrit language.  
  
We the Sanskrit scholars need not be right activists to condemn these left oriented scholars. Yes, I am in the right side yet maintaining the distance from the extreme ideologies. I think most of Sanskrit scholars are of the same opinion.  
  
We shall react to such people without any activism. Let us expose their hollowness and preoccupation or prejudice in their arguments. In these we should be logical than analysing their personal matters and issues. (I am least interested in ananyas personal life or her personal likes or dislikes. Better if we keep those matters away from the list discussions). I hope all of you agree that we are against such perceptions, arguments and stands. We shall debate the issues raised by Ananyas (note plural) ; not the issues related to Ananya Vajpayee. (I should spell properly...otherwise she becomes very annoyed)  
  
{Note : And also while supporting views we can express our appreciations, but having personal invitations and mail exchanges related to outside programs becomes burden for other readers. Many have expressed this to me. I request the scholars to send such personal mails to the concerned persons. - as BVP manage-team - no personal}  
  
With these views I request scholars to write on Indology and other blogs also.  
  
With best regards  
Shrinivasa Varakhedi
