Dear Mrs. Raji,  
  

I have prepared a basic text in Sanskrit grammar. It is in both Devanagari and roman scripts.  I do not know at what stage you are.
If you are interested I can send a soft copy of it to you. It can help you to know where you stand and how to proceed further. It consists of exercises in each lesson. If you want to work on the exercises and send it to me, I can correct them and send them back to you with comments.  
  

with regards,  

ramaratnam
