The current CBSE pedagogic method is different from the ones used in grammar books.

  

However if you want to learn and teach your grandson, M. R. Kale's Higher Sanskrit Grammar is a classic - it would not be incorrect to describe it as a concise presentation of the Siddhantakaumudi in English. It is available [athttps://archive.org/details/highersanskritgr00kaleuoft](https://archive.org/details/highersanskritgr00kaleuoft)
