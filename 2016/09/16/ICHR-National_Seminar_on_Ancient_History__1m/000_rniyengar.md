Dear Members,

I received from ICHR announcement about the forthcoming Seminar on an interesting topic: **Indian History up to 1st Millennium BC**. I am glad ICHR has taken the initiative to open up

topics not discussed widely and much less studied academically; for example AIT circa, 1200 BC; Historicity of Krishna; Relation between Vedic and IVC etc. Many of these issues are of seminal importance to our Culture. It may not be possible to know the past with 100% certainty, still it would be worthwhile to map the evolution with as high a probability as possible. The notification is attached.

Thanks

RN Iyengar
