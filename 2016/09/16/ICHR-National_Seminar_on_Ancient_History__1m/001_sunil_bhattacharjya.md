Namaste,  
  

Thank you Prof. RNI for informing us about the forthcoming seminar proposed by ICHR. but the attachment does not appear to be the complete announcement. I hope Michel Daninoji, who is a member of BVP as well as a member of the ICHR, will be kind enough to throw more light on this forthcoming seminar and let us know where one can have a look at the complete original announcement, giving the details such as whom to contact for any further enquiry etc.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
