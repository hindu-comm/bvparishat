I fully agree with the remarks of Prof. Jha, who has of late been looking rather seriously into the machinations of these Neo-Orientalists.

  

As aptly assessed by him, Prof. Paturi is equal to the task, with few to match him - whether in the perception of the problem,

or the presentation of forthright answers.

  

As the Convener, I heartily invite Prof. Paturi to the Conference, due to be held in the second week of February (dates yet to be finalised) at Delhi.

  

A few powerful voices such as of Paturi go a long way in inspiring many scholars, especially the younger ones, in taking by the horns the well-seasoned misrepresenters of our heritage.
