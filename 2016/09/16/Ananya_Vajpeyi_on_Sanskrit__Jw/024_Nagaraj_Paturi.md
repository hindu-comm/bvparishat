\>You will find out there is other side to this debate.

  

Which is this other side? The Video is presenting "There was no Aryan Invasion " side. The other side should be "There was Aryan Invasion".

  

Do you mean Dr Joshi, that if one tries to get the books on the Persian Empire of the known history, or at least tries to read the ancient histories of Afghanistan, Kirghizstan, Kazakhastan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, one will find out (evidences for?)"there was Aryan Invasion" side?

  

I always knew that you have a great interest and command over the relations between India and the above mentioned parts of the world. I did not know that you found out , on the basis of this knowledge (evidences for?)"there was Aryan Invasion" side?

  

Interesting.

  

Can you please elaborate?
