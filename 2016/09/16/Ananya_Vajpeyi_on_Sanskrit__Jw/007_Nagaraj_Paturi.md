Thanks to Prof. Kannan and Prof. V N Jha for their kind remarks.

  

But I am not sure if I can really raise to the expectations of SI organizers.

  

In any case, though it is unsolicited, I would continue to suggest that SI needs to prioritizehelping willingtraditional Sanskrit scholars to participate in the contemporarypolemics around the ideas that they love and command. Workshops and refresher courses with this objectivecan remove the lacuna of absence or smaller participation from their side.

  

Second priority should be training our youngsters in the *critical reception* of the social sciences and humanities knowledge output particularly that related to Indian culture.

  

PS: Ithank Poojya Sataavadhaani Ganeshji for his kind blessings.
