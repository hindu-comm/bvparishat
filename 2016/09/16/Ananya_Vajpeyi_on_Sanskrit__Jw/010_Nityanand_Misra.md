No offence to Ms Ananya Vajpayee, but I was reminded of her article (which I read yesterday morning) when I read the article *The Intellectual Yet Idiot*by Nassim Nicholas Taleb yesterday evening.

  

*What we have been seeing worldwide, from India to the UK to the US, is the rebellion against the inner circle of no-skin-in-the-game policymaking “clerks” and journalists-insiders, that class of paternalistic semi-intellectual experts with some Ivy league, Oxford-Cambridge, or similar label-driven education who are telling the rest of us 1) what to do, 2) what to eat, 3) how to speak, 4) how to think… and 5) who to vote for.*
