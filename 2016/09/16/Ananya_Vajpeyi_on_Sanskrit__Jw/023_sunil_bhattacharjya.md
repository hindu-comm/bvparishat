It is a pity that this champion of truth David frawley discredits the Aryan Invasion Theory, on one hand yet supports dstortions in ancient Indian history caused by the Aryan Invasion Theory (AIT) and its modified version the Aryan Migration Theory (AMT). . He still supports the 4th century BCE date of Chandragupta Maurya, which is the very basis of the AIT.
