Dear Prof. Paturiji,  
  

Sorry for the misunderstanding. I am sure NRJ will soon send the elaborations as requested by you.  
  

Yes, the antiquity of the Vedas can be established through historical studies with the authentic dating of the key milestones of the ancient Indian history. My studies have shown me that the Mahabharata war indeed took place more than 5,000 years ago. God willing, I may be able to write that work in detail, soon. The dating of Adi Shankara may appear to some as having some snags, though in reality that may not be so. At one time the Shringeri Math, the Kudali-Shringeri math and the Kanchi- Kamakoti math are said to have had the great scholar Shri Vidyashankar Tirtha (also known as Shri Vidyatirtha or Shri Vidyashankar) in common and that could mean the Sringeri math is also as old and as genuine as any of the other Shankara- mathas.  
  

As regards the antiquity of the Vedas through their astronomical stuidies, late Prabodh Chandra Sengupta and Bal Gangadhar Tilak had already done good work towards establishing the ancientness of the Vedas, much before any other religio-philosophical works anywhere in the world.
