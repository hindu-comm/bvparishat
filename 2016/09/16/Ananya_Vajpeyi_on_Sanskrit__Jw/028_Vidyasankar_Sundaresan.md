Dear Sunilji,

  

I am amazed at how you find a way to bring in your views on the date of Adi Sankara and the antiquity of the various Mathas into every discussion thread!

  

That said, doing historical research requires one to handle diverse sources of historical information with care and critical scrutiny. I fail to see how you can even make a statement such as the last one above. It should be obvious to any impartial observer that neither the Kudali Matha nor the Kanchi Matha is as old as the Sringeri Matha in history, in guru-Sishya paramparA and in custodianship of the Sankaran vedAnta tradition. The central place of the Sringeri Matha for this tradition in the southern states of India is something that all pundits know and acknowledge, going back to the time when sAyaNa commented on the vedas.

  

As such, a grudging conclusion from you that the Sringeri Matha could be "also as old as ...," based on the most flimsy argumentation, is something that I can only describe as being very funny! I will refrain from saying anything about genuineness and I apologize if I am deviating from my natural personality and am not being very pleasant.

  

Warm regards,

Vidyasankar
