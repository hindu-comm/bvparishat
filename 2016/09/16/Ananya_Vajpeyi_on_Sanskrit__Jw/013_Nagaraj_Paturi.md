PoojyaProf. Deshpande,

  

Sorry for the delay in responding. I am just back from my teaching work.

  

The quoted portions are from a lecture of Swamiji titled as "The Future of India" included primarily in " Lectures from Colombo to Almora" and also in other collections such as Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda.

  

Regards,

  

Nagaraj
