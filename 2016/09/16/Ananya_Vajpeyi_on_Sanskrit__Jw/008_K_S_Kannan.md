Thank you dear Ganesh, for your kind approbation. Will try to persuade Prof. Paturi to participate in the ensuing conference.

  

Already, your own kind acceptance to participate in the conference has given a boost to many. There are very few in the country who can speak with such authority and hold on the primary sources on Rasa theory as you have.

  

And Prof. Paturi joining us will make it even more strong and effective.

  

Thanks once again.

KSKannan
