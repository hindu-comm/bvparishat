AadaraNIya Sunil Bhattacharyaji,

  

My request to elaborate was addressed to Dr N R Joshiji and not you.

  

But that doesn't mean that you can not elaborate? Who am I to stop you from doing that? Why should I?

  

In fact, I think I am gradually able to understand how you think your dating efforts on which you are so hell bent are connected to the AIT or its new incarnation AMT.

  

The whole thing is centred around the date of the Mitanni documents and the date of the earliest Rigvedic compositions. Or, in other words, everything is centred around the sequence between the two. Which is earlier, which is later. The current date of early Rigvedic compositions is being considered/ shown as later to the Mitanni. Your idea probably is that by proving an earlier date that you believe for many events in Indian history, you can prove an earlier date for the early Rigvedic compositions which can change the theory from AMT to OIT.

  

Regards,

  

Nagaraj
