Dear Vidyasankarji,  
  

What I meant is that the Shringeri math was also established in the 5th century BCE and its antiquity is no less than any of the other Shankara mathas. The inner feuds, if any, among the Kudali-Shringeri math, Kanchi Kamakoti math and the Shringeri math, does not affect the historical picture of the ancient India. I consider the date of Adi Shankara is a very important milestone in ancient Indian History.  
  

Regards,
