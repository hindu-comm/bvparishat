Dear Prof Paturi,

  

Many thanks for your kind suggestions.

You have indeed given expression to some of my thoughts which were as yet in a crude form.  

  

Implementing your excellent suggestions may need some time, but will surely be done. we have included a Sanskrit session and a Hindi session this time.

  

Thank you for your concern.  

  

We look forward to your kind participation.

  

Regards

KSKannan
