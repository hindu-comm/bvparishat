Dear Prof. Paturiji,  
  

Thank you for giving me the chance to elaborate. I know many people must have raised their eyebrows when an insignificant small-fry like Sunil Bhattacharjya criticized the well-decorated Dr. David Frawley D..Litt. (Pandit Vamadeva Shastri), who is the recipient of the Padmabhushan, the third highest honour in India, given to him by the BJP Government and who was also earlier honoured by the Congress Government.  
  
In my paper entitled "Dotted Record", presented in the WAVES conference in Florida in 2008 I have explained the genesis of the Aryan Invasion Theory. I have already sent a pdf of this paper to BVP Let me give the short outline here. The western world could not believe that there can be any history of mankind prior to around 4004 BCE, as a Christian priest had shown by his calculation that the world was created around that time. Till the later part of the 19th century CE(AD), the King James edition of the Bible (New Testament) had it mentioned in the very beginning that world was created around 4000 BCE. That is why the
western scholars could not imagine that the Vedas could have been composed before the Hebrew Bible (The Old Testament), which was composed 15th century BCE, according to the internal evidence in that bible. They also thought that all the puranic chronology is fictitious. The French Scholar,Troyer, was the lone westerner who opposed Max Muller, the architect of the Aryan Invasion Theory (AIT) on the strength of his deep study of Rajatarangini. But opposing the British Lion was not that easy and he had to go back from India to France to publish his translation of the Rajatarangini, where he also added a table showing
the authentic chronology of the Kings of Kashmir, clearly showing the true antiquity of the Kings, including Kanishka, all based on the Rajatarangini.  
  
As regards the root of the AIT, Sir William Jones read the account of Megasthenes and found the mention of the name Sandrocottus and he jumped to the conclusion that Sandrocottus must be Chandragupta Maurya ruling from Magadha towards the end of the 4th century BCE and thought that this is how the ancient Indian history could be made to fit in with the creation of the world around 4000 BCE. Max Muller did the rest and announced the AIT, and concocted the AIT time-line and distorted the ancient Indian history, and these distortions are being foolishly ratified by the Indians themselves through all these years. Even in David Frawley's book (coauthored with two others, of which one is Indian and other an western scholar) entitled "**In Search of The Cradle of Civilization**", it is written in **page 61** as follows: "**Chandragupta, the first Maurya emperor, usurped the throne of Magadha in 320 BC" (BCE).** This page is attached, for your ready reference.  
  

I feel sad that there has only been few to be with me in this effort against the distortions in the ancient Indian History, and the BJP government is also unconcerned.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
