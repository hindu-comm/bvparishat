I forgot to mention how critical philology makes 'Living Latin movement" (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_Latin#Living_Latin>)

  

and Hebrew revival movement (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revival_of_the_Hebrew_language>)look to be as dangerous as Hitler.

  

Itimplies that Living Latin was meant for reviving the Estate System (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estates_of_the_realm>) and the slavery employed by the Romans.
