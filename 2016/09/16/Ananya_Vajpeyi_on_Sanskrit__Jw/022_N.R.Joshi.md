Dr A. Veppatangudi, Namaste!



I do not appreciate Anaya and her writings. As far as Aryan Invasion Theory is concerned, please visit the nearby library and try to get the books on the Persian Empire of the known history. Or at least try to read the ancient histories of Afghanistan, Kirghizstan, Kazakhastan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. You will find out there is other side to this debate. THanks. N>RJOSHI
