Thanks to Dr. Ananya Vajpeyi, votary of Prof. Pollock.  
  

So many indignant voices are heard against her iniquitous vociferousness - of eminent scholars such as  

Prof VNJha, Prof Paturi, Prof Girish Nath Jha, Dr Ganesh, Prof Ramaratnam, Prof JSRPrasad, Dr Bijoy Misra, Dr Veernarayan Pandurangi, Dr Pralayamkar &c.  
  

There surely are many more who think on sensible lines, and have not chosen to express themselves against her or her mentor.
