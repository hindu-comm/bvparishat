Dear All,

  

It gives me pleasure to make a second announcement about the Second Edition the Swadeshi Indology Conference (SI-2) to be held in the **first week of February 2017** at New Delhi.

(More details will follow soon).

  

There are three pieces of information to be added.

**1.** The last date for the submission of Abstracts is extended to **10th September**.

  

**2.** Inquiries/requests from numerous participants have made us turn more swadeshi as it were. So we are allowing Sanskrit and Hindi as the media for the papers. So there will be

two 

separate **sessions**

- one 

in Hindi and

one in 

Sanskrit.

  

**3.** Even though the Proceedings of SI-1 (held at Chennai, July 2016) are yet to be published by us, there has been an avalanche of **goodwill and support** for the SI-Conference Series from various quarters. Envisioning the

salutary

impact of the

C

onference

S

eries on our citizenry in general, and Indologists and Sanskrit scholars in particular, voluntary offers for various awards have been made by certain benefactors and patrons of our heritage and its values :

\(a\) **Every paper** selected for presentation will receive a stipend of Rs. 20,000/=.

\(b\) **Ten Best Paper Awards** of Rs. 70,000/= each have also been announced in addition.

  

The excellent papers may thus garner Rs. 90,000/=

 

!

  

Please note that all the selected papers in SI-1 also received the stipend. The Best Paper Awards are the new addition for SI-2.

  

There will however be a strict double-blind referral system, as it was

done 

in SI-1.

  

I request all serious Indic scholars to pay attention, and produce quality papers of international standards, and help impart a new and

sober

direction to Indological research.

  

**Prof. KSKannan**

Convener and Editor,

SI-Conference Series
