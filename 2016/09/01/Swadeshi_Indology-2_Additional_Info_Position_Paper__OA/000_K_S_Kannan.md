Dear All,

  

In continuation with the mail sent just now, I wish to furnish one more detail wrt SI-2 to be held at Delhi, the coming February.

  

In order to provide easy digests (for such scholars who may find it difficult to fathom what Pollock is ultimately driving at through his devious logic and tortuous language) some **Position Papers** have been developed this time - for SI-2. Some of these papers also indicate specific and **well-defined topics** that can be taken up for critical evaluation.

  

The Position Papers make transparent the peculiar

profanations

of Pollock, so that **examining his logic on merits** becomes less arduous.

  

S

cholars

young and old alike 

may

find

these particularly

helpful

\-

in pitching upon apt and apposite

**original sources** for specific issues, and thereby attempt

some 

sound and sensible analyses

 of the assertions and asseverations of Pollock that need assessment and appraisal

.
