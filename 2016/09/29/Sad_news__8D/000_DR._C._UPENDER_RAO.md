Dear friends,

  

I got a message from the son of prof. Sridhar Vashishtha about the sudden demise of his father. I couldnt believe this. I confirmed on whatsapp too. I'm very very sad to know this ðŸ˜­. We lost ever smiling, affectionate great Sanskrit scholar who used to encourage me and many Sanskrit scholars.

  

I'm sure at least in Delhi we can't find alternative to prof. Sridhar Vashishtha Ji.

  

Iexpress my deep condolences.

  

Prof. Rao
