Namaste

  

It is sad to keep on hearing of passing away of Sanskrit scholars. It gives a sad feeling to see the number of Sanskrit scholars is decreasing and we are not hearing new and young scholars coming up.

  

It will be good to have a Data Base of Sanskrit scholars in the world. This will give good feeling to know how many scholars are still living. How many young scholars are there?

  

Is there a Data Base like this on the Internet?
