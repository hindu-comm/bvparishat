Dear Dr Bijoy Mishra,



Thanks for your views. In my opinion the statement "Vedic people from the mainland India" is very vague. There were hundreds of tribes in the ancient India. Historians of Alexander had listed many of these tribes of the known history 326 BC.The supporters of OIT never tell us who exactly migrated from Indus valley region in the westward direction. And if they did, why did they go? Indian subcontinent is large in size. Indian peoplemigrated westwards is very vague statement. Thanks. N.R.Joshi

Shrikant Talageri in his book "Final Evidence" does cite Vedic reference

of the possible migration of people from Indus westward. I have not checked

these references. Taking Dr Joshi's Mahabharata references, one may think

that the settlements of Mahabharata are the tracks of the westwards migrating

"vedic" people from the mainland India.



Others here would know more and might articulate better.
