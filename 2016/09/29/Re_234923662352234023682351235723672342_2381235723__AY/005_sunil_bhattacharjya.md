Dear Bijoji,  
  

As regards Avesta I did not say that Avesta could be a product of Buddhist expansion. I only referred to Alberuni's statement that when Zarathustra propagated his religion he had to do it against Buddhism which was already prevailing in Persia. This also shows that Buddhism was propagated much earlier. Alberuni was right because the Rajatarangini shows that Ashoka Maurya was ruling in the 15th century BCE and Kanishka was ruling in the 13th century BCE.  
  

Regards,
