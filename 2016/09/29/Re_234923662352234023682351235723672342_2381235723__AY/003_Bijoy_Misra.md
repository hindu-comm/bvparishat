Sunilji,

These dates do not make much impact on dating the Vedas. It is the Avesta's date.

Avesta is currently dated between 900 to 700 BC. You claim that Avesta could be

a product of Buddhist expansion. This is new. Dr Joshi asks who are the people(tribes)

that moved. It could also be religious conversion and cultural influence like in South

East Asia. I guess you can join with Dr Joshi to find more answers.

Best regards,

BM
