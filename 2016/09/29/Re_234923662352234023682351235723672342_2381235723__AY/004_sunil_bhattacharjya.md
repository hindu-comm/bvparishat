Bijoyji,  
  

The Persian empire mentioned by Dr. Joshi was the empire of Cyrus the Great, who lived till only about two hundred years before Alexander's invasion of Persia. Cyrus was given all the powers by his father eight years before his death. Cyrus became the emperor of the Persian empire when his father died and that year is called Sakarajnyabhisheka kala. There is an Era by that name, which is referred to in many of the inscriptions.  
  

I have no problem in joining Dr. Joshi, except that he is somewhat tight-lipped. May be he is thinking of writing a book on the subject and want to hold the details for that reason.
