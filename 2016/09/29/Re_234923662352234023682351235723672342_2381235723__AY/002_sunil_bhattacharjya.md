Dear Bijoyji,  
  
You may be surprised that Shri Talageri also believes in the AIT time-line, though he proposes the Out of India theory (OIT) to replace the AIT . All these anti-AIt crusades do not bother the Marxist historians, as long as the crusaders stick to the AIT limeline, according to which Chandragupta Maurya lived in the 4th century BCE and not in the 15th century BCE and Lord Buddha lived in the 6th century BCE. and not in the 19th century BCE
