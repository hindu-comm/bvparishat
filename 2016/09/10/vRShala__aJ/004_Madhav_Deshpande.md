The use of the word Vṛṣala used frequently in reference to Candragupta by Cāṇakya in Viśākhadatta's Mudrārākṣasa has caused scholars to think of an alternative explanation of this word in this drama. For details, see:K. Manjeshwar, 1960, “The WordVṛṣalain Mudāarākṣasa”, in H.L. Hariyappa and M.M. Patkar (eds), Professor P. K. Gode Commemoration Volume, Poona. Manjeshwar, in my opinion, convincingly argues that the word Vṛṣala in this drama is most likely a Sanskritization of the Greek word Basileos that appears on the coins of the Indo-Greek kings, and which is rendered on the obverse of those coins by the Indic word Mahārāja. It is difficult to imagine Cāṇakya calling Candragupta by this word, if it indeed had only a derogatory meaning. Manjeshwar's suggestion is worth consideration, especially in reference to the use of this word in Mudrārākṣasa.
