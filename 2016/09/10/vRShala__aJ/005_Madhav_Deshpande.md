Here is coin of the Indo-Greek king Menander (= Milinda of the Pali Milindapanha) with Greek and Prakrit legends, where the Greek word "Balilews" is rendered by "Mahārāja" in Prakrit. \[see the attached picture\]. Interestingly, the first person who referred to this possible explanation of the use of Vṛṣala in the Mudrārākṣasa was my Sanskrit teacher, Late Pandit N. N. Bhide, from Pune. He had probably come across the article by Manjeshwar published in theP. K. Gode Commemoration Volume, Poona. That is my guess.
