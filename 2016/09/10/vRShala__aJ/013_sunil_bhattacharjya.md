Namaste,  
  
What you said may make good sense, as Manu says that if a girl is not given in marriage by the father (or say by the brother, if father is not alive) within three years of her attaining puberty she can choose her husband on her own. That may be risky proposition at times and if the results of a girl choosing a husband on her own leads to bad consequences for her, she could probably be called a *vṛṣalī*. This is however only a guess.  
  

Vrshabh stands for all that is good and firm, but even a Vrshabh can fail unwillingly. It is said that Lord Shiva asked his Vrshabh to advise mankind to eat sparingly but take bath every day, but the Vrshabh forgot that and advised mankind to eat everyday and take bath as they wish or so. Because of that mistake Lord Shiva said that vrshabh will have to help mankind to till land so that mankind can grow food for eating every day. Can we say that vrshali can be one who may appear to be at fault, though innocent at heart? This is also a guess.  
  

Regards,
