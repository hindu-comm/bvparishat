Namaste



1. Here is a survey report titled: What is the worth of Religion in America ? which may be an interesting read for scholars of Religion. (And Religion here means mainly Christianity !). The ‘Yoga (product and services) Market’ under which Hinduism as a ‘religion in US may fit in is just a pittance of 7 billion USD versus 1.2 Trillion power of Abrahamic religion.



# Religion in US 'worth more than Google and Apple combined'

**Why this analysis is relevant and a similar analysis is needed for Sanskrit using ‘Religions/ community’ ? Language plays an important role in Religion Preservation, Practice and Propagation for survival and growth. **Religion –Political Power and Education have always an intertwined in-connection. The heads of Religion-Political Organization and Education institution share one common trait : ‘Control on People – Connection with Society and Seekers of Means to tap in to wealth of community’. All these teams need a scholar of language of religion to serve them ( in different capacities; and be a counsel). 



 The linguists of language of Religion ( Which ever it be ) needs to know the current audience of faith to whom they are serving OR the audience of faith who watch for wisdom unfolding embedded in classical languages of scriptures . Each religion has its own model of outreaching the ‘language of God/s and Scriptures (Deva Bhashaa – Shaastra bhashaa) ’ to the current faith practicing communities.
Sanskrit is no different in this model within the ambit of Hinduism ( and possibly Yoga) practitioners. Srimad Bhagavad-Gita is a book of Yoga in Samskruth language is the case, which is used to spread Hinduism globally. 



Should not scholars of language of religion be a part of such a big market worthy ‘product’ ? And that opens the question: What is worth of Sanskrit / Sanskrit Scholar in India ?
