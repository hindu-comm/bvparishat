In my last email I should have added that I know Prof. Janaki Prasad Dwivedi as a scholar who has made significant addition to our knowledge of non-Pāṇinian grammars. I do not recall meeting him in person. His books are:

  

1987\. Saṁskṛta ke Bauddha Vaiyākaraṇa: Buddhist Grammarians, Commentators and Tibetan Translator\[s?\] of Sanskrit Grammar.

1988\. Kālāpa-vyākaraṇam (in Sanskrit).

2004\. A Comparative and Critical Study of Katantra and Kaccayana Grammars.

2000\. A Brief Introduction of \[—> to?\] Buddhist and Tibetan Astrology.Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies, Sarnath

2009\. Kātantra Vyākaraṇakī Vijaya-yātrā.

  

Similar notes about the other honourees of the President of India for the year 2016 will be appreciated.
