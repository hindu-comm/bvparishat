Shri Nityanand Misra has served the field of Sanskrit by circulating expeditiously the list of scholars who received recognition from the President of India.

  

Usually, in the past, when such a list came out, this forum has seen a large number of messages that congratulated the recipients. May I suggest that forum members should not simply congratulate but also write a few words about the contributions made by the recipients to the field of Sanskrit? This may be publications, historical research, attaining of extraordinary proficiency in some traditional branch of learning or creating a large number of excellent students (particularly students gifted with originality). Whatever the distinctive achievement may be, it should be made known to others by those forum members who know the recipient. Simply writing words of happiness or respect would be a waste of forum space and time. Such words offer no inspiration or guidance to other scholars, especially to young emerging scholars, do not help in giving us a sense of where the field is heading, do not enlighten us about the distinctions in provincial pursuits of Sanskrit and fail to assure us that the selection process is, on the whole, fair and even-handed. So, beginning with this year, let us use the occasion of the granting of Presidential Awards not only to celebrate the work of fellow Sanskrit devotees but also to know more about our field and its current condition.

  

In the published list, I am directly aware only of the work of Dr. Fernando Tola. He is an Argentinian scholar who has been writing, mostly in collaboration with his wifeCarmen Dragonetti, on Indian philosophy. I would expect him to be about 100 years old. There are very few Sanskrit scholars in South America. Brazil is slowly adding to their number. I have so far met only one Sanskrit-knowing person from Argentina in addition toFernando Tola andCarmen Dragonetti. The latter two seem to have served Sanskrit through their modest private seminar/institute of Indology /Centre for philosophical research in Buenos Aires.When I met them in Poland in 2006, I learned thatFernando Tola had learned his philosophical Sanskrit from Prof. R.D. Karmarkar in Pune (probably in the 1950s).
