Mr. PVN,

 There is virodha in your statements: on one hand you are concerned that people will worship it, on the other hand, you are concerned that crows will defecate on it.

 Strange that you didn't realize this.

 Secondly, because you are against the idol being installed, you shouldn't bother as to how it looks. Because, according to you, no idol is a good replica.

 What is your great pain when Anil pointed out that there has been leftist interference against even the idea of the university? We are forced to suspect that you are the one who has very strong political views but wish to maintain them in your closet.

svasti,  
 bhavaaniibhaaratii jayatetamaam,  
 shrivathsa.
