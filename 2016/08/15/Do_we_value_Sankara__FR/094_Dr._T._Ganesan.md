It's also a fact that in the Sankaracharya Sanskrit University, there is a Department (or a Professor ?) for teaching Arabic language. !!! I do not know whether many are aware of it .  
  
When asked why such a department in a Sanskrit University, a few of the faculties told that it was due to political considerations. Such is* Keralam which has a highly politicized populace.* as stated by Mr. PVN in his earlier mail. !!!!
