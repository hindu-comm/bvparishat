Dear Prof. Narayanan,

  

Let me attempt to paraphrase your views from your statements below and ask a few questions.

  

1\. The proposed statue/idol would necessarily be not a likeness of the historical Sankara bhagavatpAda. Yes, I agree, because the art of photography wasn't born during his times. We have only our own contemporary imaginations to fill in the ancient gaps.

  

2\. The vigraha-s and paintings that inform the popular image were created in the 19th/20th century. Again, I agree, but I fail to see on what basis you judge their creators as being artistically or intellectually inferior or perhaps both.

  

3\. .Any image that may be put up will therefore be like that of a generic picture of a Swami of the modern age. Perhaps so,perhaps not. The typical kind of picture drawn for Sankara depicts him in robes that don't resemble anything within the range of what daSanAmI sannyAsin-s traditionally have been wearing over the centuries. The vigraha-s that are installed in various maTha shrines and temples seem to follow typical Silpa SAstra guidelines and get vastra alaMkAra-s based on the artistic imagination and capabilities of the officiating pUjAri.

  

4\. You equate a statue to an IDOL (capitalization yours). I wonder if you have a generic objection to any and all idol worship or if you have a specific objection to potential worship of a statue that has the potential to become an idol.

  

5\. The Kanchi Matha's Keerti Stupa is adjacent to proposed location of a new statue. I was under the impression that this Stupa building is more like a tourist attraction than a temple per se. There is no garbhagRha inside that structure, no mUrti-s consecrated, no pUjAri-s/purohita-s or melSAnti-s or tantri-s associated with it. Certainly, this building is nothing like the maTha and temples run by the Sringeri maTha on the banks of the river. Unlike in the northern parts of India, a generic visitor doesn't have the option to himself offer a pUjA to an idol in Kerala,does he?

  

6\. Finally, I infer that you think \*all\* the contemporary maTha shrines that offer standard traditional pUjA-s to vigraha-s of Sankara are somehow bringing shame to the name of Adi Sankara and are making his real admirers desperate. I'm not sure what the desperation is above, but left unstated in your statement is a charge that the current maTha-s and other institutions are not "real admirers" of Sankara bhagavatpAda. I would really like to know who these said real admirers are and what are they doing to address their desperation.

  

With best regards,

Vidyasankar
