True, below is the table of disciplinewise distribution at the university.

  

\>(Although a school is there in the name of Sankara no research facility for students are available there.)

  

Probably, Dr PVN is pointing at the Faculty of Indian Metaphysics and the department of Sanskrit Vedanta in that.

  

\>Is it the responsibility of academicians and academic institutions to undertake the propaganda of spreading bhakti ? (This is what actually happened with the existing statue, and the same is feared with the new one.)

  

Fortunately or unfortunately, the proposed statue is way different from the iconized image of Sankara, so can not invoke Bhakti.
