If a statue helps with Universities Social responsibility and increase NAAC score it must be done. A University also needs to cater to on lookers and tourists is another added dimension. I did not know about this. From the recent post I read a statue of Sankaracharya already exists in the university area. They want to install one more. They can if their administrators want to.

@Ajit ji. Why a layman would visit a university?I know hundreds of pilgrims who visited BHU while on a trip to Varanasi. Some as part of tour package (consisting of students mainly) and some on their own even though they are mere graduates or school dropouts. Same is the case with OU or UH in Hyderabad. It's simple curiosity. People who could not pursue higher education want to just step into a university at least as a visitor. Don't expect only academicians to have interest in universities.
