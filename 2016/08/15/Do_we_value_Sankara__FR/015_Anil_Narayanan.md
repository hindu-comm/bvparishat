Pranams..  
 I know that there will be many teachers like Dr.P.V. Narayanan in Sree sankaracharya University who silently support the activities and intellectual ideas of the protestors..Facts are always facts..Please do not state that there was no protest..See the photo of the protest attached with my previous mail..More than the matter of propriety, this is a matter of self-respect..If some persons who visit Kanchi mutt, visit Sree Sankaracharya university and offer their salutations before the statue of Acharya, it does not affect the activities of the University..We know which activities are adversely affecting a University..It is pretty clear that Dr. P.V. Narayanan is taking his stand with the protestors..But sure and certain these kind of protests against the self and silent supports to them are alarming..But as noted, researches and deliberations on the works of Srisankara are always welcome..  
 With all respect and regards,  
 Anil.
