Dear Prof. Nagaraj Paturi,

I sincerely request you to pardon me if my words have personally hurt or discomforted you.

I had no intention to humiliate you or somebody else.

My contention is only with the views of certain members who responded emotionally and unreasonably without knowing the details and reality of the issue.

Hence,, the words articulated by me are of firm conviction.



I do not comment anything more as I have already withdrawn from the discussion on this issue.



Abhivādaye!
