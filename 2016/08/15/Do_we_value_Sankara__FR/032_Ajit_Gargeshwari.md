Exactly then Why are we debating this in BVP instead of them being debated in decision making and implementation boies of the university. If a university has taken a decision Police and law will protect the university decision

Is developing greenery on the campusis the university'score function?



But that is done because it has an indirect benefit in favour of the core function of the university.



Similarly, all thespacedesigning of the campus including the installation of inspiring pieces of graphic and plastic art matching the ethos of theuniversity indirectly contribute to the university's performance of its core function.



Any decision in a university istaken or implemented following all the procedures laid down in its statutes ,passing through all the universitybodies meant for the purposes of decision making and implementation.



Courts question only non-conformity with such procedures.

There is no university at Vivekananda Rock Memorial. One has to keep in mind Government can give money for all sections of society to propagate their faith. I know very well secularism is highly debatable. I have already said before, The question if a statue resembles Adi Shankara or not does not arise. I have also said there legal part a university can approach court. My primary question in what is a university and its core function. Perhaps for some to erect statues.

Talking of tax payer's money,



**Thiruvalluvar Statue**



In 1979, the then Prime Minister [Morarji Desai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morarji_Desai "Morarji Desai") laid the foundation stone for the statue. However, the installation and the sculpting work began on September 6, 1990, on the tiny island adjacent to [Vivekananda Rock Memorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivekananda_Rock_Memorial "Vivekananda Rock Memorial") when funds were allocated in the 1990-91 budget. Initially, the project stalled but then recommenced in 1997 and was completed on January 1, 2000. At the cost of more than US$1 million (INR 61.4 million),

Malaviya is most remembered as the founder of Banaras Hindu University (BHU) at Varanasi in 1916, which was created under the B.H.U. Act, 1915. Adi Sanakarcharya is not the founder of the university under discussion. People don’t offer pujas to Madan Mohan Malviya , Nehru or Gandhi But Adi Shankar is believed to be an incarnation of Sankara himself.



An image of an idol on professors desk is different from erecting a statue and creating a park around the statue of a religious person after whom a university is named and offering floral tributes hence the controversy and my questions arose. Universities primary and core function is different. Why not use the funds in a better way. I understand there is a legal side and emotional side. Why should universities not take the legal side and stick to its core purpose.

Ajit ji,

These are my views:

We beat around the bush, in the name of so-called secularism. Then, what could be the final list of religious personalities, when we plan to erect anyone's statue/idol. My response was not exclusive to Kalady University.

I am wondering, what do we do with installed statues like that of Madan Mohan Malviya at BHU. What do we do with Saraswati idols installed in most of Kendriya Vidyalaya schools in India. Others can quote many more such examples. Here, I would like to refer to a famous University where a student committed suicide due to various reasons, and issue was highly policiticized. Do we grant permission to statue/bust size images of people which are installed in Universities, not using tax player's money?

Regards

The question if a statue resembles Adi Shankara or not does not arise. The question arises if universities which are established by acts of State legislatures have powers to erect statues after which the universities are named. If the statue represents a religious person should worship be allowed with universities money. Do universities have the power to use tax payers money given to them for erecting statues. Are universities established to erect statues build architectural marvels build parks, art galleries in the names of their founders? . Do universities don’t find better activities to be involved with. Some questions the court may answer, some universities themselves need to find an answer
