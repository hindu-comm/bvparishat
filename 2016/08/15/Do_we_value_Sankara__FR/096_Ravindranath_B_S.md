People who want a secular society are fighting and debating in a unsecular way about placing Shankara’s idol/icon and talk about secularity, Shankara's slogan liberation through knowledge is not working for today's world because people with knowledge don't fight they resolve the difference, then only it can be called as secularism, today's intellectuals are in the process of making all the ancient knowledge as hypothesis by showing that the cat and tiger are same with the power of literacy.



 We are very weak in understanding the language or we have made our language very weak, that is why we are unable to communicate to each other hence the differences are arising and people are trying to prove their strength by fighting because there is a knowledge deficiency, we don't have standards of right and wrong, in Shankara's period they had standards to prove their knowledge, today every tom dick and harry are fighting with their own standards which are conflicting.



 Today our society infected by the virus of literacy because literacy without knowledge is very dangerous and intellectuals have to give a serious thought about it, we are making our life miserable by justifying, and justification is needed when one makes mistake because right things need not be justified, like we are making team of left and right to prove which face of the coin is important or correct without realising that the value is one only and the faces make no difference to the value of the coin, today people know everything of everything and understand nothing.



 Having a debate whether to install a statue of Shankara itself is an insult to him as well to us **LIBERATION THROUGH KNOWLEDGE** is not achieved because we could see a very big gap of knowledge.
