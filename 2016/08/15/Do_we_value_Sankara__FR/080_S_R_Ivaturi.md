@Ajit ji. Why a layman would visit a university?I know hundreds of pilgrims who visited BHU while on a trip to Varanasi. Some as part of tour package (consisting of students mainly) and some on their own even though they are mere graduates or school dropouts. Same is the case with OU or UH in Hyderabad. It's simple curiosity. People who could not pursue higher education want to just step into a university at least as a visitor. Don't expect only academicians to have interest in universities.  
Now to the question what is the purpose of a university? UGC and NAAC expect colleges and universities to have community awareness and outreach, and chalk out programmes keeping in mind people around them. Social responsibility of the higher education institutions is very much stressed on these days.
