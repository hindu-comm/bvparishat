Dear Members,

  

I second the opinion expressed by Prof. Iyengar. Sri Anil or someone can make a petition in [change.org](http://change.org). lets support it. let is be in public place. BVP is a closed list, where public participation is less. BVP expresses its solidarity and wholehearted support. Too much discussion without any action will not help us. This does not need a debate but action.

  

with best regards,

shrivarahedi
