\> At the same time, we must think about an important fact that Adi Sankara's pictures/statues/idols which are now in vogue have nothing to do with the real image of the great teacher, because nobody does have anauthenticimage of him.All of the images and statues that we see now are the poor products of artistically/intellectually poorer people of19th and 20th centuries CE.

Sorry for this intervention, but on a lighter note.. Then, we must warn the Chinna Jeeyar Swamy Trust, Hyderabad which is erecting a 216 ft sitting statue of Sri Ramanuja, on the occasion of his sahasraabdi-utsava. Also, we may have to remove all Ravivarma's images of Saraswati etc., from our house hold and rush to ekaanta, to realize the real naama-roopa of supreme reality.
