The question if a statue resembles Adi Shankara or not does not arise. The question arises if universities which are established by acts of State legislatures have powers to erect statues after which the universities are named. If the statue represents a religious person should worship be allowed with universities money. Do universities have the power to use tax payers money given to them for erecting statues. Are universities established to erect statues build architectural marvels build parks, art galleries in the names of their founders? . Do universities donâ€™t find better activities to be involved with. Some questions the court may answer, some universities themselves need to find an answer
