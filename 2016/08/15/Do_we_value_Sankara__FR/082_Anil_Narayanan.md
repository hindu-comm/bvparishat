Respected scholars,  
Pranams..  
 Let bring before you some incidents from the history of Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit.  
  
(1) On 1993,Govt. of Kerala passed bill for SSUS and the person who burnt the bill into ashes became it's Vice chancellor later.  
  
(2) One senior professor who gave street-lectures and proclaimed that if SSUS came to existence, it will lead to social/ communal calamity and will affect secularism. He later became the PVC of the University.  
  
(3) When Prof. N.P. Unni was the Vice chancellor, some party protestors crashed and burnt the statue of Sankaracharya.  
  
 The followers of the same protestors are behind the present strike as well. These kind of activities in the campus are are always taking place with the support of the teaching staff. I believe that any person who gave any kind of support to these kind of activities are shame to the society. As a former student of the University, I can unhesitatingly state that politics (especially politics of the teaching faculty) ruins the campus/academia.  
 With regards,  
 Anil.
