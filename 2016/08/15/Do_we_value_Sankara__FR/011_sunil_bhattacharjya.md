Dear friends,  
  
Sorry, there was a slip. Please read the following sentence  

  

Saturn was Tungi in Shankara's horoscope, and there are only about 27 or 28 such periods (each period of of two and a half years duration) in a Millennium.  

  

as follows:  
  

**Saturn was Tungi in Shankara's horoscope, and there are only about 33 0r 34 such periods (each period of of two and a half years duration) in a Millennium.  
  
**

Regards,**
