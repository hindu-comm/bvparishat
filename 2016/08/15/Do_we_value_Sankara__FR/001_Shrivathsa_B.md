hariH OM,  
shrii anil,

 It is disheartening and alarming. The reason for this is the lack of common purpose and unity among Hindus. The dwindling Hindu numbers in Kerala is also a great cause of alarm.

 I can pray to bhagavaan that well meaning people like you increase in the state.

 There is nothing much for scholars to debate on this. Almost everyone here will agree with you and share your pain. A reply to a street protest is either a government crack down or a counter protest. As the government is not favourable, you will have to think about a street protest only.

svasti,  
 bhavaaniibhaaratii jayatetamaam,  
 shrivathsa.
