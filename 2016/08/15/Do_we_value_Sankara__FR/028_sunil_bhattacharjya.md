Dear Anilji,  
  

Sri P.V.Narayananji expressed doubt as to whether the proposed statue at Kaladi would look like Adi Shankara actually was. There is an old statue of Adi Shankara in the Kudali Matha near the confluence of the rivers Tunga and Bhadra. May be the new statue should be made to look like that, unless there are still older statues of Adi Shankara in any other place. Kudali math has a temple of Vidyashankar like the Sringeri Math also has and that shows that these two maths should be sister-maths.  
  

Regards,
