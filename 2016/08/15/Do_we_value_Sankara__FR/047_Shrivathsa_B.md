I propose that Ajit start a new thread on the topic and he leave this thread to the propriety of having idols in universities.

I think the devil's advocate did indeed excel the real devil. But the tragedy of this dismal exchange is that Anil's salutary intentions have been ignored.

If Mr. PVN is really concerned about the Shankara statue, let him also ponder tearing apart a few pages of the Indian constitution which have the images of rAma, kRShna, guru gobind singh in it.

We should be talking about why universities are named in a particular way and why sculptures and images are used therein. Isn't it clear that images and sculptures represent the aspirations of the people, it represents a continuity with an existing tradition. Anyone who seeks to disrupt this is the one to whom such continuity is galling.

One can take the argument of Mr. PVN further and ask as to why a university is built in a particular style. There will be no end to such squabbles.

If only academic excellence were to be the aim of a university, not many of the universities in India will be among the top. But the question of bringing about academic excellence is a totally different question. It is not related to the current issue.
