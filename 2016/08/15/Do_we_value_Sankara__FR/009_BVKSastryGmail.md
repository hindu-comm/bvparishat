Namaste



On Shatavadhani Ganesh \< Yes, it's time for action. > , and
Professor . Varkhedi \< BVP is a closed list, .. BVP expresses its solidarity and wholehearted support. \> The ‘ respect’ needs to get in to action when ‘ respect is overshot’. (Gita wisdom: 1-36) in ‘A-Dharmic way’.

1\. Writing petitions can create an awareness in a widespread way, but generates no tangible action.

2\. The matter is important and sensitive beyond the limited interest of ‘Sanskrit group’ or a ‘select community interest’. The issue is to be seen and projected as ‘ Disrespect to representation of National Heritage and Religious harmony under fundamental rights covered by the constitution and university act, at a Premier institute of dedicated nature, whose vision and mission can not preclude the establishment of a commemoration Statue of Principle Founder of School, whose name the institution bears’.

3. A similar situation had occurred in Kaladi some time, probably a decade back. The small hillock trusted by tradition as the ‘ Shankaracharya mountain’ was commercially invaded by a special interest group. The issue became international . The then chief of Chinmaya mission intervened and took over the ‘ entire place with the commercial
muscle power’, as it was too difficult to fight the issue politically and community wise.

( Note: For an understanding the criticality of this issue and the History related ‘portrayal of Adi Shankaras date in Kerala : 700 AD or 1500 BCE debate, read : <http://discipleofnasrani.blogspot.in/2009/07/shankaracharya-our-beloved-neighbour.html> . This small extract may be sufficient to show the sensitivity of the issue: - Any discussion of Hindu origins and development, especially w.r.t. Kerala, would be quite inadequate without reference to Adi Sankara, the great reformer, teacher, scholar, and author. **Sankaracharya flourished ca. 8th C C.E. or in the first century** before or after the commencement of the Malayalam or Kollam Era in 825 C.E. The great sage was born at Kalady or at Veliyanadu on the opposite shore of the river in his mothers house. **In either case he was born in the midst of a great Christian population affiliated to churches established many centuries before his birth** at nearby places like Malayattoor, Angamaly, Parur, Edappally &c. on the river banks or Churni or the Periyar. **How far his life and thoughts have  
been influenced by this strong Christian presence around him remains to be explored in full.**

Some more interesting read on India –Religion Controversies and Shankaracharya related at:**

; <http://www.satnami.com/Tirupati%20a%20buddhist%20srine.pdf> **



4. In the present case, probably it may be better to find the ‘
suitable provisions within the frame work of University incorporation, take the political- and – academic route through the governor and syndicate and proceed further with the commemoration statue of the Visionary founder by whose name the University is established . In any case the First step and pro-active ( legal and administrative )
initiative needs to come from the chair of the University, as a ‘ focused in-house University issue’ and not as a public and international debate.

For your contemplation please.

Dear friends,

I completely agree with Prof. Varakhedi sir and Prof. Iyengar sir. Yes, it's time for action. If Sri Shankara bhagavtapaada's statue is not allowed in his own birth place and in the very university campus which is named after him, what else to be needed? Excluding him, can any one imagine classical Sanskrit studies in general and Indian philosophy in particular? Such puujyapuujaavyatikrama has be condemned in any domain of Indian learning.

Regards

Ganesh

Dear Members,



I second the opinion expressed by Prof. Iyengar. Sri Anil or someone can make a petition in [change.org](http://change.org). lets support it. let is be in public place. BVP is a closed list, where public participation is less. BVP expresses its solidarity and wholehearted support. Too much discussion without any action will not help us. This does not need a debate but action.



with best regards,

shrivarahedi

Just because some people protest the authorities should not give up the erection of the statue. If you have any apprehensions about this, please start a campaign on Change.org. Not only BVP members but others also in hundreds if not thousands will sign supporting the Memorial, at SSU Kalady.

Namaste..  
 Pls. see the attached. AISF ( a leftist youth organisation) is protesting against building the statue of Sankaracharya at the new entrance of Sree Sankaracharya University, Kalady, Kerala. They are celebrating it as a day against Hindutva. Actually are such protests are protests against our own tradition? Sankara has at least written glosses for prasthanatraya. He is regarded as Acharya and not as a teacher. It is said that the Guruparampara starting from Sadaashiva reaches us through Sankara. **The one and only one university of Sanskrit in Kerala goes by his name. Still, the protestors say they wont allow to build the statue of Sankara. Tomorrow, these protestors may crave for building statues for Carl Marx, Max Muller etc. in Sankaracharya university itself**. Ofcourse, Marx and Muller may be reputed. But one should first of all bow their heads before their own ancestry**. If Sankaracharya university and Kerala can not stand for Sankara, who else? If Indians do not respect Sankara, who else?** I would like to know the opinions of the reputed scholars in this regard. If this forum does not permit the discussion ( regarding it as political and not as academic) , please feel free to write personally.  
 Thanking you,  
 Anil.
