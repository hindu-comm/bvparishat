Is developing greenery on the campusis the university'score function?

  

But that is done because it has an indirect benefit in favour of the core function of the university.

  

Similarly, all thespacedesigning of the campus including the installation of inspiring pieces of graphic and plastic art matching the ethos of theuniversity indirectly contribute to the university's performance of its core function.

  

Any decision in a university istaken or implemented following all the procedures laid down in its statutes ,passing through all the universitybodies meant for the purposes of decision making and implementation.

  

Courts question only non-conformity with such procedures.
