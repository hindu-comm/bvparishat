Please don’t mix issues on threads if you want to discuss of Sankara’s date make a separate thread. This has been discussed before on this list. Posting issues not relevant to the tile of the thread will cause inconvenience to all. Please don’t reply back. I hope you see my point. Thanks

Namaste,

  
  
Thank you for letting us know that some Christians in Kerala think about a possible influence of Christianity on Adi Shankara. Sometime ago I read a paper where a Muslim scholar claimed that Adi Shankara was influenced by Islam. All these may have been confusing the common people.  
  
Hope there would be a debate among the schoilars in India on the issue of the date of Adi Shankara. It may not be very difficult to find the solution, as we know that he was born in a "Nandana" year and there are only 16 or 17 Nandana years in a millennium. Saturn was Tungi in Shankara's horoscope, and there are only about 27 or 28 such periods (each period of of two and a half years duration) in a Millennium. Then there was the Somavamshi king Sudhanva of Avanti (with capital at Mahismati), who was a contemporary of Adi Shankara. I understand that the Bhavishya purana has given the pauranic time period of this king. It may be possible tp find all such relevant information, if there is a common will to find a solution to this nagging issue.

Regards,

Sunil KB
