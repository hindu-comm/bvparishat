Malaviya is most remembered as the founder of Banaras Hindu University (BHU) at Varanasi in 1916, which was created under the B.H.U. Act, 1915. Adi Sanakarcharya is not the founder of the university under discussion. People don’t offer pujas to Madan Mohan Malviya , Nehru or Gandhi But Adi Shankar is believed to be an incarnation of Sankara himself.



An image of an idol on professors desk is different from erecting a statue and creating a park around the statue of a religious person after whom a university is named and offering floral tributes hence the controversy and my questions arose. Universities primary and core function is different. Why not use the funds in a better way. I understand there is a legal side and emotional side. Why should universities not take the legal side and stick to its core purpose.
