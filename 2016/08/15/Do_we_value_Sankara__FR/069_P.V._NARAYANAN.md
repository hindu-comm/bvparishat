Dear scholars,

While seeing the responses of the senior scholars in this issue, now I understand the reasons for the present state of Sanskrit and Sanskrit studies in India.

Thanks, Mr. Anil Narayanan for bringing this issue to the notice BVP members. If my words did hurt you I must say sorry. Let me clarify what I said in my earlier posts on this issue.

It may be observed that, had I not intervened in the discussion it would have gone merely emotional, because there was no scope for a serious discussion in your presentation. It would have only attracted many ‘call for counter-protests’ and ‘emotional sharing’. The real issue should not be confined to the installation of statue or to the protests against it. It should be viewed on the background of the concept of a university. Does a university really need a statue? How will it help Sankara’s contribution? Is it connected with the academics of the university in any way? These are really the prime reasons to be discussed in this regard.

Besides, secondarily, certain common aspects are there to consider. Even if there are statues and idols in some other institutions is it necessary to install a statue in Kalady Sanskrit University? As you too know, the university and the people like me and you are not going to bother about it once it is installed. In the distinct circumstance of the area it will soon be a place of worship and even the university may not have any say on it. As far as a common folk is concerned the style of the statue/idol doesn’t matter. The things are depended on the name of the statue. Thousands of statues and idols are there on road sides across our country and many of them are beingworshipedand the rest are abandoned. You just erect a statue, rest will bedone by the people. At the same time, the statues of great historic figures are abandoned after placing it on city squares and in front of many institutions tolerating defecation of crows. Who would like to see Sankara also in that condition in a university?

Taking all these aspects into account how a person who wishes to find the things rationally, can support this worthless attempt. I do not wish to be one among that senseless category. If you and the other supporters like to be so, freedom for that is allowed by the magnificent constitution of this great country. That’s all.

The admirers/followers/devotees/criticizers can now view the photograph of the statue attached (may not be final) of Adi Sankara which is going to be installed in front of the main entrance of Sanskrit University, Kalady. (See below. Please zoom for a clearer view. Same is also attached as aseparatefile. The sculptor also is seen in the picture. This is taken from a report of an online news channel to which the sculptor gave some explanations about his creation). Once again I stress that my apprehension is not chiefly based on the appearance of this statue.
