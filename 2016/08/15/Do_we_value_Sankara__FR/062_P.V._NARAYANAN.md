I sincerely thank Prof. K.S. Kannan and Prof. Nityanand Misra for pointing out the mistake in using the spelling of the word ‘cease’ as ‘sieze’ in my previous post. No ‘pun’ or ‘play of language’ was intended there. I earnestly admit the mistake committed by me and the lack of attention on my part is regretted.

  

I also request the members of this group to read the very sentence in my earlier post as “Universities willceaseto exist if physical spaces are allocated for satisfying everybody's beliefs.”

  

regards,

P.V. Narayanan.
