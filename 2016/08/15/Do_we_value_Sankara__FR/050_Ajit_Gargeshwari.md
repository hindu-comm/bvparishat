“Tearing apart a few pages of the Indian constitution which have the images of rAma, kRShna, guru gobind singh in it.”



I would like to know which page of Indian constitution has these pictures?

“If only academic excellence were to be the aim of a university, not many of the universities in India will be among the top. But the question of bringing about academic excellence is a totally different question. It is not related to the current issue.”

If Universities focus on academic excellence then India and India Universities will be on the top but many are not allowed due to external and internal factors that’s a different issue. Hence we are having this thread here.



We should be talking about why universities are named in a particular way and why sculptures and images are used therein. Isn't it clear that images and sculptures represent the aspirations of the people, it represents a continuity with an existing tradition. Anyone who seeks to disrupt this is the one to whom such continuity is galling.



Universities created from public money should cater to the aspiration of all sections of the society as enshrined in Indian constitution as per law. It’s a different issue if its private Institution created out of private money. I am for continuing of both traditional and modern methods and numerous universities are created for each of those purposes.
