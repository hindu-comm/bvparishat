Namaste

Too many points coming up in this thread . The unspecified mix of religion education –University under State governance – Public sentiment
( ignomus or Opinion) with ‘ tradition’ may not be a ‘healthy or spiritual’ issue where academics need to get prioritized. May be the thread debate needs a split on several points, like :



a) **Purpose of a Sanskrit University : What will govern this issue ?** IS this a focus on a personality, a philosophy, a language issue, current period public sentiment ? Would this be governed by :

 - the Statute of a state,

- whimsical fancies of an administration

- Compulsion to spend funds

- A donors wish, a Student interest

 - the ideation to Commemorate the memory of a visionary and thought promoter ( Vedanta -Sampradaya Kartaa - Mataacharya ?? – Avataar ) to inspire upcoming generation, in which case the University would be constrained to teach only ‘ One school and shade of Darshana Shaastra and Upaasanaa ; All ‘ secular topics’ need to be shunned or placed on a lower pedestal. And this would incur the wrath of ‘ public exchequer’
audit ! and throw the question to a larger orbit : Should a secular government spend money on one school and shade of Vedanta Thought by
‘Adi Shankara’ for the Heritage Value, Culture, Religion, Language, promotion of philosophy and critical thinking, because the institution was promoted by State for a specific purpose ? ) 



b) **What purpose will a Statue /Idol ( = Pratimaa ? Shilpa ? beyond a ‘ place of worship ) serve on a campus entry or a path-way ?** Why people love to see their ‘ Faiths’ represented in the form of a visual, tangible, material form ( Be it a poster, an advertisement , ’ ? A scaled down icon on the table or photo on wall ? How different is this issue from a ‘Temple –Pratimaa ( as an Archaavataara needing a specific model of worship) where the line of thought may be ‘ Pratimaayaam tu saannidhyam Archakasya tapo-balaat’ Or Pratimaasu –Alpa –Buddheenaam ?



c) On the other side, rather flip side**, is there any specific directive from ‘Aagama and Shilpa Shaastras’ on setting up a ‘ pratimaa in public sans worship’** – ( ‘Pratimaa-Gruha of Bhasa model? Recall Vijayanagar empire where pratimaas broken become the architecture and culture display than ‘worship –items ( even tolerating worst forms of sacrilege) ’ ; And ‘ Father of Nation’ stands shade less on the mid of road, for national commemoration to be remembered once a year !



d) As the instance of a leader of a certain school of Vedanta Thought has been brought up in the debate here, it may be of interest to explore **what the wisdom of politics of Social Justice and Constraints from National Justice say on the ‘Statue and State-Law’.** The case readings relate to \< a reported $425 million of state funds on statues and memorials throughout the impoverished state, the chief minister tabled a state government motion to form a 1,000-officer strong statue protection force. … . \>

\> At the same time, we must think about an important fact that Adi Sankara's pictures/statues/idols which are now in vogue have nothing to do with the real image of the great teacher, because nobody does have anauthenticimage of him.All of the images and statues that we see now are the poor products of artistically/intellectually poorer people of19th and 20th centuries CE.

Sorry for this intervention, but on a lighter note.. Then, we must warn the Chinna Jeeyar Swamy Trust, Hyderabad which is erecting a 216 ft sitting statue of Sri Ramanuja, on the occasion of his sahasraabdi-utsava. Also, we may have to remove all Ravivarma's images of Saraswati etc., from our house hold and rush to ekaanta, to realize the real naama-roopa of supreme reality.
