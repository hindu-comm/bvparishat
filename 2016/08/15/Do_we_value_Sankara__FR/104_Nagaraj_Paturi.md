Dear Prof. PVN,

  

I am just back to my Inbox. That is the reason I could not receive your progress report on my knowledge about the SSUS Kalady that itis yet to be improved considerably. I would certainly try to improve. But can assure you that I can never reach the level of an insider.

  

Your attempt to inconvenience me through your words 'yet to be improved', 'does not seem sensible' etc. show that my post(s) caused some discomfort to you irrespective of my intentions. (I am not surprised because in an earlier post, after addressing with the words 'Dear scholars" you did not hesitate to say, "Taking all these aspects into account how a person who wishes to find the things rationally, can support this worthless attempt. I do not wish to be one among that senseless category. If you and the other supporters like to be so, freedom for that is allowed by the magnificent constitution of this great country. That’s all." (highlighting mine).Knowing that I caused some discomfort to you irrespective of my intentions, I would have to redeem that from my side through my words of apology if you did not help yourself in that direction through your above mentioned words.

  

When you informed the list that "No special consideration for the research students doing Ph.D on the topics related with Sankara’s philosophy is instituted. (Although a school is there in the name of Sankara no research facility for students are available there.)",

  

I expressed my solidarity by saying a very clear and unambiguous "**true**" . But I relied on the website

<http://www.ssus.ac.in/>

for my information about the university and was trying to support you by showing that there was nothing specially devoted to Sankara.

Since your mention of a school dedicated Sankara Vedanta studies was not matching with the info on

<http://www.ssus.ac.in/>,

I was trying to justify your words by saying you probably were pointing to the Faculty of Indian Metaphysics.

  

Now I found

  

<http://isss.ssus.ac.in/>

  

directedby your recent post.

  

It is not reasonable on my part to feel bad about myself for not knowing about this school and this url all by myself. I am satisfied with my attempt to know about a University through its official website.

  

I am now happier now to have known with the help of an insider of the university that there is an International School of Sree Sankaracharya Studies established there.

  

I am sorry to know thatno regular or temporary staff are appointed there.

  

I express my solidarity with those who are fighting for the cause of that great school.

  

Only through your posts I came to know about the proposed sculpture. I am happy for being able to know more about it through my net search.

  

I , as a connoisseur, wanted to express my dissatisfaction with that sculpture by saying that it can not invoke Bhakti. That was not my solace,thatwas my dissatisfaction with that sculpture.

  

Though on the basis of a different reasoning I am not in support of installation of the proposed statue. This is part of general Indian citizen's public opinion.

  

I know that that opinion is absolutely insignificant because the whole affair is internal to a university.

  

This threadhelped me learn a few new things about a university about which I knew little earlier.

  

Let me take leave of the thread with this.

  

Regards,
