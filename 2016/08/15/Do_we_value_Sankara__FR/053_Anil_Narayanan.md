Namaste..  
Dr.P.V. Narayanan is one of the senior reputed lectures and research guide of Sree sankaracharya University and I personally know him. I have attended some of his lectures as well. Sorry sir if my "emotions" disturbs you and thanks are due to you for teaching a lesson that
"superficial" statements have their own worth. Or else such a long discussion should not have taken place.  
With pranams,  
Anil.
