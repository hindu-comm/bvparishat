Dear and Respected friends,

I honestly feel that we should not be cynical in such issues. In the BHU campus it self we have a magnificent temple of Sri vishvanaatha. Even in many of the renowned universities of the west we see chapels. Above all, sanaatanadharma and Sanskrit, one of its wonderful
expression, should not be misread in the "light " of religion or "secularism ". These images, festivals songs, dances and the like are innumerable aspects of our culture where it is difficult or even impossible and above all, unfair to draw artificial lines and this probably is a seriously bad step that divides people and Mars nationalism, the bedrock of any country's development. Hence I see meaning in the words of Sri Shrivathsa.  
Not that you all are unaware of this obvious fact. Mine is just a humble act of smaaraNaM, na tu SikShaNaM.

With deep regards

Ganesh
