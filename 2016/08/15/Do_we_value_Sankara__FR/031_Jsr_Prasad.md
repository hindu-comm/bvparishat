Are we speaking of ethical practices and prescribed core functioning of higher educational institutions in India. If so, we are grown very old. Less said the better. Appointments ranging from VC's to attenders are made under political pressure, caste, region, state/central govt, and many such parameters. The usual practice is , when there is a rule, you can make an exemption; when there is no rule, you can create one!

UGC is the apex body if all higher education. Shall we ask the UGC chairman to remove the Saraswati idol installed on 1st floor of it's head office in Delhi.
