Dear Vidwan Anil Narayananji,

  

Dr. P V Narayanan did not say there was no protest. He only said that he was not part of the protest that was brought to the notice of the list.

  

Nevertheless, he made it very clear that he is opposed to the erection ofthe statue. He wants to say that his reasoning or line of argument for opposing is different from that of the protesters.

  

His bases for opposing are

  

1\. Statue is a poor replica of the actual image.

  

2\. University is a state run body, so should be 'secular' (meaning probably 'secularist')

  

3\. Pilgrimage activity disturbs the academic activity on the campus.

  

What the post of Dr P V Narayanan makes clear isthat there are individuals (at least one)opposed to the statue idea from within the university community itself.

  

Let us take the arguments advanced one by one:

  

1\. Statue is a poor replica of the actual image: This argument when applied to all the idols of the deities, stands in contradiction to the very ethos/ philosophy of idol worship. Which image of any deity can be said to be the 'authentic' image of the deity? Leave alone the ahistorical abstract concept of a deity. Even the images of historical figures we have today can never be said to be authentic images. Not only of those from a very ancient past. Just take the images of MK Gandhiji or Dr BR Ambedkarji. They have taken several different shapes at several different places. Only faint similarities can be seen with the original image. Why, I have seen pictures of the legendary film music composer Ilaya Rajaji on cycle rickshaws and soda shop sign boards, all in their own naïve portrait drawing style. But all of them serve their intended purpose of their users, an outward visualtoolfor an inner activity of emotion.The same point applies to the present case too.

  

2\. Though the wholereality about the secularist nature of states itself is a whole questionable idea. Keeping it aside, establishing
statues has beendone by secularist states at all over the places. Those actions have never been looked at as opposed to secularism.

  

3\. Many university campuses all over the world have a tourist activity of visiting the campus on them. That has never been looked at as a hindrance to their 'scientific' pursuits. Rules can always be framed and implemented to avoid temple like activity at a place that is not intended to be temple.

  

Dr P V Narayanan expressed a great respect for the great preceptor. He has his own way of expressing his respect. Hope he respects their ownmethods of others in expressing their own respect.

  

Warm regards,
