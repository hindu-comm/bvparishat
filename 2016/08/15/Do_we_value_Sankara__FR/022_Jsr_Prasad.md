Ajit ji,

These are my views:

We beat around the bush, in the name of so-called secularism. Then, what could be the final list of religious personalities, when we plan to erect anyone's statue/idol. My response was not exclusive to Kalady University.

I am wondering, what do we do with installed statues like that of Madan Mohan Malviya at BHU. What do we do with Saraswati idols installed in most of Kendriya Vidyalaya schools in India. Others can quote many more such examples. Here, I would like to refer to a famous University where a student committed suicide due to various reasons, and issue was highly policiticized. Do we grant permission to statue/bust size images of people which are installed in Universities, not using tax player's money?
