Saraswathi stands for Goddess of learning or learning in general. Shankaracharya stood for a particular class of Hindu followers. UGC chairman or Chairperson can have any image in his office it’s their choice. It’s a different issue if the chairman or chairperson forces his colleagues to offer salutations to the installed images or he or her in the capacity as Chairman or Chair person of UGC offers floral tributes to images as part of their official work.



This statue controversy is related to political ideology trouble of Kerala so why at all discuss. I agree less said the better.



A lager question is should we start naming universities after every Indian saint and erect their statues? In my view all saints have contributed notably to Indian society. All lead exemplary lives

Are we speaking of ethical practices and prescribed core functioning of higher educational institutions in India. If so, we are grown very old. Less said the better. Appointments ranging from VC's to attenders are made under political pressure, caste, region, state/central govt, and many such parameters. The usual practice is , when there is a rule, you can make an exemption; when there is no rule, you can create one!
