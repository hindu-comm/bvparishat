Dear Scholars,

  

Nobody can conclude if the thread is taken like this further. It will be a rotative thread without finding an end to it. As I said earlier, we can debate on the issues behind all these acts. But we can not discuss what is to be done and what is not.

  

1\. Finding a problem with the installation of an idol is backed by political reasons. It is clear. However, we refrain ourself from political discussions.

2\. Lot of debate has gone into the matter with the inputs from Prof. PVN and others. The question of resemblance or exactness of an idol with a historic personality is not relevant here. The idol stands just as a representation of a personality. Statues of many leaders are installed in various places without any question. Within only it is in case of Shri Shankara's ? What is the motivation behind this ? That is to be answered.

3\. The reason being given for the opposition is not justifiable. As I have witnessed many situations in the university campuses of Kerala state, always one or the other agitations with slogans are staged on the streets against the administration. Is it not disturbing the academic atmosphere of varsities ? Let university admin take the necessary steps to avoid worship disturbances.

4\. If the adequate support is not extended for research in the centres and departments of Vedantic studies, it is to be strongly argued with the authorities. This is nothing to do with the statue construction. Even if this is stopped, that money will not be used for research. As I know the university admin system, such financial freedom is very rare in university system. But, the spirit is acceptable.

4\. I am not in favour of installation of any idol in any public places. However, we should have similar policy to all cases. If it is only for this case, then such questions are inevitable.

5\. If the debate is limited to the idol installation, its fine. Today it is about idol installation. Tomorrow the same will continue with the name of the university. Similar arguments will be given that what if a university is names after Shankaracharya ? Shri Shankaracharya is greater than this. He does not need any such false respect. Therefore remove the name of Sri Shankaracharya from university's board. Such baseless arguments continue.

6\. Shraddha is not a bad idea in academics. But, it promotes the studies. I therefore request all scholars to show your solidarity to the matter. We need not enter into politics to say whatever we feel loudly.

  

I endorse the views expressed by Prof.PVN and Ajith as they have raised very prominent issues and concerns about public funding. But, the same policy shall be applicable to all such cases.

  

I therefore, request the members of BVP to conclude the matter here. No opinions will make others satisfied.

  

with best regards,

shrinivasa varakhedi
