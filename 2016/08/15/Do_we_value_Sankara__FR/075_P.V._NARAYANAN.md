No Sir.

Neither that statue has been changed or shifted from the entrance of the main building.

Tt is still there. ( Now it has become almost an idol of worship and many of the university community offer praying before it).

The present issue is with a new statue(seen in picture) that is going to be erected at the new entrance near by the bus-stand/main road.
