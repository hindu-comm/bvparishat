Namaste..  
 Pls. see the attached. AISF ( a leftist youth organisation) is protesting against building the statue of Sankaracharya at the new entrance of Sree Sankaracharya University, Kalady, Kerala. They are celebrating it as a day against Hindutva. Actually are such protests are protests against our own tradition? Sankara has at least written glosses for prasthanatraya. He is regarded as Acharya and not as a teacher. It is said that the Guruparampara starting from Sadaashiva reaches us through Sankara. The one and only one university of Sanskrit in Kerala goes by his name. Still, the protestors say they wont allow to build the statue of Sankara. Tomorrow, these protestors may crave for building statues for Carl Marx, Max Muller etc. in Sankaracharya university itself. Ofcourse, Marx and Muller may be reputed. But one should first of all bow their heads before their own ancestry. If Sankaracharya university and Kerala can not stand for Sankara, who else? If Indians do not respect Sankara, who else? I would like to know the opinions of the reputed scholars in this regard. If this forum does not permit the discussion ( regarding it as political and not as academic) , please feel free to write personally.  
 Thanking you,  
 Anil.
