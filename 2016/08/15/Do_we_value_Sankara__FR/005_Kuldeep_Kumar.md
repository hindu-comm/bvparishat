This is another proof of intellectual bankruptcy of AISF. They should
know that sankar has given a philosophy of one reality which prevails in every atom of the creation.If his birthplace and University standing for his philosophy and scholarship cannot have his statue at its intrance,should we expect it anywhere else.If they continue with these unmindful tactics,soon they may loose their ground. A wide awareness compaign for this must be launched.

Thanks Mr. Anil for noticing and posting it.I do not see any point in this protest.University may approach to the court.
