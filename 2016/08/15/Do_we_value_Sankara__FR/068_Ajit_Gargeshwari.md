The main opposition in the list are postings is senior Faculty of the University. A Student of the university got this issue to BVP list by showing left protest. As we don’t discuss left ideology other issues were discussed here. Yes, I agree at the end of the day it’s their university and the decision of the universities authority is binding on all who work in the university.

If the name of the university has not disturbed any ideology how can the statue disturb that ? What a logic !

The university administration must remain firm.

Sure it doesn’t hurt anyone. It’s good to have colossal statue. A layman going to a University for what reason may I ask?

Suppose a layman visits the Sankara university and wants to know why the university was named after Sankara. Well, if some space on the campus is used to answer that question with a statue erected and life history engraved all around, it won't harm any one's secular ideology even it be the statue of a religious person.
