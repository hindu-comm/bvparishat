Dear friends,

I completely agree with Prof. Varakhedi sir and Prof. Iyengar sir. Yes, it's time for action. If Sri Shankara bhagavtapaada's statue is not allowed in his own birth place and in the very university campus which is named after him, what else to be needed? Excluding him, can any one imagine classical Sanskrit studies in general and Indian philosophy in particular? Such puujyapuujaavyatikrama has be condemned in any domain of Indian learning.

Regards

Ganesh
