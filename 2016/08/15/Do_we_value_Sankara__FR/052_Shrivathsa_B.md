You are free to check the manuscript if the written constitution of India for the pictures.

Seems like you want to pit academic excellence against the question of identity. You couldn't have been more wrong. This is equivalent to questioning whether a patriot can ever be a good academic. This is simply bad logic.

Universities are indeed run with public money. But that has never stopped them from having images of people of every sort. Why target certain people only? Secondly, who is anybody to judge as to what part of public who give money wish for what. I have never heard of a vote to decide such things. The governing board's independence in this matter has to be respected. We can make our requests. But what you desire is a complete rejection of such ideas.

Mr. PVN didn't specify which particular other svaami's idol he is against. Again, he is also concerned about the exact location of the idol, perhaps not the idea of the idol if it were somewhere else. I want to address a bigger question : whether we should have images / idols of anyone at all in a university and if anyone, who?

My advice to you to start a separate thread on the academic side of the argument was because your intervention here has probably caused a serious issue to be sidetracked. May be that you don't want to realise it.
