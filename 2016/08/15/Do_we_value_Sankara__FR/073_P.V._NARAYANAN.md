The name itself is a sign of reverence of the Kerala society towards the great teacher.

What else you are bringing by placing a statue of a common image?

It is not like placing a statue of Gandhiji, Ambedkar or Vallabh Bhai Patel.

  

This sort of discussion would only lead us to vitandavada.  

All these arguments are to distort the attention from the core issue.

  

P.V. Narayanan.
