Amazing sophistry.  
Mr.PVN,  
1. No sculpture can be an exact replica of the person. Hence, the question cannot be about the "authenticity". You are just indulging in meaningless sophistication. If you want an authentic sculpture of Shankara, will you please specify what age should the sculpture represent? After all Shankara would have undergone various bodily changes till he left his body!  
2. How is it that your heart aches only against the sculpture of Shankara but not the photos of Mohandas Gandhi, Ambedkar etc. Which adorn all campuses? Secular sculptures are Kosher?  
3. Why don't you go the whole hog and protest the naming of the university? This is because the next time I come to kAlaDi, I will do arcanaa to the name of the university because it carries the name of Shankara.

I am not very surprised that with people like you, the protest against the statue will indeed succeed!
