Namaste 



Are we moving or drifting in this thread of discussion from \< Style manual> to \< Research methodology> to \< Teaching programs on research methodology in Sanskrit \> ?



The statement \< teaching /attending research methodology courses in Indian languages including Sanskrit \> is a multi-part issue. Each part of the statement needs a separate mode of addressing.



1.1 – What is the appropriate methodology of research in Languages/ Humanities in general?



 1.1.1 : Is there a suggested traditional methodology
for exploration and engagement in the Indian languages including Sanskrit ? If yes, what is the nature of it ? If ‘ Not’ what does the word ‘ Darshana, Shaastra –Vyakhyana ,Vaada..’ mean? 



 **Note**: Samshodhanaa, the Samskruth word is
inaccurately translated as ‘Research’ .



 The key ingredient of ‘Sam-shodhana’ is
‘Samyak- Shodhana’ which can yield a multi-part meaning : Purification , Filtering, exploration, Discovering, new application, new interpretative perspective, a new application of existing things, upgrade, redefining the practice, contextualization , etc;. In ‘ Language’ domain, and Samskrutham - all these may not have an equal and balanced contribution in a research. So it is for the Researcher, the Guide and the ‘ Institution’ to define what is the definition of
‘Research’ which they want to adapt and award the degree.



 1.1.2: ‘Research Methodology ’ in humanities, languages /Sanskrit is a wide open spectrum, which in principal differs from the research methodologies in quantitative sciences and technology application related research. Every Research ultimately has to fulfill a purpose : The advancement of knowledge, well being of society, reduction of pain and suffering, Better Realization of Self and Nature. And the success- measure of ‘ research contribution’ can be a self-contentment, a social appreciation, or a financial gain.

One can draw examples for each aspect of this and say ‘ one model of research’ is unique in relation to another ! 

1.1.3 : ‘Style’



2. **The summary position I seek from the scholars and research guides is the following**: While the detailed information by Professor Rani Sadashivamurthy provides a detailed resource list on ‘ How to present a ‘ How to prepare and present a document, as an outcome of research engagement and exploration’, do we have any tangible clear guidelines over the primary question \< research methodology in Indian languages including Sanskrit? > ?



We have noticed models of doctoral research thesis getting final
award on the thesis themes like : count and list of ‘ cha’ karas in Mahabharata ! , ‘ Upamas in Kalidas, List of works published in a time period , anthology of writings by a poet…



While I am not contesting the work done and the wisdom of evaluator of thesis, the question still remains unanswered \< What is research methodology in Indian languages including Sanskrit? ? For example, taking Sanskrit grammar research, Would it be adding or removing a
‘Sutra ’ to Panini’s list ? Interpreting a sutra differently from Patanjali ? Short –learning compilation like Siddhanta kaumudi – laghu and parama-laghu versions ?



The clarification would help to see which research thesis would fit in to what category of ‘Research Definition’.
