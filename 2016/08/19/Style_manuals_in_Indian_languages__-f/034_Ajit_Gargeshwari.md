This whole thread can become an interesting topic for further and can act as step towards standardising referencing of works in Indian languages. As we come across titles we should also populate catalogues like world book catalogues [www.worldcat.org](http://www.worldcat.org) which might help future researchers. They will know at least tiles exists if they cannot get the titles!!!

Thanks to for Prof. Paturi for having carefully searched the web and made available titles. Many books are often printed, An online search yields titles. But it becomes extremely difficult to procure them or to source them at libraries. How do scholars overcome this problem?

Unfortunately, information on how many of these (including the Telugu Style Manual to which I contributed) are available in actual print, how any are currently available to buy is not available.
