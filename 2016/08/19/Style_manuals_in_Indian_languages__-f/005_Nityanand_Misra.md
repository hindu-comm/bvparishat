Dear Prof. Varakhedi Ji

  

A *style manual* or *manual of style*, as commonly used, is a set of guidelines and standards for publications (written communication/written language). From the name of the work, *Vāgvyavahārādarśa*, seems to cover*vāgvyavahāra*(oral communication/spokenlanguage).

  

If the*Vāgvyavahārādarśa* does notcover written Sanskrit or guidelines for publishing Sanskrit books or papers, it is not a *style manual*, in the conventional sense of the word.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
