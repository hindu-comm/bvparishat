Now that I have shown through samples of syllabi that style guidelines are taught as part of research methodology courses only, can we now focus, without getting digressed into broader research methodological issues, on the style guidelineaspects of Indian language /literature research methodology courses ?

  

Since we are not able to get hands on published sources as sought by Sri Nityanandji, it may be a good idea to cull out unpublished lecture notes of various Indian language departments on the thesis drafting /style guideline portions of the research methodology courses.

  

Alternatively, members may share their own experiences of how they resolved their Indian language specific thesis drafting / book publication issues.
