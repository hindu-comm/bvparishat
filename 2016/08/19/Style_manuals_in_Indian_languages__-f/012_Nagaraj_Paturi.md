\>that post addresses only a small aspect (citation style for poetic works) and that too focussed on the RCM alone.

  

-- AadaraNIYa Nityanandji,

  

For most part of the research writing in Indian languages, the presentinternational standard books such as MLA or Chicago manuals are sufficient. Only small modifications or additional rules may be required to suit the Indian language sources. In that direction, your suggestions from the experience ofyour RCM work and similar experiences from other scholars will be useful.

  

Forums like BVP can help in that direction.

  

That is why I am asking scholars to share theirexperiences in drafting research articles/dissertations in Indian languages, particularly how and where Chicago manual was insufficientand how they resolved the issue.
