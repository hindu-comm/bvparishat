Sirs

  

We see that modern English borrows from Latin, including in referencing. Examples: *Op. Cit.*, *ibid*, and*et al.* Further, modern abbreviations like pc (personal correspondence) are also found, as are "unpublished manuscript" etc.

  

If a few more terms are going to be added to this terminology, I suggest that we retain Sanskrit terminology.

  

आर्योक्तिः (a.u.), परम्परावाक्यम् (p.v.) etc. instead of traditional.

गुरुवचनम् (g.v) - for received tradition.

Unpublished manuscripts, or publications with scant details are already dealt with in existing style manuals. The same may be followed.

सम्प्रदायप्राप्तम् (s.p.) or साम्प्रदायिकम् (s) for songs etc.

  

Regards

Senani
