Style guides are used by scholars and students are trained to use style guides when they write books articles or submit reports when written in English. My question is for purely Sanskrit thesis or articles are there any standardised style guides? If there are, are they thought as a part of Research methodologies subject in Sanskrit or Indian Universities?

Nityanand Misra ji, is writing the surname before the "first" name a part of some style guide?



Depends on the style guide and what it is a part of (note/bibliography). Page 695 of Chicago Manual of Style (16th ed) says:



14.75 One author. In a note, the author's name is given in the normal order. In a bibliography, where names are arranged alphabetically, it is inverted (last name first ). See also 14.18.
