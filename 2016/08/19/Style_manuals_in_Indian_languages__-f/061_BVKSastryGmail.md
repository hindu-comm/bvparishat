Namaste



1. I agree \< Samskrit has its style evolved over the centuries. We should not succumb to be blindly following or mimicking all that may be taking place in the west or fall a prey to the temptation of working with an imported style.Kalidas ought to be remembered: \>



Similarly naming conventions ( Naama- Karana / Naamoccharana Sampradaya ) as a Samskra has a established convention. The \< asamskrutha naama> when it is to be brought in to \< Samskrutha frame work> needs a prior work. Like Wilson to \< *उइलसन* \> . This samskara seems in the case of names, a personal choice ? should it be so ? Certainly a
debatable issue.



2. The challenge is much more complex when it comes to religious names ! Mohamed becomes – Moha –Mada ?! 



3. Another illustration: How to look for a style on this ?
without impacting the ideas like \< a. Not to reinvent the wheel 
b. for international portability c. for being part of the international standardization > And what is \< आर्योक्तिः (a.u.), परम्परावाक्यम् (p.v.) etc. instead of traditional. गुरुवचनम् (g.v) - for received tradition.> ? >

I remember how my teacher once dictated a verse by a Kolkata Pandit written to H H Wilson and it landed me in a confusion regarding the meter. The last quarter was: " साश्रु ब्रूते स भो भो*उइलसन* महाभाग मां रक्ष रक्ष //" I wrote Wilson as *विलसन* and it was one syllable short of the meter and I reported that the meter was not alright. I was told that in Bengali the name is pronounced as उइलसन and not विल्सन or विलसन as it happens in Hindi. I promptly got it corrected and knew that in different languages a proper name could be placed differently.



In the given context the notion of standardization should not overlook the natural or obvious:



5\. Samskrit has its style evolved over the centuries. We should not succumb to be blindly following or mimicking all that may be taking place in the west or fall a prey to the temptation of working with an imported style.Kalidas ought to be remembered:

पुराणमित्येव न साधु सर्वं न चापि काव्यं नवमित्यवद्यम्। 

सादरं

सु मो मिश्रः।

With specific reference to Sanskrit writing, one of the things that bothers me is how a proper name is handled.Let me illustrate:

This thread may not be out of place to discuss this aspect.

If a few more terms are going to be added to this terminology, I suggest that we retain Sanskrit terminology.
