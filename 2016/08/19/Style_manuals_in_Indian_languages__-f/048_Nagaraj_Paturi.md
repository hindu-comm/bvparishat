Poojya Prof. Sadasivamurty Raniji,

  

The word 'style manual' in contemporary academic parlance, does not refer to books such as the books on rhetoric (the art of effective or persuasive speaking or writing, especially the exploitation of figures of speech and other compositional techniques.), beginning from Cicero in the west or numerous wonderful kavis'ikshaagranthas in Sanskrit.

  

"A **style guide** or **style manual** is a set of standards for the writing and design of documents, either for general use or for a specific publication, organization or field. The implementation of a style guide provides uniformity in style and formatting within a document and across multiple documents. A set of standards for a specific organization is often known as "house style". Style guides are common for general and specialized use, for the general reading and writing audience, and for students and scholars of various academic disciplines, medicine, journalism, the law, government, business, and industry."

  

The thread was initiated for collecting a list of Style Manuals in Indian languages.

  

What is the purpose of looking for style manuals in Indian languages, while such a big number of them with very good work behind them are already available in English? *I thought an Indian language style manual should address specific problems faced by writers in Indian languages* in the aspects mentioned above under style manuals.

  

CIIL has done very good work by conceiving such manuals and conducting workshops to prepare them for various Indian languages. A few them (Tamil, Knnada)seem to have got published. But procuring them seems to be difficult. Information about others is unclear.

  

I have been trying through this thread to collect specific problems faced by writers in Indian languages particularly Sanskrit and solutions if any that have been arrived at.

  

Who can supply such information of problems of insufficiency of the existing style manuals in the case of Sanskrit? Who could have solved those problems? I thought only those venerated scholars on this list who have been engaged in discursive writing or guiding such rigorous writing in the medium of Sanskrit. As such, I requested list members with such experience to help.

  

Highest regards.
