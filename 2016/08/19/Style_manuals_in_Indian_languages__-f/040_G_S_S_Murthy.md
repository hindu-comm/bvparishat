With specific reference to Sanskrit writing, one of the things that bothers me is how a proper name is handled.Let me illustrate:

1\. While referring to name "Gandhi" should we say गान्धिः or गान्धी (गान्धिन्)?

2\. Often to circumvent the problem, one writes "गान्धिवर्यः"/"गान्धीवर्यः/"गान्धीमहोदयः"

3\. Do we say "नेहरु-उपाह्वः जवहर लालः" or " जवहारलालनॆह्रुः"?

Should there be not some standardization? Or do we leave it to the discretion of the writer?

This thread may not be out of place to discuss this aspect.

Regards,

Murthy
