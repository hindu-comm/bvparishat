Respected Prof. Nagaraj Garu!

Namaskarams.

  

Thanks for your kind and great patience in giving reply to all my questions very convincingly.

  

Having been educated by your reply and also having been alerted by the same I tried to understand the term .."Style Guides" or "Style Manuals". I feel I am comfortable with the term now after reading your latest reply and the other sources that I consulted.

  

One of the reasons for my confusion is due to drawing the attention to the matters related to Research Methodology.

  

If what I understood is right the scope of "Style Guides" is wider than that of the Texts on Research Methodology. While the later confines to only Theses and dissertations and even any research papers "Style Guides" cover all kinds of even general documents and other public linked writings.

  

Depending on the field and need of the writer the Style model also may vary such as:**[AAA](http://calstatela.libguides.com/aecontent.php?pid=409836&sid=3352565):**Anthropology,**[APA](http://calstatela.libguides.com/content.php?pid=409836&sid=3352567):**Business, Education, Psychology, and other Social Sciences,**[ASA](http://calstatela.libguides.com/content.php?pid=409836&sid=3353393):**Sociology,
[**Chicago**](http://calstatela.libguides.com/content.php?pid=409836&sid=3353438)(Documentary-Note Style): Literature, History, and the Arts,[**Chicago**](http://calstatela.libguides.com/content.php?pid=409836&sid=3353438)(Author-Date System): Physical, Natural, and Social Sciences

**[CSE](http://calstatela.libguides.com/content.php?pid=409836&sid=3353410):**Science,**[MLA](http://calstatela.libguides.com/content.php?pid=409836&sid=3353456):**Literature, Arts and the Humanities and**[Turabian](http://calstatela.libguides.com/content.php?pid=409836&sid=3353482):**History etc.

  

Now I think the Vyakhyana style of commentators like Mallinatha and the Vrittis of some Karikas my help us in the preparation of Style Guides in Sanskrit.

Soon I shall join you with some suitable examples from Ancient Texts which can be examined by you and other scholars to check whether they fit in the expected/required frame or not.

Once again thanks for enlightening.

Warmest Regards, 

**Prof. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
