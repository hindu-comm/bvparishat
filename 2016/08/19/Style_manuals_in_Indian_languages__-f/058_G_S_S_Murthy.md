Dear Prof. Surendramohan Mishraji,

Thanks for your elegant reply in poetry. I confess my inability to reply to you through Sanskrit Poetry. My attempt to compose in Sanskrit is laboured and torturous where as for you it is perhaps "like drinking water", if I may borrow a local phrase. 

As regards your comments on my suggestions, I can only say that my proposals are a first level attempt and they need to be refined.Rules will undoubtedly have exceptions.I was basically focused on Western Proper names.

Warm regards,

Murthy
