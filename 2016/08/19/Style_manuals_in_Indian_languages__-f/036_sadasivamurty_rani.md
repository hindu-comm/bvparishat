Here I would like to share some fresh thoughts on Style manuals from our Ancient Indian sources.

I. At the outset I would like to present here in the attachment of this mail some of the style manuals I possess in my personal collection.

I list them below:

1. Anusandhana Paddhati by Dr. Bhagiratha Prasad Tripathi published by Sampurnananda Granthamala, Varanasi

2. The ABC of Research for Behavioural and Social Sciences by VAnit Nalwa

3. Samskrit Sodhapravidhi by Dr. Satyanarayan Acharya

4. Thesis and Assignment Writing by Janathan Aderson, Berry H. Durston and Millicent Poole (This one of the most standard manuals on Thesis Writing)

5. Anusilana (Sahitya Vimarsha) - A Telugu Monograph by Vadali Mandesvara Rao

  

II. An attempt to Categorize the Style Manuals:

The style manuals as per my observations can be classified into the following heads:

A\) Manuals for writing Research Thesis and Dissertation Writings (All the above said five books belong to that category)

  

B\) Manuals for Creative Literary writing:

Creative Literary Writing Manuals in India are as old as Bharata;s Natya Sastra:

In the Early verses of the Sixth Chapter of Natya Sastra and in the subsequent chapters a detailed guide lines are given to follow while writing different literary writings.

  

Bhamaha follows Bharata and adds some details regarding the characteristic features of writing Itihasa, Purana, Gadya (Prose), Padya (Poetry) and Rupaka (Drama) and Champu etc. . 

  

Dandin in his Kavyadarsa faithfully follows his predecessors.

  

Some Alankarikas laid down rules related to Muktaka, Dvika, Trika, Sandanitaka, Kalapaka, Kosa etc.,

  

After him authors like Dhananjaya, Visvanatha, Vidyanatha and others laid down all principles and rules required to write 10 major types of dramas (Pradhana Rupakas) and 18 subtypes of dramas (Upa rupakas).

  

In my view all Ancient Indian Texts on Sahitya Sastra (which is also called Alankara Sastra) are Text manuals only.

  

C\) Manuals for Sastra style writing:

Though several Sastras are heard by Name only a few enjoy the right status of Sastras. They are : Vyakarana, Nyaya and Darsanas. The usually mentioned reason to call them Sastras is that they have : Sutra Granthas, Bhashya granthas and Vartikas Granthas also. Whichever discipline of knowledge has these three types of texts in its tradition it can be called a Sastra. So the scholars of relevant field distinguish between the characteristics of Sutra Texts, Bhashya Texts and Vartikas.

  

D\) Kavya Vyakhyanas:

In our traditional system the Vyakhyakaras like Mallinatha on Pancha Mahakavyas, Govinda Raja on Ramayana, Sridhara on Bhagavata and other such dealt with the process of commentating the Classical Literary Texts in a very systematic way giving all the details of Peculiar Vyakarana Prayogas, Alanakara Sastra Aspects, Aspects of Prosody, Aspects of all other disciplines of knowledge to the available extent. While quoting from different texts the commentators very faithfully give the reference of the authors, texts and other details of each author whomever they took in support of their views.

  

So the Vyakhyanas can also be taken as Style manuals to write Vyakhyana even of new Kavyas.

  

E\) Rgveda Bhashya Bhumika of Sayanacharya can be a manual to appreciate the style of the Vedas, Brahmanas, Aranyakas and Upanishads. .

  

These are a few thoughts related to various writing styles of different texts.



Hope this is of some use in the present context.

On BVP, we can share our own experiences of style (referencing etc. ) problems.
