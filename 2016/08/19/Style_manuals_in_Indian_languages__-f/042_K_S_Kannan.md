Vāmana's *Kāvyālaṅkāra-sūtra*, along with his own *Vṛtti* (auto-commentary)

contains some excellent ideas on style.

  

Somebody may take this compact work up for a detailed study

in comparison and contrast with modern guides/manuals of style.

A topic fit for PhD, or at least MPhil dissertation, perhaps.

  

The *doṣa-prakaraṇa*-s of Alaṅkāra texts also supply useful material.
