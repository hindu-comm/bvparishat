1\. For the most part, we should use the Chicago manual or some such international standard

  

 a. Not to reinvent the wheel

  

 b. for international portability

  

 c. for being part of the international standardization

  

2\. For a small part, we need our own methods because internationalization should not hurt our ethos,we need to compensate for the insufficiency of the international standards for the Indian approach to evidence, evidence preserving, evidence referencing etc. 

  

3\. The coinage of our translations for the terms in the international standard manuals should be taken up. During coinage, genius each Indian language should be kept in mind. For example, Tamil may not accept tatsama terms in a big number.

  

4\. Abbreviations for celebrated Indian books should also be standardized, so that each publisher does not need to provide aseparate key.

  

5\. We have to check with the CIIL work if they have already attended to the above mentioned needs.
