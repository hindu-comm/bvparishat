Dear Vidwan Sri Murthy,

  

These are the kind of issues, a style manual can help get standardized. Thanks for bringing this up.

  

Sometime back, there was a question about standardization of theborrowings fromEnglish into Sanskrit on BVP itself.

  

Scholars should come forward to participate.

  

Thanks.
