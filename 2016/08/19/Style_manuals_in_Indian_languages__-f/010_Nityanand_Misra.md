Thanks Professor Ji, but that post addresses only a small aspect (citation style for poetic works) and that too focussed on the RCM alone.

  

I did start writing a style manual for Hindi nearly two years ago. It is far from being complete and perfect (and I must add it is badly organized too) as I gave it up half way. I have uploaded the latest draft under the below link. I currently do not have any time to continue this work, but if somebody is working or interested, they may find it useful

I have an empty section on citation style (3.28) in this work-in-progress.
