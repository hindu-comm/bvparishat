B Radhakrishna (1985). *Telugu Akāḍami Bhāṣa-śaili Niyamāvaḷi*. Hyderabad: Telugu Akāḍami.

  

listed by Sri Nityanandji is a style manual for the government body publishing text books in Telugu medium.

  

Central Institute of Indian Languages, Mysore organized a workshop in 1999 , in the premises of Telugu Akademi, Hyderabad to prepare a style manual for research publications in Telugu, on the lines of MLA Style Sheet and Chicago Style Manual. The resource persons resolved that most of the rules of the Chicago Style Manual could be adopted as they are, except in the cases ofreferences such as the verse numbers from verse books, Sutra granthas etc.for which Chicago manual can not provide guidance.

  

The manual prepared during that workshop appears not to have seen the light of the day.
