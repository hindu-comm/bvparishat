Dear Prof.Nagaraj Paturiji,

I am thankful to you for sharing my poem and also sharing your generous comments on the poem in this thread.

As can be seen, I have used every possible way of referring to names of relevant scientists basically to meet metrical constraints of the poem and therefore it would be unwise to develop standards based on usages in the poem. In fact absence of any standards helped me!

However we could perhaps put down as Rule 1 that a proper name of a male ending in a Halant be treated as a masculine akaaraanta and declined as "Raama". Rule 2 that a proper name of a male ending in a vowel be declined as a paradigm Shabda ending in the same vowel. As for proper names of women I am not sure how they have to be declined. May be, use "varyaa" as suffix and decline as "Ramaa".

Scholars could discuss.

Warm regards,

Murthy
