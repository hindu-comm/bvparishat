Hope I have some content to share in this discussion on this topic.

1. The first book I had read soon I got my name registered for my Ph.D pursuit in the year 1981 was "Research and Innovation" by Anand Khaire which was then available in the Andhra University General Library. It was an excellent book I have ever read on research methodology. Some notes I took from it in those initial days of my research and that notes was my close companion for a few years then. Later I lost it during a rainy season and even the original text I could not trace in the general library of Andhra University. Ever since my search for that book has remained an endless hunt.

  

2. Besides this text the influence of the following authors has constantly been up on me till date. These are some of the great authors I ever adore.

1. Prof. C. Kunhun Raja, the first Indian professor in Sanskrit in Asia as I learnt from some sources (If I am wrong I may be corrected), whose style is lucid, simple, informative, compact and comprehensive. I studied (not merely reading) three of his writings:1. Survey of Sanskrit Literature, 2. Kalidasa and 3. The Vedas

  

2. Sri KM Munshi, the founder of Bharatiya Vidyabhavan, whose style is a wonderful example for Narrative flow. The Six books on Krishna Avatara, Jay Somanath, Prthvi Vallabh are some of the texts I read., Particularly Prthvi Vallabh is an illustrious Narrative known for tact dialog orientation and Jay Somanath is an excellent Novel in Descriptive style.

  

3. Dr. Sarvepally Radha Krishnan, Renowned Philosopher, Statesman, first Vice President and Second President of Free India whose style is known for a kind of **cohesion** and **Simple Sentences.** Usually we come across many authors who often shift from **Simple sentences** to Complex sentences or Compounding sentences with out any stability to confine to any one kind of sentence type. But Radhakrishnan was that conscious in using Simple sentences through out some of his articles from beginning to the end. Once he confines to Simple Sentences he never was found shifting either to Compound or Complex sentences. It is usually difficult too to maintain only Simple Sentences through out with out using Compound or Complex Sentences.

  

4. Swami Rama, the author of a good number of books on Indian Philosophy, Indian Culture and allied subjects, is popular for his style of frequent Darting Statements. His style is elegant, simple and highly communicative.

  

5. Prof. Nita Sarma's "Banabhatta - A Study" is known for its Sanskrit shades naturally adapted in an English writing.

  

6. Bertrand Russel style of high Logical Standards as found in his text "An Inquiry into Meaning and Truth" is a mark of excellence in style.

  

Of course there some more scholars whose writings I like but I would like to conclude here with a few thoughts from Ralph Whitman about style:

1. Style is Human.

  

2. Every human being has his\\her own way of expression. That way is his/her style. Hence it should be so natural and need not be added with any embellishments artificial flavors.

  

3\. Everybody writes for the sake of others. Hence it is acceptable to all if it is much much simple and lucid.

  

4\. Using rare phrases\\unknown idioms\\difficult words is not a mark of good style.

  

5\. Be simple. Be natural. Be clear in expression. You will become popular naturally.

  

These observations of mine can equally be applicable in case of Sanskrit writings also.

In the process of concluding this mail I request you all to find the attachment of this mail too on research methodology meant for private circulation by those who offered it online.  

Warm regards to all

**Prof. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
