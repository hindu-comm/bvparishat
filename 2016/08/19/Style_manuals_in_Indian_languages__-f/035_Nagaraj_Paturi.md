On BVP, we can share our own experiences of style (referencing etc. ) problems.

  

I will initiate by giving examples:

  

If I want to say, " Ganesha is alsodescribed as Vishnu in a verse शुक्लांबरधरं विष्णुं शशिवर्णं चतुर्बुजं । प्रसन्न्वदनं ध्यायेत्
सर्वविघ्नोपशान्तये ॥", how do I give the reference details for this verse? Currently prevalent options are: 'anonymous' , 'traditional' . Which of these two is better? Is there any better option?

  

My guru in the oral traditional Sanskrit teaching class said something during the teaching. I want to quote. How to go about doing this?

  

My guru in the oral traditional Sanskrit teaching class quoted from a book which is currently not in print. How do I give reference to this book? Do I list it in bibliography? If yes, how to go about doing this?

  

I quote from a lyric which is sung bymother but not available in print. The author is known from the mudra. How do I give reference to this lyric? If yes, how to go about doing this?
