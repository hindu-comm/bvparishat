Respected Prof. Nagaraj Paturi Ji,

Pranams!

  

Thanks for acknowledging the lines from my previous mails in this thread.

  

**While going through the chain of mails in this thread some doubts arise in my mind. I seek the help of either you or the other participating scholars, in getting answers for those doubts.**

  

Initially this was a thread on the "Style Manuals in Indian Languages". Slowly its concentration is turning towards the thought of standardizing the Style Manuals in Sanskrit.

  

When I observed the previous mails some scholars included Style Manuals related to the books of general category and some other scholars are confined to the books on research methodology.

  

In this connection I would like to present my reflections on this thread in two PARTS in this mail.

  

**PART I**

**Here is the list of some questions I am confronted by :**

1\. Is this a thread meant for searching for Style manuals on Research Methodology for writing Ph.D Theses or Research Dissertations in Sanskrit?

  

2\. Or is this a thread meant for preparing Style Manuals for writing general flow of books of Critical or Analytical study by nature in/on Sanskrit or Indology?

  

3\. Or is this a thread meant for searching or preparing Style Manuals for writing Creative Writing in Sanskrit such as : Maha Kavyas, Khanda Kavyas, Types of Gadya Kavyas (like Katha, Akhyayika, Parikatha, Sakala Katha etc ), Drsya Kavyas etc?

  

4.Or Is this a thread meant for searching or preparing Style Manuals for writing Sastras?

  

5\. Or is this a thread meant for searching or preparing Style Manuals for Modern Vyakhyana Methods in Sanskrit?

  

6\. Or is this a thread meant for **searching or preparing or standardizing** Style Manuals of all the above kinds related to Sanskrit or related to all Indian Languages?

  

These are a few questions in my mind on going through all these mails.

  

**PART II**

Here I would like to venture to give my analysis on questions 1 and 3 of the above list:

A\) If this thread concentrates up on the search or preparation of Style manuals related to Research Methodology of Sanskrit Ph.D theses or Research Dissertations my views go to this extent:

**i.** **There is no dearth of Texts on Research Methodology to help the world of Sanskrit Researchers felt either by Research Pursuers or their Guides or Theses Adjudicators.**

Hope the following observations may help to appreciate this statement:

a\) Almost a good number of Ph.D Theses and M.Phil Dissertations are produced in Sanskrit every year from different Universities or Higher learning institutions for adjudication.

I myself adjudicate nearly 5 to 6 Ph.D theses and 5 to 6 M.Phil dissertations every year on average.

Even under my guidance 20 Ph.D's and 25 M.Phil's have been produced in my career during the past 16 years.

  

b\) Every Adjudicator's report in this process begin with a Sentence:

"All the Principles of Research Methodology are Satisfactorily followed by the researcher in this thesis or dissertation".

  

This helps us to infer that all the Adjudicators or Research Guides or Researchers have adequate knowledge of Research Methodology required at least for writing Ph.D or M.Phil theses. In the absence of which the Universities would not have awarded the said titles to hundreds of researchers in our country particularly in the field of Sanskrit. 

  

ii\. As my observations extend there are a good number of Manuals available on Research Methodology essential for Sanskrit research in the market. In my previous mails I have given the the photos of the titles pages of Six books and I possess more than 50 Style Manuals of that kind in my personal collection both in Indian and foreign languages.  

  

This back ground may be taken into consideration by us if we want to still make an attempt to prepare a new manual on Research Methodology in Sanskrit.

  

B\) If this thread is meant for preparing a Style Manual(s) for creative writing in Sanskrit:

**All the Texts on Alankara Sastra from Bharata to Jagannatha, as I mentioned in my previous mails, are more than enough to guide us well as the most standard Style manuals.**

All these texts Categorize, Classify and give Characteristics of various types of creative literary writings such as : Muktaka, Dvika, Trika, Sandanitaka, Kalapaka, Kulaka, Kosha, Ashtaka, Taravali, Birudavali, Sataka, Khanda kavyas of larger volume, Mahakavyas, Gadyakavyas, Major types of Rupakas such : Nataka, Prakarana, Bana, Prahasana, Dima, Vyayoga, Samavakara, Vithi, Anka and Iha Mrga and the minor types of dramas or Upa Rupakas etc. 

  

These texts guide us in an appropriate manner to become good poets or authors in Sanskrit if we are willing to expose ourselves these texts in a proper manner.

As said by Prof. Kannan Ji the texts like Kavyaalankara Sutra Vritti of Vamana and the Knowledge of the Dosha Prakaranas in the Alankara Texts is very much essential for all aspirants to become good poets.

  

**C) Having answered two of my 6 questions I request the scholars to help me in clarifying the rest of my doubts.**

Warmest Regards,

**Prof. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
