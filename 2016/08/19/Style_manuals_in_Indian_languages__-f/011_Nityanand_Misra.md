While we are the topic of styling, I would like to share a parody I recently wrote on styling, inspired by Pink Floyd's “Wish you were here”. I hope the moderators will allow a little bit of humour on this topic.

  

Wish you could style

(Or, The proofreader’s agony)



So, so you think you can tell

“spelled” from “spelt”

Mars’s from Mars’.

Can you tell the en dash

from the long em dash?

Hyphen from a dash?

Do you think you can tell?



Did they get you to trade

your commas for colons?

Italics for bold?

Footnotes for all endnotes?

Soft hyphens for hard?

Did you exchange

a use of Oxford comma

for a saving of effort?



How I wish, how I wish you could style

We’re just two lost souls proofreadin’ book drafts

year after year,

Crossing over the same old flaws.

What have we found?

The same old bile.

Wish you could style.



Lyrics: Nityānanda Miśra

Inspiration:*Wish you were here*(Pink Floyd)
