Dear Vidwan Sri G S S Murthyji,

  

I am sharing here, your characteristically excellent Sanskrit poem विज्ञानसंस्कृतिः (Ode to Scientific Spirit)

  

In one of our offline conversations I said about this poem,

  

> 
> > "In the case of Vijnaanasamskritih ,there is an intense, powerful > and clear ideological tilt towards the pro-science angle of modernity. > Though there is one verse which betrays your awareness > ofenvironmentalism which brought in one of the most powerful > critiques of modernity and western tradition, your poem does not go > towards such critique and continues to be a eulogy of the achievements > of science. >
> 
> > 
> >   
> > 
> > 
> > Though I have very strong ideological opposition to such a pro-science > modernity, I am all admiration for your poetic skill and sincerity of > your conviction expressed through that skill." >
> 
> > 
> >   
> > 

(I also remarked during that conversation that

  

> 
> > 
> > One remarkable thing about all your poetry is its modernity. It stands > as a powerful counter example to the thesis of "Death of Sanskrit" by > Sheldon Pollock one of the main contentions of which is that Sanskrit > has not been used to express modernity.)
> >

In this poem, I noticed that you had to use several western names. Your lucid, juicy flow of Sanskrit helped blending all those names easily into Sanskrit.

  

Your experience may help us get some guidance with regard to what is a better way of adopting such names into Sanskrit.

  

Please make your suggestions.
