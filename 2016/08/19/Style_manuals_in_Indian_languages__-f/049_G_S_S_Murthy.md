Thanks Prof.Nagaraj Paturiji for your remarks that a standardization is called for while using proper names in Sanskrit writing. If we want to refer to a Mr. Griffith, do we decline the proper name like मरुत् or राम ? How do we decline the proper name of a Mrs. Griffith? The easy way out is to add वर्य/वर्या. But that does not seem to be an elegant solution.

Any Style Manual for Sanskrit that does not provide clear guidance in this matter is incomplete.

Regards,

Murthy
