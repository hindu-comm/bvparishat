Dear Sri Nagaraj Ji,

Regarding the training for our research students in the area of writing a Ph.D thesis or an M.Phil dissertation in our Vidyapeetha, there has been a long established tradition.

  

According to this tradition all the Ph.D and M.Phil students of all the Departments of all the Faculties of the Vidyapeetha are expected to under go a thorough training related to Thesis writing and MSS studies for six months conducted by **the Department of Research and Publications of Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha.**

  

Then **the Department of Research and Publications** holds examinations on Research Methodology, Manscriptology and Area wise study of the Research problem of the students.

  

Once the students are qualified in these examinations they will approach their respective guides having been declared eligible to take up their research pursuits and submit their theses in a minimum
stipulated period of two years there from.



  

So we being the guides of the students concentrate more on the subject areas of our students and regarding the research methodology and other technical aspects the guidance of the Department of Research and Publications is always available to the pursuants.

  

Even one month before the submission of the theses theris a doctoral committee meeting in which the Head of the Department of Research and Publications, the Dean of Faculty and the Concerned head of the department to examine the thesis and extend necessary suggestions to the students to improve their presentation techniques to the extent of maximum accuarcy and perfection.

  

The concentration of us, the guides, is normally more on the grammatical accuracy of sentences, logical sequence of the thought in the sentences, paragraphs, chapters and in the entire thesis, epitomization and conclusion techniques (chapter wise and in the entire thesis), agreement of the thoughts with the principles of the concerned Sastra and problem areas and other suc matters.

  

Regarding the Oral utterances of the Mantras or Kirtanas, if we have to deal with, we follow the universally accepted standard notation
techniques of the recitation those mantras and and kirtanas and present them through following permitted highlighting techniques available in the Research Methodology.
