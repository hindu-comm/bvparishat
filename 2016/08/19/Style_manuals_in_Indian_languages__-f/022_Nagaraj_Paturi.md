Dear Prof. Sadasivamurty Raniji,

  

I am sure there must be an extremely rigorous research methodology training in a Sanskrit Vidyapeeth. Given the marvellous background of rigorous logic of Sanskrit tradition in which all the teachers and even students are trained, there should be no doubt for anyone about that.

  

My questions were intended to obediently seek your guidance with regard to the thesis drafting issues, which are what are treated under style issues in style guides for research writings.

  

Dear Dr Gargeshwari,

  

Myobservation and experienceis that at many university departments, research reporting, dissertation writing methods are treated as part of courses on research methodology only. That is the reason why there was a mention of research methodology courses while discussing style guides. But by no means it was meant to diversify into the wider issues of research methodology.

  

Separate style guides for Sanskrit and other Indian languages are yet to be developed.

  

That is the reason why I thought gaining from the experience of veterans would be useful in this.

  

Thanks,

  

Regards,
