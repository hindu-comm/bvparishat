On GSS Murhty’s \< Any Style Manual for Sanskrit that does not provide clear guidance in this matter is incomplete. \>



It appears to me that this thread of discussion has many intricate points needing a large debate and research, a work in which I am deeply involved through Yoga-Samskrutham University. The issues are:



- 1. The Standardization approach and angle projected by
Professor Paturi is focused on \< Standardization = Shihsta –
Lekhana – Vyavahara> in \< Digital Media = Ganka yantra and WEB-Maadhyama \> which already is locked to conventions and constraints like use of \< specific set of fonts, page layout , user conventions on the liking of Chicago style Manual for English’. \>

It seems to be like telling ‘ Sri Rama would look more elegant and beautiful in a Three piece suit with a tie’. At this point, it becomes a way of compliance to ‘ Do as Romans do while at Rome’. These are more issues of peripheral presentation, formatting and convenience which will make the machines and programs work relatively better.



This does have a great value and utility in a limited context – like a scaffolding structure to build a permanent concrete structure.





- 2. The concept of Standardization in the Samskrutham Language Tradition in which connection we here a discipline called ‘ Lipi-Shaastra’ ( which seems to have gone underground in India for over five hundred years ?!) has two anchors :



First is standard of Ukta-Lekhana = Standard of Write as You Speak = True Speech to Text Transcription Convention , The True Equivalence connection of Voice and Script. This is absolutely lacking in Roman alphabet character set and English like language modeling.



Second is ‘Shuddha – Shihsta - Ucchrana’ : Standard Voiced Text / Uccharana as the anchor and bound by ‘ Vedanga – Vyakarana- Niyamas’.
This is absolutely lacking in English Roman alphabet character set and English like language. Here it is more of a backward compliance as a Swa-(Bhashaa) Dharma and compliance to ‘ As They ( = Poorvaacharyas) did their manuscripting. ( And not asking para-Bhashaa / Videsha –Bhashaa Dharma imposing on Sanskrit and forcing as they do it through
‘Chicago manual’. ).



It is here that any Standardization of Samskrutham for Scripting needs to be deliberated using the base of Vedas and Basics of ‘ Lipi-Shaastra’: Indian Language Standards of Voice Standards (Shikshaa) and Voice –Symbols ( ***Lipi as symbol of Varna***). 



Unless these are re-searched out as a ‘ Team Effort of Bharateeya Bhashaa –Shaastra- Vidwans’, any effort to force-fit Indian /Sanskrit Stylistics in the Digital space would be as good as ‘ substituting the
dress Sri Rama Parivar with Suit Or Jeans’ and calling it as ‘Standard’. 



Please Contact me off-line if this project interests any one.

Thanks Prof.Nagaraj Paturiji for your remarks that a standardization is called for while using proper names in Sanskrit writing.



If we want to refer to a Mr. Griffith, do we decline the proper name like मरुत् or राम ? How do we decline the proper name of a Mrs. Griffith? The easy way out is to add वर्य/वर्या. But that does not seem to be an elegant solution.

Any Style Manual for Sanskrit that does not provide clear guidance in this matter is incomplete.
