Thanks to for Prof. Paturi for having carefully searched the web and made available titles. Many books are often printed, An online search yields titles. But it becomes extremely difficult to procure them or to source them at libraries. How do scholars overcome this problem?

Regards

Unfortunately, information on how many of these (including the Telugu Style Manual to which I contributed) are available in actual print, how any are currently available to buy is not available.
