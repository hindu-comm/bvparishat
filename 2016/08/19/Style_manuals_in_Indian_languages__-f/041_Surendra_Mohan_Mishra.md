I remember how my teacher once dictated a verse by a Kolkata Pandit written to H H Wilson and it landed me in a confusion regarding the meter. The last quarter was: " साश्रु ब्रूते स भो भो*उइलसन* महाभाग मां रक्ष रक्ष //" I wrote Wilson as *विलसन* and it was one syllable short of the meter and I reported that the meter was not alright. I was told that in Bengali the name is pronounced as उइलसन and not विल्सन or विलसन as it happens in Hindi. I promptly got it corrected and knew that in different languages a proper name could be placed differently.

  

In the given context the notion of standardization should not overlook the natural or obvious:

  

1\. Gandhi could be simply गान्धी or गान्धिः and in prose writing particularly 'वर्य' 'महोदय' etc should be avoided to make it direct and more appealing. Even Nachiketas has two names in Kath. Up. - नचिकेताः and नचिकेतः।

२. जवाहरलालनेहरूः(रुः), जवाहरलालः, जवाहरः - this issufficient,the honorifics are to be considered as out of date. Samskrit is coming out of its ornate and reverential forms in to a direct approach style.

3\. In poetry writing differences are bound to occur, but nothing should border on the unnatural. Some proper names are altered a little to suit metrical exigencies.

4\. In olden times the रीति-s were working as style manuals. Till now much of them holds good. But modern manuals must be for modern times in the light of contemporary reality, need and keeping in with international standards.

5\. Samskrit has its style evolved over the centuries. We should not succumb to be blindly following or mimicking all that may be taking place in the west or fall a prey to the temptation of working with an imported style.Kalidas ought to be remembered:

पुराणमित्येव न साधु सर्वं न चापि काव्यं नवमित्यवद्यम्। 

सादरं

सु मो मिश्रः।
