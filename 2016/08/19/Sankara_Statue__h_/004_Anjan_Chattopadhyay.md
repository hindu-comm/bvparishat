I welcome the timely mail of Varakhedi ji.  
Kapil Kapoor Ji is a towering giant among intellectuals in our country and he being slighted should be of great pain to everyone in the BVP group.  
Ajit ji, please know who you are writing about. Anyone who spits at the sun will end up with spit on his face.
