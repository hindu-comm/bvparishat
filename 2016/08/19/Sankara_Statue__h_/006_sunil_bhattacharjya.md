I do appreciate Varakhediji's good advice, which should be be observed by all the list members. Yes. Kapil Kapoorji is a reputed scholar and if he gets time we expect active participation from people like him in some of the deliberations in the list. So many issues are yet to be addressed and the universities seem to be unable to address such problems. Producing PhD is important as part of imparting research training to promising young studnts, but one should keep in mind that getting PhD is the beginning of the research career and not the end of it. After getting PhD, one should be able to handle research in any area within one's broad field and at times even in a new field if the situation demands. Though I was involved in research in areas in science I took up the work on the Original Bhagavad Gita, as it received no attention from the great many Sanskrit scholars, we have in India. Another area is the date of the Mahabharata war, which is the real sheet-anchor of the ancient Indian history. This has not yetbeen solved in spite of so many people from different areas tried their hands on it. Another is the date of Adi Shankara, where different dates are floating around, inspite of some work being done by some people. These issues are yet to be solved.
