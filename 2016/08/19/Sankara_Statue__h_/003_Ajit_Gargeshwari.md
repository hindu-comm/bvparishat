“ ultaa alaap karte hain”You are probably the embodiment “sida Allap”. You are a great scholar and a lover of contraversies. There is nothing wrong is being controversial either. I never see you participating in any or answering students or scholars academic queries but do find time when there are controversies. I will go to China on a visit and you may Please build all the statues one needs here. Regards

It adorns many towns and or gas it ions all over India. Sri Ajit Gargeshwari always ultaa alaap karte hain.

He should visit China to understand the distinction between idea as idea and idea as idol on the involvement of perception, visual in this cs see, in this episteme.

My regards,
