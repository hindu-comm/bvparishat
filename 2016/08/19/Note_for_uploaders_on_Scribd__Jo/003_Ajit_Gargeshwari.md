Yes that’s because you might have uploaded materials under copy-write or scans which are not yours. For every upload you can download one document on scribd site.

I cannot do it anymore on my account(that is,uploading a book to download a book for free). Please check it for yourself.

I've been cut off from a vast source by this new policy.  
  
:(

Thanks for updating Scribd policy. Are you a part of scribd team? I am free member I can Upload and download from scribd site. Why are you posting this here. If you have out of copy-write material under you possession one can upload them anywhere. [archive.org](http://archive.org) is an old stable site.

Scribd has now changed its policy for free accounts to download,since August 11th. It basically does not allow them to download even if they upload free documents,requiring them to enter their credit card numbers for a 1 month free trial and charging $8.99 from then onwards.  
  
Uploaders to Scribd,please note.(and upload to [archive.org](http://archive.org) instead,that would be better for a lot of us please).
