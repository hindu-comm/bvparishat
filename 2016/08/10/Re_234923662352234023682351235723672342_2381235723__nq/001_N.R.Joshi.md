dear Dr Sadasiva Rani garu,

thankful for such a beautiful practical oriented article on Agnihotra
to reduce pollution and other calamities in the nature in the people and in the areas etc., where from the benefits are derived for the praniloka.

When Agnihotra is a frequent event that added to happiness.

this article is impressive and tempting.

The Havana samagri itself is a source for bringing the targeted and unknown benefit results.

We do saundaryalahari Homa every month and we find the effect is congenial to many who attend and to their families.

Sometime back this homa was done by a person with 108 dravyas in Bangalore and to attend and experience the benefit was amazing.It was for lokarpana.

there are forms or modes of havans taking the Agni as main subject. we have combinations of Agni worship like. Agnikarya, Agnihotra, Agnicayana Agnyadhana etc.

regards.

Dear Dr Sadashiva Murty Rani



\>\>\>

These are a few observations collected from various pursuits and practical studies on Agnihotra undertaken by some Indian and Western Scientists.





These studies and similar studies of this nature inspired Prof. Sai Gopal, Prof. Hussain and some other Scientists of the Atmospheric Department of Sri Venkateswara University to undertake further studies on Agnihotra.

\<\<\<\<



Please share any published literature that you may have on this subject.



Thx



Dr Yadu
