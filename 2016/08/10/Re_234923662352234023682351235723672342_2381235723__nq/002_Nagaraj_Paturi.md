Dear Dr Joshi,

  

Oh, it was all about the geography questions. These questions were posted by you earlier too.

  

In fact your answers are highly enlightening in this regard. I am a learner in those aspects.

  

It was the title of the post that lead to all the discussion on malevolence benevolence etc.

  

How I wish your sharp focussed in the first post.

  

In any case , glad to learn the geographical aspects.

  

Thanks

  

Regards,

  

Nagaraj

  

This is what I thought you were focussing on in the initiating post.

  

Since,
