Toward the end of the verse, words identifying the described person historically (in practical/vyavahāra terms) are absolutely necessary. Otherwise, the high-flying adjectives will have no substratum to stick to. Other verses praising gurus, scholars etc., if they are completely preserved, invariably contain a part in which the worldly specification of the intended person is given.

Emendation: Dayā-mādhava is a possibility. Dictionaries and indexes record such words as प्रचण्ड-माधव, ललित-, श्वेत-, वृन्द-, मागध-, जय-, विजय-, मत्स्य-, काल-, नील-, मूल-, in addition to couple names such as ललिता-, रमा-, राधा-माधव, विद्या-, and मालती-.  
  
(व्यवहार- is probably the title of a Dharma-śāstra text. I do not know how वेणि-/वेणी- came about.)
