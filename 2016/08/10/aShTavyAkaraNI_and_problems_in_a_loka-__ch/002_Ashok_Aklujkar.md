अष्ट-व्याकरणी is a dvigu compound, like trilokī, pañcamülī, etc.

  

अष्ट-व्याकरणी-निधानम् ‘one who was a repository of — one who has internalized, one who thoroughly knew/knows — eight grammars.

  

Several histories or surveys of Skt grammar give lists of eight grammars. Indra’s, Candra’s, Kāśakṛtsna’s, Āpiśali’s, Pāṇini’s, etc. As I recall, there is also an article on the various enumerations by V. Raghavan.

  

abhūt + harita would result in abhūddharita by normal sandhi rules.

  

What haritāmra-kairava-niśā-nātha is intended to mean is not clear to me as well. Probably Haritāmra ‘green/raw mango’ is a place name, more probably a sanskritized form of a place name, and the compound is expected to mean ‘Moon to the (white) lotus that (the village or town) Haritāmra is.

  

(Sanskritization of place names is sometimes done by imitating the sounds of the original name and sometimes by using a synonymous Skt word).

  

dasĪ is probably to be compounded with mādhavaḥ. It could be a non-Skt word prefixed to mādhava to distinguish the intended Mādhava from other Mādhavas or to make the name endearing. Experts of South Indian languages will probably be able to help in this area.
