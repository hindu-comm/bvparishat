नमो विद्वद्भ्यः!

  

Respected scholars,

  

in the concluding verses of a virtually unknown commentary on Kirātārjunīya (Kirātacandrikā by someone Pītāmbara) the author describes his genealogy.

In the very first verse he talks of his great-great-great-grandfather as अष्टव्याकरणीनिधानम् . Could anyone of the scholars help me out with this term?!?

  

The very same verse poses, in fact, several other problems. As far as I can read the MS, it reads:

न्यायाम्भोजरुहभास्करः कविवरः साहित्यविद्योदधिर्वाचोयुक्तिपराजितामरगुरुर्वेदान्तचिन्तामणिः।

अष्टव्याकरणीनिधानमनघोऽलंकारसारार्थविन्मिश्रोऽभूद् **?**-धरिताम्रकैरवनिशानाथो दसी माधवः-**?**।

As indicated by the question marks, the problems occur in the last pāda-. I suppose that Mādhava is the person's name. But what is dasī then?!? Similarly, the long compound “dharitāmrakairavaniśānātho" (? or should it be split it anywhere ?) doesn't make any sense to me. I'm aware of the element "kairavaniśānāthaḥ" and, perhaps, āmra- or tāmra- in front of it. But what to do with "dharita-".

  

I would be most thankful for any suggestions!!!

  

thank you very much in advance

  

सप्रणामम्

Andrey
