The context does not logically need it to be a practice.

If it was a common practice, the verse composer’s mention of ‘having knowledge of 8 vyākaraṇas’ would not amount to an expression of a distinctive/impressive achievement, and the context needs that a non-o achievement should be spoken of.

I have a vague recollection of similar praise being bestowed upon some other scholar, probably Hema-candra. If I lay my eyes/hands on it, I will mail it to you. Right now, my commitments allow time only for non-comprehensive responses in between other writings.

A good possibility. Probably better than the one I invoked.

As far as possible, we should follow the lead of the Mīmāṁsakas and not supply in philology for historical purposes whar is not readable into a composition even with lakṣaṇā.

  

Thanks and best wishes.
