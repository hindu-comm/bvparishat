**1.Thanks for the clarification offered on " AshTavyaakaraNii" in the context. But was it a practice in the past that some great minds learnt the eight s'aabdika-s ? Is there a parallel expression anywhere else ?**

**  
**

**2. As i hazard a guess, call it conjectural emendation, " दसी " is a corrupt form of " -दयो " arising from a simple scribal error because of kindred writing. Normally a scribe is " अक्षरचुञ्चु: "  and not " संस्कृतचुञ्चुः ".**

**  
**

**3. The word " हरिताम्र " could be " हरि + ताम्र ", adjectival to "kairava".  
**

**हरि may mean blue-yellow, green or yellow. ताम्र copper color. This amply describes a water lily. Prof. Aklujkar may be correct that this is a Sanskritized version of the village name and this fits with the nature of a lily. If the village of Madhav Mishra is located, it may be found out.**

**  
**

**4. Although the scholar is like the sun, he also acted like a moon to his remote hamlet which is like an innocent water lily !**

**After all the sun's light reflects thru the moon.**

**  
**

**5. Thus the verse would read:**

****

**न्यायाम्भोरुहभास्करः कविवरः साहित्यविद्योदधिर्-**

**वाचोयुक्तिपराजितामरगुरुर्वेदान्तचिन्तामणिः  /**

**अष्टव्याकरणीनिधानमनघोsलंकारसारार्थविन्**

**मिश्रोsभूद्धरिताम्रकैरवनिशानाथोदसी\[दयो ?\] माधवः //**
