Thanks Prof. Aklujkar for the critical reflection on the text of the verse. Indeed it may be दयामाधवः in place of -दयो माधवः।।. The text as reported by the scholar, shows a gap after - -निशानाथो, but after दसी also there is a gap. Considering that the ms. is in Bengali, for it to be read as -दयो, there has to be an एकार मात्रा before what is read as -सी, but as it appears there is no gap, warranting that it could not be -दयो but perhaps दया.But again there is a gap after दसी which raises doubt as to whether the author( or scribe ) had दयामाधवः as a compound in his mind. Mr Andrey may help us with a scanned copy of the ms. where this verse appears. That may make us more reliably attempt the emendation.

  

Since the days of the Bhaagavatam and Giitagovindam the word "Maadhava" has a special appeal. If the author is a Bengali, the possibility that it may be दयामाधवःis more pronounced. In Giitagovindam one more allusion is सुस्निग्धमाधव which names the 4th canto. But the orthographic evidence has to be correctly assumed. If it's not an autograph and a case of single-ms. evidence, then the accepted reading will have to be of limited certainty.

  

I fully agree with the fact that one should not indulge in the fault of श्रुतहानि - अश्रुतप्रसंग. But sometimes a little imagination seems to help. The editor is keen on the last quarter and he intends to derive some historical material out of it which he thinks as the practical need. That's how I tried a bit to connect it somehow basing on Prof. Aklujkar's guess that it could be the village of the author.

  

Regarding AshTavyaakaraNii Mr Andrey writes:

**2) अष्टव्याकरणी : Thanks to Prof. Aklujkar and Prof Kannan for explaining this issue. I was able to spot the verse in question "इन्द्रश्चन्द्रः...." in Vopadeva's Kavikalpadruma. It is the second verse there, in fact.**

**In the following verse (nr. 3) he says: मतानि तेषामलोक्य सर्वसाधारणः सफुटः। धातुपाठः स्वदाद्याद्यक्रमादन्तादिमक्रमः।। ३ ।। (स्वदाद्याद्यक्रमादन्तादिमक्रमः describes an arrangement within which the roots ending in a- come first : ad-ādima-kramaḥ, and within these roots, those roots which start with a- come first: ad-ādy-ādya-kramaḥ. And this all is very good: sv-\[ad-ādy-ādya-krama\]-ad-ādima-kramaḥ).**

**In any case, it appears that among non-Pāniṇīyan scholars it was more common to skim through all (or, at least, several) systems of grammar and thus become अष्टव्याकरणीनिधानम्**

**  
**

The eight systems of grammar also do include Paanini and that the non-Paninian scholars did the eight systems and were

अष्टव्याकरणीनिधानं is not justified. The Paninian scholars are often found with the view that after studying Panini no other system serves any need as Panini includes all that others attempt to bring about. Narayana Bhatta, in his अपाणिनीयप्रामाण्यसाधनं beginswith:

**पाणिन्युक्तं प्रमाणं न तुपुनरपरं चंद्रभोजादिशास्त्रं, केsप्याहुस्तल्लघिष्ठं न खलु बहुविदामस्ति निर्मूलवाक्यम् /**

**बह्वङ्गीकारभेदो भवति गुणवशात् पाणिनेः प्राक्कथं वा ?, पूर्वोक्तिं पाणिनिश्चाप्यनुवदति, विरोधेsपि कल्प्यो विकल्पः //** 

He furtherquotes a line from the Mahabhaarata " दृष्ट्वा बहु व्याकरणं " - that Vyaasa himself read through a lot of grammar or studied a number of grammar texts before embarking upon writing the epic. This suggests that treatises on grammar are like attesting authorities and by a study of those one has more options in respect of diction and semantic nuances.

  

Narayana quotesa verse: **अष्टादश पुराणानि नव व्याकरणानि च /**

**                  निर्मथ्य चतुरो वेदान्मुनिना भारतं कृतम् //**

Now we have scope for a नवव्याकरणीनिधानं ! Someone may kindly tell us regarding those nine systems.
