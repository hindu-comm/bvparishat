My heartfelt thanks to scholars, who have contributed to this discussion so far!!!

  

1\) अम्भोरुह° : Prof. Surendra is absolutely right about the °ज-part. The blame shouldn't go to the scribe though, who generally does a very good job in this MS, but to me: it's nothing but MY typo, for which I'm sorry

  

2\) अष्टव्याकरणी : Thanks to Prof. Aklujkar and Prof Kannan for explaining this issue. I was able to spot the verse in question "इन्द्रश्चन्द्रः...." in Vopadeva's Kavikalpadruma. It is the second verse there, in fact.

In the following verse (nr. 3) he says: मतानि तेषामलोक्य सर्वसाधारणः सफुटः। धातुपाठः स्वदाद्याद्यक्रमादन्तादिमक्रमः।। ३ ।। (स्वदाद्याद्यक्रमादन्तादिमक्रमः describes an arrangement within which the roots ending in a- come first : ad-ādima-kramaḥ, and within these roots, those roots which start with a- come first: ad-ādy-ādya-kramaḥ. And this all is very good: sv-\[ad-ādy-ādya-krama\]-ad-ādima-kramaḥ).

In any case, it appears that among non-Pāniṇīyan scholars it was more common to skim through all (or, at least, several) systems of grammar and thus become अष्टव्याकरणीनिधानम्

  

3\) as for the last compound. **हरि**ताम्रकेरवनाथः is obvious, but, as Prof. Aklujkar stated, difficult to interpret.

What is puzzling about this is that, in accordance to the previous viśeṣaṇa-s, this one should possibly also refer to some "concrete" excellence of Mādhava (like being the Sun for the Lotus of Nyāya etc.) I wonder if any scholar could come up with an interpretation/ emendation along these lines  

  

4\) दसी : Our author is, actually, a Bengali. Could this be of any relevance?

Prof. Surendra's emendation is appealing, I can see very well how सी may become यो , but (1) the problem of a slight inconsistency of meaning (see 3) remains and (2) the scribe of this MS is actually rather good (doing pretty well in transmitting pratyaya-s with the right anubandha-s). So that I am still a bit doubtful.

  

thanks a lot once again,

  

Andrey
