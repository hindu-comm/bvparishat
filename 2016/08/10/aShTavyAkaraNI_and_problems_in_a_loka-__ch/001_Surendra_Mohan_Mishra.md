In the first quarter it should read न्यायाम्भोरुहभास्करः, the letter 'ja' is redundant. अम्भोज and अम्भोरुह have the same meaning. the scribe has been influenced by that similarity and has lost on the metre, in this case Sharduulavikriiditam and meaning aspect.

  

In the final quarter could it be मिश्रोभूत् + हरिताम्रकैरव....../

  

दसी may be a corrupt form of some word intended in the context.
