Look in the index of names of in Mahabharata, if you are sure it is in Mahabharata:

<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/INMScan/2013/web/index.php>

As I know the story occurs in Chāndogya Brahmana:

**Satya-kāma**(‘lover of truth’)**Jābāla**(‘descendant of  
**Jabālā**) is the name of a teacher, the son of a slave girl by an  
unknown father. He was initiated as a**Brahmacārin,**or  
religious student, by**Gautama** **Hāridrumata**according to the  
Chāndogya Upaniṣad. \[Footnote: 1) iv. 4, 1,*et seq.*\]
