Sri Sunil varya,

  

Based on my cursory glance on various *"vāstu-vidyā-paddhati"* that are available, it appears that there could be 6 distinct styles of *"vāstu-śāstra" *based on thetexts found so far (there could be more - if we include "Himalaya" style constructions in Kashmir, Himachala Pradesh, etc.). However the fundamental principles remain the same. Also due to larger factors of "*deśādhikaraṇam*" such as "*jambūdvīpa* / *bhāratavarśa*" etc. determine the larger architectural aspects applicable for Bharatam. Also during my research on "*vr̥kṣāyurveda*"
literature survey I came across many unpublished manuscripts on*"vāstu-śāstra"*

  

a). Books in English

An Encyclopedia of Hindu Architecture, Oxford University Press, by
Acharya P.K. (1946)

Indian Architectural Theory: Contemporary Uses of Vastu Vidya, Psychology press, by Vibhuti Chakrabarti (1998)

Indian architecture: Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain. New Delhi: Prakash Books, by Sahai and Surendra, (2006)

Town Planning in Ancient India By Dr. Binode Behari Dutt  

  

b). Source books in Samskritam (general ones - published):

1*. "br̥hat saṁhitā"* (sections on township planning)

2*. "samarāṇgaṇasūtradhārā"* (Township planning - Bhopal (Bhojapala nagaram) city is based on this)

3\. "*rājavallabhā*" 

4\. "*viśvakarmaprakāśa*" 

5. "*aparājitapr̥ccha*"

  

c). Orissa style (eastern style):

1*. "gaṇitakasārakaumudī"*

2\. "śilpaprakāśa"

3. "*vāstusūtropanişad*" The Essence of Form in Sacred Art, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, by Alice Boner, Sadasiva Rath Sharma, Bettina Bäumer (1996)

4\. "*kālatatvakośa*" 3 volumes, IGNCA - Dr. Sadasiva Rath Sharma

  

  

d). Tamil nadu style:  

1\. Vishvakarma vastu sastra

2\. Manai-adi saasthiram (in Tamil - books are not available nowadays)

3\. Books by Dr. Ganapathy Sthapati (pl. check with Tamil NaduSchool of Architecture and Sculpture at Mamallapuram, near Chennai)

  

e). Kerala style:

As taught in "Vasthuvidya Gurukulam" (Kerala Govt. College & accredited Diploma courses on Traditional architecture), Aranmula. The books are in Malayalam, few centuries back itself, the Samskritam books are translated and /or localized or further evolved specific to the geography and further methods evolved.



1\. Vasthuvidya,

2\. Mayamatham,

3\. Manasaram,

4\. Thanthrasamuchayam,

5\. Silpiratnam,

6\. Manushyalyachandrika

  

Note: 1000s of Churches, 3 Mosques and many Bungalows were designed by the students of this college as per the Institute Website

  

f). Other texts

  

1\. *"pratiṣṭhā-lakṣaṇa-sāra-samucchayā"*

  

  

\- The most referred books in Kerala for *"doṣa parihāra"* are "*manuṣyālayacandrikā*" and "*vāstuvidyā*" - however traditional Vastu paNdita needs to be consulted - who could guide on specific "karma"

  

So depending on which region you belong, you need to consult experts accordingly

  

Regards

Krishnamurthi
