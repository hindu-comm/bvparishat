Dear Ramchanderji,  
  

Thank you for your mail. What you referred to was the puja done by Lord Rama at the time of the grihapravesha of his parna-kutira. These days one has to do the ceremony for grhapravesha with the required pujas, albeit in a different and in a vegetarian way than what Lord Rama did in the Chitrakuta. The killing of antelope is not relevant for us and it is also against the law of the land to kill an atelope and moreover the antelope is not that available. In fact we also have to do vastu puja at the time of starting the construction work for the house, which probably was not required for the parna-kutira. Otherwise the sage Valmiki would have mentioned that too.  
  

Yours  

SB
