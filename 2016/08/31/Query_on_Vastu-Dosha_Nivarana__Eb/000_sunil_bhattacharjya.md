Dear scholar friends,  
  

There are some specific requirements to be met while designing a new house for construction. For example, the kitchen has to be in the Agni-kona. Many believe that this stipulation is good for the most parts of India as the smoke from the kitchen naturally escapes, thus preventing the smoke from entering any other room in the house.  
  

Secondly, to my knowledge, it is also believed that if the plot for the house is such that many vastu-doshas are inevitable, one is advised to build a stilted-house to get rid of most of the vastu-doshas.  
  

My query, is that what does the ancient vastu shastra say on the above and what are the relevant verses.  
  

Regards,
