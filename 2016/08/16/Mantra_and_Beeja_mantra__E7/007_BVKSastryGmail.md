Namaste



The Samskruth word ‘Artha’ has multiple meanings in the technical concept of Yoga. The appropriate meaning needs to be applied in understanding the Yoga-Sutra under discussion. As Professor Korada aptly commented \< Feel free - this is an ocean .>



**Meanings of word ‘Tat’ and ‘Artha’**:



‘Tat’, occurs two times in the sutra. Once as an independent pointer; Second as a pointer inside a compound.

Artha – Meaning as in ‘ Word –Meaning’ where Meaning is listed in the dictionary and known in worldly usage (Vyavahara)



**Sutra -Meaning : Complexity and Diversity**



Based on this, the understanding of the sutra needs to go beyond the simplistic reading –translations.



The explanation beyond Translation of the Sutra would be more meaningful and purposive for contemplation, aligned to the tradition, if it is understood in parts and whole, as part assembly and total final expression. We had a similar discussion on a different thread about how Gayatri mantra is taught in sections of one line, half and full modes. This model of analysis is called ‘Yoga-Vibhaga’ in the grammar technicality of understanding the ‘Sutra’.



Why do we have to resort to this technical model of analysis ? **Because ‘Sutra’ is not a straight sentence of usage. It is a ‘Technical Formula- Which Generates ( Sooh – Praani prasavae) + and ‘ Guards its internal consistency (= Root – Traing Paalane) + and ‘Sutra’- Which binds end to end and supports like string sustaining the continuity of garland and yet supporting the pearls which it strings through’. **



- ‘ That **(= Tat)** is JAPA **( =Japah**)’. The connection of **‘Tat’** in the schema of Yoga-Sutra needs to be understood by the teaching tradition.



- ‘Japa ( = Japah) is defined technically as ‘ **Tat-Artha-Bhaavanam’**. ‘That – Artha-Bhavanam’ . It is a three part technical compound where the meaning of each component needs to be learnt from ‘Teaching –Practicing Tradition’.



To what does the Second ‘ Tat’ refer to – inside the Sutra and in the context of the chapter and the entire text ? What is Artha-bhavanam ?
-where ‘Artha’ can be (i) ‘ Literal, Designated or Derived Meaning , (ii) Purpose ,(iii) Wealth (= Sampath), (iv) instrument of exploration (= Saadhana)’. **Seeking (Artha) will have to have a Purpose, enough to motivate the seeker. Saying needs to have a meaning (Artha) for communication, which must outreach and be understandable by the listener-recipient**. In Seeking, ARTHA runs by Purpose and Design.
In Saying , ARTHA runs by convention. IF ‘Yoga’ is ‘ an internal seeking of what is inside, different from saying it out, then there is no need to deliberate on the ‘ worldly meaning’ which needs a dictionary or ‘ lexical explanation’. In this sense, ‘ Japa’ has no (Worldly)
meaning.



For the quote from Sahunaka on \< mantraartha- mantra chaitanya>, it is an inner seeking and use of words in a ‘ JAPA’ yoga mode for awakening the ‘ seeing – engagement with inner energy’. For this purpose, the seeker needs to have a grasp of the purpose; and not the worldly meaning of the ‘ vocabulary used’. But if the same ‘Mantra-Japa’ is being used for \< pedagogy of training a Yogi>, then the teacher has to understand the design and purpose . The teacher cannot take shelter under the ‘ I don’t know Artha’ excuse, as ‘ Artha is not needed’. It is a different context and a responsibility. First one is application. Later one is design-training.



- The word ‘Bhaavanam’ coming from the root ‘ Bhoo –Sattaayaam’ after a number of technical processes carries its own flavors and layers of meaning.



- **With this, the total purport ( =Taatparya-Artha) of Given Patanjali Sutra will yield several meaningful instructions ( = anushaasanam) that defines and dictates the practice of ‘ Japa’ ; and ‘ Japa’ is just one of the many technicalities of Yoga ! Therefore , JAPA **needs further contextualized customized instruction in different lanes of Yoga. For example the usage – ‘ Japa-Tapa’ where Japa is a lead to Tapas, the practice of ‘ Japa’ will have different instructions compared to ‘ mantra-japa’ or ‘ japa- homa-tarpana’ where a different instruction and practice comes in to operation .



**In short, if ‘Yoga-Sutras’ used the vocabulary of Samskrutham, it would be logical to expect a pedagogic decoding of the Sutra using the Yoga-Technicality of Samskruth Language.**

The Yoga-Technicality of Samskruth Language comes as a study tradition of Samskrutham, in the frame of ‘ Vak-Yoga’- The Yoga way of Studying and Applying Samskrutham for practice i.e.**vinoyoga of Samskrutham**.



This ‘Vak-Yoga’ pedagogy of Samskrutham, is foundational to all formats of Samskruth usage – be it Vedic (=Chandas), literary ( = Kaavya) , Conversational (= Vyavahara Saamajika Bhashaa). This may be understood as a ‘ Proto- Samskrutham’ postulate of Tradition; which differs from the ‘Proto-Concept of Social historic Languages’ championed by the modern linguists. 

The Scholars applying \< Social –usage of language model featuring
deterioration and degradation of language by social usage \> to do the postmortem of ‘ languages covered by the grammar of Panini’ postulate that Prakrits are the mother of Sanskrit, through a process of ‘ social class intentional constructions for suppression and oppression of masses’. **The PIE theory emerges as the blue eyed boys wearing suits in university as the linguistic theory on Sanskrit (Paniniyan literary artificial language) which is post Vedic (Chandas) language .**



The Scholars applying \< Spiritual –usage of language model featuring refinement (= Samskara) and up gradation of language ( to uplift human speech to Divine :: Maanushee to Daivee) by VINI-YOGA = Applied usage \> to perform the TAPAS - YAJNA – MANTRA –JAPA of
using languages covered by the grammar of Panini’ postulate that
Prakrits are grand children of Samskrutham , through a process of ‘ Yoga intentional constructions for universal welfare and unfolding the sacred potential of all Humans ’. **The ‘ Yoga-Samskrutham /
Vak-Yoga’ theory surfaces from the ‘ Vaidika’s wearing tuft and thread , sagging skin and eye-brow scholars, half-naked teachers at the guru-kuls, as the linguistic theory on Sanskrit (Bhashaa), which is covered as a 40% part of Vedanga Samskrutha- Vyakaranam (leaving rest 60% to Praatishaakhyas and other five technical disciplines) .**
