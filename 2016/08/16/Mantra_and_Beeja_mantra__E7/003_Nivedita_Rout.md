Namaste!

  

The form of Bija-mantra of Tantric tradition is originated from the stobhas of the Samaveda.

  

Articles in The book called "Understanding of Mantras" which is a collection of articles on on understanding of Mantras are useful in this context. Specially of Frits Staal's Vedic Mantras though the author has expressed the stobhas are meaningless syllables!
