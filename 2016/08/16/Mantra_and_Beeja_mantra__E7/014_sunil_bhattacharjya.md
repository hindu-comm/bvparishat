Namaste,  
  

Quote

  
So we get the following relation:  
शब्द \~ length  
वाक्य \~ area  
अनुच्छेद (para) \~ volume  

Unquote  
  

May it is better this way:  
  
शब्द \~ rooted, but has multidirectional potency  
वाक्य \~ gives direction  
अनुच्छेद (para) \~ gives details / explanation  

  

Regards,  
skb
