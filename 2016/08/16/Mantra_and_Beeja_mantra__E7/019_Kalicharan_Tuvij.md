श्रद्धेय SMM-ji & SB-ji,

  

Thank you for the comments.

  

Re: शब्द \~ curve

  

The equivalence शब्द \~ curve is more than useful; just as a curve is a progression of points through space-time, शब्द likewise is a progression of वर्णs through linguistic space-time. There are implications.

  

शब्द, therefore, carries the stamp of the linguistic space-time. This principle was used by Shrikant Talageri in demonstrating the posterity of Avesta vis-à-vis RgVeda, with the added assumption that there is a strong correlation between the linguistic space-time and the historical space-time. He, in my opinion, is therefore one of the most important Vaidika scholars of our times; 'Vaidika', since he underpinned the importance of the परिमाण of शब्द (to good use within the context of his historical linguistics), the शब्द that is Veda.

  

Sanskrit is देवभाषा since it consciously, and separately, brings out various परिमाणs - belonging to the अक्षर, शब्द, वाक्य & काव्य levels - in their respective, carefully earmarked, places. The world later came to know these "places" as Veda, Upanishads, Puranas, etc.

  

The परिमाण rule, more than anything else, throws light upon the art of reading Sanskrit texts. For example, there was a query earlier on BVP (by Sh. Sudip Halder):

  

"The fire-ordeal of Sita in the Valmiki Ramayana is it an interpolation?"

  

Answer: no, it is not interpolation. The परिमाण of रामायण is designed to be measured at the "volume level". This can be confusing, especially to scholars who are accustomed to measuring the परिमाण at the वाक्य level, if not at the शब्द level.

  

This means, in रामायण the परिमाण isn't at the शब्द or the वाक्य. "Fire-ordeal" measures out, at the काव्य level into "some kind of test of trust" be it "walking on burning coal" or something else, doesn't matter.

  

As long as the volume level परिमाण is maintained it is alright. A seer, like Tulsidas, measures, writes down a genuine रामायण, all once again.

  

Another (a little more tricky) example:

In Valmiki Ramayana, Sita is explicitly said to be Shri Lakshmi's manifestation. However, the परिमाण from the very same Ramayana reveals her to be the manifestation of (the very best of) the भू देवीs.

  

परिमाण is specific to Sanskrit, because among mortal texts and mortal languages-

either the परिमाण is all mixed up,

or there is no परिमाण at all.

  

The परिमाण is a consciously acknowledged principle of Sanskrit, and therefore is not anything new at all, as evidenced by a lot of parallels, documented and discussed in parts in specific commentaries, e.g. on speech-generation by भर्तृहरि, on dhvani-parimANas by आनन्दवर्धन, and so on and on.
