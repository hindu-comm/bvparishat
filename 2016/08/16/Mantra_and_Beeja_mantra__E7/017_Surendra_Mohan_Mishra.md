नमांसि। अनुगृहीतो'स्मि आचार्यनागराजवर्यैः।

  

As I know this is the obvious view of the Grammarians. What I wrote was my reaction to the posting on 'parimaana'. Something of the Nyaya tradition was also in my mind relating to 'savikalpaka' and 'nirvikalpaka'. The logicians are of the view that knowledge precedes verbalization.

  

In Grammar as I understand up to Pas'yantii all is invariably S'abda/Vaak. 'Eko nimittam s'abdaanaam' - here the 'nimitta' = 'sphota' is again 's'abda' and not 'as'abda' ! One can call it 'as'abda' only in relation to the articulated word 'vaikharii'. Again 'sphota' is associated with 'madhyama' and not with 'pas'yantii' !   

  

Nagesha admits Paraa Vaak as the foundation. S'abda Brahma- the eternal verbum refers to 'sphota' which is an outcome of 'madhyamaa vaak'. I may kindly be enlightened. Regards. SMM
