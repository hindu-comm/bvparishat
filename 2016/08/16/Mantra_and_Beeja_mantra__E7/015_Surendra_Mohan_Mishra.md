Great synthesis indeed !

  

शब्दः - वाक़्यं - महावाक्यं - ग्रन्थः

  

The beginning ought to be अशब्दः the position of दक्षिणामूर्ति and his illustrious disciples.

  

The normal Grammarian's view ' न सो'स्ति प्रत्ययो लोके ' has to be reconsidered. I am told that Pandit Rameshwar Jha of Kashi held such a view regarding निर्विकल्पक state before emergence of word, within the grammatical thinking. Scholars can shed more light on this. Regards.
