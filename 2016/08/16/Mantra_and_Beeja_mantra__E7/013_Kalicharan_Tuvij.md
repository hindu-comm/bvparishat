नमस्ते ।  
  
PART 1  
###########  
  
Recently I wrote about what I called the "परिमाण" thumb rule of Sanskrit, that is,  
Word of Veda = Sentence of Upanishads = para of Puranas  
  
What was meant by परिमाण here?  
Measure. Invariant. Intent. Meaning.  
  
That is, a शब्द in Veda has the परिमाण, a sentence in Upanishads has the परिमाण, and a para of Purana has the परिमाण. परिमाण is an invariant quantity, just like energy in physics (more on this to follow).  
  
Not long ago I had mentioned the following equivalence relation observed in Sanskrit:  
word \~ curve  
sentence \~ surface  
para \~ volume  
  
Now, as we know,  
Curve's परिमाण is known as: length  
Surface's परिमाण similarly is area  
Volume's परिमाण obviously is volume.  
  
So we get the following relation:  
शब्द \~ length  
वाक्य \~ area  
अनुच्छेद (para) \~ volume  
  
PART 2  
###########  
  
This isn't finished yet. I had also mentioned:  
Phoneme (वर्ण) \~ point  
  
The inevitable question is, then,  
What is the परिमाण of point?  
Answer: देवता.  
  
What is देवता?  
देवता simply is.  
  
As an example, let us consider the following analogies (meant purely as an illustration):  
  
Worldly people need the full context of paragraph to grasp the परिमाण, whereas intelligent ones only need a carefully conveyed sentence, sutra, or even a formula.  
  
And then the truly spiritual ones only need the correct address, the शब्द (शब्द \~ curve \~ a path, as I had mentioned earlier).  
The realised one, simply, sees and knows - no need for even the address or the path.  
  
A close example is from the narrow field of material science where Physicists (भगशास्त्रीs) have been exhibiting the same pattern in the last century. In their standard procedures, an entity is first simply declared, as in, "let us know it as Φ", etc. For example, "let us know electromagnetism as Φ at this point", or "electron is Φ at this point"' etc.  
  
And then the other परिमाणs of the Φ are calculated: the length one, the area one, and the volume one. With the progressive observance of each परिमाण, our Φ come closer to the observed mundane reality around us.  
  
PART 3 (concluding)  
###########  
  
In my thread "Specifics of संस्कृत वर्णमाला" in BVP, the unusual pattern of the संस्कृत वर्णमाला was shown to have daivika generators.  
  
That is, each संस्कृत वर्ण was considered a direct invocation (knowingly/ unknowingly) of some देवता, and therefore could be correctly called बीज/ाक्षर मन्त्र; the देवता him/herself being the परिमाण of the वर्ण or "अक्षर".  
  
  
  
Thank you.
