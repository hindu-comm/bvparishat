This was once well discussed topic in BVP. The same members who so far
have participated in the present discussion had participated that time also. (My answer can be seen Ref.On Tuesday, 10 June 2014 7:59 AM, )

The Six Namah, Svasti, Svaaha, Svadhaa, Vashat and Vaushat are called Mantra Pallavas in the Mantra Sastra. These are suffixed at the end of the Mantra for attaining different results from the Japa Vidhi.  

  

"Namah" is a pallava used just to offer salutation to the God or Goddess being worshiped with that Mantra.

"Svasti" is suffixed for while aspiring peace through that Mantra.

"Svaaha" is a pallava used while offering Ghee or any other oblations to the Sacrificial Fire.

"Svadha" is always used in the Pitru Karmas while offering to Visvedevas.

"Vashat" and "Vaushat" are used while offering oblations in Yajna intending to certain Gods.

  

Besides these there is another PALLAVA or PRATYAYA which is used as a Maraka Pratyaya (A Pallava used intending to kill a person through reciting a particular Mantra with this Pallava). That Pallava is "PHAT".

The purpose of these Mantra Pallavas can be known with more details from Mantra Sastra granthas.
