Respected scholars, Namaskar!



We always hear about Beeja mantras.

In what way Beeja mantra is different from mantra?

Is Beeja mantra embedded in a mantra?

Can beeja mantra be a VarNa, a syllable or more than one syllable?

Who invented Beeja mantras from a given Stotra like Saptashati. This is one example I am quoting.

Do Beeja mantras have meanings? Thanks in advance. N.R.Joshi
