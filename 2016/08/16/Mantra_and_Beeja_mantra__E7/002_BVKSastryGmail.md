Namaste



1. Beeja-Mantra, is a word where the word ‘beeja’ is qualifying the following word ‘Mantra’. Thus ‘ beeja-mantra’ is a special advanced category of ‘Mantra’.



2. Beeja-Mantra , as a special advanced category of ‘Mantra’ may or may not carry the ‘embedding’ approach !



3. ‘Beeja-Mantra’ can be a \< a VarNa, a syllable or more than one syllable \> depending upon the ‘Teaching of Mantra-Yoga as a Custom instruction’ ( = ‘Upadesha’ which covers the sounds instruction and method of using it as ‘ upaasanaa’. Example : ‘ Gam’ is the suggested beeja-mantra for ‘Ganesha- Mantra’.



These are not text material, printed as public material to be circulated
on cyber space. Neither are they ‘ mumbo jumbo gullible saffron –cloth wrapped mystic’. These are ‘ Science of Mystic exploring the ‘ relation between Thought and Word :: The way Consciousness functions and directionally flows from abstract to a concrete, as a part of conscious human intention and action (Vivakshitaartha vachana).



And for the immediate next question that you may shoot : How does Beeja-mantra and Mantra differ from ordinary speech? And should this only be Sanskrit ? - Unless one learns and practices per initiation the ‘ Yoga way of learning-practicing Samskrutham: The Vak-Yoga, which is the Vedic expression for Samskrutham, it is difficult to explain further. Unless one gets inducted to this area of ‘Sacred Spiritual Linguistics = Vedanga Vyakarana Paddhati, the yoga-specific meaning of words : - Swaadhyaya ( badly translated as Scripture studies ), Mantra (badly translated as sounds of mystic nature ), Japa (badly translated as muttering sounds and names with a rosary bead count )
Paaraayna (badly translated as scripture-reading ), Praarthanaa (badly translated as - wishful prayer request ) Archanaa (badly translated as – faith worship ) Poojaa (badly translated as external mode of worship with counted names muttering – Ashtottara ,Sahasranaama poojaa ) .
The bad translation has lead to ‘ infructuous practice benefits and incorrect debate on these Yoga-Words of Samskrutham.



4. And on \< Who invented Beeja mantras from a given Stotra like Saptashati. \> The process of ‘Beeja-Mantra’ visioning ( = Mantra-Darshana) is not called ‘ invention or discovery’ in the language of material science. The process is called ‘Darshana’- Visioning, like a scientist who could ‘vision-postulate an atom , while studying the tangible matter’. Stotras come up as ‘Mantra –Beeja mantra –packaged for safe practice’. The ‘Mantras ( and beeja-mantras’) are personal experiential vision of Natures reality through the practice of appropriate Yoga. Would they be hallucinating of sounds ? Well, Try it out.



The ‘ exit of academic studies of Documents and Traditions of Samskrutham ’ from this ‘Yoga-path aka ‘Vedangataa’ – is the point of divergence between the ‘Traditional schools and Modern academicians.
Modern academicians mount the ‘ lens of Human history and Comparative Religion – Scripture – Faith Practice’ over the traditional approach of
‘ Darshana – Mantra – Yajna –Yoga - Itihaasa –Puraana – Rishi -Devataa’ model for study –interpretation and practice of ‘VEDA’.
