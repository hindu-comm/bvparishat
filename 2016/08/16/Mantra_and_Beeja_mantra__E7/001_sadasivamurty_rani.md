A mantra has many explanations as found in different traditions.

**1. Vedic Tradition:**

All compositions in the Veda Samhitas may be a Rk or Saman or Yajus is called a Mantra. (The statement "*Mantra brahmanatmakasya Veda namadheyah*" and "*mantra brahmanatmako vedah*" supports this view). Some Vedic Mantras (Rks and Yajus) are chanted and some others (Samans) are sung. In case of Rks and Yajus .. "*mananaat trayate it mantrah*"is considered. In case of Samans since it is sung being composed in Gayatri and other metres .. the definition of Gayatri says: "*gataram trayate yasmaat gayatrii tena saa smrtaa*"

  

**2. In Tantra and Agama Tradition:**

a\) A mantra can be in any of the following forms:

**I. Bija Mantra**

  Bija mantras are of many types again:

  i. Monosyllabic - This monosyllabic is constituted in different ways:

   \* One consonant+a vowel

   \* One Consonant+ a vowel+ one consonant

   \* Two are more (Even 10 consonants as a cluster) + Only one vowel at the end and so on.

ii\. Multi syllabic

  

**II) Bija+Nama Mantra**

  Bija+ Nama Mantra begins with one or more bija varnas + the name of deity often in Dative Case ending with any of the Shat pallavas : Namah/svasti/svaahaa/

svadhaa/ vashat/vaushat depending on the purposes of Sadhaka.

  

**III) Maalaa mantra** and

A Maalaa mantra is such a one which is composed of more than 104 syllables. It can be and mixture of Bija Aksharas, Names and epithets and purpose of the mantra being included in it..

  

**IV) Sloka Mantras**

i\. These are in sloka form being composed in popular metres.

Some times these Mantras are in single sloka form or Ashtaka form or stora form with many number of slokas or even in Dandaka Form.

ii\. Even Bija Mantra, Bija+Nama Mantra and Maalaa Mnatra are metrical. But those metres are not so popular and do not have foot division.

  

iii\. Mantras in Epic form: Entire Ramayana or Mahabharata or Bhagavata or Bhagavadgita or Makrandeya Purana etc are also called Mantras in Pauranic tradition.

In all the above instances Mantra is considered as means to please the Upasya Daivatam.

  

**3. A special consideration in Sakteya Sampradaya**:

In Sakteya a Mantra is considred as the subtlest form of the Upasya God or Goddess.

According to Sakteya A God or Goddess according to the level of Sadhaka can be in three forms:

i\. In human form (Sthula Rupa) ii. In Yantra form (Mediocre form) iii. In Mantra Form. (Sukshma Rupa)

Here Mantra is not merely a means it is the Deity by itself.

  

This is in brief about the Mantras and their relation with Bijas.
