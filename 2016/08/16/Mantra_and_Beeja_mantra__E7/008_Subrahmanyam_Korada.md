नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

If we accept "मन्त्र is for जप -**तज्जपः तदर्थभावनम् ( योगसूत्रम्) ।**"  

  

Then how can one say*"**They do not have any meaning"*?

  

                     -- Vidvan Dr Yadu Moharir

  

  

Please do ' read between the lines ' .

  

बीजमन्त्रs do not have any meaning - then what to think ?

  

Let us discuss the matter threadbare --

  

what is the problem ?

  

There are thousands of मन्त्रs across the four Vedas . पूर्वमीमांसा is the system that deals with the definition etc of Vedic sentences .

  

The Vedic exegeses of मीमांसा ( the word पूर्व refers to the earlier parts of Veda, which propose कर्म) are the top authority in deciding the scope , range and semantics  of any given stretch of language , both in वेद and लोक ।

  

वेदमन्त्रs are अपौरुषेय and have been there since time immemorial - अनादि ।

  

Some centuries age some scholars floated a system called तन्त्रम् ( having many dimensions) and compiled कल्पसूत्रम् that helps in the procedure of invented rites , which are अवैदिक ।

  

In order to achieve authority for such cults scholars , who are well versed in वेदाः , वेदाङ्गानि , दर्शनानि , पुराणानि etc started writing commentaries on the texts of तन्त्रम् ।

  

Often these commentaries go awry and one can see abuse of Indian Philosophical Systems , including Veda itself.

  

Since people prefer easy ways of achieving things and do not want to be bounden by restrictions at all levels these cults attracted many common as well as educated people.

  

During different intervals these works on तन्त्र were refuted but total eradication was not possible.

  

Even Nagesa , in लघुमञ्जूषा , due to the influence of तन्त्रम् , says - सृष्टि starts from बिन्दु - Samkaracarya solved the question of विगानम् in सूत्रभाष्यम् ।

  

प्रत्यभिज्ञादर्शनम् ( लोचनकर्ता is a propagator) holds - since Panini
ruled - स्वतन्त्रः कर्ता , शिव creates the creatures irrespective of their कर्म !

  

The founders and propagators of तन्त्रम् had invented some entities called बीजमन्त्रs . We do not know what it means and what the समास is.

  

They are not bothered about the impending पाणिनिविरोध or जैमिनिविरोध ।

  

Let us take up the question of - whether these बीजमन्त्रs fall under the definition of **Jaimini / Kumarila --**

**  
**

**पूर्वमीमांसादर्शनम् - मन्त्रलक्षणाधिकरणम् (शाबरभाष्यम्, तन्त्रवार्तिकम्) --**

**  
**

**तच्चोदकेषु मन्त्राख्या 1-1-7-32**

  

how to decide as to whether a sentence or text can be called a मन्त्र or not ?

-- if the sentence / text in question is popular among those who learnt Veda as मन्त्र then that can be considered as a मन्त्र ।

  

We come across diversified मन्त्रs in वेद --

  

1\. ending with असि - मेदो’सि etc

  

2.ending in त्वा - इषेत्वोर्जेत्वा

  

3.ending in आशीः - आयुर्दा असि

  

4\. ending in स्तुत्यन्त - अग्निर्मूर्धा दिवः ककुत्

  

also स्तुतिमन्त्र, प्रलापमन्त्र, प्रैषमन्त्र etc.

  

So it is difficult to offer a definition that covers all such मन्त्रस्s . So following वैदिकसमाख्या -- " प्रयोगकाले अर्थस्मारकाः मन्त्राः ", and their remarks such as - मन्त्रानधीमहे , मन्त्रानध्यापयामः , मन्त्रा वर्तन्ते etc , it is decided that such and such a popularity is the definition of मन्त्रs.

  

It is simply impossible to take up all entities on earth and offer definitions - same is the case with मन्त्रs also --

  

ऋषयो’पि हि लक्ष्याणां नान्तं यान्ति पृथक्त्वशः ।

लक्षणेन तु सिद्धानाम् अन्तं यान्ति विपश्चितः ॥  Kumarila

  

Therefore , since we do not find any meaning assigned to बीजाक्षरs / बीजमन्त्रs , we cannot consider them as मन्त्रs at all .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
