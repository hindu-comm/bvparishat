Dear list

  

If the AISF protests against building a statue of Adi Sankaracharya were not enough to shock many people on the list, we have a bestselling author (who in my humble opinion is at only a slightly higher level than the *public ignoramus*so vividly sketched by Prof Michel Danino in [one of his recent articles](http://www.mydigitalfc.com/knowledge/public-ignoramus-229)) tracing patriarchy and untouchability in India to values of celibacy, non-violence, and purity in Dharmic traditions!!  

  

<http://scroll.in/article/813618/how-celibacy-non-violence-and-purity-work-to-establish-patriarchy-in-india>  

  

I do not know which is more deplorable: the multiple factual errors or conflations or the complete lack of authentic references or logical reasoning. But given that the author is influential and popular with English speaking urban Indians, I believe some of may want to author a response.

  

Those interested in working on a response are requested to get in touch with me off the list.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
