Dear All,  
  
We request you to curtail the unwanted portion of communication while replying to any thread. In other words, do not top-post or bottom-post/in-line reply that carries back heaps of old data in each of your reply. Members subscribed to digest mode, would receive lots of data in this form. This not only is inconvenient to computer users but also to Android/IOS/Blackberry users who need to flip through so many pages to find exact replies, in response to relevant threads. After all, cyber space is like our physical space. Let us keep it clean and we seek your kind cooperation.  
  
Thank you,  
BVP Management
