Dear Prof.Deshpande,

Many thanks for your kind words of appreciation. Both Gangalahari and Bhaminivilasa with my English translation have been in the public domain for quite some years.

Sri. Jaya Prakash who posted them and who is yet to respond to my query seems to have copied and pasted from the PDF.

If you desire, I can send PDF versions to you direct.

Thanks and warm regards,

Murthy
