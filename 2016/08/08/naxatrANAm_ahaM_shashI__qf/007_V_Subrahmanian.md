It looks like the '= Tat-Tat –Shaastra paribhAshaa vihita - vidhi) for interpretation' is a sensible approach to this question. For instance, the ucchaisravas is a horse which no one can scientifically prove today. So with many other entities that Krishna lists as his vibhūti. Svarga loka is not a candidate for modern science though belief in such a loka is very much essential to pūrva and uttara mīmāmsā. The 27 stars (ashvati, bharani...) are believed to be wedded to Chandra. There is even a story that he was especially fond of, partial to, one of them and so on. These things are beyond the ken of or outside the purview of science.
