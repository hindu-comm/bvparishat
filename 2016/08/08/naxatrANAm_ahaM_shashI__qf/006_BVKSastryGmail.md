Namaste



Apart from the ‘ linguistic – justification’ on \< Is ‘Chandra’ - A Graha ( according to Jyotisha; and an earth-orbiting cosmic entity in modern astronomy) Or a ‘Nakshatra’ ( in the sense of a ‘Star’?), where word meaning of ‘Nakshatra’ is positioned and explained differently in the commentary,



**The linguistic interpretation point is of interest here**. What might have been the contextual and original, Yoga- discipline specific meaning of the word ‘Nakshatra’ in Yoga-Document called Gita using Samskrutham to present the statement : ‘"नक्षत्राणाम् अहं शशी " ?
Taking the dialogue of Gita to be a dialogue of two yogi’s on the subject of Yogas , and using Samskrutham as the language of discourse?



Why and where ‘Nakshatra’ got the contextual meaning to obliterate the difference of ‘graha –nakshatra’ ? – the two words that occur in Gita in the same context ?



I believe that as on date also, Jyotish practitioners and traditionalists still say the statement – ‘आदित्यदि-ग्रहास्सर्वे, स-नक्षत्राः-सराशयः । कुर्वन्तु मङ्गलं नित्यं... and distinguish between the ritual technicalities of ( ग्रहचार - गोचार – नक्षत्रदशा ) ; (नक्षत्र- शान्ति - ग्रहशान्ति ). The ‘ lordship of Rashi and Nakshtraadhipatya of Graha’ are intricate technicalities of Jyotish. The observation \< नक्षत्राणां पतिः चन्द्रः \> which presupposes ‘ a ‘marriage relation’ between a Graha and a Nakshatra :: Planet and a Star’ – is probably beyond the modern science \< **since the tools don't exist to probe** \> such a conceptuality.



So how would one proceed to explain the meaning of the word ‘Nakshatra ’ without the charge of ‘Grammar –Commentator- Ingenuity’ (Vyaakhyaa –Kaushala) ? 

OR

‘Shashi’ ( as a Nakshatra) is different entity from ‘Chandara’ ( as a Graha) ? It is not uncommon in Samskruth tradition to use the same name for different entities to be pointed out in different contexts . Example: ‘Jaati’ in Nyaya is different from ‘ Jaati ’ in social usage.

OR

Should we explore the postulate that there is a need to address the word-meaning in a discipline specific Yoga- contextuality ( = Tat-Tat –Shaastra paribhAshaa vihita - vidhi) for interpretation and distinguish Vedanta and Vedanga discipline meanings? And that leads to the exploration of Yoga way of studying Samskrutham ::Yoga-Samskrutham approach?
