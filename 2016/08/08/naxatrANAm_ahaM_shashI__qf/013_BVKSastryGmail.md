Namaste



The discussions in this thread has brought up three specific words :
व्युत्पत्ति - निरुक्ति - निर्वचन specific words , explained by Surendra Mohan Mishra ji.

Some clarifications needed here:



1) What may be the best ‘ English expression and Technical word from linguistics discipline’ to map the meaning –approach-purpose and outcome from words? How would it help to understand the meaning of a
‘word in Samskruth’ better and lead to a cleaner \< translation \>
? which in the present case, if I am connecting again from another thread ‘ maagha maase gavaamiva’ ? OR ‘Nakshatraanaam aham shasee’ ??



 - \< 'Etymology' may mean व्युत्पत्ति andनिरुक्ति both. But while translating we use 'grammar' for व्याकरण that gives व्युत्पत्ति or derivationand 'etymology' for निरुक्त that gives निर्वचन। "निरुक्तं हि कार्त्स्न्यं व्याकरणस्य"/ निरुक्त fulfills and compensates where grammar deems its weapons insufficient to arrive at the intended meaning. But how can something be left un-comprehended ? >



2) What is the compulsiveness of **‘ yena- kena vaa nirbrooyaat’** - Some how the explanation is to be made ? which Samskruth Scholars get obsessed with ? \< But how can something be left un-comprehended ? So येन केन वा निर्ब्रूयात्, संस्कारो नाद्रियेत \> Why such an obsession on Samskruth word explanation is pushed to the extent of ‘ artificiality’
in the name of ‘ hair splitting technicality of scholarship
(Vyaakhyaa-Chaaturee)?? Would this not invoke rebuke like the subhashita **\< yasya kasya** tarormolam, **yena-kenaapi** mishritam, **yasmai kasmai** pradaatavyam**, yadvaa tadvaa** bhavishayati>?



3) In a different thread, the ‘ nine grammar systems /grammarians views’ is being discussed. And Professor Korada has invoked Jaiminiya Meemaamsaa frame \< सिद्धान्तसूत्रम् -- अविशिश्टस्तु वाक्यार्थः
1-2-4-32 ;

The वाक्यार्थ in लोक and वेद is the same > . How would the three approaches \< व्युत्पत्ति - निरुक्ति - निर्वचन \>, applied on a given document of Samskruth help to firm up meaning of a word in Samskrutham, for Translation, without getting in to same charge as \< येन केन वा निर्ब्रूयात् \> model ? IF we have to stand by this model, even as an option, why should there be a ‘Sanskrit: Battle’ and
‘ Indology: Swadesi ‘ deliberation ? where ‘traditionalists’ views can be dismissed by the other side using the same argument : ‘येन केन वा निर्ब्रूयात् ‘ which is a finger pointed to ‘ Sheldon Pollock:
Linguistics and Literration’ ?? 



Cold logic combined (Tarka-Yukti) with ‘ Yoga-Darshana’ sans Emotional issues ( Bhaava –Samkshobha) of Pride needs to be invoked in understanding the ‘ Meaning of a Samskruth Word’ and to identify ‘what we have missed –messed up in understanding the Yaugikaartha of Samskrutha Shabda.



Look forward for clarifications from Scholars.
