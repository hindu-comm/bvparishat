Namaste Dr. S.M.Mishra,



I understand yougika meaning means etymological meaning. There are hundreds of words in Vedas for which etymology is not possible or very difficult (Example the word Yupa-sacrificial post in Yajna). Even Yaska had trouble in this area. More than seven etymologies are given by yask for the word Indra. Please add your views in order to enlighten me. Thanks , N,R,Joshi

Thanks for this Vedic corroboration of the Gita statement ! thanks to the author Hanuman for focussing on this question. This is how as per Yaska the yaugika meaning is more important than conventional meaning in case of Vedic words.
