Friends!

I am forwarding a mail posted to me by my friend Sri Purushothaman from Mumbai.

The first two attachments speak for themselves.

The third one is the relevant portion of a versified translation of Mahabharata in Malayalam language by Mahakavi Kunjikkuttan Thampuran.(कुञ्ञिक्कुट्टन् तम्पुरान्) a member of Royal family of Kodungallur (Crangannoor). He carried out this entire translation in a year. He was a devotee of Bhadrakaali. He has the reading माघमां सेगवा इव and translates accordingly (simile of crab-kids and their mother).

Dear Prof. Sundareswaran,  

This is regarding your recent post to the google group   
[भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्](https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21forum/bvparishat)  

I know this does not answer your query, but ...  

  

Just for your information I enclose three pages:  

1\) the page from BORI critical edition where all the variations to the shloka that they found are listed  

2\) the page from Chitrashala edition with Nilakantha commentary  

3\) the page from Malayalam translation of Kunhikuttan Thampuran.  

If i remember correctly there is a mention about the translation of this shloka in the book  
*Mahakavi Kunhikuttan Thampuran: Jiivitavum kritikaLum by Prof. K. Sivarama Menon, published by The Mathrubhumi Printing & Publishing Co. Ltd. Calicut (1989).

*Best  
**Harindranath*
