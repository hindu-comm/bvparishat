It may be noted that the BORI critical edition records a reading माघमासे गवा इव supported by an explanation माघमासे शिशिरर्तुप्रथमभागे गवा सूर्यरश्मिना गायत्रीव गात्राणि शरीरावयवान् कृन्तन्ति छिन्दन्ति .This is in tune with what Prof. P. Ramanujam's explanation (Prof. Ram Karan Sharma's view). Moreover, we have a verse appearing in the preceding chapter (118th one in the Gorakhpur Edn.) which also supports this view. It is यथा हि शैशिरः कालो गवां मर्माणि कृन्तति। तथा पाण्डुसुतानां वै भीष्मो मर्माणि कृन्तति।।

We may also remember that Yaska explains the word शिशिरं asशिशिरं शृणातेः शम्नातेः वा ।
