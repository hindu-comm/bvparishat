Dear Scholars,

I don’t like to interfere with the discussions going on in another thread on *“māghamase gavām iva”*. If one considers linguistic similarities as a way of analysis, this usagecan be traced back to RV (x.85) the Sūryā-vivāha sūkta. As is widely known the phrase *aghāsu hanyante gāvo*…(X.85.13) is taken to mean killing of cows before a marriage by western indologists, where as Sāyaṇa takes it to mean goading the bullocks of the cart.. (pl see below). It is the phrase *hanyante* *gāvaḥ* especially the latter word that leads to different meanings. When the same word gives different meanings, it is generally said that one must take the meaning suited to the context. In some cases the context itself may be unclear to a modern reader. It is also possible the RV poets have introduced multiple shades of mystical and/or intuitive meanings in their natural extempore outpourings. The above RV Sūkta is one such inspired poetry, in my understanding. The context is marriage, but between two celestial entities in the sky! If this is recognized an entirely different interpretation is possible. This can be called “ancient astronomy” if you like, (it is not *secular* and by no stretch of imagination can it be called *profane).* 

  

I have been asked to contribute four chapters on “Astronomy in Vedic Texts” for the proceedings of the forthcoming Intnl. Conf. on Oriental astronomy, (Pune, Nov 2016) organized by TIFR. I am sharing with BVP members a part of my article on “eclipses”. Please read on...

**Marriage of Sūryā with Soma**

Hymn RV (X.85) is one of the most beautiful poetry in the whole of Vedic literature. This is popularly known as the marriage hymn describing the bridal procession of *sūryā* for her union with *soma* the Moon. The implied imagery of a lunar eclipse, hidden beneath the ancient enchanting poetry of the meeting of two celestial persons, is quite apparent from the beginning of the hymn. This hymn also presents a window to one of the esoteric cosmic thought that forms the basis of Hindu mysticism. There are forty-seven verses in this long hymn. We consider here only those connected with *soma* which in the *adhidaiva* sense is the moon as per the orthodox tradition of Yāska^(^(\[1\])). The gist of the astronomical information available is as follows.



*Earth is held by truth and the heaven is upheld by Sun. Ādityas depend on the cosmic order, while Moon is stationed in the sky.
(1)*

**

*Soma the moon is stationed near the nakṣatras.
(2)*

**

*He who crushes and drinks the juice thinks that the herb is Soma. But only the seers know the real nature of the regent deity of Soma (the moon). (3)*

**

*Soma! You are protected by seven layers of covers. Humans cannot take part in drinking you. (4)*

**

*Soma! Whereas the gods drink you, you become bright again. The wind protects the Soma, while moon is the creator of the years.
(5)*

**

The above five verses introduce moon as the object of the hymn. The next seven verses (*v.*6-12) describe the travel of Sun’s daughter *sūryā* in the sky towards her husband the Moon, in abstract terms. Her friends were *Lauds* and *Hymns*; her dress was made of *Sāma* music; her chariot was the Mind and her cover was the Sky. Two bright objects (*śukrau*) were the bullocks drawing her cart. In other words she was really invisible, till the poet was able to see her dress in colour much later in verse (*v*.35). In this picture the two *aśvins* appear as visible, hinting them to be twin stars witnessing the act. Verse (*v*.13) provides the locus of the celestial marriage through a metaphor.

*sūryāyā vahatuḥ prāgāt savitā yam avāsṛjat\|*

*aghāsu hanyante gāvo’rjunyoḥ paryuhyate \|\| (X.85.13)*



Traditionally this is rendered to mean:

*The bullocks of the cart with the wedding gifts were whipped in the Maghā asterisms. Sūryā was carried to her husband’s place in the Arjunī asterisms. *

**

This is the literal meaning given by Sāyaṇa also \[Pl see below for the Sanskrit commentary\]. But in view of the context of the night sky being pictured, the word *gāvaḥ* in the *adhidaiva* sense should mean *rays* or *light,* which is an accepted meaning of the word as per the Nirukta^(^(\[2\])). This leads to the direct meaning:



*The light rays (of moon) are hit in passing through the Maghā stars, while sūryā is carried over by moon in the Arjunī stars.*



This in plain language means the shadow on the moon started near group of six stars called *Maghā* the brightest among them being the ecliptic star Regulus. The eclipsed moon progressed in time towards *Arjunī* which refers to the two stars of the *Pūrva-phalguni* *nakṣatra*. In summary the eclipse was in the constellation Leonis. The next verse (*v*.14) mentions that when *aśvins* arrived asking for *sūryā,* their request was supported by *viśvedevāḥ*. We are not sure of the role of *aśvins* in the sky picture, other than inferring they should have been two closely spaced stars, but mention of *viśvedevāḥ* probably indicates a connection with their characteristic number 3339. Verses (18 & 19) are about the playful nature of sun and moon, where the property of being reborn is associated with the moon. The hymn from (*v*.20) onwards digresses on to the marriage of humans except in a few places where *sūryā* is referred. For example (*v.*35) is about the visible form of the three-fold dress of *sūryā* the pollution due to which only a seer can relieve. Similarly the upper cloth of a human bride is said to be afflicted by a deity, *dark coppery red in colour*. This reference to coppery red in relation to *sūryā* can be inferred to be the colour of the moon’s orb as seen from earth during a total eclipse. We have seen previously that *viśvedevāḥ* are the deities who bring *agni.* In verses (38-41) *sūryā* is said to have been given to *agni* by the *gandharva* who in turn got her from *soma.* The hymn presents a picture of the night sky, with moon being visible. Circumstances describing the journey of Sun’s daughter, named *suryā* to marry moon and the coppery red colour of the apparition indicate a total lunar eclipse. Mystically, this event highlights the cosmic *agni-soma* union.
