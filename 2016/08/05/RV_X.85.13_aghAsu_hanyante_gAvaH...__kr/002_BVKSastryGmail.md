Namaste



Thanks Prof. RNI for connecting the statement under discussion - अघासु हन्यन्ते गावः - RV (x.85) the Sūryā-vivāha sūkta - in a context sensitive way to Veda and Astronomy ( Kha-Gola- adhyaya ganita)
linked perspective from Vedanga –Jyotisha for Exploration. And you have rightly pointed the context of this sukta : \< There are forty-seven verses in this long hymn. We consider here only those connected with *soma* which in the *adhidaiva* sense is the moon as per the orthodox tradition of Yāska \> .



The visualization in **adhi-daiva** sense pointed by you is : \< moon as the object of the hymn- The next seven verses (*v.*6-12) describe the travel of Sun’s daughter *sūryā* in the sky towards her husband the Moon, in abstract terms…. Mystically, this event highlights the cosmic *agni-soma* union. >. Now, If I connect your observation to note-point of Sunil Bhattacharya,



**Sunil Bhattacharya**: \< If Surya marries Soma, what will happen to Soma' s 27 wives? …It is said that to interpret Veda properly, one has to have knowledge of Purana. Any way out of this riddle \>



Then, we need to see what is the ‘ Pedagogic logic and necessity for Bharateeya Paramparaa to tag the ‘ use of Purana –mysticism/ mythology/ narratives’ to the understanding of ‘Vedas’ ? – **itihAsa –purANAbhyAm vedArtham samupabruMhayet** ? The literal word ‘ sam- upa- bruMhayet’ – is a command with emphatic two upasargas, and a directive to enhance –explain- expand . What is this ‘ Veda- Vyasa guided linguistic pedagogy, which has been followed by all Acharyas prior to colonial period’ , if the ‘ Panini-Patanjali-Yaska’ rules books are
taken out arguing ‘historicity and language –social stratification’? which are the foundational arguments used by colonial writers and translators to re-engineer Vedas ? (See: <http://en.satyavedapusthakan.net/2013/01/24/considering-the-purusasukta-the-song-of-praise-of-man/> - This is just an example, and may not be exactly authentic and academic; may even be derogatory ). This is where I am seeking your additional inputs: ****



**RNI**: \< When the same word gives different meanings, it is generally said that one must take the meaning suited to the context. In some cases the context itself may be unclear to a modern reader. It is also possible the RV poets have introduced multiple shades of mystical and/or intuitive meanings in their natural extempore outpourings. The above RV Sūkta is one such inspired poetry, in my understanding. The context is marriage, but between two celestial entities in the sky! If this is recognized an entirely different interpretation is possible. This can be called “ancient astronomy” if you like, (it is not *secular* and by no stretch of imagination can it be called *profane).*  \>



**I am furthering this thread of interpretative exploration and seek your further inputs**: Assuming for argument sake, RV –x.85 of an earlier period found an express practical usage in a ‘ Marriage –Samskara’ of human society through the works of ‘Dharma Shaastra (-Gruhya ?) and got in to Vivaha Samskara-Vidhi, as a part of ‘Vedic Marriage Ritual’ in as early period as ‘ Mahabharata’ , what could have
been the reasoning to connect ‘ a mystic (celestial) union to a mundane (Human engagement) event’ ?



A decade ago, there was a workshop conducted at Udupi, on the theme ‘ Veda- Inexhaustible Infinity of Meanings (Anantaartha vai vedaah)’ - and this was inspired by one of the statements of Acharya Madhwa. The statement of Acharya Madhwa resonates to the linguistic challenges in constructing the layered meaning of ‘Vedas’ and makes a reference to Taittiriya Upanishad, where a five layered approach and use of Vednaga Tools is recommended along with a ‘Yoga-Approach’ to seek meaning and purpose of Vedas. The famous end quote being **‘ ya evam Veda, ya u chainam veda …. Ityupanishat’** – One who knows LIKE THIS ( A vedic -pedagogy which seems to have been mysteriously gone underground , a pedagogy which Sayana Maadhava emphatically presents and clarifies in rig-Bhashya bhoomikaa.



May be this dialogue opens gateways to find a strategy to arrive at ‘Yoga way of Studying Samskrutham’ – the Vak-Yoga tradition, gone underground in India by at least three centuries. And this could touch upon the ‘Prayoga- Viniyoga’ aspects of Samskruth studies.
