Namaste,  
  

The Vedas love indirect interpretation. So is there no other indirect
interpretation possible? If Surya marries Soma, what will happen to Soma' s 27 wives? Is it that fifth Vedic (Matsya purana) legend of Soma marrying Daksha's 27 daughters is not approved by Veda. In fact, It is said that to interpret Veda properly, one has to have knowledge of Purana. Any way out of this riddle?  
  

Regards,
