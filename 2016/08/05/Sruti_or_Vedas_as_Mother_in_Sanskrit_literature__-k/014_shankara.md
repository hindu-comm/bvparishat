Paturiji,

  

I am sorry if there was any confusion regarding what I am looking for.  

  

I thought I had made it clear in my first post that on initial search I found a quote from Sankarabhashya where Sankaracharya describes Veda as मातृवत् and that I looking for an instance where Veda is described as Veda the Mother (not Mother of the Vedas).



regards  
shankara
