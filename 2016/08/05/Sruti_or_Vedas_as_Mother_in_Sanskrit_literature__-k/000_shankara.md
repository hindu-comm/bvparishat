Pranams to all,

  

I would like to know the earliest instances in Sanskrit literature where the Vedas are called mother, श्रुतिमाता. (not in the sense of Veda-maataa Gaayatri). When I searched at Advaita-Sarada site, I could find only one instance where Sankaracharya uses 'मातृवत्' in Kathopanishad Bhashya.

  

Are there other instances where Sruti is called माता, rather than मातृवत्?  



regards  
shankara
