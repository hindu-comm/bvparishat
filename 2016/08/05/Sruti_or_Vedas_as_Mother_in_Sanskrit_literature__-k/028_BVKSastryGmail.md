Namaste



Getting to the starting point of the question by Shankara : \< where the Vedas are called mother, श्रुतिमाता. (not in the sense of Veda-maataa Gaayatri …; looking for an instance of Vedamaataa or Srutimaataa in Sanskrit literature where the primary meaning is 'Veda the mother' . … instances where Sruti is called माता, rather than मातृवत्? > and beyond the already quoted resources: \<- Katha bhāṣya 2.4.15, 'वेदजननी' in Srilalitasahasranama where it is \< Sri Lalita as the Mother of the Vedas according Bhaskararaya, not as Srutimaataa \> , स्तुता मया वरदा* वेदमाता, *Sayana bhashya of mantra (AV 1.71.1) where Vedamata is interpreted as both 'the mother of Vedas' i.e. Savitri (Gayatri) as well as 'Veda the mother' \>





Would the following reference in Sandhya Mantras /Bhashya be good enough to satisfy the query ?



ASS_040. [Sandhya Bhashya Samuchaya with 5 Commentaries – KS Agase 1899](https://ia801704.us.archive.org/2/items/Anandashram_Samskrita_Granthavali_Anandashram_Sanskrit_Series/ASS_040_Sandhya_Bhashya_Samuchaya_with_5_Commentaries_-_KS_Agase_1899.pdf) - ASS_040. Sandhya Bhashya Samuchaya with 5 Commentaries – KS Agase 1899 -Quoting : Taittiriya Aaranyaka -Pra.10 adhyaya 34.



The word ‘Chandasam Maataa ‘ is explained in multiple senses in five commentaries : image extracts attached.

Whether one takes ‘Gayatri as Mother of Vedas’ OR ‘ Vedas as mother of Gayatri’ – is a preference for meditation –upaasanaa.



The connection of ‘Gayatri’ here is not necessarily limited to a female deity or a specific Richa.



The concept of ‘Vedas (Chandas) as Mother is clear.

Let us take the following as an example of an interpretation whereवेदमाता - वेद रूपी मां as mother is taken as the only meaning and see if the other meaning Savitri or Gayatri is compelling or compulsory.
