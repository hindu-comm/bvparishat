As I recall, the following verse is ascribed to Ādya Śaṅkarācārya:

  

स्वं बालं रोदमानं चिरतर-समयं शान्तिमानेतुमग्रे

द्राक्षां खार्जूरमाम्रं सुकदलमथवा योजयत्यम्बिकास्ये ।

तद्वच् चेतोऽतिमूढं बहु-जनन-भवान् मौढ्य-संस्कार-योगाद्

बोधोपायैर् अनेकैर् अवशमुपनिषद् बोधयामास सम्यक् ।।

  

Assuming the ascription is correct, Śaṅkara should be viewed as unambiguously speaking of the Upaniạds as mātṛ ‘mother in this verse. The Upaniṣads are frequently thought of as Śruti inhis other writings. Therefore, the metaphor of mother for Śruti can be said to go back at least to the time of Ādya Śaṅkarācārya (usually taken to be 788-920 A.D.).

  

I cannot at the moment ascertain if the verse actually occurs in any work of Śaṅkara. I would be grateful if someone would determine the original locus of the verse.
