Aklujkarji,

  

I also felt that there is more emphasis in 'Veda the mother' than in 'Veda is like a mother'.

shankara

I was distinguishing between simile and metaphor in this case. Are both the alankaras same in effect?

  

Depends on what you include in ‘effect.’ Both alaṁkāras are based on similitude. Simile conveys similitude without playing down the factual/physical/commonsensical difference of entities. Metaphor conveys similitude in a more emphatic/assertive/stronger way, inclining toward identification of two entities.
