Depends on what you include in ‘effect.’ Both alaṁkāras are based on similitude. Simile conveys similitude without playing down the factual/physical/commonsensical difference of entities. Metaphor conveys similitude in a more emphatic/assertive/stronger way, inclining toward identification of two entities.
