Thanks to Prof. Kannan for identifying the original locus of the verse I had cited from memory. It is big help.

So, are you making a difference (as one should) between two tropes or figures of speech, upamā ‘simile’ and rüpaka ‘metaphor’ (“metaphor” not in the sense ’secondary meaning’ in which Western theoreticians frequently use the word)? Are you specifically looking for \*expressions\* like Veda-mātā, Śruti-jananī, not for the source of the idea ‘Mother Śruti’ (or ‘Śruti-mother’ or ‘Śruti, the mother’?
