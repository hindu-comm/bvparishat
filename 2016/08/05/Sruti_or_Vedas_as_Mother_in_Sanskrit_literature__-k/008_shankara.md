Paturiji,

  

In fact I am looking for an instance of Vedamaataa or Srutimaataa in Sanskrit literature where the primary meaning is 'Veda the mother'. In AV 19.71.1, primary meaning of Vedamaataa is Gayatri (based on the context). This is clear when we read the whole mantra.

  

That is why requested for other references without any ambiguity in interpretation.  



regards  
shankara
