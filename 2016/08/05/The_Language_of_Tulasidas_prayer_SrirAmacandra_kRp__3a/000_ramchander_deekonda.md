Respected Vidvaans,

  

Please enlighten me as ti what language is used in the famous prayer of Sant Tulasi Das in "SrirAmacandra KrpAlu bhaja (bhaju) mana...". Since my child hood I am confused whether this is Sanskrit or Avadhi like Hanuman Chalisa. There are several verbs that sound like Sanskrit but again it does not appear to conform to Sanskrit grammar. "SriRamacandra" is in vocative or not. Like me many Sanskrit lovers of south India are not sure about thIs language/dialect.

  

Scholars may kindly help us appreciate the prayer in the right letter and spirit.

  

Regards,

  

BhavadIyah
