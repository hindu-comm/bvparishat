Namaste



Samskrutham is a ‘ peculiar and unique language’ where modification of a single sound or accent, join or break of a word, sound can toss the meaning from south to North ! And here is a debate to prove this as a classic example.



Especially when the ‘Standard Voicing of the Samkrutha Varna-Akshara- Swara ’ has suffered mutilations of voiced pronunciation through regional languages , scripting, spelling diversities and printer-introduced modifications ! Add to this, the regional historical deviations of interpretation, practice diversities and all topped by ‘ motives in presenting Dharma-Kshetra Nation’s history as a Religion -Divided community’. 



While I am not for or against any specific interpretation here on \< Cow- Killing /Beef consuming and related sacredness or otherwise debates>, I have reservations on the methodologies preferred to cite- split and interpret a given piece of \<printed text>, as \< evidence supreme>. The understanding of the Samskruth language pedagogy and Yajna-Vedic practicing tradition have great bearing on ‘ How one constructs the value of Vedic Tradition using a ‘ preferentially projected model of understanding the Language of vedic document and mounting a theology –history, ritual and cultural practice around it : be it with motive or otherwise. Once such technicalities surface out on global forums and ‘ open debating issues’, it may be relevant to take note of ‘some dissenting –divergent (traditional ?) views’ also as a part of the discourse here.



Here below is my reasoning for this statement.



Given Statement: माघमां सेगवा इव। or माघमासे गवामिव।

Challenging issue/s: (a) What is the correct reading? Is there an anuswaara ? Is the word : मासे for मांसे ? (b) What would be the meaning of the word the base word ‘Go’ in the simile ‘गवामिव’ ? Why connect ‘Go’ to the month माघ : A season of great significance detailed in Puranas for worship of Vishnu. ( Maagha -Maasa is seasons part of Shishira Ritu ; when Sun is transiting in Saggitaurus and Capricorn : Moon is in star Magha on full moon day ; Matching to Dec-Jan/Jan/Feb of current Gregorian calendar. ) .







Plausible interpretations: Follow the existing tradition of sacred practices in maagha maasam: No Cow Killing is the conclusion.



Faith and Cultural belief about Maagha-Maasa : <http://indianmandirs.blogspot.in/2014/01/significance-of-magha-maasam.html> ;

)



Follow Classical writers and other resources: The ‘ add-on anuswara’ is an ‘ interpolation of historic time period, at least after Sayana ?! and pushed by Pune teams and scholars to the western academia? - Mixed view : Brahmana Sampradaya is not for cow killing; Generic Hindu Society – Cow killing /Beef was optional under the changed demography of India after muslim and Christian mix.



(The history of beef in India – Page 203 to 205 ) - <http://www.rarebooksocietyofindia.org/book_archive/196174216674_10153573076876675.pdf> - (Published by Gita Press, Gorakhpur on 14th January, 1971) Second Edition-11 00 copies ; Published by Shree Krishna Janmasthan Seva-Sansthan, Mathura on Phalgun Purnima V. S. 2039 (28th March 1983)







Language Tools and contexs used: Classical dictionary which provides multiple meanings for the word ‘Go’; Purana resources ; Nirukta. Historic practices.



Outcome of such an exercise: The entire practicing tradition has ‘ lost’ the meaning of the source text and directive \< from vedic texts: Kaushika Grihya Sutra belonging to Atharva Veda on Vivaha Samskara ; > and on what needs to be done in maagha-maasam;

OR

Academicians have a free Play and Say on the meaning of Veda \< G. U. Thite (from Pune) on Sacrifices in BraahmaNa-texts \> discarding the norms of academic integrity and standards of constructing the text in specific language.



In both cases, the causality is understanding the ‘history’ of the tradition, and the value of the directive. 



Unresolved Question that needs to be answered by Samskruth Language Modelers: What criterions should be set in such cases to decide the ‘Taatparya-Artha of Text and have clarity on the pada-artha’ ? Will it be reliance on Practice, Principle of the Shadanga-Vedanga Yoga Samskrutha Paddhati, where Nirukta plays a greater role than the kosha and dictionary providing ‘meaning in other language’? How would one work on (Mahabhaarata ?-) ‘Taatparya –Nirnaya’? Padaartha-Nirnaya ? - use of a text to justify a ‘food practice for taste of palate and promotion of a politicized abattoir business’ or ‘ Cow protection-donations’ ?



What could have been the relevance of Patanjali starting the Gramamr discourse with the select word ‘Go’ and asking the question : atha Gaurityatra kah shabdah’?



Or should this debate be stuck in the old groove of ‘Caste-Cow- Curry’ frame of Hinduism?



Thanks in advance for the further guidance from the scholars.
