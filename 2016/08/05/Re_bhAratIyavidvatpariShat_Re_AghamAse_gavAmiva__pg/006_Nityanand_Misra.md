Also under 3.4.73 दाशगोघ्नौ सम्प्रदाने, Pandita Ishvarachandra in his commentaryChandralekhaexplains गोघ्नः as गां दुग्धादिकं हन्ति प्राप्नुवन्ति यस्मै स गोघ्नोऽतिथिः (Ashtadhyayi with Chandralekha commentary, Volume I, 2004: Chaukhambha Sanskrit Pratishthan, p. 408). The meaning taken by the commentator is गत्यर्थ, which is also प्राप्त्यर्थ in accordance with ये गत्यर्थास्ते प्राप्त्यर्थाः.
