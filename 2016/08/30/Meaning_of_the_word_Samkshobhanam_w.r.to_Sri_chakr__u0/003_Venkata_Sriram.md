Namaste,

  

Here, in this particular context, the word "samkshobha" implies "the blooming of energy" (शक्त्याः उल्लासः*).* The *modus operandi*of this ullAsaH is in the "manas" ie., mind. And hence, the usage as "ananga" (अनङ्ग) and all the 8 names has this word. These 8 represent 8 forms of prakriti (अष्टधा प्रकृतिः). namely:

  

1\. अनङ्गकुसुमा,

2\. अनङ्गमेखला,

3\. अनङ्गमदना,

4\. अनङ्गमदनातुरा,

5\. अनङ्गरेखा,

6\. अनङ्गवेगिनी,

7\. अनङ्गङ्कुशा,

8\. अनङ्गमालिनी  

  

These 8 shaktis preside overवचन, आदान, गमन, विसर्ग, आनन्द, हास, उपादान, उपेक्ष activities. So, with the proper observance of the particular mudrAs with "controlled mind" at this AvaraNa, the above said 8 shaktis would bless the upAsaka, thereby, the 8 forms of activities would be well-regulated. The anugraha of these 8 deities is also termed as "samkshobha" which leads us to the control of mind (ananga).
