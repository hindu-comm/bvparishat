The "Sanskrit 2003 NM" font is nothing but Sanskrit 2003 with some glyphs changed. In the legacy Sanskrit 2003 font, as in Arial Unicode MS, the nukta in the retroflex flap (ड़) and the aspirated retroflex flap (ढ़) is not placed in the centre below the consonant but to the left. The work cites some verses from theRāmacaritamānasa which use these characters, so I changed the two glyphs. There may be one or two more changes I made, but I do not recall them.

  

There are more problems with Sanskrit 2003, for example you writeहरिं and the anusvara merges with the matra stroke. The glyph for थ्र has an artifial corner which is absent in the glyph forथ. There are many more, but that's another discussion for another day.
