I did take note of your post (on August 10 2016). The book was typeset in October 2015 and after that I have not had the time to try out with the newer version of Sanskrit 2003.

Thanks for informing, I have stopped keeping track of Sanskrit 2003 updates. After experimenting with many fonts in LaTeX, I have realized that a font without boldface, italic and bold italic weights (e.g. Sanskrit 2003, Siddhanta, etc) is just not good enough for print books.

  

I have now settled on "Chanakya Sanskrit" which combines the legacy Chanakya font (used by Gita Press) with extra conjunct glyphs modeled after Sanskrit 2003 glyphs. It is not perfect, but will get there.

  

My own work on recreation of NSP 1928 typeface with Sudhir Kuduchkar is stalled currently. We have done nearly 300 glyphs but only one weight so far.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
