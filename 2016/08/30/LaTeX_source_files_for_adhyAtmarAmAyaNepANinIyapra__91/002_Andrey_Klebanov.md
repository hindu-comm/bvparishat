Dear Nityananda ji,  
a very profane question to begin with. I've noticed you using “Sanskrit 2003 NM" font, which I have never come across before. Judging from its shape it seems to look exactly like "Sanskrit 2003". I wonder, however, wether it has any hidden differences? (I remember, for example, that some saṃyoga-s in Sanskrit 2003, though they looked fine in a pdf, could not be adequately reproduced by some printers... forgive me for not remembering which saṃyoga's exactly I'm talking about... possibly "ṅg"(?) )  
thanks a lot once again for sharing the files
