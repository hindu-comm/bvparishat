Thank you for watching Video and appreciation Dear Prasad, Pavitra and others. i expected more reflections from bharateeya vidvat Parishad.

  

Living here i always think, We have to re-vibrate ourselves. China, Tibet and whole South East Asia are keeping up our ancient spirit. There is a lot of confusion in present day Indian behavior. this is serious problem.

  

thanking you,

  

with regards,
