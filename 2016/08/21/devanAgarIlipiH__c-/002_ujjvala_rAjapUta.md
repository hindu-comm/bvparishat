Take any existing font, say Lohit or Sanskrit 2003. Look at the glyph for क. It is an SVG. Choose any point. Now wonder why its x coordinate is, say 6.512, instead of 6.523. Such minute questions have only one possible answer--because while drawing, a muscle of the artist's hand twitched in a particular way. One might argue that this has been happening for thousands of years while writing manuscripts. But then I will say that subsequent scribes don't copy the muscle twitches of previous scribes. They only copy what they find important. Today, on thousands of screens across the world, the muscle twitches of the artist show up.  
This font which I want to make solves this problem while also solving many other problems. Every pixel has been carefully placed. Moreover, anyone is welcome to scrutinize the placement of the pixels. It is very compact and has just those details that I find necessary. It can be displayed on screens with low resolution and color. The complete रामायण can be written in this font in less than 6 MB (this is just one upper limit that I have calculated and the actual size can be much smaller).
