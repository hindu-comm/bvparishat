**Abstract:**

The concept of language games (Wittgenstein; Lewis) emphasizes the interactive aspects of language. There has been a recent but growing stream of research exploring language games in laboratory setting, using methods that allow for experimental control and manipulation.An important aim of such research has been to explore the emergence of language conventions. In this talk, after shortly summarizing recent results in the experimental study of language games, I present two laboratory language games conduced in the Venice Experimental Lab, exploring the emergence of compositional structure in communication and the negotiation of "lexical pacts".
