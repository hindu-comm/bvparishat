Namaste



Three Very important points to note from Professor Korada’s post, responding to RNI, on ‘ Pranayama –Practice’ and ‘ Chant of Gayatri Mantra’ , along with my notes, below. 



The end question is ‘ What can be done by us here now to re-boot and restore the ‘Yoga in to Samskruth’ in the system’? beyond ‘ Vishaada –Yoga’ ? and self-gratification by saying that ‘ Once upon a time, it was practiced like this, as stated in the text in a classical language …. ( puraa naimishaaranye aaseenam suta mahamunim…. !’. )



**1) Loss of Tradition and Techniques of ‘ Yoga-Pranayama’ that is truly relevant for Samskrutham –Mantra Practices needing ‘Vak-Yoga’ advanced instructions, an integral part of ‘Sandhyaa’. **



Professor Korada : \< , people are not meditating गायत्री during प्राणायाम ….. Neither the यजमान , nor the पुरोहित , nor the common people are bothered about this great drill called प्राणायाम । \>



The Upanishad –Gita and Patanjali based tradition of Pranayama comes as a two part guidance. Pranayama with breath focus (= Amantraka) and Mantra-Sound Focus (Sa-Mantraka). This model of teaching was provided as a part of advanced teaching at Shivananda Ashram Traditions at Hrishikesh, around ‘70’s. At South India, some families did carry the secrets of the Vedic Yoga traditions ( - And they did/ do survive
with some masters). There could be some unknown unsurfaced masters around still, not getting on to the cyber debate space. 



The startup techniques , common for all yoga practitioners , is called **‘ A-mantraka Pranayama’** which is plain focus on ‘ breath regulation / modulation’ linked to Patanjali Yoga-Sutra (2-49). This is the most widely researched and practiced yogaanga technique; carries mostly a Buddhist mediation flavor and popular statement – ‘ When in stress, BREATHE’. Here the focus is on ‘ breath related Praana :: Life energy in relation to Breathing. This is post ‘Aasana’ and prior to ‘ Pratyahaara’. This is Praak-Krutha = Separated from the Mantra for Meditation. In medical terms, to breathe, one does not have to think or speak or say. They are functionalities of different nature from different body organs and impacting energy flow in the body differently. Breathing primarily impacts body and secondarily impacts ‘Thought (= Chitta Vrutti / Bhaavanaa = Logic and emotion, Memory and Articulation ).





The advanced techniques of ‘Pranayama’ that are needed in post –pratyaahara phase of yogaanga, are called **‘ Samantraka –Pranayama’**. This is the foundation of all Sandhyaa and Vaidika karmas , irrespective of three or seven vyaharuti’s used, the three or four gayatri mantra padas and the mix of veda-mantras in practice.
Most of these practical’s were retained as ‘ In-house / In-Family teachings in the ‘Vaidika Brahmana families’. Whether one got any explanation or not, the practice structure and discipline was noticed, unmistakable and with a unique ‘Yoga-Veda- Samskrutham’ signature in the ‘ Pravara’ statements. The scope of this **‘ Samantraka –Pranayama’** extends from ‘Dharanaa phase of yogaanga to Post Siddhi phase of Yoga practice. The techniques of ‘Samantraka Pranayama’ use the ‘ Prana’ power in the ‘Mantra –Sounds’. The connection of ‘Mantra –Varna’ and ‘ Praana (Sookshma –gati) ‘ are to be understood from **the fundamentals of ‘Shikshaa Shaastra’, which are ‘Vedaanga’ ( and advanced Vedaangas/ Veda –Bhashaa –Anga / Yoga- Bhashaa Anga /Vak-Yoga).** The pointing clue starts at – ‘ Atmaa buddhyaa samaayuktah.. manah kaayagnim aahanti..’ : **Shikshaa (Vedanga-1) as foundation before Vyakarana (Vednaga -2)** A prior step to learn ‘Sa-mantraka Pranayama’ as speech sound articulation after Pranayama of breath. The foot-print of this is still left in the statement ‘ **Aasane** upavishya , **Praanaan- aayamya’**- It is an inner and internal process of ‘ moving and guiding Prana from the memory of sounds, with an intention (Vivaksaaa) to articulate ( uccharana) a processed word ( sa-pratyayam, pratipadikam, Dhatuh vaa) processed in compliance with
Vyaakarana rules of Samskrutham . The ‘Vedaartha Charchaa comes as further advancement of Vedangas : Chandas ( **Vedanga-3) **, Nirukta ( **Vedanga-4) **, Jyotisha ( **Vedanga-5) **, Kalpa (
**Vedanga-6) **. The study of Kalpa as Vedic ‘Fire’ ritual documentation and ‘ post mortem analysis- academic exercise’ without the starting committed foundation from Sandhyaa-Practice –Practicals covering ‘Samantraka PRanayama’, does not breathe ‘Prana-Yoga-life’ in to the study of Samskrutham.



In the current period, the ‘brahmana community practices, as seen and shown, being no exception) seems to have suffered a double jeopardy : Loss and Not-bothered. Loss, as there is no practice and practical. Not-Bothered , because there is no one to audit ! This is what makes the ‘ Vedic ritual seem to be a dress-rehearsal of no meaningful message, including ‘Sandhya’, on which Manu set his dictum : ‘ To the exception of all other doing or not doing, the practitioner of ‘ Maitra – worship ( = the technical name for Three times Sandhya vandanam’) is a Brahmana. Failure to keep to this standard is a mark of fall. ( = Kuryaat anyat na vaa kuryaat, Maitro Braahmana uchyate). This ‘Sandhyaa –Vandanam’ as ‘ Maitra ritual was a prescription for all three Varanas , making it a social mandate for 75% social spirituality by ‘practice of Veda’. A fact, though ‘ hurting’ cannot be concealed.



The combined ‘ Loss part’ of ‘ technique of Sa-mantaka Pranayama’ and ‘ Not-bothered’ part being ‘ Vaidika -Samskrutha –Shabda uccharanam’ is an issue that needs to be addressed as a part of Samskrutham revival
and Yoga- Course correction. 



If one cannot breathe for another person, making breathing an external, delegated substituted outsourced process ( irrespective of the Four Varna tags ) , on the same logic, one person cannot say the ‘Samskrutha Veda –Mantra’ for ‘another person- Yajamana’ ( irrespective of the varna of purohita or the yajamana ).



Historically speaking, by increasing this ‘ substitution-delegation process percentage in performance of vedic rituals and temple worship’, the three varnas ( other than Brahmana) lost Yoga and Samskrutham; and in the ‘ socio-dynamics of post colonial period, the ‘Brahmans seem to have lost ‘ the most sensible, necessary and sufficient, vital parts of Yoga and Yogaanga needed to make the Mantras in Samskrutham deliver the goods’. In the temples, when one does not know what is ‘Prana’ and ‘ Pranayama’ how can the ‘Devataa –Prana –Pratishthaapanaa and udvaasanam’ be effective? 



In the cyber space debates on these practical topics, one ends up in collecting the texts of excellence on practices and not in motivated learning-practice-practical of the Yoga-Samskrutham vitals .





2) **Loss of Proper usage of Mantra, Guidance from Text for use of Veda Mantra yielding ‘Bad and sterile Practice of Yoga and Vedic Ritual’ and ‘ Bad input and data feed to claims on Yoga-Research**



When Yoga-Pranayama –Mantra- research is based on ‘ ineffective and
sterile samples, the outcome will be far from the statements and claims in the text. Chanting Veda and Gaaytri as musical pleasing composition can be entertaining and relaxing, but surely not enlightening.



**3) Erosion of Yoga- Technicalities of Samskrutham usage , due to ‘ Practice of Yoga severed from Samskrutham’**. 



 When Samskruth studies re-positioned itself as ‘ historical
classical language study’ by shedding its ‘ Soul of Yoga –Veda –Mantra’, to simulate the very minor functionality of ‘ language as a medium of social communication’ , then the claims of ‘Samskrutham as Deva-Bhashaa / Veda –Bhashaa’ fall flat, or remain as self-flattering statements. In one master stroke, the colonial linguistics made ‘Vedas’ to be ‘ panegyric memory of history, and mother seeds of mythology ( itihasa –purana)’ and the ‘ language of Sacred to be the language of a bygone, primitive historic society. \< पथः अनपेतम् – पथ्यम् is also means a ‘ dietary prescription for restoring the health. >
