Connecting greater number of Vyaahrutis (7) with the length of praaNaayama by Prof. Iyengar is apt and matches with the experience during actual practice. With each vyaahruti, deeper and deeper meditation occurs. Vyaahrutis being taken as lokas , lokas being taken as levels of depth of inward spiritual experience, all match with this view.
