Dear Prof.Korada,

Namaste.  

Your explanations are clear and lucid as always. In a previous post I read the query as "......VyahrutiIn Vishwamitra Gayatri 3 and Pranama 7Vyahruti. Both mantra part is same..." byVidvan Jaya Prakash. I thought it may have been प्राणायाम and not प्रणाम . As far as I know and have been taught through inherited tradition, duringप्राणायाम seven व्याहृतिare used and the longer mantra is to be mentally repeated during kumbhaka three times. One प्राणायाम is made up of 3 such repetitions holding the breath. There may be regional/family variations in the ratio of recaka, pUraka and kumbhaka cycle. Scholars may inform the variations among the different regions of this vast country.

  

As an aside, I find that in current practice the सङ्कल्प is given undue prominence at the expense ofप्राणायाम,other than the priest loudly uttering त्रिःप्राणानायम्य .

  

regards

RN Iyengar
