नमस्ते ।  

  
भूः । ॐ भुवः । ॐ स्वः । ॐ महः । ॐ जनः । ॐ तपः ।  
ॐ सत्यं  
  

Let us again consider this simple mapping:  
  
ॐ \~ महः  
भूः \~ जनः  
भुवः \~ तपः  
स्वः \~ सत्यं  
  
e.g. स्वः is the realm and सत्यं is the door, etc.  
  
Of all four entries, सत्यं is considered the most important. Presided by अश्विनीकुमार, the domain of सत्यं is known as the last refuge (as well the means of recovery) of वेदमाता.  
  
There is a lot going on here, nevertheless some basic considerations - in my opinion - for a scholarly approach:  
A) ब्रह्म being the इष्ट of vedanta, overemphasis on ब्रह्म, ॐ etc should be filtered out before general conclusions can be arrived at from within Vedantic texts.  
B) परिमाण rule (valid for all of Sanskrit):  
word of Veda = sentence of Upanishads = para of Puranas  
- this explains why generic words like सत्यं, तपः etc are used (as a help) where for which we have precise addresses (difficult) in the Veda. Yet, at the sentence level the परिमाण is maintained.
