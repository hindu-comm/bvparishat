Namaste



On this thread of discussion on \< Difference in Vyahruti in Viswamatira Gayatri> .



My opinion for what it may be worth:



1. The entirety of ‘Mantra-Shaastra’ is for ‘ Practice and NOT for ‘ Intellectual debate on Design’. The ‘ Design of Mantra’ \< even when the’ Mantra part may be the same> can be entirely different. Example: Why same Purusha Sukta or Rudraanuvaka needs to figure in different Vedas with major part of \< mantra being the same> ? What was the \< intention> ??



Did any one explain or endorse \< Om> used in the beginning and end of
\<All Mantras> has the \<Same meaning> ? Why Tantra vidya claims different \< Mantra> as more powerful than \< Om> ? Why wrap fully or partially Vyaharutis with \< Om> ??



2. It is here that the traditional dictum and practice of Yoga that provides guidance. And all Yoga is ‘Anu-Shaasanam>. Teaching per need and qualification, on deservedness and Total benefit: Technically Called Viniyoga: The responsible act by a Guru and Shishya Together.
Mantra is Yoga guidance for use of \< Sound-Structures> for a \< Practice ; Technially Viniyoga>. The \< Mantra –Visioning = Mantra –Darshana \> is through Yoga-advancement. Only a Person of that stature and status – A Yogi, A Rushi, A drashtaa, can explain why \<Mantra has a design>.



3. When \< Mantra- upadesha> is given, there is \< NO - JIJNYASAA>. It is for \< AnuShTAnam> till \< Saakshaatkaara>. And ‘Vedas are First Mantras; And only later, a framework for Jijnyasaa ( under the tag line of Vedanta).



4. Suggestion: Instead of making a public debate on why Sapta Vyaharuti, Say Gayatri mantra by one line –two lines , total and with add on of a fourth-pada ( Paccah; ardharchashah, Poornam ; Turiyam) go for deep practice. The ‘Guhya- Tattva locked in the heart \< nihitam guhaayaaam> will unfold. To see life, postmortem is not the approach. One can dissect Mantra to its components to find only its sound- atoms and loose the entirety of its ‘ Unified Power’ ( Mantra –Shakti).
