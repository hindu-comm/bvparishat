Once a scholar on my asking as a student told me that 'svaH' involves the rest 'mahaH' etc. Is there any shastraic support to this ?

  

As I got in my childhood:

  

उत्तरे शिखरे जाते भूम्यां पर्वतवासिनि /

ब्रह्मणा समनुज्ञाते गच्छ देवि यथासुखम् //

  

Before this verse we read only up to ॐ आपो ज्योतिरसोsमृतं ब्रह्म भूर्भुवः स्वरोम् and not the rest that follows. Is it because we are from Shukla KaaNva stock ? Where is then our source of this portion of Sandhya mantras ?

  

Regards. SM
