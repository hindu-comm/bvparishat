Dear Anil,

When initially Prof Varakhedi and our list advisors offered their solidarity with you I am not sure they were aware of these issues completely. It was not mentioned on you initial mail. I have marked this mail to other members of the moderation team. If the other moderators have a different view. I am ready to change my view.





My mail was clear. BVP as mailing list is not stake holder or a party to your internal University dispute. Hence technically BVP has no locus standi. 

All ponts 1-3 are not discussed on BVP list.



If there are violence, protest and demonstrations in your campus please ask your university administrators to look into those matters. If you donâ€™t like some of your teaching faculty your universities Vice canceller is the authority not BVP mailing list.



With Regards

Sir,  
Sorry for I don't understand what you meant by ' sort it among stake holders' . I only want to bring to notice the statue issue of SSUS to the notice of BVP and want to know the opinions of the learned in such issues.Please help and guide.  
Thanking you,  
Anil Narayanan.



Respected scholars,  
Pranams..  
 Let bring before you some incidents from the history of Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit.  
  
(1) On 1993,Govt. of Kerala passed bill for SSUS and the person who burnt the bill into ashes became it's Vice chancellor later.  
  
(2) One senior professor who gave street-lectures and proclaimed that if SSUS came to existence, it will lead to social/ communal calamity and will affect secularism. He later became the PVC of the University.  
  
(3) When Prof. N.P. Unni was the Vice chancellor, some party protestors crashed and burnt the statue of Sankaracharya.  
  
 The followers of the same protestors are behind the present strike as well. These kind of activities in the campus are are always taking place with the support of the teaching staff. I believe that any person who gave any kind of support to these kind of activities are shame to the society. As a former student of the University, I can unhesitatingly state that politics (especially politics of the teaching faculty) ruins the campus/academia.  
 With regards,  
 Anil.
