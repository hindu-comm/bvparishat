Sir,  
I am now working as a guest faculty in Sanskrit and not a member of SSUS community now. I don't have any complaints against any teaching community of SSUS. Let the university authorities decide on the statue issue. Many thanks for the supports and guidance. I remain from the thread.  
With pranams,  
Anil.
