शकटिक was the word used by Sudraka for toy- cart, while a real cart is called शकट . शकटिक literally means a small cart or a little cart.

  

क्रीडनकशकट would have been a bigger word. शकटिक is as short as required forsuch purpose as you are looking for.

  

Such short words can be coined for each toy depending on what the toy is, how it looks, what it does etc.

  

But as a general word for all the toys, something likeक्रीडनक should be OK.
