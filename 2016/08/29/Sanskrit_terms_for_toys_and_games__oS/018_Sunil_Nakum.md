Respected Aklujkar Sir and All Scholars,  
  

Although Aklujkar Sir replied to my query wholeheartedly with every minute corrections, seems he misunderstood my intent, all because I did not clarify it in the beginning. Better late than never, let me try to clarify it.  

  

> You should have clarified this purpose (and the limitation of your > knowledge of Sanskrit) from the beginning of your inquiry. Nothing > wrong in having limitations. Everyone has them.  

  

My apologies to All that I did not exclusively mentioned about my very limited knowledge of Sanskrit. I have umpteen limitations from my own area of expertise and Sanskrit is way beyond that, so would never mind in accepting it.

Agree. This is the norm among almost all good forums since nobody has the extra time to spend it on novice queries. One must (re)search on his/her own and then only come to the forum. That is what I tried to follow in this case too.  
I had this tacit belief before getting your response that, usually my queries are not of scholarly standards so I did not need to mention about my limited knowledge of Sanskrit every time.

I'm sorry that I chose such words that surely hints for some big plans! There is no commercial intention, with one unfinished toy. It all started because I wanted to extend the spiritual environment to my daughter in the form of toys also. Being a father and an Engineer I've tried to accomplish this small feat. Now that it was appreciated by close friends, I'm trying to improve on it. Hosting a blog/web will need a name, and a catchy name is most desired one to get noticed into the ocean of the Internet. So I'm in search of it and started this discussion.  
  
I take it as your well wishes and blessings when you said "do something for Sanskrit if you succeed.", and this is my humble attempt to pass our great ancient heritage to the next generation, may be in the form of a very simple toy.

Thank you for the roots, I would probably need it.

No original source is cited so authenticity can be questionable, but bālaka-krīḍanaka is mentioned at several places as one of the 64 Arts. Wikipedia also lists it among 64 types of Arts.
