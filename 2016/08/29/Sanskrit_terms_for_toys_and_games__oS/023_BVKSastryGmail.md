Namaste



1. This is Contemplating further on the Professor A.A’s pointer \<
Such short words can be coined for each toy depending on what the toy is, how it looks, what it does etc. But as a general word for all the toys, something likeक्रीडनक should be OK. .. If you **describe the toy** you have designed and/or **what it is supposed to do**, the members of this multi-talented forum may be able to **suggest an appropriate name for it.** \>



2. In my little understanding the core of the issue here is same as the deep philosophical issue , which may be articulated as ‘ How do I name an entity ( Naama - kim ? )’ ? The core issue of Samjnaa-karana for a given Vyakti –Padartha –Vastu- Kriyaa.



 The suggestion by professor AA in asking the inputs of \<
description (= aakruti, guna ) , would cover the physical visual details like shape, color, size and what it is supposed to do ( =kriyaa). This surely would help in making further progress. And depending on what user wants to highlight, the Taddhita route or Krit- affixes route can be picked up. If it is a complex word, then samasa may be useful.



 In the practical case, where the word is given by user ( = Lokatah - Samjnaa), then appropriate grammar process can be used to \<Sanskritize the foreign word ! And one can be sure that these new words would be new add-ons to modern Sanskrit kozas and dictionaries ! and so may fall out of ‘ Traditional purity’ ! Monier Willimas koza -Dictionary has more than 40,000 words of ‘ M’ category which would come under this listing, waiting for Samskruth Scholars explanation for over 150 years now. >.



3. Let me try another approach with an example. How would a Samskruth scholar propose unique names for a given range of Barbie dolls ? OR Superman series toys ?



 I started Googling the words ‘toys names and pictures Hindi’ to see how regional languages have addressed this issue. Out of many links, the interesting one was from <http://www.amazon.in/MFM-Transport-Bilingual-Magnetic-Flashcards/dp/B00TO3802E>
where vehicle like toys came up. Curiosity led to another search on ‘ How would mothers look for a Sanskrit name for babies’ ? and the link for exploration came up : <http://www.momjunction.com/articles/sanskrit-baby-names-for-your-little-girl_00327835/>
. More interesting examples came up on picture-cards, flash cards and Toys marketing sites. All these resources were working on the same exercise : How to give a name to a ‘ new entity, a new product’, which is the success-key for an advertisement and product branding Creative exercise.





4. Coming to the specific, moving from philosophical challenges to practical communication and child-education issue, what would a Samskruth scholar recommend as a word for a range of ‘Barbie dolls’
which one can see in toys shops ? ( baalikaa- kreedanikaa ? ) – Each
Barbie is unique yet have a generic genus of ‘doll ( = jaati of
kreedanika) ’ and ‘ gender (= linga) ’ along with unique dress –hair style –eyes and the like ( = aakruti - vishesha). The child will easily distinguish each Barbie, without any confusion. For naming purpose, do we now suggest a long compound to be exact in the ‘ entity description with all the avachhedaka and avacchinnas’ ? OR simply give a name which child will associate with the entity ? What works for the Scholars and the advertisement team to be precise or practical ?



One may replace the above paragraph by reading ‘Krishna Doll’ in place of ‘Barbie’ to get a cultural sensitivity !



Look forward for further inputs and thoughts on making a ‘ Mortal Human practical solution (= maanushee) ’ for a philosophical problem using ‘ Language of Gods ( = Daivee) ’.

An observation:

Panini does have a sutra suggesting (इ)क suffix in the sense of expressing a diminutive.

Panini scholars may elucidate.

शकटिक was the word used by Sudraka for toy- cart, while a real cart is called शकट . शकटिक literally means a small cart or a little cart.



क्रीडनकशकट would have been a bigger word. शकटिक is as short as required forsuch purpose as you are looking for.



Such short words can be coined for each toy depending on what the toy is, how it looks, what it does etc.



But as a general word for all the toys, something likeक्रीडनक should be OK.

Sunil,  
  
I am happy to read your straightforward and candid response.  
  
A daughter whose father designs a new toy for her is lucky. May she grow to be a creative and contributing member of society!  
  
If you describe the toy you have designed and/or what it is supposed to do, the members of this multi-talented forum may be able to suggest an appropriate name for it.  
  
śubham astu sarvathā.
