Namaste,  
  

I'm really overwhelmed with the very detailed responses provided by respected scholars. As Aklujkar Sir pointed earlier that each response to my little query costs time and energy to many of the valued and more importantly kind members of the list. I'm very thankful for all the help you people have extended despite of your busy schedules. I kind of feel guilty (for raising this query) when I read an elaborate post someone has written specially for me and I'm not able to utilize it fully for my own benefit. I expected only few Sanskrit terms/names used for toys & games from Shastras, those are already answered so far (just to make it clear, the name is not yet finalized) but what I'm still getting is fully loaded information that is much beyond my knowledge and requirements. So it's my humble request to all the Vidvans, not to divert you much valued time and efforts in pursuing this query.  
  
I haven't invented any new thing, it's just a regular toy with the only twist that it has been given a touch of spirituality. The name of the particular toy I've made is a no-brainer, so we just call it **Dashavatara** puzzle. May be my initial post is not very clearly written, but I'm not looking for the name for this particular item, rather a generic term/name applicable for any type of toy(s) that might come-up in due course of time.  

  
Please allow me some time and I shall revert with more details about this.  
  

Again, I'm very much thankful to this little community for all the help.  

  

Thanks and Regards,  

Sunil
