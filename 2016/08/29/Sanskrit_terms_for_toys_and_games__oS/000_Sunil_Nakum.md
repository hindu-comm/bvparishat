Namaste,  
  
Respected Scholars,  
  

I am in the process of making a small plaything for small kids designed based on scripture. Meanwhile I'm thinking of naming it (not only this particular piece but also applicable to other items, if in future there may be other similar stuffs) based on scriptures.  
  

I was thinking about suffixing a generic name with "krida" but not very sure about it's applicability and thus seeking your help.  
  

In layman context the term "Krida" resembles to "Sports" and may not fit to playthings/toys/games, but I'm liking this word as compared to the more suitable term "Kheli" (खेलि), "Kridana" (क्रीडन). So would it be appropriate to use Krida?  

  

Also I'm looking it for sort of a Blog/Website Name, so although more fitting following terms are not going well, क्रीडाद्रव्य, विक्रीड, क्रीडावस्तु, क्रीडापरिच्छद, क्रीडन.  
  

Krida looks short and bit well known among masses.  

  
Any better options, may be indirectly relevant to games/toys from Shastras!  

  

Thanks & Regards,  

Sunil
