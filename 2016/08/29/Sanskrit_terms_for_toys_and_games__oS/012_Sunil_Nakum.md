Dear everyone,  
  

Thank you very much for the kind responses.  

  
Seems both the words Kridaniyaka/m and Kridanak/am can be used as for "plaything" per the responses pointing to different literature like Natyashastra and श्रीभार्गवराघवीयम्.  
  

From Google Books search, *A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the..* P539

Kridaniyaka should also be into Mrcchakatika as following reference about the clay cart toy can be found at the given [archive.org](http://archive.org) link page,  
  
played - Kilidam/Kriditam  
play - Kilasi/Kridsi  
  
(pardon my sanskrit knowledge)

I could find a reference under 64 types of Arts as "balaka-kridanaka - art of using children's toys" but from where it was taken is not clear.  
  

There are couple of different terms " 'पुत्थलिका'" and "केली" referred here.  
I guess पुत्थलिका is limited to Dolls or Puppets.  

Does केली only applies to Games or a broader term for playthings/toys?  

  
So finally, most vote goes to Krida\*\*\*. I'll have to spare some time to play with different combinations with this term to come-up with some catchy name.  
  
Sine it would (hopefully!) eventually go to the internet (for masses), the requirement will be to have a simpler, easy to remember and pronounce Name.  
  
If anybody have any suggestion please guide.  

  

Thanks & Regards,  

Sunil
