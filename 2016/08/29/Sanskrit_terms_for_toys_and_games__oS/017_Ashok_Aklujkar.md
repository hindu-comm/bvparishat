Your inference is correct, but please note that श्रीभार्गवराघवीय is a modern work; its use is in accordance with the ancient sources but is not itself ancient and hence should not have independent value in a historical understanding. 

  

I would also advise against capitalizing the initial of either word, unless you are going to make it the beginning of a proper noun.

  

The Mṛcchakaṭika passage you cite is originally in Prakrit. It has been recast in Sanskrit, probably by a much later scholar.

Here. kilasi/krīḍasi is a verb form. What you need is a noun derived from the same verbal root kil/krīḍ.

There are, I am sure, specific discussions of the list of 64 arts. It would be better to check the other renderings, if any, of the term bālaka-krīḍanaka. It is unlikely that using children’s toys would count for an art.

kelī, at least in the occurrences I know, is an action noun, meaning ‘act of sporting, enjoying.” To assign the concrete sense you are assigning to it, you will need to make an argument based on philology. 

  

\>So finally, most vote\[s\] goes \[—> go\] to Krida\*\*\*. I'll have to spare some time to play with different combinations with this term to come-up with some catchy name. Sine it would (hopefully!) eventually go to the internet (for masses), the requirement will be to have a simpler, easy to remember and pronounce Name. If anybody have any suggestion please guide.\<

  

You should have clarified this purpose (and the limitation of your knowledge of Sanskrit) from the beginning of your inquiry. Nothing wrong in having limitations. Everyone has them. But, unless one spells out one’s limitation(s), one does not get the desired guidance at the right level. Several specialists then spend their valuable time for one’s little gain. You will probably agree that this is not fair to your helpers. Especially if you are aiming at some commercial success (your use of “’catchy name” and “for masses” gives that impression), do something substantial for Sanskrit if you succeed. The hard-earned knowledge of Sanskritists counts for little in the contemporary world despite the preciousness of that knowledge.
