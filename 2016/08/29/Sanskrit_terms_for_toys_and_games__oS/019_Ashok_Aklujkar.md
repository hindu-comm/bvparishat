Sunil,  
  
I am happy to read your straightforward and candid response.  
  
A daughter whose father designs a new toy for her is lucky. May she grow to be a creative and contributing member of society!  
  
If you describe the toy you have designed and/or what it is supposed to do, the members of this multi-talented forum may be able to suggest an appropriate name for it.  
  
śubham astu sarvathā.
