Dear Prof. Varakhedi,  
  
I suppose you mean “play” in the sense of ‘drama, rūpaka (as in daśa rūpakas),’ not in the sense ’sport’. If so, the entire phrase krīḍanīyakam … dṛśyaṁ śravyaṁ ca’ in the Nāṭya-śāstra verse can express that sense/reference, not the word krīḍanīyakam by itself. Secondly, in the given context, the dṛśya śravya krīḍanīyaka that the nāṭya is, is something yet to be created.As such, it will not appear as a referent/reference.  
  
पुत्तलिका (this is the word form I have come across; if you have come across पुत्थलिका, I would like to know where) meaning ‘doll’ can be a specific toy. I do not think it will stand for a toy or plaything in general.  
  
a.a.
