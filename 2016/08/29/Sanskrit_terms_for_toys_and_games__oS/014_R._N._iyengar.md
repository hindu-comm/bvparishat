I am adding two ancient usages of the word **krIDa**, the first from RV the second from SkAndapurANa (Errors may please be overlooked!)

  

*parvatścinmahi vṛddho bibhāya divaścitsānu rejate svane vaḥ \| yat**krīḷatha** maruta ṛṣṭimanta āpa iva sadhryañco dhavadhve \|\|
*(V.60.3)**

  

Following SayaNa's commentary the meaning would be:

  

*Hey maruts! When you start **playing**, even the ancient big mountain fears your sound. The lofty regions of the sky tremble. Carrying spears you rush together like a stream of water.*

*  
*

*In the Prabhasa-ksetra-Maahaatmya (I part) of SP (Ch 34 v 80) the meandering River Sarasvati (before total drying up) is compared to a **playful girl child**= क्रीडनकी*

*  
*
