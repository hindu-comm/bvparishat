Namaste,  
  

I have a doubt. A child can play with play-things anywhere such as in the play-ground or inside the house or even on the bed or a table, depending on the size, weight, volume and the type of the play-thing. There is no doubt a play-thing for use in the क्रीडाङ्गन (play-ground) can be appropriately called क्रीडनक, but can the word क्रीडनक be also used for all types of play-things?  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
