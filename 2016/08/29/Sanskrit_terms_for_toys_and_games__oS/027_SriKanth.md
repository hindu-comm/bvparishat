Dear Sunil Nakum ji,

  

We haven't actually seen what you are referring to as the toy.. is it a board game or something like a ball or something that moves like a vehicle? Could you post some photograph?  

  

We could name it by its attributes, something moving, something looking like tiger, something making noise etc,, anything if we know, then naming is easy. Your daughter herself might come up with a name which later we can sanskritize it lol :)

  

See some of the sanskrit-named toys/games that comes to my mind for your inspiration :

  

chaturanga or the chess board got its name because its game where u have Castles, Horses, Elephants, Soldiers.

paramapadam has snakes and ladders and take the winner to Moksha.

kandukam is ball, I dont know how it got its name

dittha is wooden elephant.  

asvaka is wooden horse

rAsakridA is watersport
