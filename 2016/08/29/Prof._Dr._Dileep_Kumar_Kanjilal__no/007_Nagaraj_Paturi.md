If Late Prof. Bh. Krishnamurti recorded memories of his association with Prof. Burrow that might be of the kind that you are looking for.

  

Vidwan Sri Suresh Kolichala garu who is on this list should be able to have some clue in this regard.

  

Dr. Sudhibhushan Bhattacharya (? )

  

Since Sreekumar expressed doubt if the name is correct, first that should be verified and it has to be then checked if he documented his association with Prof. Burrow.
