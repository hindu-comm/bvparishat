Emenau and Burrow were INDEED two very different persons. Professor Emeneau was professor of linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley, California, while Thomas Burrow was an Englishman. You could search for their obituaries on the web, and that can give you some life stories for these two great scholars. These two were rare among western scholars who had worked on Sanskrit and Dravidian languages. Their most important collaboration was the Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Dravidian.
