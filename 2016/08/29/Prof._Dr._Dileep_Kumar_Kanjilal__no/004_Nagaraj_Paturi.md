Around four years BhK continued the work by analyzing the root of Telugu verbs and comparing the same with cognate languages. During 1951, while Krishnamurti was in Andhra University, Professor Thomas Burrow (1909-1986), Professor of Sanskrit, Oxford University, visited Waltair, Andhra Pradesh while he was doing fieldwork on Parji (1950-65) with the assistance of Dr. Sudhibhushan Bhattacharya (? ), a linguist in the Anthropological Survey of India. BhK met with them with his passion. He joined them in 1953 in Srikakulam where he could collect some notes on the Gadaba language. This is the first informal fieldwork training he got from the trained hands of linguists before he get formal training in linguistics in the USA.
