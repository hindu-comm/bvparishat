Friends,  

 My book Back on Track was launched in a function today evening at Savera Hotel in Chennai.  
  

The theme of the book is stated on the cover page and it says:  
  

"Today's world offers more opportunities as well as greater challenges than ever before. In this global village of head-spinning speed, reputations built over decades can collapse in seconds like a pack of cards. In its dizzy distractions, one can easily go astray. This book shows how to come Back on Track."  
  

The book discusses the problems of today's fast life, and suggests methods of maintaining balance in a highly destabilizing environment. It will be useful for the youth, especially students.  
  

The book is in paper cover and is priced Rs 250. Postal charges are as per actuals. Anyone interested in buying the book can send me a mail.  
  

I have attached the front and the back cover of the book.  

  

Regards,  

Dogra
