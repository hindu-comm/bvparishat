Namaste



Need to help to understand \< ब्रह्मप्राप्तिफलः \> and its connection to the previous post by Dhaval Patel ji , reading \< For Sanskrit native words, it is always फ - ओष्ठ्यवर्णः । The other is दन्त्योष्ठ्यवर्णः, influenced by Persian / Arabic kind.>



Did Arabic language borrow the Vedic rule from the context of \< बहुव्रीहौ युज्यते । यथा (सूत्रविचारः)  \>



OR



Did the later Veda –Trainers adapt the pronunciation from \< Persian/Arabic Kind> ?



**Reason for the question**: The ‘ Phala’ can be ‘ Transcendental –A-Poorva’; but the uccharana is right here and ‘ human effort’.
