Sri Sastri ji has a point. Even within the Kannada-speaking region there is variation in pronunciation of Sanskrit words. I have heard people from certain regions saying 'सौंस्कृतम्’

ಸೌಂಸ್ಕೃತಮ್. One Swamiji of the Ramakrishna order, not alive now, used to pronounce phala as fala. As to Vedic pronunciation the variation is too apparent across various regions/North/North East, Kerala, Tamilnadu, etc.
