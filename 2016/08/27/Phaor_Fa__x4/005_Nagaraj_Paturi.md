\>I want to know how to correctly pronounce फ. Is it like Pha or Fa? Example - Is it Phala orFala? I heard many Vaidikassay Pha but not Fa. Hindi speakers pronounce usually Fa.

  

Vaidikas you heard from were pronouncing correctly.

  

Hindi speakers you observed , if pronounced Arabic/Persian borrowings into Hindi such as Fariyaad, Fakeer etc. , with f they were not wrong.

  

If they pronounced phal as fal while speaking Hindi, thatcan not be called 'wrong' , can be commented as 'not so correct',and can be viewed as Arabic/Persian influence on Hindi pronunciation.

  

If they pronounced phalah as falah while reading out or reciting a Sanskrit work, that pronunciation, which is again Arabic/Persian influence,is wrong,
