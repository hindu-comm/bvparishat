Namaste



Two questions connecting all issues by Dhaval Patel ji here - \< Asking Pronunciation Question via a Text\> and \< Pha and Fa depends on transliteration scheme\> and \< फ - ओष्ठ्यवर्णः । The other is दन्त्योष्ठ्यवर्णः, influenced by Persian / Arabic kind\>



**Question 1:** What characterizes the filtering criterion to separate a \< SANSKRIT NATIVE WORD> ? 





**Question 2: How and using what rule guidance does one ‘ identify -
purify /rectify an \< influenced – infected- inflected> Sanskrit Word ? **

****

**Rules with Illustrations please to help understanding. **

****

**(P.S. I could articulate this same question differently as ‘What criterion would use to distinguish words across documents of :
paurusheya and Apaurusheya / Daivee and Maanushee / South Indian and North Indian Vedic pronunciation / Cross-veda same text with Svara variance / Samskrutham and Apabhramsha , words as given OR scripted in the given manuscript. But then it would be triggering too much of sensitivity ! **

****

**When majority of Computational Sanskrit Linguistics have preferred to stand by Roman Anglical Character based Transliteration Schema ( which is not even IPA upgraded ) to Voice the Given Sanskrit Text . And When majority of ‘Samskruth research and Teaching has violated the primary standard of ‘ Shishta –Shuddha –PaaTha’ - from ‘Patanjali’ on How to Study and Teach Samskrutham, the question assumes a greater relevance.) **

****

**There needs to be a little deeper thinking and approach to address the issue. **
