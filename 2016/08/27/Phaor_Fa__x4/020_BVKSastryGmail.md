Namaste



I am not able to understand the connection and the explanation.



Did you mean that \< neuter gender of the pratipadika – Phalam> can become \< masculine ending when it is a part of Bahuvreehi samaasa - as
ब्रह्मप्राप्तिफलः\> ? And it had nothing to do with the \< Phala = Benefit of action as in usages : karma-phala-samyogah as in Gita 5-14:
\< na kartrtvam na karmani lokasya srjati prabhuh na **karma-phala-samyogam** svabhavas tu pravartate.>



Was the primary question about the gender of the word ( –stand alone and in samaasa ) or about the articulation of the first varna in the word ? Why did the Persian/ Arabic influence on uccharanam come in between ?



I seem to have misunderstood your bringing in the word \< ब्रह्मप्राप्तिफलः \> as \< Articulation shift connected with the goal( Phala-praapti) as Brahma-Prapti> rather than limiting it to the gender issue under the Sutra. Am I right ?
