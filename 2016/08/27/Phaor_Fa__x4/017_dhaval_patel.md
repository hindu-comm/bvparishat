My attempt at answer is as follows

\> Question 1: What characterizes the filtering criterion to separate a \< SANSKRIT NATIVE WORD> ?   
\>

Something which is not mentioned in kozas or traditional literature may be treated as non native. Vice versa fo native.

\> Question 2: How and using what rule guidance does one ‘ identify -
purify /rectify an \< influenced – infected- inflected> Sanskrit Word ?  
\>  

There are no influenced Sanskrit words. Speaker may be influenced. Grammar and shiksha text seem to be clear about फ being ओष्ठ्य. There is no need to pronounce any Sanskrit word with फ as दन्त्योष्ठ्य.  
When you are pronouncing foreign words in Sanskrit like proper noun e.g. Faraah Khan, you use the pronounciation system of that language as far as possible. There is no need to Sanskritize it.
