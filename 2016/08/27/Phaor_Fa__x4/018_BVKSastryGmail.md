Namaste



On \< **the impact of English on Indian vernaculars**. Children taught through English medium are **habituated now to commit this mistake**.
Whenever such students read vernacular texts they read like that. **This habit is almost naturalised**. \>



***Question:*** IS there a MANUAL and TRAINING SYSTEM in VOGUE -
providing STANDARD OF VOICE TRAINING for SAMSKRUTHAM ? Any School or Gurukul teaching this way the START UP (SIMPLIFIED ? ) SAMSKRUTHAM ? – In Regional Languages or Anglicized Media OR even the VEDIC GURUKULS ?
( *to invoke the Ramayana Sampradaya* : **konvasmin Saampratam loke…** )



IF we have where are they ? If not when- where- how- why did we loose this ? in Post Patanjali, period which said : ‘ Shabdaah ..
Shuddhah … updaishyante..Pathyante’ )



Should not such Training be a Unified Approach for VOICING as well as LISTENING –SOUND MEMORY COMPARISON – RECALL> 



And how should a nirukta class be designed to be sensitive to voiced input –analysis, if the current Samskruth Text Reading is so deviant and defective ?
