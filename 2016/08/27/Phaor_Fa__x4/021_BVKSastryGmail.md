Namaste



Before responding further on your post below, I seek additional clarifications from you.



**From:** [bvpar...@googlegroups.com]() \[mailto:[bvpar...@googlegroups.com]()\] **On Behalf Of** dhaval patel

**Subject:** RE: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Re: 'Pha'or 'Fa



My attempt at answer is as follows

\> Question 1: What characterizes the filtering criterion to separate a \< SANSKRIT NATIVE WORD> ?   
\>

Something which is **not mentioned** in kozas or traditional literature may be treated as non native. Vice versa fo native.

^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry (on not mentioned )** : The argument does not appear to be a necessary and sufficient criterion. Where does one draw a time line for ‘ kozas’ ? Compared to Amara kosha, later Kozas – and more so Monier Williams Sanskrit Dictionary contains newer words. The word ‘Sanganaka’, Doora-darshanam’ of previous century , would not appear in earlier kozas or traditional literature. And for this reason, should they be run out ? How many new words are \<Sanskritized> and \< formed>
in Samskrutha- Doordarshan news broad cast ? And how are they covering the ‘ native’ language words ? Would one then classify Samskruth as a \< Language of Closed Vocabulary> ? Dead because it cannot ‘Generate’
sensitive and relevant new social words – an argument used by Sheldon Pollock ?

Similarly for the criterion of ‘ traditional literature’ ? Would the latest Samskrutha kavyas which received the national award be considered as ‘ traditional literature’ by a time line or content ? What is the criterion to fix the stamp of ‘Tradition – Traditional – Traditional literature’?

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

\> Question 2: How and using what rule guidance does one ‘ identify -
purify /rectify an \< influenced – infected- inflected> Sanskrit Word ?  
\> There are **no influenced Sanskrit words**. Speaker may be influenced. **Grammar and shiksha text** seem to be clear about फ being ओष्ठ्य. There is no need to pronounce any Sanskrit word with फ as दन्त्योष्ठ्य.  
When you are pronouncing foreign words in Sanskrit like proper noun e.g. Faraah Khan, you use the pronounciation system of that language as far as possible. There is no need to Sanskritize it.

^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry (on no influenced Sanskrit words ? )** : Invoking Grammar and Shikshaa texts as Standards needs a careful consideration and qualifying remark. So is the point of \< Foreign words – pronunciation-Sanskritizing \>.

I do not see a ‘ Samskrutham - Shikshaa Traditional continuity ’ as a live –flowing standard ! even in the heartland of veda education – be it Ahmedabad , Hyderabad or Karnataka. Some parts of Kerala seem to be
using it for their own Veda –Shaakhas. Training to read ‘Bhagavatam- Purana Katha ’ is NOT the same as training to ‘Recite Vedas with Purity of Voice and Purpose’.

Unless one is confusing and mistaking the \< listen –repeat :: Uccharana –Anoocchaarana sampradaya of Vedas in Gurukul> as \< Shikshaa Proper Training>. It is NOT. Imitation and repetition of ‘ as heard ( = Shrutasya uccharanam) is NOT ‘VOICE –CULTURING and TRAINING ( = Varna –Ucchaarana SAMSKAARA) which meets the Taittiriya Upanishad criterion of Training for proper articulation of \<Varna –swara-maatraa –bala –saama –santaana \>. There are special texts called ‘Veda-Lakshanam’ to deal with this issue and scholars like Dr. P.Ramaujam have spoken of this at different occasions. Training students on this part is a different pedagogy and life time work than creating an ‘ awareness of existence of such a tradition’.

In my understanding this traditional pedagogy of ‘ Veda-Lakshanam/ Mantra-Brahmana shikshana Paddhati / Vak-Yoga Sampradaya ‘ of
Yoga-Samskrutham Training = Vedanga Shikshna Paddhati’ went underground at least three centuries ago in India. What is still in ‘ ICU –COMA state practice in Veda-Guru kulas is ‘ use of ‘BHASHAANGA SHIKSHANA for VEDANGA –CHANDAS SHIKSHANA’. This is technically falling out of compliance with the Vedic Standards of pronunciation.

Shikshaa is used for ‘Bhashaa’ Part of Samskrutham; And PRATISHAAKHYAM is SPECIAL ADVANCED SHIKSHAA for CHANDAS part of SAMSKRUTHAM. The
‘SHIKSHAA’ training system of ‘BHASHAA and CHANDAS’ parts of PANINIYA-SAMSKRUTHAM got corrupted by the ‘DESI –Language Phonetics ( = Praakrutham, Dramidam(= Tamil) , Apabhramsha, Mleccha) in stages and phases first; and then with Anglicized Phonetics in the later period’. First one was National level dismembering and dys-functionality; Second was International mal-functionality .

The combined power of both these dysfunctionality and malfunctioning distortions are impacting the ‘ VEDA – SHABDA –Shuddha UCCHARANA = True ‘Mantra’-Pronunciation of the Traditional (Vedic /Samskruth) Word’. Obvious consequence of this, being ‘ Bad –pronunciation leads to Bad and Inaccurate rule invoking and processing diagnostics ( The hall mark of Sanskrit Computational Linguistics studies) and leads to complex challenges of \< filtering criterion for Sanskrit Words> : A standard used by Indology ( Swadesi as well as Videshi Teams) to their preferred advantages in Battle: Sanskrit.

When both warring teams violate the standard norms like the ‘ enforcement of nocturnal war ( = raatri-yuddha) ’ in Mahabharata, the call of Dharma-Standards Audit become very difficult. Especially when one side invokes the \< Grammar and shiksha texts \> as referendum.

Yes, it is a sad state of in-house affair; But I would be totally open for correction if I am wrong on any statement above.
