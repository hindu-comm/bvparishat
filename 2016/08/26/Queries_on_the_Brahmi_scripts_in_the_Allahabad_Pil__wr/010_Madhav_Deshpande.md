Dear Sunilji,

  

  For whatever it is worth, scholars who have analyzed the linguistic features of inscriptional Prakrits, Pali and Ardhamagadhi, have concluded that while Ardhamāgadhi shares some features of the eastern inscriptional Prakrits, Pali is closer to the inscriptional Prakrits found in the western regions like Girnar in Saurashtra, and is relatively remote from the inscriptional Prakrits found in the eastern region of Magadha. Whether the Buddha himself spoke Pali is a difficult question linguistically, though the Theravada tradition asserts that view. Historically, the Buddhist canonical texts were transmitted in multiple Prakrits (including Pali, Gandhari Prakrit, and Apabhraṃśa) and forms of (more or less vernacularized) Sanskrit, and the Pali canon represents one of the off-shoots.
