Dear Sunilji,

  No inscriptions of Ashoka are in Pali or Ardhamagadhi, but they are in regional dialects of Prakrits that are more archaic than the Prakrits described by the grammarians and found in the Pali canon and in theJain canon. Prof M A Mehendale has anpublished intensive study of the inscription all Prakrits.
