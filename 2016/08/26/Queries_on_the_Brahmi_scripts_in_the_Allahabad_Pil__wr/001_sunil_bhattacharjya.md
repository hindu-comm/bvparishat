Dear scholar friends,  
  

Further to the two queries, please permit me to add one more for the linguist / historians. I understand that some of the Ashokan inscriptions have been written Ardha-Magadhi and some in Pali, (I am not taking into account those in Kharosthi). Has any scholar aware of which Ashokan imscriptions are in Pali and which are in Ardha-Magadhi? Kindly do not hesitate to correct me if I have made any mistake in framing the queries.  
  

Regards,
