Dear Madhavji,  
  

Thank you for your observations. What you said, sounds reasonable. Ashoka Maurya ruled not only from Magadha, he ruled from Kashmir also. Rajatarangini supports that Shortly after him, Kanishka ruled his (Kanishka's) vast empire from Kashmir. Kanjshka's inscription has been found in Sanchi. Ashvaghosha was a contemporary of Kanishka and that time was probably also the beginning of the Buddhhist-hybrid Sanskrit.
The inscriptions of that time could have been nearer to Pali. Further, there are the inscriptions in the Barabar caves in Orissa attributed to Ashoka Maurya's grandson, and that means these Barabar inscriptions should also be in language nearer to Pali.  
  

The inscriptions of the later-day Ashoka should be nearer to Ardha-Magadhi. I am yet to see Prof Talim's book. I hope she has addressed this issue. However I have one doubt. It appears from the report on her book, Prof. Talim follows the ancient Indian chronology, framed by the distortionist colonial historians.  
  

Regards,
