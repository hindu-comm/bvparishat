Thank you again Madhavji, for the references. I got the first two from DLI. I shall look for the third, elsewhere.  
  
Lord Buddha preached in the Prakrit of his time and that language came to be known as the Pali, the language that nurtured the Hiayana (small vehicle) buddhist literature. Ashoka Maurya ruled about three centuries after the demise of Lord Buddha. The same way Lord Mahavira talked in Ardha-Magadhi and two centuries after his demise the Jaina literature started appearing in that language. Around that time the second Ashoka came to power.  
  
My historical studies gave me to understand that Lord Buddha and Lord Mahavira lived twelve centuries apart and that wheter Pali or Ardha-Maadhi or any other forms of Prakrit, all are different evolutions of Prakrit at different times and may be called by different names for chronological identification.  
  

Regards,
