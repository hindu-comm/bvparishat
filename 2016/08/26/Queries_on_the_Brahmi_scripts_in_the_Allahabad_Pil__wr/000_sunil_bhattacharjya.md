Dear friends,  
  

May be the historians and the epigraphists like Tapatiji would appreciate the following queries. In the Allahabad pillar the upper inscription is claimed to be in the early Brahmi script and the lower inscription is claimed to be in the late Brahmi script. The upper inscription of Ashoka mentions his victory in the Kalinga war but none of his inscritions found in Kalinga / Orissa refer to the Kalinga war.
The lower inscription of Samudragupta is totally silent about the
Kalinga war and it goes on to say that the several kings of Dakshinapatha including the king Gopaditya of Kanchi were defeated, but their kingdoms were returned to them (as if out of the conqueror's magnanimity). I understand that there is also the contrary report that Samudragupta lost to the Pallava king Gopaditya and had to give up his dream of conquering the southern part of India. Now the following questions arise:  

  
1)  
In what way the features of the two Brahmi scripts in the Allahabd Pillar differ and is there any research report / published paper on this?  
2)  

What was the political status of Kalinga after the Mauryas and before the Guptas?  
  

Regards
