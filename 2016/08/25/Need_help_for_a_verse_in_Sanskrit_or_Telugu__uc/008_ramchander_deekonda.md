Shri Vidvan Nagaraja Paturi garu,

  

The explanation provided for the phrase (Stri-sudra-dvijabandhunam) by you here is from Srila Prabhupada's purport of this verse (1:4:25) of SrimadbhAgavatam. Srila Prabhupada convincingly explains this verse beautifully. I am sure the full purport would help us to appreciate the true spirit of the verse.
