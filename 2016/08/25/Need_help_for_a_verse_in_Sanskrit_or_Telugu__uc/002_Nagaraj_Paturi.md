Full verse is given as

  

स्त्री-शूद्र-द्विजबन्धूनां  
त्रयी न श्रुति-गोचरा\|  
कर्म-श्रेयसि मूढानां  
श्रेय एवं भवेद् इह\|  
इति भारतम् आख्यानं  
कृपया मुनिना कृतम्\|\|

  

It says, without quoting the source, that

  

The friends of the twice-born families are those who are born in the families of *brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas* and *vaiśyas,*or the spiritually cultured families, but who themselves are not equal to their forefathers.
