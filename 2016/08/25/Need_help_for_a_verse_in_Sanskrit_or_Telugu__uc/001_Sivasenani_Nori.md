Sir

  

Regarding your query about the term द्विजबन्धुः the intended meaning is somebody who is not a dvija (and is hence grouped with those who have no adhikAra for Veda). Terms like ब्रह्मबन्धुः, क्षत्रबन्धुः are often used in the sense of "somebody who is not himself a Brahmana or Kshatriya, but only related to them". This is the first time I heard the word dvijabandhu, but the context shows that the composer intended to mean something similar.

  

There was a discussion on BVP some years back:<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/samskrita/Y5OY0vygWmo>

  

Regards

N. Siva Senani
