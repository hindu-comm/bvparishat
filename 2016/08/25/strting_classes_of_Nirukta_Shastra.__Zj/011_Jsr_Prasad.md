प्रमादो धीमतामपि । I appreciate res. Acharyaji's spirit for two reasons:  
- at this age he continue to teach from his forte and,  
- being a septuagenarian, he uses new age computer to reach us to send invitations

I would turn a septuagenarian or octogenarian in future, if I could live for so many years to come. Let's restrain from discussing aging problems please. Rather, we'd look at the bhaava than bhaaShaa.
