With due respect, I disagree with Prof. Paturi. Dr. Acharya did send another email with Hindi and Sanskrit. If he wrote in English also, that's a plus. Rather than requesting septuagenarian scholars who have extensively published to get their English checked, I believe we should ignore a typos/grammatical slip here or there. It should not matter.

  

Also, rather than "weak in English", I would say "not that familiar with English".
