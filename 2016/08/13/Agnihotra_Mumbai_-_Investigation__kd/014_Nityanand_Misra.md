I think there are two aspects to such situations. On the one hand, if a person may have several valid reasons (e.g. respecting somebody's privacy) behind not revealing all details of a private communication between him/her and another person. At the same time, this is what makes a claim based on a private communication in which the source/correspondent is not revealed slightly problematic: the reader has to trust the claim without any means to cross-verify it and sceptic readers may be reluctant to do it.
