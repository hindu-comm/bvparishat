Dear Anandji,  
  
The Geologists of IIT Bombay seems to have given the explanation and such water need not necessarily be salty as temporarily it forms the upper layer. The people of KEM to whom you wrote could have also been baffled and they wanted to wait till the problem is investigated, It is not necessary that KEM should have had a ready answer.  
  

Regards,
