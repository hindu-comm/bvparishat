Please give the website address about the geologists.

Secondly explaining the phenomenon is not the point .

The scientists in this case the doctor ,started with a hypothesis . That hypothesis needs to be tested to a conclusion .

That is what they did not do .That is the problem .This is same in the agnihotra issue .

Instead of conducting and finishing the experiment we keep intellectualising the issue .That is the problem .
