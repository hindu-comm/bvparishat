For example take the idiom crab mentality .

**  
**

**Wikipedia -Crab mentality**, sometimes referred to as**crabs in the bucket**(also barrel, basket or pot), is a way of thinking best described by the phrase, "if I can't have it, neither can you."^([\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_mentality#cite_note-Wilder2015-1))The metaphor refers to a bucket of[crabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab "Crab"). Individually, the crabs could easily escape from the bucket, but instead they grab at each other in a useless "[king of the hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_the_Hill_(game)#Use_as_a_metaphor "King of the Hill (game)")" competition which prevents any from escaping and ensures their collective demise. - Wikipedia

  

So many people use this phrase and vouch for it , little knowing that crabs do not exhibit this behavior at all .

  

One small experiment and the idea is killed once and for all .

This is what I call as scientific temperament .
