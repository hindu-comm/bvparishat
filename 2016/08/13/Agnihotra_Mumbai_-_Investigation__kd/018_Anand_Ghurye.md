One observation about the series of questions , it is following Socratic line of questioning rather than Khandan Mandan Method of Shakara which should have been the natural choice for Bharatiya group .

In Khandan Mandan rather than who said , what is being said and does it come correct on tests of logic and experience takes front seat.
