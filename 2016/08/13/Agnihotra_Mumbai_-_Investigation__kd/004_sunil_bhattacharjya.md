Geologists at the [Indian Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Technology "w:Indian Institute of Technology") in [Bombay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay "w:Bombay") and M.D. Zingde, the head of the Mumbai office of the [National Institute of Oceanography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Oceanography_%28India%29 "w:National Institute of Oceanography (India)") explained that the water turning sweet in Mahim Creek was a natural phenomenon. Continuous rainfall over the preceding few days had caused a large pool of fresh water to accrue in an underground rock formation near to the coast, which then discharged into the sea as a large "plume" as fractures in the rocks widened. Because of the differences in density, the discharged fresh water floated on top of the salt water of the sea and spread along the coast. Over time, the two mixed to become normal sea water once more.
