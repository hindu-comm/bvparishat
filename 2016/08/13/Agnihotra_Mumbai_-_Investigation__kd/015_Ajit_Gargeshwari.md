Exactly, It’s always good to post well documented information and if one wants to post information which is private it’s better to say that while posting. ( For instance I cannot reveal more information as research is still in progress, in a private conversation I had with a reputed scholar etc). This will avoid multiple postings without much information for members to read or comment.

I think there are two aspects to such situations. On the one hand, if a person may have several valid reasons (e.g. respecting somebody's privacy) behind not revealing all details of a private communication between him/her and another person. At the same time, this is what makes a claim based on a private communication in which the source/correspondent is not revealed slightly problematic: the reader has to trust the claim without any means to cross-verify it and sceptic readers may be reluctant to do it.
