<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Mumbai_sweet_seawater_incident>  

  

The salty water in Mahim creek turned sweet . People Thousands thronged to the beach to taste the water . They drank the water , they bottled the water and took it home.

  

The head of KEM hospital wrote a half page article in a leading daily , denouncing this so called miracle . He said " A lot of garbage flows into the sea at this point , may be some chemical also got mixed in the garbage , which has caused the water to turn sweet . However this water is a health hazard and there will be a breakout of all kinds of waterborne diseases if people consume this water . " The municipality also issued warnings against drinking this water .

  

Still in the two days that the water was sweet , thousands , if not lakhs consumed this dirty , bacteria infested , health hazard water. After two days the water turned salty again and the euphoria waned .

  

Nobody talked about it later on .

  

My point was , that if the water was so dirty , and so many warnings were given against drinking it , there should be a marked increase in hospital admissions due to waterborne diseases , in Mumbai in general and in neighboring areas in particular as thousands had consumed it .

  

I checked and enquired , but no such spike in admissions or drug sales was observed . This meant people did not get sick on large scale .

  

This requires scientific investigation . Nobody did that .

  

I wrote to the news paper , to head of KEM and so on , but they did not even respond .

  

This I say is \*NOT\* scientific temperament . And those who do not have scientific temperament , have no right to speak about science .
