Dear BVK , Namaskar!



I like this part of your posting.



"Samskrutham is a ‘ peculiar and unique language’ where modification of a single sound or accent, join or break of a word, sound can toss the meaning from south to North !"



The following story supports your observation of Sanskrit.



Manu wanted a son but his wife wanted a daughter. When Yajna was performed, a daughter was born. Manu got upset. After making complaint, it was realized that Hotr made mistake in mantra.(Here north pole became south pole). Then when Hotr corrected his mistake and lo, daughter Ilaa changed into Sudyumna, a son (here south pole became north pole).



This story is from a Purana. Indrashatru story became old, so I gave you a new story. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
