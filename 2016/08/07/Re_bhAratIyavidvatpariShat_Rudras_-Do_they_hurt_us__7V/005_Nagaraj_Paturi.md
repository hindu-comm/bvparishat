1\. For the deities that are both malevolent and benevolent, examples from the Indian (particularly south Indian) folk culture are the village goddesses. Names of many of these goddesses are the names of the diseases that strike as epidemics. My article on village goddesses is

“Environment As woman: a new perspective towards Village Goddess worship” :Paryaavarana Bhaarati, Journal of Environmentalist Studies Society for Information and Dissemination on Environment ( Telugu)March-May,1994

Is nature /environment malevolent or benevolent? Each village goddess can be shown to be personification of the village ecosystem of the respective village. The natural disasters are viewed as the 'anger' of the goddess and the natural prosperity is viewed as her 'happiness' (blessing).

2. Puranic /Agamic 'Hindu' culture is the result of fusion of Vedic and folk cultures. Puranic Devi has sources both in the folk deities such as village goddesses and the Vedic Devi concepts. Malevolence-benevolence duality is common in both the sources. Puranic Shiva too has sources both in Vedic and folk cultures. One of the sources of Puranic Shiva is Vedic Rudra.

3. Just as several different village goddesses are seen in plural but are viewed as the multiple manifestations of the same Deviconcept, several different Rudras are viewed as the multiple manifestations of the same Rudra concept. It is this Rudra in all Rudras, that contributes the Puranic Shiva. 11 Rudras is 11 categories of the numerous /innumerable Rudras. Puranic Shiva's association with devolution function of the trimurti set is well known. Devolution is quite often misunderstood as 'destruction'.A more nuanced 'Hindu' understanding of 'destruction' helps understanding the malevolence of Rudra(s) , Devi(s) etc.
