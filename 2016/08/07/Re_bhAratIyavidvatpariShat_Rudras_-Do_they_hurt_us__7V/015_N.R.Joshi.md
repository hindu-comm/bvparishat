Dear Prof S. Korada, Saadar PraNaam!



Thank you for your explanation about Vedic mantras and right way to understand them. Did not Yaask talk about Kutsa saying Vedic mantras make no sense. It looks to me such kind of doubts and questions were raised from the time to time-it could be even before the time of Yaask.

Mantras were remembered and saved hundreds of years after the original geographical setting and environment underwent many changes.Ealier people passed away. So their understandingcontinued becoming dilute century after century. In Nighantu many different words are listed carrying the same meanings. It is still great achievement of Vedic and Sanskrit scholars through ages to save valuable treasure of mantras from Vedas. Thank you again. N.R.Joshi
