Dear Dr Sadashiva Murty Rani

  

\>\>\>

These are a few observations collected from various pursuits and practical studies on Agnihotra undertaken by some Indian and Western Scientists.



These studies and similar studies of this nature inspired Prof. Sai Gopal, Prof. Hussain and some other Scientists of the Atmospheric Department of Sri Venkateswara University to undertake further studies on Agnihotra.

\<\<\<\<

  

Please share any published literature that you may have on this subject.

  

Thx

  

Dr Yadu
