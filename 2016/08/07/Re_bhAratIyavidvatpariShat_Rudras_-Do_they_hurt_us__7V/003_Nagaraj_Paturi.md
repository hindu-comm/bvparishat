The book under question does not characterise Rudra only in plural nor just as micro-organisms.

  

The question 'do they hurt us or bless us?' is already answered by saying that god has both benevolent and malevolent aspects.

  

The following is what the book has got to say about Rudra (Part 1 pg 5):

  

***Rudra *– The god**

**

*Rudra *is a relatively minor deity in the *Ṛgveda*. He is the *devatā *for the following mantras

(referenced by *Maṇḍala*, *Sūkta*, and *Ṛk*):



1.43.1-6 (6 *Ṛks*)

1.114.1-11 (Entire *Sūkta *of 11 *Ṛks*)

2.33.1-15 (Entire *Sūkta *of 15 *Ṛks*)

5.4211 (one *Ṛk*)

7.46( 1- 4) (Entire *Sūkta *of 4 *Ṛks*)

5.59.11 (one *Ṛk*)



Thus the *Ṛgvedasaṃhitā *contains only 38 *Ṛks *(out of 10,552) addressed to *Rudra*. Some of

these *Ṛks *appear in the *Rudram *in a modified form, as will be pointed out later. *Rudra *is often associated with the *Maruts*, and is considered to be their father. Interestingly

there are both benevolent and malevolent aspects of *Rudra*. Here is a brief summary of the

characteristics associated with these aspects:



Benevolent:

Bountiful, bestows blessings

Unsurpassed in might

Ever youthful and lord of the world

Has healing powers (in fact he is referred to as शर्षक्, the physician)



Malevolent:

Fierce and destructive

Implored not to slay or injure worshippers and their clan and cattle



The physical basis for *Rudra *is uncertain – he appears to be associated with the destructive forces of the storm and lightning, but occasionally identified with the sun (*Rudram *1.7-9) (emphasis mine)

  

In the *anuvākas *that contains (sic)the *Ṛks *(1, 10, and 11), both the benevolent and malevolent aspects of *Rudra *are mentioned and he is also identified with the sun in the first *anuvāka*. The remaining *anuvākas *(*Yajus*) glorify the all-pervasive nature of *Rudra*. This indicates that these were two distinct compositions (perhaps by different people) which were later combined in such a way that the *Yajus *was inserted between the *Ṛks.*
