Excellent researches are being conducted on Ancient Indian sciences, Indian culture and Sanskrit across India and worldwide by various research organisation and by independent researchers. There is no reason to despair. There is no reason as you say traditional scholars have to do handmade researches for business enterprises. Traditional or Non traditional researches there is no such differentiation. All are researchers. If one is a part of the system there are enough places and forums where out of the box thinking is encouraged and good researches are funded. One has to realise there is always an X amount which has to be distributed to N number of people. If one is not a part of the system they often tend to make too much noise which is good for social media but has little or no relevance for researchers. I think we have digressed enough from the subject line and will look forward to any proven paper or book which answers the doubts raised about subject line of the thread.

Regards

Ajit
