Namaste



Combining several points in posts below: The primary questions that emerges would be to ‘Define what is Research and its objective in tradition. ( This is pushing further Dr. Yadu’s single pointed focus on Viniyoga: Application with a relevance, here and now). If we don’t acknowledge the issue, we cannot proceed further to defend or deny it: 



a) What qualifies to be defined as the concept and validation of ‘ Scientific Investigation (Vijnana of Shaastra –Darshana) according to ‘ ancient Indian Knowledge sources’, which might yield ‘demonstrable scientific evidence ( Pratyaksha darshana - Pramana) through a ‘ Technical Application (Viniyoga) ? In other words: Why Research in Traditional disciplines ? How ?



b) What would snugly fit in to the frame of ‘ ancient Indian Knowledge sources of positive sciences’ and positively answer the guidance provided by Dr.Roddam Narasimhan, as ‘ sensible knowledge to be fed to youth ? – for a pride? For a livelihood ? For defending the tradition ? In other words, How confident are we about our own capture and continuity of ‘tradition-practice-benefits’ beyond ‘ belief’ ?



**For example and to be more specific**: What would one call a ‘Research ( =Samshodhana) in Ancient Indian Sky observation Astro Science –covering Astronomy and Astrology in a ‘ twined and twisted way’ , which is positioned under the discipline of Vedanga Jyotisha, a unified discipline of Science of Material phenomenon and Mystic intuition with ‘ believe relevance for life-applications’ ? Can a modern Astro-Lab which needs no referencing to Veda or Samskrutham, be of help to do research in Jyotisha and fix an issue –say ‘Ayanamsha, Tithi, Grahana, Ekaadashi Nirnaya ? Yes, No, May be. To what extent the handshake is valuable ?



What would one call a ‘Research (=Samshodhana) in Life-Vision Sciences,
covering physical, psychic and Spiritual Health care in a unified approach as Ayur-Veda ? And use advances in the sophistry of ‘Body investigation procedures ( like X-Ray, MRI, Drug Chemistry) which come as Material –Property Sciences, which do not need any ‘Veda –Samkhya darshana conditionality of Dravya –Guna-Karma –Prakruti – Tridosha-Prana -Ayush’??



If there is no such concept in current sciences Or education system, what prevents the scholars of tradition and (Indian -?) Institutions established for promoting tradition to have a pro-active leadership
role and conduct Systemic and Systematic investigation by ‘ investment in the right direction ( beyond concrete jungles and peripheral posts )
rather than continue to be a party to \< blind defense games - irrational blindness to a unique legacy \>? Andhenaiva neeyamaanaa yathaandaah : Blind leading the blind?



Relevant extracts below:



**Nagaraj Paturi**: \< I am defender of possibility but one cannot keep defending the impossible \>



**Ajit Gargeswari**: \< Ancient Indians had made good progress in science That does not mean one should start extrapolating and twisting data and prove matters which cannot be proved beyond doubt and call it research and say accept this research else you are anti Indian or not a defender of our culture. This same logic hold about Indian Astrology. Still many respectable scholars believe astrology should be made compulsory and if all learn and appreciate astrology it will solve the malice facing society. Please note I am for making systematic investigation on astrological texts. \> \< .. are translation of a few puranic passages which is good as far as the story, importance of yajna in the mythological settings. They are not to be considered as demonstrable scientific evidences \>

**Rani Sadshiva murthy**: \< a mere intention to trace out any such references from our belief system in support of the Agnihotra's \> \< .. our ancient Indian knowledge sources of any positive sciences are five fold: 1. Vedas 2. Puranas and Itihasas 3. Independent Treatises 4. Interdisciplinary References and 5. Kavyas. .. In all these FIVE areas either explicitly or suggestively the scientific knowledge has been transmitted from one generation to the next till it reached us. ..I request you to read my previous mail once again. Nowhere I ventured to call them practicable scientific evidences (Demostrable scientific evidences in your words). But I left the choice to the readers to call them either belief system or knowledge system.>



**Roddam Narasimhan (from **<http://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/108/04/0471.pdf> **) **: \< The centre of the controversy was a symposium on ‘Ancient science through Sanskrit’, organized for the Congress essentially by a group of Sanskrit scholars and academics. It is high time we learnt once again to distinguish science from mythology (either can be fun, but they are best when not mixed), evidence-based reasoning from unthinking acceptance of authority or speculation, and the rational from the superstitious (realizing that a full life may not be purely rational: consider Ramanujan, for example). To make that happen is a responsibility that scientists here must accept, working in close collaboration with friendly outsiders. Our youth are hungry for a sensible knowledge of our past, but are denied an opportunity to acquire it by a marvellous educational system that shuns history in science curricula, and by the paucity of attractive but reliable accounts of the fascinating history of Indic ideas. Our academies, universities, museums and other institutions need to make such a project a national mission. Anything less would be irrational blindness to a unique legacy. \>

I did not say this happened in this thread. It happens always many a times and there is enough evidence to prove it does happen outside the list and there might be a tendency that this might happen in this list. This is my thought. I am defender of possibility but one cannot keep defending the impossible.
