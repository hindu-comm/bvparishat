Respected Nagaraj Garu,

My expected fear has come true. It is no doubt that those are your lines that made me to participate in this thread. But it is not with any intention to declare war against a respected scholar like you but with a mere intention to trace out any such references from our belief system in support of the Agnihotra's use in environmental purification. As a result some of the passages that I came across I presented here.

Pranams,

RANI SADASIVA MURTY
