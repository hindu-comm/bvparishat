You are right this whole discussion in not worthwhile If a rational explanation is not given then one starts attributing causes of such causes to supernatural powers and start myth making and spread superstitious beliefs. There may be instances in an experiment conducted deviations are shown from standard results. That does not mean science is at fault but only proves that the process on interpreting results is at fault or the hypothis may have to be reconsidered to cover the deviations. Now if Agnihotra is the savoir lets all perform Agni hotra and start living in areas where there are poisonous gases and prove we can live. If out 10 people 9 survive then one can reconsider scientific explanation but if out 100 million one survive there is no need to relook into science.
