Ajit ji..

I am not against the content of the context. When it is superstitious it can definitely be condemned by us all.

My concern is to object such generalization made by Yaduji... "Indians are champions in creating Mystery around rituals."

A few people if hold any superstitious thoughts can we generalize it saying that all Indians are superstitious?
