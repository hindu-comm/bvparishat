I don’t think one needs to support superstitious and false beliefs. I would like to know what point does Prof Rani Sadashivamurty intends to convey instead of simply condemning superstitious and irrational beliefs. I feel scholarly believers and propagators or irrational beliefs are more dangerous than ignorant Indians who believe in irrationality. Why should one interact with such scientists or so called scientists who make controversial claims and propagates such claims and have intentions to drive India to middle ages. I am not saying impartial and good researches should be conducted on Indian sciences and progress Indians had achieved but is this the way to go forward is the question one needs to ask. Thanks
