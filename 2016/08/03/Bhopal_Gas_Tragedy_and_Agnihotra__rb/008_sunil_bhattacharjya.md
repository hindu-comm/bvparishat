Dear Venkata Sriramji,  
  

I supported Yaduji that there should be reliable enquiry, with authentication. I also made some suggestions on the ways the investigation can be started, The only difference between Yaduji's and my approaches has been that I am an optimistic person desiring authentication, whereas Yaduji seems to be sceptical on this issue.  
  

Regards,
