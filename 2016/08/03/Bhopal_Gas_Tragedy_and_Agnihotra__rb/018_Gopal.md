namaste.  
  

Thanks Sriramji for your excellent note. Were you able to get the reference of the richaas involved int he asthi=sandhNa-mantra? If so, kindly share them with me. You had mentioned it 6 years back when we met....  

  

In the last two years, when Mr. Cho Ramaswamy, a veteran journalist from chennai, was hospitalized with severe illness , his well-wishers had a few lakh aavarthi of of Rig veda 10.161 performed (Munchami tva havisha). This sukta prayoga has been suggested for ayush vriddi and maaraka rodhana).  Mr. Cho Ramaswamy is back home for the last year or so. It is to be noted here that Mr. Ramaswamy has a deep-rooted faith in vedic samskraras. Rig veda 10.162 prayoga is prescribed for Garbha raksha at early stages of pregnancy. three generations back, there were some madhwa families who were known to use this for the purpose in Udumalaipet, Tamilnadu area.  
  

It is stated that Rig mantraas by the rishis are of "high and low" reaches. The argument that Shounaka uses for Rig vidhana had been stated by a few in the past as: if the rig mantraas are potent to lead someone to the status of rishis ("high" reaches), the complement is also true that they can be applied to obtain material gains ("low" reaches).
This view point has been used to enunciate various prayoga-prescriptions in his Rig vidhaana. This work supposedly pre-dates the texts of
other, "non-scientific" domain of Tantraas.  
  

In science, the starting point is an hypothesis followed by a sincere (shraddha-purvak) effort, following the appropriate methods and materials, to prove or disprove it. Mere speculations based on existing knowledge, however hard-earned it could be, does not justify calling a hypothesis right or wrong. If one wants to approach the topic of efficacy of mantraas in a scientific way, then the first step would be to identify the appropriate methods etc. In any scientific endeavor, it is also necessary to state and understand "prior existing knowledge" before deriving a hypothesis. Again, even for this an unbiased, due diligence is recommended as against an opinionated, merely speculative outlook.  
  
Just because something is said in tradition, it need not be unscientific. May be our knowledge of right means to find out and/or understand the underlying process may be one of the factors contributing to our confusion. For example, it is generally known that the place and method of growth of herbs determine the efficacy of the medical concoctions as described in some texts of Ayurvedha. Now, using soil and rhizosphere Microbiome studies, it has been published that grape vines from the same stock show different properties in grapes and thus in wines fermented from them, if the plants are grown in different soils and environmenst. The resolution of the fundamental characteristics of this scientific fact in an ayurvedha text (generally for herbs) and a contemporary scientific article (specifically for wine grapes, <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4338078/>) is obviously different. It may be even dangerous to interpolate the wine grapes study to ayurvedic herbs. But to blindly state "everything in ayurvedha texts about the factors determining the efficacy of the herbs is wrong or non-scientific" merely highlights one's limitations in understanding science and mantras.  

  

My 2 cents.  
  

thanks,
