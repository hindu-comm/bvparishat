Thank you for these references. I agree with application Dhupana process and allied methods in Aurvedic therapy.



There can be no fumes coming out of any Agni hotra rituals performed by people with belief can neutralise cyanide or **methyl isocyanate** (MIC) gas that was leaked in Bhopal Gas Tragedy.

I am open for corrections if any documented research papers or books are available that can prove contrary to the stand I have taken

Rest everything else you have pointed out I agree
