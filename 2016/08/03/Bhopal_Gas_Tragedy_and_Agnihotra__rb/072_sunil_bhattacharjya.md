Namaste Sastryji,  
  

I have been opening my big mouth about the different aspects of scientific investigation possible into ascertaining the significance or insignificance (whatever it may be) of the traditional practices like Agnihotra etc. using the background of the Bhaopal gas poisoning tragedy, only to show that a team work will be required in such cases among the traditional scholars and the modern scientists in the forum, as representatives of the Indians in general.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
