A Note on his Other book The Secret Life of Nature: Living in Harmony With the Hidden World of Nature Spirits from Fairies to Quarks  
"The long-awaited follow-up to Peter Tompkins's bestseller THE SECRET LIFE OF PLANTS is an astonishing account of how spiritualists and scientists alike are revealing that the physical world teems with nature spirits. In a dramatic meeting of New Science and New Age, Tompkins's new book is sure to radically transform how readers perceive and treat the natural world around them. Index. 20 photos & drawings."
