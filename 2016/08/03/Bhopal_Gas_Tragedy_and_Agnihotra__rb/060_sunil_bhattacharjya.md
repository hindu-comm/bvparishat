Dear Scholars of this forum,  
  
The Methyi isocyanate is toxic above 0,02 ppm (parts per million) in air and a concentraion of 3 ppm and higher is dangerous for health. Moreover Methyl isocyatae is heavier than air and that is why it is considerable more dangerous to have methyl isocyanate-polluted air around a low-lying houses and more so if the houses are closed.  
  
It could be that the households in Bhopal (where people survived apparently due to performing the havans) could have been located at higher elevations and it could also be that the windows in those houses were kept open to let out the smoke, which could could have prevented accumulation of the heavier Methyl isocyanate gas within the houses. If anybody wants to investigate anew the cases, where the people survived in Bhopal. the above aspects also must be considered. There are many factors, which need to be looked at the Bhopal gas tragedy in order to assess if and how the performers of havans averted the tragedy, and not jump into any hasty conclusion.  
  

Regards,  

skb
