This is exactly that been happening on this thread. Instead of pointing to evidences related to the threads topic, there are several posts from guardians of Havanic tradition parading continuously information related good effects havan smoke can have quoting all sorts of puranaic vedic, aurvedic texts books, links or articles which have no references to Bhopal Gas Tragedy or have established conclusion beyond reasonable doubt on poisonous Effect of MIC and Homas will neutralises effects of MIC and hence a family was saved.

Dear Vidwans of the list,



Did any one in this thread so far conclude that Havan saved the family from the poisonous effects of MIC ?

Dear Scholars of this forum,  
  
The Methyi isocyanate is toxic above 0,02 ppm (parts per million) in air and a concentraion of 3 ppm and higher is dangerous for health. Moreover Methyl isocyatae is heavier than air and that is why it is considerable more dangerous to have methyl isocyanate-polluted air around a low-lying houses and more so if the houses are closed.  
  
It could be that the households in Bhopal (where people survived apparently due to performing the havans) could have been located at higher elevations and it could also be that the windows in those houses were kept open to let out the smoke, which could could have prevented accumulation of the heavier Methyl isocyanate gas within the houses. If anybody wants to investigate anew the cases, where the people survived in Bhopal. the above aspects also must be considered. There are many factors, which need to be looked at the Bhopal gas tragedy in order to assess if and how the performers of havans averted the tragedy, and not jump into any hasty conclusion.

Regards,

skb

Thank you for these references. I agree with application Dhupana process and allied methods in Aurvedic therapy.



There can be no fumes coming out of any Agni hotra rituals performed by people with belief can neutralise cyanide or **methyl isocyanate** (MIC) gas that was leaked in Bhopal Gas Tragedy.

I am open for corrections if any documented research papers or books are available that can prove contrary to the stand I have taken

Rest everything else you have pointed out I agree
