\>Why are sceptics sidelined but the so called Nationalists who seem to say they know all about the ancients ..........

  

--------1. Who is sidelined by whom? All the mainstream platforms of academics are clearly and unquestionably scientism-centric and modernity-centric. Any scientism based statement is swallowed in a gulp without questioning, taken as granted, as given. Any one who makes sense ofideas from the traditional cultures of different social groups of the world are immediately asked to provide a scientism-compatible proof or stand as superstitious.

  

 2. Those who try to make sense of premodern and non-modern ideas are in fact uncritically lumped and branded as 'nationalists' and the world-war-time-born abuses such as fascism and so on are hurled on them to invoke fears and paranoias of those traumatic memories and show the scepticism towards scientism as villainous and scepticism towards suchalternative ideas as heroic.

  

 3. Environmentalism is one of the contemporary movements that exposed the lacunae in the claims of sciencesuch as absolute objectivity ( ref. "Technology and Human Destiny" by Henryk Skolimowsky) and created a new favourable attitude towards alternative knowledge systems. This development in the history of knowledge is more relevant in the context of the present thread because it is environmentalism that helps in making sense of most of the ideas of Yajna of which havan is the brick.
