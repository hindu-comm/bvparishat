These citations you have given are translation of a few puranic passages which is good as far as the story, importance of yajna in the mythological settings. They are not to be considered as demonstrable scientific evidences. This can be considered as ancient Indian belief systems not as ancient Indian scientific systems. Quoting from Vedas and puranas may not help until one sees ancient Indian texts where there are records of systematic investigations on the efficiency of Homas and Havans in the context of poisonous gases. I am not aware of any such texts either in print or manuscripts. If there please guide me to those texts. I am aware Mimasikas and traditional commentators interpretations . They have not written that performance havans and homas act as shield against poisonous and toxic gases .
