Namaste,

  

Everyone of us are aware about the Bhopal Gas Tragedy that resulted in heavy toll of life. Those who survived, suffered from radiation effects etc. However, a news about a family who survived hit the headlines later that they were sole survivors who came out unscathed. It was later revealed that they used to do regular havan and gayatri japa. I was a kid that time and was in my school days.

  

Here is the news link:

Would like to know whether anybody met that family after this accident.
If the family still exists, then they are the practical living example how the vedic way of life is simple, scientific, healthy and environmental-friendly.

  

regs,

sriram
