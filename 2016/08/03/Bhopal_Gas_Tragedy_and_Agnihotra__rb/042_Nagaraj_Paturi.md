What needs to be verified, first of all, is whether it is part of the beliefs /knowledge system of agnihotra /havan or yajnas made of agnihotra /havan that agnihotra / havan has the function of counteracting, in real time, the poisonous gases spread around the locale of agnihotra /havan.

  

To my knowledge, traditionally , there has been no such idea in the belief system /knowledge system of agnihotra /havan or yajnas made of agnihotra /havan.
