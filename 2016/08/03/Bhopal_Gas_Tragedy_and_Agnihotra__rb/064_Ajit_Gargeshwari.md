I still remember a stance taken by a few list members a couple of years back that our Vedas talk about quantum mechanics and even tried to argue about the relevance of this ridiculous book Quest of Creation higgs god Particles and Vedas . Ancient Indians had made good progress in science That does not mean one should start extrapolating and twisting data and prove matters which cannot be proved beyond doubt and call it research and say accept this research else you are anti Indian or not a defender of our culture. This same logic hold about Indian Astrology. Still many respectable scholars believe astrology should be made compulsory and if all learn and appreciate astrology it will solve the malice facing society. Please note I am for making systematic investigation on astrological texts.

Prof. Rani, in the present thread, added that the same book has pre-surgical procedures too. Relevance of that information to this thread is that the procedures included use of smokes (presumably for securing the room from the atmospheric pathogens)



There was neither a mention of tool cleaning nor was there a claim that the 21st century international standards were maintained.

Dear Vidwans of the list,



Did any one in this thread so far conclude that Havan saved the family from the poisonous effects of MIC ?

Dear Scholars of this forum,  
  
The Methyi isocyanate is toxic above 0,02 ppm (parts per million) in air and a concentraion of 3 ppm and higher is dangerous for health. Moreover Methyl isocyatae is heavier than air and that is why it is considerable more dangerous to have methyl isocyanate-polluted air around a low-lying houses and more so if the houses are closed.  
  
It could be that the households in Bhopal (where people survived apparently due to performing the havans) could have been located at higher elevations and it could also be that the windows in those houses were kept open to let out the smoke, which could could have prevented accumulation of the heavier Methyl isocyanate gas within the houses. If anybody wants to investigate anew the cases, where the people survived in Bhopal. the above aspects also must be considered. There are many factors, which need to be looked at the Bhopal gas tragedy in order to assess if and how the performers of havans averted the tragedy, and not jump into any hasty conclusion.

Regards,

skb

Thank you for these references. I agree with application Dhupana process and allied methods in Aurvedic therapy.



There can be no fumes coming out of any Agni hotra rituals performed by people with belief can neutralise cyanide or **methyl isocyanate** (MIC) gas that was leaked in Bhopal Gas Tragedy.

I am open for corrections if any documented research papers or books are available that can prove contrary to the stand I have taken

Rest everything else you have pointed out I agree
