\>Only two things that made me to participate in this present thread:

  

..................................................................................................................................

  

2. A statement in the recent postings in this thread: "What needs to be verified, first of all, is whether it is part of the beliefs /knowledge system of agnihotra /havan or yajnas made of agnihotra /havan that agnihotra / havan has the function of counteracting, in real time, the poisonous gases spread around the locale of agnihotra /havan."

  

DHUPANA PROCESS: This Dhupana Process is not any part of Puranas or Mythological accounts but is a part of Sushruta Samhita and other texts on Ayurveda where they recommend to perform DHUPANA PROCESS before starting any surgical treatment in an operation theater of ancient times. They very clearly say that this DHUPANA PROCESS helps us in killing many poisonous elements such as micro poisonous organisms that pervade through AIR in the surroundings.

In this DHUPANA PROCESS the items used like CAMPHOR, GUGGULU, TURMERIC and other selective herbs are mostly similar to those used in HAVANA.

  

Since the statement quoted under 2 above is mine,

let me clarify

  

Sir, as always, you are attempting to fightyour co-soldierswho fighting on your side of the warare strongly working to

"appreciate our predecessors' admirable contribution to various fields of knowledge are to pass on these precious things to our future generations."

  

I was talking about Bhopal gas tragedy type situation and was trying to defend the agnihotra /havan believers by saying that the

using that incident and the related claims to defame agnihotra/havan tradition is unfair because neutralizing MIC type lethal poisons through agnihotra/havanis not claimed in the tradition.

  

If your point is thatothers should not defend the tradition that you want to defend, I leave the ground to you, with a wholehearted belief that tradition is in safe hands, I need not unnecessarily poke my nose.
