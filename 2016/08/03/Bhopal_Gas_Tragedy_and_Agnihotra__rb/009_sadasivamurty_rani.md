Pranams to all.

In the context of disproving the influence of Agnihotra in preventing the spread of poisonous gasses Yadu ji made the following statement: "Indians are champions in creating Mystery around rituals." Here I have a bunch of questions.

1\. Which Indians? North Indians or South Indians?

2\. Are those Indians inclusive Yadu ji or all the rest of the nation excluding Yaduji?

3\. In the attempt of scientifically disproving the influence of Agnihotra is it necessary to blame all Indians while a few Indians hold any such views?

4\. Does such generalization of individuals' opinions fetch any rational support to the core argument?

5\. On this occasion I would like to bring to the kind notice of Yadu ji about a progressive pursuit by some scientists like Prof. Sai Gopal, Prof. Hussain and others of Department of Atmospheric Sciences to prove the influence of YAJNAS in the purification of atmosphere.

I request Yaduji to interact with such scientists to unearth the facts instead of blaming us all innocent Indians for no fault of us.

Warm regards,

Prof. Rani Sadasiva Murty
