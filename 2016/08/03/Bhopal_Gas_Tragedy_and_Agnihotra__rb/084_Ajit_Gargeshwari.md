on this site

When I meant independent research I meant researches which are reviewed.  
Like Prof Stall’s works and articles

I agree with team work but I don’t know if we are “representatives of the  
Indians in general” I don’t think this list is designed to make any such  
representations

I did not say this happened in this thread. It happens always many a times  
and there is enough evidence to prove it does happen outside the list and  
there might be a tendency that this might happen in this list. This is my  
thought. I am defender of possibility but one cannot keep defending the  
impossible.
