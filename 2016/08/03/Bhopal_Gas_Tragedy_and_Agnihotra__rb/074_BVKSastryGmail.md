Namaste SB



Research as \< scientific investigation> on \< Traditional Practices>,
progresses only when (a) The passion of the Tradition Teams is (b) married to the Resource – Investment Providers Policy and intent to guard the ‘Tradition for a Value’ ( This is Viniyoga = Application of Research for a Target benefit: Other words being Phala-Shruti, Loka-Sangraha, Mano-Kaamanaa siddhi depending upon what one wishes to say).



In the present case, traditional teams have passion and pride; but not the ‘numbers – resources- methods- marketing proposition’.

The ‘Resource rich team’ have ‘ self-opinion, impertinence and superciliousness’ which demands traditional scholars to be hand maid of business enterprise.



This is the mismatch of the proposition to proceed any further in making headways on \< scientific investigation> on \< Traditional Practices>.



It is in this backdrop that I raised the question :What is a Research proposition, as understood in traditional disciplines, citing two of them, which need a ‘clear understanding of Tradition of Yoga narrated in Samskrutham’. Let us start addressing this issue with a conceptual clarity on pedagogy, methodology and purpose, to fit in to a time frame of say three weeks deliberation ; on this forum where the best brains of tradition are providing inputs. Once that is through, let us figure out as a ‘ TEAM –TRADITION’ the ‘ Viniyoga ( = Benefit of Applied Tradition to provide strength to the spine of belief-practice’. Rest will follow in sequence.



The TEAM - is not limited to \< representatives of the Indians in general \> ; it is \< representatives of all researchers interested in Indian Tradition, willing to work with open mind set :Sahanaa for Sahanaavavatu – Maa Vidvishaavahai- Tejasvi Naavadhaatamastu ’>. Sad fact, not to lament but overcome is we are not yet at this point, though we wish to be and make self-imagination and delusion.



Look forward for inputs and a ‘GLOBAL TEAM : SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION OF TRADITION ’ who would stick their head in to this exercise and dip hands to their pockets.
