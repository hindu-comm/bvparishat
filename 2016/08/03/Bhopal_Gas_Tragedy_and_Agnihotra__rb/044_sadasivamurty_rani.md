Pranams to all.

Here I give two instances from two different different sources of ancient Indian belief/knowledge system which support the virtues of the clouds formed from the performance of Yajna.

**YAJNA AND RAINS HAVE CYCLIC RELATION**

अधो हि वर्षाम वयं मर्त्याश्चोर्ध्व प्रवर्षिण:॥ ४०॥

तोयवर्षेण हि वयं हविर्वर्षेण मानवा:।

येऽस्मभ्यं न प्रयच्छन्ति नित्यनैमित्तिका: क्रिया:॥४१॥

क्रतुभागं दुरात्मान: स्वयं वाश्नन्ति लॊलुपा:।

विनाशाय वयं तेषां तोयसूर्याग्निमारुतान्॥४२॥

क्षितिं च संदूषयाम: पापानामवतारिणाम्।

दुष्टतोयादिभोगेन तेषां दुष्कृतकारिणाम् ॥४३॥

उपसर्गा: प्रवर्तन्ते मरणा सुदारुणा:॥४४॥

 - मार्कण्डेयपुराणे १५ अध्याये

*This is in the context of the Team of the Chiefs of Parjanya region speaking about the two way rain in the following manner:  
*

*We shower rains from the aerial path and the humans shower rains in abundance from the earth towards the sky (40).*

*While we shower the rains of water the humans shower the rains of Havis. Those who ignore to offer us Havis through their daily and occasional rituals being wicked minded and eat with greed and selfishness will meet destruction as we pollute the waters, the Sun, the Fire, the winds and even the Earth. Those sinful people having drunk the polluted waters as a result of their ill deeds will meat with dreadful death and calamities.* (42, 43 and 44 slokas)

Thus this instance emphasizes on the performance of Agnihotra through Nitya and Naimittika rituals in order to get rains from the celestial regions. As the first two lines of the above citation suggest such performance of rituals also should not be a stray instance but should be collectively and in huge quantities.
(अधोहिवर्षामवयंमर्त्याश्चोर्ध्वप्रवर्षिण:॥४०॥तोयवर्षेणहिवयंहविर्वर्षेणमानवा:।)

  

**SMOKE RAIN RELATION**

यज्ञधूमोद्भवं चापि प्रजानां हितकृत्सदा।

दावाग्निधूमसम्भूतमभ्रं वनहितं स्मृतम्॥४०॥

मृतधूमोद्भवंत्वभ्रं अशुभाय भविष्यति।

अभिचाराग्निधूमोत्थं भूतनाशाय वै द्विजा:॥

एवं धूमविशेषेण जगतां वै हिता हितम्।

तस्मदाच्छादयेद्धूमं अभिचारकृतं नर:॥४२॥- इति लिंगपुराणे ५४ अध्याय

This instance gives us various sources of cloud formation. Here FOUR types of sources for the formation of the clouds are specified with their respective consequences.

1\. The clouds formed from the smoke emitted from the Ritualistic Altars (Yajnas) are always for the well being of human beings. 2. The cloud formed from the smoke emitted from the Forest Fire is favourable to the entire forest. (40)

3\. The cloud formed from the smoke emitted from burning of corpse is inauspicious to all. 4. The cloud formed from the smoke emitted from the evil deeds of sorcerers is destructive of all beings. (41)

Thus depending on variance of the smoke the good and bad of the world is decided. Hence one should strictly prohibit the smoke that is emitted from the sorcerers' deeds.

In this manner there are more than hundred Vedic, Pauranic and Agamic instances of Agnihotra's role in environmental purification in my collection.

Whatsoever the name such as ANCIENT INDIAN BELEIF SYSTEMS/KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMS may be given to this kind of thoughts, I can firmly say that there are hundreds of quotes in Vedic and Pauranic literature.

We are all very seriously working in these areas too.

Regards,

**Prof. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
