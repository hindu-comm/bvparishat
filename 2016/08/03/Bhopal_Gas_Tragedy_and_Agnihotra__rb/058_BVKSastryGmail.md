On \< fumigation as a theatre-sanitizing method from the texts on Ayurveda \> , \< efficacy of smoke \> , \< our belief system in support of the Agnihotra's use in environmental purification \> , \<
of Sushruta Samhita and other texts on Ayurveda where they recommend to perform DHUPANA PROCESS before starting any surgical treatment in an operation theater of ancient times \> 



A) The scale of ‘Bhopal Gas Tragedy is of a much larger scale than what comes under the ambit of ‘Agnihotra- Havan’ generated ‘smoke /fumigation protection. The gasses in Bhopal Tragedy and the gaseous fumigation products from a Havana are chemically of different order and may not neutralize or nullify the effects of each other ‘chemically’.
Therefore, the ‘ generalization by assumptions on the similarity of ‘gaseous nature of substances’ is not enough to clear the question raised by Dr. Yadu.



B) There are chemical studies on the nature of ‘ fumigation products that come up in the limited context of ‘ Havan-Agnihotra’ by reputed scientists; some references listed below. The issue is an ‘ ongoing research’ with several dimensions of interest by many nations with the top-line concern on ‘Safety in Gaseous Chemical hazardous environment’.
**If ‘Agnihotra’ can prove even as a limited remedy to address this concern, Vedic Sciences can get a big boost.**

C) Coming to \< Fumigation in a Operation Theater as a preparation for Surgical procedure> , the medical standards are fairly well established and internationally practiced. There are many fumigation procedures. Unless there is a positive study to establish ‘Agnihotra- Havan fumigation / smoke particles outputs’ to contain ‘ what is expected of in a \< surgical theater fumigation procedure>, there is no reason to make extended claims. **May be this can be a research topic for interdisciplinary study**.



 A Google search with the words – ‘ OT sterilization protocol fumigation> provides enough articles from medical literature. The fumigation of operation theater is to cleanse the environment and tools; but it is not meant as any ‘ medicine value item in surgery –treatment –recovery’ as claimed in the ‘ benefits from Agni-hotra’.
The Fumigation Procedure from
<http://www.themicrobiologyblog.com/2009/08/operation-theater-sterilization-by.html> reads :



 \< Formaldehyde vapor is an extremely effective biocidal agent. It acts as an alkylating agent, inactivating micro-organisms by reacting with carboxyl, amino, hydroxyl and sulphydral groups of proteins as well as amino groups of nucleic acid bases. Fumigation is effective at above the temperature of 20ºC and relative humidity of 65%.

Formalin is commercially available as 40% solution of formaldehyde in water. When formalin is heated formaldehyde vapor is generated. Formaldehyde is a Schedule 1 chemical under the COSHH (Control of Substances Hazardous to Health) Regulations and has a Maximum Exposure Limit (MEL) of 2 ppm. But, concentrations encountered during fumigation is many hundred times higher than this, so fumigation procedure must be carried out only by trained personnel under strictly defined conditions. All workers using formaldehyde must be aware of safe handling procedures.

Under certain conditions formaldehyde can react with hydrochloric acid and chlorine containing disinfectants such as hypochlorites to form chlormethyl ether, a potent lung carcinogen. So hydrochloric acid and chlorine-containing disinfectants must be removed from the room before fumigation. \>

In short, the cleaning of a vessel ( =Surgical Theater and tools sterility) is a prerequisite for healthy cooking ( = Surgery procedures) ; but cleaning of vessel is not a guarantee for tasty quality food output.
