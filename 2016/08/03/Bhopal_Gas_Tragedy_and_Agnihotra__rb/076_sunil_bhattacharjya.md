Dear friends,  
  
Yes, there should be effective interaction between the traditionalist and the scientists, and it is also necessary to recognize that there can be people who are both traditionalist and scientist, at the same time
Effective interaction needs team spirit at individual level on both the sides. There is also the need for lateral thinking and that need not be confined to the scientists alone. With such combination of talents, no problem would be too big to find solution..  
  

Regards,
