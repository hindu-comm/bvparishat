Dear Ajit Ji,

As far as I have been studying our ancient Indian knowledge sources of any positive sciences are five fold:

1. Vedas 2. Puranas and Itihasas 3. Independent Treatises 4. Interdisciplinary References and 5. Kavyas.

In all these FIVE areas either explicitly or suggestively the scientific knowledge has been transmitted from one generation to the next till it reached us.

  

I request you to read my previous mail once again. Nowhere I ventured to call them practicable scientific evidences (Demostrable scientific evidences in your words). But I left the choice to the readers to call them either belief system or knowledge system.

  

Further to say , Puranas give many aspects of various branches of knowledge through many stories. There the story line never bears any importance but the knowledge aspects given there in bear the validity. Hence many great commentators and scholars of ancient lore respected the pauranic knowledge accounts with highest worth of being valid.

It took me nearly four decades to collect a good amount of scientific content pertaining to nearly 20 branches of sciences from the above five heads of sources.

  

I cannot go on quoting what all is in my possession to convince you all being conditioned by many constraints such as Space, Time, Energies etc.

  

One thing here I would like to say in this context: During recent times I have been mostly a silent participant in BVParishat because of my work pressure in many other accepted - ongoing - practical projects.

  

Only two things that made me to participate in this present thread:

1\. Yadu ji's generalized statement about the Indians.

2\. A statement in the recent postings in this thread: "What needs to be verified, first of all, is whether it is part of the beliefs /knowledge system of agnihotra /havan or yajnas made of agnihotra /havan that agnihotra / havan has the function of counteracting, in real time, the poisonous gases spread around the locale of agnihotra /havan."

  

DHUPANA PROCESS: This Dhupana Process is not any part of Puranas or Mythological accounts but is a part of Sushruta Samhita and other texts on Ayurveda where they recommend to perform DHUPANA PROCESS before starting any surgical treatment in an operation theater of ancient times. They very clearly say that this DHUPANA PROCESS helps us in killing many poisonous elements such as micro poisonous organisms that pervade through AIR in the surroundings.

In this DHUPANA PROCESS the items used like CAMPHOR, GUGGULU, TURMERIC and other selective herbs are mostly similar to those used in HAVANA.

All these require some special attention to be paid at least to appreciate our predecessors' admirable contribution to various fields of knowledge are to pass on these precious things to our future generations.

If I become silent further, please don't think that I am reluctant to participate further in this thread but I have to work 20 hours a day to attend and finish the other tasks at hand to be delivered to my other associates.

Warm regards,   

**Prof. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
