The focus of this thread was with specific focus on Bhopal Gas tragedy and Agni Hotra episode. Till one has verified and confirmed publications on efficacy of homas we all can keep an open mind and not post conclusions. Thanks

Just as fake allopathic doctors (called by several different names such as RMPs and their failing or harmfultreatments can not disprove the efficacy of modern medicine, the fake Vedic scholars/practitioners such as the fake Sadhus/Swamis/Babas and their cheating tricks using methods such as havan can not disprove the efficacy ofhavans and yajnas made of havans.

Aayushmaan Venkata Sriram's post on Bhopal gas tragedy and havan news, though was out of the blue, and though he himself considers the whole news activity around the case as just a hype, it triggered, rather revived the debate around the usefulness of havan and yajna made of that brick. The case of the family saved during the tragedy is just a data, a fact. Role of havan in the family's surviving the tragedy is an open issue for investigation. Both the ideas of 'havan had a role in the survival'' , 'havan hadno role in the survival''are not supported by any research.



Validity of usefulness of havan and yajna is independent of this open to investigation, not yet resolvedcase.
