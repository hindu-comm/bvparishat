Sharing a chapter of the book " Vision of Aryan Glory" . I request the members not to get digressed into the beaten track issues of validity of the word/concept of 'Aryan' and so on. Reading 'Vedic' for 'Aryan', we may try to understand the views of a legendary visionary scholar of yester years. 

  

The full book may be downloaded [from here](http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=8&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiq5ey6_KvOAhXCvI8KHeoRBfsQFgg1MAc&url=http%3A%2F%2Febooks.tirumala.org%2FHome%2FDownload%2F%3FID%3D1855&usg=AFQjCNFgIWcTPNF9Jqox8Zrf0IX10qNCQw&sig2=lXz8G00pd-TyDKBSjUOVJQ)

  

The author poojya E Ananthacharyaji was not a mere interpreter or theory-maker he practically experimented the ideas of the Vedic texts and created new medical products.
