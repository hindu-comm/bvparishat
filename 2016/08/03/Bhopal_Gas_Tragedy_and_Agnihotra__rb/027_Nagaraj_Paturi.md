Aayushmaan Venkata Sriram's post on Bhopal gas tragedy and havan news, though was out of the blue, and though he himself considers the whole news activity around the case as just a hype, it triggered, rather revived the debate around the usefulness of havan and yajna made of that brick. The case of the family saved during the tragedy is just a data, a fact. Role of havan in the family's surviving the tragedy is an open issue for investigation. Both the ideas of 'havan had a role in the survival'' , 'havan hadno role in the survival''are not supported by any research.

  

Validity of usefulness of havan and yajna is independent of this open to investigation, not yet resolvedcase.
