Namaste to all scholars.

  

A lot of discussion is going on the efficacy of Agnihotra/Havan here with valuable inputs from both sides. However, most of the posts are about not carrying any scientific investigation into the process and effects of the Yajna. In this connection I may be permitted to quote the following from the all world gayatri parviar website about their research:

   The Yagyopathy Lab at Brahm- varchas:The Brahmvarchas Research Center was established by Pandit Shriram Sharma Acharya in 1979. It is situated at the Saptsarover road about 6 kilometers from the Hardwar railway station in the direction of Rishikesh, in India. This center is actively working for the integration of the modern and ancient sciences. Innovative scientific research work is being carried out here in the science of spirituality . Apart from a dedicated team of scientists, doctors and engineers and other scholars of high caliber and well equipped laboratories for relevant research in different scientific disciplines including neurology, biochemistry, hematology, photochemistry and sound therapy etc, other features of attraction here are collections of about 450 herbs which include some rare species of the Himalaya n herbs and the yagyopathy lab.

  
The Ayurvedic (herbal medicine) lab of this centre and its pharmaceutical unit have produced new herbal medicines that have shown superb healing results in some cases of nervous system disorders, asthma, heart diseases, diabetes, lung infections, a wide variety of skin diseases and the diseases of the eyes and ears. Tens of thousands of patients benefit every year from the free consultancy and pure herbal medicines available at no-profit prices here. The yagyopathy lab studies the properties and effects of these herbs when sublimated in the fire of yajna.  
  
The yagyopathy laboratory has a havan kunda placed in a glass chamber and a gas analysis wing for the collection and analysis of the fumes and vapors of yajna. The efficacy of various herbal ingredients in the havishya and the quality of the samidhas are assessed in the photochemistry lab, which is equipped with units like the gas-liquid chromatography. The purpose is to analyze the raw content in the beginning and what is left after these substances have been fumigated \[5, 6\].  
  
Blood samples are kept in the glass chamber when it is full of the fumes and vapors during the daily yajna (havan) and the changes in the blood biochemistry and hematological parameters are recorded for these samples.  
  
A large number of experiments are carried out on random samples of health y and diseased persons, living on the Shantikunj and Brahmvarchas campuses for prescribed periods. The subjects include the sadhakas as well as the non-sadhakas of all age groups (both men and women ) from all walks of life irrespective of their social or religious background. During such experiments, the subjects are asked to sit in the glass chamber and inhale the fumes of yajna for specific periods of time. A thorough analysis of their bodies and mind s is made before and after performing this experiment.  
  
The measurements (carried out by chromatography, multichannel physio graphs, etc) of the above experiments include – Hematological parameters like HB, TRBC, TWBC, Platelets, RBC fragility etc; biochemical changes like those in the levels of blood urea, sugar, cholesterol,**creatinine**, SGOT, SGPT etc; and the immunological changes like the antibody levels and innate immunity towards various pathogenic offending organisms.  
  
The EEG, EMG and ECG recordings are carried out in the neurophysiology labs. The psychometric lab assesses the aptitude, learning potential, memory, the intelligence quotient, emotional quotient and the overall personality makeup of the subjects. The cases are followed upon at regular intervals (e.g. after performing yajna regularly for a week, or a month etc.) These experiments may be extended, in collaboration with some neurochemists, to also record the levels of various hormones like cortisol, thyroxin, ACTH, androgen's etc in the endocrinology lab.  
  
The general conclusion of the results obtained so far is that performing yajna significantly enhances the vitality and resistance against adverse metro-biological changes and against the invasion of otherwise lethal viruses and bacteria. Mental peace, emotional stability and creative development of the mind are the general observations of the analysis on the psychological fronts.
