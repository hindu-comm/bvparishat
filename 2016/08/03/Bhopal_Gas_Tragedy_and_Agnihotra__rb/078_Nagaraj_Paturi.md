I mentioned three modern movements campaigning havan /homa/ agnihotraand said that they are involved in research.

  

Dr Ivaturi brought in one of them, the Gayatri Parivar's research.

  

The other movement, Sri Vasant Paranjape's Homa movementhas huge research published on the net.

  

For example,

<http://www.homatherapie.de/>

<http://www.homatherapypoland.org/en/>

<http://www.agnihotra.org/>

<http://www.baltohomacommunity.org/>

<http://www.agnihotra.com.au/>

<http://www.fivefoldpathmission.org/>

<http://www.homatherapyindia.com/>

  

The Bhopal family obviously must be belonging to one of the modern movements.
