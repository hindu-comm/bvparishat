Apart from the traditional agnihotra practice as a nityakarma more prevalent in premodern India, rather than modern India, there are modern movements of agnihotra practice spreading all over the world. Some of them are:

  

1\. Arya Samaj's agnihotra

  

2\. Gajanan Maharaj inspired Vasant Paranjpe lead agnihotra movement

  

3\. Gayatri Pariwar's agnihotra movement.

  

Researches are being conducted in all the three movements.
