No one in the thread so far, including the thread initiatormade any claim that Havan was responsible for the miraculous survival of the family.

Hence proof is not being provided nor is it needed to be provided for that point.

  

All the proofs being provided are for the efficacy or usefulness ofhavan.

  

Apart from the research proof,

  

"proof of the pudding is in its eating"

  

applies to many aspects of alternative medicine and alternative practices like Havan.
