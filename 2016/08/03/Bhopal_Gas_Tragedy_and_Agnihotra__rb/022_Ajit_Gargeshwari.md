Yes you may be right there is no proper documentation apart from hear say. Till one has enough documentary evidence or established proof it must in realms of speculation ( or Myth making or superstitious beliefs). My personal belief cannot be generalised until my personal belief can be proved. There is no question of Indian bashing the same applies even for miracles reported in the west. I don’t see why one should focus to prove an impossible and say we are Indians champions of nationalism. Why are sceptics sidelined but the so called Nationalists who seem to say they know all about the ancients and all others who don’t nod to their view points are Antii national or don’t care about Indian culture. All do as much as these Myth makers. Myth makers care only about their myths and nothing else. I repeat as I have repeated Indians had achieved a lot in the areas of science mathematics astronomy etc, there is no denying. Highlighting incidents like this is this way to know truth?

Ajitji ,

My point was that for 30 years nobody took notice of the incident , nobody carried out any study , nobody interviewed the family and now that someone points it out ,people want to reject it as superstition.

You are right this whole discussion in not worthwhile If a rational explanation is not given then one starts attributing causes of such causes to supernatural powers and start myth making and spread superstitious beliefs. There may be instances in an experiment conducted deviations are shown from standard results. That does not mean science is at fault but only proves that the process on interpreting results is at fault or the hypothis may have to be reconsidered to cover the deviations. Now if Agnihotra is the savoir lets all perform Agni hotra and start living in areas where there are poisonous gases and prove we can live. If out 10 people 9 survive then one can reconsider scientific explanation but if out 100 million one survive there is no need to relook into science.
