Namaste Yaduji,

  

I second with your thoughts that our thinking should be coupled with rational approach. There was a big hype created around Agnihotra w.r.t to Bhopal Gas Leakage.

  

However, on the flip side (potency of vedic suktas), there are incidents in the recent past. Most of us are aware of a great vedic scholar Sri.Uppuluri Ganapati Sastry who was awarded the title "vedapurusha".
He once conducted varuNa japa in tirumala during the times of draught, and there was a huge downpour near yAgashAla and the reservoir became full, thus, the problem of draught was solved. Sri.Raghavendra Tirthalu (Rayaru) of mantralayam, chanted prANa-sukta of Rg veda and brought the dead plant to life. Green leaves started growing. When He chanted Agni sukta with sandal paste in His hand and applied to his saha-adhyAyi, he got burning sensation over his body. 

  

When son of Ganapati Muni (Sri.A.Mahadeva Sastry) got his right leg fractured completely (it was multiple fractures), Sri.Muni performed the anuSTAna of "asthi-sandhNa-mantra" (the mantra for joining of bones) for 40 days, the bones got united. His daughter Smt.Vajreshwari personally told us. 

  

These aspects show that vedic suktas do yield results when chanted by a adhikAri who attained upAsana siddhi. 

  

That is why I enquired whether anybody personally met that Agnihotri who survived the tragedy and came unscathed.

  

regs,

sriram
