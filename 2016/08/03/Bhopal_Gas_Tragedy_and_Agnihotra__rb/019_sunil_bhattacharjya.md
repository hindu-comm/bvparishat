Dear scholars,  
  

Apart from what I wrote earlier I wish to add the following for investigation. If anybody wants to have a fresh look at the efficacy of
the havan performed by some of the residents of Bhopal at the time of the lethal gas-leakage, he or she should also find out which fuel was used on that occasion. Many people use the dried cow-dung cakes for the havan and it has been reported that many a times the cow-dung cakes contains chemicals including pesticides and other toxic components. People using such cowdung cakes are generally used to the exposure to such smoke from the burnt cowdung cakes. During the time of the gas-leakage,the havan was surely performed inside the closed house and the house might have already full of such smokes. One has to look at the possibilty of the high concentration of the havan smoke interacting with the very low concentration (at parts per million level) of the leakaed gas and reducing the lethal effect of the latter.
