Namaste



**On Bijoy Misra ji’s post**: reading \< Pranayama – Physical issues and Yogic manifestations… Instances of Pure yogi’s … **The modern science, for convenience, abandons this since the tools don't exist to probe**.>. Then why engage and invoke science as a validation tool for ‘ Vedas ( and for that matter Ayur-Veda) : Which come under Yoga exploration as ‘Mantra –Experience’ and as a part of ‘mystic tradition’? – An exercise that has been touted globally as hall mark of ‘ Verifying Ancient Indian Traditional Sciences’ ? – Both at India as well as Leading institutions abroad ? What would then be ‘VEDIC SCIENCE (Veda- Vijnana) Research denote ? See links on research at : <http://harvardguidetoyoga.com/> ; <http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-11-22/harvard-yoga-scientists-find-proof-of-meditation-benefit> ; <http://harvardguidetoyoga.com/about> ?



**On Bijoy Misra ji’s post**: reading \< It would be more pertinent if systematic work is done **to understand the neural aspects of pleasure and pain in the worldly context \> **. Of course, \< **gross generalizations are unfortunate**. \> The neural aspect of pleasure and pain is having the same qualitative issue as ‘Yoga’ related, namely
: Body-Mind-Psyche interaction and imprints measurement’. Are there ‘tools and modeling’ in Sciences of Mind and Body, to conduct the probe on ‘ Feelings: be it a pleasure or pain’. The FMRI and advanced studies can provide tools to measure a ‘signal – travel and progress in the body-network’; but do they have the ‘sensitivity’ to differentiate the ‘ sensation of pleasure from pain’ ? Would the book - Molecules of Emotion: Why You Feel the Way You Feel, (Scribner, 1997) - Candace B. Pert Ph.D. (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candace_Pert>) talking about the ‘biomolecular basis for our emotions ‘ be a good starting point ? OR some writings in Energy Medicine’ OR Explaining the experience of waiting for the bus – A boredom experience (<http://inflexions.org/tangents/toronto/WAIT.pdf> ) . OR Selling Sickness: How Drug Companies are Turning Us All into Patients - Ray Moynihan , What Doctors Don't Get to Study in Medical School - (2014) - by B.M. Hegde ?



**On Ajit Gargeswari’s post** : reading \< International committee to study ghosts, devils, rebirth, on claims of Saints and God men or women, on the law of Karma, all ritual practices human beliefs including vedic yajnas publish books and papers an disseminate it all interested public. The committee can experts from all walks of life. .. > You mean to say one more society or join hands and work with a society like -
<http://www.ghostresearch.org/> ;
<http://www.spiritualresearchfoundation.org/spiritual-research/ghosts/>
;
<http://www.catholiceducation.org/en/culture/catholic-contributions/does-the-church-perform-exorcisms.html>
?

And how would this improve our knowledge of ‘ Yoga- Pranayama - Bharateeya Vedic Science Research’ - beyond the ‘Creative imagination’ already screened in movies like Sagar’s classics and Sopas that entertain the late evening crowd in TV-shows ? ( as ‘ Indian versions of Harry Potter /X-men) in several sops of Indian movies with snakes and semi-human beings ?

Would they answer the test set by Misra ji : \< **The modern science, for convenience, abandons this since the tools don't exist to probe**
\> ?

Dear Ajitji and friends,

I think there is a confusion between the physical issues and the yogic manifestations. Pranayama certainly has value, but instances of pure yogi are rare. There is also some psychic sense, which has little physical explanation. The modern science, for convenience, abandons this since the tools don't exist to probe. It would be more pertinent if systematic work is done to understand the neural aspects of pleasure and pain in the worldly context. Of course, gross generalizations are unfortunate.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
