The focus of this thread was on unverified claims made by some in the context Bhopal gas tragedy. Lets not club unverified claims with good and high quality researches being conducted in the areas of youga, Aurveda,ancient Indian sciences. As science students need a dose of arts so do arts students need a dose of science to bring in rationality. All this can go to the committee I suggested. The committee has no model and need not based or conceived on any existing committees. Its time for me to go to verified and good research being done in Sanskrit and India studies than to read and entered into protracted debates on isolated and unverified reporting.
