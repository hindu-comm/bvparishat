Dear scholar friends,  
  

Further to what has been mentioned earlier, one has to find out is, if any sort of mapping projection (however accurate or inaccurate) had been done in Bhopal to find out the maximum possible concentration of the lethal gases at different places at different distances from the source of the gas-leakage, at different points of time from the time when the gas leakage started. That would give an idea as to the sort of lethal gas concentrations around the individual houses at different locations at different times from the time of the gas-leakage. This is however is not a simple job as the wind velocities and wind directions as well as the obstructions like tall buildings on the wind-path will have to be considered besides the topographic details of the land as well as the building heights, for the individual houses considered.  
  
Without any such detailed scientific evaluation, any comment on the usefulness or otherwise of the Agnihotra performed at the affected places, will not be useful.  

  

Regards,
