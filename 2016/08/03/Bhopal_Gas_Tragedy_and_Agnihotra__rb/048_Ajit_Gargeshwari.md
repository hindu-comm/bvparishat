I am highly appreciative and thank you for this mail. I am for and I agree with scientific material in Vedas and all our Sastras there so denying. The place our Vedas and Shastras do occupy in the context Indian historic, religious cultural studies need no mention. I am not foolish to let go evidences and profound work done by you and other great scholars.



I am yet to see any connection between this information and the unverified claims made by someone in the context of Bhopal Gas Tragedy. This has been my consistent argument from the beginning on this thread. I see no reason to change my view as I am yet see any connection as evidences beyond doubt.



Thank you it’s been indeed a privilege for me and am sure will act as an eye opener to many young students on this list. I hope more such information is shared in this list for the benefit of all list members.
