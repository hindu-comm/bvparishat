As there is confusion so are such researches which create more doubts and don’t clearly say they are not dealing with physical issues. Not physical issues many a times subjective issues with very less objectivity in mind. Such papers and researcher must clearly state such researches are a just are hypothesis or a possibility instead they don’t do that. Most of the people who publish such researches on Homa therapy yagnic efficiency ESP levitation higher aspects of Samadhi for instance Nirvikalpa Samadhi, Past life regressions, levitation Mantra siddhi. Western mysticism, Black magic Yogic powers etc. are not most of the times qualified to speak either about the science or about non physical subject matter. We have thousands or popular book in the market but very less serious academic books or papers. Hence I suggested such a committee should be formed which can settle once and for all such claims with an open mind. Why shy away from impartial question and challenging which our culture is so open to.. I am not giving a time frame for such a committee to arrive at conclusions but an attempt can be made. The modalities and members of such a grand committee can be worked out.

Dear Ajitji and friends,

I think there is a confusion between the physical issues and the yogic manifestations.

Pranayama certainly has value, but instances of pure yogi are rare.
There is also

some psychic sense, which has little physical explanation. The modern science, for

convenience, abandons this since the tools don't exist to probe. It would be more

pertinent if systematic work is done to understand the neural aspects of pleasure

and pain in the worldly context. Of course, gross generalizations are unfortunate.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra

As a side note to this debate This is a serious thought I had from many years. Wanted to know if such a thought had accrued to any one before. To have a national or probably an International committee to study ghosts, devils, rebirth, on claims of Saints and God men or women, on the law of Karma, all ritual practices human beliefs including vedic yajnas publish books and papers an disseminate it all interested public. The committee can experts from all walks of life. This committee of experts may probably answer and settle these aid old question daunting mankind for thousands of years instead of knee jerk reaction which we often see.

The focus of this thread was with specific focus on Bhopal Gas tragedy and Agni Hotra episode. Till one has verified and confirmed publications on efficacy of homas we all can keep an open mind and not post conclusions. Thanks

Just as fake allopathic doctors (called by several different names such as RMPs and their failing or harmfultreatments can not disprove the efficacy of modern medicine, the fake Vedic scholars/practitioners such as the fake Sadhus/Swamis/Babas and their cheating tricks using methods such as havan can not disprove the efficacy ofhavans and yajnas made of havans.

Aayushmaan Venkata Sriram's post on Bhopal gas tragedy and havan news, though was out of the blue, and though he himself considers the whole news activity around the case as just a hype, it triggered, rather revived the debate around the usefulness of havan and yajna made of that brick. The case of the family saved during the tragedy is just a data, a fact. Role of havan in the family's surviving the tragedy is an open issue for investigation. Both the ideas of 'havan had a role in the survival'' , 'havan hadno role in the survival''are not supported by any research.



Validity of usefulness of havan and yajna is independent of this open to investigation, not yet resolvedcase.

I agree with what you say there is no doubt. One may continue to believe the again hotra episode of Bhopal gas tragedy and I have no objection to any ones belief.
