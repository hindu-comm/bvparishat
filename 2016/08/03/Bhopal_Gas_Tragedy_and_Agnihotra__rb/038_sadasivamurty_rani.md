Pranams to all.

The Scientific pursuits related to Agnihotra may not be ruled out as superstitious stuff. The following studies made by some Indian and Western scientists and the on going studies by some other scientists affirm its scientific validity. I request you all to go through the following observations collected by me from various sources on this subject.

If the Volume of the Yajna and Havana is larger the quantities are to be proportionately increased.

Now what will happen by performing HAVANA with these items and herbs in the Agnihotra Process:



1\. While Performing Agnihotra, the FIRE in the Altar maintains 200-300 Degrees Centigrade temperature. On the Top of the Altar 1000 Degrees Temperature is maintained. The Atomic Vapor of all the things offered to the FIRE mix with the Air and start travelling towards sky.



2\. When the dry wood and herbs are burnt in the Agnihotra - Acetic acid, Methyl Alcohol, Methane, Acetone, Acetyl Dehyde and Naphtali contents are separated from the wood and herbs and merge with the air and spread in the surroundings.



3\. Due to the heat of the Fire in the Altar - Guggulu, Camphor and other tree gums become Formal Dehyd, Turpentine, Tar and such and merge in the air.



4\. The Fats or the triglycerides among the items offered when heated over the Agnihotra turn into Hydro Carbons. From the Glycerol part of the items Acetone, Ferric Alde hide, Glycol Alde hide, Gly axel and such other things and merge in the air and produce methane, ethane profane, Butane, Ethylene, Acrylic Acid, Acetic Acid etc which also merge in the air.





These are a few to illustrate here. Besides these, due to various herbal and chemical substances offered in the Fire of the Altar the most powerful acids like Far sic Acid, Acetic Acid, Pyrolegniyes Acid, Propiyonic Acid and such other acids are produced from the Fire and purify the Air. These Acids and other chemical generated gasses allow for the formation of some Plasma which can sterilize the environment destroying all germs and protecting the environment free from all kinds of pollutions.



These are a few observations collected from various pursuits and practical studies on Agnihotra undertaken by some Indian and Western Scientists.



These studies and similar studies of this nature inspired Prof. Sai Gopal, Prof. Hussain and some other Scientists of the Atmospheric Department of Sri Venkateswara University to undertake further studies on Agnihotra.

Hope this information may be of some use for the enthusiasts of this subject.

Warm regards,

**Prof. Rani Sadasiva Murty**

**Subject:** Re: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Bhopal Gas Tragedy and Agnihotra  

The focus of this thread was on unverified claims made by some in the context Bhopal gas tragedy. Lets not club unverified claims with good and high quality researches being conducted in the areas of youga, Aurveda,ancient Indian sciences. As science students need a dose of arts so do arts students need a dose of science to bring in rationality. All this can go to the committee I suggested. The committee has no model and need not based or conceived on any existing committees. Its time for me to go to verified and good research being done in Sanskrit and India studies than to read and entered into protracted debates on isolated and unverified reporting.
