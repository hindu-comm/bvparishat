Sunil Ji,

Pranams. Thanks Sir, for acknowledging my efforts and exercise in this thread. In the Agnihotra normally along with cow dung we offer the dry stick pieces of Peepal Tree or Udumbara Tree or Palasa Tree in Andhra Pradesh even in Nitya Agnihotra.

Yes Sir. I agree with you. "To investigate what happened in Bhopal, we have to ascertain what the people used at the time of the Bhopal gas leakage."

Warm Regards,

**Prof. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
