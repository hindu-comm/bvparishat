Respected All,  
  

I have received a similar inquiry. Below, I am pasting my reply to him. This communication is bounced back. Interestingly, their website (googled), \<<http://www.scienceofhealth.org/>\> is closed to its members only. We don't know what health activity they are really involved in!  
  
Regards

Dear Dr. Richard Waidhorn,  
  
Thanks for your query on medical effects of Vedic chanting. Unfortunately, I am not aware of the published papers in this area. But I am aware that some scattered efforts are going on, by individuals and some NGO's, in this direction.  
  
Furthermore, the study done by I-SERVE \<<http://serveveda.org/>\>, on people with mental disorders at SVIMS, Tirupati might be of your interest. They experimented on a set of mentally sick patients by making them listen to selected Vedic chanting for 1 hour for 10 days. I am told that there was considerable improvement. I am not sure, whether the study was published. You may write them at [veda...@gmail.com](), addressing Prof. K.V. Krishna Murthy.  
  
Best regards,  
Prasad
