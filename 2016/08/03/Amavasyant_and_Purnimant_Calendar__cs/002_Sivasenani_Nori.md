Setting aside any "scientific" reason, even knowing the reason for this seeming diversity in calendars would be interesting.

  

If we look at a Calendar, we find that in different regions of India and the world, different dates are taken as the starting point of an year. Mostly these starting dates or years are based on historical personalities (Christ, Vikramaditya etc.). Some, like the Iranians take the Spring equinox as the starting date, as does the official "[Indian National Calendar](http://knowindia.gov.in/knowindia/national_symbols.php?id=10)". By the way, the National Calendar is very scientific; only nobody follows it, even though the dates on Gazette Notifications, RBI Bulletins etc. is as per this Calendar.

  

It is not as if these regional differences, or differences amongst various schemes of reckoning time are not important. A dispute centered on the Calendar is the technical reason for Mahabharata war. When the game of dice was played, it was VijayadaSamI. When the UttaragograhaNa happened, it was the end of Vasantanavaratri. So Duryodhana, basing himself on the Solar calendar, claimed that thirteen years were not complete. However Bhishma ruled that while the Calendar in vogue in a given area should be followed in general, for Vratas only the Lunar calendar must be followed. Further for calculating the length of time during Vratas, in pregnancy and for computing interest, the adhikamAsas must also be counted. The claim of Pandavas was that the Vrata period of thirteen years is complete, if the AdhikamAsas are counted. Duryodhana did not agree and war ensued.

  

For all the seeming diversity, festivals are celebrated on the same day, whether they occur in Suklapaksha or KrishNapaksha. The name of the lunar year is also common. For instance, the current year - "DurmukhI" or "Durmukha" is supposed to have started on caitraSuklAdi, i.e. April 8th, 2016. This is supposed to be the day Kaliyuga started some 5,100 years ago. So whether a new year starts on a Sankranti, or after DeepaavalI, the lunar new year (not the new year based on Jupiter) starts on caitraSuklAdi.
