Namaste,  
  

The attachment shows that one of the objectives of CAHC (of the Jain University) is the rectification of the general treatment of Indian history as chronicle of political history, without insights into cultural and social issues. This rectification is much needed, however for this to materialize, the requisite accurate chronicling must be done. "raja kAlasya kAranam", so says the ancient wisdom, which is still valid today. Permit me to give an example. The historian late S.R.Goyal showed that accounts of Megasthenes (of the time of Sandrocottus) and Kautilya (of the time of Chandragupta Maurya) give very different pictures of the cultural and social environment in its time and he could show that Chandragupta Maurya and Megasthenes cannot be contemporaries. Inspite of his conviction he dared not to oppose the powerful lobby of the historians and could not boldly say that Chandragupta Maurya lived centuries before Megasthenes. He satisfied himself by saying that Kautilya lived very much after Megasthenes. This means Chandragupta Maurya and Sandrocottus could not have been contemporaries. Yet the present day history text books ignore this very evident fact. There are many such discrepancies one can see in the present-day text books of Ancient Indian History. Such being the case, the concerned authorities in the Indian universities may give top priority to accurate chronicling of political history, so that accurate social and cultural history, as was at different historical periods, can be arrived at and their development with time can be studied.
