Thanks Prof. Aklujkar for pointing to the source. I've partly read the Bhaaratabhaavadeepa by NiilakaNtha. But this comm. Jnaanadiipikaa, although known by name, is not there in our library. Another is Arjuna Mishra's. Throgh the posting of Dr Nityananda Mishra I found in the recent Gita Comm. by Shri Ramabhadracharyaji, he has made use of the word "puniita" which is un-Paninian, but is there in the Shatapatha Brahmana and Mahabharata. This type of use in modern times is justified by Narayana Bhatta in his Apaaniniiyapraamaanyasaadhanam. Most often the fear of being treated as "äpaaniniiya" restricts one to limited vocabulary. Panini is no bar as Narayana points out, our own judgment is an obstacle.
