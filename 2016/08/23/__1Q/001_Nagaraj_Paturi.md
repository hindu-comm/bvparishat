But these stories are no 'dissenting voices'. They stand as counter evidence to the misinterpretations /stereotypes of these books that they propagate superiority of Brhmins in relation to the other castes.Reading Vedicscriptures as those 'preaching' or 'supporting' Brahmin superiority could have been used by superiority-minded Brahmins too apart from those who misunderstood these books as such.
