Coming back to the Rationalist epistemology or (janma)siddhajnaanavaada of VaiyaakaraNa dars'ana which is the common thread between Bhartrihari and (supposedly Anandavardhana) and Abhinavagupta ,there is an interesting coincidence:

  

Once there was a time people talked intensely about the numeroussimilarities between Chomsky'sTG grammar and Panini's Ashtadhyayi.

  

Chomsky's linguistic theory has been, rationalist ( centred on the idea of innate knowledge ) in its epistemology.

  

Bhartrihari's philosophy, which claims to be the philosophy or theoretical foundationbehind AA, which I proved (1987)to be justifiable on several grounds showing several proofs, is also rationalist (centred on the idea of innate knowledge).
