Thanks AadaraNIya Sivasenaniji, for appreciating the point.

  

Does the 'modern Indian scholar you mentioned agree /recognize the fact that Anandavardhanaconnects his theory to Vakyapadiyam?

  

If he recognizes that part and does not recognize the innateness or pratyabhinaa or any other aspect of Abhinava also being derived from the same source, it is ardhacharatinyaya.
