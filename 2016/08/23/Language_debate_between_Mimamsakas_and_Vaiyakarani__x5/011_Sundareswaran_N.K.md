Yes. It is a vast subject. Mimamsaka-s Vaiyakarana-s and Naiyayika-s have put forth different theories regarding verbal cognition. Vedantins have also propounded different theories with regard to verbal cognition and hermenuetics. So also Buddhist philosophers. Besides, Alankara shastrakara-s like Mukulabhatta and Mahimabhatta have enunciated original ideas and concepts (the latter drawing heavily from Bhartrhari, Kumarila Bhatta and Buddhist logicians). There are many scholars in BVP who can explain and elucidate the technicalities and nuances.

  

May I too suggest some books:

Indian theories of Meaning by K. Kunjunni Raja

Shabdatarangini by Veppattur Subrahmanya Sastri

The word and the world by B. K. Matilal.

  

We, the Department of Sanskrit, have brought out a small work on the topic:

**Indian Theories of Verbal Comprehension and Hermeneutics,** Calicut University Sanskrit Series No. 41.

(Collection of articles - Bilingual - English and Sanskrit).
