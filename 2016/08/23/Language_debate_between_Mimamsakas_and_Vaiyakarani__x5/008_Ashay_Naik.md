Thank you Sirs for your replies.

  

My apologies for not supplying the context for my query in the previous post. Here it is.

  

I am trying to understand the ways in which Vyakarana and Mimamsa theories of language have influenced the disputes surrounding dhvani in kavya-sastra.

  

Those who proposed the dhvani theory i.e. the view that kavya produces its rasa by means of dhvani, appear to have based it on the sphota theory of the vaiyakaranikas. The brahma-asvada entailed in the experience of rasa can also be related to sabda-brahman of the vaiyakaranikas. (I suppose the Vaiyakaranikas themselves might not support such an interpretation of their ideas but that is a separate issue.)

  

On the other hand, those who opposed the dhvani theory such as Bhatta Nayaka and Mahimabhatta were adherents of Mimamsa. I think Bhatta Nayaka explained rasa as arising from a three-fold process (abhidha - bhavakatva - bhoga) because the vyanjana-shakti of the word as suggested by the dhvani theorists could not be accommodated in Mimamsa theory of language, which only acknowledges abhidha-sakti (as far as I know).

  

It appears to me that this whole dispute regarding dhvani in kavya has to do with the contradictions between Vyakarana and Mimamsa theories of language.

  

This is what I would like to confirm.
