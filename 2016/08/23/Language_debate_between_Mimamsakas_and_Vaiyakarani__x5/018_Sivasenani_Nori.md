Pranams to Prof. Nagaraj Paturi garu.

  

Sir, this is a brilliant analysis, which points out a major flaw in the modern western method of analysis, by giving a very relevant example. In fact, Abhinavagupta is also said - by a modern Indian scholar who wrote a commentary on Dhvanyaloka - to have hijacked the concept of Dhvani and attributed much more meaning to Dhvani than what Anandavardhana intended. So, a colonial mindset sees ungratefulness, where there is innovation.
