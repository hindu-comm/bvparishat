Response of Dr Sunthar Visuvalingam to the Bhattanayaka paper of Prof. Sheldon Pollock is based , among other things , on the following two important aspects:

  

1\. Attempt to pit Bhatta Nayaka against Abhinavagupta

  

2\. Calling Abhinavagupta the ungrateful disciple of Bhattanayaka.

  

Such problems with the western researchers on Indian intellectual tradition are rooted in their inability to appreciate the coexistence of continuities and discontinuities between two authors belonging to different traditions, say Mimamsa and Vyakarana,indialogue,nevertheless apolemical one,with each other.


  

As Prof. Korada keeps reminding us repeatedly, Vyakarana Dars'ana as articulatedin books such asVakyapadiyam has a lot of borrowing of concepts and terms from Mimamsa. But can we call Hari as ungrateful disciple of Mimamsakas simply because he doesn't name the books and their authors of Mimamsa books from which he picked up those terms for a discussion and for providing a VaiyaakaraNa view of the same concepts (such as bhaavanaa, itikartvyataa etc. ) ?

  

The terms and concepts are continuities and their distinct interpretations as per the author's own tradition are discontinuities.

  

One such discontinuity that can be identified between Mimamsa and Vyakarana traditions, that is conspicuous by its lack of recognition in Prof. Pollock's paper is the epistemological difference between the two traditions that is calledas the difference between rationalist (knowledge is innate) and empiricist (knowledge is post-natally acquired)epistemologies in the modern/western parlance. \[Elsewhere I called rationalist epistemology as (janma)siddhajnaanavaada and empiricist epistemology as saadhyajnaanavaada.\]

  

VyaakaraNa dars'ana is rationalist in its epistemology.

  

Hari makes that clear by saying

  

इतिकर्तव्यता लॊकॆ सर्वा शब्दव्यपाश्रया /

यां पूर्वाहितसंस्कारॊ बालॊ ऽपि प्रतिपद्यतॆ // वाक्य\_१।१२९ //

आद्यः कारणविन्यासः प्राणस्यॊर्ध्वं समीरणम् /

स्थानानाम् अभिघातश् च न विना शब्दभावनाम् // वाक्य\_१।१३० //

  

Please note both itikartavyataa and bhaavanaa are found in Mimamsa too.

  

It is this major distinction of vaiyaakraNas that travelled from Hari through Aanandavardhana to Abhinavagupta that lead to the Abhivyaktivaada of Abhinavagupta.

  

Like Hari who gives vaiyaakaraNa interpretation , of Mimamsaka terms , Abhinavagupta gives vaiyaakaraNa /pratyabhijnaa interpretation, which is a siddhajnaanavaada interpretationto the Mimamsaka terms of Bhattanayaka.
