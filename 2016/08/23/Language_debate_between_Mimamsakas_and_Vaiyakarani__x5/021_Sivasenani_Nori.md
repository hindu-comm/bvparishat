Sir

The modern scholar is Prof. Chandika Prasad Shukla who wrote a commrntary called DeepaSikhaa. I am attaching the back cover of his book. Prof. Shukla recognises the source of Dhvani (a page from the bhumika is attached); that is not the issue. His point is that Abhinava Gupta while retaining Anandavardhana's sense of Dhvani, adds further dimensions of his own (the starting page of his critique is also attached). Also unlike many modern scholars, he did not limit himself to criticism of Abhinavagupta but wrote an alternate commentary. The commentary lifts Abhinavagupta's Sanskrit rendering of the Prakrit kavyas in total and generally follows Locana except in the didactic extensions of Locana. On the whole it is not very radical. At least one another modern scholar Prof. Pullela Sriramachandrudu agrees with Prof. Shukla (relevant page from the Telugu comentary of Prof. Pullela Sriramachandrudu is also attached).

Without expressing stronger views on the remarks of the two scholars, I thought that it might be accurate to state that some see Abhinavagupta as "innovating". Other descriptions could be adding to, or developing the school etc.
