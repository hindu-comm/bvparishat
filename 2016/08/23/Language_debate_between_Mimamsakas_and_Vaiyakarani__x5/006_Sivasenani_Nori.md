Pranam.

  

This is a very rich topic indeed. Three schools - Vedanta, Vyakarana and Mimamsa - and maybe Nirukta \[1\], believe that Sabda is nitya, whereas others believe that it is not so. The Sabdanityavadins also believe that the relation between Sabda and Artha is nitya. By the word "Sabda", all the Sabdanityavadins refer to an entity other than what is called as "sound" in English. Leaving the Vedantins aside for a while, while Mimamsakas believe that this other entity, which is the meaning-bearing one, is वर्णानुपूर्वी, Vaiyakaranas believe that it is Sphota. Herein lies the difference in their theories of language.

  

While Vaiyakaranas believe that this world emanates from Sabda, Mimamsakas admit no beginning for the seen world (न कदाप्यनीदृशं जगत्). Now since SabdArthasambandha is nitya, artha also has to be nitya. Normally when we say "pot", the artha corresponding to pot-Sabda is the earthen vessel with a narrow neck etc. How can this be nitya? So, for Vaiyakaranas, artha is BauddhArtha - the mental concept of pot, whereas for Mimamsakas, it is the pot-ness, the jAti of pots, which has a pot-individual as a resort. jAti is nitya in the view of Mimamsakas; Vaiyakaranas also accept jAti, but as a phenomenal (vyAvahArika) reality; however, in the ultimate view they hold that Dravya (=Brahman) alone is real.

  

In this way, there is a clash at every level between the Realistic Mimamsakas and the Idealistic Vaiyakaranas. Indian literature is full of these views. At a primary level, Mahabhashya, Vakyapadiya and Slokavartika are the primary texts. Then the texts of Navyavyakarana and Navyanyaya treat this topic in great detail. Alankara Sastra heavily draws from both schools (and Nyaya). Mammata while discussing artha says जात्यादिर्जातिरेव वा। The first option follows Mahabhashya - चतुष्टयी शब्दानां प्रवृत्तिः, the second options follows the views of Mimamsakas. This gets interesting when it comes to Lakshana.

  

When it comes to meaning of sentence, within Mimamsa, there are two schools which give primacy to word-meaning and the sentence-meaning. In Vakyapadiya, Bhartrhari discusses both, but establishes pratibhA as the meaning of sentence.

  

In the case of pratyayas, it would not be incorrect to say that Kumarila discusses many pratyayas like kRtvasuc in far greater detail than most books on grammar. My teacher, Br. Ve. Prof. Korada Subrahmanyam garu, therefore says that Vayakaranam cannot be taught without Mimamsa.

  

Then we have the difference in SAbdabodha, with Vaiyakaranas giving importance to dhAtu and Mimamsakas to the pratyaya (though both finally give primacy to Verb, unlike Nyaya).

  

My apologies, if most of the above is well known to you. My intent was to show that this is a vast topic. If you give the context of your JijnAsA, and the specific areas of interest, the acclaimed scholars of this Parishat would be able to give the desired pointers.

  

In this particular topic, it would not be an exaggeration to say that BVP has some of the best scholars in the field in the entire world.

  

If you elaborate this topic, many interested people like yours truly would also benefit.
