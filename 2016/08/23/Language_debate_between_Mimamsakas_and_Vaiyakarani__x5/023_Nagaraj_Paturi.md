The page from Prof. Shukla's book with the title लोचन की स्वैरिता is not clearly visible.

  

I could read Prof. Pullela Sriramachandrudu, which is inTelugu.

  

Hiscomment about Abhinavagupta is that he, in the name of commentary of a book , attributes his own ideas to the author of the book that he comments.

  

Is this not part of the feature of many commentaries of many books?

  

Let us take the various Rasanishpatti vaadas, since that is close to the theme of the present thread.

  

All the vaadas are commentaries to Bharata's Rasa nishpatti sutra only.

  

Each vaada is a claim that that is what actually Bharata meant.

  

If Abhinava bharati isaccused to be attributing AG's own ideas to Bharata,every rasanishpattivaadi deserves to be accusedfor the same reason.

  

Similar argument applies to all the commentator's of Brahmasutras, Bhagavadgita, Yogasutras etc.

  

Our intellectual tradition evolved through commentaries only. Each new idea is a new interpretation of a source book.

  

Prof. Shukla 's 'own' (?) interpretation of Dhvanyaloka, 'differing with' AG, also can be justified in the spirit of such tradition only.

  

Let us think.
