It is not your email ID that caused the problem in the first mail.

But it appeared as

Ashay Naikyour name.  
  
Now with this old email ID

your name will be be Jayaprakash Mayya.

Now [ujayapramaiya]() your name will be something like mayya.

In the first post your mail ID, it aappeared as from bvp group to bvp group, sender and the receiver the same.

This the problem raised by Veeranarayana
