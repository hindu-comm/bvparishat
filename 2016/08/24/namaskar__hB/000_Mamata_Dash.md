Dear Vidvaanas,

with due respect to the scholars, I request for a help. I need a book nameHistorical Mahakavyas in Sanskrit: (11. to 15. Century A. D.), by Chandra Prabha. The search result says that it has been published by Bharat Bharati, in 1976. But some how I am not able to reach the correct address of the publisher.

I need book. I request the scholars to provide me book either hard or soft for which I will bear the expenditure.

with regards to all.

Mamata Dash
