Friends,  

 It is my ambition to create facilities by which a person keen to learn Sanskrit should be able to learn it without spending too much time and without incurring monetary expenditure. With that aim, I am moving towards the creation of an online e-Sanskrit Pathshala, which will render free service.  
  

As the next step in that direction, I have created a facility whereby a person who has reached the stage of understanding Sanskrit but cannot use the expression in his / her own writing or speech will be able to make good progress.  
  

Linguistics call this the transition from Passive to Active knowledge of a language. I am putting up here a link to a demo program for the prospective learners to see and try it. Those who wish to use the program may be directed to send me their email ID and other details. I shall then create for each of them a separate file to which he / she can keep copying the data and keep deleting it during the practice sessions.  
  

There are no charges. All I would expect is that the learner takes it seriously.  
  

Please bring it to the notice of those in your contract group who might find this facility useful.  
  

Here is the link:
