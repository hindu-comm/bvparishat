Depends on the style guide and what it is a part of (note/bibliography). Page 695 of Chicago Manual of Style (16th ed) says:

  

14.75 One author. In a note, the author's name is given in the normal order. In a bibliography, where names are arranged alphabetically, it is inverted (last name first ). See also 14.18.

    1. David Shields, The Thing about Life Is That One Day You'll Be Dead (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2008) .

    2. Roger Martin du Gard, Lieutenant-Colonel de Maumort, trans. Luc Brebion and Timothy Crouse (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2000).
