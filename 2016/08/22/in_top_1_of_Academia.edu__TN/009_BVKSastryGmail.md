Namaste



Let me rephrase the question by Ujjval Rajput and ask a basic question:




Do we have a native convention on ‘ How to say ‘ personal name’?
Articulating the question, along with its linked issues on ‘Naming’ it would read:



**What is the ‘ Sanskrit / Indian’ convention in stating the name of the person** in three parts as \< Sur name - First name – Middle Name –Last name of a person \> / \< Real name / Maiden name/ Alias \>..?

The name giving convention in three parts may not be of Indian tradition or origin ! This three part naming may be a super-imposition of a non-native way of \< Documenting Names for Records of Property and Posterity Memory \> 



There is a subhahsita on how to say and what to say when asked for the
name –‘ Atma Naama gurur naama..’- which may be for a different context of conversation. The literary connoisseurs of Bhasa plays – may recall a situation ‘ Where Abhimanyu was captured by Bhima and was asked to give his name’. Using the traditions of ‘Namakarana Samskara, which provides a guidance on ‘vyavahara naama / Loka naama as Samjnaa’,
can we get a ‘ Indian Stylistics and Style Rule-Guidance’ to say our name? OR should one be struck to the ‘ Name-Style Convention of Style Manuals which mainly focus on European naming convention for document referencing’ ? Is it unique identification issue Or fall in line with a global (forced) practice-convention? Do we have a freedom to say our name in our way ? OR surrender this freedom ?





There is another dimension to look for ! The existing practices in the Birth and Death Certificates, School Certificates, Pass ports and the like. These are totally different from the ‘ Publication Author Name referencing Conventions of Style-Manual’. The current worldly practice on how to say Indian names comes as a legacy which may be explored in the following links.



- On Surname: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surname> . The way of giving surnames underwent a change to address ‘ discrimination issues against women’. “What's in a name” written by Kalpana Sharma (The Hindu, March 7, 2010) highlights the problems faced by women ( and Women authors) when their names change after marriage.

- UK Guide to naming - <https://www.fbiic.gov/public/2008/nov/Naming_practice_guide_UK_2006.pdf>
- Names are a valuable source of information. They can indicate gender, marital status, birthplace, nationality, ethnicity, religion, and position within a family or even within a society. However, naming practices vary enormously across the globe. The aim of this guide is to identify the knowledge that can be gained from names about their holders and to help overcome difficulties that are commonly encountered with names of foreign origin. The sections of the guide are governed by nationality and/or ethnicity, depending on the influencing factor upon the naming practice, such as religion, language or geography. Inevitably, this guide is not exhaustive and any feedback or suggestions for additional sections will be welcomed.

**Simply, If we say our name in someone else’s style, the day will not be far when we loose our identity and become someone else ! Would that be a ‘digestion or distortion, surrender or loyalty issue ’ ?**

** A reason good enough for Battle :Sanskrit Names and Swadesi Indology
? **
