From a long time , Academia.edu has been informing me that I have been in the top 2% of researchers on Academia.edu by 30 day views.

  

Yesterday they sent me a message"You are now in the top 1% of researchers on Academia.edu by 30 day views."

  

I do not know whether this is common and happens with all the researchers there.

  

But I was happy to have received that message. Wanted to share with the list members.

  

Sharing the screenshot of the message.
