The rank fluctuation has happened with me many times. My page has been among top 3%, top 3%, top 1% and even top 0.5% (for a short period of time) over the last few months (right now it is among top 1%). A ranking may improve if views spike when a new paper is uploaded or if an old paper is searched/downloaded by many users. The Analytics feature of [academia.edu](http://academia.edu) shows you views per day, and you can get some ideas from there.

  

Some rankings are quite stable, for example Dominik Wujastyk has been among top 0.1% for quite some time (he has many paper uploaded and thousands of followers).
