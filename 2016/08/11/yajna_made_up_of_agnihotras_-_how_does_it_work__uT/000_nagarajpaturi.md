Starting a new thread as an offshoot of the thread on Bhopal gas tragedy and havan.

  

The word yajna has very broad meaning (s) in the vast Vedic literature. Many activities including family management have been called yajna (गृहमेधि‌)

  

But here we are discussing the original, central, core idea of yajna, yajna performed in the form of dropping materials into fire.

  

1\. Gita provides a very good key to understand this concept through statements, one in the 8th and the other in the 15th chapters:

  

In the 8th, we have अधियज्ञोहमेवात्र देहेस्मिन् देहभृतां वर । (8-4‌) In the 15th we have अहं वैश्वानरो भूत्वा प्राणिनां देहमाश्रितः ,प्राणापंसमायुक्तः पचाम्यन्नं चतुर्विधं ॥ (15-14)

  

Combining these two, we get that chaturvidhaahaarapachanaroopayajna is being conducted in dEha andthe 'fire' in which the yajna is being conducted is vais'vaanaraagni. aahaara thus processed reaches various dEvatas (components of healthy functioning of the body) or is stolen away byraakShasas (factors causing unhealthy functioning of the body).

  

Day to day food taking is meant for the sustenance and strengthening of the body. It is paushTika yajna.

  

Medicines taken in are meant either to kill the raakshasas or to strengthen the dEvatas in their fight with the raakshasas. This is s'aantika yajna.

  

2\. Taking this as a model, we can understand the general yajna as a similar process taking place in the body of viraaTpurusha.

  

3\. Such a yajna keeps taking place in the viraaTpurusha's dEha all by itself, all the time. That yajna is described in purusha sUkta. 

. Each ecosystem and its self=regulated and self-sustained process is a yajna. Cosmic eco system is a huge eco system made up of several sub eco systems, a huge yajna run through several sub-yajnas.

  

यज्ञेन यज्ञ मयजन्त देवाः means this only. (That what are called as dEvatas in the Vedic tradition are in fact nature forcesis well known)

  

तानि धर्माणि प्रथमान्यासन् means that this natural ecological process was emulated and imitated by mahimaanah = the great founders of yajna. ( तेह नाकं महिमान स्सचंते)

  

Wild fires etc. mentioned by Prof. Rani in the thread mentioned above are all the natural processes on the basis of which yajnas were designed.

  

4\. Whenwe observe that industrial pollution is causing ecological disasters, what we in fact observe is the strengthening of the raakshasa aspects the cosmic eco system. (Why are raakshasas depicted as throwing unhealthy material into the yajnas?, the consequences strengthen them)

  

5\. Humans are asked to feed the dEvas ('nature forces')through yajnaand get benefitted by them in return.

सहयज्ञाः प्रजाः सृ‍ष्ट्वा पुरोवाच प्रजापतिः ।

अनेन प्रसविष्यध्वमेष वोस्त्विष्टकामधुक् ॥ 3\\-10॥

देवान्भावयतानेन ते देवा भावयन्तु वः ।

परस्परं भावयन्तः श्रेयः परमवाप्स्यथ ॥ 3\\-11॥

इष्टान्भोगान्हि वो देवा दास्यन्ते यज्ञभाविताः ।

तैर्दत्तानप्रदायैभ्यो यो भुं‍क्ते स्तेन एव सः ॥ 3\\-12॥

यज्ञशिष्टाशिनः सन्तो मुच्यन्ते सर्वकिल्बिषैः ।

भुङ्ते ते त्वघं पापा ये पचन्त्यात्मकारणात् ॥ 3\\-13॥

  

6.That all this was viewed as a cyclic process is clear from the verses immediately succeeding the above verses.

  

The phrase एवं प्रवर्तितं चक्रं is clearly used.

  

Not following such an ecological cycle is said to be the consequence of sensualist (indriyaaraama) mentality.

  

अन्नाद्भवन्ति भूतानि पर्जन्यादन्नसम्भवः ।

यज्ञाद्भावंति पर्जन्यो यज्ञः कर्मसमुद्भवः ॥ 3\\-14॥

कर्म ब्रह्मोद्भवम् विद्धि ब्रह्माक्षरसमुद्भवम् ।

तस्मात्सर्वगतं ब्रह्म नित्यं यज्ञे प्रतिष्ठितम् ॥ 3\\-15॥

एवं प्रवर्तितं चक्रं नानुवर्तयतीह यः ।

अघायुरिन्द्रियारामो मोघं पार्थ स जीवति ॥ 3\\-16॥

7\. Just as our food taking is paushTika (nourishing ) and s'aantika ( disease-curing), general yajnastoo are paushTika (nourishing ) and s'aantika ( disease-curing) for the body of the cosmic eco system.
