Dear fellow-scholars,  
  

As you are all aware, a systematic and academic critiquing of the ideas and approaches of Western Indologists has begun in the series of conferences called **Swadeshi Indology Conference Series.**

In continuation with our first, and very successful, effort of Swadeshi Indology Conference - 1 (**SI-1**), held at IIT-Madras, in July 2016, we are happy to announce the **Second Conference (SI-2)**in the series. This is to be held towards the end of **January, 2017.** Details of the exact dates and venue will soon follow.

The present conference (SI-2) is considering a total of **ten topics** (inclusive of the four that were considered in SI-1). The topics, as well as a brief write-up about the position of the Western Indologists (Prof. Sheldon Pollock, specifically) are provided in the **link below**. In addition, we also provide therein indications of Reading Material useful for an appreciation of the issues. As indicated in the link, much of the reading material is already available in the public domain. Those that are not available will be supplied to *bona fide* participants.

It is very essential thattraditional scholars involve themselves in large numbers. The numerous and serious challenges posed by Western Indologists, enormous in number, have remained uncritiqued by Indian scholars in any **systematic and scholarly**manner for well over a century, except for certain individual and sporadic efforts. This constitutes a very big lacuna on our part, and must be remedied with immediate attention and high priority.

It is hoped that in this series ofconferences- where*ad hominem*attacks will be banned â€“ we develop a responsible and responsive scholarship to handle the intellectual challenges of our times.  

Scholars are requested to make an **expression of interest** by way of sending an **Abstract** of about 300 words which must be sent to the undersigned **on or before 31st August 2016**. Further and fuller details are available in the link provided below.
