I guess Dr. Bhat meant “It is wrong and it is a printing error.” It is certainly wrong. With the इञ् suffix the form would be दाशरथि as shown in standard works.

  

I may also add that I would rather not rely on a book that sacrifices accuracy in transliterating दशरथि \[sic\] as Dasarathihi. If they use 's' to transcribe the palatal श, how do they transcribe the dental स? If the answer is again 's', how does the book distinguish between स्वजन/श्वजन, सकल/शकल, and सकृत्/शकृत्. How can we have a book on Sanskrit grammar unable to distinguish between श and स? It's sacrilege: the publishers need to be hanged, drawn, and quartered (I am joking, of course).
