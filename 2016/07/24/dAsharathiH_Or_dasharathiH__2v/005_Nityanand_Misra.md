It is likely the दशरथि readings are typos/digitization errors.

Sanskritdocuments.org site is largely unedited (no editorial board) and has typos/digitizationerrors in many texts. The above verse occurs in the Ramaraksastotram attributed to Budhakausika also. The Gita Press editions of the Ramaraksastotram have the दाशरथिः reading.

This I guess is from wikisource, which is also prone to typos/digitizationerrors, would be good to see what reading printed editions have.
