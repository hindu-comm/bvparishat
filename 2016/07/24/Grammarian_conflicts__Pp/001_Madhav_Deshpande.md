Dear Dhaval-ji,

  

  I wholeheartedly support this suggestion. We need detailed studies pointing out differences in the interpretations offered for Panini by various different sub-schools. Along with the differences between Kāśikā and Siddhāntakaumudī, we need more contrastive studies elucidating differences between 1) Prakriyākaumudī school and Bhaṭṭoji School, 2) Laghuśabdaratna of Nāgeśa and Bṛhat-Śabdaratna of Haridīkṣita, 3) Bhaṭṭoji school and Nārāyaṇabhaṭṭa's Prakriyākaumudī, 4) Kaiyaṭa and Nāgeśabhaṭṭa. Similarly, we need studies indicating development of thought, continuities and differences, between Pāṇini, Kātyāyana, Patañjali and Bhartṛhari. Besides these, we need comparative and contrastive studies between the different schools of Sanskrit grammar beyond Pāṇini. There is a lot of scope for such studies. Thanks for bringing up this topic.
