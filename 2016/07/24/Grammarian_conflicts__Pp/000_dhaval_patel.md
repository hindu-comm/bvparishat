Respected scholars,  
I was wondering whether there are already published books which have already recorded conflicts between views of different grammarians of Paninian grammar system e.g. difference of opinion between kaumudikAra and kAzikAkAra, or bAlamanoramA and tattvabodhinI etc. Some published book or Ph.D. thesis directed in this direction would be welcome. The goal is to have a good set of research questions for future researchers in Grammar field.

I know that the grammar commentaries have recorded the differences at appropriate places. What I am looking for is some systemic study of these remarks sUtrawise or prakaraNawise.
