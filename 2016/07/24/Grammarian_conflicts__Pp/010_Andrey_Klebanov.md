Dear Prof. Deshpande et al,

as for sites listing PhD thesises along with their digitalized versions, you may have a look at this:  
<http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in>

I believe, there was also an extensive list (alas, just a list) of PhD's particularly related to Sanskrit studies hosted by Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, but I couldn't find it right now. Hope, someone else may be helpful here.

Andrey
