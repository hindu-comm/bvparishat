Ashok Aklujkar suggested "(b) the lists of dissertations completed at Indian universities should be particularly rewarding in pursuing the suggested research direction." I have two related questions. What is the source for such lists of Indian dissertations, and whether there are any plans like the DLI project to make these, often unpublished, dissertations available widely in a scanned form. During my previous visits to Pune, I had a few such unpublished dissertations photocopied for my personal use. But they should be widely made available.
Perhaps, the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan can undertake such a very useful project. Any information on efforts in this directions would be appreciated. Living in the USA for the last 48 years, and continuing to do so in the remaining years of my life, online access to research materials in India (and elsewhere) is becoming more and more important to me.
