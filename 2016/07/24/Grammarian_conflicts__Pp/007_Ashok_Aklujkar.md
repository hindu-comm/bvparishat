Along with the differences between Kāśikā and Siddhāntakaumudī, we need more contrastive studies elucidating differences between 1) Prakriyākaumudī school and Bhaṭṭoji School, 2) Laghuśabdaratna of Nāgeśa and Bṛhat-Śabdaratna of Haridīkṣita, 3) Bhaṭṭoji school and Nārāyaṇabhaṭṭa's Prakriyākaumudī, 4) Kaiyaṭa and Nāgeśabhaṭṭa. Similarly, we need studies indicating development of thought, continuities and differences, between Pāṇini, Kātyāyana, Patañjali and Bhartṛhari. Besides these, we need comparative and contrastive studies between the different schools of Sanskrit grammar beyond Pāṇini.  
  

Superior studies are always possible, but the following should be noted as starters;  
  
Sharma, Mahesh Dutt. 1974. The Kāśikā-vṛtti and the Vaiyākaraṇa-siddhānta-kaumudī: a Comparative Study. Poona-7: Centre of Advanced Study in Sanskrit, University of Poona-7. \[The work is in Sanskrit\].  
  
Shastri, Bhim Sen. 1979. A Study of \[Jinendra-buddhi’s\] Nyāsa. Dillī: Bhaimī Prakāśana. \[The work is in Hindi\].  
  
Mumukshu, Raghuvir. 1977. A Critical Study of the Kāśikā. Delhi: Nag Publisher. \[The work is in Hindi\].  
  
Miśra, Ādyā Prasāda. 1966. Prakriyā-kaumudī-vimarśaẖ. Varanasi: Sarasvatī Bhavana Studies. \[\[The work is in Sanskrit\].  
  
Joshi, Venkatesh Laxman. 1966. \[Introduction and Appendices to his edition of \] Prauḍha-manoramā with Commentary Śabda-ratna of Hari Dīkṣita. Vol. I. Poona: Deccan College Monograph Series \[no.\] 31. The subsequent volumes of this edition do not seem to have been published. The appendices have also been published separately earlier in 1964 as vol. 31-A of the same series.  
  
These are the ones I could easily think of and find in my (idiosyncratically constituted) personal library. There must be other relevant publications which help in addressing the need felt by Dr. Dhaval Patel and Prof. Madhav M. Deshpande (I would surprised if the latter is not already aware of many of the publications I have listed). A perusal of (a) Prof. Cardona’s surveys of Pāṇinian studies and (b) the lists of dissertations completed at Indian universities should be particularly rewarding in pursuing the suggested research direction.
