Dear Nityanand Mishra mahodaya,

It is such a heartening news that so many sanskritists are honored and such a number of awards are instituted by the UP government! I congratulate both the awardees and the government. I am especially spellbound by the singularly unique achievements of poet abhiraja Rajendra Mishra ji. May this pride of Sanskrit live long with glory.

Regards

Ganesh

Regards
