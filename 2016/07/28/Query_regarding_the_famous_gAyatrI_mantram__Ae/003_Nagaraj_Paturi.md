In most of the books such as Grihyasutras, where Upanayana vidhi or Sandhyopasana is discussed, the mantra and the ritual using it are referred to , quite often, with the name of the dEvatA sAvitrI and only occasionally with the name of the Chandas gAyatrI.

  

It is certainly a very interesting case of Chandas of a mantra acquiring such a great importance as to become the alternative name for the dEvatA of the mantra. But the source of significance is the dEvatA of the mantra only.
