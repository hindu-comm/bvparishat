नमस्ते विजयकृष्ण जी,  
  
The गायत्री मन्त्रम् (RV 03.62.10) leads one to the hymn RV 03.62 which has 18 richa-s in total, addressed to देवताs in this order: 1-3 इन्द्रावरुण, 4-6 ब्रह्मणस्पति , 7-9 पूषन्, 10-12 सवितृ, 13-15 सोम, and 16-18 मित्रावरुण.  
  
Of these, we set aside 1-3, and 16-18 that extol dvandva gods इन्द्रावरुण and मित्रावरुण and are used to have आवृत the main part 4-15.  
  
Mapping "ॐ bhur bhuvah svah" to 4-6, 7-9, 10-12 and 13-15 gives:  
  
ॐ \~ ब्रह्मणस्पति  
भू \~ पूषन्  
भुवन \~ सवितृ  
स्वर् \~ सोम  
  
That is, ब्रह्मणस्पति, पूषन्, सवितृ, and सोम are the अधिपतिs of, or the same as, the threefold-realms (3 rica-s each) ॐ, भू, भुवन, and स्वर्, respectively.  
  
गायत्री मन्त्र is the key, the hymn 03.62 is the lock, and वेद is the treasure. The mantra of itself says, "सवितृ, WAKE US UP."  
  
The key restores, wakes up, us to the Map of the Veda. The Rsis - our forefathers - were considerate: they didn't simply had us bogged down in a state of permanent bewilderment with things that were always going to be more than our talents could handle.  
  
The knowledge of गायत्री मन्त्र has resurfaced (for wider circulation) give or take only four years ago (aided no doubt by its continuous tradition), but has since remained underground - among only a handful of आस्तिकs.  
  
The problem with this age is, not the scarcity of information, but the excess of it.
