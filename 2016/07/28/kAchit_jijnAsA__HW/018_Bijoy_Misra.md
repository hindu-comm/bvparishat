Dear Nagrajji,

The problem could be more complex. I have difficulty in accepting if Prakrit

is a dialect to Sanskrit. I have reason to believe Prakrit is rooted in the

oral literature of India where flexibility is a cognitive variable. I cannot

get into a major discussion on this for a year (studying).

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
