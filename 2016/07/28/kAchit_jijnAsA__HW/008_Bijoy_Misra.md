*Yes it is true that none of our shastras are prescriptive.*  

*  
*

While I enjoyed this thread for its exposition, I think this last statement is too general.

Even Panini creates description as he observes locally or uses material seen by Yaska and

others before him. He takes them further to create "rules.". This extrapolation is bold and

appears analytic. We just went through the example दाशरथी in a different thread.

This is where Panini's prescription comes into language use. 

  

So would be the story of Astronomy. Some observations are descriptive.
But from them

one creates a prescriptive system for the future. Such system could hold and may get

modified depending on the assumptions applied. New observations might contradict the

prescription. Not so with the language. The prescription creates it.
That the prescription

had held so far and we champion its validity simply puts Panini as a stern teacher.

He is kind occasionally to create exceptions when he heard that people were using

words differently. There is no astronomical prescription of a yellow moon versus an

orange moon.

  

The prescription continues in mathematics, geometry and health sciences. How we may

discover general rules from a sample of observations is the triumph of insight. What i wanted

to suggest was the language becomes an imposed phenomenon, while nature continues

to generate new samples.
