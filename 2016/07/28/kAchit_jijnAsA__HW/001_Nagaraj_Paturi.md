This descriptive - prescriptive classification itself is a problematic one.

  

The sUtras of AA are all descriptive only, none of them prescriptive in their syntax/structure/mood.

  

But its users used it as an anus'aasanam with rakshOhAgamalaghvasandEhAh as prayOjanam.

  

The definition "vyAkriyantE anEna s'abdAh iti vyAkaraNam" gives a descriptive view of it.

  

Since both are from Bhagavaan Patanjali only it may be seen that AA has been viewed as both a descriptive book and anus'aasanam simultaneously in the same tradition.

  

Is it a contradiction?

  

No.

  

Because many good descriptions have been taken prescriptively and many books (such as Dharmas'Astra books)which are being talked about as prescriptive books (vidhi books), when you take a closer look at the sentence structure/mood are turn out to be descriptive only.

  

This is true with many modern western books not limited to the fields of grammar and the like.

  

One good example that comes to my mind is the theory of bureaucracy of Max Weber. What he did was only description of bureaucracy as one of the social organizations only. But it so turned out that as long as Classical Bureaucracy was prevalent in business management and public administration, his description was used as almost a prescription.

  

That is how it happens.

  

When this nature of things is not realized, some books, particularlyancient books, particularly grammarsare blamed for being prescriptive (quite often without any evidence in their expression) and modern books are claimed to be descriptive and it is taught to students that writing grammars descriptively is the right approach found in modern books which is not found in ancient books.
