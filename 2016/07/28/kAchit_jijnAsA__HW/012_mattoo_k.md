Dear scholars

I once again emphasis that our shastras are though descriptive in nature looking from the high pedestal (tattavik)but when it comes to common platform where human nature is destined to error the shastras come out to be prescrptive. Just as a doctor prescribes medicine only when there is some deficiency in my body-function. If i would have a perfect body(? )no question of being prescriptive but once it is deficient he has to prescribe so the narrative vis-a-vis descriptive shastras have prescriptive tone.

  

The dual function has to be accepted from this point of views.
