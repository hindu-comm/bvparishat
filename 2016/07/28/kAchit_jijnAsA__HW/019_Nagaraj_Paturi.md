\> I have reason to believe Prakrit is rooted in the oral literature of India where flexibility is a cognitive variable.

  

Before you get ready into a discussion, let me add a few points to ponder over:

  

1\. Languages are not rooted in literature ,it is the other way round.

  

2\. The Vedas are the oral literature whose medium is the Vedic language.

  

3\. Researchers look at a huge amount of Sanskrit literature to be written documentation of oral Sanskrit literature.

  

4\. Prakrits have oral and written literature both.
