\> While Sanskrit has a signature of its own due to Panini, Oriya is flooded with dialects, where each dialect may appear as a separate

language.

  

-------Situation is the same with Sanskrit too Prof. Misra.Prakrits are Sanskrit's dialects only.

  

That a language has dialects does not indicate its 'flexibility'. Oriya too has its 'standard' form , a form which is used by the speakers of all its dialectsto communicate among themselves. Uniformity across the regions and relatively greater stability in comparison to the dialects are the features are the standard form of any language. These two features : uniformity across space and stability through the passage of time are requiredfor the standard form of any language for it to be able to perform its functions. To maintain these features of the standard form is called standardization. Grammarsof the standard form play the role of this standardization. Due to this feature , standard forms always create a popular impression or illusion rather, of being frozen.

  

Sanskrit getting frozen due to AA is a similar popular impression/illusion.

  

Certainly grammars of standard forms, as part of their standardizing function do reduce the rapidity of change.

  

That is what AA too did to Sanskrit.
