Dear Prof.Nagaraj Paturiji,

I am thankful for your detailed well-argued response to my earlier posting .While I am also thankful to you for addressing me with an unearned epithet the burden of which is too heavy for my lean shoulders, I would be grateful if I am just addressed as Murthy or Murthyji*.*

I am very glad that my suggestion is not orthodox and there are other votaries to the view..

I also agree that any language could be analyzed by building up a data base and analyzing its characteristics. I believe something similar is being done in machine translation of languages.

However to say that in a similar manner one could study natural phenomena (domain of science) ab initio is not meaningful. Science is a quest for truth that is amenable to human sensory perception and logic. Although much in the field of science is mapped, much more remains unmapped. Language on the other hand evolves over millennia like an organism and at any given point of time has defined characteristics, with some spread due to dialects. It is therefore meaningful to catch those characteristics through computer analysis.

As regards discerning the characteristics of Sanskrit through computer analysis of its usage in Ramayana, Mahabharata and other classics, pioneering work has been done by several universities, notably in Germany and Japan, by digitizing the texts. It may not be difficult to study usage of words (nouns, verbs, indeclinables etc) and syntax in a digitized text.

All said and done, Sanskrit is a difficult language to master and but for Panini who was able to provide a strong and durable structure through his epoch-making work, it might have become one of the many lost languages. But Panini’s work is also of formidable complexity and many eager students of Sanskrit flounder while climbing the mountain of Ashtadhyayi and fail to learn either Panini or Sanskrit .

It is this which prompts me to suggest that usage of Sanskrit in well-known works of Sanskrit be analyzed so that we could arrive at a vocabulary and a set of rules of grammar that will suffice for all practical purposes.

Warm Regards,

Murthy
