Dear Vidvatkaviji,

  

I am happy to see that I was able to communicate my point.

  

Coming to simpler and easier tools to learn Sanskrit, there have been, from time to time, a very big number of attempts towards this purpose, many tools have been created as aresult.

  

Right from the days of the modakaistaadaya story of kathaasaritsaagara, there is a reflection ofsuch an urge for shorter made easy tools.

  

Books like siddhaanta kaumudi, their large, medium and small versions, Kos'as like Amara's, S'abdamanjaris and Dhatu tablesetc. etc. are all results of such efforts only.

  

Ishared details of many contemporary attempts in [this thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/bvparishat/Sanskrit$20teaching%7Csort:relevance/bvparishat/CxyeeTpHz3E/V_YiHipwNQAJ) of BVP.

  

As Prof. Amba Kulkarni informed us using computer for corpus collection work is also on.

  

Yoursuggested program I hope will contribute to such attempts in a new big way.

  

Regards,

  

Nagaraj
