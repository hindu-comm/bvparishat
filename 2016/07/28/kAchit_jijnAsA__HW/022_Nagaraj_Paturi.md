Dear Vidvatkavi Sri GSSMurtyji,

  

Your suggestion is not so unorthodox.

  

In fact, it is well accepted and well established idea of Sanskrit (and as an influence of that) idea of Indian tradition that lakshaNa is not necessarily what is found in the book of lakshaNa, it is the set of rules running through a corpus of lakshyas of a system, say, a language.

  

It is also a traditional idea that there are two ways of knowing /learning lakshaNa: 1. through one's own observation of the lakshyas 2. through a lakshaNa book.

  

It is such a traditional idea thatsuch a staunch custodian of tradition as his holiness Jagadguru S'ankaracharya Sri Sri Sri Bharati Tirtha swami himself in one of the videos recently shared on BVP that there can not be a language that is able to function as a language that does not have grammar irrespective of whether that grammar is written down /formulated in the form of a set of rules or not.

  

All those who are able to speak grammatically correct English can be said to know English grammar. All of them need not have learnt it from a grammar book such as Wren and Martin. Most of them, particularly nowadays learn grammatically correct English, by that stretch English grammar, just byobserving /reading/listening grammatically correct English.

  

All such people can be said to have learnt English directly from lakshyas, notwith the help of a lakshaNa book.

  

To take the help of a computer in creating a lakshaNa of the language, afresh,directly from lakshyas is not a bad idea. In fact that can be done for all the languages, why only for Sanskrit.

  

As you have already noted, in the case of each rich language, it is going to be a very big project, that can keep many people all over the world busy.

  

Some may look at this exercise as reinventing the wheel. Some may predict that wemay just be validating Panini and other laakshaNikas at the end of the whole laborious exercise.

  

But it does not hurt to collect all the facts /observations that have been generalized as various disciplines such as physics and create the disciplines all over again, afresh, right from the scratch. Who knows? There could be many useful and pleasant surprises from and through the process.
