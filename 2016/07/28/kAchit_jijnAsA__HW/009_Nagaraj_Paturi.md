1\. Descriptive grammar rules of a language when read by the mother tongue/first language speaker are taken as descriptive. But the same are taken as prescriptive by the second language speaker of that language.

  

2\. Overtly prescriptive rules are provided to the first language speaker too for pedagogical standardization purposes.

  

3\. Descriptive rules are used as prescriptive rules by the mother tongue speaker of the described language too when the variety of the mother tongue described, say classical variety, is not the variety spoken by the speaker, but the speaker wants to use.

  

4\. When Panini uses, say, Chandasi, to whom is he prescribing that usage? No one can newly create Chandas, the Veda.

  

5\. It can not be said that in 'Chandasi' he is descriptive and in 'Bhaashaayaam' he is prescriptive. Following the principle of consistency one has to agree that all bhaashaayaam rules are descriptive just as chandasi rules are.

  

6\. \> That the prescription had held so far and we champion its validity simply puts Panini as a stern teacher.He is kind occasionally to create exceptions when he heard that people were using words differently.

  

As shown under #4 & #5 above, since Painini's rules are clearly descriptive, taking them as descriptive or prescriptive depends on the contexts /cases #1, #2 & #3.

  

Since taking it prescriptively is the user's act , sternness or kindness do not belong to Panini.

  

So Panini listing alternative usages to the 'mainly' described usage only further confirms that what the book is doing is doing is description of vyavahaara.

  

7. The word vyavahaara occurs so frequently in Vakyapadiyam and Hari emphasizes vyavahaara of the s'ishTa (and not even of a rishi) is binding for the rule-maker so vehemently that it very clearly establishes that AA is looked at as vyavahaara-describing book. Whose vyavahaara is described ? Of the s'ishTas. If s'ishTawhose first language/ mother tongue is the described language, the consequence of the use is standardization.

  

8.Those who are taking it as prescriptive are doing so because the language described is not their mother tongue.
