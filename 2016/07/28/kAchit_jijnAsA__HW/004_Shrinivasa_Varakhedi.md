The view expressed by Sri Nagaraj Ji is very much right. No part in Vyakarana is prescriptive in nature though the sutras formally look like prescriptive.

  

In fact all our Shastras are descriptive only. They teach us the 'Niyama's (natural rules). For example, the sandhi rules in grammar book are the definition of vocal chard and its behaviour in the context of co-occurence of two syllables. In other words, Panini is explaining the the invariable relationship between the two events - the cause and affect. This is nothing but Vyapti relation between the co-occurence of two syllables and their mix during pronunciation. Thus, Panini is not at all giving any prescription how to pronounce, rather giving an explanation how our vocal chard behaves in such contexts.

  

Even in the case of Dharma Shastra, which is believed to be a strictly prescriptive in nature by ruling injunctions and prohibitions, this view holds good. All such injunctions are just meant to show the cause and affect relation between the act and its results. It is very well said in philosophical texts by the term - ishta-saadhanataa (being cause for desired result). This is what the meaning of any vidhi (rule) - is the opinion of Nyaya and other non-meemammsaka philosophers.

  

Hence, all shastric vidhis are to be taken as descriptions. The descriptions are told in the vidhi form to make the people understand in an easy way to follow - what to do and what not to do. This does not mean that they are just Do's and Dont's ; They are descriptions.
