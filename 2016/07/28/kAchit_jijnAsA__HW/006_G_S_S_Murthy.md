Dear scholars,

AS an aside to the discussion going on through this thread, may I express my unorthodox views?

Panini built a magnificent artificial structure to explain and expand Sanskrit as he knew. It has stood the test of time and will be there for long.

However, with the technology available through computers and programming, we could look at Sanskrit in a new way.

1\. Try to list usages of Sanskrit words in major classics like Ramayana, Mahabharata and Mahakavyas. It would be a gigantic data base. I believe the database will cover the vocabulary that is adequate enough for most purposes.

2\. Using techniques of data-analytics and data mining, arrive at rules that can be discerned through the usage.The rules arrived at would not be based on Paninian structure. It could be entirely different.

I believe such an approach is feasible although it may be a large and major project running over several years.

The sceptic may say, "Why waste our efforts when Panini has done it for us?" My answer is " We don't know. The project may come up with a simpler form of grammar and many may be attracted to Sanskrit. Sanskrit may become a dynamic, living language"

Scholars may like to give a thought to the idea.

Regards,

Murthy
