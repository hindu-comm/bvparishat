True. Every regional languages allow much flexibility. One cannot go on allowing flexibility infinitely. And wherever one puts the restriction one falls within the orbit of prescription. For instance, “so far and no further”like command. 

I do not know but it is my understanding. Every law (niyam) cut both side. 1. Description 2. Prescription 3.finally usages.
