Namaste



A thread of interesting discussion, where divergent views on ‘Why and How of Sanskrit Study ’ – are presented.



This opens up several critical questions on perception of ‘What is Samskrutham: The language of the documents used in ‘Bharateeya Shaastra -Vidwat paramparaa ? ( I am deliberately avoiding the use of the expression Vedic , Indian, Sanskrit – in relation to keep the focus on ‘language’ and ‘grammar’ part of the debate. My friend Dr. N R Joshi asks this simple question - -(संस्कृतं नाम किम्) ).



Here are my notes with requests for additional clarifications. I believe this will build critical inputs to define the linked issue of ‘Battle for Sanskrit’ and proposal of ‘Swa-Deshi Indology’ as ‘ battle –ammunition’.



It is a long post, with multi-scholar input, all connected. The consolidation of earlier posts is placed at the end of this post( \*).

Please bear with the long post. There are no one –liner questions and half-word answers in such a serious and complex deliberation.



I am consolidating\* several posts by scholars as they present, to facilitate a frame for the \< Big Project Challenge> of discovering and restoring \< Yoga way of learning Samskrutham= Vak-Yoga= Yoga-Samskrutham>.



1. My arguments are built around two words: **‘Darshana –Shaaastra**
and **Bhaashaa- Shaastra,** which are well known and in practical use. ( This was the criterion pointed in an earlier post by Professor Korada, to choose the words for deliberation. At this stage, you may
take my below statements as a hypothesis, if it facilitates smoother reading ).



**Statement -1 (Using the word ‘Darshana –Shaaastra)** : **Shaastra teaching should yield Darshana as Experience. Darshna is Analytically documented as Shaastra.**

** (**(शास्त्राध्ययनफलं दर्शनम् ;
शास्त्रम् नाम दर्शन -व्याख्यानं , दर्शन-व्याकरणं , विधि -नियम –निषेध विशेष बोधकः, विनियोगार्थं अनुशासनम्, इष्टकामार्थ सिद्धये ; )** )**



 (All) Shaastra’s are deeply and integrally connected with ‘ Visioning (Revelation, a transcendental process that forms the base and basic of language). Darshana gets expressly articulated as Shaastra. The teaching of Shaastra is to facilitate the ‘ (Shuddha –Sampoorna -SphuTa) Darshana’ as an experience (Anubhava).



**Statement -2 (Using the word ‘Bhaashaa- Shaastra / ‘ bhaashaa-prayoga’ )** : **The language of Shaastra determines the Standardization and Standard usage of Language. Bhashaa -Shaastra teaching should yield Bhashaa-Darshana as (Vak-Yoga) Experience. **

**(**(; शास्त्रेण नियमः क्रियते, भाषा शास्त्रेण भाषा-नियमः क्रियते ; व्याख्यानतो शास्त्रज्ञानम् , तपसा दर्शनम्
)** )**

The pedagogy of language-usage for engagement with Shaastra needs to have an excellence of ‘Yoga’ ( covering Unification, Integrity, In-connectedness, Application :: The clarity on
VI-NI- YOGA (विनियोग) – as my friend Dr. Yadu Moharir keeps stressing ; a word which comes in Yoga-Sutra ).



2**. In relation to these two well known words, which are poorly translated as ‘ Discipline of Philosophy (Darshana Shaastra)- making the deliberation a hyper cerebral verbiage creation and Linguistics ( Rules and convention of Practical Social, Street usage of language, under which ‘ rules of literary and technical usage of language are positioned for assessment and course correction as Standard’. ), I seek the following clarifications:**



2a) **Amba Kulkarni** : **Who decides the sufficiency of vocabulary,
rules of grammar and practical purpose to fit in a 15 hour study ?**
The programmer, the software designer , content provider, the
university, or the user community ? (कस्मै देवाय संस्कृत भाषया विधेम )
It is tricky debate like how much cloth and what type of cloth is ‘ necessary and sufficient’ to pass the test of ‘ not naked’ ? which is totally different from asking the question: What are the norms of ‘
well dressed and appropriate for the occasion’ ? ( (अनग्नता - कौपीनमात्रः - वस्त्रालंकार- संयुक्तः - It is analogous to the debate of
differentiating Prakrutham from Samskrutham?)

Can this be program be applied to one target sentence \< श्री-राम-नामाऽहं दाशरथिः, भवन्तं अभिवादये > and Train the learner to get acquainted with sufficient rules of grammar to form similarly communicative sentences ? in 15 hour study program ?



The expectation of design pedagogy under language education program is to facilitate the learner to learn the standard usage of language ( not limited to specific sentences and contexts only) and apply it in a language-context appropriate way. The program should help to build a ‘ Speaker of language’ and not force a ‘ learner to be machine –program dependent’. ((वाक्य / काव्य सुभाषित -तात्पर्य-ग्रहणं भाषा-ग्रहण -प्रयोग व्याख्यान कौशलात् भिन्नम् ) . The purpose of ‘lakshya –lakshana samanvaya’ pedagogy that the machine program needs has to be ‘ defect free (अदोष - निर्दुष्ट ). 



2b-1)** Nagaraj Paturi**: On \< lakshaNa, it is the set of rules running through a corpus of lakshyas of a system, say, a language\>
What are the ‘ lakshyas’ that should get covered in developing such a ‘ Simplified Practical Sanskrit learning’? – On What criterion should the filtering be done ? Can ‘ Vishwamitra Gayatri mantra’ and ‘ starting simple prayer, say – namaH sUryAya chandrAya’ be clubbed together, as they are widely used ‘ lakshyas? How to teach the difference between the two kinds of ‘ lakshya’s’ here ? Which of the two ways of tradition \< of knowing /learning lakshaNa: 1. through one's own observation of the lakshyas 2. through a lakshaNa book.> would you recommend ? for a global usage? 



2b-2)** Nagaraj Paturi**: On On the observation \< All those who are able to speak grammatically correct English can be said to know English grammar. All of them need not have learnt it from a grammar book such as Wren and Martin. Most of them, particularly nowadays learn grammatically correct English, by that stretch English grammar, just by observing /reading/listening grammatically correct English. …. \< All such people can be said to have learnt English directly from lakshyas, not with the help of a lakshaNa book. \> Can this argument be extended to language of Darshana-Shaastra as above ? Does it mean that there is only one standard English Usage ? That expectation is far from True ! Here is the current understanding of what is ‘Standard English’ -
Standard English (SE) refers to whatever form of the English language is accepted as a national norm in any English-speaking country. It encompasses grammar, vocabulary and spelling. In the British Isles, particularly in England and Wales, it is often associated with: the "Received Pronunciation" accent (there are several variants of the accent) and UKSE (United Kingdom Standard English), which refers to grammar and vocabulary. In Scotland the standard is Scottish Standard English. In the United States it is generally associated with (though controversially) the General American accent and in Australia with General Australian. Unlike the case of other standard languages, however, no official or central regulating body defines Standard English.( <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_English> ) What counts as Standard English will depend on both the locality and the particular varieties with which Standard English is being contrasted. A form considered standard in one region may be non-standard in another, and a form that is standard by contrast with one variety (for example the language of inner-city African Americans) may be considered non-standard by contrast with the usage of middle-class professionals. No matter how it is interpreted, however, Standard English in this sense should not be regarded as being necessarily correct or unexceptionable, since it will include many kinds of language that could be faulted on various grounds, like the language of corporate memos and television advertisements or the conversations of middle-class high-school pupils. Thus, while the term can serve a useful descriptive purpose providing the context makes its meaning clear, it should not be construed as conferring any absolute positive evaluation.





2b-3)** Nagaraj Paturi**: On \< To take the help of a computer in creating a lakshaNa of the language, afresh, directly from lakshyas is not a bad idea. In fact that can be done for all the languages, why only for Sanskrit. \> For this, one has to begin with the acknowledgement of the difference between ‘Human and Machine Modes of working with the Language for Processing, Articulation, Comprehension, Storage and Recall, Filtering the good and bad usage (प्रक्रिया , उच्चारण, शब्द-ग्रहण, स्मृति, धारणा, शुद्धाशुद्ध विवेक ). The next step is to have these defined for the ‘Sanskrit’; and then write a code. 



In the present phase and state of Technology covered under to AI, IS, Speech Systems, Computational Linguistics et al the ground reality is different. The research is ongoing work, where English is used as a ‘Standard by default (? - (मान-दण्डः) to assess ‘all other languages of the world, including Sanskrit .



In the present phase and state of Human Languages used in Society, including English, used widely in web –programming the ground reality is different. The technology to design a Digital web page in all human languages ( despite the character display and hypes of on line translation and transliteration) is a work in progress. Sanskrit grammar rules are being ‘ digested’ in to ‘ Anglo-phobic Programming languages’ , which work is being eagerly facilitated by Sanskrit Native speakers. 



In the present phase and state of linguistics of Sanskrit gloriously bordered with the statement –‘ Sanskrit is best suited language for computers ( circa 80’s – NASA Scientist) the ground reality is different. There is a lot more work needed to understand the ‘ Design of Paninian rule base’, which is a bridge-book, placed around 700 BCE, which facilitates the understanding of Samskrutham language usage
around 3100 to 10,000 BCE ( a range of time between Mahabharata and Vedas) and STANDARDIZES the Sanskrit Language usage in post period of 700 BCE till say 20^(th) century.





2b-4)** Nagaraj Paturi**: You have already noted \< in the case of each rich language, it is going to be a very big project, that can keep many people all over the world busy … Some may look at this exercise as reinventing the wheel. Some may predict that we may just be validating Panini and other laakshaNikas at the end of the whole laborious exercise. But it does not hurt to collect all the facts /observations that have been generalized as various disciplines such as physics and create the disciplines all over again, afresh, right from the scratch. Who knows? There could be many useful and pleasant surprises from and through the process. >. Now, which Nation – Corporate –Language user community – Religion group should work and invest in this ‘ big project’ – Why? How will the 15 hour program provide a ‘ Sampler Taste’ of the ‘ rich language and its complexity’? to give a level playing opportunity by the side of ‘English’ ? 





2c) **G S S Murthy** : On \< I believe the database will cover the vocabulary that is adequate enough for most purposes. … 2. Using techniques of data-analytics and data mining, arrive at rules that can be discerned through the usage. The rules arrived at would not be based on Paninian structure. It could be entirely different. I believe such an approach is feasible although it may be a large and major project running over several years. \> 

Great suggestion ! Here are three challenges. What are we trying to do in this ‘ Big-Data –Analytics’?



\<Validate Panini ? – It would be possible if ‘ our current knowledge of Panini is sufficient and accurate’ ! I am sure that many wont even make a ‘ pass mark’ on this point. 



\<Discover, probably a new set of rules to explain Old and Existing Vocabulary> - Well, the effort starts with the Lexicons and Koshas, Niruktas , which again make a pre-requisite of \< Panini –Excellence>.



\< Give a 21 st century new twist to Sanskrit with a version- upgrade like a software patch ? > To borrow your words, Murhty ji, I am almost a skeptic and say \< I don't know. The project may come up with a simpler form of grammar and many may be attracted to Sanskrit. Sanskrit may become a dynamic, living language" \>. Let me keep this as a wish-list that a new-Panini and PAtanjali would emerge through the I- Roto-Machine revolutions! for a \< future time>! . 



To draw from the post of Nagaraj Paturi \< just as my book is meant for the standardization of the language of that daily, Suri was also standardizing the standard variety of his times>.



2d-1 ) **Shrinivasa Varakhedi** : On \< In fact all our Shastras are descriptive only. They teach us the 'Niyama's (natural rules)…. .. Thus, Panini is not at all giving any prescription how to pronounce, rather giving an explanation how our vocal chard behaves in such contexts. … Even in the case of Dharma Shastra, which is believed to be a strictly prescriptive in nature by ruling injunctions and prohibitions, this view holds good. ... It is very well said in philosophical texts by the term - ishta-saadhanataa (being cause for desired result).

The descriptions are told in the vidhi form to make the people understand in an easy way to follow - what to do and what not to do. This does not mean that they are just Do's and Dont's ; They are descriptions. \>



2d-2 ) On \< **Shrinivasa Varakhedi / ****Nagaraj Paturi** : This descriptive - prescriptive classification itself is a problematic one.
The sUtras of AA are all descriptive only, none of them prescriptive in their syntax/structure/mood. But its users used it as an **anus'aasanam **with **rakshOhAgamalaghvasandEhAh as prayOjanam**.
The definition "**vyAkriyantE anEna s'abdAh iti vyAkaraNam**" gives a descriptive view of it.



Can we say : **(**(शास्त्राध्ययनफलं दर्शनम् ; शास्त्रम् नाम
दर्शन -व्याख्यानं , दर्शन-व्याकरणं , विधि -नियम –निषेध विशेष बोधकः,
विनियोगार्थं अनुशासनम्, इष्टकामार्थ सिद्धये ; )** )
**

**(**(व्याख्यानतो शास्त्रज्ञानम् , तपसा दर्शनम् ; शास्त्रेण नियमः क्रियते, भाषा शास्त्रेण भाषा-नियमः क्रियते ; )** )**

****

 (All) Shaastra’s are deeply and integrally connected with ‘ Visioning (Revelation, a transcendental process that forms the base and basic of language). Darshana gets expressly articulated as Shaastra. The teaching of Shaastra is to facilitate the ‘ (Shuddha –Sampoorna -SphuTa) Darshana’ as an experience (Anubhava). The convenience of prescriptive and descriptive is an artifact of teaching in a context.

**\* EXTRACT FROM ORIGINAL MULTIPLE POSTS**



** Amba Kulkarni** : Usage of Sanskrit in well-known works of Sanskrit be analyzed so that we could arrive at a vocabulary and a set of rules of grammar that will suffice for all practical purposes. ... Equips a learner (within 15 hrs of intense study) to read and understand Sanskrit books.



** Nagaraj Paturi**: Your suggestion is not so unorthodox. .. In fact, it is well accepted and well established idea of Sanskrit (and as an influence of that) idea of Indian tradition that lakshaNa is not necessarily what is found in the book of lakshaNa, it is the set of rules running through a corpus of lakshyas of a system, say, a language.



It is also a traditional idea that there are two ways of knowing /learning lakshaNa: 1. through one's own observation of the lakshyas 2. through a lakshaNa book. It is such a traditional idea that such a staunch custodian of tradition as his holiness Jagadguru S'ankaracharya Sri Sri Sri Bharati Tirtha swami himself in one of the videos recently shared on BVP that there can not be a language that is able to function as a language that does not have grammar irrespective of whether that grammar is written down /formulated in the form of a set of rules or not.



All those who are able to speak grammatically correct English can be said to know English grammar. All of them need not have learnt it from a grammar book such as Wren and Martin. Most of them, particularly nowadays learn grammatically correct English, by that stretch English grammar, just by observing /reading/listening grammatically correct English.



All such people can be said to have learnt English directly from lakshyas, not with the help of a lakshaNa book.



To take the help of a computer in creating a lakshaNa of the language, afresh, directly from lakshyas is not a bad idea. In fact that can be done for all the languages, why only for Sanskrit.



As you have already noted, in the case of each rich language, it is going to be a very big project, that can keep many people all over the world busy.



Some may look at this exercise as reinventing the wheel. Some may predict that we may just be validating Panini and other laakshaNikas at the end of the whole laborious exercise.



But it does not hurt to collect all the facts /observations that have been generalized as various disciplines such as physics and create the disciplines all over again, afresh, right from the scratch. Who knows? There could be many useful and pleasant surprises from and through the process.



** G S S Murthy** : May I express my unorthodox views? Panini built a magnificent artificial structure to explain and expand Sanskrit as he knew. It has stood the test of time and will be there for long.

However, with the technology available through computers and programming, we could look at Sanskrit in a new way.

1. Try to list usages of Sanskrit words in major classics like Ramayana, Mahabharata and Mahakavyas. It would be a gigantic data base. I believe the database will cover the vocabulary that is adequate enough for most purposes.

2. Using techniques of data-analytics and data mining, arrive at rules that can be discerned through the usage.The rules arrived at would not be based on Paninian structure. It could be entirely different.

I believe such an approach is feasible although it may be a large and major project running over several years.

The sceptic may say, "Why waste our efforts when Panini has done it for us?" My answer is " We don't know. The project may come up with a simpler form of grammar and many may be attracted to Sanskrit. Sanskrit may become a dynamic, living language"

Scholars may like to give a thought to the idea.



**Nagaraj Paturi** : How did this word 'prescriptive' enter as an unjustifiably pejorative description of our classical grammars in India? It is the excitement born of the newly introduced discipline linguistics. The new initiates who included highly respectably learned professors of the generation of my teachers, were enjoying their initiation into the new discipline through their repeated satires and fun makings about the 'prescriptive' nature (purely based on their wrong perception of them as prescriptive) of the classical grammars. One such highly learned fine linguist did it so often that I was not able to help reacting.

Once he was at it again during one of his guest lectures in my department. He was addressing the post-graduate students of Telugu and started his gleeful fun makings and satires about Balavyakaranamu of Chinnaya Suri (of 19th century) being prescriptive. ( This book, in fact, like AA, has only descriptive rules for classical Telugu which was the standard dialect of those diglossia days, with a very few prescriptive statements in his own vrittis.)



Incidentally this linguist was the language advisor of a Telugu newspaper and during his tenure in this role he did a commendable work of writing a style manual for that daily. That book has very clear imperative sentences as rules.



That day, I raised my hand and asked him "Sir, can you explain why the rules in this book are imperative sentences?" The gigantic scholar , a great sahridaya as he was , paused for a while in introspection and then said, " Yes, I am able to see your point. Now I am able to see that just as my book is meant for the standardization of the language of that daily, Suri was also standardizing the standard variety of his times."



Never later I heard him making fun of Suri. That was probably also because highly learned scholars of those days were great human beings too.



** Shrinivasa Varakhedi** : The view expressed by Sri Nagaraj Ji is very much right. No part in Vyakarana is prescriptive in nature though the sutras formally look like prescriptive. In fact all our Shastras are descriptive only. They teach us the 'Niyama's (natural rules). For example, the sandhi rules in grammar book are the definition of vocal chard and its behaviour in the context of co-occurence of two syllables. In other words, Panini is explaining the the invariable relationship between the two events - the cause and affect. This is nothing but Vyapti relation between the co-occurence of two syllables and their mix during pronunciation. Thus, Panini is not at all giving any prescription how to pronounce, rather giving an explanation how our vocal chard behaves in such contexts.

Even in the case of Dharma Shastra, which is believed to be a strictly prescriptive in nature by ruling injunctions and prohibitions, this view holds good. All such injunctions are just meant to show the cause and affect relation between the act and its results. It is very well said in philosophical texts by the term - ishta-saadhanataa (being cause for desired result). This is what the meaning of any vidhi (rule) - is the opinion of Nyaya and other non-meemammsaka philosophers.

Hence, all shastric vidhis are to be taken as descriptions. The descriptions are told in the vidhi form to make the people understand in an easy way to follow - what to do and what not to do. This does not mean that they are just Do's and Dont's ; They are descriptions.



** Nagaraj Paturi** : This descriptive - prescriptive classification itself is a problematic one. The sUtras of AA are all descriptive only, none of them prescriptive in their syntax/structure/mood.

But its users used it as an **anus'aasanam **with **rakshOhAgamalaghvasandEhAh as prayOjanam**. The definition "**vyAkriyantE anEna s'abdAh iti vyAkaraNam**" gives a descriptive view of it.

Since both are from Bhagavaan Patanjali only it may be seen that AA has been viewed as both a descriptive book and anus'aasanam simultaneously in the same tradition.

Is it a contradiction?

No.



Because many good descriptions have been taken prescriptively and many books (such as Dharmas'Astra books) which are being talked about as prescriptive books (vidhi books), when you take a closer look at the sentence structure/mood are turn out to be descriptive only.

This is true with many modern western books not limited to the fields of grammar and the like.

One good example that comes to my mind is the theory of bureaucracy of Max Weber. What he did was only description of bureaucracy as one of the social organizations only. But it so turned out that as long as Classical Bureaucracy was prevalent in business management and public administration, his description was used as almost a prescription.

That is how it happens.

When this nature of things is not realized, some books, particularly ancient books, particularly grammars are blamed for being prescriptive (quite often without any evidence in their expression) and modern books are claimed to be descriptive and it is taught to students that writing grammars descriptively is the right approach found in modern books which is not found in ancient books.
