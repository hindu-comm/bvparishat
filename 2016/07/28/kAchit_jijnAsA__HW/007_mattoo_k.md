Yes it is true that none of our shastras are prescriptive. They are narrative in post modern terminology but now and then when natural course of action is diverted or distorted then it becomes prescriptive.

The good examples we find in dharma sastras (which is applicable in all respects) where the gap between ‘is’ and ‘ought’ Is taken care of. What we naturally do is ‘is’ when we go against that it is prescribed like ‘one should act in that manner’.

Since we are human beings the gap remains between ‘is’and ‘ought’. It will be there. In Kantian structure only divine being is free from this conflict. We human beings suffer from this dilemma of ‘is’and ‘ought’which is very much natural to us. If anybody can overcome this dilemma forever then for him there will be no ‘prescription’. For him everything wil be part of his nature. He cant be prescribed for anything.

But the big question is where is such person? Nowhere!

So, for us, human beings, shastras are prescriptive. By nature we are ditched with this dilemma. Shastras are there to show us the path. It functions in both ways -descriptive and prescriptive.
