Dear Nagrajji,

I speak Oriya. Languages like Oriya allow high flexibility in the formation of words

and so there is yet to have a prescriptive grammar. There are broad indicators of space

and time which are descriptive possibly from very early days. Such considerations lead

to the use of vowels in communication. While Sanskrit has a signature of its own due

to Panini, Oriya is flooded with dialects, where each dialect may appear as a separate

language  Sanskrta Bharati lately is attempting a variation of Sanskrit, which wishes

to be flexible but loses the style of the language. Oriya does not have a standard style

and hence flexibility adds color to the language. Similar could be true in other Indian

languages like Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati etc.
