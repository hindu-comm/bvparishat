How did this word 'prescriptive' enter as an unjustifiably pejorative description of our classical grammars in India?

  

It is the excitement born of the newly introduced discipline linguistics. The new initiates who included highly respectably learned professors of the generation of my teachers, were enjoying their initiation into the new discipline through their repeated satires and fun makings about the 'prescriptive' nature (purely based on their wrong perception of them as prescriptive) of the classical grammars. One such highly learned fine linguist did it so often that I was not able to help reacting.

  

Once he was at it again during one of his guest lectures in my department. He was addressing the post-graduate students of Telugu and started his gleeful fun makings and satires about Balavyakaranamu of Chinnaya Suri (of 19th century) being prescriptive. ( This book, in fact, like AA, has only descriptive rules for classical Telugu which was the standard dialect of those diglossia days,with a very few prescriptive statements in his own vrittis.)

  

Incidentally this linguist was the language advisor of a Telugu newspaper and during his tenure in this rolehe did a commendable work of writing a style manual for that daily. That book has very clear imperative sentences as rules.

  

That day, Iraised my handand asked him "Sir, can you explain why the rules in this book are imperative sentences?" The gigantic scholar , a great sahridaya as he was , paused for a while in introspection and then said, " Yes, I am able to see your point. Now I am able to see that just as my book is meant for the standardization of the language of that daily, Suri was also standardizing the standard variety of his times."

  

Never later I heard him making fun of Suri. That was probably also because highly learned scholars of those days were greathuman beingstoo.
