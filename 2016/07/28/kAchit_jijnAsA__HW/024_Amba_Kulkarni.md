I would like to mention here that Prof. Tirumala Kulakarni from Purnaprajna Vidyapeetham Bangalore has been using various online tools for analysing Sanskrit texts, and has come up with a book  

# [सरल कठिन संस्कृतम्](http://sksedu.net/)

that equips a learner (within 15 hrs of intense study) to read and understand Sanskrit books.  

More on this at http://<http://sksedu.net/?page_id=2>

  

With regards,

Amba Kulkarni
