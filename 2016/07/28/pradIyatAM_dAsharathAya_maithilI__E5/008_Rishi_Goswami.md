I recently came across this Karika/shkoka reference in Balamanorama of Namadhatu Prakarana, and googled it for the entire shloka and stumbled upon this.

Thankyou so much Korada Mahodaya for taking the time and effort to write this much summarized information which I'm not sure I'd able to get even by completing Kaumudi, would have to go through so many of the various works of Vaiyakarana Acharyas you've mentioned.
