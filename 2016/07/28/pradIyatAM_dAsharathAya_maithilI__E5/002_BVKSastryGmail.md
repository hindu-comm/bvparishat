Namaste



A very valuable note by Professor Korada ! Professor Korada may explain the last line in little greater detail beyond the cryptic statement
‘श्वशुर - is the name of someone’. On a similar note, can ‘दशरथिः’ – with a hrasva a-kaara, (dasha-rathi) be the name of someone, in this particular case for Sri Rama ? The ‘ samjna’ approach can take the sting of ‘ apa-shabda’ off !






Three highlight points from the present post, which one may miss in superficial reading ! 



**First note** : - you cannot run Panini without मीमांसा । (How many schools of Grammar teaching are connecting Vyakarana as ‘Pada –Shaastra’ to Meemaamsaa as ‘Vakya Shaastra’? )



**Second note**: How to undertake the ‘research and analytical discourse dialogue (= Shaastraartha) – Three conditions for selecting the word : ( i ) अभिव्यक्तपदार्था –words which have clarity of meaning
( ii) स्वतन्त्रा = Words which are stand alone ( iii) लोकविश्रुताः = Words which are well known in the world –usage ( and not obscure) .
What prompted Hari to make this part of cryptic observation ?



**Third note**: What is not to be pushed under cover of shaastraartha – Semantic and anthropological overloaded constructions and interpretations of Samskruth words !

The focus and direction of shaastraartha should be on the ‘Word’ (शास्त्रार्थः तेषु कर्तव्यः शब्देषु ) and
NOT on ‘ what it says /what is said about the word ( शास्त्रार्थः
कर्तव्यः न तदुक्तिषु )’. 

What prompted Hari to make this part of cryptic observation ?





Thanks.
