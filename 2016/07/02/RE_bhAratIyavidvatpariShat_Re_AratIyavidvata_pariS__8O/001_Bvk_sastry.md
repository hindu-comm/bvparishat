Namaste Joshi ji  
  
Thanks for a focussed response on \< daivee-vaak::दैवी -वाक् \>. Your post, though cryptic is like a cancer cell that needs an in-depth analysis and examination. And this forces the response to be long, to cover and connect the implications. Please excuse for this.  
  
1. What prompts you to think and argue \< Language is not divine. Devee was adjective to Vaak. Then it was extended to Sanskrit, then to Vedic.>? Here there are serious limitations which do not bring out the intention of original expression in the text and context.  
  
The linguistic construction you are using to analyze the compound word is not so simple and easy : it is not just \<adjectival compounding>.  
  
The word दैवी -is not limited to the translation \< Gods> invoking sixth vibhakti ekavachana. The word देव and the modifier Taddhita pratyaya has a vast array of meanings, explained and used in traditional commentaries. The word ' वाक् is not limited to speech; the vedic word has multivalent meanings and explained in Nirukta. Without taking in to account the big- picture, the constricted colonial translation of the compound word, stripped out from its total \< mantra-Sukta> context and spiritual philosophical vision ( which results in Bhartruharis Sphota and Shabda-Brahma concept, the Goddess Sarasvati concept for worship>, it is unfair academics and bad-applied practice of linguistics. There is a serious issue here of history and social implication.  
  
2. My response is presenting an alternative way of thinking and looking at this expression, in traditional thought continuation: Why should an expression of vedic Sanskrit be understood in the biblical-theological flavored translation and representation by scholars of post-colonial period? To the detriment of standing tradition ? What is the compulsive reason and prejudice to reject traditional view?  
  
I am pointing the contrast, limitation and danger, if this colonial view in the backdrop of a live vedic language tradition is to be pushed without due process and analysis.  
  
The \< daivee-vaak> understanding is going back to the earliest of history periods, way before a cutoff period of Mahabhara marked at 3100 BCE. Have the colonial scholars and writers mentioned by you as Sanskrit language - historians/ anthropologists/ linguists understood the ' Spiritual Sacred Linguistics' ? Which is different from classical greek and latin analysis as language of theological scriptures? How many of the indian writers of post-colonial period explored the challenges of cross translations of source texts from Greek and Latin, Aramaic and Hebrew, to the dialects of these languages, the church meddling in scripture translation and splinters of church since 33 A.D? Is there any reference on Where and How, if any indian scholar did the Sanskrit based Poorva-Paksha on 'Gods Language/s in Abrahamic religions'?!  
  
In short the translation of \< daivee-vaak= Gods Language> is a highly defective, deviant, inaccurate presentation of the vedic thought related to vaak and its ' spiritual nature of transcending human boundaries towards Divine, use of language as a tool for exploring spirituality ( Mantra), language as an expression originating from higher level of consciousness ( veda as Brahma-Vaak).  
  
Thus focussed debate on \< daivee-Vaak> is a serious academic linguistic exercise to audit the errors inherited from colonial period through indian writers endorsing the same ( for what ever contextual compulsions ). Do we have any reference from any indian writer following colonial thought linking \< vaak> with the concept of \< logos> in old testament and pursuing the logical end of it? Please help me with a reference.  
  
It would also be interesting to see how Buddhist and Jain views on ' Gods language' has been meddled with the Biblical Theological flavors of translation?! By and large, both Jains, Buddhists and latest Sikhs (Ek Sat-Naam Omkaar)- still hold the Spiritual Sacred linguistic perceptive, a key thought falling beyond the theological frame of religions in Abrahamic schools. The messed up translation \< gods language> will not bring out the clarity which a traditional Sanskrit scholar gets from technicality of words\< daivee vak - brahma- vaak - veda vaak :: दैवी वाक्- ब्रह्म-वाक्- वेद-वाक् \> .  
  
It is in this backdrop, a comparison of values held in traditional schools for over 5000 years to a new model prevalent since 300 years,which carries several inconsistencies, need a serious debate. What is needed is a fair play first, before a battle-call, and it sure, is an academic civic model behavior. Bashing scholars of tradition is not fair play.  
  
How do we get engaged in this analysis of the issue by fair-play means and objective academic standards, keeping aside the ' God- Theology' issue? In a secular state which keeps ' Dharma' to a lip sympathy and a slogan level' ? For whose benefit? And who provides value-support for this? The ' shell talk of a billion Hindus interest in Sanskrit- vedas' is a bubble with a thin shell, which gets punctured by a media report?!  
  
Please permit me to place some lead questions to contemplate further and seek help;  
  
A) What was the compulsiveness of a society and intelligentsia of that period - the society of pre-3100 BCE to deliberate on nuances of linguistics, the spirituality of language, and need to set a system of six disciplines ( six vedangas) to be discretely applied to use veda different from Kaavya? And why was this ' genie re-bottled'?!  
  
B) within Vedas, for four vedas why several Praatishaakhyas and Shikshas and Niruktas ? Was it because each Rishi had an urge to brand his thought and school (- the gurukul/ gotra concept misrepresented as cow-heard identity guarding guru schools)? Or was population education service market so global to write so many books?  
  
C) why after some three millennia, Panini -Patanjali and Yaska had to say that language of all this ' hocus-pocus , tribal poetry, imported to India' language documents are 'daivee-vaak'? Were they faith-blinded? Theology advocates? Or skilled analysts of language? Or were they seeking a royal favor and position??  
  
D) Why post paninian intelligentsia of India till colonial period , aligned to this view ? And only post colonial wise persons had to decode Sanskrit as one of the branched languages with roots in the story of Tower of Babel and Old Testament?  
  
E) IF , i am putting this as Big IF, Sindhu Sarasvati civilizations memories continued till our time from a pre-Mahabharata period, DId Panini- Patanjali- Yaska in Sanskrit tradition , Linguists of Tolkappiyum traditions and Meluhha linguists of upper North Eastern India - all of these lost sight of a ' daivee vaak' linguistics? And we had to wait to see it till satellite photography, archaeological and metallurgical analysis had to draw our attention to this ' human settlement and trade-artifact evidence realities'?  
  
I am thinking and yet to see some light in \< daivee \> and \< internet based maanushee vaak, now called as English>.
