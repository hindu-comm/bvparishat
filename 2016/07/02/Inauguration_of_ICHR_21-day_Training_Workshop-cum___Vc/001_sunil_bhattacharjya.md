Dear Prof. Danino,  
  

Congrats to ICHR for organizing this training course on Epigraphy on July 4, 2016. This will be good for those in Delhi. I would have liked to be there but being In Bangalore now, it is logistically inconvenient to make it to Delhi, on Monday morning. This is a very welcome step taken by the ICHR, under the leadership of Prof. Sudarshan eao. The 90,000+ inscriptions found in India so far, offer a huge historical treasure and their interpretation is a gigantic task, more so as any wrong interpretation of the inscriptions can ruin the history, particularly in the interpretation of the different eras used in them to indicate the times of the inscriptions and also the eras to indicate the times of the events mentioned in these.  
  

May I suggest that in future, we should not hesitate to invite western scholars like Richard Salomon. Richard is among one of the acknowledged authorities in this field.  
  

May I also suggest that it is time for the Archaeological Survey of India to make a list of inscriptions, which have been numbered (showing their availability at one time during the last three centuriies) but have mysteriously disappeared. One such inscription was the copper-plate inscription of the Chahamana king Sudhanva, the king of Mahismati  
  

Regards,  

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
