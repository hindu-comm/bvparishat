Ajit ji,

It is not related to conference neither recent nor future. It is my personal feeling which makes me feel sorry when I see the misinterpretations, our still over reliance on already well criticized western works on our scriptures, and poor attention by those who should have changed the situation. You know I have more than 250 sanskrit people on my face book friend list, many award winners,from time to time I motivate them to do something to change... but they are happier in, 'you praise me, i praise you and both of us praise some one else..

.hide and seek .. is tendency which I have observed... so .... nothing personal,,, and when it come to country every thing is personal.  

  

Yes for this thread, I do not expect state of inertia from the esteemed members of this group

Occasionally take things lightly ....

Regards

SS
