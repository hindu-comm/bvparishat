Dear BVK,  
  

Yes, the first sentence you cite is inspired by the suggestion of Mr Ajit himself. He alluded to the many Indological writings in the other languages. Perhaps you are confident about the ways things work with traditional scholars. You are welcome to inspire them to involve themselves in tasks that are timely.  
  

Regards  

KSKannan
