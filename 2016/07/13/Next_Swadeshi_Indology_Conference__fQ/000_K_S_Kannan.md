Dear scholar members,

  

Swadeshi Indology conducted its first conference, as you all know, on the 6th, 7th, and 8th of this month at IIT-M, Chennai. The first announcement of the conference was on this very forum - of BVParishat. A good number of participants got the information from this forum. The conference was quite successful. Around 20 papers were presented, and were all **well discussed and debated** in a very academic fashion.

  

The organisers had a basic difficulty : senior traditional Sanskrit scholars needed to be involved, but unfortunately, a good number of them are not confident of their English. Many of them cannot follow the writings of most of the Westerners, leave alone the intentionally complex writings of Prof. Pollock. 

  

Somewhat surprisingly, the response was more from the younger generation - graduates of science and engineering, and the software folk etc. - such of those who nevertheless were fairly **well grounded in Sanskrit**, and could comprehend and confront the convoluted arguments of Pollock & co. And they did a fairly good job - even beyond our own expectation. (We also had a rather **strict** **scrutiny****and** **evaluation** at the outset, where we had to reject several papers.)

  

This answers the complaint that traditional scholars were not involved. Please note that we plan to hold **another conference in the month of January**. The exact dates and venue, as also the actual themes, are being finalised. **Traditional** **scholars** **are most welcome** to come forward and send in their papers. The announcement for the ensuing conference will be made some time within the **next fortnight**. We request scholars to take note and respond.

  

The more important good news is that the papers presented in the July conference are **shortly going to be published** - by December, if not before. This is as against many other conferences wherein they take years to publish, if indeed they do.

  

We had the involvement of and guidance from senior and eminent scholars in our circles such as Prof. V N Jha and Vedavāridhi P Ramanujan (not to mention Sri Rajiv Malhotra, who has become a rallying point for academic defenders of our heritage). We look forward to similar participation by the knowledgeable *vidvān*-s here in the future conferences also.
