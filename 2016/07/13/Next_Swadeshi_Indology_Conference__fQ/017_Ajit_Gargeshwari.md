Sorry what do you mean by this “It may touch some but frankly speaking, for last several months I have observed a hide and seek behaviour for whatever reason..” Prof. Kannan asked for a inputs and some gave their views. If you don’t want to discuss and simply say very little about a conference which was debated here for 2 months I have nothing to say. Who is hiding and from whom?
