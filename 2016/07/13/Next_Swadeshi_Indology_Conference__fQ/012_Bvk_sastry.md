Namaste

  

On \<It appears that **if a small percentage of our pandits devote a small percentage of time** in getting well-quipped in English/ German/ French, much can be sorted out.>

  

This is not a choice on how you make your tea and how much sweetness is preferred personally!

Part time semester scholarship approach will make this battle worser!

Who has the authority to decide what this \< small percentage>? Has to be?? This approach has sadly happened in India, for over a century and else where also. The 'laghusiddhanta kaumudi scholars of Sanskrit' have been the peers to judge articulately in English on what ' patanjali should have said, on Sanskrit linguistic issues', using translations of Bhartruhari on philosophy of Language' and sandwiching it with
yudhisthira meemaamsakas presentation on ' accent usage in Yajna'!? I do not want to bring in names .

  

In short,

  

1\. I do Appreciate the point to bring in ' English language presentation of content in Samskrutham'. This is meeting a social expectation and or obligation.

  

2\. I do Appreciate the point that traditional scholars have to learn 'English' along with Samskrutham' .

This is empowering and training a scholarly generation : a pious wish list with no feet or teeth ; a desire to be fulfilled whenever a ' savior' desires to come amidst us as an Avataar!

  

3\. The fact stands that the current Battle-Field array is highly imbalanced and lacks the combined strength in a Swa-Deshi team ( or videshi team? ), which meets the three critical check-list requirements: (a) knowledge of the poorvapaksha of colonial and oriental schools (b) Training in the traditions of Veda-Vedanga-Shadanga as a Practicing Professor and Professional and (c ) skilled in the historic pedagogic art and science of 'Translation from Samskrutham / vernaculars of India to modern English'.

  

This is the essence of Challenge triggered by the Murthy donors wish-list statement: ' we could not find any scholar of tradition who can convey essence of text in todays language-idiom for global reader. So we had to shop outside !'.

  

While vernacular writing , as much of it is available, still carries a greater depth and diversity of challenge in this area.

  

I do understand ' identifying and articulate naming of the problem' is only the first step of battle to aim the gun. The challenge of effective Ammunition and appropriate use of it is the next step.

  

What plans do we have on board to deliberate ( or is it a closed battle strategy ?) for this forum?

  

And first step i would identify for such a mock-battle exercise is To revisit the book: A Vedic reader for students- "Macdonell, Arthur Anthony, 1854-1930" -

Used widely and world over.
