I am only trying to draw attention of the members to core issues that the conference was dealing with. I thank you and Prof. Kannan for having answered my questions. Prof Kannan has asked for Inputs I hope interested members will correspond with him on or off the list for the next conference to make the conference a grand success. I also hope the next conference will be as inclusive as possible given the constraints and dilemmas the organisers face.



The title is Swadeshi. Keeping the conference open only scholars or enthusiasts who can speak only English on the assumption that traditional scholars don’t know English was my question which was answered. Please also bear in my mind Prof. Pollock and others are not the only problems that Sanskrit researchers face there are one minor aspect of a major and systematic larger issue. Thanks again for reading.
