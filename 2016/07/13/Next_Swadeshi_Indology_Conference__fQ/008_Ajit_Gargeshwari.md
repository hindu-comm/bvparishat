I thank Prof Kanna and Dr. Ganesh for having responded.



It is not the fault of Sanskrit pandits that they are not well-versed in English. It is the fault of our situation that English has become so universal, and that so much has been written (a few lakh pages perhaps, in various journals and books published abroad/here) on so many aspects of our heritage - that undoing the damage, and especially its urgency and immensity, demands a knowledge of English.



A Language is learnt or studied based on need. There was never a need in the past for a traditional scholar whose audience are different to learn English or is there a need now. For a traditional scholar his texts are important not article publications in peer to peer reviewed journals. He has no need to please a modern writer. He has his audience for whom he writes



If only our traditional pandits knew English well - and some of them certainly do - the task at hand would have been easy.



One has to convince a and create a need for a traditional pundit to learn and write in alien language. He may prefer to write in vernaculars than in English. Extremly good books and articles are in French and German.



If Euro-centrism is a problem so is preference and ease with which many modern scholars prefer to write in vernaculars than in good Sanskrit might be one of the problem areas. When traditional pundits have reluctantly accepted vernaculars they surely will and might accept English as a medium of expression. Lets us not forget many great western scholars have Indian scholars as their Gurus on textual part. One cannot so easily ignore the textual depth a traditional scholar has and will have. A Vaiyakarni will have learnt or read only panini for forty years or Alankara Shastra for 40 years should one not take him or her along?
