Dear Learned Members,

I think there is no need for such a long discussion on it. Every one has his or her own way to approach a problem given his or her time place and condition.

Objective has already been made clear and it would be better to start working in the direction in one's own way if one feels some responsibility toward pride of one's own heritage.

Once it becomes apparent who is most effective where,and this comes spontaneously because system adjusts itself after all, coordination will become easier.

It may touch some but frankly speaking, for last several months I have observed a hide and seek behaviour for whatever reason.

I am sorry.

Regards

SS
