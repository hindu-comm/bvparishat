I fully agree with Ajit and Ganesh.

  

As Ganesh has very many times pointed out, most of the Westerners fail miserably when it comes to communicating/expressing themselves in Sanskrit.

  

I can recall an interesting incident. I met Frits Staal once when he was in Bangalore, and incidentally told him about a *vākyārtha*-*sabhā* that was going on in Pūrṇaprajña Vidyāpīṭha. He asked me where it was. I said "If you are curious I can take you there". Then he remarked, laughing at himself, "What do I understand there? I can only discern that every sentence ends with -*tvāt*, that's all!"

  

Anyway, our immediate problem is with confronting views expressed in English, a majority of which raise question marks about our heritage. In these days of rampant Euro-centrism, there is a need to lay truths bare, so that due credit is given to different sources of knowledge, whether Indian/Chinese/Arab. While historians of other nations are generally on the alert, ours have double disadvantage: they have happily played into the hands of these Occidental historians on the one hand, and are utterly ignorant of Sanskrit on the other. And to cap it all, they are adorned with a matchless inferiority complex, or what is the same, simply sold to Western ideologies.I am reminded of Coomaraswamy's words about MK Gandhi that he may perhaps be the only man who cannot be purchased. Truth is a natural casualty in such circumstances.

  

It is inevitable that scholars of different fields, but well-versed in Sanskrit, should put their heads together. If only our traditional pandits knew English well - and some of them certainly do - the task at hand would have been easy.

  

It is surely not the fault of Sanskrit pandits that they are not well-versed in English. It is the fault of our situation that English has become so universal, and that so much has been written (a few lakh pages perhaps, in various journals and books published abroad/here) on so many aspects of our heritage - that undoing the damage, and especially its urgency and immensity, demands a knowledge of English.

  

We lost so many wars because we lacked the ammunition the invaders had. We should not lack now in the equipment of the discourse with the West.

  

The whole problem is due to the immensity of ignorance on the extent and depth of intellectual/academic assault/expliotation we have been subject to in the past two centuries.

  

This does not mean, once again, that there have been no positive contributions by Westerners. There is much we have to be thankful to them for. The time for sifting the two is already delayed, and our younger generations are getting misled on so many issues. It is time to act, and act with a sense of responsibility - with sound academics, and concern for truth.

  

I would be happy to get corrections from the many senior scholars of BVP.
