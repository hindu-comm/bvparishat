I have nothing against you approach. Not all so called modern scholars know English perfectly well and not all traditional scholars are poor in English that was what I wanted to say. One needs to talk and discuss with all scholars and take the good work being done forward. The objective whatever it might be will be achieved if one has traditional depth and modern outlook. Both will learn from each other if all are invited and are together. Weakness in English should not be a parameter weakness on issues that will be discussed in conferences should be the parameter for inviting or not inviting a scholar to a conference. I don’t think the objective of the conference was to arrive at conclusion on the English competency of traditional scholar or textual competency of modern scholars and enthusiasts.
