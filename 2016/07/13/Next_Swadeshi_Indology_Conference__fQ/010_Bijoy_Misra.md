Dear friends,

  

I have reflected a bit on the approach India may take in order to protect the intellectual flavor

of her knowledge base against the pretentious intruders. I also see the bigger problem of

educating our own children where the "teacher" is trained to "save" child from the "shackles"

of Indian traditionalism. These "teachers" are my colleagues and they do not see what

I see. I teach their children how to think about the physical universe and they teach my child

how to think about me. For these teachers I am a bundle of superstitions and myths and

they are determined to "educate" me about who I am.

  

What I come to realize lately is that the "civilization" has been another name of cultural superposition.

India went on the path of exploring the "science" of life and the west thought it better to explore

the "engineering" of life. While India declared that the "greenness" of the leaf is a perception,

the west explored the "mechanism of greenness" in the leaf. India got obsessed with the

exploration of the natural truth while Aristotle declared that the the physical truth mattered.

In the competition of living, survival mattered; truth became physical, truth has to be sensed

than to be deduced. 

  

Every thinking person on the earth is attracted to the path of exploration of truth that India

invented. The positiveness in the world has survived because of these truth-seekers. I visit

a man called Thoreau who lived a few miles from where I live. He is a sample in a long list.

At the same time, there are social engineers who were trained to justify slavery through

Bible, who perpetuate racial divide in the world as we speak. They also developed in India.

The social engineering challenging the equality of man and to take advantage of others

through the facades of religion is against the beauty of the natural truth that India discovered.

  

Lately I learn that the British could succeed in ruling India by fomenting the segregation.

Economic slavery has been a continued labor problem in modern India.
There is no reason

why should a boy in tattered clothes should serve tea to me in a roadside cafe. We become

party to the problem by accepting that tea. He is our son. He could be a genius. I just

celebrated Haldhar Nag, a poet from Sambalpur, Orissa, who was such a boy. The world might

call him "illiterate", I saw life in his poetry. The person had to drop out at class III. He walks

barefoot claiming that he wants to feel the ground all the time!

  

India is the home of human creativity. Indian poets and thinkers wondered about it. Where

does the thought come from, who thinks, who speaks and who writes?
Every poet in the

world knows that thoughts are channeled. Who creates the channel? Why does the channel

get blocked? Who blocks it? India's exploration of these remains unfinished. This is the

task we have to our ancestors. They did postulate the questions, but did not have all the

tools to dive further. It is our duty to walk as far as we can. The search would continue.

  

The social engineers would continue to ridicule us by creating "the trap of words" as

Shankara called it in his days. The trap would develop finer mesh, but the truth cannot be

trapped. We have to declare to the world that the words are only physical as Bhatrhari did.

We have to say that the word is a communication tool, individually it has no meaning.

There would be people who would parse words and we must have the courage to ignore

them.

  

We learn about the universe not to fight with the social engineers but to take the India's

cause further. This is the task we have. We cannot continue to suggest that the "old was

beautiful", but we have explain why it is beautiful This would need communication tool.

To teach the Vedas we need a Valmiki. Valmiki has to know his words, he must know

how to communicate, what to communicate. At the same time, we have to explore the

limitations of the physical world. It has to be a blend of science, philosophy and words.

Let India celebrate her 69th year of Independence!
