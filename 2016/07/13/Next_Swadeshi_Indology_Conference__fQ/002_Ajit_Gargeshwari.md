I agree this statement should not be viewed as generalisation “"The organisers had a basic difficulty : senior traditional Sanskrit scholars needed to be involved, but unfortunately, a good number of them are not confident of their English. Many of them cannot follow the writings of most of the Westerners, leave alone the intentionally complex writings of Prof. Pollock. "
