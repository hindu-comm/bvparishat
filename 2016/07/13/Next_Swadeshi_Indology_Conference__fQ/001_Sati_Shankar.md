On the problem with Traditional Scholars as pointed out by Prof Kannan for future conferences:

  

"The organisers had a basic difficulty : senior traditional Sanskrit scholars needed to be involved, but unfortunately, a good number of them are not confident of their English. Many of them cannot follow the writings of most of the Westerners, leave alone the intentionally complex writings of Prof. Pollock. "

  

We value Traditional Scholars and their Scholarships highly. There is no need to divert their attention to learn Western Ideas, if they find it difficult or inconvenient. If fact need is that Scholars with super specializations, traditional as well as western join hands and collaborate for the cause. Our "Cause" is so big that no 'ego' or any other uncomfortability should come our way.

  

Prof. Kannan and his team may help find collaborators and coordinate.

  

Need of the time is to proceed well prepared.

Best Wishes

Sati Shankar
