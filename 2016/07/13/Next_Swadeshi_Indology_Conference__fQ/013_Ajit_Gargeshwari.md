Well said and articulated This is the most important part. Looks like it back to square one.



This is the essence of Challenge triggered by the Murthy donors wish-list statement: ' we could not find any scholar of tradition who can convey essence of text in todays language-idiom for global reader. So we had to shop outside !'.



While vernacular writing , as much of it is available, still carries a greater depth and diversity of challenge in this area.



I do understand ' identifying and articulate naming of the problem' is only the first step of battle to aim the gun. The challenge of effective Ammunition and appropriate use of it is the next step.



What plans do we have on board to deliberate ( or is it a closed battle strategy ?) for this forum?

Regards

Ajit
