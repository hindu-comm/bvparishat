Respected Scholars I have two simple questions



\(1\) Why does the priest use Darbha grass blades in his hand in a rituals?

Why do rings of Darbha grass are used on fingers in rituals?

In what way Datbhaasana is different from any other Aasana (seat)?



\(2\) My second question --Why new moon day is called Darsha?

We call full moon day PorNimaa or PoorNimaa. But why it is called PoorNamaasee?

Thanks N.R.Joshi
