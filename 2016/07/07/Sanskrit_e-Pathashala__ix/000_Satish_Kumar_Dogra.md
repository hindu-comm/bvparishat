Dear Friends,  

 A few days ago I created and uploaded a computer program on my website for capturing ancient Sanskrit texts and provide simple explanations that would not only help the readers understand these texts but assist them in learning Sanskrit in a simple way. You can see the program by clicking the following link:  
  

[Easy Learn Geeta](http://dogratamil.com/geeta_2/geeta_2.html)  
  

Now one Sanskrit scholar has joined me in filling up the data and we are hoping to capture the entire Srimad Bhagwad Geeta in course of time.  
  

I have prepared this program based on my 5 years of teaching experience of linguistics and my experience in learning multiple languages, including Tamil and Russian. The philosophy behind this program is: give to the learner meaningful phrases and he will extract the grammatical rules with just a little assistance from you. A villager correctly uses the vihbaktis in Tamil (known as vettrumai) without having ever heard the word vibhakti or vettrumai.  
  

Now I am looking for volunteers from among those who are well-versed in Sanskrit. These volunteers can help me build up two facilities for learners of Sanskrit:  
  

1\. They can help me fill up more data about various scriptures with the type of explanations we are giving for Srimad Bhagwad Geeta. Such a person can choose a scripture of his / her choice. The purpose of these databases will be not to give all the subtleties and technicalities of the language (the Internet is full of them ! ), but just to draw the reader in to develop a taste for the language.   
  

2\. These volunteers can also become Resource Persons for a Sanskrit e-Pathashala that I plan to start through my website.  
  

What will be Sanskrit e-Pathashala?  
  

Very simple. There are thousands of people --- students, lovers of Sanskrit etc --- who know some Sanskrit but do not possess enough confidence to be able to use the language as their medium of communication. The e-Pathashala will provide them a text-box where they can raise their doubts about  
  
a) grammar  
b) how to split a big word into its components  
c) meanings of words they are not able to find in the dictionary and  
f) mistakes in their writing.  
  

Once they press the Submit Button, their questions and passages for correction will come to my mail-box and I will send these to the Volunteer-teachers to give their explanations / answers. Based on these explanations and answers, I will also prepare a database that can be used by the readers for reference om future. In course of time this database can become a valuable resource for any new learner.  
  

My request is that those who wish to join my effort may kindly volunteer to become team-members. Of course, the entire work is voluntary and without remuneration.  
  

Interested persons may kindly contact me on my email ID [dogra...@gmail.com]() or my mobile phone 9840093148.  
  

Regards,  

Dogra, Chennai
