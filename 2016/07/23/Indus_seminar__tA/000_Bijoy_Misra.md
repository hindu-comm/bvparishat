Dear friends,

  

While India has been written about by many visitors, rarely India has been

examined by people of Indian descent from a distance. We are making a

small effort in order to understand our habits, conduct and culture objectively,

to analyze as a function of time. The part of the task is objective

self-examination. The first of the eight conferences is tomorrow. I am

attaching the program brochure. 

  

The local researchers are all amateurs with a strong desire to understand.

We will compile all material together and a Conf video would be released.

If any of you wishes to send a scholarly message, I can share it it in the

meeting.

  

Best regards,

  

Bijoy Misra
