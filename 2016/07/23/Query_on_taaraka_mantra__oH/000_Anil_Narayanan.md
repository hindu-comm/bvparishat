Respected scholars,  
Pranams..  
 Achyuta pishasroti, the preceptor of Melputtur Narayana bhattatiri, has composed a verse in which he prays that - Let Lord Parameswara Himself advise him "taaraka mantra" at the time of death - actually what this taaraka mantra means? whether it is omkaara or it is Rama naama? Sometimes "taaraka mantra" has been interpreted as Rama naama and sometimes as pranava..Which is correct? Are there many references and interpretations for "taaraka mantra" in ancient literature? Please guide..  
with pranams  
Anil.
