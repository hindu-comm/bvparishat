tar = to cross over

  

taaraka = that which makes /helps to cross over

  

taaraka mantra = a mantra that makes /helps to cross over

  

This is the etymological meaning.

  

The connotative meaning hereis that which makes /helps to get moksha.

  

It is true that both Rama mantra and Pranava are given this name.

  

In the present case, what the author meant i. can either be deduced from the other parts of this work, or his other works or his bio. ii. The reader/ reciter may take his own favourite meaning.

  

S'aastras may not help you to determine which of the two is the 'right' taaraka mantra.
