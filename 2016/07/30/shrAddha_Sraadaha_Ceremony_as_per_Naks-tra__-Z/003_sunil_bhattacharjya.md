Dear Scholars,  
  
The Veda says that the Moon is the maker of the month and the Lunar month has the Vedic snction. However, this is not to say that Solar month does not have vedic sanction. The Lunar Purnimanta months ends at specific nakshatras and thus the lunar months are named after the nakshatra in which the Purnima occurs, and that is why the tithis and the nakshatras coincide. There are some occasional exceptions when the Purnima may occur in the adjacent nakshatra and a chart is given in the Suryasiddhanta to show that variation. That is the reason why at times the tithis may not coincide with the nakshatra. To my understanding, one can broadly say that death anniversary can be observed according to Nakshatras with some exceptions and alternatively It can also be said that the death anniversaey can be observed according to the tithi without any exceptions.  
  

Regards,
