Let me start with a personal note (which is necessary). I am not a Namputiri Brahmin. I am a Palghat (Palakkad) Iyer. But as to Sri Iyengar's query "a) Is the above information reliable?", I can say 'yes, it is reliable'. Two weeks ago I was talking to Sri Naras Ravi Namputiri, who is an orthodox brahmin ( and a performer of श्रौतयाग s, a
Rgvedin). He told that up to आब्दिकश्राद्ध ( षोडशश्राद्ध s, i.e. ऊन and मासिकश्राद्ध s) they reckon the day of Sraaddha by solar calendar with the tithi. But from प्रत्याब्दिकश्राद्ध onward they observe Sraaddha on the नक्षत्र day (in the solar month).

I am not sure, but I remember to have been told by my Telugu friends that they also reckon the Sraaddha day based on चान्द्रनक्षत्र.

  

I have another related issue to be raised. From whence the custom of performing Sraaddha on the day of death of the deceased started? We can see the origin of the concept of Sraaddha in the पिण्डपितृयज्ञ of चातुर्मास्ययाग. We get numerous references and instructions and even practical manuals for the conduct of different Sraaddhas like अष्टका, मासिश्राद्ध, सपिण्डीकरणश्राद्ध etc. in the Dharmasutras, Grhyasutras and Smrtis. But nowhere do we get a reference to the Sraaddha on the day of death of the deceased. Scholars might have thought over this. I would like to know.
