Dear Scholars,

Till recently I was under the impression that श्राद्ध (s'hraadha) ceremony all over India is observed according to तिथि (tithi). But recently I came across in the book History of the Tamils by PT Srinivasa Iyengar that Nambudiri Brahmans observe this as perनक्षत्रand not पक्ष-तिथि. As reference he cites the paper *The Brahmins of Malabar* (journal Royal Asiatic Society vol.42,3. 1910)by K Ramavarma Raja.
Generally the above author is considered reliable about his data. However I am interested to know from knowledgeable scholars

a\) Is the above information reliable?

b\) is such practice prevalent elsewhere in the country?

c\) how theश्राद्धनक्षत्रdate is reckoned?

d\) Any further information about this practice in Kerala

I am aware of the सौर (solar) and चान्द्र (lunar) calendars. In our families (Tamil-Brahmin) birthday is observed in the सौरमान calendar according to नक्षत्र only. But when the sameनक्षत्रappears twice in a given solar month the second is prescribed as the correct one. Forश्राद्ध there is no such ambiguity due toपक्ष & तिथि.

Regards  

  

RN Iyengar
