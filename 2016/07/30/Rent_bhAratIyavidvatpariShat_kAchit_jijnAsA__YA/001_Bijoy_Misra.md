Dear Dr Bhat,

I am a novice on this. I would like to know the language substratum

in the subcontinent around the time of Indus civilization. I have reason

to believe that oral languages existed before the composition form for

the Vedas was created. We would be studying the problem for the

next several months. I will report our findings.

Best regards,

BM
