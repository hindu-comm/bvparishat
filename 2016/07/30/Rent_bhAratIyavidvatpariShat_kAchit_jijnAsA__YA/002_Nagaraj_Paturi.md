Whether Prakrit is considered to be the original and Sanskrit its refinement or Sanskrit is considered to be original and Prakrit its apabhrams'a form , or a two way relation between the two is accepted, the dialect-standard form relation between Prakrit and Sanskrit does not get disturbed by that.

  

This two way view towards dialect-standard form is found in the understanding of many languages all over the world.

  

We have the topmost scholars in the sociolinguistic study of Sanskrit-Prakrit complex, Prof. Madhav Deshpande , Prof. Ashok Aklujkaron the list.

  

Prof. Deshpande shared some of his papers in some older threads on BVP.

  

Since you said you want to study, I wanted to share this information.
