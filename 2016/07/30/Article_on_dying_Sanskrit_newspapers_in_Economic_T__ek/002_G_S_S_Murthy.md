For a Sanskrit periodical to attract Sanskrit lovers, certain minimum conditions have to be ensured by publishers.

1\. Printing errors should be avoided. Care in proof reading is required.

2\. As many of the readers believe that they can learn Sanskrit through the periodical, grammar mistakes should be avoided.

There is a Sanskrit periodical where same news and same articles are re-published in different issues. How can such periodicals attract Sanskrit lovers?

I subscribe to two Sanskrit periodicals.

Regards,

Murthy
