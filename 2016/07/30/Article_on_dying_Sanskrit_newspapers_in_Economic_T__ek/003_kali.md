HariH OM!

  

Sarvebhyo Namaskāraḥ,

  

In my honest opinion, the financialcrunch faced by many of the Sanskrit Newspapers and periodicals can be managed to some extent by these small measures:

  

1. Voluntary donations

  

2. Subscribing to them

  

3. Continue yearly/monthly subscriptions without fail.

  

4. Encouraging more Sanskrit lovers / friends / relatives to subscribe to them.

  

5. Advertising personallyin their daily/ monthly/ annualissues.

  

6. Contributing samskritam related articles / reviews

  

Dhanyavādaḥ
