Absolutely any news paper in whatever language its published in survives on readership which gives revenues. Unless a language becomes popular and stand on its own how long can charities sustain such news papers or periodicals. The long term solution is in encouraging readers and writers to write in Sanskrit. If no one writes anything worthwhile in
Sanskrit keeping in mind the readers taste such news papers and periodicals are bound to perish. We are in market driven economy whether one likes it or not.
