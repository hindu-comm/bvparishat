mAnyavar,

  

After having fine information on *paramArthika* and *laukika*, the next clarification needed is

:

**(a) what is *jnAn*(\~ knowledge if this word fits to represent it)**

**(b) what are means of *receiving* it, (\~ways of knowing it )**

**as per our Indian tradition**  

  

This forms part of my last query to complete.

As usual, I will be oblised for your helps, clarifications and pointing of further references.

Regards

Sati Shankar
