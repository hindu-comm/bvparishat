According to भगवद्गीता ---

अध्यात्मज्ञाननित्यत्वं तत्त्वज्ञानार्थदर्शनम्।

एतज्ज्ञानमिति प्रोक्तमज्ञानं यदतोन्यथा।।13.12।।

तद्विद्धि प्रणिपातेन परिप्रश्नेन सेवया।

उपदेक्ष्यन्ति ते ज्ञानं ज्ञानिनस्तत्त्वदर्शिनः।।4.34।

\> This forms part of my last query to complete.

Both answers are given in Bhagavadgita from the beginning and Nivedita had cited the first verse from the early stages of your querry of on Profane and Escoteric literature casually. This derines both ज्ञान and अज्ञान. Other than ज्ञान is अज्ञान.

Lexicon makes a difference between ज्ञान and विज्ञान ---

“मोक्षे धीर्ज्ञानमन्यत्र*विज्ञानं शिल्पशास्त्रयोः*।” इत्यमरः । १ । ५ । ६ ॥

Already quoted by Prof. Korada at a stage in the earlier discussion.
