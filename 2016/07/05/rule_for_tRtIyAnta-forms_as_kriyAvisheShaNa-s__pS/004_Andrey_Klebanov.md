Dear Prof. Korada Subrahmanyam,

  

thank you very much for your most extensive answer.

I have indeed completely forgotten about this discussion and your most logically arranged exposition of it has made it very clear to me.

  

Indeed, the case of "anvayamukhena \[...\] vyākhyāyate" is, perhaps, rather similar to such example in Bhāṣya as "samena, viṣamena dhāvati", where he supplies an additional word "pathā". In the given case one could thus supply "prakareṇa" or, alternatively, following your suggestion separate it from the vyākhyāyana-kriyā and supply the karoti-kriyā.

Vidvān Janardana Hegde has also noted on the parallel tread ( <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bvparishat/YEDPt0yEsuQ> ) that the concerned vārttikam is accepted by Bhaṭṭojī, who adds his own example "sukhena duḥkhena dhāvati". In this case too, one doesn't need to accept the vārttikam, as one can supply smth. like "utsāhena"(?) or smth. of this kind.

  

  

I have also noted that my examples from Bhāṣya "suṣṭhu/ duṣṭhu dhāvati" for a napuṃsaka-dvitīyānta- as kriyāviśeṣaṇa are totally out of place. suṣṭhu/ duṣṭhu , of course, belong to svarādi-, so it's a different case.   

  

with great respect and many thanks,

Andrey
