Respected scholars,

  

I wonder, what is the grammatical justification for the use of तृतीयान्त-forms of words which are NOT avyayībhāva-s (of such types as प्रायण, स्पष्टतया,अन्वयमुखेन(?) etc.) as क्रियाविशेषण-s? (For the avyayībhāva-s the provision is done by 2,4.83 तृतीयासप्तम्योर्बहुलम् )

For the use of adverbs with Neuter Acc. ending there are some nyāya-s mentioned in e.g. Paribhāṣasaṃgraha (as क्रियाविशेषणानां कर्मत्वं नपुंसकलिंगता च) or in the Kāśikā (ad avyayībhāvasūtra 2.4.18 : क्रियाविशेषणानां च कलीबतेष्यते) and, what is perhaps even more important, there are such usages found in the Bhāṣya (e.g. as an example of a sentence consisting of a kriyāpadam + kriyāviśeṣaṇam in samārthasūtra 2,1.1 : सक्रियाविशेषणं चेति वक्रव्यम् । सुष्ठु पचति, दुष्ठु पचति ).

  

thank you very much in advance

Andrey
