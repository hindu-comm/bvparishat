sure, it was on purpose to mark "by means of". This translation comes about if we take *mukham* to mean *upāya-*(attested in Vācaspatyam and many older kośa-s).

I also think it's the simplest way to render it English: by means of *anvaya-*

  

Alternatively, we can take *mukham*as "pradhāna-/ śreṣṭha-". then we could say smth. like "in a way that anvaya- is the pradhānabhāgaḥ" (in simple terms: "on the basis of OR following the anvaya-")

  

what do you think?

  

(thanks a lot for all your suggestions and the citation from the Aaswalaayana Grihya Sootra)
