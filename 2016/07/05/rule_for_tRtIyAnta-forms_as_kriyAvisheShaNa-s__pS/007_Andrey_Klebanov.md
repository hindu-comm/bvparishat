Dear Prof. Paturi,

  

I am sorry for having failed to understand your explanation at the first sight (you must agree that it was rather condensed). I see now that you have just given the gist of Bhāṣyakāra's siddhānta.

  

as for

-- क्रियायाम् अन्वयात् क्रियाविशेषणत्वम् applies to all Kaarakas. --

I can see now that I was using the term in a somewhat loose or even wrong sense (implying the idea of an indeclinable adverb taken from English, or, perhaps, just not understanding the concept properly). I was also quite a bit mislead by both the two nyāya-s mentioned in the Kāśikā and the Paribhāṣasaṃgraha (as I mentioned in my question)

--- in e.g. Paribhāṣasaṃgraha (as क्रियाविशेषणानां कर्मत्वं नपुंसकलिंगता च) or in the Kāśikā (ad avyayībhāvasūtra 2.4.18 : क्रियाविशेषणानां च कलीबतेष्यते) ---  

I see now, that, In fact, Nāgeśa himselg explains Bhāṣyakāra's separate mention of "kriyāviśeṣaṇam" in the Vt. 9 ad samarthasūtra merely as प्रपञ्चार्थम्  

The final line of the same Bhāṣya reads: अपर आह: "आख्यातं सविशेषणम्" इत्येव। सर्वाणि ह्येतानि क्रियाविशेषणानि। (that is what you have said)

  

As for English. I can now better understand what you meant by your first example "with the knife" (that perplexed me at first).

In any case, I think you are right that the adverbially looking construction in Sanskrit (such as those dealt under prakṛtyādibhyaḥ... ) are best rendered *by means of*a prepositional phrase (e.g. I will explain.... **in the way that** anvayaḥ \[will become\] mukham).

What do you think? 

  

thank you very much for your help once again

Andrey Klebanov
