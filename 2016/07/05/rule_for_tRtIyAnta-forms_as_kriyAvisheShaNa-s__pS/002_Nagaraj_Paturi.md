अन्वयमुखेन is a simple and straightforward करणकरकप्रयोग only.

  

अंवयं मुखं कृत्वा इति।

  

\>I wonder, what is the grammatical justification for the use of तृतीयान्त-forms of words which are NOT avyayībhāva-s (of such types as प्रायण, स्पष्टतया,अन्वयमुखेन(?) etc.) as क्रियाविशेषण-s?

  

------- Even in English, prepositional phrases working as adverbs is quite common.

  

How was theapple cut? Theapple was cut WTH A KNIFE.

  

Instrumental prepositional phrase is working as adverb (answer to how ) here.
