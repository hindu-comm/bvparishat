The introduction by the lady sounds like a slightly different version of Tamil. Is she talking in some version of Malayalam that is close to Tamil? Normally I can just barely make out what somewhat says in Malayalam. But I could understand every word spoken by this lady. I am curious to know whether there is some dialect of Malayalam close to Tamil that she might be speaking in.  
  

Regards,
