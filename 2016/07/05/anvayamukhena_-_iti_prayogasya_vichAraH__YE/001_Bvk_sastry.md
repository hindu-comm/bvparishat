Namaste

  

1\.  Mallinatha has clearly stated the rule by which Sanskrit should be studied. The true nature and pedagogy of studying Samskrutham to bring out the meaning of sentences containing ' padam- The technically processed Sanskrit word' are presented here.

  

2\.  To understand this, a little explanation and acquaintance with classical in- house teaching method of Sanskrit literature is needed. This pedagogy of Teaching- Learning Samskruth literature survived all through colonial schooling and post independent Indian High School Sanskrit education in larger high school education at least till 1980's in India( and text books i used for teaching advocated this method). The colonials- and orientals, and Sanskrit learners who advocate English-like system for learning Sanskrit (with extreme dependency on authority of Monier Williams Dictionary) will never get captivate and deliver the essence and essentials of this technicality; nor the Sanskrit enthusiasts hopping on to advanced texts of Sanskrit with their pedagogic analytic tool-box limited to conversational Sanskrit and ' translations' get the criticality of it.

  

3\. What was the necessity for Mallinatha to make a statement on methodology of commenting on literary work and bring back an age old technique of pada-vakya-pramana paddhati to explain Kavya?

  

4\.  In Mallinathan's own words: other methods that were used by earlier commentators to explain Kalidasa's greatness had caused exactly opposite result( dur- vyaakhyaa- visha-moorchitaa). So mallinatha is bringing back the life giving and death-defeating medicine called Sanjeevani- to rejuvenate the Sanskrit literary studies. The same method is applied to a range of literature: creative one from Kalidasa to pedantic labored one ftom Bharavi Magha Sri Harsha. And this is exactly the contextualized 'pada-vakya-pramana' paddhati for Kaavya. A system well established in Shaastras.

  

5\. What is it? Why अन्वय-मुखेन- एव? The stress on एव- ONLY Through this method? And HERE- इह? And in 14th century circa??

Because without understanding the literal string- Vaakya in Kaavya; and its constituent units called ' padam' , the aesthetic idea ( rasa-alamkaara-dhvani) can not be tasted or tested! This is yoga way of studying Samskrutham: the analytics of word- processing and refinement and unification in to a sentence and composition.

  

If the indian commentator says this, this is backward looking! And if the British or American Critic says this, in 19th century and applies it to Shakespeare, it is a new theory Practical Criticism: Text Centric sensitivity building to appreciate great literature.

  

6\. Getting back to the word; Anvaya here refers to the Sanskrit grammars uniqueness of syntactical and semantic construction , technically called कारक-विभक्ति-अन्वय-क्रम.

A full knowledge of Sanskrit grammar alone can empower the critic to do justice; to bring out the essence of literary work and demands on a translator of Sanskrit document. A majority of post colonial and oriental translations and research FAIL this standard and test ofकारक-विभक्ति-अन्वय-क्रम standard, the hall mark of expression present in Samskrutham document .

  

And such failed translations have historical and social implications, resulting in a battle for Sanskrit!

  

7. Why the word मुख? The metaphor describing Sanskrit grammar as the face ( mukham) of Veda is equally applicable to Kaavya also.

  

When face fails to get the essence of vision, the input is seen distorted, said distorted, interpreted with distortion and motives:: eye-ear- mouth-memory failing, the outcome knowledge is far from Truth of the source work. The smriti-bhramsha is the gateway to destruction (pranaasha).

  

The truteeyaa vibhakti- the instrumental nature is a pointer on how the discipline of vedanga vyakarana needs to applied to study Samskrutha Sahitya.

  

And last part: sarvam vyaakhyaayate mayaa: the critic commentator Mallinatha sticks to valid tools and not to personal opinion or projected greatness of a poet by tradition. This is True snd Total objectivity in assessment by a connoisseur- sahrudaya: the essence of Sarasvatee -Tattva.

  

I hope this explains what tradition stands for and what is missing in post colonial Sanskrit study -as a language.
