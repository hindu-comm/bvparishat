Dear Prof. BVK Sastry,

  

I am really very thankful to you for your most useful and most elaborate explanations. These are of great help to me.

I do also share your sentiment about the dramatic effect, which the superimposition of the British methods of teaching had on the traditional learning of śāstra-s, which fortunately was nonetheless able to survive and continues (though less lively) till day.

  

thank you very much,

Andrey
