Respected scholars,  
 In jyotisha, it has been stated that the sins committed by a person in his previous births will affect him in the form of various sufferings in the present life-like "poorvajanmakrtam paapam vyaadhiroopena baadhate". I think this part of verse is from the text phaladeepika. Can we find similar thoughts in any other shastras/sources..please guide..  
 Thanking in advance,  
 Anil Narayanan.N.
