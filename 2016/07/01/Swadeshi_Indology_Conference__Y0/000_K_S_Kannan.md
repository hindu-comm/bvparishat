Dear Members of the Parishat,

  

The much awaited Conference Series that we announced a few months ago - to consider the views of Western Indologists who have been overtly or covertly critical of our heritage - is about to commence. Scheduled for the **6th, 7th, and 8th** of July (this month), the first Conference is being held at IIT-M, Chennai.

  

The Schedule and the Abstracts of the papers to be presented there are attached for your kind perusal.

  

**A Note** : This is a quiet and serious closed-door conference, hence admission to the conference is **only by invitation**(and the invitation has been extended to hardly half a dozen more than the actual participants).

  

We are hopeful of bringing out the Proceedings soon, so you will not miss the essential things.

  

KSKannan

Convener of the

Swadeshi Indology Conference
