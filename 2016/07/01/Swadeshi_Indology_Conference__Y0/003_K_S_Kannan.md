There is a natural curiosity to look into the papers. As it is desired to make the papers more refined - through discussions among the participants themselves first, they are not presented prematurely here, before the august members of BVP.

  

The Proceedings Volume is expected to be out in another 3 or 4 months, till when we solicit your patience.
