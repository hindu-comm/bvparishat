Dear Prof. Kannan,

  

I am indeed happy to see the conference information sharedpublicly.

  

Though my offline correspondence regarding the conference information being or not being sharedwith at least the supporters of the cause preceded this public sharing, I do not want totake credit for this great development of propriety.

  

All those like me who are neither ready nor eager to get invited, I think would definitely feel happy to justknow about the conference.

  

My offline response wasthat of a rural Indian relative who uses his liberties with the marriage organizing relatives to frankly ask them why he was not informed of the muhurtam and venue of the marriage in spite of heparticipating in the early stages of the marriage proposal.

  

If my offline correspondence is one of the 'quarters' thatis behind your expressions in the message below and if that means that you felt uncomfortable with my rustic offline correspondence, I apologise for being responsible for the discomfort of an udaattapurusha like you.

  

Bot how nice it feels to see the information of a good scholarly activity with a mission being shared like this!

  

Though I communicated my best wishes for the conference offline, I want to do it again here on this occasion.

  

warm regards,

  

Nagaraj
