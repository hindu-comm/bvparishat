Dear Sir/Madam

  

We all know, assuming we keep our eyes open, what has gone and how it has gone during the last two centuries.

I myself, stranger at each and every counter as I am, encourage each and every one , whatever his or her field, but always, *tatastha* and
*sthiti prajna.*

*  
*

Even then occasionally I feel the pinch in whom I observe. Some time reactions make me hopeless too.

  

BVP is much effective platform and is itself capable enough to take position against ills and odds.

What is needed is just to focus and coordinate, rest takes care of itself.

  

I look forward to see such creative steps where our efforts, resources, energy and expertise is well coordinate.

Best Wishes

Regards

Sati Shankar
