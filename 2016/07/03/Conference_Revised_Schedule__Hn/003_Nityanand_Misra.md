Dear Prof. Kannan

  

Please accept my congratulations for pulling this conference off in a very short period of time despite the many constraints you would have faced. It is no mean effort to get Sh. Rajiv Malhotra, Dr. P Ramanujan, Prof. V N Jha, Prof. Makarand Paranjape, and Dr. Koenraad Elst on the same stage for three days. The conference is but a first step in a long journey, and I wish you all the best for not just this step but the entire journey.

  

The decision to publish the proceedings is welcome. As more conferences are organized in the series, I hope the scale and participation gets bigger with each conference, with more and more traditional and modern scholars from BVP participating (some are already presenting papers at the first conference). I also hope that future conferences are kept open to general public (with a registration fees if the need be). Drafting of a style guide and publishing the proceedings in scientific style (using TeX/LaTeX) would be some other suggestions for future events.

  

Lastly, I am thankful to you for considering me worthy of chairing the session on use of Ramayana as a political tool. I look forward to meeting you in Chennai.

  

Kind regards, Nityanand
