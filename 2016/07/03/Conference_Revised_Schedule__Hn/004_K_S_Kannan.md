Dear Nityananda Misra,

  

Many thanks for your kind mail.

  

It is indeed our plan to organise more conferences, and also publish the Proceedings regularly. Your suggestion regarding the involvement of more scholars from the traditional as well as modern streams is quite welcome. Equally opportune are your hints in respect of the Style Sheet and publication in a scientific fashion. And yes, we do intend to throw the conferences open to the public in future.

  

As this was the first step, we were content to conduct it on a small scale. In fact, it was planned to keep things all subdued - even the schedule. There was no intention, all the same, to avoid anybody. We indeed want to have a right admixture of young scholars as well as some of the best of senior scholars (esp. those in BVP) in our future endeavours.

  

Your own involvement in the enterprise is of no mean order. And your
kind words of encouragement and positive suggestions enthuse us the more.

  

All we seek to establish is a level playing field. We need to take certain amelioratory measures against the apparent annexation of the arena of native scholarship by Western Indologists. The traditional institutions were machinatingly destroyed over a period of centuries, and hence the voice of the legitimate owners of the heritage, who carried it on for millennia with no little zeal or discipline, has been systematically stymied and scotched, methodically maimed and mutilated.

  

Western Indologists cannot help interpreting things as per their own *samskāra* (as is the case with every one else, after all), and none questions their right to do so. What would conduce to a healthy situation, however, is that the heirs of our heritage maintain no more the unwilling and disconcerted and ineffective silence, but rather turn the gaze in the opposite direction and, too, evaluate them - their very vaunted precepts and practices. Even Protagoras did not deem, or mean, that it is the *Western* Man who is the measure of all things.

  

It is thus in a spirit of doing our humble duty that we intend to conduct these conferences (and not against some, or even to exclude some).

  

Sorry for the prolixity. This mail had to pay heed to certain queries/remarks from some quarters.
