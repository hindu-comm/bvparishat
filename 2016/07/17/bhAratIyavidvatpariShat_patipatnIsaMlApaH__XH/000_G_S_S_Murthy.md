Dear scholars,

It is my pleasure to circulate through this august group my poem in Sanskrit, पतिपत्नीसंलापः, which has been published in the Sanskrit fortnightly from Delhi, संस्कृतसंवादः, July 1st-16th issue. I would have liked to circulate the PDF of the periodical itself, but it is too large for transmission. What I have attached is PDF of just my poem. I request scholars to spare timeto peruse thepoem. Comments and criticisms are most welcome.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
