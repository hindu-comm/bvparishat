Dear Sri GSS Murthy avare,

  

Let me congratulate you for the beautiful poem पतिपत्नीसंलापः and for theadmiration you received from stalwarts like Prof. Ashok Aklujkar and Prof. Madhav Deshpande. Your poem certainly deserves all the praise it is receiving.

  

Such works keep re-establishing the fact of how vibrantly alive Sanskrit is today contrary to the understanding of some.

  

जयंति ते सुकृतिनो रससिद्धाः कवीश्वराः

  

Warm regards,

  

Nagaraj
