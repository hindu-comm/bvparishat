I wished to convey my appreciation to Shri G.S.S. Murthy for writing a modern poem that naturally arises from the Classical tradition and that subtly and softly captures the sequence of life in the sequence of its verses. Like Dr. Surendra Mohan Mishra I felt that the poem was more in the Bhavabhūti-Bilhaṇa line than the line of any other well-known Classical poet (in Bhavabhūti line in terms of content; in Bilhaṇa line in terms of form). However, Dr. Mishra captured this reaction more elegantly and creatively than I could have; he did this with a verse that had the same metre as the object composition and that began the same way as the object composition began — that formed a smooth juncture with Shri Murthy’s admirable creation. However, my congratulations to Dr. Mishra for this achievement were conveyed privately before I could convey my congratulations to Shri Murthy. As I remove any misunderstanding that this ‘anachronism’ on my part may cause, I would like to congratulate Shri Murthy publicly for an attractive and distinctive creation in modern Sanskrit!
