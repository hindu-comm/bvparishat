Namaste

  

**Question**: When Chinese want to study ( Tibetan) Sanskrit? For understanding source writings of Buddhism, where will they turn to ?

  

**Answer**: Chinese students turn not to India but to the West to fulfil their passions for Sanskrit.

  

**Who said this? Why? Explore url:**<http://www.dailyo.in/arts/china-intellectuals-sanskrit-li-wei-ji-xianlin-hangzhou-buddhism-institute-peking-university-beida/story/1/6085.html>

  

**Why is this significant in Sanskrit :Poorva Paksha debate?**: When One more major Asian nation(- or South Asian/ Far Eastern? ) joins the colonial/ oriental team, and learns Sanskrit with all the inaccuracies and theological prejudices that has become a part of writings! The battle dynamics changes.

  

And surely this will have historical and social implications.

  

**What would be the traditional scholars response- for a defense ?** This needs a pro-active work in the ' Battle for Sanskrit ' acquiring a newer dimension, this time by one of the ' indian religions in a neighboring nation'? Buddhist hybrid Sanskrit versus Vedic Paninian Sanskrit?

  

For your contemplation please.
