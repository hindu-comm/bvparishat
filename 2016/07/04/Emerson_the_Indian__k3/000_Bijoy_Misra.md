Dear Scholar Friends,

While lately some people have geared a self-serving attitude of scholarship,

there did exist a man who started the "American Intellectual Freedom"

through the influence of the Vedantic teaching. I am giving a link to his

lecture that was delivered in 1837 at Harvard. Because of his observations

against the Church, Emerson was "blacklisted" for decades in the power circles

of the University. His friend and associate Henry David Thoreau further

championed Indian thoughts and initiated the non-cooperation resistance

against the prevailing slavery of the period. The rest is history.

Here is the article.
