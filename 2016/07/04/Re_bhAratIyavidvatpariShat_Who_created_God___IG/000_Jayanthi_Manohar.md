who created gods?



I have been observing the posts about who created gods.I thought of looking at the basic question of**Who are the gods ? This applies to both Vedic and post Vedic gods.******



Maharshi Yaska in his*Nirukta*which dates back prior to the Second Millennium B.C. starts with the question 'Who are the gods ?'. He gives a detailed note about the appearance of different**gods in the*Veda Mantras*and their alliance with the**God Supreme in Daivata prakarana (7.1 and 4).

Maharshi Yaska has made it very clear by saying, "taking the*Satva*of Parameshvara,the Supreme**Godhead,the gods (cosmic forces) have ‘two births – dvijanma’. They take birth in the Universe as well as in the human beings to perform various functions. They are praisedin different names by*Rishis*- ‘ekam sat vibudhah bahudha vadanti’.



The nature and worship of the*Vedic*deities and their relationship with mortals on earth is a fascinating study.It reveals many psychological insights developedfor getting the knowledge of the Self and the Universal phenomenon. One can findvarioushumanqualities whichhave got the status ofdeities inmanyRigveda*mantras*as Dhatri, Tvashtri, Vishvakarman, Prajapati, Manyu etc.It is very interesting to note that many psychological aspects themselvesare praised as the deitiesforincreasing the abilities of different psychological facultiesinthe*suktas*151 and 164of the 10th*mandala*of Rigveda.

Here Devata of the*Mantra*is Shraddha and Rishika (woman sage) isShraddha Kamayani. Shraddha which means the "commitment'' or"dedication'',is the**goal ofthe Rishi here and she gives her Shraddhaas an "offering'' in the*yajna*.



Yogi Sri Aurobindo summarizes as*"Vedic Rishis*had recognized the different types of powers pulsating around and within all the aspects of manifestation in the Universe.They had realized the conscious supra-physical beings behind all the cosmic powers, the*devas*- the deities (gods).They are seen as all pervasive cosmic energy, the powers of the Supreme Godhead".



It gets more clear to view this aspect with Bhagavadgita.

देवान्भावयतानेनतेदेवाभावयन्तुवः।

परस्परंभावयन्तःश्रेयःपरमवाप्स्यथ॥3\\-11॥Gita.



So, I conclude by saying Gods (positive cosmic powers) are created along with mortals for mutual support. We continue to call them in different names.In this connection, I would like to draw the attention of scholars to a new God created by Japanese;whom they call 'Computer God'.ThisKanda Miyojin temple of'Computer God'is in Tokyo.
