Thank you sri. Deshpande ji, as my friend Suhas mentioned, I have seen that book. Couldn't go through completely. I have seen some of the earlier writings too. What all I have seen, mostly meets the demand of a decent grammar. But could never strike and gold (suvarNam) there :)

I shall have the joy of reading your poems and share my feelings soon.

Regards

Ganesh
