Thank you, Shri Suhas Mahesh. Yes, I was thinking of Satya Vrat Shastri's 2012 book "Sanskrit writings of European scholars /Satya Vrat Shastri". My university library does have a copy of this publication, though I do not have a digital copy to share. Should be available in libraries in India, as it is a relatively recent publication.
