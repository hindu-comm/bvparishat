Thank you Ganesh-ji for sharing the quote from Professor Ingalls' letter to your father. It captures the abilities of most western scholars.
There are stray Sanskrit verses composed by some western Sanskritists, and I remember to have seen a collection of such verses. Will post it if I can find it. But there are some exceptions to this norm, and I would include my Guruji, Professor George Cardona, among the exceptions. Besides being trained at Yale by stalwarts like Paul Thieme, Cardona spent time in India studying intensively with Pade Shastri in Baroda and Pandit Raghunath Sharma near Banaras, and can deliver a lecture in fluent Shastric Sanskrit. Professor Ingalls himself studied for a short time with young S.D. Joshi in Pune in the medium of Sanskrit, before S.D. Joshi went to Harvard to study under Ingalls.
