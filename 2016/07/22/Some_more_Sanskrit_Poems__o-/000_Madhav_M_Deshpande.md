I have attached some more Sanskrit poems of mine. This includes my partial Sanskrit rendering of the famous Hindi poem Madhushala by Harivanshrai Bachchan, and a Marathi poem "Love Song of the Earth".
Some comic verses written during a 1981 conference, and a few stray verses written in Ann Arbor. Some day, l I hope to collect all my Sanskrit poems and publish them as a collection. 

  

Thanks for your appreciation,
