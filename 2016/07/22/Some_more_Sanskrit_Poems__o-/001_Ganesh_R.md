Dear scholar friends,  
  

I profusely thank Prof. Deshpande for sharing his poems that were composed earlier. I also personally thank him for confirming my long held view that the western academic world, perusing the Indic studies, is least bothered about using the language SamskRtaM directly for any creative or critical purpose. This should be a substantial evidence to show that our (most of the Indian Sanskritists, who are traditionally trained in spite of their exposure to the western research methodology) approach to Indian studies and classical languages like Sanskrit is quite different from that of the west.  
  

I have discussed this issue in some detail in my D.Litt thesis too. Here I wish to bring it to your kind notice, a portion of the personal letter of Prof. DHH Ingalls, that was written to my uncle Dr. K S Nagarajan, a Sanskrit poet and researcher.  
  

".........You are a finer Sanskritist than any one we have...... for you use the language as it was intended to be used as an instrument for revealing its beauty to the world such as artist uses his brush; whereas I am more like a mechanic fascinated with it but still fairly clumsy at handling a wonderful machine..."  
  

regards  
  

ganesh
