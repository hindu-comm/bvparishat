I want to lean the difference between ideological, political struggle and good independent research. Popular view may not be the best view. The complexities and the level in which high standard research is done is not meant for public debate put them to vote and decide funding. These conflicts and struggles are mostly created by those who are not within main fold academia. “Black listing” in the context Sanskrit and Indological studies by foreigner don’t make any sense to me. Should it really matter in India if some misinformed westerners want to black list and X Indian scholar. Any way Swapna Das Gupta, Arun Shourie are politicians who have their own ideology. The case of Madhu Kiswar might be different. As you have said this is already a digress
