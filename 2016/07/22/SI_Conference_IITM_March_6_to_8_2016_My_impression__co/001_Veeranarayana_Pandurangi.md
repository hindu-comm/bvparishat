He mentioned something to the effect that all participants should be well-prepared to be 'blacklisted' by certain people (I do not recall the exact words, but the sense was this). This statement speaks volumes about the courage needed to openly challenge those who are ‘too big to be criticized’ (to borrow from the title of a chapter in TBFS) and take a bold stand without caring for academic political equations. Perhaps this is why we saw more participation from people‘outside the system’:

Here I differ. Nobody in Indian Samskrit field is afraid of taking on shelly or any other such guy.

If our well-known Samskrit scholars are not invited individually (with paid trip) to this si, they will not come. You cannot expect them to present a paper just because we call for papers in bvp. It is the fact. You have to accept it. I hope si will act.

And change the translation of motto first.

people who have a day job outside the academia and do not care about the academic Omertà? We saw a change in political narrative of the country with the rise of social media, where people fought the ‘system’ (mainstream media) from outside the ‘system’: today social media is too important for mainstream media to ignore. Will Indology and Indian studies see something similar: time will tell.
