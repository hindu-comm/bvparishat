manyavar,

May I say something, as usual as an indifferent stranger?

There was demand on Western Indology Group to question Prof. Kutumba Sastry ji who supported petition against MCLI in capacity of the President of International Association of Sanskrit Studies, IASS. Since they are members, and petition was against their group leader, it is natural, and for Prof. Kutumba Sastry , being Indian what he did was also natural.

  

Secondly, it is my sincere advice to unite, any type of discrimination, be it Sanskrit/English, Traditional/Modern etc etc will create hindrances., If we go through the western methodologies, we will see they too use terms, Traditional methods, conscience and transcendental, but have different meaning and connotations. And when that literature comes before us we take that easy and as susal and confirm what they said without really knowing what that use of term was really demoting, and hurt our own stand.

  

So it is advisable, let us focus on what best we can contribute, no matter from this or that organization or this or that event. Let us prepare as we have enough printed evidence how we, as Indians, and our tradition have been denounced for centuries. It is time to stand firm and hand over our tradition to our future generations keeping head high. Best expression is always found in mother tongues, and we know how vernacular has been used by us and abused by outsiders.

  

So far as black listing is concerned, they may be valuing it as they themselves discriminate on skin colour, we do not so we should be least bothered, if something is said or written and is worth valuing, there are always takers. And lastly , they also serve who stand and wait.

  

How an organization manages an event like conference involves economics besides academic pride(s) and resources, both financial as well as intellectual are used optimally.

Best Wishes

Sati Shankar
