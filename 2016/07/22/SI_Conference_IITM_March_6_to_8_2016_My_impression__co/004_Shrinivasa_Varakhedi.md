Namaste all,

  

In fact, these kinds of conclusions were expected.

  

I was following the thread on this Swadeshi Indology issue for long. I wished to control myself. The mails from the participants including unbiased scholars like Prof. Jha and Nityananda Mishra, made it clear that the conference was well-orgnised one. Let us congratulate the organisers for successful conduct of the conference, and the participants too. But, why are we discussing about the people who have not taken part in this. The organisers made it clear in the beginning that only papers pre-audited will be allowed for presentation. Well, the scholars who were interested and who were prepared to come, sent their papers and got the gate-pass. Why should we bother about others ? be it traditional or modern. (I don't know what makes the differences in scholars to brand them "traditional" and "non-traditional")

  

Evaluation of the content of a seminar will be done on the basis of its proceedings. Let us wait. The quality matters ; not the persons. Secondly, Yes, participation of 'academia' is again a question of invitation. Without invitation no professional academician can/will go. (Of course, I had expressed my interest to participate as an audience ; but, i was informed orally that it was a closed door meeting and hence.............of course, later i too had another engagement and more over, i too don't find time to take part in all good seminars though i am interested, that too in a seminar where participation is restricted by private invitation)

  

But, say hundred reasons, just by non-participation, we can not conclude that those who have not participated, have some limitations like fear of getting blacklisted etc. As i know, atleast in India, not yet, such situation has arisen. In india who will blacklist us. We are the people who rule Sanskrit/Indology academia. Who cares if someone blocks in west !! Such speculations and also speculations of ignorance, disinterest mood, weakness of language, lack of understanding and so on...need not be the case for debating the success of the conference.

  

All this is just choice of people. The subject chosen by one need not be so important for everyone in the field. People of common interest gather and debate. If someone wants to include many or cultivate the interest among Indian scholars or take their help, has to work in different fashion. All are free to work in their own fashion with different approaches. Let us honour...(other party expects the same)

  

And lastly, many of BVP list members (i know them personally) are not biased. I really understand their concerns and truthfulness in what they are saying. However, i would like to bring it to the notice that comments with a disclaimer note 'no offence please' will also have some amount of impact on the 'other side'.

  

We shall encourage the young, modern minds to work with a respect to the traditional scholarship, which will be our strength. At the same invite scholars who have shown interest (with or without english competency). **Svadeshi Indology in Videshi language sans Svadeshi languages**is not a good idea.

  

No unnecessary division is needed here. One thing i am sure, irrespective of all these, we should keep in our mind that नक्रः स्वस्थानमासाद्य नगेन्द्रमपि कर्षति ....

  

(These are my individual opinions ; do not represent for any institution's or groups)

  

With best regards,

shrinivasa varakhedi
