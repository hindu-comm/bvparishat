Dear list



Apologies that this mail comes a bit late as I was held up with some personal matters. I would like to share my impressions of the Swadeshi Indology Conference convened by Prof. K S Kannan at IIT Madras earlier this month. I will try not to repeat what Prof. V N Jha and Dr. Ramanujan have already shared. In addition, the abstracts have been shared with the list and the proceedings are under publication, so I will also not speak much about the content.



I could not attend the first day of the conference (and so also missed out on meeting with Dr. P Ramanujan), but was there on the second and third days. The conference was very well organized, and Prof. K S Kannan and Shalini Puthiyedam worked day in and day out to make this possible. I had mentioned earlier that this conference would likely be a first step in a long journey, and I must say it was an impressive first step.



While there were papers from veterans like Prof. Kannan, Dr. Koenraad Elst, and Sati Shankar; most of the participants were young researchers not from a traditional Sanskrit training background: many had undergraduate degrees in engineering and were writing something related to Sanskrit or Indology for the first time. This, I would say, was both a strength and a weakness of the conference. Strength because it is indeed fields like engineering and, to an extent, medicine (not even natural sciences like math and physics) where the brightest minds of India are to be found today (no offence to other fields) and it is people from these fields who are perhaps the most likely to lead the response of what Rajiv Malhotra calls the home team. Weakness because the lack of academic experience specific to Indology and formal training in Sanskrit makes them ill-equipped, for the time being, to make the response substantial. Hopefully future conferences will invite more participants from Sanskrit background (this has been mentioned by Prof. Jha already) which will make the papers and presentations stronger and more impactive. It would be happy to see papers co-authored by people from different backgrounds working together.



Presentations ranged from well-prepared (Rajath V's presentation using the LaTeX beamer template) to those quickly put up (Dr. Elst was working on his slides during the conference). Some presentations did not cover the entire range of topics covered in the respective papers. I found the presentation on sacred philology rather extreme (as Dr. Elst pointed out), but most presentations were balanced and unbiased. One point that repeatedly came out in different presentations, something which Prof. Paranjape pointed out, was that the author whose works were being critiqued (no prizes for guessing it was Sheldon Pollock) came out to be an academic par excellence: well-read, articulate, and one who does his home work well and is a formidable force to be reckoned with. The spirit of academic debate was by and large upheld in most of the invited presentations, even when it was pointing out some flaws in Pollock's work which*prima facie*seem to be not inadvertent errors but deliberate misrepresentations (for example, the case of a word being replaced in a quotation by Pollock which ascribed an entirely different interpretation to the quote).



It was a delight to hear Prof. V N Jha, one of India's greatest naiyayika-s, at the conference. There were interesting interactions between the presenters and questioners, the most active of them being Prof. Makarand Paranjape, Rajiv Malhotra, Dr. Koenraad Elst, Prof. K S Kannan, etc.



I would like to highlight something important that Dr. Koenraad Elst said. He mentioned something to the effect that all participants should be well-prepared to be 'blacklisted' by certain people (I do not recall the exact words, but the sense was this). This statement speaks volumes about the courage needed to openly challenge those who are ‘too big to be criticized’ (to borrow from the title of a chapter in TBFS) and take a bold stand without caring for academic political equations. Perhaps this is why we saw more participation from people‘outside the system’: people who have a day job outside the academia and do not care about the academic Omertà? We saw a change in political narrative of the country with the rise of social media, where people fought the ‘system’ (mainstream media) from outside the ‘system’: today social media is too important for mainstream media to ignore. Will Indology and Indian studies see something similar: time will tell.



While we are at time, I would like to offer some comments on time management at the conference. Many sessions overshot the time limit. Question-answer sessions seemed to drag on, and some questioners took much more time than should be taken to ask questions. The chairs (me included) and the emcee were rather too kind to allow this to happen.



No conference is complete without its fair share of happy photographs, and here they are shot from my Nikon D7000. I deliberately omitted a couple of snaps of napping participants :)

I think that is all from me.
