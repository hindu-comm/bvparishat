Dr. Srinivasa Varakhedi's comment “why are we discussing about the people who have not taken part in this” is spot on. My positive comments about those who presented papers at the conference should not be seen as criticism of those who did not participate. There could be multiple reasons (lack of time or interest) due to which they did not. I never intended to start a discussion on or pass any comments on those who were not part of the conference.

  

As far as blacklisting/branding goes, it is likely it happens in our own country’s literature festivals. I am reminded of the events of late 2015 when Vikram Sampath, the key organizer of Bengaluru Literature Festival, made some comments on award wapasi. Several participants withdrew from the event protesting against this and Sampath resigned. In an interview to [The Hindu](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/i-am-a-liberal-centrist-says-vikram-sampath/article7938763.ece), Sampath said “As soon as we call Ravishankar or Rajiv Malhotra, we are branded right wing. We need to grow out of this.” Writing for [Firstpost](http://www.firstpost.com/india/how-the-bangalore-lit-fest-was-thrown-off-the-rails-by-the-chowkidars-of-literature-2537202.html), Vedam Jaishankar wrote (italics mine): “BLF was already in the cross hairs of the liberals for having previously invited right of centre speakers Rajiv Malhotra, Arun Shourie and Swapan Dasgupta to air their views last year. The crowd had been overwhelmingly with Malhotra and Shourie in the heated discussion where they had demolished the arguments of the other side much to the chagrin of the liberals. Of course Malhotra and Shourie are tough targets and *the many Lit Fest gatekeepers in other parts of the country*, which, incidentally also includes a travel writer, *rarely grant them entry*.” The recent legal tussle between [Madhu Kishwar and CSDS](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Madhu-Kishwar-sends-legal-notice-to-CSDS-over-affiliation-for-her-fellowship/articleshow/52110033.cms) can also be seen in this context. I do not want to digress here, but just saying that there is a possibility of blacklisting in India also.
