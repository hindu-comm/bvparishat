Thanks to Dr. Pandurangi Ji and Dr. Ajit Ji.

  

There were scholars of Sanskrit/Tamil/English (P. Ramanujan, V N Jha, M A Venkatakrishnan, Makarand Paranjape) who were invited to chair panels or for talks. Prof. Kannan can probably comment better on this, but I believe all those who presented papers were reimbursed for their travel.

  

I agree that participation needs to increase and the conferences need to be open (advance or on-the-spot registration with a fees can be considered). Hopefully Prof. Kannan will take steps for this.

  

Pollock and his views are certainly not the topmost priority for Sanskrit scholars, but I do not see any harm in critiquing them either. Also, Dr. Elst's statement on blacklisting and my consequent statement on a bold stance are not unfounded. I may point out that just because Prof. V Kutumba Sastry lent his support to the MCLI petition, he faced extreme criticism and there was a [demand](http://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology_list.indology.info/2016-March/042862.html) to “blacklist” him and other similar “wrong people” \[sic\] who should not be “invited” on the Indology list:

  

*“isnt it time for an alphabetical blacklist to be regularly updated in order not to invite the wrong persons financed by public funds”*
