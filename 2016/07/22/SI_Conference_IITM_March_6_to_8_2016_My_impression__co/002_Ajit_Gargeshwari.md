A set of questions. Is Prof. Pollock or his views and researches the top most agenda for serious researches across India? Or are such matters more important in social media and media in general to make an issues or write popular books. Is media equivalent to propaganda these days? Why should one listens to another’s propaganda unless it has a direct impact on the research the individual or the organisation is conducting? One needs take a bold stand without caring for academic political equations How many will take such a stand? Who will be the judge to say X stand is Bold and Y stand is timid or X is right the only view and Y is wrong and anti national. My thoughts for future closed door conferences. Thanks for reading.
