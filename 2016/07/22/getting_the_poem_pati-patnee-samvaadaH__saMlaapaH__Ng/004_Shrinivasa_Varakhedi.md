Again, echoing the scholars opinion in the list on the poem, i express my great joy of reading poems. Very simple and nice.....for long i had a feeling rather a doubt that whether sanskrit can be used for composing "bhAva-geethas" (emotional songs). In fact, i expressed the same with Dr. Janardana Hegde ji. I got the answer. Really great composition....thanks to Dr. Murthy ji....congrats and complements will be less respect for you....profuse gratefulness!

  

with best regards,

shrivarakhedi
