Dear friends,  
  

Sorry for bothering you all. I got to read a few verses from the khanDakaavya of Prof. GSS Murthy. They are really beautiful. Due to my other preoccupations, I could not read it completely. However, I had saved them in my mail box. But, alas! due to some error, unknown, I could not get that mail in spite of my efforts and hence I request you to kindly send me that lovely poem so that let me have the joy of reading such a beautiful creation. Sorry for the inconvenience caused.  
  

regards  
  

ganesh
