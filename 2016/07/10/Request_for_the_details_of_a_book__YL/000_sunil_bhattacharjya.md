Dear scholar friends,  
  

Recently I had been to Bangalore, where I came to know about a book entitled "Ancient India", edited by one Dr. Mahalingam (or was it by Dr. Ramalingam?). I am keen to go through the book. I would request the scholars of the group, kindly to let me know the details of the book, as to its contents and from where the book may be available etc .Kindly also inform me if any soft copy of the book is available.  
  

Thanking you in advance and with regards,  

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
