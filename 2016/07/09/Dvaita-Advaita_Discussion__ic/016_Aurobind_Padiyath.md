Respected Ram,

Yes, SunilJi is right. Nothing should be studied in isolation.
Everything is contributory to the other in some aspect or the other.

Your query "how does the matter-in-itself (not its appearance) arise", there is no problem if matter arises and as long as it has no independent Truth on which it differs from others. Meaning if matter arise and appear there is no problem until you declare that it is independent of Consciousness. विज्ञानव्यतिरेकेण नाऽस्ति किंन्चत्। Nothing exist outside Awareness or Consciousness.

This is where I said the detailed study of our personal experiences of the three states of awareness will help to comprehend the reality of existence.

  

The Idealism of Immanuel Kant comes close but not exactly.

  

Not all of us think if the "l" in me gives rise to awareness or if that is a pulsation in the Universal Consciousness which is then used in the mind intellect(M-I) complex as a reflected consciousness. Because even when the M-I complex remains void in deep sleep the experience of my deep sleep is a positive one which everyone acknowledges, irrespective of a thinker or otherwise.

  

The qualities of matter experienced in waking is different from the matter one experience in dream. Even the time-space (T-S) continuum is not the same. Also the No-experience of the deep sleep. But the unconditioned Awareness of "I " independent of the states is the substratum in which these experiences appear and disappear. For "I"am there all the time, even when time is not experienced.

  

In dream the individual creates his world and enters it to experience. Similarly in waking the Universal Consciousness creates the universe and enters in every molecule of it. (The term enters is poetical). Where there is only one, who or how can enter what? तत्सृष्ट्वा तदेवानुप्राविशत्। Can we say the water created the waves or iceberg and entered it? They are appearing in water as wave and iceberg.

This Universal Consciousness when appear as the creator of the Universe we call Him (It) as Ishwara and the created as Jagat. (DWAITA).The same appearing as two/many. But in essential nature there is only One (ADVAITA).

For a child who refuses water but gets enchanted by an ice cube what enters his stomach is nothing but pure water.

Hope you have understood and this has cleared your doubt.  
Regards,

Aurobind
