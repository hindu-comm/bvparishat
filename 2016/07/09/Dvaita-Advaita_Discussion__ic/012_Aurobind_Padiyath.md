Dear Sir,  
Slight correction :  
When I said "Just as सलिलं फेन बुद्बुदादि आपः एव। And If you can remove the wateryness from them their existence ends. Hence wateryness is their swaroopa. Similarly if one can remove the bodham or awareness or "knowingness" nothing can exist.", I meant that all these will reduce to the swaroopa. Only when there is two one can know the existence of other. When there is only One? केन कं पश्येत् ? Who will see whom  
Regards  
Aurobind
