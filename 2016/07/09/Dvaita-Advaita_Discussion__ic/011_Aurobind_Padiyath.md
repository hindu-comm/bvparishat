Dear Sir,  
I'm not replying to the group as it may be of not in tune with the thread.  
Upadana and nimita are required for a creation only in the waking. For example of dream what are these two? Only the dreamer's bodham. There is no separate Upadana and Nimita there.  
Same way in all three states of existence experienced both the experiencer and the experienced objects called the jeeva and Jagat are nothing but Brahman and the swaroopa of which is nothing but bodham also called Chit. Hence jagatAtma, jagatah Atma, jagatah swaroopa, all are nothing but bodham.  
Just as सलिलं फेन बुद्बुदादि आपः एव। And If you can remove the wateryness from them their existence ends. Hence wateryness is their swaroopa. Similarly if one can remove the bodham or awareness or "knowingness" nothing can exist. Hence bodham or Chit which is experienced as existing is not two but the same.
