Dear Ramji,  
  

Here I would like to draw your attention to the fact that a spiritual stalwart but not undergone conventional training in modern science, Shri Ramakrishna Paramhamsa once said that with the progress of science, one will be able to understand Vedanta in a day and he also said regarding
Dvaita, Visistadvait and Advaita, that all these are right except that they are at different levels. How true Ramakrishna was. Today no scientist will oppose that matter is ultimately no different from energy and ultimately there is universal unity. Probably I don't have to go into further details.  
  

Regards,
