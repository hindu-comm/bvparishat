Respected Ram,  
Your statement "If we assume monism such as Śankarāchārya’s Adavita or idealism, where non-material God/Brahman is the fundamental entity and matter somehow arise from it, then we have problem of Idealism (Section 2.3): how non-experiential matter-in-itself arise from non-material God/Brahman." Is not correct. It is a very clear stand that at all three times the rope never "became" snake, it appeared like a snake. So, similarly Brahman never became anything else at any point of time. All that is, were, and will be only appearances in Brahman. The words used are 'dhyayateeva,lelayateeva'.  
The best way to understand Advaita Vedanta is a deeper study of our personal experiences of waking, Dream, and deep-sleep dealt in detail in his bhAshya of Brhadaranyaka.  
Regards  
Aurobind
