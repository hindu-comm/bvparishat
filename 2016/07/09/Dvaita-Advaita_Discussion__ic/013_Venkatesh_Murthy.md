If Brahman is bothUpadana and Nimitta for Jagat Brahman will be having all the defects in the world. Because we see defects in the world like misery and cruelty. How can these have Brahman as Source? To avoid this we can say Brahman is not Upadana but Vivarta like snake rope. Then defects in world are Illusions only. Another solution by Dvaitis is they say Brahman is not Upadana but Nimitta only. Like a Potter makes a pot but Pot is not same material as Potter.
