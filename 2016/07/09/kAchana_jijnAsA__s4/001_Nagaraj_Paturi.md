In Kaavyaadars'a it is said,

  

इह ***शिष्टानुशिष्टानां*** शिष्टानां अपि सर्वथा वाचां एव प्रसादेन लोकयात्रा प्रवर्तते । । १.३ ।

  

This can not be said about rishis.

  

Hari says in Vakyapadiyam:

  

ऋषीणां दर्शनं यच्च तत्त्वॆ किंचिद्वस्थितम् /

न तॆन व्यवहारॊऽस्ति न तच्छब्दनिबन्धनं // वाक्य\_२।१३९ //

S'ishTaprayogas are to be taken as models. Aarshaprayogas are not to be found fault with though they may not be according to the lakshaNa niyamas formulated based on the s'ishTaprayogas.

S'ishTas are (vaidika)dharmaroopas'aasanabaddhajeevanas. Rishis are super-ordinary persons evolved to haveor born with the extra-ordinary powersof visioning and the like, engaged in tapasall the time.
