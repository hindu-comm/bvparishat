Hare Krishna.

Respected Vidvaj-janas,

In tihs regard, unless one establishes the truth of an existence beyond percievable reality, specifically the existence of soul beyond bodily existence, there won't be much success. The whole idea of Pollock and such scholars is that there is no existence beyond the percievable reality (or at least it is no certainty of such an existence). Thus they must interpret vedic literatures from the physical point of view only leaving behind the whole body of esoteric and unperceptable reality mentioned therein.

For establishing the reality of soul's existence in mainstream sholars, it becomes necessary to co-operately work with scientists and present the whole thing from all perspectives - modern scietific, philosophical, and logical. This is already dealt with in our vedic literatures and one needs to present it from the modern scientific perspective in order to make it digestable to mainstream scholars. In ISKCON for last 40 years devotee scientists and scholars are endeavoring in this field and are successful to quite an extent. I would recommend scholars to read a few books from these scholars and take useful explanations from there.

1\. Rethinking Darwin, Lief A. Jensen (should be read first)

2\. Forbidden Archaeology, Richard Thomson & Michael Cremo

3. Hidden History of Human Race, Richard Thomson & Michael Cremo

4\. The Forbidden Archaeologist, Michael Cremo

5\. The Human Devolution, Michael Cremo

6\. Nature's IQ, Balazs Hornyanszky & Istavan Tasi

  

Besides these, there are many secular books mentioned in References in Rethinking Darwin that you may want to read to get into it.

My point is that we have to go full guns keeping scientific presentation in picture and thus establish Indian Culture's reality. The very point that Srila Prabhupada (founder acharya of ISKCON) emphasized in his preaching in western world was the point of existence of soul and punarjanma (reincarnation) explaining it in different ways and combating all the opposing arguments establishing this fact. It is still seen that once a person is clear with this point all other aspects of vedic culture and faith in vedic literature becomes automatically established. This is how Srila Prabhupada made his movement in the west without any indian followers or followers having indian training. So scholars may take advantage of this methodology. I myself was a staunch athiest and non believer of vedic literatures. I was striving to become a Physicist (theoretical physicist). But after reading a book of Srila Prabhupada I got convinced of the fact of punarjanma and existence of soul and my whole perspective of seeing towards reality changed.

  

I would eagerly like to attend the next meeting on Pollock. I do not know how to do that as I did not get any information of the first meeting. I fear I may miss the second also.

  

I will also upload a seminar of Michael Cremo which may give a good exposure of how to present this point to secular scholars and scientists. He is an archaeologist and regularly presents these points in leading universities like Oxford.

  

Thankyou,

Damodara Das
