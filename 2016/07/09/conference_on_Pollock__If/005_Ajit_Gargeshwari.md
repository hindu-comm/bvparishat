Dear Damodara Dasa ji,



If you have read the message Prof. Jha Four issues were selected for examination in this conference : (1) Pollock on Shastra , (2) His opinion : Sanskrit is dead, (3) His views on the Ramayana and (4) His view : Sanskrit and the Nazi holocaust .



I don’t understand how ISKON views as mentioned by you fit in. Scholars are well read and they know about the books you mentioned Thanks

Hare Krishna.

Respected Vidvaj-janas,

In tihs regard, unless one establishes the truth of an existence beyond percievable reality, specifically the existence of soul beyond bodily existence, there won't be much success. The whole idea of Pollock and such scholars is that there is no existence beyond the percievable reality (or at least it is no certainty of such an existence). Thus they must interpret vedic literatures from the physical point of view only leaving behind the whole body of esoteric and unperceptable reality mentioned therein.

For establishing the reality of soul's existence in mainstream sholars, it becomes necessary to co-operately work with scientists and present the whole thing from all perspectives - modern scietific, philosophical, and logical. This is already dealt with in our vedic literatures and one needs to present it from the modern scientific perspective in order to make it digestable to mainstream scholars. In ISKCON for last 40 years devotee scientists and scholars are endeavoring in this field and are successful to quite an extent. I would recommend scholars to read a few books from these scholars and take useful explanations from there.

1\. Rethinking Darwin, Lief A. Jensen (should be read first)

2\. Forbidden Archaeology, Richard Thomson & Michael Cremo

3. Hidden History of Human Race, Richard Thomson & Michael Cremo

4\. The Forbidden Archaeologist, Michael Cremo

5\. The Human Devolution, Michael Cremo

6\. Nature's IQ, Balazs Hornyanszky & Istavan Tasi



Besides these, there are many secular books mentioned in References in Rethinking Darwin that you may want to read to get into it.

My point is that we have to go full guns keeping scientific presentation in picture and thus establish Indian Culture's reality. The very point that Srila Prabhupada (founder acharya of ISKCON) emphasized in his preaching in western world was the point of existence of soul and punarjanma (reincarnation) explaining it in different ways and combating all the opposing arguments establishing this fact. It is still seen that once a person is clear with this point all other aspects of vedic culture and faith in vedic literature becomes automatically established. This is how Srila Prabhupada made his movement in the west without any indian followers or followers having indian training. So scholars may take advantage of this methodology. I myself was a staunch athiest and non believer of vedic literatures. I was striving to become a Physicist (theoretical physicist). But after reading a book of Srila Prabhupada I got convinced of the fact of punarjanma and existence of soul and my whole perspective of seeing towards reality changed.



I would eagerly like to attend the next meeting on Pollock. I do not know how to do that as I did not get any information of the first meeting. I fear I may miss the second also.



I will also upload a seminar of Michael Cremo which may give a good exposure of how to present this point to secular scholars and scientists. He is an archaeologist and regularly presents these points in leading universities like Oxford.



Thankyou,

Damodara Das

Dear friends,

I attended the conference on Sheldon Pollock at IIT Madras campus. I remained present for all the three days and listened to all the presentations . I can say that the conference was a grand success. Congratulations to Prof. Kannan and his entire Team. The presence of Shri Rajiv Malhotra in all the sessions added value to the deliberations. The conference was an eye-opener for me. I could see that the cause for which Rajivji has been fighting alone for last three decades and more is genuine . All the papers which were presented were the outcome of a very hard work . There approaches were serious and objective and were directed at discovering the Fact. Because of the presence of Rajivji we could know the inner stories clearly. All the presenters came to one conclusion namely, there seems to be some socio-political motive behind the approach of study of Pollock. They pointed out the grounds on which they came to such a conclusion. It was an education for me. I did not know many things, to be frank. The entire exercise was objective without allowing emotion to overpower reason. That impressed me very much.

This was the first serious attempt of this kind and I feel that it is very much successful. Academic papers should be examined academically. It is absolutely necessary to understand mind of Pollock without which one cannot respond meaningfully. I am confident this exercise will certainly help in understanding the purpose of his research on India through Sanskrit.



Four issues were selected for examination in this conference : (1) Pollock on Shastra , (2) His opinion : Sanskrit is dead, (3) His views on the Ramayana and (4) His view : Sanskrit and the Nazi holocaust .



The organizers are planning to make the proceedings of the conference available within a short period of time.



What I found that the participation of the Sanskritists was comparatively less and people with Science background were more in number. The organizers want the scenario to change. So they have decided to have one more conference on Pollock this year where they expect more and more Sanskritists to participate. I too support this. Prof. Kannan will announce the dates and related matters once they come to a final decision. I appeal to all of you to come forward to participate in the second conference on identifying the political Agenda of Sheldon Pollock. The volume of the 1st conference will certainly help you in reading and judging Pollock's mind. Remember, his writings are loaded with western history and concepts and unless you are clear it will not be easy to identify his motives.



I have therefore requested Rajivji to remain present in the second conference also. His presence makes a lot of difference in understanding the Truth. This is what I experienced. Let us be with him so that he should not feel that he is alone. He is fighting for all of us. It is a fact and there is no emotion involved in it.

We should remain grateful to him.



There was also a session on Murthy's Library project and the participants expressed their worries about the impact of such translations motivated by any agenda, if any, on the readers of those translations.



I wanted to share my experience and hence I have taken your precious time. Thanks.
