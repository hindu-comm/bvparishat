Sir,

Your presence and and enormously significant comments and suggestions were jwells.

On this forum, I would like to repeat here, my request toy you, Prof. Kannan and other Sanskritists present there,to invite BVP learned members here.

  

The damage to Sanskrit begins from the very FIRST step Pollock took while entering Sanskrit Knowledge System.

It was assuming away the paramArthika and taking up only laukik which later led to de-sacredization of Sanskrit in his writings and interpretations.

Request is that "WE NEED A COMPEDIUM, FRESH WRITING OR EDITED COMPILATION, BUT NEEDING NO FURTHER REFERENCING PROVING THAT PARAMARTHIKA AND LAUKIKA ARE TWO INSEPARABLE PARTS OF THE SAME idam sarvam.

Once we have such a grantha, Pollock's paradigm will be hit hard at the foundation level.

  

I has asked this question here under thread "sanskrit is deva vANi"

Hope you will give a though in this direction. I am always available to assist on it.

But sooner is better.

Regards

Sati Shanakar
