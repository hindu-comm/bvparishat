Dear friends,

I attended the conference on Sheldon Pollock at IIT Madras campus. I remained present for all the three days and listened to all the presentations . I can say that the conference was a grand success. Congratulations to Prof. Kannan and his entire Team. The presence of Shri Rajiv Malhotra in all the sessions added value to the deliberations. The conference was an eye-opener for me. I could see that the cause for which Rajivji has been fighting alone for last three decades and more is genuine . All the papers which were presented were the outcome of a very hard work . There approaches were serious and objective and were directed at discovering the Fact. Because of the presence of Rajivji we could know the inner stories clearly. All the presenters came to one conclusion namely, there seems to be some socio-political motive behind the approach of study of Pollock. They pointed out the grounds on which they came to such a conclusion. It was an education for me. I did not know many things, to be frank. The entire exercise was objective without allowing emotion to overpower reason. That impressed me very much.

This was the first serious attempt of this kind and I feel that it is very much successful. Academic papers should be examined academically. It is absolutely necessary to understand mind of Pollock without which one cannot respond meaningfully. I am confident this exercise will certainly help in understanding the purpose of his research on India through Sanskrit.

  

Four issues were selected for examination in this conference : (1) Pollock on Shastra , (2) His opinion : Sanskrit is dead, (3) His views on the Ramayana and (4) His view : Sanskrit and the Nazi holocaust .

  

The organizers are planning to make the proceedings of the conference available within a short period of time.

  

What I found that the participation of the Sanskritists was comparatively less and people with Science background were more in number. The organizers want the scenario to change. So they have decided to have one more conference on Pollock this year where they expect more and more Sanskritists to participate. I too support this. Prof. Kannan will announce the dates and related matters once they come to a final decision. I appeal to all of you to come forward to participate in the second conference on identifying the political Agenda of Sheldon Pollock. The volume of the 1st conference will certainly help you in reading and judging Pollock's mind. Remember, his writings are loaded with western history and concepts and unless you are clear it will not be easy to identify his motives.

  

I have therefore requested Rajivji to remain present in the second conference also. His presence makes a lot of difference in understanding the Truth. This is what I experienced. Let us be with him so that he should not feel that he is alone. He is fighting for all of us. It is a fact and there is no emotion involved in it.

We should remain grateful to him.

  

There was also a session on Murthy's Library project and the participants expressed their worries about the impact of such translations motivated by any agenda, if any, on the readers of those translations.

  

I wanted to share my experience and hence I have taken your precious time. Thanks.

  

VNJha
