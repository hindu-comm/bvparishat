Namaste



The nut-point (=Granthi) for debate ( Vaada) and not for compromise ( atha-vaa pakshe -acceptance) are the following.



a) Why **‘SAMSKRUTHAM’- the Language/s of the documents of ‘Vedic /Hindu /Shaastra /Yoga /Dharma tradition’ accommodates by design and practice a ‘ Multivalent Interpretation of the given Text’, as one desires and plans to achieve as a goal** ? ( Vak-Vaikharee –Shabda jharee - Vyakhyaa Chaaturee seen in Shaastra- sabhaa vaada -model) ?



 Yes, it has a specific benefit, like mock war games, to keep validating the fitness of the intellect and intelligent people sensitivity in society. Surely it is not ‘ social tea-time entertainment. ? ? But is there a design in Language itself ?



**b) Is there a fundamental design and discipline for ‘SAMSKRUTHAM’-
the language of these documents and disciplines and usage ? **





 The ‘ design’ of the language is for explanation (Vyaakhyana – aakhyana) of ‘Reality (Satya-Dharma) as visioned (Darshana) and validated (Pramana) through ‘Yoga’.



 The traditional schools ‘ postulate /hold to the position / have a tradition which trusts and implicitly , unquestionably believes
that Paninian Grammar, as Vedanga Vyakarana and part of Shadnaga is a self sustaining Sacred Spiritual Linguistics. And it has the capacity to explain the ‘Veda’ in Five fold manner (Panchasu Adhikaraneshu cf: Taittiriya Upanishad).



 The ‘ Adhi-bhoota and Adhi-praja’ explanation of Vedas, fall outside the scope of ‘Vyakarana –Paanditya’ ; and does not hold any contradiction to ‘Adhyatma and Adhi-Daiva’ models, which are ‘Darshana-Shaastra-Kaaras’ domain. The five perspectives (Vyakhyana in Panchasu Adhi-Karaneshu) seem to have been mixed up in current studies; and prioritizing ‘ Adhyatma’ explained using the lens of ‘ Poorly Translated terminology of SAMSKRUTHAM and mapping them to Philosophies
and Religions frame work of Abrahamic schools’. 



 In this sense, there is a lot more ‘ in-house preparation and work that needs to be done in restoring the ‘Panchasu Adhikaraneshu Vyaakhyana’ of Vedas and Shaastras in their Pure stream. For which ‘Paninian model of Vedanga Vyakarana Paddahti : Cf: Vak-Yoga: Yoga way of studying Samskrutham needs a total restoration and resurrection out of ‘Colonial and Oriental Sanskrit’ skin and chains. This is ‘Yoga-Samskrutham’ way of Studying and practicing Samskrutham.

Do we have a team which is willing to support this for the goal of understanding ‘Gita as a Yoga-Dialogue around 3100 BCE, between Yogi’s, who lived before Buddha and Mahaveer and used in the language called ‘ Bhashaa part of Samskrutham’ to bring out the essence of Yoga in ‘ Chandas –Samskrutham language model of Vedas’? That is understanding the Gita as a text of Yoga using the language of Yoga visioned in Vedas ? Gita as Yogi-Samvaada in Yoga-Samskrutham on Yoga for Atma-Paramatma Darshana? )



 Post this fixation, one can get in to the reasoning why Sri La Prabhupada took an approach, in the previous century to present a
traditional view to a different society and \< interpret vedic literatures from the physical point of view only leaving behind the whole body of esoteric and imperceptible reality mentioned therein.>.



 The traditional model of \< Jnana-Vijnana> is NOT the same as \< Religion-Science> dialogues / Faith Validation in a Test-Tube>.



 The four framed issues deliberated in the Sanskrit: Poorvapaksha –Sheldon Pollock has to progress to the larger and critical framing of the issues, transcending the ‘ individual writings targeting’ to the ‘Systemic errors and implications of distortions in the modelling of the language of Targeted Civilization /Religion /Community’.

This is where the first series of the conference covering (1) Pollock on Shastra , (2) His opinion : Sanskrit is dead, (3) His views on the Ramayana and (4) His view : Sanskrit and the Nazi holocaust  is a positive step and deserves appreciation. 





 It may be good if this exercise is done as an ‘ in-house debate’ and ‘not a public hog-wash’ in the interest of ‘ Hinduism’ and
‘Scholars of Samskrutham’, who are already receiving the beating end of the stick.
