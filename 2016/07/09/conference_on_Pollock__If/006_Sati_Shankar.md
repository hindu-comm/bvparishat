RespectedDear Damodara Dasa ji,

  

Your points are well worth considering, but the way forward seems to be cyclical.

  

With all the basic references you have suggested, three grounds are touched,

  

Creation or Evolotion alternatively, God vs Brahm respectively, you can find some threads here in this group also,

Historicity \~ archaeology/anthropology etc etc and third

Consciousness

  

All the three are or presupposed to be tangential under *historical materialism* wheremetaphysicalismand idealism are assumed away by fundamental preamble as the paradigm.

  

The issue is if we will go the profane way and deal Vedic literature as texts, there will be little contradiction between what we will get and what Pollock and his followers are suggesting. There will be an added problem, you will have to forget all oral tradition and will have to begin history from where text are available in printed or hand written forms.

Are you ready to give upmillenniaold heritage?

  

Under the same scheme, bhakti is being considered as repetition of some specific words by those who are unable to explore deeper so as subsidiary to profanity.

  

Things are not so straight forward, and we have to devise some way, and we are doing it.

So far as science and scriptures are concerned, you will agree that at the highest level all are on the same platform. If senses can not explain at that level, scienc and technology too is deaf and dumb, given present state of knowledge.

  

As Prof. Joshi has informed, forthcoming conferences will be open and information will be given well in advance.

Best Wishes

Sati Shankar
