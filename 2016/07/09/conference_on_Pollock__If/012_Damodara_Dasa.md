Hare Krishna.

  

Respected scholars,

  

Yes I exactly mean this point. It is not a matter of fighting based on Vedas only. The main point is that first of all inquire into the fact -- what is the difference between deaf body and living one? This is objective reality and is the main subject matter of Vedas (as main topic of Vedanta). Anyone will be able to get into it and the answer to this question will decide whether he will be able to accept vedic literatures and culture in Toto or not. We should keep in mind that unlike Indians westerners are not having cultural training from childhood into faith in vedic culture and thus they usually are not able to have unflinching faith in Vedas and vedic culture. Same is the case with modern Indians.

  

My point is that physical interpretation of esoteric and non physical statements of Vedas by Pollock and like clearly shows that they are due to non acceptance of soul's existence.

  

Moreover the question of soul's existence is common to all either vedic or not. This will build a common platform. This doesn't mean that we give up oral tradition and compromise. But starting point should be this matter and then the things solve very easily. If you see Srila Prabhupada's sincere followers (even though westerners) accept full traditional system as perfect way to accept knowledge. One can read some of the books of Prabhupada and see how much emphasis he puts on oral tradition. But for one who is not convinced of life after death (punarjanma) he thinks "why should I follow tradition and some rules which are neither logical nor yield any perceptible result." This is our practical experience in preaching all over world, even in India. Once this misconception is solved he understands that Vedas are divine and meant for soul's benefit in Hunan society; that human life is rare; for such a person following and accepting vedas and Sanskrit is not just a matter of etiquette but necessity and the process to receive Vedas is by oral tradition of acharyas (pramana sastra needs to be brought in).

  

Thankyou,

Damodara das
