Dear Ajitji.  
  
Probably Damodara Dasji wants to remind us all that Pollock'e theological training and belief are the greatest hindrances on his part to understand the the deliberations of the Indian scholars, who have the training and understanding of Indian philosophy, even though there have been quite a few exceptions among the western scholars, who could understand the Indian way of thinking.
