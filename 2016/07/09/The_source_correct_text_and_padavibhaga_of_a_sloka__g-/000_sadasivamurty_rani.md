Learned members of the group!

Pranams to all of you.

Can any one help me in getting the full and correct text of the following sloka.

षड्जामड्जखराड्जवीड्जवसुधाड्जालांश्च .... etc. 

1. I tried to search for it internet and also in some text books. I found this in four or five texts in Telugu script. No two texts are agreeing in the reading of the sloka.

  

2\. I came to know that this was once discussed in BVP in the year 2013. But that discussion also was not fruitful as I saw in my search.

  

3\. So if any of the scholars help me by giving :

a\) the correct text of it

b\) source of it and

c\) Its Padavibhaga and meaning (if possible) I shall be grateful to them.

Warmest regards to all,

**Prof. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
