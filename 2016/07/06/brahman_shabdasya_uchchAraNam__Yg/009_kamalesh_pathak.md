Anandji  
Kaudinya shiksha is applicable for the samved followers the word ब्रह्म is seen everywhere so the rules of kaudinya shiksha is not final rule for the other Vedic branches. See I am yajurvedin so I will follow yaagyavalkya shiksha. Shiksha granthas are meant to convenience the relevant followers. इति मे मति। . regards.
