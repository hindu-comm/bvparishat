ॐ नमः शिवाय  

Dear Kamalesh ji,

I went through the archive and found the explanation quoted by HN Bhat sir. He quoted from कौण्डिन्यशिक्षा

हकारान्नणमाः ऊर्ध्वं प्रसरन्ति हात् इति

So न ण and म will be pronounced before ह in this context of discussion. Here हकार will be treated as औरस्य

  

Pranams  

Anand
