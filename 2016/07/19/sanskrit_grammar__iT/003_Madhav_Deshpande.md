Thanks, Ajit-ji, for a pdf of Professor Thieme's book, Panini and the Veda. Professor Thieme was a visiting professor at the University of Pennsylvania, during the absence of Professor George Cardona, when I was a graduate student working on my Ph.D. Cardona was a student of Thieme at Yale University.
