***Kṛṣṇaṃ vande Jagadgurūm***  
  
On the holy occasion of *Gurupurnima* I am honoured to present the interface of Jagadgurū Bhagavān Kṛṣṇa's divine song "*śrīmadbhagavadgītā*". The links are as follows -  
<http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/scl/sbg/main.html>  
  
And on our mirror site  
<http://52.25.246.194/scl/sbg/main.html>  
  
This interface provides the salient features such as,  
anvaya of each verse,  
padaccheda,  
padaparicaya,  
kāraka-ākāṅkṣā,  
samāsa vigraha alongwith structural analysis  
meaning of each pada linked to Amarakoṣa, Apte and Monier-Williams dictionaries,  
hindi and english translations.  
  
This interface is a part of my doctoral thesis under the guidance of my gurū Prof. Amba Kulkarni.  
I would whole-heartedly appreciate your valuable inputs.
