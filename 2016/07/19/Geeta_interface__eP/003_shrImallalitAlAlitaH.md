Thanks for sharing this great work with us.

I understand that clicking on words on right-pan gives you a new pop-up with options to select dictionary, and clicking on shloka-number in the same pan presents some image which appears to explain relation of words.

  

1\. I failed to find any pop-up for samAsa though.

2\. I don't find any link which can take me back to Chapter list/HomePage. Please, add that if it is not there.

  

I've shared the link on other platforms. I hope people who want to learn Sanskrit while reading something interesting and those who want to understand gItA with clarity, will be benefited by your work.
