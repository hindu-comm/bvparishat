Respected Scholars, Namakar!



Book Sacrifices in BrahmaNa texts by G. U.Thite (Pune) p66 , 67and other pages.



Some BrahmaNa texts treat VaruNa, Rudra and Marut as diseases-VaruNa diseases from water, Rudra diseases from air, Marut diseases from air and wind. Rudra was asked to go beyond Mujavat mountain (north of Afghanistan)like Takman (Maleria) was asked in Atharva Veda. Rudra has a very little place in the Shrauta-ritual in general and wherever he has any, it is generally for removing him away.



Many strange practices from BrahmaNa-texts are described in this book including animal sacrifices.



I feel very disturbed after reading this book.



However as the time was passing, understanding of Ahimsa and importance of spiritual practices was growing in the ancient society of India and sacrifices were gradually descreasing in number. But there was a time when they were growing in number. This could be important from the point of view of devising new mantras for newly added sacrifices. Some of the rituals of masses were elevated to ritual of classes.Some rituals looked like curing diseases appearing at the time of changing seasons.

Please let us know your opinions. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
