The author-given name of the ṭīkā is Sudhā-sāgara. The name Bhīmasenī must have been used by some later scholar because the author was Bhīma-sena (Dīkṣita).

  

The ṭīkā seems to have been first edited by Nārāyaṇa-śāstrī Khiste and published in the Chaukhambā Saṁskṛta Series of Banāras (= Vārāṇasi) in 1924-28. A second edn is included in Prof. Rewāprasāda Dwivedī’s Kāvya-prakāśa edn published in 1981 as no. 3 in the Prācya-vidyā Grantha-mālā of the Kāśī Hindū Viśva Vidyālaya (= Banaras Hindu University).
