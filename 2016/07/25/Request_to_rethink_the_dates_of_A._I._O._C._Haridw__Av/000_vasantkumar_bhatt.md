The dates of Kalidasa Samaaroha ( Ujjain ) are declared :- from 10 to 16 November2016. And the dates for A. I. O. C. Are 12-14 November. A scholar who wants to attend the both , has to loose one of the two.  
The Secretary and the executive committee are requested to change the dates of aioc. ( Because the days of Kalidasa Samaaroh a are traditionally fixed, and cannot be changed.  
Thanks, Vasantkumar Bhatt
