Dear Ram,

As I said before, samAdhi is an experiential state by definition,

it is not an observational product. You tacitly assume that an

experience is a brain function. Here you have to apply more

of psychology. My difficulty is the use of the word samAdhi

in your definition. If the moderators allow, such going around

the bush might continue. But it is an ill-posed question.
