Dear Sunil ji,

  

Thanks for the information and comments.

  

##### [Sunil Bhattacharjya]() (Jul 30, 2016)

With the Jnana and the Yoga, one can get out of the grip of *Prakṛti* andbecome *Jivanmukta* in this life itself and *Videhamukta* at the end of thislife and not to be reborn. Thus, one can look at the relation *Samādhi* andthe Cycle of Death and Rebirth. Those who do not believe in the Cycle ofdeath and rebirth will not understand the Hindu way of looking at what onecan achieve through Yoga. If desired I can elaborate on this.

##### Vimal

According to Buddha, at *Samādhi*, we get *mukti*/liberation from our daily sufferings that are are still present as we do not have control on them, but we do not feel them. This is because we acquire *Ānanda *(Bliss) by maximally activating our pleasure centers in our brain [(Wikipedia, 2016)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_system#Pleasure_centers), which is many times stronger than our quotidian sufferings. As you might know, Buddhism is an atheist religion which rejects the existence of soul/self after death because there is no robust evidence.  

  

Cheers!

  

Regards,

Ram
