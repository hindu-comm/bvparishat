Respected vidwansDr. Bijoy jiand shri Ravindranath ji,

  

Thanks for excellent comments.

  

I am not trying to redefine various*Samādhi* states. I am just trying to analyze them based on various claims made by various groups. While doing that, I came up with a scientifically testable hypothesis. My goal is to investigate if we can reject this hypothesis with scientific evidence.

My working hypothesis is as follows:



*Nirvikalpa Samādhi (presumably the highest level of Samādhi) is also mind-brain based because it has a neural basis; the Self does not leave the mind-brain system because self-related cortical and subcortical midline structures are still activated, and Samādhi-state knowledge has significant subjective biases because it depends on metaphysical beliefs. Thus, this knowledge is also controversial and we cannot take it for granted; for example, compare atheist systems Buddhism/Jainism vs. theist Vedānta vs. other religions.*

Cheers!

  

Kind regards,

Ram
