Dear Ajitji,  
  

With the Jnana and the Yoga one can get out of the grip of Prakrti and become Jivanmukta in this life itself and Videhamukta at the end of this life and not to be reborn. Thus one can look at the relation Samadhi and the Cycle of Death and Rebirth.. Those who do not believe in the Cycle of death and rebirth will not understand the Hindu way of looking at what one can achieve through Yoga. If desired I can elaborate on this.  
  

Regards,
