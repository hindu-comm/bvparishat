Respected vidwāns Ravindranath ji and Sunil ji,



Thanks for excellent comments and suggestions.



My working hypothesis is as follows:



*Nirvikalpa Samādhi (presumably the highest level of Samādhi) is also mind-brain based because it has a neural basis; the Self does not leave the mind-brain system because self-related cortical and subcortical midline structures are still activated, and Samādhi-state knowledge has significant subjective biases because it depends on metaphysical beliefs. Thus, this knowledge is controversial and we cannot take it for granted; for example, compare atheist systems Buddhism/Jainism vs. theist Vedānta vs. other religions.*



I invite everybody to reject this hypothesis with appropriate justifications and scientific (based on logic + reproducible evidence) and/or pseudoscientific (based on logic) evidence.



Cheers!

  

Kindest regards,

Ram

If they were explained properly I don’t think we would have had any problem, instead everyone would have been great full and follow it, sir today’s biggest challenge is survival and that is to live without sickness and death and everyone wants to live longer, and today every scientist are trying to figure out the construction of the body and try to rectify and make people longer with a cost, and every religion is promising the hell and heaven according to their doing and tryingto capitalise on the fear of the people.  
Sir you asked me about how my practice is going on it is going on really great, if one wantsto achieve the next stage in life first they needto know what is their goal. If someone is telling that yoga is a way of life then one should know what is the meaning of Yoga and for which it is related to and then only one can understand what is the process and what is happening and how it can be responsibly taken care and so on.  
Today the everyone claiming that their religion is great because no religion is helping anyone because the results are same in all the religion and they are scared so they are trying to put down each other, if you are a scientist and the theory which you believe in doesn’t work I don’t think you will follow it you will just leave it and go on and try to find the next, the same thing is happening with the Indian knowledge every gurus, scholars and vidwans are only giving lectures about how great is Devanagri and the Veda’s, Upanishads, Yoga sutras and so on and nobody showing what is the results by practicing it, why one should die with such difficulties by getting up early in the morning and doing so many asana, pranayama and other things.  
If someone really gives the meaning and benefits of our Indian knowledge definitely their will be abig paradigm shift. I will give a small understanding of mine about Yoga it is process of joining and teaming of cells it starts from the time the sperm hatches with the egg and starts adding cells in the mother womb because this body is not a unicellular organism it is a multicellular organism, and in yoga sutra the first pada is Samadhi pada which tells about the behaviourism of the formation of this body the strength and weakness of it, hope you find some more interesting factors if we try to look at an engineering point of view.

##### *Dear Ravindranathji,*

Shri Ramji will reply to your mail. I had a look at your mail and find the  
following interesting;  
  
\< - - - - - - - - if you are a scientist and the theory which you believe  
in doesn’t work I don’t think you will follow it you will just leave it and  
go on and try to find the next, the same thing is happening with the Indian  
knowledge - - - - - ->  
  
Having been in the Scientific profession for more than four decades, I can  
assure you that science is yet to say the last word in any subject. Many  
scientists may think that our knowledge of creation of matter is complete,  
but really it is not so. Just to give you an example, it in only very  
recently that it has been found that there is dark matter in this universe,  
which in fact, is much more than the visible matter in the universe. So  
also in all other areas, where new knowledge is emerging and many old  
concepts are being discarded. But in the spiritual matters, we have the  
Vedas and Upanishads, which we consider as the eternal texts.
