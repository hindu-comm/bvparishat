What is India Discovery centre. This is what Wiki has to say about Patanjali.

The [compound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit_compound "Sanskrit compound") name Patañjali has been explained by Sanskrit commentators in two ways. The first explanation of the word is *añjalau patan iti patañjali* (Patañjali is one falling into folded hands), which is a *mayūravyaṁsakādi* compound with *śakandhvādi* [Sandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandhi "Sandhi").^([\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patanjali#cite_note-arapv-9)) The name comes from a legend about his birth which says that [Śeṣa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shesha "Shesha"), the divine serpent-king, [incarnated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar "Avatar") as a snakelet and fell into the folded hands ([Anjali Mudra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C3%B1jali_Mudr%C4%81 "Añjali Mudrā")) of a Brahmin.^([\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patanjali#cite_note-arapv-9)) The second explanation parses the word as a [Bahuvrihi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahuvrihi "Bahuvrihi") compound *patanto namaskāryatvena janānāmañjalayo yasmin viṣaye sa* (He for whom the folded hands of people are falling is Patañjali).^([\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patanjali#cite_note-arapv-9)) The compound name Patan jali: "Patan" is 'bank' and "Jal" is 'water', in the [Sindhi language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindhi_language "Sindhi language") of the Indus Valley Civilization.^([\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patanjali#cite_note-Moonis_Ayaz_Shaikh-10))
