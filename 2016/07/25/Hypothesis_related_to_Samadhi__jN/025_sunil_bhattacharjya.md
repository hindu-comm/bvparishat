Dear friends,  
  

I posed the question to Shri Vimalji about his views on the Theory of Rebirth, which is the corner-stone of the indian philosophy. Vimalji appeared to be sceptic about the the Theory of Rebirth, . That itself shows the limitation of the neuro-science, for discussing theissues of
Indian philosophy.  
  

Regards,
