Sri Ramji,

 I am glad I could finally find someone who could say about hypothesis and reality, today our scholars have made many realities to look like hypothesis but I think our ancients never believed in hypothesis and they were very practical I believe, as I have said the yoga starts as the two gametes join and form a cell and start cleaving and adding the cell to form the body and after the gestation one is born and that is Samadhi, and that is why the first step (pada) is called Samadhi pada and it is like the manual of that formation and it describes the intention and behaviourism of the formation if we understand that we can move to the second step (pada) that is sadana pada and make the difference in intention and the behaviourism.

 I am an engineer by profession and not by degree and I don’t believe in hypothesis, I repair and refurbish the high tech multi axis CNC machine tool and I can understand the machine better and make them work better, and someone doesn’t know the technology and logic that how it works it doesn’t become hypothesis, our physical body is one of the best machine and Patanjali has tried to describe what is this formation characteristic and how it can be put in order and how it can used but many of our yoga school straight move to the middle of the second step and teach astanga yoga with knowing the behaviour pattern of the formation how one can move to the second step sadana pada. I believe in mind and body relation I have tried to talk many yoga teachers the same but they never understand.

 The formation is body, mind and theory that is Yantra (machine) Tantra (logic) and Mantra (theory), I believe our ancients were masters in sound technology (Shabha jnana the 9^(th) sutra of Samadhi pada describes about it) today we use the sound technology in many areas, I hope they discovered the whole universe through Shabha jnana we may not be understanding that doesn’t mean it is a hypothesis, our education system is not supporting in enhancing our knowledge of Life and living.

 Everyone wants to live long but I could not understand why and everyone is busy in finding the ways and means to find a solution to live longer, anyways Sri Ramji I don’t know whether I have been able to put forward what I believe in a understanding way, I have also come into contact with Dr Malali Gowda who is working on biodiversity and DNA life it is a very interesting subject like neuro science and I welcome all the logical information about life.

 I am just a beginner in this subject of life

##### *Dear Ravindranathji,*

Shri Ramji will reply to your mail. I had a look at your mail and find the  
following interesting;  
  
\< - - - - - - - - if you are a scientist and the theory which you believe  
in doesn’t work I don’t think you will follow it you will just leave it and  
go on and try to find the next, the same thing is happening with the Indian  
knowledge - - - - - ->  
  
Having been in the Scientific profession for more than four decades, I can  
assure you that science is yet to say the last word in any subject. Many  
scientists may think that our knowledge of creation of matter is complete,  
but really it is not so. Just to give you an example, it in only very  
recently that it has been found that there is dark matter in this universe,  
which in fact, is much more than the visible matter in the universe. So  
also in all other areas, where new knowledge is emerging and many old  
concepts are being discarded. But in the spiritual matters, we have the  
Vedas and Upanishads, which we consider as the eternal texts.
