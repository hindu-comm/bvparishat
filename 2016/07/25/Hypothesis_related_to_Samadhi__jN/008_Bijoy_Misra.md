Dear Ram,

You are assuming what samAdhi is. First you need to understand and appreciate what the word implies.

I think you would benefit to gain an understanding of samAdhi by analyzing various scriptural interpretations

or purely experimenting by following the recommended path of Patanjali.
 Bharatiya Vidvat Parishat

is a Sanskrit and scripture analysis group. Hence you had an ill posed question there. In order that

your hypothesis may be tested, the participants must have an understanding of samAdhi and should

be able to analyze the experience in a neuroscience point of view.  If you wish semantic interpretation,

you may study some mImAmsA literature on technical word definitions.
Others in this list might give you

different directions.

Thank you.

BM
