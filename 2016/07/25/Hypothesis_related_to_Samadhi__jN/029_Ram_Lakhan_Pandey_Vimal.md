Dear Sunil ji and Ajit ji,

  

Thanks for further comments and elaboration.

##### [Sunil Bhattacharjya]() (Jul 29, 2016):Yes, Samadhi is sama+dhi. The Yogasutra begins with the Samadhi-pada. I posed the question to Shri Vimalji about his views on the Theory of Rebirth, which is the corner-stone of the Indian philosophy. Vimalji appeared to be sceptic about the Theory of Rebirth. That itself shows the limitation of the neuroscience, for discussing the issues of Indian philosophy.

[Ajit Gargeshwari]() (Jul 30, 2016):Samadhi and Rebirth are unrelated. We should be focusing only Consciousness and neuroscience. Let us not get into belief systems if we talking about serious philosophy on this thread.

##### Vimal:Science requires reproducible empirical evidence for scientific research. The *Samādhi* state has robust reproducible evidence, but rebirth lacks such evidence. Therefore, let us first try our best rigorously to reject the Samādhi related hypothesis. My understanding is that science does not prove anything; it only rejects a hypothesis if we find a single contradiction in it. As long as a hypothesis is not rejected we cautiously implement it in our life.

Cheers!

  

Regards,

Ram
