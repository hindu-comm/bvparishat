That line is due to Swami Sarvagatananda (<http://www.swamisarvagatananda.org>)

who mentioned it thirty years ago. I have not checked further.

I taught and did the site after Swami passed away.

I will look and learn. It could be one of those local variations. I left it as a tribute

to the deceased Swami.
