Dear Ajit ji,

  

Thanks for excellent comments!

Samadhi is not trance. There is no neural basis to explain Nirvikalpa

Samadhi and Sahaja Nirvikalpa Samadhi. An experience should have a subject and object relationship. Can there be a neural basis where there is no subject-object relationship? As far as science can go one can go till the level of Samadhi with vikalpa. Science or Neuroscience cannot explain a state, where there is no Subject-Object relation or a Nondual state. Mathematically models can be designed where the observer himself can be a part of the of the observed but would like to know if such a model has been arrived at.

Very interesting query!



Yes, there must be a neural basis when there is no subject-object relationship, and also for anything we can think of. For example, parietal lobe (responsible for discrimination between subject and object) is deactivated and frontal lobe is more activated (for theunification of subject and object) at this state compared to normal subjects.



“The neural correlates (the physical aspect of the *samādhi* state of brain-mind system) include (i) happiness center in amygdala-NN, (ii) visual areas, (iii) parietal lobe deactivation for losing discrimination of subject and objects, and the activation of frontal lobe for theunification of subject and objects, respectively.” (Endnote 77 and Section 4.1.2. of [(Vimal, 2012c)](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/2.1.1982.0485)).  

  

Cheers!

  

Kind regards,

Ram
