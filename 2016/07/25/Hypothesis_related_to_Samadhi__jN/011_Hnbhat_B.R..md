"**We note that the person's name was Patanjala, the technique going by his name is Patanjali.**"  
From the lessons in the site.

Strange Statement!

We know the name of author of YS is Patanjali, which is defined as पतन्नञ्जलौ === पतञ्जलिः, as known from a verse:

**योगेन चित्तस्य पदेन वाचां मलं शारीरस्य च वैद्यकेन।**  
**योऽपाकरोत्तं प्रवरं मुनीनां पतञ्जलिं प्रांजलिरानतोऽस्मि॥**

He is known by the name **पतञ्जलि** .

Thanks for the new information.
