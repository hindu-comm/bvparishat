Dear Bijoy ji,

  

Thanks for your comments.

  

As I mentioned in one of my previous emails, my understanding of 3 types of samAdhiis as follows:

  

As per [(Yoga of Sri Chinmoy, 2016)](http://www.yogaofsrichinmoy.com/the-higher-worlds/samadhi-fld/samadhi/), “**Savikalpa, Nirvikalpa and Sahaja Samadhi** \[:\] There are three types of samādhi: Savikalpa samādhi, Nirvikalpa samādhi and Sahaja samādhi.



In Savikalpa samādhi there can be thoughts inside the trance, but the trance will not be disturbed or perturbed. The thoughts are like children playing in a room when the father is deeply absorbed in his studies. The children are playing, but they do not disturb him. So in Savikalpa samādhi there can be a turbulence of thoughts and ideas, but the divine trance that the seeker is enjoying will not be affected.



In Nirvikalpa samādhi there is no thought, no idea, nothing whatsoever. All is tranquility, or you can say tranquility’s flood. Here nature’s dance comes to an end. The restless activity of human nature cannot play its role. There is no thought, no idea, no form, only the transcendental Silence and boundless Peace, Light and Delight. In this expanse of infinite Peace, Light and Delight, there exist only the seeker and his Beloved Supreme, who have become one.



Then comes a samādhi known as Sahaja samādhi. In this samādhi, after having attained the highest realm of consciousness, one can remain on earth and enter into multifarious activities while maintaining his highest realization. It is as if one is sitting quietly inside a jet plane which is flying at a speed of seven-hundred miles per hour, but one does not notice any motion at all. In Sahaja samādhi one maintains the highest transcendental consciousness within and, at the same time, throws himself into the world’s activities in order to transform humanity and free humanity from ignorance. This samādhi is for those who have reached the Highest and whom the Highest Absolute Supreme wants to manifest Himself in and through” (some spelling editings are mine).



Any kind of experience has neural-basis; so as long as we are aware and experience, there will always be neural-basis. In all types of SamAdhi, there is always correlated neural basis, and there are always subjective biases. This is the null hypothesis for testing. Let us investigate if we can reject it.  

  

Cheers!

  

Regards,

Ram
