Vimalji,  
  

If you think Buddhism is atheist, so be it for you, If you think you don't have to study more about Buddhism, I have no issue. I cannot ignore what I wrote from my understanding.. I also cannot ignore the Tathagaat-garbha" in Buddhism, which goes from one birth to the other. I also cannot ignore the mention of "Brahman" in the Buddhist sutta. I also cannot ignore the promulgation of Mahayana by Lord Buddha,  
  

So as advised by Ajitji, this discussion ends here.  
  

Sincerely,  

skb
