Dear Ram,

  

I don't wish to get into a debate here.

Patanjali defines the term samAdhi in his work.

We don't need to redefine it. You can

create a new terminology for your definition.

Redefinition is a peculiar misplaced imposition

on the creative literature. Rampant in the west!

I would request to avoid.

  

Best wishes,

BM
