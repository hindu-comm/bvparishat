Dear Bijoy ji,

  

Thanks for your comments.

I don't wish to get into a debate here. Patanjali defines the term samAdhi in his work. We don't need to redefine it. You can create a new terminology for your definition. Redefinition is a peculiar misplaced imposition on the creative literature. Rampant in the west! I would request to avoid.

I am not trying to redefine various*Samādhi*states. I am just trying to analyze them based on various claims made by various groups. While doing that, I came up with a scientifically testable hypothesis. My goal is to investigate if we can reject this hypothesis with scientific evidence. My working hypothesis is as follows:



*Nirvikalpa Samādhi (presumably the highest level of Samādhi) is also mind-brain based because it has a neural basis; the Self does not leave the mind-brain system because self-related cortical and subcortical midline structures are still activated, and Samādhi-state knowledge has significant subjective biases because it depends on metaphysical beliefs. Thus, this knowledge is also controversial and we cannot take it for granted; for example, compare atheist systems Buddhism/Jainism vs. theist Vedānta vs. other religions.*

As I said before, samAdhi is an experiential state by definition, it is not an observational product. You tacitly assume that an experience is a brain function. Here you have to apply more of psychology. My difficulty is the use of the word samAdhi in your definition. If the moderators allow, such going around the bush might continue. But it is an ill-posed question.

##### Vimal

NO! You have misconstrued. My framework is NOT materialism; I am not assuming that an experience is a brain function. My framework is an extended dual-aspect monism, where each entity-state has *inseparable* mental and physical aspects. So SamAdhi state of our mind-brain system also has *inseparable* 1pp-mental (such as experiences related to SamAdhi) and 3pp-physical aspects (such as related neural-network and its activities, which we can publically measure using say functional MRI; there are many articles on this topic, just use google scholar). 1pp: 1^(st) person perspective, 3pp: 3^(rd) pp. As mentionedbefore, I am NOT using my definition of SamAdhi. I am just using whatever is already there in our System and *Sāṃkhya*with the help of Vinod ji. My working hypothesis is crystal clear.

  

Cheers!

  

Kind regards,

Ram
