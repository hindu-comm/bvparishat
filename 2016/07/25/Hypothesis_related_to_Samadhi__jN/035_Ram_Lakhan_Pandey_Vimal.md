Dear Sunil ji,

  

Thanks for comments.

I think you need to study more on Buddhism, before comparing what Lord Buddhataught with what the Vedanta teaches. Lord Buddha never said that there is no God? When some monks asked Lord Buddha whether there was God or not he was silent on that and insteadhe asked them first to follow his teachings, which he already imparted. Seeing this Ananda (a disciple and an associate of Lord Buddha) asked Lord Buddha the reason for his silence and he replied that either way the questioners would not understand whether he says God exists or not. It was only later on that Lord Buddha gave the advanced teaching to his advanced disciples, citing that Sariputra realized that the five sheaths are empty, and that is similar to what the Vedanta says. The Jivanmukta does realize that through samyak jnana and yoga he could become free and no longer needs to be within shackles of the five sheaths. All these are beyond the scope of the neurological studies and it is better that the neuro-scientists realize theirlimitations, sooner than later.

My understanding has been that Buddhism and Jainism are atheist religions, whereas Vedanta is theist system. There are two divisions in [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism): older Theravada and newer Mahayana. Perhaps, God was introduced later in Mahayana. In addition, there is no soul after death in Buddhism. In Islam, there is absolutely NO re-incarnation/rebirth. In other words, various religions contradict each other; so it is hard to understand which one is correct and which one is wrong. Thus, scientific research on rebirth theory is not very useful. We can believe whatever we want for our own self-satisfaction, but we need robust reproducible data for science to make models. Even Nirvikalpa Samādhi state is extremely hard to attain; however, there are many scientific articles for finding neural basis of various levels of Samādhi state. Therefore, it is not too bad to generate working hypothesis. So let us try our best to reject it.



As per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism), “In Buddhism, dukkha is one of the[three marks of existence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_marks_of_existence "Three marks of existence"), along with[impermanence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impermanence "Impermanence")and[anattā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatt%C4%81 "Anattā")(non-self).^([\[78\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGombrich200647.2C_.27.27.27Quote:.27.27.27_.22All_phenomenal_existence_.5Bin_Buddhism.5D_is_said_to_have_three_interlocking_characteristics:_impermanence.2C_suffering_and_lack_of_soul_or_essence..22-95))Buddhism, like other major Indian religions, asserts that everything is impermanent (anicca), but, unlike them, also asserts that there is no permanent self or soul in living beings (*anattā*).^([\[79\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism#cite_note-britannicaanatta-96)[\[80\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism#cite_note-97)[\[81\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism#cite_note-5sourcesanatta-98))The ignorance or misperception (*[avijjā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avidy%C4%81_(Buddhism) "Avidyā (Buddhism)")*) that anything is permanent or that there is self in any being is considered a wrong understanding, and the primary source of clinging and dukkha.^([\[82\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism#cite_note-99)[\[83\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism#cite_note-GombrichScherrer2008p209-100)[\[84\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism#cite_note-HoffmanMahinda2013p162-101)) \[…\]



Rebirth refers to a process whereby beings go through a succession of lifetimes as one of many possible forms of[sentient life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentient_beings_(Buddhism) "Sentient beings (Buddhism)"), each running from conception to death.^([\[97\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKeown1996107-115))In Buddhist thought, this rebirth does not involve any soul, because of its doctrine of[anattā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta "Anatta")(Sanskrit:*anātman*, no-self doctrine) which rejects the concepts of a permanent self or an unchanging, eternal soul, as it is called in[Hinduism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism "Hinduism")and[Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity").^([\[98\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism#cite_note-Leaman2002p23-116))According to Buddhism there ultimately is no such thing as a self in any being or any essence in any thing.^([\[99\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism#cite_note-117)) \[…\]

**\[a\]**[Anatta](http://www.britannica.com/topic/anatta), Encyclopedia Britannica (2013), Quote: "Anatta in Buddhism, the doctrine that there is in humans no permanent, underlying soul. The concept of anatta, or anatman, is a departure from the Hindu belief in atman ("the self").";

Put very briefly, this is the \[Buddhist\] doctrine that human beings have no soul, no self, no unchanging essence.";

All these are beyond the scope of the neurological studies and it is better that the neuro-scientists realize their limitations, sooner than later.
