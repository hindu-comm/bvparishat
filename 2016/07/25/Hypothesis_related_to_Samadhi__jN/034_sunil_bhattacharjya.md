Dear Vimalji,  
  

I think you need to study more on Buddhism, before comparing what Lord Buddha taught with what the Vedanta teaches. Lord Buddha never said that there is no God? When some monks asked Lord Buddha whether there was God or not he was silent on that and instead he asked them first to follow his teachings, which he already imparted. Seeing this Ananda (a disciple and an associate of Lord Buddha) asked Lord Buddha the reason for his silence and he replied that either way the questioners would not understand whether he says God exists or not. It was only later on that Lord Buddha gave the advanced teaching to his advanced disciples, citing that Sariputra realized that the five sheaths are empty, and that is similar to what the Vedanta says. The Jivanmukta does realize that through samyak jnana and yoga he could become free and no longer needs to be within shackles of the five sheaths.  
  

All these are beyond the scope of the neurological studies and it is better that the neuro-scientists realize their limitations, sooner than later.  
  

Cheers,
