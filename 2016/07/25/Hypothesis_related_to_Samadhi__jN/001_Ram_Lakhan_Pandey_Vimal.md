Respected Vinod ji,

  

Thanks for comments.

  

As I proposed in my working hypothesis and as you commented on science, both kinds of knowledge (samādhi or science) cannot be taken for granted. Therefore, we should try all possibilities and compare the outcomes. If we find the same results/conclusions from all methods and we get consensus, then perhaps that knowledge might be close to the fundamental truth.

  

Cheers!

  

Kind regards,

Ram

Dear participants,  
  

In support of earlier mail, null findings of dark matter from LUX experiment is a point to be noted. <https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2016/jul/24/latest-results->.
