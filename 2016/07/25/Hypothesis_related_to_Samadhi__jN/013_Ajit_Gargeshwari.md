Samadhi is not trance. There are no neural basis to explain Nirvikalpa Samadhi and Shaja Nirvikalpa Samdhi. An experience should have a subject and object relationship. Can there be a neural basis where there is no subject object relationship? As far as science can go one can go till the level of Samadhi with vikalpa. Science or Neuro science cannot explain a state where there is no Subject Object relation or a Non dual state. Mathematically models can be designed where the observer himself can be apart of the of the observed but would like to know if such a model has been arrived at.
