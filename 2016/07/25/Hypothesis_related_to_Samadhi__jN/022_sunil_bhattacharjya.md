Dear Bijoyji,  
  

The puranas such as the Bhagavata Purana, Matsya Purana and Vayu Purana tell us that it is Patanjali. It could be that late Swami Sarvagatanandaji meant Patanjali but there might have been a typo in the text and the correction sheet could have been added at the end of the book.  
  

Regards,
