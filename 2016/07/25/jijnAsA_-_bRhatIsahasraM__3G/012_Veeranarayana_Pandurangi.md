these are mantras in brhati meter made out of other rks by adding some other parts of other mantras. thus one thousand brhati mantras are made and recited in yajna, as found in indra-visvamitra samvada.

it seems this recitation later has turned out be separate yagna now primarily performed in maadhvasampradaya, because it pleases visnu most. one can find this publication of PPSMB

1.  [Brhati-Sahasram (with the Tattvasara commentary of Sri
    Raghunathatirtha)](http://www.ppsm.res.in/publications/058.jpg "Indra performed a sacrifice for gaining the grace of Sri Hari and to attain prosperity after killing demon Vrtraasura. The sacrifice is known as Maha-vrata in which an altar is prepared in the design of an eagle, known as Garuda. Sri Hari, who is the presiding deity in Garuda is worshipped in this Maha-vrata. The Mantras which eulogise the glory of Sri Hari are known as Brhati-Shastra Mantras. The deity of the Brhati meter is Mukhyaprana. Worship done with these Mantras is believed to shower all prosperity on the devotees. The glory explicated in the thousand Brhati Mantras is contained in each of the thousand sacred names of Sri Vishnu (Vishnu-Sahasra-Naama)")

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि। ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि।।  
तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः। निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः।। (भ.गी.)
