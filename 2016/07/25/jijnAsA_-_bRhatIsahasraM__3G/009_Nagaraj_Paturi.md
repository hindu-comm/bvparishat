\>Pls attach who have original test of the bruhati sahasra mantras , only available in Kannada.but this is not had originality or give any inform about it

  

He probably means:

  

Who have original text of the Brihati Sahasra Mantras, please share it here. It is available only in Kannada script.Moreover, it is not the original text of the mantras. That text does not provide any information too. 

  

He made a similar request offline to me in good Sanskrit.

  

I advise him to use Sanskrit since he knows it.
