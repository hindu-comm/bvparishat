Namaste

  

In the expression 'दयाप्तौ’ - a samasta pada -

  

1\. Is there a need for avagraha, one or two, between the two words

  

2\. What samāsa is that: tatpurusha like दयायाः आप्तौ or दयायां आप्तौ where it will be a sati saptamī. Is a sati saptamī allowed in a samāsa?

  

I request the scholars here to kindly shed light on the above.

  

warm regards
