One more clue linking Sri Venkatadhwari to 'Dikshitar' title of his lineage is here:

  

<http://raghavanhema.blogspot.in/2012/10/lakshmi-sahasram-i-v-k-chary.html>

  

Sri VenkatAdhvari also called as Sri VenkatAcarya Deekshidar and Aparadesikan composed Sri LakshmI sahasram. He was born at arasaaNipAlai near Kaancipuram and lived between 1590-1660 A.D. His family lived near YatoktakAri sannadhi in Kaanchi. His forefathers had performed many yAgAs and earned the title “Deekshitar”. There is still a place in arasaaNipAlai that is referred to as “YaagasAlai”. Till date one can see a stone pillar there that is called “Yoopastambham”. Sri VenkatAdhvari was an expert in tarka, vyAkarNam, mImAmsai, vedAntam, [astrology](http://www.alamelumanga.org/) and mantra sAstram. He used to [offer](http://www.alamelumanga.org/) the fruits of all his yAga, yaj\~nam to Lord Venkateswara and hence was called VenkatAdhvari.

  
Among the many works of Sri VenkatAdhvari only some are available to us. Acarya PancaaSat, SravanAnandam, YadavarAgavEyam, Subhashita Kaustubam, ViSvaguNadarSa Sambu, Uttara Sambu, VaradAbyudaya Sambu, PradyumnAnanda nATakam, LakshmI sahasram are some of his works that have been published so far. He was said to have translated ThiuvAimozhi in to Sanskrit but the translation for only “oru nAyagamAi” pAsuram is available now.
