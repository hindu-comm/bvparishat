Dr. Ganesan's views are tenable. My emphasis was only on extreme historicism. Many problems concerning antiquity are not easily sorted out, as are sorted out issues of recent centuries.

  

Coomaraswamy went to the extent of speaking of the famed Buddha as "the pseudo-historical Buddha", and not without foundation.

  

History and meticulous documentation were no primary concerns of the East, and for solid reasons. The theological roots of fervent, and even febrile, historicism of the West has been well delineated in some of the writings of Rajiv Malhotra, especially his *Being Different.*
