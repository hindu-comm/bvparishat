To avoid confusion, let me say that I guess that Dr Ganesan's response is not to Prof. Iyengar's or aadaraNIyaNityanandji's posts. It seems to be to mine.

  

Let me respond:

  

Your query about textual evidence was answered through Stig Lundgren's words: "I have never found any such advices or injuctions in his works."

  

Let me repeat "so far no textual evidence found". If yourjijnaasaa is to know whether there is a textual evidence or not, that is anwered more than clearly.

  

But your response was to the questionof whether Sankaracharya proposed/started/systematized panchaayatana pooja.

  

To that question , the research methodological answer that was given was no textual evidence does not imply Sankaracharya did not propose/start/systematize panchaayatana pooja.

  

No textual evidence still keeps the research problem open, since textual evidence is not the only (kind of) evidence.

  

If you want me to repeat I repeat: no textual evidence. But I also repeat that does not imply Sankaracharya did not propose/start/systematize panchaayatana pooja.
