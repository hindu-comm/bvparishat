I was away and am just back.

  

I quoted Stig Lundgren's response: "Whether this custom was actually invented by Adi Shankara himself remains

an open question."

and said:

  

"One notable healthy feature of this response is to see the question as open in stead of pretending omniscience by declaring that Sankara has nothing to do with this. "

  

Mine is a strictly academic methodological statement only.

  

You are in search of evidence for "A said B". You did not find the evidence. It does not automatically imply that A did not say B. It only means that though it is said that A said B , we did not find evidence for what is said. Search for evidence is still on. That is what is meant by "the question is still open".

  

All this is purely academic and scholarly critical approach only.
