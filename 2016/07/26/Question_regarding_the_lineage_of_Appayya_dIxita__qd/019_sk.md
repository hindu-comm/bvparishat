For your information -- unlike SriVaishnavas, Madhvas are not opposed to Shiva worship at all. In fact Lord Shiva is considered as manObhimAni (presiding deity for manas) and Himself is consider parama vaishNava in Madhva doctrine. His worship is a must for every follower in the tradition.

  

Your observation that Ganesha and Shiva entered the family \*\*only\*\* after intermarriage, seems to be a little strange to me.
