Oh, you wanted to know, whether there was no textual evidence!

  

I thought you also wanted to know if Sankaracharya actually proposed /started/systematized panchaayatana puja.

  

You do not want any other discussion than your textual evidence.

  

But I have been discussing the broader aspects going beyond textual evidences. That is how discussions go.

  

They do not get stuck obstinately to one narrow point.

  

Repeating of the response was forced by repeating of the question.

  

Let me stop repeating that mistake.
