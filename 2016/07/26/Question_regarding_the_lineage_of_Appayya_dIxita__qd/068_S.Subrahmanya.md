 This thread is a perfect example of american/euro "sociologification" of Indology !.

 The indologists of yester-year also started out just like this -
Identifying the biblical "original races", "original language" etc. 

  

 In the coming decades, the funding of India-studies will go up significantly in India, while the funding in the West for the current style racist "Indology" will dramatically shrink.

 I just hope that Samskritam academics in India will resist this kind of "sociological guesswork" (I cannot call this scholarship) and not ape American indology depts.

 However, this does not mean ignoring western academia. Given the current power-structure, American indology academics must be challenged and subjected to review.

 Study of American academia itself - including Indology,RISA etc would be important.

  

 Oh also - little Domi of the indology list still thinks he is in 1916 :-

        I'd also be interested in thoughtful analyses of Malhotra as part of contemporary Hindu history, ***as an object of study*** rather than a contributor

```
         to current academic discourse. ```

  

  This is just an example of the kind of people who pervade "indology".  nuff' said.
