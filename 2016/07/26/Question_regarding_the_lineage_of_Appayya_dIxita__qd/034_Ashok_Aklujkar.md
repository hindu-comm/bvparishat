Should the last word not end in “A” or “ā”? The syntax needs a nominative.  
  
I had also heard the following charming verse as coming from Appayya Dīkṣita but have not so far had time to ascertain if it is indeed found in any of his works:  
पुरारौ च मुरारौ च नास्ति भेद: कथंचन / तथापि मामकी भक्तिश् चन्द्र-चूडे प्रधावति //  
  
a.a.
