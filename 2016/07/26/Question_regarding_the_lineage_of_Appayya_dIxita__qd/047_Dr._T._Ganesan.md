In these expressions it is clear that they refer to collective nouns--and hence, obviously all are in plural.  
  
As it is obvious , they mean "we heard before", ""by ancient sages"", ''by earlier followers'', etc. Here, one cannot demand any written ''evidence'' as proof. And, all of us--followers of the Sanatana dharma--fully accept this.  
But, when one says that a particular historical individual said so and so, or holds this view, I am sure, one should be able to give evidences from that individual's writings.  
  
So, the expressions cited below and the statement that Samkaracharya (for instance) proposed such a practice or held this or that view are not on the same level. In the latter instance one has all the literature, and if what is said is true, then it should be found in the writings. Scholars can only argue on the basis of available writings. That is why I said in my earlier mail, ""Generally it is repeated by many, but, *as scholars/researchers*, it will be better for us if the actual source where such a proposal, is clearly stated."  
  
In popular belief, one is free to hold any belief or view on somebody.  
  
I am sure we all agree that there ''are popular beliefs'' on the one hand and ''well founded scholarly views'', on the other on many matters which are obviously different.
