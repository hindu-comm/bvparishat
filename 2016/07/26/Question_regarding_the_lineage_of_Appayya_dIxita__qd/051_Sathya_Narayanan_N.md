To add on Panchayatana pooja and Shankara. I found an article, which quotes RKM book as a reference.

  

*A paragraph from “Sankara’s Teachings’ by Sri Atmananda of Sri Ramakrishna Mutt on the subject:*

*“Sankara instituted the worship of all these five Gods, Sun, Ambika, Vishnu, Ganapati and Shiva all on the same pedestal. This emphasized the idea that these are not five different Gods, but they are the one God worshipped in five different forms in different parts of India. Some wrongly think Sankara taught only Jnana and had no place for Karma. Sankara held that the place of Jnana was all-important but he knew equally well that many could not give up Karma and so they should be taught the most beneficial forms of Karma. Thus it is that the Panchayatana Puja (the worship of five Gods) came into vogue in Smartha homes. The other name for this is Siva-Puja.’’*
