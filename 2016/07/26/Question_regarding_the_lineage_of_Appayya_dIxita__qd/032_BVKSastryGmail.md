Namaste



 On \< while the great Appayya Dīkṣita was mainly a Śaiva Advaitin vehemently attacking especially the Mādhva Vaiṣṇavas \> . The key is in \<Panchaayatana Pooja, proposed by Sri Shankara Acharya, a system accommodating the personal Ishta-Devataa’ within the broad gamut of Universal Divine (Para Brahma / Parama Purusha )



1. Appayya Diskhita (1520–1593 [CE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_Era "Current Era") ) is said to be belonging to the ‘Smaarta Saiva Sampradaaya’.; and advocacy of ‘ Panchaayatana Pooja with accommodation for Ishta-Devataa of choice’ was an accepted norm for more than 1000 years before him in India. And this continues even to this day in almost all Shankara –Advaita institutions.




Appayya Dikshita, like Mahamaheswara Abhinvaguptacharya was a polyglot and open minded Sanatana Dharma traditionalist.



The three faculties, namely : Desire to seek Intellectual discourse-dialogue with sharp acumen ( Tattva Vaada – bahu shrutatva – bhau shaastrajnataa) - Personal Faith ( Kula -Paramparaa Shraddhaa – Ishta Devataa) and Taste for literature ( Kaavya – Alamkaara Sahitya)
seem never to have crossed swords in the mind of Appayya Dikshita. The work ‘Hari Hara Stuti’ is an example of such open mindedness. 



<http://shaivam.org/adappayya_works.htm> - 70. *Hari Hara stuti :* In the great *kshetra,* Chidambaram, the temple to Sri Govindaraja, the *Vishnava* Lord, which was closed for worship was thrown open again for worship during the time of Ramaraya, the regent of Vijayanagar, through the good offices of one *vaishnavite* teacher Doddacharya. **Sri Appayya Dikshita who had no distinction between Siva and Vishnu, fully welcomed this. In honor of that great event he wrote the *Harihara* Stuti. This contains ten verses. In each both Siva and Vishnu are praised alternatively. It is well-known that in Chidambaram one can have darshan of both the Lords at the same time.**

****

2. The artificiality of dividing the ‘Hinduism study’ in to blocks like ‘Saivite –Vaishnavite’ / Smaarta –Vaishnava’ faith blocks – highlighting the ‘ divisive hatred point’ is a hall mark colonial presentation and western construct.

This does not truly reflect the essence of the Sanatana Dharma, which is ‘ Unity in Diversity –Eka Devataa San-moola –Chin-Moola’- Upaasanaa.

Dear BVP Colleages,



  As you can see from the attached extract of the Sanskrit Introduction to the 1864 pothi print edition of Veṅkaṭādhvarin's Lakṣmīsahasra, evidently, while the great Appayya Dīkṣita was mainly a Śaiva Advaitin vehemently attacking especially the Mādhva Vaiṣṇavas in his Madhvatantramukhamardana, his son Raghunātha Dīkṣita and grandson Veṅkaṭādhvarin were Vaiṣṇavas. Among his later descendants we have Śaiva scholars like Nīlakaṇṭha Dīkṣita. **How did these Śaiva and Vaiṣṇava affiliations develop within this one and the same family?** If anyone knows sources for the family history of Appayya Dīkṣita and his lineage, I would very much appreciate to know those sources. Thanks for your assistance.
