Prof.Deshpande,

I am writing from memory; textual reference will be provided as and when available. Very distinct Śaiva and Vaiṣṇava affiliations among Tamil Brahmins (Iyers & Iyengars) is a late phenomenon. Appayya Diks.ita's grand father had two wives one of them being a staunch S'ri V. Due to her influence Dikshita developed interest and knowledge in the Vis'istaadvaita. This seems to be a reason for his writing his famous commentary on the Yaadavaabhyudayam of Vedanta Des'ika, (where one explanation was revealed to him in a dream). I recollect to have read this in the Srirangam edition of the Yadavabhyudayam.

regards
