That''s my point: It is accepted that there is no textual evidence.  
  
If you still say "But I also repeat that does not imply Sankaracharya did not propose/start/systematize panchaayatana pooja. "  
  
you are free to repeat any number of times as you wish. But that is obviously not discussion.  
  
  
In any forum of discussion, it is but natural that one demands proof/authority/evidence on any view expressed or supposed to have been held by some body.  
  
This is clear in my very first question in the discussion, which I repeat: **In which text Samkaracharya "proposes the Panchayatanapuja"?** **  
** ** **  
** * Generally it is repeated by many, but,* **as scholars/researchers,* it will be better for us if the actual source where such a proposal is found, is clearly stated.  
*
