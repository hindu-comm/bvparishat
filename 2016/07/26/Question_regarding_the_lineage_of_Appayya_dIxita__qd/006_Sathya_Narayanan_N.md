Respected Scholars,

  

I think, I have some information to add.

  

One of the descendants of Sri. Appaya Dikshita is in Bangalore. A Athi Rudram was organized in Vellore a year before. At that time **"one of his descendant**" had come. He made donations and participated.He looks to be a Smartha/Advaithin,

Kanchi mutt currently takes care of Appaya Deekshitas house inAdayapalam, Arani. There is a Sastri belonging to mutt, who was a student of a member of Appaya Deekshitas lineage.

  

I did come across a FB discussion which said Appaya Deekshitars wife is a Vaishnavite.

  

regards,

Sathya
