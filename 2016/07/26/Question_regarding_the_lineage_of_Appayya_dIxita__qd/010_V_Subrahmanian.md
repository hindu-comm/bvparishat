Can this person be said to be in the Appayya Dikshita lineage? It is unlikely since the name 'desikan' is not a smārta one; it is unique to the Viśiṣṭādvaita sampradāya. The article itself is by one from this following.

  

On an aside, the word 'Sambu' appearing in the paragraph below is actually 'champūḥ'.
