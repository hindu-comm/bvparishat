I began the discussion on Smaarta-Maadhva intermarriages after the Appayya Dikshita discussion was concluded, with the words "that said" , to indicate that this was going to be a related but new topic.

  

Appayya Dikshita topic had Smaarta (more specifically Sivaadvaiti) and Srivaishnava issue. The conclusion there was that the lineages of Venkatadhwari the Sri Vaishnava and Appayya Dikshita the Sivaadvaiti are different.

  

Since during the cource of the thread, there was a suspicion of a Smaarta - Vishnava intermarriage inter-marriageI pointed out that such a thing is possible at leastin Smaarta-Maadhva case in my native region, though here we are able to see that such a thing did not happen.
