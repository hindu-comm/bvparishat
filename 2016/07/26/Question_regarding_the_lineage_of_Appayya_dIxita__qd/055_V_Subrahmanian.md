Well said. This is what the earlier Sringeri Acharya had said in 1988 in a Kannada discourse in Mysore:

  

//In our Holy land, Bharath, persons in the Government, Advaitic Sannyasins,devotees and people interested in the Shastras have been celebrating , since the start of the current year, the twelfth centenary of the advent of Bhagavatpada, the preceptor. Historically, 1200-1300 years have passed since Bhagavatpada was born. If, following deliberation as on other issues, a consensus had arisen about the year of Bhagavatpada’s advent, be it 1200 years ago or earlier or later, there would have been no occasion for dispute. Historians have so far not determined the year of Buddha’s Nirvana with exactitude and certainty. Yet, in 1956, the 2500^(th)anniversary of Buddha’s Nirvana was commemorated in various parts of the globe. Research has not established that Jesus Christ was born precisely in 1 A.D. on December 25. Nevertheless, the world over, Christmas is observed on December 25 and the Christian era commences from 1 A.D. Thus, there are precedents for the anniversaries of events relating to personages being celebrated even in the absence of historical definiteness about the dates of those occurrences. So, the mere reason that 788 A.D. may actually not be the year of Bhagavatpada’s advent cannot debar or render censurable the current twelfth birth centenary celebrations...//
