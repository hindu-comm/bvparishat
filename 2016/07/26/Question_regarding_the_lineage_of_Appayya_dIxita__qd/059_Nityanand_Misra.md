*Ipso facto,* this difference of*gotra*rules outonlythe possibility that the former was a paternal grandson (*pautra*) of the latter. It does not rule out the other possibility that the former was a maternal grandson (*dauhitra*) of the latter, does it?

  

I do not have the original source (Venkateshwar Press publication) so I cannot say whether the claim was for a paternal grandson or a maternal one. I do not even have the gotra-s of the ancestors of the two, but a difference of *gotra*is not sufficient to disprove a claim that X was a grandson of Y.
