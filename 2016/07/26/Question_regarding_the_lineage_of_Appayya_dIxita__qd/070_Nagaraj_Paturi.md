Dear S Subrahmanyaji,

  

This thread hasdifferent turns and twists and three or four different themes.

  

Which one did you find to be 'sociologifying'?

  

Looking for Saiva- Vaishnava connections of the authors?

  

Looking for the origins of Panchaayatana puja in texts?

  

Can you please clarify?
