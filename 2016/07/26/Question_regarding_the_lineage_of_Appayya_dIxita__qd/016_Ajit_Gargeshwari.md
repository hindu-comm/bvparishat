Sub castes are no issue now a days. The criteria most people look for if it’s an arranged marriage are both bride and Groom are Brahmins or not
During my grand-father days they used to look for couple from Same smarta sub caste but should be from different gotras till the Hindu marriage act was amended which allows marriage between the same gotras now.
