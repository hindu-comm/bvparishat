For your information -- unlike SriVaishnavas, Madhvas are not opposed to Shiva worship at all. In fact Lord Shiva is considered as manObhimAni (presiding deity for manas) and Himself is consider parama vaishNava in Madhva doctrine. His worship is a must for every follower in the tradition.



So what you are saying is Shiva is considered as a Parama Vaishnava hence you worship. Else you don’t worship Shiva.
