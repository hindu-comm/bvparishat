Dear Prof. Iyengar

  

The original attachment from Prof. Deshpande, which usesतस्य पुत्रः twice, is from 1864 pothi print edition of Veṅkaṭādhvarin's *Lakṣmīsahasra*, while note 6 in the reference you cited (*History of Classical Skt Lit*) refers to the introduction of *Alaṅkāracandrikā* (published by Venkateshwar Press). Just curious if the *Alaṅkāracandrikā*also specifically claims Veṅkaṭādhvarin to be the *paternal* grandson of Appayya Dīkṣita.

  

I am not questioning the conclusion in*History of Classical Skt Lit*, but only interested in tracing the exact text in*Alaṅkāracandrikā*to which it responds.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
