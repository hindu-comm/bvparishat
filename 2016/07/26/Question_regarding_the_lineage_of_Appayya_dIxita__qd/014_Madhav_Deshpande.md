As it turns out, that was the case with my grand parents' marriage. The Deshpande family was, at least until the generations of my great grand-parents, a Mādhva Vaiṣṇava family, but my grand-mother came from a family of Ganesha devotees, and with her, Ganesha and Shiva entered our family, and have been there ever since.
