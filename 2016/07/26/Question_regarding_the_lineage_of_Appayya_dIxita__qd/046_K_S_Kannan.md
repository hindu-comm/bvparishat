Coomaraswamy cites the statement

"the myth is not my own, I had it from my mother" (Euripedes),to note the universality of the oral traditions.

  

His *Bugbear of Literacy* debunks the prime importance paid to literacy as the sole/primary instrument of culture, as well as the nonsense perpetrated by the printed word . (Bernard Shaw was no less denunciatory about the latter.)

  

The golden words of Coomaraswamy are memorable:

'It is far better not to know how to read

       than not to know what to read."
