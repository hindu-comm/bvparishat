Well said. Another 'linga' that Shankaracharya has advocated is 'if a particular practice is followed by 'śiṣṭa-s' then it need not be subjected to any further examination. Shankara places great value for shisṭācāra. The Panchayatana puja is practiced by such people and there is no prohibition for it in the shastras. One cannot question: Is there prescription? For this question alone the Tai.Up. answers: follow what the shishtas do. The shishtas will not be doing something prohibited. They will be following what other shistas, purvāh, have followed. How such practice came into being is a question that may not get an answer. That is not required is what the above nyāya conveys.

An article in Tamil has some inputs to show that there is the beejam, seed, for the shaṇmata-s in Shankara's admitted works like the prasthānatraya bhashya and other works like the Prapanchasāra:

  

An Tamil article titled 'சங்கரரும்-வைணவமும்’ - ஓர் விமர்சனம் is available in this location:

  

<http://www.mediafire.com/download/ya0ejj8wb03i3tm/sankararum_vainavamum_TTA.pdf>  

  

The article points out the mistaken ideas the author of the Tamil booklet 'Sankararum-Vaiṇavamum' has put forward to claim a relationship between Shankaracharya and vaiśṇavism. Since it is in Tamil, the present article is also in the same language.
