A hint, perhaps, at the enormity of the Scriptural literature we have lost - not necessarily due to the depradatory agenda of the invading hordes, despite the fact that the havoc they have wrought is by no means non-monumental - is evident in Patañjali's plain statement,

"*sahasravartmā sāmavedaḥ* ..."etc.,

but also in Bhartṛhari's enunciation,

*"ṛṣīṇām api yaj-jñānam tad apy āgama-pūrvakam".*
