Dear Professor Iyengar,

  

  Thank you so much for pointing to the evidence provided by Krishnamacharya in hisHistory of Classical Skt.Lit. This resolves my original question substantially, though, as pointed out by Shri Nityanand Misra, there could be maternal connections involved. Will keep on looking for further sources.
