Perhaps Sri Madhav ji is right in alluding to those 'stories.' Here is a foreword to a book 'shānkara-pāda-bhūṣaṇam' by a scholar Sri Digambara Sastri, available for download too in archives. There he lists some of those practices which prevailed in Pune or some northern region. A discussion on the topic is available here:
