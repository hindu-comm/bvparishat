This takes us into the whole issue of orality and literacy and related issues such as privileging literacy over orality as a feature of modernity and modern 'scientific' notions of evidence, complex interface between oral and literate textualizations etc.

  

During the British time, many Indians had incur huge property losses due to insistence on written evidences for property claims which were though genuine did not have any written documentation.

  

Even today Indian tribes are suffering due to insistence on written evidences for their claims.

  

Complex interface between oral and literate textualizations are exemplified by what Prof. Kannan quoted from Vakyapadiyam. The central claim of Bhartrihari in the book that ----he was just preserving the theoretical foundations of Ashtadhyayi that were textualized by Sangrahawhichwas 'lost' (astamupAgatE) in course of time--- itself isall described in detail as an oral to literate to oral to literate transfer from time to time. Finally he says his Gurus acquired the vyAkaraNa Agama from Parvata (parvatAdAgamam labdhvA) and he was putting into written form what was given to him orally by his Gurus. In spite of he giving such a detailed account, modern researchers resist toaccept his claim andask for written evidences for the claim that it is Sangraha rewritten.
