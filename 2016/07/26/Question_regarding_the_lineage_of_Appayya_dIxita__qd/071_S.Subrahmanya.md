Dear Sir,

  

 My view on "sociologification" was about the shaiva-vaishnava discord.
Just as a background , in the 2006 California textbook case, the Shaiva/Vaishnava discord was used

 by the usual suspects, as an example of evil brahminical dogma. and justifying the need for California Board of Education to civilize NRI Hindu kids and inform other US high-school kids

 about the evils of the Hindu traditions in US textbooks.



 On the Panchaayatana puja also, I agree with your views.

 I would say that the use of "only textual sources" as valid can be termed as the "Lutherification" of Indology. 

 Martin Luther (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther> ), was the violent guy who insisted on a more literal interpretation and sole dependency on the bible.

 Samskrit scholars may have to understand Christianity to get a sense of why Indologists do what they do.



 Regards,

 Subrahmanya
