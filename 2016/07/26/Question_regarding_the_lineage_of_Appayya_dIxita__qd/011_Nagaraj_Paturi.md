AadaraNIya Sri V Subrahmanianji,

  

From the details collected so far by me and by Dr Ajit Gargeshwari , Sivaadvaiti Appayya Dikshitar and the Appayya Dikshitar found in the document shared by Prof. Deshpande are, in all probability, two different individuals. 

  

I showed the Dikshitar link not to say that Sivaadvaiti Appayya Dikshitar is the forefather of Sri Venkatadhwari.

  

My intention was to try to make sense of the word Dikshitar found in the document shared by Prof. Deshpande. The document you responded to helps us in this regard.
