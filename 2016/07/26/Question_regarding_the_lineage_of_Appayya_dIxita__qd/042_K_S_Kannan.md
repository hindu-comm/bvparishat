 "  .........Indian tradition have only oral origins, it may not be a fruitful      exerciseto keep looking for written evidences for each one of them."

  

Dear Prof. Paturi,

  

Very well said.

  

Ananda Coomaraswamy, whose sense of history was no less keen than that of some of the best of historians, also laid high - that is, due - emphasis on this idea.

  

While this is not to be taken as an easy license to make any tall claims, positive or negative, in respect of the remote past, the truth of the situation ought not to be overlooked.

  

After all, expressions such as

"*iti śuśruma*",

"*pūrvebhir ṛṣibhiḥ*", and

"*pathibhiḥ pūrvyaiḥ*"

are encountered in even the Vedic literature.

  

It is the modern obsession with intellectual property rights, preceded &/or backed by a rabid Eurocentrism, that has verily vested the historical approach with an exaggerated importance.
