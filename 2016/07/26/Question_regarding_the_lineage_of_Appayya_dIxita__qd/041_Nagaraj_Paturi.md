\>In which text Samkaracharya "proposes the Panchayatanapuja"?



The quote obviously is from the post of Dr BVK Sastry in this thread.



This question is already discussed in various forums.



The points that emerged from these discussions are:



1\. One Stig Lundgren, [here](http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2003-June/011853.html)in one of the forums responded as follows:

One notable healthy feature of this response is to see the question as open in stead of pretending omniscience by declaring that Sankara has nothing to do with this.

  

2\. [Here](http://shanmatha.blogspot.in/2009/11/panchayatana-puja.html)the blogger broadens the prevalence of the tradition beyond Smartas and conjectures that it was part of general 'Sanatana Dharma'. Sankara probably 'systematized' it.

  

3. When people observe that a. it is a Smarta specific feature , b. Smarta tradition was 'founded' by Sankara, they combine, though it may not be perfectly logical , that this feature was introduced by Sankara.

  

4. Since most of the culture in ancient world in general and ancient Indian culture in particular, including our own respective favourite Indian tradition have only oral origins, it may not be a fruitful exercise to keep looking for written evidences for each one of them.
