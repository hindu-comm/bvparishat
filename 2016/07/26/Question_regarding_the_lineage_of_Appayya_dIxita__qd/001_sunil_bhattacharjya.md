Namaste,  
  
In an introduction to the book containing Brahmatarkastava and Pancharatnastuti, the editor, R. Krishnaswami Sastri gives some details of the father and grandfather of Appaya Dikshita and says that Dikshita himself as well his father and grandfather were ardent advaitins and R.K.Sastri relates an  instance, when Appayya Dikshita was invited to a Viashnava program on Desikachara-composed drama, where a stage performer put his foot on the head of Lord Shiva and that upset Dikshita. That could be the reason why Appayya Dikshitp resolved to restore the glory of Lord Shiva.  

  
There is also a possibility that Appaya Dikshita was wounded by Shri Madvacharya's trying to prove the superiority of Vishnu over Shiva, on the strength of Brahmatarka. So Appayya Dikshita also could have tried to prove the superiority of Shiva over Vishnu on the strength of Brahmatarka. Where and how Shri Madhvacharya and Appayya Dikshita read the text of Bramha tarka is anybody's guess. There may be scholars in this list who may have more details on these.  
  

Regards,
