This thread has gone through too many twists and turns getting into lanes and bylanes of history, oral and textual, perhaps not knowing how to come out of it! I don't have a ready made answer either, but like to present a few points regarding the original query and the Sanskrit Introduction attached by Prof. Deshpande. Taking Venkatadhwari (1590-1660 CE) to be the grandson of the famous Appayya Deekshita (1520-1593 CE) is a mistake. The former is of Aatreya Gotra whereas the latter is a Bhaaradwaaja. This was pointed out by Krishnamacharya in his History of Classical Skt.Lit (MLBD, 1932,..several reprints). Please see attachment. Such misunderstanding could be attributed to several factors, but over dependence on oral transmission of history and subsequent spread over large tracts of land seems to be the primary factor. Not only the Lakshmisahasram, but another text from Bombay seems to have the same mistake as per the footnote in the attached text.
