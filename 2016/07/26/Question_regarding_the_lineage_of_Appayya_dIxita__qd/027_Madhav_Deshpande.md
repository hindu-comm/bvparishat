There was no trace of Mādhva Vaiṣṇavism in my family when I was growing up in Pune, and it may have to do with my grand-father's marriage, as well as migration to Pune from our ancestral town called Temburni, near Solapur. Evidently, there was a Mādhva Paṭḥaśālā in the same building where my grand-father's family lived, and one of the stories of those old days was that in the Marathi usage of the Mādhva families, in stead of using the Marathi verb "Shiv" for sewing, they would use the alternative expression dorā ghālaṇe "to put through the thread." I cannot vouch for the accuracy of these reported stories, and, when I was growing up, there was no trace of Mādhva Vaiṣnavism in the family. On one occasion, some Mādhva Ācārya was visiting Pune during my childhood, and my father wanted to go in for Darshan. But he was told that he would have to either show that he had a Tapta Mudra, or would have to get one, before he could go in for Darshan. Again, these are hearsay stories for me, and I cannot vouch for their accuracy.
