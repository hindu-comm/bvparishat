What we can say , as academicians, is that the content of such oral narratives need not necessarily be justifiably right. But for the fact that such narratives existed , theirlisteners like you are the evidence enough.

  

Why such narrow views of a tradition which does not in fact have such views existed in a family like that of your grand parents?

  

The following hypothesis could be proposed :

Maharashtra is a region to which Maadhva tradition spread from Karnataka. Migrant minority cultures sometimestend to be hyperconservative in the areas of their migration out ofa paranoidfear of dilution under the domination of themajority 'other'.
