Dear friends,  
  

Many of the so-called evils are yet to get the due attention of the Sanskrit scholars. For example, many scholars still vouch for the absurd Chaturyuga scale of 4,320,000 years, in spite of Manu's telling us that the Chaturyuga is of 12,000 years. The Sanskrit word "Bhagana" of the Suryasiddhanta and the Aryabhatiya has been misinterpreted to arrive at the Chaturyuga scale of 4.320,000 years. Confusion on the span of the individual yugas within the Chaturyuga is also still prevailing.
Because of this, many people consider Lord Rama as a mythical person and not historical. In the "California 6th Grade History Text-book Controversy", the ridiculous Chaturyuga scale of 4.320,000 years, was put forward, by one Hindu party from USA itself and any suggestion to rectify that was totally ignored.  
  
There are several such issues waiting for the serious attention of the scholars and I hope the scholars will not treat these as trivial issues. Somebody has recently used the word "factoids" to belittle one similar issue, which helped the colonial historians to derail the ancient Indian chronology. This is regarding the proposal of Sir William Jones that Chandragupta Maurya (and not Chandragupta of the Gupta dynasty) was the Sandrocottus of the 4th century BCE.
