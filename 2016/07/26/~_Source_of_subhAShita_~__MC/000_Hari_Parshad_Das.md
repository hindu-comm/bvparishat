dear vidvaj-janas,  
  
my pranams.  
  
I am looking for the source of the following सुभाषित which glorifies translated poetry:  
  
ताम्बूलं दयिताधरे प्रकुरुते रंगप्रकर्षं यदा  
हृत्वा तत्परिचुम्ब्य हर्षितमना ओष्ठे निजे वल्लभः  
चर्वन् स्वाननसंपुटे वितनुते तुल्यां रुचिं सोऽश्नुते  
यं मोदं लभते तमेव रसिको भाषान्तरास्वादकः  
  
**Translation**: When the betel has sufficiently reddened the beloved's lower-lip, the lover takes it away from her mouth by kissing her with a mind full of great joy. He then chews on that chewed betel to bring an exact same \[reddish\] color to his mouth. The joy which is experienced by the lover \[in this entire process\] is also experienced by the connoisseur who enjoys translating a poetry \[from its original language to a language that he likes\].  
  
sādhu-caraṇa-rajo 'bhilāṣī,  
  
hari parshad das.
