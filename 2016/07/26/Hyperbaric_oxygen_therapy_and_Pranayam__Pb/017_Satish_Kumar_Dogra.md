Shri Siva Senani Nori,  

 When I was DIG of Tanjavur way back in late 1990s, I was invited for a school function in a small village near Miyladuthurai. There the 76-year old yoga-teacher of the school (who looked like a man in his fifties) gave a demonstration of pranayam which at that I thought was wrong, but now the encounter with HBOT brings back to my mind. He literally pumped in air into his lungs, perhaps creating an over-supply of oxygen as well as some pressure. After this he breathed deep and held the breath. This is exactly what the HBOT people seem to be doing. They give an excess of oxygen and then bring the quantity down and this seems to provoke the generation of omnipotent stem cells.  
  

So, there does seem to be something that needs to be tried and explored.  
  

Regards,  

Dogra
