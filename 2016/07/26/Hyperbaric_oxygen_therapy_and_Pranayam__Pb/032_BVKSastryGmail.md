Dear Shri Shastri,

 Thanks for your elaborate discussion. I believe all of us must discuss things threadbare and share knowledge as well as experience to arrive at useful techniques that might benefit us and the society.

I have developed a certain practice that simulates the HBOT and gives good benefits to the body and the brain. It improves mental and physical agility, and seems to sharpen the memory.

^^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry – ( On Practice Developed )** : The evaluation of practical benefit of practice is the domain of medical experts. If you share the theory part, and make some pointers to the source authenticity for your ‘practice ideology’, one may look in to texts and trace a reference.



--------------------

I have been looking for Sanskrit texts that might describe different types of pranayama techniques, so that I might sharpen and fine-tune my technique. That was the purpose of my post. Since this is a Forum with great scholars, I thought someone might come up with some text that describes a pranayama similar to what I practice.

^^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry – ( On Pranayama in Sanskrit Texts )** : The guidance for Pranayama do come up in many works of Yoga, Tantra, Aagama, Ayurveda and Upanishads. All are built on specific understanding of ‘Prana’. The concept of ‘Prana’ is alien to modern medicine. PRanayama is not just breath regulation. The need is to deliberate on basics and practice –benefits, which are of practical design nature , fall outside of a
public forum debate and public domain discourse. Off forum private and personal discussion is what is called ‘Anu-shaasnam’ condition.



--------------------



As for Yog Sutras, I take it as a treatise on the flow of electric impulses through the neurons and, more particularly, the bunches of neurons called chakras. I have benefited tremendously from the practices in the Yog Sutras and have fair amount of clarity about these practices.

^^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry – ( On Yoga-Sutra treatise )** : Your view is valid from a particular layered perspective and resolution. There are much more deeper issues. This is neither the beginning or the bottom of the text.



--------------------



Now, my focus is on pranayam. Can a further fine-tuning of the pranayam I practice help derive the type of benefits that Yog Sutras has given --- that is the question that impelled me to put up my post.

^^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry – ( On Pranayama Fine tuning )** : Pranayma can be and has been fine tuned. It is a ‘Custom prescription’ and NOT an off the shelf –early morning TV driven leisurely practice. The Sunday prayer talk in a church is not the same as serious bible scholarship.



--------------------



I believe that a practitioner can re-discover our ancient techniques better than the doctors. The doctors are bound by the theories learnt by them. The practitioner is a free-bird who brings a totally new approach to the issues.

^^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry – ( On rediscovery )** : Yes. Doctors are better equipped and interested in these as t helps them to add one more ‘ prescription for improving the bottom line’. 

Yes, Practitioner is a Free Bird who flies at their own risk, according to ones own ability and will. Birds and Planes have different comfort zones of speeds and flying paths along with their own altitudes.
