There is no biological reason to believe that it works, and there is no published scientific literature on this topic. The fact that these physicians were electing not to publish this is also very suspicious - in general that means they are concerned about the rigors of the scientific review process by their peers. In addition hyperbaric oxygen, kind of like stem cells, are at this time a typical "scam" industry where they advertise to people with conditions that have no cure. I doubt it would cause harm, outside of your wallet and perhaps false hopes. At the end it would be your decision of course.



As per Indian Yoga practice, in praanayama we used to control only breathing process not the intake of oxygen.



Hence was my remark a doctor alone should talk of medical issues As this list has predominantly Sanskrit and Indological scholars. This list might not be right place
