Dear Shri Shastri,  

 Thanks for your elaborate discussion. I believe all of us must discuss things threadbare and share knowledge as well as experience to arrive at useful techniques that might benefit us and the society.  
  

I have developed a certain practice that simulates the HBOT and gives good benefits to the body and the brain. It improves mental and physical agility, and seems to sharpen the memory. I have been looking for Sanskrit texts that might describe different types of pranayama techniques, so that I might sharpen and fine-tune my technique. That was the purpose of my post. Since this is a Forum with great scholars, I thought someone might come up with some text that describes a pranayama similar to what I practice.  
  

As for Yog Sutras, I take it as a treatise on the flow of electric impulses through the neurons and, more particularly, the bunches of neurons called chakras. I have benefited tremendously from the practices in the Yog Sutras and have fair amount of clarity about these practices.  
  

Now, my focus is on pranayam. Can a further fine-tuning of the pranayam I practice help derive the type of benefits that Yog Sutras has given --- that is the question that impelled me to put up my post.  
  

I believe that a practitioner can re-discover our ancient techniques better than the doctors. The doctors are bound by the theories learnt by them. The practitioner is a free-bird who brings a totally new approach to the issues.  
  

Regards,  

Dogra
