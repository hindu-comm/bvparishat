Dear Satishji,

  

You are putting a strange argument. Validation of an experience or a hypothesis

is not achieved by posting it in a scholarly forum. You should write it up fully

as a scholarly paper and post. People who may fathom your description,

might be able to suggest or advise. 

  

Regarding Ram's hypothesis I have the similar opinion. It has to be articulated

completely with its logic and expertly commented upon by people who might

understand the vocabulary.

  

Arbitrary lay comments with wikipaedia as reference simply mock the discipline

in either case.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
