I have seen my closes friend dying believing teaching him Kumbhaka and other advanced pranamaya techniques without his instructor being adequately qualified in such advanced techniques. His advisor was a good Sanskrit scholar and had read a few books but gave him wrong instructions. Its best when you are dealing with your body be with doctors or qualified traditional experts, instead of trying to read a few books and simply start believing them considering one to be the champion of Sanskrit cause and savoir on Indian culture and knowledge. I have nothing more to add than this.



I agree also to the view one persons personal experience cannot be a judge for universal acceptance or make one change his or her view. All views are always welcome
