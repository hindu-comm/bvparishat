Gangeshwari Ji,  

 I think we need to agree to disagree, because we seem to have different ways of approaching issues. While I agree that a qualified doctor is the best person to deal with medical issues, I also know that Maharishi Patanjali most likely did not possess a medical degree. Freud, when he gave his path-breaking discoveries about the Unconscious, was a physician and not a trained psychologist. And Pavlov discovered Conditioning when he was a physiologist working on the production of saliva in response to various types of food.  
  

I shall bow to your command and not discuss issues other than those strictly connected with Sanskrit language and literature. But let me share with you and others that I do believe in straying into other areas. I started as a man of literature, but by now I have learnt enough to produce software. So, here I share with you my Easy Learn Geeta, with a request to popularise it, so that more and more people might benefit from the facility.  
  

I would also be glad if others could join me in capturing data for this and other similar programs for presenting to readers our scriptures in easy format.  
  

Regards,  

Dogra
