Vijaya Ji,  

 Thanks for your views. The idea that building up pressure through pranayam might not be possible came to my mind also. That is why I thought perhaps there are techniques of pranayam that might be able to achieve this. I have been developing my own techniques that perhaps simulate this to some extent. My post was primarily out of a keen desire that perhaps there is someone out there among this group of experts who might be able to quote a certain text and say, "This is what it is !" I have often seen Mr. Subramania Korda, the encyclopedia of Sanskrit, come up with such absolutely-to-the-point quotations from scriptures.  
  

HBOT is certainly more than just experimentation. Concrete results through MRI have been obtained. Since the results achieved tally with the references to a 10000-year life in our scriptures, it tempts me to think that some methods of pranayam, now lost to us, can perhaps give us those techniques.  
  

During the past four decades, my experiments with the techniques in Yog Sutras have produced dramatic results. This gives me the confidence that there is a lot in our scriptures that is now lost to us, but, which once re-discovered, can revolutionise life.  
  

I agree with Gangeshwari Ji that logically a doctor alone should talk of medical issues, but somehow, my experience of past several years shows that, when you pursue something with dedication, you develop a power of intuition that leads you to results. ऋतम्भरा तत्र प्रज्ञा।  
  

Regards,  

Dogra
