100% real practical yoga always remained a secret, being passed on  
from guru to deserving disciples. It cannot be found in scriptures or  
any written works which remain mere pointers or vague references that  
cannot be reconstructed to even closely approximate the real thing.  
So the question of either the west (or the east for that matter)  
laying claim to something from such sources is irrelevant.
