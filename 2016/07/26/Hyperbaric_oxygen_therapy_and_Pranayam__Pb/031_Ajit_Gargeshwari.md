I agree with Arbitrary lay comments with wikipaedia as reference simply mock the discipline

in either case.



Further comments should be posted if there is sufficient data

Dear Satishji,



You are putting a strange argument. Validation of an experience or a hypothesis

is not achieved by posting it in a scholarly forum. You should write it up fully

as a scholarly paper and post. People who may fathom your description,

might be able to suggest or advise. 



Regarding Ram's hypothesis I have the similar opinion. It has to be articulated

completely with its logic and expertly commented upon by people who might

understand the vocabulary.



Arbitrary lay comments with wikipaedia as reference simply mock the discipline

in either case.



Best regards,

Bijoy Misra

Dear Shri Shastri,

 Thanks for your elaborate discussion. I believe all of us must discuss things threadbare and share knowledge as well as experience to arrive at useful techniques that might benefit us and the society.

I have developed a certain practice that simulates the HBOT and gives good benefits to the body and the brain. It improves mental and physical agility, and seems to sharpen the memory. I have been looking for Sanskrit texts that might describe different types of pranayama techniques, so that I might sharpen and fine-tune my technique. That was the purpose of my post. Since this is a Forum with great scholars, I thought someone might come up with some text that describes a pranayama similar to what I practice.

As for Yog Sutras, I take it as a treatise on the flow of electric impulses through the neurons and, more particularly, the bunches of neurons called chakras. I have benefited tremendously from the practices in the Yog Sutras and have fair amount of clarity about these practices.

Now, my focus is on pranayam. Can a further fine-tuning of the pranayam I practice help derive the type of benefits that Yog Sutras has given --- that is the question that impelled me to put up my post.

I believe that a practitioner can re-discover our ancient techniques better than the doctors. The doctors are bound by the theories learnt by them. The practitioner is a free-bird who brings a totally new approach to the issues.

Regards,

Dogra

The source text of Patanajli does not seem to carry even a single word of technical nature to connect with the ‘ Three section breathing / Hyperbaric Oxygen’ – issues’.
