I am not a General and I have no commands to make. Did I ask you to bow down no I did not.

Another note

“Mind you, the Westerner is already converting OUR Pranayam into HIS HBOT technique, and if we do not wake up and re-discover our ancient techniques, we might find ourselves in another Polock-type controversy where we would blame the Westerns for taking our ideas and making them theirs. They shall, if we don't. “

Please don’t write about any scholar in this manner. Please give all the respect they deserve. What do you mean Pollock-type controversy. Has he taken any Indian techniques and made any patented drug I don’t think so. Don’t drag names and individuals when there is no need.



“So, here I share with you my Easy Learn Geeta, with a request to popularise it, so that more and more people might benefit from the facility.

I would also be glad if others could join me in capturing data for this and other similar programs for presenting to readers our scriptures in easy format. “

I hope more and more people join your crusade.
