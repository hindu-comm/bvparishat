Gangeshwari Ji,  

 I think at the end of this dialog, we are both on clearer ground, and I am sure this will be for the good of the Forum. I must thank you for your understanding.  
  

At the bottom of this mail I am giving the link to Easy Learn Geeta.  

  

A few points for the scholars:  
  
While giving meanings, I have tried to break the shlokah into meaningful expressions --- semantic groups, as modern linguists might say. Secondly, I have tried to give word-for-word meanings, so that the reader might be able to match the word and the meaning. This often results in distortion of the syntax, as the English and the Sanskrit syntax do not match. My target is the person who knows Hindi and can easily make a jump to Sanskrit, even if he is not taught much grammar. I wish to popularise Sanskrit by pulling into our circle those who are keen to learn the language but have the initial hesitation.  
  

In the Explanations section on the right I have given some essential grammar and my interpretation of the given shlokah.  
  

I shall be glad to get the feedback and advice of the scholars on the Forum on how to further improve the facility.  
  

Scholars may also contact me on my phone: 9840093148.
