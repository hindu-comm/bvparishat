I agree in principle to what you say now.. There is no question of me being sensitive or insensitive. I expressed my views in the way I know to express. The list or me are not vitiated against any one sharing any information but I may never agree to the information shared and one can express ones disagreement or can debate on the need to share such information. Highlighting controversial use of drugs therapies etc without me or the list by itself being qualified to pass views may be debated. It’s always best to keep away from exaggerated claims made by many on knowledge possessed by our ancients.



With this note we can move further on this and other discussions. Thank you for responding to my posts

Regards

Ajit Gargeshwari
