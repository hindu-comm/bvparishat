Dear Shrivathsaji,  
  

It is not necessary that we agree to everything Ajitji says and I too find that sometimes he had been overstrict, but in the present case I agree with him in the sense that hyperventilation is a very serious thing and the pH of blood may change abnormally causing distress in breathing, and eventually causing heartt problem. Any hyperventilation exercise must be done under expert supervision only and that too for a very limited time.  
  

Regards,
