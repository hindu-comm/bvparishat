Dear Shri Gangeshwari and Vijaya Rani,  


Yesterday when, in response to my post, Shri Gangeshwari Ji reacted by calling it 'advertisement' I took it in all humility as a violation of the rules of this Forum. However, now that I find a wider reaction building to my post, I wish, in complete intellectual honesty, to question this attitude.  
  

To my mind Sanskrit and its study havd value if we are able to dig into the ancient scriptures and find useful techniques for healthy and meaningful living. If I find that a certain technique being used by modern researchers is akin to Pranayam and, if my practice of it gives benefits, and if I would like to know whether people who are well-versed in Sanskrit texts can throw more light on the practice and we could together recapture these techniques for the benefit of the members of this Group and for the benefit of humanity at large, then in what way have I indulged in self-promotion or advertisement?  
  

Does my post in any way give an indication that I have developed a technique that I would like to sell for a price? I have simply asked if there are members on this Forum who are aware of subteties of the techniques of Pranayam, through practice or through study of scriptures, who could associate with me, so that we could together carry the re-discovery of the techniques further.  
  

When Shri Gangeshwari reacted, I remained quiet. But why I am now responding to this is because as a sincere member of this Forum I am keen to know whether this Forum has space for such discussions where we might together build up practical implications of what we find in the scriptures.  
  

Mind you, the Westerner is already converting OUR Pranayam into HIS HBOT technique, and if we do not wake up and re-discover our ancient techniques, we might find ourselves in another Polock-type controversy where we would blame the Westerns for taking our ideas and making them theirs. They shall, if we don't.  
  

This post is written with the utmost sincerity of creating healthy atmosphere of discussion and honest intellectual pursuits.  
  

Regards,  

Dogra
