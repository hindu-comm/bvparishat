Namaste



Here is one primary and basic doubt that haunts such pointers on Yoga-Research !? connecting Yoga - Pranayama and Oxygen ! related research claims ; and quoted as validation for Practices linked to Patanjali Yoga-Sutra 2-49 to 51.



The source text of Patanajli does not seem to carry even a single word of technical nature to connect with the ‘ Three section breathing / Hyperbaric Oxygen’ – issues’. 



1. Patanjali Yoga Sutra 2-49 to 51 speaks of YOGAANGA and within that ‘ Prana –Aayaama’ (Expansion of Prana) for a goal of ‘unmasking the blocking elements to empower the light of consciousness to shine forth (2-52)’. This is the test of successful Pranayama .



2. Pranayama practice carries a Precondition of ‘Aasana’ (posture) which need to deliver a state of ‘ Tranquility of mind’ (2-48 and 2-49 read together : Tasmin dvandava –anabhighate sati).



 The ‘ Pranayama prescribed under the Yogaanga section ( with all its diversity of numbers, length of breath, place .. in 2- 50 ) has a pre and post condition of physicality and mind set and a goal set for practice. It does not carry any reference to Oxygen part of Air! The talk is about the impact of Breath-variations on faculties of Mind in experiencing the ‘ states and shades of consciousness’.



3. Technically ‘Prana’ is NOT just OXYGEN or the gaseous mixture called ‘Air’ ! and ‘ Pranayama –\<shvasa-ucchvasa – nishvasa> is not limited to ‘Breath regulation’ .



 The Concept of ‘ Prana’ is NOT a postulate of Modern medical science . There are no known physical instruments to sense and measure Prana ! Neither \< PRana> is an equivalent of ‘Energy –Consciousness
(Dravya –Chetana> ’ talks in Advanced Physics !



Such being the ‘ oranges and apples’ difference between traditional concept of ‘Prana’ in Yoga / Yogaanga, in contrast to the ‘Harvard
Medical research’ which focuses on ‘Breathing – Lung functionality – lobe and belly filling - numeric variation of breath length –pace, mix
and intensity issues impacting Body and Brain functions, How are we to understand the \< Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy \> as Science validating Yoga ?



Unless I seem to be missing something …. And am I confused over \<Body functionality> to \< breathing – regulation and modulation \> as exclusive measure of \< Prana> and \<Brain functionality> to be mapped to \< Chitta Vrutti>??



I am aware that the ‘ traditional practices of current nature of Pranayama- as seen in schools and studios of Yoga ( Breath regulation in a forced way with multiple postures and mudra –finger locks) aiming to create ‘personal sensation-feel ’ as well as ritual practices ( Pranayama as holding the nose with fingers with a mantra repetition ?!) are seriously distorted practices, failing the standards set by Patanajli for ‘ Pranayama’. This is one standing example of failure to understand the Samkruth word \<Pranayama> in the \<Yoga way> asking the simple one liner: What is Pranayma unifying as breath regulation: What is the Yoga? What s Prana-Yoga ? What is unified with what ? 



A wrong practice does not give enough justification to interpret a source text inaccurately or map research of one domain to another inadvertently.





Thanks in advance for the help.

There is a whole group in Bangaluru <http://vyasa.org/>

They have been active for a long time.

Research on Pranayama or medical benefits can be referred to them.

They did a Conf in association with Harvard Medical School last month.

They would be deeply interested in the findings as reported.

hariH OM,

 About the issue of moderatorship, things were clarified a few months ago. As far as I remember, Mr. Ajit isn't a moderator.

 I also felt that his reaction to Mr. Dogra's post was excessive.

Shri Siva Senani Nori,

 When I was DIG of Tanjavur way back in late 1990s, I was invited for a school function in a small village near Miyladuthurai. There the 76-year old yoga-teacher of the school (who looked like a man in his fifties) gave a demonstration of pranayam which at that I thought was wrong, but now the encounter with HBOT brings back to my mind. He literally pumped in air into his lungs, perhaps creating an over-supply of oxygen as well as some pressure. After this he breathed deep and held the breath. This is exactly what the HBOT people seem to be doing. They give an excess of oxygen and then bring the quantity down and this seems to provoke the generation of omnipotent stem cells.

So, there does seem to be something that needs to be tried and explored.

Regards,

Dogra
