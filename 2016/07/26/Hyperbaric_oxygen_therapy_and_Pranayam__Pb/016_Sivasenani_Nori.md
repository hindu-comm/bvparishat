Sir

  

I am thinking aloud here whether "blatant self-promotion" is to be avoided and whether we react the same way when other such posts which could be categorised as "blatant self-promotion". We have scholars posting notices about seminars, books published by their institutions and themselves, events conducted by organizations the scholars are associated with, interviews of their own selves and their articles in media, poetry and so on. Surely, some element of "blatant self-promotion" is involved in all this. So why do we react to only some posts? My observation, open to refinement and correction, is that while we are agreeable to posts of the nature of self-promotion if the information contained is useful or potentially useful to others, we seem to be very concerned about any commercial gain to the poster, book-promotion by authors being the big exception.

  

Even if we take these implict conditions - usefulness of information and commercial gain - the post of Sri Satish Dogra is similar to other posts. The information about Pranayama helping increase the supply of oxygen to cells is indeed useful. Some people do not have faith in Yoga / prANAyAma and a modern scientific application is useful to convince such people. By "some people", I don't necessarily mean those on BVP, but even those known to BVP members; this kind of information is indeed useful for BVP members in discussion with those without faith in Yoga.

  

Secondly, Sri Dogra's invitation to connect might have sounded like a solicitation, but a man of his stature need not resort to these activities for commercial gain. He retired as the Director General of Police in Tamil Nadu. Of course, this fact might not be known to you and you might have reacted generally. And, I do agree that this kind of language is often used by conmen nowadays.

  

Still my submission is that, since we will inevitably err sometime or the other, let us make an effort to err on the side of caution.

  

To the Parishat in general, I have a couple of submissions to ponder over:

  

1\. Is Sri Ajit Gargeshwari the moderator of the List or is he only advising other members as a member? When I checked BVP page of Google Groups (<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bvparishat>) there is only an email ID corresponding to a moderator.

2\. Assuming he is a member of the Moderator Group, is this a fit case for "spurious belief"? Consider:

  

Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) involves breathing 100% pure oxygen (the atmospheric air contains about 21% ) effectively increasing the supply of oxygen to lung, and thereby to every cell of the body (as blood reaches every cell, and blood carries oxygen to the cells). In prANAyAma, a similar efffect is produced differently. Typically the lungs of an average adult can hold 6 liters of air. In each breath, we recycle about half-a-liter - this is called "tidal volume". Now, prANAyAma increases the tidal volume, i.e helps us take deeper breathes. How much is this increase? I have not seen systematic studies measuring this, but say it increases to 1 liter to 1.5 liters - as there are so many varities of prANAyAma. So in effect, the supply of oxygen is doubled or tripled, whereas HBOT would theoretically qunitiple the supply of oxygen. Then broadly speaking, two or two and a half hours of prANAyAma may equal one hour of HBOT, without the fancy equipment that HBOT requires, and with an additional advantage of having been tried, tested and proven safe over centuries.

  

I do hope that the Bharatiya Vidvat Parishad treats learned scholars and individuals who have contributed significantly to society considerately.

  

Regards

N. Siva Senani
