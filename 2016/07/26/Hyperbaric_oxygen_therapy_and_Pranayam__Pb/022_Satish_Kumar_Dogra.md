Keeping my personal post out of the picture, I would like to say it as a general remark that we should not be sensitive to 'personal promotion', unless it is done with a crass commercial motive.  
  

Does posting one's interview or a link to one's article amount to personal promotion? I don't think so. What is it that such a person is seeking to achieve through such effort? Is he expecting to get business or some other pecuniary benefits? I don't think so.  
  

Links are often given with the good inention of sharing one's work with the members of the BVParishad family. Even when such a link carries a tinge of "Look, I have done something big !" it is with the sense of pride among one's family-members, and not with the haughty feeling of showing others down.  
  

When I saw Shri Nityanand Misra Ji's interview on Vaartavali, my respect for him increased severalfold. Look, here is a man doing a big job and also a devotee of Sanskrit, I said to myself. Yesterday I interacted with a doctor who is a great devotee of Sanskrit. That makes me proud of Sanskrit. It gives me the good feeling that Sanskrit has in its fold persons of achievement in various fields.  
  

I say all this, so that the Forum does not get vitiated against sharing one's achievements. When someone shares his or her achievements, we should feel proud, as he or she is a member of the BVParishad family.  
  

As I said, an exception should be made of crass commercial promotion --- but has such promotion been witnessed on this Forum in the past? Not that I know.  
  

Regards,
