I am sorry to say this,Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy, apart from its usefulness in treatment for decompression (among divers) and an increase in mobilization of stem cells, is a questionable science at best (at least as far as it being a panacea).

  

Regarding the statement made by Dogra ji, "The hyperbaric oxygen technique seems to be a modern version of pranayam", it is incorrect and not very helpful. First of all, HBOT involves nearly three times the ambient atmospheric pressures (i.e. 3 atm = 3\*10^6 Pa). Human lungs can barely generate a pressure differential of 10 - 15 kPa. That is a couple of orders of magnitudes of difference. So, no amount of pranayam/yoga is going to make up for that.

  

And lastly, as an aside, for anybody interested, prANa is actually exhalation and apAna is inhalation. So, despite us calling oxygen the prANa-vAyu, it should technically be called apAna-vayu, as it is apAna that is rich in oxygen and prANa is rich in carbon dioxide. The reason we call (or associate) prANa to be the breath of life is because we can check if a person is alive by sensing one's exhalation (i.e. prANa).
