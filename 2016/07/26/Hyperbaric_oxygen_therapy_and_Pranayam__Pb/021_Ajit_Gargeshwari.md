I never said Pranayama is not beneficial and is not a science it is an exact science and researches conducted by SVYASA and other organisation are high quality research. My serious doubts and objection are towards Hyperbaric Oxygen therapy. I did provide all the possible links I could get from the google . Experts in various forums have clearly said there are no published works on the befits of Pranayama in the context Hyper Oxygen therapy. I hope all agree as there scholars in this list Prana does not mean air we breathe and pranayama does not mean breathing exercises. Similarly Yoga does not mean physical exercises in isolation.
A person whatever his capacity he might be in or might have served may at times get misled. Its best to leave treatments to doctors. A doctor can be Aurvedic, Yoaga specialists traditional therapists etc. Even they are doctors. I donâ€™t understand why we often get edgy and propose doubtful or unproven methods and keep saying again and again our Vedas say that or our sages said that. Enormous progress were achieved by ancient Indian in all fields including yoga and pranayama no one doubts that nor do I.
