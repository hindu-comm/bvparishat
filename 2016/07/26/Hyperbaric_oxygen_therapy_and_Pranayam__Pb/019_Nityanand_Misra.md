This mapping (*prāṇa*=exhalation and*apāna*=inhalation) makes sense only in specific contexts like that of BG 5.27 (*prāṇāpānau samau ktvā ...*). In the general, larger context of five *prāṇa*-s (vital forces), *prāṇa* is the vital force in the heart, *apāna* in the *gudā* (rectum), *samāna* in the *nābhi* (navel), *udāna* in the throat, and *vyāna* in the whole body. When Dogra Ji mentioned that *prāṇāyāma* increases *prāṇāvāyu*, he may have had the general context in mind. I do not think he meant oxygen by*prāṇa* (I may be corrected if he did).

  

In addition, disagreeing with Ajit Ji and Vijaya Krishna Rani Ji, I do not see any self-promotion in the original post. IMHO, asking like minded people to connect over an area of interest does not amount to self-promotion.
