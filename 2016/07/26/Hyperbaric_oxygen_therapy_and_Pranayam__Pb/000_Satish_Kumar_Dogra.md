Dear friends,  

 Modern researches show that an increased supply of blood to the body cells results in rejuvenation of damaged body cells and consequent recovery from serious diseases. This process is different from slower-aging: it is reversal of the aging process.  
  

The hyperbaric oxygen technique seems to be a modern version of pranayam. The practice of pranayam increases the 'prana-vayu' in the body. It, thus, produces the effects that are now sought to be produced by HBOT (Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy). This technique stimulates the production of omnipotent stem cells in the part of the body where the tissue is damaged. These stems cells in the presence of increased supply of oxygen repair the damaged tissue by producing healthy cells.  
  

As it is, my exercise routine has for many years now integrated principles of pranayam with aerobic exercises. But now I am trying to re-discover pranayamic techniques that would give the benefits of HBOT. I would be glad to associate with others who might be working on similar techniques. My mobile number is: 9840093148.  
  

Regards,  

Dogra
