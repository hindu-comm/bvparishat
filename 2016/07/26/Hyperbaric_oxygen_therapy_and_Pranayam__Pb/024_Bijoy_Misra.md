The principal criticism in the west against the modern Indian scholars has been that

they do not fully analyze before expressing. By discarding the Indian scholars,

then the westerns make their own more nonsensical interpretation.

To create "knowledge" out of "experience": is the key.  SriKrishna said

several thousand years ago. The process of "discovery" in India has

been claimed as "intuitive" which to my mind is a label created by the west.

Everything that has come down as knowledge is expected to have centuries of

empirical experimentation which need be re-simulated. Of course it is hard!
