Respected Vinod ji,

  

Thanks for the excellent comments and further elaboration.

  

**\[1\] Vimal**: They all were in*potential*form because the unmanifested state of Brahman (the primal entity) had latent physical and latent mental aspect. It took over 13.72 billion years to realize them in us. This is the reason, top-down God theory approach is untenable unfortunately. God was introduced later in*Vedas, Vedānta*, and*Sāṃkhya*‘by hand’ for law and order in society and to avoid fear of death and suffering due to death of loving family members and friends (see *[Garuda Purāna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garuda_Purana)*), but unfortunately it misled us to follow untenable problematic path based on top-down God theory.



**Sehgal**:As per eDAM, functional aspect of consciousness comprises of various mental functions viz.,memory, emotions, attention etc etc. Now one emotion say love is a quite individualized subjective issue and connectedwith some inanimate or animate object in environment. Now 7.5 billion people in world may havetrillions of experiences of love with each having that experience millions of times in one's life. What is the meaning that all these emotions were latent mental aspectin unmanifested primal entity? Otherwise, what is the meaning of latent mental aspect? Query raised by me pertained to meaning of functionalmental aspect and relevance of same to be in unmanifestedlatent form in primal entity some 13.72 billion years ago before BB and it has nothing to do with Top-down or bottom-up God.



**Vimal**: There are over 40 meanings assigned to term ‘consciousness’ by various authors, which were categorized in two groups: functional and experiential sub-aspects. Emotional experiences, such as feeling of different kinds of love [(Vimal, 2011d)](http://sites.google.com/site/rlpvimal/Home/2011-Vimal-Love-and-eDAM-LVCR-4-4.pdf), are the experiential sub-aspect of consciousness.



In the bottom-up eDAM approach, the mental aspect of unmanifested state of Brahman is assumed to consist of Universal/cosmic potential Consciousness (UpC). Innumerable subjective experiences are excitations of UpC, in analogy to innumerable ripples in an ocean.



Perhaps, during BB/‘cosmic-fire’ (science/*B**ṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣat*), initially (t=0) there was a dual-aspect unified field at BB-ground-state; at this state, all four fundamental forces (gravitational, electromagnetic, weak and strong forces) were unified (as per science). One could argue based on quantum mechanics that the eigen(or basis)-states of these 4 possible forces were superposed as a BB-state of unified field in its physical aspect.



In the eDAM, a state of an entity (including unified field) is a dual-aspect entity with *inseparable* mental and physical aspects. The physical aspect of the BB-state related to unified field was disintegrated into the four eigen-states related to 4 fundamental forces. Further story of the physical aspect, such formation of galaxies, stars, planets, and related moons, and so on is elaborated in the evolution of universe in (Vimal, 2012a).



Similarly, we argue that the eigen(basis)-states of all mental entities such as experiences were also [quantum superposed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition) in the mental aspect (UpC) of a state of unified field. As elaborated above, the excitations of the physical aspect of a BB-state of unified field led to disintegration of unified field into 4 major forces. Since aspects are *inseparable* in the eDAM, there were excitations in UpC in its mental aspect due to BB/‘cosmic fire’, which led to the quantization of UpC into innumerable experiences. The eigen(basis)-states of these experiences were superposed into the mental aspect of a state of each entity. This is the mechanism to carry all experiences as quantum-superposed form in the mental aspect of each entity state for over 10 billion years. This is the most economical way to carry them without any expenditure of physical energy. After over 10 billion years when mental aspect started manifesting, and eventually when NNs of experiences such as love were formed in us, various love related experiences were realized appropriately. For further detail see [(Vimal, 2010c)](http://sites.google.com/site/rlpvimal/Home/2013-Vimal-Matching-Selection-LVCR-3-1.pdf).



The functional aspect of consciousness, such as thoughts, memory, attention, and so on are the mental aspect of states of brain-mind system, which locally arise in brain. The self is subjective experience (SE) of subject and the perception of objects that are SEs of objects are the experiential aspect of consciousness and their mechanisms are elaborate above. **

  
**\[2\] Vimal**: As discussed before, in the eDAM, the categorization is based on perspectives: the 1pp-mental aspect is from first person perspective and is private. The 3pp is for public. The causal and astral bodies are part of the functional sub-aspect of consciousness and conscious subjective experiences and experiencer (self) are experiential sub-aspect of consciousness. All have neural-basis. All are from 1pp and are private. Therefore, grouping them in mental aspect is justified.*Sāṃkhya*’s categorization is based on top-down God theory and has no scientific basis: what if there is no*Puruṣa*, then the experiencer (self) is also part of*Prakṛti*. In that case, *Sāṃkhya*would be simply materialism/*Cārvāka/Lokāyata*system. The 1pp and 3pp are further elaborated in my new article[(Vimal, 2016b)](http://sites.google.com/site/rlpvimal/Home/2016-Vimal-eDAM-Metaphysics-LVCR-8-2.pdf), where I have acknowledged your effort for the information related to*Sāṃkhya.*



**Sehgal:**Let me rephrase my query once again in the language of eDAM for your easy grasp. Experiential aspect of consciousness comprises of subjective experiences andconscious subjective self. Functional aspect of consciousness comprises ofastral and causal bodies, as you state. Now all thoughts are produced in functional aspects. Such thoughts are fragmented, take birth and die continuously.



But conscious self is an integrated whole, a composite one. My query was how are you placing these two different entities under same category. when one (functional aspect) has distinct, discrete category while other (conscious self) has composite category.



Further you have stated that both the aspects are neural based. When as per eDAM, you consider both aspects of consciousness (experiential +functional) as manifested from one unmanifested primal entity, how neural networks have come in picture? What I mean to say when before BB itself, both aspects existed in primal entity, how can we say that these aspects are dependent upon neural networks for their existence.



Kindly keep in mind that between 3pp (brain) and 1pp (SE), there is one more reality also. That is of functional aspects viz., thoughts. Conscious self does not sense outside stimulus directly from 3pp but it senses the thought which are generated as part of functional aspects.



**Vimal**: Both functional and experiential (experiences of subject (self) and objects) sub-aspects of consciousness are from 1pp and are private; therefore, it is justified to put them in one category. One can further categorize them based on distinct 3pp-NN. There is no scientific subjective or objective evidence for the separate conscious self (*Puru**ṣa*). The eDAM is evidence based bottom-up metaphysics, which is similar to science. The term ‘composite’ is less popular. It is better to use ‘unified’ conscious experiences, which are because of binding of micro-experiences as elaborated in [(Vimal, 2010c)](http://sites.google.com/site/rlpvimal/Home/2013-Vimal-Matching-Selection-LVCR-3-1.pdf).



There are many necessary conditions for consciousness as elaborated in [(Vimal, 2015f)](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.1.1587.9124). Consciousness needs to have infrastructure such as the formation of NNs before it can be realized.



*Sāṃkhya*’s categorization of entities into *Puru**ṣa* and *Prak**ṛti *is based on the experiences in controversial *Samādhi* state subjective knowledge in mental space-time. The eDAM’s categorization is based on robust reproducible scientific 1pp and 3pp empirical data in physical space-time.





**\[3\] Sehgal**: One more issue, the eDAM postulatesthe dichotomy of consciousness into two parts:

i) Experiential aspect i.e. subjective self which experiences the stimulus or cognition, and

ii\) Functional aspect: Astral body+causal body, various thoughts, emotions, memory, attention, judgement etc.



Above postulations of eDAMcan lead to two issues:

i\) Composite consciousness is being split into two parts -- composite self as well asdiscrete thoughts. This splitting itself will lead tolosing of composite character of consciousness, and

ii) It is our subjective experience that our self is the perceiver (having subjective experience) of different thoughts.



One more clarification regarding eDAM. The eDAM considers astral bodies and causal bodies as functional aspects of consciousness. Clarification sought is: Does eDAM considers astral+causal body as same as thoughts or these are the instruments (some base) on which thoughts are produced?



Let me clarify once again the positionfrom the point of view of Sāṃkhya.



Astral and Causal bodies are neither thoughts nor a functional output of consciousness. Astral and causal bodies are transformed entities of Muula Prakriti. In other words, astral and causal bodies are the transformed outputs of physicality aspect, as you state remains latent in primal entity. Thoughts are producedby the instruments of astral and causal bodies when output from brain (3pp) is received from brain or from memory, as stored in these bodies.



**Vimal**: There is no such problem in the eDAM. The unification of micro-experiences into a unified experience in space is done by binding process as elaborated in Section 3.10 of [(Vimal, 2010c)](http://sites.google.com/site/rlpvimal/Home/2013-Vimal-Matching-Selection-LVCR-3-1.pdf). Self will experience different thoughts at different time. Continuity of self over life-time is through remembering our personal past [(Bluck & Liao, 2013)](http://www.psych.ufl.edu/lifestorylab/pdf/bluck.liao.self-cont.2013.pdf).



**\[4\] Vimal**: What if there is no*Puruṣa*, then the experiencer (self) is also part of*Prakṛti*. In that case, *Sāṃkhya*would be simply materialism/*Cārvāka/Lokāyata*system. The 1pp and 3pp are further elaborated in my new article[(Vimal, 2016b)](http://sites.google.com/site/rlpvimal/Home/2016-Vimal-eDAM-Metaphysics-LVCR-8-2.pdf).



**Sehgal**: How will there will no Purusha and self becoming a part of Prakriti? Purusha is more fundamental than Prakriti. It is the Brahman (cosmic consciousness) which assumes the role of Purusha and Self. It is changeless, no transformation, immutable, no birth/death. On the other hand, Prakriti undergoes transformations, changes and mutable. Outputs of Prakriti undergo continuouschanges/birth/death.



**Vimal**: Independently existing *Puru**ṣa* and *Prak**ṛti* is *Sā**ṃkhya*’s assumption based on controversial *Samādhi* state subjective knowledge in mental space-time, which is taken for granted and has serious subjective biases. For example, if you and I attain *nirvikalpa* *Samādhi* thru our frameworks (you follow *Sā**ṃkhya* and I follow *Dvi-Pak**ṣa Advaita*), whatever we will subjectively experience, you will interpret it in terms of *Sā**ṃkhya* and I will interpret it in *Dvi-Pak**ṣa Advaita*. This has happened before (such as atheist Buddhism/Jainism vs. theist *Vedānta*), and there is no reason that it will not happen in future. Thus, we will NEVER agree and hence *Samādhi* state subjective knowledge is controversial. Only final judge is the empirical evidence, such as the experiment I proposed in Section 3.2 of [(Vimal, 2015g)](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.1.1974.3445) for testing the inseparability vs. separability hypothesis.



**\[5\] Vimal**: Primal entity (*Brahman*) is not an aggregate or derived entity; it is the fundamental entity in the eDAM.*Brahman*has innumerable states; each state has*inseparable*mental and physical aspects. The degrees of manifestations of aspects vary with the entity-states. In its unmanifested state, both aspects are latent (in potential form).



**Sehgal**: My query was if Primal entity= Mental Aspect + Physical Aspect onlyOR Primal entity= Mental Aspect + Physical Aspect+ Something more. If it is something more, what is that? I think, I have now made my query abundantly clear.



**Vimal**: I do not see any need for ‘Something more’; therefore, the eDAM follows first option, as elaborated above.



**\[6\] Sehgal**: iv) With creation, unmanifested primal entity starts manifesting physical and mental aspects. Is total primal entity manifest in physical and mental aspects or some unmanifested primal entity remain as such in unmanifested form?



**Vimal**: This is an excellent query. Further researches are needed to precisely address this query. My current view in simplified form is that first physical aspect started manifesting after Big Bang (BB). Then after over 10 billion years, mental aspect started manifesting for living entities. Both aspects are almost fully manifested in us in wakeful conscious states. The details are unclear. Since aspects are*inseparable*, whatever goes in one aspect must be reflected immediately appropriately in other aspect. Then one could ask, what was going on in the mental aspect over 10 billion years after BB? The changes in physical aspect should have been reflected in the mental aspect as well, but it appears latent to us as in all inert entities. To know precisely the 1pp-mental aspect of an entity we need to be that entity because it is private. It is not possible for me to know your 1pp-mental aspect, such as your thoughts, your experiences etc. Then, how can we know precisely the mental aspect of entities over 10 billion years when we were not even present; we can only guess based on model predictions. From 3pp, it all appears latent to us. Thus, it needs further researches.  
  

**Sehgal**:****I appreciate that you have candidlyadmitted that as ondate eDAM has no answer to the query I asked. Inseparability of physical and mental is the crux of framework. As you, have stated in at many places that physical and mental aspects co-exist, co-manifest and co-evolve from unmanifested primal entity. It implies manifestation of physical aspect from primal entity should have corresponding manifestation of mental aspect also. You have agreed to this but argued that for first 10 billion years from BB, such manifestation was in inert bodies. Now for the sake of arguments and to preserve the inseparability, you have stated that inert bodies say a stone should also have 1pp i.e. subjective experience but since 1pp is quite private, they are unknown to us. In other words, a stone also has thoughts and have subjective experience, like us, but we are unable to know that due to 1pp being quite personal. Your above inference of eDAM can cause a revolutionary breeze (if not the storm), if appreciated by scientific community. But this idea is as crazy as Everett’s MWI of QM.



**Vimal**: I think you have misconstrued what I wanted to say. As per eDAM, inert entities do not have consciousness/experiences as we do because they do not satisfy the necessary conditions of consciousness. The *necessary* *condition*s for *access* (reportable) consciousness are: formation of neural-networks, wakefulness, reentry, attention, information integration, working memory, stimulus contrast at or above threshold, and potential experiences embedded in neural-network. Attention is not necessary for *phenomenal* (non-reportable) consciousness (Vimal, 2014) and [(Vimal, 2015f)](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.1.1587.9124). We, at conscious state, satisfy these conditions. If we make conscious robots and if they satisfy these conditions, then they may have robotic-type consciousness.



What I want to say is that there were lots of changes went on the physical aspect over 10 billion years, those changes should also be reflected in the mental aspect to some extent as per inseparability of aspects; we do not know what that might be. We can only guess as elaborated above in response \[1\].



**\[7\] Sehgal**: For sake of arguments one can come with any sort of ideas (Mind has that much capacity). Now let me contribute on this issue.

i\) Before this physical world comes into existence, Causal + Astral world with astral biologies alreadydevelops fully and remains in position.

ii\) It is the cosmic consciousness which assumes the role of “subjective Self" in Causal body.

iii\) For any subjective experience, stimulus should enter Astral body via brain (3pp) from environment. For cognitive thoughts, stimulus comes from memory or imagination from causal body.

iv\) Subjective experience by Self takes place only if

a) In case of perception, stimuli have entered Astral body via brain

b) In case of cognition, stimuli have entered astral bodymemory or imagination or(memory+imagination), both functions of causal body.



**Vimal**: It is unclear how biology was in place before BB. We need infra-structure such as NN of brain before we can have astral and causal bodies, i.e., *Sā**ṃkhya*’s mind and it must satisfy the necessary conditions of consciousness as elaborated in \[1\]. *Puruṣa* needs brain (*Prak**ṛti*) to experience; he is just *Sākshi* and powerless; if God is OOO, then He should have ability to stop the wars going on today.



**\[8\] Sehgal**: Inert entities like a stone have no causal body, no astral body, therefore, NO SELF. No memory, No imagination in absence of causal body. No brain, therefore, no stimuli from environment. In view of above, inert bodies have no subjective experience (1pp).



**Vimal**: Yes, I agree. This is similar argument as I wrote above in \[6\] related to not satisfying the necessary condition of consciousness.



**\[9\] Vimal**: As per[(Vimal, 2013)](http://sites.google.com/site/rlpvimal/Home/2012-Vimal-Emergence-UMBW-CUP.pdf), “The evolution of universe in the eDAM framework(Vimal, 2008b, 2010c)is the co-evolution of the physical and mental aspect of the state of universe starting**from**the physical and mental aspect of the state of quantum empty-space at Big-Bang**to**finally the physical and mental aspect of the states of brain-mind over 13.72 billion years. It can be summarized as: ‘**\[**Dual-aspect fundamental primal entity (such as unmanifested state of*Brahman*,*sunyatā*, quantum empty-space/void at the ground state of quantum field with minimum energy, or Implicate Order: same entity with different names)**\]****→****\[**Quantum fluctuation in the physical/mental aspect of the unmanifested state of primal entity**\]**→ Big Bang →**\[***Very early dual-aspect universe*(Planck epoch, Grand unification epoch, Electroweak epoch (Inflationary epoch and Baryogenesis)): dual-aspect universe with dual-aspect (unified field → four-fundamental forces/fields: gravity as curvature of space, electromagnetic, weak and strong) via inflation in dual-aspect space-time continuum**\]**→**\[***Early dual-aspect universe*(Supersymmetry breaking, Quark epoch, Hadron epoch, Lepton epoch, Photon epoch (Nucleosynthesis, Matter domination, Recombination, Dark ages)): Dual-aspect ‘fundamental forces/fields, elementary particles (fermions and bosons), & antiparticles (anti-fermions)’ in dual-aspect space-time continuum**\]**→**\[***Dual-aspect Structure formation*(Reionization, Formation of stars, Formation of galaxies, Formation of groups, clusters and superclusters, Formation of our solar system, Today’s universe): Dual-aspect ‘matter (fermions and composites, galaxies, stars, planets, earth, and so on), bosons, and fields’ and dual-aspect ‘life and brain-states (experiential and functional consciousness including thoughts and other cognition as the mental aspect (Vimal 2009b, 2010d), and NNs and electrochemical activities as the physical aspect) in dual-aspect space-time continuum**\]**→**\[***Ultimate fate of the dual-aspect universe*: Big freeze, Big Crunch, Big Rip, Vacuum metastability event, and Heat death OR dual-aspect Flat Universe(Krauss, 2012)**\]**. In the eDAM framework, the dual-aspect unified field has the*inseparable*mental and physical aspects, which co-evolved and co-developed eventually over 13.72 billion years(Krauss, 2012)to our mental and physical aspects of brain-state. The mental aspect was latent until life appeared; then its degrees of dominance increased from inert matter to plant to animal to human; for awake, conscious, active humans, both aspects are equally dominant; for inert entities, the mental aspect is latent and physical aspect is dominant’(Vimal, 2012b).”  
  

**Sehgal**: Creation of quantum cosmologists starts with a quantum vacuum with some zerostate energy and then they postulate that some zero state energy remains within that vacuum. All the physicality of universe remains embedded in zero state energy of quantum vacuum. Quantum cosmologists further postulate that some quantum fluctuation triggered the creation which led to Big Bang and so on. But above model of cosmologists fails to explain the emergence of consciousness, self and subjective experiences from matter since this postulates only physicality in quantum vacuum.



**Vimal**: That is why we need the eDAM as a complementary.



**Sehgal**: What eDAM has added to quantum vacuum? It has added mental aspect to quantum vacuum to account for consciousness and mental functions BUT IN UNMANIFESTED FORM; otherwise, the requirement of a conscious God arises. And how scientists can believe the existence of a conscious God since their only tool is empiricalism? Both above versions also believe in some Big Bang. When critically examined, both the above models fail on following account:

i) Both the models can't get rid of space (vacuum), may be of quantum nature &energy, even in Zero state energy but also dependent upon Big Bang for creation. This buildssome internal contradiction. Big Bang postulates the creation of space/time and energy and matter. i.e. before BB, there was no space no energy.

ii\) Both models move parallel in the sense. Some quantum fluctuation, as part of probabilistic chanceor accidently or abruptly triggered creationwhich led to BB. But quantum fluctuations can't onset creation for variety of reasons. 8 such reasons, I had elaborated in my past mail. i need not repeat the same here.

iii\) Now both Quantum cosmologists and eDAM don't believe in any manifested consciousness (God), but creation can't go ahead without knowledge/intelligence. Therefore, both models postulate Laws of Nature which charter the course of creation. But how and from where such laws emerged out? There is no answer to this query with both models. As such, there are left with no option but to presume that laws of nature always existed. But in making this assumption, both models miss one important link viz.: All Laws in any field have implicitlysome encodedmessage of some conscious agent. In other words, consciousness of conscious agent is implicit in the very body of Law. In all the fields with which human beings deal Technology, IT, social, economical, political, no Law can be cited whichhas not come forth from conscious agent and that too in advanced/evolved form. i.e. human beings and not animals or insects.



If it is so, why Laws of Nature which are much more fundamental than Laws as formulated by should conscious human beings should carry the stamp of some macro level conscious entity? But this is not acceptable to quantum cosmologists or proponents of eDAM since they consider requirement of brain as a pre-requisite for knowledge/intelligence/Law. But here also, proponents of both modelmisses some link.



Consciousness (individualized, self) when seated firmly in Astral and causal body, after leaving physical body,no longer remains dependent upon brain for perception and cognition. On the contrary, it becomes more powerful than when it was with physical body.



When Astral and causal bodies are also left, it becomes all powerful and identifies with pre-existing cosmic consciousness. Its power and knowledge can't be even imagined by we individuals who are bounded by brain in the body. What that cosmic consciousness does and how it does? Only HE knows. We are unable to know that with our small brain.



I have tried to paint asmall picture in graphical manner where models of Quantum cosmologists and that of eDAM fails.



Above does not imply that I am persuading any one to resort to model of cosmic consciousness in fully manifested form (God). Everyone has freedom tohave any belief system which appeals to his logic, background, experience. I have equal respect in belief system of others.



**Vimal**: I guess, by two models, you mean materialism and the eDAM. As we discussed before, there are two approaches: TD and BU; both can have problems as elaborated by shri [Aurobind Padiyath](): non-apprehension and mis-apprehension; they are called *avidyā*. Therefore, we should start what we all know as robust reproducible 1pp data 3pp data in our quotidian world and then build a model from these data. This is BU approach and the eDAM follows this path. The chances of *avidyā* in BU approach is certainly less than that in TD God theory approach if we observe the data. As elaborated above Samādhi state knowledge is controversial and hence we cannot rely on this. I have already addressed your 8 arguments against BU approach in previous emails so repeating them again is not needed.

  

Cheers!
