Respected vidwan Aurobind ji,

  

Thanks for very interesting further elaboration.

  

Let us discuss in detail about bottom-up (BU) approach. I have simplified the innumerable states of our mind-brain systems into four: (1) deep-sleep, (2) dream, (3) wakeful conscious, and (4)*samādhi*states. Of course, there are many states in-between and also many in each of them. For your point of view:

What is the difference between *parmātman* (the name of the 4^(th)state) and God?

What are the various sub-states of 4^(th)(*samādhi*) state?

What are the problems of TD (top-down) and BU?

  

Cheers!

  

Kindest regards,

Ram
