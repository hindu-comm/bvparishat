Respected Ram,

I'm not an expert in the neurophysiology or neuropathy. So my approach will be restricted to the scriptures viz Upanishads and Sankaracharya Bhashyams.

There are no four states first of all. The fourth one in your categories, Samadhi, is part of the third  i. e. waking consciousness where one willfully restricts the mental process by reducing from multiple to single and then disolving the specifics of even that single to remain for a duration in that state. This being a willful act it has to be part of waking, like falling into loss of memory, coma, etc.

  

Your Q:What is the difference between parmātman (the name of the 4th state) and God?

  

Ans: Since I've explained what is samadhi above, Paramatman, is not a state of the fourth type as defined by you. Paramatman is Param Atman meaning The Supreme Swaroopa which is encompassing the swaroopa of everything. What is it or defenition of it is विधितात् अविधिदात् अधि। meaning beyond the known and the unknown. It is the very nature or swaroopa of Knowledge. Since it cannot be defined in direct means, the Upanishads use both positive and negative indicators. For example.

  

नान्तःप्रज्ञं नबहिःप्रज्ञं नोभयतःप्रज्ञं नप्रज्ञानघनं नप्रज्ञं नाप्रज्ञम् ।

अदृश्यमव्यवहार्यमग्राह्यमलक्षणमचिन्त्यमव्यपदेश्यमेकात्मप्रत्ययसारं

प्रपञ्चोपशमं शान्तं शिवमद्वैतं चतुर्थं मन्यन्ते स आत्मा स विज्ञेयः ॥ ७ ॥ Mandukya Upanishad 7 verse.

  

It is not that which is conscious of the inner (subjective) world, nor that which is conscious of the outer (objective) world, nor that which is conscious of both, nor that which is a mass of consciousness. It is not simple consciousness nor is It unconsciousness. It is unperceived, unrelated, incomprehensible, uninferable, unthinkable and indescribable. The essence of the Consciousness manifesting as the self in the three states, It is the cessation of all phenomena; It is all peace, all bliss and non—dual. This is what is known as the Fourth (Turiya). This is Atman and this has to be realized.

  

Here the fourth does not mean a fourth state but since it is not any of the three but the substratum for the three and different from it, hence called the fourth.

Here the word Atma and Paramatman are used similar to a drop of water and the water present in all universe.

While the God in (no where similar to the western religious concepts) here is similar to the power of water which is present in the drop and the ocean, where the enormity of both varies. While the quality of both being same the power of executive strength differ. The Jeeva (individual ) creates his dream world the Ishwara is the creator of the Whole. Both Ishwara and Jeeva in essence being the same but differs in power. A tsunami cannot be brought out by a tea cup.

  

Your Q:What are the various sub-states of 4th (samādhi) state?

  

Ans: I'm not an expert in Yogasutra system, but to my little knowledge the four stages are called Sa-beeja, Nir-beeja, Savikalpaka and Nirvikalpaka. You may refer to books of Yogasutra for details. (Incidentally I do not practice it)

  

Your Q:What are the problems of TD (top-down) and BU?

  

Ans: The problems are almost common for both. As I had mentioned in my earlier mail, it is from where you think you are and where to go from there.

Basic issues are two: non-apprehension and mis-apprehension. In the absence of right knowledge and when a sense of experience enters your cognitive state, there is bound to be the mis-apprehension of the input. These two together is called Avidya.

So in the TD approach one presumes that creation has happened and trying to find out the cause effect then, the two above can guide his thoughts and send his investigation to the misguided slot. Where as in BU you start from what is the current state of mine, what am I? Or who am I?
What is the nature of what I'm experiencing, etc. Here there is no hypotheses. You start from the known to find if what is known is truly what they are or are they appearance or is there something hidden beyond the seen etc? I prefer this as I've a workable lab within myself.

  

पराञ्चि खानि व्यतृणत्स्वयम्भूस्तस्मात्पराङ् पश्यति नान्तरात्मन् ।  
कश्चिद्धीरः प्रत्यगात्मानमैक्षदावृत्तचक्षुरमृतत्वमिच्छन् ॥ १ ॥ Katopanishad 2.4.1

The sense organs are created for sensing outerworld not the inner Self,

Some hero sees the inner Self when he turns his vision inward.

  

So the real bottom is not what we consider as tangible but The real bottom of all issues, which are non-apprehension and mis-apprehension.
They are non tangible with our current cognitive apparatus.

Regards
