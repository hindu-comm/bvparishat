I don’t see people have common sense they carry only university degree and ego only people who couldn’t qualify knowledge are intellects, India was only country where knowledge was inferred and qualified to get the right point and a single point of view, and that is how Shri Shankara proved Advaita .

The knowledge of India what everybody calls as hindu or Hinduism as religion is far more beyond everything, it is engineering (tantrajJAna) which is a constructive knowledge but not science, I have been continuously going through the discussion on BVP and also with many intellectuals about the vyakarana, yoga sutra and much more but I couldn’t find any value in any of the discussion as the people’s goal is death.

According to our ancient teaching which I have known from intellects like you, I understood that for any knowledge to manifest it should be in three dimension and that is Action, Mind and Speech, and what is that our Vedas are telling or what our Trimunis wanted us to known is totally unknown, because I could see only Mind and Speech is active and Action is not there.

As I could see the discussion and I could not understand what for the discussion is going, because the purpose of birth is not there if we are born to die then whatever knowledge our ancients have given is not required, and if the purpose of birth is life then it can be discussed as Shri Shankara tells about SADEHA MUKTHI which is important, but we are planning and looking forward for only VIDEHA MUKTHI what a pathetic situation even after knowing so many things.

If we take the birth as process of LIFE is like some playing the game of birth to WIN and if we consider taking birth is for DEATH then the person is playing NOT TO LOSE, and playing to win is Advaita and playing not lose is DaVita in playing to win it is just win, but playing not to lose is too many things it is full of defending and it becomes too complicated.

As the Trimuni’s have simplified knowledge and given to us but we are complicating it because when people have decided that thet are going to die they become irresponsible any how what does it matter, so they are using their fullest strength of Mind for Speech because the action is known as death ultimately, but nobody is willing to give right definition of the vocabularies like what is YOGA and why Yoga sutra is given in four padas and what is the meaning of four padas why the first pada is called Samadhi pada and what is the meaning of Samadhi, we never go into Action to prove it but every one of us is trying to prove in words by finding new glossary words and make common people confused the biggest tragedy of this generation.

Before going to neuro science we need to know about Yoga sutras and all the four padas are practiced and put into action we can achieve SADEHA MUKTHI. But no one wants to manifest the knowledge hence everyone is becoming Brahma rakshasa, because as I have understood from intellects like you that Brahman means Space and knowledge is in the Space and many intellects know and have the knowledge but don’t know how to put in Action and I feel that is the meaning of Brahma rakshasa. Yoga sutra are the finest theory of behaviourism and it is simplified to such an extent that people couldn’t understand them.
