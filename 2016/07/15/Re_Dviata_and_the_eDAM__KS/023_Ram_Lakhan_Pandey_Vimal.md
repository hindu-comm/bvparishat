Respected Vinod ji,

  

Thanks for further elaboration:

  

**\[1\] Sehgal**: I am not a*Sanyānsī*but a family person very much living in world, however, nearing 61 yrs. As such, many of my family responsibilities are on closing end.



I agree with you that in matter of*Saadhnaa*, one should follow the path which suits one'stemperament and background. However, whatever method one may adopt, higher stages of Sadhnaa/Samādhi can't be achieved unless one develops an attitude of detachment for*kama* (Sex) and worldly possessions, two major components of worldly bondage. I think, Rishi Patanjali has mentioned *Brahmacharya and Aparigraha*in this sense Similarly real *Sanyāsa* is not state of body but it is state of detachment for world.



Once true and real detachment is developed, one may live in jungles or palaces, it doesn’t matter much depending upon one's*Pralabdh* \[past karma\]. Without detachment, there is no Sanyāsa even if one eats in a begging bowl.



**Vimal**: I agree that Patanjali’s Astāng yoga requires what you suggested. However, some methods do not require them. Therefore, one should follow the method that suits the best. However, we should be regular in daily practice, which needs significant motivation and sanga/group. We can start and report each other daily; this way we may become regular in practice.

  

For example, one of my reports is as follows:  

(Thursday: 7-July-16):

1\. MFM: 20 min 12.55pm \[ET\]

2\. TM: 20 min: 1.15pm

3\. Hathyoga (asans)+SN (suryanamaskar in gym: 40 min 5.30pm

4\. Walk +SKY 1 hr: 7.30PM

5\. Gym 1hr: elliptical (30 min) + weight (30 min): 9pm

6\. Pranayama + Mahabandha (10 min): 11pm

Total effort: 3.5 hrs

  

How is your daily report?



**\[2\] Sehgal**: I was going thru some exchange of mails, you had with some other participants in present discussions. There, Itook following notice of your quotes:  
  

“I try to practice yoga daily. And I am searching for colleagues who are interested in this project to test the following hypothesis:



***Nirvikalpa Samādhi is also brain-mind based; self does not leave the brain-body system, and has significant subjective biases****”.*



Leave away*,*Nirvikalpa Samadhi for the time being even lower stages of Samādhi viz., Savikalapa etc are not brain-mind based. In meditation, unless awareness of physical body persists, that is nowhere near Samādhi, lower one or higher one. That is the criteria by which one can test if one has entered state of Samādhi or not? Once consciousness starts withdrawing from physical body, one starts entering Samādhi. In other words, Samādhi is the state of "emptying" of physical body fromconsciousness when awareness of physical body starts disappears.



Than even if state of "emptying" of physical body is achieved, if mind -body are dominant by Tamas, no internal light or internal sound appears. When Sattva dominates the mind/body and also one rises above physical body thatone can get knowledge of internalrealms/bodies as well as of the internal anatomy of this body. Sofor the achievement of Samādhi to be in real sense, 1) Rising of above physical body or "emptying"out of physical body of consciousness leading to un-awareness of physical body 2)appearance of some internal lights where attention is being focused.



With Abhyaasa (practice), one can develop capability to manipulate internal lights. If that lightis thrown in physical body, internalanatomy of body including starts becoming visible the way one can see outer world in presence of Sun light. If one is not interested in going into study of physical body, one can go upwards to see and study parts of astral body viz., Manas, Buddhi. 10 senses. The whole progress in Samādhi depends upon some key factors viz., 1) Degree of the extent of withdrawal of consciousness out of physical body and subsequently from astral and causal body ii)Degree of Sattva.



But kindly note that above Samādhis are no way near Nirvikalpa samādhi since they have some "Sankalapa' But sankalap does not emerges out from brain but from mind transcendental to brain. As the name implies, Nirvikalpa samādhi implies without any “Sankalapa".



Another key factor is the grace of a fully realized Guru. A fully realized Guru can facilitate the follower in withdrawal of consciousness by*Shakti Paata.*A fully realized Guru canhelp his follower either keeping follower with him in his close proximity or even from remote distance since such Gurus can cover remotest of distance in instants by traveling in Astral world. In astral world, Laws of this Physical world are not applicable.



Once above conceptsshall appeal you intellectually and convinced of same, your insistence of dependence of Samādhiupon brain/neural networks shall also be over. Another way is to locate a person who has really achieved state of Samādhi as per criteria, as given above, and make him ready for neurological testing. But such people are rare and how will you identify them? Even if such people are located, they may not be inclined for neurological testingsince their objective and purposes are much higher and different thantesting of some hypothesis thru neurological testing.



**Vimal**: As per [(Yoga of Sri Chinmoy, 2016)](http://www.yogaofsrichinmoy.com/the-higher-worlds/samadhi-fld/samadhi/), “**Savikalpa, Nirvikalpa and Sahaja Samadhi** \[:\] There are three types of samādhi: Savikalpa samādhi, Nirvikalpa samādhi and Sahaja samādhi.



In Savikalpa samādhi there can be thoughts inside the trance, but the trance will not be disturbed or perturbed. The thoughts are like children playing in a room when the father is deeply absorbed in his studies. The children are playing, but they do not disturb him. So in Savikalpa samādhi there can be a turbulence of thoughts and ideas, but the divine trance that the seeker is enjoying will not be affected.



In Nirvikalpa samādhi there is no thought, no idea, nothing whatsoever. All is tranquility, or you can say tranquility’s flood. Here nature’s dance comes to an end. The restless activity of human nature cannot play its role. There is no thought, no idea, no form, only the transcendental Silence and boundless Peace, Light and Delight. In this expanse of infinite Peace, Light and Delight, there exist only the seeker and his Beloved Supreme, who have become one.



Then comes a samādhi known as Sahaja samādhi. In this samādhi, after having attained the highest realm of consciousness, one can remain on earth and enter into multifarious activities while maintaining his highest realization. It is as if one is sitting quietly inside a jet plane which is flying at a speed of seven-hundred miles per hour, but one does not notice any motion at all. In Sahaja samādhi one maintains the highest transcendental consciousness within and, at the same time, throws himself into the world’s activities in order to transform humanity and free humanity from ignorance. This samādhi is for those who have reached the Highest and whom the Highest Absolute Supreme wants to manifest Himself in and through” (some spelling editing are mine).



Any kind of experience has neural-basis; so as long as we are aware and experience, there will always be neural-basis. In all types of Samadhi, there is always correlated neural basis, and there are always subjective biases. This is the null hypothesis for testing. Let us investigate if we can reject it.



Cheers!

  

Kindest regards,

Ram
