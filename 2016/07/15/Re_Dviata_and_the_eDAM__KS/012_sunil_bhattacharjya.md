**Vimal**: I agree because *Dvi-Pak**ṣa Advaita* (DPA) is also monism (*Advaita*) and it explains better than other 6 Advaitas^(^(\[i\])) because it is based on science’s bottom-up approach which has less chances of falling in the clutches of *avidyā*; in addition, DPA is the only metaphysics which brings religions closer to science.

Shankara's advaita is at the highest level. It appears to me that you have misunderstood Shankara's Advaita. Shankara was an advaitin in the paramsthika sense. That does not mean that he ignored what is appropriate for the vyavaharika level. To understand Shankara it is important that one should go through most of the writings of Shankara and not only the main texts of the prasthantraya. For example. if one reads the Shivanandalahari, one should also read the Prabodha sudhakara. If one reads the Vivekachudamani one should also read the materialistic compositions of Shankara.
