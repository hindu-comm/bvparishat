Respected Ramji,

I think first one should know the meaning of Yoga, Cita, Samadhi, Brahman, Ishwara and so on until and unless we know the root meaning we may keep going around the bush but not into the bush, it is like 9^(th) sutra of yoga sutra of Samadhi pada Śabdajñānānupātī vastuśūnyo vikalpaḥ\|\|9\|\|





Regards

Ravindranath
