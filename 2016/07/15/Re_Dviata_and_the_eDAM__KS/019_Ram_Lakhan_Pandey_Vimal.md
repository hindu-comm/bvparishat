Respected Vinod ji,

  

Thanks for further elaboration.

  

It seems that the Patanjali’s *Astāng yoga*’s *Yama*s and *Niyama*s are designed for *sanayāsī* because of prerequisites such as‘*Brahmacharya* and *Aparigraha*’; this is not for married people with children (like me). Furthermore, it is for top-down theist system (such as theist *Sāṃkhya*) because of ‘Ishwara Praanidhaana’ separate from brain-mind systems. It does not appear to be for the bottom-up approach such as *Dvi-Pakṣa Advaita*, where highest manifestation of *Brahman* is considered at *nirvikalpa samādhi* within a mind-brain system. Patanjali’s *Astāng yoga* method may be suitable for you, so you please follow this method and try your best to reach to *nirvikalpa samādhi*.



My method includes (1) Hathyoga, (2) Pranayama, (3) Bandhas, and (4) Buddhist MFM (mindful meditation), Maharishi Mahesh yogi’s TM, and Sri Sri Ravi Shankar’s SKY. I also use the concept of Tantra’s *PremYoga* (*DivyaPrem* to Samādhi) during MFM, TM, and SKY.



So let us follow methods whatever suit us and try our best!

  

Cheers!

  

Regards,

Ram

Respected Dr Ram  
  
 Yesterday I could not complete my response on some issues as raised by you. Now would like to take up the balance issues

  
  
**Vimal**: Neural activities in stimuli dependent feed forward pathways are present; but attentional neural activities are below threshold because attentional NN is not activated enough for access consciousness so we cannot precisely report what those stimuli were. The subjective experiences are below threshold so we cannot report them.  
  

Sehgal : It means building of neural network for particular stimli is dependent upon attention and consciousness. if attention is not there, NN ( pp3) shall not be built.What is attention? Attention is also focusing of consciousness on particular stumuli. But why it is so? why
synapses are not built up in relevant NN i.e pp3 irrespective of attention or amount of reportable ( access) consciosness. I am raising issue of building of of pp3 and not pp1 .  
  

It also implies consciousness and attention are primary for building pp3.  

  

When brain is bombarded with mutifarious stimlii at same time, than does pp3 is built up for each stimulii. By pp3 here, I imply synapses building of synapses in respective network? Above is a pure neurological issue  
  

**Vimal**: Self (proto-self in brain-stem, core self in thalamo-cortical areas, and autobiographical self in memory related areas) is the 1pp-mental aspect of self-related areas (such as cortical midline structures) and is the subjective experience of subject. This is detailed in [(Vimal, 2013)](http://sites.google.com/site/rlpvimal/Home/2012-Vimal-Emergence-UMBW-CUP.pdf). Yes, each neuron is composed of elementary particles; a state of each of them is dual-aspect entity.

One very interesting query is what happened to mental aspect.  
  

Sehgal : Are you braking self in different categories? How these 3 categories of Self are born? Materialists postulate the birth of Self from the matter of brain but eDAM postulates mental aspect. Does Self takes birth in the mental aspect as embedded in brain? If it is so. It means before brain takes shape, mental aspect in which self is produced should exist.  
  

But you have indicated that SEs are excitations are experiencial aspect of consciousness. But SE is done by a unified whole which you are placing in brain and that too in 3 parts. It appears inconsistency.
