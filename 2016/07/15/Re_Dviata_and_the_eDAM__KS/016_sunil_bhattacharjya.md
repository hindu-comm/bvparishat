Dear Ramji,  
  
1)

  
**Vimal**: In my view, there is no authentic evidence of for the hypothesis of “theory of rebirth” although there are many articles on this subject. Today, Google Scholar search with the keyword “theory of rebirth” gave me 477 results and “evidence for rebirth” gave 52 results. You may like to look at them and let me know if there is some robust reproducible data. Then, we can design some experiments to test it further.  
  

That is what I wanted to point out to you. The subject of paramarthika in Advaita is beyond the reach of neuro-science, not only now, it will remain so in future. So comparing advaita and looking at it through the eyes of neuro-scientific experiments would not be sound, It is better that neuro-scientists realize the limitation of theirs.  
  
2)

  
Vimal: Well, you may have read them all. So kindly let me know precisely how matter-in-itself such as ‘chair-in-itself’ (not its appearance) is derived from the non-dual *Brahman* in *Śankarāchārya’s Advaita*?  

  
It should have been better if you would have given your reply as to how ‘chair-in-itself’ (not its appearance) is derived from the non-dual *Brahman* in neuro-science Comparing neuro-science to advaita is blasphemous. Lord Krishna gave the Bhagavad Geetopadesha is a yoga-yukta state. If you are keen to have experience from the spiritual domain, you have to follow the yogic discipline as given in the yogashastra under a guru to achieve spiritual progress and proper understanding of the spiritual matters.  
  

Kind regards,  

SKB
