Sri Ravindranathji,  
I'm sorry to hear these words from you "......Upanishads, Yoga sutras and so on and nobody showing what is the results by practicing it, why one should die with such difficulties by getting up early in the morning and doing so many asana, pranayama and other things....."  
Without going into depth of any of these and a cursory glance will not meet your goal.  
अभ्यासेन तु कौन्तेय वैराग्येण च गृह्यते। is what Krishna's advice  
More over Upanishad guarantee that तरति शोकं आत्मवित्। and मत्वा धीरो न शोचति। etc...  
Until one knows the reality of existence and the apparent relation of the individual with the known one cannot overcome grief. ..  
Even death is to be known from That Knowledge so that by knowing "Which" one has no more fear of it.  
Hari Om!  
Aurobind
