Respected vidwan Srinivas ji,

  

Thanks for excellent elaboration.

  

The logic of *Dvaita* is very interesting indeed. Let us look at it more closely.



*Dvaita* assumes three kinds/groups/categories of fundamental independent entities: single Brahman, innumerable jīva-s (living entities), and innumerable Jada-s (non-living entities): is this correct?



Actually it is not *Dvaita* (dualism, two independent entities), it appears misnomer; rather there are three independent entities; its name should be ‘trialism’.



\[1\] Innumerable Jada-s (non-living entities): “The epistemological source for Jada matter is sense perception (*pratyaksha*)”; this is true, but it is based on the ‘appearance’ of classical inert matter-in-itself in mind-dependent reality, where term ‘mind’ is western term that includes all mental entities, such as our subjective experiences, self, thoughts and so on. For example, when we look at chair, we experience its appearance. In mind-independent reality, we do not know what the chair-in-itself is; we cannot reject its existence even though we do not have direct perception.



\[2\] Innumerable jīva-s (living entities) are also based on appearance but of our kind. Since we feel that we have alive and have jīva, so other humans are also like us, and also animals, birds, plants and so on. Who is ‘I’? This is based on our own feeling that I exist; so I extrapolate myself to you that you also exist like me.



\[3\] Single Brahman is the extrapolation of our wakeful consciousness/experiences and conjecture that some entity higher than us exist who created this universe.



One can also argue that \[2\] and \[3\] are based on *Samādhi* state knowledge as elaborated in *Veda*s.



There are many models, so how to select one of them. There are model selection criteria. For example, when we try to find relationship/interaction between the three independent entities, *Dvaita*’s problems starts. If any of them interact, they will certainly make the serious category mistakes: such as interactions between *jīva* and matter, *jīva* and *Brahman*, and *Brahman* and matter. Therefore, *Dvaita* is untenable unfortunately.  

  

The *Dvi-Pak**ṣa Advaita*(the eDAM) does not such problems and is the least problematic metaphysics.

  

Cheers!

  

Kind regards,

RAm

RespectedVinod Sehgal,

  

Thanks for asking those questions. They are really good questions.

  

Yes, Dvaita accepts three ontological entities (tattva-s) -- Brahman, Jiva and Jada (matter). In these three, only in Jiva and Jada class we have many members. In Brahman's class there is only one. With these, we have five combinations and hence five fold differences (what is called 'panch-bhEdha' in Sanskrit)

  

As far as your other question on how to identify the difference between Jiva-s, before I answer I want to set the stage of epistemology on which the very position of existence of these three ontological categories are accepted. Without talking epistemological framework, there is no point in discussing details about ontological categories, for it will be purely speculative and has no weight.

  

My initial expectations and demand (for anybody who proposes something or the other) is to draw their propositions from the sources of their knowledge. The ides here is that one cannot claim as position without already knowing about it. How did he know about it ? what are his source of such valid knowledge?

  

With above stage in place, I can start answering your question now. My contention is that whatever the sources (of knowledge) which told us about existence of Brahman/Jiva/Jada ontological categories to begin with, must logically be the source of knowledge about other details about them such as differentiating characteristics between them etc. The epistemological source for Jada matter is sense perception (pratyaksha) no doubt, however source of knowledge about Brahman/Jiva is not sense perception but Vedas only. So, we must look for answers in Vedas only. I am sure you agree with me on this criteria.

  

There are up teem number of shruti pramANa-s about jIva-s and their uniqueness. We can visit them in details. On the other hand there is no pramANa to say they are all same in nature. This is what we call in shAstra as sAdaka-pramANa and bAdaka-pramANa.

  

On the other hand you have declared "samskAra-s are product of matter". This itself is a philosophical position and begs the evidence (scriptural and/or non-scriptural). Can you provide one? Also you need to establish the difference you perceive in the world among people are ONLY due to material difference they are made of. Even if you could show so, then you need to answer why people are granted with such differentiating material bodies.

  

Souls are unique in their iccha-jnAna-kriya. These three elements constitutes their essential nature. They are differentiated on these factors.

  

We can continue in next mail.

  

Regards,

Srinivas.
