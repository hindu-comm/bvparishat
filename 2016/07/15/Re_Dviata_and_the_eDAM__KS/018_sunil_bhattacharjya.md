Dear Ramji,  
  

The greatest and the insurmountable problem in your approach is that you are trying to demolish the cornerstone of the Indian philosopohy, that is the "Theory of Reicarnation". No true Hindu will ever question Lord Krishna when he talked about his earlier births. No Buddhist will question, when Lord Buddha talked about his earlier births. Lord Buddha considered himself awakened only when he could know about his past births.  
  
In fact, even in the Semitic religions, there are many who believe in reincarnation. Rumi's Masnavi says that. Once I saw a publication entitled "Reincarnation in Islam", by a Muslim scholar and that was published from Chennai. There are scholars among the Christians, who have shown that the Bible has indicated reincarnation.  
  

Now coming to creation, you seem to think that every level of Indian philosophy has to deal with the mechanism of creation and that is because like the western scholars, many Indians too including you seem to think that different darshanas are competitors to each other. However, many like me do not think so. The Lokayata does not worry about the jijnashas of the Nyaya-vaisheshika. at a different level. The Sankhya jijnashas are at a higher level and talks about the creation by Prakriti (or Maya) with its 25 tattwas. Lord Krishna tells us that Yoga (with its 26th tattva, the Ishvara) is combined with Maya. The Purva mimansa is at a higher level and the Uttara-Mimansa is at that highest level and that is the Vedanta. Many so-called vedantists quarrel with each other by saying Lord Vishnu is higher than Lord Shiva or vice-versa, whereas a true Vedantists follow what the upanishada says, "Shiva's heart is Vishnu and Vishnu's heart is Shiva", i.e., there is no difference between the two. . The Vedanta tells us that a quarter of Brahman is invovlved in the web-making. Advaita Vedanta talks about the state beyond the realm of Prakriti or Maya.  
  
For your enquiries regarding the mechanism pf creation, you can look up Sankhya, which ideals with Prakriti. The versatile genius that he was, Adi Shankaracharya also had written commentaries on Sankhya and Yoga.
