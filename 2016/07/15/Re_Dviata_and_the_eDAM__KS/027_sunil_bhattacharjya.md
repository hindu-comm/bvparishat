Dear Ravindranathji,  
  

Shri Ramji will reply to your mail. I had a look at your mail and find the following interesting ;  
  

\< - - - - - - - - if you are a scientist and the theory which you believe in doesn’t work I don’t think you will follow it you will just leave it and go on and try to find the next, the same thing is happening with the Indian knowledge - - - - - ->  

  

Having been in the Scientific profession for more than four decades, I can assure you that science is yet to say the last word in any subject. Many scientists may think that our knowledge of creation of matter is complete, but really it is not so. Just to give you an example, it in only very recently that it has been found that there is dark matter in this universe, which in fact, is much more than the visible matter in the universe. So also in all other areas, where new knowledge is emerging and many old concepts are being discarded. . But in the spiritual matters, we have the Vedas and Upanishads, which we consider as the eternal texts.  
  

Regards,
