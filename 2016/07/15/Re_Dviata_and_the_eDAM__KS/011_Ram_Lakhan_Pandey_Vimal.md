Respected vidwans Sunil ji, Vinod ji and Aurobind ji,

  

Thanks for excellent comments and further elaboration.

  

##### [Sunil bhattacharjya]() (7/17/16)

The time itself is a part of the web making process and when the web is withdrawn the time ends, thus losing any continuity. Any present identity, such as the namesand criteria for our identification, at most lasts only for one life time of a few decades andthat too continuously changing from the time of birth to the time of the last breath. A man of this lifetime was not necessarily a man in the past births and it is not certain that the man of this birth will be born as a man in the next birth(s). Even in the present lifetime, a few decades of existence as a man on this earth of 4.5 billion yearsis just a fleeting existence, with any dualisticidentity. \[even if we don't consider the 12+ billion years’ life of the Solar system.\] All this is to show that the dual existence is fleeting existence, as compared to the eternal Advaitic existence. If any non-advaitin does not argue for the sake of argument and tries to ponder over the matter, he or shewill surely understand that there is only advaitic existence throughout and with continuity. Some people may have difficulty in understanding this and such person has to go to an advaitic guru and internet discussions has its limitations and can never substitute any personal discussion.



**Vimal**: I agree because *Dvi-Pak**ṣa Advaita* (DPA) is also monism (*Advaita*) and it explains better than other 6 Advaitas^(^(\[i\])) because it is based on science’s bottom-up approach which has less chances of falling in the clutches of *avidyā*; in addition, DPA is the only metaphysics which brings religions closer to science.



##### Vinod Sehgal (July 17, 2016)

**\[1\] Sehgal**: I was going thru the exchange of mails between you and Vidwāns aurobindji and Sunulji.



Yog Darshan of Patanjali and Bhashyam byVyasa, specifies three states in state of meditation viz., Dharnaam, Dhyaana & Samaadhi. Most of Westerns have achieved the state of Dharnaa or at the most Dhyaana. Very few people have achieved the state ofSamādhi.

There are many ways to classify Samādhi

i\) Based upon Saṃskārs—viz., Sabeej or Nirbeej, Here, beej implies Saṃskārs, i.e. Samādhis with orwithoutSaṃskārs Based.

ii\) Based upon "Sankalap"--Sankalap implies some resolution/assertion before entering into Samādhi, Yogi resolution i.e., he will focus and know particular entity of Astral/Physical world: So Savikalap andNirvikalapa Samādhi.  


iii\) Based upon "Vritti"/‘Vichhara'--Yog Darshandefines Saṃskārs as precursor to Vrittis/Vicharas (thoughts) and Vrittis asprecursor to Karmas (actions). based upon Vrittis, based upon this, Samādhis are Asmapargyaata orSamapagyaata.

iv\) Based upon "Gunas"--Sattva Pradhaan, Rajas Pradhaana, TamasPradhaana.  
  

In all those Samādhis where Saṃskārs, Vritti(Vichaara), Sankalapa, Gunas remains present are lower than Samādhis where these entities also disappear. Knowledge of Physical/Astral/causal world and related bodies is achieved in above Samādhis. Here by knowledge, I don't imply intellectual accumulation and understandingbut direct realization/observation in live stage. Intellectual accumulation of data can be obtained from internet, books, Wikipedia also.  
  

Realization of Supreme Self dawns in Samādhis which are free from Gunas, Beeja (saṃskārs), Vrittis (Vicharras), Sankalapa etc. Such Samādhis are higher state of Samādhis. In such Samādhis, Self leaves the support of all instruments of perceptions, cognition viz., Manas, Senses, Buddhi, Chitta, Ahmkāras, Gunas. It is here that Self (conscious soul/Jīva) loses its identification with all three bodies (Physical/Astral/causal) and becomes aware of its true nature. In subsequent higher stages, it starts identifying with Supreme Self (cosmic consciousness/Brahman).



**Vimal**: THANKS. I guess, *Nirvikalpa Samādhi* is considered the final and highest state of *Samādhi*: is this correct? I invite all *vidwān*s to practice it daily with me. The hypothesis to test is: *Nirvikalpa Samādhi is also brain-mind based; self does not leave the brain-body system, and has significant subjective biases.* Here, mind is western term and includes all 1pp-mental entities, which is private. It is brain-mind based because it is also an experience and must have neural basis, which can be verified by EEG and functional MRI combined. It has subjective biases because we all will interpret the subjective *Nirvikalpa Samādhi* state data according our beliefs: for example, Vinod ji will interpret it in terms of *Sā**ṃkhya*, and I will interpret the data in terms of *Dvi-Pak**ṣa Advaita. *



**\[2\] Sehgal**: Thanks for your quite detailed reply wherein you have appraised with the new findings about which I was unaware of earlier.



**Vimal**: This is an interesting query. Consciousness is a part of 1pp-mental aspect. It has two sub-aspects: functional and experiential as elaborated in[(Vimal, 2009f)](http://sites.google.com/site/rlpvimal/Home/2009-Vimal-Meanings-LVCR-2-10.pdf). The experiential sub-aspect of consciousness is of two kinds[(Vimal, 2015f)](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.1.1587.9124):

(i)The non-reportable phenomenal consciousness, where attention is not needed; it is of very short duration (usually 10-100 msec).

(ii)The reportable access consciousness, where attention is needed; it is of longer duration (usually 100-500 msec).

For example, during long driving, we go to auto-pilot mode where attention is not on driving, but conversing with friends. Our brain does great job because usually accident does not happen unless some aggressive driver makes cut (such as changes the lane) and then we immediately return back to attentive mode. Many stimuli bombard the brain of driver. In each case, a conscious state has 1pp-mental aspect and its inseparable 3pp-aspect for both phenomenal and access consciousness; there are necessary conditions for both kinds of consciousness as elaborated in[(Vimal, 2015f)](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.1.1587.9124). When there is no attention, the access consciousness is below critical threshold, therefore, it does not come into reportable awareness, which you feel as if “there is no experience, i.e., nil 1pp”. However, we have phenomenal consciousness that we cannot report it; our brain is still able to process the information; otherwise, we will not able to drive. When attention comes, then we have additional neural-network that is added to the old NN for phenomenal consciousness, so that we can experience with full awareness/attention and able to report it. I would recommend reading the above two articles for further clarification.



**Sehgal**: My specific and straightforward question was.



When brain is bombarded with multitudes of stimuli and mind is engrossed somewhere else i.e. reportable or access consciousness is below threshold limit, synapse in related neural network pertaining to stimuli is built or NOT. If Yes, OK. If not, why synapse is not built up despite stimuli entering brain.



When multitudes of stimuli collide brain simultaneously, can nos. of synapses built simultaneouslyor synapses building takes place in sequence one by one.



Then, if synapses are built up, there should also be subjective experience (pp1) for sake of inseparability.

Above issues pertain purely with neuro-Science and only a person like can respond appropriately.



**Vimal**: Neural activities in stimuli dependent feed forward pathways are present; but attentional neural activities are below threshold because attentional NN is not activated enough for access consciousness so we cannot precisely report what those stimuli were. The subjective experiences are below threshold so we cannot report them.



**\[3\] Vimal**: The mechanism is the*inseparability*of aspects. Information is precisely the same; it is just looking at the same information from two different perspectives. In other words, if we look the information from the 3^(rd)person perspective (3pp), we see just neural activities; if we view the same information from the 1^(st)person perspective (1pp), then have experiences.



One could argue that the identity theory of materialism also claims the same as you are implicitly trying to say. However, materialism’s premise is that matter is the only fundamental reality, which leads to serious problem of explanatory gap: how experiences can arise from non-experiential matter. On other hand, the eDAM postulates that a state of an entity has two *inseparable*aspects; and does not encounter such problems.



Sehgal: The eDAM postulates two fundamental entities viz., Physicality and Mental. Mental encompasses consciousness, self, attention, thoughts eye.  
  
In the context of neuro -Science, Physicality is brain and related neural networks and Mental is consciousness. In between consciousness and brain are also thoughts as emanating in Mind butin order to reduce complexities for conveying my point, I am keeping aside thoughts and mind. As such, shall keep brain and experiential consciousness only for discussion.



**Vimal**: Yes, there are thoughts that arise spontaneously or thru some mechanisms in-between experiences as TUTs (thoughts unrelated to task). TUTs disturb our meditation. Stimuli are processed in parallel, but each stimulus is processed at various neural areas from retina to cortex in sequence.

  
  

**\[4\] Sehgal**: Now brain and consciousness though, inseparable as per eDAM, but they carry distinct and discrete identities. In view of their discreteness and distinct character, there should be some mechanism under which a synapse building in brain (3pp) of a stimulus can lead to sensing of same (SE) by Self (consciousness).  
  
****

**Vimal**: Self (proto-self in brain-stem, core self in thalamo-cortical areas, and autobiographical self in memory related areas) is the 1pp-mental aspect of self-related areas (such as cortical midline structures) and is the subjective experience of subject. This is detailed in [(Vimal, 2013)](http://sites.google.com/site/rlpvimal/Home/2012-Vimal-Emergence-UMBW-CUP.pdf). Yes, each neuron is composed of elementary particles; a state of each of them is dual-aspect entity.

One very interesting query is what happened to mental aspect.

  
**\[5\] Sehgal**: While writing these lines, some new ideas cropped up in my mind. Brain is composed of billions of distinct neurons with each of neuron in turn composed of baryons. Consciousness (Self) on the other hand is a composite integrated whole entity nothing is known about whose composition. In other words, both entities are of entirely different nature. How these two entities can be inseparable?  
  

**Vimal**: They are inseparable because information is precisely the same in both 1pp-mental aspect (experiences) and 3pp-physical aspect (brain activities), except they are coded in different languages.

##### [Aurobind Padiyath]() (July 17, 2016)

Since Sri Vinodji, has given enlightened answers on your samādhi related doubts and he may be able to explain specific questions about it. My knowledge is limited.

Addressing your 1st-pp and 3rd-pp perspective to find out the consciousness-matter duality, it will never be possible to come to a definition and parameters of it for measuring. In both cases one should understand even in 3rd-pp, the narrator explains it from his 1st-pp (remember Schrödinger's cat?) whichall of us know is a coded information based on his encodification of his sensory inputs and its effect as memory in his recalling that memory to calibrate what he is presently evaluating.

Take for example of sweetness the same measure of sugar will give two levels of sweetness to two different individuals. Then what to talk about inner feelings emotions or non-tangible subjects. Another example which was asked to my friend by a small kid, why are you teaching English when this class is about mathematics? Just because he was introducing (a+b)(a+b)=......... See the perception of the child was anything written in alphabetical has to be English.

Measuring of brain waves, to me, is no different from using the same to measure biceps or calf muscles. Both measure only signals in one input of electrical and the fatigue experienced by the organ, it is no way measuring the thoughts, the quality and quantity of thoughts forget about the consciousness driving those thoughts. Even a man on controlled oxygen input in a biped machine can be made to give out alpha to gamma waves when you monitor and regulate the percentage of the oxygen absorption in his blood. He may slip from hallucination to delirium to coma.

These are scientific exercises with only known parameters and available equipment. One cannot conclude it is all comprehensive. They may have their uses and advantages in fieldwork of physiological applications.

Then there are some who are trying to extrapolate metaphysics so that they can meet up with spiritual evaluation. Like the Holographic Universe (Micheal Talbot), Tao of Physics (Fritjof Capra) etc.

Let me explain how Vedanta approach these. All scientific research is acceptable in their respective realm. But still it being an act in the waking world it will be conditioned by the rules of that state of mind and intellect, space and time etc. Which is limited in its prowess. Plus, the following aspect which, I do not know if you agree or not.

All that we know is in an intermingled state of object-subject duality, matter-consciousness complex. Sri Śankarāchārya in his opening commentary to Brahma sutra explains it clearly. Plus, Sri Sureshwaracharya in his Vartika to Brhadaranyaka gives a beautiful narration of the same.

निश्शेष अनात्मतत्हेतु निराकरणवत्मना आत्मत्वं आत्मना सिध्येत्। न अन्यशेषं अनात्मवत्।

Here the two are called Atma and Anatma, Chit and Jada. The Jada is always intermingled with Chit in both waking and dream. The term used is TADATMYAM. The Jada cannot be known unless it is in in the intermingled state. And no one can separate them physically. Even we are so identified with our body to the extend we transact with the inert body with the life in it but while transacting treat it as unified one. Same is the case with any object. The only example when we remain in our Atma swaroopa is in the deep sleep where these intermingled experience is nullified. Here again it is only everyone's 1st-pp experience. But when we are shifted to that state of Consciousness, the intermingled experience goes thru a process of understanding where we no more see only the Jada but it's Atma too. There we will be identified with the Atma of the Jada and that of this body which till now I was calling as we are the same. The Jada will lose its apparent independent existence which it was borrowing from the Atma till then and projecting as it's. The Jada manifest Atma for its existence, also without Jada Atma remains in the unmanifested state.

It's not easy to give the detailed explanation in emails and group mails. One will need to get into the depth of the analytical approach to gather finer details of it.

**Vimal**: Your view seems consistent with the* Dvi-Pakṣa Advaita*. This is because for example, an experience (such as redness in 1pp-mental aspect) and its neural basis (such as color visual area V4/8/VO, 3pp-physical aspect) are *inseparable* within spatio-temporal critical threshold. The definition of 1pp-mental aspect and 3pp-physical aspect are elaborated in detail in [(Vimal, 2016b)](http://sites.google.com/site/rlpvimal/Home/2016-Vimal-eDAM-Metaphysics-LVCR-8-2.pdf).^(^(\[ii\])) Yes, 3pp-physical aspect of a conscious state of my brain-mind system is your 1pp-mental aspect (greyness of my brain’s neural networks), which will be totally different from my 1pp-mental aspect (such as redness of ripe-tomato).

Cheers!

  

Kindest regards,

\[i\] Vedānta philosophy was developed after Vedās. It has six main sub-schools [(Vimal, 2012b)](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/2.1.1982.0485): *Advaita* (non-dualism, *Adi Shankarāchārya*: 788-820), cit-acit Viśiṣṭādvaita (qualified non-dualism, *Ramānujāchārya*: 1017–1137), *Dvaitādvaita* (*Nimbārkāchārya*: 1130-1200), *Dvaita* (dualism, *Madhvacharya*: 1238–1317), *Shuddhādvaita* (pure non-dualism, *Vallabhacharya*: 1479-1531), and *Achintya-Bheda-Abheda* (inconceivable oneness and difference, *Chaitanya Mahaprabhu*, 1486-1534).



\[ii\] In the *Sā**ṃkhya* philosophy (E-mail communications from 28-Apr-2016 to 15-July-2016 with Vinod Kumar Sehgal), *Puru**ṣa* is only an experiencer/witness/*Dristā*/*Sākshi* and *Prak**ṛti* consists of

(i) Causal world (*kāran jagat*) is composed of 3 *guna*s (*Sattva, Rajas,* and *Tamas*) and *Ahamkāra*s;

(ii) Astral world (*sukshma jagat*) consists offive *Tanmātras* (*rūpa, śabda, sparśa, rasa,* and *gandha*), *Buddhi*, *Manas*, and ten senses; and

(iii) Physical world (*sthūla jagat*) containing fermions, bosons and four fundamental forces.

In the eDAM, the categorization of entities is based on perspectives: the 1pp-mental aspect is from first person perspective and is private. The 3pp is for public. The causal and astral bodies of *Sāṃkhya* are parts of the functional sub-aspect of consciousness and conscious subjective experiences and experiencer (self) are parts of the experiential sub-aspect of consciousness. All have neural-basis. All are from 1pp and private. Therefore, grouping them in 1pp-mental aspect is justified.

1\. Subjective mental aspect, such as experiences and thoughts, from the 1^(st) person perspective (1pp).

2\. Objective physical aspect such as neural-network of brain and its activities from the 3^(rd) person perspective (3pp). The qualitative sub-aspect of a state of an entity includes forms/*rūpa*, patterns of distribution of matter/energy in space and time, and/or patterns of vibrations for both living and non-living systems (Pereira Jr., Vimal & Pregnolato, 2016). This is from 3pp. Therefore, it should be part of 3pp-physical aspect,^(^(\[ii\])) which is consistent with *Sāṃkhya* as *rūpa* is one of the five *tanmātras* (*rūpa, śabda, sparśa, rasa,* and *gandha*) that are part of *Prakṛti*. The 3pp-physical aspect also includes the appearance of matter and also matter-in-itself. Strictly speaking matter-in-itself, being an entity of mind-independent reality, is unknown, but we try our best to know it by making models using our minds as in physics. The mental aspect (such as experiences) is from 1pp; therefore, qualitative sub-aspect is not a part of 1pp-mental aspect.

For example, a conscious state of a mind-brain system has (i) the objective physical aspect such as neural-network of brain and its activities from the third person perspective (3pp), and (ii) the subjective mental aspect such as experiences from the first person perspective (1pp). The degree of manifestation of physical aspect (đ_(p)) of an entity-state is high in both living and non-living systems.

We have assumed that, in Nature, the subjective experiences (mental aspect) *potentially* co-exist with its *inseparable* physical aspect (this is our second postulate).
