Respected vidwan Sunil ji,

  

Thanks for comments.

  

**\[1\] Bhattacharjya**: How do you thinkthe much-vaunted knowledge of neuroscience will verify the claims of the past-births, about which both Lord Krishna and Lord Buddha talked?

**Vimal**: In my view, there is no authentic evidence of for the hypothesis of “theory of rebirth” although there are many articles on this subject. Today, Google Scholar search with the keyword “theory of rebirth” gave me 477 results and “evidence for rebirth” gave 52 results. You may like to look at them and let me know if there is some robust reproducible data. Then, we can design some experiments to test it further.



**\[2\] Bhattacharjya**: Shankara's advaita is at the highest level. It appears to me that you have misunderstood Shankara's Advaita. Shankarawas an advaitin in the paramsthika sense. That does not mean that he ignored what is appropriate for the vyavaharika level. To understand Shankara it is important that one should go through most of the writings of Shankara and not only the main texts of the prasthantraya. For example, if one reads the Shivanandalahari, one should also read the Prabodha sudhakara. If one reads the Vivekachudamani one should also read the materialistic compositions of Shankara.

Vimal: Well, you may have read them all. So kindly let me know precisely how matter-in-itself such as ‘chair-in-itself’ (not its appearance) is derived from the non-dual *Brahman* in *Śankarāchārya’s Advaita*?

  

Cheers!

  

Kindest regards,

Ram
