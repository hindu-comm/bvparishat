Sorry, Dvaita does not \*assumes\* per se. Three entities on its ontological map is based on epistemological evidence. I hope you know the difference between "assumption" and "pramANa".

  

Also, your characterization of them as "independent entities" is not correct. Brahman is only the independent or what shAstra says "sva-tantra". Here the prefix "sva" stands for self same. Where as other two categories are "para-tantra". Here the prefix "para" stands for "other" or other than these two categories, which is nothing but Brahman. Hence jIva and material are the para-tantra or dependent realities.

The term "Dvaita" was based on high level classification of 'Independent' and 'Dependent'. Not on the number of classes per se.

What about 'mind' itself? Is it independent reality? or yet again known only via mind itself?

  

If former, then it is anti-thesis, for itself is its counter example.

  

If later, then you are on your way to infinite regress.

  

Dvaita is a realist school. There is no reason to assume a 'chair-appearance' may not correspond to actual 'chair' out there. This is the foundation of classical epistemological position of 'intrinsic-validity' (pramANya-svatatsvaM). This position alone is valid position. Opposite position of pramANya-parataH is found to be flawed (infinite regress to be specific).

Your position is not correct. Although you have a sense of 'I', it does not mean it is post-death persisting entity and the same entity Vedantins consider as 'Jiva'.

  

Dvaita's concept of 'Jiva' is based on textual evidence, not on perceptual evidence.

This is subjective opinion, which may or may not have objective reality to it.

  

Dvaita's conception of 'Brahman' is based on textual evidence who's validity is quite objective. Discussion of how Veda is valid objectively is whole another big topic and we can reserve for another day. But it is suffice to say at least Dvaita claims objective validity to Vedas. So also whatever such Vedas say about Brahman and Jivas.

In fact Veda is a primary source. Any experience one might have needs to validated against Veda and decide whatever one is having is whether really objective truth or just another case of hallucination.

Your premise itself is wrong here. You assume they are independent in their interaction. But in reality, it is Brahman Who enables and empowers these interactions. For example, Jiva is not independent in comprehending knowledge of a matter, say a chair. It is Brahman who is enabler for this to happen via various agencies, such as associating Jiva with material body/brain etc.

Although I have not studied eDAM fully, but I am inclined to say it is rehash of Dvaita only. In Dvaita Brahman is advitiya and independent. Brahman alone is enabler of all interactions. Other two dependents are on receiving side of this enablement. So, two our two broad categories of Independent-Dependent are equivalent of your "Dvi-Pasksha". I will study more of eDAM and comment on that.
