Respected vidwan Vinod ji,

  

Thanks for further comments.

  

**\[1\] Vimal**: THANKS. I guess,*Nirvikalpa Samādhi*is considered the final and highest state of*Samadhi*: is this correct? I invite all*vidwān*s to practice it daily with me. The hypothesis to test is:*Nirvikalpa Samādhi is also brain-mind based; self does not leave the brain-body system, and has significant subjective biases.*Here, mind is western term and includes all 1pp-mental entities, which is private. It is brain-mind based because it is also an experience and must have neural basis, which can be verified by EEG and functional MRI combined. It has subjective biases because we all will interpret the subjective*Nirvikalpa Samādhi*state data according our beliefs: for example, Vinod ji will interpret it in terms of*Sā**ṃkhya*, and I will interpret the data in terms of eDAM.

**Sehgal**: Yes, broadly speaking Nirvikalpa Samādhi belongs to category of higher stage ofSamādhis.

Samādhi is not a state that one may achieve with few days of practice with you. what you are misinterpreting is Dharnaa or Dhyaana which are stages prior to Samādhi. Leave away Nirvikalpa which is of higher stages., even lower stages of Samādhi(Savikalapa etc) can't be achieved by few days of practice.

For even lower level of Samādhi, complete and true Vairagya, years of daily practice and grace of a fully realized Guru is required. Even if such Samādhi is achieved this may be a Tamsic one in which Tammas is Pradhaan due to impurity of mind. In this Samādhi, nothing is observed like in deep sleep but it is not sleep. With the enhancement of purity of mind, Tammas changes to Rajas and Sattvaand Samādhi also changes to Rajjas and Sattva Pradhaan.

It is with the achievement of Sattvic Samādhis that real internal journey of Soul (Jīva) commences. It is in these Samādhis that internal lights start appearing in different parts of body but primarily in forehead.

With Abhyaasa (Practice) and Vairagya, intensity of internal light increases and thiscan make many entities of internal world visible in the same vividmanner as we see objects with our eyes in the outer world. In this light, one can see even his own body internally and observe its mechanism. One can even see one's own brain internally where no MRI can match (MRI is still an image but not direct observation).
One can even see other bodies internally if Yogi can develop power to throw the light into other's bodies.

In subsequent stages, when yogi can develop further power, he can withdraw his consciousness from physical body and enter the Astral body and see 10 Senses, 1 Mind, 1 Buddhi and their internal Mechanism. In this stages, consciousness leaves body so Yogi becomes oblivious of physical body and awakens in Astral body. These are the live experiences.

Nirvikalpa Samādhi takes place when consciousness leaves even Astral body and causal body also. It is only than consciousness which was earlier considering itself as Physical body or Astral and Causal bodyawakens in pure consciousnessand become aware of its true self. Before that everything is merely intellectual discussion giving some consolation as well some arrogance that we know this or that. I also belong to these category of people.

**Vimal**: Well, let us first start meditation seriously thru the method we are comfortable with. We will investigate further as we progress. We have already done enough intellectual exercise; let us practice seriously. What do you say?

**\[2\] Sehgal**: Inan e-mail particularly group mails, it is not feasible to add more on this subjects. Leave away Nirvikalpa Samādhi, even Savikalpa Samādhi, in which entities of Astral Body are seen/observed, are not brain-body based. As I mentioned above, such Samādhi takes place when consciousness leaves physical body i.e. brain/body. Even in Samādhi lower than this, though consciousness remains in physical body but it can see/observe body and brain internally in live conditions. if consciousness can see live brain in physical body, how Samādhi is brain/body based?

Self is not a part of the brain/body system. It lies over and above Physical/Astral/Causal body from where it observes/sees/perceives all the perceptions moving upwards from Physical body/Astral Body/Causal body. What neurologists are treating as self e.g. autobiographical self and other selfare the places in braineffect of Buddhi/manas/Senses are projected on brain. There is only one Selfperceiving(observing) perceptions from environment, memory, imagination, judgements, all components of intelligence and emotions. Classification of self made by neurologists in different parts of brain are not self but these are the places where elements of astral body leave their projections.

As I have explained above, not only Nirvikalpa Samādhi even in lower Samādhis, in which knowledge of astral body is achieved, consciousness leaves Physical body and brain. so what will MRI and EEG do in this regard. Therefore, question of biases does not arise. In this stage, condition of physical body becomes like deadexcept that some minimum consciousness remains in body to maintain BP and breathing to their minimal level.

As I indicate earlier, even lowest stages of Samādhi are achievable by rare only (I have not achieved that), so MRI and EEG will not record anything regarding status ofSamādhi. And those rare who have achieved even lowest stage of Samādhi are more interested in achieving higher stages of Samādhi than to get them tested thro MRI and EEG testing and getting some sort of certification. And those who are achieved higheststages of Nirvikalpa Samādhi are more interested in burning their Karmas and get rid of cycles of birth/death rather to pass thru neurological testing of EEG/MRI. Till such people live on this earth, they remain engaged in service activities exhorting others also totread on this path.  
  

**Vimal**: I have proposed a hypothesis to test. We do not know if it will be rejected. This is a research. When times comes, we will contact expert neuroscientists to design experiments to test the hypothesis rigorously. It will take time as you mentioned. So why to worry right now; let us at least first start and we will investigate as we progress.Are you and/or other vidwāns ready?

Cheers!

Ram
