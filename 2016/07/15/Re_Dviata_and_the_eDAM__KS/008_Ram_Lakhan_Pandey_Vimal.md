Respected vidwans Aurobind ji and Sunil ji,

  

Thanks for excellent comments and information.

  

**\[1\] Padiyath**: I'm not an expert in the neurophysiology or neuropathy. So my approach will be restricted to the scriptures viz., Upanishads and Śankarāchārya Bhashyams. There are no four states first of all. The fourth one in your categories, Samadhi, is part of the third, i.e., waking consciousness where one willfully restricts the mental process by reducing from multiple to single and then dissolving the specifics of even that single to remain for a duration in that state. This being a willful act it has to be part of waking, like falling into loss of memory, coma, etc.



**Vimal**: I agree that subjects need to be awake and conscious during *Samādhi* state to experience it such as Bliss/*Ānanda*. My categorization was simplified view. Scientifically, we use EEG, functional MRI, and so on for classification. For example, the 5 types of brain wave frequencies (Gamma, Beta, Alpha, Theta, Delta), please see [this](http://mentalhealthdaily.com/2014/04/15/5-types-of-brain-waves-frequencies-gamma-beta-alpha-theta-delta/), which claims for the increase gamma waves during meditation. To avoid confusion, let us call ‘*Nirvikalpa Samādhi*’ (NS) state of our mind-brain system; I guess, this is final state of *Samādhi*: is this correct?



**\[2\] Vimal**:What is the difference between parmātman (the name of the 4th state) and God?



**Padiyath**: Since I've explained what is Samādhi above, Paramātman, is not a state of the fourth type as defined by you. Paramātman is Param Atman meaning The Supreme Swaroopa which is encompassing the swaroopa of everything. What is it or definition of it is विधितात् अविधिदात् अधि। meaning beyond the known and the unknown. It is the very nature or swaroopa of Knowledge. Since it cannot be defined in direct means, the Upanishads use both positive and negative indicators. For example,



नान्तःप्रज्ञं नबहिःप्रज्ञं नोभयतःप्रज्ञं नप्रज्ञानघनं नप्रज्ञं नाप्रज्ञम् ।

अदृश्यमव्यवहार्यमग्राह्यमलक्षणमचिन्त्यमव्यपदेश्यमेकात्मप्रत्ययसारं

प्रपञ्चोपशमं शान्तं शिवमद्वैतं चतुर्थं मन्यन्ते स आत्मा स विज्ञेयः ॥ ७ ॥ Mandukya Upanishad 7 verse.



It is not that which is conscious of the inner (subjective) world, nor that which is conscious of the outer (objective) world, nor that which is conscious of both, nor that which is a mass of consciousness. It is not simple consciousness nor is It unconsciousness. It is unperceived, unrelated, incomprehensible, uninferable, unthinkable and indescribable. The essence of the Consciousness manifesting as the self in the three states. It is the cessation of all phenomena; It is all peace, all bliss and non—dual. This is what is known as the Fourth (Turiya). This is Atman and this has to be realized.



Here the fourth does not mean a fourth state but since it is not any of the three but the substratum for the three and different from it, hence called the fourth. Here the word Atma and Paramātman are used similar to a drop of water and the water present in all universe.



While the God in (nowhere similar to the western religious concepts) here is similar to the power of water which is present in the drop and the ocean, where the enormity of both varies. While the quality of both being same the power of executive strength differs. The Jeeva (individual) creates his dream world the Ishwara is the creator of the Whole. Both Ishwara and Jeeva in essence being the same but differs in power. A tsunami cannot be brought out by a tea cup.



**Vimal**: I agree that 1pp-mental aspect experiences are private and ineffable even in our regular wakeful conscious state. \[1pp: 1^(st) person perspective, 3pp: 3^(rd) pp). To experience what it is, we need to attain NS-state; nobody can describe it for us; even they describe, we may not understand, most probably we might misunderstand it: is this correct?

  

My point is, from bottom-up approach (*potentiality* to *realization* over 13.72 billion years of co-evolution of physical and mental aspects), the highest degree of manifestation of Brahman is NS-state. I call this state *Paramātman* based on *Vedāntic* example of two birds sitting very close to each other in us, one is *ātman* and other is *Paramātman*; this is my understanding based on the book ((Jagadguru Rāmabhadrāchārya, 2000h).p33-40: ShvetAshvataropaniṣadi VishisTAdvaitaparkam \[Commentary\] ) written by one of current scholars (Padma Vibhushan Jagadguru Rāmabhadrāchārya PhD, DLitt) in *cit-acit* *Viśi**ṣṭādvaita.*



**\[3\] Vimal**: Your Q:What are the various sub-states of 4th (samādhi) state?



**Padiyath**: I'm not an expert in Yogasutra system, but to my little knowledge the four stages are called Sa-beeja, Nir-beeja, Savikalpaka and Nirvikalpaka. You may refer to books of Yogasutra for details. (Incidentally I do not practice it).



**Vimal**: Is Nirvikalpaka Samādhi the highest state?



**\[4\] Vimal**:What are the problems of TD (top-down) and BU?



**Padiyath**: The problems are almost common for both. As I had mentioned in my earlier mail, it is from where you think you are and where to go from there. Basic issues are two: non-apprehension and mis-apprehension. In the absence of right knowledge and when a sense of experience enters your cognitive state, there is bound to be the mis-apprehension of the input. These two together is called Avidya.So in the TD approach one presumes that creation has happened and trying to find out the cause effect then, the two above can guide his thoughts and send his investigation to the misguided slot. Where as in BU you start from what is the current state of mine, what am I? Or who am I? What is the nature of what I'm experiencing, etc. Here there is no hypotheses. You start from the known to find if what is known is truly what they are or are they appearance or is there something hidden beyond the seen etc? I prefer this as I've a workable lab within myself.



पराञ्चि खानि व्यतृणत्स्वयम्भूस्तस्मात्पराङ् पश्यति नान्तरात्मन् ।  
कश्चिद्धीरः प्रत्यगात्मानमैक्षदावृत्तचक्षुरमृतत्वमिच्छन् ॥ १ ॥ Katopanishad 2.4.1

The sense organs are created for sensing outer world not the inner Self. Some hero sees the inner Self when he turns his vision inward.



So the real bottom is not what we consider as tangible but The real bottom of all issues, which are non-apprehension and mis-apprehension.
They are non-tangible with our current cognitive apparatus.



**Vimal**: BU is also my approach and the *Dvi-Pakṣa Advaita* (extended dual-aspect monism, eDAM) is based on this. We have robust reproducible two sources of data: 1pp (such as our experiences) and 3pp (its neural basis using EEG, functional MRI, etc) for the same state of mind-brain system. Based on this, I proposed the eDAM framework, in which a state of mind-brain system has inseparable 1pp-mental aspect and 3pp-physical aspect, where the degrees of the manifestation of aspects vary with entity-state. For example, at awake conscious state the degree of manifestation of both aspects are high and in deep-sleep state, the degree of manifestation of mental aspect or consciousness is very low. In inert system, mental aspect is latent.





##### [Sunil bhattacharjya]() (7/16/16)

All the Jijnashas, which led to the evolving of the different branches of  
Indian philosophy at different levels, save the Vedanta, arose out of the  
mankind's quest for the end of the miseries of life, The Vedantists on the  
other hand, however, went ahead of the jijnashas of the other branches of  
Indian philosophy and solely concentrated on the bliss (Ananda) of the  
"Chidananda Roopah Shivo'ham Shivo'ham", as the goal, being guided by the  
Vedanta. Vedanta teaches that Brahman is everything and the so-called  
creation is not anything that Brahman has created using outside materials  
but that is Brahman's own web-making process, which Brahman takes back and  
forth. Thus there is no permanent duality in Brahman, the so-called duality  
is nothing but an aberration. The Advaitins follow this fundamental  
criterion, which many dvaitins do not seem to appreciate this. This  

parading difference is always to be kept in mind by anybody discussing  
Advaita versus the other branches of Indian philosophy.

##### Vimal

I agree that that Brahman is non-dual entity, but as you acknowledged that matter-in-itself arises from Brahman’s own ‘web-making process’. Therefore, a state of *Brahman* must be dual-aspect entity with *inseparable* mental and physical aspects. In this framework (the eDAM), matter-in-itself can arise from its physical aspect and experiences from its mental aspect as to some extent in *cit-acit* *Viśi**ṣṭādvaita* (Ramānujāchārya: 1017-1137 AD: mind (*cit*) and matter (*acit*) are adjectives/aspects of *Brahman*).

Cheers!

  

Kindest regards,

Ram
