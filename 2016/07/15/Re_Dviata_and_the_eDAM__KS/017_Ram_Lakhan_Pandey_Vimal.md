Respected vidwan Sunil ji,

  

Thanks for the critical comments.

  

***[Sunil bhattacharjya]() (7/18/16)***

That is what I wanted to point out to you. The subject of paramarthika in Advaita is beyond the reach of neuro-science, not only now, it will remain so in future. So comparing advaita and looking at it through the eyes of neuro-scientific experiments would not be sound. It is better that neuro-scientists realize the limitation of theirs.

It should have been better if you would have given your reply as to how‘chair-in-itself’ (not its appearance) is derived from the non-dual*Brahman*in neuro-science.Comparing neuro-science to advaita is blasphemous. Lord Krishna gave the Bhagavad Geetopadeshais a yoga-yukta state. If you are keen to have experience from the spiritual domain, you have to follow the yogic discipline as given in the yogashastra under a guru to achieve spiritual progress and proper understanding of the spiritual matters.

As you might know that the dominant metaphysics of neuroscience or any science in general is usually materialism. However, I am not a materialist, I am dual-aspect monist. My framework is the extended dual-aspect monism (eDAM), which is also called *Dvi-Pak**ṣa Advaita*,^(^(\[i\])) and I interpret all scientific data including neuroscience in the eDAM framework.



As per *Dvi-Pak**ṣa Advaita*, the matter-in-itself is mind-independent reality (MIR), which strictly speaking, is unknown to us because for knowing anything mind is necessary. However, whatever matter-in-itself may be, it is a part of physical aspect of a state an entity. \[Here, ‘mind’ is a western term and includes all mental entities that are form 1^(st) person perspective.\]



Both physical and mental aspects of a state of an entity co-evolve. Therefore, matter-in-itself co-evolved from the physical aspect of the dual-aspect unmanifested state of primal entity (*Brahman*); its inseparable mental aspect is latent to us. In mind-dependent reality (MDR), we experience the appearance of matter.



Similarly, as per *Dvi-Pak**ṣa Advaita*, consciousness-in-itself, in my view, is also MIR-entity, and hence, strictly speaking, it is unknown to us. Presumably, Samādhi state minimizes the effect of mind, we might try to know to some extent MIR.



My understanding on *Śankarāchārya*’s *Advaita* is that it seems close to idealism, where mind is fundamental entity and matter is derived from it in terms of its appearance; it rejects matter-in-itself; this is a serious problem.



This is one of the reasons why *cit-acit Viśi**ṣṭādvaita* (qualified non-dualism) was proposed by *Ram**ānujāchārya*, which is close to *Dvi-Pak**ṣa Advaita*, as per Jagadguru Rāmabhadrāchārya (personal meeting on 23^(rd) Dec 2011 night in Chitrakoot Ashram).



I am NOT trying to compare Advaita with materialistic neuroscience to conclude materialism based neuroscience is better. This is because, in my view, materialism, idealism/Advaita, and all other metaphysics have serious problems as elaborated in [(Vimal, 2010d)](http://sites.google.com/site/rlpvimal/Home/2010-Vimal-DefineC-LVCR-3-2.pdf) and [(Vimal, 2012c)](http://sites.google.com/site/rlpvimal/Home/2016-Vimal-Scientific-Hinduism-Bringing-Science-and-Hinduism-closer-eDAM-5-4-book.pdf). In my view, it is good idea to criticize religions, science, and everything else because criticism helps further research. Consistent with Swami Vivekananda, we must not take anything for granted because blind-belief is the dead-end. Therefore, criticism on the eDAM is most welcome; this is how it will become better; the same is also true for Advaita, Gita, and all scriptures in all religions. Therefore, the term ‘blasphemous’ is not appropriate in research, in my view.



As per [(Sridhar, 2012)](http://www.indiacause.com/blog/2012/12/31/the-two-realities-vyavaharika-and-paramarthika/), “The Vyavaharika state refers to the Dual (Dwaita) state of reference. Most people understand the Universe from this plane. They perceive the duality of object and the subject. There is the world (Jagat) and there is Individual (Jiva) and the God (Ishwara) all separate. The Paramarthika state refers to the Absolute Non-dual (Advaita) state of reference, where only Brahman/Atman is. There is no difference between God or Individual or the world. The former is a temporary and relative state of existence whereas the latter is the absolute-permanent state of existence. Sage Yajnavalkya while discussing with his wife Maitreyi about the nature of this Cosmos says ... Where the Duality is present, there one can smell the fragrance, one can speak to others, one can listen to others, one will pay respect to others, and one can think and understand. But, where there is only Atman everywhere, what will he smell? Whom will he ask? What will he listen to? Whom will he pay respect to? What will he think about and understand?”



It is unclear in Paramarthika how matter-in-itself is derived from *Brahman* if a state of *Brahman* is not a dual-aspect entity. This is major problem. Please appreciate the problem. In *cit-acit Viśi**ṣṭādvaita *and *Dvi-Pak**ṣa Advaita*, a state of *Brahman* is a dual-aspect entity; therefore, there is no such problem as elaborated above.

  

Cheers!

  

Kindest regards,

\[i\] The extended dual-aspect monism(eDAM,*Dvi-Pak**ṣa Advaita Vedānta*) is a middle way (between materialism and idealism) framework. The eDAM is elaborated in (Vimal, [2008b](http://sites.google.com/site/rlpvimal/Home/2010-Vimal-PE-SE-classical-quantum-LVCR.pdf), [2010c](http://sites.google.com/site/rlpvimal/Home/2013-Vimal-Matching-Selection-LVCR-3-1.pdf), [2013](http://sites.google.com/site/rlpvimal/Home/2012-Vimal-Emergence-UMBW-CUP.pdf), [2015f](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.1.1587.9124), [2015g](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.1.1974.3445)), an e-book
[(Vimal, 2012b)](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/2.1.1982.0485) for Hinduism and another e-book [(Vimal, 2012a)](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/2.1.1471.5847) for other religions.



In the (eDAM), a state of our mind-brain system has *inseparable* 1pp-mental aspect (such as subjective experience redness when a trichomat looks at a ripe tomato) and 3pp-physical aspects (such as brain’s visual area V8-neural-network and its activities related to redness). The degree of the manifestation of aspects from primal entity (*Brahman*) varies with the level of states of our mind-brain system. \[1pp: 1^(st) person perspective and 3pp: 3^(rd) pp\]. We have assumed that, in Nature, the subjective experiences *potentially* co-exist with its *inseparable* physical aspect. Here, the 1pp-mental aspect consists of superposed *potential* basis-states related to the *potential* primary irreducible subjective experiences (SEs) representing the co-existence of the *potentiality* of experiences for us. A specific SE is *realized* by the matching and selection mechanism (see below). In other words, there are two robust reproducible sources of information 1pp and 3pp in our wakeful conscious life; this is empirical data that we need to explain how are they linked. In the eDAM, the *doctrine of inseparability* of aspects tightly links these two sources of data.



The eDAM uses dual-mode and the matching and selection mechanisms to connect qualia/subjective experience (SE, such as redness when a trichromat views a ripe tomato) to neurons: this is discussed in [(Vimal, 2010)](http://sites.google.com/site/rlpvimal/Home/2013-Vimal-Matching-Selection-LVCR-3-1.pdf). Briefly, there are two modes: stimulus-dependent-feed-forward-signals-related-extrinsic-mode and cognitive-feedback-signals-related-intrinsic-mode. They interact for conjugate matching and then the selection of a specific subjective experience occurs and experienced by the self [(Bruzzo & Vimal, 2007)](http://sites.google.com/site/rlpvimal/Home/2007-Bruzzo-Vimal-self-JIN-p541-566.pdf).



For experiencing a specific SE, there are three major interacting signals: (i) stimulus-dependent feed forward (FF) signals, (ii) stimuli-related-memory-dependent cognitive feedback (FB) signals, and (iii) self-related signal that is a part of reentrant FB signals. The *potential* SEs are embedded as memory traces in FB signals during developmental period.



The self (a) is the subjective experience of subject [(Bruzzo & Vimal, 2007)](http://sites.google.com/site/rlpvimal/Home/2007-Bruzzo-Vimal-self-JIN-p541-566.pdf), (b) consists of proto-self, core-self, and autobiographical-self (Damasio, 2010), and (c) is the 1pp-mental aspect of a state of ‘self-related neural network (such as cortical and subcortical brain-stem midline structures: (Northoff, 2014; Northoff & Bermpohl, 2004)) and its activities (intrinsic activities).



The matching/interaction is between FF and FB signals (or mode if we use QED); then the self-related signals/modes interact with the resultant signal/mode representing the matching between stimulus-related FF signal/mode and cognitive FB signals/mode; thus, there are interactions between the three major signals/modes; this interactive process can be called as ‘the specific SE is selected and experienced by the self’.



The eDAM (extended dual-aspect monism) is NOT interactive substance dualism thathas many problems. The physical aspect of a state of an entity includes both its appearance and its intrinsic nature (entity-in-itself).



The 3pp-appearance of matter (such as color related V8-NN and its activities) and matter-in-itself (such as V8-NN-in-itself) are *inseparable* and are parts of physical aspect of a state of an entity (such as V8-NN for color). This physical aspect is *inseparable* with 1pp-mental aspect (such as the experience redness when a trichromat views a ripe-tomato) of the same state of the same entity (such as V8-NN for color). Therefore, the eDAM is a monist framework because of the doctrine of *inseparability*. In dualism, aspects and/or sub-aspects are separable, for example, mind and matter can exist independently but they can interact; this metaphysics has serious problems.



In any case, we cannot ignore 99.99… % of our universe that we cannot ‘see’ or we do not know; they are also the manifestation of primal entity. I completely agree with idealists that all sciences and philosophy and everything we do in daily lives are in wakeful consciousness in mind-dependent reality (MDR).



We, as physicists, usually make models (such as relativity, QM, string theory, Standard Model such as mass, charge, spin of [17 elementary particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model), QFT and so on) in MDR and *assume* that they are for mind-independent reality (MIR) once we have some consensus. We do not know the intrinsic nature of matter-in-itself (although we have postulated mass, charge, spin of [17 elementary particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model) as their intrinsic nature) and consciousness-in-itself (Universal potential Consciousness: UpC), but we try our best in MDR to assume they might be for MIR. We have hypothesized that experiences (such as redness, greenness, blueness, and so on) are quantized (Hameroff, email communication on 3/6/16) as excitations of UpC, in analogy to elementary particles are quantized modes of excitations of quantum field.



In my view, fundamental reality is dual-aspect potential field from which both physical and mental aspects co-arise, co-evolve and co-develop and they co-exist and are *inseparable*; same reality but with two *inseparable* aspects: mental and physical.



One could argue that what ways the doctrine of*inseparability*different from the identity theory, eliminativism, emergentism of materialism.



Materialists want to either eliminate experiences or try to create experiences from non-experiential matter (such as brain). Thus, they have serious problem: how can they eliminate experiences when they are the main source of empirical reproducible 1pp-data? Or how can they create experiences from non-experiential matter that does not have a single trace of experience. The identity theory and emergentism of materialism have serious problem simply because their matter is non-experiential. An analogy: there is no way we can create oranges from apple seeds that do not have a single trace of orange.



In the eDAM, we use alternative definition of matterthat has*potentiality*of experiences and framed it in dual-aspect language to avoid category mistake. We postulate that a state of an entity has*inseparable*mental and physical aspect. The degree of manifestation of aspects varies with entity.



There are two concepts of matter:



(i) First, the Yājñavalkya-Bādarāyaņa-Aristotle’s concept of matter, where matter has rūpa/form and has the *potentiality* for experiences (Pereira Jr., 2013; Radhakrishnan, 1960; Swami Krishnananda, 1983); it is used in our frameworks (Pereira Jr., 2013; Pereira Jr., Vimal, & Pregnolato, 2015; Vimal, 2013).



(ii) Second, the Kaṇāda-Democritus’ concept of matter (who identifies matter with atoms/particles), which implies that matter is non-experiential (Vimal, 2015); it is used in science (such as physics, chemistry, and biology).



The second concept misleads materialistic biologists who make grave mistake of following *non-experiential* materialism that has serious unsolvable problems and hence cannot address the hard problem of consciousness [(Chalmers, 1995)](http://consc.net/papers/facing.html) because it does not explain about life, especially how experiences arise from non-experiential matter. Biologists who follow Yājñavalkya-Bādarāyaņa-Aristotle’s concept of matter should not have such problems.



It is very simple, you want to create experience from brain; brain as matter must have *potential* for creating experiences, otherwise how can brain create experiences out of ‘nothing’. For example, apple seeds have *potential* to create apple tree; that is why apples can be created from apple-seeds.



To sum up, let us make sure that we cannot create experiences from non-experiential non-mental matter that does not even have a single trace of *potentiality*of experiences. We cannot create apple out of orange seeds.



By the way, once you accept Yājñavalkya-Bādarāyaņa-Aristotle’s concept of matter, then you are no more materialist; you are dual-aspect.



The frameworks, such as the extended Dual-Aspect Monism (eDAM), that follow first concept of matter do not face such problems [(Vimal, 2015)](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.1.1974.3445).
