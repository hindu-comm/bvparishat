Respected Ram,

Since Sri Vinodji, has given enlightened answers on your samadhi related doubts and he may be able to explain specific questions about it. My knowledge is limited.

  

Addressing your 1st-pp and 3rd-pp perspective to find out the consciousness-matter duality, it will never be possible to come to a defenition and parameters of it for measuring. In both cases one should understand even in 3rd-pp, the narrator explains it from his 1st-pp (remember Schrödinger's cat?) whichall of us know is a coded information based on his encodification of his sensory inputs and its effect as memory in his recalling that memory to calibrate what he is presently evaluating.

  

Take for example of sweetness the same measure of sugar will give two levels of sweerness to two different individuals. Then what to talk about inner feelings emotions or non tangible subjects. Another example which was asked to my friend by a small kid, why are you teaching English when this class is about mathematics? Just because he was introducing (a+b)(a+b)=......... See the perception of the child was anything written in alphabetical has to be English.

  

Measuring of brain waves, to me, is no different from using the same to measure biceps or calf muscles. Both measure only signals in one input of electrical and the fatigue experienced by the organ, it is no way measuring the thoughts, the quality and quantity of thoughts forget about the consciousness driving those thoughts. Even a man on controlled oxygen input in a biped machine can be made to give out alpha to gamma waves when you monitor and regulate the percentage of the oxygen absorbtion in his blood. He may slip from hallucination to delirium to coma.

  

These are scientific excercises with only known parameters and available equipments. One cannot conclude it is all comprehensive. They may have their uses and advantages in fieldwork of physiological applications.

Then there are some who are trying to extrapolate metaphysics so that they can meet up with spiritual evaluation. Like the Hollographic Universe (Micheal Talbot), Tao of Physics (Fritjof Capra) etc.

Let me explain how Vedanta approach these. All scientific research is acceptable in their respective realm. But still it being an act in the waking world it will be conditioned by the rules of that state of mind and intellect, space and time etc. Which is limited in its prowess. Plus the following aspect which, I do not know if you agree or not.

All that we know is in a intermingled state of object-subject duality, matter-consciousness complex. Sri Sankaracharya in his opening commentary to Brahma sutra explains it clearly. Plus Sri Sureshwaracharya in his Vartika to Brhadaranyaka gives a beautiful narration of the same.

  

निश्शेष अनात्मतत्हेतु निराकरणवत्मना आत्मत्वं आत्मना सिध्येत्। न अन्यशेषं अनात्मवत्।

Here the two are called Atma and Anatma, Chit and Jada. The Jada is always intermingled with Chit in both waking and dream. The term used is TADATMYAM. The Jada cannot be known unless it is in in the intermingled state. And no one can separate them physically. Even we are so identified with our body to the extend we transact with the inert body with the life in it but while transacting treat it as unified one. Same is the case with any object. The only example when we remain in our Atma swaroopa is in the deep sleep where these intermingled experience is nullified. Here again it is only everyone's 1st-pp experience. But when we are shifted to that state of Consciousness, the intermingled experience goes thru a process of understanding where we no more see only the Jada but it's Atma too. There we will be identified with the Atma of the Jada and that of this body which till now I was calling as we are the same. The Jada will loose it's apparent independent existance which it was borrowing from the Atma till then and projecting as it's. The Jada manifest Atma for its existence, also without Jada Atma remains in the unmanifested state.

It's not easy to give the detailed explanation in emails and group mails. One will need to get into the depth of the analytical approach to gather finer details of it.

  

Regards,

  

Aurobind
