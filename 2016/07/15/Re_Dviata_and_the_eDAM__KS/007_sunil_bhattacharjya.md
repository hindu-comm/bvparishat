Dear Ramji,  
  

All the Jijnashas, which led to the evolving of the different branches of Indian philosophy at different levels, save the Vedanta, arose out of the mankind's quest for the end of the miseries of life, The Vedantists on the other hand, however, went ahead of the jijnashas of the other branches of Indian philosophy and solely concentrated on the bliss (Ananda) of the "Chidananda Roopah Shivo'ham Shivo'ham", as the goal, being guided by the Vedanta. Vedanta teaches that Brahman is everything and the so-called creation is not anything that Brahman has created using outside materials but that is Brahman's own web-making process, which Brahman takes back and forth. Thus there is no permanent duality in Brahman, the so-called duality is nothing but an aberration. The Advaitins follow this fundamental criterion, which many dvaitins do not seem to appreciate this. This paradign difference is always to be kept in mind by anybody discussing Advaita versus the other branches of Indian phlosophy.  
  

Regards,
