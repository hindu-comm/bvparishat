Respected Ram,

In the Vedic tradition, there are many approach what are called "prakriyas" both TD and BU are admitted and in both cases the end result is the same. The qualities of the student or inquirer determines the approach. In both the fundamental principles remain same.

First, understand where you stand before taking the first step.

Second, set your goal with well defined parameters and clarity of the goal in order to recognise that you have reached the goal. It should not be stage by stage.

Thrid, if you do not have the knowledge of how to go about then approach an established one in the final goal. Here no one can evaluate the preceptor, but the teachings will give the indication of what you are looking is being delivered.

Lastly, in this tradition your journey is your own and the preceptor can show you the methodology but cannot walk with you.

  

Having said the approach, the tradition do not look down up on any approach inferior to others. They truly appreciate the mental state and learning potential of the individual.

  

Coming to your reply, the last line "The bottom-up (potential unmanifested state to full manifestation) entails the highest manifestation of Brahman is the final stage of Samādhi state (4th state), which is called parmātman/God." Is another approach in that process explained in the Mandukya Upanishad and Karika. Only difference is that the fourth is not a state as in samadhi, but the substratum(Turiyam) where in all the other states pulsate. Like the canvas for a cinema to appear. Samadhi is not a permanent state and one will have vithanam or waking up from it brining it back to the earlier state from where he entered it. Where as once The Knowledge of Turiya dawns it can be never deprived. Just as once anything is known it will never remain as unknown.

Paramatman and God are not the same even though in modern times they are used interchangeably.

  

Finally there will be as many approach to cater for each aspirer. None is superior or inferior to the other.

  

Regards,

  

Aurobind
