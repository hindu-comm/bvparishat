Respected vidwan Srinivas ji,

  

Thanks for excellent comments.

  

**\[1\] Kotekal**: Sorry, Dvaita does not \*assumes\* per se. Three entities on its ontological map is based on epistemological evidence. I hope you know the difference between "assumption" and "pramANa". Also, your characterization of them as "independent entities" is not correct. Brahman is only the independent or what shAstra says "sva-tantra". Here the prefix "sva" stands for self same. Whereas other two categories are "para-tantra". Here the prefix "para" stands for "other" or other than these two categories, which is nothing but Brahman. Hence jīva and material are the para-tantra or dependent realities.The term "Dvaita" was based on high level classification of 'Independent' and 'Dependent'. Not on the number of classes per se.



**Vimal**: Thanks for the correcting my misunderstandings. This means jīva-s and matter are derived from *Brahman*; kindly elaborate the precise underlying mechanisms of the derivation. Furthermore, it is monism. Therefore, to avoid misnaming and confusion, can we also call it *Madhvāchārya*’s*** ****Advaita*? In addition, what ways it differs from *Śankarāchārya’s* *Advaita*.



**\[2\] Vimal**: Innumerable Jada-s (non-living entities): “The epistemological source for Jada matter is sense perception (*pratyaksha*)”; this is true, but it is based on the ‘appearance’ of classical inert matter-in-itself in mind-dependent reality, where term ‘mind’ is western term that includes all mental entities, such as our subjective experiences, self, thoughts and so on. For example, when we look at chair, we experience its appearance. In mind-independent reality, we do not know what the chair-in-itself is; we cannot reject its existence even though we do not have direct perception.



**Kotekal**: What about 'mind' itself? Is it independent reality? or yet again known only via mind itself? If former, then it is anti-thesis, for itself is its counter example. If latter, then you are on your way to infinite regress. Dvaita is a realist school. There is no reason to assume a 'chair-appearance' may not correspond to actual 'chair' out there. This is the foundation of classical epistemological position of 'intrinsic-validity' (pramANya-svatatsvaM). This position alone is valid position. Opposite position of pramANya-parataH is found to be flawed (infinite regress to be specific).



**Vimal**: The definition and the status of ‘mind’ depend on the metaphysics. In the *Dvi-Pak**ṣa Advaita* (extended dual-aspect monism, eDAM)^(^(\[i\])), it is neither. In the eDAM, a state of an entity has *inseparable* 1pp-mental and 3pp-physical aspects. The degree of manifestation of aspects from unmanifested state of primal entity (*Brahman*) varies with entity. \[1pp: 1^(st) person perspective which is private, 3pp: 3^(rd) pp which is for public.\]



The terms ‘realist’ and ‘reality’ need to be predefined before using them to avoid confusion. In Classical physics, they refer to the reality when there are no human observers; therefore, I call it MIR (mind-independent reality). For example, theory and models in classical mechanics is for MIR although all the models are derived from physicists’ 1pp-mental aspect. In quantum physics, some of the interpretations are for MIR and some for MDR (mind-dependent reality).



Thus, the appearance of classical object chair-in-itself is related to MDR. You can assume (if you want!) that it is also for MIR. However, strictly speaking MIR is unknown (see Kant’s noumenon, thing-in-itself); however, we cannot reject MIR.



When you claim that *Dvaita* is a realist school, then you are implicitly assuming MDR. So called "pramANa" has built-in illusion (*māyā*) because it is observer-dependent. Let us take an example, when a trichromat looks at a ripe-tomato, she will report experiencing redness, however, when an achromat looks it, whatever she reports will be dark-grey for trichromats. Thus, how could we decide what is the true reality of ripe-tomato? Thus, “pramANa” fails.



**\[3\] Vimal**: Innumerable jīva-s (living entities) are also based on appearance but of our kind. Since we feel that we have alive and have jīva, so other humans are also like us, and also animals, birds, plants and so on. Who is ‘I’? This is based on our own feeling that I exist; so I extrapolate myself to you that you also exist like me.



**Kotekal**: Your position is not correct. Although you have a sense of 'I', it does not mean it is post-death persisting entity and the same entity Vedantins consider as 'Jīva'.Dvaita's concept of 'Jīva' is based on textual evidence, not on perceptual evidence.



**Vimal:** By textual evidence, I guess, you mean scriptural evidence based on *Vedas*, which is presumably derived from *Samādhi* state experiences: is this correct? However, *Samādhi* state experiential knowledge has significant subjective biases: for example, consider Buddhism and Jainism vs. Vedas. Therefore, we cannot take textual evidence for granted in our scientific researches. We need to introduce scientific empirical evidence, such as the two main sources of data: 1pp (our private subjective experiences, such as redness) and 3pp (brain neural network and its activities measured for public say using functional MRI, such as color-related visual areas in our brain) reproducible data.



**\[4\] Vimal**: Single Brahman is the extrapolation of our wakeful consciousness/experiences and conjecture that some entity higher than us exist who created this universe.



**Kotekal**: This is subjective opinion, which may or may not have objective reality to it. Dvaita's conception of 'Brahman' is based on textual evidence who's validity is quite objective. Discussion of how Veda is valid objectively is whole another big topic and we can reserve for another day. But it is suffice to say at least Dvaita claims objective validity to Vedas. So also whatever such Vedas say about Brahman and Jivas.



**Vimal**: We need to predefine the term ‘objective’ to avoid confusion. For me, ‘objective’ means that related to MIR from 3pp, and ‘subjective’ means MDR from 1pp. I would be very interested how *Veda*s are valid objectively (in MIR, for public), similar to objectivity in classical physics. So far, my understanding is *Vedic* knowledge is *samādhi* state based private subjective knowledge from 1pp which varies with the subjects (accomplished yogis with *nirvikalpa samādhi*, I guess, final state of *samādh*i as per Vinod Sehgal).



**\[5\] Vimal**: One can also argue that *jīva*-s and *Brahman* are based on*Samādhi*state knowledge as elaborated in*Veda*s.



**Kotekal**: In fact, Veda is a primary source. Any experience one might have needs to validated against Veda and decide whatever one is having is whether really objective truth or just another case of hallucination.



**Vimal**: It is very risky in scientific researches. Even enlightened people such as Swami Vivekananda advises not to take anything for granted! Just compare Buddhism/Jainism vs Vedas; they have contradictory knowledge; which one to believe?



**\[6\] Vimal**: There are many models, so how to select one of them. There are model selection criteria. For example, when we try to find relationship/interaction between the three independent entities, *Dvaita*’s problems starts. If any of them interact, they will certainly make the serious category mistakes: such as interactions between *jīva*and matter,*jīva*and*Brahman*, and*Brahman*and matter. Therefore,*Dvaita*is untenable unfortunately.



**Kotekal**: Your premise itself is wrong here. You assume they are independent in their interaction. But in reality, it is Brahman Who enables and empowers these interactions. For example, Jīva is not independent in comprehending knowledge of a matter, say a chair. It is Brahman who is enabler for this to happen via various agencies, such as associating Jīva with material body/brain etc.



**Vimal**: I agree that I misunderstood your first posting related to 3 entities; thanks for clarifying them. Please elaborate precisely how matter and jīva-s are derived from *Brahman* in step-by-step manner that can make sense to a neuroscientist? This seems top-down (Brahman was manifested to full form from beginning) God theory approach: is this correct? The *Dvi-Pak**ṣa Advaita *is just opposite, the bottom-up approach (from *potentiality* to realization which took about 13.72 billion years after Big Bang), which is consistent with science.**



**\[7\] Vimal:** The*Dvi-Pakṣa Advaita*(the eDAM) does not such problems and is the least problematic metaphysics.



**Kotekal**: Although I have not studied eDAM fully, but I am inclined to say it is rehash of Dvaita only. In Dvaita, Brahman is advitiya and independent. Brahman alone is enabler of all interactions. Other two dependents are on receiving side of this enablement. So, two our two broad categories of Independent-Dependent are equivalent of your "Dvi-Pakṣa". I will study more of eDAM and comment on that.



**Vimal**: I am not sure it is the rehash of Dvaita. I used to think, it is close to or an extension of *cit-acit Viśi**ṣṭādvaita* (qualified non-dualism, *Ramānujāchārya*: 1017–1137) and *Kashmir Shaivism* (860–925 AD). However, if both have used top-down approach, then it is not because I used bottom-up approach similar to science. Please study *Dvi-Pak**ṣa Advaita* (the eDAM) very carefully; its 5 components are discussed in 5 articles.^(^(\[ii\])) I will be very happy to clarify if you have any question.

  

Cheers!

  

Kindest regards,

Ram

\[i\] The extended dual-aspect monism(eDAM,*Dvi-Pak**ṣa Advaita Vedānta*) is a middle way (between materialism and idealism) framework. The eDAM is elaborated in (Vimal, [2008b](http://sites.google.com/site/rlpvimal/Home/2010-Vimal-PE-SE-classical-quantum-LVCR.pdf), [2010c](http://sites.google.com/site/rlpvimal/Home/2013-Vimal-Matching-Selection-LVCR-3-1.pdf), [2013](http://sites.google.com/site/rlpvimal/Home/2012-Vimal-Emergence-UMBW-CUP.pdf), [2015f](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.1.1587.9124), [2015g](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.1.1974.3445)), an e-book
[(Vimal, 2012b)](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/2.1.1982.0485) for Hinduism and another e-book [(Vimal, 2012a)](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/2.1.1471.5847) for other religions. The eDAM is summarized in Section 4 of [(Vimal, 2016b)](http://sites.google.com/site/rlpvimal/Home/2016-Vimal-eDAM-Metaphysics-LVCR-8-2.pdf) and Section 1 of [(Vimal, 2015b)](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.1.2326.6008).



\[ii\]In the (eDAM), a state of our mind-brain system has *inseparable* 1pp-mental aspect (such as subjective experience redness when a trichomat looks at a ripe tomato) and 3pp-physical aspects (such as brain’s visual area V8-neural-network and its activities related to redness). The degree of the manifestation of aspects from primal entity (*Brahman*) varies with the level of states of our mind-brain system. \[1pp: 1^(st) person perspective and 3pp: 3^(rd) pp\]. We have assumed that, in Nature, the subjective experiences *potentially* co-exist with its *inseparable* physical aspect. Here, the 1pp-mental aspect consists of superposed *potential* basis-states related to the *potential* primary irreducible subjective experiences (SEs) representing the co-existence of the *potentiality* of experiences for us. A specific SE is *realized* by the matching and selection mechanism (see below). In other words, there are two robust reproducible sources of information 1pp and 3pp in our wakeful conscious life; this is empirical data that we need to explain how are they linked. In the eDAM, the *doctrine of inseparability* of aspects tightly links these two sources of data.
