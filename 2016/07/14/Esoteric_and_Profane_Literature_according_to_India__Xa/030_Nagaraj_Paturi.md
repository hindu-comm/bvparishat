He tried to explain his intention by saying:

**Esoteric\~ Sacred**: the literature which deals with **paramArthika and laukik as in our tradition**

**Profane\~ non Sacred**\~ laukika and "**nAstika**" literature as that is all that exists, also known as **non-sacred**, in the sense of "**ChArvAk**"

  

Let us sort out things:

  

Vaidika-laukika = aastika laukika : (aastika is not theist here, aastika is with a belief in VedapraamaaNya and the existence of paralokasetc.)

  

Trivarga-oriented : interested in achieving artha andkaama through the path of dharma.

  

 Believe that achieving artha andkaama through the path of dharma leads to apoorva/puNya that leads to place in

  

 svargaloka and achieving artha andkaamaviolating the path of dharma leads to paapa that leads to place in

  

narakaloka. Belive in the cycle of births and deaths.

  

avaidika laukika = naastika-laukika:(naastika is not atheist here, naastika is without a belief in VedapraamaaNya and the existence of paralokasetc.)

  

avaidika dhaarmika laukikas : Bauddha and Jaina laukikas. Believe in dharma. Restrict / control their pleasure seeking within the bounds of dharma. Belive in the cycle of births and deaths.

  

avaidika adhaarmika laukikas : lokaayata, chaarvaaka laukikas. Do not believe in Dharma. Unrestricted/uncontrolled seeking of pleasure. Do not belive in the cycle of births and deaths.

  

Vaidika paaramaarthika : aastika paaramaarthika : interested in mokshaand moksha lokas.

  

Avaidika dhaarmika paaramaarthika : naastika paaramaarthika : interested in nirvaaNa state (no concept of mokshaloka. )

  

Avaidika adhaarmika paaramaarthikais a non-existing concept.

  

Major difference between Vaidika approach to laukika -paaramaarthika and the Avaidika dhaarmika approach to the same is that laukika as trivarga-orientedness is not scorned or looked down upon in the Vaidika tradition. Laukika isdiscouraged and paaramaarthika is prioritized inAvaidika dhaarmika traditions.
