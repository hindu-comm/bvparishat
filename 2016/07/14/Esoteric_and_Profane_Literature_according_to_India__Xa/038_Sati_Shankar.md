Dear Prof. Sastry ji,

This thread is beoming really significant, for, as you have rightly pointed, a preparatory , purva paksha. The word Profane and esoteric is common in world comparative religion literature. I used it hee in the same flow, however, for our own preparation , Adhyatmic and laukik may suffice. Secondly much damage has already been caused by Western Indologists therefore, I think we should use original Sanskrit words without making any semantic compromise combined with devnAgari script. I myself feel less confident when I make transcript from diacritical to devnagari(without using software) and look for some print in DevnAgari to compare for errors.

  

I have been observing your posts and can see your line of thought,
What is needed is a complete recast of our texts and commentaries, Important topics, but by taking smaller parts or key words and create comprehensive, complete in itself, monographs on that so gradually India can have its own modern reference library based on our own Tradition and SKS.

  

So far as this thread is concerned, for me it is one of the most important threads, I thank you all for your kind interest and contributions to it.

Regards

SS
