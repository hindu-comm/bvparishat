Namaste  
  
Getting back to Professor RNI' s basic question:  
  
Can we look at the question with focus on literature (- काव्य) where the words ' sacred' and ' profane' serves as qualifiers / filters (- विशेषण)?  
  
If the two words - sacred and profane- are taken as non- intersecting / exclusive / special classification of literature, basically by purpose they serve OR by the way they are produced OR the way they are used / abused,  
  
THEN  
  
A literature ( composition ) which facilitates is for Self-aggrandizement/ denigration of others ( अहंता वर्धक- लोकोद्वेग कारक) is profane. Example: yellow journalism of modern period ; chitra-kavya with Shabdaadamabara for poets ego boosting (- in that specific segment) is profane ( अधम). Probably the varieties of Bhaana- Dima -prahasana in Dasharoopaka varities come under profane. It is not the content or theme; but what purpose it serves to promote. There are many works in Sanskrit which can surely come under the umbrella of this categorization. Well, one can stretch the argument that the power of daivee vaak overpowers the profanity of content!  
  
There is no logical reason to take that everything humanly composed using Daivee-Vaak is sacred!  
  
Look for inputs from learned scholars.
