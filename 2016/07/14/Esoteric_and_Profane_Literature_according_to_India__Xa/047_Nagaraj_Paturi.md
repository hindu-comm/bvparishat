That for all the Vedic people, all the four purushaarthas are importantis given.

  

When we sit to classify things,particularly when things fall into a gradient or spectrum, the question is always of emphasis.

  

Rasa -centric saahitya / kaavyas can be classified on the basis of the angirasa as mentioned in my previous post.

  

These was a discussion in one of the older threads on this forum about whether Mokshe cha is included in the Vivaaha mantras involving the oath naaticharaami by the bridegroom.

  

Even among S'aastras, there is always a difference in emphasis.

  

The beauty in the Vedic tradition is balance, mutual complementarity and mutual inclusiveness between the apparent polarities. This is manifest in the diversity- centric nature of this culture as opposed to the uniformity centric cultures elsewhere.

  

trivarga -chaturthavarga

  

grihasthaas'rama - sanyaasaas'rama

  

himsaa -ahimsaa

  

etc.

  

**Blance**:

  

Equal emphasis in general on both the apparent above mentioned polarities with kaavya and s'aastra literaturediffering in emphasis.

  

**Mutual complementarity:**

  

Laukika visualized theorizedon a paaramaarthika basis and vice versa. Grihastha-sanyaasa mutual dependence. Kshatriya's himsaa and Rishi's ahimsaa being complementary to each other.

  

**Mutual inclusiveness**:

  

Bhagavadgitaexcellently articulatesthis integration.

  

It is this integration that makes Abhinavaguptapaada to view S'aanta rasa being included in the kinds of Veera rasa such as Dharmaveera.
