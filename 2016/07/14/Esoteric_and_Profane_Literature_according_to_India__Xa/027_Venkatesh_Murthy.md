There are Tantrika books describing Pancha Makaras like meat eating, sex and other habits and using them in worship. There also they are trying to give a philosophical angle to those Tantrika practices.

  

All books both Sastra and Sahitya have to finally show how it is helping us philosophically. Why? Because Indian life is always philosophical because they are after permanent happiness. Profane things will give temporary happiness only.
