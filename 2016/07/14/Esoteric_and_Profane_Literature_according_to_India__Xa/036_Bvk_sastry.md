Namaste

  

Getting back to the point of Professor Paturi- providing the dictionary meaning of Profane :

and

  

Professor Koradas response on Dharma line,

  

I agree that this is a difficult challenge. Yet it needs to to be addressed with surgical precision.

  

I request the following Clarification here:

  

1\) The word meaning of Profane is integral to the concept of ' religion/ religious'- which comes with the baggage of a scripture and theology, concept of God/s, sin et al. This is english frame of language.

  

Professor Korada has pointed to the difficulty of debating this in ' Dharma- Purushaartha- Samskruth terminology- framework and introduces to the word ' Vraatya' , from Dharma-Shaastra, which would resonate to Gita (16 to 18 chapter dealing with ashaastra vihitam- aasureem pravruttim ).

How to connect the two views in relation to literature as kaavya? - the licenscious poets composition?

  

2\. Is there any criterion to address literature in the frame work of ' vraatya' - usage ( असत्-काव्य / असद्ग्राह )and other wise ? 

  

Thanks for helping to understand the in-house challenges of Battle for Sanskrit: Poorvapasha built around three hundred years of ' English translation writings using sanskrit-english dictionaries' and ' tolerated by peaceful compassionate accommodative coexistence with Traditional standards'.
