It is a tight rope walk to talk aboutthe laukika or paaramaarthika nature ofthe Vaidika disciplines dealing with /meant for issues of day to day use, during the current times.

  

If you show their association with the paaramaarthika , they are branded as 'religious' , (hence) 'unscientific' etc. If you show their laukika relevance, and 'scientific' nature, those (not wrongly)conscious of and particular about their paaramaarthikaassociation cry for correction.

  

Let us take the example of Paniniyan VyaakaraNa itself.Looking atashTaadhyaayee and the prakriyaa (grammatical application i.e. derivation/description/analysis of language) side of it, the modernwestern linguists exclaimed , " it antedated modern linguists by millennia". They also watch with amazement the application of its methods in computational linguistics etc. But if you bring the theoretical foundations of it asarticulated in the aarthika granthas starting from their currently available fountainhead Vakyapadiyam into discussion, they , while stillexpressing their awe towards the advanced ideas (noting also how many of them antedate contemporary ideas on speech by millennia), they express their antipathy towards its, what they understand as , 'religious' foundations /objectives. Understanding the philosophical ideas of Vakyapadiyam as 'religious' is what is responsible for reading ideas such as ' Sanskrit is the origin of all languages', 'Sanskrit is the language spoken by gods' etc. , which do not exist in that book at all, into that book.
