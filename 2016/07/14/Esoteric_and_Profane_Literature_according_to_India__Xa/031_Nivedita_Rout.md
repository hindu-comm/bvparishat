Are the terms, Esoteric and profane modern terms to Indian system of Vidya and Avidya?

  

If so, it is accepted that everything in the universe is a physical manifestation of Brahman. Our traditional learning system speaks of two types of vidyas: Vidya (Vision and realization of Truth, Freedom and its expression in action) and Avidya (Untruth and Attatchment/Enjoyment), which indicates that both the vidya-s were co-existed and expounded in the Vedas, so it is said traigunyavisaya veda as Prof. Paturi reminds.
Vidya is defined as, that liberates (sa vidya ya vimuktaye), that leads to Truth, Light and Immortality (vidyayamamrtam asnute). The literature that enlightens, liberates and expresses the aspects of Divine (Truth-Beauty-Benevolence) belongs to Vidya (so traditionally, all the sastras are categorised under vidya) and the literature represents Untruth, false notions and leads to personal Enjoyment belongs to Avidya (Carvaka-teachings, Black magics through Yogic powers, some portions of Bhairava and Buddhist Vajrayana tantras). It is applicable to all other mediums of human expression.
