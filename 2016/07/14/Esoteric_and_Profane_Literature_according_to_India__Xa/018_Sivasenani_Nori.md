Sir

  

Generally Sanskrit literature can be divided as Saastra and Saahitya. Prof. Nagaraj garu already dealt with Saahitya at some length. So may be one can look at Saastra.

  

Within Saastra, let us first take up the Vedangas.

\- By definition they are Vedangas and so are Vaidika; yet, they deal with many practical aspects. Is Sikshaa to be taken as philosophical, for instance? Vyakaranam definitely is philosophical as well, in addition to being a practical science. Niruktam should be similarly qualified. In ChandaSSaastra, there is a devataa associated with every chandas - so that cannot be strictly called the profane. Within Jyotisha, some aspects might appear very mundane (like the time taken by earth to complete one revolution around the Sun), but then given the practice of performing various Saantis for Grahas, Nakshatras etc., one cannot deny the Adhyaatmika connect. DharmaSaastram similarly has a few practical aspects, but it integrates the Adhyaatmika aspects as well. However, Kalpa comprises of vast literature which is both ritual and philosophical. So, with the exception of Sikshaa, Vedangas have to considered as philosophical as well.

  

Within the Darsanas, they are all indeed philosophical. One might say that Vaiseshika is not too concerned about Adhyaatmika issues, but its atomism itself is a statement about an Adhyaatmika issue.

  

Ayurveda treats manas as the aadhaara; so if not philosophical aspects (there is a philosophical basis as well for Ayurveda), it definitely includes the psychological aspects.

  

Saastras like Vaastu and Iconography may be easier to classify as non-philosophical. The available literature pertaining to such practically useful Saastras is rather limited, but some of them - like in Music - combine a strong philosophical aspect as well.

  

So the bulk of Saastra-literature tends to be either directly philosophical, or with a strong philosophical element. I hope this helps.
