There is another interesting distinction: laukika(mundane), anaadhyaatmika alaukika (nonspiritual transcendental)and aadhyaatmika alaukika(spiritual transcendental)

  

Artistic experiences like Rasaananda (of non-S'aanta and non-Bhakti rasas) falls under anaadhyaatmika alaukika (nonspiritual transcendental)
