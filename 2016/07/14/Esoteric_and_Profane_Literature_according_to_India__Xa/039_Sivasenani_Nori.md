Sir

  

I am not a Professor. Kindly address me by name.

  

There is a book called प्रस्थानभेदः by MadhusuudanasarasvatI ([link](https://ia800304.us.archive.org/30/items/Prasthanabheda.by.Madhusudana.Sarasvati/Prasthanabheda.by.Madhusudana.Sarasvati.pdf)), which starts with the sentence - अथ सर्वेषां शास्त्राणां भगवत्येव तात्पर्यं साक्षात्परम्परया वेति समासेन तेषां प्रस्थानभेदोऽत्रोद्दिश्यते।

  

So though it shows the aadhyaatmika nature of all Saastra, it offers a comprehensive and traditional view on what Saastra teaches.

  

Regarding the query of Prof. Iyengar about examples of profane literature, one could list the books on mathematics by Bhaskaraacaarya etc., the books on Vaastu like मायामतम् and मानसारम्, historical works like Rajatarangini, books on SilpaSaastra like DevataamUrtiprakaraNam (<https://archive.org/details/dmp_rm>), and books on dance like Nrityaratnavali amongst available books. Surely there was a good understanding of the properties of iron in the classical period as evidenced by the non-rusting pillar of Sarnath etc. There must have been books available on subjects like metallurgy as well, along with the others in the 64 traditional kalas - the Mricchakatikam talks about the various shapes in which holes in walls may be made!
