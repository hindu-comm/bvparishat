There are several different models in the Vedic traditionto handle this question:

  

1\. To classify issues into Trivarga (Dharma, Artha and Kama)related and Chaturtha varga (Moksha)related.

  

If this is applied to rasavataavyas, kaavyas whose angirasa is one of the five (S'ringaara, KaruNa, Veera, Adbhuta and Haasya ) of the Eight (the other three being Raudra, Bhayaanaka and Beebhatsa) rasas fall in the trivarga domain. Kaavyas with S'aanta or Bhakti as theangirasa fall in the chaturtha varga category.

  

Even in the trivarga category, the kaarya(action) is usually to attain artha and kaama within the bounds of or following the path of dharma only. Adhikaari (target audience)is a dharmabaddha individual. That is why,dharmaviruddha s'ringaara is one of the kinds of s'ringaara rasaabhaasa ( apparent but not real s'ringaara rasa)
