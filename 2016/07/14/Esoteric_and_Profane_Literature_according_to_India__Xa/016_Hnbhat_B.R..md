Which "rasa shastra" have you in mind?

In relation to काव्य literature, Mr. Venkatesh Murthy has quoted two lines from भामहालंकार. From नाट्य literature, the verse from दशरूपक can be quoted referred to in the post of Prof.Nagaraja.

कार्यं त्रिवर्गस्तच्छुद्धमेकानाकानुबन्धि च।

origin could be traced to नाट्यशास्त्र of Bharata. Right now I do not remember the verse.
