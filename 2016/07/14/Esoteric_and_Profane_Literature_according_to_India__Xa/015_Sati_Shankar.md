Dear prof. Paturi.

Thank you very much Sir. Your help will be duly acknowledged in the writing.

  

After your reply I found references on puruSArtha to link tri-varga and charurvarga, but still looking for a link from rasa shastra

to cite a source on characteristics you have referred.

Any way thanks for your care and kind attention.

regards

SS
