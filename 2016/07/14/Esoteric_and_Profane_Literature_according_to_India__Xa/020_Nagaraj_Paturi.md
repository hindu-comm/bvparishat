Talking of S'aastras and their association with aadhyaatmika, another interesting case is that of VyaakaraNa.

  

In the Paniniyan tradition, Linguistics /Grammar is shown to be a means of spiritual practice too.

  

आसन्नं ब्रह्मणस् तस्य तपसाम् उत्तमं तपः /

प्रथमं छन्दसाम् अङ्गम् आहुर् व्याकरणं बुधाः // वाक्य\_१।११ //

  

This is not a mere religious statement about a discipline. Since speech is such a focus of study (along side mind/psyche, the subject matter of psychology and the like)that an individual is compelled to self-reflect to get agrasp of it. Such a self-reflection , introspection, antarmukhataa, as a means of spiritual saadhanaa is well established.

  

In the same book Vaakyapadeeyam, Yoga is called Aadhyaatma S'aastra. 

  

कायवाग्बुद्धिविषया यॆ मलाः समवस्थिताः / चिकित्सालक्षणाध्यात्म- शास्त्रैस् तॆषां विशुद्धयः // वाक्य\_१।१७४
