Well said; these Tantrika (which are generally called Vaamaachaara but known in the traditiona s the Veeraachaara) practices are mainly intended to transcend the dichotomy of profane and religious, laukika and paaramaarthika, allowed and prohibited \[by tradition\], etc, etc.  
In fact according to the well known Trika Tantra, VIJNANABHAIRAVA, all experiences--ordinary mundane experiences--can be utilised and transformed into 'spiritual' Siva-experience,, Sivabhaavanaa.
