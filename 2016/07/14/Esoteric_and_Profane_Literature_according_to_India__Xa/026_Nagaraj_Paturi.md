It was a coincidence! I was about to give the example of your favourite discipline Ancient Indian Astronomy, forthe need of a similar balance beam approach, you posted about 'the profane' texts.

  

Texts on Ancient Indian Astronomy too amaze modern people with the advancement of knowledge they contain. But they never forget to point out the 'religious' portions of them and never stop discounting their achievements just on this count.
