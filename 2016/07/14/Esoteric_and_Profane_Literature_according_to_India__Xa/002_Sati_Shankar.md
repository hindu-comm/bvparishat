**Esoteric\~ Sacred**: the literature which deals with **paramArthika and laukik as in our tradition**

**Profane\~ non Sacred**\~ laukika and "**nAstika**" literature as that is all that exists, also known as **non-sacred**, in the sense of "**ChArvAk**"

  

Hope this gives some hint.

Thanks for kind attention.

Regards
