Dear SriN. Siva Senani ji,

  

On "Professor" I too once felt the same after resigned from University teaching, but on moment's thought, Irealizedthat we take this word in the sense it is taken in our university system, but in every case directed to a teacher, (unfortunately, socially not a preferred profession in our so called modern society, for various reasons).

Any way here we know Professor =आचार्यः \[ācāryḥ\], \[आ-चर्-ण्यत् P.III.1.1 Vār. Kāś.\]

  

Dictionary tells:

  

A spiritual guide or preceptor, holy teacher (one who invests a boy with the sacred thread, instructs him in the Vedas &c.); उपनीय तु यः शिष्यम् वेदमध्यापयेद् द्विजः । सकल्पं सरहस्यं च तमाचार्यं प्रचक्षते Ms.2.14; cf. also आचिनोति च शास्त्रार्थं आचारे स्थापयत्यपि । स्वयमाचरते यस्तु स आचार्य इति स्मृतः ॥ read also वेदाध्यापनेन च आचार्यो भवति Ms.6.1.35;

Also

One who propounds a particular doctrine.

  

An adviser or preceptor at a sacrifice &c.  

  

An epithet of Droṇa; आचार्यमुपसंगम्य राजा वचनमब्रवीत् Bg.1.2.

  

So here at BVP most areआचार्य. 

Apologise to the rest for undefined exclusion.

  

Thank you very much for providing links, got them, valuable.

Best wishes

Regards

Sati Shankar
