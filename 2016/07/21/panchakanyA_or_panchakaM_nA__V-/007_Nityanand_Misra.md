Another argument in favour of पञ्चकं ना is that महापातकनाशनम् can be taken as an adjective of पञ्चकम् and there is no need of any अध्याहार (ellipsis).

  

With the पञ्च कन्याः स्मरेन्नित्यं महापातकनाशनम् reading, one has to read something like पञ्च कन्याः स्मरेन्नित्यं \[एतत् स्मरणं\] महापातकनाशनम्.
