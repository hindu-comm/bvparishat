\>Can some one comment why names of theses 5 women names are to be recited and how that eliminates "mahaapaatak" ?

  

-------- A precaution before I respond:

  

The verse does not talk about reciting the names, but it talks about smaraNa = remembrance of/ recollection of / reflecting on meditation on the persons (personalities) themselves.

  

Now response:

  

What ispApa or puNya was already discussed on BVP in several threads earlier. Even recently Prof. Korada explained the concept with suitable references. If I rephrase the ideas in brief pAtaka /pApa is the (usually unconscious)pain experienced by /due to theinnate ethical sensitivity (antaraatman) and the puNya is the happiness experienced by the same.

  

One of the (easily understandable) counteractions for the pain of this kind is the nityasmaraNa of the puNya guNas of the puNyaatma personalities.

  

I think I do not explain the rest in this topic.
