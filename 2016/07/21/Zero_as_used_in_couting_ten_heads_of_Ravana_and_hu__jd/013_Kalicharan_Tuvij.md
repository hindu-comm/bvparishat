नमस्ते ।  
  
Even Roman numerals are base-ten, but don't need a zero for representation. This means, zero is not related per se to numeral representation or to base-ten.  
  
Zero is not absolutely necessary for the purpose of counting, to say it in other words. One may represent the number ten by "10", "१०", "X" or some other symbol.  
  
The essence of zero lies in the existence (or the proof of it) of negative numbers. Zero helps create the "realm" of negatives. So, even if zero is not explicitly mentioned, the presence of negative numbers necessary imply the presence of zero.  
  
धन and ऋण are the words used for positive and negative numbers. These are also used in the banking/ finance system. In fact, the two implementations are one and the same. Archaeologically, we have the Indu-Saraswati seals available with us in large numbers; obviously these are the ऋण representations of some widely practised business/ banking activity.  
  
The very words धन and ऋण imply zero. Yet we also have direct understanding and mention of zero in the Veda. सीर and शुना are the deity equivalent of the idea. शून्य comes from शुना and शुन्ना, whereas "zero" comes from (in my opinion) from सीर.  
  
सीर is a female deity and सीरा / सीता is Her manifestation during the times of Ramayana.  
  
There are deeper principles involved, but I believe this is the approach that can yield the best results, including a better understanding of Sanskrit the language itself.
