Thanks Prof. Paturi for this quotation and reference. I did not have the book with me right now, and hence I could not mention this.

This is what the formula I presented at the end shows. From algorithmic point of view this is a faster algorithm to find 2^n.  

If I remember correctly, Prof. Knuth also has mentioned in his book on Algorithms about this algorithm. Again, since I do not have the book with me right now, I can not quote.
