hariH OM,

 If we ascribe discovery of zero to brahmagupta, then one finds it difficult to reconcile the shlokas of vAlmiikirAmAyaNa (kiShki 38) where the powers of ten are given and (sundara, 1) where hanumAn grows in multiples of ten yojanas to avoid being eaten by surasaa). One of these is possible:  
1. Brahmagupta was laying on record whatever was the traditional way of counting.  
2. If 1 is not true, then (i) either the shlokas are prakShipta or (ii) vAlmiiki was posterior to brahmagupta. (Pollock will love the latter proposition).

स्वस्ति,  
 भवानीभारती जयतेतमाम्,  
 श्रीवत्सः ॥
