Dear friends,

It seems there was a humorous piece in a Kannada magazine, where a student asked a question to the teacher “Aryabhata, the founder of zero, lived in the Kaliyuga, how then the people counted the 10 heads of Raavana in tretaayuga, 100 Kaurava brothers in the Mahaabhaarata and dasha, shata and sahasra in vedas (sahasraaksha, sahasrapaat, dashaangulam etc.) ? The teacher fainted.

Quoting this piece someone as asked “Is there any reasonable answer for this?”

  
I could think of the following reply. There may be better or more appropriate reply and the schlars in the list may kindly help.

Varahamihira mentioned Aryabhatta and that could be the reason why many people believe that Aryabhatta was the original writer of the Suryasidhaanta and he was the first user of "Zero", but the Suryasiddhanta itself says that Mayasura composed it around the beginning of the Treta yuga. That means Mayasura lived before the times of Ramayana and he could have been the first to introduce the "Zero". I am open to correction in this matter.  
  
As regards the ten heads of Ravana, it is said that Ravana offered his head to Lord Shiva ten times and that is why he is called Dashanan or Dashagiva. He ignored the 11th Rudra and Hanumana, the avatara of the 11th Rudra, helped Lord Rama to kill Ravana.  
  
As regards the 100 Kaurava brothers, all of them might not have been uterine brothers, as only 11 of them were maharathis, including Yuyutsu, and Yuyutsu was not the son of Gandhari. Other than these 11, the rest could have been the adopted children, who looked after Dhritarashtra and blind-folded Gandhari, particularly when the 11 kauravas underwent martial and other training under Guru Drona. Gandhari opened her eyes only once to see Duryodhana on the last day of Mahabharata war, when Duryodhana sought the blessings of his mother.
