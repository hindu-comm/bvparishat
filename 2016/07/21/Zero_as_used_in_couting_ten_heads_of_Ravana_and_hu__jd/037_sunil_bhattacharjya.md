Dear friends,  
  

There were two Aryabhattas. Alberuni also mentioned about the two Aryabhhattas. Aryabhatta-I was born in the 5th century CE.
Varahamihira in the 1st century BCE mentioned about Aryabhatta, who was obviously the Aryabhatta -I , who was born in earlier times than the 1st century BCE and it could even be before the times of Panini and his brother Pingala. There is a claim that Aryabhatta=I was born in 1325 BCE.
