23.7.16  

Dear Scholar,

  
\<If we ascribe discovery of zero to brahmagupta, then one finds it difficult to reconcile the shlokas of vAlmiikirAmAyaNa (kiShki 38) where the powers of ten are given and (sundara, 1) where hanumAn grows in multiples of ten yojanas to avoid being eaten by surasaa). One of these is possible:\>  
  

In fact the place value of zero was either discovered by Aryabhata or was inherited by him. In Ga.nitapaada vs.2 he states sthaanaat sthaana.m da;sagu.na.m syaat. This is the fundamental principle of the arrangement of numbers to get the place-value of individual digits and the series they make.  

I shall be glad if any friend corrected if there is any wrong observation made by me.  

The above ten includes zero  

Best  

DB
