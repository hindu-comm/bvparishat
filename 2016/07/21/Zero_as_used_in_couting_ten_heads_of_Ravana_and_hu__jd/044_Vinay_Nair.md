It's my pleasure. You can find more videos of his on YouTube. You can search using his name 'M D Srinivas'

4 years ago, we had taken a camp based on the ideas used in this video lectures on topic of learning Permutations and Combinations through Chandass Shastra at a camp at Chinmaya International Foundation, Cochin for students as young as 13 years old and the participants loved it. From May 2nd to 7th, 2017, Chinmaya International Foundation is doing a similar residential camp on 'Maths and Music' at Chinmaya Vibhooti (near Pune) using the ideas in Chandass Shastra. Anyone interested can visit the events section od [www.chinfo.org](http://www.chinfo.org) after a couple of weeks or contact me.

  

Regards,

  

Vinay
