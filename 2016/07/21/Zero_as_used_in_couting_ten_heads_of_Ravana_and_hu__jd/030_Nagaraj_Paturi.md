I do not know whether the following are the words of Shailza Sharma, the reviewer or Meera Nanda the author. But they need to be underlined:

  

> 
> > However, are we alone in this endeavour? We can look at the work of > David Pingree in *Hellenophilia Versus the History of Science*(1992) > to understand that this is not entirely an Indian phenomena. Pingree > states, “A Hellenophile \[love for Greece and Greek culture\] suffers > from a form of madness that blinds him or her to historical truth and > creates in the imagination the idea that one of several false > propositions is true. The first of these is that the Greeks invented > science; the second is that they discovered a way to truth, the > scientific method, that we are now successfully following; the third > is that the only real sciences are those that began in Greece; and the > fourth (and last?) is that the true definition of science is just that > which scientists happen to be doing now, following a method or methods > adumbrated by the Greeks, but never fully understood or utilised by > them.” >
> 

This is an important message to those who among Indians are absolutely sure that there were no scientific ideas at allin ancient India or ancient Sanskrit literature and all science originated in the west only.

  

The review has the following paragraph relevant to the present discussion:

  

> 
> > In his book *Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of > Mathematics*(1991), George G. Joseph highlights the technological > achievements India, China and Africa long before incursions of Europe > into these areas; and he emphasises that, “In the minds of some, > scientific progress becomes a uniquely European phenomenon, which can > be emulated by other nations only if they follow a specifically > European path of scientific and social development”, and thus it was > the intention of the author to show that “the standard treatment of > the history of non-European mathematics exhibited a deep-rooted > historiographical bias in the selection and interpretation of facts, > and that mathematical activity outside Europe has as a consequence > been ignored, devalued, or distorted.” >
>

Are notthese Euro-centric notions of the origins of scientific ideas are the ones that are deep seated in the modern more particularly post-independence main stream academic world ? Are these not the poorva paksha /trigger /source of most of the endeavours of digging out the scientific ideas in the ancient sources of cultures outside the Hellenistic world including India?

  

Serious academic historians of Indian scientific ideas never had or havethe idea that India was only a giver of ideas never a taker.

  

It is those who conceived or perceived the history of science to be a purely linear monolithic euro-centric evolution who need the following message from the review:

  

> 
> > This actually should be a way to understand science more generally; > there are parallel enquiries, and nobody ‘owns’ a scientific > achievement.
> > 
> > 
> >   
> > 

This apart, there are many less informed or ill informed ideas about Sulvasutras , Charka, S'us'ruta and other books in the piece that need a separate discussion.
