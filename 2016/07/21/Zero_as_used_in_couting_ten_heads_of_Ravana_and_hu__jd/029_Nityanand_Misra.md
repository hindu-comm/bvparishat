On the donkey-head of Ravana, it is seen commonly found in North Indian scultptures and paintings. This feature has been traced to sculptures dated to ninth century by Jayantika Kala (*Epic Scenes in Indian Plastic Art*, 1988, ISBN 9788170172284, p. 39) and in paintings dated to the Gupta period by Raghavan (*The Ramayana in Greater India*, 1973) as cited in Henk Blezer (ed.,*Tibet, Past and Present: Religion and secular culture in Tibet*, 2002, ISBN 9789004127760, p. 445) as well as Sivaramamurti (*Birds and Animals in Indian Sculpture*, 1974, pp. 26, 41). The last book mentions on page 445 that in the Tibetan version of Ramayana, one of the ten heads of Ravana is that of a horse, while the Khotanese version of the Ramayana mentions a donkey head.
