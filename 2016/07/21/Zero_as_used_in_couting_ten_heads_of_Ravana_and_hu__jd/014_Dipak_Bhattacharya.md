\<The essence of zero lies in the existence (or the proof of it) of negative numbers. Zero helps create the "realm" of negatives. So, even if zero is not explicitly mentioned, the presence of negative numbers necessary imply the presence of zero.>  
  

Nothing of that can be conceived without place value. 27 means 20+7= 2x10+7 That means the zero of twenty represents ten. So20 represents 2x10.21=2x10+1. If any number is placed in the series which our children are taught the place value is learnt from the top line  

Thus 100th 10th unit  
 1 6  7  

hundred units of one,six units of ten, seven units of one.  

This is a crude presentation, but the units in the series are recognisable.  

I hope some colleague will make a finer presentation.  

We were taught the above in the reverse order that made things complicated to me. But that was right as the numbers are written in our script in the reverse order beginning from unit in the extreme right.  

I stated just what was and perhaps, is still taught in the rural primary schools where ancient India still lives. There was no attempt to sermonize  
I am all praise for the system of teaching
