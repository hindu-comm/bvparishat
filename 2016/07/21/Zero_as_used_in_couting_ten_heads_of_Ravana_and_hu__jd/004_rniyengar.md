Zero as a concept associated with counting/arithmetic is different from its use in place value system. When subtraction of numbers became prevalent (example: Lagadha's Vedanga Jyotisha) there should have been instances when the same number got subtracted by itself ! But we do not find instances of explicit statements about this till later period. The text Krishi-paraashara has the rule R=\[(3N+2)/7\] for rainfall prognosis. N is the year counted from the beginning of the Shaka Era (78 AD). The remainder of the above equation would be one of the seven integers (0,1,2,...6). But the text treats 0 to be as 7 itself which is not wrong but this is not the way we do now.
