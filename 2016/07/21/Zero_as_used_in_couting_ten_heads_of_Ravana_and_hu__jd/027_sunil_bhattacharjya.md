Namaste,  
  
Ravana was a very learned and wise person. In his young age he was greedy for power and he took away by force the kingdom of Lanka as well as the Vimana from his brother Kuvera. He also misbehaved with a young lady, who cursed him, but later on he seems to have mended his ways. He was a great devotee of Lord Shiva and by Mother Parvati's grace he hadthe most beautiful wife (Mandodari) as beautiful as Mother Parvati, Then he committed the most foolish and unpardonable act of taking way Mother Sita, not for lust, but due to the pleading of his dear sister Surpanakha, who was interested in marrying Lord Rama. Mandodari advised him to return Sita but he did not listen to her. Then Mandodari wanted to fight Lord Ram herself, Ravana did not allow that also. It could be that because of adamance and foolishness, he was artistically represented with a head of an ass.
