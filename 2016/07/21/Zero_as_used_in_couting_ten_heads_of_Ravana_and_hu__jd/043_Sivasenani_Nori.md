Once again, thank you, Sri Nair.

  

Prof. Srinivas, at around the 30th minute in the video, briefly mentions "lopa" as a "linguistic zero" and indicates its value in that the string value changes depends on whether lopa is specified or not, even though in reality there is nothing. One would have thought of other Sutras where this concept is explicitly stated, but anyhow, I would definitely like to read more before on this topic.

  

A quick google search revealed that there is a monograph "Zero in Panini" by M. D. Pandit. (<http://manoharbooks.com/BookDetails.asp?Id=45461&isbn=>). I tried toorder it but strangely it was not loading to the cart.Anyhow, enough people seem to have written on the aspect for me to get a start. Also, whatever sample of Prof. Srinivas, I heard, he comes across as an expert on development of mathematics in India, so I am sure there is more to the concept.

  

Regards

Senani
