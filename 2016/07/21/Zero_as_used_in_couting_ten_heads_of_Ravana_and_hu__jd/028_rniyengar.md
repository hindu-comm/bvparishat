I came across a review of the book "Science in Saffron" by Meera Nanda:
<http://thewire.in/53574/jagat-guru-science-history-meera-nanda/>

  

I have not read the book yet. The phrase "Jagat-Guru Complex" is quite funny. My impression is, this syndrome is limited to some fanatical and ignorant circles only. 

But for the current thread on Zero the following portion of the review (by S. Sharma) may be relevant.  

  

"A commitment to comparative history and attention to counter cultures are the basic principles that guide the author in her next chapter. Using these principles, the author concludes that a new perspective emerges in examining the evolution of zero. She writes, “(i) When the Indian evidence is placed alongside the evidence from other civilisations of comparable development, it becomes clear that the Indian contributions were neither unique, nor without precedent and (ii) when the sources of evidence are widened beyond metaphysical speculations to include every day, practical counting and computing practices of ordinary people, a new window opens up which faces East of India, to China and South-East Asia.” This chapter is a valuable guide in understanding the relevance of difference between ‘zero’, ‘place value’ and ‘decimal counting’, and how it is quite common (though erroneous) to give all three an Indian birth certificate."
