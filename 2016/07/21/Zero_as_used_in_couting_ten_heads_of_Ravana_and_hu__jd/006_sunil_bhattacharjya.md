Namaste,  
  

I learnt that etymologically "Shunya" comes from "sve",i.e., to spread., and so much so that it cannot be perceived, or can be considered as non-existent for taking into account. If this derivation is valid, an example can be cited that a spoonful of water can be perceived, but not when it evaporates and gets spread in the air. Lord Vishnu has been called Shunya in this sense, as he is spread everywhere.  
  
Now the question is, when did this shunya came to be used to suffix a numeral, to indicate a value ten-fold the numeral? From the ensuing dliberations, so far, it appears that shunya in this application was known from the times of Mahabharata and Ramayana or even before that.
