most respected professor madhav deshpande ji,

  

i knew your erudition in vyakaraka and allied shatsric disciplines. this is really a new face for me. earlier when you had share some poems on poona, i thought these are some occasional poems. but after reading these poems in madakranta....you are an established poet....my respects got increased.

  

जानामि त्वां विबुधशरभं धातुवृत्तिं त्वदीयाम् ।

पाठंपाठं श्रवणसुभगं काव्यमर्थैरुदारम् ।।

दृष्ट्वाभूवं चकितहृदयः काव्यवृत्तिं त्वदीयम् ।

शब्दार्थौ चेत् मिलितयुगलं, काव्यलक्ष्मार्थयुक्तम् ।।

  

The काव्यलक्ष्म means definition of Kavya, अर्थयुक्तम् became meaningful.

  

my heartfelt appreciations..

  

with best regards,

shrivarakhedi
