Dear Prof.Deshpande,

The three poems you have circulated, भावसन्ध्या (वसन्ततिलका), स्यात् कथं विप्रयोगः (मन्दाक्रान्ता) and अहो अकरुणाः खलु ईश्वराः (मन्दाक्रान्ता) are thoroughly enjoyable to read and savour, and are of the highest lyrical quality. Thanks for enabling us to enjoy reading them. They are indeed models of modern Sanskrit poetry.

Regards,

Murthy
