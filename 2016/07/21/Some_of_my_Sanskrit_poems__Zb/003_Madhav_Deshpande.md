Thank you, Shri Murthy, for your appreciation. Most of my Sanskrit poems were composed and published during my student days in Pune. Since 1968, I have been living in the US, and for lack of an audience, my Sanskrit poetic enthusiasm pretty much stopped. It is possible to do analytical/historical research in Sanskrit in the US universities, but there is no audience for listening to Sanskrit poetry. Only now, through internet groups like ours, I can reach an audience, and, on the verge of retirement after teaching Sanskrit for 45 years, my Sanskrit poetic enthusiasm is returning, and hope it will continue. Again, thanks for your kind words.
