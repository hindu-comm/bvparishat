Dear BVP colleagues,

  

  As we are admiring Shri Murthy's wonderful poem, I thought I should make available here some of my own Sanskrit poems that were composed and published during my student days at Fergusson College (1962-66), and the Pune University (1966-68). Hope you will enjoy reading them. With best wishes,
