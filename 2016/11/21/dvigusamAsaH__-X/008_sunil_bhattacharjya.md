Namste Prof, Paturiji,  

  

\<(Shall I share a secret with you, aayushmaan? Theword तत्पुरुषः itselfis a tatpurusha samaasa and the word द्विगुitself is a dvigu sammasa. Is it not interesting? Why do you think is it so? Our ancestors, well before even Panini, used an example of a category as the name of the category, probably for the convenience of remembering the features of the category from the name of the category itself. Do you like it?)>  

  

How excellent a teacher you are.  
  

Regards,
