\> One cannot cover the entire speaker group to hold conference and decide the meanings of words they are using.

  

That exactly is the point.

  

That is why, I used the words "the *collective unconsciously formedconvention* of the entire speaker group". 

  

This way of looking at word-meaningrelation is not my invention. It has been part of modern general linguistics understanding for long.

  

In general linguistics,'arbitrary' relation between word and meaning is explained through the concept of 'convention'.

  

What is interesting is that Hari informs us that such a view existed among the ancient Indian linguists too as one of many ways of theorizing the word-meaning relation.

  

अनागमश् च सॊ ऽभ्यासः *समयः* कैश् चिद् इष्यतॆ /

अनन्तरम् इदं कार्यम् अस्माद् इत्य् उपदर्शकः // वाक्य\_२।११८ //

The second half of the verse, "अनन्तरम् इदं कार्यम् अस्माद् इत्य् उपदर्शकः " is in fact , an elaborated version of the technical term इतिकर्तव्यता only.

  

In any case, what I was trying to do was to show that the concepts such as ईश्वरकृतं in ancient Indian shastras are not incompatible with the rational understandings such as the *collective unconsciously formedconvention* which are involved in the understanding of the formation /emergence/coming into existence of social systems in any society. If such a samanvaya is not realized , it leads to the imagination that Eeshvara, one fine morning , sat under a tree and went on connecting each word of a language with its meanings, or called all the people and said, "ye, you all shall live in future as per this social system and they started following it. " To imagine that God said, "let this word have this meaning and there was that meaning of that word " or God said, "let there be this social system and there was that social system" is incompatible with the ancient Indian s'aastreeya view , leave alone Nyaya view.
