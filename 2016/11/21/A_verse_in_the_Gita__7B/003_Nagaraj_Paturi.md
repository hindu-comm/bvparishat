Please think about the full context of the verse. Kartritva of Bhagavaan and akartritva of Bhagavaan is being described as simultaneoushere.

  

"chaaturvarNya sriShTiis by Bhagavaan" is not the taatparya (intended ultimate meaning) here. Simultaneity of kartritva and akarteritva of Bhagavaan is the taatparya here.

  

For such simultaneity of agency and lack of agency of Bhagavaan in actions that are believed to be or known to be His, chaaturvarNyasriShTi is being shown as an example here.

  


----------@@@--------

  

Taking "chaaturvarNya sriShTiis by Bhagavaan" out of this context, it in fact means that chaaturvarNya sriShTi is not by any other agency such as a human individual or a human group or a human community or a human social organization or a human text or any thing like that.

  

(Take the analogy of nationalization of property in proletariat dictatorship: declaring that allproperty belongs to the government means declaring that no property belongs to any individual citizen or group of citizens of the nation.)

  

When Nyaaya Dars'ana declares that the system of 'this is the meaning of this word is'Ees'vara-made' ,what is actually intended is that the word-meaning relations are not created by any individualspeaker of the language (but is the collective unconsciously formedconvention of the entire speaker group. ) 

  

In the same way , when it is said here that Bhagavaan or Ees'vara is the one who created chaaturvarNyam, it actually means that any agency such as a human individual or a human group or a human community or a human social organization or a human text or any thing like that did not create chaaturvarNyam, it is the product of the collective unconsciously formedconvention of the entiresocial group. )
