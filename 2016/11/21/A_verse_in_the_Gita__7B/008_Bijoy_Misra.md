The common convention that Prof. Paturi mentions could be hundreds of years in the making. A theory can be made that

the neurological mappings of events and thoughts could be same to all human beings. The expression and speech

could be different because of local conditions of geography, intonation and accent. Once speech words are made they

can travel and be acquired by learning (copying or imitating). Through travel they can transform. Hence a theory of language

must deal with the peculiar words that could be in use untarnished in a region. Names of the local fruits in old oral languages

could be good candidates of study.

Bhartrhari makes the important observation that all words denote "classes" (jAti), which is the concept behind the object/event.

Then one gets a specific application (visheSa) when using in a context in a sentence. A jAti can have a myriad renderings!

Sri Aurobindo makes a whole theory of the Vedas by creating an alternate map of the Vedic words.
