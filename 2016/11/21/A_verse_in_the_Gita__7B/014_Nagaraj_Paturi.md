AadaraNIya Sivasenaniji,

  

I agree. Let me restate the same (your explanation)avoiding the categories that carry the notions outside our s'aastras.

  

Unlike the 'religions' where a personal God is first accepted/believed in and then phenomena are seen /understood/believed as His creation, In Indian s'aastras , as I understand, the concepts such as Ishvara and Brahman are arrived at through the understanding / explanation of the phenomena.

  

Ishvara for example ,is the entitythat isarrived at as the common cause of the processes such as convention that are responsible for the word-meaning relations, social systems etc. through the analysis of speech systems and social systems.

Similarly what is arrived at as the common cause of all the different relations between padaarthas, all the existences(beings -asti bhaavas), changes (becomings- bhavati bhaavas), actions (doings- kriyaa bhaavas) etc. through the analysis of all these is also given the name Ishvara.

  

In the case of naamakaraNa by persons too, there is a system / convention of how such naamakaraNa is done in a certain language. For each language, the person doing naamakaraNa follows that convention. The entitythat isarrived at as the common cause of the processes such as convention that are responsible for the word-meaning relations, social systems [etc.is](http://etc.is) also responsible for the convention of naming.

  

You may recognize this entity and view all these as its doings or you may as well say these are all runningirrespective of whether the common cause of all these is recognized with name Ishvara or not.

  

That is the point in

  

तस्य कर्तारमपि मां विद्ध्यकर्तारमव्ययम्॥ 4\\-13॥

कर्तारमपि अकर्तारमपि can be understood that way.
