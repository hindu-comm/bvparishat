\> Would you like to accept the meaning of shabdas from Rigveda are conventional and hence subject to change after some time? N.R.Joshi

  

---------- The concept of 'convention' that I mentioned does not have the implication that themeaning of a word used in a certain text changes in course of time.Leave alone the meaning of a word in Rigveda, even the meaning of a word in a verse of Kalidasa remains the samein that verse as long as the verse exists.The meaning of a word that occurs in a certain mantra/rik of Rigveda remains the same in that mantra/rik forever.

  

The same word that is used in that mantra/rik of Rigvedacould be found in another text of a later time. The meaning of that word in this later time text could be different from the meaning of the same in the said mantra/rik of Rigveda.
