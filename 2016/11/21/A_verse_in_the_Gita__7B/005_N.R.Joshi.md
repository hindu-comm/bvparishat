" When Nyaaya Dars'ana declares that the system of 'this is the meaning of this word is'Ees'vara-made' ,what is actually intended is that the word-meaning relations are not created by any individualspeaker of the language (but is the collective unconsciously formedconvention of the entire speaker group. )".



I read in another book that Nyaaya darshana proposed that meaning of Sanskrit words are conventional. But who set the convention in the beginning? To set convention of meanings for one language, one needs another language before that and another before that. To come out of this dilemma, they finally proposed it is the Ishvara sansketa.



In my opinion Ishvara Sanketa is not collective job of speakers. One cannot cover the entire speaker group to hold conference and decide the meanings of words they are using.



There are other Nyaaya Darshana scholars on this list. I request them to throw light on the word-meaning relationship as proposed by Nyaaya Darshan. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
