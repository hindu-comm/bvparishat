Namaste,  
  
In the Tretayuga it was felt by the people that the right persons should take up the right job, i.e., the physical and intellectual ability of the persons had to match the requirement of the jobs and that is how the division of work among the four categories was collectiively adopted. This collective consciousness, is what probably Prof. Paturiji is referring to.  
  

Sometimes we find that western scholars, who are ignorant of the basis of the varna system, call the brahmins as the people doing the job of priests. The brahmins belonged to the ntellectaul class, who were after intellectual pursuit and their worldly needs were just enough to match the bare necessities. They were not after wealth and power. I read that the great sage Vashishtha had hard time persuading some brahmins to take up the job of priest, against their will. Vashishta called upon them to make the sacrifice of thier intellectual pursuit (partially or wholly) for the sale of service to those who needed the service of priests for
performing the needed religious rites. That is how the priestly class came to be among the brahmins. I do not recollect the exact reference and I feel many of us may remember that.
