I think what was meant was "अनुष्टुभ् is the प्रातिपदिक form and not अनुष्टुप्." However, अनुष्टुप् is the indeed the inflected nominative singular form of the lemma अनुष्टुभ् due to जश्त्व (झलां जशोऽन्ते) and वैकल्पिकचर्त्व (वाऽवसाने). The inflected forms are अनुष्टुप्/अनुष्टुब् अनुष्टुभौ अनुष्टुभः and so on. As the पूर्वपद of a compound also, the form would be अनुष्टुप्/अनुष्टुब्. This is because even though the सुप्प्रत्यय is elided due to the operation of सुपो धातुप्रातिपदिकयोः, by the rule प्रत्ययलोपे प्रत्ययलक्षणम्the जश्त्व will still take place and चर्त्व could result from खरि च (and not वाऽवसाने)

  

I do not recall anybody said that अनुष्टुप् is the प्रातिपदिक.

I guess what is meant is पुट्ट (ಪುಟ್ಟ) and पुट्टाणि (ಪುಟ್ಟಾಣಿ). Are these words older than कुमारिल?

While the वर्णविपर्यय is exhibited in पृषोदरादि words, examples of वर्णविपर्ययlike सिंह are still traced to Sanskrit roots (हिनस्तीति सिंहः from हिंस् + पचाद्यच्).
