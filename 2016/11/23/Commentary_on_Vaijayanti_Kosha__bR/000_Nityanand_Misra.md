Dear list

  

I have two editions of the Vaijayanti Kosha,

1\) Edited by Gustav Oppert (1893)

2\) Edited by Pt. Haragovinda Shastri (2008 reprint)  

None of the editions has any commentary. The edition by Oppert does give English meanings of all words in an appendix.  

  

Is any edition of Vaijayanti Kosha with a Sanskrit commentary available?

  

Thanks, Nityananda
