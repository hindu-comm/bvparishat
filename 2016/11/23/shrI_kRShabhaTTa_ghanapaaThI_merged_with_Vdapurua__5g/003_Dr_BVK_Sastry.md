Namaste



Indeed it is a very sad news that we lost one more ‘ highly trained Veda –Traditional Scholar’. I had personal interactions with him on his work related to Nirukta and Shiksha / Pratishaakhya related and found the outcome to be very useful.



My prayers to the departed soul and Prayers for the family members bereaved.



Sadder is the larger plight that we are not doing the critical things would help to groom and train another ‘Veda –Purusha as a succession of the Sampradaya’; and leaving the vacuum as it is ( or imperfectly , part filled.) Any one with any better thoughts on this part, so that the ‘ Veda –Vishada –Yoga’ will find a solution ?



Regards

BVK Sastry
