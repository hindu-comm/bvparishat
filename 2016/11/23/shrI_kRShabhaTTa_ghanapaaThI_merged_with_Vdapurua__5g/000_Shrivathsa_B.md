hariḥ om,

 Śrī Kṛṣabhaṭṭa ghanapaaṭhī, a great vidvān of Ṛgveda, merged with Vēdapuruṣa today. He was about 50 years.

 This is an incalculable loss to vedavidyāparamparā. Words fall short to describe as to with how much if love he used to shower on his students. His humility was exemplary.

स्वस्ति,  
 भवानीभारती जयतेतमाम्,  
 श्रीवत्सः ॥
