Dear Members,

  

It is evident from the introduction to his Brahmasutrasaktibhasya that 'Tyaktamahamahopadhyaya' Pt. Pancana Tarkaratna Bhattacarya also wrote Saktibhasyas on the Candi and the Bhagavadgita. I will be highly obliged if anyone helps me to the ecopy of the said Saktibhasya of Pancanana Tarkaratna on the Bhagavadgita..

  

Regards,

Sudipta Munsi
