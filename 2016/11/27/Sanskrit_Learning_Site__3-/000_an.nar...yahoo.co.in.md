Namo Vidvadbhya:

FYI... I would like to post a message from my colleage, Parameswaran, who has created sanskrit lessons useful for learners.

Dear all,



Have finally uploaded the first lesson on my Sanskrit course on my website and youtube. My plan is to have about 50 (is this too ambitious?) lessons uploaded over the next two years.



You can reach the YouTube site trough the website or directly at<https://youtu.be/AnL7PIFFat0>



The website is called<https://oursanskrit.com/>



I have uploaded a full set of reference material on the site. Will keep adding more material as we go along.



Those interested in learning Sanskrit may find this useful.



Please pass this link on to any of your friends who might be interested.



Comments are welcome.



Regards,

Paramu
