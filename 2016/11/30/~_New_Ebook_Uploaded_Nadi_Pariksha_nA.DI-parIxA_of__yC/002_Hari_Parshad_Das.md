Dear Ajit ji,  
  

Thank you for pointing out that the book may still be in copyright.  
  

I recently purchased this book and another small booklet named 'Nṛsiṁha-kavaca' from a local shop.  

  
Before uploading the book i tried to check their website <http://www.khe-shri.com> to check if the book is still selling on their site, but the site itself is not loading.  
  

Not seeing any copyright marks printed on the book, i've uploaded it to [archive.org](http://archive.org)  
  

If you are sure that it is still under copyright, please let me know and i will ask [archive.org](http://archive.org) to delete the page asap. I've already disabled the dropbox link.  
  

sādhu-caraṇa-rajo 'bhilāṣī,  
  

hari parshad das.
