Dear Hari Prasad Das ji,



I appreciate you are making good books available. I am simply mentioning this. One needs to be careful before making claims. I personally am not concerned with this.

****

This book is under copy-write of Khemaraj ShriKrshnadass Mumbai. This is not the old edition of Vekateswara Steam press The copy write pages might have been removed  
  
Regards

Ajit Gargeshwari
