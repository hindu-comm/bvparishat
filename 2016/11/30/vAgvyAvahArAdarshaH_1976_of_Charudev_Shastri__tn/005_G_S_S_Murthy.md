I went to DLI page referred. I got the following message:

# "Forbidden

You don't have permission to access /rawdataupload/upload/0099/427/PTIFF/00000001.tif on this server."

I would be grateful for any help. I would like to have Dr.Charudevashastryji's book software copy.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
