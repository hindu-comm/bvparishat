The DLI title is Anuvad Kala Athva Vyagyavhadrsh Sounds OK to me for this book, considering DLI indexing standards. Vagvy and Vagya are typos that can happen when one inputs in English considering that the person who keys in Data does not and cannot read Sanskrit but with difficulty Hindi and English titles. I am writing this so that when one searches in DLI site when has to use all permutations and possible combinations to locate a book.
