I don't always trust the Vyutpattikośa explanations. If one assumes that the Prakrit word is "sāu", there is no reason why Marathi derived from it would be "sār". Nor can one explain why and how the Sanskrit "sāra" would be reduced to Prakrit "sāu" as implied in the Vyutpattikośa explanation. Sanskrit "r" does not get lost in Prakrit, cf. Sanskrit sarasvatī to Prakrit sarassai. So the Prakrit derivation is not at all logical.
