Thanks Prof. Deshpande Ji. I am interested in the origin of the word सार as in चिंचेचे सार. I feel this directly comes from Sanskrit सार (= nectar, essence) as in पुष्पसार but need to confirm this.

  

Molesworth has two entries for सार, one with meanings in Sanskrit and one with meanings in Marathi. But there is no etymology given for the entry with Marathi meanings.
