Namaste Paturi ji



Thanks for your valuable observations and pointing the following. I am putting them together before formally articulating my
clarification/question request.



***Observed Points in the post***:



1.a) ‘scripting convention changes’ in \< local Dekkhani speakers of Hyderabad> and the observation \< But in the local pronunciation , the distinction between dantya and taalavya ch does not exist \> .



1.b) Education about the scripting of regional language in school \< Till recently Telugu children were taught two different orthographic symbols for the two. During modern orthographic reformations they removed the symbol for dantya ch considering it obsolete. \>



1.c) \< they put the Telugu script symbol for the digit 2 above the script symbol for ch>.





***2. Clarification /Question request ***:



2.a) \< On 1.c- ‘ they ’…. 1.b) ‘ till recently’…> : What was the trigger and time line when ‘ learning model of orthography of
telugu regional language got changed for ‘Telugu children’ ?



 Was it a quiet, unnoticed issue ? **OR** Initiative from some scholar-administrators brilliant idea to impose ‘ uniform simplified scripting for many (south) Indian languages’ **OR** some printer who found a convenient mechanism to solve a composing problem ?




 How is the TELUGU –TEXT- CHAACTER- READING Taught in schools , by what norms of ‘ linguistics for regional language education’ ? Is it aligned to local pronunciation ? Anglicized ? Sanskritized ?



 \[ Note: Similar conventions have been adapted by Maharashtrian Printers, in previous centuries, in printing ‘ Veda Books’ using Devanagari Script and Marathy Orthography based type-faces. For more details, explore the introduction of sign conventions in introduction part, books printed by Satwalekar\].
These conventions of local context and technology have created a ‘ irreversible impact on the way of reading the printed text, causing a great split between the voice traditions ( relied upon by traditional schools) and Print-Symbol book based Transliterations of Vedas by ( relied upon by Out of India – Scholars of Veda ‘ Unbound by norms of
Tradition’.) This over-ride of ‘ scripted symbol over the live voice tradition and scant respect for ‘ Voice guidance rules (Shikshaa) placed as foundation at early schooling for linguistic studies of Sanskrit’- has percolated to become an integral part of many digital standards and software’s; causing confusion on what is the right shape of the ‘ character in which language tag and how to associate a phonetic value for it’?







2.b) Professor Deshpande has noted the challenge in associating the TEXT READING / PRONUNCIATION OF SCRIPT SYMBOL in MARATHI
ORTHOGRAPHY , which needs to be learnt in a ‘ Native speaker Natural way’.

 How will IPA/ Diacritics convention/ Harvard Kyoto widely adapted in UNICODE help in resolving / facilitating this ‘ pronunciation distinctions’ OR even the orthographic distinctions for regional languages of India ?

 Is it to be treated as a ‘ limitation of current typography related technology’ –( An issue I am working through my project of ‘Shruti-Kranti’) to build a language appropriate technology, in contrast to ‘ English dependent Indian Language representation conventions’?

I am talking of the local Dekkhani speakers of Hyderabad. Dekkhani here has a very big number of borrowings from Marathi. This could be one of those. But in the local pronunciation , the distinction between dantya and taalavya ch does not exist. Probably, the original Marathi word had it.Probably the Dekkhani word lost it. 



Talking of ts - like ch , we have it in Classical Telugu and certain dialects of Telugu even today. Classical Telugu grammars used the term dantya ch to refer to the ts - like ch, to distinguish it from the other ch. The other ch is called talavya ch. Till recently Telugu children were taught two different orthographic symbols for the two. During modern orthographic reformations they removed the symbol for dantya ch considering it obsolete.



What they did to denote the dantya ch was, they put the Telugu script symbol for the digit 2 above the script symbol for ch. ![Inline image 1](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/3d4ee000baef3/image001.gif?part=0.1)![Inline image 2](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/3d4ee000baef3/image002.gif?part=0.2)

You are missing the anusvāra in the word चिंच. Also, as Hari Parshad Das pointed out, the Marathi pronunciation of this word is different from what it would be in Hindi or Sanskrit. The first syllable चिं is palatal like Sanskrit/Hindi, but the second syllable च is pronounced like "ts". Marathi orthography does not distinguish two separate contextual pronunciations for च, छ, ज, झ. For details, see:<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathi_phonology>. Since the orthography does not distinguish two separate pronunciations for these consonants, which the native speakers learn naturally, it is difficult for non-natives to figure out these differences.

Can you give us the context where चिंचेचे सार was found by you?



चिचा = uncle



चिचाचा /चिचेचे = of uncle



सार= ?



context may help resolve.





It means Uncle Soup. Goes well with Uncle Chips.
