You are missing the anusvāra in the word चिंच. Also, as Hari Parshad Das pointed out, the Marathi pronunciation of this word is different from what it would be in Hindi or Sanskrit. The first syllable चिं is palatal like Sanskrit/Hindi, but the second syllable च is pronounced like "ts". Marathi orthography does not distinguish two separate contextual pronunciations for च, छ, ज, झ. For details, see:<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathi_phonology>. Since the orthography does not distinguish two separate pronunciations for these consonants, which the native speakers learn naturally, it is difficult for non-natives to figure out these differences.
