Dear Nityanandji,

  

  I have a physical copy of this book, but not a pdf. There is no other comprehensive etymological Kosha for Marathi that I know of. But sometimes Molesworth's Marathi dictionary is useful, and so is the new Oxford Dictionary of Old Marathi by Tulpule and Feldhaus. I believe the Molesworth dictionary is available on [archive.org](http://archive.org). Also useful is R. L. Turner's[A Comparative Dictionary of Indo-Aryan Languages](http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/soas/).
