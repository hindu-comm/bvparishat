I am talking of the local Dekkhani speakers of Hyderabad. Dekkhani here has a very big number of borrowings from Marathi. This could be one of those. But in the local pronunciation , the distinction between dantya and taalavya ch does not exist. Probably, the original Marathi word had it.Probably the Dekkhani word lost it. 

  

Talking of ts - like ch , we have it in Classical Telugu and certain dialects of Telugu even today. Classical Telugu grammars used the term dantya ch to refer to the ts - like ch, to distinguish it from the other ch. The other ch is called talavya ch. Till recently Telugu children were taught two different orthographic symbols for the two. During modern orthographic reformations they removed the symbol for dantya ch considering it obsolete.

  

What they did to denote the dantya ch was, they put the Telugu script symbol for the digit 2 above the script symbol for ch. ![Inline image 1](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/3a37ea53010c2/image.gif?part=0.2&view=1)![Inline image 2](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/3a37ea53010c2/image.gif?part=0.1&view=1)
