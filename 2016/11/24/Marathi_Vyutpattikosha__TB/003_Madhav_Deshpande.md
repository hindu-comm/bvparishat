Dear Nityanandaji,

  

I think the Marathi word sār(a) as a kind of light soup is related to the use of this word in South Indian languages, rather than with Sāra in Sanskrit. A good deal of Marathi words come from its presumed Kannada substratum as suggested by Southworth and others. I have attached one of Southworth's articles.
