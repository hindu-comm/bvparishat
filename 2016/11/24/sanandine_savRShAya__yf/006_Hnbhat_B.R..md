For the first question, regarding "Nandidvaj" meanings will be contextual. Without giving the context, the meanig of a word will be incomplete.

  

For the second question, it has been answered by earlier posting Nagaraj Paturi, with reference to नान्दी in नाट्यशास्त्र asनन्दी वृषः कोऽपि महेश्वरस्य etc.
