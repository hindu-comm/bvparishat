Namaste.

In the Panchayatana Puja published in the book Nityahnikam by R S Vadhyar there is a shloka on Paramesvara as follows :

  

नमः शिवाय साम्बाय सगणाय ससूनवे \|

सनन्दिने सगङ्गाय सवृषाय नमो नमः \|\|

  

Request the learned members explain the occurrence of two references to 'with Nandi', first as सनन्दिने and again as सवृषाय in the above shloka.


Or does one of these words describe another attribute of the Lord, and if so which word and what does it signify. 

  

I have seen other renderings of the above withसवृषाय replaced byससोमाय etc, but I am interested in the above rendering.

  

Thanks in advance.

  

Regards

Venkateswaran
