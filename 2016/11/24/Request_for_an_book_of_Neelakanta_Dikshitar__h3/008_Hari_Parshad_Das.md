Dear Jaya Prakash ji,  
  
The Vani Vilasa press had published some minor poems of Sri Nilakantha Dikshita.  
  
I've attached the ebook to this email.  
  
The Saubhāgya-candrātapa however was not a part of this publication.  
  
I am not sure if the Vani Vilasa press published Saubhāgya-candrātapa separately. If yes, please point out an entry in [worldcat.org](http://worldcat.org)  
  
sādhu-caraṇa-rajo 'bhilāṣī,  
  
hari parshad das.
