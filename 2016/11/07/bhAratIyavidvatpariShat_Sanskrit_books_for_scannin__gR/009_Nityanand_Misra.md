All India level or not I do not know, but this is what Dr. Ajit Gargeshwari wrote to me more than two years ago (I hope he does not mind me sharing this with the list). This is some service to Sanskrit!

  

*I have scanned nearly 1,400 books on various aspects on Indian Culture mostly in Sanskrit both in print and most of them rare or out off print. I can give tem (them) to a service provider but many books I get or do have the pages are brittle and cannot give it to a third partry (party) unless I am sure he knows how to handle books. ...From various public domain site I have over the past several years collected over 20,000 ebooks apart from my scans. I can share them with you for your personal studies. if you need them Please send me a 2 TB HDD and I will send them all to you. It might save you alot (a lot) of downlaoding (downloading) time!!*
