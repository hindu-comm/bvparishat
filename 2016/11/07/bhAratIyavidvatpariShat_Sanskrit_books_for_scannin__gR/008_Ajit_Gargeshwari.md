Lets close this matter. I am not at any all India Level. I don’t match any Institutions like DLI or archivists like Sri Chetan Pandeyji and countless others who have made innumerable great books available at archives and elsewhere.

Regards

Ajit Gargeshwari

Sri Ajit Gargeshwari is the only person available.  
Not only in Bangalore but in whole India. No other institution even match him.
