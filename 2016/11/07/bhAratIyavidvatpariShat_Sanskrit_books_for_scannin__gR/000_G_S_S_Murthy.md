Dear Scholars,

I have a good collection of old Sanskrit books in Devanagari script.Some of these books might not have been scanned and may not be available on the internet.

Now, if there is an organization/Institution in Bangalore who have the required equipment and expertise in scanning fragile old books and who are willing to scan such old books I would like them to interact with me over Email.We could work out a way to scan the books with me. I do not have a list of the books I have.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
