Dear Scholar Friends,

  

Good morning. I had mentioned earlier about our efforts here through

a project called India Discovery Center in order to make an effort to

create an exposition of the Indian cultural history for the public and

our youth in the foreign lands. We divide the chronological history into

eight time intervals and examine six tracks in each time interval.

The tracks are: Geography and People, Art and Culture, Language and

Literature, Philosophy and Religion, Science and Technology, and

finally, Economy and Politics. The time intervals are: Indus, Vedic,

post-Vedic/Buddhist/Jaina 700BC -200BC, early Hindu 200BC-500AD,

Hindu 500AD-1500AD, Mughal 1500AD-1750 AD, Briitish 1750AD-1950AD,

Current 1950AD- . We plan to host public seminars on each period every

six months. We schedule to compile the presentations and produce them

as books. The Indus seminars were held in July, the seminars on the Vedic

period are scheduled for Jan 21, 2017. 

  

Our goal is education and not documentation. We are driven by the

possible questions a curious fifteen year old may ask and to find analytic

answers. Like children worldwide, we do not belong in any camps or

schools of thought. While we realize that most of the interpretations have

been biased, we wish to explore those great ideas that nurtured India

such that our youth is empowered for future work in their life. We also

wish to discover the turns in the evolution of the Indian society and culture

for our own understanding as residents abroad.

  

I invite the scholars to guide us in this expedition. Please send me any

papers, books and references that you think worthwhile to include in the

study. I particularly welcome comments from the teachers who might

have attempted to create curriculum of studies for young students from a

pure knowledge point of view. I solicit your blessings and request the

teachers to mentor our researchers in various tracks.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
