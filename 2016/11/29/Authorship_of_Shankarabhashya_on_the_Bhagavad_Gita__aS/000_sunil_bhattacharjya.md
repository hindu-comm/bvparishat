Dear friends,  
  
I came to know that Dr.. R..D.Karmarkar wrote a paper entitled "Did Sankaracharya write a bhasya on the Bhagavad Gita", which appeared in the Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, vol. 39 (part 4) 1958. I understand that the author concludes that Adi Shankara might not have written a bhashya on the Bhagavad Gita, i.e., it could have been by any other subsequest Shankaracharya of any of the Shankara-mathas.  Has any scholar from this group studied this paper of Dr. Karmarkar or seen any other paper by other author(s) critically looking at the conclusions of Dr. Karmarkar.  
  
Regards,
