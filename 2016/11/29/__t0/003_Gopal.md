Namaste.  
  

I have been looking for Sri Raghavendra Swamin's Mantrartha Manjari ( a work on Rig bhashya by Sri Madvacharya). Someone in the list privately mentioned about the availability of a digital version of an old pothi edition with them. I have been told by a few from madhwa mutts in Bangalore and tamil nadu that there was at least one modern print edition of the book.  
  

Worldcat does not show it up as-is named. Maybe it is cataloged all over in different ways. Rig Bhashya by Sri Pandurangi has parts of this work as he has compiled many commentaries together. Sripadana Rao's '40 suktas' book has only the meaning (padaartha) and he had removed other aspects of the work like vyakarana to provide clarity to readers.  
  

Kindly email me or reply to the list if a modern print copy of the book or its digital version exists somewhere.  
  

thanks,
