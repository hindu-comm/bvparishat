Dear Scholars,  
  

I am looking for the book Guru-Vijaya or Acharya-vijaya by Anantaanandagiri. This is different from Prachina Shankaa Vijaya by Ananandagiri.  
  
This book Guru-Vijaya or Acharya-Vijaya is published as the
Philosophical series, No. 16, 1971, by the Madras University.There seems to be another copy of the same book published in 1968 by the Baptist Mission Press, Calcutta  
  
I shall be grateful if any member can give any information as to how to get a copy of the same, preferably in the pdf version. Some claim that this is about the Abhinava Shankara and not about Adi Shankara. '  

  

Looking forward to hearing from you and with thanks in advance,  

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
