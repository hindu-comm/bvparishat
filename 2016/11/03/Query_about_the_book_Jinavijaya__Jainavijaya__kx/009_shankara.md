Bhattacharyaji,

  

It is necessary to know whether 'Jinavijaya' was ever published at all. It might still be lying in some manuscript libraries. Jinaratnakosa of HD Velankar doesn't list Jinavijaya. New Catalogus Catalogorum volume 7 has 4 texts named 'Jinavijaya'. I am attaching a pdf of this page. You may check if any of them is the Jinavijaya you are looking for.  

  

G.C. Pandey in his 'Life and Thought of Sankaracharya' refers to 'Jinavijaya'. But, he doesn't mention any bibliographical details. His book is partially available at Google books for online reading.

regards  
shankara
