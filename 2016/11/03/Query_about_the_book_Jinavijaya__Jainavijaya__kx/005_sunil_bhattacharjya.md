Dear Jaya Prakashji,  
  

I could download the book today only. The DLI site was not responding yesterday. May be it was down.  
  

However this book, suggested by you, is not the one I was looking for. The Jina-Vijaya was a book of the Digambara Jainas and was really valuable from historical angle. It gives the details of the Contemporaries of Lord Mahavira.  
  

Thanks,  

SKB
