Dear Vidyasankarji  
  

The Jinavijaya muni, you are referring to, was born in 1888 CE. But I read the reference of the book Jinavijaya in a journal (in Poona university library), which was published about ten years before the birth nof the Jinavijaya muni. Jinavijaya muni passed away forty years ago. Some years ago, I looked for the reference to that book in a journal in the Poona university library at the behest of a friend of Mr.David Reigle, who was known to me. I will contact David, if he can get a copy of the paper, which I sent to his friend. It is a curious coincidence that after the the great book "Jinavijaya" seems to have been destroyed, by the machinations of the colonial distortionist forces, there came to be a person named as Jinavijaya
