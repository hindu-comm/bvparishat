Dear Scholar friends,  
  
There was a book called Jina-Vijaya (some mention it as Jaina-Vijaya), which was in circulation, prior to Prof.Max Muller's announcement of the Aryan Invasion Theory (AIT) in 1982. I understand that old journals in libraries (such as in the Jayakar library of the University of Poona) prior to 1982 do mention this book. This book is a valuable text for many historical facts not only important for the lovers of Jainism (which has "Truth" as one of the five tenets of the religion) but also for all Indians. A concerted effort by all may help us to find how this invaluable book suddenly disappeared after 1982, whether by any machination by people who do not want the Indians to know the contents of this valuable book, particularly for the period after the passing away of Lord Mahavira. Had this book been available it book have exposed many of the distortions in Indian history perpetrated during the Colonial times  
  

I shall be grateful if anybody can give any clue on this.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
