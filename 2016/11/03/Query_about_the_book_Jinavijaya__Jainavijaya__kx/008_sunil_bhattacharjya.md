Dear Vidyasankarji,  
  

I could trace my correspondence with the friend of David. Six years ago I got for him, the copies of the paper, which appeared in the Journal, Samskrita Chandrika, which was published from Calcutta in 1976. The paper in the journal clearly mentions about the great book "Jinavijaya". .Hope this removes your doubt.  
  

Regards,  

SKB
