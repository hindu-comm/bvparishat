Dear Ajitji,  
  

When you say "it might be non-existent", there is always an equal chance that "it might not be non-existent". I cherish a hope hope that some do-gooder young person will investigate and bring out the facts, as to how the book disappeared and find at least one copy, which will be
sufficient to prepare the scan and circulate, so that any number of hard copies can be prepared, subsequently.
