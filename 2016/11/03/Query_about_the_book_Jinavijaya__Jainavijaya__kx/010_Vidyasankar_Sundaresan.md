I am very skeptical, shall we say, about such claims of specific books being so selectively destroyed. Over the last century and a half, there have been quite a few such instances, claiming to refer to kumArila and Sankara, that were miraculously available for a small group of people to quote from, but then miraculously vanished when the same group of people were asked for details of these books.

I'll leave it at that.

Best regards,
