Dear Sunilji,

What are the textual sources that refer to this text called jinavijaya?

You may be interested to know that there was a jaina AcArya called jinavijaya muni, who was a fairly well known scholarly author and editor. He went to Germany, invited by Hermann Jacobi, stayed there for a few years, returned India and got politically involved, interacting extensively with Tilak, Gandhi and others.

Are you sure your sources are talking about a book and not a person? After all, it is quite possible that a scholar like this jaina monk may have said/written something about key historical Indian philosophers.
