Dear Shankaraji,  
  

Several people, supporting the 6th century BCE date of Adi Shankaracharya, have mentioned Jinavijaya in their works on Shankaracharya, and I don't think that they have lied, because they have also given other evidences in support of their date of Adi Shankaracharya.  
  

There was one Dhruva who presented a paper in an international seminar, where he mentioned about a Copper-plate-inscription of king Sudhanva and gave the ASI numbering. He wrote that he would write about Shankara's date, but he died mysteriosly very soon thereafter. Mysteriously that inscription also vanished from the custody of ASI.  
  

The vanishing of the Jinavijaya and the vanishing of Sudhanva's inscription, can very well be the work of the supporters of the Aryan Invasion Theory, so fondly supported by the Colonial masters as that suited their purpose. Thecolonialist authotities could have succeeded in convincing some Jaina scholars that the historical information in that book are fictitious, except the time of Lord Mahavira, and those gullible Jaina scholars fell for that persuation and they stopped the circulation of the book, if not destroyed. I only hope that the book, if kept out of reach, will soon be brought out.  
  

Regards,
