Dear Jayaprakashji,  
  

Thank you for sending the links. However, I am unable to download the book from any of the links you sent. May be you or any member of this forum, can help me by downloading it and sending it as an attachment.  

  

I have a doubt. The book I was searching is called "Jina-vijaya" (or may be "Jaina-vijaya"), which. to my understanding, mentions Kumarila Bhatta and King Sudhanva as contemporaries of Lord Mahavira. This book very adversely criticizes Kumarila Bhatta and King Sudhanva. The Jina-Vijaya (or Jaina-Vijaya) is thus a very good reference-book for ancient Indian History. The name of this book should not be confused with the names of the persons like Jinavijaya muni and Jainavijaya muni.  
  
  

Regards,  

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
