The editor of this edition, Sri Haridas Shastriji says in the beginning that sometimes this work is misattributed to Sri Baladeva Vidyabhushan. In reality the author is his guru Sri Radha-damodar Goswami. He specifies two reasons for the same :  
  

1\) The author has mentioned his name at the end of the creation.  
  

2\) In one of Sri Baladeva Vidyabhushana's works named 'Siddhānta-ratnam', he has said that Vedānta-syamantaka is the creation of Sri Radha-damodar Goswami.
