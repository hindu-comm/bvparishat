Dear Shreyas,



I am aware of this and several commentaries of Sri Bhashya does have voluminous quotes from Yadava Prakasha, they do refer to the texts as quotations not the complete book right.

I am even aware from traditional accounts Yadava Prakash became a Sri Vaishnava during Sri Ramnuja’s life time. Thank you very much for this information

Regards
