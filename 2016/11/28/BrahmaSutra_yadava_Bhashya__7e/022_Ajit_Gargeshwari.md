Vistatadvaita tradition holds that Vaijayanti Kosa is written by Yadava Prakass. Out of the 8 manuscripts used Gustav Oppert only one manuscript which he calls A was complete and had all the 8 chapters. All the other manuscripts were incomplete and he simply quotes tradition and ascribes the work to Yadava Praksa. Even Hara Govind Shastri also accepts this tradition. Thanks
