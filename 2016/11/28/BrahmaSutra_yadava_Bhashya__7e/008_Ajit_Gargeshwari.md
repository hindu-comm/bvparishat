This identification is new to me also. Probably Visha Agarwal ji has reasons for this identification.

Dear Vishal,



  Can you confirm that the Yādavaprakāśa, the author of these works, is the same as the teacher of Rāmānuja. Does the Viśiṣṭādvaita tradition accept this identification? I am asking because this identification is rather new to me.
