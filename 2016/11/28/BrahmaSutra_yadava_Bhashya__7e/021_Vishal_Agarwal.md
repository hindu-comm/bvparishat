I just looked up Olivelle's edition and he accepts the ascription of YDhSamucchaya to Yadava Prakasha, and also points out that it is quoted as such by Vedanta Deskhika. I think the older edition of the original work might be downloadable from DLI.

  

The scanned edition of Vaijayanti Kosha that I have is by Gustav Oppert and was printed in 1893, on the basis of 11 manuscripts. Oppert identifies this YadavaPrakasha with the Guru of Ramanuja.

  

For his beautiful commentary on the Chhandasutras, please see the following edition:

Chhandsutrabhashyam Shriyadavaprakashakritam. Haridasa simharaayen parishodhitam sampaaditam cha. The Asiatic Society, Calcutta, 1977.

The Arya Samaj also promotes this particular commentary of Chhandasutras because its examples are suitable for Brahmacharis. I will need to check my boxes for an edition by Dr Vijayapal Vidyavaridhi. There is also an English translation on the same available from Kolkata at our local University library. All these editions confirm that the author of the Bhashya is the same Yadava Prakash who was the Guru and later the student of Ramanujacharya.

  

A Jeeyar is visiting our area next month for Shri Ramanuja's 1000th birthday celebrations - I could request him to provide his opinions if you want me.
