Yes, the tradition accepts him to be the former teacher of Ramanuja. Due to some disputes between them (specifically over the interpretation of kapyaasam pundariikam phrase of Chhandogya), Ramanuja left his teacher. The tradition actually says that Yadava tried to get Ramanuja killed, but a co-student, who was also Ramanuja's cousin, tipped him off and saved his life. After several years, Yadava's mother was instrumental in asking him to accept Ramanuja as his Guru.

  

Earlier, Yadava Prakasha was an Ekadandin (as in the Advaita tradition) but subsequent to his reconciliation with Ramanuja, and accepting his former student now as his teacher, he followed Ramanuja's command to compile a manual of Sannyasa for tridandin sannyasins. This is what the work does.

  

I have seen this work quoted with approval by later Vishishtadvaita authors too.

  

I have come across two editions of the work, one from a Shri Vaishnava editor and another recently by Patrick Olivelle. Perhaps you could consult their Forewords as I do not remember what they say about this identification.

  

With regards,

Vishal Agarwal
