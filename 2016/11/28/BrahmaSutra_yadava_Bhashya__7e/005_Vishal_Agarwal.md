Three works of Yadavaprakasha have come down to us and are available in print:

1. Vaijayanti Kosha

2. Commentary on Pingala Chhandasutras

3. Yatidharmasamucchaya

  

His commentaries on the Gita and the Brahmasutra are lost. His sixth work 'Taittiriya Sarvanukramani' is apparently available in manuscript per P Aithal's 'Veda Laksana'.

Sribhashya and Ramanuja quotes from several works which are now lost or were probably available a thousand years back or Sri Ranujam himself might have quoted traditional passages whose originals he may not have seen either  
Traditional commentators of Ramanuja tradition would have quoted passages which were in tradition but whose originals may not be available today.
