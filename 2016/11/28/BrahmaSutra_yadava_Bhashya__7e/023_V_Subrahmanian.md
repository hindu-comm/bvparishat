As I had pointed out earlier, Sri Viśveśvara Saraswati in his Yati dharma sangraha cites from a work called 'Yati dharma samucchaya.' 

  

Also, in Surendranath Dasgupta's 'History of Indian Philosophy' Volume IV, p.53, he gives a list of 21 Brahmasutra bhāṣyas that Madhva refuted. That list has Yadava Prakaśa's bhāṣya too, along with Ramanuja's and Shankara's among several others. This list is enumerated by a commentary to the Madhva Vijaya of Narayana Pandita.
