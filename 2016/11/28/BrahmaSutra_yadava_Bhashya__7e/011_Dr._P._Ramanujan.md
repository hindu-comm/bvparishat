Respected Prof. Nagaraj Paturi!



Thank you very much for the reference.



Actually, Prof. NS Ramanuja Tatacharya has expressed the desire to write a Sanskrit commentary on the portions dealing with Sankara, Bhaskara, Yadava siddhantas

found in Sruta Prakasika and I am planning to provide him requisite material in this regard and generally assist him in this endeavour.

We also may be able to reconstruct the yadava bhashya scheme from over 100 adhikaranas where we have info.

I also have an unpublished palm-leaf manuscript of Sailali Brahmana, which also we wish to publish in due course.



I also thank Shri Vishal Agarwal for the commendable repository he has and wish to benefit in future.



Regards
