I haven't seen much critical discussion of the vaijayantI kosha and the commentary on the chandassUtra.

  

The yatidharma-sammucaya text is attributed to yAdavaprakAsha, the teacher of rAmAnuja. This is accepted by scholars like Patrick Olivelle who have studied many sannyAsa related texts.

  

This is a very important text that presents the SrIvaishNava perspective on the traditional debate whether saMnyAsin-s should keep or discard the yajnopavIta, whether direct jumping to saMnyAsa without going through gRhasthAshrama is prohibited or allowed and whether the staff should be ekadaNDa or tridaNDa.

  

Best regards,

Vidyasankar
