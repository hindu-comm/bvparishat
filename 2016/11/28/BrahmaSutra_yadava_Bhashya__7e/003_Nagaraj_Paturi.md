Yadava Praksa's commentary is reported as 'lost'. <http://vishalagarwal.bharatvani.org/articles/acharyas/sudarsanasuri/works.htm>

  

  

1\. **Srutaprakasika**: A massive and a masterly sub commentary on the [Sri Bhasya](http://www.ramanuja.org/sv/acharyas/ramanuja/sribhashya.html) (which itself is a commentary on the Brahmasutras composed by Sri Ramanuja). It is considered the best of all the extant sub commentaries on the Sri Bhasya. When Sri Vedanta Desika fled to Mysore after the sack of the Srirangam temple by the iconoclast Muslim armies, he settled down at a place called Satyamangalam or Satyakalam, where he taught this text to many disciples and kept it from extinction. The Srutaprakasika is an ideal commentary in many different ways. Its explanations are clear and are neither too elaborate nor too brief. The accessories of each topic of discussion (adhikaranas) are stated clearly and the development of thought is clearly delineated from chapter to chapter, from section to section and from topic to topic. The commentary explains the appropriateness of each sentence and the order in which they occur. It highlights the significance of particular choices of words. At the beginning of each topic, it lists a chain of possible objections and the reply thereto. Again, at the end of each adhikarana, the interpretations of Sri Shankaracharya, Sri Bhaskara Bhatta and Sri Yadava Prakasa are stated and refuted or reviewed. In the beginning sections of the sub commentary, these three predecessors of Sri Ramanuja are normally mentioned by name, but thereafter, they are mentioned as �pare�, �apare� and �anye�, always in that order. Therefore, it is possible to determine which of the three commentators is referred to in all cases. The importance of Srutaprakasika here lies in the fact that it is possible to reconstruct the entire commentary of Sri Yadava Prakasa (now lost) on the Brahmasutras from it. Particularly significant is the fact that Sri Yadava Prakasa frequently interprets the Brahmasutras in a manner different from the other traditional commentaries and seems to impart a quasi-validity to the Samkhya and other schools of Vedic philosophy. Secondly, the Srutaprakasika has long quotations from the Sailali Brahman- a lost Vedic text that belonged to the Sailali recension of the Rigveda (no longer extant). The interpretations of a certain �Sri Vatsanka Misra� are also quoted under the comment on the first four aphorisms. It is unclear if these are from the work of Sri Kuruttalvan (the disciple of Sri Ramanuja, and author of a commentary on the Dramida Bhasya) or the Sri Vatsanka referred to by Sri Yamunacharya in his Atmasiddhi (author of a commentary on the Brahmasutras). \[Viraraghavacharya 1967\]
