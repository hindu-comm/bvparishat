Can someone please help me in finding the oldest printed Sanskrit books on the Internet.  
  
Wikipedia entry on Hitopadesha says it was the first book printed in Nagari script but I am yet unable to find the book. Please help.  
  
Also, I remember seeing a fairly old Goolge book which mentioned in its forward, in Sanskrit, something like "**this books applies a new approach in printing Sanskrit by giving spaces between पद's that don't have सन्धि between them**".  
  
I want to see the early historical revolutions in printing and writing Sanskrit.  
  
Also, if somebody can manage, please give a link to a digital image of a manuscript in Nagari that explicitly uses symbols for anunasikas and doesn't use anuswar symbol. (where **गच्छन्ति** is **not** written **गच्छंति**.)
