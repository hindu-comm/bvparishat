WAVES CONFERENCE 2016. WAS ORGANISED BY THE WORLD ASSOCIATION FOR VEDIC STUDIES,(US), AND WAVES INDIA IN COLLABORATION WITH JNU.

  

AFTER PAPERS WERE SUBMITTED FOR WAVES2016,SUDDENLY JNU ORGANIZERS CHANGE
CONFERENCE NAME RETAINING SAME DATE, SAME VENUE, AND SAME SUBMITTED PAPERS. I (AND LIKE ME MANY OTHERS) WITHDREW OUR PAPERS AS IT WAS MEANT FOR WAVES 2016, REQUESTING DELETION OF MY NAME FROM LIST ON JNU- WEBSITE. BUT IT STILL APPEARS THERE. THIS IS CALLED "BAITE AND SWITCH"
A CRIME IN US. AND IN INDIA?
