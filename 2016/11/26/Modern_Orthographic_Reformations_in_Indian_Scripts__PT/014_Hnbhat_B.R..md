A sentence is spoken as संंहिता as a single utterence in noormal speech and there is no necessity to read also as a single utterence for facility and पदपाठ as split words for learing for beginners now a days who have no habit of reading a verse or sentence in a single utterence. This is the requirement of speech as in every day language in any other language.

  

In written language, स्ंहिता is optional and this option can be exercised with punctuations, like comma, semicolon, coon dash used so as to clear the विवक्षा of the speaker. Hence orthography cannot facilitate utterence of श्लोक or वाक्य as has been specied वाक्ये सा विवक्षामपेक्षते. In श्लोक, पाद is considered as a पद, and श्लोकार्ध is normally split according to the meteres used.

  

This has been discrussed in bvp long ago and you can search and find the last discussion. I cannot exactly remember the thread. Some one may remember.
