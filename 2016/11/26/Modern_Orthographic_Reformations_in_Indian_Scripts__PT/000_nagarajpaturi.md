Branching out from the thread on Marathi Vyutpattikosha:

  

Prof. BVK Shastry's question :

  

Namaste Paturi ji



Thanks for your valuable observations and pointing the following. I am putting them together before formally articulating my
clarification/question request.



***Observed Points in the post***:



1.a) ‘scripting convention changes’ in \< local Dekkhani speakers of Hyderabad> and the observation \< But in the local pronunciation , the distinction between dantya and taalavya ch does not exist \>.



1.b) Education about the scripting of regional language in school \< Till recently Telugu children were taught two different orthographic symbols for the two. During modern orthographic reformations they removed the symbol for dantya ch considering it obsolete. \>



1.c) \< they put the Telugu script symbol for the digit 2 above the script symbol for ch>.





***2. Clarification /Question request ***:



2.a) \< On 1.c- ‘ they ’…. 1.b) ‘ till recently’…> : What was the trigger and time line when ‘ learning model of orthography of
telugu regional language got changed for ‘Telugu children’ ?



 Was it a quiet, unnoticed issue ? **OR** Initiative from some scholar-administrators brilliant idea to impose ‘ uniform simplified scripting for many (south) Indian languages’ **OR** some printer who found a convenient mechanism to solve a composing problem ?




 How is the TELUGU –TEXT- CHAACTER- READING Taught in schools , by what norms of ‘ linguistics for regional language education’ ? Is it aligned to local pronunciation ? Anglicized ? Sanskritized ?



 \[ Note: Similar conventions have been adapted by Maharashtrian Printers, in previous centuries, in printing ‘ Veda Books’ using Devanagari Script and Marathy Orthography based type-faces. For more details, explore the introduction of sign conventions in introduction part, books printed by Satwalekar\].
These conventions of local context and technology have created a ‘ irreversible impact on the way of reading the printed text, causing a great split between the voice traditions ( relied upon by traditional schools) and Print-Symbol book based Transliterations of Vedas by ( relied upon by Out of India – Scholars of Veda ‘ Unbound by norms of
Tradition’.) This over-ride of ‘ scripted symbol over the live voice tradition and scant respect for ‘ Voice guidance rules (Shikshaa) placed as foundation at early schooling for linguistic studies of Sanskrit’- has percolated to become an integral part of many digital standards and software’s; causing confusion on what is the right shape of the ‘ character in which language tag and how to associate a phonetic value for it’?







2.b) Professor Deshpande has noted the challenge in associating the TEXT READING / PRONUNCIATION OF SCRIPT SYMBOL in MARATHI
ORTHOGRAPHY , which needs to be learnt in a ‘ Native speaker Natural way’.

 How will IPA/ Diacritics convention/ Harvard Kyoto widely adapted in UNICODE help in resolving / facilitating this ‘ pronunciation distinctions’ OR even the orthographic distinctions for regional languages of India ?

 Is it to be treated as a ‘ limitation of current typography related technology’ –( An issue I am working through my project of ‘Shruti-Kranti’) to build a language appropriate technology, in contrast to ‘ English dependent Indian Language representation conventions’?

BVK Sastry
