I guess **Dr PRamanujan, Sri Nityananda Misra, and Dr. BVK Sastry
**have been steadily concerned with these issues. Would be ideal if they can have a discussion, including others serious about this, and proffer suggestions to the competent authorities.

  

Prof **Varakhedi** would do well to take this up as a key issue in the conf he is organising shortly, and have a full-scale session on this issue, which is rather serious, and should not be left to the whims of amateurs/merely those under heavy political patronage in the past.

  

The South Indian clout - which had its key say in TDIL, and was inimical to Sanskrit (conveniently branding it North Indian/Brahmin/Aryan) - has done no small damage, I gather. Time to put things on the right track.

  

Thanks to BVK Sastry for raising his voice here.
