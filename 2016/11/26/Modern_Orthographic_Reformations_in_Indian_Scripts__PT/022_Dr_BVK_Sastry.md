Namaste



Responding to the observation \< **Sivasenani Nori**: the modern destructive reform \> and \< **Nagaraj Paturi**: 'script reformation movement' …. 'movement' born out of 'modern' jnaanodaya , to be more precise, jnaanodayapaaravas'ya born out of modern 'education', >



1. Awareness of what ‘ has happened to the Indian Language Scripts in the last few centuries is something that is surfacing now, unraveling as a part of triggered discussions in these posts. This study, for the purpose of a proposed panel, may deserve a time framing describable as
:

- 1a. \< Post Independence Indian School Education systems in Regional Languages related scripting \> **OR**

- 1b. \< Shift in Regional language learning-scripting models from Native mode to Anglicized Montessori Education paradigm \> **OR**

- 1c. \< Post Hand scripting by pen/pencil /chalk mode to write the visual of language character by hand movement - to - the keying in mode
to display the visual of language character on screen, by key press/touch \>



2. The ***follow up questions*** on these consequence of this would be an important point in reshaping the Indian Language studies: In Class room or Computational Programming models for Standard and dialectics of languages. Unless there is a ‘ language speaking – using –auditing community out there, such deliberations become a matter of ‘ academic interest, which is precisely what ‘ classical status of a language means’.



***What is classical language status ?*** For definition and debate on criterion of classical language status ( for Tamil), refer article of V. C. Kulandaiswamy : <http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/criteria-for-classical-language-status/article482123.ece?css=print>
and <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_language> . 

In short, Keeping in mind the universally accepted characteristics of classical literature which qualify a language for classical status, one may notice that all the attributes to define the ‘Classical Status of a language’ is derived mainly from Greek and Latin literary traditions, both of which fail to pass the Brahmi language Standard of \< Typology- Phonology –Equivalence in Scripting.> i.e. Any language scripting convention that stands by the ‘ spelling feature’ fails to be a class of ‘Brahmi’ language family.



***Why is this a critical issue ?*** The roots of ‘Classical language’
is dovetailed and fitted in to the study of ‘Historical Linguistics’ , Understanding Indian Languages history in the light of theology from Old Testament related Tower of Babel Story . 



For details on how this ‘Language family debate is closely linked to the Tower of Babel and Sanskrit studies, please refer to Introduction pages in M.W Sanskrit Dictionary and other resources like:
<http://aboutworldlanguages.com/language-families> ; <https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/hf/ikos/EXFAC03-AAS/h05/larestoff/linguistics/Chapter%205.(H05).pdf>



***Follow up questions ***

******

**2a. Is any one aware of comparable phenomenon to what has happened in Telugu/ Marathi / Kannada - for rest of the languages of India ?
(Bijoy ji had pointed something on Odisha language. I am aware of how Neapalese language – Newari has been shrinking and loosing the ‘ natural language accent’ related meaning association.
([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newar_language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newar_language)
) Ceylonese languages have a similar disconnect in usage and scripting. **

****

**2b. Given the ‘rigidity of the Devanagari’, how study of Samskruth itself has been influenced by such changes in post colonial period ?
\[ - And this, surely, will surely kick open a demand to review / defend the claim ‘we have a millennia continuation of unchanged language of ‘Gods’ in the kurukshetra of ‘Battle: Sanskrit’ \]. **

****

**Helpful suggestions and inputs appreciated, to facilitate the proposed
panel discussion.**

****

**Regards**

**Subject:** Re: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Modern Orthographic Reformations in Indian Scripts



Here mention of one particular aspect of the older Telugu script would provide a contrast to the modern destructive reform. For a long time in Telugu, there was a half-anusvaara, called అరసున్న (arasunna, half-anusvaara) in Telugu. This was used only inacca tenuguwords (pure Telugu words,i.e. those not derived from Sanskrit) like vaaఁ Du #(వాఁడు). This half-anusvaara is not pronounced, but recollects that many centuries earlier this used to be an anusvaara, like in the wordvaaMDu (వాండు). The old full anusvaara seems to survive in some words and usages like boddiMka (\<boddu - big, eeMga - fly = cockroach) (బొద్దింక)and ayinaaMka / ayinaaka (అయినాంక/ అయినాక, afterwards). This olderorthographic practice has retained historical information, whereas the modern "simplifications"are destructive.
