Namaste.  
  

With reference to the above discussion, I would like to mention that when C-DAC proposed ISCII - Indian Standard Code for Information Interchange to account for the Indian languages, an attempt was made to enhance Devanagari Script in order to accommodate sounds from other languages such as South Indian, Bengali, etc. This allowed Devanagari to represent the texts from other Indian languages faithfully.  
  

I have enclosed the document on ISCII, which was later adapted for Unicode.  
  
  

With regards,  

Amba Kulkarni
