Recently a Marxist woman writer in Telugu published a book on the Vedaswith her characteristic mocking at the 'Hindu' sources. On

  

the cover page of the book, she printed రుగ్వేదం (रुग्वेदं) for ఋగ్వేదం (ऋग्वेदं). A senior Arya Samaj woman (ascetic) Veda-Sanskrit

  

scholar , looking at this, without knowing that that was orthographic reformation, innocently asked, " Doesn't she know that writing this

  

way it means the Veda of diseases ?"
