Friends,

  

I am an Oriya speaker. What i have noticed is that there are two kinds of use. In Puri, where I come from,

the common people would use each letter clearly irrespective of their "progress" in life. But in Bhubaneswar

people would sayभुव्-नेश्वर्, but there rural folks would maintain the vowels. Then a name likeप्रशान्त would

distort toप्रसान्त् . I have thought that the latter is possibly due to the anglicized transliteration that is

carelessly applied, remnant of the colonial legacy. My own nameविजयमोहन is shortened toविजय for

convenience and then distorted toविजोय् because of transliteration triggered by Bengali officials. In Oriya,

we don't have theव as a separate sound and we combine withब like in Punjabi, so finally the concept

becomes another label.

  

I also heard that there was a late movement by some pseudo linguists to do "orthography reform" in Oriya

by conforming to the current practice which changes every day through the influence of the urdu media.

Somebody somewhere discovered that the occupation of a people is easier if you throw away their

language. Lately I am being exposed to earlier US history where atrocities were done to force the slaves

change their names to English-sounding names. The technique perhaps has not abated. There are

thousands of "Raj" or "Sam" are operating on these assumed names.

  

Let me say finally as a honor to my grandfather the name that was given:

  

बिजयमोहन
