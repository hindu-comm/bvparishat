Namaste



1) Thanks to All who have poured information, details, concerns on the topic of ‘ Disconnect of Phonology and Typology of Indian Language scripts’. Even though one root of ‘Brahmi’ is recognized for Indic languages, the failure points are well articulated by Professor Deshpande and pinpointed by Amba ji.



 a) \< orthography fails to accurately represent the language as pronounced. Marathi grammarians have discussed these issues going back to 1850s, but the orthography remains unchanged. The Modi 

 script that was used for Marathi is even more reductive in this respect, not representing the distinction between short and long vowels, leaving it to the intuition of the native speaker/reader/writer> .



 b) The ( ISCII Standards) document does not account for the dual pronunciations of 'ca' varga, because, this document describes the coding scheme for the basic units of 'script', and does not deal with

 the pronunciation.



2) In effect, it has been a challenge to ‘ Truly Read What was supposed to be a True (Brahmi design of ) Writing True Voice’ . (
Just recollected the part of Subhahsita : swayamapi likhitam pathitum na jaanaati ).

 If English seems to be suffering from the ‘Spelling phobia’ to
extract at the right pronunciation and limps with IPA –Diacritic convention n, Indic Brahmi scripting seems to be suffering from a plurality of associated

 pronunciations for a given script with no clue on what the true pronunciation is.



3) It is in such a muddled scenario, ISCII added more symbols to the generally known repertoire of devanagari characters with the holy intention of ‘ inclusive accommodation of all sounds and scripts of all indian languages under the Brahmi group ’. But the introduction of these symbols in education system, schooling and other major places has remained a wishful to be done act.



 When I read Hindi published news papers from North India, using occasionally the ISCII symbols, I get confused on how to pronounce / read the page. And it becomes worse when some screen readers / digital programs are run on the file. And same scenario applies to ‘ OCR’ related ! 



**4 ) Now, articulating the issue for the proposed Conference at Chinmaya International, I propose a ‘ Special Interest Group - Panel –Workshop’ under the theme title: ‘ Digital Standards and Representation of Phonology and Typology of Indian Language scripts: with specific focus on Devanagari script’. **

****

**Here below is the abstract for the proposed panel **.



**Title:** ‘ **Digital Standards and Representation of Phonology and Typology of Indian Language scripts: with specific focus on Devanagari script’. A review and Overview.**





**Abstract : **The Typology of Devanagari –Brahmi Scripting , adapts a norm of ‘True Voice Scripting’. This demands a bi-directional compliance : (i) Scribe as Spoken. (ii) Read as Scribed. This standard is embedded in the words : ‘ Ukta- Lekhana’ ( having a focus on scripting –reading process) ; ‘ yathaa- likhita –Paathaka’ ( having a focus on reader –scribe persona) . This is the core essence of the traditional discipline called ‘ Lipi-Shaastra’- a listed discipline in
Artha and Kama Shaastra. The roots of this convention goes back to pre-Christian era, certainly prior to 700 BCE.



The ‘ Lipi-Shaastra of Brahmi ( and Prakrut, Dramida) languages seems to have a broken tradition and is not understood sufficiently . This has been one of the blocking points in making advances in understanding the native tradition of Brahmi languages Typology. Especially the way Samskruth Texts were scripted through the centuries in several Indian languages. An understanding of this discipline is believed to help re-construct the discipline of Swadesi Vernacular Typology and link it to the language appropriate phonology. This will facilitate the proper reading of the resource texts and manuscripts.



This Special Interest Group deliberates on Digital Standards that cover the Phonology and Typology of Brahmi languages with specific focus on Devanagari script. The purpose is to make a review of current standards and practices, identify and make a overview recommendation as needed
for bridging the disconnect of typography and phonology for Devanagari script in digital standards.



Look forward for the team members and panelists.



Thanks to KSK, Paturi, and all.
