It is interesting to note that the document provided by Professor Amba Kulkarni makes no reference to or provision for the dual pronunciation of Marathi च, छ, ज,झ. The Marathi native speakers have not demanded distinct orthography for this in all the recent reforms in Maharashtra.
This is not the only case where the orthography fails to accurately represent the language as pronounced. The loss of short "a" at the end of words or often in the middle of the words is not represented in writing: Marathi अपमान pronounced as अप् मान्. This is also the case with Hindi writing. Marathi grammarians have discussed these issues going back to 1850s, but the orthography remains unchanged. The Modi script that was used for Marathi is even more reductive in this respect, not representing the distinction between short and long vowels, leaving it to the intuition of the native speaker/reader/writer.
