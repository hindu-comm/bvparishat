\>What was the trigger and time line when ‘ learning model of orthography of telugu regional language got changed for ‘Telugu children’ ? **

**************

* *Was it a quiet, unnoticed issue ? **OR** Initiative from some scholar-administrators brilliant idea to impose ‘ uniform simplified scripting for many (south) Indian languages’ **OR** some printer who found a convenient mechanism to solve a composing problem ?

  

---------- The 'script reformation movement' in Telugu was not quiet. As with any other 'movement' born out of 'modern' jnaanodaya , to be more precise, jnaanodayapaaravas'ya born out of modern 'education', there was a huge drumming and hungaamaa about it, expressions of Indian white men's burden, lamentations/pity about lack of such an awareness among traditional scholars, public at large not being as excited as required about the emergency of the reformations etc.

  

It was not on the lines of"brilliant idea to impose ‘ uniform simplified scripting for many (south) Indian languages" . I don't remember anyone arguing for reforms on these lines. It was on the lines of 'simplification' removing the vestigial elements in the script which are no longer required for a new changed modern 'colloquial' language that acquired the position of the standard language. Removal of script symbols ఋ (r̥) both independent andmātrā aspects, ఱ ( originally retroflex r, calledśakaṭa rēpha), longer ఋ (r̥), dantya ch and j etc., were all proposed on the basis of the argument that they were no longer pronounced the way they were supposed to be.

  

What is interesting is recently during a workshop organized by CIIL at Telugu Akademi , for preparing style manual for Telugu, (discussed in an older thread) a highly accomplished modern linguist of Telugu who was one of the script reformers responsible for the removal of all these symbols , regretted his young days activity and said all those symbols need to get reintroduced. What is more, he insisted that what was called as valapala gilaka( which looked something like devanagari symbol for 9 and used to denote initial r of a cluster but placed after the symbol for the syllable with the next consonant to r and the vowel of the cluster syllable (e.g., r of the र्ति ) ) must be introduced. His argument in favour of the restoration was that the Telugu children of the present generation should be facilitated to read the old prints/publications of classical Telugu literature and should be made to think of the history of the sounds represented by those symbols. I asked him whether it was not too late as the damage is already done to an irreparable extent. He said no good work is too late. With a strong will and effort it should be possible even now. I was pleasantly astounded.

  

News paper publishers were also responsible in the implementation of this 'progressive reform' born out of the feeling of Indian white man's burden.

  

You were right in guessing that these messiahs were in scholar-administrator roles at that time.
