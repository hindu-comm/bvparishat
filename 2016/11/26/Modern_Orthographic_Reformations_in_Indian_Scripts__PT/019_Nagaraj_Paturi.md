Thanks for excellent example of what the so called reform does. It does not hurt to make the children aware that the ardhaanusvaara is used only in writing classical Telugu and not in the contemporary standard Telugu. But not to make them aware of the existence of such a symbol, its purpose, meaning and utility in the classical Telugu and to remove the symbol from the computer keyboards and IMEsis not justified. As you noted about Iscript, in the Telugu Indic Input 2 IME that I use also ardhaanusvaara is included. I am grateful to the creators of this IME. ( I think some software professionals with liking for our heritage arecontributing such great tools.)

  

This software tool has a facility to type s'akaTarEpha (retroflex r ఱ)too.But there is no facility for typing its germination. The longer version of ఋ (ऋ )'s maatraa as in పితృ (पितृ). ![Inline image 1](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/44f42670512c0/image.gif?part=0.1&view=1)
can not be typed.

  

  

The same persons whoin their aadhunikajnaanodayapaaravas'ya opposed teaching these symbols to children are now shedding crocodile tears for the inability of the present generation youngsters in understanding such nuances of classical Telugu.
