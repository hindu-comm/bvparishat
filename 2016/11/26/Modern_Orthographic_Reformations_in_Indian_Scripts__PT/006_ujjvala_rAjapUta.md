Similarly, isn't writing Sanskrit and other Indian languages with space between "words". Note that a "word" doesn't always represent a पद or even a collection of पदs altered in संहिता, for example रामो गच्छति, here there is a space even between पदs altered by संहिता, so what is a word in modern Sanskrit writing? A very unnatural and complex concept, indeed.  
  
People often fear reading old manuscripts just because they are accustomed to reading with spaces.  
  
If we write Sanskrit with spaces because it helps new students to learn easily, then why not provide पदपाठ instead?
