That is what is funny (not so funny in fact), Prof. Kannan that exactly those who were actively engaged in disorienting people from the classical Indian literatures are now shouting from roof tops in apparent lamenting tone that there are no more students interested in classical Kannada literature, classical Telugu literature etc. One of the noted American scholars was saying similar things in the context of classical status to Kannada. They say that they searched for classical Kannada scholars and they could find none. Is this not an exaggeration? I can list a very big number for Telugu. I think it should be possible for Kannada too. I don't know why they paint such a dim picture.
