Here mention of one particular aspect of the older Telugu script would provide a contrast to the modern destructive reform. For a long time in Telugu, there was a half-anusvaara, called అరసున్న (arasunna, half-anusvaara) in Telugu. This was used only inacca tenuguwords (pure Telugu words,i.e. those not derived from Sanskrit) like vaaఁ Du #(వాఁడు). This half-anusvaara is not pronounced, but recollects that many centuries earlier this used to be an anusvaara, like in the wordvaaMDu (వాండు). The old full anusvaara seems to survive in some words and usages like boddiMka (\<boddu - big, eeMga - fly = cockroach) (బొద్దింక)and ayinaaMka / ayinaaka (అయినాంక/ అయినాక, afterwards). This olderorthographic practice has retained historical information, whereas the modern "simplifications"are destructive.

#This half-anusvaara is still available in Iscript, so I used the same. It isbasically a semi-circle, like the Roman letter "c", with the arc describing less than 180 degrees maybe.
