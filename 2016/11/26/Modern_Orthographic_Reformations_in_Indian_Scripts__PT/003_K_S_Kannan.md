Prof . Paturi's post makes some important points.

I would like to make an additional point.

  

Just as there has all along been an endeavour, for over a century perhaps, to enable the Roman script to competently represent all sounds in all important languages of the world, there must be similar **efforts to enrich andenable**ALL Indian scripts to encode the phones of ALL Indian languages *at least :*innovations must be welcomed.

  

The stupid attempts of sabotage by way of lopping off *existent*elements from scripts - *ṛ*, for example, from Kannada orthography, or fusing the representations of *ś* and *ṣ* into but one, as in Telugu in recent times - were egged on by the colonial-inspired hatred for Sanskrit, the intellectual language of India.
