Dear Prof. B V K Shastry garu,

  

\> How is the TELUGU –TEXT- CHAACTER- READING Taught in schools , by what norms of ‘ linguistics for regional language education’ ? Is it aligned to local pronunciation ? Anglicized ? Sanskritized ?

...................

\> Is it to be treated as a ‘ limitation of current typography related technology’ –( An issue I am working through my project of ‘Shruti-Kranti’) to build a language appropriate technology, in contrast to ‘ English dependent Indian Language representation conventions’?

  

----------- I mentioned in my earlier posts on the orthography related threads on this list, that the scripts of each language suits the phonemic system of that language, following the principle of minimal tools for maximum use.

  

It is a popular level misunderstanding, not based on a professional understanding of linguistics, phonology, orthography etc., to think that --- "this 'sound' (popular parlance for the technical 'phone')has no (script) symbol in this language. That is the weakness of this 'language' (keeping script in mind)" But most scripts have a symbol or a sequence/group of symbolsfor a phoneme of that language leaving all the allophones 'within' that phoneme to be represented by that symbol or a sequence/group of symbols. Classic example of that such a misunderstanding is thepopular impression (sometimes unfortunately among Tamilians themselves) that Tamil script having the same symbol for p and b or k and g etc. is its weakness. But the fact is that in Tamil phonology, p and b are not two different phonemes. They are allophones 'within' the same phoneme. i.e. Tamil speakers do not pronounce p in a certain position of a word (say, immediately after m ) and do not pronounce b in a certain position of a word (say, in the initial position of a word). They pronounce invariably p in the word-initial position and invariably b immediately after m .Sohaving the same symbol for p and b does not cause any difficulty to them. p and b are called(mutual)allophones. They together constitute a phoneme. One symbol for one phoneme (i.e. for both the allophones 'within' that phoneme ). Native speakers learnwhat to pronounce for which symbol naturally.

  

"IPA/ Diacritics convention/ Harvard Kyoto widely adapted in UNICODE" are needed only for the non-native readers ofmaterial in a certain language.

  

Native script systems evolved through -handed down from-centuries of use arenotSanskritized nor Anglicized nor even English-dependent.

It is the "IPA/ Diacritics convention/ Harvard Kyoto widely adapted in UNICODE" which is English/Roman script dependent. But to resist such an international standardization serves no purpose. Need of the hour is to make the younger generation aware of the right scientific understanding of the issue, remove the self-hate born out of notions such as bad /weak script, Sanskritized script etc.

  

(Modern script reformations in the next post.)

PS : typing the present post was begun before the arrival of Prof. Kannan's post. This post has no correspondence with that post.
