We have to consider that a language like standard Hindi or Marathi is used by people originally speaking very distinct dialects. In the case of a Hindi text, some might read "अपमान" as अपमान्, others as अप्मान्। But according to the standards, one has to write the word as अपमान। That is the norm. If there needs to a be a change in the spelling of अपमान, should it be changed to अपमान् or अप्मान्। That remains the question. And I don't think one can give a reasonable answer to this without disregarding a particular class of people. So we try to avoid getting into the issue and keep using the established norms.
