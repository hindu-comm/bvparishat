Dr. Deshpande was extremely kind in uploading this on my request.

The scan appears incomplete.

Page number abruptly changes from ८३ (83) to ७७८ (778) after four pages.

Does the French Institute still have these scans and in case so, will they be kind enough to share them?

Does anyone else have the hard copy of the book and be kind enough to share?

The second volume starts from page ८२७ (827). Hence the last page scanned on vol 1 seems correct, but pages 84 - 777 of vol 1 are missing.

svasti,  
 bhavaaniibhaaratii jayatetamaam,  
 shrivathsa.
