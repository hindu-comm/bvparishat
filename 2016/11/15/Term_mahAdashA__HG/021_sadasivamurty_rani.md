Prof. Sunil Ji and other learned members,

Pranams to all.

With regard to the distinction between RAHU and KETU I would like to place here the Pauranic and Astronomical versions with in my limits of comprehension having felt the need of such distinction.

  

From various Pauranic accounts available in tradition about RAHU and KETU, these two are not two separate demons. Only one demon cut into two parts by Vishnu in the Mohini incarnation. Out of the two parts the upper part is called RAHU and the Lower part is called KETU. (अमृतं योऽपिबद्दैत्यस्तं वैकुण्ठो द्विधाऽच्छिनत् । राहुरुत्तरकायोऽस्य पूर्वकायोऽभवद्ध्वज:॥) Here interestingly the word DHVAJA is used synonymously used with KETU.

  

1. Because of drinking Amrta by the time he was cut the demon mysteriously starting existing in two forms. As the same demon is made into two and started existing in two forms the same mother Simhika could be the mother of both. Hence there is no separate mother mentioned to KETU. This as far as the pauranic episode is considered.

  

2. As far as the ancient Indian astronomical texts are concerned RAHU and KETU are the Northern and Southern Lunar Nodes (Ascending and Descending Nodes of the Moon). To say more clearly Rahu is the Northern or Ascending Node and Ketu is the Descending Node.) Depending on the position of the Sun and the Moon at the time of Eclipse some times by the Ascending Node and some times by the Descending nodes these two Grahas (Sun or Moon) can be over shadowed. When either of them is over shadowed by the Ascending Node we call it Rahu grasta grahana and when they are over shadowed by the Descending Node we call it Ketu grasta Grahana. So It need not always be Rahu grahasta grahana or Ketu grasta grahana exclusively.

  

The popular astronomical scholars in this group like Prof. Rama subrahmanyam Garu, IIT, Mumbai can enlighten with more information with regard to the Rahu and Ketu eclipses.

  

3. The comet in Sanskrit is often called DHUMAKETU and not merely KETU. If in any sloka it is found as KETU it could be for the sake of metrical brevity and not confirmedly to identify the comet with KETU GRAHA.

  

As far as the Indian Astronomy is concerned KETU GRAHA is only one. But the number of comets beyond three crores: To say exactly they are 3,07,03,221 comets according to the following quote from an ancient text Kriyasara Tantra.

बाणस्थ**धूमकेतूनां** मण्डलस्याष्टमान्तरे।

त्रिकोटि सप्तलक्ष त्रि सह्स्र द्विशतोपरि ॥

एकविंशतिसङ्ख्याका: वर्तन्ते **धूमकेतव:**॥ - A Citation from Kriyasara Tantra

Hence KETU GRAHA is different from the comet DHUMA KETU.

Warm Regards,

Dear friends,  
  

I just looked back at one of my replies and there was slip. I am very sorry for that. Kindly permit me to correct that. Svarabhanu's (i.e., Rahu's) mother was Singhika and nit Chaya. Chaya was the mother of Shani.  
  

Regards,
