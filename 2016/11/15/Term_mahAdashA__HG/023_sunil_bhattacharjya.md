Dear Prof. Rani Sadasiva Murthyji and Prof. Nagaraja Paturiji,  
  

I remember seeing a paper by Prof. Narahari Acharji, quite sometime ago, where he quoted Varahamihira and identified Ketu as Comet. Probably he found the Comet Hailey appearing in 3067 BCE, which is his date of the Mahabharata war and that also shows the possiblity of this comet appearing in 3139 BCE, which is the date of the Mahabharata war, found by me.  
  

Prof. Achar is a member of this group and I hope he will respond and tell us about his finding.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
