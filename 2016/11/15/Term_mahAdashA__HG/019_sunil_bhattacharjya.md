Dear friends,  
  

Permit me to add that there is another Dasha system called Ashtottari, which does not count Ketu. The full span is 108 years. In fact, there are several other dasha systems also, which seem to have come to disuse in course of time, but a very careful astrologer may still use these.  
  

Regards,
