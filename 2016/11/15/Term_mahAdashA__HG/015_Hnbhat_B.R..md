Yes. If it would mean a big bite of bread in English.

  

As per Shabdakalpadruma cited, as if it is bitten,*daśatīva.*--

  

  

Literally mah*ā+daśā may be translated as great bite.*

  

Conventionallly, it denotes *the great period of time* from birth *occupied by the graha. in the zodaic divisions*.

  

mah*ā+daśā, antar+daśā, anddaśā are all* portions of life span occupied the *graha*-s.
