In fact, planet is not a good translation of graha.

  

'Rationalists' and many other such antagonists of ancient knowledge keep questioning this : Sun which you list as a grahais not a planet andEarth which is a planet is not listed among your grahas, they say.

  

Graha means a anastronomical body from which the Earth receives the 'effects'.

  

Since the Earth itself is the receiver , it is not listedamong the grahas.

  

Since the Earth *receives* 'effects' from the Sun, it is included among the grahas. 

  

Unlike in the case of modern idea of 'planet', self-luminous and non-self-luminous is not the criteria for identifying a body as graha.

  

Rahu and Kethu being chaaya grahas or being associated with eclipses is different from Rahu and Ketu being certain positions of moon's orbits. It is in the later sense that they are described as entering, existing in or exiting a certain sign of zodiac.
