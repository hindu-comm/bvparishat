I already said in one of my posts in this thread that Rahu and Ketu are the positions of the moon's orbit. But I said, chaayaagrahas issue is different, meaning that this concept may not be connected to the explanation of eclipses.

  

Poojya Prof. Rani's words below provide that connection too:

  

As far as the ancient Indian astronomical texts are concerned RAHU and KETU are the Northern and Southern Lunar Nodes (Ascending and Descending Nodes of the Moon). To say more clearly Rahu is the Northern or Ascending Node and Ketu is the Descending Node.) Depending on the position of the Sun and the Moon at the time of Eclipse some times by the Ascending Node and some times by the Descending nodes these two Grahas (Sun or Moon) can be over shadowed. When either of them is over shadowed by the Ascending Node we call it Rahu grasta grahana and when they are over shadowed by the Descending Node we call it Ketu grasta Grahana. So It need not always be Rahu grahasta grahana or Ketu grasta grahana exclusively.(Highlighting mine)

  

The myth of only one demon cut into two parts also matches well with the fixed relative positions of the two which give the impression of the two making parts of the same entity.
