Namaste,  
  

Prof. Paturiji told about the Mahadasha. I only wish to add that of the nine grahas, seven are planets, Rahu is the the chaayaa-garaha or the planetary shadows, which cover the Sun and the Moon on the occasions of the solar ans lunar eclipses. Rahu in Vedas is called Svarbhanu (Rig Veda - 5.3.8. That is why in the Mahabharata Ketu indicates comet. Prof. Narahari Achar has done some work on this.
