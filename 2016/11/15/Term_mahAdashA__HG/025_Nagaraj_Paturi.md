After going through various sources and discussions on Lunar nodes, Rahu and Ketu the following is what I found:

  

1\. Almost all western astrologer-writers acknowledge Ksheera saagara mathana and the splitting of the body of a demon-snake into two : head and tail , Rahu and Ketuas the myhification of the astrological concept of lunar nodes only. They see this as the Indian version of the lunar nodes being viewed as the head and tail of a dragon. All of them like the words Rahu and Ketu and some of them use the term Rahu Ketu Axis to refer to the line joining the two lunar nodes.

  

2\. None of these sources quotes a book of ancient Indian astrology /astronomy while discussing this.

  

3\. Those who compare Hellenistic and Indian Astrology such as [this author](http://www.projecthindsight.com/articles/vedic.html) , say, " Indian astrology places far more importance on the lunar nodes than does Hellenistic, almost giving them the status of planets."

  

4. Earliest occurrence of the Ksheera saagara mathana narrative may give us a clue to the time of borrowing or indigenous origin of this important notion of Indian astrology.
