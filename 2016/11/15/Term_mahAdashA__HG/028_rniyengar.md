Dear Prof.Sadashivamurthy ji,

Sorry for the delay in responding. I like to politely point out that the 'Ketu' notation is not mentioned in the original text of SS. The commentary you have presented can not be an evidence of ancient use of Ketu as the descending node. I looked into several other siddhantic astronomy texts, all of them use the word ' paata" for the nodes. Kuppanna Shastri and KV Sarma are scholars who preserved and continued the legacy of traditional mathematical astronomy in our times. I found that they categorically deny that 'ketu' means 'descending node' in Hindu Astronomy. Please see the last para on p 68 and the first para of p. 69 attached herewith from their Panchasiddhaantika. My conclusion is that over the last few centuries (300-400 yrs) popular use influenced by story tellers and astrologers has attached such a meaning to the word Ketu, which always meant a visible object like a -flag, -staff, -tail -tuft which realistically matches with the visible object 'comet' and not the 'lunar node' which is just an imaginary point in space. It would be an interesting research topic for Ph.D students of Indology to investigate when, why and how such a meaning came into vogue.

best regards

RN Iyengar
