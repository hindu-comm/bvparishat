The terms mahadasa and dasa are technical words used in Indian Astrology and not any grammatical meaning that derivation gives::

  

"The Sanskrit term "Dasha" in Hindu astrology is used to indicate planetary periods. The planetary periods indicate when the good or bad effects are produced according to their placement by sign (Rasi), house (Bhava), combinations (Yogas or Raja Yogas) or aspects (Drishti). The Dasha Paddhati (system) of Directional Astrology is unique to the Hindus; it is found nowhere else."
