Namaste,  
  

What you are saying is correct from the heliocentric view. In geocentric viww the Sun is a planet.  
  

As regards the Ketu it is a comet. Probably the Hailey's comet. Svarbahnu, when causes eclipse of the Moon, it is Rahu and otherwise it is Ketu. That is my understanding from the Mahabharata.
