Hello M

  

महादशा is based on two root words - maha or mahat and dasha. Maha is 'the great', 'the vast'. The dasha is 'circumstances', 'state', 'a time-period'. It is a latter day word which literally could have meant a 'great time-period' or 'great steady state'. It has nothing to do with 9 grahas per-se as dasha-progressions could both be planetary or sign based.
