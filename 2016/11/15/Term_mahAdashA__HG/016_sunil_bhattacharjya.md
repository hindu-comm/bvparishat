Namaste,  
  

Kindly permit me to rewrite the following:

  

As regards the Ketu it is a comet. Probably the Hailey's comet. Svarbahnu, when causes eclipse of the Moon, it is Rahu and otherwise it is Ketu. That is my understanding from the Mahabharata.

The rewritten form is as follows:  

As regards the Ketu, it is a comet. Probably the Hailey's comet. Svarbahnu, when causes eclipse of the Moon, it is Rahu and when it causes the solar eclipse it is still Rahu (but called as ketu in astrology). That is my understanding from the Mahabharata. Further, In the Navagraha-stotram, the Rahu is born from the womb of Chaya or shadow, whereas Ketu is not, as Ketu's description is more like a comet.  

Regards,

Sunil KB.
