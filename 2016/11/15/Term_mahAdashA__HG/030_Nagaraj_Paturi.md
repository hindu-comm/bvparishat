# The Cosmology of the Bhagavata Purana: Mysteries of the Sacred Universe

By Richard L. Thompson,

  

[here](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?tab=wm#inbox/1590a588fc959296)  

  

The author argues that the Ketu as the headless part of the demon Rahu decapitated by Vishnu is parallel to the Dragon myths in the western tradition as St George's beheading of Dragon and angel Shamhursh beheading the eclipse dragon.

Whatever is the earliest occurrence of the narrative of Rahu/Svarbhanu getting beheaded is being seen as the time of myth-form being given to the astronomical understanding.
