\>महादशा is based on two root words - maha or mahat and dasha. Maha is 'the great', 'the vast'. The dasha is 'circumstances', 'state', 'a time-period'. It is a latter day word which literally could have meant a 'great time-period' or 'great steady state'. It has nothing to do with 9 grahas per-se as dasha-progressions could both be planetary or sign based.

No. As per शब्दकल्पद्रुम it is derived from √danśa = to bite.  

daśā, strī, (daśatīva . danśa + mūlavibhujādi-  
tvāt kaḥ . japajabhadahadaśeti nirddeśāt aki-  
tyapi nalopaḥ . yadvā, daśyate iti . guroścetyaṅ .  
tataṣṭāp .)  
= avasthā.
