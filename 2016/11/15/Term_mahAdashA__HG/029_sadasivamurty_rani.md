Dear Prof. RN Iyengar mahodaya!

Namaskarams.

As far as your earlier querying mail is concerned there is a question about the textual reference to both Rahu and Ketu.

  

To Say in your words Sir!

"I sincerely request you to quote the original Sanskrit verses which say so from the astronomicaltexts. I seem to have missed such ancient siddhantic astronomy texts."  

I quoted these two slokas : From the Spashtadhikara of Surya Siddhanta:

  

दक्षिणोत्तरतोऽप्येवं पातो **राहु:** स्वरंहसा।

विक्षिपत्यॆष विक्षेपं चन्द्रादीनामपक्रमात् ॥

उत्तराभिमुखं पातो विक्षिपत्यपरार्धग:।

ग्रह: प्रागुभगणार्धस्थो याम्यायामपकर्षति॥

Here my humble submission is :

1\. These two slokas are not the part of the commentary.

  

2\. Your question covers both the names : Rahu and Ketu if my comprehension of your querying mail goes well. I could succeed, I feel, at least in referring to RAHU as PATA and not as a mythological character.

  

3\. Here I again quote your words from your latest mail sir!

  

"*My conclusion is that over the last few centuries (300-400 yrs) popular use influenced by story tellers and astrologers has attached such a meaning to the word Ketu, which always meant a visible object like a -flag, -staff, -tail -tuft which realistically matches with the visible object 'comet' and not the 'lunar node' which is just an imaginary point in space.*"  

  

If a conclusion has been drawn by your noble self sir! my future answer will be mere silence only. If it is a pause for further hunt for any ancient reference for the word KETU I am not tired to join with you sir in such a search.

  

Only inconvenience with me is I am always in dearth of sufficient time to join with you all in very interesting discussions. I have had many beginnings in most of the ongoing discussions but without further extensions often. It is because of my being kidnapped by my TIME most of the times.

  

Here I would like to add one more thing though it is out of context.

I have been in repeated search for the text of NARADA SAMHITA from ORI of SV University. On the very next day to our conversation about NARADA SAMHITA I met Prof. Venkata Ramana Reddy the then Director of ORI. He promised me to get it for me on your behalf. He remembers you very well too. But on the very next day he has been appointed as the Director of National Manuscripts Mission, New Delhi and left to that place.

  

Ever since I had been to ORI several times to get the text for you. But those people so busy not spare even a little time to search for that text. After a few weeks they openly denied its availability.

  

I feel shy for not keeping up my word to you. 



Warm regards,

**Prof. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
