Hello Misra sir,  
  
Thank you for replying. I've gone through Rama Nath Sharma's text and this is what I could gather: "...the औ of the next rule will block आम् on the basis of परत्व."  
The subsequent सूत्र is औत् (7.3.118).  
  
But how can this be since the औ replacement is only for अङ्गs ending in इ and उ NOT BEING A नदी or घि. Essentially both सूत्रs work with regards to different अङ्गs? Former works for a नदी and the latter not for one. So how can there be a प्रतिषेध?
