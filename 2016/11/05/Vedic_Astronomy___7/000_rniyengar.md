Dear Scholars,

I have a text titled "Ancient Astronomy in Vedic Texts" prepared for the forthcoming Conference on Oriental Astronomy. The work may be still treated as a draft. A brief abstract is attached with this post. The full text (78 pages) can be accessed at;

There is more Indology and less (modern) astronomy in my article. I am fascinated by the way Vedic people were fascinated by the Sky. Some members here may be interested in my research. I welcome constructive discussions and observations.  

Regards

  

RN Iyengar
