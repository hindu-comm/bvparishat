Thank you Hari Parsad Dasji,  
  

Thank you for the reference. The book, which you mentioned, is good and it gives the reference to the relevant origial texts, but the photogaphs are not good at all. I have come across a book "Mudra Vijnan" by Neelam Pradip Sangvi. It is a hard copy in Hindi and it has excellent photographs, but without any reference to any original text.  
  

Regards,  

skb
