Dear friends,  
  

There are different Hasta-mudras, such as Vayu-mudra, Akash-mudra, Shunya-mudra, Prithvi-mudra, Prana-Mudra, Sankha-mudra, Dhyana-mudra, Surabhi-mudra, ashirvad-mudra, Parameshthi Mudra and several other mudras and their variations. These are separate from the mudras of Hathayoga such as Maha-mudra, Mahabandha-mudra, Mahaved-mudra, khechari-mudra, Sarvendriya-mudra and Vajoli-mudra and their variations. I am looking fpr any ancient texts on Hasta-mudras, giving all the details of the mudras, and preferably giving the respective diagrams. I shall be grateful if any scholar can help, as to how to procure such texts, preferably in pdf.  
  

Regards,
