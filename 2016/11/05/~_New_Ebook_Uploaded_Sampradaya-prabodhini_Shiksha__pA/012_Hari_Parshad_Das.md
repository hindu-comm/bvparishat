Well you've written the following:

So when you yourself introduced grammatical technicalities into interpreting the term 'ṭup' and then said that it sounds unusual, then it is but obvious that i should ask you the basis of the understanding that grammatical rules have to be followed even while forming terms for lāghava or mukha-sukha. It will be nice if the logical reasons behind this can be known.

Well this was not even intended to be a discussion thread in the first place. I had specifically kept it under the category of 'announcements'. I've said previously that i recalled from memory what i had read. Maybe the source is not reliable for you. In that case i would suggest that you yourself can give a good interpretation of the term 'ṭup' from a reliable source which is also ideally justified from the grammar point of view.
