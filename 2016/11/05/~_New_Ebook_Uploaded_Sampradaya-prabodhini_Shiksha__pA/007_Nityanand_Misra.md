Wikiwand being an interface, the source for the Wikiwand article on कुमारिलभट्ट is the Sanskrit Wikipedia article on कुमारिलभट्ट

[https://sa.wikipedia.org/wiki/कुमारिलभट्टः](https://sa.wikipedia.org/wiki/कुमारिलभट्टः)

  

Which has this claim. The claim is uncited. Looking at the history of the article under

[https://sa.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=कुमारिलभट्टः&action=history](https://sa.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=कुमारिलभट्टः&action=history)  

  

One gets the first version of the article created by the user with the ID Srimanta Bhadra on November 3 2015 which has the claim:

[https://sa.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=कुमारिलभट्टः&oldid=322127](https://sa.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=कुमारिलभट्टः&oldid=322127)  

  

The user page for Srimanta Bhadra is here

[https://sa.wikipedia.org/wiki/सदस्यः:Srimanta_Bhadra](https://sa.wikipedia.org/wiki/सदस्यः:Srimanta_Bhadra)

Which lists an email ID which is same as the email ID used by BVP member Srimanta Bhadra. Unless this is a fake Wikipedia account, the claim has been published on the Wikipedia article by BVP member Srimanta Bhadra.

  

So now my question is to Srimanta Bhadra (copied): what is the source of the claim that ‘टुप्टीका’ is a short form for ‘अनुष्टुप्टीका’?

Panini's कृत्रिमसंज्ञाs are used in the context of grammar only, and not generally, for example in titles of commentaries. Shortening of a word with splitting of a conjunct syllable (अनुष्टु -> टु) sounds rather unusual. Therefore, the claim needs to be questioned. Unless traced to a reliable author or source, it needs to be taken with a grain of salt.
