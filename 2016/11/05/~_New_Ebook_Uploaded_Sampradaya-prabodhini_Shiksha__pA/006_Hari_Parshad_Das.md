No published source that i know of. I recalled from memory what i had read a few months ago. Link: [http://www.wikiwand.com/sa/कुमारिलभट्टः](http://www.wikiwand.com/sa/%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%9F%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9F%E0%A4%83)  
  

The article says: ग्रन्थस्यास्य अनुष्टुप्छन्दोवद् अतिसंक्षिप्ताक्षरतया तादृशार्थसूचकम् ‘अनुष्टुप्टीका’ इति नाम वदन्तो जना अनुष्टुप्टीकेति नाम्नोऽपि संक्षिप्ताक्षरतां सम्पादयितुमिव ‘टुप्टीका’ इति व्यवहर्तुं प्रारब्धवन्तः इति तत्त्वविदो वदन्ति।

When the aim is to create a term for lāghava and/or mukha-sukha, grammar rules may not come into the picture at all. Pāṇini himself has created कृत्रिमसंज्ञाs such as टि, घु etc. and no dhātus/sūtras can be used to derive these terms. Of course, someone may be stubborn and say 'सर्वं धातुमयं जगत्' and try to derive these using dhātus, but i am not sure if such a person will succeed if he/she employs the sūtras/vārtikas that are currently available with us.
