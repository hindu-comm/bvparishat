Is there a source that can be cited for this claim?

  

As explained in the Madhaviya Dhatuvritti (attached), the word अनुष्टुभ् (अनुष्टुप्) comes from the root ष्टुभु स्तम्भे (स्तोभते, स्तुब्ध). The prefix अनु causes the षत्व, which in turn causes the ष्टुत्व. If there is a shortening by dropping the prefix, the form would be स्तुभ् (स्तुप्) and not टुभ् (टुप्). Hence my question.
