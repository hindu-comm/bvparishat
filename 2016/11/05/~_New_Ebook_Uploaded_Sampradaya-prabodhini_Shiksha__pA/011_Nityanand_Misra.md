Here is what I wrote yesterday:

Quote

Panini's कृत्रिमसंज्ञाs are used in the context of grammar only.

Unquote

  

I was specifically talking about Panini's कृत्रिमसंज्ञाs, or कृत्रिमसंज्ञाs in Ashtadhyayi (टि, घ, घु, घि, भ) . You misinterpreted my statement to be an understanding about artificial terms in general. If you are interested in discussing artificial terms in general, I suggest you start a new thread about artificial terms across all domains. 

  

Coming back to this thread, your claim of टुप् being a shortening of अनुष्टुप् still needs a citation from a reliable source (an unsourced statement from a Wikipedia article is, I am afraid, hardly reliable).
