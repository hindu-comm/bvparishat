It seems that my question was not clear enough. I was specifically asking if a popularly accepted vaiyākaraṇa/mīmāṁsaka \*from the past\* (not a contemporary academician) has ever \*denied\* or \*questioned\* the practice of applying कृत्रिमसंज्ञाs to other domains of knowledge.  
  

The reason for asking this is to understand the logic behind denying these कृत्रिमसंज्ञाs to other domains of knowledge. The reference that you have cited speaks of an observation made by a contemporary academician and does not specify the reasoning behind it. Moreover, it is not even clear if this observation made by him is his own opinion or the opinion of a past authority.  
  
If at all कृत्रिमसंज्ञाs have to be denied to other domains of knowledge, there should be sound reasoning behind it given by some popularly accepted vaiyākaraṇa/mīmāṁsaka from the past in some traditional grantha, because as far as i know, artificial terms are found in other domains of knowledge.  
  
An example of this is the term 'nighaṇṭu'. At the commencement of the nirukta, Yāskācārya specifies two derivations of the term 'nighaṇṭu'. None of these derivations seem to explain the term according to the available grammar rules.
