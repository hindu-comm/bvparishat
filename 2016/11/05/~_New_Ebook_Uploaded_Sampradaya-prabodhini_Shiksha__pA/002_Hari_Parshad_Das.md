Respected Prof. Deshpande,  
  

my pranams.  
  

Whenever a ṭīkā is written in a terse style, it can be named ṭup-ṭīkā. The original ṭup-ṭīkā earned its name due to being written in a terse style, which reminded everyone of the anuṣ**ṭup** — one of the short meters of Sanskrit prosody.  
  

ṭup is further trimming of anuṣṭup done by vidvānas for mukha-sukha. This is what i know.  
  

Another meaning of ṭup-ṭīkā is ṭupaḥ ṭīkā (a commentary written for anuṣṭup verses). This meaning can be applicable to any commentary in which the original verses of the book are written in anuṣṭup meter.  

  

sādhu-caraṇa-rajo 'bhilāṣī,  
  

hari parshad das.
