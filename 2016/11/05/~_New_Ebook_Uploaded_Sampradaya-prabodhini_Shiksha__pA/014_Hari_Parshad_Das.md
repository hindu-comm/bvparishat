Okay let me clarify it to you again. In your initial email, you said:  
  

> Panini's कृत्रिमसंज्ञाs are used in the context of grammar only, and > not generally, for example in **titles of commentaries**.  

  

Which commentary-title were you referring to? Of course, it was in reference to the title 'ṭup' given to the commentary written by Kumarila Bhatta. 'Ṭup' is not Pāṇini's कृत्रिमसंज्ञा. You extended the domain beyond Pāṇini. Therefore I asked you the source of the understanding that artificial terms are applicable only in the field of grammar. The question is still open for you.

While saying all this, i hope you do understand that:  
  

— this was an announcement message not meant for excessive digressions  

  
— Prof. Deshpande did not specifically ask me for a corroborated source. His question was about the meaning of the term 'ṭup' and my suggested answer was acknowledged by him.  
  
What i accept as credible or not credible, please leave it to me.

Maybe next time, you can check if the message sent by me is intended to be an announcement message or a discussion thread and then decide on whether you want to tangentially go off on a critiquing streak. By the way i really appreciate critics who have no solutions to offer.
