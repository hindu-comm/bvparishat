Dear Nityanand-ji,

  

  I have the Chowkhamba (Benares Sanskrit Series) edition of Kumārila's Ṭup-Ṭīkā, but this edition does not contain any commentary on this work. You have mentioned that there are several commentaries on Kumārila's Ṭup-Ṭīkā. Have any of these been published, and available as pdfs? Best,
