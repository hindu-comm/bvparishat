One should be enough. Here is Hideyo Ogawa (2005), ‘Process and Language: A Study of the Mahābhāṣya Ad A1.3.1 Bhūvādayo Dhātavaḥ’, Motilal Banarsidass, ISBN 9788120829510, p.14 (boldface red highlighting mine):

  

Quote

In his grammar Pāṇini makes statements using two sorts of terms: *akṛtrima* terms, namely those whose meanings are well known from common usage (e.g., *paśu* ‘animal’ in A1.2.73), and, *kṛtrima* terms, or artificial terms such as *bha* in A1.4.18. **Unlike artificial terms such as *bha*, which are used only in grammar,** the term *kriyā* is certainly used both in everyday speech and in grammar, but in grammar it is used in a technical sense, even different from the sense in which it is used in other schools of thought, though what is meant by the term *kriyā* is nothing more than the meaning abstracted from a sentential meaning, regardless of in what value the term is used.

PS: The book has a foreword by none other than George Cardona.
