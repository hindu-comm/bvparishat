IIRC, you brought up Panini's कृत्रिमसंज्ञाs while discussing the title of the commentary, not me. When I wrote: “Panini's कृत्रिमसंज्ञाs are used in the context of grammar only, and not generally, for example in titles of commentaries,” I was *restricting* the scope of Panini's कृत्रिमसंज्ञाs to grammar (and not *extending* them beyond grammar), thereby implying that the example of Panini's कृत्रिमसंज्ञाs is not very relevant in this context.Even if you took my statement as extending the scope beyond grammar (which I was not), I never talked about artificial terms in general. Artificial terms across all fields is not something I specialize in and was not something I was talking about, hence I fail to understand why I am expected to respond to a question on artificial terms in general.

Yes, I do understand. Still (and I am hopeful you will agree with this), there is no harm in questioning the source of a claim. In fact, everybody on the list only stands to gain if the source of a claim is discovered and critiqued. IMHO, questions and discussions on sources should be welcome.

On a lighter note, too bad I offered a \[conjectured\] solution on ‘ṭup’ and will miss out on your valued appreciation.
