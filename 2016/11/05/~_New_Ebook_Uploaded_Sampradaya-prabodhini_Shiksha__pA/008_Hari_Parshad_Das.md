Interesting. What is the source of the understanding that कृत्रिमसंज्ञाs are applicable only to the field of grammar? Has the practice of applying them to other domains of knowledge been denied or questioned by some prominent vyākaraṇa/mīmāṁsā authority in the past? If yes, please cite some references.
