Namaste,

  
  
\<An example of this is the term 'nighaṇṭu'. At the commencement of the nirukta, Yāskācārya specifies two derivations of the term 'nighaṇṭu'. None of these derivations seem to explain the term according to the available grammar rules>  
  

As my interest is in ancient history, may I suggest that Yaska was before Panini. Please correct me if I am wrong.  
  

Regards,  

skb
