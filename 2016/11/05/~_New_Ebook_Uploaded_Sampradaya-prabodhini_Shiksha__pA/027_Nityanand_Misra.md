Dear Prof. Deshpande Ji

  

Not that it matters a lot, but the suggestion linking the word *ṭup*with the well-established word*āṭopa*was made by me in [this](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/pAHtFHAMMpM/QQe3IB2SCAAJ) message on November 7. It seems Prof. Vasant Kumar Bhatt Ji replied to my message today, but his reply on top of the message was empty, which probably gives the impression that the suggestion in the body of the message was from him.

  

Anyhow, there is an eerie resemblance between the words*ṭup*and
*āṭopa* which cannot be ignored. That the analogical formation made sense to you makes my belief in the conjecture stronger.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
