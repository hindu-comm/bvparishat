Dear Vasantkumar Bhatt-ji,

  

  Thanks for this suggestion. This derivation for Ṭup related to the word Āṭopa looks more viable to me, as compared to the derivation from Anuṣṭup. Neither the Śābara Bhāṣya nor the Ṭup-Ṭīkā of Kumārila are in Anuṣṭup verses, and hence a connection to the word Anuṣṭup seems rather farfetched to me, though it has been proposed in the introduction to the edition of the Ṭupṭīkā. Whether the root ṭup is or is not listed in the Dhātupāṭha is a separate matter, but the word Āṭopa is well-established in Sanskrit usage, and Ṭup as an analogical formation does make sense to me. After all, if we take guidance from Bhartṛhari, theoretical constructs like "roots" are abstractions based on actual usage of words. Historically, it is not the case that "roots" existed in isolation prior to the usage of "derived" words. With best wishes,
