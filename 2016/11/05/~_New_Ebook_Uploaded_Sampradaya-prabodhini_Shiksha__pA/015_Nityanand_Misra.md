My guess is that the word टुप् is related to the word आटोप. Both words may well have a common origin, as a simple गुण transformation of टुप् will result in टोप्. It would be useful to see how the word आटोप is derived in various sources. The शब्दकल्पद्रुमः indeed derives the word आटोपः as आङ् + टुप् + घञ्, acknowledging the root टुप्. While टुप् is not listed as a root in the version of [digital version](http://sanskritlibrary.org/Sanskrit/Vyakarana/Dhatupatha/mdhvindx/disp/mdhv_index.html) of माधवीयाधातुवृत्ति’s अनुक्रमणी, one can see if such a root is listed in other Dhatu sources or Dhatu commentaries, where many variant roots are listed as इत्येके. Assuming the root टुप् exists, the word टुप् can be easily formed as a क्विबन्त form of the root.

  

As for the meaning, the meanings of आटोप may give a clue. One of the meanings of आटोप listed in शब्दकल्पद्रुमः is संभ्रम or ‘haste’ (other meanings being गर्व and संरम्भ). If this meaning is traced to the root टुप्, then the क्विबन्त word टुप् can stand for ‘haste’ (भावे क्विप्) or ‘hasteful/quick’ (कर्तरि क्विप्), and टुप्टीका could mean ‘a commentary authored in haste’ or a ‘quick commentary’. The other meanings of आटोप may be considered.
