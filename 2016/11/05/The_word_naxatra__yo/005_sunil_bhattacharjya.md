Namaste Sastryji,  
  

The stars, with specified positions in the zodiac are the nakshatras and in the earliest days of Indian astrnomy, their individual positions were marked with respect to one of the nakshatras nearest to the zodiac, and they were also called "yoga-tArA''. After the falling (or disappearance) of the  Abhijit nakshatra, there came to be 27 nakshatras, and the 360 degree-zodiac was equally divided among the 27 nakshatras, such that each nakshatra has the span of 13 degrees and 20 minutes.  
  

With the above history, could the term nakshatra have been associated with Sanskrit-equivalent of position or area or region in the sky? If that is so,this leads to another question as to whether the word Kshetra may also be a contender. Is there any chance the word nakshatra came from region (क्षेत्र) in the sky (नभ) ?  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
