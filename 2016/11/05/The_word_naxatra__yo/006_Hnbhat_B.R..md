Yes. In the above, it is from na kṣatra not perishable, kṣatra derived root √kṣara.

If the whole word is derived from two different roots, √णक्ष and √त्राा, it can be a compound of 2 words नक्ष+त्र.

It can be compound with 3 words, न+क्ष+त्र derived from roots क्षि and त्रा. क्षीयते, क्षरति वा क्षः = नाशः, न क्षो भवति -- नक्षः। नक्षं त्रायते --- नक्षत्रम्।

It is not clear from which point of view you have asked the question.

For lexical purpose, in either case, it is synonym with other words used for star नक्षत्रमृक्षं भं तारा तारका उडु listed in अमरकोश १.३.२१.
