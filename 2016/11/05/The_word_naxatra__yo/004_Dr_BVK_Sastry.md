Namaste



1. The Samskruth word can not be associated with a meaning devoid of a ‘ context and usage’. This is the technicality of ‘ Pari-Bhashaa’ and ‘Nirukta’ linguistics, aka Vedanga paddhati for understanding Samskruth words. Theis ‘Vednaga – Paddhati’ is built around the technicality of understanding Samskruth word in the yoga way. This traditional Paninian technicality is blatantly violated by many modern Sanskrit students, translators and researchers who prefer to rate the authority of Max Muller, Roth and Monier Williams over the traditional guidance.

2. Coming to the specific word ‘ Nakshatra’, in the mail, let us start with the basic question : What would be the guiding rule to mark the word-boundary ? Why one way of split should be advantageous over another model of split ? Why would Paninian grammar support multiple modes of ‘ Word split’ as equally valid constructions ?



2a) **What would be the guiding rule to mark the word-boundary ?** – The usage. If you are referring to the usage of this word in the context of a vedic passage : ‘ Nakshatram Devam Indriyam’ - the word ‘Nakshatra’, a full word, will not mean the Astronomical ‘Star in the sky’; and by extension, the modern astronomers classification of ‘ Sun in the Solar system as a ‘Star amongst the millions burning down to become a black mass’. The technical meaning of the word ‘ Nakshatra’ would further depend upon the technicality of the associated words –Devam – Indriyam, the way the two/three words are construed as a ‘compound or other wise’.




If the context is drawn from ‘Vedanga Jyotisha’ then the word ‘ Nakshatra’ would be limited to the listed twenty seven/ Twenty eight ; where each ‘Nakshatra ‘ would come with a specific ‘ descriptor, divinity and associated features’. In this sense, the Vedanga Jyotisha context of Nakshatra will not be ‘ astronomical star’.



If the context is literature, then word ‘Nakshtra’ would be a ‘bright, shining like diamond in the starry sky, up above heaven’ - non descript entity .



If the word is to be split as ‘ na- Kshatra’, then one needs the context and a quote for the rule by which the compound is formed or denied. With the possibility of a compound ( = samaasa), the word that may need explanation is ‘ a-kshatram ( similar to a-bhava, a-brahmanam, a-sura). In this context, the word –split is not related to ‘astronomy’.



2b) **Why one way of split should be advantageous over another model of split ? –** This is where the technicality of ‘Paribhashaa’ needs to be understood. The same word can yield a number of meanings by different constructions’. This is the strength and complexity of Samskrutham, exploited in polemics and prejudicial presentation of Samskruth documents. Some of the classic examples are : differing explanations of the Vedic chants titled ‘Bhagya sukta’ ( and the word ‘Bhaga’ used in it), the word ‘Ashva’ ( Horse or impermanence).



2c) **Why would Paninian grammar support multiple modes of ‘ Word split’ as equally valid constructions** ? Because Paninian grammar covers the two layers of Samskrutham : Chandas and Bhasha :: Visioning of Language and Truthful total Articulation of Intention :: Satya-Darshana and Satya –aakhyana.
