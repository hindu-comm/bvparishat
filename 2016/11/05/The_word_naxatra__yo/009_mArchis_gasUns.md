Thanks for the hints, now I openedWackernagel's index and here we go. Do I understand it right:  

1) There is Wackernagel, who knows the prehistory of Sanskrit and Old Iranian and reconstructs*nakt-kṣatra,nakkṣatra.* Backed up byU.naadisuutra 3.105 (so Paninian)

2\) Panini himself is forन-क्षत्र as per ६.३.७५ in अष्टाध्यायी and it is in accordance withTaittiriya Brahmana 2.7.18.3; ShatpathaBrahmana 2.1.2.18-19; GopathaBrahmana 2.1.8

3) Theoretically it could have been evencompound with 3 words, न+क्ष+त्र derived, but probably is not.

So there is the history of languages point of view, there is strictly synchronic view and mathematically possible point of view - all 3 are possible.
