If by the 'Lakṣālaṅkāra',the full commentary on the Epic itself is meant(and not just a commentary on the Mahābhāratatātparyanirṇaya),yes,I am meaning that work in particular. So,yes,I *am* referring to that work in particular.  
  

Also,regarding the other works, they (Vishva Madhwa Maha Parishat) have no online address?
