Dear listfolk,  
  
Does anyone have any idea where I can obtain a copy of Śrī Vādirāja Tīrtha's commentary on the Mahābhārata,the Mahābhārata-Prasthāna?Dr. BNK Sharma mentioned this work in his *History of the Dvaita School of Vedanta and its Literature* and mentioned that a complete edition of this commentary was published by the Vādirāja Grantha Prakāśana Samiti,Udipi (in his time).  
  
Thanking in advance,  
  
Sreekar.
