Dear Dipak Bhattacharya

  

Angirasa Kalpa is apparently very controversial. When you finish your book, would you let me know, I would love to buy it. Narasimha, Asuri Durga and Asuri plant - would you have any idea of Asuri plant is. I know Dmitri wrote a paper on Auras - and from the explanations offered, asura is a negative vibration (or frequency). How does Asuri plant fit into this? Would love to read if someone can enlighten.
