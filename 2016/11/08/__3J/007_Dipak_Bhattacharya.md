Dear Mr. Dev

I will not give you any false hope. Since I wrote I became occupied with an AVP hymn which has some wrong readings.

I got a copy of the Angirasakalpa from Durgamohan Bhattacharyya’s collection and collected another on my own.

The two manuscripts do not agree. I vaguely remember to have stated this elsewhere too. The Angirasakalpa should not remain controversial if we accept that it is a class of treatise that gathered Angirasa material over the centuries. . 

I do not know when I can do something with them.

Best

Dipak Bhattacharya
