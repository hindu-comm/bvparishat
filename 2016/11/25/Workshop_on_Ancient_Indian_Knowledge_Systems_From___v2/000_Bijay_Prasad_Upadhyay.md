***Introduction***

 The quest for knowledge started since the dawn of human civilisation. Human societies explored the universe and documented the truth adhered to their philosophy of life. Gradually this evolved into their systems of knowledge and the civilisations flourished on the basis of these systems. India's Indus Valley Civilisation is also one of these. A recent study by IIT Kharagpur dates back Indus Valley as one of the oldest civilisation of the world. Since time immemorial, it has developed & reached the pinnacle of growth. The credit goes to her knowledge systems which were acquired and passed on over a period time.

 This is why India was called as *Bhāratavarsha*. The word *Bhārata* breaks into '*Bhā*' meaning knowledge and '*rat*' meaning involved. Our ancestors were engaged in the processing of knowledge. It was also manifested by the famous centres of learning of that time known as *Gurukula* which attracted many students from all over the world. The *Gurukulas* of Taxila, Nalanda, Ujjain, Mysuru etc. were few of them.

***Ancient Indian Knowledge Systems***

 ‘*Vedas*’ are the root source in our Ancient Indian Knowledge Systems. The four *Veda* contain all types of knowledge which exist as fundamental principles in the form of seed and is represented by the Vedic hymns. To study and understand the *Vedas*, six ‘*Vedāngas*’ (viz. *Shikshā, Vyākaran, Nirukta, Chhanda, Kalpa & Jyotisha*) were prepared by seers. For examining and carrying out experiments of the fundamental principles present in the *Vedas*, sages devised research methodology in the form of six *Upāngas* or *Darshans* (viz. *Mimānsā, Vaisheshika, Nyāya, Yoga, Sānkhya & Vedānta*). Vedas were acquired from the God and the knowledge contained in it is for the welfare of the humankind. Our *Ācharyas* achieved this by creating four *Upavedas* (viz. *Āyurveda, Dhanurveda, Gāndharvaveda & Shilpaveda*). In a nutshell, Ancient Indian Knowledge Systems comprised of four *Vedas*, six *Vedāngas*, six *Upāngas* or *Darshans* and four *Upavedas*.
