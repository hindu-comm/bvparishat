Yes, exactly. So what I downloaded on SCRIBD is not what I was looking for, but still.

Being outside of India it's an issue always, so I do try to look for scans first, if possible ask my colleagues from India, because with a 20 000 rupee salary at a university you do

not buy books for 5500 rupees. Russian science is even in a worse position than in India, so we have to do, what we can. I have scanned hundreds of books related to Sanskrit

myself, so I do not think it's problematic. What ifVishveshvaranand Institute Publications (no Institute in India has ever answered any of my emails) would agree that a scan is

made?
