Are you talking about Steins edition or Rajatarangini Kalhana edited Ram Swami Shastri & Baskaran Nair S. Part 1-4 published Vishveshvaranand Institute Publications? Your link to exotica pointed to the editions published by Vishveshvaranand Institute Publications. I personally donot charge for scanning and I don’t scan books available in print. Please write to Vishveshvaranand Institute Publications or one may directly buy from Exotica website. Scannin is for preservation not books available in print easily. Thanks

Regards

Ajit Gargeshwari
