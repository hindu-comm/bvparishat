Dear friends,  
  

The book of Troyer and another Dutt are the best so far as Kashmir in ancient times is concerned. Troyer's book is in French and Dutt's is in English. Kern was sent to destroy the ancient chronology, in the garb of doing research on Rajatarangini and he did as the colonial authorities wanted him to do.. He completely misinterpreted the ancient time-line, Pandit also did not do any justice to Rajatarangini. So be careful to look at the book before going in for purchase of the new book, at least for the part dealing with the ancient history of Kashmir.  
  

Regards,
