Yes, exactly. So what I downloaded on SCRIBD is not what I was looking for, but still.

***\[Ajit Gargeshwari\] ***Steins edition is on scribed and also at [archive.org](http://archive.org)

Being outside of India it's an issue always, so I do try to look for scans first, if possible ask my colleagues from India, because with a 20 000 rupee salary at a university you do

not buy books for 5500 rupees. Russian science is even in a worse position than in India, so we have to do, what we can. I have scanned hundreds of books related to Sanskrit

myself, so I do not think it's problematic. What ifVishveshvaranand Institute Publications (no Institute in India has ever answered any of my emails) would agree that a scan is

made?

***\[Ajit Gargeshwari\] ***Being outside India or in India and price of a book are no justification to scan or distribute books that are in print. I think Russia is also a signatory to Berne convention not sure. If one cannot afford to buy one has to read them in libraries that what the law says. Fair usage is an exception. Libraries may scan their
books and keep them on their secure servers and make them accessible to their patrons, that’s a different matter.

***\[Ajit Gargeshwari\] It best to keep information on what one has scanned private and off list this is my opinion. You may disagree do not like publicity on these. I hope I am exempted from this conversation as I have indicated earlier. I hope you see my point.***
