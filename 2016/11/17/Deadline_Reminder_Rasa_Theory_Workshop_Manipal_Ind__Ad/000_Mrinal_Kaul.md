Dear Colleagues,

  

This is a gentle reminder about the 'Rasa Theory Workshop' we are organising in February 2017. The deadline for applications is 30 November 2016. Please find more details about the workshop and the application process on the below mentioned link:

  

<https://kashuradab.wordpress.com/workshop-on-the-rasa-theory/>  

  

I would be very happy if you can spread the word and forward the information to the potential graduate students and researchers in the field of Indology, South Asian Studies, Indian Philosophy, Aesthetics, and Saiva Philosophy. Our approach would be strongly philological and we do hope that the workshop would offer an excellent learning opportunity for all the participants at an international platform.

  

Hoping to see many of you here in Manipal.

  

Best wishes.

  

Mrinal Kaul
