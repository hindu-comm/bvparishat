May Speech for ever be in the lotus of my face.  

She has placed a book in her hand.  

She is with a charming lute.  

She has eyes that surpass those of the deer.  

She envelops the sentient as well as the insentient.  

She mounts \[the swan,\] a bird.  

She is well-versed in all lores.  

She resides in my heart.  
  

Hope this suffices.
