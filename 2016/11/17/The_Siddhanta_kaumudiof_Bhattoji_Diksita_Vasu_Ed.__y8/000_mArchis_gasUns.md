Namaste,

  

 I'm looking for The Siddhanta kaumudīof Bhaṭṭoji Dikṣita by Srisa Chandra Vasu, it's 4 volumes (or 4 books, do not remember), guess there is only one Vasu that has worked on Siddhanta
<https://www.worldcat.org/title/siddhanta-kaumudi-of-bhattoji-diksita/oclc/904542994/editions?referer=di&editionsView=true> Is there a scan, wise men, please advice? I want to buy the book, but first need to know what editions are there and if the link I gave is the one? I've heard that in some reprints one volume is left out.

  

Thanks,

M.G.
