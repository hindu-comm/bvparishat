Namaste,

  

There is a frequently quoted sanskrit quote w.r.t to the life of prodigy as:

  

अतिमेधावी पुमान् अल्पायुरनपत्यो दरिद्रः पतितो वा भवेत् ॥  

  

The meaning runs as one who is exceptionally intelligent (ref. child prodigies), they are either :

  

short-lived / childless without progeny / steeped in poverty / fallen

  

Would appreciate the source of this statement.

  

regs,

sriram
