Friends,

Here is a piece I wrote about Rama Bharata meeting in Chitrakuta.

Valmiki's characterization of Bharata needs much more analysis

as a part of world literature. Mine is only cursory.

The English version is posted here:

The Hindi version is attached.

Best regards.

Happy Deepavali.

PS. We did the Valmiki Jayanti with a Sanskrit musical theater last Oct 15. The video

is being edited. I will report.
