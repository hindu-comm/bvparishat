Dear scholars,  
  
All the three varnas, the brahmins, the kshatriyas and the vaishya are entitled to the upanayana sanskara, but at different ages of the child. So also as part of that ceremony, there is the custom, where the vatu is given a danda and the danda heights are different for the different varnas. Is there any text (with commentaries if any) where all these specifications on the dandas are given.  
  

Regards,skb
