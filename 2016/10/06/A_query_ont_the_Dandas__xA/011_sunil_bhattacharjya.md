Dear Sathyanarayana Sarmaji,  
  

Thank you for the details you have sent.  
  
As regards the length of the danda for the three varnas, I came to understand that according to the Asvalayana grihyasutra. the danda of the brahmana boy should reach the hair on the boy's scalp, the danda of the kshatriya boy should reach the forehead and the danda of the Vaishya boy should reach the vel of the heart in the chest. Hope any member in the group, having this grihyasutra, may be able to let us have the relevant verses and any other related information.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
