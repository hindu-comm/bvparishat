Namaste



Apart from the technicality of the length and material of ‘Danda’ (= staff) which comes at best as a ‘ part of ritual (= upanayana Samskara), which in current period is discharged almost on same day (?!),

The pertinent question to pursue would be:



a) The difference of the staff –length at best would be a maximum of 6 inches to 8 inches in height. What would this difference be functionally needed for ?

b) What purpose does it serve ? – Identification , Mystic benefit ( apoorva) ?



Any helpful insights please. (And same thing holds for the ‘ ajina’
issue tied to the yajnopavita, as a part of ritual).



Regards

BVK Sastry
