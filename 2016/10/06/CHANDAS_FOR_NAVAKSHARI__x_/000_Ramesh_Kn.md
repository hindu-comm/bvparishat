What is the chandas for Navkshari mantra - aim hreem kleem camundayai vicce?

  

In Anna book of Ramakrishna math, it is written as jagatee chandas with markandeya rishi, in few books of Devi mahatmaya it is written as Brahma,vishnu,mahadeva rishaya:, gayatri,ushnik,anushtup chandaamsi and
gayatri,ushnik & trishtup in few tradtions...

  

Can a mantra have different chandas....?
