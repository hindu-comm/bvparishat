Dear Prof. Kannan,

  

The Science-Philosophy Dialogue with it's six great topics is a real test for the genius ! को अद्धा वेद क इह प्रवोचत्। But then Tarka is a seer and we have to humanly understand the cosmic entities and happenings.

  

Congratulation to all scholars that participate in the dialogue.

  

We may look forward to some *yajnashesha*in the form of a summary of the discussion and the conclusions arrived at.

  

Warm regards,

  

SMMishra
