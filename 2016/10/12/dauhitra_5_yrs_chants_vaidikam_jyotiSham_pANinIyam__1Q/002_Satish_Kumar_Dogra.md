Unfortunately we have given a go-by to the tradition of memorizing scriptures. From my interaction with people I find that the tradition of memorizing Sanskrit scriptures has a terrific positive impact on the mind of a person. We should try to revive this tradition. I am glad Shri Korada is carrying forward this tradition within his family. His own grip over the scriptures is amazing.  
  

We need to integrate the Indian tradition of rote-learning with the Western tradition of analytical logic. The two together are a tremendous combination. In the training sessions I conduct with managers as an HR Advisor for a Company, I am trying to experiment with this integration --- and with good results.
