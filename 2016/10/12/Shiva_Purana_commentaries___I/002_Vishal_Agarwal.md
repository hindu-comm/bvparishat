I have a scan of the following portions of that edition: Dharma Samhita, Sanatkumar Samhita and Jnana Samhita. There is a short/simple commentary appended to the verses. Note that these 3 Samhitas are not normally included in the printed editions of Shiva Purana. My scan is of the Devanagari edition that you mention. From DLI, you could find Bengali script versions of the entire text (but without the commentary) including these 3 Samhitas.

My scans are large files due to poor quality of the original. Please write to me at vishalsagarwal at yahoo dot com in case you want them.

In N America, the only copy available of this edition is at the U Chicago library where

Regards,

Vishal
