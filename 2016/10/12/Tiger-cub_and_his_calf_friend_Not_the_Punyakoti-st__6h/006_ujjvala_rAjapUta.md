A similar story (of **cow, calf, tigress and her cub**) from Thailand (link is [here](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=41h-1fNjTx8C&pg=PA103&lpg=PA103&dq=%22calf%22+tiger+cub%22&source=bl&ots=aWWG9Wc406&sig=2huh1KbydpJwzJj9RwasX09x0_Y&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj7s9ajntnPAhXEo48KHeuJBP4Q6AEIRzAK#v=onepage&q=%22calf%22%20tiger%20cub%22&f=false)) and Burma (link is [here](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=VILAPXjjbhQC&pg=PA95&dq=%22calf%22+tiger+cub%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj43evRntnPAhVEPY8KHaCQBGw4ChDoAQhDMAg#v=onepage&q=%22calf%22%20tiger%20cub%22&f=false)). Finding same story plot from North India, Karnataka, Thailand and Burma seems to suggest that there can be a common source, perhaps in Sanskrit or the older Prakrits. Please help me in finding more information.
