Namaste

  

As a matter of fact I suggest Punyakoti story should be changed. Instead of tiger capturing the cow we should have Yavanas and Mlecchascapturing the cow to eat her.Then cow promises to come back after feeding her calf. When cowcomes back keeping her promise she will see the Yavanas and Mlecchas are killed by the Tiger. The Tiger will let her go home. Cow and Tiger both are heroes of the story.

  

Children watching this will have good opinion of Cow and Tiger.
