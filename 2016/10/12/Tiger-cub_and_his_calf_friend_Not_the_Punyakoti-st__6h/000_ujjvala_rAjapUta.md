I had created a thread by a similar title (in Sanskrit). But that thread has become completely dedicated to the **Punyakoti** story. Its not the case that I don't like the Punyakoti story. In fact, I like it very much and have been following the development of the animated Sanskrit film for at-least two years. I have listened many times to the recorded songs about Punyakoti in Hindi and Kannada and like both of them very much. I had also liked the story in the Padma purana.  
  
But the matter of interest at hand is a different story about two friends, a tiger-cub and a calf, wherein the tiger-cub's mother preys upon the calf's mother. I first heard this story being played as a recorded song somewhere, in Hindi. On the internet, I have found, till now, two forms of the story. One in a book about folktales of Gondwana. [You can read it here](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Ay_urNjUs70C&pg=PA115&lpg=PA115&dq=%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AF+%E0%A4%94%E0%A4%B0+%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%80&source=bl&ots=mHvLC2H8KS&sig=12og0VKMAQQ-HMMnXs4LiTrsMhs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjm79HCj8jPAhWBv48KHeZZCKIQ6AEILDAG#v=onepage&q=%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AF%20%E0%A4%94%E0%A4%B0%20%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%80&f=false). The other is in a book about Kannada folktales (कन्नड लोक कथाएँ in Hindi) by Sahitya Akademi. [Link to the book's entry on Google](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=tJwyAAAAIAAJ&dq). I just wanted to know what other forms does this story exist in.
