Namaste

  

There is a small problem with the Punyakoti story in modern times. There is a big Save The Tiger campaign to save tigers from extinction. The population of tigers in the world has become very very small compared to earlier times.

  

Children seeing the Punyakoti play will think Tiger is a bad villain.

  

Therefore it is wrong to show the Tiger as a bad animal. When we see Durga Mata riding on tiger will we say She is riding on evil Tiger? No. Then why are we showing Tiger as bad?

  

Cow is a sacred animal. We must do Goraksha with all our strength. But at the same time it is wrong to think Tiger is a bad animal.

  

In Modern day many many morecows are killed by Man but not by Tiger.
