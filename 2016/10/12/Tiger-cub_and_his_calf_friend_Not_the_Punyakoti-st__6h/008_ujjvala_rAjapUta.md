Siddhi Kur, a retelling of Vetalapanchavinshatika in Mongolia contains a similar story (of **calf, cow, lioness, cub**). Read it[here](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=t0DYXre2XsgC&pg=PT166&lpg=PT166&dq=tale+of+the+cub+and+the+calf&source=bl&ots=lyrUP4UkTR&sig=C98BEUr1TF0K6MbZZalkqk55upw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiJ_P2Qz9nPAhWLNY8KHSmnAYoQ6AEIIzAC#v=onepage&q=tale%20of%20the%20cub%20and%20the%20calf&f=false). Can someone recall if this story is present in any recession of Vetalapanchavinshatika in Sanskrit?  
  
Also you can read the story told by a woman called Mariamma translated to English [here](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ik3zCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA169&lpg=PA169&dq=%22the+cub+and+the+calf%22&source=bl&ots=wl2vZlqQzW&sig=5EFjTj86gieBP-OROJM-etlfRys&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj94_v-ztnPAhUJPY8KHb6DCigQ6AEILTAE#v=onepage&q=%22the%20cub%20and%20the%20calf%22&f=false).
