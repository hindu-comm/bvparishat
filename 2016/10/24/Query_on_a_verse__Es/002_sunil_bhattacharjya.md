Buddha was Tathagata. Sugata was not Buddha. According to Dhammapada any monk can be called Sugata. . Even the Jainas have used the word Sugata for Mahavira. To my knowledge, Adi Shankara did not criticize Buddha, the 9th avatara of Lord Vishnu. He criticized the Buddhists like Dignaga and Dharmakirti, who deviated from the teachings of Lord Buddha.
