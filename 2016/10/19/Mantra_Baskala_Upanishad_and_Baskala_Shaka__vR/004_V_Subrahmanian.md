The search on this topic could throw light on a particular question which has bearing in the Shānkara Bhāṣya for the Brahma sutras 3.2.17.
He has cited a passage from a shruti:

  

बाष्कलिनाच बाध्वः पृष्टः सन् अवचनेनैव ब्रह्म प्रोवाचेति श्रूयते — ‘स होवाचाधीहि भो इति स तूष्णीं बभूव तं ह द्वितीये तृतीये वा वचन उवाच ब्रूमः खलु त्वं तु न विजानासि । उपशान्तोऽयमात्मा’ इति ।  

  

A search through some available resources has not yielded any definite clues to the identity of the Upanishad. The words/names 'Bāśkali' and 'Bādhva' are to be looked into while making the search.
