Dear Prof Kannan.  
  
The question was asked by Jaya Prakash Maiya ji. I think its the problem with the google mail interface. I request Jayapraksh ji to include his name while posting in future. If you know about "any existing manuscript or soft copy ofMantra Baskala Upanishad and Baskala Shaka of Rig Veda" please help.

Thanks
