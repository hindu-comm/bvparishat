Sir,

  

A friend shared with me a file titled 'aprakāśita-upaniṣadaḥ' published by the Adyar Library, 1933, containing several upaniṣads and two of which are the ones you have located. However, I found that those two texts do not contain the passages I had cited here from Shankara's Brahmasutra bhashya.

  

warm regards
