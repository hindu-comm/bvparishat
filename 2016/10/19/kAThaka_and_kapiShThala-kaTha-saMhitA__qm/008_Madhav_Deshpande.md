Dear Shri Subrahmanian,

  

  The first pdf that I sent has the complete text of the Schroeder's edition of the Kāṭhaka-Saṃhitā, but there the index is incomplete. In the second pdf (from Oxford's Bodleian Library), as you have discovered, the index is complete, but the text portion ends after 30 chapters. We need to combine the pages from these two pdfs to get the complete text of the Saṃhitā and the Index. Will do that if I get time to do it.
