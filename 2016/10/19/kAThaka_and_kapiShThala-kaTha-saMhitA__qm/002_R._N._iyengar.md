Many thanks **Prof.Deshpande** for the web link. I did not have the the edition of Schroeder, with word index. The edition of Raghuvira you have provided is perhaps the first edition. The one I am having has the foot note in single column, whereas in your version it is in two columns.

In the German edition you have provided, the index stops abruptly on p 209 with

Could you kindly check the text. Meanwhile I will also be searching for other links.  

  

My interest in the tradition of the Kat.has is because it is in the Kat.ha Braahman.a (fragments published by Suryakanta, Lahore) for the first time in Vedic literature, planet names appear as we know them now. Interestingly the Grahes.t.i (text with accents) of the above Kat.ha tradition refers Mars as Bhauma and Saturn as Saura. Since some relation is expected between the Samhita and the Braahman.a traditions, I am searching for Vedic hints/legends (as different from Purana stories) for the planet names.  

best regards
