Thanks for providing the complete index edition. However, upon checking I found that while the index refers to many instances of chapters above 30, even 40, the mantra portion is not available beyond chapter XXX. This ends on p.504 of the pdf. And a completion declaration is also available on this page itself.After this the index commences.

  

It looks like a big chunk of the vedic text is missing. Someone may please check this and confirm if my assessment is correct.

  

warm regards
