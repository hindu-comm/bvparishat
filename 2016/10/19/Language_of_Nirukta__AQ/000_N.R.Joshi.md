Respected scholars, Namaskar !



I am reading the book, " Language of Nirukta" by Mantrini Prasad (Ph. D. under Prof M.A. Mehendale of Deccan college Pune).

As I am reading the book,it is difficult to imagine how many changes have taken place in meanings of roots from the time of Rigveda to the time of Yaaska (700 BC). Manyroots from Sanhitas, BrahmaNaswent out of use by the time of Yaaska.



There is truth in "Information which is certain in the beginning tends to become uncertain with the passage of time."



Kaalaaya tasmai namah !



N. R.Joshi
