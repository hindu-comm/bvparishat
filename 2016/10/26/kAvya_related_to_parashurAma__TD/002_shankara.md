Namaste,

  

Giving below details of some Sanskrit works on Parasurama.  

  

1. Parasurama Charitam Gadyakavyam - Devarakonda Venkateswara Sastri 1934  
available at <http://www.dli.ernet.in/handle/2015/369141>  
2. Samasta Parasu Ramayanam Kavyam - Viharilal Vasishtha 1999, published from Jammu  

  

Prof SS janaki in an article on Parasurama published in Purana Journal in 1966 (attached to the mail), mentions that Kerala Mahatmya (also known as Agastya Samhita) and Sahyadri Khanda of Skanda Purana contain legends related to Parasurama.  



regards  
shankara
