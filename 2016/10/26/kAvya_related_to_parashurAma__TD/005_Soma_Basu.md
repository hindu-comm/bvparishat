Respected Prof. Mishra,  
  

Pranam!  

Can you remember me?  
  

I happened to be one of the resource persons of the Advance Level National Workshop on ‘Manuscriptology & Paleography’ organized by the
Manuscripts Resource Centre, Kurukshetra University, Kurukshetra from 15 to19 April 2011.  
I would like to request you to kindly mail me the PARTICIPATION CERTIFICATE which I did not get that time but now for CASS it is necessary. Other resource person was Prof. Nabanarayan Bandyopadhyay.  
  
I shall be obliged if you mail the same.  
I wait for your reply mail.  
Thank you and best regards,  
  

Dr Soma Basu
