Vidvan Nagaraj garu,

  

I tried downloading & opening the attachment. There is no content in the attachment & it is simply leading to a third website [driv78.com](http://driv78.com) (which Google warns could be a malicious site). Looks like this is one of those attachments with virus. Today I received such mails from a couple of others too!

  

Suggest Suresh garu to check if his mail ID is compromised. Suggest the group admin to check & delete the mail thread.

  

Dhanyo'smi

Raghava
