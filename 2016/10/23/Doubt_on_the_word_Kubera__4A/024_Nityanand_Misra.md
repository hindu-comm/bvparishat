The belief that a bad name given to a boy makes him live long and wards off the evil eye is also to be found in rural areas of eastern Uttar Pradesh. Padma Bhushan Pandit Chhannulal Mishra, arguably one of the best living Hindustani classical vocalists, was born in a poor Kanyakubja Brahmin family in the village Hariharpur (Azamgarh district). His mother named him Chhannu (छन्नू). While his formal name is Mohanlal (मोहनलाल), it is not known to many. Pandit Ji chose to be known by the name his mother gave him.

  

Pandit Ji's delightful interview, in which he talks about his name and gives a humorous positive twist to it, on Shaksiyat programme on Rajya Sabha TV earlier this year can be watched here:
