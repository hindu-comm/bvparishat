In the Kannada region too this practice is found widely spread. For example, the equivalent of 'stone' is 'guṇḍu'. Hence gunḍappa, gunḍaṇṇa, gunḍu rao, etc. are common. Kallappa is also another synonym. Thippe or Thippaiah is to mean 'just a garbage.' Such names are given to children who are born after a long penance of the parents.
