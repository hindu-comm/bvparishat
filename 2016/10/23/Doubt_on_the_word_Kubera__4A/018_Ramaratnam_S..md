I do not know whether somebody has already made an observation on the tradition in Tamil Nadu. In a similar situation as pointed out by Prof Ashok Aklujkar, (Dhondo), we have names such as Kuppusamy (kuppai = garbage) and Pichchai (begging). Vataavyadhi reminds me of a name in the Tamil literary world. The original name of the poet is forgotten. Whenever he committed a mistake he used to prick his head with the sharp end of the writing stylus with the result that there was always pus oozing out from the wounds. He came to be called as Seezhthalai sattanar ( seezh = pus;; thalai = head).
