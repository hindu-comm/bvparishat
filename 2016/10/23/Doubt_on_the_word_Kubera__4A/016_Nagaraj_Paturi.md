Prof. Aklujkar,

  

The custom you mentioned is prevalent here in the Telugu speaking states too.

  

These are some of theadditional details : The continuous baby deaths for certain parents is considered to be 'evil eye' effect. And unattractive naming is considered to be 'evil eye removing method'.

  

Such deaths are considered to be part of the 'fate' of the parents not to have their own children surviving. In such cases, the child is disowned for a few minutes and is taken back to be brought up by the same parents as foster parents and not as natural parents. In some cases, within this tradition, the child is symbolically 'given' to thegarbage bin and 'taken back' from it and the names in such cases have the meaning garbage or garbage bin etc.
