Prof S. Korada, Saadara PraNaam



How will you explain "Nalakubera" the son of Kubera? Both were kings of Yakshas and Yakshas were described in the ancient books as models of beauty. Wife of Nalakubera was beautiful Rambhaa.

Kubera was half brother of RaavaNa the king of Raakshas. The behavior of RaavaNa with his daughter-in law Rambhaa cannot be described here. Bea use this incident, RaavaNa received curse from Kubera. Thanks. N. R. Joshi.
