At least in Maharashtra villages a custom existed of giving a newly born an unattractive name if the new-born's mother had a history of prematurely dying children (e.g., Dhondo ’stone’ Keshav Karve, one of the great social reformers of modern India, who lived to be 104 years old; Dagaḍū ‘stone, rock’ Sheth Halwai/Halawai, whose name has a place of honour in central Pune City and the annual Ganesh Festival). ‘Death will not be attracted to the child if the child has a repulsive name’ was the explanation of the custom — at least the explanation I have heard.

  

Is a similar custom noticed elsewhere? I would like to find out how widespread the custom is. (My intention is not to assert thatVātavyādhi andKauṇapadanta owe their origin to the same custom.) So, please let the list know, with a specification of your part of the world, any similar names that you might have come across.

  

Prof. Kannan’s renderings of the two epithets, while not literal, will work very well for the English-speaking world.
