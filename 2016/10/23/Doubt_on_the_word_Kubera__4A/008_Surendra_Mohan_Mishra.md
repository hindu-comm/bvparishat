1.  **Monier Williams tells that 'kuvera' is a word in later Sanskrit in
    place of 'kubera'. I have one humble query: Swami Dayananda derives
    the word 'kuvera' from the root 'kuvi' in the sense of covering,
    wherefrom he derives the word 'kuvera' and the root from which
    *DhaatupaaTha* ? Purushottama, in his Dviruupakosha seems to have
    missed on recording this 'kubera-kuvera' synonymous duo.*Regards,
    SMMishra***
