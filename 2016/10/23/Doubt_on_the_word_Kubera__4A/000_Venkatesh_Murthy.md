कुवि आच्छादनेऽस्मद्धातोः कुवेरशब्दः सिद्ध्यति । यः सर्वं कुवति स्वव्याप्त्याच्छादयति स कुवेरो जगदीश्वरः । (Satyartha Prakash)

  

How did Kubera become धनपति and निधिपति? This does not match above description. Is there any text for explaining Kubera's Mahima? Nowadays we treat him like Treasurer for Maha Lakshmi. In some places he is elder brother of Ravana. He is also Yaksharaja. But in Diwali we have to pay respects to him with Maha Lakshmi Puja.
