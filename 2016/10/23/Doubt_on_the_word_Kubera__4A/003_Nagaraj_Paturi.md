Vidwan Venkatesh Murtyji,

  

Let us not mix two different approaches. Satyartha Prakash proposes that all the Vedic words supposed to be the names of different Vaidika Devatas are all adjectives of the one and the only one Iswara or Bhagavaan.

  

Different Puranic stories mentioned by you are nt recognized as valid in that method.

  

The concept described in themantra :ऊँ ***राजाधिराजाय*** प्रसहृसाहिने नमो वयं वैश्रवणाय कूर्महे । स मे कामान्कामाय महृं कामेश्वरो वैश्रवणो दधातु । कुबेराय वैश्रवणाय.....

  

is Vedic and is different from the mentioned in the Puranic stories brought in by you.

  

In the Puranic narratives there are those which 'explain' why Kubera got an ugly body. It is 'explained ' as a curse from Maa Parvati.
