Regards to Sanskrit scholars,  
Since a long have question in mind to put up before this group - not to test ability of the learned all but to satisfy myself that shastric tradition has specific reason. My question is about dirham saptashati chandi paath, starting with kavach,argala,kilakam, theses 3 has vomiting for same purpose,have same metre,yet in Karachi it's जगदम्बा प्रीत्यर्थे, in argala it's जगदम्बा प्रीतये & in kilakam it's जगदम्बा प्रीत्यर्थं, I can't understand why the रुप-विभक्ति differs?
