Dear scholar friends,

  

I have now prepared the screenplay for three episodes from Ramayana

that I have chosen for a performance on October 15, which is celebrated

as Valmiki Jayanti. We composed the music for each character for

delivery and plan to produce the play as a folk assembly with chorus and

music. You may write privately to me in case you would be interested

in the selection of Valmiki stanzas.. Here is the performance announcement:

I do have a question. In popular literature, Valmiki is characterized as a

hunter, who got converted to be a righteous man. I would appreciate to know

if this legend is part of any scriptural assertion and the reference I can check. 

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
