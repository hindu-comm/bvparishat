I agree with Sunil Ji regarding the curse of Vishnu Sahasra nama stotram. But my earlier mail about the curse of Vishnu is in response to the statement of Sri Venkata Sriram ji's mail:

"Who has the guts to gives curse to viSNu who commands the entire universe and with whose orders the sun rises ! (भीषोदेति सुर्यः)".

Pranams to all.
