There is a rudra shApa to viSNu sahasranAma. I have seen some chanting this. But it is not a prAmANika. Once I asked my AchArya about this.
He rejected this saying it is absurd !

  

Who has the guts to gives curse to viSNu who commands the entire universe and with whose orders the sun rises ! (भीषोदेति सुर्यः)

  

regs,

sriram
