Dear friends,  
  
If there is any shapa-vimochana mantra for Vishnu Sahasranama, that may not necessarily mean that there was a shapa on Lord Vishnu. There are also shapa-vimochana mantras for Gayatri and that may not mean the Gayatri has been cursed. Instead these may mean that Brahma and Vashishtha were unhappy in the wrong use of the powers of the Gayatri mantra by people. Even Vishwamitra tried once to misuse the powers of Gayatri mantra and it did not work out well and he could have cursed Gayatri. The reciting of the Shapa-vimochana mantra should remind one (the reciter of the Gayatri mantra) that the powers of the Gayatrimantra is not for wrong offensive use but only for lokasamgaha as well as for one's own welfare. It appears to me that if there is any shapa-vimochana mantra fot the Vishnu sahasranama, it could be that the powers of the Vishnu sahasranama is not to be invoked for causing any harm to others.  
  

Regards,
