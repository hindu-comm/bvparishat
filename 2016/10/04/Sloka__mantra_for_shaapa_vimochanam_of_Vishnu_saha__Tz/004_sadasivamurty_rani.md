As long as a being is "Saguna" (Even in case of being a God) that being is not exempted from being cursed.

There are several instances in the puranas where Vishnu received curses.

1. According to the account of the Hayagriva Incarnation of Lord Vishnu, due to the effect of the curse of Goddess Lakshmi, Vishnu was beheaded
and the horse head was fixed to him (This is according to Devi Bhagavatam)

  

2. According to the Skanda Purana He was cursed by Siva to be separated from his wife when He cut the body of Sati Devi into pieces with His Sudarsana Chakra while Siva was performing Tandava Dance in anger having laid down the corpse of Sati on his shoulders.

  

3. When Vishnu in the incarnation of Mohini and Siva were moving in the Darukavana the sage of that forest cursed both Siva and Kesava.

  

4. In the Skanda Purana there was an instance where Vishnu was cursed by Brnda (Tulasi) the wife of Jalandhara.

  

5. In the Brahma purana and other puranas Sarsvati/ (in some puranas) Savitri cursed Brahma, Vishnu, Siva and Gayatri to become Rivers. Accordingly Vishnu assumed the form of Krishna River, Siva - Veni River, Brahma - Kumudvati and Gayatri - Gayatri river.

  

In this manner there are several instances in the Puranas where Vishnu and Siva also were cursed.
