Hello All,

  

I do have some basic questions sorry for asking in the group. If any one knows please tell.

  

1\. Bhasma dharana (Tripundra) is coined by whom ? Since in Shankaracharya Dig Vijaya or any of his works there is no mention of Bhasma Dharana. Even in his disciple book non of them have coined.

2.UrdhvapuNDrais coined by whom? Since in Ramanujacharya works there is no mention of Urdhvapundra.

3.Gopichandana is coined by whom ? Since in Madvacharyaworks there is no mention of Gopichandana.

  

Is there any shastra base for all these ?

  

Thanks,
