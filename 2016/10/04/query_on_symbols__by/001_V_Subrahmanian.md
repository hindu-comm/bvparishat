There is a wok called 'स्मृतिमुक्ताफलम्’ also known as 'vaidyanātha dīkṣitīyam' which in a particular section deals with the above citing a number of references. The History of Dharma Shastra by K.V.Kane also has mentioned this.

  

Works like the Sūta samhitā have vidhi-s for bhasma dhāranam and the method. There is a 'bhasmajābālopaniṣad' which also gives details. You can get all these works for download.
