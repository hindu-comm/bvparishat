Dear Dr.Ramakant Shuklaji,

Devavaniparishad is doing yeoman services to Sanskrit under your able guidance for the last 40 or more years. May it continue to render services to Devavani for many more years to come with greater vigour.

I take this opportunity to send you my humble contribution to Jagannatha Pandita's scholarship in the form of English translations of Gangalahari and Bhaminivilasa. Both works are not published in book form.

Warm regards,

GSS Murthy
