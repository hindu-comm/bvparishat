Hi  
I am making a website for Sanskrit. I would like to show all sentences on the website in Sanskrit only.  
I am not good in Sanskrit so, can some one help me in translating following sentences ? :  
Only sentences in italics appear on website. Other sentences are for explaining the context.  
  
1. *Sanskell : word cloud generator for sanskrit websites*  
2. *Job successfully received.. It will take some time to process it.*  
 Here job means that some work was assigned to the site.  
3. *Any sanskrit website name*  
4. *Change values to play with word cloud  
5. Word cloud :  
* Word cloud is an image which is made by collecting words of the website. (most used words appear in big font)  
*6. Some cool word-cloud for you:  
7. Failed to post job. Please try after some time.  
8. Still working on your job:  
9. You can view the word cloud at:  
10. Failed to get job status. Please try again.  
11. Failed to get data. Please try again.  
12. Make word cloud  
13. Be the first one to generate a word-cloud of sanskrit website.  
14. Could not parse.  
  
*I hope that i will be able to share with you the joy of creating this website soon.  
If there are any questions, please respond with them.  
  
Thanks
