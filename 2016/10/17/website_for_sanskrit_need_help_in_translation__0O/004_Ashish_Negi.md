Thank you vishwaso ji.. (hope i spelled your name correctly)  
I did not know that there is sanskrit-programmers group too :)  
  
This is very helpful.  
  
All the code is opensourced at <https://github.com/ashishnegi/sanskell>.  
Only work remaining is CSS ( for beautification of website )..  
If someone wants to contribute from sanskrit-programmers group, please get in touch here or on github issue pages.  
  
Word Cloud generator is a well studied problem. I have used simple algorithm of word counting.  
However, as sanskrit joins multiple words into one, i have not handled breaking down of words.  
\[ This can be something where others can contribute. \]  
  
Also, i have used Haskell programming language ; which like sanskrit is good but used less in real world. :(  
But it is very powerful. If someone is interested in Haskell in general, they can ping me too.  
  
Hopefully, i will share the work soon.  
Again, thanks for your contribution.
