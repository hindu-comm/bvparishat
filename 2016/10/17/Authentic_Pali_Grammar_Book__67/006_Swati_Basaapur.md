Respected scholars,

  

Thank you very much for your kind help. Your suggestions were very helpful. I further have few queries. Please advise.  
I am looking for a book called Rupasiddhi based on Kacchayana's grammar with translation in Hindi or English and similar books where I can get nominal forms of Pali. Also In Sanskrit we have Dhaaturatnakara. Do we have similar collection of Verb Conjugations for Pali?
