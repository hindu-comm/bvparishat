Dear friends,  
  

Adi Shankara was born in Kerala, According to several Shankara mathas Adi Shankara was born in the 6th century BCE, while the Shringeri math believes he was born in the 8th century CE. He went to places in India covering places like Badrinath in the Himalayas in the North, Dwarka in the west, Puri in the east. Kanchipuram in the south and many other places throughout India, during his short life of 32 years. He visited many of the places more than once. There is no mention of any other person having done so in the past, if we leave out the people of the more ancient history  
  

I have a query, a geographical one of the times of Adi Shankara, as to what are the roads he took for his great journeys. I am particularly interested in the road by which he traveled when he took Bharati.(or Vani), the wife of Mandana Mishra, from Mahishmati to Shringeri, where her journey ended.  
  

Thanking you in advance and with regards,  
  

Sunil KB
