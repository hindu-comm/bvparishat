The very lovely Kannada version can be heard here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOZNmoWirK4>  
  
It used to be taught to schoolchildren in elementary school. I heard it as a lullaby - it is one of those songs that stays with you.  
  
The Wikipedia entry lists its source as the eighteenth chapter of the sṛṣṭikāṇḍa of padmapurāṇa. If anyone has this extract, please post.
