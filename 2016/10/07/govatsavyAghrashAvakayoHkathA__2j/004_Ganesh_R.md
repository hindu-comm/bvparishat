Just as a piece of information, the Hindi film gOdhuuli is a screen adoption of the famous Kannada novel "tabbaliyu neenaade magane", authored by the eminent writer S.L. Bhairappa. This work frequently refers to the said story /song, which is too well known in Kannada. Vid. G. Ganapayya Holla has translated this novel into Sanskrit bearing the name "anaath0'si", published by the Samskritha bhaarati. The novel was made as a film in 1977, bearing the same name, by the renowned playwright and actor Girish karnad. Recently I heard that an animated version of the said song was brought out in Sanskrit. All the versions have verses from the original poem. Of course, the Sanskrit version has them in verses set to the original metre.

Regards

Ganesh
