Sammaanyaah!

  

I have come across a query about the details of ' Aparyavasaana-vr.tti ' - refer ed by Poorn.aVidyaMuni in his ' Pan\~caPrakriyaa-Vyaakhyaa ' on 'Pan\~caPrakriyaa-Teeka' of Aanandajn\~aana on 'Pan\~caPrakriyaa' by Sarvajn\~aatma Muni (a rare work of Sanks.epa-shaareera- ka-kaara). It was Edited by T. R. Chintamani and published in 1946 by Madras University, also was availed in the Bulletins of the Sanskrit Department No.1. It is available on Net..

My query is - What is the' Aparyavasaana-vr.tti ' discussed as " Aparyavasaana-vr.ttis tu gun.avr.ttau+antarbhavati .." ?? Is it related to " Shabdaartha-vr.tti-"s of SaahityaShaastra ? or is it related to NyaayaDarshana ?? What is the nature and content of this' Aparyavasaana-vr.tti ' ??

  

May I request the great scholars related to [Bh.Vid.Paris.ad](http://Bh.Vid.Paris.ad) (BVP) to quench my thirst for knowing this??

  

with regards to all, Urmila Sharma
