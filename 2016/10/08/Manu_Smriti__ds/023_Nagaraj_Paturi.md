That said about the non-influential nature of the book which got popularized with the name Manu-smriti, let us see the attitude towards man-woman relation in the presently widely used version of the text:

  

the section on man-woman relation of which 9.3 is a part, is concluded with the following two verses:

  

तथा नित्यं यतेयातां स्त्री पुंसौ तु कृतक्रियौ।

यथा नाभिचरेतां तौ वियुक्तावितरेतराम् ॥ 9.102

एष स्त्री पुंसयोरुक्तो धर्मो वो रतिसंहितः ।

……………………………………………………………..\|\| 9.103. 

  

The verses obviously place man and woman on an equal footing and instruct married couple to be faithful to each other and not to behave contrary to the wishes of each other.
