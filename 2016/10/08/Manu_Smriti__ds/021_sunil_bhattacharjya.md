Namaste Paturiji,  
  

The protectionism of Manu (which the modern ladies find unacceptable) was like the ideas of a protectionist father or grand-father who found those extra-protective measures necessary in the days before the Ramayana times. Things have been changing with passage of time and different smritis appeared as was warranted. Things further changed since the times of the Mahabharata (towards the end of the Dwapara yuga), when Vedavyasa asked his father Parashara to write a Smriti suitable for the Kali yuga. That means it is not proper to follow the Manu Smriti in toto, particularly in cases where the Parashara Smriti
and the other earlier post-Manu Smritis have deviated from the Manu Smriti. The reason for the castigation of Manu in most cases, if not all, is due to the people being unaware of the above fact.
