Thanks, aadaraNIya Nityanandji, for the alert. Dr Ravi Khangai quoted the translation and asked whether it was wrong (translation of the verse under question). He pasted copying it from a source which did have the verse number. I should have noticed his mistake.

  

Now that we know of which verse the quoted translation is we should say, it is the correct translation of5.148 f and not a translation at all of 9.3.
