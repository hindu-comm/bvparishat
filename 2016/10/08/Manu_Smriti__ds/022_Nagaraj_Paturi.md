The point I was making was that if the source of attitudes of male superiority, male dominance, male chauvinism misogyny etc. which do exist in a certain section of Indian society (just as they exist in certain sections of different world societies), are traced to books such as 'Manu smriti', it is not correct because the book is not followed by a huge majority of the Indian society in the matters that the book covers. Smriti-reading, Smriti-studying and Smriti-following sections make very small parts of Indian society. Majority of the Indian castes and tribes follow codes secured (enforced, maintained etc. ) by their respective caste-panchayats and tribe-elder-bodies in the matters covered by the Smritis.

  

Even among the (small) sections that have a notional respect for the books such as Smritis, those who orthodoxly quote them trying to adhere to them are even less.

  

The present text being called 'Maanava Dhrmashaastra' in the colophons is set as a conversation where Manu is one of the important speakers alongside Bhrigu. Manu is not the 'author' of the book just as the Guru character in Vivekachudamani is not the author of Vivekachudamani or Matsyanarayana is the author of Matsya purana.

  

Its influence is not documented through citations from it in any ancientor older medieval texts.

  

It has acquired prominence in discussions only from the colonial times onwards.

  

The attitude towards women as expressed in many Sanskrit texts such as Mahabharata, Ramayana and Bhagavata ,that are connected to the popular imagination of a vast majority of Indians ('Hindus') are not in consonance with many ideas expressed in the book under discussion.
