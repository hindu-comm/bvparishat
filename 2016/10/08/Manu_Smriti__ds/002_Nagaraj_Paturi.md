पिता रक्षति कौमारे भर्ता रक्षति यौवने।  
रक्षन्ति स्थविरे पुत्राः न स्त्री स्वातन्त्र्यमर्हति॥

"woman should remain dependent on her father during childhood, on her husband during youth and on her son during old age " not the meaning of this verse.

Man should 'protect' 'take care of' a woman as father of a girl-child, husband of a young woman and son of an old woman. Woman does not deserve to be left to her own protection, uncared for at any stage of her life.
