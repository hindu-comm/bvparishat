In my opinion, the translation of vaśa (वश) in MS 5.148 as control is problematic. Vācaspatyam lists two meanigns of the word vaśa (वश):

1\) āyattatve (आयत्तत्वे): in the sense of dependence. The word āyatta (आयत्त) means adhīna (अधीन) or dependent, as in the usage दाराधीनस्तथा स्वर्गः (dārādhīnastathā svargaḥ)

2\) prabhutve (प्रभुत्वे): In the sense of lordship or power

  

Now when a word has two meanings, is it justified to take only one of them as only possible meaning and completely ignore the possibility of the other meaning?

  

If the āyatta meaning is taken, then the verse would be translated as:

बाल्ये पितुर्वशे तिष्ठेत्पाणिग्राहस्य यौवने।  

पुत्राणां भर्तरि प्रेते न भजेत्स्त्री स्वतन्त्रताम्॥

“In childhood she may remain dependent on her father; in youth, dependent on her husband; and when her husband is dead, dependent on her sons. She may not obtain (live with) independence.”

  

Is this not a more coherent meaning? There is a big difference between a widow living under *control of her sons* and a widow being *dependent on her sons*. The former interpretation (a mother being under the control of her sons) would go against numerous śruti, smṛti, and itihāsa verses on mother and the very idea of motherhood in Indian tradition.
