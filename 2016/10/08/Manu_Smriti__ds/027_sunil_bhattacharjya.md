Namaste,  
  

If you permit me, I would like to add that according to Manu, mother is more respectable than father, Secondly women in general are considered to be never impure. So much so that, I understand that there is an ancient statement (but I do not have the reference with me) that woman's mouth also do not become impure and that may even mean that one can consider anything half-eaten by a woman as not become defiled (ucchishta). That shows the higher status accorded to woman in the Indian society, at one time in the past. .  
  

Regards,
