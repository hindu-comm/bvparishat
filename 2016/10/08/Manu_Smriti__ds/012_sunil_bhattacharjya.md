Namaste,  
  

While the spirit of the Manu Smriti is required to be generally maintained in all Smritis, Vedavyasa tells us in the beginning of the Parashara Smriti, that subsequent to the Manu Smriti several other Smritis were required to be written, keeping in mind the changing times in the subsequent yugas.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
