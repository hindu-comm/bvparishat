In an older post on a related topic, I posted as follows:

  

अर्हति in न स्त्री स्वातंत्र्य मर्हति is similar to अर्हसि in न स्त्वं शोचितु मर्हसि . Just as in न स्त्वं शोचितु मर्हसि , the idea is you are too high in stature to weep, in न स्त्री स्वातंत्र्य मर्हति too, the idea is woman is too high in stature to be left to self-protection. The preceding three lines of the verse are talking about protection /looking after /taking care of only. Rule of consistency compels only one meaning to the word स्वातंत्र्य, i.e., being left to self-protection/ self-care, to be left as a destitute only. Thus this unduly notorious line from the book is in fact is ordaining the males not to leave the female members of their family to self-protection.
