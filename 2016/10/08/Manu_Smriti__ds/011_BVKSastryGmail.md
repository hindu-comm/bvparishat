Namaste



Can we look at the translation of the word ‘rakshati/ rakshanti’ from the root ‘ raksh’ in a slightly different angle ? 



The indicated translation is associating the meaning ‘ dependency’ for the word ‘rakshati/ rakshanti’ and making it mandatory by the use of the word ‘should’.



‘Kaumare’- in the pre-puberty period /before a formal marriage , Father protects – functions as the guardian for the ‘Stree’.

‘Yauvane’- in the post puberty / married status, Husband protects – functions as the guardian for the ‘Stree’.

‘Sthavire’ – in the old age, children protects – functions as the guardian for the ‘Stree’.



In such an environment of society, which is guided by the context of Manu Smriti 9^(th) chapter and preceding slokas (9-1 and 9-2), the last part reads ‘ Stree’ does not qualify for a ‘ licentious, Self –Opted
freedom’.

The Sloka (9-3) is conditioned by the preceding sloka (9-2) for whom the sloka applies. The ‘Stree’ who is ‘ immersing herself in the sensuous path, a licentious path ( Vishayeshu sajjantyah).



What if conditions also apply here, which again are detailed and deliberated in Manu Smriti. Women who are not married under parental care, Women who opt for ‘swayamvara’, Women who opted for ‘ celibacy’ (like Anasuya and Priyamvada in Shakuntam), Women who did not have children after marriage, children abandoning parents, …



It is in this wider context, the original text passage needs a better translation and contextual explanation to bring out a holistic view of Manu on Women; and not fragmented isolated preferred distortions. Issue of History are different from Value parameters, from a tradition which projected ‘Maatru Devo Bhava’.
