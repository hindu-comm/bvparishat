Sir,  
  
Thanks for pointing out the usage of Arhasi in the Gita.  
  
I strongly believe that our ancestors had great regard for woman. Still I would like to know whether there are any instances in Sanskrit literature where the word 'svatantryam' is used explicitly in the sense of 'self-protection, self-care'?  
  
regards  
shankara

In an  
older post on a related topic, I posted as  
follows:  
अर्हति in न  
स्त्री स्वातंत्र्य  
मर्हति is similar to अर्हसि in न  
स्त्वं शोचितु मर्हसि .  
Just as in न स्त्वं शोचितु  
मर्हसि , the idea is you are too high in stature  
to weep, in न स्त्री  
स्वातंत्र्य मर्हति too,  
the idea is woman is too high in stature to be left to  
self-protection. The preceding three lines of the verse are  
talking about protection /looking after /taking care of  
only. Rule of consistency compels only one meaning to the  
word स्वातंत्र्य, i.e., being left to  
self-protection/ self-care, to be left as a destitute only.  
Thus this unduly notorious line from the book is in fact is  
ordaining the males not to leave the female members of their  
family to self-protection.
