Let me reiterate the points I made in the earlier context:

  

1\. For the handling of the issues covered byManusmriti, majority of Indians do not follow that book. They follow their own caste -codes and tribe-codes that are secured by their respective caste panchayats.

  

2\. The particular section mentioned by the news report is 2/213 etc. is part of a section ofManusmritidealing with the code for a Brahmacharya-bound vidyaarthi living in the residence of his teacher. Hence the code applies only to such vidyaarthis, not to everyone.

  

3\. Statements are to be viewed from the reference frame, from where they are made. The verses before and after the ones under question are all talking about the behaviour of the vidyaarthi towards the teacher, his wife etc. The verses under question are directed towards the indriyanigraha on the part of the male student are not directed towards the nature of women.

  

4\. In many western countries, there are regulations not allowing children of opposite sex to share the bed or bed room.

  

मात्रा स्वस्रा दुहित्रा वा न विविक्तासनो भवेत्

  

is not more weird than this, as this is talking about a sexually mature person.

  

5\. अर्हति in न स्त्री स्वातंत्र्य मर्हति is similar to अर्हसि in न स्त्वं शोचितु मर्हसि . Just as in न स्त्वं शोचितु मर्हसि , the idea is you are too high in stature to weep, in न स्त्री स्वातंत्र्य मर्हति too, the idea is woman is too high in stature to be left to self-protection. The preceding three lines of the verse are talking about protection /looking after /taking care of only. Rule of consistency compels only one meaning to the word स्वातंत्र्य, i.e., being left to self-protection/ self-care, to be left as a destitute only. Thus this unduly notorious line from the book is in fact is ordaining the males not to leave the female members of their family to self-protection.

  

6\. Male chauvinism is not because ofManusmritibut in spite of it. Male chauvinism is more in societies that do not haveManusmriti.

  

7\. It is easy to protest currently unused, currently uninfluential books than to be respectful and not lustful towards women.

  

8\. As long as the universities do not teach their students to critically understand the diversionary propaganda that leaves the lustful to keep the position of women vulnerable, the youngsters keep falling into the trap of such misplaced anger.
