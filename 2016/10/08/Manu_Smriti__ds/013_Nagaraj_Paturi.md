\> Patrick Olivelle's translation given below is not right?

  

'“As a child she must remain under her father’s control; as a young woman, under her husband’s; and when her husband id dead, under her sons. She must never speak to live independently” (The Law Code of Manu 5.148, 149)

  

Obviously not right, Dr Ravi Khangai!

  

पिता रक्षति कौमारे भर्ता रक्षति यौवने।  

रक्षन्ति स्थाविरे पुत्राः न स्त्री स्वातन्त्र्यमर्हति॥

Where is the word meaning 'control' in thefirst three quarters of the verse ?

Where is the word for 'must never speak to' in the last quarter?
