Thank you Prof. Koradaji, for saying this loudly, though everybody knows about the need for escorting ladies but afraid of saying it loudly, lest it is interpreted as male chauvinism. There is a saying in some language that deer's enemy is its own flesh, so also for going out in lonely places and at odd times.
