Dear friends,

As some of you might be aware that the latest social debate in the US centers on

the respecting women and their dignity. My personal view has been that a discovery

that a woman could be the creator of the universe is the most important speculation

from the Indian theorists. it probably continued with the material aspect of life

where no metaphysics was invoked. I am still searching when the concept of

unpredictability in the form of chance and luck entered the thought process. I do see

evidence in the Vedas. The latter concept is imagined to be more powerful and

assumes a masculine form, eventually termed as "God."

Kaushalya in Valmiki, chastises Rama declaring the divinity of the mother and the

institution of mother. Eventually she reconciles and blesses him. This characterization

that a mother always feels protective of her children becomes a fundamental attribute

of motherhood as I see. 

Let us celebrate Mother on this day of Vijayadasami.
