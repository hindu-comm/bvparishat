This was true in olden days because women had no financial independence. Today more and more women are financially independent from fathers, husbands and sons. With money any body can buy protection. No problem.

  

What is true today is this the Bhujanga Metre Slokagiven in Apte Dictionary -

  

धनैर्निष्कुलीनाः कुलीना भवन्ति ।  
धनैरापदं मानवा निस्तरन्ति ।  
धनेभ्यः परो बान्धवो नास्ति लोके ।  
धनान्यर्जयध्वं धनान्यर्जयध्वम् ॥

  

Money is the best relative and best friend. If you want a better friend get a dog.
