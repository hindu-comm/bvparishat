Namaste



On the contentious issue of ‘ Women’s Freedom and Rights’ in Manu Smriti \> interpreting the selected line \< न स्त्री स्वातन्त्र्यमर्हति \>
Manu: 9-3.:



a) Another reference 5-148/149 is pitched in where the words and context are different. Would this mean an internal inconsistency in Manu’s thoughts /Framework of Dharma OR the need to understand the text in context , by properly reading the literal text without overtures ?



There is a clear linguistic difference pointed by the use of two different verbs in the communicative statements and contexts . The enforcement from the verbs make this clear.

\< **र्वशे तिष्ठेत्पा**.. **न भजेत्स्त्री** स्वतन्त्रताम्॥ > Here the conclusion is \< Women shall not be entitled to Self- Sought Freedom>.

And

\< पिता **रक्षति** कौमारे भर्ता रक्षति यौवने। रक्षन्ति स्थाविरे पुत्राः **न** स्त्री स्वातन्त्र्य**मर्हति**॥ > . Here the enforced command is for the Father, Husband and Children pointing to their ‘Swa –Dharma’ – their duties, without taking any recourse to the ‘women’ or ‘ options a women has’.



**What could be the reason for a Patrick Olivelle to miss the obvious and project a partial view ? And why media wants to take translation as authority than the original source ? **
