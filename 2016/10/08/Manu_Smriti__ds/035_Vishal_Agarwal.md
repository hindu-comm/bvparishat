After reading Patrick's Olivelle's translations on Dharmasutras, Manu and the Upanishads, I have reached a firm conclusion that they present the basest and vilest possible interpretations in many cases (some other Indologists like Stephanie Jamison are worse). In the case of the Upanishads, he often surreptitiously incorporates 'emendations' proposed by earlier racist Indologists and these often change the meaning of the traditionally handed down text. This is a very sad situation because many Indologists have come to regard his works as the 'latest', 'scholarly' expositions representing the 'best scholarship.' At best, we can consult his works to look at secondary literature on the root texts, but the translations and the introductions are really Eurocentric and Hinduphobic.
