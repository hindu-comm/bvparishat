Sorry, inadvetently some portion of the text got omitted. The full message is as follows:  
  

Thank you Prof. Koradaji, for saying this loudly, though everybody knows about the need for escorting ladies but afraid of saying it loudly, lest it is interpreted as male chauvinism. There is a saying in some language that deer's enemy is its own flesh, so also the beauty and the charm of the ladies make it necessary for them to have the need for escorts for going out, particularly in lonely places and at odd times.  
  

Regards,
