नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Today , भृगु , the author of मनुस्मृति , stands vindicated - the निर्भय Act . Even a small girl in not spared nor an old woman .

  

The situation would certainly deteriorate - nobody can stop them thru
स्मृतिs and Acts - it is an utopian idea.

  

There is another स्मृति prescription - never send a girl / lady alone anywhere - someone - father / husband / son etc should accompany her .

  

शकुन्तला was provided maximum security by कण्वमहर्षि while sending her to in-law's house.

  

’ ऋषयः प्रत्यक्षीकृतधर्माणः ’ - had visualized the social and other changes that are going to come thru दिव्यदृष्टि ( clairvoyance) and prescribed certain norms long ago.

  

धन्यो’स्मि
