Namaste



**A related question**:



There is an English word ‘ MISOGYNY’ used in media, becoming more popular in circulation in connection with the US Presidential election Candidates caricature in relation to his comments on ‘women’.



For understanding what ‘ **MISOGYNY**’ means, please explore <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny> . The link, curiously enough explains this word in the context of many world religions, but seems to miss ‘ Manu /Sanatana Veda Dharma’.



**The question:**



(i) Is there a Sanskrit word covering the complete shades of meaning associated with ‘ MISOGYNY’ ? ( the simple translation like *Stree-dveshi, Ashleela -Vaktaa* would not be apt in this case !)



\(ii\) Does Manu’s Treatise on Dharma carry any seeds of thoughts that can trigger ‘ MISOGYNY’, on comparable terms of Other World Religions listed in the above resource ? (This would bring out the true essence of Manu 9.3)
