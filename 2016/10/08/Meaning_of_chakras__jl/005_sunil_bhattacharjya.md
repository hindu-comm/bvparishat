Namaste,  
  
I think what you are looking for is in the Dhyanabindu upanishad.  
  
स्वशब्देन भवेत्प्राणः स्वाधिष्ठानं तदाश्रय्म् ॥ ४७b  
  
The Svadhisthana Chankra is the genitals With guru's guidance one can cross this chakra easily, but it is difficult otherwise. It is safer to follow Lord Krishna's advice to concentrate on the Ajana Chakra.  
  

Regards,
