The references of chakras are found in different tantra shastra granthAs, dEvi bhAgavata purANa, Lalita SahasranAma etc. However, a crisp & concise book has been authored by Swami Sivananda Saraswathi with the title "Kundalini yoga" which is available in book stores.
However, tantra shAstra should be studied with the help of an able guru who is well-versed in that subject. Self-study leads to confusion which is pramAda. It is an occult subject consisting of inter-woven thought processes and principles. So, self-study is discouraged.

  

Since, you have asked about swAdhiSTAna, there is a beautiful reference in dEvI purANa as:

  

"स्वशब्देन परंलिङं स्वाधिष्ठानं ततोविदुः"

  

The tattva "para-linga" is referred to by the name "sva". And the chakra, that is presided with this "para-linga" is called

svAdhiSTAna.

  

Now, you have asked about the role. There is a subtle knot (granthi) above this called "brahma-granthi". During the upsurge of kuNDalini, this knot gets loosened and the kuNDalini shoots up easily.

  

Moreover, the most important aspect with this chakra is that it contains the "agni" tattva; mUlAdhAra being the "prithvi" tattva. The yogi, during prANAyAma, with the process of kumbhaka, holds the breath and fans the "agni" of svAdhiSTAna. This also produces a "spanda" (vibration). Thus, the spanda and agni which is already aggravated with fanning, produces the heat which reaches the mUlAdhAra. The sleeping kuNDalini, till then, when receives the heat, shoots up with a hissing sound. When it shoots up hissing, it tries to satiates it's thirst and tries to grab the water (maNi) present in maNipUra. With the heat produced, it dries up. Thus, in order to drink the nectar that is present in the chit-chandra-maNDala which is present in sahasrAra chakra, it pierces anAhaTa, vishuddhi, AjnA and enters the realm of 1000-petal lotus in the crown called "sahasrAra". Having drunk the nectar, it gets "tripti" and this "tripti" nourishes the 72000 subtle nerves in the yogi.

  

Now, there are various methodologies taught by various sampradAyAs which vary from tradition tradition and those discussions are out of the scope now.
