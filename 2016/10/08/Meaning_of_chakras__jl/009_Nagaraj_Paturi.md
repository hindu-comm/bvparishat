शतं चैका च हृदयस्य नाड्य\\-

स्तासां मूर्धानमभिनिःसृ‍तैका ।

तयोर्ध्वमायन्नमृ‍तत्वमेति

विष्वङ्ङान्या उत्क्रमणे भवन्ति ॥ 2-3-16॥



In Shankarabhashya the एका has been taken as Sushumna. Since Sushumna is a subjective reality butnot an objective, material entity, the remaining शतं, हृदयःand the process ofअभिनिःसृतिshould also be taken as subjective facts rather than objective, material entities. हृदयः is theentity located near अनाहतand the locus operandi ofअंगुष्ठमात्रपुरुषwhich is again a subjective universal fact like the above ones.



In this even मूर्धानं is found. Is this connected to Brahma Randhra and/or Sahasraara?

  

In the same Kathopanishad, hridaya, the location of Anaahata is referred to, many number of times, using the word guhaa.

  

Here, in this verse, hridaya is directly used.
