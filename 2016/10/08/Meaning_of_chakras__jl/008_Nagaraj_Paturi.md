Dear Aayushmaan VidwanSriram,

  

Vidwan Satish Kumarji's question was about Sanskrit textual references. Dhyanabindu Upanishad mentioned by aadaraNIya Sunilji is an example.

  

In the posts I provided links to, scholar were discussing if there was Vedic reference to Chakras.

  

Their conclusion was that it all started with tantric and Buddhist sources not Vedic. They might argue that Dhyanabindu Upanishad etc. are recent and are influenced by Tantric and Buddhist texts.

  

The mantra that I quoted and various Upanishads talk about hridaya though they do not use the wordanaahata chakra.

  

There is a mention of naaDis in kaTha and other Upanishads.

  

The question is still open to research.

  

Regards,
