Thanks Mr. Paturi. But the ideas discussed in most of such 'sources' seem to have arisen along the line. I am looking for references from original Sanskrit texts, and I am not able to find anything other than the Nabhi chakra in Yog Sutras. Of course there are books that have talked about Swadhishthan chakra, but these references do not fall into an overall pattern.  
  

Regards,
