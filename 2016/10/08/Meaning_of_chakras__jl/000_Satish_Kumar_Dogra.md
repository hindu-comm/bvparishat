Friends and scholars,  

 The Yog Sutras says:  
  

नाभि चक्रे कायव्यूह ज्ञानम्  
  

This is very logical because नाभि is where the unborn child was connected with the mother and, hence, all nerves and communication systems must pass through the नाभि as they connect the growing fetus with the mother.  
  

My question is: are there any other textual references where there is any specific information about the other 6 chakras?  
  

Regards,  

Dogra, Chennai
