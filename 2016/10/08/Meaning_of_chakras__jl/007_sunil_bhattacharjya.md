If one is unable to find a guru, then one can do what Jagadguru Lord Krishna suggested. One can do dhyana on the Bhrumadhya. The Ajna Chakra, which has been translated by some as the command Chakra, controls the mind and there is no danger of the lower Chakra's interfering with the rise of the Kundalini. Hirashi Motoyama had done a lot of scientific studies on it quite some tme ago, and seems to confirmed this
