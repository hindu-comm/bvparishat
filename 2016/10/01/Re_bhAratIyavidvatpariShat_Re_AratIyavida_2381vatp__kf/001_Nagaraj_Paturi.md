Dear Dr Joshi ,

  

'Mahabharata empire' issue is not related to AIT/AMT Vs OIT issue because the time period under debate in theAIT/AMT Vs OIT issue is different from that of 'Mahabharata empire'.

  

I have a great respect for your home work on the 'Mahabharata empire' concept. I learn a lot from your work on the parts of the world that are covered in your posts related to this issue.

  

But the only point that I tried to make was that one needs to see where in the current academics (which topic of which discipline through which method) does all this belong.

  

Regards,

  

-N
