Standardization makes languages grow as gardens. Lack of it makes them grow as forest.

  

Standardization happens even without conscious efforts on the part of the users of the language, in the form of tools such as grammars, dictionaries etc. or in the form of agencies such as boards of technical terms. But conscious efforts lead to a planned development of languages. Many civilized societies resort to conscious efforts.

  

None of the conscious efforts to standardize are so one sided and autocratic as not to leave any scope for individual innovation. In all the societies where there are such efforts, standardizing agencies and innovators work in coherence with each other.
