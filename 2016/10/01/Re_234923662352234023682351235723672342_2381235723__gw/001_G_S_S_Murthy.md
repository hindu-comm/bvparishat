Dear Prof. Joshi,

Your point is well taken. This is essentially in a new garb the age-old dilemma between innovation and standardizatiion. Both have their advantages and disadvantages.

By and large, equivalents in Indian languages to technical terms originate in text books which are designed by text-book committees which act as what I called "the Board". Popular science writers in local languages adopt them. They slowly become a standard. I studied Science and mathematics in Kannada medium up to SSLC and I can see how the Kannada technical words I learnt have seeped into common usage.

I believe the French have an organization which regulates the use of new words getting into French.

As for coining new words in Sanskrit in the area of Science/mathematics, we need to have a mix of 3 approaches.

1\. Etymology of the word in English.

2\. Where etymology is not meaningful, we could look at the context of the usage and coin an appropriate word.

3\. There will be instances where it is best to use the English word itself making a "halant" into an "akaaraant". The classificatory nomenclature for flora and fauna, geology etc. are perhaps used as such.

While coining new nouns derived from the verb, we could have a convention. Ex: An instrument will be a "lyut" of the verb. "Nvul" will denote a person. "yat" will denote a process etc. 

Regards,

Murthy
