Dear Scholar,  
  

Pl.refer to the excellent reference book,Jinaratnakosha- edited by Prof H.D.Velankar of the Bombay University.  
  
It is a very old book,but,a must for those who want to do research on Jain texts as well as Authors.It could be available in any old and reputed library.  
  

Moreover,you can refer to the Five or Six-volume Hindi book,viz.Prakrit Sahitya ka Itihas. I forget the name of the editor.It could be D.D.Mehta and the book is published from Varanasi  
  
  

Hope,this serves your purpose.  
  

Best luck.  
  

Prof Siddharth Y Wakankar.
