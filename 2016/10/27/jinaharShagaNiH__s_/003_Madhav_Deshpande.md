Hello Shri Subhankar Basak,

  

  Jinaharṣagaṇi composed a Prakrit poem titled "Rayaṇaseharanivakahā" (Skt. Ratnaśekharanṛpakathā) and this has been published. Here are the details of this publication.

  

*Jinaharṣagaṇiviracitā Rayaṇaseharanivakahā / Śreṣṭhitrikamacandratanūjena  
*

*... Haragovindadāsena saṃśodhitā Saṃskr̥tacchāyayā vibhūṣitā ca.*

*Jinaharsha, fl. 1648-1707.*

*Vārāṇasyāṃ : \[Jaina Vividha Sahitya Shastramala Office\], 2445 \[i.e., 1918\].*

Hope this is helpful.
