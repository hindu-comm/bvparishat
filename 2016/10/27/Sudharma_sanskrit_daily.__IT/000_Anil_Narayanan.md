Namaste..  
One of my friends forwarded the following news.  
  
\*Sudharma\* is the only newspaper published in Sanskrit language. It is published from Mysuru, Karnataka since late 1970s.  
  
It is now struggling for funds. It is in our own interest that we keep the Sanskrit language alive for future generations.  
  
You can help by :  
  
a) Becoming a subscriber to the physical copy of the paper (It costs only Rs.400 per year!) and making your friends and relatives as subscribers  
b) Placing advertisements in the paper  
c) Donating money directly  
  
Visit : <http://sudharmasanskritdaily.in/>  
  
Please forward this message so that it can recieve the help that it requires badly.  
  
With pranams,  
Anil.
