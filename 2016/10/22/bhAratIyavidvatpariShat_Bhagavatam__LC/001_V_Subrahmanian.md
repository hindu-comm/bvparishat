It is my understanding that both Shankaracharya and Ramanujacharya have not quoted from that work. Madhvacharya has written a whole work on that text: bhāgavata tātparya nirṇaya. It is possible that some Vishishtadvaitin Acharya after Ramanuja and before Madhva could have cited it. Other knowledgeable members might throw light on this.
