Namaste

  

Really entertaining composition-

The conclusion -जागर्ति पुण्या पुरी ।।

Is significant with meaning.

Going beyond the literal translation of last part as -'Thus wakes up the Pune city.' MayI suggest the following: ' Thus, Pune is ever alert'.

  

( inspired by the expression -City never sleeps- for NY. And Gita use of word ' yasyAM jAgarti saMyamI').
