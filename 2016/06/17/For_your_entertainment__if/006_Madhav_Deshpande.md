Dear Suresh,

  

  Among the Sanskritists of Pune, the Sanskritized name Puṇyanagarī has been there for a hundred years or more. Historically, the earliest inscriptional reference to Pune gives the name Punakadesa or Punakawadi.
The city as we know it srarted taking shape when the 1st Bajirao Peshwa moved to Pune and built a fort there. The core of old Pune dates to the Peshwa period.
