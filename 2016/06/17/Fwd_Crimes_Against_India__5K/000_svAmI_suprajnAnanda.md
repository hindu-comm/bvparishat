I recently read this book

<https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZYEXGU/ref=nav_timeline_asin?ie=UTF8&psc=1>

  

I know we are all working to understand Sanskrit and through that Sanatana Dharma. This book gives a good record of history and why we should read it to appreciate the suffering our ancestors went through to have the freedom of though and deed to protect sanatana Dharma. Kindle version is only $5.99

  

I thought to let you know and if you read and like it please let others know as well

  

Thanks

Anant
