Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



The word "pratyaahaara" is used in Praatishaakyaas, by PaNini in his VyaakaraNaand in As'TAnga Yoga.



What is its exact meaning? Is it the same in all three instances or different?



What are the components of this word from Sandhi or Samaasa or upasargapoint of view? Thanks . N.R.Joshi.
