Namaste. While thankfully acknowledging the interest taken by BVK, I like to point out that I am not looking for an explanation. I am looking at Indic traditions, textual and otherwise from a relative historical perspective. The various letters associated with the 27 stars available in the almanacs is a later custom; by that I mean later than the Vedic references to Nakshatra-name by which the agni-invocation had to be done by the Ahitaagnis, associating their action with one of the names of the eight (Saptarshi+Agastya) Rishis; depending on their Gotra. Some times NaamakaraNa is done during marriage nowadays simply as a procedure in case it was not done at the right time after birth.Social/religious customs mentioned in Sanskrit texts can not always be dated to a specific period other than tagging them as ancient. But if they are current now, it adds to our cultural richness.I had to provide this background so as not to deviate from my question and express my view that theTārādevatā-mātṛkākṣara-vinyasanamthat I am referring may have nothing to do with any "dharmashaastra" connected marriage rite. It may be in vogue in some minor communities who are Hindus (i.e. worshippers of Hindu deities like the majority) but by historical custom do not even need a Brahmin priest to solemnise the marriage. I have communities like the Kodavas in mind.
