Namaste,  
  

Prof. Iyengar said as follows:

  

  
\< Some times NaamakaraNa is done during marriage nowadays simply as a procedure in case it was not done at the right time after birth \>  
  

To my knowledge the renaming of bride is made so that there is some sort of matching of the names of the marrying couple. For example, if the groom's name is Rama and the brides name is Mandodari , then the latter name is changed to Sita. There is even a belief among some communities that the matching of names is as good as astrological matching of grahas and nakshatras.
