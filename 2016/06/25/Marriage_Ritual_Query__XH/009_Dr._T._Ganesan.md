No. For, the very concept and tradition of Dasamahavidya-s are of Tantric origin; probably in the late Smriti texts followed by Maithila Brahmins, these might have been incorporated. There are certain Smiriti-s and Nibandha-s especially composed in Mithila and Vacaspati Misra II, a medieval Smiriti (Nibandha ?) writer of Mithila is well known who is even now held as authority. I think the Kameshvar Singh Darbhanga Research Institute has published some of these texts...Better to verify.
