Namaste



A plausible explanation, may be in seeing the given word \< \> in a different perspective.



\<taaraa> also means \<nakshatra>- The stars. With this \< \> would read \< nakshatra- devataa-maatrukaa –akshara – vinyasanam> .



The Sanskrit varna-maalaa aksharas associated with \< Taara = Nakshatra + devataa –maatrukaa = letters associated with the 27 nakshatras \> are known from Jyotish. It is akshara-nakshatra or alaos called ‘ Naama-Nakshatra system. 



From this point, explaining the ritual practice may be easier.



This ritual is a part of even brahminical vivaha prayogas in nakshatra shaanti etc;.
