Prof.Paturi, Namaste. I discussed this topic with a Tamilnadu historian (environment & art) recently. She informed that usage of "Agni" was not prevalent among non-Vedic ethnic clans in ancient Tamilnadu during marriages. Slow diffusion of Vedic-culture (Sanskritisation) appears to have increased the presence of "Agni" in recent centuries.Collective marriages is also basically a non-Vedic practice, prevalent since ancient times in Tamilnadu, was her opinion. In this connection I have a doubt about the word "vadhuu-vara". While the word Vadhu is Vedic the word "vara' in the intended sense is not! MW
forवधू--वर**\[p=**[917](http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/2014/web/webtc/servepdf.php?page=917)**,1\]** cites Hemachandra (11th Cent). Can some one cite other classical use of this compound word in the sense of 'couple'?
