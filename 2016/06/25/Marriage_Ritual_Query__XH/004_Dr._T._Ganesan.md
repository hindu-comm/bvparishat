I have heard that the Darbhanga Brahmin-s, in Bihar, who follow the Smriti-s, also are staunch worshippers of the Ten Mahavidya-s: dasamahavidya-s. It's said that in their marriage rituals they also worship one of the Mahavidya-s such as KAli, TArA, etc. and also that the bride/bridegroom is given the mantra of a particular Mahavidya according to the family tardition for future upAsanA.  
It is worth verifying this custom.  
  
Ganesan
