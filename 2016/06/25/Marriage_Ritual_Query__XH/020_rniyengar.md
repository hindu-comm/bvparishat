Great many thanks for the quotes. They are all extremely relevant to my query. The historian I met was at ICHR on Tuesday in a meeting. She could not cite any reference immediately, but she seems to think the 6-10th Cent period inscriptions from Tamil nadu contain information on marriage customs also. If I succeed in locating any info, it will be shared with you.
