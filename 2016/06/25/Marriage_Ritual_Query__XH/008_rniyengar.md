Thanks to Prof.Paturi and Dr.Ganeshan.

My query arises from the Nāradaśilpam manuscript, which I am currently studying. The text in Lesson 48 is titled: *Vivāhaśālālakṣaṇam*. This describes planning of Marriage Halls in Palaces, individual residences and in villages. The text is long and I will not be able to reproduce it fully. However, I am intrigued by the “village hall” which refers to a community marriage hall, where the text reads:



*Vadhūvarayoḥ tāradevatāmātṛkākṣaravinyasanam
śubhavedikāyām……anyatra….. dvikā trikā *

*catuṣkāvadhikā aneka vadhūvarāṇām vivāhamaṇṭapikam……\|\| *



I have not come across any such statement or concept in other Vāstu/śilpa texts. I was under the impression the so called ‘mass marriage’ was a modern convention driven by political and economical forces. But the second part of the above Sanskrit text indicates this to be an ancient practice. Since the first part is about *tāradevatā*…… I was wondering whether the Nāradaśilpam text (which from several angles seems to be of South Indian origin) is indirectly referring to some important folk custom. Of course this is only a speculation. I will look into the customs of Maithili Brahmins as suggested by Dr.Ganeshan. Are there any Smṛti-text references to *Daśamahāvidyā* in the context of marriage ceremonies taught to the couple?
