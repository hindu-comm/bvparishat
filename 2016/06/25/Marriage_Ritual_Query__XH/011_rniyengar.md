Many thanks Prof. Paturi for taking interest to propose a likely meaning compatible with the context. The text knows Rangavalli, and village deities (without specific names). I have a further query. How ancient could be the "collective wedding" custom in India? I learn (from Google search) that this was in vogue in several other cultures also. Have you come across any literary or epigraph reference to such a practice in India; in any language?
