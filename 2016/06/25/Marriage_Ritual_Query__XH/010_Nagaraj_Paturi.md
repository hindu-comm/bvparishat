Thanks Prof. Iyengar for providing the details of the source of the phrase which are really amazingly interesting for the exact reasons that you already mentioned. 1. Village marriage hall and 2. the idea of collective marriage celebrations both are rare indeed in the pre-modern works.

  

I think there are two possibilities for the wording of the phrase to be as such:

  

1\. It could be certain rangavalli/rangoli/kolam/ muggu which for the literate or script-knowing author of the work ,looked like what he knows as Taradevi matrikakshara.

  

2\. There are Devi forms such as VaDivuDai amman and tiruvuDai amman. I found these words being interpreted as VaDivu = beauty uDai = with amman = mother goddess; tiru = Sri/ auspicious udai = dress amman = mother goddess. But I learnt from an authentic source that uDai could bethe borrowing of the Sanskrit word uDu =star, an encryption for the Vidyaa of the nametaaraa. In the tiruvottriyur/ tiruvottiyur temple in Chennai, we have VaDivuDai ammanand inMelur in the suburbs of Chennai we have tiruvuDai amman temple. If these ammans were absorbed as village goddesses and the kolams for these ammans were part of the village marriage rituals and we can consider thatthe author of the book used the Sanskritic names for those village goddesses as taaraadEvee.
