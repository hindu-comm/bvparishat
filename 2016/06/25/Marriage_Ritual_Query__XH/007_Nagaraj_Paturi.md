\>Some times NaamakaraNa is done during marriage nowadays simply as a procedure in case it was not done at the right time after birth.

  

------- Upanayana rituals include repeating the Sanskaras including Namakarana. Since, it is said, 'nowadays' here, my guess is that the Namakarana during marriage rituals might have been noticed in those marriages where Upanayana is being performed, nowadays, a few days/hours preceding the marriage rituals.
