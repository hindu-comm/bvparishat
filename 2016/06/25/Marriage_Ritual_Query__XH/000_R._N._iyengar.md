Dear scholars,

This query is about a marriage custom that is not mentioned in the usual Sanskrit Prayoga/Paddhati texts which bye and large follow Vedic procedures for the त्रैवर्णिकाs.

The ritual under question is तारादेवतामातृकाक्षरविन्यसनम् ( Tārādevatā-mātṛkākṣara-vinyasanam).

  

The literal meaning is quite clear. तारादेवता and the corresponding Bijaakshara are also known from Tantric / Buddhist traditions. \[Writings on links between Taaraa and Vedic goddess Saraswati etc are available on the web\]. My question is:  in which community and/or in which part of India this ritual is observed during marriage? To the best of my knowledge (corrections welcome) Grhyasutras do not even cryptically refer to any मातृकाक्षरविन्यसनम् during marriage. It is possible, this may be an ancient Tantric/Agamic custom now forgotten or existing in some villages. I request scholars of folk literature, Paali, Praakrt literature, Buddhist, Jaina and Sanskrit scholars conversant with ancient practices(सनातनसंप्रदाय ) to throw light on this custom.

regards

  

RN Iyengar
