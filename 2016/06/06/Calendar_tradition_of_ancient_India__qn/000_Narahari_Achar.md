Dear Members,  

I would like to bring to the notice of those who are interested in the 'Calendar tradition of ancient India' my paper entitled 'Revisiting the Calendar tradition of Ancient India', which is scheduled to appear in the June issue of IJHS. I am attaching a pdf version of the paper. This also addresses some issues of identifying the nakshatras.  

Regards  

Narahari Achar
