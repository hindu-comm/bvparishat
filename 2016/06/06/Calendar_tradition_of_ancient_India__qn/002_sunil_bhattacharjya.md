Dear Prof Achar,  
  

Yes, the entire nakshatra system with 28 nakshatras was there in Rigveda and that remained so till the time of the Mahabharata, when the Abhijita fell. The Mahabharata does mention the fall of the Abhijit nakshatra. The Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) scientists also found that Abhijit indeed fell around 5,000 years ago. From that time onward the 27 nakshatras, divided into 12 rashis, came, into use. Before that "rash" was to indicate the Suryodaya lagna only and its duration was just 1/12th of a day, as has been used to show the time of birth of Lord Ram in the Valmiki Ramayana.  
  

Regards,
