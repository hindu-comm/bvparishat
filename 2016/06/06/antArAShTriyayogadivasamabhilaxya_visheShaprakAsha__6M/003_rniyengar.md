Thanks to Sri Hegde for his response and the link. However I am not convinced. The article cited is more about the grammatical correctness of the word राष्ट्रीय. It does not answer or address my question about appropriateness or otherwise of the wordअन्ताराष्ट्रीयम् in the sense of International. Defending the derivation of a word is not same as its "accuracy-in-meaning" is what I am pointing out. As a counter example we have the more widely used word अन्तर्देशीयपत्र for *Inland Letters*. Perhaps in this case one would say the derivation should be देशस्यमध्ये विद्यमानम् ! Such ambiguities (not the presentअन्ताराष्ट्रीय for which no प्राचीनप्रयोग has been cited in the linked article) have to be sorted out in ancient texts from the context. This I agree. But why in modern practice of Sanskrit they should be allowed to remain? I am not finding fault with any organization but discussing a point as a lover of Sanskrit particularly of the "technical variety".
