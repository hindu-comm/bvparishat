Dear scholars,

How correct is the wordअन्ताराष्ट्रिय to mean *Inter-national ?* With my limited knowledge of languages I find this to be a mistaken case of 'homophony'

creeping into modern Sanskrit via Hindi. Strictly speaking the wordअन्तर् + राष्ट्रिय = अन्ताराष्ट्रिय would mean*Intra-national,* the**near opposite of the desired meaning ! I like to be corrected if wrong.

In my personal opinion विश्वयोगदिवसः would have been better. Incidentally in Kannada this difficulty is avoided by the word ಅಂತರ-ರಾಷ್ಟ್ರಿಯ अन्तर-राष्ट्रिय, which at least brings in another distant country into mind.

regards
