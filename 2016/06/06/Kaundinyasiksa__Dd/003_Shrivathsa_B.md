hariH OM,

Thanks for pointing this out. I had indeed misunderstood.

The book is still shown as available for sale here:  
[www.osmania.ac.in/sanskritacademy/Research/Publication.html](http://www.osmania.ac.in/sanskritacademy/Research/Publication.html)

The Maharishi Institute of Management has a digital copy and it refers to a source published in BORI. Getting a photocopy in BORI should be easy.

Sorry for not being of much help.

svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  
 shrivathsa.
