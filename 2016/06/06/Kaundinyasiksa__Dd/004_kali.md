HariH OM!

  

I downloaded a copy of the 'Kaundinya Śikṣā' from Maharshi Maheshyogi site and that is in sanskrit.

  

I also downloaded another copy of the 'Kaundinya Siksha' from Oriental Research Institute, University of Mysore: “Kauṇḍinya Śikṣā Ṣaḍaśīti” Manuscript #3322 in Descriptive Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts in the Oriental Research Institute, University of Mysore,Volume II (Vedāṅgam, etc.) 1978 (Oriental Research Institute Series 124).

  

But the texts are different. Perhaps it is another related work as can be presumed from the title “Kauṇḍinya Śikṣā Ṣaḍaśīti”.

  

Dhanyavādaḥ
