Saptavarna Chitrapatanga (The Rainbow Butterfly) - A fully illustrated colorful story book in Sanskrit.

  

Saptavarna Chitrapatanga tells the story of how four little children are taken to a dream land on a white elephant and their encounter with a rainbow coloured butterfly who wishes to join the children on their return journey to Earth. The events leading to this encounter and the children’s return journey to Earth depicts, through the storytelling, subtle and fluid qualities such as delicacy, compassion, understanding and a love for Nature. One of the few stories created by children, now translated into Sanskrit with four-colour illustrations, this book aims to reach out to our prime target audience of children between the ages of 9 and 15.
