Dear friends,  
  
I have a query. There was a time, either in the beginning of Dwapara yuga or it could have been somewhat before the start of the Dwapara yuga, that Lord Parashurama killed almost all the kshatriyas. There was no kshatriya who could face Parashurama, before the advent of Lord Ram. Lord Ram had shown Lord Parashurama that his time was up, yet on a later occasion, albeit for a cause, he had to try his might against Bhishma and he found Bhishma was a real match for him. Due to Lord Parashurama's killing the Ksjhatriyas, there were left the young kshatriya girls, who could not marry and an appeal was made to the brahmins to marrry the kshatriya girls, and the liberal-minded brahmins did respond to that appeal.  
  
According to "Jatibhaskara" of Pt. Jwalaprasad Mishra (JM) , the children of brahmin father and kshatriya mother were called MurdhAvashikta, but JM had not mentioned their profession, nor their family names (or surnames). Of course, Pt. Harikrishna Sharma in his "Brahmanotpattimartanda", mentioned one event where a Kshatriya boy, whom Dadhichi Rishi taught the Vedas and declared as brahmin, in order to save him from Lord Parashurama and Lord Parashurama also taught him Dhanurvidya thinking him to be a brahmin boy. Later on Lord Parsshurama discovered the truth about the boy and cursed him. At that stage Gautama Rishi and Dadhichi Rishi again came to the boy's rescue and they called upon Lord VishVakarmA to help the boy. Lord VishvakarmA taught him in certain areas, so that he can earn his living and gave the boy's identity as being a "MurdhAvashikta". This means that we cannot accept what Jwalaprasad Mishra wrote, even though he is acknowledged as a great scholar. It is also known that in any anuloma marriage the children after seven generations come back to father's fold if the intervening marriages were with the girls of the father's fold and the rest will go to the mother's fold. Thus eventually some of the offsprings went back to the Kshatriya fold and some to the Brahmana fold.  
  
Now, my query is : what are the family names of those noble brahmin family-trees, which at one time in the past, had a Kshatriya mother? As regards myself, I belong to Kanyakubja brahmin family and my ancestors moved fron Kanauj to Bengal in the past and later on some of my
forefathers moved out of Bengal during the 18th century.
