Ajitji,

As I observe, Lord or God are iconic English words. They are objects and

not concepts. Sankrit constructs of Bhagavan and Ishvara are conceptual

and better to be left alone without mapping. Yesterday I saw BhartRhari's

analysis on this in the second book of VakyapadIyam. What Rajiv Malhotra

has done, is to create a minimum list of words which should be reproduced

as such. I endorse the idea and request the scholars to help convey the

concept in English for the benefit of the youth. Many well known translations

suffer in this quick casual "dictionary words."

Thank you.
