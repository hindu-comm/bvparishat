Namaste Bijoyji,  
  

If this evokes a friendly constructive discussion, it will certainly be welcome. The facts, fiction and assumptions can be critically looked at. For example, the mention of Lord VishwakarmA can imply one equipped with the good knowledge of the areas belonging to Lord VishvakarmA.
