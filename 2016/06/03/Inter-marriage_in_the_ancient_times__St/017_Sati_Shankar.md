mAnyavar,

This thread gave me an unusual feeling and so I started typing.

Interesting is the fact is that we have header "inter-marriages"

And come down to adhikara, of making sense, with a few technical jargon which we find quite often, generally I remain silent, but not here.

Let me put on "certain aspects" discussed in this thread.

  

\(1\) It is said 'reading a text' is a compromise between the Author and the reader.

We all know what an author has written, at a certain point of time,was what in his mind that ink recorded.When I say what was in his 'mind', I denote what the author has in the form of thought, in terms of his first, may be mother or any, language.

When the reader comes to picture, he has his own mental (logical and semantic) world, eyes recognise the written characters, search the
semantic field in reader's mind, try match, or superimpose, or corroborate the word and the meaning in mind and forward this to interpreting faculty. The same paradigm applies when we take up language. We find word, search in dictionaries, again try finding if any word gives the "SAME" semantic truth, which author had been having in mind, if not we go through the process stated above and resort to approximations. It falls on the translator if he is justified with his profession and stuggles to find correct semantics for the word and matching word in the dictionary or tries to complete the translation any how by a cursory substitute of sense under translation.

  

When we say some thing is "non - translatable", refers to the situation where a translator does not find any word in which represents the "mental intent" represented in words by the original writer. Whatever are there as a translation is an approximation only if not inserted delebrately to divert the original semantic toward some intended semantic field. This is what missionaries and some Indologists have been doing when Indian traditional concepts were hijacked by the Church (or any aiming to convert) to denote as if it was belonging to their semantic field.

  

\(2\) Neuro-linguistics.

Let me be here a bit free to explain as a student.There has been a Nobel Laureate, Prof. Herbert Simon., a professor of Psychology, Statistics, Operations Research, economics and Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. He won Nobel in Economics. He wrote a little but beautiful book, named "The Sciences of the Artificial", where he says almost all the sciences play with artificial models. When a child drawas a map of India on his copy bookand puts dots where rice is produced, he, infact roams place to place in India, mentally, to locate the rice producung places. The same applies to all the sciences, including language. We create a world through words, which are nothing but just mental modeld presented in paper or any medium.

In the same way, computers, cosmology, nuclear reactions, ... just go on adding... all researches and discoveries are within mental models first then we test with actual physical data or generated data.

Without going further.... let us confine to "neuro" . In fact "neuro" is taken as a metaphor, which denotes a process where multiple stimuli associated through variable parametric values to give an output or response or end result whatever one may call.

Earlier computational sciences were more associated with purely boolean-logical operations, and "assuming" that we have found a "model" of brain which is not real brain but works like that, and knowing that it is the brain which works in almost all the fields, be it science, mathematics, arts, or whatever we see and do, it was thought that when we have an artificial brain like structure which performs brain like operation why not use it as a "research method" in all the explorations? And it was done.Thus far "neuro" had not entered the scene.

There was a big drawback of the above "brain model. Let me explain it in simple terms..When due to some accident some portion of brain becomes damaged, after the wounds are cured, body still behaves "nearly normally". How? This let scientists to depart from logical mental models as introduced above to see what is inside the brain, to make a better model of brain which has the capability or "Learning and correcting itself" . They reached to neurons and a complex inter-networking their of.

Neuro-physiology at its deepest level gives the ionic changes between the neuro-transmitters and receptors, it can give the end result by interconnecting a limited number of neurons....but has not reached to a stage where it can explain how by complex interconnection of neurons in the brain generates "thought process".

  

Essentially it is a mind-brain-mathematics paradigm which tries to model brain function as close as possible to real brain. When we model it, we use integral functions as studied in mathematics.

  

With this sursory background, we can see the same "neuro" taken as a "relation", or ' 'mapping" as we call it in mathematics, between an input stimulus space and the listed response space. Being part of the modelled brain structure, most of the sciences, especially allied sciences like Control engineering, and other engineering sciences, psychology, linguistics, etc etc wherever we find a complex network of cause and effect, use "neuro" as a link establishing a relation as stated above, between input and output.

Infact whereever we see some thing working "automatically" there are chances that Neural Netwrok based control is behind them. When we fli, and when it is stabilized at high altitude and pilot puts it in auto-pilot mode, it is that control.method applied there.

  

So finally, "neuro-linguistics" refers to a method of analysis where we establish relation between what is read or hear, if phonetics is resorted, with a semantic space to generate meanings, in abstraction or in some context, and ultimately aim to nearest "approximation" of interpretation.

As of now, it is and is going to remain a metaphor in the models of the brain.

  

Hope this gives the group a taste of how to react when "neuro" metaphor is bombarded in relation to linguistics,when called neur-linguistics, in psychology, neuro-psychology, textual analysis, in semantics as neuro-semantics etc etc.

In short where ever we find "neuro" preficed, leaving physiology aside, where real neurons are studied, hence in the sciences of the artificial, we must know it is just a paradigm of complex, i.e., multilateral connectivity connecting inputs and the output.

Sati Shankar
