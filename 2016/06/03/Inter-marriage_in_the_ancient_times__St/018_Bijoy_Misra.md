Dear Dr Shankar,

Very well analyzed. My interest has been in speech, which is the mapping of thought to sound.

Long time ago, I had some work in brain cell structure. With exposure to Sanskrit, I have been

wondering about the thought segmentation. We are far away from saying something definitive.

The detection of activity in the neural level is in infancy. My goal is to create awareness and

help design new experiments. We had a paper to WSC last year which can be read to appreciate

our thinking.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
