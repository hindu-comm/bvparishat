The definition of a word as a label versus the definition from its concept  

was researched by my father through his work. I see that the concept  

of word creation is fundamentally different in the east and west. I  

happened to encounter the writings of a folk poet of western Orissa who  

hardly went to school. His words are mostly made up from his own  

comprehension mapped to sounds. I plan to take some of these  

observations to a Neurolinguistics Conference in London in August.
