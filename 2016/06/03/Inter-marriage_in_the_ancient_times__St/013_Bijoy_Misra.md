Rajiv M participates in this list. He can say more.

He talked about the "non-translatable" as a topic in his book "Being Different".

Reading Valmiki, one discovers that many concepts have no on-to-one translation.

They have been forced in the past leading to total distortion.

While we forgive the errors, we must not continue them!

A translation must not be done using a dictionary.

(this is where Bhratrhari shines).
