Thank you Dr Misra

In my studies I have been working in the overlapping area of

  

{ (mind-brain-mathematics plus control engineering) + (psycho-neuro-physiological behavioural science) + (logic, methodology and philosophy of science)}

  

to explore decision making processes in complex business organizations.... LOL.. this is can summarised this way.

There is still complete dark... at micro level , it may be ok... but at the level of Self-Organization of a complex neural system..... there is just trial and error.

and a lot can be done, subject to current scientific and technological constraints...

  

Any way best wishes for your work and endeavour.

Regards

SS
