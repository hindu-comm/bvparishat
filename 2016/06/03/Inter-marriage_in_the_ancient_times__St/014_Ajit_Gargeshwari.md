What has “Non Translatable” “Neuro Linguistics Paper” got to do with the subject of this thread. What translations? No translation is ideal all translations attempt to give the reader a closest possible reading experience the original provides Has Bhratrhari translated? Forgive me for my errors I don’t understand what you are implying. May be another thread? What’s forced in the past is past there are good translations of many texts now. If one is not happy with translations it’s better to read the original. There is nothing like reading the original and commenting than reading a translation. All this is well known.
