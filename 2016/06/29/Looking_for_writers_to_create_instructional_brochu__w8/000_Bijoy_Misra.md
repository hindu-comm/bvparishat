Dear friends,

  

Good morning. I take the opportunity to seek help.

I had written earlier about a project India Discovery Center

<http://www.indiadiscoverycenter.org> that we are pursuing

in Boston, USA. The project aims to create an educational

cum cultural center to create awareness on the India's

cultural history and engage students in research and analysis.

Our first Conference is scheduled for July 23 on Indus

Civilization. Here is a write up on the project from the

local paper.<http://inenews.com/?p=12764>

  

Through this note, I wish to invite writers in the group to

participate in the writing project we have. Our goal is to

generate informative and instructional material for world-wide

circulation (translating to other languages etc). The material

is to be designed for High School children and lay public. We will

remunerate for the work. Strong aptitude for research and facility

to communicate to the children are the essential qualifications.

We have a team of six and we want to add four more.

Please write to me in case you would be interested. 

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
