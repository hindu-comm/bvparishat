Dear Scholars,  

 A generous audience, seeing a novice talk like a scholar, may call it his over-enthusiasm, while a more demanding group may disapprove of it as impudence. Since I am in the midst of great and generous scholars, I take the liberty of over-stepping my novice's mind-set to speak like a scholar with the noble intention of learning from the Elders in the Field.  

  

Sanskrit is unique among languages. It uses a system of packaging meaning into grammatically-designed structures by use of sandhi and samas. These two techniques, when used deftly, create packet-like structures where the grammatical-phonemic-combination completely coincides with a semantic unit. One such example of perfect use of this technique is the following message put up by Dr. Ramanujan on this group:



श्रीकृष्णावतारविषये -

नैष गर्भत्वमापेदे न योन्यामवसत्प्रभुः ॥ इति स्पष्टमभिहितम् ॥

सामान्यतोऽपि भगवतः सर्वावतारेषु

अजायमानो बहुधा विजायते । तस्य धीराः परिजानन्ति योनिम् ॥

स उ श्रेयान् भवति जायमानः ।

अजोऽपि सन्नव्ययात्मा भूतानामीश्वरोऽपि सन् ।

प्रकृतिं स्वामधिष्ठाय सम्भवाम्यात्ममायया ॥

इच्छागृहीताभिमतोरुदेहः

इत्यादिप्रमाणशतैः

ईक्षणध्यानसंस्पर्शप्रमुखैः पोषयन्प्रजाः ।

मत्स्यकूर्मविहङ्गादिविग्रहः प्रेक्ष्यते प्रभुः ॥

इति भगवतो विष्णोःरक्षणप्रकारः

जात इव मृत इव दुःखीव अभिनयति ॥



रामानुजः



Contrasted with this, I often come across instances where sandhi is used to combine adjacent words in a manner that hinders understanding. The sandhi in such cases seems to be employed just to obey the rules and gives the writing a superciliously pedantic touch. One part of a logical-semantic group is violently severed and combined with a previous word just to obey a sandhi rule, with the result that one has to do a bit of mental mathematics to retrieve the word that became the victim of author's violence and have to join it back with its natural sibling in order to understand the meaning.  

  

I am keen to know the observations of the scholars in this regard. In case my observation is right, I feel this issue of 'use and abuse of sandhi' needs to be made a focus of study and discussions in order to retain the beauty of the Deva Bhasha --- a technique of combining meaning and words into self-sufficient packets. I am not aware of any other language that has such quality. And perhaps no other language has.
