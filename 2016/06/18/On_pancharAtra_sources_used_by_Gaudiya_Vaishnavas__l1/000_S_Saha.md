Dear listfolk,  
  
Has anyone analyzed/compiled a list of sources of Pañcarātra-themed texts used as citations/pūjā manuals/things like the Hari-Bhakti-Vilāsa,etc in the Gaudiya Vaishnava sampradaya?  
  
I can recollect at the moment texts like Sātavata-Tantra(from where I have seen aspects like Kśīrodakaśāyī-Viṣṇu,etc),Bṛhad-Gautamiya-Tantra(mentioned briefly by Prabodhananda Sarasvati in his commentary on the Gopāla-tapanī),Siddhārtha-samhita(cited for its description of 24 forms of Viṣṇu,where they are arranged according to the positions of the weapons in Viṣṇu's hands,etc)  
  
I want here to start a discussion on  
  
(1) Whether somoene has discussed these citations,and compiled these citations into a single place(if not,this could be a great starting point to do so)  
  
After (1) is done with,  
  
(2) What is the text of the cited sources---this should be investigated next  
  
Later (3) Dating of the cited sources,and remarks on the background in which *those sources* arose will be helpful.  
  
Thanking in advance,  
  
Saha.
