Prof S. Korada and Dr. H.N. Bhat



Thanks for your explanation of boundaries of Aaryaavarta



(1) "आदर्शपर्वतः in कुरुक्षेत्र - East ; कालकवनम् (प्रयागः) - West. "



Should not be other way around? Kalakavana-East and Kurukshetra West? I may be corrected here.



\(2\) How do we know that Paariyaatra mountain is the same as Vindhya mountain?

According to my information during the war between Indra and Krishna, the top of the Paariyaatra mountain became flat.

I think Paariyaatra mountain is Pamir plateau.

There is description of the capital city Amaravati of Indra in Vanaparva of Mahabharata.

The sun never becomes strong in Amaravati.

Why should Indra come to Vindya mountain to fight with Krishna?

Page 258 of Apte dictionary--- the river Dris’advati flows into Sarasvati forming the eastern boundary of Aaryaavarta.

Apte also offers Manusmriti reference.

This is my information. If possible please clear my doubts so thatI can grow in our knowledge with your understanding. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
