No. The four boundaries of आर्यावर्त are identified in the line. Both are indeed names of mountains. But the sentence explains the extension of आर्यावर्त as ex tending to the south of Himalaya and north of Paariyaatra. It doesn't mean Paariyaatra is to the north of Himavanta. It means आर्यावर्त lies to the south of Himalaya and north of Paariyaatra.

In other words, Himalaya is the northern boundary and Paariyaatra (Vindhya mountains) is the southern boundary. Western boundary is दर्श (kurukshetra?) and eastern boundary कालक mountain (prayag?) .

Prof.Korada will exactly identify these boundaries.
