You are probably correct in this case. The quoted passage says प्रागादर्शात् - प्रत्यक्कालकवनात् means Aryavarta streches to the east of Adarsha and to the west of Kalakavana.

The agreement of Amara, Manu with Patali southern boundary with Vindhya is enough to identify them as identical as there cannot be two boundaries at the same time.

Manu agrees with northern and southern boundaries with Amara Simha quoted above

Regarding identifying ancient geographical names, कालकावन is identified with Anjanagiri in the east while many others identifiy Anjanagiri in Aphganistan and some in Punjab. Encyclopedia of ancient Indian Geography by Subodh Kumar. There is one more book by Alexandre Cunningham available in [archives.org](http://archives.org).
