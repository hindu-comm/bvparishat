Dear friend,  
  

I understand that there is a Sanskrit verse, according to which a man should take mantra-deeksha from a male guru and a woman should take mantra-deeksha from a female guru. It will be a favor, if any list member can kindly help me locate the verse and its source.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
