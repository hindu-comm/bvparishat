Namaste

Two points on for contemplation On \< good and bad> and dialects ofSamskrutham;

  

1\.  The regional languages -(Prakruts, Apabhramsha, mleccha ...) are properly under the ' Bhashaa' part of Samskrutham.

  

The ' Chandas( vedic) part is NOT considered for this consideration.

There is significant irreconcilable ' mata-bheda' on this ' historicity- vernacular variants by region, time and context' between traditional munitraya schools' and oriental western-colonial, linguists and indologists.

  

This has seriously damaged the traditional vedic studies and vedanta understanding.(- on practice part, i keep my silence).

  

2\. Within Samskrutham covering chandas and bhashaa, the perfection and precision of articulation , rule based processing of words is given highest priority.

  

Prakruts and other languages slacken this constraint and get ' distanced and separated' by Bhashaa - standards. The slip goes on and on till the word structure and articulation gets so distorted that the slippage can not be retraced or controlled! Example: sktधर्म to धम्म , आर्य to अय्य अरिय are noticed even in pre christian period; never confused for their language tab or meaning co-located usage.

  

The voice variants are another story line linked to scripting and spelling! And of course love of academia for diacritics! Where sanskrit scripting is romanized !
