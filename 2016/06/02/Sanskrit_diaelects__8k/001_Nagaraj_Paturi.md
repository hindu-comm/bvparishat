'Dialects' of Sanskrit in the ancient period were Prakrits only. Sanskrit is the 'standard dialect' (version spoken uniformly across the regions, with relatively greater stability,i.e.,with relatively slower change) of the language that was spoken in several different regional and socialdialectal forms called Prakrits.

  

This 'uniformity' of the'standard dialect' (in any language for that matter ) is not absolute. The speaking /usageof the standard dialect always gets influenced by the native dialect of the speaker.

  

On such an influence of the native dialect / language of the speakers of Sanskrit, on their speaking of Sanskrit, except sporadic observations, to my knowledge, there are nofocussed studies. 

  

If your focus is on the contemporary Sanskrit speaking and the 'errors' in it due to mother tongue interference, yes, that is heavy and glaring and makes good topic for study.
