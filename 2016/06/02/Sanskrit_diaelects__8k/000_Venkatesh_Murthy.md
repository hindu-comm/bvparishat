Namo Vidvadbhyaha

  

I observed different people from different parts of India are speaking using different words and style in Sanskrit. Influence of Hindi style is in North and other languages in South. I heard in ancient days also people from different parts had different styles and dialects. Is there any book describing all differentSanskritdialects and differences?
