Sir, Only for somevery few people Sanskrit is the first language they learned in life.For most people they will first make a sentence in mother tongue in the mind and translate it to Sanskrit and speak it.If this is happening mother tongue influence will be there when they speak.

  

I observed in the young generation alsothey become more comfortable in English than mother tongue. For them the translation in mind is from English to Sanskrit.

  

Theproblem is how to think in Sanskrit in the mind. Ifpeople can think in Sanskrit there will be no translation and influence of other languages when they are speaking.
