Dear Dr Sati Shankar,

  

Thanks for your email. Since I have been travelling I apologize for the delay caused in getting back to you. I see that Dr H.N. Bhatt has already thrown much light on "Rasa". If you allow me to be brief, this workshop is intending to focus on the Rasasūtra of Bharata (sixth chapter of the Nāṭyaśāstra) and Abhinavabhāratī. The idea of the workshop will be to focus on and discuss philological issues in the text.

  

I hope that clarifies your doubt. Thanks and best wishes.

  

Mrinal Kaul
