Though the question is addressed towards the coordinator, let me try to clarify from the association with the topic Tantra as it is obvious from the topic.

The word रस has a lot of meanings associated with it.

रसो गन्धरसे स्वादे चित्तादौ विषरागयोः।  
*शृङ्गारादौ*द्रवे वीर्ये देहधातौ च पारदे॥

गन्धे रसे स्वादे तिक्तादौ विषरोगयोः ।  
शृङ्गारादौ द्रवे वीर्ये देहधात्वम्बुपारदे।।इति विश्वःll

Also, -*शृङ्गारादौ*विषे वीर्ये गुणे रागे द्रवे रसः ।। अमरः ३.३.८३१ ।।

In associatin with philosophy, there is a रसेश्वरदर्शन (N0.9) in सर्वदर्शनसंग्रह among शैवदर्शन-s which based on वज्रकाय to be attained by use of अभ्रक and पारद, पारद synonymous with पारद identified with शिव himself. Hence रसेश्वर दर्शन.

Most probably this concept is related तन्त्र literature, several of which like रसार्णाव etc. are mentioned in this chapter inसर्वदर्शनसंग्रह than any works on भैषज्य or काव्यशास्त्र.

  

In काव्यशास्त्र, King Bhoja established शृङ्गार itself रस ---

शृङ्गारमेव रसनाद् रसमानाम  

and synchronize different theories तात्पर्य, ध्वनि,

तात्पर्यमेव वचसि ध्वनिरेव काव्ये।

In काव्यशास्त्र alss there is a work called रसार्णव which is a later work wuich evedently does not deal with रसेश्वरसिद्धान्त in Philosophy, But रस theory of Bharata as applied to poetics and dramaturgy.

In the context of आयुर्वेद, works like रसायन, can mean more than पारद. Iam not familiar with the topics in Ayurveda.  

  

Anyhow, we can expect a clarification of the title "Rasa Theory" in the context of "an international conference/workshop on Tantric studies." from the coordinator.
