"**Centre for Religious Studies (**CRS) in Manipal University. As the coordinator of this centre I look forward receiving your advice and collaborating with many of you. I invite scholars to visit our centre, interact with us and deliver lectures etc. To begin with we will soon be conducting a national workshop on the***Rasa Theory***and an international conference/workshop on*Tantric studies*."

  

Sir,

First of all kindly accept mt congratulations and best wishes for theendeavor you are making.

.

I have a little confusion, however, on the topic***Rasa Theory***your first national workshop. May be due to myunfamiliarity  

  

The word "*Rasa*" has become fashionable especially after much hyped and controversial investigation on *Rasa* by Pollock, which he associates to *kAvya SAstra.*

The other which being Indian we know, is***Rasa SAstra which comes in Ayurveda under bhaiSajya vibhAg, it is almost chemistry or byconventionsayalchemy/***

***  
***

***Will you please clarify which Rasa is your workshop be aiming.? And if it is either of these two, which of its dimensions are to be explored at a*****Centre for Religious Studies (**CRS)?

  

please do not mind but I am really confused since I have seen this notice.

regards

Sati Shankar
