Thank you very much Prof. Bhat ,for your "*rasapUrNa"* information on *rasa*.. It is adding to my knowledge.

  

Though I am still looking for a clarification for m organizers on the limit they wish to confine in relation to religious studies, they have a separate event on *Tantra.*

Any way thanks for clarification on *rasa*.

Regards

SS
