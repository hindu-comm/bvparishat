A post about the influence of iregional languages on Sanskrit and the emergence of different dialects of Sanskrit has initiated an interesting discussion on how most of us translate from English or other languages into English instead of thinking directly in Sanskrit.  
  

I believe this is one of the most important issues that should preoccupy this Forum devoted as it is to the growth and development of Sanskrit.  
  

First let me share some experiences:  
  

In 1978, when I was a lecturer of English Literature in Guru Nanak Dev University Amritsar, I learnt Russian. I spent a part of the day talking with my teacher in Russian and became as proficient in Russian as I was in English or Hindi. What gave currency to the language in my mind and helped me think in Russian rather than work by translations was my conversations in Russian with my teacher.  
  

In 1984 I came to Tamil Nadu and learnt Tamil. I made it a point to talk in Tamil and became proficient in Tamil and produced creative literature in the language. There are others among my cadre-mates who, even after three decades of service, have not move beyond asking for tea, coffee or food. That is because they have never tried to use Tamil as the medium of conversations.  
  

When I was in Punjab, I mostly talked in Punjabi and, even though I taught literature to MA students, the use of English was restricted only to the class. The result was that my English had a touch of Punjabi. After coming to the South, English became an important medium for communication through speech, and the language developed a more natural flavour of English than it had earlier.  
  

The sum-total of this entire long experience-sharing is that if we wish to make thinking the medium of thought of large numbers of people we need to start the practice of conversing in Sanskrit. And who can start this, if not the members of this Group?  
  

In [an article on my website](http://dograindia.org/soldiers-for-sanskrit) I suggested that we should all register in skype as Sanskrit Senanis. This will help us identify one another and start the conversations in Sanskrit. I have created for myself a skype identity called Sansenani_Dogra with my profile name as Satish Dogra. If others also create such an identity prefixing Sansenani with their names, we can locate one another easily and begin to converse in Sanskrit. Initially, there will be hesitation and difficulties, but soon things will become smooth.  
  

Again, let me tell you when I first started talking in Tamil, my interlocutor would develop a headache. (I didn't develop headaches, first, because of my enthusiasm to learn and, second, because I knew what exactly I was trying to say. The confusion was for him. üòÅ But those minor hiccups yielded a man with good command over Tamil. üòé  
  

So, friends, let us all pick up the gauntlet. Let us fill up the skype with Sansenani-s.
