Respected scholars,

  

Namaste.

  

I wonder is there references to the five Aśvamedha yajña performed by Yudhiṣṭhira in the Mahābhārata. There are a couple of reference to it in later texts such as Viṣṇudharama 44.1: 

  

पञ्चमॆनाश्वमॆधॆन यदा स्नातॊ युधिष्ठिरः॥

तदा नारायणं दॆवं प्रश्नमॆतम् अपृच्छत।

  

The first line the above mentioned verse also occurs in the Viṣṇudharmottara .1146.27ab. In the appendix passage of the Aśvamedhaparvan of the Mahābhārata, however, the verse appears slightly differently. The verse runs as follows:

  

14_004_0003—0004

पश्चिमेनाश्वमेधेन यदा स्नातॊ युधिष्ठिरः\|

तदा राजन् नमस्कृत्य कॆशवं पुनर् अब्रवीत्।

  

I wonder if Yudhiśṭhira performed five Aśvamedha. Or did he at least perform two of them so that Appendix passage have the reading पश्चिमेन (latter,final). If this is the case, would you please help me locating the passage in the Mahābhārata where he preforms the Aśvamedha Yajña twice or more?

  

Thank you.

  

Nirajan Kafle.
