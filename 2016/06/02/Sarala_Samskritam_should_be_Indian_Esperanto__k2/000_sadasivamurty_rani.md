1. As all of us know Esperanto is a widely spoken constructed language in the world prevalent in usage inin the northern and central countries of Europe; in China,[Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea "Korea"), Japan, and[Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran "Iran")within Asia in[Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil "Brazil"),[Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina "Argentina"), and[Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico "Mexico")in the Americasand in[Togo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Togo "Togo")in Africa.

  

2. It is also in our knowledge that Government of India has declared Tamil, Kannada,Telugu, Malayalam and Odiya in different years since 2004. The article 351 of the Constitution of India respects Sanskrit with a special status.

  

In the anatomic analysis of the linguistic body of India all the regional langues while play the role of various limbs Sanskrit does play the role of the heart. As the heart purifies the blood and pumps to all the limbs for their proper and efficient functioning Sanskrit supplies all the phonetic, morphological, semantic and syntactical elements and even the common and technical vocabulary to all the Indian languages irrespective of their Indo-European or Dravidian origin. This unifying nature of Sanskrit earned it a unique place among all the national languages.  The sovereignty of linguistic India could be well protected and still protected through Sanskrit only.

  

Either these classical languages or all the rest of the Indian languages could acquire a language status with the help of Sanskrit only having their cultural roots from the Sanskrit literature.

  

3. It has not also been out of the focus of our knowledge the fact that Sarala Samskritam has been receiving its due respect and recognition with in the entire subcontinent of Bharat and abroad as a result of the incessant efforts and commitment of the members of Samskrita Bharati through several decades. Several lakhs of Sanskrit speaking people are trained well by Samskrita Bharati.

  

Having been influenced by the efforts of Samskrita Bharati even in several states of our country some regional organizations also have developed their own syllabus and methods to popularize Sanskrit learning.

  

Considering all these facts, I humbly submit that efforts may be put forth to unify the efforts of all the Sanskrit propagating organizations and individuals to standardize the Sarala Samskritam Programme and popularize it as the ESPERANTO of INDIA (Surely not with the name ESPERANTO).

  

In this process a series of meetings with the Sanskrit scholars of different regions (from all the states) may be organized: The scholars may be requested

1. to list out the common and classified vocabulary of Basic linguistic structure of communicationof all the Indian languages

2. to find out the common morphological structures of all the Indian languages

3. to observe the equal semantic similaritiesof all the Indian languages

4. to identify even the common syntactical structural patterns

and finally to prepare a more standard Sarala Samskritam Programme with common features from all the regional languages and a platform should be paved to popularize it.



This is surely not a new idea but can be paid some attention for a better yield.

Warm regards,
