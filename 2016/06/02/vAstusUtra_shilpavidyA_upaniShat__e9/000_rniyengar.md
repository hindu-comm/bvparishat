Dear scholars,

  

As many of you would be knowingवास्तुसूत्र-उपनिषत् has been edited and published by Boner, Sarma and Baumer.(MLBD, 1982, 1996). The text has a foreword by Prof.Dipak Bahttacharya also. The work is about the theoretical that is scientific background of carving/sculpting which is of great importance to Hindu culture. The above authors have taken trouble to trace the palm leaf manuscripts available with the Sthapati (Vishvakarma Brahmin) community of Orissa and reproduced them in their book, which adds value to our cultural history. Similarly another Upanishad by name शिल्पविद्यारहस्य exists. This has been published in Kannada script by Dr.Jnanananda (an authority on temple shilpa) of Bangalore, recently. The text in archaic style (BraahmaNa) has a commentary known as Kaumaarabhaashya. This book is available for free download at the TTD website. I met Jnanananda a few days back (accompanied by Dr,Kannan and Ms.Meera) enquiring about the palm leaf scripts of शिल्पविद्यारहस्योपनिषत् \|\| He said that he reproduced a previous publication from Mysore also in Kannada script brought out by the famous Shilpi Siddhalingaswamiji circa 1930. He is unaware of any older manuscripts.

  

Now, my question to scholars here:

a\) Has there been any academic study of the above upanishads from the traditional (that is Vaidika not Vaastu/Shilpa) point of view?

b\) Is there any information about manuscripts of शिल्पविद्यारहस्योपनिषत् \|\| ?

c\) Are there any cross references or even hints in Vyakarana, Mimamsa, Vedanta and other literature to the above texts (even if they are not recognized by the mainstream as Upanishads)

. As is known Matsyapurana lists 18 teachers of Vastu with Kaumaara being one of them. But his works are not known, except for the lone commentary cited above.

  

best regards

RN Iyengar
