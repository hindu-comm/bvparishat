shri Seshadri,  

 You can access the program by using the following link:  
  

[Easy Learn Sanskrit](http://dogratamil.com/sans/easy_prac_rev.php)  
  

I wish to tell you that this program is meant for absolute beginners. Also, I am choosing only those expressions which match up with their Hindi equivalents, except for the minor elements of grammar. The purpose is to make the user aware of Sanskrit grammar without talking of the multiple tenses, genders and persons.  
  

My search for expressions which are completely like Hindi has slowed down the speed with which I am able to add new expressions, with the result that the total number of expressions is only about 15 so far. But I am hoping to soon fill up the data with hundreds of expressions.  
  

Once this program gets going and I get some feedback, I might create another program for advanced learners.  
  

If you are a beginner, please use this program and give me your feedback, so that I might make it more user-friendly. If you already know the basics, then you might have to wait for a few days or weeks.  
  

I have taken the liberty of putting up your message and my reply on my website sat*[ishkumardogra.com](http://ishkumardogra.com)*  

  

Regards,  

Dogra
