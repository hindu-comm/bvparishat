Friends,  

 My software Easy Learn Sanskrit is nearly ready and will hopefully be up and running on one of my websites in a couple of days.  
  
This will be a very simple method by which I believe anyone who can read Devanagari will be able to learn enough Sanskrit in 3-4 months to be able to read, write and talk in Sanskrit. He (or she) will also be able to understand ancient scriptures with some help.  
  
The screen will show a couple of buttons. As you press the Next button a Hindi or English word or expression will appear. Then you press the Show button and the Sanskrit equivalent with grammatical explanations will come.

The words will appear randomly. So, a few minutes spent on the program every day will soon fill up the mind of the user with Sanskrit words and their grammatical structures to a degree that he or she will be able to understand, speak and write Sanskrit using simple sentences.

Hopefully, by Deepawali, this system would have created a large number of Sanskrit Senanis.
