David N Lorenzen's work "The Kapalikas and Kalamukhas-two lost Saivite sects" is a good reference in this regard.

  

Though the researcher is quoted to have said,

  

"“This is the first time that we have an inscription that throws light on the presence of Kapalikas in South India, and in Karnataka in particular,” said Kalaveer Manvachar, head of the Department of Epigraphy.",

  

the above mentioned book says that there are Sanskrit and old Kannada inscriptions describing some Saivaite sects in a way matching with the features of Kapalikas but not using the word Kapalikas.

  

The researcher mentions Somasiddhanta and Bhairava worship which match with Kapalika tradition (as per the information in David N Lorenzen's work).

  

As for my own interest, the name Kankala Gorava seems interesting. Gorava is a sub-caste of Kurubas (cognates of Kurumas of Telangana and Dhangars of Maharashtra. Goravas are the priestly sub-caste and officiate worship of Mallanna/ Mailara by the Kurubas. Mallanna is the folk god whose tantric /Sanskritic counterpart is found to be Bhairava. Raichur, where the inscription is found is a Kuruba-Gorava area only. But currently this community is not into books such as Somasiddhanta. They are closer to Veerashaiva maths nowadays.
