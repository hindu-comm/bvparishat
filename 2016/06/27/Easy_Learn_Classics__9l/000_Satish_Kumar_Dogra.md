Friends,  

 I have launched an effort to prepare a system of easily learning Sanskrit through the ancient scriptures. For this purpose I have prepared a template which I am going to use for capturing various chapters of Srimad Bhagwad Geeta, the Upnishads and plays and poems.  
  

This template has only two records so far --- shlokah 1 and shlokah 2 of the 2nd chapter of Srimadbhagwad Geeta. As I fill up more data in the days to come, I believe it will become a useful tool for learners of Sanskrit.  
  

Please have a look by going to the following link. You can test the program by pressing button numbered 2.

Please bring this link to the notice of the learners of Sanskrit in your contact.
