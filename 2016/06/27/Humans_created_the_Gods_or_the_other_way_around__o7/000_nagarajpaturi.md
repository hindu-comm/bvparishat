This thread is being createdfrom the thread on 'Need references for Sanskrit as a deva bhaSA' to avoid digression from the main focus of that thread.

  

Dr Yadu posted as:

  

Namaskar Scholars for an interesting thread.

  

My question to all is Who Created Gods?

  

IMHO - It is Humans who created the Gods and not the other way around.  

  

It is always a comforting taught that there is some higher power that will come to our rescue in the times are tough and we do not know where to turn to !?

Dr. Yadu asks, "My question to all is Who Created Gods?"

  

I am sure, I will be enlightened by learned members on it.

However , I have some uneasiness with the word "created" or 'creation',

There is a full war going on between "Creationist Scientists" and "Evolutionary Scientists", on use of this word with respect to "Primordial" emanation or manifestation ...

The first, i.e., Creationist Group pleads "God 'created' this all" as the Bible says and denounce Charls Darwin's evolution, the other group the opposite.

  

If we accept our *Rig Veda*,129, *NAsadiya Sukta*, we do not find "creation", it is emanation or manifestation of Him, by himself, hence*"idam sarvam Brahma"*.

Here Gods are the "Man"(using another Biblical connotation) if we accept Man to honestly represent what we mean, and also the Man is Gods, separated by *mAyA.*

*  
*

*A lot of confusion is prevailing because of the "Free" use of words without giving a second thought if it really represents what we have in mind.*

  

In the light of the above I would like to be enlightened.

\>IMHO - It is Humans who created the Gods and not the other way around.

  

The quotes do not substantiate the statement. They amount to motivating people towards purushakaara =human effort, not leaving things purely to divine help.

  

Karma theory unjustifiably maligned for being fatalistic or status-quoist. In fact, it is action-motivating and human effort motivating. To use it for fatalistic and status-quoist purposes is its misuse.

  

It is Vedic approach to treat dEvas as equals to humans and dEvas and humans as mutually nourishing.

  

देवान्भावयतानेन ते देवा भावयन्तु वः ।

परस्परं भावयन्तः श्रेयः परमवाप्स्यथ ॥ 3\\-11॥ Gita.

apaurushEyatva of the Vedas applies to apurushEyatva of dEvatAs too. So no dEvatA is man-made or man-created. Just as the Vedas are discovered , the dEvatAs which are associated with each mantra are discovered.

Dr Yadu Moharir responded as:

  

Namaste Prof Paturi,

  

Who created and promoted KRISHNA" to being the GOD?

  

Did he take a Human brith and did a Human Death?  

  

Thx
