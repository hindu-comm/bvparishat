The purport of the question was made clear byYadu Mohenir in a reply to Sunil Bhattacharya:  
  
  

Thank you Dr Bhattacharya,  

The next question is who promoted KrishNa to be the GOD/DEVATA ?  

Was he / she or a Group of Human Beings promoted / Elevated to GODHEAD / DEVATA ?

This answer is naturally must be "HUMANM's"  

My 3rd Question is specifically for Scholars of the Entire LIST  

Why most scholars / Swami's address our Deities / Devata's (created by Human's) as LORD ?  

Is this not a serious denigration of our dieties ? I have discussed this issue in last book, "GaNesha 360 : The Science of Smart Living".



Lord is title, Lord Mountbatten, Lord McKule, Lord Kurzon ........
etc. is a title given by the British monarchy to recognize the citizens for having achieved something more than ordinary.  

Hope scholars recognize fine point try to use correct titles. Why not use the specific terms created by our ancestors, such as, DEVATA, BHAGAWAN, ISHWARA if any of then desire to support preserving our cultural heritage, All the terms have a specific meaning.  
  
  
  
  

Dr Yadu  


In short his objection to the use of Lord for Krishna instead of many other epithets like bhagavan Ishwar, etc.

" Why most scholars / Swami's address our Deities / Devata's (created by Human's) as Lord (a title British Colonial rulers?)  


No one has addressed this question in particular, its propriety. And beating around the bush and the thread is not going finished anywhere in the near future.

His reasoning it was denigrated title :

" Lord is title, Lord Mountbatten, Lord McKule, Lord Kurzon ........
etc. is a title given by the British monarchy to recognize the citizens for having achieved something more than ordinary".

As per Vikipedia,

"**Lord**is an appellation for a person or[deity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deity)who has[authority](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authority), control, or[power](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(social_and_political))over others acting like a master, a chief, or a[ruler](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruler_(potentate)).^([\[1\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord#cite_note-1)[\[2\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord#cite_note-2))The appellation can also denote certain persons who hold a title of the[peerage](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peerage)in the[United Kingdom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom), or are entitled to[courtesy titles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtesy_title). The collective "Lords" can refer to a group or body of[peers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peerages_in_the_United_Kingdom)."

it is an appellation for a person or diety and not only courtesy titles and Sunil had justified as Krishna, Lord is the master or ruler of the whole world?

No one has replied to the precise question than rounding about whether Krishna is God or human being.
