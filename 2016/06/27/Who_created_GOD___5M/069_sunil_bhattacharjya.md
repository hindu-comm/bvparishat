***C) Dr. BVK Sastry- ADDITIONAL POINTS covering many posts in many threads on this forum- on Yoga-Samskrutham, Why ‘Bhagavaan’ is the right epithet for Sri Krishna, Daivee and Maanushee Vak and ‘Anvaya –Krama’ –all related in different ways to the ‘Sanskrit: Poorva-Paksha Battle.*** :

Now a few questions arise, on what you wrote. I write these below so that you can giive your considered opinion.  
  
A)  
Was the epithet Bhagavan used only for Krishna? I  
  
B)  
If not, i.e., if used to address the rishis and Munis also in the past, was that application wrong ?  
  

C)  

What do you think the etymology of the word"Bhagavan" implies ?  
  

D)  
You seem to think there is no appropriate English word to address Lord Krishna. Do you think that the English word "Lorde" was invented or coined to use only for adorning the Lords created by the Britishers ? Is that the historical position of the English language ?
