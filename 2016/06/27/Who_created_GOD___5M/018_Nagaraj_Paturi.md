Dear Prof. Misra,

  

1\. The god(s) with lower case 'g' was mentioned as dEvas and dEvatAs in the previous posts including mine.

  

2\. GOD with all upper case was brought in by Dr Moharir. Such a use was responded in two ways: Prof. Sati Sankar wanted to know how that word is defined by its user. I responded to it taking it as in quotes word, using words such as 'what you would approximate as GOD' and so on. I can not create a Sanskrit equivalent for someone else's English word , can I?
