Sir,

  

On your referral to, "Prof Paturi has already classified KRISHNA as GOD, however, has not answered the fundamental question, Did KrishNa have a HUMAN BIRTH & did he DIE A HUMAN DEATH ? AND who then PROMOTED to GOD-HEAD ?

My question has a direct bearing on the hot topic for Battle for Sanskrit and the reason, rational and under currents ofSheldon Pollock, Wendy Doninger ... etc. along with the current thinking of so called modern Indians."

  

That is why I am asking you what you mean by God? Answer is not as easy as you are referring. and I know you know the answer.

Even if we take it, what difference you see between God, God Krishna and the Krishna who died?

let me put a hint which may clarify, .. it is the same relation as you see between rasa-rasavanta and rasika.

  

So far as Pollock and orchestra band is concerned, do not bother , they are not up the point we are discussing here.

  

The moment you will give correct answer to my first question, you will get reply from yourself.

Do not curse me for this circular logic...but it is there.

Regards

SS
