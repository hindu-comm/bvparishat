Namaste

  

Just wanted to provide a 1906 -Brahmavadin Publication-Volume-10- article reference on Symbolism - which discusses this issue of Lord and Bhagavaan epithets to Jesus, Mohammed and Sri Krishna!

  

  

The Google book is available at link:

<https://books.google.com/books?id=L8caAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA672&lpg=PA672&dq=bhagavan+jesus&source=bl&ots=6EijXMAFjO&sig=tUl1yiBdOkdDwx8C2tPZZcnY1VM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyn7Of1OLNAhUGFx4KHSG2AU4Q6AEINjAI#v=onepage&q=bhagavan%20jesus&f=false>

  

Attention page - 672. Image below.

The challenge of translation goes way before our english language learning process was standardized!
