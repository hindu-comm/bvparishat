Thanks Yaduji for your crisp questions. you asked:

  
  
\<  

My present question is simple,  

  

a.  Was KrishNa born and die a Human death?

  

b. If one accepts, that if it was a HUMAN birth and DEATH, then Who promoted him to the status of Devata.?  
  

Let me also give the crisp answers to both the questions, according to my ability, as follows:  
  

a) Lord Krishna was born a human being and passed away as a human being. the famous astrologer Dr. B.V. Raman, in collaboration with the famous astronomer Fagan even found the birth year of Lord Krishna and he is traditionally known to have passed away in 3102 BCE, which is in agreement with the birth-year of Lord Krishna. Puranas treat him as a human avatara .  
  

b) Upanishada tells us that the Devaki-putra was pure in heart and could see what is in others as the same in Him. That shows that he was a Brahmajnani / Jivanmukta. Lord Krishna told Arjuna that he could give the Gitopadesha to Arjuna), in the yugayukta state and not otherwise. That shows that he was the same as the Brahman when he was in the yogayukta state. Vedavyasa in the Bhagavata Purana and Parashara in the Vishnu purana tell us of Lord Krishna's divinity, besides several other ancient texts telling us the same. Such thinga are sufficient to convince ordinary people like me to believe in the divineness of Lord Krishna. This may not necessarily be supported by the non-believers and we have no quarrel with the non-believers.
