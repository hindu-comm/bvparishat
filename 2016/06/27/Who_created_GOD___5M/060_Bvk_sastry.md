Namaste

  

  

On This part of the post, \< **One must keep faith and science in two different compartments in one's mind and not mingle them**\>

- This is advocacy of the ' Split Head and Heart:: Buddhi and Bhaavanaa:: Jnana- Vijnana-Partitioning'- syndrome.

  

- The battle for Sanskrit can not be decisively enforced in this mind-set. I place belowBhagavad-Gita:2-66: for contemplation:

  

nasti buddhir ayuktasya

na cayuktasya bhavana

na cabhavayatah santir

asantasya kutah sukham.

  

I would not elaborate to venture more to create ' buddhi- bheda' on what one is practically comfortable.

  

My view: This battle needs the badly missing ' jnanam- vijnana sahitam' pedagogy : Bhagavad-Gita9-1:

śrī-bhagavān uvāca

idaḿ tu te guhya-tamaḿ

pravakṣyāmy anasūyave

jñānaḿ vijñāna-sahitaḿ

**yaj jñātvā mokṣyase ’śubhāt**

  

  

A Unified approach to study Samskutham as Yoga of Jnana and Vijnana: Science useful for up- liftment of Spirit and Society .

  

This is wickedly messed for over three hundred years by Active Orientalist scholarship of ' Sanskrit: Daivee vaak treated as downgraded ' maanushee vaak' and tolerated by passive pessimistic native ' Pandit' scholarship.
