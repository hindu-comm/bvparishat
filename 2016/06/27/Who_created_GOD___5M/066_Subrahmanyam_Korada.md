नमो विद्वद्भ्यः.

  

**Was he born is human being a (MORTAL) being and die a MORTAL Death, --  
**

  

That is right - actually the answers are already in my post -

  

Krsna was born as a human being , but a superior one , because he had had अष्टैश्वर्यs and the qualities of a भगवान् , and just like any other human being had a death.

But one has to remember one important thing -

  

Krsna had had his birth and death under his control - being ईश्वर (ब्रह्मन्) who took the form of a human being .

Therefore his death is not generally called ' death ' but closing his अवतार ।

  

धन्यो’स्मि
