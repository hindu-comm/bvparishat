Multiple choice answer for this is:

  

\(a\) Krishna was born as as a human and died a human death. A human promoted him to the status of GOD.

  

\(b\) Krishna was not born as a human. Did not die a human death. A human described him as GOD.

  

\(c\) Krishna was born as a human and died a human death. One who described promoted him to the status of GOD was not a human.

  

(d) Krishna was not born as a human. Did not die a human death. One who described promoted him to the status of GOD was not a human.

  

\(a\) seems to be satisfying for Dr. Moharir.

  

For others to selectone of the remaining , the word GOD not being from theKrishna related tradition is a big hurdle.
