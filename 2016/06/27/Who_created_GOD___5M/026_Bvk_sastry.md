Namaste Professor Korada ji

  

1\. You are the first scholar who has taken the courage to say that there is a serious issue in working with the ' rough translation'- the clear distinction between ' Samskrutha(- refined) and prak-krutha-loka vyavahara'.

2\. You are the first scholar here to have pointed to the seriousness of ' God/ debate' in the ' Sanatana Dharma' frame work; which truly is the technicality of ' Brahma jijnyasa' different from ' deva- Poojaa vidhi' in ' Aalaya-aagama frame of veda- practiced in society.

I hope to see how other scholars jump on this bold yet accurate position of tradition in a crisp way.
