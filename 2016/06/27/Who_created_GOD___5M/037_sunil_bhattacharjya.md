Dear Yaduji,  
  

I call Lord Krishna as Lord as I consider him as the Lord and Master and that is certainly not in the titular sense. There is paradigm difference between the Lordship of Lord Krishna to me than any Lordship conferred by the British queen upon some of her subjects. Equating the titular lords with the divine Lord krishna is a denigration of lord Krishna and that surely hurts people like me,  
  

Secondly the gods (not with capital G) are beings considered superior to the human beings by virtue of their possessing higher powers, yet we the human beings are at an advantageous position, which even the gods are believed to be envious of, for several reasons.Iqbal believed the gods in the Hindu religion to be like the angels in the semitic religions, and he seems to be not far from right.  
  

Regards,
