Namaste

The above is a pertinent question. 'God' has two aspects. One is the transcendental Truth denoted by the names Sat, BhUman, Turiya, Brahman, etc. It has no form whatsoever. That Existence cannot be created or destroyed by anyone. Asambhavastu sato anupaoatteh says the Brahmasutra. Na abhaavo vidyate satah says the Gita.

This Truth is realized only through a path that requires giving forms to it initially. These forms are certainly created. By whom? By the scriptures and persons involved in them.

To understand the above phenomenon we can consider an example. The entity Krishna is One only. But It can be imagined in infinite ways by the bhaktas. That is why there is no one book that sets the limit to the ways. The Azhwars and Haridasas and host of others like Lilashuka, Tulasidas, gave a lot of creative forms and Lilas of that one Entity. So with Rama, Shiva, Ganapati, Subrahmanya, Devi, etc.

Thus the ultimate Truth cannot be created while the representations of that Truth are happily within creation by the human mind.
