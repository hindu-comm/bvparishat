For one term 'God' in the Hebraic systems, Vedic traditions have several terms, *Brahman, Bhagwan, Paramatma, Prabhu, Ishwar, Param Tatva, Param Shiva* - and they are not synonymous.

 The question 'who created X' does not spring from an inwardness with Indian modes of thought. The Buddhists cahracterised even the question 'Does *Paramatma/Atma* exist?' as '**ati-prasna**', an important conceptual category. Panini's grammar lists 27 philosophical systems of which only ONE accepts the category of a supremos being.

 What are the answers - they are embedded in the 1500 year long confrontational-collaborative debate between the three *sampradayas* - Brahman (also known as Vaiyyakaranans, Vedantins), Bauddha, Jaina.

  

My regards to all
