Thank you Yaduji for your comment :  
  
\<Who am I to stop you for using the incorrect terminologyY  
  

Aapkaa soch aapko mubarak. I too can say that you wrongly think that the bhava or spirit in using a word as unimportant. Who am I to stop you from thinking the word "Lord" to be derogatory when used in case of
Lord Krishna and Lord Buddha.  
  

So let us agree to disagree.  
  

Regards,  

SKB
