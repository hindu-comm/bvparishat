Namaste Bijoy ji

  

On your note \<Why fall in the trap?We don't need to clean all the rubbish in the world!> and Paturi hi's note \<Dr Moharir says, there is Battle for Sanskrit, Pollock and so on behind all his enquiry. Let us wait to see how.> if we can not address and answer one word - translation challenge here, how will the dialogue proceed when ' **sarva-deva-namaskaarah, keshavam pratigacchati'** needs an explanation?

Do we expect a rehash of the equation-\< **ishwara alla tero naam, sab ko sanmati de bhagawaan**\>?! Or ' avatAr concept of Gita to step in to Abrahamic theological corridors, leading to dharma- yuddha or Jihad ?

  

Both vedic and Abrahamic schools are primarily theistic and spiritual. But their scriptural and social models of practice on ' Deva/ GOD/ god' is mutually destructive, incompatible and incompatible. The history of linguistic debate has serious social implications.

  I was under the mistaken impression that Rajiv Malhotra's pressing for Sanskrit: Poorva-Paksha/ Sheldon Pollock, was a given understanding and integral part of this continuing dialogue. There is no wishing away of the issue here , at this time, by using a honey- combing by subject line of discussion.

  
Welcome Bijoy ji, to your interjecting post on ' Deva-Bhaashaa' word- meaning debate going hotter. Your response post touches a raw nerve of debate, which traditional Sanskrit teams seem to have lost sight of, for several generations to address and bring in a course correction.

  

   Thank you for bringing in the dimension of ' non- translatable' part of Words in Samskrutham, which is one of the primary issues to be addressed in Sanskrit: Poorva-Paksha. The roots of this debate touches the basics of translation and communication of a sentence/ document from a source language(- say Sanskrit) in to a target language(- say English). All of us here concur that this is an important issue in this global battle impacting trends of Sanskrit future studies and control.
Therefore a little longer pre-amble for the post is unavoidable, before articulating the question.

  

***Here is the pre-amble:***

Your post carries an issue where the linguist (= grammarian + lexicographer combination ) needs to address ' technical correctness (- pramANa) of word usage (- shabda-prayoga / pada- prayoga) for proper communication and translation of speakers intention (- vivakShitArtha vachana).

  

It is expected that linguist ( bhAshA- shAstrajna) facilitates a speaker (vaktA/ kavi- the bard and poet) in word usage. The grammarian is not expected to be a shop-keeper supplying words on demand or function as an umpire of the game or sit in judgement post- haste usage.

  

This is the logic used by historians to filter social stratas of Sanskrit language usage, using text passages and rules from Panini and Patanjali. The illustration is made by comparing a Sankrit grammarian to be a ' pot- maker ( kumBha-KAra). This precisely is the
analogy-used by oriental schools modeling ' what was Sanskrit historically and its social usage and implications' . This modeling is one of the root-errors in building a wrong history of Sanskrit-and leading to current battle ground situation of Sanskrit: Poorva-Paksha. This root- error has a three hundred year old legacy, groomed and guarded by the ivy- league combines of Sanskrit studies starting from Oxford, spreading out through Harvard and flowering at Colubia and Chicago, where Professor Pollock is the seed in the fruit for next generation Sanskrit-garden grooming .

  

***Here is the question-request***:

  

In the light of discussion that has gone so far involving the word ' deva (देव) and derivatives around it (like daivI, devataa:: दैवी देवता) i request yourself and Paturi ji and all learned, is the following. Can you please help and come out with a recommended Translation, which would be ' Technically Accurate (shAstra-PramANa) and Validated by Social usage - history (loka-vyavahAra/ Translators usage and lexicographers listings, ) with some contemplation on the Social implications of such a recommended translation ?

  

**The select Sentences floating in society ( vyavahara) are the following:**

  

A\) idaM shree- Krishna- janma-SthAnaM - tat srI rAma- janma bhoomiH. ) (**इदं श्रीकृष्णजन्मस्थानम् । तत् श्री राम जन्मभूमि:**).**Point to address**: This is birth- place of Sri- Krishna. That is shree Ramas birth place.

  

Is this sentence usage to be aligned to historic human birth model by belief and ' as we know, to be the only way and locale)' OR ' we attribute and recognize this as a place shown to us by our ancestors , where a ' GOD' came amongst us in a non- human- transcendent mysterious mode of birth? Virgin or otherwise? An exceptional case?

  

B\) eko devaH, keshavo vA shivo vA

(**एको देव: केशवो वा शिवो वा** ).**Point to address:**what is the filtering line of One GOD - Many Gods from ONE GOD, unless one gets committed to a theology and philosophy, even before the dialogue begins? If the listening (other )side is already committed to this view, the dialogue is talking to the ' already committed team'! Otherwise, it is a personal endorsement: i believe so, because this is the only way i was taught and my tradition believes. This is a closed approach where handshake is expected with fisted hands?!

  

C\) astyuttarasyAM dishi DevatAtmA himAlayo nAma nagAdhirAjaH

(**अस्त्युत्तरस्यां दिशि देवतात्मा हिमालयो नाम नगाधिराज:**).**Point to address :**what****is deva- devataa- devatAtmA applied to a king of mountains? How is this different from other Deva's?

**  
**

D\) atra shree-Krishna- devAlayaH asti. Tara RAma-devAlayaH asti

( **अत्र श्रीकृष्ण देवालय: अस्ति। तत्र रामदेवालय: अस्ति**).**Point to address:**what is the simple socially relevant usage - translation of this sentence? How does one explain vedic tradition Deva concept in an Abrahamic theological backdrop and language? This is a reality which is contextually relevant and challenge of translator, for which the ivy league of Sanskrit studies stakes its authority for over three centuries, with dictionaries, translations and socially relevant historic research with national cultural identity implications?

**  
**

E\) shree KrishnArpanamastu

**(श्री कृष्णार्पणमस्तु **). I dont how to propose a translation for this. The feeling is immense.

**Point to address:**  

If we have no theologically matching or mapping between the groups on either side of the Sanskrit: Poorva-Paksha, should the dialogue be
a**defend -approach** through an internal audit process amongst the traditional scholars of Sanskrit and to pool-together data for audit ?

Or

should the work be to provide and educate the traditional scholars with data for**attack -battle-fight- pulverize**approach using the writings of Rajiv Malhotra?

\- for which work many traditional scholars need greater ' training and prior preparation in the war- games of western philology'? And linguistics? ( in the assessment of Rajiv Malhotra on battle state preparedness? Of home-team).

  

   Would this not need the theological understanding of ' god' in three streams of religions from one book , using classical languages like Greek, Latin, Aramaic, Hebrew along with several dialects, providing shades of theology shrouded with confounding translations and yielding century wise- church wise translations of ' Gods language in a scripture, where dialogue was between a representative of a historical chosen person and Personal god , in privacy of cave'.

  

  Unless, the current defenders of Sanskrit a priori accept the position: Sanskrit is a historical social human language , of the same genus and class like Greek and Latin;***BUT***

We have a greater antiquity and firmer rule base and indomitable faith and energy to defend this position.

**In which case, it is an ' in- house talk of the faithful to the faithful'. And defeat of dialogue : Samskruthan nAma Daivee Vak संस्कृतं नाम दैवी वाक्)**

**  
**

**Do we intend to go by this lane?**
