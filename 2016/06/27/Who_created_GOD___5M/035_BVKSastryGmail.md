Namaste Bijoy ji



1. Thanks for specific pointing on where \< Pollock and company fail royally!  \>



2. And by extension, the company’s failures royally continues in
their handling of \< Ramayana Translation and Veda-Translation and research, Treating it as ‘Kavya’ of an earlier period than Ramayana>.



3. And ‘Tolerant – Unopposed - Endorsements and Open- Acceptance Promotion of the above failures by Some Traditional Schools in ‘re-imaging the wild-imagination and re-constructing the Future trends of Sanskrit studies in India’ also continues equally royally !



This entire scenario of Sanskrit studies in the last three hundred years needs critical addressing in “ Sanskrit: Poorva-Paksha” using the standards of language set by Panini-Patanjali and Yaska. And surely Bhartruhari, Abhinavagupta, Ananda vardhana, Bhoja .. every one comes in section by section in this review ; including Yudhisthira Meemaamsaka till Pollock.



Are we morally and mentally ready for this self-review and audit undertaking ?



Regards



BVK Sastry
