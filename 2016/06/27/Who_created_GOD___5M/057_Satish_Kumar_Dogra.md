Sunil Ji, thanks for making your position clear. Hinduism does not make it obligatory to believe or not believe in avatar. This is the only religion that permits even atheism or agnosticism. What is more important in Hinduism is the quality of one's karma. Srimad Bhagwad Geeta is full of this concept. I go by the Geeta and believe in it as the word of God.  
  

Does that mean I consider Lord Krishna to be God? Yes, when I am in a temple. No, when I am sitting and talking to group of scientists and rationalists.  
  

I think we should learn to compartmentalise our lives. We should not allow scientific doubts to poke holes into our beliefs when we sit in a temple in front of a deity, and we should not allow religion hamper exploration of scientific truths.
