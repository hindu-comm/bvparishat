Namaste



This seems to provide answers to the specific points raised by Dr. Yadu. Thanks to Professor Korada for the focused answers. I am marking the sections of the post, so that one can see clearly the additional points that may just get missed out in this important post, having relevance for questions: Why Battle for Sanskrit? And Why ‘Anvaya-Mukha standard to study Samskrutham and validate translations’.




A) The RED –Bold and Highlighted in part (A) below is the answer to the question.

B) The BLUE –Bold and Highlighted in part (B) below is the Defense of Faith and Tradition.

C) Also see My Additional Points below, covering many points spread across several threads of discussion:



****

***A) Dr. Yadu’s Question - (A) Was he born as human being a (MORTAL) being and die a MORTAL Death, -- (**Read RED** )*****



That is right - actually the answers are already in my post - **Krsna was born as a human being** ( but a superior one , because he had had
अष्टैश्वर्यs and the qualities of a भगवान् , ) **and just like any other human being had a death**. ( But one has to remember one important thing - Krsna had had his birth and death under his control - being ईश्वर (ब्रह्मन्) who took the form of a human being . Therefore his death is not generally called ' death ' but closing his अवतार ।)



***B) Dr. Yadu’s Question - B) Was he born is human being a (MORTAL) being and die a MORTAL Death, -- **(Read BLUE)*****



That is right - actually the answers are already in my post - Krsna was born as a human being ,(** but a superior one , because he had had
अष्टैश्वर्यs and the qualities of a भगवान् )** and just like any other human being had a death.**(But one has to remember one important thing - Krsna had had his birth and death under his control - being ईश्वर (ब्रह्मन्) who took the form of a human being .

***C) Dr. BVK Sastry- ADDITIONAL POINTS covering many posts in many threads on this forum- on Yoga-Samskrutham, Why ‘Bhagavaan’ is the right epithet for Sri Krishna, Daivee and Maanushee Vak and ‘Anvaya –Krama’ –all related in different ways to the ‘Sanskrit: Poorva-Paksha Battle.*** :



i) Part (B) also provides a logical construction to elevate, or more properly position ‘Supreme Divine’ - Parama Purusha - Para Brahma - Param Dhama – Yogeswara’ in understanding the humans progress in
history through the process –practice of Yoga .



ii) This is anchoring the language of ‘Yoga-Anushaasanam’ as
Samskrutham, used on the historic war field of Kuru-Kshetra to address a Dharma issue, ever since a historic epoch of 3100 BCE, a continuing standard used by traditional scholars. This language of Yoga, Samskrutham was the choice of ‘Bhagavan Sri Krishna for the discourse on What is Sanatana Dharma and Why of Yoga Practice’. This standard of Yoga-Validation is what Mallinatha endorses in ‘anvaya-mukha vyakhyana’ system and standard to understand Sanskrit literature. And this is the ‘Linguistic Fair Play and standards demand’, unilaterally and blatantly
violated in post 1700 period by colonial and oriental scholars and FAILED in translations, Public intellectual discourse on Hinduism, Sanskrit studies, Construction of History and Socio-political implications using the terminology of ‘ Caste-Curry and Cow’. And the sad part of this, the ‘ weak voice of scholars of Samskruth Tradition’.
Net result: One more ‘Battle for Sanskrit, the language of Dharma and Yoga, where the pitch provided on a global platform and the warriors are identified by media as ‘ Manu-Vadi’s and ‘Social elite, seeking justice for historical fault lines’. This is the resistance in ‘Bharath, the land where Bhagavad-Gita is a sacred text of Yoga-discourse and directive in Samskrutham. 



iii) Srimad-Bhagavad-Gita provides the directive to study and understand Samskrutham following the guidance provided for ‘ Yoga-Practice’. ( and not start with the ‘Top-Down’ approach starting with translation based conclusions on What is Yoga-Philosophy and Meditation practices provided in theological schools, guru brands, wiki-web pages and colorfully illustrated scientific graphs and
statistical imagery in works of translation. One does not climb a mountain from the Peak ! One climbs up to the peak (Vedas) through the ladder of ‘ Prayer- Literature’ and progressing on the path of Yoga-Practice to ‘Vision’ the Sky from the ‘Peak of Mountain’, **where
the ‘Study of Vedas’ and ‘Yoga-Practice’ should start at the bottom referential line respecting the LANGUAGE of Yoga and VEDAS**.



And the metaphoric theologically significant and socially well understood word in X-ian schools for this process is: ‘ Ascension’- a progressive climbing from the bottom to the Top. It is opposite of the ‘ Humpty Dumpty Tumble Down ! (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humpty_Dumpty> ) approach followed in many colonial and oriental schools where ‘Conclusions built using FAILED translations are used to define the Base, Basics and Processes of the System of Veda, Yoga and Sanskrit Literature. The limited context of introducing the word ‘Ascension’ as a theological concept, here is to highlight the point on how where the ‘Study of Vedas’ and
‘Yoga-Practice’ should have started, right at the bottom referential line, respecting the LANGUAGE of Yoga and VEDAS**. i.e. Learn to respect the Language before leaping on largesse of Philosophical and theological discourses**. Rest of the theology is non-consequential.



 *What is Ascension ? – in X-ian schools and Why is it presented as a ‘Social Memory and Practice of Scripture to groom Global Brand Religiosity and Theological faith through Prayer Congregation model and State support as a part of Global Social Dynamics ’? Why should Ascension be a raise from bottom of mountain to the peak, to progress further and beyond ? *

***Ascension Day is officially celebrated on a Thursday on the 40th day of Easter**, or 39 days after Easter Sunday. Some churches in the United States join forces to celebrate a combined Day of Prayer and Ascension Day service, which may include a time for reflection. A few churches also organize a "church crawl", where people travel from one church to another and experience the different prayer events. **Ascension Day is one of the earliest Christian festivals dating back to the year 68 CE**. According to the New Testament in the Bible, Jesus Christ met several times with his disciples during the 40 days after his resurrection to instruct them on how to carry out his teachings**. It is believed that on the 40th day he took them to the Mount of Olives, where they watched as he ascended to heaven. Ascension Day celebrations include processions symbolizing Christ’s entry into heaven** and, in some countries, chasing a “devil” through the streets and dunking it in a pond or burning it in effigy – symbolic of the Messiah’s triumph over the devil **when he opened the kingdom of heaven to all believers**. The liturgical color in many churches is white on Ascension Day. Symbols include the ascending Christ, birds flying homeward, open gates, a lion conquering a dragon, Elijah's fiery chariot and a broken chain. .. Ascension, is explained in Christian belief, the ascent of Jesus Christ into heaven on the 40th day after his Resurrection (Easter being reckoned as the first day). According to the first chapter of The Acts of the Apostles, after appearing to the Apostles on various occasions during a period of 40 days, Jesus was taken up in their presence and was then hidden from them by a cloud, a frequent biblical image signifying the presence of God. *



iv) Yoga practice and guidance is not a market enterprise like a Hollywood Blockbuster production process, to rake in bottom-line-figures and have self-pampering, self-comforting laurels) or a TV panel debate for securing viewer-hit-ratings. The purpose of Yoga-Samskrutham is Self- discovery and Personal-Experience the ‘ Deva/ Vaasudeva Sri Krishna ’ in each and every ‘Jeeva’; a way to do ‘Good for world ( = Loka Samgraha), as a Duty. Yoga is an investment of One’s own time and energy ( and resources) for Self-Refinement and Culturing.



v) Samskrutham – The sacred Spiritual Language of Yoga is the
‘Yoga Directive to transform the Human Language Process and expression ( maanushee Vak)’ to get refined-elevated to the level of ‘Daivee –Vaak’; It is a Personalized Yoga training for making
-‘Satya-Vak’: A refined, cultured, unified, True and Total expression of Truth, said Truly and Totally. This Yoga-Directive is an
elaboration over Arjuna’s question in Gita 10-17: kathaM vidyAM
ahaM yogin, tvAM sadA paricintayan , keshu keshu ca bhAveshu
cintyo’si **bhagavan,** mayA, - An integrally connected directive providing the way to implement the directive ‘Tasmat Yogi Bhava’ ( Gita:6-46). 



vi) Here, We also have the answer to the question ‘Why we call Sri Krishna as ‘bhagavan’ and not ‘Lord’ ! which connects to the story in Durrant's book on India apparently recorded by Pliny,

Extract from an earlier post of Dr.Bijoy Misra \< Aristotle had engineered Alexander to find out what did Indians think about "How does a man become God?" This was the last of the ten questions that were canned. Alexander got hold of a few naked sadhus and threatened them of beheading if they won't answer properly. After nine questions, the above was the last. After a night's rest, the sadhu confidently replied: "A man becomes God when he can do impossible tasks. However, when one does impossible tasks, they become possible!" History tells us that Alexander did not reach back to report the answer to Aristotle. \>

**Was he born is human being a (MORTAL) being and die a MORTAL Death, --**



That is right - actually the answers are already in my post -



Krsna was born as a human being , but a superior one , because he had had अष्टैश्वर्यs and the qualities of a भगवान् , and just like any other human being had a death.

But one has to remember one important thing -



Krsna had had his birth and death under his control - being ईश्वर (ब्रह्मन्) who took the form of a human being .

Therefore his death is not generally called ' death ' but closing his अवतार ।



धन्यो’स्मि
