Thank you Dr Bhattacharya,

  

The next question is who promoted KrishNa to be the GOD/DEVATA ?

  

Was he / she or a Group of Human Beings promoted / Elevated to GODHEAD / DEVATA ?  

This answer is naturally must be "HUMANM's"

  

My 3rd Question is specifically for Scholars of the Entire LIST

  

Why most scholars / Swami's address our Deities / Devata's (created by Human's) as LORD ?

  

Is this not a serious denigration of our dieties ? I have discussed this issue in last book, "GaNesha 360 : The Science of Smart Living".

  

Lord is title, Lord Mountbatten, Lord McKule, Lord Kurzon ........
etc. is a title given by the British monarchy to recognize the citizens for having achieved something more than ordinary.

  

Hope scholars recognize fine point try to use correct titles. Why not use the specific terms created by our ancestors, such as, DEVATA, BHAGAWAN, ISHWARA if any of then desire to support preserving our cultural heritage, All the terms have a specific meaning.  

  

  

Thx

  

Dr Yadu
