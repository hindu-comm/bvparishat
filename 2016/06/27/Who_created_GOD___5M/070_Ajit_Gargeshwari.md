We should be only discussing the word GOD on this thread. We are not discussing the word Lord in the sense of adhipati or Bhagavan as mode of respectful salutation. Many aspects of GOD has already been discussed in this thread. If scholars have anything new to add please reply. Sunilji if you want to address Krishna as God Krishna or Lord Krishna or Bhagavan Krishna please do so. Dr Yadu was not asking how should Krishna be addressed?

Was Krishna born as mortal the question has also been answered.

Now a few questions arise, on what you wrote. I write these below so that you can giive your considered opinion.  
  
A)  
Was the epithet Bhagavan used only for Krishna? I  
  
B)  
If not, i.e., if used to address the rishis and Munis also in the past, was that application wrong ?

C)

What do you think the etymology of the word"Bhagavan" implies ?

D)  
You seem to think there is no appropriate English word to address Lord Krishna. Do you think that the English word "Lorde" was invented or coined to use only for adorning the Lords created by the Britishers ? Is that the historical position of the English language ?

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
