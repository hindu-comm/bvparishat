Dear Sastryji,

  

*Are we morally and mentally ready for this self-review and audit undertaking ?*  

*

I don't think** we have a choice than**assuming the task. I grew up in immediate post-independence

India and the cultural discovery was more for survival than exploration. An element of jingoism was

injected possibly through the remnants of the call for freedom. 
India's discovery that man is naturally

born free was not appreciated by me until pretty late in life. The question then can be how Indian scholars

managedto arrive at this conclusion, which is just the only analytic truth which is cosmological.

Then what isthe separation of the life lived and the design of the life to be lived. This inquiry gets tough and

variouscompromising theories are proposed.  India has to continue to create scholars and create an

intellectualplatform where the question can be openly debated without intimidation. Through the process

newdiscoveries would emerge, new universes would be discovered.

  

Would India be up to it? The answer is "yes". But we have to create open-minded students. That would

need many dedicated scholar teachers who could help open the students' creativity than drill them in

specific skills. I think the Indian society appreciates the exploration of ideas, but gets scared of the

survival and sustenance. Some also become reactive as a remnant of the protests to gain political freedom. 

As I observe sitting in this little study several thousand miles away,I visualize scholars vigorously debating

the empirical observations with respect and analysis and trying to solve difficult riddles. Indian contributions

are not physical experimentation to compound objects, but to discover the origin of the object.

  

Long time ago, Indian scholars discovered to look beyond the color of the skin or the physicality of the

matter. It was possibly a slow discovery. The discovery led to the surge of creativity that we observe in

art, music, dance, literature and sculpture. The society accepted the larger goal in life. Though scuttled,

the urge to be original might be a pure Indian trait. Let everyone be allowed to think independently

without artificial restrictions. It might need an economic model where everybody is secure infood and

shelter. While the politicians (the rulers) may work to bring stability, the scholars must engage themselves

in undertaking larger tasks which would let them discover their own originality and their own functioning.

The world would wait to learn such discoveries.

  

Best regards,

BM
