There is a story in Durrant's book on India apparently recorded by Pliny.  

Aristotle had engineered Alexander to find out what did Indians think about "How does a man become God?"  

This was the last of the ten questions that were canned.  

Alexander got hold of a few naked sadhus and threatened them of beheading if they won't answer properly.  

After nine questions, the above was the last. After a night's rest, the sadhu confidently replied  

"A man becomes God when he can do impossible tasks. However, when one does impossible tasks, they become possible!"  
  

History tells us that Alexander did not reach back to report the answer to Aristotle.  
  

Durrant writes with more humor.
