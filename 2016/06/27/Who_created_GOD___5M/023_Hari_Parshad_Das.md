The term "God" in English can refer to "any supernatural being". This concept is different from the term "bhagavAn" in Sanskrit.  
  
If you are asking about Who promoted Krishna to be bhagavAn, the answer is that he is eternally the Supreme Lord. This is confirmed in the Gopāla-tāpanī as follows,  
  
tasmāt kṛṣṇa eva paro devas taṁ dhyāyet  
taṁ raset taṁ bhajet taṁ yajet  
eko vaśī sarvagaḥ kṛṣṇa īḍya  
ekopi san bahudhā yo vibhāti  
taṁ pīṭhastham ye tu bhajanti dhīrās  
teṣām sukhaṁ śāśvataṁ netareṣam  
  
"Thus, Śrī Kṛṣṇa alone is the Supreme controller. Meditate on him, glorify loudly his name, serve him and worship only him. Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the all-pervasive, omnipresent Being who brings everyone under his sway— he alone is worthy of everyone’s worship. Although he is one, yet he manifests and expands himself in countless forms like Matsya, Kūrma, Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Kāraṇodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu and so on. Equipoised and saintly devotees who worship the transcendental mūrti of Krishna, are alone eligible to attain eternal bliss. Others who are not devotees (of Krishna or any of his forms) are not fit to experience this unlimited transcendental bliss."  
  
Krishna's bhagavAn-ness is not acquired from another source. It is eternal and a feature of his very existence.

The answer is no. Even while he was present on the planet, he was recognized by the wise as the Supreme:  
  
gūḍhaṁ paraṁ brahma manuṣya-liṅgam (Srimad Bhagavatam 7.10.48)  
  
Also elsewhere it is stated,  
  
kṛṣir bhū-vācakaḥ śabdo ṇaś ca nirvṛti-vācakaḥ  
tayor aikyaṁ paraṁ brahma kṛṣṇa ity abhidhīyate  
  
In my reply I have taken help only of śabda-pramāṇa because other pramāṇas are inconclusive when it comes to determining who is god/bhagavAn. The Brahma-sūtra (2.1.11) says — tarkāpratiṣṭhānāt — logic is inconclusive.  
  
sādhu-caraṇa-rajo 'bhilāṣī,  
  
hari parshad das.
