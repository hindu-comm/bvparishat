Ajit Gangeshwari Ji,  

 Your tone of writing shows that something in my post hurt you. I am sorry if you didn't like my style of putting across my ideas.  
  

My purpose was not to 'preach', but just to express my views. I believe that in today's world of science one gets divided between rationality and senses-based empiricism on the one hand and the intense need for belief in an over-all power on the other. This, to my mind, requires a kind of compartmentalisation where you have to keep faith and rationality in two different boxes and use them as your guides according to the needs and the exigencies of the situation.  
  

Perhaps you find this artificial. But it works for me. That is why I sometimes present this to others as one way of handling the dilemmas of the modern world. My intention is not to 'preach', but just to express one point-of-view.  
  

I have no intention of sounding big and scholarly on this Forum where my reading of messages from scholars often humbles me by making me conscious of my ignorance.  
  

Regards,  

Dogra
