**[Subrahmanyam Korada]()** 4-July-2016 in [भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्]() : My present question is simple,

**a**. Was KrishNa born and die a Human death?

**b**. If one accepts, that if it was a HUMAN birth and DEATH, then Who promoted him to the status of Devata?



**Ram L. P.[Vimal]()**: **a**. Yes.

**b**. Most probably the author of Gīta/Mahābhārat: Sage Vyāsa. This is because KrishNa attained the Samādhi state and then promoted yoga, such as karma and gyan yoga and also prem-yoga (as between Radha-KrishNa). God/Devatā is simply the name of Samādhi state. In other words, if anybody attains this state; s/he will also be consideredGod/Devatā.
