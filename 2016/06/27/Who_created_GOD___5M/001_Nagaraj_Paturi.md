\>Who created and promoted KRISHNA" to being the GOD?

  

\> Did he take a Human birth AND die a Human Death?

  

------- I do not know any Krishna who is not 'GOD'either in Mahabharata or Srimadbhagavata or Harivamshapurana or any other such related work. Krishna in each of these works is always a divya prakriti ((divine character).

  

In all these works, he is depicted as a the Avataara of Sri Maha Vishnu.

  

Author(s) of these works created that character that way and there is no
narrative element of 'promoting' that character to being the GOD from any stage of not being the GOD in any of these works because that character not being the GOD is not there in any of these works.

  

In all these works , he is depicted as leelaamaanushavigraha. Nevertheless, his birth has many characteristics of a 'divine birth'. His death has been depicted tolooklike an accidental human death in the works in which it finds mention or depiction.
