Namaste

  

I highlight the specific points in the response below, which makes this dialogue to be\< talking to the already faithful community?>

  

The statement made in your post reads : 'Author(s) of these works*created that character*that way'. This makes Sri Krishna to be a Character Created by a Creative Composition Writer: whether it is a faith continuation or recollection or a new- correction for a old historic fact as a process of deification, does not change the primary issue. The ' God-Head' in a ' Character' becomes Historic-Faith debate with a human societal starting point.

  

This is not new or special to Hindus! Buddhists project Bodhisattvas who go to time- space domain associated with huge numeric value and beyond human plane! Whether a historicBuddha was 700 BCE or 15,000 BCE, the ' Bodhisattva genesis' and ' Godly nature - connection' does not change. I.e . The given Faith has a historic birth point in a human context. ' leelaa' is later explanation. Masnusha is the ground reality. Vigraha( iconic model of Divya purusha - parama purusha for faith group practices) is a later artifact (- vaasudeva as vigraha for archaa).

  

Jains have a similar sacred history where physical historical reality of Mahaveer Jain gets fazed in to the faith- God belief presentation.

  

We have many live yogis and siddhars raised to Godhead level, expanding the pantheon(- club of Gods).

  

In our current period, separated by history, and buffeted by \< depicted>

and \< given- accepted - not questioned> status , the current debate is a repeat of old statement scenario \< kapilo yadi sarvajnah , sugato neti kaa pramaa. Taavubhau yadi sarvajnau, matabhedah katham tayoh \>. The softened explanation is \< while we accept One Divine having many expressions ( Viswa-Roopa>, we prefer one form and one book and one Acharya as Highest among the best . This is the root of this \<shraddhaa-jaadya-debate, anchored to neo-adhyatma and ways to please social contextual audience adorations.

  

In lighter vein, imagine how would a generation which grew up with magical movies of Vittalacharya (paataala mohini) , appreciating all the magic effects songs ideals will sell it to a different culture context growing up with Harry potter visuals and Superman feats?! And imagine another ten years down the lane, how would you explain Vittalacharya movies to a generation which grows with online cyber- games , taking ' internet' as given granted condition.

  

  

This is the point when you respond as \<I do not know any Krishna who is not 'GOD'either*in*Mahabharata or Srimadbhagavata or Harivamshapurana or any other such related work. Krishna*in each of these works*is always a divya prakriti ((divine character). \>.

  

In this line of response mode, You are looking at your audience to be comfortable, accepting and promoting what you ate comfortable with. This is where Sheldon Pollock or Zakaria coming from outside the \< groove of vedic tradition> question the basics. Their question,

Is NOT about your belief or about some Rishi creating a character in historic time period and a community having a continuity of that ' imagination imaged in worship'.

  

In fact Abrahamic religions have much more complexities in explaining their concept of ' God-God men/ women - Scriptures'!

They are looking for answers to their questions in a different tradition, older than their native inheritance passed on in downgraded social languages and lost in translations and practices.

  

When They ask the question, and our answers are no different in quality than what they already have, how does Hinduism differ from any other religion in world? The size and shape of dogs may be different; but the ' Dog- jaati-Guna-Swabhava-pedigree- history and social implication' does not change! (shuni chaiva shvapaake cha panditaah / paanaraah sama-darshinah?!)

  

Addressing this is the challenge before the ' Sanskrit: Poorvapaksha'. Failing which all scholarly quotes from ancient works suffer the same defect of ' Self asserted -Self invoked authority' (Swatah pramanam - paratah pramanam). The approach to answer here for this question to meet personal saadhanaa needs is different from meeting the requirements of an answer in a public debate. Tarka is for public. Shraddhaa is for saadhanaa.
