This sentence “Does that mean I consider Lord Krishna to be God? Yes, when I am in a temple. No, when I am sitting and talking to group of scientists and rationalists” does not make sense to me



Either you should consider Sri Krishna as God or you should not. How can you consider X as Y sometimes and X as Z at other times?



Thank you for your preaching’s Why do you consider religion hampers science or science hampers religion?



Does Hinduism stand for a belief system needs to be answered that besides the point. It really depends on the context you use the word Hinduism.



What do you mean Quality of Karma A Karma is a Karma the result of different Karmas are different.



You say you will not allow religion to come in the way of your rationality and yet you say you believe Gita to be the word of Lord. If you believe Gita to be the word of Lord then there should not be any doubt. If you have any doubts it means you don’t believe or your belief is not firm

Sunil Ji, thanks for making your position clear. Hinduism does not make it obligatory to believe or not believe in avatar. This is the only religion that permits even atheism or agnosticism. What is more important in Hinduism is the quality of one's karma. Srimad Bhagwad Geeta is full of this concept. I go by the Geeta and believe in it as the word of God.

Does that mean I consider Lord Krishna to be God? Yes, when I am in a temple. No, when I am sitting and talking to group of scientists and rationalists.

I think we should learn to compartmentalise our lives. We should not allow scientific doubts to poke holes into our beliefs when we sit in a temple in front of a deity, and we should not allow religion hamper exploration of scientific truths.
