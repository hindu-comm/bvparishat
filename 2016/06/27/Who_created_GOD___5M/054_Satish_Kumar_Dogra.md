Sunil Ji,  

 In today's world of science and rationality, there are several ways of approaching such issues as the concept of avatar.  

  

Once can take a strictly scientific view and deny all this. On the other extreme one may take a faithful approach and believe in every word about the birth and acts of Lord Rama and Lord Krishna.  

  

Personally, I take Lord Rama and Lord Krishna as powerful cultural-emotional symbols that help me organise my thinking about Ishwarah. For me, it is immaterial whether they really existed. What is more important is that they are a part of my mental make-up and help me organise my response to issues of spirituality.  

  

I also believe that an attempt to try to define in concrete terms the details of birth and actions of the avtars tends to either take away their cultural-emotional value or to make us blindly and fanatically stuck with a belief-system.  
  

Having said this, let me draw your attention to the following shlokah from Srimad Bhagwad Geeta which seems to be of crucial importance for understanding the phenomenon of avatar.  

**अजोऽपि सन्नव्ययात्मा भूतानामीश्वरोऽपि सन् ।**

**प्रकृतिं स्वामधिष्ठाय सम्भवाम्यात्ममायया ॥ ६ ॥**

Two points are important in what Lord Krishna says: 1. It is not a natural phenomenon for Ishwarah to be born as a human. 2. By His powers He can take human birth.  

To raise questions like whether as a human being His powers are limited or He retains His full power is to take these matters of faith into the realm of scientific and rational analysis. One must keep faith and science in two different compartments in one's mind and not mingle them.
