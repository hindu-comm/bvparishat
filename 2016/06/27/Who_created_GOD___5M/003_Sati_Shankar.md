Dear Dr. Yadu

Thanks for creatinng a new thread. Though I would be able to revisit this thread but for now,

To get correct answer, one must ask a clear question.

In the same line,

Please clarify me whay do you mean by "God" you are referring to?

And according to which tradition, sanAtan or biblical?

  

Once you make your question clear and specific it will be come easy for members to reply.

hope you understand the significance of a clear and correct question.

Regards

Sati Shankar
