Let me share some of my views based on whatever I have gathered from the scriptures.  
  

1\. The human soul आत्मा just like the परमात्मा is indestructible ---- never created and never destroyed. So, the concept of birth and death relates only to the body and not to the soul. Srimad Bhagwad Geeta is full of shlokas that repeatedly state this.  
  

2\. The human soul is caught in a cycle of births and deaths. But Ishwarah is not caught in that cycle. As the Yog Sutras says, स एष पूर्वेषामपिगुरुः कालेनानवच्छेदात् ॥२६॥  
  

3\. Therefore, since God is not a part of the life-death sequence, He must decide to enter that system whenever He feels the need to do so. (यदा यदा हि धर्मस्य ....)  
  

4\. It is well within His power to enter the cycle of life-and-death. Once he does it, His physical existence becomes subject to the rules that apply to all of us.  
  

5\. The physical death of Lord Krishna is not the death of God, just as the death of anyone of us is not our death. As the Geeta says, for us it is just like changing clothes. For God, of course, it is passing from a state of human existence back into His existence as Ishwarah.  
  

All this would hold true if one believes in the truth of the scriptures. If one doesn't, then of course one must take a strictly scientific view and say, "I won't believe till my eyes see it and ears hear it."
