Namaste

  

The dialogue here seems to be going off track in addressing the question raised by Dr. Yadu, which has its deep links to language classification as ' Daivee- Maanushee Vak'.

  

The moment one starts arguing with a quote from Gita, Bhagavata, Veda, Ramayana, the responder is already and a priori, committed hypothetically to a predefined position . In other words the line drawn is: (= Do not question the hypothesis, authority of text. Do not cross the line by asking ' ati- prashna', lest your head split to million pieces(- the caution of the betaal to Vikramaaditya ?!)

  

Now if we proceed on the line of argument-' sri Krishna did not take a birth through a 'womb', as a normal known human process, the faith in ' beyond logic acceptance of supernatural births ( - should we also cover virgin birth? - i dont know), then the entire debate here goes out beyond our context ; it is no more in human society; the debate lands in ' ateendriya- atimaanusha-divya- manvantara scale connected time lines' where undoubtedly Samskrutham becomes Gods Language(- by default or deduction based on faith).

  

Alternatively, if the ' human like us ( asmat-sadtushah) logic is taken, history snd social implication of vedic tradition is nothing different Qualitatively from Abrahamic views( held by Sheldon Pollock, Wendy Etc;). For quantity surely India has more texts, a claimed antiquity and historicity bigger and variegated than Abrahamic religions; but todays ( kaliyuga?!) ground reality is 85% world is pledging their religious affiliation to Abrahamic scriptures, religions and traditions.

  

  

It is in this background the poorvapaksha debate and position formation of current debate from traditional scholars seem to lack the right teeth to bite and chew the arguments of Philology and literration from Pollock.

  

In other words, simply the responses to question raised by Dr. Yadu
are still crossing swords in thin air from thousand feet distance! There appears to me to be no connect and contact between the question and response(- aamraan prushtah, kovidaaraan aschaste; Patanjali Mahabhashya).

  

Without addressing this specific question, the dialgue sessions on Poorva-paksha will just be sessions talking to the ' already faithful community' just as a rehearsal repeating the passage of text. The text is not the question. The challenge is meaning , relevance authority and use if text.

  

Look forward for further inputs.
