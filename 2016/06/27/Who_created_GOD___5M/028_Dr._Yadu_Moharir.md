Namaste Prof Korada,

  

My present question is simple,  

  

a.  Was KrishNa born and die a Human death?

  

b. If one accepts, that if it was a HUMAN birth and DEATH, then Who promoted him to the status of Devata.?

  

I am not asking WHY ? or HOW but just WHO ? Was this "WHO" a humanbeing or not !?  

  

There are thousands of temples (devaalaya) throughout India and most Indians regard him as GOD / DEVATA.  

  

Thank you for taking interest and I look-forward to hearing from you.  

  

Best Rgds,

  

Dr Yadu
