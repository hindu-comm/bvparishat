Dear Sastryji,

We analyzed the topic in our paper to WSC last year. Bhatrhari gives much larger and extremely erudite analysis.

In Sanskrit the word is a concept, expression of a भाव. It is not a वस्तु. The latter is a manifestation.

Thee is a conceptual universe overlapping the material universe. This makes the language beautiful and

cosmological. संज्ञा words also have भाव, which may not be directly obvious because we may not be

applying ourselves to use them. 

This gets more interesting as we translate .काव्य. This is where Pollock and company fail royally! 

Best regards,

BM
