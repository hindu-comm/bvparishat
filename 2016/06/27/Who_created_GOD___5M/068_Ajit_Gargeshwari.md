Was he born is human being a (MORTAL) being and die a MORTAL Death, --

This question has been answered clearly by scholars. The difference between Krishna and all others including devas humans asuras etc is this which Krishna clearly says. All have an adhikara to Moksha and will eventually be liberated. The difference between him and others is all are under the bondage of Karma and he is not. Krishna identifies himself with Isvara for he says he is isvara. Isvara is not equivalent to the concept of GOD as found is other religions. Confusion starts when one does not read or understand the original and reads translation. Since Isvara cannot be translated it has been roughly translated as GOD in many Indian and foreign translations. The devas found in Vedas and Puranas may be translated as Gods but not as Isvara
