You are right.

  

But later, the discussion continued because it was focussed on Krishna and the word GOD got relegated.

  

But I am not sure if the word is still lurking in the background of the Krishna question too.

  

Even Iswara is not close to God who is a personal god.

  

Is'wara , sEs'wara- nirIs'wara views , Brahman, Paramaatman etc are tradition-insider's categories.

  

Dr Moharir says, there is Battle for Sanskrit, Pollock and so on behind all his enquiry. Let us wait to see how.
