Who created God?

  

As per Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar (Nobel laureate, in a discussion when he still teenage): “God was a hypothesis invented by man to regulate man's conduct and establish order and behavior between man and man.” (Wali, 1991).p61. See also in [Top 11 quotes by Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar](http://www.azquotes.com/author/29261-Subrahmanyan_Chandrasekhar): “God is Man's greatest invention.”  
  

As per *Acintya Bedha Abedha Tattva**Vedānta* framework, God is eternal and is the first life, from which all lives and matter arose; in other words, “Life comes from Life” and “Matter comes from Life”. However, there is no way to verify the first life (God) in your This problem is similar to the problems of matter-first (materialism) and of both mind and matter are fundamental (interactive substance dualism) or *Prak**ṛti*and*Puru**ṣa*of*Sā**ṃkhya*. All these three metaphysics have serious problems as elaborated in [(Vimal, 2010b)](http://sites.google.com/site/rlpvimal/Home/2010-Vimal-DefineC-LVCR-3-2.pdf) and [(Vimal, 2013)](http://sites.google.com/site/rlpvimal/Home/2012-Vimal-Emergence-UMBW-CUP.pdf). The middle way (extended dual-aspect monism, eDAM, or *Dvi-Pak**ṣa Advaita Vedānta*)^(^(\[i\])) has least number of problems compared to all three metaphysics.

The main difference is that, in the eDAM, in the beginning, the unmanifested state of *Brahman* had both physical and mental aspects latent. Then, manifestation started and eventually we evolved and have the highest manifestation of *Brahman* at *Samādhi* state, which can be called God or whatever name your like to give. If we attain this state, we acquire godly virtues, such as compassion, humility, love for all, and also of course the BLISS (*ānanda*). All people (including Sri Krishna and Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu) who have attained this state are equivalent to each other and can be called God (this is the definition of God in the eDAM). In other words, God is inside us and is the name of 4^(th) (*Samādhi*) state of our mind-brain system. This is the essence of an important example in *Vedānta*: two-birds (one is *ātman* in our 3 states and other is *parmātman* in the 4^(th) state) are sitting close to each other, and *ātman* is trying very hard to cross *māyā*to reach and become *parmātman*.

You assume the full manifestation of *Brahman* in the beginning as God, the eDAM assumes the full manifestation after 13.72 billion years of evolution in the 4^(th) (*Samādhi*) state of our mind-brain system, which is consistent with science. Your approach seems to be top-down, whereas the *Dvi-Pak**ṣa Advaita*’s approach is bottom-up (from potentiality to actualization/realization/‘full manifestation’). We can scientifically verify the latter (because some people have attained the 4^(th) state and there are lots of related functional MRI data), but we cannot verify your approach.

The term ‘life’ is defined in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life) “life is a process \[…\] Life is considered a characteristic of something that exhibits all or most of the following traits: [Homeostasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis "Homeostasis") … [Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_organization "Biological organization") … [Metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism "Metabolism") … [Growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_growth "Cell growth") … [Adaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation "Adaptation") … Response to[stimuli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology) "Stimulus (physiology)") …
[Reproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction "Reproduction") \[…\] living things function on[negative entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negentropy "Negentropy") … life is a self-sustained chemical system … living things are[self-organizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organization "Self-organization")and[autopoietic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis "Autopoiesis")(self-producing)”.

In the eDAM framework, a state of life is a dual-aspect entity: its mental aspect contains consciousness and its physical aspect contains material entities with the above traits. The *Dvi-Pak**ṣa Advaita* (eDAM) is simply the extension of *cit-acit* *Viśi**ṣṭādvaita* (Ramānujāchārya: 1017-1137 AD: mind (*cit*) and matter (*acit*) and *Kashmir Shaivism* (860–925 AD). Here, mental aspect (consciousness, mental aspect of life) comes from the mental aspect of unmanifested state of *Brahman*, and physical aspect (matter, physical aspect of life) comes from the physical aspect of unmanifested state of *Brahman*. Cross-causality is forbidden because it makes the serious category mistake, so mater-comes-from-life is untenable.

\[i\] The extended dual-aspect monism(eDAM,*Dvi-Pak**ṣa Advaita Vedānta*) is a middle way (between materialism and idealism) framework. The eDAM is elaborated in (Vimal, 2008, 2010a, 2013, 2015c, 2015d), an e-book [(Vimal, 2012b)](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/2.1.1982.0485) for Hinduism and another e-book [(Vimal, 2012a)](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/2.1.1471.5847) for other religions.
