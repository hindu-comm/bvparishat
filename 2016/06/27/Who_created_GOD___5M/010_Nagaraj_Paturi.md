\>Prof Paturi has already classified KRISHNA as GOD, however, has not answered the fundamental question, Did KrishNa have a HUMAN BIRTH & did he DIE A HUMAN DEATH ? AND who then PROMOTED to GOD-HEAD ?

  

-------- Dear Dr Moharir, I did not classify Krishna as GOD. All that I said is that all the sources of the character Krishna have him only as 1) a divine character 2) as an Avataara 3) as an Avataara of what you may like to approximate as GOD.

  

If a knew any Krishna who had a human birth or died a human death outside this literature (in historical or any other such reality), then if I knew that it was that Krishna whom I knew as such that was depicted in the different sources (books)of the Krishna character as

1\) a divine character 2) as an Avataara 3) as an Avataara of what you may like to approximate as GOD, then I would have been able to say , Krishna who is originally not 1) a divine character 2) as an Avataara 3) as an Avataara of what you may like to approximate as GOD was promoted as 1) a divine character 2) as an Avataara 3) as an Avataara of what you may like to approximate as GOD by these books or by the author(s) of these books.

  

But I do not any Krishna who had a human birth or died a human death outside this literature (in historical or any other such reality) that I can imagine to have been depicted in this literature.
