नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

My question to all is Who Created Gods?

                                --- Vidvan Yadu

  

We obviously do not know -- are you referring to Indian / सनातन / वैदिक धर्म ?

  

Please use the standard Sanskrit term . There are no gods / God in वैदिकधर्म ।

  

If anybody used the term it is a rough translation - just like 'Grammar' for व्याकरणम् ।

  

धन्यो’स्मि
