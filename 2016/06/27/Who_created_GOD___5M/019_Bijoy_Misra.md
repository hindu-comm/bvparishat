So, why should we discuss this if we are not sure about what the word represents?

Frank Clooney (the Dean of Divinity School) once told me that he was looking for Hindu theology.

I told him there was no such thing. Being a Catholic he continues to remain confused

about who Krishna, Rama etc are. Some ISKCON people evangelize through such words.

The closest we have is Ishvara defined by Patanjali. Hisnduism has cosmology.

In my opinion, the new India must refrain from the arbitrary mapping done by the theologians in the west.
