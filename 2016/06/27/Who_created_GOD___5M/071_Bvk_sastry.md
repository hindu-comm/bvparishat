**BVK Sastry ( on - A)**:- I dont think so. There seems to be no restriction -example: bhagavaan Manuh, bhagavaan Yajnavalkyah, Veda-Vyasah. The usage has to be Meaning-Relevant and matching by deservedness.

  

Does it mean there is free for all, unrestricted license and ' academic freedom' to use it , like ' bhagavaan mantri- mahodayah, bhagavaan Macaulay, Henry , Max muller-?!

The answer is NO!

There is a standard of language usage for ' media- entertainment' and serious ' meditation- philosophy- spiritual context'.

  

The usage of the abbreviation

\<Pro -> and as a full word in different contexts, cultures and speaker context gives different communication . One does not transpose the meaning of \<professional> from the above to the meaning of a \<prostitute>! Just because one sees such usage.

**BVK Sastry ( on -B)**:- Already responded by the logic of deservedness .There is nothing wrong in traditional usage. Bhagavaan Buddha and Jain are also seen; but do we see Bhagavan Mohammed-or Jesus bhagavaan? Would the other religion users accept the technicality? Why? What would be your reason to make them accept such a usage?

**BVK Sastry ( on -C)**:- Etymology depends on what value you prefer for the word-' bhaga' and what historical, social implications you want to draw.

Tradition has provided a technical definition - where in six values are associated with the word 'bhaga(षण्णां भग इतीरित:)- and we have dictionaries and other usages which connect this word with female organ.

It is for you see what meaning you want to use for constructing the communication from this word/ and भग-वती - which lurks behind this question and Tantra practices.

  

It is here that the colonial and oriental scholars use psycho- analysis to tell ' what the traditional text and practice means' from an 'outsider perspective'. It is for the scholars of tradition and a society which values that tradition to define and defend their identity- culture inheritance.

  

In the upcoming नवरात्र-दुर्गा पूजा how the society of Bengal and Ramakrishna Mission defends काली पूजा depends upon their appreciation of the challenge here, their greater love for ' sonar bangla' and Tagores poem which has become national anthem containing the word- भारत- भाग्य- विधाता.

  

What is this ' bhaagya' depends upon what meaning one wants to associate with the word ' bhaga'!

So is the challenge for vaidika traditional scholars who use 'bhaagya- sukta' to bless the newly wed. Does ' bhaagya sukta', using the word ' bhaga' some thirtythree times and advocating ' engagement with bhaga' day in and day out means licenscious unregulated sex or some thing of value for life?- this is for traditional vaidikas to explain to the newly wed. It is too dangerous and precarious to leave these expressions to be understood from Monier Williams and Max-Muller resources.

**BVK Sastry ( on -D )**:- I limit my post here by the guideline of Ajit. You are asking a larger and deeper issue of Translation across languages. It needs some other expert of english language- vocabulary and history, covering Anglo-Saxon languages, Classical Biblical languages and their historic foot prints. Suffice it to say- the word bhagavaan existed way before the anglo-saxon linguistics and theological deliberations on ' What do we call as God?' The separation is as wide and deep as Hell and Heaven; and can not be wished away by the pious political community prayer: ईश्वर-अल्ला- तेरो नाम- All God Sameness.

  

Vedic tradition has a sustained and continuing clarity through Shaastra -Yoga traditions documented in Samskrutham on these words of \<daivee vaak>- devataa, Purusha, Avataara, Bhagavaan, Ishwara and Brahma. The Samskrutha vyakarana when studied as Yoga with Anvaya-mukha-Krama pedagogy gives clarity on this: And this is Yoga-Samskrutham University approach to address Sanskrit: Battle .
