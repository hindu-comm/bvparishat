\> Without addressing this specific question, the dialgue sessions on Poorva-paksha will just be sessions talking to the ' already faithful community' just as a rehearsal repeating the passage of text.

  

----- AadaraNIya Sri BVK Sastryji,

  

The first one to respond to the Krishna post of Dr Moharir was myself and the response was:

  

>

Can you kindly point out which part of it is talking to the already faithful community?
