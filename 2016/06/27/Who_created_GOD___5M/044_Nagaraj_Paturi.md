After so many posts, back and forth in this thread, it is beginning to appear that Dr Yadu wanted to communicate something different from what he appeared to communicate. In stead of taking this as inability on his part to convey ideas, it seems to be plausible to see this as a conscious communication game that he wanted to play.

  

Dr Yadu seems to be on the same page as most of us on the list in preferring the tradition insider's categories and in pointing out the problem with the uncritical use of the western (rather Christian)categories to express 'Hindu' ideas. But he gave the impression just to the contrary. When members began to respond thinking that they were communicating through the categories that he understands, he began to point a figure at their 'wrong' use of terms.

  

May I request him to come out openly with his actual message to the list, if he is satisfied with the results of his 'clinical tests' so far?
