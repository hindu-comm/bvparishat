\> This makes Sri Krishna to be a Character Created by a Creative Composition Writer:

  

That is exactly what makes it the opposite of how you characterized it 'talking to the already faithful community'. The already faithful community does not view Krishna to be a Character Created by a Creative Composition Writer. For such a community Krishna isalready there beforeHis depiction by the author of the book. For them, the author is just only narratingwhat has actually happened. 

  

To already faithful community I could not have said, "I do not know any Krishna who is not 'GOD'either*in*Mahabharata or Srimadbhagavata or Harivamshapurana or any other such related work. Krishna*in each of these works*is always a divya prakriti ((divine character). " because for them Mahabharata or no Mahabharata, Srimadbhagavata or no Srimadbhagavata , Harivamsapurana or no Harivamsapurana, Krishna is a fact. According to them, one should not say I do not know any Krishna outside the sources.

  

\>The approach to answer here for this question to meet personal saadhanaa needs is different from meeting the requirements of an answer in a public debate. Tarka is for public. Shraddhaa is for saadhanaa.

  

------- If I spoke here from the standpoint of my personal saadhana, I would not have said any of the things I said in that post. Everything I said is only for public debate. There is tarka and tarka alone in that. I am sure all the readers of that post would agree that there is tarka and tarka alone in that.

  

I can only praythat Krishna of my personal saadhana helps those who are not able get at this to get there.
