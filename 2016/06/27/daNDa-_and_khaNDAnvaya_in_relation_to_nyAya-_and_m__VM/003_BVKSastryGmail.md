Namaste



1. Thanks for the reference by Amba ji and clear pointers by Professor Korada.



 Can we look at this issue in a slightly different way ? Here are my thoughts, shared, on the basis of the literal symbolism of the words: ‘danDa and khanDa’ :: Linear and Assembly models ? 

The word ‘Sloka’ has a common connotation covering ‘Veda’ as well as ‘Kavya’.



2. For me, it looks like that both these pedagogic methods come under the common stream of ‘ Samskruth study’ pointed by Mallinatha Suri in his Vyakhyana paddhati. ‘ iha- **anvaya-mukhena eva – sarvam vyaakhyaayate** mayaa\| naamoolam likhyate kinchit, naanapekshitam uchyate’ which precisely is aimed to bring out ‘ what is the sentence – sense (= vakyaartha)’ - without ambiguity and unwarranted expansion. 



3. By nature, Samskrutham sentences come in two streams of pedagogic expression: ‘Chandas and Bhashaa’. Both streams use ‘anvaya’
method. In Vedas, the varna-pada –aanupoorvi cannot be altered. In ‘Bhashaa’, the karaka-anvaya method cannot be strictly linear. This is irrespective of the subject frame as ‘Darshana –Shaastra’ dealing with
Nyaya, Meemaamsaa or Vedanta or Sahitya.



3a). danDa means a ‘Stick ‘ - a straight one, by default thinking. (I am not looking at a curved stick – kutila- danDa of Vidooshaka : the staff of jester in Sanskrit drama). This symbolism of danDa as straight, linear - would translate to the meaning construction of a sentence using the word meanings as they occur sequentially and in a
‘linear mode ’ ( = aanupoorvee)’ . This is a step by step construction, starting with the first word in the sentence and progressively moving towards the last word. There appears to be no ‘ technical demand on looking for the ‘verb’ as the anchor, by searching all the words in the given sentence and item wise categorizing them as subanta –tinganta.
Call it a style of construction.



 Example : Atha –ato –Brahma- JijnyasA.



Here the reader would start with ‘atha’ and then go on for the next ‘ato’ and then for the subsequent words. There is no demand to look for the ‘ kriyapada’ and then make ‘ anvaya’ around it.



Such linear construction may be prosaic, cryptic and technical. Such linear construction is an inviolable demand in understanding languages like English, where ‘word order’ is ‘ linear and rigid’ like a ‘ Stick = danDa’.



3b). khanDa means ‘ parts, individual pieces that need to be assembled to construct the communicative sentence. This would translate to the exercise of identification of word-class using grammar rules first and then assembling them by ‘ competence and context ( aakaankshaa –saamarthya –yogyataa –vivakshaa)’ to make a sentence.

Example : Kalidasas poetry – Kaschita kaantaaviraha gurunaa…. Chakre (vasatim)….



4. Each method has its advantage in ‘ text centric teaching’ and ‘creative poetry composition’. And only the master of the discipline and language can guide what is right approach.



5. These two pedagogic methods (Danda and Khanda) should not be confused and mixed ( as seen largely the case in Computational Sanskrit Linguistics; and teaching models which prefer word meanings drawn from dictionary as translation models, where grammar technicality part is
pushed below the carpet ( for it is too difficult for the sukumara-mati’s).



 The final result of such confusion and unspecified mix up ( in the name of simplifying and better outreach at the cost of precision
and soul of Samskrutham) seems to be to forced imposition of the ‘Anglicized way of linear model - meaning construction pedagogy – applied through linear programming methods, over Samskruth documents analysis. This is infringement on the sovereign and supreme nature of Samskruth traditions, where established language tradition of Samskrutham is not respected for its rules of Grammar. In short, Samskruth grammar rules need to be respected for their integrity and internal consistency as one would respect the language rules of programming language in coding. 



 Further exploring, the root of this problem goes down to the construction of ‘Vedas’ as ‘ Documents of Historical poetry in a language which accrued several modifications like a flowing river, before it reached the ‘ Grammar Freeze point’ provided by Panini. It is here that classical Samskruth teams and Colonial Scholars have an irreconcilable difference that cannot be bridged.



4. This also opens up other deeper issues on How a Sanskrit sentence is to be decoded for its meaning and application? And challenge of ‘ welcoming new Vocabulary to the Samskrutham lexicons’. Example : the debate on the word ‘Entropy’. 



5. Classical Tradition holds that ‘ Unified Vedanga Paddhati’ is the pedagogy for Samskrutham language. This is practically the ‘ (Kaaraka) Anvaya mukha‘ for Bhashaa ; and ‘ Agni-mukha- Anvaya’ ( = Yjana model) ’
for ‘Chandas’. Vedanga paddhati indeed is the ‘Yoga-Samskrutham’ approach, where Nirukti –Nirvachana dominates the ‘ Word- Meaning Construction (Pada – lakshanam ) ’ before ‘ Khanda anvaya / Danda anvaya’ is applied.



6. Colonial and Neo-Classical Tradition and Computational linguists
do not agree with this. Instead these schools make their own sandwich methodology of construction and pedagogy promoting ‘ English likeness’ in Samskruth Linguistics and Analysis . 



Look forward for scholars to provide more inputs.
