Namaste Amba ji



On \< Will you please explain to me to which work in the Sanskrit Computational Linguistics you are referring to where **grammar technicality part is pushed below the carpet?** \>

**1. An opening note of confession**: I would have preferred to discuss this issue off line and as a private conversation. Any criticism here on the discipline of computational Sanskrit Linguistics will not be taken kindly, especially when reference is made to standard resources from tradition. I don’t want this situation to disturbs the good friendship relations amongst us, the Samskruth fraternity. 

I do have great respect and appreciation for the excellent work and sincerity of studies done in this area, in the last five conferences, globally and in-depth study of Sanskrit grammar undertaken by technology specialists, both in India and abroad. But that does not stop me from raising flags on issues of concern for traditional schools and in the interest of retaining the clarity needed for Sanskrit-Studies using the analytical tools provided by CSL. Please take this, at best as a dissenting voice, for the purpose of this post.

**2. Coming to the specifics**: 

**On \< Where grammar technicality part is pushed below the carpet> ? On three points: Word Modeling , Word Classification Technicality, Sentence Construction modality**.

 Paninian grammar is an integral rule book covering the ‘Chandas’ and ‘Bhashaa’ category of ‘words’. Ashtadhyayi is an organized rule book of Samskrutham; It is not the grammar of a social or historical language/ dialect. Ashtadhyayi was written for a human consumption and use in a 'yajna' context. The CSL approach does not seem to recognize this foundational distinction.

Anvaya of Danda and Khanda models go mainly for Bhashaa part.
For the ‘Chandas’ part, one needs to depend upon special texts and commentaries. Taking note of the fact that Paninian rule recognizes the economy and brevity at the level of a ‘single accent and half a letter ( ardha –mAtrA lAghava) and is sensitive to ‘svara changes in compounding’ so much so that three rules are made to cover changes in accent of one ‘ compound-word ‘Arya-Brahmana’. CSL seems to prefer ‘ Karaka –Anvaya’ method and lean to ‘ danda-anvaya’ method in program outputs, due to the ease of modeling Sanskrit like English. Once ‘Shabda /Pada’ definition goes awry, the shaabda-bodha and related understanding in Vyakarana (Karaka –Anvaya) , Nyaya (Vakya –Tatparya) and Meemaamsaa ( Vakya -Pramana) also go off the line in the outputs from the CSL programs.

 On Word –Classification technicality, all the technicalities of Samskrutham are not included in the ‘Word –type and Boundary identifications. The authority of ‘ Monier Williams’ for Word boundary identification and Word typology does not help here.

IF Computational Sanskrit Linguists (CSL) accept the ‘Standards of Language modeling and technical definitions of what constitutes a valid ‘Samskruth word’, then the CSL team needs to show how they have accommodated the Paninian technicality of the ‘Word’ definition before going for further computational processing :

\- ‘Word’ with reference to the technicality of Sutras \< 1-4-14-
Supting antam padam ; 2-1-1 : Samarthah pada-vidhih ; 1-2-45: Arthavat -adhatuh -apratyayah – Praatipadikah ; 1-2-46: Krit- Taddhita - Samaasascha.> The explanation of ‘saamarthya’ in 2-1-1 is detailed at <http://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools/ashtadhyayi/vyakhya/2/2.1.1.htm> and shows four types of structure for the technicality of word. \< चतुर्विधः अत्र विग्रहः द्रष्टव्यः। सङ्गतार्थः समर्थः। संसृष्टार्थः समर्थः। सम्प्रेक्षितार्थः समर्थः। सम्बद्धार्थः समर्थः। उत्तरपदलोपी कर्मधारयः तत्पुरुषः। पदस्य विधिः, पदयोः विधिः, पदानां विधिः, पदात् विधिः=पदविधिः इति सर्वविभक्त्यन्तः समासः अत्र बोध्यः >

2.2 - The Paninian language modeling is very clear about the distinct classification of words under ‘ Chandas’ and ‘Bhashaa’ tags. There are overlapping/ Common rules and also unique rules for ‘Chandas’
vocabulary. The Chandas words which come with a voice part need further augmentation by other works of Vedanga and Pratishakhyas, which CSL is yet to consider for incorporation.

When ‘Word’ definitions are at variance and slip-shod, the sentence construction modalities will go awry. The success with ‘Sandhi’ splits is a good progress; but that is not qualifying enough ground for ‘success in Samasa analysis’; and later the ‘Vakya –analysis’. See
<http://sanskrit.inria.fr/Symposium/DOC/Amba_intro.pdf>

**For the benefit of those needing a clarity on what Computational linguistics is all about, here below is some useful detailing from technical sources. This would help to see what aspects of Samskrutham would gel/ not gel with CSL studies.**:

**A) Definition of Computational linguistics**.

The Association of Computational Linguistics defines the term Computational Linguistics as follows: (<http://www.aclweb.org/archive/misc/what.html> ) : Simply put, computational linguistics is the scientific study of language from a computational perspective. Computational linguists are interested in providing computational models of various kinds of linguistic phenomena. These models may be "knowledge-based" ("hand-crafted") or "data-driven" ("statistical" or "empirical"). Work in computational linguistics is in some cases motivated from a scientific perspective in that one is trying to provide a computational explanation for a particular linguistic or psycholinguistic phenomenon; and in other cases the motivation may be more purely technological in that one wants to provide a working component of a speech or natural language system. Indeed, the work of computational linguists is incorporated into many working systems today, including speech recognition systems, text-to-speech synthesizers, automated voice response systems, web search engines, text editors, language instruction materials, to name just a few.

B\) **The expanse of computational linguistics** -
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_linguistics>

Computational linguistics is an interdisciplinary field concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective. Traditionally, computational linguistics was performed by computer scientists who had specialized in the application of computers to the processing of a natural language. **But little if no success was made**. Computational linguists often work as members of interdisciplinary teams, which can include regular linguists, experts in the target language, and computer scientists. In general, computational linguistics draws upon the involvement of linguists, computer scientists, experts in artificial intelligence, mathematicians, Quantum Physicists, logicians, philosophers, cognitive scientists, cognitive psychologists, psycholinguists, anthropologists and neuroscientists, among others. **Computational linguistics has theoretical and applied components. Theoretical computational linguistics focuses on issues in theoretical linguistics and cognitive science, and applied computational linguistics focuses on the practical outcome of modeling human language use**.

C) **Associated Disciplines with Computational Linguistics**:
Computational linguistics is expected to facilitate machine translation. In order to translate one language into another, it was observed that one had to understand the grammar of both languages, including both morphology (the grammar of word forms) and syntax (the grammar of sentence structure). In order to understand syntax, one had to also understand the semantics and the lexicon (or 'vocabulary'), and even something of the pragmatics of language use. Thus, what started as an effort to translate between languages evolved into an entire discipline devoted to understanding how to represent and process natural languages using computers.

Some research in the field of computational linguistics aims to create working speech or text processing systems while others aim to create a system allowing human-machine interaction. Programs meant for human-machine communication are called conversational agents.

**Just as computational linguistics can be broken in to four main area of discourse: developmental linguistics, structural linguistics, linguistic production, and linguistic comprehension. **

Computational linguistics involves looking at the ways that a machine would treat natural language, or in other words, dealing with or constructing models for language that can allow for goals such as accurate machine translation of language, or the simulation of artificial intelligence. Generally, computational linguistics involves looking at the nature of a language, its morphology, syntax, and dynamic use, and drawing any possible useful models from this observation in order to help machines to handle language. Experts point out that the evolving models for computational linguistics are much more difficult than the uses to which computers were first applied, namely, the handling of quantitative data.

Practical applications of computational linguistics include text-to-speech software, which attempts to understand what someone is saying in order to translate it into digital text. There are also various models that have been worked out that allow for using machines to understand how language is acquired. However, the end goal of enabling machines to really simulate human linguistic responses that go along with "higher-level thought" has been a continuing evolution that still leaves a lot of room for improvement. One theory is that machines will eventually acquire the ability to simulate real human conversation, and with it, will become generally more intelligent through heuristic models and other processes that go far beyond the mere acquisition of data and quantitative computations of that data

**D) How Sanskrit Teams have perceived computational Sanskrit Linguistics**: <http://sanskritlinguistics.blogspot.in/>

Sanskrit Computational Linguistics : पदवाक्यप्रमाणशास्त्रेभ्यः (व्याकरणमीमांसान्यायादिभ्यः) अर्थनिर्धारणार्थानां विधिकल्पानां प्रकाराणाञ्च (Algorithms and methods for determining meanings) सङ्कलनम् अत्र । - Language, in other words the storehouse of all human Knowledge is represented by words and meanings. Language by itself has an Ontological structure, Epistemological underpinnings and Grammar. Across languages, even though words /usages differ, the concept of meanings remain the same in respective communications. Yet the "Meanings" are understood by human beings based on Contextual, Relative, Tonal and Gestural basis. The dictionary meanings or 'as it is' meanings are taken rarely into consideration, thus human language is ambigious in one sense and flexible in other.

**Computers on the other hand are hard-coded to go by the dictionary meanings**. Thus teaching (programming) Computers to understand natural language (human language) has been the biggest challenge haunting Scientists ever since the idea of Artificial Intelligence (AI) came into existence. In addition this has lead to the obvious question of "What is intelligence" from a Computation perspective. Defining intelligence precisely being impossible, this field of study has taken many shapes such as Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing and "Machine Learning" etc. Artificial Intelligence instead of being used as a blanket term, is now being used increasingly as "Analytics" in many critical applications.

Sanskrit being the oldest is also the most Scientific and Structured language. **Sanskrit has many hidden Algorithms built into it as part of its vast scientific treatises, for analysing "Meanings" or "Word sense" from many perspectives since time immemorial**. "It is perhaps our job to discover and convert the scientific methods inherent in Sanskrit into usable Computational models and Tools for Natural Language Processing rather than reinventing the wheel" - as some Scientists put it. This blog's purpose is to expose some of the hidden intricate tools and methodologies used in Sanskrit for centuries to derive precise meanings of human language, to a larger audience particularly Computational Linguists for further study, analysis and deployment in Natural Language Processing.

In addition, Sanskrit even though being flexible as a human language, is the least ambiguous as the structure of the language is precisely defined from a semantically and syntactical point of view. From a Psycholinguistic perspective this blog could also give us a glimpse of the advanced linguistic capabilities of our forefathers as well their highly disciplined approach towards the structure and usage.
