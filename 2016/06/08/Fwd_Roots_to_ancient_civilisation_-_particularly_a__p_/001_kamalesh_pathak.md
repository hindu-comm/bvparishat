Sir  
It's mostly toughest job to trace roots of a particular tribe or caste.. as per my limited knowledge I came to know 100plus sub branches of Brahmin only in Gujarat..so I think this group and other sources should be united to a lengthful study of each and every sub branch of Brahmin with their blood group.d.n.a.customs.system of samskaras. etc by nation wide. collected data to be studied by experts. DNA wise matching of blood with area.customs and caste can bring more accurate findings.sorry seniors if you think we are diverted..  
Regards.
