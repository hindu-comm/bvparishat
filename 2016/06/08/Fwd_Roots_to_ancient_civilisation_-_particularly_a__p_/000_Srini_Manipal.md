Dear all,



As told in Shastras, all our parampara cites direct connection through sages and divinities to God; irrespective of the sampradaya we belong i.e., maybe we follow Shankara, Ramanuja, Madhva and many others.



It is also told that the people of ancient Indian civilization migrated to other parts of the country till south from Aryavarta desha (mainly Sindhu-Sarasvati to west and north west, Himalayas to north and east, gangetic plains in middle, and up to Vindhya to south), where once Indian civilization flourished during the times of Ramayana and Mahabharata; then slowly moved towards south and also across the world later, due to invasions as well as seeking prospects.



It is also debated that this Aryavarta desha or phrases like aryairapi sevitam has been source points for the western notion of Aryans, through which the recent discussions have digressed the history/story of civilisations; and this digression also is ‘substantiated’ with the scientific ideas like big bang, earth and human evolution and continental drift. Now, the ideas like Indo-Aryan, Indo-European, Aryan-Dravidian have been inherited into the curricula of schools even without much of critical analysis from different perspectives.



I am in (re)search of a historical trace of Indian society with particular reference to my community called Tamil-Kannada (cross-cultural and cross-lingual dialect) Madhva Aravattokkalu (60 household) Brahmanas. Prof N S Rajapurohit had written an article on Aravattokkalu Brahamanaru in Kannada in 1935 that was published by then paper Jaya Karnataka, which I came to know through [www.kanaja.in](http://www.kanaja.in) site of Govt of Karnataka.



My questions are these:



What is Aravattu (sixty) Okkalu (households) Brahmanaru?

Where are they from?

How, when and why they migrated to where?

How they got connected to Madhva sampradaya?

How they built this Tamil-Kannada that is well spread across the globe within the community as mother tongue?



Hope some might have interesting information about this directly or indirectly and may like to share with me at the earliest.



The due credits to the information source will be mentioned in the references and the copy will be shared with them only.



Thank you in advance,

Srini
