Respected scholars, Namaskar!



Reference-Book----"Studies in Indology" by Dr.Satyakama Varma

page207

The sphota theory, as adopted by the Sanskrit grammarians, stands quite opposed to the theory of the so called Word-Powers.

page 210

The theory of the so called "three word powers" has been decried by Bhartrihari very emphatically.



There are scholars of Vaakyapadeeya on this list. Could you please explain to us which three word powers are opposed by Bhartrihari and why, so that we grow in our knowledge with you. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
