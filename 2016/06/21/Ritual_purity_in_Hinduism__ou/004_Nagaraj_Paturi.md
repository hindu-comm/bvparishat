Sruti texts are not the ones that are consulted for the day to day code. Smritis and Puranas are consulted for this purpose. Sruti provides the spirit behind the instructions of these books.

  

BTW, maDi isa wordin Telugu too.

  

Washermanis called maDivElu (Telugu ) probably maDivElu \< maDivEl. This shows that maDi as the word referring to the cleanliness (of clothes etc. )is a general word not limited to Brahmin usage.

  

Physical cleanliness is one of the bases of ritual purity though ritual purity is not limited tophysical cleanliness in almostall the purity-pollution beliefs all over the world. 

  

Ritually polluting aspects such as death related, menstrual blood related, physical uncleanliness related pollutions etc. being believed to be transmitted through touch, sight etc. are also part of huge number of purity-pollution belief systems all over the world.

  

BTW, maDi is not gender-specific in the Brahmin or Vaidika tradition.
