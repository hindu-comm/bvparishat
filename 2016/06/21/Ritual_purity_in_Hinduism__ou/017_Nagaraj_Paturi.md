\> Paturiji had explained that '*asaucham*' is super-natural. From your explanation, '*asaucham*' seems to be mental in nature.

  

----- Shankaraji, there is no contradiction between the two. What I called super-natural is what we call aadhidaivikam. What Sri Sivasenaniji called mental is what we call aadhyaatmikam. aadhyaatmikam is the means through which individual can access the aadhidaivika.

  

\>It is said that if a person who is in *aasaucham* visits temple, then the temple is polluted and it is necessary to do purification rites to regain the purity of the temple. I am not sure if this belief is supported by Sastrapramana.

  

---------- Again, I repeat, Dharmasindhu talks about the first year period later to the period as'oucham and it says devapuja can be performed during this period. It is the belief of ritual (supernatural) pollution gettingtransmitted through touch and sight that leads to the purification rites being performed by temple people when a person *in as'oucham* visits the deity.
