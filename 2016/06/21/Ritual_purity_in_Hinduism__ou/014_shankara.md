Sivasenaniji,

  

Thanks for the explanation.  

  

It is said that if a person who is in *aasaucham* visits temple, then the temple is polluted and it is necessary to do purification rites to regain the purity of the temple. I am not sure if this belief is supported by Sastrapramana.  

  

Paturiji had explained that '*asaucham*' is super-natural. From your explanation, '*asaucham*' seems to be mental in nature. I would like to know whether our sastras have described the nature of *asaucham*.  



regards  
shankara
