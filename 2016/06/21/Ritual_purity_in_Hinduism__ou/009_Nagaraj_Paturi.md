\> The concept of ritual purity or pollution is not yet clear to me.

  

The concepts of 'ritual purity' and 'ritual pollution' belong to the realm of super-natural. Thus 'ritual purity' is supernatural (related)purity and 'ritual pollution' is supernatural (related) pollution.

  

Here the word'pollution' has no connotation of 'bad'. For example, as'oucha accruing due to death is not 'bad'. It does not come in the way of the as'oucha-holding person performing the Vaidika rituals of communicating with the ancestral spirits. Those rituals are not 'bad' rituals. They are 'good' rituals only.To perform them, the performing kartaa needs physical cleanliness, and many other conditions of'purity'. Even the 'ritual pollution' of a different kind accruing from the touch or sight of a menstruating womancan badly affect the 'purity' required for performing such rituals.
