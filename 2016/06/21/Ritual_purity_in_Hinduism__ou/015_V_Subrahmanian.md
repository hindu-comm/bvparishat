In such a state, the focus required on a given rite is not possible and hence there is no point in doing kAmyakarmas and nimittakarmas in such a state. Visiting a temple is also a kAmyakarma or a nimittakarma (for instance there is this rule that if we are passing respectable people, we must salute them and proceed further, if our salutation does not disturb them; similarly if we are in a kshetra, we must pay respects to the deity there - then it becomes a nimittakarma); celebrating festivals is a nimittakarma. Since these are optional and since one is not in the frame of mind to do those dedicatedly, they are avoided.

Namaste

Can Atithtyam be performed during Ashaucham? Will shishtas come for food to such a house?
