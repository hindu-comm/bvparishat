Shankar ji

  

Pranaam.

  

I know that you asked for texts crticially dealing with how an external event such as a death of a parent is related to a simple act such as going to a temple, but allow me to share my understanding which might be helpful.

  

The connection between the external event (death of a parent etc.) and the body is the Manas. If there is a connection, then there is sorrow - Soka - in Manas. In such a state, the focus required on a given rite is not possible and hence there is no point in doing kAmyakarmas and nimittakarmas in such a state. Visiting a temple is also a kAmyakarma or a nimittakarma (for instance there is this rule that if we are passing respectable people, we must salute them and proceed further, if our salutation does not disturb them; similarly if we are in a kshetra, we must pay respects to the deity there - then it becomes a nimittakarma); celebrating festivals is a nimittakarma. Since these are optional and since one is not in the frame of mind to do those dedicatedly, they are avoided.

  

On the other hand, nityakarmas like sandhyAvandanam (and devatArcana and pancamahAyaj\~nas, as the learned Professor Nagaraj garu has quoted) need to be done - otherwise we have अकरणे प्रत्यवायः; so those responsibilities are discharged. In fact even during aSauca, sandhyAvandanam till arghyapradAna is done by some SishTas.

  

Since manas is the connection, even if somebody is not a part of the family, if there is a connection, some people behave as if they are in a period of aSauca. For instance, there is an incidence in a historical novel written by my grandfather, a naishThika, where the great Telugu poet SrInAthabhaTTa is depicted as observing aSauca, when his king vemAreDDy passes away. Kalidasa in SAkuntalam describes Kanvamaharshi as becoming कलुषः due to tears (कण्ठः स्तम्भितबाष्पवृत्ति**कलुषः, 4.6**). In the Ramayana (Adityahridayam), when Rama was worried about killing Ravana and Agastya teaches him AdityhRdayam, aSauca is acknolwledged (त्रिराचम्य शुचिर्भूत्वा धनुरादाय वीर्यवान्) by saying that Rama did Acamana, became SuciH and only then picked up his weapon. It is also seen that when one is reciting or learning Veda or even some stotra, when there is a disturbance, and abhyAsa is resumed after a brief interruption, it is resumed only after reciting the name of Vishnu three times (विष्णुर्विष्णुर्विष्णुः) because one's focus has diverted; now one has to become Suci again and vishNusmaraNa purifies one (यस्स्मरेत् पुण्डरीकाक्षं स बाह्याभ्यन्तरश्शुचिः). Thus for different levels of distractions, different levels of time (11 days for immediate family; 3 days for relatives; 1.5 days for distant relatives; till snAna upon seeing a dead body etc.) are prescribed.



Also, for a sannyAsin, there is no aSauca because no connection is acknowledged.
