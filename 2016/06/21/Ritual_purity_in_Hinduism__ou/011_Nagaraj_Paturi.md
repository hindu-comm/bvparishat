\>It is said that if someone in one's family or extended family dies, one is not supposed to visit temples, perform certain rituals, etc for certain number of days.

  

---- If you are talking of the varjya acts during the first one year, Dharmasindhu talks of such only for the direct children of the deceased and not to all the relatives of the family and extended family.

  

अथ प्रथमाब्देनिषिद्धानि: ***मातापित्रोर्मरणे*** वर्षपर्यंतं परान्नं गंधमाल्यादिभोगं मैथुनंअभ्यंगस्नानंचवर्जयेत् ।

  

It is also said here that

  

संध्योपासनदेवपूजापंचमहायज्ञातिरिक्तकर्ममात्रं च वर्ज्यं। Which implies that संध्योपासनदेवपूजापंचमहायज्ञ are to be performed during this period.
