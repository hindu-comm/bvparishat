Pranams to all,  

  

I am looking for books and articles that critically deal with the concept of ritual purity in Hinduism. Most traditional texts (Smritis and digests) that I looked into, merely lay out the rules to be followed with regard to impurity (asaucha such as sutaka or paataka).  

  

I have a few questions on this subject. I request scholars to help me find answers to these questions.  

  

1. Is the ritual purity identical with physical purity>

2. If not, how does it differ from physical purity? What is its exact nature?  

3. It is said that if someone in one's family or extended family dies, one is not supposed to visit temples, perform certain rituals, etc for certain number of days. Is there any logical explanation for this custom. Do our scriptures provide any explanation for this custom?



regards  
shankara
