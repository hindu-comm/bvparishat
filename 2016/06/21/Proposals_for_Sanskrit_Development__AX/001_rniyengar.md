The notification is as usual a set of pious paragraphs: उपदेश-अष्टादशी॥
The notification exhibits a confusion between the language as a*mediumofcommunication*and the intellectual knowledge content in it. Sanskrit as a language is fully evolved/developed/polished**indeed it is संस्कृतम्**\|\| Any further development has to be in the knowledge content in different disciplines ancient and modern.

  

The only paragraph that has some newness is:  



*15.Support Internship Project A project may be taken up for students of IITs, NIITs, IISERs, IIITs, IIScand ACITE approved technical colleges who would opt for internship in Sanskrit Institution under the guidance of Sanskrit Professors during the course of their study through which they would also get credits. If financial support is provided to such students their talent could be utilized in unraveling the scientific knowledge hidden in Sanskrit literature through small but focused projects with Sanskrit scholars in Sanskrit institutions.*

Fine. But why MHRD is not asking Sanskrit Universities to send their research students as interns for a few months to be guided by Professors of IITs in appropriate areas of knowledge? This interaction has to be a two way traffic!
