Thank you Jaya Prakshji,  
  
In the Gheranda Sanhita (Sanskrit text), the picture 13a does not match the description at p. 58-59. It seems some artist had drawn the wrong picture of that posture.  
  
I understand that for discussion on the same posture, the Hatharatnavali of Srinivasayogi gives a mantra. In case ypu have a link for the Hatharatnavali, can you please give the same.  
  
I wish some hathayoga expert from our list would tell us more about the above mantra . If this is esoteric I would welcome private mail.  

  

Regards,  

skb
