Thanks for the information. Is this Vedantaparibhashaa the same as the one authored by Dharmarajadhvarindra ? The author of Hatharatnaavali is a Navyanaiyayika and if he commented upon the works of Manikantha and Shashadhara who are pre-Gangesha Navyanyaya writers. Did he comment on the Nyayaratnam and Nyayasiddhantadipa by the above authors or some other texts ? Regards. SM
