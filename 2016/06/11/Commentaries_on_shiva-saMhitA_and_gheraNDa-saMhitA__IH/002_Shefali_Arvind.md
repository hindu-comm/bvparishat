Hari Om Misra ji,

  

Namaste!

  

Greetings from Chinmaya International Foundation!

  

CIF recently released a DVD set of lecture-series on Gheranda-samhita byProf. B. R. Sharma, Principal, Kaivalyadham, Lonavala, Pune, with detailed reading and explanation of the original Sanskrit. The lectures were recorded over a period of 2 weeks at Chinmaya International Foundation during the Yogo Bhavati Duhkhaha workshop held in January 2016. These DVDs are presented with a view to enhance learning through study of the original texts with well known experts.

  

You may click on<http://goo.gl/NXjqBZ> to purchase the DVDs.

  

CIF has also released DVDs on Patanjali's Yogasutra - Samadhipada. These are lecture-series by Prof. Madhusudan Penna recorded at the same workshop as above.

  

You may click on <http://goo.gl/XplNek>to purchase the DVDs.

  

However, we are also launching a special offer to celebrate the International Yoga Day and hence, there will be an offer on the DVDs beginning on June 15th.

  

Please let me know if you need any assistance.

  

Many thanks for your time.

  

In Shri Guru Seva,

Shefali
