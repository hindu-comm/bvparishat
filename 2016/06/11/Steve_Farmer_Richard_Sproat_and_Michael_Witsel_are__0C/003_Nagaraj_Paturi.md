I shared the same link as part of the thread

  

<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/bvparishat/$20Indus$20script$20deciphered$20as$20Old$20Sanskrit$3F%7Csort:relevance/bvparishat/iVU2No_sVlI/tmKsSAYbMgAJ>

Happy to see that it interested you too.

  

This scholar has beendoing interesting work on the Indus seals from the point of view that what we see on the seals are nonlinguistic symbols.

  

His earlier works are at

  

<https://independent.academia.edu/TomvanBakel>

  

In fact his approach is similar to that of Steve Farmer, Richard Sproat and Michael Witzel only in looking at the written shapes as nonlinguistic symbols.

  

In this paper he is citing, at the very beginning, the following words of the trio as his purvapaksha:

  

"A second collorary which is often invoked to support Hindu nationalist (Hindutva) ideas, is

the claim that Indus inscriptions embodied Hindu traditions or can even be identified with

(much later) Vedic texts."

He , in this article, argues that most of the seals depict the theme of Kumara or Subrahmanya.
