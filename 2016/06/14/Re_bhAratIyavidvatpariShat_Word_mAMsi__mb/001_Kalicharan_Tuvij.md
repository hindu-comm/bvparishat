Dr Joshi ji,  
  
I know that Sanskrit was like a river before getting regulated by Panini and other grammarians. Yet, a river also has a source, that ever remains the same. Sanskrit was revealed along-with the Veda.  
If we combine the last two sentences, it reads, "The source of Sanskrit is Veda." This means, the source has got deep structure, "is of divine nature" - as also argued by you in the BORI paper.  
  
Otherwise, as you write, Sanskrit would be just like any other language. Irrespective of how many geniuses worked its grammar, or whatever the claims of its adherents be. And the Veda would just be a primitive/ ritual text. In fact, as far as I know, most traditional Hindu scholars and Western scholars believe these to be true. Or may be I am terribly wrong here.

In the original post, I used the word सत् in the sense "the inflection power of a Sanskrit word." I have read old posts of Prof Korada also mentioning this word in similar contexts (i.e., grammar), but I couldn't understand if he means the same thing or other.  
  
सत् as a word is special: it is used both in inflected and the independent प्रातिपदिक (सत्) forms. So this makes सत् an अव्यय (as per the "criteria" set in my original post), apart from being employed in विभक्ति forms as well. Are there such more words?
