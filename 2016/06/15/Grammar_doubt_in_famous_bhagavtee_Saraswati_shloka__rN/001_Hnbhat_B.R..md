This doesnot change in feminine gender. But the word तनु is different. Amara itself gives short and long उ --- स्त्रियां तनुस्तनूः ( २-६-७१).

  

रामाश्रमी explains as per उणादि. १.७. भृमृशीतॄचरित्सरितनिधनिमिमस्जिभ्य उ:॥ "तनुः काये त्वचि स्त्री" इति विश्वमेदिन्यौ नान्तेषु and not सान्तेषु. and then separatey explains -अर्तिपॄवपियजितनिधनितपिभ्यो नित् ॥2-117 इत्यादिना उसि, "तनुः" सान्तोऽपि।

तनू is दीर्घन्त by ऊङ् from उकारान्त and not from सकारान्त.

Why change it? सकारान्त does not change form for feminine gender at all as वपूः at all as par as I know.
