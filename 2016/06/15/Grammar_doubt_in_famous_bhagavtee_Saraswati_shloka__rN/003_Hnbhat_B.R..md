I did not expect this question from a person asking the grammatical correctness of a form. In this case, it is असन्त, and as per ६.४.१४ अत्वसन्तस्य चाधातोः । the अकार which is उपधा, undergoes the change in सु and not in neuter gender. Under what सूत्र you expect वपुस् elongate the उपधा and make it change into वपूः?

That is why my remark it doesn't change as you suggested as वपूः. If find any सूत्र of Panini for changing उ in वपुस् into दीर्घ in सौ, I have no objection personally against Panini.
