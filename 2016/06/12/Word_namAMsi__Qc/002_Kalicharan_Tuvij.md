What is अव्यय ?  
  
Some personal observations:  
  
a) All inflected languages have shown a tendency, historically, in moving from a repertoire of inflected words to that of frozen words. Sanskrit-Prakrit is one example, Persian is another, English is another, and pretty much every other language that once was highly inflected.  
  
b) In this way, the प्रातिपदिक words, over the time, tend to lose their power ("of सत्") to inflect. They become, practically speaking, अव्यय.  
  
c) So when an आचार्य, say belonging to 500 B.C., says ".. this, this and this is अव्ययम्", it means that by 500 B.C. the words mentioned in the authoritative list had already become frozen as अव्ययानि in the prevalent शिष्ट प्रयोग.  
  
Does this mean that in pristine Sanskrit, that is देवभाषा, there are no अव्ययानि at all? In my opinion, there indeed are अव्ययानि in देवभाषा, and (avoiding a highly demanding formal definition) the following are very simple steps to finding them:  
  
1. An अव्यय is a प्रातिपदिक.  
2. An अव्यय can stand on its own.  
  
Examples :  
  
In any समास instance, e.g. नागकन्या, we have नाग in प्रातिपदिक form. So rule-1 is fulfilled. But नाग doesn't occur in this form independently in a Sanskrit sentence. So rule-2 isn't satisfied. Therefore नाग isn't अव्यय.  
  
Similarly, in नमस्कार, we have नमस् in प्रातिपदिक form, but नमस् is never found independently - so नमस् isn't अव्यय. In उपकार, उप is in प्रातिपदिक (what else?) form, alright, but उप never occurs independently, so isn't an अव्यय.  
  
समास instances use प्रातिपदिक forms for construction, but these प्रातिपदिक forms should not be confused with other प्रातिपदिक forms that can stand on their own and are therefore the "मूल-अव्ययानि" (retained even in Satyuga).
