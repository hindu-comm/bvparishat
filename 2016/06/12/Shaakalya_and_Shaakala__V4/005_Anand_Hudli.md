Information on this is scarce. There are some verses in the Vayu, Brahmanda, and Vishnu Puranas that speak of either Devamitra Shakalya or Vedamitra Shakalya and his five disciples. One possibility is that there was a Rishi called Shakala earlier and this Devamitra Shakalya came later. But this does not seem plausible. In fact, it could be that Shakalya was the earlier Rishi and Shakala was his disciple. Another possibility is that the Rigveda Samhitas complied by the five disciples of Shakalya came to be collectively known as Shakala Samhita, which is preserved to this day as the most commonly found Rigvedic rescension.

  

Anand
