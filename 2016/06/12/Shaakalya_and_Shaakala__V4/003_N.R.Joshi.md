Thanks Mr Anand Hudli. I appreciate your information.



I am still confused on Shaakalya and Shaakala.



Now Shaakala is recension of Rigveda like Baas'kala recension.

  
In the book of Dr. Satyakama Varma (p.35) I see three words--Shaakalyapitaa, Shaakalya and Shaakala.



Is there any relation between Shaakalya and Shaakala? Thanks. N.R.Joshi

According to the Rigvedic tradition, Devamitra Shakalya (देवमित्र शाकल्य or वेदमित्र शाकल्य) was a disciple in the lineage of Paila, whose name occurs as a Hotr (Rigvedic)priest in the rAjasUya yAga of Yudhishthira.



पैलो होता वसोः पुत्रो धौम्येन सहितोऽभवत् (Mahabharata Sabha Parva, adhyAya 36). Paila's name also occurs in Panini Sutra 2.4.59.



Shakalya himself had five disciples, Mudgala, Galava,Shaliya, Vatsya, andShaishiri, (मुद्गल, गालव, शालीय, वात्स्य, शैशिरि),who propagated the Shakalya Samhita of the Rigveda.
