Sudip ji,

  

There are indeed 3 books with the name "*vṛkṣāyurveda*" - 1). Surapāla - (this is on Agriculture) - published by both Asian Agri History Foundation and Chowkhamba, 2). Parāśara - (this is on Botany, edited by Dr. N.N.Sircar and Roma Sirkar) - published by Sri Satguru publications, a division of Indian Books center, Shakti Nagar, New Delhi, 3). śālihotra - (this in on Agriculture and Agronomy) - Several references of this book is found in Kerala ayurveda /botany articles with respect to"*vṛkṣāyurveda*", however I am unable to locate this book, even as a manuscript.

  

Regards

Krishnamurthi
