Bravo Dr. Patel. Great work as you always do. Will download when I get some time and comment on this.

  

Can you please confirm what all senses are covered (प्रकृत्यां, सनि, णिचि, यङि,यङ्लुकि, etc)  

  

Also, is there any estimate of the accuracy of the generated verb forms (e.g. 95% or 99%) or have they been cross-checked against a source like Dhaturupanandini?
