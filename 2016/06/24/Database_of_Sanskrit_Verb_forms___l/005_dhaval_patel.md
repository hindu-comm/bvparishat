As per the requests of members, a CSV file with `verbform,verb,lakAra,suffix,verbnumber` format is made available in Devanagari  
e.g. `अंसयति,अंस,लट्,तिप्,10.0460`.  
  

See [www.sanskritworld.in/public/sanskrittool/SanskritVerb/generatedforms/verbformsdeva.tar.gz](http://www.sanskritworld.in/public/sanskrittool/SanskritVerb/generatedforms/verbformsdeva.tar.gz)  
  

The verb number is consciously not changed to Devanagari, so that it is amenable to easy machine handling.
