Madhav Ji,  
  
Your poem has a deep-seated thread of implicit comment on what we call 'modernisation of our cities and our life'.  

  
पिझ्झागृहं नाट्यगृहं नृत्यस्थानं सुरापणम्  
  

contrasts with the Hanuman and Ganesh temples.  
  

Sir, your poem is reminiscent of the cognitive dissonance one feels on meeting a man after several decades whom one had known as an innocent person of simple habits and now finds transformed into a moustached man with the 'belly of prosperity' smelling of liquor and talking nothing but utilitarianism.  
  

A great poem! Is it funny? Is it serious? Or is it both? Be it what it may be, it is certainly very relevant for a Group that strives to maintain ancient culture and ancient values through popularisation of Dev-Bhasha.  
  

Regards,  

Dogra, Chennai
