People, who are my age and have continuously lived in Pune, have gradually adapted to the changes in the languages and the very physical extension of the city. Pune in 1968 had a population of 500,000, while it is now more than ten times that number, and it has physically expanded for miles in every direction, gobbling up villages and farm land all around.  Since I left Pune in 1968, I have lived continuously in the US since then, and hence my Marathi and familiarity with \[the old\] Pune has remained almost frozen in time. That is what drives my reactions to Pune during my visit, expressed in my Sanskrit poems.
