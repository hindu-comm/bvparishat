Namaste,  
  

During the ast three decades, there does not seem to have been great change in the Puneri Marathi, supposed to be the purest form of Marathi, like Khari-Boli in case of Hindi, but Prof. Deshpande is talking of the situation some six decades ago. Probably a lot of changes started occurring during the 1970s and 1980s.
