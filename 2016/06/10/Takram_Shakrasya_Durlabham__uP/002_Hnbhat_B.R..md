This and similar ones are found in the सुभाषितरत्नभाण्दागार if Kashinath Sharma, page 196, verse No.5.

  

The translation provided in some website as follows:

  

"This is a special one: the last pada / line answers all the questions in the three padas/lines.. but at the same time makes **wierd sentences**.what is to be had at the end of meal ? ( curds )whose son is jayantha? ( Lord Indra )How does one attain vishnu padam? ( not available )"

  

The final line combines all these and says "Curds are not available to Lord Indra" - which is wierd that Indra being the king of Gods, is deprived of Curds..

  

  

तक्र is not curd, but butter-milk. शक्र means Indra. The sentence butter milk is not available to Indra. The solution is Gods drink nectar (अमृत) and do not use milk or butter milk, which is availble on earth.
