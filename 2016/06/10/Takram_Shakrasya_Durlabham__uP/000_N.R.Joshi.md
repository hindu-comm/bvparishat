Respected scholars, Namaskar!



Takram Shakrasya durlabham is part of some subhashitam.



Now Shakra means Indra. So what the subhashitam is saying about Indra?

Does shakra mean churning stick or butteraccumulating near the churning stick?



Please kindly explain posting the whole subhashitam if possible.

Thanks. N.R.Joshi
