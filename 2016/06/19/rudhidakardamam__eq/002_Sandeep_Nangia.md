Well, obviously scriptures differ in their instructions and are sometimes contradictory based on the station and mental makeup of sadhakas.  
  
I believe, as part of Durga Puja, the animal sacrifices involves creating नवव्यङ्गरुधिरकर्दमम् as an offering to Durga. Perhaps it is there in some Tantra. Looking for the specific reference.
