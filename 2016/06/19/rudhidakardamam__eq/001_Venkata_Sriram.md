Namaste,

  

I think, it should be "रुधिरकदॅमम्". Padma Purana has the following shloka that condemns "pashu-himsa" in yajna as:

  

यज्ञं कृत्वा पशुं हत्वा कृत्वा**रुधिरकदॅमम्** ।

यद्येवं गम्यते स्वर्गो नरकं केन गम्यते ॥ (पद्मपुराण, सृष्टिखण्ड १३।३२३)

  

The meaning:

  

If the result of animal slaughter and bloodshed in sacrifice is attainment of heaven, then who will go to hell !

  

This is a sort of satirical remark against the pashu-himsa in sacrifice

  

Don't know in what way it is related to your question w.r.t to Durga Puja. 

  

regs,

sriram
