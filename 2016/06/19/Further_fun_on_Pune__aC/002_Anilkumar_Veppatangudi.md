With apologies for not having the proficiency to compose in Sanskrit

  

Miraculous are your powers, O Madhava!

The cacophony of dogs and loudspeakers

The sights of sleepy-eyed children and busy office-goers

Which hardly bothered Bala Madhava in Pune

Have magnified thousand-fold

After 50 years in the land of the brave, USA.

  

This certainly is meant to be fun.
