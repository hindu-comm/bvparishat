Dear Sri Narendra Dutt Ji!

Thanks for correcting me. I admit my mistake. You are right. Sorry for my mistake also.

Prof. Joshiji! I am sorry for wrongly translating the content. As corrected by Sri Narendra Dutt Ji -

1\. If it is less by one syllable than the required number of syllables it is Nchrd.

2\. If it is in excess of one syllable than the required number of syllables it is Bhurik.

3\. If it is less by two syllables than the required number of syllables it is Viraat.

4\. If it is in excess of two syllables than the required number of syllables it is Svarat.

Once again thanks to Narendra Dutt ji for correcting me and sorry to Prof. Joshi ji for my mistake in interpretation.

Warm regards,

**Prof. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
