Namaskar Dr. Murty Ji

Please check the diffinition of Nicrid, Bhoorig, Swarata and Virata. Nichrid means one syllable is sort than the required Number. The same way one syllable is access than the required number. Swarata means two syllable is sort than the required number and Virata means two syllable is access than the required number.

Thanks
