Respected scholars, Namakar!

What is meant by SvaraaTa and ViraaTa ? Are these names of Chandas? If yes, of how many syllables?

I read in one book that GaayatrI chandas is also called raaT. Is this true?

Also what is meant by EkaraaTa? Is it name of a chandas? If yes, of how many syllables? Thanks . N.R.Joshi
