Dear friends,  
  

I have a query. I remember reading a verse which has the following part "shataM panchadashottaram", which has been translated by some as 115. It appears that some others think the translation should actually be 510, corresponding to "shataM pancha dashottaram". It will be kind of you if you can look at this and offer your valuable suggestions.  
  

Regards,
