Pujya Damodara Das Ji,  
  
Good article and balanced one. My two questions:  
  
1) How & who will judge a person 'X" (belonging to 4th varna / dalit / harijan ???) is having the qualities of brAhmaNa  
2) If such an 'X' is identified, then can he be invested with yajnopaveetam and be initiated with gAyatri mantra and make him study shruti-s (samhita, brAhmaNa, AraNyaka & upaniSad)  
  
As for the 2nd one, several social reformers like Srirama Sharma Acharya (of gAyatri parivaar), Sri.Bankupalli Mallayya Sastry Garu (of Urlam Agraharam), Sri.Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni, to name a few, have initiated harijans into gAyatri japa.  
  
Sri.Bankupalli Mallayya Sastry Garu was a great vedic scholar who a srividya upAsaka and lived in Urlam Agraharam of Srikakulam district in early 19th century. He was also a vedic scholar who translated sAyaNa bhASya of all 4 vedas into telugu. He championed for widow re-marriage and opposed child marriage. He also initiated several harijans into gAyatri mantra japa. The result is that he was ostracized from brahmin community in Urlam agraharam. He had to move out of the village. During his last days, he spent most of his time with harijans & dalits. When he passed away, none came for his antyESti except harijans who performed his last rites.  
  
Similarly, Ganapati Muni also faced ire from orthodox brahmin community for his revolutionary ideas like widow remarriage, abolishing child marriage etc. He initiated "Indra Vidya" and invested couple of non-brahmins into vedic lore. His own wife Smt.Visalakshi used to worship "Agni".  
  
So, these stray examples I have shown just to say that whether decision of varNa by jAti or guNa was a debatable issue among scholars also.
