Namaste,

Lord Ram killed Shambuka not just because he was a shudra, but for running away from his assigned duty.of paricharya, and for which a sick boy died. I may be corrected if I am wrong  

  

////

  

The shambhuka's story is very clearly mentioned in rAmAyaNa provided one studies it.

  

शूद्रयोन्यां प्रजातोऽस्मि तप उग्रं समास्थितः ।

देवत्वं प्रार्थये राम **सशरीरो** महायशः ॥ (उत्त० का० ७६.२)

  

The purpose of Shambhuka's tapasya is to achieve dEvatvaM in swarga with the same physical, gross

body which he is possessing now.

  

Hence, the punishment. The same tapasya was done by King Trishanku. 

  

However, pls note that the tribal woman "shabari" (who was also a shudra) was given the "uttama-loka"

by Sriramachandra. The so-called leftists and dalit intellectuals highlight the former and don't even

mention the later case.

  

We need to analyze after proper study.

  

regs,

Sriram
