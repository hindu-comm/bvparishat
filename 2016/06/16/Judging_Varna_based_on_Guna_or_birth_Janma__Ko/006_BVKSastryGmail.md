Namaste  
  
The mute issue of 'Varna-tag' for an individual, by Samskara or by 'Birth' is discussed for centuries without coming to any decisive conclusions. The debaters on both sides have ammunition from the same sources and in the same language called 'Samskrutham' ! yet ' the best of the brains (rishayo vibhinnaH) are not able to come to one (eka-Vakyataa or Siddhanta) conclusion?!  
  
Looking at this from another perspective, 'the best of the brains' have not been able to throw out the ' contentious' concept of 'Varna', the primary issue itself before adding the next level of deliberations and add criterion (like Birth or rites : Janmanaa -Samskarena) and on the top of it add 'Purificatory rites (Praayaschitta Vidhi) and privileges and obligations ( Varna-Adhikaara for Vedas and Samskara, Agama practice yet all).  
  
In other words, the scriptural theory documents associated with 'Varna' tag, has a ' checkered 'history' allowing itself for flexible interpretation' and creating a 'Social implication' for the practice of 'Dharma' !  
  
The primary introduction of the concept of 'Varna' comes in the grandiose of Purusha Sukta, where all Varnas are part of Divine Supreme, part of Vishwaroopa. And this text has been sufficnelty maligned and abused ! Later on the 'Rishi' status of many illustrious personalities (Valmiki, Vyasa, including Sri Krishna) does not fit snugly as one would expect to the 'later understanding of ' Varna' by birth and actions! Yet they are worshipped by 'Brahmana's'! It would be point for the non-brahmin community to think why they do not worship and practice 'Vyasa's teachings', who technically, in post colonial frame of interpretation, is a person with an identity by a cross parentage and ' non-standard, marriage mode' ?! And come to Gita, the criterion of 'Varna' by 'Guna-Karma-Swabhava' does not introduce the ' birth -parentage criterion'! Then does it take away the ' birth criterion' for 'Varna-identification'- ? Absolutely No! The parameters set for 'Brahma-Karma-Swabhava' demand a ' Brahmana parentage- lineage and social up-bringing mentoring and environment along with the other (75%) members of society practicing their ' Prescribed / suggested Dharma'. Some where in a side stream of 'Dharma-Shaastra'and 'Artha -Shaastra', the guidelines for human relations by marriage and parental responsibility for the off springs ( including Identity- inheritance) are debated. These do not overrule the Vedic Authority or Gita guidelines; but point out ' contextualized guidance for practice of 'Dharma' and carry a social identity by 'Varna'!  
  
Come later the Buddhists and Jains bring in a new model of social identity and paradigms for social practice of a philosophical thought provided by the Masters. Neither Buddha or Mahaver Jain created or promulgated any new concept of 'Varna' ! Thought their teachings and social institutions created a flavored model of 'Varna-Ashrama practice'. The words like 'Brahmana-Shramanaka' come up leading to a debate of ' what is Brahmanatva? Can a dog loose its dogging 'dog-genus', when its tail is cut off? ' Later on 'Vedantacharya's introduce 'Vedanta-flavors in the practical formats of observing Varna-Ashrama and Pooja Paddhati ( by flavoring the worship of Gods with aagama and Puranas). Even this neither replaced, rejected or defined conclusively the 'Varna' identity in any better terms that it was for centuries before ! And Dharma Shaastra karas from Manu to Gautma, Yajnavalkya held the unified criterion of 'Birth and Samskara' for 'Varna' decision. The only loose end of this criterion being: How did the Parents maintain their 'own Varna-Status' by compliance to Samskara and Janma- criterion? OR dod they have any Prayaschotta system recommended right from earlier times of Manu to restore a 'Varna status- a reboot reset process' ? ( which suffered as an institutionalized practice of making ( sufficient ?!) money a substitute ( pratyaamnaaya) for ' sin-expiation and status restoration ? Very similar to club membership renewal by payment of dues and subscription for current period ? And this made 'Varna' almost similar to the practice of ' renewal of a lapsed policy' without asking the question of 'first fall' and ' exploring reason for it' ?  
  
In this background, the question to ponder is the ' authority and competence ( with all due respects to the great Sri Krishna Devotees they were) of Jīva Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī in their commentaries on Bhaktirasāmṛtasindhu and Haribhaktivilāsa to have supported Brāhmaṇatva by birth ? Were they blending the 'Gita thought and Social practices using 'Dharma-Shaastra' for a ' local need'? The post line \< How the neo-Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava-s reconcile the new view with the old views expressed by Jīva Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī is a moot question> needs an answer from the background explained above.  
  
Looking for views of learned scholars.
