This may be your opinion, but is certainly not what the commentary by Jiva Gosvami seems to suggest. In the absence of any qualifier like ‘sāvitra’, the term ‘janma’ in itself means physical birth and ‘janmāntara’ means ‘another birth’ (‘janmāntara’ is a common term used for rebirth). The natural and straightforward interpretation of ‘janmāntarāpekṣā vartate’ by Jiva Gosvami is ‘there is an expectation of another birth’. To interpret ‘janmāntarāpekṣā vartate’ otherwise would be a far stretch. Moreover, your comment on the ‘upamāna’ is irrelevant.

  

I have attached images of Hindi translation of Durgamasangamini published by Achyuta Granthamala, Kashi.

  

Perhaps you want to translate the commentary word-by-word or cite a translation (preferably an unbiased translation) in support of your interpretation.

It is not uncommon for commentators in the same tradition to differ on one topic. We are better of sticking to the Durgamasangamini. If Visvanatha Cakravarti has specifically commented on Durgamasangamini, it is not relevant in understanding or discussing the position of Jiva Gosvami.
