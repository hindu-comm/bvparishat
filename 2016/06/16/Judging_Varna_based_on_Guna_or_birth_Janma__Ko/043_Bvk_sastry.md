Namaste Kannan ji

  

You brought in diversity to the debate here. Here are very specific observations on ' down slide of Ayurveda, when it is stripped from Yoga- Samskrutham native tradition and drained out of its vedic essence. In short, current Ayurveda needs a ' Upa-Nayana' to restore its ' Veda- adhikara' and ' Varna-Yoga- Yogyataa'.

  

  

Ayurveda works ( Charaka - 300 BCE or earlier ) has specific statement that ' A learned practitioner of Ayurveda , irrespective of his birth varna-jaati is to be treated as a ' Brahmana'. 

  

This part has been misconstrued in Social Equal -Opportunity model Education system as ' Oppressive brahmincal control on practice of medicine for public health, by holding the texts tightly under the wraps of Yoga-Samskrutham and Veda'.

  

Looking to historical continuing practice of Ayurveda-Charaka tradition till date, There are ' Jaangid' Brahmanas whose community facilities are alive and socially functional in Haridwar. These communities trace their history to be ' the community which acquired brahmana -varna status through Ayurveda practice as a root model,and acquiring specialization in Ayurveda pharmacology, by fetching forest ingredients to prepare medicines. Jaangid is 'jaangala'- connected to forest and mountains. More study needed. The social dynamics of Varna- status , presented in Daivee-Vaak is not so simple.

  

I am not aware of any current Ayurveda school (- at least three hundred years) raising their education-output to this level. Nor have i been updated of any surviving indian or modern or international Ayurveda training ( and degree granting ) institutions to have duly accommodated Yoga- Samskrutham- and Veda , as prescribed by Charaka- Sushruta-Vagbhata, in their training system and pedagogy.

The literal ' wombing' as a process of ' birth' is neither a ' clothe wrap' simulating the womb , nor a ' water- dip' like baptization!

And todays process has no ' design, purpose, pedagogy' to seek Brahma, be a Sa-Varna-lingee, or be a practitioner of ' Brahma-Charyaa'.

  

When the traditional Sanskrit text and words have lost their life in the social dynamics, the battle for Sanskrit needs to go more mileage than ' diagnostics and postmortem'.

I hope that the Sanskrit: Poorvapaksha conference will address this issue.
