Namaste,  
  

One should not take a simplistic view of a not so simple issue. Firstly we must recognize that the births are not accidental, as these depend on the karma of the previous births. Secondly, the earliest law-giver Manu tells us that a brahman by birth alone is not qualified to be called brahman. Thirdly, one who is not brahman by birth can also become brahman through one's conduct and efforts coupled with the grace of a sadguru. These are the sort of guidelines one has to follow to understand the issue.  
  

Regards,
