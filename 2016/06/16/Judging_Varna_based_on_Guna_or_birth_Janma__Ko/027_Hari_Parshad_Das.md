You have written three separate emails. I will answer them all in one here.  
  

I have written there clearly that Sri Jiva Goswami has said "sāvitra-janmāpekṣāvad asya janmāntarāpekṣā" — His janmāntara is expected just as sāvitra-janmāntara is expected for the boys. I do not think it gets clearer than this. The very term "sāvitra-janmāpekṣāvat" indicates that the cāṇḍāla does not have to take another physical body. It is not simply "janmāntara". It is "sāvitra-janmā-vaj janmāntara". Therefore the translation published by Achyuta-granthamālā is not correct here. The translation given there has overstretched the meaning of "janmāntara" as "śaukra-sāvitra-janmāntara", which is not what Sri Jiva is saying there. Moreover, such an overstretched translation also assumes that Sri Jiva has a view opposing to Srila Sanatana Goswami (his own guru). This is something not acceptable to those who are faithful to the sampradāya. Scholars who are unaffiliated to the paramparā may say that Sri Jiva is speaking against what Sri Sanatana wrote in Hari-bhakti-vilāsa but such opinions are not taken seriously by the active practitioners of the sampradāya.

As far as the Gaudiya Vaishnava sampradāya is concerned, Srila Vishwanath Chakravarti's opinion cannot be kept aside like this. There is another commentator on the Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhuḥ named Mukunda Das Goswami, who while commenting on this verse says,  
  
śvādo yato’nyo nīco nāsti so’pi kalpate samartho bhavati sadyas tasminn eva kṣaṇe vaidharmye brāhmaṇasya surāpāne sadyaḥ pātityavan nāticitram idam  
  

All these commentators have commented only after reading the commentary of Sri Jiva. It is not that they are speaking against what he has written. They are simply clarifying that what he has written is to be understood properly, otherwise someone may misunderstand that although bhakti can elevate one to vaikuntha, it cannot make one qualified to be a brahmana. It should also be noted that no commentary by any Gaudiya Vaishnava speaks against the understanding given by Sri Vishwanath and Sri Mukunda Das. So if Achyuta Granthamala has interpreted it in another way, it is mainly due to them not being active practitioners of the tradition and due to misunderstanding the actual import of the commentary.  
  

Also your latest email,

I have quoted Mukunda Das Goswami above who is not from the ISKCON/Gaudiya Math tradition. That should be sufficient proof enough. Also the fact that none of the Sanskrit commentators have spoken against these commentaries.

This opinion that the followers of Advaita Acharya were orthodox and more dominant is incorrectly derived without giving any reference. The truth is that such followers who supported orthodoxy were rejected during the very presence of Sri Jiva and Sri Krishnadas Kaviraj (author of Caitanya-caritamrita). You can see CC Adi 12.71 for the same. Advaita Acharya himself invited Haridasa Thakur (a yavana by birth but a pure vaishnava) at the sraddha of his father instead of inviting smarta-brahmanas, most of whom were not favorable to the vaishnavas.

I would disagree that Varnashram was well in place 500 years ago. One can see clearly in the writings of other paramparās (such as Sri Tulasidas) that those were extremely troubled times. I think you are better aware than me of these writings.
