Please quote the specific meaning of SKD you have in mind (with examples, if any) and also show how it contradicts my statement that *‘the word janmāntara is used in the sense of next/future/another physical birth and not for upanayana’*. Additional meanings may be possible, and I do not deny them. But is the word used specifically for upanayana (=sāvitra janma) as per the SKD?

I said any other scholarly translations of the Durgamasangamini. It does not appear that the attached snapshot is from a translation the Durgamasangamini. An interpretation of the original text based on a commentary is very different from a translation of a commentary, is it not?

How does your observation contradict the translation of a specific passage of Durgamasangamini? It would be good to see other scholarly translations of Durgamasangamini: that is all I am saying. Moreover, can we rule out the chance that the author of the Achyuta Granthamala translation was familiar with works of Jiva Gosvami?

  

As I said, specific citations/alternate scholarly translations, and not general statements, would help the discussion.

Bandyopadhyay says *followers*, and not *descendants* on page 83 of‘Caste, Culture and Hegemony: Social Dominance in Colonial Bengal’. I have not seen Dimock's work. Does Dimock say descendants? Can you please share the cited by Bandyopadhyay from Dimock?
