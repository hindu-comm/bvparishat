There is nothing called sāvitra-janmāntara (another sāvitra birth) as far as I know.Sāvitra birth is only once in life, and for anothersāvitra birth there must be another physical birth.

  

Anyway, can you cite a source to back your interpretation? Any other authentic translation?

  

The other arguments of going against Guru and all and active practitioners are besides the point.
