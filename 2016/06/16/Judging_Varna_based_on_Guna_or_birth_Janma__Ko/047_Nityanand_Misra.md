I think the discussion on the meanings of *dvija* has led the thread to digress far away from the topic. Probably a new thread can be started on the same. Let me bring back the focus on the position of Jiva Gosvami on varna (brahmanatva) based on birth.

  

I would like to submit a clarification to an earlier reference, and another reference.

  

Firstly, the Hindi translation of Durgamasangamini that I had referred to is not form an Achyuta Granthamala publication from Kashi, but from a publication of multiple commentaries on Bhaktirasamrtasindhu with their Hindi translations by Gadadgara-gaurahari Press in Vrindavan. What is more, the Hindi translation is by none other than the late Vidyaratna Haridasa Shastri, probably the most prolific and erudite scholar in the Gaudiya Vaisnava tradition in recent times. I am attaching the images of title page of the work and two pages in which Haridasa Shastri Ji's translation of Durgamasangamini clearly interprets Jiva Gosvami's commentary as stating that (another) physical birth is required for savana (in other words,Haridasa Shastri Ji sees Jiva Gosvami's commentary as supporting varna based on birth). This correction and publication details will hopefully answer the speculation that the author of the Hindi commentary did not know or was not a practitioner of the Gaudiya Vaisnava tradition.

  

The other reference is Shyamlal Hakim's summary of the position of Jiva Gosvami. He also interprets Jiva Gosvami's to say that a candala needs another physical birth to be able to perform havana. I do not have full details of Shyamlal Hakim.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
