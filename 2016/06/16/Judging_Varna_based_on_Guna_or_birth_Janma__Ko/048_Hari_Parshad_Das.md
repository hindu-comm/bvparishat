The discussion was about the following point you made earlier:

In this regard I have already shown that Sri Sanatana Goswami is of the opinion of varna by symptoms. I cited the Hari-bhakti-vilāsa commentary in support of that.

That's a good appeal to authority but it should be noted that there have been many prolific Gaudiya Vaishnava scholars with various accolades bestowed on them even before Sri Haridas Shastriji. I don't know if you've heard of Ramnarayan Vidyaratna, Puridas or Sundarananda Vidyavinoda. Of course, this is not to undermine Sri Haridas Shastrijis achievements in any way. Sri Haridas Shastriji is a great vaishnava who dedicated his life for serving Go-mātā and Govinda and my sincere pranams to him but I just wanted to make a point that the sampradāya has other dedicated and respected vidvāns too (like Sri Mukunda Goswami, who believes that the dog-eater is immediately eligible for a soma-yajña and whose commentary was faithfully translated by Sri Haridas Shastriji).  
  

And I have already said that its not only vidvans within Gaudiya Vaishnava Sampradaya who support such a view. I have also stated earlier that brahminism by qualities has been advocated in the Ramanandi Sampradaya too, and I have already cited Sri Vallabhacharya's commentary on the same verse.  
  

Also by the way, i'm not sure if you saw one of my uploads previously but I had uploaded a book named "Hindu-dharma-rahasyam vā Sarva-dharma-samanvayaḥ" which was published by Sri Haridas Shastriji himself. You can see clear support for varnas based on quality rather than birth in that book (URL: <https://archive.org/details/hindudharmarahasyam> ). Now this shows the dynamic nature of the personality of Sri Haridas Shastriji. This book is a clear proof that he was open to other viewpoints which are logical.

As I have stated earlier, Srila Jiva Goswami says clearly that the entire verse is in context of a person who is currently eating meat. Using this verse to say that Srila Jiva Goswami does not support brahminism by birth even for a person who has given up meat eating and is practicing principles of vaishnavism in a modern day Gaudiya Vaishnava institution is a clear case of misapplication.

I have his details and i asked a friend about his translation but even Shri Shyamlal Hakimji agrees that Srila Jiva Goswami is speaking about a person who is currently eating dog-meat. Both these personalities (Sri Haridas Shastriji and Shri Shyamlal Hakim) have agreed on this point. So I do not see what logic one can employ to apply this commentary of Sri Jiva on an initiated vaishnava who has given up meat eating way before diksha.  
  

As I said earlier there are two completely different contexts —  
  

\(a\) One who occasionally chants Harināma and is currently habituated to eating dog-meat.  
  

\(b\) One who has given up meat eating long ago, taken up the nine-fold process of hari-bhakti and is chanting regularly.  
  

I would like to see quotes on the non-brahminism for case (b) by Srila Jiva Goswami or by any other among the six Goswamis of Vrindavan.
