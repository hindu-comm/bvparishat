Okay. Let's agree on the point that it may have been a typo in the SKD. The term 'antara' also means 'intermediate' (avadhi). So in that sense, it is definitely possible that janmāntara can refer to an intermediate birth within the same janma. I agree as you said that this meaning tends to be metaphorical rather than literal.  
  

Lets come back to the original point now. The original point was regarding the justification of the views modern Gaudiya Vaishnava institutions in comparison to the original Gosvāmīs such as Sri Jiva. I can also very comfortably say that this entire verse about 'dog-eater' does not apply in the context of an initiated vaishnava within a modern day Gaudiya Vaishnava institution.  
  

Why?  
  

Srila Jiva Goswami himself in the commentary has said (you can see the translation in the Achyutmala edition) that this verse is referring to a person who is "Currently eating dog-meat". This certainly cannot be applied to an initiated vaishnava who has given up habits like meat-eating way before initiation. So, to say that Srila Jiva Goswami does not support brahminism even for an initiated vaishnava who is now reformed and to quote this verse in support of one's understanding is again incorrect. For an initiated vaishnava who has given up meat-eating, the context is completely different and for an uninitiated dog-meat-eater who is sometimes chanting the names of the Lord, the context is completely different. So even if it is agreed that janmāntara means "next birth", this cannot be applied to a person who is initiated and not eating meat.  
  

If you have any other pramana from the six-Goswamis regarding the non-brahminism of an initiated vaishnava, that would also be interesting to look at.

Definitely he has mentioned Sri Jivas commentary many places in his version. It is not a word-to-word translation of Sri Jiva, that I agree, but then even if you take a scholarly edition, the comment i have given just above this (regarding the non-application to an initiated vaishnava) still stays.

The entire discussion is about traditional Gaudiyas and Modern Gaudiya Institutions. It is not about what Bandyopadhyay thinks. The traditional Gaudiyas do not take CC with a pinch of salt. At least i have not seen any traditional gaudiya vaishnava say this.
