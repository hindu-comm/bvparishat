Once again, you are squarely missing the context of the Durgama-sangamani. NOWHERE does it speak of an initiated vaishnava and it is merely speaking of a person who is currently habituated to eating meat. If you want to extrapolate it and use it to think that it applies also to those who are not currently eating meat, that is up to you. I do not have to convince you in this regard. If Srila Jiva Goswami's clear statement about "currently eating meat" is not acceptable to you and you want to include all initiated vaishnavas in it too, then it may be your interpretation which is not acceptable to many others (including Srila Sanatana Goswami).

Again an overstretch and misapplication of a verse which is clearly not speaking about an initiated vaishnava. Once again, if you can find anyone of authority in Gaudiya Vaishnava philosophy who claims that this commentary by Sri Jiva is speaking about an initiated vaishnava, please let me know. Otherwise I am fine and okay if you want to assume that it applies to an initiated vaishnava too. As i said earlier, such assumptions do not change the fact that Sri Jiva wrote the entire commentary for a person who is currently eating meat.

Thank you. Once again I say that all Goswamis of Gaudiya Vaishnavism are theoretically in support of the view taken by the modern Gaudiya institutions. Sri Jiva too has never spoken a word about a vaishnava being disqualified for anything. Here is a brilliant conclusion from the Hari-bhakti-vilāsa:  
  
***ato niṣedhakaṁ yad yad vacanaṁ śrūyate sphuṭam  
avaiṣṇava-paraṁ tat tad vijñeyaṁ tattva-darśibhiḥ***  
  

**Translation**: Therefore, wherever restrictive statements are seen clearly \[in the śāstra\], those respective statements are seen as applicable to non-vaiṣṇavas by the tattva-darśīs.  
  

For the Gaudiya Vaishnavas, Sri Jiva Goswami is a tattva-darśī and he has read these statements from the Hari-bhakti-vilāsa. He has read all the books and notes of Sri Gopal Bhatta Goswami. Those who have read his books cover to cover know that he has never spoken a word about the disqualification of vaishnavas. You may try as much as you want to show that Sri Jiva supports varṇa by birth for the vaishnavas, but in the end you will end up hitting a wall.  
  

The teachings of Srila Sanatana Goswami are "specifically" in regards to initiated vaishnavas whereas the teachings of Sri Jiva are about a dog-meat eater who is still eating meat. Any intelligent person can understand which teaching is applicable to an initiated vaishnava in a modern day Gaudiya Vaishnava institution.
