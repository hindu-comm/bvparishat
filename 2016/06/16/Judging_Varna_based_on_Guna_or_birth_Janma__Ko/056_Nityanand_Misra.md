It is the *general idea* of *kaimutya*/*a fortiori logic* that the strong/extreme example applies to weaker/less extreme examples also. One may refer Avi Sion (2013), *A Fortiori Logic: Innovations, History and Assessments*, pp. 323-324 for details. The specific interpretation of Haridas Shastri (*what to speak of* ...) does not contradict the general idea of *kaimutya/a fortiori logic*. In fact it is consistent with the general idea.

At least you partly agree with me when you say that Jīva Gosvāmī assumes *varṇa* by birth for meat eating *cāṇḍāla*-s. But one big problem still remains: *brāhmaṇānāṃ śaukraṃ janma*. *śaukraṃ janma* of a *brāhmaṇā* is not possible if one does not assume *varṇa* by birth. And if one assumes *varṇa* by birth for both a *brāhmaṇā* and a *cāṇḍāla*, then what else is left to assume as regards to *varṇa* by birth? Does Jīva Gosvāmī have a position which is neither here (*varṇa* by birth) not there (*varṇa* by*guṇa*)?

Thanks for pointing this out, but my point still remains: his comments are not from a sub-commentary on Jīva Gosvāmī's DS (commentary on the BRS). So they are irrelevant in understanding the passage in question in the DS?

Please read my comment above. You are confusing two different things:

\(1\) my general statement on kaimutya

\(2\) my interpretation that Jīva Gosvāmī in the passage on upholds brāhmaṇatva (and by imolication varṇa) by birth

The latter is backed by two published sources (Haridas Shastri and Shyamlal Hakim). The former is a general statement.
