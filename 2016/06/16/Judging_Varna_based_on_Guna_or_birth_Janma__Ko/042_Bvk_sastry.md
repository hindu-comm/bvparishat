Namaste

  

I have greater difficulty in understanding your second explanation than the original statement!

> 
> > 

**BVK Sastry (on commonly used-1)**: the common word/ literary and social usage like द्विज- द्विज श्रेष्ठ- द्विजोत्तम have social usage focussed on Brahmanas with a birth- Profession- learning- practice (including the dress code , the sacred thread wearing, and facial mark). Example : The conversation in the dramas of Bhasa , The conversation of Karna and Aswatthama in Venisamhara.

  

No reader has confused the 'Dharma-Shaastra technicality of Upanayana-Samskara ( derogatorily 

Pointing to tuft and janivu/ yajnopaveetam wearing by Dvija- Brahmana' ) with an equal-measure application to rest of the varnas.

  

The depiction of Ramayana and Mahabharata characters on Television serials ( Rama and Krishna included , with a yajnopaveeta) has not masked social- memory belongingness to other varna ! True , brahmanas worship and meditate on Sri Rama, Sri Krishna as Avataara of Sri Hari; but that has not made any change in their \< belonging to human society and specific varnas>. Is their any popular usage of putting Sri Rama, Sri Krishna as ' dvijas'? Beyond their wide perception as ' ksatriya/ yaadava'? Did Parashurama, described as ' kshatriyaantaka-Rama'- the slayer of (- ill behaved) Kshatriyas make him a ' dvija- brahmana hantaa'?!

**BVK Sastry (on explain the usage-1)**: ' Upanayana as second birth, is a metaphoric usage. The vidhivakya (- as i know; and subject to correction by learned) for upanayana serves two purposes:

  

The entry in to the club where the first lessons to learn vedas are provided. In other words, if one is familiar with the design and teaching of Gurukula in vedic model, the initiate boy learns two things: the classical Sanskrit , prayers providing foundation for advancing towards vedic learning. Second is route learning of text of veda by listen- repeat - parroting to get firm memory.

This traditional model has suffered deep damage in in many Indian gurukuls aiming to make ' instant purohitas ' for social needs is a historical aberration. The greater damaging adversary is the ' social Equality - Equal access and opportunity Argument' which pushed Social learning of Vedas as Vedanta courses and Evening entertainers in the name of Satsang!

  

Both these aberration models provide a ' downgraded rebirth' (adho- gacchanti) path, in Gita words. As this post is not for addressing historic social aberration and promoters of it, i stop further elaboration here.

**BVK Sastry (on conventionally used -1)**: i have explained what is conventional usage point above. The social language user ( especially women in frustration) express- ' enough for this life; not for seven more lives'. Language change has not caused any change in communication . Beyond Hindus, the anglicised form of this expression is ' in another life'- even though theologically the religion does not see beyond one life.

**BVK Sastry (on Kosha listing- 1)**:

Let us put the question differently: is there any kosha which says dvija can be used for a kshatriya or vaishya or ' limited sense usage for a shudra' ? The classical usage of term has been to point to Brahmanas with brahmana-achaaras.

**BVK Sastry (on some more words to contemplate-1)**:

पुनर्भवं परिगत-शक्तिरात्म भू:

  

मा भूत् जन्मजन्मान्तरेपि

These are popular usages and don't need any source pointer to scholars.
