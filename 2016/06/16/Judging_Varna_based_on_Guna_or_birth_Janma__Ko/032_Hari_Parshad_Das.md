Please go through all meanings of 'janmāntara' from Shabda-kalpa-druma.

It seems that you have not read all the meanings of the term 'janmāntara'. You can refer to the Shabda-kalpadruma for the same.

I have attached Dr. Nagendra's translation and interpretation which is based on the commentary of Sri Jiva.

In my reading of Sri Jiva Goswami's works i have never seen him say anywhere that a vaishnava is unqualified to be a brahmana if he is not born in a specific kula. If you have any such evidence i will be glad to have a look at it.

It is referring to the descendants of Advaita Acharya himself (The Shantipur Goswamis) who are mentioned in Dimock's book on page number 68. Let me know if it is referring to someone else.
