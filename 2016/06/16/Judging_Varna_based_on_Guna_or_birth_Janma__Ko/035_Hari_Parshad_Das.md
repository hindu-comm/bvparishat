The SKD gives 'bhAvAntara' as one meaning given in the Amara-kosha. In this sense, it can refer to a change of samskaras in the same life.

How do you assume that the six editor team under Dr. Nagendra not read Sri Jiva's commentary before writing their comments? If you do not want to agree even after sharing a scholarly edition, then i do not have to pursue this further. Show me the commentary referred to by Dr. Nagendra while making his comments and then we can continue on this. Else i have no issues if you want to assume without proof that Dr. Nagendra did not refer to Sri Jiva.

Unless the author of the Achyuta Granthamala claims so, i can safely assume that he has overstretched the meaning of the text. It is not uncommon for a translator to interpret incorrectly. Neither is the translator a practitioner of the sampradaya.

The Santipur Gosvamins \[i.e., the descendants of Advaita\] are more conservative and orthodox from the viewpoint of Hindu society than the Nityananda Gosvamins, and they have refused to minister to, or admit into the sect, the lower castes and immoral elements of the population, who have traditionally found help at the hands of Nityananda’s descendants. (Page 68 from Dimock).
