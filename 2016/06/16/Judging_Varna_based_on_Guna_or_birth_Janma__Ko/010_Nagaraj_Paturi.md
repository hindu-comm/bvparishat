Varna system and caste system are two different systems altogether.

  

\>If our scriptures say there are 4 castes, in actuality in our Country there are hundreds of castes if not thousands.

  

Our scriptures talked about four Varnas not four castes.

  

" in actuality in our Country there are hundreds of castes if not thousands." itself shows that these two are different concepts.

  

\>There is no point in defending it by saying that in hoary past it was by Character (guNa) and profession (karma).

  

To say that it was gunakarma based is not a defence but analysis.
