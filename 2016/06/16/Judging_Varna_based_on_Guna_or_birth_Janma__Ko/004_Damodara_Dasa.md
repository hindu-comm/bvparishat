Hare Krishna  
Respected Nityanandji and scholars,  
  
The whole point of the article/paper is that the process of  
designating varna of brahmana etc. based on birth is specifically  
dependent on samskaras (not only ritualistic but also impressions due  
to everyday acarana) being strictly followed. Following this will only  
be able to ensure that a soul with purva-samskara of that of the  
father (brahmana soul for brahmana father etc.) will take shelter of  
the womb. This rule is so made by the creator of the universe as to  
easily administer dharma in society. But in absence of proper  
samskaras this rule cannot be applied and thus the sole method to  
judge varna is based on qualities (guna or laksana).  
  
why did Sanatana Gosvami in Hari Bhakti Vilasa advocate designating  
varna based on birth?  
He doesn't advocate it but is just following the already established  
social ettiquette as per dharma sastras (as we already discussed) that  
usually son of same varna will take birth. This is because about 500  
years ago (time of Rupa and Sanatana Gosvamis) the varnasrama system  
was quite well in place and thus there was no need to unnecessarily  
disturb the process of the well established society. Also the main  
subject of Hari-bhakti-vilasa and Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu was not  
social guidance (or guidance on varnasrama dharma) but to manifest and  
emphasize the importance the process of pure devotional service (of  
being supremely independent of social considerations for a sincere  
follower) and thus social aspects are not discussed in toto.  
  
Also if you read Haribhaktivilasa 1.38-58 with commentary then you  
will find that the first condition is laksana for becoming guru; it is  
mentioned avadAtaH zuddhaH pAtityadozarahitaH vaMzo yasya. Thus it is  
clear that whatever follows takes this point in account. Brahmanatva  
can be given by birth only when the vaMza is suddha and the person  
himself is zuddha. Verses 1.47-50 describes the condition where such  
zuddha brahmanas with told laksanas are not found -- to get initiation  
from ksatriya or vaisya. Anyway it is a detail discussion for how and  
why of this process.  
  
Also it is not neo-gaudiya vaisnavism. Gaudiya vaisnavism cannot be  
said to change by changing social structure. The Gaudiya vaisnavism's  
main philosiphy that was propagated was the worship of Radha-Krishna  
in parakiya bhava, that pure-bhakti is above all varnasrama  
considerations, and that by the only process of kali-yuga: chanting of  
Hare Krishna Mantra anyone, to the point of animals, can get  
liberation from material bondage. None of the principles by which one  
is known as Gaudiya Vaisnava (rupanuga) is violated herein and thus  
this cannot be called neo-gaudiya vaisnavism. This (neo-gaudiya  
vaisnavism) is a side point in the thread and it can be discussed  
starting another thread if needed so as not to deviate from the topic  
of this thread.  
  
The point here is not to just bang based on scriptures but to try to  
understand it properly.  
Now the contemporary of Rupa and Sanatana Gosvamis, Sri Vallabhacarya  
did explain in his subodhini tikas (SB 2.1.37, 3.6.30-33, etc.) that  
varna is actually based on laksana and not birth and thus this is not  
a new concept introduced by Bhakti-vinoda-dhara but, as is established  
both in the paper and book "brahmana and vaisnava", is a well  
documented vedic fact found in almost all vedic literatures.  
  
Usually whenever this topic is raised there is one mistake scholars  
and others do is to take either the favor of judging exclusively by  
birth consideration or take favor of judging exclusively by laksana  
consideration leaving out the other consideration; then to bring  
quotes from sastras in their favor. But proper procedure would be to  
see all quotes and also apply intelligence to understand them in  
proper principle. In my paper I have tried to accept both the  
considerations and placed them in proper perspective so as to get a  
clear principle out of it. This synchronizes the otherwise seemingly  
opposite statements of sastras.  
  
I would request scholars to give a commendable battle to this paper  
not just by bringing quotes in favor of judging varna based on birth  
but properly explaining why it should not be based on laksana or that  
the prime consideration is the other way round and also supporting it  
by logic (as I did by explaining how samskaras decide the next body  
and the soul is placed accordingly in the suitable womb). This type of  
challenges will really contribute to the in depth understanding of  
this topic. (One thing to remember is that I fully accept that judging  
varna primarily based on birth is an important requirement for varna  
system's being easy to establish in society)  

  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava Das,
