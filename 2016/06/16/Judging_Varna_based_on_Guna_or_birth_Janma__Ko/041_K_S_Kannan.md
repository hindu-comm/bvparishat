In Āyurveda, we even have the concept of *tri-ja*.

  

Metaphors are stronger than similes.

  

Yet, as if the metaphor is not strong enough,

even the details of the second birth are

analogically represented after a literary fashion ! :

***ācārya upanayamānaḥ***

***brahmacāriṇam kṛṇute garbham antaḥ***

etc.
