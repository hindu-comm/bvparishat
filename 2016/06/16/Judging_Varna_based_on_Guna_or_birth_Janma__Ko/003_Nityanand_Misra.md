I believe Damodara Dasa Ji had said he would address the points that I had raised: that Jīva Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī in their commentaries on Bhaktirasāmṛtasindhu and Haribhaktivilāsa have supported Brāhmaṇatva by birth (see the passages cited in the links above). I did not find this addressed in his paper.

  

Nobody contests that the neo-Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava movement (in the lineage of Bhaktivinoda Thākura and Svāmī Prabhupāda)holds the view that varṇa is not by birth but by symptoms. But this appears to be a new view in the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava movement, against the view expressed by Jīva Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī: two of the original gosvāmī-s of the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava sampradāya. How the neo-Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava-s reconcile the new view with the old views expressed by Jīva Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī is a moot question.
