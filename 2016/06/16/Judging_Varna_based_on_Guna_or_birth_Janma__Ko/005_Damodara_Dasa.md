Hare Krishna.  
  
Dear Vidvaj-janas,  
Nityanand Mishraji replied to this on another thread (started by  
mistake probably due to mistake in subject by Sreekara ji). Thus I am  
reproducing his reply in this thread in order to keep the discussion  
in one thread. My request to scholars or members is to keep the same  
subject title in replying so that it doesn't generate another thread.  
  
Below is Nityanandji's reply:  
  
============  
I believe Damodara Dasa Ji had said he would address the points that I  
had raised: that Jīva Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī in their  
commentaries on Bhaktirasāmṛtasindhu and Haribhaktivilāsa have  
supported Brāhmaṇatva by birth (see the passages cited in the links  
above). I did not find this addressed in his paper.  
  
Nobody contests that the neo-Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava movement (in the lineage  
of Bhaktivinoda Thākura and Svāmī Prabhupāda) holds the view that  
varṇa is not by birth but by symptoms. But this appears to be a new  
view in the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava movement, against the view expressed by  
Jīva Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī: two of the original gosvāmī-s of  
the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava sampradāya. How the neo-Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava-s  
reconcile the new view with the old views expressed by Jīva Gosvāmī  
and Sanātana Gosvāmī is a moot question.  
==============
