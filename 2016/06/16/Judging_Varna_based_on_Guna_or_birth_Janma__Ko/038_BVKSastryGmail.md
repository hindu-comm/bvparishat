Namaste



Can we focus on this one point here reading \< janmāntara (a new birth) after śaukra-janma \>



What all does this expression cover? . Here are my thoughts:



1) ‘ A new birth’ presupposes a ‘ border line’ separating the ‘current state of existence’ from a previous state;



- 1.1) Which in case of śaukra – is body –Material –Processes of (Human) life model; the normal understanding being ‘ Stree- Pum Bhoga janita martya shareera’. Which seems to map to \< **one is birth in the literal sense** \> . This ‘birth-phase ’ ends only wih ‘Shareera-Naasha / Marana’.



- 1.2) Which in case of sāvitra - is Non-Material body – Non-Material Processes of (Human) life, pre-supposing a ‘Samskara’ and ‘Adrushta vishesha /Adhikaaraavapti / Privilege and responsibility in a body 

of 1.1 type’. This ‘ new birth’ is technical, needs to be maintained for its status and if failed, can be restored back through the technicality of Prayaschitta.

This is Some thing like a club- membership. Which seems to map to \< **in the metaphoric sense** \>.

This ‘birth-phase ’ has an ‘interim reference point within 1.1 and dynamics for maintaining it. And is ‘ JanmaVarna’ –‘Veda’ factored.



- 1.3) Which in case of yājñika – is (1.3.a) body of type 1.1
(1.3.b) which may or may not be of 1.2 and ( 1.3.c) a temporary process where in some technicality is invoked for a purpose, analogous to the dress and ornaments put on a actor, a role-play making the person look like a ‘Rama or Ravana’ ( - Natvat vyavaharah). Which seems to map to \< **in the metaphoric sense** \>. This ‘birth-phase ’ has a ‘interim reference point, within a context and a temporal value till the deeksha within 1.1 and limited dynamics for maintaining it. Here the ‘ Janma-Varna’ issue is not brought in to consideration at all !





In this light, I am not able to understand the total purport of the statement reading : \< The difference is **one is birth in the literal sense** and **other two in the metaphoric sense**. In itself and without any qualification, **the word *janmāntara* is used in the sense of next/future/another physical birth** and not for *upanayana*.\> Why then connect the word ‘Dvi-ja’ with ‘ Upa-Nayana’? The vedantins speak of every wake up from sleep comparable to \< another birth experience>.



Thanks in advance for the clarification.
