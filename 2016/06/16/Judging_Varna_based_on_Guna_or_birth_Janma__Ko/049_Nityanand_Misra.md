Thanks for the response and examples, but the positions of these Gauḍiya Vaiṣṇava scholars (including Haridāsa Śāstrī Ji) elsewhere or even scholars from other traditions does not influence interpretation of Jīva Gosvāmī’s position in Durgamasaṅgamanī in any way. That Jīva Gosvāmī sees the \[extreme\] example of *śvapāka* in Bhāgavatam 11.14.21 as *kaimutya* is clear when he says *kaimutyārthameva proktam*: there is nothing specific about *śvapāka* to merit a mention except kaimutya (the jāti was considered the lowest and hence the example). In addition, Jīva Gosvāmī's sub-statement that the right to perform *savana* is acquired only after a *śaukra janma* (physical birth) as a Brahmin and *sāvitra janma* (upanayana) is crystal clear. The terms *durjāti* and *sujāti* are also used by Jīva Gosvāmī in the sense of physical birth alone. Given all this, the only rational conclusion I can reach is that Durgamasaṅgamanī supports right to savana only for those who are born as a Brahmin and have had upanayana, and somebody who is purified by bhakti also has to take a physical birth as a Brahmin and undergo upanayana before he can perform savana (as said earlier, the cāṇḍāla example is for kaimutya alone as per Jīva Gosvāmī). And this conclusion is confirmed by the excellent scholarly translation by Haridāsa Śāstrī and the summary by Shyamlal Hakim.

  

With that, I do not have anything else to say for now. If another scholarly translation of the Durgamasaṅgamanī interprets him otherwise, I would be happy to see that.
