The word is used for both: specifically for Brahmins, and in general for the three varnas. For the general meaning, there is evidence in Kosas and Smrtis:

  

Kosa evidence:

1\) द्विजः स्याद्ब्राह्मणक्षत्रवैश्यदन्ताण्डजेषु ना (मेदिनीकोषः, जान्तवर्गः ९, also cited in Vyakhyasudha on Amarakosa)

2\) क्षत्त्रियः।वैश्यः।इति मेदिनी (शब्दकल्पद्रुमः on द्विजः)  

3\) ब्राह्मणक्षत्रियवैश्येषु च (वाचस्पत्यम् on द्विज)  

  

Smrti evidence

मातुर्यदग्रे जायन्ते द्वितीयं मौञ्जिबन्धनात्। ब्राह्मणक्षत्रियविशस्तस्मादेते द्विजाः स्मृताः॥ याज्ञवल्क्यस्मृतिः १.३९ ॥
