Another question worth considering is what is the view of varna based on janma in other traditions of Gaudiya Vaishnavism outside of Gaudiya Matha and ISKCON (both of which came up in the twentieth century). There would be many old and new parampara-s of Gaudiya Vaishnavism, and I doubt if all of them have the same opinion on varna and birth as Gaudiya Matha/ISKCON do.



As for historical Gaudiya Vaishnavism, Sekhar Bandyopadhyay has extensively written on the subject in “Caste, Culture and Hegemony: Social Dominance in Colonial Bengal” (2004: SAGE, ISBN 9780761998495, pp. 83–86, [URL](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=z2SVIflbyHQC&pg=PA83) retrieved today). Bandyopadhyay writes that the followers of Advaita Acharya were orthodox and more dominant (as against the more egalitarian followers of Nityananda), and that the Haribhaktivilasa by Gopala Bhatta Gosvami ‘bore a close resemblance to ritualism, Brahminism, and varnashram dharma.’



I had a question on how the modern Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava-s (not using the prefix ‘neo-‘ as it was objected to) reconcile the view of Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati/Svami Prabhupadawith with the views of Jīva Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī. The view of Damodara Dasa Ji is that things changed in 500 years: the varnashram system was “well in place” when Sanatana Gosvami followed the “already established social etiquette” and this changed over the next centuries. One may agree or disagree with this view, but at least it is less problematic than saying that Jiva Gosvami/Sanatana Gosvami have not supported varna by birth when they indicate exactly the opposite at some places in their works.
