Namaste Sastryji,  
  

Our ancient texts are not as outdated as we may begin to think. For example the Ramayana itself says in the Uttarakanda that the 4th Varna has all the rights in the Kali yuga. So also the smritis have been accommodating the different societal requirements for different times. Vedavyasa urged his father Parashara to write a smriti keeping in mind the requirements of the post-Mahabharata times. There is some anti-Brahmin emotions building up because of misinformation. Dronacharya is said to have refused to teach Ekalva,a nishada. But the facts are that Dronacharya, a bahmin, was employed to teach the Hastinapura princes. Secondly, to my knowledege, Ekalavya was a lost cousin of Lord Krishna, only sheltered ny a Nishada king/chiertain. I may be corrected if I am wrong. Even Lord Buddha told an untouchable girl that she should not hope to marry Ananda, as she was born untouchable because of her past karma. Again i may be corrected if I am wrong. The Bhagavad Gita also told us in similar lines when it told that a yogi takes birth in a family of yogis, so that the former can pursue the incomplete sadhana in the new birth. Lord Ram killed Shambuka not just because he was a shudra, but for running away from his assigned duty.of paricharya, and for which a sick boy died. I may be corrected if I am wrong. So it appears to me that the first thing to do is to remove the misconcptions of the anti-brahmin brigades about our ancient texts and then take up the Varna issue as our ancient stalwarts have really taught.
