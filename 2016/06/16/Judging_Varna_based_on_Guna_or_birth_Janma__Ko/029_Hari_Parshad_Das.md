Sāvitra itself is janmāntara (a new birth) after śaukra-janma. Otherwise there is no point in calling someone a dvi-ja. There are three types of births  
  

— śaukra  

— sāvitra  

— yājñika  
  

So sāvitra is a janmāntara from śaukra and yājñika is a janmāntara from śaukra and sāvitra.

The original point was about the entire Gaudiya Vaishnava sampradāya and i have clarified that acharyas such as Srila Sanatana Goswami, Srila Vishwanath Chakravarti etc. are in support of brahmanatva by qualities.  
  
Regarding Sri Jiva, what better source than Sri Jiva himself, who while commenting on the same verse in the Bhakti-sandarbha drops the term "janmāntara" and instead says, ”savanārthaṁ tu guṇāntarādhānam apekṣata eva." — "For performing a yajña the acquisition of good qualities is expected". He does not say that the cāṇḍāla has to wait another life (śaukra-janmāntara) to acquire these qualities. Therefore i said that those who have translated Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhuḥ to interpret brahminism by birth have not studied the entirety of the texts of the tradition.
