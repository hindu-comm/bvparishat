Please excuse me for the late response.

  

Jīva Gosvāmī uses the present tense only in the *nirukti* to infer *tacchīlatva* and ultimately arrive at a *\[cāṇḍāla\] jāti* meaning which is clear when he says: *śvādatvamatra śvabhakṣaka**jāti**viśeṣatvameva*. It is not a random person who is currently eating dog-meat but a member of the *cāṇḍāla jāti*that is being inferred by him. There is nothing specific about dog-meat here, the words *śvapaca* and *śvāda* are used by *rūḍhi* for a *cāṇḍāla*, historically considered the lowest of all *jāti*-s. Which is why the *kaimutya*, as pointed out by Jīva Gosvāmī, makes sense. I have not stretched the *cāṇḍāla* example, but it is Jīva Gosvāmī himself who sees *kaimutya nyāya* (a fortiori argument) in the underlying SB verse: in *kaimutya* the strong/extreme example applies to weaker/less extreme examples also.

  

If there is no *varṇa*/*jāti* by birth in Jīva Gosvāmī's view, what do the words/phrases like *śvabhakṣakajāti*, *durjātitva*, *sujātitva*, *brāhmaṇānāṃ śaukraṃ janma*, etc mean in his commentary? How can *śaukraṃ janma* of aBrāhmaṇā be possible if one does not assume *varṇa* by birth?

  

As for Sanātana Gosvāmī, I have asked before how is his interpretation of BRS helpful here in interpreting Jīva Gosvāmī? His commentary is on the BRS and not a sub-commentary on Jīva Gosvāmī’s commentary, is it?

  

You may find my reading an overstretch or misapplication, but at least it is backed by two published scholarly sources. I will not respond to arguments that appeal to emotion (hit a wall, overstretch, any person can understand, etc), but if you can bring up a scholarly translation of DS to back your interpretation of Jīva Gosvāmī, I will be happy to discuss. Or if you can present your own word-for-word translation of the commentary passages, they can also be discussed.

  

I believe Satyanarayana Dasa Ji, who has translated several sandarbha works of Jīva Gosvāmī, is a member of this group. Let us hope he comments here.
