Namaste Bhattacharya ji



( **Personal note:** Please do not take this response post in any other sense. This is a logical reasoned debate. I have highest respect to the ‘Brahmana-Achara and Sampradaya as a ‘faith –personal practice by conviction and respecting the statement – ‘asampradaayavit upekshaneeyah’. I am as much interested in the wellbeing of ‘Sanskrit in a healthy status on a global platform’. This does not stop me or any one from pursuing a reasoned deliberation and questioning the
limitations of current model understanding of faith-basis and basics’. I am leaving the long thread as it is for readers benefit to see why and how this debate is steering itself in relation to Sanskrit: Poorva-Paksha.).



1. The ‘Varna’ issue is not simplistic to be dismissed with a quote from ‘Manu Smriti’ and listing \< Firstly we must recognize .. ;Secondly, the earliest law-giver Manu tells us … ... Thirdly, one who is not brahman by birth can also become brahman through one's conduct and efforts coupled with the grace of a sadguru. These are the sort of guidelines one has to follow to understand the issue.> 

These are the very issues that are challenged by the writers mounting ‘History and Social implication’ issues to explain what ‘Varna’ means and has done for Indian Society. The contrast of a grandeur of concept failing to yield ground result in practice is the malady that is being addressed.

It is in this concept, that ‘Varna’ concept and practice is a complex and highly misconstrued and misconstrued concept with a ‘historicity’ (? Of 4000 / 10,000 / manvantaras –scale being your choice) from ‘Vedic Tradition’ and a ‘Claimed- live continuity’ having social implications . There is a need to bring out the fuller understanding of ‘Varna concept’ –relevance and right guidelines for practice and administration, used across a plethora of texts and contexts of Vedic tradition, using Sanskrit as the medium of language, without any exception.



Translations and social abusive practices have spoiled the ‘Spiritual element and Yoga-Dimensions associated with this word ‘Varna’ - in Samskrutham. Especially for glory and convenience of
‘academic scholars constructing the history of Hinduism as a world-Religion’ and tagging it to the ‘aberrations of historic practices, oppressive and violating human dignity in Indian context, in a select period by ‘Brahman Varna holders’. The politics, power-play issue and motives have deep-scars and ‘ religion- links’ play a serious role in the preliminaries to shape the platform for ‘Sanskrit: Poorva-Paksha’ debate.



2. The source texts of Indian traditions, in Sanskrit do show the
dynamic movement of ‘Varna’ tags across life time of an individual.
Varna is not an identity set in stone for the life term of an individual :Either socially or religiously ! And surely ‘Varna’ is not a ‘historic tribal group identity or a ‘faith identity anchored to a scripture or god-worship or ‘ Mandir –Master -Membership’?!



 This is what I understand from the discussion related to the word ‘Brahmana-Shramanaka nyaya’- in traditional context of Six systems of Indian philosophy. The Sanskrit word means : Once this person was ‘tagged as a Brahman’ and now he is a Shramanaka, a Buddhist ( falling out of the Varna-identity class and tags !) 



 What does it point to? 



 Similarly the debate of ‘ Nishaada Sthapati’ and the like.



3. On the same tone and line, the administration of Praayaschitta by ‘Krucchra – Chaandrayana vrata rules ’ to restore the ‘ lost /lapsed /fallen - status of a Brahmana’ is also ‘kind of blemished thinking ’. This understanding of ‘Varna’ makes it a club membership with an effort for ‘ status maintained in a preferred ‘club and company’ ( which needs
to be maintained and guarded, groomed for perpetuation ?! playing by the rules of the books whose content and interpretation is controlled by the club peers ?! ) The performance of certain orthodox rituals and duties in a culture-nation-tradition specific format (= Sampradyaa –Aachara- paddhati ) for keeping the ‘Varna-membership status Alive and Current is the ‘ heart of Sampradaaya –Aachaara’ (Yathaa te Tatra varteran, alookshaa Dharma kaamah syuh; Shishtaachara .. are related contextual concepts) .



In this frame of ‘Varna’ understanding, the prescribed path for
‘Varna’-status and compliance may be achieved by practice of daily rituals (Kuryaat anyat na vaa kuryaat, maitro braahmana uchyate) or by ‘karmaadhikaara –yogyataa siddhyartham pratyaamnaaya dakshinaa’ – a fine and fee paid to regain the membership privileges to perform the ritual Or by ‘Yoga-Tapas’. And all approved by Manu.



4. On the same tone and line, the inheritance of ‘Varna’ is not a guaranteed issue ! For, at what point does one want to put the tag of ‘Varna’ to the ‘ individual life’, which is marked by ‘Shudra
Varna-status right at the time of birth’? ( Janmanaa jaayate Shudrah) ?- the child taking its first breath and making first cry after separation from the supporting umbilical tie? For no fault of the child, the zygote has to get the ‘social varna status’ from parents, like the gene- born qualities ?? When would this change and why ? How? When will one make progression of this ‘ birth stamp of Shudra-varna’?
How long should this continue ?



 And who on earth can guarantee the ‘Parental Status and maintenance of ‘Varna –Status’ – to the child ? Mother is a fact. Father is a belief. (Story of Satya-Kaama). ? The ‘Cross-Varna ’ marriage yields ‘ antar-jaati’s- even in Manu. Think Jati as a subcategory under ‘Varna’ ?? How is this connected to ‘Four Fold Varna’? dynamics in society and Samskara?



 Till British Raj, in India, maximum ‘jati’s’ that were identified and listed in Dharma Shaastra was less than 200 (See History of Dharma Shaastra – MM P.V.Kane) ; and Independent India has exploded this list under Administrative Executive privilege to six-thousand plus , causing social implication and havoc to ‘ Vedic Varna lane locked specific community’- who seem to have found no glue to bond and overcome two key differences : one, by face marks sworn in the name of ‘Vedanta-Acharya –Varyas of Vedanta, held responsible for articulating Veda-Vyasa wisdom and Spirituality’ and two, ‘ culture –region specific ways of wrapping clothe on body’ ? ? 



 Has there been any deliberation on ‘Varna status of global humanity and people who migrated beyond India seeking ‘ economic well being’ over the ‘ compliance to stick to ‘Aryavartam Punya bhoomih, locked with the bounds of ‘Four Samudras’ and ‘Gotra lineage recollection’? Does it mean that ‘Vaidika-Varna ’ operational identity is limited to the equation ‘ India = Bharath minus Pakistan =Hindustan’? Surely the argument to shoot back would be ‘ kaliyuga’ expecting the ‘Avataar’ to descend, run around the world on a white horse with a sword to fight the ‘ terrorism using assault rifles and bombs’ ? Why are we to shift the responsibility of cleaning human mess to God, peacefully reclining on ‘Shesha-talpa’ for ‘sukha-nidraa’ ? Is it because HE is the Creator who made humans ? ‘Devaan bhaavayata anenana’ ?? 





 The ‘Shudra’ identity has been played as a weapon to destroy, if not neutralize the ‘ Brahmana Varna identity’. Does the Vedic concept hold such internal conflict to be promoted in society ? Is one going to exclude ‘Shudra’ for life time from ‘Samskaras’ in a society ? Do we have history of such eternal damnation ? Why do we forget the upgrade of ‘Hakka –Bukka’, Sri Krishna Devaraya, even the Yadu dynasty kings of Mysore lineage, ‘Shivaji Maharaj’ – just to mention some select, not to speak of illustrious ‘Akbar Baadshaah’ worshipped as ‘ Vishnu, the King of the land?! In his time?? By the ‘ learned people of the period’ in the context ? Why should one be keen on invoking the ‘Devoted Saints authority to insist in restoring a ‘Brahmana’ status and compliance continuing by parental status, in a totally modified context ? Any document to disprove this view ? What was the ‘Kshatriyatva –parentage –Marriage –Dharma’ of Mughal Baadshah in Varna frame, which ‘Rajput kings desisted and fought?



On the same tone and line, Is ‘Varna’ a ‘ Shareera –Dharma, or is it
always with ‘Jeeva-Deha association’ till ‘ death do part’ them ?
Will Varna identity be different for Jeeva and Deha ? Where is the
border and boundary Point of Varna? In which case, what is the ‘ Varna identity of Jeeva’?



5. We, under the umbrella of several Indian disciplines, have continued to carry the association of ‘For Varna model’ to Cosmic bodies and deified cosmic bodies ( -Nava-graha Devataas with a Varna identity), Animals ( certain animals carry Brahmana categorization), trees and metals not excluded ( Why Iron should be Shani and associated with Shudra category ? I don’t have any clue ! And if Iron is made to Stainless steel, does its jaati-varna change ? I don’t see any deliberations and upgrade thinking.



 What if ‘Iron’ is a critical ingredient of medicine to treat anemia ? Would one call ‘ it a ‘ restoring optimized percentage of Shudra –Varna balancing in a brahmana body? How long would this birth tag ‘Shudra’ continue and how the ‘Samskara’ works to ‘alter- replace –remove-modify’ it ? and whose responsibility and authority rules this ?



 It is this complexity on ‘Varna’ thought and concept to organize society and ‘ lifestyle of communities in society’ that needs to spring forth as a part of the ‘National governance (Rajya Shaastra /Artha Shaastra /Raja Dharma / Nyaya dispensation / Education System shaping the profession, Ethics and human relations part of upcoming society within the frame of ‘ Dharma-Yoga Spirituality’- The texts of which are all drawing the wisdom from ‘Vedas’ using ‘Samskrutham’ explained in ‘Sanskrit’? This essence, somehow seems to have remained dormant in the minds of the traditional scholars’ without reaching out to society at large. When the traditional scholars get themselves
‘pigeon-holed’ and more focused on ‘ guarding their Sampradaya’ for ‘ Personal Moksha, quoting Gita verse ( Uddharet Atmanaa atmaanam), I don’t think they are exercising their rightful ‘Datta –Swaatantraya’ for social or self-reform. It seems to be a personal preferential choice of ‘Brahmana’ between the ‘Personal Moksha ( coupled with saving the Pitrus :Cf. Arjuna vishada Yoga) and ‘Loka Sangraha/ Loka-Kalyana /Sarva-mangalam’ challenge articulated by Manu as ‘ etat Desha prasootasya, sakaashaad agra janmanah, Svam Svam charitram Shiksheran, Pruthivyaam Sarvamaanavaah’ : Brahman as an Iconic ideal for every one to learn and emulate their personal life , all over the world ??



 Unless these issues are clearly addressed with a clear reasoning to prove ‘How colonial & oriental translations making a distorted presentation of Vedic Tradition documented in Samskrutham are off the mark’, the expectation of ‘Poorva-paksha /Parapaksha niraakarana’ part of discourse is not complete. It would simply be dismissed as last ditch ‘Brahmins effort’ to save their ‘historic language of scripture and their personal Gods’ , which gave them the power to ‘oppress and suppress Shudras for centuries’.



 Do we have any inputs on understanding the aspect of ‘Varna-based Identity from this ‘Sanskrit Word’ for its Status, Concept, Translation and Historical practice with social implications ( in Pre- Independence India and Post Independent India, And Global Hinduism) .



 The exercise of ‘Sanskrit: Poorva-Paksha’ debate’ is a wonderful and relevant context-sensitive concept, And all appreciation for the work of Rajiv Malhotra for pushing this to the center stage. But without answering the specific point raised above, ( which is just one of many), the deliberation cannot grow any strength to run and address the ‘social implication and history part’ from its current clay feet ( ! ) borrowed from ‘Colonial and oriental thoughts ’ to explain Sanskrit word and concept of ‘Varna’.
