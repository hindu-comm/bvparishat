The word dvija is commonly used in the sense of the three varnas by rudhi (convention), and to explain this usage we connect the word with upanayanawhich is the second birth, metaphorically speaking.

  

But is the word janmāntara used conventionally in the sense of non-physical birth? Does any Kosa list this sense as a meaning, or are there any examples attesting to such a usage?
