Namaste



1. It is nice to see and be reminded to revisit the quotes from several resources, which do provide multiple meaning of the word ‘dvija’.
Before I made the post on ‘dvija’ clarification, I have verified the following sources, where I do see the word-listing with multiple meanings in different contexts. It does not help to fire a salvo in the battle for ‘Sanskrit’ or build a ‘poorva-paksha’, much less restore ‘brahmana’ Varna stakes to the fore.



Thanks Bhat ji for making me revisit them once again. 

<http://www.sanskritdictionary.com/?q=dvije>

<http://faculty.washington.edu/prem/mw/s.html> 

<http://www.spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=twice-born&direction=ES&script=HK&link=yes&beginning>=




These listings do not resolve the issue.



2. What then was the focus of my asking again on the usage of the word ‘dvija’ and pointing to the preferred classical usage pointing to \< Brahmanas with brahmana-achaaras \> in the context of the thread of discussion debating ‘Brahmanatva’ by birth.



The ‘meaning listing given by the links above and resources’ is a ‘ pool of meanings’ associated with the word ‘dvija’ in different contexts. The links themselves do not provide a filtering criterion or logic for construction, beyond a ‘ justification to say: This meaning ‘also’ is associated with the word’.



This is precisely where the clarity needs to be provided in understanding the meaning of the Samskruth word \< dvija>. In the context of the description, which brought in ‘Identification of Brahman Varna status’ by ‘ birth or otherwise, three criterion - Saukra, Savitra, Yajnika - were listed. Each one is a different technicality and discipline – context specific construction. Such constructions need to guard jumps across the following boundary lines:



- 2a) by the model of ‘traditional nirvachana’ : जन्मना ब्राह्मणो ज्ञेयः संस्कारै- र्द्विज उच्यते Dvija as ‘Twice born’ - N.13.42. -जः 'twice-born' 1 a man of any of the first three castes of the Hindus (a Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya or Vaiśya);

- 2b) by the ‘paribhashaa’- Technical definition under ‘Dharma-Shaastra’ invoking ‘Veda’ : - मातुर्यदग्रे जायन्ते द्वितीयं मौञ्जिबन्धनात् । ब्राह्मणक्षत्रियविशस्तस्मादेते द्विजाः स्मृताः Y.1.39. -2 Brāhmaṇa (over whom the Saṁskāras or purificatory rites are performed);

- 2c) by the social usage – model of dictionary where one looks at the word-meaning in usage context

- 2d) by the literary expression usage in poetry as a creative composition (Venisamhara quoted earlier)

- 2e) by discipline technicality –Shaastra Paddhati. (Varna-Ashrama Dharma contextuality).





When these boundaries are violated, exactly like the approach used in colonial and oriental research in constructing the history and social implication of ‘Document of Samskruth’ and using ‘academic freedom for cross hopping across ‘ time-lines, societies and knowledge domains’ and pronounce opinions guarded by shield of ‘freedom of expression’, there will be serious errors in understanding the intention of writer, text, practicing culture, rite of passage and usage. And outcome of such writing can be politically damning for communities, if not a religious ‘ castigation’ (<http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/damnation> ).



3. By pointing to the links and a plurality of meanings, the resolving of the issue in original post has been further complicated. Here is ‘why’ and I request you to address this.



- I take the usage of word ‘dvija’ in Gita (17-14) line:
**deva-dvija-guru-prājña- pūjanaṁ** .

- ***Why Gita?*** Gita serves as a 3100 BCE text / Pre-Christian period text, and before any of these dictionaries can be used as a reference; including the Dharma-Shaastra reference indicated.
Gita text uses the word ‘Brahmana’ (18-41) also without any confusion or overlap of meaning on ‘dvija’. The word usage of ‘Brahmana’ in prior-works to Gita are aplenty and come with specificity of expectations which do not make a substitution or wide sweep coverage like ‘dvija’. For word usage ‘Brahmana’ in literature earlier to Gita, see url : <http://www.vedabase.com/en/verse-index?original_op=contains&original=brahmaNa&=Apply>



- ***The question*** : I place the listed meaning of the words – ‘ dvija’ and ‘brAhmaNa’ drawn from from url’s.



What does the word ‘dvija’ mean in Gita statement yielding the expression : ‘deva-**dvija**- guru-prajna- **poojanam** ? How does this translate in to ‘ limited one ‘Varna’ focused practice? How to filter the appropriate meaning from the pool of meanings listed in the above urls’? Can ‘Any and all ‘ meanings of ‘dvija’ – ‘ brAhmaNa’- be swapped and substituted by the translator? What happens when one does such ‘ transgression using the ‘ academic freedom’? When one needs to work on explaining the position of ‘Gita’ on ‘Dvija - brAhmaNa’ , using a commentary of a very later period, taken as authority in a ‘fairly rigid lane of Gaudiya Vaishnava Sampradaya’, what meaning would be most appropriate? Why? How does one get at the ‘ intended meaning and position (Vivakshaa –Taatparya) of the commentator? And the translator to pick? Where are the dictionaries covering the fine shades of usage \< Saukra, Savitra, Yajnika \> filters ? Would the ‘Buddha’ reference based translation to interpret ‘Gita’ line be appropriate?
