this is true to many cities like Bangalore ,Hyderabad .in many houses only old senior citizens live waiting for the return or news of welfare of their wards.

A common suggestion is that ultimately people must choose to get to the matrubhumi after a course in udyogabhumi.

Poona is a punyapatttana where learned scholars in all fields thrive and attract.The weather is so convenient for all.
