Respected Scholars,  
  

On behalf of an eminent scholar, I am putting forth a request. The scholar is in need of a book titled 'Pun in Sanskrit Literature - A New Approach.' Prof. Gurpad K. Hegde is the author of the book (239 pages) and it was published in 1982, by Mysore University. My search through google did not yield any result to download an e-copy. I highly appreciate, if you can guide me to get a soft copy or a photo copied text. I'd bear the scanning/photo copying/postal charges. If you like to communicate off the list, please do write back to me.  
  

Thanks and regards,  

Prasad
