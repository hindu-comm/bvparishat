Dear list members,  
  

I think there is some explanation needed about the work being done by Dr. Anupama Ryali referred to in her earlier mail.  
  

Dr. Anupama is developing an electronic reader for the `Śiśupālavadha of Māgha.`

`This reader has following features:`

`a) For every shloka its padapaa.tha, anvaya, Hindi and English translation are provided.`

`b) Further, with the Anusaaraka interface, `

` Morphological Analysis('sabda vi'sle.sa.na) of every word, compound analysis of every compound and complete sentential analysis (kaaraka analysis) are provided.`

`c) In addition the summary of each canto in Sanskrit, Hindi and English are provided.`

`Thus this reader helps one to read the original text online, with all necessary analysis at the click of a button.`

`The reader is available at http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/scl/shishu/`
