I did not follow exactly what you want. The analysis is integrated with various online tools and dictionaries.  
  

If you want the offline version so that you can install it on your machine, then Sankshepa Ramayanam is available for download at  
<http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/~scl/downloads/sankshepa_ramayanam-0.v6.zip>  

  

This reader was developed some 8 years back, and is not integrated with the existing tools.  
  

But BhagvadGeeta, e.g. is integrated with the dictionary. So in the analysis, we have provided one meaning, picked up from the Geeta Press Gorakhpur's translation. However, we also provide link to Apte's dictionary, Monier William's dictionary and Amarakosha.  

This is to help a reader to understand the text in a better way.  
  

Shishupalvadha is an ongoing work.
