Dear list members

  

I am looking for the following works (print or digital copy) ofJagannātha Prasāda ‘Bhānu’, the famed author of Chandaḥprabhākara, one of the best works on prosody in Hindi.

  

1\) Navapañcāmṛta Rāmāyaṇa: He refers to this work on page 90 of Chandaḥprabhākara (1939, ninth edition)

2\) Rasaratnākara: This is a work on aesthetics in Hindi

3\) Kāvyaprabhākara: This is a work on poetics in Hindi

  

I am also looking for any publications on ‘Bhānu’ kavi. He is mentioned in some encyclopedias but the information about him is scarce. My search led me to one book (below), any other pointers would be welcome:

  

हिन्दी के प्रथम साहित्य शास्त्री: जगन्नाथ प्रसाद भानु (Hindī ke Prathama Sāhitya Śāstrī: Jagannātha Prasāda Bhānu) by Sushil Trivedi, ISBN 9788192081564, 2012, Yash Publications (New Delhi).

  

Thanks, Nityānanda
