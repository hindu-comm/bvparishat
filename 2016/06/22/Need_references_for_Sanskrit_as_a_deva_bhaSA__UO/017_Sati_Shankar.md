"\<GODS ARE HUMAN CONSTRUCTIONS, The danger of Religion model, which vitiates the entire basics of Veda and Vedanta Shaastra chintana>. So at best, Sanskrit in its multiple flavors are ‘ language of Religion and scriptures of a community in a society, HISTORIC and of a PAST PERIOD."



mAnyavar,

  

**The core answer lies in the question itself,**

  

Are we ready to test the presuppositions in the very **foundation of historicity,conflicts and dynamics** and need is to test if they are (and they are not) compatible to our tradition.

If it is not compatible then need arises to scrutinize the very paradigm in which the statements are made as declarations.

**The answer lies in the adaptability of the paradigm itself and in thinking on it from inside the black box.**

  

Regards

SS
