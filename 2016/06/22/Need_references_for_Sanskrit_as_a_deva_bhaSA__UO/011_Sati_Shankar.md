Dear Prof. Sati Sankar,

you might want to go through the following thread on BVP for a discussion on the concept of Daivi Vak:  

<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/bvparishat/daivi%7Csort:relevance/bvparishat/ImifT-EKf2Q/s5ijdP4w-Y0J>  

............................

Thank you very much Sir for the link, I searched BVP before posting but
the key word was deva bhasha so it did not come up.

Thanks again, link is comprehensive.

Regards

SS
