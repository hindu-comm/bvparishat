I think the appelation देवभाषा - देवानां भाषा as in a सुभाषित ---

**भाषासु मुख्या मधुरा दिव्या गीर्वाण भारती ।**  
**तत्रापि मधुरं काव्यं तस्मादपि सुभाषितम्॥**

which is synonymous to देवभाषा as - "language of देव-s" signifies the language in मन्त्र-s used in पूजा, याग,etc. to address the देव-s and देव-s understood their language and it is believed as देवानां भाषा in contrast to human beings who can understand other languages.
