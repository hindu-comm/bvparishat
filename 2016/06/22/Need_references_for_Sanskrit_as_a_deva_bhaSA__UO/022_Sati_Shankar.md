Thank you very much Sir, I will look for the indicated article if I get the volume.

I have been in direct touch with Magadhi and also had some opportunity to learn on its history, hope a return back to that may provide some extra information.

  

So far as "Theravada" is concerned, there are certain issues which has been making me suspicious of it, from practical point of view, however, I am not saying it from the perspective of the question of this thread. In fact Theravada presupposes as if there has been nothing before Buddha, and it is he who started *ab initio,* where as NikAyas themselves, tell different stories, which Therawadins have not dared even to translate.

  

Any way , thanks for sparing time for this thread.

Regards

Sati Sankar.
