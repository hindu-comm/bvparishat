Sir,

As we know, devas came later, and by that time phenomenology has been in action. God, Goddess, angles, etc etc characterize that discriminatory perceptions.

So long as *purva paksha* is concerned, the only space we are left to strengthen is the relation of Sanskrit to primordial vAk.

proof may be direct or indirect.... as soon as we depart from this space, our liberty in *uttar paksha* will become a bit limited.

in fact, i have been thinking in that direction only so this thread....

  

Regards

Sati Shankar
