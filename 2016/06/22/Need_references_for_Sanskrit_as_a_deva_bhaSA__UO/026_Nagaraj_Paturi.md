\>The Jains explicitly say that gods speak in the language of Ardhamāgadhī (devā addhamāgahāe bhāsāe bhāsanti), while for the Theravāda Buddhists, Pāli/Māgadhī is the original language of all beings (sabbasattānaṃ mūlabhāṣā).

  

Neither of these claims is related to any claim about Sanskrit in texts such as Vakyapadiyam. Nowhere in these texts Sanskrit is claimed to be either the language spoken by dEvAh or sarvasatvAnAm mUlabhAshA.

  

If the quoted claims of Jains and Buddhists are to be viewed as counter-claims to some claims in behalf of Sanskrit, those claimsabout Sanskrit must be traced in sources other than Vakyapadiyam or Dandin or the Veda mantras quoted by Prof. Korada. Phrases such as DaivI vAk etc. do not carry any such claims as the Jain and the Buddhist claims mentioned here.
