\> but have to show that Sanskrit carries both the vyavhArika and adhyAtmika together which are "inseparable".

  

----- That Sanskrit carries vyaavahaarika (as any language does,) does not need substantiation.

  

That it carries aadhyaatmika is argued on two bases:

  

1\. Sanskrit is derived from the Vedas. The Vedas are , (among other things), aadhyaatmika. Sanskrit acquired its aadhyaatmikata from its derivational source i.e. the Vedas.

  

2\. Any language embodies the culture of its speakers. Speakers of Sanskrit have Dharma. Hence Sanskrit has Dharma. Dharma is (loosely) being looked at as aadhyaatmikata.

  

Sanskrit's handling of vyaavahaarika is dhaarmika. Hence the two aspects of Sanskrit are unseparable.
