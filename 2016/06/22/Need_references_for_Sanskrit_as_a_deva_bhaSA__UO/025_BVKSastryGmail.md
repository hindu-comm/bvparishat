Namaste



On the point of \<Deva-Bhashaa>, Professor Madhva Deshpande posts : “
**Also keep in mind that the Jains and the Buddhists contested this status of Sanskrit. The Jains explicitly say that gods speak in the language of Ardhamāgadhī (devā addhamāgahāe bhāsāe bhāsanti), while for the Theravāda Buddhists, Pāli/Māgadhī is the original language of all beings (sabbasattānaṃ mūlabhāṣā). **



**Follow up clarification requests** (some of which seem to be important in forming Poorva-Paksha in The Battle for Sanskrit) :

a\) Do we take that ‘God/s –Goddesses know, speak and are comfortable with all languages and dialects of all societies ? Because a ‘postulated ‘God/s –Goddesses has to be ‘ Knower of all’ and cover the criterion of Yoga-Sutra : 316 and 3-17 ?



b\) And ‘’Gods and Angels ( Not covered in the Indian Vedic and Purana pantheon -?? ) speak only Hebrew or Araimac/ Greek or Latin in other half of the world ? And not sure of their knowledge of ‘English’ ?



c\) With this backdrop, how is one to have an organized understanding on the history of ancient Indian language grammars? What is the source language and branched output language ?



In other words, to define the standard of ‘Sanskrit’, is there a necessity for postulating ‘Belief in a / any / God’ ? Or the choice is left to ‘Define what is Sanskrit to be associated with the language of God by personal choice of God’? Affiliation to a scripture /Faith practice?



We do have in cyber space strong proponents who believe and advocate Tamil ( and Sumerian) to be the language of Vedas ??
