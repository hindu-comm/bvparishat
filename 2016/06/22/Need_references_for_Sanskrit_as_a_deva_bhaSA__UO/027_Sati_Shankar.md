Points are interesting and may be some time it should be pursued further in a fresh thread.

  

But on the outset, such claims that*devā addhamāgahāe bhāsāe bhāsanti or*sabbasattānaṃ mūlabhāṣā seem to be self proclaiming, "original language of all beings" is a very big claim putting itself at big stake, where it may fail in defining "sabbasattānaṃ ...

  

Thankfully, "*Neither of these claims is related to any claim about Sanskrit in texts such as Vakyapadiyam. Nowhere in these texts Sanskrit is claimed to be either the language spoken by dEvAh or sarvasatvAnAm mUlabhAshA*"

  

What I had in mind while approaching this was to find if we can establish a connection or statement in Sanskrit, for Sanskrit, to be associated to the first primordial *vAk*. I our tradition, as we know, 'all is One and One is all" so the lineage of first primordial *vAk and itsrevelationis the point.*

  

beyond that phenomenology begins to play its role and every language becomes evolutionary,...

I thank you all for your interests and forwarding clarifications...

Regards

Sati Shankar
