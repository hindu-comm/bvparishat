Namaste Professor Paturi ji



Either ways on your explanation of ‘Daivee-Vak’ and argument justification in two bases using ‘Adhyaatmika’, does not take out
SANSKRIT from the foot-locked position of ‘HISTORY-TIME FRAME –SOCIETY’ , the primary plank used by colonial teams to kick the ‘ traditionalists ! and improvisations of philology, literration provided by Professor Pollock.

Tracing the localtion of ‘Daivee- Maanushee vak’ in Rmayana is not sufficient answer to this question; and the historicity and society of Ramayana still locks the Sanskrit language to History and Past –period.



1**. IF** \< Sanskrit is derived from the Vedas. The Vedas are , (among other things), aadhyaatmika. Sanskrit acquired its aadhyaatmikata from its derivational source i.e. the Vedas.> **AND** \<VEDAS are HISTORIC>,
**THEN** how does it transcend ? The danger here is \<GODS ARE HUMAN CONSTRUCTIONS, The danger of Religion model, which vitiates the entire basics of Veda and Vedanta Shaastra chintana>. So at best, Sanskrit in its multiple flavors are ‘ language of Religion and scriptures of a community in a society, HISTORIC and of a PAST PERIOD.



2**. IF** \< Any language embodies the culture of its speakers. Speakers of Sanskrit have Dharma. Hence Sanskrit has Dharma. Dharma is (loosely) being looked at as aadhyaatmikata.> **AND** \< DHARMA, is a meaning –value association by a society and philosophers thinking> **THEN** it still remains HISTORIC and of a PAST PERIOD.



Any thing that is stamped with \< \> does not need any SACRED , TIME-TRANSCENDENT terms of reference. Therefore, Sanskrit studies does not have to be SACRED SPIRITUAL LINGUISITCS, which is the ‘ premise that needs to be addressed in the Battle For Sanskrit :Rajiv Malhotra’s demand asking Traditional Scholars to form Poorva-Paksha on Sheldon Pollock.



And do I have an answer? To this pertinent question raised by Rajiv Malhotra and pointing to the dangers of ‘ living with the inappropriate alternatives’? Yes, I believe I have a theory and am preparing to test it out in the coming days seeking audit from learned. The solution of ‘poorva-paksha and siddhanta’ is yet to come from ‘ traditional scholars, using traditional resources and in a way that can withstand the rigor of modern academia and logic, accommodating findings in anthropology, DNA science and other advancements in neuro-sciences’.



Do we have any better arguments, from Sanskrit Traditional Scholars, beyond regurgitation of the above traditional stand and reminders ?
The question has remained the bone of contention ,‘ improperly addressed for three hundred years plus. The colonial oriental rant attack goes on to make ‘Sanskrit a Cultural classical BUT historical societal language !’- And this is absolutely anti- position of all Veda-Vedanta schools ever since the ‘ conceptualization of ‘ Language as Brahmi – Veda –Bharatee/ Yoga-Bharatee’, whenever that happened, However it happened, Who ever did it to get in to human society and held by Indian traditionals as the sacro-sanct position ? Where did the traditionalists loose the bearing ? Where is the silver bullet hurting ?




I am equally concerned as all of you, in finding a proper answer for this challenge.
