There in that thread, I had to clarify:

  

The expression दैवी वाग्here has reference only to 'the divinity' ( a word of veneration based on the understanding that the purity preserves the original culture and spiritembodied in the language) of the 'pure' Sanskrit.

  

and in a later post I summed up:

  

1\. The appellation Daivee Vaak for Sanskrit, at least to the extent of its mention in Vaakyapadeeyam,does not carry the sense which is the same as or similartothe claims madeabout various languages that that language is the origin of all other languages.

2\. This appellation has got to do with the 'dharma' believed to be embodied /encapsulated in the 'original' Sanskrit due to its use by S'ishTas.

3\. Though many of the aspects of language/speech discussed in vaakyapadeeyam such asstages of speech production are सार्वत्रिकी / universal, the appellation Daivee Vaakis not intended to beसार्वत्रिकी / universalas 'dharma' believed to be embodied /encapsulated in the 'original' Sanskrit due to its use by S'ishTas isbelieved to be the exclusive feature of Sanskrit.
