\>IMHO - It is Humans who created the Gods and not the other way around.

  

The quotes do not substantiate the statement. They amount to motivating people towards purushakaara =human effort, not leaving things purely to divine help.

  

Karma theory unjustifiably maligned for being fatalistic or status-quoist. In fact, it is action-motivating and human effort motivating. To use it for fatalistic and status-quoist purposes is its misuse.

  

It is Vedic approach to treat dEvas as equals to humans and dEvas and humans as mutually nourishing.

  

देवान्भावयतानेन ते देवा भावयन्तु वः ।

परस्परं भावयन्तः श्रेयः परमवाप्स्यथ ॥ 3\\-11॥ Gita.

apaurushEyatva of the Vedas applies to apurushEyatva of dEvatAs too. So no dEvatA is man-made or man-created. Just as the Vedas are discovered , the dEvatAs which are associated with each mantra are discovered.

Coming to the claims by the Jains and the Buddhists, Prof. Aklujkar recently shared with this forum, one of his papers on the bases on which supremacy was claimed for Sanskrit. Even in that paper, I don't remember him saying that one of the bases was that Sanskrit was considered to be the language in which the dEvas spoke among themselves or that Sanskrit was the origin of all the other languages.
