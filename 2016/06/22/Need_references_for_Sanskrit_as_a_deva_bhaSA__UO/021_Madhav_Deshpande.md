If my memory serves me well, there is an excellent article on this topic by the late G. T. Deshpande, and could be found in the volume of his collected articles. Also keep in mind that the Jains and the Buddhists contested this status of Sanskrit. The Jains explicitly say that gods speak in the language of Ardhamāgadhī (devā addhamāgahāe bhāsāe bhāsanti), while for the Theravāda Buddhists, Pāli/Māgadhī is the original language of all beings (sabbasattānaṃ mūlabhāṣā). Best,
