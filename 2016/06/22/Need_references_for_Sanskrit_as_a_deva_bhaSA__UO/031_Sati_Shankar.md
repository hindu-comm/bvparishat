Dr. Yadu asks, "My question to all is Who Created Gods?"

  

I am sure, I will be enlightened by learned members on it.

However , I have some uneasiness with the word "created" or 'creation',

There is a full war going on between "Creationist Scientists" and "Evolutionary Scientists", on use of this word with respect to "Primordial" emanation or manifestation ...

The first, i.e., Creationist Group pleads "God 'created' this all" as the Bible says and denounce Charls Darwin's evolution, the other group the opposite.

  

If we accept our *Rig Veda*,129, *NAsadiya Sukta*, we do not find "creation", it is emanation or manifestation of Him, by himself, hence*"idam sarvam Brahma"*.

Here Gods are the "Man"(using another Biblical connotation) if we accept Man to honestly represent what we mean, and also the Man is Gods, separated by *mAyA.*

*  
*

*A lot of confusion is prevailing because of the "Free" use of words without giving a second thought if it really represents what we have in mind.*

  

In the light of the above I would like to be enlightened.

Regards

Sati Shankar
