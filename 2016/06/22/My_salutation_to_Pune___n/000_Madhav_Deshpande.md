My salutation to Pune (after reaching home in Ann Arbor):

  

सा पुण्या नगरी यया चिरतरं बाल्ये सुखं वर्धित: ।

दीपस्तम्भसमैरनेकगुरुभिर्यत्नैश्चिरं शिक्षित: ।।

यत्रानेकसुह्रद्वरै: सह मया सख्यं समासादितम् ।

दूरस्थोऽपि न विस्मरामि नगरीं तां पुण्यनाम्नीमहम् ।।

  

"That is the City of Pune that raised me for long in happiness, where I was trained for long with great effort by teachers who were my guiding lights, and where I found great friendship with many wonderful friends. I cannot forget that City of Pune, even though I am far away from it."
