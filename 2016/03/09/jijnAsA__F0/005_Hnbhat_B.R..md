But the word बिल्म is explained as भिल्मम्, भासनमिति वा by Yaska himself.

  

बिल्मम् = भिल्मम् भासनम् इति वा\|

  

भिल्मम् = वेदानां भेदनम्, व्यासर्थः:। = expansion, division by splitting words according to Durgacharya.

  

  

भासनमिति वा। is explained by Durgacharya as

  

भासनमेव बिल्मशब्देनोच्यते। वेदाङ्गविज्ञानेन भासते = प्रकाशतेे वेदार्थ इति।

  

अत इदमुक्तं बिल्ममिति। एवम्, भिदेर्भासतेर्वा बिल्मशब्दः।

  

By this explanation, the word is derived from the roots भिदिर् = विदारणे, = to split, or भासृ = दीप्तौ, to shine, manifest.
