Dear Dr. Joshi,  
  
I explain the meaning to be accepted in the context of the Bhartṛ-hari passage on pp. 23-25. Which part of that explanation is unclear to you?  
  
I have prepared a historical study of the meanings of bilma. It will be a while before I can share it with others. My semantic history, however, will not affect what we need for the Bhartṛ-hari passage.  
  
a.a.
