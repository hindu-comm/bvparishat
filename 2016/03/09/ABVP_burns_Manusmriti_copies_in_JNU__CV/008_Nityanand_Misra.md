*Mea culpa*. I should have linked [here](http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=4&verse=34), which has English translations by Sahih International, Muhammad Marmaduke Pickthall, Abdullah Yusuf Ali, Muhammad Habib Shakir, Shaykh Muhammad Sarwar, Muhammad Muhsin Khan, and Arthur John Arberry Arberry. I should have also linked to the 30+ English translations of Ephesians [5:22](http://www.biblestudytools.com/ephesians/5-24-compare.html), [5:23](http://www.biblestudytools.com/ephesians/5-23-compare.html), and [5:24](http://www.biblestudytools.com/ephesians/5-22-compare.html) in the New Testament.

  

The point I am making is one can easily find similar content in sacred books of other religions. No prizes for guessing why the students chose only the *Manusmṛti*, which is as sacred a scripture to me (यद्वै किं च॒ मनु॒रव॑द॒त्तद्भे॑ष॒जम्, कृ॰य॰ तै॰सं॰ २.२.१०.२) as the Quran is to a practising Muslim or the New Testament is to a practising Christian: offending Hindus is safe for them. Shows their hypocrisy.

  

PS: I have not cross-checked the two sites with the published versions of translations for inconsistencies (if any), those interested may do so.
