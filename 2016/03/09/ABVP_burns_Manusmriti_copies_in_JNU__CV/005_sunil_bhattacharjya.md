This is all happening due to poor knowledge of Indian history and culture, some group of people have. Manu Smriti was a text valid for the very ancient society. After the Manu Smriti there were the Gautama Smriti and the Yajnavalkya smriti for the times of Ramayana. Later during the Mahabharata times the the valid Smritis were of Sankha and Likhita. After the Mahabharata times Parashara Smriti is the Smriti to be followed. Ignorant people who are burning the Manu Smriti are living in their imaginary world or they have some ulterior motive behind their agitation by taking up a fake issue.
