Namaste,

  

I think ABVP is not aware of 6.4.6 and 6.4.7 of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad.

  

(From English translation by Swami Nikhilananda of RK Math)

  

6. Now, if a man sees himself (his reflection) in water, he should recite the following mantra: "May the gods bestow on me vigour, manhood, fame, wealth and merit."  
In praise of the wife who will bear him a son: She (his wife) has put on the soiled clothes of impurity; she is, verily, loveliness among women. Therefore when she has removed the clothes of impurity and appears beautiful, he should approach her and speak to her.  
  
7. If she does not willingly yield her body to him, he should buy her with presents. If she is still unyielding, he should strike her with a stick or with his hand and overcome her, repeating the following mantra: "With power and glory I take away your glory." Thus she becomes discredited.



regards  
shankara
