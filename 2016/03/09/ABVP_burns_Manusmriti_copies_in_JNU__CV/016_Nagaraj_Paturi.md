Dear Vidwan Alankar Sharmaji,



I agree with you that newspaper title could be misleading, probably for the reasons of sensationalization as you mentioned or with conscious political goals in mind.



AadaraNIya Sri V Subrahmanianji just copied the newspaper title as the title of the thread. You may be right in thinking that it helps the purpose of the manipulator, if any.



But since you mention that "There were three people who were connected with ABVP (engaging personally and according to them they are ready to be kicked out from ABVP) in this misadventure but it has no backing from ABVP. It was called by several other Leftist Student unions even after no permission from the JNU University administrators.",



may I guess that you have access to some of the youngsters on this campus?



If yes, please try to share your knowledge, adding that gained from this forum, among those who are not yet closed in their mind.



'Encouraging lustful outlook towards women is the cause of vulnerability of women, not some books which are not used by anyone today.' should be realized.



Thanks for your useful observations.
