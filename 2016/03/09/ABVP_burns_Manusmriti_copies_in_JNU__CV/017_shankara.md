Namaste,

  

Decades of negative propaganda on Manusmriti and similar literature has eventually influenced the views of the right wing also. Please read the article on Manusmriti by Svargiya Ashok Singhalji, wherein he says that ' (we} totally reject the Manu Smriti as it has no place in a civilized & cultured society'.

I feel that it is the duty of Sanskrit scholars to present a balanced view on Manusmriti before the society.

  

regards  
shankara
