It is only pretended that almost all Hindus are swearing by, and strictly adhering to, the injunctions of*Manusmrti*, whereas the reality is that even among the "upper classes", less than 0.001 per cent has actually gone through the text even once in their lifetime. Most people know the name of the text only on account of one verse (ably handled by yourself), and nothing more.

  

Sri Nityananda Mishra has very well set forth the blatant and brazen posturing and speciousness of the protesters.

  

To heartily concur with Prof Paturi, nothing was deemed beneath dignity than forcing a woman to fend for herself. Such was also the stand taken by Dr DVGundappa, one of the great luminaries of our own times, renowned for his sagacity and wisdom, such as elicited the appreciation even of Ananda Coomaraswamy.
