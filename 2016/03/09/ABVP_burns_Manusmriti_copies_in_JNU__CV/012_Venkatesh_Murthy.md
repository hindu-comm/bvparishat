Namaste

  

It is well known Hindu society has oppressed women and even today female babies are aborted. The sex ratio is North Indian states is very bad because of this many eligible males are not even getting girls to marry. It is not a secret today females in India are not respected and even female babies are killed. There are so many problems for parents of girls like dowry and NRI husbands leaving the wives in India and absconding in foreign countries.

  

But the solution to this is not to burn Manu Smrti. If ABVP is angry about female inequality they have to attack the badpractices of treating women as inequal. Manu Smrti is notconnected to this inequality. Conditions in ancient India were not like today. We will not find Manu Smrti sayingfemale babies must be aborted. This female baby abortion is modern invention. Is it not?
