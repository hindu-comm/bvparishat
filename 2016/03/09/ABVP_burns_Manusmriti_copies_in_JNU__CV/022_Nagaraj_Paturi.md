Is this not in contradiction with the fact that VHP , a member of Sangh Parivar stated on its website long time back that



'' (we} totally reject the Manu Smriti as it has no place in a civilized & cultured society'.'



Thus the news item cited latest in the thread is a continuation of the manipulation.



On the one hand, thevarious member organizations of the Sangh Parivar keep on talkingabout Hindutva unifiedsurpassing all divides including that of caste, the news manipulations of this kind , on the other side, keep reinforcing the stereotype of 'Hindutva' as casteist or caste-based etc.



There were news articles blaming Sangh Parivar for forging a Hindutva on the lines of semitic religions, which means unification beyond caste lines and the same news papersblame the idea of 'Hindutva' as casteist and caste-based.



Arya Samaj too rejects caste system completely and accepts non-birth-based varNa system. It contends that vishuddh Manu Smriti is in line with their philosophy.



In spite of all this, to repeatedly link caste system via Manu Smriti to 'Hindutva' can only be seen as manipulation.
