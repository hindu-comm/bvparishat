Respected Scholars,  
  
I believe this a related question to the discussion. This is about the causal entailment of burning a text like Manusmriti or for that matter other blasphemous texts at different points in time.  
  
1. The people who are burning Manusmriti think that their action is going to result in the end of 'discrimination' (this may be a first step in their series of actions) - in the negative sense of the term. Would it result in the end of 'discrimination' which is key for discernment also?  
  
2. Quite contrary to what the actors who are involved in this expect, burning the text, which for the people who are performing the act is full of life personifying the 'evil' they intend to eradicate, are in the process letting the fire consume such 'evil' and thereby raise such kind of smoke which rises to the skies, mixes with the clouds and spreads itself across the board when they shower, which in turn results in the growth of such crops that spread the spirit of that 'evil'.  
  
If on analysis, if the second causal entailment holds, wouldn't it be appropriate for this group to engage in the possibility of strengthening it?  
  
In my little understanding of the study of Dharmasastra-s from Manusmiriti to Parasara Smriti -- and if broadly the Sastra-s are divided as Achara, Vyavahara and Prayaschitta --  
(1) I find there is no change in Achara for the entire Manvantara -- so Manusmriti holds;  
(2) Vyavahara has changed is what we witness everyday -- so the work of agencies that uphold the Achara should be towards how can the Vyavahara be in line with the Achara.  
(3) Prayaschitta-s have been simplified in order to keep the diminished senses of shakti and yukti amongst peoples of the world.  
  
How far can we make causal analyses with the help of our Darsana-s, specifically Nyaya-Vaiseshika and Mimamsa?  
  
Thank you..  
  
Sincerely,  
Pranav  
Student of Dharmasastra-s and the Constitution of India
