Hi,

  

With all good discussion going on on burning Manusmriti is good but do not agree with the subject of this post, which is wrong. I want to object that the news paper "Hindu"'s title for the news is wrong. There were three people who were connected with ABVP (engaging personally and according to them they are ready to be kicked out from ABVP) in this misadventure but it has no backing from ABVP. It was called by several other Leftist Student unions even after no permission from the JNU University administrators.

  

If you read different newspapers you'll get gist of it. Actually the media currently do not work as a mediator or balancing actor, it is always tilted towards something and make it news and its title in a way it is catchy and looks wonderful. Any Leftist party's burning of Manusmriti is no news however burning it by BJP, ABVP, or any other right winger is a news and can catch your eyes.

  

Please avoid such sentimentalization and sensation generated from media at least in this group. I humbly request to change the title of this post to which is the matter we are discussing i.e. "Burning of Manusmriti"

  

Thanks,

alankar Sharma
