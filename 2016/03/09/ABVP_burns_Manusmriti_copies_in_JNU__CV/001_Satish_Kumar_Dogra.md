When ABVP burns copies of Manusmriti, one could see a political motive in it. One could be to please the Dalits in view of the forthcoming elections and the other could be to distant themselves from the charge that ABVP is trying to gain domination in educational institutions in order to bring about saffronisation and a resurgence of the Hindu past.  
  

Burning ancient books is a symbolic rejection of one's history. Today we may disagree with a lot that we find in ancient books, but these remarks were made in a context that is a part of our history. If we have outgrown those narrow feelings, we should be happy. But instead of outright rejection of those ideas, we must put them in their historical perspective. An ancient building may not possess the type of ventilation that modern architecture provides. Yet, for that reason, it would not be logical to bring down that building. It is a part of our heritage and we must protect it.
