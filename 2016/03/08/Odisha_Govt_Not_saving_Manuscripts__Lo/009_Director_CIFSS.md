Hari Om

It was very glad that earlier OSM had possessed 60,000 PL manuscripts but it is sad that it became less 10000 and again became less 13000 manuscripts vanished. According to National Mission for Mnauscripts record, it was told and recorded that 37000 manuscripts were deposited in the museum and the collection process was going on from different parts of Orissa. According to that process of collection, it would have more that 50,000 till date. But it is very unfortunate and bad for the Odisha state that at present very less number of manuscripts around 20000 are deposited. Day will come, no manuscript will be there in OSM, The State govt should take care and proper step to keep preserve these heritage. And also proper investigation should be taken up why the manuscripts are vanishing day by day.
