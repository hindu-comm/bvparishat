Coming from Orissa, I must apologize for this terrible act. Orissa has been a target for the

manuscript smugglers and the temple artifacts. If India is wounded through colonialism,

Orissa is wounded through negligence and apathy. The government is not up to the mark

and malfunctioning is rampant. I am glad the disease is being noticed at large. All

scholars must condemn such acts. We also must be on guard to our colleagues in the

west who make it a habit to "procure" the manuscripts through various means.

i learn that Orissa Govt is broke!
