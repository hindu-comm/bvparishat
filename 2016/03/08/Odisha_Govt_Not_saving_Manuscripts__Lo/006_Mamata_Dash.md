With regards to all the Vidvaans in the group, I apologize for this news. In fact the scholars (so called) dealing with manuscripts in Odisha are yet to be educated about the text and a codex. The misunderstanding starts with that. When some of the repositories count every single text i.e. a stotra or a mantra, Odisha Museum has counted the text as Stutistotra and a number of stotras has been accounted as one. Thus the confusion starts. The curator of the section should give the explanation about the confusion. Thay have made the manuscripts as a fixeddepositand get all the credits not doing any thing for thenational heritage.
