I only spoke on whether राष्ट्रीय is Paninian or not, and not any other form ending in ईय (देशीय, शास्त्रीय, वर्गीय, etc). There are two suffixes, the rarer suffix इय् (results from घ by the rule आयनेयीनीयियः फढखच्छघां प्रत्ययादीनाम्, 7.1.2‌) and and the more common suffix ईय् (results from छ by the same rule). There are rules and exceptions for both suffixes. For a summary, one may refer A Dictionary of Sanskrit Grammar under

and

देशीय, शास्त्रीय, वर्गीय, etc are correct forms as they have the suffix छ, which is blocked from the word राष्ट्र by 4-2-93 राष्ट्रावारपाराद्घखौ.

  

In a lighter vein, if one were to ask if a form ending in ईय is Paninian or not, then the first word in question should be पाणिनीय leading to the question:

**Q: Is the word पाणिनीय पाणिनीय or is it अपाणिनिय?**

(The answer is that पाणिनीय is surely पाणिनीय as the word पाणिनि gets the suffix छ by combining तेन प्रोक्तम्‌ (4.3.101) and वृद्धाच्छः (4.2.113).
