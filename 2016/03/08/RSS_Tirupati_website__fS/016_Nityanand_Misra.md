I do not understand the question. Saying something is राष्ट्रिय does not amount to saying it is not राष्ट्रीय. So the question why something that is called राष्ट्रिय cannot be beneficial to the राष्ट्र is अनुपपन्न.

  

When the institute itself chose the name राष्ट्रियसंस्कृतविद्यापीठम्, then why call it or write its name as राष्ट्रीयसंस्कृतविद्यापीठम्?

  

The name of an institute is a proper noun, and so it should be used and spelt the way the institute uses or spells it.
