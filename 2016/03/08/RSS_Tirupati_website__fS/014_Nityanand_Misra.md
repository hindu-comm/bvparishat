Thanks Janardana Hegde Ji for the article. I stand corrected. The opinion of Ramashankara Bhattacharya Ji seems correct, that outside the śaiṣika prakaraṇa, cha is possible from rāṣṭra by ‘tasmai hitam’ (A 5.1.5) as has explained. राष्ट्रीय़ would be correct if the intended sense is “beneficial for the rāṣṭra.”
