Actually, it is the edited out portion of a paper accepted for publication, authored by yours truly and Prof. Korada Subrahmanyam. The paper discusses शब्दनित्यता and this material was initially included to show that the Mimamsaka holds Sabda to be nitya, not because of a lack of understanding of its nature, but because for him Sabda is something beyond "sound" as normally understood, or Sabda as understood by a Naiyayika. In the final review, this portion was edited out due to space constraints and because the other school which was treated at length was Vyakarana, and not Nyaya.

  

Yours truly

N. Siva Senani
