Dear Sri Nori,

Wonderful! Thanks for this educative piece. Please post more such material. I am personally interested in sky pictures and description of natural phenomena ( references to Year, tithi, eclipses, comets, nakshatras, rainfall, floods, earthquakes...) in Purvamimamsa literature.

I would be thankful for further pointers in this direction.

best regards

  

RN Iyengar
