Prof. Dominik Wujastyk, the moderator of the Indology list, in one of his offline conversations with me wrote:

  

"I personally find that I am often seduced by the apparent modernity of ancient India. These guys 2000 years ago were having such *modern* discussions in some cases, using such recognizable forms of thinking and tackling questions that we still think about today, that it's easy (for me, at least) to forget that twenty *centuries* separate us"
