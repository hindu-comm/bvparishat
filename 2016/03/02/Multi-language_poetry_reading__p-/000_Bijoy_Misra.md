Friends,

We would be doing a multi-language poetry

reading for mothers and young adults on Saturday.

The program is called "Voice of the Mothers and the Youth."

We are looking for poems that has influenced mothers over time

and that they pass on to their children. It can be in any language.

You can send me a copy or give me a link. Tell me which

language such that I get the right reader. Please write by Friday.

I am attaching the flyer.

Best regards,

BM
