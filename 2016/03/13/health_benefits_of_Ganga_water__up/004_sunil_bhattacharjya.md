Yes, There were papers which I read years ago. You may look up the CA (Chemical Abstracts) of the 1970s and 1980s, where you should be able to locate those. I am sure Harvard would have those., Further the purifying property of the Ganga water is best upto Hardwar and later on the river water does not retain that capacity, due to dowwn-stream pollution. This is not a new phenomenon, as this was recognized in the ancient times itself. That is why there is a practice from the ancient times to bring Ganga water from Hardwar to the Vishwanath temple in Varanasi, for the daily puja.
