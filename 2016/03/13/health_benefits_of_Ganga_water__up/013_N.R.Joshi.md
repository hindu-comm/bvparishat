Thank you Dr. Yadu Moharir for Arsenic in Ganga water articles.



Your scientific explanations on this list multiple timesare appreciated. In your other articles you stressed the usefulness of our (Indian) traditions.



Your two books -one on Shree Sookta and other on Shree Ganesh also offer new rational concepts based on Viniyoga. I recommend these two books to the readers of BVP. I enjoyed them and they offered new vision to look at those two deities. Thanks. N.R.Joshi.
