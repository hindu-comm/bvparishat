Respected Scholars,

  

It is OK to sing glories of Ganges but scientific fact cannot and should not be ignored or shoved under the carpet.

  

[Int J Environ Health Res.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16546805# "International journal of environmental health research.") 2006 Apr;16(2):113-32.

# The role of water use patterns and sewage pollution in incidence of water-borne/enteric diseases along the Ganges river in Varanasi, India.

[Hamner S](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Hamner%20S%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=16546805)¹, [Tripathi A](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Tripathi%20A%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=16546805), [Mishra RK](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Mishra%20RK%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=16546805), [Bouskill N](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Bouskill%20N%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=16546805), [Broadaway SC](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Broadaway%20SC%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=16546805), [Pyle BH](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Pyle%20BH%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=16546805), [Ford TE](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Ford%20TE%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=16546805).

I can site several more papers that have discussed this issue in more details.  

High levels of Arsenic are fortunately playing a beneficial role, however, the quality of consumable water is degrading in a logarithmic scale. Hepato-toxicity and manifestation of other issues are serious.

  

Yes, in some parts or Ganga and Brahmaputra concentration of Dissolved Oxygen is high that helps support the natural clean-up for theses rivers, however, as it reaches the the Delta oxygen contents are extremely low. Again, one needs to be aware of seasonal variations of oxygen contents. There are several papers that have discussed it. Now, coming to Silver content, it was attributed to tossing silver coins in the rivers unlike Arsenic that is naturally found in the region through which theses rivers flow.
