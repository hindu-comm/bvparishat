Namaste,  
  

The dissolved oxygen (DO) levelt in clean water is hardly 7 or 8 ppm, depending on the temperature of water and in polluted water the presence of biodegradable organic matter (as measured in terms of the BOD(5-day) utilizes that DO and DO levels in polluted water is depleted. . Even though the air has about 20 % oxygen and it goes on replenishing the DO, if the BOD load is very high, the DO level in the water would not appear. As a result the aquatic life would be badly affected. By controlling the discharge of sewage to Ganga would mainly reduce this BOD-pollutional load. However the other pollutional load would need other means of pollution control.  
  

I am surprised at the statement that silver coiuns are the source of Silver in Ganga water. Is there any reference on it. I guessed the natural source of silver in the Himalayan region to be the source of Silver that gave us Ganga-water with high keeping quality, upto the Hardwar area.
