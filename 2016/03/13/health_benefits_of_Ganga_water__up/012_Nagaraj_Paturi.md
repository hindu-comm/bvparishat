\>It is OK to sing glories of Ganges but scientific fact cannot and should not be ignored or shoved under the carpet.



If you read through the thread, you might notice that we are all on the same page.



Almost every post is talking about the other side of the picture too.



No attempt to shove anything under the carpet.



The interesting aspect of all is that what was considered is a mere religious belief, the 'purity' and 'cleaning' power of our river Ganga is not without any basis.



It is also true that manmadeproblems are responsible for the present bad condition of the river at some locations.



Let us hope that the project to clean the sacred river will soon ge executed to its completion.



Regards,



Nagaraj
