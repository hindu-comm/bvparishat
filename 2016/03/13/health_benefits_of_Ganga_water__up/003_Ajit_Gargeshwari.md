Several explanations for self-purification were put forward, though none of these could justify this unique observation. The investigations carried out by NEERI, claims Dr.Chakrabarti, might provide a credible explanation to the observed self-preservation capacity of the Ganges. Dr Chakrabarti explains: “Ganga sediment adsorbs coliphages and induces their proliferation. The coliphages thus adsorbed predate on coliforms and other bacteria in overlying water column when the sediment and water co-exist in a container under static condition. And all this activity happens quickly and continuously.” This activity is not seen in any other river, which is why under static conditions all other river waters become putrid and polluted, the NEERI report holds.
