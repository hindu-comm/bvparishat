Dear Moderatorji,  
  

Sorry again.Kindly permit me to repost the paper as it got garbled again, due to some problem in my computer. The reposted mail is as follows :  

  

Dear Prof. Nagarajji,  
  

It is very sad to see that he Ganga-water quality has deteriorated in the last few decades due to increased anthropogenic activities.In the paper of Bhutiani etal. entitled “***Assessing environmental contamination of River Ganga using correlation and multivariate analysis*****',** published in ***Pollution,1(3): 265-273,*** *Summer 2015,* ** the authors have rued as follows:

***Since past few decades, due to population explosion and rapid industrialization, the beautiful river has been exploited beyond its carrying capacity.*** ***Its sacredness has been endangered due to unregulated human activities such as sewage and industrial wastes disposal, dead bodies disposal, deforestation, excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides, bathing during Ardhkumbh and MahaKumbh, pilgrimage etc. However, municipal discharge contributes to the pollution of RiverGanges in the Haridwar and Rishikesh region due to high influx of tourists and related activities*.**  

In conclusion the authors wrote as follows:  
  
  

***In this study, four most significant factors were identified as causal agent of temporal variation at all the study's sites. The first two factors indicated anthropogenic influence on the overall river water quality due to domestic sewage, agricultural runoff and slight land use activities. The third and fourth factors represented anthropogenic impacts such as industrial and mining activities. The results showed that physico-chemical parameters namely total coliform, feacal coliform, nitrate, sodium, phosphate, sulphate and TDS, temperature, BOD, calcium and chloride were principal factors contributing to pollution load. Similar results were reported in another study of River Cauvery in Karnataka, India where the main factors included BOD, COD, TC, FC, Conductivity, TDS and chlorides (Sudevi and Lokesh, 2012). The overall analysis supported the fact that the main contributors towards the temporal variation among the parameters in river water were Domestic and other discharges*.**  
****

In the past the keeping quality of Ganga-water (particulay when collected before the Triveni--sangam, where Yamuna meets Ganga) was unmatched by any other river-water quality**.** The Government agencies have been working for sometime on reducing the polutional load and hopefully we can look forward to the day when the Ganga water would have the quality, as was available in the past,  

Regards,

Sunil Bhattacharjya
