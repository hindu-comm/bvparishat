Well said Dr. Joshi.  
  
Arsenic is a big concern now. of the health authorities not only in India but even of the agencies like EPA in USA, and a lot of research efforts are going on in USA for finding the appropriate arsenic treatment technologies to achieve the arsenic maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 10 parts per billion (ppb), which was set in 2001, though initially a level of 5 ppb was thought of in the beginning. In India, the Arsenic problem is more acute in case of consumers, who depend on ground water from wells, tube-wells and ponds / tanks, as the Arsenic levels are generally much higher in the ground water than in the surface waters like that of the Indian rivers..  
  

Thanks,
