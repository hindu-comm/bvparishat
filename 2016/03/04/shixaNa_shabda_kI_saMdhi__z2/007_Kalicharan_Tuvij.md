Dr.Joshi-ji,

  

I recently came to know of yourवर्णवाद in BVP archive, and then alsoread your article on sukta-sumana-blog where you say to the effect that Panini took the snapshot of a whole language,Sanskrit as it existed then,and in this way arrested any further degradation. Surelythis is the genius of Panini.

  

If you have relatedpaper in public domain,kindlysend me a link. I also went through your interactions with Dr. B.V.K where he stressed on the need fora bigger context for the theory. (I think I may just fill in a bit here ).

  

वर्णवाद could wellbe the rightkey. We mightas well put it into the lock and see.

नमस्ते,

  

I misunderstood the question, and posted in haste. I stopped short of apologising in my last post after finding that शिक्ष् isderived from शक्. Though not convinced (with शक्), I anywaycommitted a grave mistake by not knowing this fact. Sorry.

  

However, it is not everyday that a root is derived from another root (e.g. the desiderative). But we must understand that वर्णवाद (if I am not wrong) tris to find the meaning of a root. Deriving inflections (or internal sandhi) from aroot is not its objective. Making new words,is.

  

There isn't any authority, or reference. Perhaps you can enlighten me if the meaning of roots (not merely वर्ण)have been gone into by any school. I even checked the PIE dictionary, where क्ष is assigned a ludicrous meaning "earth"/ ज़मीन.

  

  

P.S. On 2nd thoughts, "शि = projecting"seems a better representation.
