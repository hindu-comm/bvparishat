If you mean learning by शिक्षण then the root is clearly शिक्ष् (शिक्षँ विद्योपादाने धा॰पा॰ ६०५) and not any other.

  

One can derive शिक्षण from the desiderative form of the verb शक् (शकॢँ शक्तौ,धा॰पा॰ ६०५, प्रकृत्यां शक्नोति सनि शिक्षति), but then the meaning of शिक्षण would be "the act of desiring to be capable".
