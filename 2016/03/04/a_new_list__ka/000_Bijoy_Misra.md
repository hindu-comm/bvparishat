Friends,

I think we have to engineer a different list on the political interpretation derived from the texts.

When people wish to rule others, they have to find tactics and strategy. English education,

creating "holy" Brahmins, perpetuating castes, denigrating literature, looking down on scholarly

work - are all parts of this unfortunate technique. India has been a victim of it. It is gratifying

that people like Rajiv are analyzing these. We should create a forum for muscular and scholarly

discussion on these topics. I invite individuals who may help in organizing the forum.

Such analysis is new for the Indian scholars, but is necessary in my view. Rajv Malhotra

calls it Purva-paksha, but it is larger. My view is that most of india's history is casually

reported and needs scholarly analysis. Please think about it. 

Thank you.

Bijoy Misra
