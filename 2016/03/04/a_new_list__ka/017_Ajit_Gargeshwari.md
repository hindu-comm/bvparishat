Shivaraji,  

I accept your spirit and intent behind. But lets us not stop people from creating anew list. Every one has a right to start a list a blog or to write and do any activities that hey feel are good. Its up to individuals to decide. As far as politics is concerned It will not be discussed on this last. Please feel free to write to list Owners prof Pandurangi or Prof Varakhedi for any further clarification of the list  

  

Regards
