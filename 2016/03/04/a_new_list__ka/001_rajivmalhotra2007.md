Great idea. Someone pls start this list. I would love to join. It should include the broad scope of Indology.  
  
We cannot remain colonized, always being monitored to make sure we limit ourselves into a tiny corner, while Western scholars have the entire kurukshetra as their playing field.  
  
In my book's section titled, "*The death of purva-paksha*", I argue that India's decline is partly related to its withdrawal into an increasingly internalized/inbred mentality.  
  
During my event at KSU, Bangalore, last month, Prof. Lakshmithathachar remarked that the Indian traditional Sanskrit scholars have let us down - precisely because of failure to do purva-paksha of western Indology. Some other prominent scholars present proudly and loudly asserted their interest and support for purva-paksha projects to deconstruct Western Indology. They organized follow up meetings with me just to discuss the next steps. Afterwards, I received emails with proposals for funding such purva-paksha workshops about Pollock's work.  
  
But once the Murthy family started a massive $$$ media campaign (which will have short-term influence only), these very same persons wrote emails saying that they should resist doing anything critical of Pollock, because Sudha Murthy was going to give them crores of grants... Wow! Money can make some people change their minds so radically.
