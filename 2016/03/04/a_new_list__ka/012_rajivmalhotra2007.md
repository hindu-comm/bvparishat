Problem with Ajit is not just list charter, but also his specific biases on Pollock vs me. Read his blatant ad hominens against me which Ashok Aklujkar was kind enough to dispute. For the moderator to be so prejudiced is amazing and a sure death wish. I will let the new list build up first, and then post some rejoinders to his ilk. I have my own list of 6,200 members and at the right time I will recommend that many of them join the new Indology list. It will become much larger than this one.
