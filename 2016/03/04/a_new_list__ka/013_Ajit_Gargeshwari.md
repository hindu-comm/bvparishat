I only go by my conviction alone in life. You are welcome to build a larger list or the largest list in the world. I like Sanskrit more than individuals. Please don't involve me for I am not interested. You may write what ever you deem fit either here or any where else we. All live in a free world If you plan to write about me you will have nothing to write except my postal address For I am no one absolutely no one at all. If you want me to say i admire I will not if you want me to say I disrespect you views no I don't. If you think I am for Pollock I am not. if you think I am anti Pollock i am not. If you think you are right you are. If your book has made you bigger than what you are you are. If you feel I need act or think differently I may. If you say I need to listen to your threats or views I may not .I have not and I repeat never made ad hominens against you or any one in my life an don't intend to. If you still feel I have I apologise the reason being you are  

Let me reapeat I never amde donot oe will not make ad hominens against you or any body else. If you such a sensetive person how can I help
