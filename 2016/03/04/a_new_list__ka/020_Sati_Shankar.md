mAnyavar,

  

I reached to this thread from the meta-indology, just to see why meta... came in existence.

And got an impression which is prompting me to help keeping in mind the de-limit and re-defined view which we , being have been here.

In fact it has been hovering in my mind the whole day today and as night has approached now came this discussion.

  

The question of sAstra, and scriptures, interest group based political and manipulated interpretations, Western and Indian interpretation, business model based promotion and interpretation, laymen interpretation all are the parts of our social life and every one is free to chose according to one's priority.so I think, practically speaking, we have no control on one's choice as word is very big and avenues unlimited and open.

  

I am writing this way because I myself have been a free wanderer and where ever got interested, driven by my inner force only, joined, made it my home , but always "स्थितिप्रज्ञ. 

In the light the above we must keep in mind are here to learn, disseminate, defend, protect, promote out heritage with special reference to Sanskrit literature(?) Scriptures defined as the objects of this Group .

  

Recent Pollock related issues force me to review what we really want and why.Some points are worth noting:

  

\(1\) We agree that Western Indologists have not only not given the correct interpretation of our scriptures but have tried to adulterate and project denounced image. And it is our responsibility to protect our pride, and heritage and explain to the world the correct picture. We have to accept that the western indology world will not accept it, thereby making the world divided.And we can not do much to eliminate this divide and major part is interest driven.

  

\(2\) Prof. Pollock was opposed, but for what ? We have no authority to object on his political and religious attachments, being his personal matter, which may or may not reflect in his academic works as presupposition.We have right to object only to his professional flaws and errors and to it he has no right to oppose but to defend himself..

  

\(3\) On Mr. Murthys and their financing- we all know they are successful business men with commitments to their business and to their business ethics.We have no right to direct them where to spend and where to not, unless it is from public fund, and in that case laws are there to make queries on utilization of the fund, on fund's resident or foreign status,and related tax issues. It is their money and they know better how to spend it.

  

\(4\) Criticisms are also on faulty translations of Indian classics, its responsibility goes to the translators and editors, and wise will be if we ourselves work on it and prepare a better and correct translation, which can compete the Harvard classics in question in correctness and semantically beautiful, lest aside its get up.

  

\(5\) Finally, the list...... be it BVP or Meta-Indology.. or any and many more, existing or forthcoming,.. people are free, technology is free, and so is the willingness.

But we must understand that list is a means of gathering people of same feather, same interests with same objectives, but if above is the aim, no lists can be exclusive as all all the Indians with the bent in question are a list in themselves, some active, some not. but most support.

  

So we have no alternative, other than to raise our professional standards and honestly create, nourish and promote our own heritage on our own and in doing so we must be prepared साठे साठयम समाचरेत्  

Hope we all are for the same service.

Regards

Sati Shankar
