I am not making any new rules. Politics is not discussed on BVP List that is all. Thismailing list for Sanskrit Researchers working from India.To be explicit this mailing list acts as a platform to **share ideas and research papers** in the areas of **Sanskrit Research, Indology, Indian Philosophy, Sanskrit Literature, Grammar, Science etc**

  
I repeat my question again
