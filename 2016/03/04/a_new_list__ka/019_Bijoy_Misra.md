I have something to say on this since I suggested a diversion.

BVP has been beautiful to discuss Sanskrit and the Shastra.

It should not care how some people might interpret Shastra.

BVP is into the meaning and grammatical preservation and

must demand good command of Sanskrit to participate in

the discussion.

The new group is Ok to be with the derived Shastra literature

worldwide. However it should not be reactionary, but must be

equally scholarly as BVP. The participants should not just be

chauvinistic, but strongly analytic. Most in BVP should join

to expose themselves about the literature abroad. The task is

much larger than simply writing blogs. I would encourage the

new participants to spend time in getting a good grinding in

Sanskrit such that they create their own viewpoint to critique

the hijacked literature. It will be slow, but India is expected

to win the battle. We have to help write new interpretations

that children can study.
