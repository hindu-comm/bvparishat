Dear sirs, let me clarify the following:

  

The new list is not an indology list, rather a meta-indology list. The subject of Indology is India, the subject of meta-Indology is the discipline of Indology. So, Indologists takes on Indological topics are germane there. There is no intention whatsoever of supplanting BVP or indology lists, since they adequately serve Indology but poorly serve meta-Indology.
