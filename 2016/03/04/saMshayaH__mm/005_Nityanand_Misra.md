Dear list

  

While commenting on ‘ūnārtha’ in ‘pūrvasadṛśasamonārthakalahanipuṇamiśraślakṣṇaiḥ’ (A 2.1.31), the *Bālamanoramā* explains the example ‘māṣavikalam’ as “māṣeṇa vikalamiti vigrahaḥ; hīnamityarthaḥ.” If the word ‘hīna’ is also taken as ‘ūnārthaka’ like the word ‘vikala’, then the *jñāpana* in the rule ‘pūrvasadṛśasamonārthakalahanipuṇamiśraślakṣṇaiḥ’ (A 2.1.31) is what indicates that th instrumental case is to be used with the word ‘hīna’ (उपपद विभक्ति).

  

Note that Patañjali rejects the word ‘artha’ in the rule ‘pūrvasadṛśasamonārthakalahanipuṇamiśraślakṣṇaiḥ’ (A 2.1.31) but Kaiyaṭa and Yudhiṣṭhira Mīmāṃsaka favour reading the word. Rama Nath Sharma has nicely summarized this in his commentary on A 2.1.31 (The Aṣṭādhyāyī of Pāṇini, Volume III, 1995, ISBN 81-215-0653-0, p.33). Sharma adds that if Patañjali’s rejection is accepted, then ‘māṣavikalam’ can be derived using the previous rule ‘tṛtīyā tatkṛtārthena guṇavacanena’ (A 2.1.30) as ‘māṣeṇa kṛto vikalam’. Then, ‘dharmahīnaḥ’ can similarly be derived as ‘dharmeṇa kṛto hīnaḥ’ in which the instrumental case is indeed by ‘karttṛkaraṇayostṛtīyā’ (A 2.3.18) (कारक विभक्ति) with ‘dharma’ being the ‘kartā’ as Svāmī Lalitālālita Jī has pointed out.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
