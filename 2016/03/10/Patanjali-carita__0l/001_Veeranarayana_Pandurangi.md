sir

thanks to the newly installed "everything" explorer, this book is published by nirnayasagar 1895 ed. by Sivadatta shastri lahore. following is the thing that I once got it from that book.

  

Patanjalicharitam is the work of Ramabhadradikshita who belonged to Tanjore court.

This work contains the life-story of Patanjali and that of Chandragupta who studied the Mahabhaya from the one disciple of Patanjali.

Lord Shesha wanted to see the divine dance of Lord Nataraja and hence himself descended as the Patanjali as the son of one Gonika of Gonardadesha. He made a penace for the Shiva who directed him to go to Chidambaram where he will dance. Then he went to that place and saw the dance and wrote Mahabhashyam of Panini’s sutras. Then he taught the many disciples sitting behind a curtain so that nobody can see him in his Shesha form. But the disciples opened the curtain and were burnt to ashes. But one disciple who went pass the urine survived. He was also cursed to be brahmarakshasa. That disciple became brahmarakshasa by the curse of patanjali. And according to patanjali’s words he was looking for a man who will tell correct form of root pac in the nishtha, to teach the mahabhashya. Then there came Chandragupta who gave the right answer and studied the mahabhashya from Brahmarakshasa. Then Chandragupta’s son Bhartrhari wrote vakyapadiya. Chandragupta later became a sanyasin and disciple of Gaudapada.
