Dear List members,

  

I vaguely remember to have seen a copy of

*Patan"jali-caritam* of Ramabhadra Dikshita

published by Vani Vilas Press, Srirangam.

  

I do not know whether I am mistaken are not.

Can anybody furnish the details

if it was indeed published by them ?

(I am not speaking of the Nirnayasagara edition).

  

Thanks in advance

KSKannan
