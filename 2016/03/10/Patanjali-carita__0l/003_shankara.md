Namaste,

  

As per the footnote given to Krishnamacharya's HCSL para 160, Patanjali Charitam was published from Bombay and Madras. Unfortunately, the publication details are not provided in the book. Madras publisher could be Balamanorama Press or some other Madras publisher. If it were Sri Vani Vilas, Krishnamacharya would have mentioned it so.
