Friends,

This may be a bit diversion, but I thought to share.

People come abroad without knowing that they may eventually settle.

Immigration to the US is very recent. I came thrown away by the

political instability in the '70s, Students come to get education in order

to support parents and families. Swami Sarvagatananda in Ramakrishna

Mission came to realize this when he showed up as an Assistant monk

in Boston in 1954. He became a default guardian to hundreds of students

of Indian origin who came to Boston to study. I associated with him and

miss him. BVP is helping me to fill the void that he left with. Here is a

website I created in his memory last week. You may visit

Thank you for letting me share.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
