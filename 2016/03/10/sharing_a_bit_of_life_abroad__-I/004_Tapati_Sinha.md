This is an wonderful website showcasing Swamilji. What an excellent way to spread the lessons of India for the western world, deprived of the wealth India holds.

I follow Vivakananda in my personal life and Geeta is my most favorite book which I don't miss a single day.

Thank you very much for the website. I would love to read the books when I get it.

Regards.
