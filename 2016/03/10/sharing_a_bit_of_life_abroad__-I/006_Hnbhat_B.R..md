It is not universal. They are used in certain words and there is no such rule in grammar, but lexicographers like Purushottama, collect such words that have two alternative usage of letters such as श, ष, स, व, ब, ल, ळ, due to Prakrit influence in spoken language and not in Vedic Language. In classical literature, such used words are listed in द्विरूपकोश lexicons.

  

There is no such grammar rule.
