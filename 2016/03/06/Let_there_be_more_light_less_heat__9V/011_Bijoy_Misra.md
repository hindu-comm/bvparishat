Dear Dr Iyengar,

Through centuries of experimentation, India discovered the wholesomeness of life.

Most findings have been observational, but they have merit because of the practice.

The present day task is to rediscover the results analytically. The assumption is

that something "true" must have an explanation. Many of the findings are related

to the way the mind functions. Hopefully Indian scholars and researchers would

dig literature and understand the role of mind. Yoga talks about silencing the mind.

What happens if I have to function with the mind? Gita says to focus on the task.

Where does bias kick in while supposedly focusing? Then the problem comes in

putting trust on "dressed up" objects. People borrow costume and not the art,.

Best regards,

Bijoy
