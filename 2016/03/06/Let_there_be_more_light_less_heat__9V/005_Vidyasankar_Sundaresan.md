Dear Prof. Iyengar,

  

You had written, "I do not know the Murthys personally, but I guess, originating from Mysore region as I am, they love Sanskrit and have done diligent SWOT of academic scholarship in present day India."

  

As I dig deeper to find more about the people involved and the projects they champion, I find that this is an over-optimistic assessment.

  

Please see this Indian news item from Jan 2015, i.e. more than a year ago now. -<http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/lFimgXZsUzD2jccaCD4VhI/The-modern-revivalists.html>

  

Also see his response in March 2016 to the petition that we've all been talking about. - <http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/rohan-murty-responds-to-online-petition-to-oust-american-indologist-sheldon-pollock/articleshow/51287690.cms>

  

I think it is quite fair to say that, as with most urban, English educated young people in India today, Mr. Murty was not only quite unaware in 2015, he is also quite unaware of the credentials of scholars in India, as of last week. It seems to me that there is a vast gulf separating Indian votaries of the Goddess Saraswati from those whom the Goddess Lakshmi has favored in recent times!

  

I think it is very pertinent to ask whether this gulf is unbridgeable or whether it should remain unbridgeable. If the recent book by Mr. Malhotra and the current petition about MCLI provoke such difficult conversations in India and lead to some constructive ways forward, then it would all be worth it.

  

Best regards,

Vidyasankar
