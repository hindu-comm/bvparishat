HariH OM!

  

Namaste Mahodaya,

  

"About Lakshmi favouring more than Sarasvati, is it not what is to be expected. May I point out that Lakshmi is enjoined to be worshipped every Friday (i.e. 52 days in a year), whereas only one day is prescribed for Sarasvati. Some food for thought!"

  

In a lighter vein, may I counter this that one day of worship with Śraddhā is adequate to please Śarasvati, the Goddess of Vidyā, whereas 52 days are required to please Lakṣmi, Goddess of wealth! Greater the effort, stronger is her munificence! Put in a different way, when Śarasvati is propitiated properly even once a year, she stays with the devotee life long whereas Lakṣmi is hard to be pleased and never guarantees life long magnanimity!

  

Dhanyavāadaḥ
