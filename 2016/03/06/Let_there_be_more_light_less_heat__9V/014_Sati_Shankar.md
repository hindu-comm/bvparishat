Vidvadjan,

I have certain reservations in whole of such discussions, some time i asked my professor friends in academia, but state of matter is quite painful.

I would like to put two or three points just as indicator....

After counting for such and such inheritance of Sanskrit and enormous iterature alongwith claims of being "culturally native" thousands of academics came and retired with accolades but we do not have our culturally correct dictionary of Sanskrit and usually refer to St Petersburg or Monier Willliams....

  

We still keep reprinting refering Grifiths for RigVeda,

Though we clarify while discuss that Darshana id literally NOT Relegion but keep putting title of book of such and such Indian Philosophy....

We begin from Nasadiya with claim emergence of cosmos from Hiranyagarbh but fail to define unity of six darshanas.....

  

and list goes on...

No matter we name it Western Indology or Indian Indology or let it be pure Bharatiya with pride... all what matters how can we do justice with our own texts....

  

These are some points on my own dissatisfaction that I have enumerated here and never to hurt anybody.

Regards

Sati Shanakar
