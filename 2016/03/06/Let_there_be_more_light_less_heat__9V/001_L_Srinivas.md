Sri Iyengar makes several telling points.  
  
At this juncture, one would like to speculate if there's any field of intellectual endeavor left in India at all which adheres to its traditional lines of transmission, however tenuous. At first blush, it seems like there are none. But then if you sit back and take a calmer look, we find there are a few. Very few but they are there still.  
  
Take, for example, the field of classical music. It's swamped by modern cinema music and other forms of music, but it continues to exist. In the case of carnatic music, despite superficial modernity like the introduction of western instruments, shorter concerts and dissemination of content, the *rasa* of carnatic music continues to be very Indian. The way musicians, rasikas and musicologists (i.e., the shastris) articulate what's good music is still very Indian. From what little I know of Hindustani music, the same may be held true, unless I am much mistaken.  
  
Perhaps some inspiration may be drawn from this field. In Carnatic music, the patronage model has certainly changed in the last 120 years or so whereby the earlier small number of mainly rural deep pocket donors has changed to a large number of mainly urban ordinary middle class patrons. NRIs are increasingly a force in teaching and disseminating carnatic music though the *karmabhumi* of a musician continues to be India.  
  
This is just a small example to continue on a positive note, as urged by Sri Iyengar.
