Dear Sri Vidyasankar,

When we write about ‘a third party’ in the cyber space, our mutual perceptions will be coloured by what material we have been exposed to. I wrote about ‘Murthys’ and not just about the junior, to whom your links refer. After reading the Livemint and the other link, my impression about the tri-murthy has not changed. Smt. Murthy is a well known literary figure in Kannada writing. The Sr.Murthy always refers to ‘intellectual contributions’ and did not hesitate to say openly on the face of IISc that Indian institutions have not delivered what was expected of them

Whatever may be the other weaknesses (which I do not know) of N. Murthy , he comes out as a principled person, having faced considerable opposition from the present day politicians of Karnataka. I recollect how he was dragged to court alleging that he disrespected the national anthem. Before that he was made to resign from the Chairmanship of the Bangalore airport project for questioning vested interests. In no other city a toll road is permitted without a service road connecting the airport, making public pay every time they pass thro’ the road. Let me not digress, lest the moderator flags me.

All said and done, your point is well taken. There should be efforts to bridge the gap, indeed *the gulf* as you mention. My remark is just one bridge will not be sufficient; several are required. I mean all such efforts and translations will be useful, catering to different tastes, age groups and purchasing power.

About Lakshmi favouring more than Sarasvati, is it not what is to be expected. May I point out that Lakshmi is enjoined to be worshipped every Friday (i.e. 52 days in a year), whereas only one day is prescribed for Sarasvati. Some food for thought!

  

I rest here.

  

regards

RNI
