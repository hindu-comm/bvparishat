Speaking of musicology, dramaturgy etc, there was always a lot of traditional scholarly output in non-Sanskrit languages, especially in the south.From the commentary by aTiyArkkunallAr on the cilappatikaramto the 19th cent. Abraham Panditar's karuNamiruta sAkaram, there is a tremendous amount of source material available in Tamil.

  

In the 20th century however, we all seem to have shifted to a predominant usage of English instead. Even as eminent a Sanskrit scholar as Dr V. Raghavan, when he wrote independently on Carnatic music, used mostly the English language. And from the north, musicologists like K C D Brihaspati and Prem Lata Sharma have again published mostly in English, to my knowledge, not in Hindi or Sanskrit. A number of PhD degrees in music / fine arts have been awarded by Indian universities over the last five decades or more. All the dissertations, ranging across the spectrum in the quality of their content and production, are written in English. Our recent history as subjects of the East India Company and the British Crown has changed us in irrevocable ways!
