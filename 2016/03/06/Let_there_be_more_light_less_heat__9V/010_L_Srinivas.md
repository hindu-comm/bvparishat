Perhaps, pursuit of knowledge in the traditional manner should be more important than whether it was carried out in Sanskrit. For your info, Muthuswamy Dikshitar's compositions, among others, was used as the lakshya based on which a seminal lakshana grantha called 'sangita sampradaya pradarshani' was written by the late Subbarama Dikshitar and was issued in 1905 in Telugu characters. It was subsequently re-issued in Tamil characters. This serves as a main source book for raga lakshanas of many ragas in the post Venkatamakhin period.  
  
Even today, shastraic pursuit of carnatic music continues in the traditional manner. It's simply not done in Sanskrit.  
  
Likewise where would you place Pt Bhatkhande's labors in the musicology of Hindustani music? It might interest you to know that Pt Bhatkhande actually visited Subbarama Dikshitar in his native village in Ettayapuram in southern Tamilnadu. Like Subbarama Dikshitar writing in Telugu, Pt Bhatkhande wrote Marathi commentaries to his Sanskrit works.  
  
The scholastic tradition in the traditional Indian manner in the field of music is admittedly weakened but it still exists. Other traditions can take heart from this tradition. It's not like such loss of traditions (or subsequent revival) were not there in traditional India either.  

  
Thanks and Regards,
