Dear Sir,

  

Your citation of Coomaraswamy is apt. But even more important is his criticism, even of the professional scholars, especially of the Occident, who were under the illusion that their mastery of philology would very well suffice for the interpretation of our scriptural literature.

  

There is undoubtedly a greater need of the counterparts of the *popularisers* of science in the realm of our own literature, vast and deep as it is.
