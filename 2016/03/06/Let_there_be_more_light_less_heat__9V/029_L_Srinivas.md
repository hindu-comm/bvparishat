The great Dr V Raghavan's substantive field of experise was alamkara sastra. He did write a considerable amount on music incl the sanskrit kavya on Dikshitar and many articles besides. It's true a lot of it was in English. But music is his field of subsidiary expertise. In the field of music, he is said to have taken a great deal of guidance from the late Paramacharya of Kanchi who certainly did not think or write in English.  
  
On balance, it is unclear to me if one can say that there was no intellectual acivity in music in India in the traditional manner. You have mentioned yourself in one of your earlier posts re Abraham Pandithar etc.  
  
Yes, we have been changed in (seemingly) irrevocable ways. But perhaps we can make an effort now. The great Aurobindo, I'm told, was not allowed to speak Bengali during his formative years. What a transformation he underwent! Gandhi always could write in Indian languages and did so but Nehru never did. Rajaji wrote so many seminal articles, at least one great song and a couple beautiful translations of sanskrit epics in Tamil despite failing miserably in his intermediate examinations in Tamil which almost jeopadized his law college admission. Somebody mentioned R Sathyanarayana of Mysore. I know that he writes mostly in Kannada. I know at least of one blog where his views are discussed in Kannada. This blogger actually lives in the US. his blog has got a tagline even "alliruvudu namma mane, illiruvudu summane' - our home's over there, this one here's just like that :)  
  
Hope this helps,
