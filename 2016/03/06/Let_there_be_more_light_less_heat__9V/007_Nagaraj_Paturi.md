AadaraNIya Vidyasankarji,

  

The livemint link is a timely eyeopener.

  

Bridging the gulf should be done sooner than later.

  

Aayushmaan Rohan is only a sample.

  

The information that he mentions he missed while studying in India should be made to reach such youngsters.

  

At the same time, information about the availability of both traditional Panditas and the ambidextrous geniuses such as Prof. Aklujkar, Prof. Kannan etc. should also be made to reach the general Indian public, particularly youngsters, to avoid situations like that of Aayushmaan Rohan.

  

It may be a good idea to publish the intro to ancient Indian knowledge as a book and provide the directory of Indian scholar-resources as an annexure to it.

  

Regards,

  

Nagaraj
