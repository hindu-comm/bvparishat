Sir,

my referring to MW or Grifiths was just to indicate that we have not produced an Indian translation meant for modern reader no matter if belonging to indology or a general reader..who is curious enough to know what there is in the intended Indian text.

  

वाचस्पत्य-शब्दकल्पद्रुमौ and सायणभाष्यं etc all are there but how many can follow? My query has been exactly in the sense what Ananda Coomaraswamy has observed:

"On the one hand, the professional scholar, who has direct access to the sources, function in isolation; on the other, the amateur propagandist of Indian thought disseminates mistaken notions. Between the two, no provision is made for the educated man of good will.”.

Hope this clarifies the state..

Thanks & regards

Sati Shankar
