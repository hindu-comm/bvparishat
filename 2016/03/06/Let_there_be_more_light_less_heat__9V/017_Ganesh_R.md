Dr. R. SatyanaaraayaNa, great musicologist (also danceologist) and a well known srividyOpaasaka has written extensively in Kannada apart from his equally impressive English writings. He has also translated most of the lakShaMa-gramtha-s into Kannada. Sri. PONangi Appaarao from Andhra has translated naaTyashaastra into Telugu and I feel that it is one of the best in such genere. Such endeavours of translating alamkaara/naaTyashaastra works in to Kannada and Telugu is done by several scholars and most worthy among them are K. Krishnamoorthy and pillela sriramachandrudu.
