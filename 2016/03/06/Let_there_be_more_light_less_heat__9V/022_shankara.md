Namaste,

  

The works of MW and Griffith are in the open domain and are easily available on the internet. That is a reason for their popularity. There are several English translations of Rigveda and the other Vedas by Indian scholars like Satyaprakash Sarasvati, Satyakama Vidyalankar, RL Kashyap, et al.  



regards  
shankara
