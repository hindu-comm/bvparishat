Dear Prof. Iyengar,

Thank you for the well-articulated analysis. The world is different now that what the traditionalists might visualize. The British did succeed

in introducing English in a large way as the medium of instruction and communication. Sentence construction in Indian languages and

English is very different. This is where analytic understanding of the intent of the composer is a requirement. Rabindranath translated

his own poems to win a Nobel prize. My strong view is that the native scholars must immediately prepare themselves for the task.

It a required task to educate the youth. The whole arbitrary dictionary based translations attempted by Prof Pollock and his associates

must be protested. By reading Prof Pollock's essays he comes out as a political commentator than a scholar educator.  We as

immigrants feel extremely distressed by this filthy ditch that we did not anticipate. We need help from our brothers and sisters in

the home country to help educate our children. 

The "NRI" phrase in the note prompted me to write. I am trying my part here. We need a conflagration in waking up!

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
