Thanks for taking up my post to make a further valid point on the classical music tradition. I fully agree with you this tradition (in its intuitive, and performance aspect) is well preserved, enjoyed and appreciated widely. I was referring in my previous post mainly to the “intellectual aspects of traditional Sanskrit scholarship". Seen from this angle, scholarly works on Theory of Music written in Sanskrit seems to have slowed with the generation of Venkatamakhin to gradually stop during the period of Muthuswami Dikshitar (1775-1835) and his brother. Please add names if any in the 19th Cent who wrote on Rāga Music in Sanskrit. Our tradition praises to the sky both *sangīta* and *sāhitya*. The two are parallel traditions for Rasānubhava. Kāvya tradition has had the theoretical or analytical support of large number of elementary to advanced level texts on Chhandas, Alamkāra, Dhvani, Rasa, and of course Grammar. Rāga-music evolved out of the oral tradition of Sāmagāna and till recently music knowledge was transmitted orally. The tradition has held on its own. Think of it; it is a transient aural experience, supposed to lead one eventually to Nāda-brahman. But, we should not forget that this also has its theoretical basis in the texts of Bharata, Matanga, Sarngadeva and further commentaries. It is amazing how Bharata and others analyse swaras; 7 or 13 or 22. It is humbling to know 2000 years ago the first experiment on vibration of strings was carried out to understand that an Octave is defined by doubling a given frequency, which is called *dviguṇībhāva* in our texts. They did not know 'frequency' as we know them today. Nevertheless the characterization was perfect, because they discovered by careful hearing that two strings in the ratio of 1:2 length produce the same Svara!
