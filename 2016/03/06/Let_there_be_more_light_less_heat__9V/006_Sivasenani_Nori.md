It is humbling to know 2000 years ago the first experiment on vibration of strings was carried out to understand that an Octave is defined by doubling a given frequency, which is called dviguṇībhāva in our texts. They did not know 'frequency' as we know them today. Nevertheless the characterization was perfect, because they discovered by careful hearing that two strings in the ratio of 1:2 length produce the same Svara!

Sir,

Actually, about (at least) 2,000 years ago Indians had a fairly full understanding of sound. In the tarkapAda of Purvamimamsa, in the context of Sabdanityatva, the question arises as to how sound is propagated and SabarasvAmin gives a remarkably modern description (say, as against Aristotle's description): it progresses through a series of contractions and rarefactions (expansions) of the particles in a medium. I will post the exact text juxtaposed with a modern textbook of physics later in the day.
