"Discovery" and "sensitivity" to India happens when one is abroad. Some young people get

uprooted from the appreciation of the heritage right at home. False ado and vanity also come in.

I see these more lately. India is manufacturing these uprooted people at a rapid rate!

I think that English medium education and lack of good books in English might have a lot

to do with it. Very bright boys and girls do not get swayed! It takes some mental faculty

to appreciate India's rhythm. .it must begin at home.
