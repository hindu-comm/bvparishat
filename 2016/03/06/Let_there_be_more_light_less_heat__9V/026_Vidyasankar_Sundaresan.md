Dear Prof. Iyengar,  

  

Your points are very valid and I'm much younger in age, experience and knowledge than you, so kindly bear with my articulation of what I feel is happening. I usually do not like to discuss people, preferring to talk of thoughts and ideas, but in this instance, my hand is forced.

  

The deeds of the senior Murthy and the lady Murthy are indeed very admirable. Personally, I have found nothing wrong with him asking what IISc and the IITs have delivered. Such uncomfortable questions need to be asked and addressed honestly in our land and I am actually glad that someone of his stature is asking them.  
  
Yet, it seems to me that the statements by the younger Murty, as reported in recent news items, are not quite appropriate. He could have differed with the content and the reasons behind the petition addressed to him and his father, without using such terms as peanut gallery, throwing shells, etc and without blindly disparaging the people who have put their names behind it. Reading these comments revealed, at least to my eyes, a lot of hubris, perhaps driven by the influence of the yaksha kubera, if not the devI lakshmI.

  

Besides, the report from a year ago showed that with all the family background he may have had, he still says he discovered the Indian intellectual heritage, completely anew, at graduate school in the United States. Unfortunately, that is fairly typical for the young, urban, English educated Indian today, and having been a graduate student in the USA myself in the past, I can well empathize with his situation. However, even accounting for the exuberance of youth, I see many other people of the same generation, for whom a similar discovery results in a vastly different attitude towards the people who are the current leading transmitters of that intellectual heritage.

  

vidyA dadAti vinayam iti cet, saiva vidyA yA vinayaM dadAti, na vA?

  

Best regards,

Vidyasankar
