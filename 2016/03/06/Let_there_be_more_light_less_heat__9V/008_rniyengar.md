Dear Dr.Bijoy ji,

Thanks for your comments. I fully agree with you on the necessity to correctly reflect the purpose and intent of the composer in the translations.

Please don't mistake me for the phrase "NRI" in my post. I know about your Discovery of India project and the extraordinary efforts that should be going on with it.

The important thing amongst interested parties is to have a purposeful dialogue and carry along as many persons as possible, to work on projects to preserve and continue our intellectual and cultural traditions.

Once a critical mass is reached perhaps there will be more heat but we can expect also some light.  

with regards

  

RN Iyengar
