The first element (00) of a matrix (क / अ / ह), as well as the final (44) element (ञ / इ / य), is of special interest because it is the farthest location of this universe.  
  
00 is seen as the entry point, and 44 as the exit point. Let us consider 00, first.  
  
00 can be seen either as a द्वार or as a बाधा. Without crossing this point there cannot be any hope of any realisation: mere speculation, philosophising, rote learning, following/ opposing someone or something, charging at windmills, so on — can achieve absolutely nothing, and has achieved absolutely nothing as a matter-of-fact.  
  
I talked about tantra in this thread, and in doing so pushed under the rug some hidden assumptions in the पूर्वपक्ष. However, this should not have to mean that tantra is an absolute must to gaining deepest insights into anything Indic (or, simply, anything).  
  
Because only 00, as discussed, is the absolute necessity. What does this statement mean?  
  
As I said earlier, each of the entries in L, R, or C matrix belongs to certain देवता. So who is the देवता behind 00?  
  
क - कार्तिक  
  
अ - अश्विन्  
  
ह - हनुमान  
  
All three of them are also known as कुमार ("child").  
  
So कुमार is the 00-देवता, "the first among all देवता". The क / ह / अ वर्ण assumes all the meanings as the qualities of कुमार.  
  
Without the भक्ति of this देवता (who also is the Lord of Discrimination, Effort, and Venture) - irrespective of the sect or दर्शन involved - there can be no hope of any real knowledge. With the भक्ति of कुमार, on the other hand, no other means (tantra etc) are fundamentally required.  
  
What is भक्ति, and what is देवता?  
  
भक्ति is the division of one's चेतना offered to a देवता. A देवता is a "homomorphic" set that keeps appearing as a certain division in any set (including itself).  
  
I hope this concludes the उत्तरपक्ष of the subject matter, where we saw - even as from only one example (क/ ह/ अ) - how a वर्ण, acting from the deepest देवता layers, can indeed in theory influence meanings about the words and beyond.  
  
  
  
  
Thank you,
