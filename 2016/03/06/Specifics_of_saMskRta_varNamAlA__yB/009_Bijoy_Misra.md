Dear Satishji,

Please do get into the points you mentioned. Take a small part

and work on it. Totally remove any thoughts of "may be". We

have a huge part of empiricism in Indian culture. But they have

to be understood through scientific rigor. We have to analyze

as far as we can go in the brain. The western linguistics is much

less developed because of its stress on the evolved sound. We

have to discover how natural the syllables are. I can include you

with a short group of people here if you would have time to study

and research. We are working on the prosodic variation in speech

as our next project. Please send me a copy of any paper or

original material on any topic that you might have written.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
