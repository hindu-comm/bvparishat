I concede that पवर्ग are easier than कवर्ग. There is ample experimental support for it.

  

However, during the early babbling period (typically 0-5 months) babies make what is called "coo-ing" and "goo-ing" sounds. This includes अ, ह sounds apart from क, ग sounds.

  

So I should correct myself here by saying that कवर्ग precedes पवर्ग solely in timeline, and corresponds to a period when no formal words are even learned. So कवर्ग precedes पवर्ग bcause it comes "inbuilt" with the baby. Even an incidental cough can produce aख sound.

  

Even so, these observations are statistical in nature. After allowingfor all these facts, the वर्गtable (in my last post)stillremains thesame.
