Namaste Shri Kalicharanji,  
  
I have no intention to divert rather disturb such an interesting thread and bring down the level of knowledge richness it has reached by asking such a baby question. My apologies if it spoils the author's or any of the reader's interest. As there was a reference of baby, I got this question what would be the best thing a parent could do so that their infant would learn Sanskrit better? Obviously, the question is for my nine month young daughter.  
  
From my day to day experience about babies' learning process, I believe that babies could learn almost any language if he/she is communicated for his/her day to day activities. Unfortunately, I am not privileged to provide such an exposure of spoken Sanskrit at home. With my little knowledge what we are doing as of now is just playing audio of some Sanskrit recitations such as Bhagavad Gita, Bhahma Samhita, Vishnu Sahstranama, etc. in the morning.  
  
I would like to make it clear that my expectations are not to make her a Sanskrit Scholar. This definitely does not mean that we don't want it to happen! Any career oriented skill imparting efforts is too early at this time and we are definitely not doing it with that expectation. All I expect is to provide her a good enough base from the beginning so that when time comes and if she decides, Sanskrit would not look a foreign language to her.  
  
Please take you time to respond as per your convenience, we are not running out of time as far as her language learning is concerned.  
  
Thanks and Regards,  
Sunil
