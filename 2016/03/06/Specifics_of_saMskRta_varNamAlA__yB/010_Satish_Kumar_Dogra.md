Bijoy Ji,  

 I shall be glad to join any of your research groups.  
  

Let me tell you about my background. I was born and brought up in Punjab, although the origins of my family are from J&K. After completing my education. I taught English Literature and Linguistics in Guru Nanak Dev University Amritsar for nearly 5 years. In 1982, I got selected in the IPS and was allotted Tamil Nadu cadre where I retired in December 2013 as a DGP. After retirement, I have turned again to academics.  
  

My interest in Yog Sutras started when I was a college student. I believe Yog Sutras is the greatest book ever written. If one could understand it entirely, one could get answers to all questions about what is often called The Human Condition.  
  

Starting from the beginning of this year, I have begun deepening my knowledge of Sanskrit and hope to soon start communicating completely in Sanskrit.  
  

During my days of service I learnt Tamil and began to write in Tamil. I published a poetic play in Tamil and serialised three novels in Tamil magazines. Apart from this I wrote a number of articles in magazines and newspapers.  
  

I also compose music and, once I learn enough Sanskrit, I plan to bring out disks of my Sanskrit songs. Let me give a link to two of my songs: These songs are recorded in my own home studio.

This background about me would give you an idea of where I can fit.  
  

Regards,  

Dogra, Chennai.
