The same framework, for swara-s, produce this diagonal L-matrix:

  

0 0 0 0 इ

0 0 0 ऋ 0

0 0 ऌ 0 0

0 उ 0 0 0

अ 0 0 0 0

  

The inclusion of rarely used ऌ shows that the essential framework (over and above just utility) was more important to the RShis, who made it a point to produce a diagonal, ऌ, at its proper position.

  

Now, we know these diagonal elements are the base ("zero-grade") vowels. We have also seen how in the R-matrix the first column (क - काका, प - पिता, त - ताऊ, च - चाचा) had a better producibility. This shows up in an expanded L-matrix:

  

ए 0 0 0 इ

अर् 0 0 ऋ 0

अल् 0 ऌ 0 0

ओ उ 0 0 0

अ 0 0 0 0

  

We also have a C-matrix ("Center") which is to L and R what शुषुम्णा is to इळा and पिंङ्गला.

  

0 0 0 0 य

0 0 0 र 0

0 0 ल 0 0

0 व 0 0 0

ह 0 0 0 0

  

So the C-matrix also comes out as a diagonal matrix, further validating the system discussed thus far.

  

Though as before, there is an expansion of C-matrix:

  

श 0 0 0 य

ष 0 0 र 0

स 0 ल 0 0

0 व 0 0 0

ह 0 0 0 0

  

इ-य-ञ, ऋ-र-ढ, ऌ-ल-द, उ-व-फ, अ-ह-क are the L-C-R equivalences along the diagonal.

  

Clearly, there are many vacancies available in L and C matrix. Sanskrit was clearly aware of many such phonemes from hundreds of surrounding Prakrits. This probably included various visarga-s and anunAsika-s, apart from weird sounding swara-s.

  

Sanskrithas made use of some of such phonemes at different points of time. As an example, consider this hypothetical positioning of ळ and ॺ

  

0 0 ॺ 0 य

0 0 ळ र 0

0 0 ल 0 0

0 व 0 0 0

ह 0 0 0 0

  

This concludes the पूर्वपक्ष.

To this end, we relied on inner consistency and a Vaidika framework.
