Satish ji,

  

Before we move ahead, let us know more about the characteristics of the R-matrix.

  

04r 14r 24r 34r 44r

03r 13r 23r 33r 43r

02r 12r 22r 32r 42r

01r 11r 21r 31r 41r

00r 10r 20r 30r 40r

  

The diagonal elements, under the index notation, are:

00r-11r-22r-33r-44r

  

All other elements have mixed indices (12, 40, etc). What does this mean?

  

This means that likely, all other elements come from some kind of mixing between the diagonal elements.

  

For example,

  

00r + 11r => 10r

11r + 00r => 01r

  

..and so on.

  

I must assert here that this theory is scientifically reproducible. So let us rather dwell a bit more on the देवता aspect.

  

Nature works on a "min-max" program. That is, to achieve an objective she does the very minimum, and not more. "Minimum effort for maximum result".

  

If the effort is : "developing the faculty of वाक्", then nature has to summon the "purities" of द्यो. Five द्युदेवता.

  

I am sorry if this sounds unfamiliar. There was a rather superficial discussion on पञ्चपवमानी earlier on. I discussed about five क्षेत्राणि पञ्चद्यो: ("द्यु०, द्यु१, द्यु२, द्यु३, द्यु४") in my incomplete thread "the first fundamental law..".

  

There are five पाण्डवा:, and I can go on and on. This belongs to the basics of Indian thought. Everything else follows. (What have we been upto?)

  

To conclude, this 5x5 matrix has a deep basis, and isn't just random. Those well versed in tantra, I suppose, will already be smiling.
