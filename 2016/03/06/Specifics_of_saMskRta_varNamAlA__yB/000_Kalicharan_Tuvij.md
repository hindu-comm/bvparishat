नमस्ते ।  
  
This thread is created as a place-holder for insights and open collaboration on Sanskrit वर्णमाला. There has been a precedent for this in "वर्णवाद" (by shri N.R. Joshi) on BVP earlier.  
  
This 'tradition' in my view is a bottom-up approach towards understanding/ exploiting the laws (धर्म / natural principle) of Sanskrit. No doubt this approach is better than a top-down one (e.g. my earlier incomplete thread, "the-first-fundamental-law-of-Sanskrit").  
  
What is the outline of discussion? Nothing in particular, and I request erudite members to share their insights for course guidance and correction.  
  
Just to emphasise the non-triviality of the topic, let me start with this "teaser":  
  
Why does this basic "family vocabulary" (प्राकृत) comes from पवर्ग only?  
प, पिता  
फ, -  
ब, बहिन  
भ, भाई  
म, माता  
  
P.S.: Except for considering the ऋत route ("connection among all things"), I start here with pretty much a blank state.
