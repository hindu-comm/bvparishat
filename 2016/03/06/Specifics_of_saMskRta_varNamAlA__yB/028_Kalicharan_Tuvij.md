Please remember that I am not a वैयाकरण and onlyhave stakes in Sanskrit arising from a वैदिक standpoint (which is incidentallymy research focus). So yes I do have complaint against yourquestion:it istoo difficult!

Devotional songs in praise of Vishnu are alwaysa goodoption for Sanskrit acclimation. Vishnu creates a "Satayugicbubble" for adevotee, and for now Sanskrit needs this bubble. Purely my opinion, but this is because Sanskritists haven't been able to sort out human understanding of Sanskrit fully.

Parents' expectations for their children are, to put it this way: to let them grow to beinherently intelligent like the Russians, and outwardly venturous as the Americans. Incidentally, Russian is an inflected, "tough to learn", IndoEurpean language (like Sanskrit is).

  

So for now, Sanskrit's scope should be the targeting of"the inherent intelligence". Or,"The bubble of Vishnu".

  

To give another analogy, in Software engineering, LISP is an exceptionally elegantlanguage everybody keeps praising about- often toutingas arevolution justaround the corner-yet when it comes to real production level the same set of people use Java.  

  

Sanskrit is likeLISP in this example. "Production level"could be English. But when Isay Sanskrit, Imean Sanskrit integrated with native languages. It is important, therefore, to rediscover how Sanskrit word roots are generated. Another good example of this framework is the Sanskrit वर्णमाला that is alreadyin use with most of the native languages. Sanskrit's innermost two layers: the देवता

layer, and the inflection layer are central to it; whereas, the outermost two layers, words and sounds can certainlyadmit of far greater freedom.

  

So as we see, remaining in touch with देवता भक्ति (via Sanskrit) is the same as remaining in touch with the soul of Sanskrit. For a girl child, in particular, a proficiency in theभक्ति of sister Devi-s उषा and संध्या (for instance in the form of daily उषा-संध्या rites) is still the best gift theparents can give her. Remember, the two Devi-s are sisters (the feminine equivalence, in fact)to अश्विनीकुमार -spoken so gloriously of in this thread.

  

Another देवता of interest is the इष्टदेवता of the child as indicated in her chart. This should be simple enough to find (another matter that practically isn't so), even with theloss of a good fraction ofresolution in ज्योतिष-शास्त्र.

  

One can undertakeVeda/ Vyakaranaअन्वेषणfruitfully later ifan intuitive relationship with Devata-s, and hence withSanskrit words, goesall the way back to one'schildhood.
