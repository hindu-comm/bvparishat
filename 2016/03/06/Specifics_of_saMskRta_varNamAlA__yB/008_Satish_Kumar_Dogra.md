Bijoy Ji,  

 Your excellent paper identifies different stages --- one stage where comprehension is at the level of concepts, devoid of words, and another when the words give a more concrete and language-specific shape to the comprehension process. Your reference to the study where the words for hut from two different languages stimulated the same part of the brain in fMRI, indicate that there is a higher-level language based on concepts that is common to all languages.  
  

This pre-verbalisation stage of thought is central to Maharishi Patanjali's Yog Sutras. When the Maharishi says in the 3rd Sutra of Vibhuti Paad, अर्थ मात्र निर्भासं वस्तु शून्यः I think he is referring to this stage when the idea exists in its pre-verbalisation stage.  
  

One step further, since these pre-verbalisation ideas arise from previous memories, they connect back to our past experiences. And since in our Hindu system of beliefs the past experiences go back to previous births, so those ideas which arise from our memories of previous births are called संस्काराः At that stage of meditation when our memories of the present life become quiet, the pre-verbalisation ideas arise from the memories of the previous births. This is what the Maharishi describes in the 10 Sutra as तस्य प्रशान्तवाहिता संस्कारात् and in the 18th Sutra he says, संस्कारसाक्षातकरणात् पूर्वजाति ज्ञानम्.  
  

Deeper studies into the neurology of these pre-verbalisation ideas and their origin can perhaps scientifically validate the meaning of these sutras and also provide us a scientific method of connecting to our previous births through our brains.
