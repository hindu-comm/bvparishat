Yes,I should have used standard usage,सुषुम्णा instead of प्रचलित Prakrit words such asशुषुम्णा /शुशुम्ना / सुषुम्ना etc. One example of Prakrit's usage is shown in verse 3 of "साधन - मुक्तावलि"<http://www.transliteral.org/pages/z141126011216/view>

  

सुषुम्ना / सुषुम्णा /शुषुम्णा /शुषुम्णा/शुशुम्नाis the central "nerve", and is manifest in a system underexceptionalcircumstances.

  

The C-matrix is exceptional because it has thecharacteristics of both L and R matrix: the "flow" of L, and the robustness of R.
