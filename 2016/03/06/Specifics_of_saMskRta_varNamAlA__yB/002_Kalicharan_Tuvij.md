प्रणाम Satish-ji,

  

Interesting observation. No doubt पवर्ग is relatively easy to pronounce. However, the easiest वर्ग in my view would bethe कवर्ग, since a young child is already endowed with the other कण्ठ्य वर्णा: - अ and ह.

Here is a table showing all वर्ग rows in a decreasing order (average) of difficulty, top to bottom:

  

च छ ज झ ञ

ट ठ ड ढ ण

त थ द ध न

प फ ब भ म

क ख ग घ ङ

  

The next immediate family names miraculously turn up in the first column of this table:

  

च, चाचा

ट, -

त, ताऊ

प, पिता

क, काका

  

And the plot thickens.
