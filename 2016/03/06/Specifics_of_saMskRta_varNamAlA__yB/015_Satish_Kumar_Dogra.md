Shri Kalicharan,  

 What is achieved through this matrix is not clear. Could you please explain? Also, what is the basis of re-arranging the alphabet from its normal Devanagari arrangement?  
  

The normal universally accepted arrangement of the consonants is such that we start from the back of the oral cavity and move forward. कवर्ग consonants are pronounced by blocking the oral cavity at the back (velar), चवर्ग by blocking the cavity by touching the middle of the tongue (palatal) टवर्ग by blocking at the dental ridge (retroflex), तवर्ग at the back of the top teeth (dental) and पवर्ग by blocking at the lips (labial).  
  

Thus, there is a logical sequence in the arrangement of the consonants. Why your scheme changes that order is not clear.  
  

Regards,  

Dogra, Chennai
