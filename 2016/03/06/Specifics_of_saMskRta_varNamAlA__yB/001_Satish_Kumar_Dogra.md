Shri Kalicharan,  

 The articulation of different sounds involves different degrees of complexity. The simplest of these are the labial plosives, like प, ब, भ and their nasal counterpart. म. For pronouncing these sounds, one has just to open the mouth, so that the two lips come apart. That is why the child first learns to say words like Mama, Papa, Baba etc. These words can be pronounced without the use of the tongue.  
  

At the other end are sounds that require the creation of certain shapes of the vocal cavity by aligning the tongue with the palate. For example, for pronouncing ल one must bring the tip of the tongue behind the dental ridge and withdraw the margins of the tongue so that the air passes through the side, thus making it a 'lateral' sound. त is a dental plosive where we close the air passage by bringing the tip of the tongue behind the teeth and then suddenly releasing the air.  
  

There are some sounds that offer some difficulty in correct pronunciation, such as ऋ or ज्ञ in Sanskrit or  ழ in Tamil.  
  

I would guess that words for close relationships in most languages use labial plosives because these are the easiest to pronounce and the growing infant learns them easily.
