Kalicharan Ji,  

 Are the कवर्ग consonants really easier than the पवर्ग ones?  
  

Just open your mouth and produce a sound. It will sound like अ. Now start producing the sound while your mouth is still closed and then open it. It will sound as प.  
  

For pronouncing क you have to block the mouth cavity by raising the back of the tongue to touch the palate and then release it like other plosives. To us adults it may appear to be simple because we have been producing the sound for years. But the child has to learn how to twist the tongue to bring its back portion to touch the palate.  
  

Interestingly all the sounds you have mentioned being used in the words for relationship are plosives. That is to say, we block the vocal cavity and then release it suddenly. Even the Hindi च used in चाचा is a plosive, unlike its English sound 'ch' used in a word like charm, which is a fricative.  
  

If you listen to an infant, you will find that he would probably start addressing his चाचा as ताता and later learn to pronounce चाचा. This is because the sound च requires curving the middle of the tongue slightly downwards. The child finds it difficult.  
  

Regards,  

Dogra
