Satish ji,

  

The R-matrix makes sense. The bottom two rows: the 00r-40r (कवर्ग) and above it the 01r-41r (पवर्ग) already have made sense during our discussion.

  

One immediate explanation I can think of is that the rows' positions correspond (?)to the height the sound-generating-organs are situated at. In this way, कण्ठ्य कवर्ग are at the bottom and तालव्य चवर्ग are at the top row of the matrix.

  

There are far deeper reasons, however, belonging to the देवता layers, that I hope to show conclusively. Even then, I must clarify here that many of the things being written - and to be written - in this thread are not at allthought outin advance, and are totally shaped by the inputs from contributors. For example, I didn't already know about "coo-ing" and "goo-ing" in babbling, etc.

  

So the next step will be to understand what is the L-matrix corresponding to the R-matrix?

  

The left of deva is devi. Of iLA is piGgala. So the left of R-matrix is the L-matrix:

  

04l 14l 24l 34l 44l

03l 13l 23l 33l 43l

02l 12l 22l 32l 42l

01l  11l 21l  31l 41l

00l 10l 20l 30l 40l

  

The answer is that the L-matrix is a table of स्वर. After filling up the values, it becomes:

  

0 0 0 0 इ

0 0 0 ऋ 0

0 0 ऌ 0 0

0 उ 0 0 0

अ 0 0 0 0

  

I will come up with further explanation (and significance) of this result in my next post (time permitting).
