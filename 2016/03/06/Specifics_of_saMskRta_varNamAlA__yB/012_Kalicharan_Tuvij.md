For brevity, let us represent this varga table:

  

च छ ज झ ञ

ट ठ ड ढ ण

त थ द ध न

प फ ब भ म

क ख ग घ ङ

  

with this "R-matrix":

  

04r 14r 24r 34r 44r

03r 13r 23r 33r 43r

02r 12r 22r 32r 42r

01r  11r 21r  31r 41r

00r 01r 02r 03r 04r

  

So that, for example:

"23r" is same as "ड", 03r is same as घ,and so on.

  

The letter "r" (in the R-matrix) stands for "right". In all Indic systems Reality always resolve into a duality: "left" and "right". For instance, in tantra one has इळा ("left") and पिङ्गल ("right"), etc.

  

In Western systems so far only the material sciences have been able to match this realisation to certain extent, that too quite (relatively) recently. This is a separate study, however.

  

Indeed, Western humanities are neither equipped nor evolved enough to be effective in such endeavour (comparative studies).

  

Coming to Dr. BM's paper (that he was very kind to share), we find a short yet comprehensive review of various linguistic theories, both western and eastern. The fundamental separation between the Semantic and the Lexical comes out as a significant conclusion of the study. This is also shown to be paralleledby the Noun vs. Verb contradistinction. Clearly, a broad foundation has been laid out in the paper.
