When I visited Nepal last year, my father told me a shloka that he heard from my grandfather. Both of them did not get to study Sanskrit, and hence could not remember exact shloka. Since this shloka fascinated me, I am looking for help in tracing the source and/or getting correct shloka

  

I looked up Varaaha Mihir's Samhita, I did find a rain prediction shloka there, but the shloka there is different. This shloka below sounds a lot more beautiful...  

  

खंकाकाण्डा (sky looks the color of crow's eggs) भभोक्षा भ्रमर च शलिलं
(I guess some kind of eddies in water) सेतुबन्धाशच वाला (I guess means kids make mud bridges)

मिनोत्प्लावो हि अापो (I guess fish jumping out of water) लवण च अपकृति (do not feel the taste of salt?) दर्दूराणां रवौति (croaking of frogs?)

क्षामो (lack of appetite) तुष्ट्वा लिखित्त्वा अञ्जननिभगिरयः (can not make sense, a lot of inaccuracies?) वाष्पिडितो अक्षी (watery eyes?)

छौद्रा भौभा पिपिलिण्डा चलनमुपरि (no idea, sounds like it is trying to say ants move about carrying eggs?) शक्क्षत्यम्वोगमाय (all these indicate potential rain)

  

thanks
