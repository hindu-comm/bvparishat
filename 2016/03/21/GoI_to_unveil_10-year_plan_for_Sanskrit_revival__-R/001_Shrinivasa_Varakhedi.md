Thanks.  
  
The "vision document" and "the action plan" submitted to the ministry of HRD has been accepted by the ministry and in turn the ministry has written DO letters to the heads of the institutions, departments and autonomous bodies under MHRD to see the action plans are implemented within the existing policies of the govt and to report to the ministry in case any discrebencies are found in current policies while implementing the action plans for Sanskrit development. With this the commitment of the Govt to the cause is evinced - sources confirmed.  
  
Now it is the responsibility of the local teams of Sanskrit fraternity to take action on the letter by the Govt in order to get the vision translated into reality.  
  
One more very important matter : CBSE has taken a step to promote Sanskrit studies in its schools across the country by authorising local heads of institutions to appoint Sanskrit teachers wherever necessary including 11 and 12 standards. Now this news has to be brought to the notice of local Sanskrit teachers, which will create an employment opportunity for Sanskrit teachers and study opportunity for students. Kinldy inform the concerned.  
  
With best regards  
Shrinivasa Varakhedi
