Press release  

  

  

We are living in the era of information and communication technology (ICT) that provides vision of a global knowledge society, which includes the democratization of knowledge and its access. New initiatives and networks across traditional borders and beyond the classic and old age disciplines of knowledge demonstrate the potential and approaches towards sharing of knowledge and experience with modern technological innovations. Professionals communicate over the Internet, farmers from different corners of the world exchange emails on their achievements and local radio emissions translate scientific Internet information into local and practical language. The promotion of such emerging structures of a global society is at the wake of a global knowledge society, where knowledge contributes to advancement of every citizen.  

  

Twentieth Century witnessed multiple revolutions in communication and Mass Communication technologies, yet ancient precious learning could not obtain the appropriate space in modern mass media as the dominant ‘Mass Culture’ of the Western monopoly capitalism, indiscriminate commercialisation took hold of modern mass media to proliferate its dominant idea and ideology all through the globe. Thus the process of commoditisation and commercialization undermined ancient established streams of knowledge, which could have been otherwise much beneficial for entire world but could not cater the needs of commercialization. Twenty first century has brought some hope to re-establish the magnitude of ancient Indian innovations with the advent of new Information and Communication Technology. Though scattered, yet myriad of efforts are being made to proliferate Sanskrit through New Communication Technology. In the era of ICT and knowledge society it is great responsibility upon us to examine and establish the prudence, and appropriateness of Sanskrit as a practical and comprehensive plateform for new knowledge and new society. These outcomes came from the National Seminar on ‘ICT. KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY AND SANSKRIT’, jointly organized by the Department of Mass Communication and the Department of Sanskrit, Assam University, Silchar on March 11 & 12, 2016 at Bipin Chandra Paul Auditorium inside the university campus.
