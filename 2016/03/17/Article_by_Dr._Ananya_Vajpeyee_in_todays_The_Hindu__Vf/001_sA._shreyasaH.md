Dear Dr. Srinivasa,

  

Namaste.

  

I stopped reading at this point-

"Almost none of the petition’s 132 principal sponsors and backers, or the thousands of signatories, are experts of Sanskrit, other classical languages, literature, history or the humanities, or indeed scholars at all"

  

Such sweeping statements reinforces the ignorance, prejudice and closed-mindset of the author.  

  

IMHO, responding with comments on "The Hindu" website is not going to be of much help -- the moderator there does not even approve

sober comments that are not aligned with their ideology.

  

The other thread on "Conference Series for Purva-paksha on Western Indology"

has brought out a number of good points. 

  

Anyway, this is great motivation for everyoneto dig deeper into the serious study, interpretation,

contemplation, and preservation of traditional Indicknowledge systemsand ensure that it is passed

on early age to the next generation. I am sure you will agree, it all starts at home.

  

Regards,

-Shreyas
