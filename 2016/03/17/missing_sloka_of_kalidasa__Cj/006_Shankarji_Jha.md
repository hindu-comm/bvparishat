Dear Prof. Bhattacharya and others, in the verse, pl check the Chhandas, Vrittam, in the last charana 'tha tham' etc as suggested for improvement. The all three charanas are in Upajaati (or so) Chhandas consisting of 11 letters, in accordance with the relevant rule of guru andlaghu. But the last Charana suggested as correct is in different Chhandas. May be, any rule permits to do so, but to bring the uniformity, the last one should also be in the same structure, as per the reading I have came across 'tham tham thatam tham' etc. Pl. take note. Best regard,

  

Shankarji Jha,  
Professor& Chairperson/Head,
