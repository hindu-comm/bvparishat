Respected Scholars,

  

I want to get the sloka of Kalidasa I don;t remember the lines. The context is :

  

 A pot with water is falling on the steps of the pond and going down.gradually. The sound generated is described in the sloka. Pl get the whole sloka.

  

  

with regards,

  

B.Madhu..
