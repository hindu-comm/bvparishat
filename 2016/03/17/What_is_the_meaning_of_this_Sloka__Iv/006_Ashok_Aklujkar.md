I do not know which work/text (commentary or commentandum) is being talked about.

  

The verse author seems to be saying: “Although this composition (nibandhana) is not totally executed / has not given exhaustive treatment, because (my) proceeding/drive (pravṛtti) and ability sagged in between, it brings about / meets the wish/need of the intelligent ones as it shows a new/different way of understanding word meanings (or words and meanings).”

  

In other words, the author admits that his work has not managed, at all places, to explore everything that could have been explored — that a comprehensiveness of treatment has not been achieved at all points, that the level of his achievement has not been the same throughout. But he is confident that it has made a new/original contribution toward making sense of the commentandum.

  

Here we seem to have a measured and honest expression, applicable to all original scholarly work.
