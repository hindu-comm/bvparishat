Namaste Ashok Mahodaya,

  

Thank you so much for the explanation. It makes complete sense now.

This verse is one among several mentioned in the preface to the Kiratarjuniyam, Trivandrum Sanskrit Series No. 63, available in [archive.org](http://archive.org). I heard that although the commentator has commented on the first 3 cantos of the above work in this book, he wanted to show others how a commentary should be truly written, so he stopped commenting after 3 cantos. This is supposed to be one of the best commentaries on Kiratarjuniyam, being very exhaustive also.

  

May I request a help from you - I have written the meanings of some words in this sloka below. Could you please fill in the ones I could not get:

  

प्रवृत्तिशक्त्योः = of the power of action

अवसादतः = From the exhaustion of

अन्तरा =

भवेत् = may happen

अनिर्व्यूढम् = unaccomplished

इदं = this

तु =

यध्यपि = even though

तथापि = then also

शब्दार्थ = meaning of word

नव = new

अध्वबोधकं =

करोति = does

कामं = desired object

सुधियां = among the learned

निबन्धनम् = commentary

  

Many thanks,

  

Praveen.
