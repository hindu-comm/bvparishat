Dhanyavaadah Mahodaya.

  

I am trying to understand what the author really meant by this. So, we may need to dissect out each word first. Could you kindly translate each word - I have done for some of them:

  

प्रवृत्तिशक्त्योः = of the power of action

अवसादतः = From the exhaustion of

अन्तरा =

भवेत् = may happen

अनिर्व्यूढम् = unaccomplished

इदं = this

तु =

यध्यपि = even though

तथापि = then also

शब्दार्थ = meaning of word

नव = new

अध्वबोधकं =

करोति = does

कामं = desired object

सुधियां = among the learned

निबन्धनम् = commentary

  

So, here, it sounds like the author is saying:

**'Even though my commentary may be unaccomplished due to exhaustion of my expertise, it may still generate new meanings of words among the learned'.**  

  

Please let me know if I am wrong in this interpretation.

  

Many thanks,

  

Praveen.
