Respected Scholars Namste,

  

I need valuable guidance from you. My brother is appearing for PhD admission at JNU in English Literature. He want to work on topic which relates to our ancient heritage since Vedic time.

  

We discussed few topics for example "Emergence of Public Sphere, Democracy in ancient India with special reference to Chankya", "Howfeminism evolved in ancient India?".

  

**We need more guidance on selecting topics, please suggest us from ancient Indian prospective and somepreliminaries work to read ishighlyappreciable.**
