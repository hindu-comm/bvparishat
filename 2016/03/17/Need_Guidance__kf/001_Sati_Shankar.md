Hello,

The best idea is to ask the researcher which aspect of life, he himself is interested in and loves most.

"Vedic" shall define the space and Ph.D. in English, just a means of communication... language he will be writing in.

As we know unless we love the area we think in we can nor give our best.

The second half depends on his supervisor, where he wants him to go.

  

My first sentence is vital.

Best wishes

Sati Shankar
