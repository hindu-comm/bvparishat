What do you expect by Suddha Patha? Please let me know. As far as I know Ramakrishna Math, Mylapore, Chennai has published "Tatittiriya Mantra Kosa". There you can get a good text of Laghunyasa. It is with Udatta, Anudatta and Svarita Marks. For me it is good and acceptable. You too can try.

Best wishes, 

**Prof. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
