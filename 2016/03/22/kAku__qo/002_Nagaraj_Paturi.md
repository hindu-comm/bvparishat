It is a term being mentioned to be from the technical terminology in Hindi for modern linguistics.

  

My guess is that it could have been used in the sense of intonation or a specific aspect of intonation.

  

Intonation is a pitch variation used to communicate attitude or emotion.

  

Originally the word meant only intonation or cry of distress or lamentation.

  

But, later it came to get used to describe any pitch variation applied alongside or over and above the pronunciation of a verbal expression at a certain point of the pronunciation of the verbal expression, to communicate the attitude or emotion.
