Namaste,  
  
I am looking for "gItArtha sangraha" which is a commentary written by Sri.Raghavendra Tirthalu (Rayaru) of Mantralayam. The sAnskrit mUla with english / telugu / hindi commentary, if available, the better.  
  
Dr.VR Panchamukhi Ji was explaining Gita sometime back in SVBC channel at night and I used to follow that. It was a nice series of episodes and really a feast to the eyes watching for votaries of Gita.  
  
Would appreciate the pointers.  
  
regs,
