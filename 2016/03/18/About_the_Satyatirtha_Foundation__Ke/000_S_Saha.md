Does anybody have any idea on what happened to the Satyatirtha Foundation?It seems to be a foundation set up by some Madhvas publishing interesting resources with respect to that sampradaya.  
  
It has been mentioned in this mailing list a number of times before.  
  

1.  [During the discussion of a rare commentary of the Madhva
    Sampradaya on the Bhagavad
    Gita](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bvparishat/sizlLycYLSg) 2.  [A post detailing about updates from that
    foundation](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bvparishat/1bM9wEwsexs)

The only relevant thing I am able to find when I am Googling for the Satyatirtha Foudnation is an organization called Purnapramati that is related to it. Here is the link to it: <http://purnapramati.in/abuot-us/>  
  
Could anyone tell me more about it and the current status of the organization and if possible,the ebooks of the organization that were there on the website?Did the website of that foundation expire?
