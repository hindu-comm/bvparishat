Hare Krishna.  
  
I agree with Sri's opinion. I feel the same thing. when we start using  
instruments that aid us then we lose the capacity of our own sense  
instruments. For instance once we start using calculators our own  
calculating capacity goes down. In my personal experience I do not  
save many phone nos. and thus I do remember more than 100 nos. But as  
soon as I started saving some more nos. I started forgetting even the  
previously known nos.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
