Respected Vidwans,  
  

More than the reduction in brain volume, IMHO these seem the logical reasons;  
  

1\. There were limited copies of the texts  

2\. Reproducing copies was a slow and tedious process unlike now  

3\. Our ancestors did not have to deal with the current information overload  

4\. A support system through royal/societal patronage existed negating the need for people with such persuasions worrying about their lively hood.  

5\. Such people were widely respected and honored by society.  
  

Best Regards  
  

Sri
