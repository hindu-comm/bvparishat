Hare Krishna.  
  
Please have a look at below slokas from Bhagavatam. Current  
observation is in line with what is predicted there. It is interesting  
that age of kali also started about 5000 years back and this research  
shows that the decrease in brain size is registered mostly in last  
6000 years.  
  
Srimad Bhagavatam 12.2.1  
śrī-śuka uvāca  
tataś cānu-dinaṁ dharmaḥ satyaṁ śaucaṁ kṣamā dayā  
kālena balinā rājan naṅkṣyaty āyur balaṁ smṛtiḥ  
SYNONYMS  
śrī-śukaḥ uvāca—Śukadeva Gosvāmī said; tataḥ—then; ca—and;  
anudinam—day after day; dharmaḥ—religion; satyam—truth;  
śaucam—cleanliness; kṣamā—tolerance; dayā—mercy; kālena—by the force  
of time; balinā—strong; rājan—O King Parīkṣit; naṅkṣyati—will become  
ruined; āyuḥ—duration of life; balam—strength; smṛtiḥ—memory.  
TRANSLATION  
Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: Then, O King, religion, truthfulness,  
cleanliness, tolerance, mercy, duration of life, physical strength and  
memory will all diminish day by day because of the powerful influence  
of the age of Kali.  
  
Srimad Bhagavatam 1.1.10  
prāyeṇālpāyuṣaḥ sabhya kalāv asmin yuge janāḥ  
mandāḥ sumanda-matayo manda-bhāgyā hy upadrutāḥ  
SYNONYMS  
prāyeṇa—almost always; alpa—meager; āyuṣaḥ—duration of life;  
sabhya—member of a learned society; kalau—in this age of Kali  
(quarrel); asmin—herein; yuge—age; janāḥ—the public; mandāḥ—lazy;  
sumanda-matayaḥ—misguided; manda-bhāgyāḥ—unlucky; hi—and above all;  
upadrutāḥ—disturbed.  
TRANSLATION  
O learned one, in this iron age of Kali men have but short lives. They  
are quarrelsome, lazy, misguided, unlucky and, above all, always  
disturbed.  
  
Also read 4th chapter of 1st sknadha of Srimad Bhagavatam to  
understand that exactly because of this reason Srila Vyasadeva divided  
vedas in to four and then compiled puranas etc.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
