'Physical and genetic changes have occurred within our species and will continue to occur at a basic level as new genes evolve.'

  

'For the last two million years there has been a trend toward a bigger brain that has affected many species in our family tree. This trend has seen a reversal in our own species and our brains are now the smallest they have been at any time in the past 100,000 years. Most of this decrease occurred in the last 6,000 years.'

  

'Our brains now average about 100-150 cubic centimetres less than when our species first appeared.'

  

Question - Our ancestors thousands of years back were memorizing entire Vedas and other Sastras. Was it because of bigger brains? Today it isvery difficultto find a person remembering entire Veda by heart.
