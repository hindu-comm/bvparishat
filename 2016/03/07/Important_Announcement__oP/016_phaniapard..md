Namaste.

Here is the dictionary meaning of the word accreditation:

1givecredit to (someone) for something:he wasaccreditedwithbeing one ofthe world's fastest sprinters.•(accreditsomethingto)attributeanaction,saying, or quality to:the discovery ofdistillationisusuallyaccredited to the Arabs.2(of an official body) give authority or sanction to (someone or something) when recognized standards have been met:institutions that do not meet the standards will not be accredited for teacher training\|(asadj.accredited):an accredited practitioner.3give official authorization for (someone, typically a diplomat or journalist) to be in a particular place or to hold a particular post:no journalistaccredited tothe UN has ever been expelled.

  

That is to say there is always a formal process involved in accreditation. Certain criteria are set and whoever meets such criteria is accredited or recognised formally to be a scholar. Does BVP want to initiate an accreditation process?

Also,It is entirely possible that BVP will end up having two types of members henceforth -accredited and un -accredited.What gives credence to this view is this excerpt '*Accredited Scholars can start discussions, ask questions, answer questions. Other members posts will be moderated.Scholars don't require moderation. Some might. That will be decided by the moderator."(italics mine)*

The new charter appear to be doing away withindividual moderators but , as in the last sentence above, moderator seems to be very much around.

Again, scholarsdon'trequire moderation? How can we be so sure?Need for moderation does not have much to do with scholarship of a participant.

I can not help feeling the new charter has been posted in haste. You could have called it a draft and posted it formembers' comments first. The proposed management committee could have gone through the comments and made amends to the draft, if warranted.

  

Again, ideally, moderator or group of moderators ought not to have views of their own on the discussion they are moderating. I have seen very little of this spirit of self abnegatory restraint in BVP moderation. Nor domoderators have a right to be rude or offensive to the interlocutors.("rude language, and off-topic postings are violations of the list rules." I agree !)

I request thebvp.mangeteam to consider the present charter as a draft and throw it up for discussion and suggestions to the group. Once new charter isfinalised by the management committee , let it be put to the entire Group for adoption. A simple majority can adopt it making it the fundamental document of the group.

Now that a management committee is in existence, let the committee and not any individual deal with the suggestions made by the members.

Thanks.
