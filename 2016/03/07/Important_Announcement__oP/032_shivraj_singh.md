What should the new charter do when we have the following scenario on bvparishat:  

  

a\) member "A" asserts something to be true from their reading of some text

b\) member "B" asks for supporting evidence from "A"

c\) "A" replies go read the book.  

  

In other words "A" is not furnishing corroborating evidence after repeated requests.

  

In my humble opinion the quality of this list would be enhanced if member "A" is asked by the moderator that they can't post more till they give chapter and verse of the reference requested.

  

I can cite examples from earlier bvparishat discussions where member "A" has done such things.
