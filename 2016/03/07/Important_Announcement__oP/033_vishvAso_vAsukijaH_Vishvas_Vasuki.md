Let's not forget the converse, which I've experienced:  
  
\* member "A" asserts something to be true.

\* member "B" supplies evidence that member "A" misunderstands by direct quotes, attachments and screenshots.

\* member "A" decries this to be "copy paste scholarship".

\* member "C" joins in and says "may be you've read one portion of one paper by doing a text search. Go do a literature survey and present us a survey paper."  
\* member "D" (with power over what gets posted) says - "yes yes, we must only have high quality scholarship."  
  

That's quite irritating as well. I don't favor moderators needing to step in either case though - in fact, the moderators are better off keeping a lid on their superpowers. The members "B" in either case can speak for themselves (or choose not to and move on to another thread where hopefully there's more honest pursuit of the truth).
