The above condition makes persons like me not belonging to the List. I am no researcher in Sanskrit. There might be many like me. 

  

There is another condition to the effect that 'only accredited scholars can start a thread.' 

  

The above condition will disallow anyone who is not an accredited scholar from posting, for instance, seeking clarification of the meaning of a verse, for instance. Is it that non-accredited scholars should not post anything barring, for instance, announcement of books, journals, events, etc.? Can non-accredited scholars participate in any thread started 'only' by accredited scholars?
