Namaste,  
  

Kindly permit me to draw your attention to one area. In debate, sometimes someone may become blunt in approach yet may use inoffensive language. That, to my understanding has been also the tradition In India. For example, Adi Shankara did not appear to be goody goody in the debates. He did not sugarcoat what he said and he did not mince word in his debates. At times, the moderator may feel that someone needs to use milder or to use more polished language. I such cases, I feel that the moderator, in good faith, will be justified in giving the member a chance by sending the mail back to the member, so that the member can resend it to BVP anew, with a revision. Thus the message will reach the BVP in the acceptable form. This is applicable in case of a non-accredited member like me.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
