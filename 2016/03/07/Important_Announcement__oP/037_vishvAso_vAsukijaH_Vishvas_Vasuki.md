Sirs, the above scenario is of particular importance from the moderation point of view - you should consider it. Some might say that Member A should be censured etc..  
  
However, I strongly feel that member A is right. There can be ideas of value in anonymous writing, which are worth discussing or dismissing \*with reason\*. Relying far too heavily on credentials (also seen in "accredited scholar" requirement) brings with it several flaws: it supports a strong version of "[Argument from authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority)" which does not even consider "arguments without authority", and often leads to the flaw of "[argumentum ad hominem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem)". This is a foundational question - whether this group goes by the hubris of authority and degrees, or whether it is even conceivable that the merits of an argument are examined by themselves.

  

The downside, of wasting members' time on a flawed piece of work is nowhere serious - uninterested people can just note their disinterest and move on to other topics, and the persons who might consider the questionable source's arguments seriously benefit from serious questioning.
