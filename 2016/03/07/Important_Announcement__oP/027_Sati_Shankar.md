Dear Nityanand ji

The use of the word "accredited" is creating some nuisance and confusion. It appears like a "filter", where parameters are not or at least illdefined.

As we all know in India there are many who can elaborate "gudham rahasyam" but have no formal affiliation or accreditation in formal academic sense in the field.

We can remember when APJ Abdul Kalam was denied a professorship in IISc for had no published papers for be able to tick the publication column.

  

In a country like India, in which whole country has been studying Sanskrit as "anivaarya Sanskrit" at least .... we should not filtter the way iwe have been barring "some from "Vedic Studies.

  

The Aim of filtering must confine to filter those who do not conform to the objectives of the Group.

Anxiety and fear of some members of the group is not unwarranted and should be addressed.

Best Wishes

Regards

Sati Shanakar
