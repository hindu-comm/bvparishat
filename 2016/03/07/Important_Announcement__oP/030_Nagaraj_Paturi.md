Since Prof. Varakhedi sought contribution of ideas from the existing members, let me suggest the following:



1\. Membership could be open to all, as long as the posting is controlled.



2\. Conditions should be applied only to posting: posts unrelated to the aims and objectives of the forum can be disallowed.



3\. Past experience of the list shows that many young students approach the list for guidance from senior scholars. That can be encouraged with a condition that the seekers should exhaust other options before asking senior scholars to spend their time. Many young scholars are found using the opportunity to practise their Sanskrit communication skills too. Being on the list helps the beginners to learn from the conversations among seniors too.



4\. Discussions not research should be the activity of the forum. Discussions may help research and researchers. This forum need not necessarily be ameeting point of researchers only. Sharing info on references is required not only by researchers, there are many general jijnasus too who seek such reference/ source info. Many a time, it is a general non-researcher scholar who turns out to be more helpful in providing reference/source info to researcher. 



5\. Formally qualified Sanskrit scholars have their respective institutional physical forums to interact among themselves. Forums of this kind are an opportunity for these to peep out of their institutions into the outside worldwhich has people withoutformal qualifications andvice versa.



6\. Universities and formal institutions are any way caged in the west-rooted modern methodology. Forums of this kind should be the spacefor those who want to break outfrom the cage, are who do not want to get caged.



Let me quote a Telugu verse full of Tatsama Sanskrit borrowings, which is composed by the Aadikavi of Telugu, Nannaya in praise of the Vidvatparishads of his time , 11th century:

**parama vivēka saurabha vibhāsita sadguṇapuṁja vārijō**

**tkara ruciraṁbulai sakalagamya sutīrthamulai mahāmanō**

**hara sucaritrapāvana payaḥ paripūrṇamulaina satsabhāṁ**

**tara sarasīvanaṁbula mudaṁbonaraṁ goniyāḍi vēḍukan**

Here,

**Satsabhās** = good gatherings (of scholars) are described as **sarasīvanas** = lake- gardens,

**parama vivēka saurabha vibhāsita sadguṇapuṁja vārijōtkara rucira**

= Which are beautiful with the bunches of lotuses of good qualities (of the scholars) that are attractive due to the fragrance of high wisdom (of the scholars)

**mahāmanō hara sucaritrapāvana payaḥ paripūrṇa**

= which are filled with the sacred waters of the greatly charming good characters (of the scholars)

And they are said to be

**sakalagamya sutīrtha**

= pilgrim centres meant to be visited by one and all.

Let us have BVP as such a sakalagamya sutīrtha.



Thanks for your patience,



Regards,



Nagaraj
