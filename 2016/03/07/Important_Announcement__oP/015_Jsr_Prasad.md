Respected All,  
  

Thank you for your kind responses. I appreciate Sri Siva Senani for his constructive remarks about the functioning of the list. Yes, as Prof. Varakhedi ji said, while replying to Sri Nityananda Mishra, the charter needs a revision and hopefully it will be done very soon. As scholars already pointed, Bharatiya Vidwat Parishat has grown from a small list to a huge list of 1568 members as of today, with the generous contributions of the eminent scholars. Indeed, their help is invaluable. With the senior most scholars both on the board and the list, BVP will surely march ahead to serve the purpose for which it is established in year 2009.
