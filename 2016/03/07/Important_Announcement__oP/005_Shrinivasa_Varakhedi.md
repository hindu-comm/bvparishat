Thanks for good suggestions and timely advise.  
  
As part of the BVP board I would like to make certain things clear.  
  
Bharatiya vidvat parishat though initiated by a few of us has grown to this level with a good number of scholars in India and abroad only with the contributions of scholars. We are thankful to all of you for nurturing the scholarly list. Hence, it has been decided by the "owners" (never we owned the list) to give up its "ownership" and hand it over to the BVP board which will fiction as steering committee of the list. Soon a board with some senior scholars will be announced.  
  
Now a team lead by Prof. JSRA Prasad, Hyd assisted and supported of Sri Ajith, Prof. Pandurangi and Prof. Shrinivasa Varakhedi will act as BVP management team. All the daily affairs of the list will be handled by this team with a new ID - [bvp.man...@gmail.com]()  
  
Welcome to Prof. Prasad in the management team. Thanks to Sri Ajith Gargeshvari for running the list for past several years with dedication. Hereafter there is no "moderator" for this list. The manage team will play its role in a different way.  
  
BVP also wants to hold a mega meet and its first international event soon. The details will be announced shortly.  
  
A joint statement on certain matters recently raised in the list will be issued.  
  
We request all respected manners of BVP list to support the new team and board. We also request all to contribute to the list in order to retain it as "scholarly" list for which this is established.  
  
With warm regards,  
Shrinivasa Varakhedi &  
Veeranarayana Pandurangi
