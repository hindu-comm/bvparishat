Quite interesting...

  

In fact in creative world it is unwise to put a cap because no body knows which idea, which thread is going to nurture a new idea... now, or in near future or in distant future.... remember Boolean logic remained in obscurity for not less than one hundred years, before digital computing came and needed boolean algebra for its survival.

  

Here enters the role of the moderator, who should confine to checking that presentations/posts are not diverging from the aims and objectives of the group significantly.We can not put it absolute zero as all members are human beings ..

Obviously every post has an indirect or direct inclination to explore further. So role of moderator is like the family head in the sense used in Hindu Undivided family.

  

And the fact remains the same.. all are here to know more in the area in question.

Regards

Sati Shankar
