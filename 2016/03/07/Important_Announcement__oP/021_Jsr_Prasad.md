Namaste.  
  

I am sorry, if any member is hurt in the ongoing conversation. Sri Phani Kumar ji is a senior most IAS officer in the AP Government. He is well respected in the state for his contributions to tribal community. His passion in Sanskrit and indological studies drove him to join BVP and has been an active member since then. I think, there is no necessity to remove a member, unless he/she seriously violates the charter. Sri Ajit will stop to comment further in this thread.  
  

@Phanikumar ji, please continue to post as usual.  
  

Best regards,  

Prasad
