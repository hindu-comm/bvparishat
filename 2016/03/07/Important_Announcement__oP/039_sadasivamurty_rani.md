Moderators' time is not out of the observation or consideration. It is not that inhuman to intend the moderators to spare their entire time for moderating all the mails. But they are requested to take care of
attacks on traditional attackes in the guise of generalization and modernization.

If there is a two way choice to the members to expect from the moderators as found in this mail:

yes... when there is high error rate let such errors be strictly discouraged. Isn't such erroneous knowledge misguiding the fresh readers?

"Other well meaning members" - Who are they? and Who are not so?

As far as the second choice is considered it is good and healthy by all means.
