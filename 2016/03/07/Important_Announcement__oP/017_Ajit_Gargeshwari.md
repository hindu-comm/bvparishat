Dear Pahni Kumarji  
This looks a like a good discourse to a moderator!!!  
  
The final charter will be posted once the advisory board is completely constituted and is approved by the board. Here the word accredited mean a person who knows sanskrit and is familiar with India Studies. He can be self thought working for university or have certificate from a traditional phatshala . I donot see any reason beyond this why non accredited scholars posts should not be moderated. This list should cater first to the need of Indian sanskrit researchers first and then all who want to learn and understand our Culture better or get a deeper knowledge on Indian studies through the study of original texts.
