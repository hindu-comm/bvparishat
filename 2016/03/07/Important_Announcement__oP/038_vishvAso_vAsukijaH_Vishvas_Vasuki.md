One must also note while making propositions as to what a moderator should do: the moderator has limited time, and this will not be his main job (as shrI ajit has explained to me many times). So, members should consider this and not have unrealistic expectations from him. So this leaves us with two choices:  
  
\* Make very high demands from the moderator (that he should follow the thread of each argument and apply very sound judgement etc. etc.). This will result in very high error rate and end up upsetting other well meaning members (as I believe we've seen).

\* Have minimal expectations (some spammer should not start posting viagra advertisements here, some person should not start discussing astrophysics of black holes..). This mode of moderation errs on the side of inaction, but results in higher quality moderation. This is how I've seen most successful lists (including one I manage) moderated.
