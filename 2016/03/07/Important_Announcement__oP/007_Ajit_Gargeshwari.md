It can be extended as when The number of scholars working in these areas increases

.

The list is primarily focused on Sanskrit (pali ardha Magadhi etc included) and Indian cultural studies. To be explicit the focus of the list will be on Primary texts and their ramification on all aspects on Indian culture, including grammar, philosophy exact sciences, History architecture, Fine arts kavyas Linguistics etc.
