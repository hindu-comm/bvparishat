I never meant the moderators will be anonymous . Here is the clarification on and behalf of Bhatiya Vidvat Parishat

  

Scholars don't require moderation. Some might. That will be decided by the moderator. Moderators mail will be posted from the mention id. The list will have one moderator for administration of the list and an expanded advisory panel who will guide the moderator as well as the four member parishat as and when required.  
  

As required The Parishat has four permanent members Prof Srinivasa Varkhedi Prof Viranarayana Pandurangi Dr. Ajit Gargeshwari and Prof. J.S.R. Prasad. All members can consider the four members of the Parishat as list moderators or administrators for formality but all the four may not do active moderation. One will do for easy co-ordination.
