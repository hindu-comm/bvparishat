Dear Vijoyji,  
  

My understanding during my short stint as a PhD student under late Prof. B.N.Ghosh of Mumbai University as an external student has been that the purpose of doing PhD is to learn to do advanced research and once one is awarded a PhD one is considered able enough to do independent research and with further experience and publications one is also permitted to guide research students. Unfortunately due to my changing job midway I did not complete PhD but the training did help me to do research and publish research papers and on that strength I was even recognized to help an external PhD student of an IIT, as his internal guide. In my early days the research training gave me the confidence to do research in several uncharted but vital areas where research was direly needed.  
  

I wish the young and old PhD scholars of today will take up the cudgels to break new grounds and take up the projects like you suggested and not just do research in their comfort areas alone.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil KB
