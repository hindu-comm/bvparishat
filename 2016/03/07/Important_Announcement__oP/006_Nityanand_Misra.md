1\) भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत् mailing list is for Sanskrit researchers working from India

2\) This mailing list is open to all Indian Sanskrit based researchers only.

3\) ... non-Indian-origin scholars members are not allowed in BVP.

  

Isn't there some inconsistency between the above sentences? Is the criterion 'working from India/India-based' or 'Indian-origin'? We have several esteemed members who are based outside India and some other esteemed members who are not of Indian origin.

  

Also,while the list is primarily for Sanskrit, the charter may be extended to allow discussions on other Indian languages apart from Sanskrit. I would very much like discussions on literature/grammar/etymology of Prakrit, Pali, Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, etc.
