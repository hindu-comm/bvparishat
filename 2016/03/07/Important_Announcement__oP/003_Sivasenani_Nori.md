I personally know two of the four in "The Parishat" and hold them in great esteem. Therefore I submit, with the greatest respect to them and the other members of the Parishat and requesting them not to view the following as pertaining to them as such but as pertaining to a future unknown scholar in that role, that a common id is right when every act of moderation is discussed and decided; otherwise, individual ids are appropriate from an accountability point of view. It will actually make the job of The Parishat and Advisory Board easy as there will be self-regulation.
