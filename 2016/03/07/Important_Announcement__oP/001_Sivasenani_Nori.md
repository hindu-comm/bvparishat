The list owners and advisory board may kindly consider the anamoly wherein members are expected to post with real names but moderator will be anonymous.

I understand that one of the present moderators might have been hurt due to the criticism against him. My sympathies. I understand that it will be seen as a thankless task. To an extent, it is, as are many roles in life. Whenever one has to discharge one's dharma, say as a teacher to a bunch of not-too-keen students, the same feeling arises.

Even so, the dharma has to be discharged. The anonymous moderator will have power to hurt people, but can hide behind anonymity. I know that list owners and advisory board can review that, but naming the moderator is the best check against vaakpaarushya of the moderator. Many times people simply observe and say nothing, but the fact that hundreds are making note itself acts as a deterrent from being unthinkingly harsh. Other lists manage with a named moderator, say the Advaitin list where Sri Vidyasankar Sundaresan, a member if this group, is one of the list-owners and moderators.

Forget the pretenders, but the stalwarts in the list deserve the respect that if they submit to moderation, they at least know who the moderator is.

If it is a question of volunteers willing to spend the required time, while being named, I am sure the owners have to but ask. For instance a retired RBI officer and a resident of Bengaluru, who is on this list and who has been very uncontroversial and polite in all his posts, might be willing (I hope he will forgive me for indicating his name, but I wanted to portray the kind of people we might find).

Even with volunteers, it is best to have three or four moderators in the panel.

Finally, this is unsolicited but I am risking the chapeTikA (along the lines of "who asked your view? Shut up. I am the owner/moderator. I know what to do. You like it, stay; don't, leave.") as BVP has evolved into a very vibrant list but moderation was jarring. This is an opportunity to make a great group even better.
