Dear Nagarajji and friends,

  

If India has to move forward in scholarship, research must be encouraged.

I understand PhD's are awarded to people to annotate new texts or compile

commentaries. We must come away from rote reproductions to critical

thinking. Hence I would advocate that the discussion should aim to solve

problems than reiterate conservative material. Foe example an analytic

discussion of topics like who Valmiki was or Kalidasa's bio would be an

inquiry worth following. There could be thousands of analytic problems

that must be tackled to lift India in the field. There have been late thinking

on history. The Sanskritists must get into interdisciplinary work to deduce

dynamic information, not make static removal of manuscript errors.

  

I had suggested earlier that the senior scholars should help navigate research

by stating their interest and their area of problem solving research.

Panini without copying a western source would be a good piece of discussion.

India must lead than wait to read what comes out elsewhere.

  

These are my personal views.
