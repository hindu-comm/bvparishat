To me, something like this is quite irritating:

  

Member A starts a thread copy-pasting from a questionable source (e.g. Wikipedia, unattributed article on a site not listing its editorial board, or an anonymous blog).

Member B asks if the source (author/editor) is known or reliable?  

Member A replies by saying "This is from Wikipedia, and the article has 100+ citations"  

OR

Member A replies by saying "So what if the author is unknown, our philosophy is yuktiyuktam vaco grahyam .... blah blah .., Pancatantra says this, Nitishastra says this ... "

OR  

Member A replies by saying "The author/editor is an expert and his scholarship is next only to Nobel laureates, in fact I know him/her but I would not tell you as it would be transgression of something sacred ... blah/blah ..."
