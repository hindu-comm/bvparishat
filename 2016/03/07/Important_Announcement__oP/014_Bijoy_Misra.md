Friends,

While the changes are underway, I wish to express my deep sense of gratitude to Sri Ajit Gargeswari

for his years of work in guarding the list. He has phenomenal knowledge about the availability of

resources and an instinct to guard against subjective postings. I agreed with him that the BVP list

must not degrade itself to a political group like the west-based Indology group does. I hope the new

group launched by Vishvas Vasuki would address the discussion of interpretations of the texts in the

social, cultural and political context. 

Best regards,

BM
