The month of Maha Shivaratri is the penultimate month of the year, the tithi of Maha Shivaratri is the penultimate day of the dark fortnight.



Cyclic time of Indian traditions is exemplified in Day-Night cycle, Moon's waxing and waning cycles, cycles of six seasons in a year etc.



Night is Shiva's, Day is Vishnu's. Waxing is Vishnu's Waning is Shiva's. S'is'ra ritu is Shiva's.



Monthly Shiva Ratris are also the penultimate days of the dark fortnight only.



The same in the penultimate month of the year is the 'Maha' Shivaratri.



By the by the penultimate part of the night is the core time of Maha Shivaratri.
