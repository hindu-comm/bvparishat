Dear list members,  
  

I am glad to inform you that  
  
Select Papers Presented in the Sanskrit and the IT World section of 16th World Sanskrit Conference Bangkok 2015, for which I was the chairperson, are now published as "Sanskrit and Computational Linguistics" by the D K Publishers.  
  

Here is information about the book:  
  
With the emergence of computers there has been a growth of a new discipline Sanskrit Computational Linguistics where researchers are engaged in showing the relevance of Indian Grammatical Tradition to the field of computational linguistics, in developing computational tools for proper understanding of the Sanskrit texts, and also in studying the computability of Pāṇini's Aṣṭādhyāyī. This volume presents ten contributions in this field which were presented at the sixteenth World Sanskrit Conference at Bangkok. The papers in the first category use computational technology as a tool for Sanskrit studies. One contribution uses Corpus Linguistics for philological studies and the other discusses the development of a constitutional parser for analysing Navya-Nyāya compounds. The second category of papers concentrate on the computability of Pāṇini's Aṣṭādhyāyī. The contributions include suggestion of a computational model that uses a notion of word-meaning pair, an annotation scheme to represent interpretation of sūtras, suggestion for a character encoding scheme, and finally simulators that generate inflected and derived word forms. The third group consists of two papers that show the application of the Indian grammatical tradition to the field of computational linguistics. The first contribution discusses how the mīmāṁsā instructions result in richer classification of Natural Language instructions, and the second contribution presents a dependency scheme based on Pāṇinian formalism for analysing English. This volume should be of interest to students and researchers of Sanskrit as well as computational linguistics.
