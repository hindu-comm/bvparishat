Dear Prof. Srinivas,

I admire the clarity in Prof Iyengar's analysis. Thank you for the post. This points to the search among the early scholars

how to deduce earthly events by watching the sky. The sky acts as a reference to the terrestrial plane. It could have led

to understand the definition of "nitya" as a concept. I have not read the Vedas (plan to do soon), but I admire this search

of stationarity and transience and thus imagining various levels of stability.

The nutation of earth has consequence on climate change etc..

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
