Continuing the quest for Dhruv in RigVed:  
In RV verse 8.9.10:  
यद्वां कक्षीवाँ उत यद्व्यश्व ऋषिर्यद्वां दीर्घतमा जुहाव ।  
पृथी यद्वां वैन्यः सादनेष्वेवेदतो अश्विना चेतयेथाम् ॥१०॥  
  
and RV 10.148.5:  
श्रुधी हवमिन्द्र शूर पृथ्या उत स्तवसे वेन्यस्यार्कैः ।  
आ यस्ते योनिं घृतवन्तमस्वारूर्मिर्न निम्नैर्द्रवयन्त वक्वाः ॥५॥  
  
Vena is mentioned as the father of Prthi.  
  
In Shatapath Brahman 5.3.5.4 Prthi is mentioned as the first man annointed as the king.  
  
As a reminder Vishnupuran gives this lineage for Dhruv and his family.  
1: Uttanapada; 2: Dhruva; 3: S'lishti; 4: Ripu; 5: Chakshusha; 6: Manu Chakshusha; 7: Uru; 8: Anga ; 9: Vena; 10: Prthu.  
  
So far in Rigved in the previous few posts we have encountered Uttaanpad, Vena and Prthu. We have also encountered Prthu's son Abhyavarti who is referred to as a Samrat and not as a rajaka or rajanya. Shatpath Brahman explains that a Samrat was the highest form of a king and only those who had done Vajapeya sacrifice could be called Samrat. Prthu was the first king amongst men.  
  
Dhruv as an immovable concept, mentioned alongside concepts such as "Naabhi of the world" in Rigved and the fact that many members of Dhruv's family are known to the Rishis of Rigved makes me believe that Dhruv the pole star is known to the Rishis of Rigved.  
  
Are we smart enough to understand what Rishis of Rigved knew is a whole another question.  
  
Regards,  
Shivraj  
PS: There is more data in Rigved which clarifies the knowledge of the polestar. I will get to it time permitting soon.
