Dear friends,  
  

There are more than a dozen Dhruvas in the Puranas and one has to be clear as to which one is being referred to and in what context. Moreover the Vedas love paroksha interpretation and one cannot just take literal translation of a Vedic verse and connect it to any particular person. I appreciate the guarded approach of Dr. Iyengar.  
  

Regards,
