If you read the paper and carefully watch and hear the video links to which were posted on 16th March, you will get the answers for your a) and b).

I never said anything to the effect you imply in your c).

In your paper it is mentioned that the fixed star in the northern sky known as Dhruva is not mentioned in the RgVed. But Dhruv is mentioned as the Naabhi of the entire world!

    ऋतायिनी मायिनी सं दधाते मित्वा शिशुं जज्ञतुर्वर्धयन्ती ।
    विश्वस्य नाभिं चरतो ध्रुवस्य कवेश्चित्तन्तुं मनसा वियन्तः ॥३॥
