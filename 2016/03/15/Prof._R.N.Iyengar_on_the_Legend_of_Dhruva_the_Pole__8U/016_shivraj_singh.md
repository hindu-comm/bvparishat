Dear friends,  

There are more than a dozen Dhruvas in the Puranas and one has to be clear as to which one is being referred to and in what context.

---------

Shivraj: The Vishnupuran text that I had referenced in the previous mail (please read it again) makes it clear which Dhruv is being talked about. The two necessary conditions are:

a\) Dhruv has to have a progeny named Prithu.

b\) This Prithu has to be a famous king. Famous because the RgVedic rishi calls Samrat Abhyavarti a descendant of Prithu.  

  

If you can furnish textual evidence that more than one Dhruv of the Purans had progeny named Prithu and that Prithu was also a famous king then your argument is valid.  

If you cannot provide evidence your argument will have to be rejected.

  

Regards,
