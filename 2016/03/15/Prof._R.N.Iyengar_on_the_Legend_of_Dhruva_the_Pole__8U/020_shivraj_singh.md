Do you think "pArthavAnAm" as no derivational relation with the "children of Prithivi" ?  

----------------------

Shivraj: No. Because the grandsire of Dhruv's and Prthu's clan, Uttaanpad, is clearly mentioned in RgVed 10.72.4  

    भूर्जज्ञ उत्तानपदो भुव आशा अजायन्त ।
    अदितेर्दक्षो अजायत दक्षाद्वदितिः परि ॥४॥
