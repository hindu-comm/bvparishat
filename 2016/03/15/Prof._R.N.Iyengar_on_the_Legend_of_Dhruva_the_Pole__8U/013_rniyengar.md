Mr.Shivraj,

I don't claim to be infallible; nor am I a great Vedavid. With my limited knowledge I have published some results.Whether these are correct or wrong; useful or useless; it is for other **sincere scholars** to check, verify, and decide.

Throwing darts each time as you (whose identity is shrouded in mystery; because you have never disclosed your affiliation) do, takes us nowhere.
The word Dhruva and its derivatives occur some 59 times in RV. Why don't you study all such occurrences with the help of SaayaNa Bhaashya,
analyse the data scientifically and publish a paperright royallyto demonstrate your implied claim that the "Fixed star in the northern sky known as Dhruva is already known to RV"? Thanks for reading my paper. Please write your comments to the Editor of IJHS so that there could be a dispassionate discussion on the worth of my work. If you have published or written some material on these topics it is necessary and in fact worthwhile for you to share the same with this Group.Otherwise you can not be taken seriously; at least I will not.

I am attaching the commentary of SayaNa on your RV verse as a parting gift.. .and wishing you well in your peregrinations.

  

Cheers!

  

RN Iyengar
