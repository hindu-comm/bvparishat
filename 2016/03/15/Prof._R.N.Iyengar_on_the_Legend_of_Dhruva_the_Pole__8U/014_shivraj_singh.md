Dr Iyengar,  
I think you may have misunderstood my intent. I hold your work in high regard and I am not throwing any darts.  
  
Let me also make a gift to you: Verse 6:27:8 of Rigved mentions Abhayvarti as a Parthav and this is none other than the dynasty started by Dhruv himself as is mentioned in Vishnu Puran.  
  
From Rigved 6:27:8  
द्वयाँ अग्ने रथिनो विंशतिं गा वधूमतो मघवा मह्यं सम्राट् ।  
अभ्यावर्ती चायमानो ददाति दूणाशेयं दक्षिणा पार्थवानाम् ॥८॥  
  
From VishnuPuran:  
"The sons of Dhruva, by his wife Śambhu, were Bhavya and Slisht́i. Suchcháyá, the wife of the latter, was the mother of five virtuous sons, Ripu, Ripunjaya, Vipra, Vrikala, and Vrikatejas. The son of Ripu, by Vrihatí, was the illustrious Chakshusha, who begot the Manu Chákshusha on Pushkarińí, of the family of Varuńa, the daughter of the venerable patriarch Anarańya. The Manu had, by his wife Navalá, the daughter of the patriarch Vairája, ten noble sons, Uru, Pura, Satadyumna, Tapaswí, Satyavák, Kavi, Agnisht́oma, Atirátra, Sudyumna, and Abhimanyu. The wife of Uru, Ágneyí, bore six excellent sons, Anga, Sumanas, Swáti, Kratu, Angiras, and Śiva. Anga had, by his wife Suníthá, only one son, named Veńa, whose right arm was rubbed by the Rishis, for the purpose of producing from it progeny. From the arm of Veńa, thus rubbed, sprang a celebrated monarch, named Prithu, by whom, in olden time, the earth was milked for the advantage of mankind"

Mr.Shivraj,I don't claim to be  

infallible; nor am I a great Vedavid. With my limited  
knowledge I have published some results.Whether these are  
correct or wrong; useful or useless; it is for other  
sincere scholars to check, verify, and  

decide.Throwing darts each time as you (whose  

identity is shrouded in mystery; because you have never  
disclosed your affiliation) do, takes us nowhere. The word  
Dhruva and its derivatives occur some 59 times in RV. Why  
don't you study all such occurrences with the help of  
SaayaNa Bhaashya, analyse the data scientifically and  
publish a paperright royallyto demonstrate your  
implied claim that the "Fixed star in the northern sky  
known as Dhruva is already known to RV"? Thanks for  
reading my paper. Please write your comments to the Editor  
of IJHS so that there could be a dispassionate discussion on  
the worth of my work. If you have published or written some  
material on these topics it is necessary and in fact  
worthwhile for you to share the same with this  
Group.Otherwise you can not be taken seriously; at least I  

will not.I am attaching the commentary of SayaNa
