You have quoted Vishnu purana but forgot to give your translation and your interpretation of the Vedic verse, which you quoted and show where Dhruva is specifically mentioned.  

================

Shivraj: The translation of RV 6.27.8 is:

"Two wagon-teams, with damsels, twenty oxen, O Agni, Abhyavartin Cayamana,  
The liberal Sovran, giveth me. This guerdon of Prthu's seed is hard to win from others."

  

As I mentioned earlier if you know of other kings named Prithu from the lineage of other Dhruvs please educate us.  

  

Otherwise the description given in Vishnupuran has to be believed which connects the great king Prithu (from whom Prithvi got its name) to Dhruv.
