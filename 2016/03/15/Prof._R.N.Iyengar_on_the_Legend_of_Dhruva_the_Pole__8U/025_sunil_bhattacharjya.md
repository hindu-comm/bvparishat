Shivraj,  
  

Earlier in BVP you have yourself asked me to educate you, which in plain words mean that you are asking me to teach you. Now for teaching, the teacher has yo know the background of the person to be taught. So please let us know your background. Dr. Iyengar also asked you to reveal your identity. Once before I asked you to read the puranas, as several of
the puranas have given historical information such as genealogy / chronology, but instead of welcoming my suggestion you have been crying over it. What type of student do you want to become, without letting know about yourself, even when asked?  
  
After reading my earlier mail you should have looked at the Manvantara, in which Uttanapada lived as well as the Manvantara in which Prithu lived, but you did not even try to look at it and yet you are passing baseless judgement as follows:

  
  
\< I am sure you do not understand what a Manavantar is. I am also certain that the RgVedic Rishi knew about the chronology of Uttaanpad and Prthu.>  
  

This is not a non-moderated group and I hope the active moderatorji is looking at what is happening in this thread.
