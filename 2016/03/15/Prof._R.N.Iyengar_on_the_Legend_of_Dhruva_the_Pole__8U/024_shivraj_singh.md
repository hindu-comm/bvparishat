Dear Sunil,  
I am sure you do not understand what a Manavantar is. I am also certain that the RgVedic Rishi knew about the chronology of Uttaanpad and Prthu.  
  
As I have asked you before and I will do so once again: If you know of other families, besides the one we are discussing, where a grandsire Uttanpad had in his lineage a Prthu please let us know.
