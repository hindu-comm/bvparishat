Thanks Prof. Srinivasji, for nicely giving us the gist of Prof. Iyengar's lecture on the Polestar Dhruva and the Precession of the Earth. We had Dhruva as the Polestar about 5,000 years ago and after about 3,000 years we shall have another polestar, [Iota Cephei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iota_Cephei "Iota Cephei"). Then a time will come after about 12,000 years, when Vega will be about 4 degrees away from the Northpole, etc.  
  
The Laukika- kala calendar, also known as the Saptarshi-kala calendar, which is traditionally used in Kashmir and the other hilly areas of the Himalayan region, had its origin in the apparent movement of Saptarshis, due to the Precession of the Earth. . Ancient texts say that the Saptarshis moved from the star Magha to the Ashlesha, at the time when Yudhisthira left for heaven and from that time onward a calendrical convention is followed, where every subsequent century is named after one of the 27 nakshatras. May be we should start a new thread on this topic and hope Prof. Iyengarji would also appreciate it.
