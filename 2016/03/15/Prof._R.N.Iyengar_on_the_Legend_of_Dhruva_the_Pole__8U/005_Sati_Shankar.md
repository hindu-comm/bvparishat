Thank you very much sir, for this information... most of us who marry in Indian tradition cite the "dhruva tara"..in ceremony to wish immortality to the nuptial bond...

I have shared your post on Facebook with weblink citation... with your kind permission. (<https://www.facebook.com/notes/sati-shankar/prof-rniyengar-on-the-legend-of-dhruva-the-pole-star-importance-to-indian-histor/10153627250923731> )

Thanks again.

Is it possible to get the complete lecture , print or recording?

Regards

Yours

Sati Shankar
