c)If so does this information help us in dating the war?  
  
RNI:It provides information on when MB war could not have occurred. The default option for calling a star "dhruva" should have been that it was "fixed" being too close to the North Celestial Pole so as to look fixed in naked eye observations. This was possible for only alfa-Draconis which was only seven minutes away from the Pole in 2830 BC. The name for this star originally was Abhaya as per Tai.Ara. We have to infer that
the fixed nature of the star was observed and it acquired the name Dhruva during 2800-2900 BC. Once the star had such a special quality, the adjective became the name itself. So MB statement (Bh.P 3.17) above could not have  

been valid before 2830 BC.  

-------------  
Thanks for the illuminating answers! And they make me ask more questions:  
Shivraj: a) Do we have any information from our texts why the name changed from Abhay to Dhruv?  
b) Is there no association of Dhruv with the pole star prior to Mahabharat?  
c) Since the word dhruv is known from RgVed why would this significant name get associated with the pole star only during the Mahabharat period?  
  
Regards,  
Shivraj
