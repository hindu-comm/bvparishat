First let me thank Prof.MD Srinivas for attending my talk and for posting a review here on BVP. He has the uncanny ability of squeezing out the most essential points. I appreciate the further response of other members to the review and my work on Vedic Jyotisha.  

The first version of my work was published in IJHS in 2011. This can be accessed at

The IITM lecture is not yet available in record. However, an earlier version of this as given at IITB is available on youtube at

I would be happy to respond to comments and questions about my work.
