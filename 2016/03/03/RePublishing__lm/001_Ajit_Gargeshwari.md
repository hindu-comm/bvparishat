All Publication can be done without Copy-write or Creative Commons Licenses or [copyleft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft). if authors can themselves bear the cost of publication and distribution of their works. Not all authors are millionaires to give everything for free. We live in a free world but can we live in world without money or compensation. Even nonprofit organization have their money and they use it for Non profit purposes.
