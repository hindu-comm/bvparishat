Has anyone thought about publishing texts under [copyleft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft) licenses? Like any of the Creative Commons Licenses,GNU Free Documentation License,etc?This would make our work more widely available(to make a long story short).

  

Gaudiya Vedanta Publications does this,as far as I know.
