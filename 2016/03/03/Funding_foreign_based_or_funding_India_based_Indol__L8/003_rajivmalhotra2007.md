The first thing to decide as a matter of principle is whether India wants to be the world leader in the study of its own civilization, or whether it prefers to feed the American institutions for this work.  
  
How long it takes and funding etc. are issues that are relevant only if/when there is a desire to control the discipline. Right now many persons have given up on the idea of Indian Indology - as evidenced by Rohan Murty's statement that this work cannot be done in India. By implication, we should serve as coolies in Indology, looking up to Western scholars interpreting our texts, philosophy, history, social theory, etc.  
  
I used to know Satish Dhavan, India's space pioneer, when I was in school in Delhi; my father often took me to see him for inspiration. I remember him arguing against all kinds of skeptics about whether it was worthwhile for India to try and become self sufficient in space research. Nobody then could imagine where his vision for space exploration would reach one day, despite against all sorts of odds. But here we are! When we plant mango trees, it does not matter whether we will live to enjoy the fruits. Its a good thing just that future generations will do so.
