Rajiv and friends,

I am in a rush. It looks to me the discussion is going beyond the charter of BVP.

The technical matter of shastra or the veda would be more enjoyable in this forum.

Indology group does bring political issues (calling Hindutva etc) into their discussion.

BVP should not do that. There should be a Sanskrit policy group for such discussion.

BVP should not get into non-technical policy arguments. It could lead to undesired

acrimony. I think the majority here is opposed to Prof Pollock continuing as a

producer of works relevant to India. We could make a resolution and sent to

Murty Foundation if we so wish. Let the moderator and other members think.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
