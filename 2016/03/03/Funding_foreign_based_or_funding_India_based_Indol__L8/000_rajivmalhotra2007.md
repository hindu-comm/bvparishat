I am starting a new thread as this is a major discussion point by itself.  
  
My response points are as follows:  

1.  Short-term Vidyasankar is right in that we get better and faster
    results building the capacity already in place in foreign places.
    But this can be short sighted. It perpetuates India's dependency on
    foreign institutions. Long term it is better to reverse the brain
    drain and upgrade India's institutions, manpower, infrastructure -
    like libraries, copy editing, research quality, journals, etc. India
    did this in IT, biotech and so many fields. Why cant it do this in
    Indology? If it is desirable to do this then why not start now? We
    need to build a whole ecosystem in India that would generate
    employment for Indology related professionals. 2.  For the $4 million budget to fund one American scholar, in India we
    could set up a small department for the same budget. Have such
    comparative studies been done?  
3.  Once a strong base is established in India, we would be in a better
    position to export knowledge to foreign locations. This is how
    China, Japan, Arabs, Persians and most major civilizations do: keep
    control of manuscripts and human leadership, adhikara and standards
    in their hands, and then encourage foreign centers to play by the
    rules set by the mother country. In this sense, India lost its
    adhikara in colonial times, and has not yet taken it back. 4.  Regardless of which way you end up going, I feel its better to churn
    such topics every so often, just to rethink our options. Sadly, this
    has not happened after independence. Instead, the West, especially
    USA, became very aggressive and successful in their project to
    dominate the production of knowledge about our civilization, nation,
    and minute details of social-political areas. We see the results
    when we look at identity politics fed by many imported ideologies
    and managed by Indian trained abroad. What about Indian systems of
    knowledge production? I have no problem if after we debate the
    options, we choose to Americanize our methods. But let us pause and
    rethink before we simply continue the momentum.  
5.  The promoters of the USA chairs being discussed never paused to
    think of these big picture issues. There was no chance for public,
    transparent discussions. It was all hush-hush deal making by a few
    individuals. You were also surprised when I brought this chair to
    your attention in 2014. You then started to investigate, and got
    back to me expressing your surprise. Why was someone like you not
    brought in right up front, even before any strategic direction was
    established? The stakeholders are not just one mutt or some rich
    NRIs who can make the deal behind closed doors. All Hindus must be
    seen as stakeholders when their heritage is the topic of research. 6.  I never said they must absolutely not do this chair. What I
    requested them was that they must first do a serious purva-paksha of
    the chief people in charge of the scholarship. The Sringeri Vidya
    Bharati Foundation (SVBF) in the USA told me that they had not done
    this investigation, and likewise the administrators in Sringeri. If
    we can wait for so many centuries, we can also wait another year or
    two to have someone at Sringeri do a purva-paksha and invite public
    discussions involving the other side and all parties interested.  
7.  Ultimately, everyone has the right to do what they want with their
    own money, and by the same token I also have the right as a Hindu to
    express my positions and encourage public debate. 8.  Your views on the specific details of the chair that was being
    proposed are not fully accurate. You would need to review a copy of
    the MOU that was agreed upon and was about to get signed formally.
    What appears to have happened since then is that due to the public
    backlash, they understood the problems and decided to rethink. If
    this is so, then it is good. Its always wise to rethink such major
    choices. I not only have email correspondence with the NRI sponsors
    with me, but also the SVBF leadership candidly told me they had not
    considered the issues I was raising. 9.  Such an official Sringeri link to a US chair is not only involving
    intellectual content. It also sends a message to the public
    including our children. The tone, symbolism, lifestyle, values and
    socio-political postures adopted about Vedic traditions are at the
    sole discretion of the occupant of the chair once appointed. The
    principle of academic freedom in USA allows the institution to do
    what it wants in such matters once the funds are in place. I can
    cite numerous examples of India related chairs that went into
    trouble later on - the UCLA chair on Indian History that was set up
    by Naveen Doshi has a very insightful story you might want to look
    into as a good example. I offered SVBF some ideas and issues for
    protection, and they were open in admitting then that these
    vulnerabilities had not been considered.

My suggestion is that going forward our people should hold a conference on reviewing Indology across the world as it stands today, and debating future options. All ideas should be allowed to be put on the table. There is too much at stake to skip this before doling out large sums of money.

  

Thanks for your valuable insights and for taking the issue as a serious topic for discussion.

regards,

rajiv
