Continuing my response in my capacity as a private individual who lives in the USA:

  

The message to the public, including our children, about the Sringeri perspective oftone, symbolism, lifestyle, values and socio-political postures adopted about Vedic traditionsare going to be determined by how the Sharada temple at Stroudsburg operates, not by a university chair endowed by the SVBF trust. The latter point may be moot now, butbelieve me, most Indians in the USA find the Stroudsburg message to be too traditional and too conservative for their tastes, from such basic things as food and clothes to Sanskrit pronunciation, ritual and advanced abstract philosophizing.

  

As for the other points you make, they are all valid concerns to be discussed, but following Dr. Misra's note, perhaps this may not be the forum for it. I'll merely say that building up the infrastructure in India the way you describe it will require at least a century of commitment, with an entirely different paradigm for the running of India's universities and its central and state government policies towards education. Simply rerouting a million or four from one person in an American university to a department in an Indian institution is not going to fix things in a couple of years. And it is not as if only NRIs can afford the investment. Indians in India find the money to patronize all sorts of other things.

  

Compared to fields of study like IT and biotech, studying Sanskrit and Shastras can only contribute indirectly to GDP, by nurturing Indian minds and souls. It is a very intangible benefit that cannot be put into a government metric. Given the structure and nature of India's contemporary societyandpolitics, it is going to be a Herculean task.Because of all this, my view of the short term is actually quite long indeed!
