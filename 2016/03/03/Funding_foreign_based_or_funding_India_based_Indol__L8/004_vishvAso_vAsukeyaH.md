My current opinion about a better strategy for engaging "Western" Indology:  
  
The rich hindu (institution) should focus not on blindly funding chairs the future of which they have little control over. Rather, they should provide grants to any Hindu academic they find worthy (yes they exist, they have helped hindus overtly and covertly in various confrontations such as the California textbook case). That then is their best shot at reliably influencing academic research and teaching.  
  
This is also attractive for the often cash-strapped academics - they can keep their appearances even as they compete with each other for that Hindu grant or award.
