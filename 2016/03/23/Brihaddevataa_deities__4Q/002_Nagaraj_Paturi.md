\>Do they exist or are they hypothetical?

  

\>On the other hand for MImAmsA deities are a purely hypothetical entity, posited for the sake of sacrifice, which would not be an act of ‘sacrifice’ unless there were a deity to whom the offering is made.

  

The word 'hypothetical' is a problem here.  

  

You know that Raakaa, Kuhu, Gumgu, SiNeevaali, Amshumati etc. are all names given to real /actual phenomena. Probably, what you mean to ask is whether the divyatva or devataatva of these entities is true.

  

Views quoted as those ofLaurie Patton do not reflect the traditional understanding or insider's view.

  

MImAmsA view is well reflected in the Gita in the verses:  

  

सहयज्ञाःप्रजाः सृ‍ष्ट्वा पुरोवाच प्रजापतिः ।

अनेन प्रसविष्यध्वमेष वोस्त्विष्टकामधुक् ॥ 3\\-10॥

देवान्भावयतानेन ते देवा भावयन्तु वः ।

परस्परं भावयन्तः श्रेयः परमवाप्स्यथ ॥ 3\\-11॥

इष्टान्भोगान्हि वो देवा दास्यन्ते यज्ञभाविताः ।

तैर्दत्तानप्रदायैभ्यो यो भुंक्ते स्तेन एव सः ॥ 3\\-12॥

यज्ञशिष्टाशिनः सन्तो मुच्यन्ते सर्वकिल्बिषैः ।

भुञ्जते ते त्वघं पापा ये पचन्त्यात्मकारणात् ॥ 3\\-13॥

  

Entities of nature viewed as having an Adhidaivika plane of their existence alongside their Adhibhautika plane are viewed neither as superior nor as inferior to the performers of Yajna. They are described as mutual beneficiaries.

  

'Satisfied' or 'dissatisfied', भावना in 

  

देवान्भावयतानेन ते देवा भावयन्तु वः ।

परस्परं भावयन्तः श्रेयः परमवाप्स्यथ ॥3\\-11॥

  

are all a certain type of cultural cognition which is a true, real experience for the insider though can be explained as चेतनीकरण to use the language of poetics for the benefit of those who need 'rationalization'.

  

So devata is not 'a purely hypothetical entity, posited for the sake of sacrifice, which would not be an act of ‘sacrifice’ unless there were a deity to whom the offering is made'. It is the real Adhidaivika aspect of a bhautika entity. 'Sacrifice' , देवतोद्देश्येन द्रव्यत्यागः is the opposite whatये पचन्त्यात्मकारणात् do.ये पचन्त्यात्मकारणात् are also called asअघायुरिन्द्रियारामः in

एवं प्रवर्तितं चक्रं नानुवर्तयतीह यः ।

अघायुरिन्द्रियारामो मोघं पार्थ स जीवति ॥ 3\\-16॥in the verses that occur in continuation of the above ones.

  

All this is about नित्य यज्ञ . नैमित्तिक is not opposed by mImAmsA.

  

Yajnas are usually पौष्टिक (tonic). But शांतिक ( medicinal / disease-curing /healing ) yajnas are not opposed bymImAmsA. Here again ,शांति is curing of thedisease in the eco-system of which devatas are part, disease being the result of an improper co-ordination (sangatikaraNa = co-ordination is one of the meanings of the root yaj).
