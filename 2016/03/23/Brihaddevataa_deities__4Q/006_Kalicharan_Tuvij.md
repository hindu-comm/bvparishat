नमस्ते,  
  
\<quote> Brihaddevataa of Shaunaka listed a large number of Devataas. Some of them are Raakaa, Kuhu, Gumgu, SiNeevaali, Amshumati and many more. Do they exist or are they hypothetical? Brihaddevataa explains nature of some of them, others are explained through myth.  
\</quote>  
  
In my view, a pertinent question is : "Do they exist, or are they axiomatic?"  
The answer is: "They are axiomatic, andother things exist only because of them."  
  
  
\<quote> On the other hand for MImAmsA deities are a purely hypothetical entity, posited for the sake of sacrifice, which would not be an act of ‘sacrifice’ unless there were a deity to whom the offering is made. Yet even with this proviso, for MImaAmsA deities are clearly subordinate--they have no physical body, they are neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, nor do they reward and punish people as the result of sacrifice (from the book Myth as Argument-Laurie Patton).\</quote>  
  
Mimamsa has been judged inadequately by people all sides of the spectrum. Mimamsa - like other Vedic streams such as Vedanta, Samkhya, Vyakarana, so on - was created (at the end of dvApara, likely)as anotherimportant placeholder that contained within itself a crucial part, spark,of Vedic thought that was deemed necessary for the recovery, at some later age, of the whole.  
  
So, what was that crucialpart? The knowledge that Vedic deities formthe axiom-set of certainconsistent system. This means that discussing endlessly about the nature of deities is a futile exercise. For example, in Euclidean geometry, it would be a waste of time discussing endlessly aboutthe what-how-when-why of the axiom"only one line passes through two points".  
  
Axioms are (can be)therefore only justified (/validated) when their downstream constructs are able to successfully "play" withthe in-scopeReality. No amount of pointless tarka-vitarka regarding the axioms can culminate into their justification / validation.  
  
In fact it is more the other streams like Vedanta (known for long treatises on the nature of a deity,Brahman)that needed to learn this basic yetimportant principle fromMimamsa.  
  
\<quote>If we stretch the logic to deities (Graha devataas) of planets from Jyotis’a shAstra, rituals (Ashubha graha shAnti) may not produce any effect. That is why we are repeatedly told that one cannot avoid the Ashubha, only one can decrease its intensity. And as always there is the all explaining law of PUrva karma from previous birth.\</quote>  
  
  
Karma is a record of one's growth areas and blockades. Many people still are onto the low hanging fruits (money, sex, etc) so Jyotisha intends tohelp them evolvesuch needs. Jyotisha isalso meant tohelpothers who are higher up the tree.  
  
  
\<quote>We are sorry. We did the ritual of Shaanti but your Purva karma was very body. Ashubha did not go away. Here all arguments and questions stopped because ritualtook refugeto the unknown world of Purvakarma.\</quote>  
  
More often it is like the case of a patient suffering from malaria asks for a pain-killer pill, the doctor in turn prescribing him antibiotics.
