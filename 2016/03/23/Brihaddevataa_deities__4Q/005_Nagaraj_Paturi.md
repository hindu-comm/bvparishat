AadaraNIya Vidyasankarji,



Incidentally the book cited is from among the books on myth-ritual-literary theory studies by the author and my PhD is also in the same area, but applied to the sixteenth century Telugu Kavyas. In that I proposed a myth theory based on the Indian traditional sources and proposed three levels of meaning of myth: aadhibhautika, aadhidaivika and aadhyaatmika. Recently I was pleasantly surprised to be reminded by some Indology list members that Yaaska was already talking about adhidaiva, aadhyaatma and adhiyajna levels of meaning. The aadhibhautika level I proposed helped me to discuss the orientalist myth interpretations viewing the Vedas just as nature poetry and Vedic myths as just nature-myths.



It is interesting to see that the Gita helps us to view bhojana as yajna inside the body and yajna as bhojana to the viraaTpurusha's body.
