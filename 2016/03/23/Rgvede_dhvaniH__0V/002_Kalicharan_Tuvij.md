नमस्ते,  
  
अध्वन्  
path, distance, place, sky  
  
ध्वन्  
(to make) noise, vibration// to envelop, to wrap, to darken  
  
In my opinion,  
  
ध्वन् is the complementary principle of अध्वन्.  
अध्वन् is a spatial (pertaining to space) concept, and ध्वन् is seen as-  
1. either in the opposing sense of अध्वन्, as in: to envelop, to wrap, to darken, etc.  
2. Or as the complement of अध्वन्. Time complements Space. In this way ध्वन्, sound, which is a disturbance traveling primarily through time, complements Light - a disturbance moving primarily through space.  
  
Any disturbance, be it अर्क (किरण) or ध्वनि, is a creation particularly in द्यावापृथिवी. In this important sense these are better known as गो and वाक्, respectively.
