Res. Agraj- paadebhyo natipurassaram nivedyate : Pl convey the source of the verse nahi....... As far as I have learned, the na and nahi, both are separate independent words ( nipaata ) conveying nishedha. And, the expressions like tu, vaa, cha, ha (even hi) et al are 'nirarthaka' ones and especially used for paadapuranam-- catering to metrical use for making padyas. Even certain Vedic suktas have this practice---completion by nirarthaka-nipaatas. The meanings hi- yatah, nischayena etc are accepted or coined by the modern Pandits to answer the queries of Sanskrit learners while going through the Sanskrit verses. In fact, these words (except for na and nahi) have no meaning. This is what I have gained from my teachers. Best regards,
