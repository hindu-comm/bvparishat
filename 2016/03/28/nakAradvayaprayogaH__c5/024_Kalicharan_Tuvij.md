(posting this reply again here, from the email earlier)  
  
प्रणाम ।  
  
I took the reference from the snapshot of a page here:  
https://sa.m.wikisource.org/wiki/पुटम्:सुभाषितरत्नभाण्डागारम्.djvu/४१९  
  
However, later, on [archive.org](http://archive.org) I couldn't find the line and am still searching for it. Right now I am doubtful about my translation (done after the snapshot read), though still confident about the grammar part.  
  
It is possible that these are two different books by the same name.
