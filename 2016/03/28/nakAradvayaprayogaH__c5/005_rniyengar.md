The question here, *if I understood it correctly*, is whetherन हि न हि is a double-negative making the meaning positive or is it only a dvirukti to emphasize the negative. My understanding is that the Achaarya in the context of the Stotra means the latter.

  

A similar situation arises in the Avadhutagita 1.25

  

तत्त्वमस्यादिवाक्येन स्वात्मा हि प्रतिपादितः ।  
नेति नेति श्रुतिर्ब्रूयाद अनृतं पाञ्चभौतिकम् ।। २५।।

  

Or is there a double-negative implication in the above also?
