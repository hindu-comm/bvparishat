\> As far as I have learned, the na and nahi, both are separate independent words ( nipaata ) conveying nishedha. And, the expressions like tu, vaa, cha, ha (even hi) et al are 'nirarthaka' ones and especially used for paadapuranam-- catering to metrical use for making padyas. Even certain Vedic suktas have this practice---completion by nirarthaka-nipaatas.



----- expressions like tu, vaa, cha, ha (even hi) et al are not always nirarthakas. When they used for paadapooraNam only and without any other purpose or meaning, then only they are taken as nirarthakas. Otherwise, each one of them is a meaningful expression only.



Usage of these expressions in the prose of argumentative s'aastra works and plays reflecting spoken expression both in the Sanskrita and Prakrita dialects clearly prove that they are not used only for paadapooraNa.
