There are a number of verse cited with नहि नहि by several members. The first cited is the Bhajsgovindam stotra of Shankaracharya.

And, the expressions like tu, vaa, cha, ha (even hi) et al are
'nirarthaka' ones and especially used for paadapuranam-- catering to metrical use for making padyas. Even certain Vedic suktas have this practice---completion by nirarthaka-nipaatas. The meanings hi- yatah, nischayena etc are accepted or coined by the modern Pandits to answer the queries of Sanskrit learners while going through the Sanskrit verses. In fact, these words (except for na and nahi) have no meaning. This is what I have gained from my teachers. Best regards,

The question raised was not the meaning of nahi or na hi, but of double negative making affirmative. See others replies, especially Ashok Aklujkar quoting Avyaya Kosha of Srivatsankacharya.
