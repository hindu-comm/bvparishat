1\. \>अथवा दाक्षिणात्यासु भाषासु इल्लल्ला इत्येवं नकारद्वयस्य प्रयोगो नकारायैव भवति इति तस्मादत्रापि कृतः।



----- What Vidwan Ujjwal heard as illallaa is in fact illilla which is illa+ illa in Kannada. In Kannada there is another negation word alla which is different from illa. illallaa quoted by Vidwan Ujjval makes it illa+allaa , which has two mistakes: (a)allaa with a long vowel ending is not there in Kannada.(b) illa can not combine with alla



2\. illilla (illa+illa) or allalla (alla+alla) have their parallels in the other south Indian languages too. Telugu : lEdulEdu, kAdukAdu, Tamil: illai illai allai allai (colloquial: ille-ille alle-alle)



3\. In south Indian languages there arenegative marking suffixes of verbs which can not independently get reduplicated for emphasissince they are bound morphemes,here suffixes.



For example, taking the verb raksha itself its borrowing intoKannada is rakshisu. rakshisuvudilla or rakshisuvallaor the negative forms.For emphasis you can say rakshisuvudE illa where 'E' is the emphasis marker. There can not be expressions such as \*rakshisuvudu illilla.



Thus nahi nahi rakshati has no south Indian prototype.



4\. Since in Sanskrit the negation word of a verb phrase is separate and nota suffix, there is an opportunity for its independent reduplication for emphasis. This is similar to the English never saves having an emphatic form never never saves.
