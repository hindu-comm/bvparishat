Hypothesis:  
  
(at least originally) All indeclinables are clause-separators in Sanskrit, clauses themselves being of free-word-order.  
  
Example:  
In the case of न and हि, we should have:  
न \<clause> हि  
where \<clause> has a free internal word order.  
  
In the case of नहि we have \<clause> as a null set.
