It is ascribed to Udbhata:

तदेकां तद्गेहे विनयवति! नेष्यामि रजनीम्। समीरेणोक्तैवं नवकुसुमिता चूतलतिका धुनाना मूर्द्धानं*नहि नहि नहीत्येव*कुरुते॥" इत्युद्भटः॥ "

The verse is beautiful even though the source is not known. It may be Udbhata's Kavyalankarasangraha or some other independent work. It is there in Mahasubhashitasangraha.
