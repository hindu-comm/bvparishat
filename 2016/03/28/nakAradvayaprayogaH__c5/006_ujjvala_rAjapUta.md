Shri Iyengar,  
In the example you have given, the two न are in two separate sentences, explicitly separated by इति.  
  
Also in the two examples given by Shri Subrahmanian, I see two मा with two verbs in the first example and मा being repeated along with the क्रियापद in the second case. This is very different from न हि न हि रक्षति.  
  
उज्ज्वलः।
