सुभाषितरत्नभाण्डागारम् —  
  
न परोदितं हि कलयन्ति कुमारा ।  
  
(my translation): "sons, not birthed by others, take care (of us)."  
  
Analysing the sentence,  
न \<clauseA: परोदितं> हि \<clauseB: कलयन्ति कुमारा>  
  
not \<those birthed by others> do \<the sons take care of the parents>  
  
Now let us set clauseA to null:  
न \< - \> हि \<clauseB: कलयन्ति कुमारा>  
  
not \<-> do \<the sons take care of the parents>  
  
That is,  
"Not do the sons take care of the parents."  
  
Since "not do" is a whole clause itself, it can stand on its own.  
"Johnny have you eaten sugar?"  
"Not do. Papa." नहि ।  
  
Not do, not do, the sons take care of the parents.  
Clearly it is just repetitive negation, and not "a negation of negation".
