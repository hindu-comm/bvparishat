1\. A delightful verse has three nahi-s in it:  
  
“इयं संध्या, दूराद् अहम् उपगतो हन्त मलयात्  
तवैकान्ते गेहे बत रमणि नेष्यामि रजनीम् “।  
समीरेणोक्तैवं नवकुसुमिता चूत-लतिका  
धुनाना मूर्धानं नहि नहि नहीत्येव कुरुते ।।।  
  
2. Since na shows a tendency to compound with the following word (especially other nipātas), nahi can be taken as a single word; cf. nakiḥ, nanu, nanuca, nayāti, navaram, navartate, navai, naha, and nahikam illustated, along with nahi, on pp. 215-224 of V. Srivatsankacharya’s Avyaya-kośa published by the Sanskrit Education Society, Madra, 1971.  
  
3. The following would seem justifiable to me (but would be too much to expect under the current practices seen in the editing of Sanskrit works): If hi has the sense of ‘for, because’ etc. and is causally/logically related to the proposition in the preceding clause/sentence, not to the ’negation or ‘prohibition’ expressed by a na preceding it — that is, if it has a role like that of English “indeed” or “veriy” —, then it should be printed as a separate word and should not be attached to the preceing na.
