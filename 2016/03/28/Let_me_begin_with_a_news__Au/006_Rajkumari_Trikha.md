Salutations to list members,  
Today I read these words in a post of 28th march, by Dr. Sati Shankar. Sorry for belated reply. He said. '

"The Government has decided to form a new Notional Defense council which will oversee all the three wings, army, air and navy and to make most effective decision on the quality, procurement and placement of strategic weapons in the country. The Government has decided to take benefit of experience of certain senior members from the Intelligence services of our hostile countries, who will be on board on deputation from their respective Governments fully empowered. In doing so the Government hopes that this will make the nation perfectly secured hereafter."

I also took note of comments of other scholars. Here I am quoting shloka of shantiparva of Mbh. as my views.  
वैरमन्तिकमासाद्य य: प्रीतिं कर्तुमिच्छति\|  
मृन्मयस्येव भग्नस्य यथा सन्धिर्न विद्यते\|\| शान्ति.१३९.६९.

I feel, d expert advice of hostile countries may b taken, but should be enacted with due consideration of its future pros nd cons
