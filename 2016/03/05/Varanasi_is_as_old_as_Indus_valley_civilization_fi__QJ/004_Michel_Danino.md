I am afraid the article is little more than sensationalizing à la TOI. It is impossible to trace a civilization with GPS, and finding human activity about 2000 BCE (assuming the dating is rigorously established) means nothing until the precise material culture associated with it has been identified. It’s well known that the Ganges plains have been inhabited since the late Palaeolithic at least — many Mesolithic and Neolithic sites (some of the latter cultivating rice in the 8th millennium BCE) have been identified, gradually moving to the Chalcolithic stage perhaps in the 3rd millennium. And some early rural cultures have already been identified in the 2nd millennium in the vicinity of Varanasi (see Dr Vidula Jayaswal's work at Akhtar for instance). To compare such pre-urban cultures with an urban culture like the Harappan has no meaning.

  

Antiquity is not everything -- hominin presence on the subcontinent is now established for over 2 million years. The question is what culture we are looking at; the article is silent on this, so let us await some authentic reports.
