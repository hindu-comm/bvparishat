Could we know the exact report of the findings on Varanasi that led to infer that the city is as old as Harappa? In this connection I would like to refer to Y.D.Sharma's small book (1964) on archaeological reports on proto-historic and early historical cities of India. He did not go beyond 800 B.C.
