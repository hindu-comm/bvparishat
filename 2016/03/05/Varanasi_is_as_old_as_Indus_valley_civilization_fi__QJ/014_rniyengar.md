Thanks for the pointer, which I had overlooked. For those who like to read the details in the original and not just a news item the Nature report is attached.

There is prima facie reason to believe some type of natural disaster overtook the Vedic Sindhu-sarasvati habitation including its pura, durga, grha, veshma, sadma, harmya.

How could the Vedas and Puranas be not referring to them at least figuratively; indeed they do! But main stream Sanskritists, historians and indologists due to their obsessive linguistic (*aka* PIE/AIT/OIT)preoccupationdo not seem to have studied our ancient literature from the above perspective.
