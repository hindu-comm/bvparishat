I fully support the view of M. Danino.

Unless a proper scientific archaeological excavation is done across the sites, it is premature to relate them with Harappan or Pre or Post Harappan civiliasations. GPS exploration just proves the existence of human habitation in a remote period. Let us wait and see before having a guess work related to Aryan invasion, sixteen Mahajanapadas etc. These type of news misguide people to some extent regarding Indian history.
