In a science and technology driven project, let us be a little scientific in evaluating results. Obtaining proof about continuous human settlement in Varanasi from before 2000 BCE need not imply anything about Indus Valley Civilization and Aryans coming into or going out of India.

  

Nobody holds that the Ganga basin was completely uninhabited at the time when Harappa and Mohenjodaro were big cities. What is needed is more gathering of data from the oldest layers of Varanasi settlements and patient analysis, instead of jumping to conclusions.  

  

Best regards,
