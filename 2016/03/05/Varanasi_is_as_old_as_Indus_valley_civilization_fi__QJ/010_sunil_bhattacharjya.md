Yes. Prabhas has been mentioned in the Mahabharata. It is believed that a stream of the ancient river Saraswati is still flowing in Prabhas. There is a claim (I don't recollect the name of the scholar from Nagpur, who made it) that the river Saraswti originally flowed by the Aravalli hills and fell into a big lake in Rajasthan and then emerged from there to meet the river Luni and then with a stream from Luni flowed down to the sea at Veraval via Prabhas. The Saraswati changed course after a tectonc shift.  
  

Now coming to the Western viewpoint, not all western scholars are hostile to Indian antiquity. Late Dr. B.R.Raman of Bangalore took the help of the reputed western astronomer Fagan and arrived at the date of Lord Krishna's birth as 3227 BCE. As the Lord was in his 89th year at the time of the Mahabharata war, the date of the Mahabharata war comes out to be 3139 BCE, thanks to the contribution of the western scholar Fagan.
