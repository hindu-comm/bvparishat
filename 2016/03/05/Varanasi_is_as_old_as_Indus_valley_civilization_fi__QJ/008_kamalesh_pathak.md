sir, namaste.  

i agree that varanasi is oldest one city but i too believe that prabhas is also old city like varanasi,  

several reasons are to support this claim.  

(1). mahabharat refers prabhas as pilgrimage several times.  

\(2\) skanda puran gives 300 chapters sub puran name prabhas khand  

\(3\) sri mad bhagavat in chanto 3,10.12. several times mentions prabhas.  

(4)the shukla yajurveda visionary holy sage yagyavalkya penanced in prabhas to sun god"s bless for ved vidyaa.  

\(5\) sage kanad the author of vaisheshik darshan were from prabhas.  

to brief my statement....on average it is believed that the war of mahabharat time is 3500 years b.c. means 5500 years approximated time span is gf great war of mahabharat. pre and post time of the war there are plenty of references in shanti parva van parva etc we can see in mahabharat.mahabharat is authorised book of history.  

and in general sense (not to any member of this group) indian trend is to wear glass prepared by westernians who are trying always to down grade indian civilisation with fewer exceptions.  

hope the learned members of the group will re-define the concept what i stated above.  

regards,
