Hi,  
  
Can someone elucidate what all will be the historical ramifications of this finding? For sure, Aryan Invasion is going to fall flat.  
  
I believe, if Varanasi is as old as Harappa, then the area of IVC can be stretched from Saraswati basin to Gangatic plains, probably encompassing the Mahajanapadas?  
and the decimation of IVC was the break of just a single 'limb' of Indian civilization?
