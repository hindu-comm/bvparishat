Very enlightening Mr. Paturi. Thanks for this excellent answer. Especially your comment about the legitimacy of the King is very meaningful. In the light of what you say, the role of the King is not to 'rule', but to perform his role (karma) of sustenance as Lord Vishnu's agent. It is in that sense that he is God's representative, an idea reflected in the following lines by Claudius from Hamlet (Act IV, Scene v), though in an ironic sense:   
  
Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:  
There's such divinity doth hedge a king,  
That treason can but peep to what it would,  
Acts little of his will.  
  

The idea of Lord Vishnu as the Supreme Sustainer of the world and all administrators as his agents can be an excellent lesson in management for our bureaucrats. If they only took their authority as the means for performing a role rather than as a means for making money and enjoying perks, the society would become Ram Rajya.
