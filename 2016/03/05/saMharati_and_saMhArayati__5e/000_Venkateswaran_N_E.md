Namaste.  
  
I have a question regarding shAnkara bhAShyam on Vishnu Sahasranamam, for the nAma शर्वः :-  
ShankAchArya says :  
शृणाति संहारसमये संहरति संहारयति सकलाः प्रजाः इति शर्वः ।  
  
How to reconcile the two words संहरति and संहारयति mean in this context ?  
  
Thanks in advance  
Venkateswaran
