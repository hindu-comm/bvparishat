All the Murtitraya work through the components of nature (Aadhibhautika ams'as) and their supernatural spirits(aavishTa adhidEvataa ams'as).



Brahma works through the birth giving/ creating entities such as the Sun, the Earth etc.



Vishnu works through protecting/saving/ securing entities such as King, Doctor etc. ( नाविष्णुः पृथिवीपतिःhas this idea behind, not the legitimization of king as naively understood by Marxists and the some American academicians who copy these naivetiesin the name of their new findings)



Shiva works through all the devolving entities such as natural calamities etc. The devolving entities are called his gaNas, his army.



संहरति because ultimately because it is His work. संहारयति because he works through his army.
