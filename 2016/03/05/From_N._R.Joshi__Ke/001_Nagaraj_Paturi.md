All these days, I thought Vidwan Sri Rajiv Malhotra was not asking non-academic common Indian on the street who believe that "belief that Indians ruled the whole world from Hastinapur","All Asuras Raksharas, Devas Daityas all were in the ancient subcontinent.", "Bhagavan ke sabhi avatarar hamaare backyard me hi ho gaye. Hame poora Hindustan dekhaneki hi jarurat nahi." to do Purva paksha.



I thought he was askingthose who consider themselves academiciansto see what purvapaksha was being done by their research done from their silos, withoutpulling each other's legs through exaggerations of discussions focussing on ceratain specific minute issues into trivializations.
