Rajiv " In my book's section titled, "*The death of purva-paksha*", I argue that India's decline is partly related to its withdrawal into an increasingly internalized/inbred mentality."

Dear Rajiv, Why shall I do Purva-paksha? I am happy with my belief that Indians ruled the whole world from Hastinapur. Why should I disturb my comfortable silos by looking into the ancient history of Afghanistan. All Asuras Raksharas, Devas Daityas all were in the ancient subcontinent. I am from UP. I know "Bhagavan ke sabhi avatarar hamaare backyard me hi ho gaye. Hame poora Hindustan dekhaneki hi jarurat nahi."
I am happy. You be happy. N.R.Joshi
