Dear Vidyasankarji,  
  

As regards the date of the Mahabharata war, it has been a very peculiar
situation so far, as whoever came ou with a particular date remained adamant to his or her own date and neither welcomed criticism from others nor ventured to criticise others objectively, ignoring the simple truth that only one date would be correct and not so many dates for the Mahabharata war. That is because the Mahabharata war did start on one fine morning of a particular date and on a particulat tithi and on a particular year, and Vedavyasa had given all the necessary astronomical data required for the dating. I feel that personal interest should not get priority over the quest for the truth, even if it is vyavaharika truth. Also that is why I am confident that sooner than later the date of the Mahabharata, with all its details, would be declared to have found.  
  

As regards the dates, say of the Kalidasas, we may not get the exact dates as all the details required for dating are not available, but I understand that many scholars today have some fair idea of the time of the three Kalidasas and their contributions. We should work optimistically and better things are in the offing. I am quite optimistic.  
  

Regards.  

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
