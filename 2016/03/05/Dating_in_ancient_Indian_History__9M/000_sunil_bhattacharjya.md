Dear friends,  
  
Shri Shivaji Singh has referred to the past inconclusive debate in BVP on the date of the Mahabharata war. The dating of Mahabharata is one of the most important milestones in ancient Indian history and has the past debate on it in BVP been summarised? A dispassionate look at the past debate should help, so that any new debate on it can try to handle the unsolved issues. For example, has anybody looked at the tithi aspect in that? The Gita-jayanti and Bhishmashtami are being celebrated, without any work being done it as to whether these are being done correctly.  

The dating of Dharmakirti is very important, as a lot depends on it. Just because Hiuen Tsang did not mention Dharmakirti, many scholars have naively assumed that Dharmakirti must have been born after Hiuen Tsang's visit. (I understand that some Japanese Indologist has challenged that assumption.  
  
So also important are the dating of Kalidasas, Isvarakrishna (said to be one of the Kalidasas), Panini, Katyayana, Patanjali, Dandi (said to be a contemporary of one of the Kalidasas), Bhartrhari, Shudraka (courtier turned king), Shriharsha (courtier in one kingdom turned king in another), Bana (Banabhatta?) of Avanti, king Udayana of Kaushambi, king Amaruka (probably of Mihila), king Sudhanva (probably of Dwarka), Vararuchi and Varahamihira etc.

Regards,
