Dear Shivraj ji,

The fact that two different analyses of astronomical references give two dates with a difference of 1500 of years between them is why I say the debate remains inconclusive. And then there is the subjective reaction to such results. People often just go by personal likes and dislikes when they make up their minds. That makes it even more inconclusive than it needs to be.

Take, for example, the dates of siddhArtha, the Sakya Prince who became Buddha, and Sankara, the South Indian Brahmin who became Bhagavatpada. To my mind, the range of dates that we can assign to each of these two is as narrow as it can possibly be, with the evidence we have at hand. Yet, there are many who insist that both these dates should be much further removed in time. The debate therefore remains inconclusive. It doesn't have to be so, but there are other extrinsic reasons that keep it so. Thus it goes with many similar problems.

Best regards,  
Vidyasankar
