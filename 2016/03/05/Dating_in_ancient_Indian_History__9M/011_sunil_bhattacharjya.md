Dear friends,  
  

The Puranas say that the Kali yuga started on the very day Lord Krishna passed away and the tradition also has it that the Kaliyuga started in
February,3102 BCE (- 3101 CE). This tradition also equates the Shalivahana Saka with 3179 th of Kali era. I for one believe that the traditions are not hocus pocus, even if the western scholars and some of their Indian supporters generally fond of saying so and calling everything in the puranas including the Puranic timelines to be mythical. I have found that Lord Krishna indeed passed away in 3102 BCE as it conforms to the Puranic timelines and a couple of other historical sources. I agree with Dr. Achar on his dating of Kanishka and I am unable to support the date 3067 BCE for the Mahabharata war, but there is no unfriendliness between us.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
