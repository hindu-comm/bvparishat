Dear friends  
  
You can take your pick.. If you think the pauranic chronology and the historical evidences are bunkum, please do go for Prof. Achar's date. if you think the tradition is wrong and the start of the Sakakala is not equivalent to 3179th of the Kali era given in ancient texts, then please do go for Prof. achar's date. If you think that puranas are wrong in saying that the Kali yuga started on the day Lord Krishna passed, then please go for Prof. Achar's date. The choice is yours. If you think the eclipses in 3067 BCE met the requirement of 13-day eclipse pair then please do go for Prof. Achar's date.  

  

Shivraj, I have given the reasons in the first mail itself and it is clear that you want to ignore what I wrote there. Samazdaroke liye ishara hi kafi hai.
