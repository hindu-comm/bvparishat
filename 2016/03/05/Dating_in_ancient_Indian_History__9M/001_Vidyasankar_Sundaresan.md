Dear Sunilji,

Here's a short summary of the dating of the Mahabharata war.

The debate about dating the Mahabharata will forever remain inconclusive, as per contemporary ideas of dates in history.

As for dates of others like Kalidasa, those who are looking for a resolution to very specific dates are seeing themselves up for disappointment and frustration. If you are content with a bit of nebulousness, with error margins spanning a century or two, you have a better chance of being happy.

Best regards,  
Vidyasankar
