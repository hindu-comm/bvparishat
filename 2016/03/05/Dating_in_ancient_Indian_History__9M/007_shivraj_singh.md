Dear friends,  

The Puranas say that the Kali yuga started on the very day Lord Krishna passed away and the tradition also has it that the Kaliyuga started in
February,3102 BCE (- 3101 CE).  

  

=====

Shivraj: Is'nt there some reference that Kaliyuga actually started before the death of Krishn and till Krishn was alive it could not become powerful? Achar alludes to this in his paper.  

======  

  

Shivraj:The date that you support Sunil does it meet the methodology that Achar has put forth in his paper? Paraphrasing: the issue is not about just a single date rather a series of dates from the arrival of Krishn at Hastinapur for the final effort to avoid the war to the death of Bhishm all have to match.
