Dear Shivraj,

It amounts to distortion. This is exactly what we complain about my colleagues in the US.

Is not that we write to indicate, we write with certain discipline.
Vowels are important

for us in BVP who handle Sanskrit.

Hopefully you understand. i don't know if it was intentional. I though it was an error.

The use of vowels is the sacred contribution of Sanskrit to the world!

Any way, this is my last mail on the topic.

Regards,

BM
