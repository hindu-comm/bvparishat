Even with regard to the date of a personality such as Sri Madhvacharya,
 who is not as ancient as Shankaracharya or Buddha, there is a lot of confusion and the issue still remains inconclusive. This, despite the fact that a 'tithi nirnaya' that is supposed to have been given by Madhvacharya himself. Scholars and Maá¹­ha-s differ on the dates and the range of difference is about 100 years. Sri G.R.Patil, in a Kannada work, has given a detailed picture of the issue.
