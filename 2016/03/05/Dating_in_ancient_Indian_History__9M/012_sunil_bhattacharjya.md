Dear Subramanianji,  
  

Thank you for telling us about the controversy/confusion about the date of Shri Madhvacharya. Do you have Shri Madhvacharya'd birth details? Today, with the availability of the modern computer software it is not difficult to find out which date is correct.  

  

As regards Kalidasa's time, Kalidasa - II had himself given his time in "Jyotirvudabharana"and that comes out to be 1st century BCE..  
  

Regards,  

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
