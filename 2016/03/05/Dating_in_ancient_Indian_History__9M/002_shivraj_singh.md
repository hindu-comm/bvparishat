Vidyasankar,

You said:"The debate about dating the Mahabharata will forever remain inconclusive, as per contemporary ideas of dates in history."

  

Why do you say so? Two good scholars Iyengar and Achar both have produced a specific date, albeit a different one, for the war.

  

We have so many sanskrit experts on this list. Why can't each one of them weigh the evidence given by the two scholars and either support one, the other or none.

  

Madhav Deshpande is an expert Sanskritist, so is Dr Sastry , Dr Paturi, Dr Bhat, Dr Aklujkar and so many others. Why would they not venture into this debate at all? It is just so surprising.

  

If one reads Dr Achar's paper or Dr Iyengar's paper it takes a maximum of an hour to read it. In less then a day one should be able to cross check the evidence provided in these two papers.

  

Nityanand Misra is it possible to request Ramabhadra Acharya ji to wade into this debate? Can you please read the two papers to his holiness?

  

Shivraj
