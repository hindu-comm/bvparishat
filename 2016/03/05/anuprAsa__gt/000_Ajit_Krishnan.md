namaste,

  

From Sri Ashok Aklujkar's paper on piṇḍa-brahmāṇḍa from another thread --

  

\> In Sanskrit poetry, when a poet wishes to convey a scene of battle, commotion, destiny etc.,

\> he frequently uses highly compounded language abounding in the repetition of certain

\> sounds considered to be relatively harsh. The consonants ṇ and ḍ commonly find his favour

\> in such contexts.

  

  

Are these kinds of lakshanas captured in any traditional text, or in more recent studies? I'm specifically looking for conventions relating to the repetition of letters or combinations thereof.

  

sasneham,

  

  ajit
