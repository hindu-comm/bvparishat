You may refer to Dhvanyaloka of Anandavardhana, for an authoritative trestment of factors aiding rasaposhaNa and factors considered as causing rasabhanga. Anandavardhana Acharya also gives examples of Vira-rasa obtaining without the use of harsh sounds or long compounds. Also useful would be a study of the guNas of mAdhurya, prasAda and ojas.
