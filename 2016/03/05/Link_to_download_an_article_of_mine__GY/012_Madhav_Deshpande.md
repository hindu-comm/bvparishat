Thank you so much Shri. Jamadagni for this article about the manuscripts of Tattvakaustubha. I know someone here in Ann Arbor who can hopefully translate this Kannada article for me. A manuscript of Tattvakaustubhakhandana was evidently digitized and published on a CD along with other digitized manuscripts by the Dvaita Vedanta Studies and Research Foundation in Bangalore, but I have not been successful in getting hold of this CD. If anyone in Bangalore can help me, I would be eternally thankful.
