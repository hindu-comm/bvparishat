Thank you for the opportunity to download your paper and for such an interesting read! It is fascinating to see how this network of authors must have developed, from UP to Tamil Nadu, through Maharashtra and Karnataka, with affiliations to both advaita and dvaita Vedanta traditions.

Is there any reason to think that Narayanendra, the guru of Lakshminrsimha, is abhinava nArayaNendra sarasvatI, the author of the AbharaNa commentary on sureSvarAcArya's pancIkaraNavArttika?

Best regards,  
Vidyasankar
