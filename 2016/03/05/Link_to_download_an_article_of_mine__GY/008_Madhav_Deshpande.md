Dear Shri Lalitalalitah,

  

  The DLI code that you have given is not for Tattvakaustubha, but for Nyāyakaustubha of Mahadeva Punatamkar. Do you know the correct code for the edition of Siddhānta-Kaumudī with Tattvakaustubha? I would very much like to know that code, since I have not seen that edition of the Tattvakaustubha. I am delighted to see that someone is now editing this important work and that it will be published soon. Please keep us informed of this publication, when it happens. Thanks once again.

  

Madhav Deshpande
