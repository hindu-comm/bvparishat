Dear Prof. Deshpande,

  

It looks like a part of my earlier posting got mistakenly truncated before posting. I had meant to write,

  

"There is a parallel development in the hagiographic texts too. Rajachudamani Dikshita (reputedly, brother-in-law of Appayya Dikshita), author of a SankarAbhyudaya kAvya and Ramabhadra Dikshita (known to be a grand-disciple of Appayya Dikshita, via Nilakantha Dikshita), author of a Patanjali-vijaya, draw almost explicit connections between the vyAkaraNa lineage patanjali -> bhartRhari and the advaita lineage, gauDapAda -> Sankara."

  

Best regards,

Vidyasankar
