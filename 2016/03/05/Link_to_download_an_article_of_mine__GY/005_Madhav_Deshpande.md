Dear Vidyasankar,

  

The Preface to the 1970 Vani Vilas Press, Sri Rangam, edition of Sureśvara's Pañcīkaraṇavārttika w Ābharaṇa commentary by Abhinava Nārāyaṇendra Sarasvatī informs us that this Nārāyaṇendra was a disciple of Jñānendra Sarasvatī, who wrote the commentary Tattvabodhinī on Bhaṭṭoji's Siddhāntakaumudī. The Preface assigns this Nārāyaṇendra to the 17th century. Given that this Nārāyaṇendra had such a close connection to the Bhaṭṭoji tradition, I would not be surprised if he were the Guru of Lakṣmīnṛsiṃha, though we don't have a direct confirmation. One needs to look more closely at the works of Lakṣmīnṛsiṃha to see if he cites passages from his Guru's works, and if they can be traced to the works of Abhinava Nārāyaṇendra Sarasvatī.
