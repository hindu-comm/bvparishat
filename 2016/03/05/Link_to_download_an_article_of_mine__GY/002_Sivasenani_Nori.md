Sir

I downloaded the paper. Thank you for offering a very interesting paper.

I was under the impression that Jagannatha studied grammar from his father who in turn was a student of SeshakRshNa (from the namskAraSlokas of RasagangAdhara, if I remember correctly).

Since you quoted the manuscript of Tattvakaustubha, I wonder if somebody has taken up the task of publishing it.

Regards  
N Siva Senani
