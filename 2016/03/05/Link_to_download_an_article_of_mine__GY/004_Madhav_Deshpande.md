Only a small portion of Bhaṭṭoji's Tattvakaustubha was published in a journal from Sri Rangam. The bulk of the text has not been published.
I have used the manuscript of this text from the Bhandarkar Institute in Pune. Yes, Jagannātha was evidently not a direct student of Śeṣakṛṣṇa, but studied under someone from this lineage. I am working on a more detailed treatment of the connection of Bhaṭṭoji to both Śeṣakṛṣṇa and Appayya. It is work in progress.
