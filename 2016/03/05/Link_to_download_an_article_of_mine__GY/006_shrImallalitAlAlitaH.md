tattvakaustubhaH was published twice, once in a journal(I think either ब्रह्मविद्या of कुम्भघोणम् or शङ्करगुरुकुलपत्रिका), and then with siddhanta-kaumudI(DLI-4990010005413).

vidvAn maNi-draviDa was editing the book when I met him. I think it will be published soon. He has seen a few palm-leaf manuscripts. I can't claim that he got all or most of available manuscripts.
