Dear Sampad ji,  
  
This is a great idea, a positive outcome that can benefit both the producers of such work as well as the general public. It can get lots of support from sponsors. Some humble suggestions:  

-   Have multiple sponsors, not just one. This way it is not vulnerable
    to personal whims, political leanings, etc.  
-   Invite Murthys to join this as one of the sponsors - not only
    diffusing their petition issue but also removing unnecessary
    competition. -   Have a solid editorial board controlled by swadeshis..  
-   Divide the 500 volumes into thematic categories (e.g. maths,
    chemistry, medicine, itihas, purana, darshana, dharmashastra,
    etc...} Set up sub-editorial board in each such thematic specialty.
    This job is too massive for one single editor. -   Pollock should be included (though not as the big boss) - perhaps
    editor in one of the themes such as kavya. His talent and energy can
    be put to good use but under overall standards by swadeshis.  
-   Develop overall standards and assumption. Also each thematic group
    should develop its particular standards/assumptions. -   Keep the politics out. No underlying divisive political agendas such
    as creating caste bheda or empowering dalits, women, etc. That is
    what plagues current Indology far too much. It has become the
    playing field of breaking India forces. This means we must not
    blindly apply Pollock's "*political* philology".  
-   Keep it swadeshi controlled. Videshis welcome to join but must play
    by the rules set by the swadeshis.

These are just one man's inputs.  
  
I am sure if done well, this will get huge support. Timing is great - this august gathering of experts should initiate some team to explore and propose a plan.  
  
The other project needed in parallel is purva-paksha of contemporary Indology.  
  
Regards,  
rajiv
