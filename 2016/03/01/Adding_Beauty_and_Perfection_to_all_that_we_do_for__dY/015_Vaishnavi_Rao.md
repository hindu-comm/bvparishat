Namaste.  
  

Dr. Samspadananda Mishraji has brought out a really valid point. I work in an institution which publishes Sanskrit books and there is a lot of focus to details as in many other institutions. It will definitely be an eye opener to those of us who are interested to work on Sanskrit resources about nuances and cost efficiency factors of online and offline resources while keeping the aesthetic and utility aspects well in context. A simple guideline about factors related to age appropriate publishing will also be useful considering that a lot.  
  

*Any author - writing books in Sanskrit, English Hindi or in any other languages - needs the assistance of copy editors.*

  

It will be great if an interaction with professional/expert copy editors will be possible for Sanskrit resource creators. If there can be a workshop in this regard, it will be beneficial.
