The lack of beauty is obviously because of laziness. Here are few my observations  
To improve this people should write sentences using sandhi rules. No one writes using sandhi. If written also there would be mistakes like this. रामो करोति रामो पठति  
And lack of compound words. People write हस्ते फलं गृहीत्वा आगतः instead फलहस्त आगतः. People don't understand when a Sanskrit scholar construct compound words.

Lack of knowledge of substantive and adjectives.  
Using Hindi words like yogadaana etc  
Yesterday I was reading Rewaprasad dvivedis book Raghuvamsa. He writes pustakasya prati: to mean a copy of book. Prati doesn't means a copy in Sanskrit.  
One more thing is people struggle to express contemporary thoughts. Like saying thanks etc. For this one should read books by Krsnamacariar editor of Sahridaya also books by Appa Shastri, Charudeva Shastri, Satyabrat Shastri, Narayana Shastri Khiste. Shakespeare tales of translated by Venkatarama Shashtri. T Ganapaty Shastri readers etc. Panchatantra hitopadesa and Kadambari Samgraha by Krsnamacariar covers each and every kind of expressions.  
People should also not waste much time deriving words by cramming vyakarana rules to know the secret of Language. One can easily find the secrets by reading Kales Grammar Apte's Dictionary English to Sanskrit AND SANSKRIT TO English. His English to Sanskrit is an Unsung book in Sanskrit world. Also his Sanskrit Composition gives thorough knowledge. Charudevas Vagvyavaharadarsha both in Hindi and Sanskrit versions gives perfect knowledge. His Vyakarana Chandroday is also good. By heart of Vyakarana sutras roopa siddhi etc is most useful for on who only want to master Vyakarana. For writing sentence most of the rules are waste. Every one knows shabda and dhatu roopas for them it is waste learning shabda dhatu prakaranas from Kaumudi.  
These are my views.  
Thanks
