Sanskrit needs to be brought out of its present state where it is looked upon as ancient mantras. It needs to be made a language of day-to-day conversation. The first step towards this will be the creation of a google group where the entire conversation is in Sanskrit. There should be daily exchange of messages in which current topics should be discussed in Sanskrit.  
  

Dr. Mishra has talked about beauty and accuracy. Initially, we should de-emphasise beauty and accuracy. Those who can write correctly and beautifully, let them do so. But those who are still not proficient, should be encouraged to communicate in their broken Sanskrit.  
  

Let me share my experience of learning Tamil. When my profession brought me to Tamil Nadu in 1984, I did not know a word of Tamil. But I knew that proficiency in language would go a long way in making me professionally successful. So, I began to learn Tamil and made it a habit to only talk in Tamil. Even to those who responded in English, I would talk in Tamil. This resulted in Tamil words circulating in my mind and soon I began to correct my language. 30 years later now I have written and published a lot in Tamil.  
  

Had I got stuck with the beauty and the accuracy of Tamil, I would not have made all the progress I made. We can point out the mistakes made by one another. But we must all write in Sanskrit and only Sanskrit. So long as the meaning gets through, correctness should not matter. Correctness and beauty will come subsequently.
