Namaste!

  

Marketing Sanskrit and bringing the beauty and perfection to Sanskrit are two different motivations. Motivation of Giving Market value to Sanskrit study itself destroys the beauty and perfection.



The call of hour is to bring the living spirit of Sanskrit to our life by education through sastras that may help to build enlightened scholars. In the words of Sri AUrobindo’s “To understand scriptures, it is not enough to be a scholar, one must be a soul. To know what the drasta saw one must oneself have drsti, sight, and be a student if not a master of the knowledge. Atha paraa yayaa tad aksaram adhigamyate. Grammar, Etymology, prosody, astronomy, metaphysics, logic all that is good; but afterwards there is still needed the higher knowledge by which the Immutable is known”. And for that we dedicated great Sanskrit souls must first work on our antahkarana (that our sastras teach) to do better understanding and research. Promoting Sanskrit education and research by means of money, power and propagation of one’s own scholarship may again land us back to the same kind of scholarships to which now a days many of us are engaged in criticising. We must first respect the teachings of our own sastras by living in.

“Nothing can be done rightly by the individual working without the light and the knowledge”. (Sri Aurobindo)



Further Sraddha is a highly spiritual term, one must not mix it with the subject that is measured by market value.



I beg apology for responding the thread not being a responsible professional but being a student of Sanskrit and a citizen of Bharata. I feel we must not engage to bring Sanskrit to market for its value as a brand which was once rightly said by Honourable PM Modi in context of Yoga in his speech.
