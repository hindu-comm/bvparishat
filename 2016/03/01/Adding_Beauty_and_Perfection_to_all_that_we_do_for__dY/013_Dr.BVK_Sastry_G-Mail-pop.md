Namaste

I agree with the proposal below: \< We find a great lack of trained and authentic proof-readers, copy-editors, reviewers, content creators in Sanskrit. With regard to this, I would request, especially, all those who hold responsible positions in the field of Sanskrit to think of developing a specific course which can take care of **creating authentic copy-editors, proof-readers, reviewers and content creators in Sanskrit**. And I am sure it will have a great market value. At the same time these professionals will be of great help in bringing quality to the Sanskrit writings. **We can initially hold some discussion about it and have a few workshop before the final module is designed.** I request all those who are serious about it to come together to form a group.
>.



The posited goal calls for achieving many intermediary goals.



For further details of course development and delivery mechanism, let us discuss this off the forum and bring a presentation for the team.



Regards

BVK Sastry
