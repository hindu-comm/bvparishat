Respected colleagues,  
  
The point put forth by Dr. Sampadananda Mishra Ji is very important by two aspects - 1. Raising the current standards of our publications 2. Creation of new profession "copy editing" in Sanskrit.  
  
Many Sanskrit scholars publish books in Sanskrit, in vernacular languages and in English as well. We have observed - except a few publishing house or some authors who maintain their standards, the books are criticised for their language quality, presentation style, and poor printing despite of their good content. This is simply because the authors are not experts in these matters. We must note that none of big authors of best-sellers publish their books without the assistance of copy editors. In fact copy editors improve the quality of publication by checking the language, style, presentation etc. Thus, the books become attractive collections in the market.  
  
We learnt with the experience of world Sanskrit book fair in Bengaluru held in 2010 that Sanskrit books could attract a big crowd which ecoed the market available for Sanskrit books. But, we are not taking this advantage.  
  
Any author - writing books in Sanskrit, English Hindi or in any other languages - needs the assistance of copy editors. In the field of Sanskrit this notion is rarely understood by the authors. My own experience in brining out my English translation of a philosophical work "the path of proof" was different. The publishing agency Manipal Univerity Press handed over the draft to the copy/language editor who could help me to improve the quality of the book in an unpredicted manner.  
  
Hence, the proposal to creat a new kind of manpower in Sanskrit by name "language/copy editor" emphesize on a dire need of the hour. This idea will connect us to the idea of "make in India" - establishment of new publishing houses in Sanskrit to help the authors and creating new jobs for Sanskrit graduates coming out Sanskrit varsities.  
  
With best regards  
Shrivarakhedi
