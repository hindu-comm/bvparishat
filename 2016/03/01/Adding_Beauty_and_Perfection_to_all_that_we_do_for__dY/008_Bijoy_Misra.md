Dear Dr. Satish,

Sampad is not talking about "communications." Of course people are free to use language as they like.

His point is that when it goes to media, it would need checking and copy-writing. We keep improving on

what we do, but we go a further extra mile when we think to present it to others.

Best regards,

BM
