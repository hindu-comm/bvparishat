Dear Sri Nityanand,

Please refer to the Gita Press's English translation. Again open any page.

I am away. I do not know if they copied Goldman/Pollock text, but it is

equally chopped up. The Gita Press does not say who the translator is.

I assume they copied, since a good translator would know the idiom and

the metaphor. The trouble is the the word by word translation of the idiom.

They come out as jokes! Please check if you have access.

The translator also gets lost in Sanskrit syntax. Valmiki's sentences are

long and they are not left to right, To transform them to English

Subject-verb-object scheme needs much diligent work. One can slaughter

easily. 

  

I discovered translation when I did a piece for Oxford University Press

for a chapter on a Krishna book. I did translation of a 15th century Mahabharata

text in Oriya language. It took me five years for a translation of fifty pages.

I called it Srikrishna-Jagannatha. People can check in the book "Krishna- A Source Book"

of OUP -ed Ed Bryant, 2007. Oriya is harder because inflections are less. 

The same word can be used as a noun or a verb or an adjective. No philology

here it is pure idiom.



I have taken up a new Valmiki translation upon myself. It is slow. i might

complete by 2020. I love his expressions. I read it loud myself and then

I read and talk to a group every two weeks. After some time, the poet may

talk inside (this is the foced part, it is not mechanical). I started pieces for

my own grandchildren, but got hooked.

Best regards,

BM
