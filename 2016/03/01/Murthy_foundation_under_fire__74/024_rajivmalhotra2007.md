*Response*:  

-   Since you agree with points 4, 5 & 6, that suffices to reach the
    same conclusion as the petitioners. -   To evaluate my separate points 1,2 & 3, kindly read my book as I
    spend considerable detail. For instance, *would you agree with
    Pollock's dismissal of the oral tradition* - something he is
    explicit about in a sweeping manner?
