Dear Rajiv Ji

  

I did read the petition, it was forwarded to me along with an appeal to sign by an acquaintance. I did not sign the petition: not because of the error, but because of two reasons (1) I have not had the opportunity to read either Pollock's work or your book, I would like to assimilate both sides before I can form an opinion on it. (2) I believe it is Mr. Rohan Murty's prerogative on who he chooses for a library he sets up with his own money.

  

I am aware of the recent solidarity statement to which Pollock was signatory and have opposed the statement both here on BVP as well as on Indology list.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
