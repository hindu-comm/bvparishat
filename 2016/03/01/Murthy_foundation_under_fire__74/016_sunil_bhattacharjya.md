Dear friends,  
  

Rohan Murty's father holds the Indian institutions in high esteem. He once gave a statement that he sent his son abroad for his studies only after his son could not get a seat in IIT. Now on the issue of removing Sheldon Pollock from the Murty Library, Rohan Murty may be having a dilemma. He has to back the Harvard scholars, more so as he is a junior fellow there. Sheldon Pollock also has a Harvard degree. But we can surely ask Rohan Murty as to whether he approached any of the Indian scholars regarding the scheme for translation of the Indian Sanskri textst, before approaching Sheldon Pollock or was it originally Pollocks idea to get finance for such a project. If that was Pollock's idea, then of course Pollock does get due credit for that.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
