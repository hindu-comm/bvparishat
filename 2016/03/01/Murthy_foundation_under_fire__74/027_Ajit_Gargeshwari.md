No it does not Rajiv ji These were points

  

1.  The editorship of such a monumental work must be more diverse, and
    must represent the broad cross section of Indians. 2.  Standards and underlying assumptions to be used in the series must
    be transparently discussed up front. 3.  Such a massive ecosystem being built should be done in India, where
    it is more sustainable long term. No other major civilization
    outsources its study to foreign institutions in a similar manner.
