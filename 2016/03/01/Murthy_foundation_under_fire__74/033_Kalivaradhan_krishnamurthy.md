HariH OM!

  

Namaste Nityanand ji,

  

I agree partly with your viewpoint 2 that it is Mr. Rohan Murthy's prerogative on who he chooses for a library he sets up with his own money.

  

Agreed. Say, tomorrow some cash rich X Y or Z from a distant land, could be Pakistan or Saudi Arabia,undertakes a project to translate our shastras and literaturewith a view to projecting an untrue and antagonistic picture of them, shall we be just mute witnesses? We may know that that is all rubbish that is depicted therein. But what about our children and forthcoming generations fed up with untruth or partial truth? Will it not be similar to the present agony that we are facing because of distorted Indian history wilfully orchestrated by the erstwhile foreign rulers?Are we not aware of the wilful distortions to some of the Upanishads by some of our own so-called Christian and Muslim Scholars? We have to face two kinds of distortions 1 -In the garb of neutral True translations 2 -Inimically inclined Translations. I am reminded of the saying ' A known enemy is better than an unknown friend'!

  

When there is enough political noise on issues directly affecting our culture and tradition, will our passiveness not amount to encouraging those forces? Especially, when a knownIndian entrepreneur accords hisresources and umbrella to such inimical distortions?

  

Yes, we must register our protest, irrespective of the reactions from them. At the same time, the kind of initiatives suggested by Shri Rajiv ji should be pursued and supported wholeheartedly by every self-respecting Hindu. Let us move on to that next stage together.

  

DhanyavadaH
