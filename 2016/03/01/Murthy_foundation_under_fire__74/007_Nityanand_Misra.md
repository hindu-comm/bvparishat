Dear list members

  

We have to respect Mr. Murty's decision and I hope everybody, including the petitioners, learns something from the outcome. One may disagree with a specific statement and the tone of the other statements in Mr. Murty's response, but we have to look at his statements dispassionately. When Mr. Murty says, “I want to hear in which book we have published, in which line or page there is a problem, and in what context, and why,” he is making a fair point. MCLI books are available on Amazon India (harcover versions are expensive, but paperback versions are not), it would have been better if these books were critiqued before such a petition. When Mr. Murty says “What stopped any of these people from getting in touch with me? Not one single person came forward, which is incredible,” he is making another point.

  

Let me point out some more things about this petition which are concerning:

1\) The name of the original petitioner on the [change.org](http://change.org) petition is not the same as the name of the current petitioner. The petition did not mention this change.

2\) The number of scholars mentioned in the list changed after the petition was published, a couple of names dropped out, and one (or two) names were added later. The petition did not mention these changes.

3\) After Dominik Wujastyk objected strongly to an out-of-context quote on the Indology list, 88 words in the petition were replaced by 16 words, with a terse footnote saying this quote is more appropriate (not saying the earlier quote was out-of-context)

  

Was the credibility of the petition not impacted with these changes? Was the original petition not careless in citing a quote out-of-context? Not one of the signatories bothered to cross-check the context of the quote and it was somebody on the Indology list who pointed out this error? Any possibility the signatories were misled or swayed by some individuals?

  

These are questions to ponder over.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
