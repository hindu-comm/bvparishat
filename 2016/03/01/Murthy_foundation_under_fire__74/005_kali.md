HariH OM!

  

Pramanams to all scholars in the forum.

  

I agree with the contention of Shri Vidyasankar Sundaresan in this regard.

  

The sweeping statement of Shri Rohan Murthy as "The root of the problem, he said, is that there aren't more scholars in India capable of carrying out such translations from ancient literature. What can we do to address this? Everything else is just noise." betrays his western education and scientific approach and analysis ofa given task. When he makes this statement does he mean to say that he has exploredand exhausted all avenues of available knowledge resources in this country? If so, instead of asking the scholars why they didn't come forward to criticize the works published by the 'classical library', why can't helay open the kind of search he made and the methodology he employed to gather information on the kind of talent that he was looking for? Did he exhaust scanning of all available talent before concluding that there 'aren't more scholars in India capable of carrying out such translations from ancient literature'?

  

This is certainly a problem of perception, as pointed out,born due to exposure to western medium of education and lack of faith in the traditional scholarship in the country. It is another matter that the present generation has been brought up on the distorted version of Indian history which to a large extent generates blind faith in the western wisdom. They go by anglicised version of our Vedas, Upanishads and Shastras and believe the accuracy of the western translations, rather thantaking a treasure hunt ofindigenous scholarship. This is the right time for all the indigenous scholarship to come together and arrest this distortion and deviation.
