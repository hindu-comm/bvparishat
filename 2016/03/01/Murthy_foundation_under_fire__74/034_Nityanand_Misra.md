Thanks Prof. Mishra for confirming that it is your assumption ("I assume they copied"). I do not have the translation by Goldman or Pollock. I have the Hindi translation by Gita Press, but not the English one. When you have a chance please provide an example or two. I doubt if Gita Press copied from Goldman or Pollock, but if there is evidence it may be brought to this list.

  

Kind regards, Nityanand
