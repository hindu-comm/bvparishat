One more thing to add.  
Now he made such statements only beacuse filing petition. It's shame to command over on some one in the matter of spending ones own hard earned money.  
Advaitins never stood in front Buddhists and stopped people to follow them. Instead they wrote books to shew how wrong they were.  
The people who started petitions is obviously not a traditional Sanskrit scholar.

As you already mentioned , mistake falls on us as we failed to read the books and shew any mistakes.  
Though Rajiv jis intension may be good but he failed to show how wrong Pollock was. Because he lacks knowledge in Sanskrit.

It's waste of time and money to print the books unless it shows the perfect problems.
