Murthy foundation can do what it feels like. No question about it. It is their money after all.

  

But the fact that they do not perceive that India has quality scholars of Sanskrit equivalent to the stature/erudition of Dr Pollock is a widespread perception.  

  

Why is this the case?  

  

Do Indian sanskrit scholars not publish in International journals?

Do they not write enough Sanskrit related books in English?

  

Even amongst PhD's from top Indian universities the perception is that research on Rg Ved or other Veds is of much higher quality in universities outside of India. Why should this be the case? Or because of our religion somehow we cannot parse our texts with critical eye? I don't beleive this but there must be a reason.  

  

Take another example of the recent debate between Dr Iyengar, RN and Dr Achar, Narhari. Why is it that the might of BVPARISHAT cannot fix the date of Mahabharat war? After all the number of extant Mahabharat texts is finite and so should be the interpretations of them. But no one is doing it. This date could clinch a whole bunch of other debates like Aryan Invasion, is Indus valley civilization contemporary of Aryans, are both harappans and aryans the same etc?  

Many more such examples I can give.

  

Indian scholars need to take a stand on various controversial issues related to Sanskrit texts, the datings (archaeo astronomical) , the geography contained in the texts and so on so forth. But we do not do it. What stops us?

Shivraj
