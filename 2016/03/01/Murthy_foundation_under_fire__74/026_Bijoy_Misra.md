Ajitji,

Others are not wrong. Cultural issues are local. Culture develops over thousands of years.

The question comes whether arbitrary interpretation should be accepted by "people."

Denouncement is not of the effort, it is of the quality of material produced. "Free speech"

is not "Hate speech". The question is how "wealth" and "power" should be used in the

society. The so called translation effort is an immediate dis-service to millions of people

of Indian descent living abroad. They do not have organization. They depend on the

mother country to assist them. 

  

I agree that people should read and evaluate. I only knew after getting interested in the

Ramayana. Rajiv Malhotra has brought in further analysis which needs careful consideration.

Prof. Pollock said that the Ramayana got out of hand because a Committee did the

translation. My view is that the talents for the work did not exist.
Talents don't develop

in time. Poetry is not translated using word by word dictionary meanings.

  

Can people of Indian descent do better? People must try. To find people who have

good bilingual skills is the key. Mr. Murty should scan the world to discover such

individuals through applications and scholarly interviews. Taking a business short cut is

an insult to the literature and great literary tradition of the subcontinent.   

  

Best regards,

BM
