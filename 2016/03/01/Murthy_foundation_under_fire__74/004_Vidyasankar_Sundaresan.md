The petition to the Murthy family has drawn a strong response from Rohan Murty, son of Narayana Murthy.

  

I would like to draw particular attention of members to Mr. Rohan Murty's statements quoted at the conclusion of this article. "The root of the problem, he said, is that there aren't more scholars in India capable of carrying out such translations from ancient literature. "What can we do to address this? Everything else is just noise.""

Given that there are scholars from India, on this very forum, working at various Indian educational institutions, many of whom have also signed the petition, it may be more constructive to analyze why there is such a huge perception problem. What are the personal and institutional factors that keep Indian patrons like the Murthys, with resources at their disposal, from even being familiar with the existence of this vidvat in India? It cannot be a simple and blind hero worshiping of the American Ivy League. There is a lot more to it, isn't there?

  

Best regards,

Vidyasankar
