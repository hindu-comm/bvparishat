Though Rajiv jis intension may be good but he failed to show how wrong Pollock was. Because he lacks knowledge in Sanskrit."  
  

*Response*: Have you read my book, "*The Battle For Sanskrit*"? I doubt it. It is full of careful, point by point analysis of Pollock's writings and my assessments. You violate your own principle that opinion should be given only after carefully reading a work.  
This book is based on reading dozens of Pollock's writings - something no other Indian scholar did among the numerous I went asking for help.  
Please do read it and then let us discuss my clear and explicit critique of Pollock.  
  
You seem to be mixing the petition with my book - these are separate. The one quote used erroneously in the petition (i.e. from heidelberg lecture) is NOT used in my book. It was IITB petitioners' own evaluation of Pollock, but is not found in my book. Other than that issue, which is the only problem people have found in the petition, there is nothing else wrong with the petition.  
  
So my request to you is:  

-   Please critique the petition point by point. One error in the quote
    they selected (which they replaced a day later with a correct one),
    is to be criticized. But no scholar dismisses an entire thesis
    because of a single technical error. -   Please do not let your critique of the petition turn into a
    statement about my book, especially since the issue raised about the
    petition is not found in my book.  

I hope you consider this fair.
