The petition was misconceived and should act as an eyeopener to all those who blindly sign petitions without have read Prof. Pllock works in full. A Survey needs to be done among the 10,000 Participants how many have read Prof. Pollocks works completely in original.How many including scholars have read MLCI books what are they objecting to needs to specifically mentioned instead of being verbose generic . There is no point getting emotional when there is no reason. Its best to be always objective.Then changes might happen and will be meaningful.  
  

There is no point in discussing too much beyond meaningful academic discussion either books of Prof Polock or Rajivs Malhotras book. If the difference is on ideology and point of view then no two persons need to concur. Everyone is entitled to have their own ideology including University scholars. Whats the guarantee that Indian scholars will not bring in their ideology and views and why should they not? Its for readers to decide about truth.  
  

We also need to discuss with Prof. Pollock directly or on forum which he prefers to answer question. I don't think an academician needs to write or talk outside forums which he doesn't like.  
  

We also need to decide Should future and present chairs created out of private money be put public Vote. Should all books thesis and articles brought out by scholars should they put to a public vote for its merits and demerits?
