Sri Nityanand Misra makes some judicial points which have nothing to do with the competence of Prof Pollock

in assuming a role in educating our children. Some of us who live abroad would depend on such translations

for the future. I have not seen the latest productions, but I did see the Ramayana translation, which is a total

trash. The beauty of Valmiki is lost. The trouble is institutions like the Gita Press copy these and create

further useless dissemination. 

  

Yes, it is a valid question. What does a poor man's child read?
Somehow he/she does not read the parents'

language. The parents do not know how it has happened. Now the children are fed material that the parents

have no time to check. I am not a scholar of colonialism, but I see the power of subjugation in the process.

  

I would have been more comfortable if Prof Pollock was respectful to the language and the idioms. I am

convinced that it would not be easy for a non-native user of the language to understand the nuances of

the use of the metaphors. You open up any page of the translated Ramayana and check the slaughter in

print. 

  

The protest must continue. Some may say that they are "educating".
They are "destroying."

if the young Rohan is arrogant, his father should be approached. The slaughter must stop.
