Bijoy Mishara says "The protest must continue. Some may say that they are "educating". They are "destroying."

if the young Rohan is arrogant, his father should be approached. The slaughter must stop.  

  
Ajit's Response: "Why should one waste time protesting? Why not write and market something better?. As Rajiv Malhotraji has been doing. This is a better way to protest. We are good at planning and poor when it comes to implementation. That is where the problem lies may it be Education, Sanskrit Education or Humanity Studies in general.

*Raj Malhotra's Response*: Such an initiative has already been floated by Dr Sampadananda Mishra. It is being pursued. Please see:

Ajit's Response: I feel this the best way to go forward.Time should not be wasted in proving I am right and others are wrong. I doubt religious organization should be involved for their primary intent is to propagate their faith and not necessarily Sanskrit.
