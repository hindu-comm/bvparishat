HariH OM!

  

Namaste sarvebhyo,

  

"The people who started petitions is obviously not a traditional Sanskrit scholar" is not the correct assessment of the mood and strategy of the people who initiated the petition and the dialogue in our forum. So many eminent professors and scholars are swept under this tag.

  

If we don't show our disagreement and remain passive, I am afraid, we shall be mute witnesses to destruction of our traditional knowledge and values.

  

At least with the protest will evolve a strategic thinking to counter the menace to our age old wisdom buried in the treasury ofSanskrit.
