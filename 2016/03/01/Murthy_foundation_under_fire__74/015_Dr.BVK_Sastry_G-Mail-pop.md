Specific observations and pointer to questions raised in reported news of ‘ Rohan Murthy’ defending Shedlon Pollock and casting serious aspersions on Indian Scholarship.

The young 33 years Harvard groomed NRI seems to be great haste to
conclude using some ‘ undisclosed’ objective way of assessing ‘ live Samskruth Tradition’ to ascertain \< "The root of the problem, he said, is that there aren't more scholars in India capable of carrying out such translations from ancient literature. "What can we do to address this? Everything else is just noise.".

Rohan Murthy is right in identifying the problem, but ends up in making wrong conclusion and supporting self-defeating actions. Probably if
the young Rohan had the exposure and patience to get the taste of
Samskruth originals through the writings of Masters like Professor M.Hiriyanna (Art Experience) and Anand Coomaraswamy ( The dance of Shiva), the line of action would have become clear.



Rohan Murthy and the like do not seem to have been groomed to the ‘ same cultural ethos and prioritized value system of Dharma –Standards’ as their grand parental generation ; Or they might have given it up to find an accolade at a different environment. It is indeed highly appreciated that the young person asks the question ‘ What can we do to address this’ ? 



Had Rohan Murthy had the advantage of being exposed to ‘ Indian Traditional Equivalent of Harvard’, the debate would have taken a different turn altogether. The challenge of Translation and its presentation would have become clear; and it would have solved the question - ‘Who needs to be placed in charge of SUCH TRANSLATIONS and How to Support the project’ . In Traditional approach, and also internationally , ‘ Translation’ does not mean ‘ Telling a Story in a cinematic mode to entertain’ . Translation (Bhashaantra ) has to respect the proper flow of the Essence and emotion (= Rasa- Bhava-nirantara pravaaha) of the source work. To do Such translation, the eminent translator must have command over the languages of the source and target and on top of it what ‘ Sa-Hrudayataa’ (a non translatable, technical Samskruth word for Standards of Translation) - Resonating Head and Heart and deep sensitivity of taste of a connoisseur and a clear vision as clear as Valmiki had expressed in the words ‘Sanmanushya mano yathaa’. Every one who reads one of the thousand versions of Bible translations Or the watchers of ‘ Ten Commandments Movies’ do not become qualified to do the Bible translation or perform the Sermons in a Church.



If Rohan Murthy does desire to dawn the mantle of ‘Harbinger of Good News’ and ‘ Savior of Indian Traditions in a world preferring languages other than Sanskrit’, then the best way is to see How Sanskrit was presented in Indian regional languages for several millennia. The
trends set by nineteenth and twentieth century in getting ‘All Four Vedas translated to Kannada under the patronage of The Maharaja of Mysore, The translation of Ramayana and Mahabharta in to Kannada by individual scholars with great passion, will point out what needs to be done and cautions that need to be exercised.



**Surprisingly** – Ronahn Murthy’s response as reported does not make any objective pointers and filters based on which the damaging and damning conclusion was drawn on Indian scholarship ! Probably Rohan Murthy’s perceived Sanskrit the same way as Sheldon Pollock –‘ Sanskrit is Dead’ ! In this path, the next project point for historic research would be to identify the cutoff date when ‘Scholars in India became an extinct species , incapable of making Good World Class Translations’ ? And projects to invest on modes for ‘ resurrection and ascension’ of Sanskrit Classical Scholarship ?! For a reference to trigger such studies, the publication dates of English writings by eminent personalities like Dr.S.Radhakrishnan, Dasgupta, Srinivasa Sastry,
scholar-Saints from many institutions of eminence like Ramakrishna mission, which presented Indian Samskruth texts and messages
effectively all over globe, can be used. And this would serve, certainly better than ‘ Sacred books of East’ series and the fall outs of its genre as the cutoff date for reference.



In this sense, Rohan Murthy’s reported statement as above is nothing short of ‘ arrogance’ which in traditional model , using Banabhatta , would superbly fulfill all the four conditions in the Subhashita \<
Yauvanam, Dhanasampattih, Prabhutvam , Avivekitaa; ekaikamapyanathaya, kimu yatra chatushtayam’ \>.



**Coming to specific of ‘ Line and Page reference and resource where things have gone wrong’ in such projects. **

I am placing below the extract from the URL : :
<http://www.claysanskritlibrary.org/about_ramayana.php> This URL presents the summary of Ramayana Chapters by eminent Translators like Robert Goldman, Sheldon Pollock…: . Please go through the same and see what is missing ‘ in the Translation –summary –orientation’ of Ramayana and how it is out of tune with tradition and culture. The generations that have grown up with Valmiki Ramayana and Tusli /Kamba / Torave Ramayan will understand what is the error in the first reading, even with Indian incompetence for English! The approach of Clay Sanskrit Library and the like may be sensed by reading this one opening paragraph below. Do we get any link between Valmiki’s Rama as ‘ Maryada Purushottama Sri Rama as Avatar of MahaVishnu for Dharma –upholding’ in this sampler – translation ?





# Ramáyana Synopsis

By John P. Clay

[TABLE]





The generations that are growing up with Ramayana presented as the
comic strip model ‘ACK’ (= Amar Chitra Katha) and Hollywood model of
Sagar Ramayana, Sony versions of Hanuman and Mahabharta, Superman models of Ganesha - fail to understand why the above is not a true representation of ‘ Tradition – A Text of Classical Tradition OR a Classic Text’. ‘Sita Sings the Blues’ is a good entertainment that comes as an offshoot of ‘SUCH TRANSLATIONS’ for ‘ PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT’. The travesty of telling Ramayana as ‘Hari-Katha’ to spread DHARMA ends up in the ‘ Theatrical Shows highlighting the
Indian Male oppression , projecting violation of Human rights and Gender bias’ ?!



**NOT surprising ! because ‘Academic Freedom’ is the Achilles Shield which guards t ‘ Such Translation and Translator’.**
