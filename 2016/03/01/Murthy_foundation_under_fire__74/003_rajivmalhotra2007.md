The matter should have nothing to do with JNU.  
  
It is a choice with long-term implications between two approaches:  

-   One is Murthy Library.  
-   The second is Sampadananda Mishra's "Vande Matram Library" proposal
    mentioned in the thread titled "Adding Beauty and Perfection to all
    that we do for Sanskrit".

  
These options should be debated without personal acrimony, politics, etc. The stakeholders are not just wealthy donors and hired scholars, but also all the Bharatiyas who cherish their samskriti with shraddha.  
  
Responsible media ought to frame this issue properly and not as shortsighted sensationalism.
