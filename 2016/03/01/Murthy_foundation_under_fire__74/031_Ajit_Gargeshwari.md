Dear Prof. Misra,  
  
Gita Press Books are published to create awareness to the common man about various Hindu texts. They are not meant for scholars. A translation is not a substitute for the original. Each translator will translate differently. Individual tastes varies. If you want to discuss further please make a new thread  

  

Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari  
न जायते म्रियते वा कदाचिन्नायं भूत्वा भविता वा न भूयः।  
अजो नित्यः शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणो न हन्यते हन्यमाने शरीरे।।2.20।।
