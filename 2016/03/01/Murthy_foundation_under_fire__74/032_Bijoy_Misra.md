If you think appropriate, we might do a translation thread. 

But I do not know if we have enough people in the list with

translation interest. We can try and generate interest. 

I can share my experience. translation is a literary activity.

Rohan Murty can also say that he is creating "awareness",

but most times "awareness" is the only knowledge we get!

This is particularly true for the youth. 

  

Let me think of a thread. I will write Monday.
