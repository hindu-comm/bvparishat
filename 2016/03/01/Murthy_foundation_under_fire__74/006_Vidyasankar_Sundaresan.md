I wouldn't place the blame on western education and scientific approach and analysis. If you look around at the members of this very forum, all of us have had western educations and many of us are scientists. We have people with bachelors, masters and doctoral degrees in various science and technology fields here. Yet, none of us would make this kind of sweeping generalization about scholars who stay and work in India. Yes, there are lots of factors that compromise output and impediments in the way of quality, but that is not due to intrinsic lack of ability or qualifications. These problems are more institutional and environmental in India, in my opinion.

  

Indeed, I would argue that Indian scholarship could benefit with a healthy dose of proper scientific approach and analysis. Not just in Sanskrit or Tamil/Telugu/Kannada/Hindi related fields, but also in the more modern humanistic fields derived from the West. This is just my opinion, but it was rather unscientific of Mr. Murty to have dismissed things like this. I'm sure lots of things are said in the heat of the moment, in reaction to provocative statements, but I hope cooler heads prevail and something positive emerges out of this intellectual churn.

  

At the very least, it should be obvious that professors in Indian universities and institutions like the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan have a huge public relations job to do at home, with respect to what it is they do and what values they stand for.

  

Best regards,
