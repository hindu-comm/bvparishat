If we take the view “Why should one go to him bugging,” then why should we one bug him with a petition to remove Pollock either? If he has gone with Pollock, let him stay with Pollock. Why can we not start a \[bigger or better\] library by approaching the cash-rich Hindu temples like TTD, or the highly organized RSS-backed Samskrita Bharati, or the rich descendants of rulers of Rajasthan/Mysore/Travancore, or the Marwaris who feed crores in Kumbha Mela-s?
