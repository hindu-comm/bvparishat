It is interesting to note that staff reporter of The Hindu has mentioned only Prof. Pollock's support for the JNU issue as the only reason for the petition against his involvement in Murthy Foundation, and conveniently ignored all the other reasons detailed the the petition including Prof. Pollock's technical incompetence in taking up such a role.

It is sad to see that Indian media bias against anything bharateeya is at its helm currently.
