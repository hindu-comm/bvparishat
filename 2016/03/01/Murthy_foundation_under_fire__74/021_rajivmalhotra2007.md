I agree with Shri Nityanand Misra ji that the IITB petitioners made a technical error by citing *one* Pollock quote erroneously. I have no clue why they chose this particular quote. They have my book, and it contains 100s of quotes they might have considered instead. My book does not use this particular quote. So I cannot explain this error.  
  
However, you must evaluate the overall thesis contained in their petition, which I find compelling. Their main points are:  

1.  Pollock's work has biases - this is adequately established in my
    book backed by 100s of quotes, so please do read it. 2.  For example, Pollock dismisses the sacred element from the
    tradition, regards "*political* philology" as the correct
    methodology to use, finds social abuses in the texts (against
    dalits, women, muslims) as the predominant quality, and calls his
    peers to expunge the Sanskrit tradition of its inbuilt
    oppressiveness. 3.  He is a very political animal, having initiated and participated in
    numerous political petitions against Hindus. A chief editor must be
    more neutral. 4.  The editorship of such a monumental work must be more diverse, and
    must represent the broad cross section of Indians. 5.  Standards and underlying assumptions to be used in the series must
    be transparently discussed up front. 6.  Such a massive ecosystem being built should be done in India, where
    it is more sustainable long term. No other major civilization
    outsources its study to foreign institutions in a similar manner.  

I cannot believe that you are able to set all this aside just for one technical error. I request that you set aside the media sensations, which the opponents can create because of their power base and not because of merit. Please read the petition closely point by point. Judge it by itself and please present your views.
