Dear scholars,



अर्थात्पदं स्वाभिधेयं पदाद्वाक्यार्थनिर्णयः।

पदसंघातजं वाक्यं वर्णसंघातजं पदम्॥२.११७॥ बृहद्देवता



Translation (AA MACDONELL):

From the sense (comes) the word (pada), its designation ;

from the word (comes) the ascertainment of the sense of the

sentence (vakya). (For) the sentence arises from an aggregation

of words, the word arises from an aggregation of letters.





It appears that the word "artha" is not merely meaning, but includes the purpose or intent behind the meaning in the context of a sacrifice. This is consistent with 2.99 which says that "artha" is predominant प्रधानमर्थ: and that the words should be subject to the artha शब्दानर्थवशं नयेत् (2.99) by various means of construing meanings, नानान्वयोपायैः



Anand
