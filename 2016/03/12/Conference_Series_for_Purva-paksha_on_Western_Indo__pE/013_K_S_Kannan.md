Dear Sati Shankar,

  

Your opinions and suggestions are indeed solicited!

  

You have sympathetic concerns and kindred approaches. While it is true that not all Westerners are instinctively inimical to our heritage, there are many Indian scholar-sepoys, on the other hand, who take pride in playing into the hands of even such Westerners as unabashedly display an overbearing animosity to whatever issues from the East. Mercenary-scholars and "converts" to Western paradigms suffer from an inalienable inferiority complex or delusion (or both) and beam with a confidence "that can only make angels weep". The self-imposed "White man's burden" is kindred to that of the beast of burden "that carries sandalwood, seldom comprehending the fragrance and value of what it carries" : "*bhArasya vettA*, *na tu candanasya*". Aptly did Coomaraswamy reprimand ABKeith, insolence incarnate, for example, with the Vedic taunt "*yas tan na veda kim RcA karis"yati ?*" for foraying into realms that were beyond his ken, and which he further held in nothing but transparent contempt. Well did a good many Western academicians "succeed" so well, fitting to a T the famed formula of Mark Twain, of blending "a fair degree of ignorance and immense confidence"!

  

It is only a handful of overly notorious Westerners that this series of conferences deigns to consider, if only to lay bare their rank prejudices and wilfully subversive programs, to an unsuspecting populace in awe of the West. Thereafter it seeks to deliberate upon what is valuable in our own time-honoured tradition, and upon a study of ways of broadcasting and perpetuating the same, lest a newer Orientalism spread its tentacles over the heritage that was hospitable to all and sought to harm none, and endeavoured to uplift humanity sans selfishness and sans all propaganda.
