Respected Prof Kannan Ji  
  
It's nice to learn about the series of workshop on the western Indology. The stages of action plan for the proposed series are well conceived. I will also participate in the series in order to learn from the scholars.  
  
The selected topics are very crucial in terms of understanding and response. For me as a novice, some of his early papers written in the beginning of his carrier are a good starting point. Can you suggest some papers ? With that we can understand his turning points too.  
  
I went through the project proposal attached to the mail. I agree with you on the major idea. Yet, I beg to differ with you on the flowing passage -  
  
Q  
While extensive and intensive studies of the heritage of every country are a natural concern of the respective countrymen, it is a paradox that Indian heritage is being studied too little by Indian scholars themselves, and rather extensively by Western academicians.This is a dangerous imbalance that must be rectified.  
UQ  
  
As a matter of fact that you too are well aware of, the traditional scholarship continues with its regiur in all aspects. Some decline in the quantity is not a measure for our standards. First we should know what is our strength. The traditional scholarly fraternity is happy with whatever it is offering now. If we want anything from them, it is our duty to get them in our sphere and work with them.. We should establish the connection. The scientists never come to limelight of the public Dias. How many scientists are known to the world? I don't care if some one from America or somebody says the Indian scholarship is not worthy or not upto the marks. Who has set these standards ? Shall I evaluate them using my own standards ? None of these "Plolloks" or his so called opponents (don't take offending) come near to any of my team that includes great scholars like Prof Tatacharya, prof Prahlada char, Prof. Mani Shastrigal, prof Haridas Bhat, prof. Ramakrishnamacharyulu, prof Vasudeva Potti, Prof shrivatsankacharya, prof. H N Bhat, prof. Naveena Holla, prof k e devanathan prof Shatavadhani Ganesh, prof Devadatta Patil, prof Radhavallabh Tripathi, prof. Kutumba Shastry and the list goes on. We will witness a galaxy of scholars with depth if we attend any of these traditional vakyarthas. Even today such vakyarthas are conducted. I too take part in it and learn many new ideas each time. That's how I maintain my understanding of traditional knowledge. I can list out a minimum of hundred young scholars who are continuing the tradition with a passion. They don't get any support, no recognition, no means for their life. Unless you nourish that root, all these our acts are just a drama. Despite of no support, the young generation wants to retain the scholarship. If some one like Rohan Murthi says it's fine. He is ignorant and his purpose of saying was different. He wanted scholars exposed to the modern English education. He is interested in English scholarship. But, we should not do the same mistake. Kindly do not mistake me that I differ from you. Of course you are one of the rare stalwarts of erudition of our nation. I admire you. But, in all recent public discussions the similar statements are written. We should be clear while writing.  
  
Yes, I agree that the scholars who can understand both the edges are very rare. Scholars who have got background of tradition and the modern exposure are a few in number. People like Dr. Korada, Dr. Ramanujan, Dr. Ramasubramanian, Dr. Pandurangi, Dr. Malhar Kulakrni, Dr. Vishnu Namboodiri, Dr. Mishra, Prof Shukla and so on. If we ignore such people how can we succeed in this battle ?  
  
I therefore request the organisers to take note of my "spirit" than the words. We need the bridge persons as well as traditional scholars for this project as it was recognised in the concept note. As part of the second phase of the action plan, the scholars who can act as bridge will be very crucial for the success of the project. We need to groom them or that kind of scholarship for the future. We should also recognise the traditional scholarship with due respect.  
  
Again I am sure you would take my words as the words of a dearest younger friend.  
  
Anyway this project is a welcome for all of us. We will make it possible.  
  
With best regards  
Shrinivasa Varakhedi
