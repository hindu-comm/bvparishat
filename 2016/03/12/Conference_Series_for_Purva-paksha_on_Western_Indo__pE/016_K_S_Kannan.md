Useful inputs.

  

As a general phenomenon, Indian boys and girls working in the fields of science and technology are rather more sensible. It is those who enter into the streams of humanities and social sciences, and especially those landing in Western universities, that are open to perversion, and eventually become hard-core despisers of anything Oriental in spirit.

  

The phenomenon in India seems to go on these lines: As a rule, Western theories are imported wholesale in our text books in the humanities and social sciences, including especially literary criticism/linguistics, without any consideration for the local situation here or the long history and traditions here which may widely differ from the West in terms of values and tastes. It is the students of these that turn easy saboteurs.

  

And as a good majority of those who are going to arts/ humanities/social sciences seem to be those who could not fare well in science and mathematics, and so do not earn "well", there is an apparent polarisation here, too. And further, as the "lower classes" find it easy to get a degree in the Arts courses, they get groomed ultimately to hate our inheritance almost naturally, and become easy instruments of wily politicians.

  

The picture presented here is, of course, too facile, and the situation needs to be studied with greater care. But this seems to represent a general trend. "Who speaks for the East?" - is by no means a new question. China and Japan have somehow withstood the intellectual onslaught of the West, as they never yielded ground to the Western ideologies on a very large scale. In contrast, with the large mass of colonised minds (even among the elite) in our country, even rousing a nominal or minimal interest in our heritage - leave alone stirring a sense of pride or evoking a spirit of deep inquiry- is going to be a formidable task. Apathy reigns supreme, and distractions galore.

  

The points you have raised are very significant, and we must begin somewhere to remedy the situation. A key aim of ours should be to build an ecology for our own value-systems and objects of study - comparable to what atmosphere the West itself provides to its citizens (and especially university students/the elite), in order to nurture and enlarge the sphere of influence of its own ideas and ideologies. The kind of scholarships/stipends/library facilities/job opportunities/emoluments/journal access/publication culture/financial and other incentives etc. that obtain there - must soon become a reality here too!
