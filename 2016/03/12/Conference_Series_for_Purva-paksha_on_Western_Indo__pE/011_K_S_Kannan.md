Dear Prof Varakhedi,

  

I appreciate the spirit of your response.

  

You have made a good note of the great scholars of our tradition who are all big assets of our heritage. It is with the help, cooperation and guidance of all the people listed by you, and many more, that the project we want to proceed with can turn out good results. Persons like you who can help in roping in more and more of such scholars for this project.

  

It is only when we cast a balance sheet of our strengths and weaknesses that we know what steps we need to undertake. Continuous evaluation and continuous upgradation are the watchwords of any good management system.

  

**Now is a crucial hour**, I guess, to make a good review. It is only in recent times that there is a surge in the desire to understand the merits of our heritage, probably against the background of the economic progress our country is making. It is again in recent times that Western academia, typified by Wendy and Pollock, leading figures no doubt, has vociferously hurled the worst of abuses against our heritage, imputing some of the most heinous motives. The amount of damage the epithets they "adore" our heritage with wreak upon our own younger generation (here and abroad) is not easily undone. Already in our own country, academicians by and large, especially of regional languages, and in most departments of humanities and social sciences are extremely spiteful of our heritage, and would not miss the slightest chance to caricature it, to deride it and abuse it. The news of the loss of a large number of manuscripts from Orissa, recently shared on BVParishad, is only a pointer to the malady, and to the abysmal apathy that abounds all around. Add to this, Pollock and professors of his ilk are brazen enough to make a display of the political axes they have to grind.

  

A system of medicine that does not answer newer illnesses cannot be held in high regard; it cannot be described as a system that is alive and kicking. Until our traditional scholarship can take up the gauntlets thrown by the West, or its agents who have so proliferated, its great strength will not become manifest.

  

I think you have somewhat missed my emphasis. I don't deny that there are hundreds of strong traditional scholars and several more budding scholars seeking to have strong moorings in the tradition. But then, who has to fight the damage that is being dealt - to the psyche of our kids and our society in general ? It is this scholarship that has to fight those forces, and in a manner that **only it can fight** viz. academically.

  

Should the traditional scholarly fraternity be happy with what it is offering now? Far from going on the offensive, we are not even prepared for the defensive. Too few have been alive to the fact that there is even a battle on! It is only now that a growing awareness of this assault is beginning to dawn upon us.

  

  

You speak of scientists who quietly go about their work. But if the work they do is not broadcast by popularisers of science, who have been in such large numbers and have played such large roles, even the tribe of scientists would have languished, gaining little support from the governments and the public. How little does our public know of the academic excellences, or the contents of scholarly output, of giants like NSRamanuja Tatacharya, Prahladacharya, Srivatsankacharya, or even Vineet Chaitanya - to name but a few ! But even more, how many are blessed to know, even among Sanskritists, of how their great academic output *answers the posers* of the vilifiers of our heritage?

  

The need of the hour is of the bridge-builders - who know the purva-paksha too. If one knows only the siddhanta-s (albeit strong ones) against the *purva-paksha-s of bygone ages*, without providing apt replies for the **current** and relevant purva-paksha-s, I think we are missing something vital.

  

If my doctor can administer medicine only to *cAturthika-jvara*, but not to modern day stress syndromes, would it really help me? All that I am saying is that we have to rise to the challenges of the ideas of our times. It is our traditional scholarship that can have answers to it.

  

There is no question of ignoring any deep scholars. It is not claimed by anybody that our deep scholars are being well-provided for; scholars like F W Thomas and Fleet already grieved over a century ago that Sanskrit scholarship was dying! It is towards remedying such situations of non-nourishment of true scholarship that this series of conferences is directed. Apart from the general call for papers, many individual scholars would be invited to contribute their ideas.

  

I hope this clarifies some of the misapprehensions raised.
