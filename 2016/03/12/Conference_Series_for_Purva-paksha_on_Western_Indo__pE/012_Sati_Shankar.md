AdarNiya vidvadjana,

  

Since the proposed conference aims to be a series with wider perspective s its titleConference Series for Purva-paksha on Western Indology 
itself reveals ,channelization of efforts is necessary to keep the path well charted and objective well defined.

  

In the light of this, at the outset we can not say which western Indologist would fit where, as some have been well in news and controversy while other not. We all know that they have their own circuits to spin with well developed technical arsenal, however, having equipped with most modern weapon does not ensure for 100% target hit. 

It is well known that, beginning from Roth, St. Peterburg approach to Geldner.... their trust on their own arsenal has been shaking from colonial arrogance to ... realisation of the fact that semantics can not work in abstraction and "native" element is a must. So long so is for literary side on Western indology. This is certainly not a big problem as trial and error is resorted with scientific methods in natural sciences also and the rationalist-formalist-empiricist controversy goes on.and may be accepted as a healthy sign as methodologies themselves defeat the researcher at times when applied wrongly.

There come malpractices due to strings attached to funding and endowments for Chairs where political and religious bias creeps, partly due to own cultural and religious background of the indologist and partly due to the directives thay receive in occupation,

  

Therefore, while proceeding for the series of conferences, author based, it is pertinent ti keep in mind the broad objectives.. the target we have to hit and the challenges we have to meet.

Dr. Rajiv Malhotra has pointed out such challenges in his Indra'a Net:

\(1\) India's optimum state is balkanization 

\(2\) Colonial Indology's biases were turned into Hinduism

\(3\) Hinduism was manufactured and did not go organically

\(4\) Yogic experience is not a valid path to enlighten and tries to copy western science

\(5\) Wrestern Sicial ethics was incorporated as seva and karma

\(6\) Hinduism had no prior self definition, unity or coherence

\(7\) Hinduism is founded on operession and sustained by it,

\(8\) Hinduism presumes sameness of all religions...

  

Even a rough visit to Pollock's theses, as enumerated in the circular of this proposed conference will confirm inclusion of the above aims in his studies.

Apologise for unsolicited suggestion.

Regards

Sati Shankar
