Dear Prof. Kannan,



To continue the discussion on critical thinking among our youngsters,



You said:

I think you would agree that this is because there is no scope for 'political' ' ideological' inputs in the curriculum of the fields of science and technology and there is such a scope in the streams of humanities and social sciences.



But my observation is that whether in S&T fields or Social Sciences and Humanities,



 Students are not taught



(a) about plagiarism : e.g. students of s&t during their project work, in their project reports, seriously believe that the report is a compilation of various already available portions of texts into one 'essay' or 'book'. They don't knowthat they need to present the finding out of their project through argument, substantiation, referencing etc.


 (b) the reasoning through which the theory has been arrived at:at many places the teacher says, they are just postulates, you have to just accept them as they are and the student follows it blindly.

(c) the intriguing questions that the theory answers/explains etc.



History teaching has been in the form of interesting/absorbing narrations of events. Such teachers are admired by students. Historiography , the method of history is not taught.



These are some examples.



Regards,



Nagaraj
