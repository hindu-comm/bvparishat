Thank you Sri Sati Shankar, for your kind inputs.

  

We must examine every new thesis on grounds of

**(a)** the assumptions made,

**(b)** the logic pursued, and

**(c)** the conclusions reached, plus

**(d)** the way the conclusions are couched/framed. And also,

**(e)** the impact the new thesis will have in academics. And further,

**(f)** the way in which this will be exploited by the NGOs or even governments (state/central/foreign) for the pursuit of certain dishonourable designs.

  

Many of our intellectuals are opening their eyes to methodological issues only lately.

  

And as you rightly pointed out, unless our fundamentals are clear and strong, we will open our mouth only to our own peril, effectively weakening our own case.

  

News is afoot already (*courtesy* meta-indology group) that history texts are sought to be tampered with *once again* in US, in order to suit the nefarious ends.

  

This is when attention and care need to be paid to soundness of thought and correctness of expression.
