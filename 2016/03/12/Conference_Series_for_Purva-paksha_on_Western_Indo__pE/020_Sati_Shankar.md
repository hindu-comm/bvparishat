AdarNiya vidvadjana,

  

Though I had a casual attention on Pollock's writings but this thread prompted me to revisit and reconsider the matter.

As we know, Grand theories have an appeal which lead explorers to take them as final, unless and untill the very foundations of the said theories are scrutinized.

The same approach is needed here and unless we scrutinize the very
methodological foundations based on which Pollock has reached to his interpretations,reviewing and insisting the finished output will be a wastage of time and energy.

  

There are many serious methodological flaws in Pollock's approach, which have been pointed out by many authors and on which he has been silent and that must form the ground to shake the foundation.

Back to fundamentals is the only way for Indian thinkers as other than that they re in better off position buy infrastructure, finance and intellectual army.

  

I think a section on Methodological aspect should be added to the topics list which will overlap all the future conferences.

Regards

Sati Shankar
