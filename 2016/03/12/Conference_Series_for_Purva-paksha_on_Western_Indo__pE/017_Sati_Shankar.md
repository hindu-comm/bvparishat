Yes,  
What has been done and taught so far, be it due to colonial or  
intellectual subordination, has much to be responsible for the  
outcomes which we have seen so far.  
It is never late and in the life of a country half a century is not a  
long time, provided we decide and take necessary steps to correct the  
situation.  
  
So far as training in critical thinking and modern outlook, I have  
found students feeling harassed or bombarded when we enlist subjects  
which they ought to be families to attain ability of modern critical  
thinking.  
Just to keep them consoled with a feeling of light and simultaneously  
introducing them with the core content, i name the subject, "Logic,  
Methodology and Philosophy of Science" and found it acceptable to  
students in wide spectrum... beginning from literature and social  
sciences to Management, Sciences and Technology.  
  
I have seen the impact myself in students, even if they have gone  
through a popularizer level text in this field.  
The beauty of the subject matter is that it pervades all disciplines  
so each and every reader finds it helpful in the understanding of his  
or her main subjects.  
  
Training counts and it will certainly be a significant change if inducted.

Sati Shankar

\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> \* Conference series for Purva-paksha on Western Indology\*  

\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>  
\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> Dear traditional Indian scholar,  
\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>  
\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> Recent times have witnessed many academic/non-academic  
\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> controversies  
\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> related to Western Indology. It is easily discerned that in terms  
\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> of  
\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> quality as well as quantity, the participation of Indian scholarship  
\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> (whose  
\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> heritage it is that is at stake primarily) has been very poor,  
\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> especially  

\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> \*academically\*; this is as against that of the West, equipped as  

\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> it is with an aggressive scholarship backed by funding,  
\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> institutional support, libraries, conferences, journals, etc.  
\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>  
\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> Two of the significant reasons for the current state of Indian  

\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> scholarship are: \*(a)\* the barriers of language (not just ordinary  
\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> English, but specialized jargon), and \*(b)\* the barriers of  

\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> multi-disciplinary approach, wherein Indians are at a disadvantage.  
\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> Various  
\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> circumstances may have contributed to this, but there is no escape  
\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> from the  

\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> necessity of an \*academic handling\* of the issue.  
\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>  
\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> As a \*remedial measure\*, therefore, it is important to consider the  

\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> issues raised by the West one by one, and study their merits and  
\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> demerits  
\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> in a series of conferences dealing with the major contributors to  
\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> the  

\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> field. To begin with, \*four key issues\* raised by Sheldon Pollock  

\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> are taken up. After a lucid and fair statement of the questions  
\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> raised by  
\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> him and their logic as purva-paksha, the uttara-paksha will be  
\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> attempted.  

\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> It is hoped that in this series of conferences - where \*ad hominem  
\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> \*attacks  

\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> will be banned – we develop a responsible and responsive scholarship  
\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> to  
\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> handle the intellectual challenges of our times.  
\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>  
\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> Scholars are invited herewith to go through the attachment and  

\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> kindly respond by \*Sunday, \*\*April \*\*3, 2016\* with an expression
