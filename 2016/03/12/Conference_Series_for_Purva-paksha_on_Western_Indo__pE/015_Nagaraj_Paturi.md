Apart from this intense Purva-paksha activity or even before that activity, what is required at a greater intensity is



1\. training Indian readers, particularly the younger ones, more particularly those staying and studying in India in critical reading and critical thinking: all the 'good boy' / 'good girl' qualities nurtured here, though have their own merits in terms of, say,a help to good family system at the loss of which intensely modernized societies are lamenting, have their flipside in the form of accepting what is taught or published, uncritically, without questioning the logic, without asking for evidencesor sources. (In this aspect, the Indian origin students studying in western countriesare much better equipped thanks to the teaching method there; much of the present rebellion against the western Indology began from the parents of the children who rebelled against what was taught to them about India in their classrooms.)



2\. educating Indian learners, educators,researchers and debaters about the theoretical and methodological tools available in the 'western' (better called'contemporary mainstream') academics itself that helpthem in understanding the Indian materialthrough an approach closer to the insider's perspective. Examples of such tools are : Kant,Kantian ideas of multiple truths, Jungian psychoanalysis, (more precisely analytical psychology), Environmentalist ideas particularly those that challenge absolute objectivity of S&T (e.g. Henryk Skolimowsky) ,



3\. educating Indian learners, educators,researchers and debatersabout the critique of western ideas and modernity from the perspective of Indian tradition done by colonial time Indian intellectualssuch as Swami Vivekananda, Sri Aurobindo, Swami Dayanda Saraswati, etc. Many regional literature writers such as Viswanatha Satyanarayana in Teluguwho did this in their own languages can be introduced through translations. These should beintroduced along with their limitations and scope for improvement in their ideas.



Humbly yours,
