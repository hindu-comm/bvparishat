Nagarajji,

This is a solid point of view. In order to make analytical students we have to also produce analytic research.

Such has been my point of view. Research can very easily be in a "tunnel," on a specific area or a topic or a

word. But the relevance of research to application is where analysis comes into play. Analysis is hard because

it forces an alternate view. Most western work get into difficulty because the "alternate view" gets quickly drawn

without solving the "total" problem. In such situations, it looks "political." A strategy that Indian scholars can take

is to "expand" the problem and operate on a long time scale. Tenure or competition to publish must not be issue,

but pure creativity must be. I suppose it would need Government and social support. 

"tunnel" research was imposed for a number of reasons. Raman rebelled.
Good scholars must.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
