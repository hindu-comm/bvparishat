Dear Dr. Sampadananda,

My papers are published by Dhimahi (from Kerala) and one paper by BORI on Sphota demystified. I may send you a copy of BORI paper. If you can contact officials of DHIMAHI publication (annual), you may find out which issues contain my papers. I am in USA. Sometimes I do not get mail from them, sometimes it get lost. I may send another paper to you soon.



I enjoyed your table of comparison of Sanskrit interrogatives with those from other (Indo-European) languages. Here is question. Lithuanian language appears closer to Sanskrit. Do you have any explanation for that situation? Thanks.
