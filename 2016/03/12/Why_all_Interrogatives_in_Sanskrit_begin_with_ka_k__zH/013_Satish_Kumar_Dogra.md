Dear Shri Shivaraj,  

 My personal opinion is that the difference between written and spoken Tamil arose because of the rigid attitude towards correctness taken by the scholars. Language changes by its own intrinsic force. You cannot stop the changes. Once a group of people insist upon purity of the language, a gap arises between the language used by the scholars and that used by the common man. The spoken Tamil is like the so many dialects of Hindi, such as Haryanavi, Rajasthani etc. It is a distortion of the written. For example, a word like पोकिरीरगला in written becomes पोरींगला in spoken.  
  

Written Tamil is treated as standard Tamil and is used in the speeches on the stage, in discussions in the legislative assembly and on some other formal occasions. Till three decades ago, a large part of the film dialogues also used to be in Written Tamil. Now that the culture of blogs is gaining popularity, youngsters use the spoken version as their written Tamil. Even on stage, many speakers shuttle between the written and the spoken. The local people distinguish these two as Standard Tamil and Colloquial Tamil. The trend towards using spoken Tamil even in magazines is on the increase. A day may come when the spoken version wins out or the two merge.  
  

There is in this perhaps a lesson for the Sanskrit-lovers too. Several versions of Sanskrit are emerging. Some try to follow the ancient models, while others mix Hindi words and use a simpler version of grammar. My personal opinion is that initially we need to maintain a relaxed attitude and encourage the use of Sanskrit even it is not written or spoken in strict accordance with rules. The need of the day is that more and more people should read, write and speak Sanskrit.  
  

Regards,  

Dogra
