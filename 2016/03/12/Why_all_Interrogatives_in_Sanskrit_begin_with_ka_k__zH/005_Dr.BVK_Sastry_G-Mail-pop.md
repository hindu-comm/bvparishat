Namaste



On the question \< why all the interrogative sounds in Sanskrit (कः, का, किम्, कुत्र, कुतः, कथम्, कदा, किमर्थम्, कति, कियत्, क्व ) begin with the sound क (ka)? Is there a logic to this? \> :



Two ways of responding:



**A) Natural Language Way:** The given word of a language has the meaning assigned by the language user community. If the base (
Pratipadika /Sarvanama) started with ‘ Ka’ the grammar process derivatives are most likely to have the same sound continuing in the same meaning !



 Will this be a universal rule, even within Samskrutham ?
Certainly not ! Take the processing of the word ‘Asmat ( I) and Yushmat (you) ’- where the derived words do not always begin with ‘a’ or ‘yu’ ! 





**B) Technical way, which may be interpreted as ‘Forced’ Or ‘ Mystic’ !** : - Samskruth language is unique with the spiritual inquiry / enquiry on ‘Kam’ (= Brahma) and ‘Kham’ (= Brahma).

The primary focus of ‘Questioning’ is visioned in ‘Kasmai Devaya Havishaa vidhema’ – For Whom, For Which Divine, For which benefit - shall we propitiate ?

The primary debate is ‘KoyamAtmeti Vayam upAsmahe’ ? before giving a conclusion !





The explanation \< क (ka), phonetically, is the first consonantal sound, not just of Sanskrit but of the entire humanity. \> is fine as long as one is focused on \< Human Voice mechanism and normal
articulation process’. But why \<rest of the humanity speaking with
non-Sanskrit languages had different words for expressing
interrogation \> needs to be further investigated.
