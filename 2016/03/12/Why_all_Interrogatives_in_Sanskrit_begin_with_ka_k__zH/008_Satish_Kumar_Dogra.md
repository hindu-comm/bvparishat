Mishra Ji,  

 Such tracing of sounds is often very tricky, and one doesn't know how far one can take these as true history and how much of it is intelligent guess-work.  
  

For instance, in Tamil (for that is the only South Indian language I know, but I know others are similar), the word இந்த (intha) which means 'this' could have come from इदम्. and then this same word could have given rise to the questions by a slight modification of the first sound from இந்த (inth) meaning this to எந்த (entha) meaning which. Then the word 'entha' could have given the other question words.  
  

All this sounds logical, but where is the proof? In fact, if you go to some of the scholarly Tamil groups, you find people constantly trying to show how all languages including Sanskrit derived from Tamil. This type of one-upmanship among languages tends to take away the scientific research orientation from historical linguistics.  
  

But what is undeniable and a good takeaway from this discussion is that there are patterns in languages that need to be discovered and studied for their functionality in making a language effective as a system of communication. I did such a study in Tamil although I did not publish it. There are interesting ways in which written Tamil changes into spoken Tamil. I do not know how much Tamil you know. There is a word ஆச்சு (aachchu) which is the spoken version of the written word ஆயிற்று (aayittru) and there is a word வந்தாச்சு (vanthaachchu) which is the spoken version of வந்து ஆயிற்று (vantha aayittru) which literally means 'the act of coming has happened'. There are many such expressions where even the native speakers who are not linguists are not aware of how the written and the spoken relate to each other.
