If god wishes, he will bring me to India in near future, I will then visit your organization and show you PPT presentations. I received many invitations from different parts of India. Now in USA Hindu temples are increasing day by day. They also would like to see PPT. Let us pray the god. He is Yogeshwara. Thanks for your interest. N.R.Joshi
