Subject: Re: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Why all Interrogatives in Sanskrit begin with क ka

Dear Sampad and friends,

We are also looking into it. It appears neurological for the precise reasons you have mentioned.

The connection could be how the sounds form as the infant grows. The "ka" sound could be the

first effect on the infant on the "awareness" of the external universe.
The "ka" is adopted in the

meaning of the universe in older languages. The transition of "awareness" to "interrogation" is

the formation of speech that tries to interpret the awareness. This research is new. I would

have more to say in a year.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
