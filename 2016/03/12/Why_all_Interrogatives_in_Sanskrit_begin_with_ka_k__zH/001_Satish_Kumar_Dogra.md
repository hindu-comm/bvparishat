Mishra Ji,  

 What you say points to one thing: most languages focus on one particular sound as the starting sound for question words. To say that this sound is 'k' in all languages may not be correct. In English it is 'wh' in Tamil it is 'எ' E.g எப்படி (eppadi - how) எப்பொழுது (eppozhuthu - when) என்ன (enn - what) எதற்கு (etharku - what for) எங்கே (enge - where) எவ்வாறு (evvaaru - in what manner) எது (ethu - which one) etc. Interestingly the word for 'why' is ஏன் (prnounced yein) which is the दीर्घ ए instead of the ह्रस्व ए of the other question-formers.  
  

But your observation certainly is significant, because it points out an important feature that almost all languages use one particular sound as a question-marker. Perhaps the first users of languages found one type of articulation easier. In Tamil the sound 'e' involved just the opening of the mouth. In English, 'wh' involved just opening the lips. And in Sanskrit, 'k' required the removing of the block of the vocal cavity.
