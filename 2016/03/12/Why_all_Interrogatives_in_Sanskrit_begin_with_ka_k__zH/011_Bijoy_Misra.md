Phonetics as a science is in its infancy. There is not much work on the Indian languages.

There are empirical observations that all world languages could have a common origin

and they distort sounds with migration. On has to be extremely analytic on these

investigations. If you go to South East Asia, you would see many words sound differently.

While a primitive language was possibly created from the first principles, the rest imitate

by hearing. So you may make efforts to discover what that primitive language was

in case you appreciate the hypothesis. It most likely was in India.

I must add that the western linguistics does not want to acknowledge an origin.

But it also does not have a theory on the evolution. You may read the paper

I posted in a different thread.
