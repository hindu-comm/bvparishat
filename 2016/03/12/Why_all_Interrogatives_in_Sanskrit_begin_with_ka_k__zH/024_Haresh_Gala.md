Namaste,  
  

May be off-the current discussion in some way and Still important from VARNAMALA point of View  

My friend WIM has worked on how ( may be ) Roman/Greek script could have been derived from our Ancient Script Structure  

Attached two photos of Front and one inner chart  
  

Book is available online for purchase  
  

I'm also Interested in VARANAMALA theories from Everybody, If Possible please do share here in group
