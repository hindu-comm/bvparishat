Hare Krishna.  
Dear Dr.Sampadanandaji,  
  
Interesting explanation and observation. I never thought before in these lines.  
  
I seek one clarification. It is not only 'ka' that is produced from  
obstructing air at this position (kantha); 'kha', 'ga', and 'gha' are  
also produced from the same place isn't it?  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
