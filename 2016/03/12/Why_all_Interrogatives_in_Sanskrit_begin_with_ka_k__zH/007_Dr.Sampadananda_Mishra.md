Dear Satish ji,  
with regard to English 'wh' I gathered following information from Wiki source: What is now English ⟨wh⟩ originated as the Proto-Indo-European consonant \*kʷ (whose reflexes came to be written ⟨qu⟩ in Latin and the Romance languages). In the Germanic languages, in accordance with Grimm's Law, Indo-European voiceless stops became voiceless fricatives in most environments. Thus the labialized velar stop \*kʷ initially became presumably a labialized velar fricative \*xʷ in pre-Proto-Germanic, then probably becoming \*\[ʍ\] – a voiceless labio-velar approximant – in Proto-Germanic proper. The sound was used in Gothic and represented by the symbol known as hwair; in Old English it was spelled as ⟨hw⟩. The spelling was changed to ⟨wh⟩ in Middle English, but the pronunciation remained \[ʍ\].  
  
Because Proto-Indo-European interrogative words typically began with \*kʷ, English interrogative words (such as who, which, what, when, where) typically begin with ⟨wh⟩ ...  
  
With regard to the South Indian languages I am yet to get some insights...
