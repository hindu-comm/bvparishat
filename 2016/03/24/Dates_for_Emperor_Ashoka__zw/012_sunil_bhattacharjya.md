Dear Tapatiji,  
  

The use of "devAnAmprihah" (in the prakrtized form "devAnAmpiyo") has been there from much before the Guptas. In his book "Asoka (Gaekwad Lectures) pp.109-10 (1928), Prof. Radhakumud Mookerji had discussed the changes in the meaning of "devAnAmpriyah" from the time of the grammarian Panini to the time of Katyayana and Patanjali and then to the time of Bhattojidikshita. I understand that the Shukla Yajurveda has the word(s) "priyam devAnAm".  
  
We really do not know how many of the Asokan inscriptions were from the time of Ashoka Maurya and and how many of them are from the time of
Ashokadtya (Samudragupta). To my knowledge the name "Ashoka" has been found in only two of the inscriptons  
  
My understanding is that the Guptas were following Hindu customs.  
But Chandragupta (father of samudragupta) is reported to have accepted Jainism towards the end of his life and became an ascetic. I believe Samudragupta performed An Ashwamedha yajna. Saudragupta, who assumed the name Asokaditya, could have got converted to Buddhism only after the Kalinga war. I think the need for further research in this area cannot be ruled out.
