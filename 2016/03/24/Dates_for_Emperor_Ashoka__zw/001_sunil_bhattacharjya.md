Dear Bijoyji,  
  

I agree that Prof. Aklujkar had made a few valid points and I have a few observations on some of those (starting from your last point upwards), as follows:  
  

The resources like governmental / institutional support should be made available for working on the key milestones of ancient Indian history, so that the dates, such as of the Mahabharata war, of Lord Buddha, of Kanishka, of Ashoka Maurya, of Adi Shankaracharya, of Panini / Katyayana / Patanjalis / Bhartrhari/ Udayana (the logician), of Kalidasas and of a few others are resolved from all angles and settled beyond dispute.  
  

Secondly the accounts such as of Alberuni have to be given due crthe edit and not dumped the way the modern historians have been doing. For example, Alberuni told us that Buddhism prevailed in Persia before Zarathustra promulgated his doctrine, and that itself means that the 5th / 6th date of Lord Buddha as supported by the modern historians, is not correct.  
  

Even the linguists seem to have not asserted their views, as they were not confident enough to oppose the modern historians. The Magadhi-Prakrit, which was in use in the times of Lord Buddha became the language that nurtured (became Paalak of) the Buddhist literature (other than the Mahayana / Sravastivada literature) and hence came to be called Pali. This Magadhi-Prakrit evolved over the centuries into Ardha-magadhi, which was used for the teachings of Lord Mahavira, who lived in the 6th century BCE. On being questioned, some linguists took the comfortable but a strange stance that both the Pali and the Ardha-Magadhi prevailed side-by-side, in the times of Lord Mahavira.  
  

For the dating of the Mahabharata war, the many data given by the Vishala-buddhi Vedavyasa has proved to be too vishala for the modern scholars, who in the name of being critical had not been able to look at the astrological and the ritualistic inputs of the Mahabharata times in that text.  
  

As regards the date of Adi Shankaracharya too, the dating of the king Sudhanva (probably a Somavamshi king belonging to the Chahamana Rajput clan) would help. The "Rane" sect of Maharashtra claim that they are the descendents of king Sudhanva and that they moved to Maharashtra after the demise of Rana Pratap.. Sudhanva's inscription, was last known to have been borrowed by a Dewan in Gujarat, and nobody since then
claimed to have seen that. Correct dating Udayana will also help as Adi Shankaracharya had debate with Uadayana and moreover Udayana was a friend of Amaruka, who has been mentioned in Shankara-Vijayas.  
  

There are are a lot of such leads for the open-minded scholars and here I have indicated only a few.  
  

Thanks
