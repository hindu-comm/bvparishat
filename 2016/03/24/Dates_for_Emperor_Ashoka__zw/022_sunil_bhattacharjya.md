Dear Vidyasankarji,  
  

You will agree that in a mail no comprehensive treatment is possible and I also do not expect you to change your views by just reading one mail from me. Further what you responded to was the second mail and it appears that you could not read the contents of my earlier mail, which I have referred to in the previous mail. I am giving below the contents of the earler mail, for your kind perusal

Dear Vidyasankarji,  
  

Please permit me to reiterate my earlier stand that the need for further research in ancient Indian history cannot ruled out, yet I welcome your query. With my limited resources, without any institutional support, and that too the age being on the wrong side, let me share with you whatever I understand on the topi\[.  

  

There are some pointers in the direction that the Kalinga war could have been during the times of Ashokaditya. The Guptas were following HIndu customs, but due to serious succession issues at the old age of Chandragupta (of the Gupta dynasty), a frustrated Chandragupta left (could have been dislodged from kingship by his own son) his kingdom and he became a Jaina ascetic and went away to Karnataka. Some say that Chandragupta was unhappy as there was a great famine during his regime and that made him become am ascetic and starve himself to death ( following the Jaina custom) to atone for his failure to avert the famine during his reign. Samudragupta came out unscathed in the succession struggle and became the king. He performed the Ashwamedha. As the purana writes, he was "vigatAshoka" \[one who could overcome the sadness (of the succession struggle), with his mother giving him full support all along\] and he was conferred the epitaph "Ashokaditya". Samrat Ashokadiya went on to make a big empire and became a sarvabhauma Samrat.

  
  
As regards Kalinga, it was independent during the times of the Kalingan king Khravela, who was a contemporary of the Satavahanas (the predecessors of the Guptas). Kharavela, could recover and bring back some of the relics of Lord Buddha, which was taken to Magadha during the times of Nanda. That, to my mind, may mean that Ashoka Maurya did nor have suzerainty over Kalinga and it was Ashokaditya who conquered Kalinga after a bloody war. The Ashokan legends (The Ashokavadana) mentions about one of Ashoka's wives Karuvaki and one inscription, to my knowledge, was made in her name. There is also the Orissan legend that even after Kalinga was routed by Ashoka , the beautiful and proud Kalingan princess Karuvaki did not surrender. She accepted Ashokaditya only after he got himself converted to Buddhism.  
  

The ancient indian chronology is a very dear subject to me. The Puranas (much despised and derogated by the western scholars) have given us the correct antiquity and also said that history is important for dharma. The Vayu purana says as follows, in its 103rd chapter. .  
  
इतिहासमिमं श्रुत्वा धर्माय विद्धे (द्धते) मतिम् ।  
  

I hope the dharma-gurus will also support the efforts towards rectification of the distortions in the ancient Indian history.

As regards, Prof. Aklujkar's forthcoming paper, I am also looking forward to reading that, as I am nowhere near him in knowledge,
scholarship and standing and I should have a lot to learn from him.
