Dear All

Want to restate what Prof Varakhedi said [BVP.man...@gmail.com]() is the list moderator which will be used for moderation. All mails not from this ID should be considered to be written as a member writing to this list. This is done with intention to avoid confusion if a mail has been written as a list moderator or as a member.
