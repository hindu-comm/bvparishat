Dear Vidyasankakrji,  
  

This is further to my previous mail on this point. You appear to be keenly interested in finding the solution to the controversy of two Ashokas.  
  

In addition to what I wrote in my mail I wish to add that Kautilya's Arthashastra (2.10.4) recommends some kind of format (giving the essential details to be part of every such format) for king's proclamations / announcements / decrees and I think any Maurya regime was expected to follow that norm. But these formalities seem to be missing from the Ashokan edicts (may not be from all the edicts). That may even suggest that most of the Ashokan edicts could have been of Ashokaditya in the 3rd century BCE.  
  

Moreover two inscriptions have the name "Ashok" mentioned there, which is missing in the other inscriptions.  
  

Awaiting response from you and other scholars.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil Bhattacharjya
