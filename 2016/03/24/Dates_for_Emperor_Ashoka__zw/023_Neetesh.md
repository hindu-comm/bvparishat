Dear all,

  

Pranam,  

  

Though i am not qualified to comment on the research and topic being discussed, i thoroughly believe that Indian history was poisoned by Britishers and loads of documents were destroyed by Mughals, following link from Ajit vadakayil [blogspot.com](http://blogspot.com) indicates that Ashoka did not exist ever and was created,

I hope the info in this link may be useful and dignitaries in this group may come to some sound conclusion with evidence for understanding of common people like me..

  

Best Regards  
Neetesh Sahu
