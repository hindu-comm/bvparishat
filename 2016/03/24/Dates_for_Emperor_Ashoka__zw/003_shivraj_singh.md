4.  Association of  
Chandragupta to Greek records might not be  
fool-proof.  

======  
Shivraj: The "accepted norm" is that ashok communicated with some kings from the west and those western kings are firmly dated.  
  
Some on this list have loudly proclaimed that it was the gupt dynasty ashok who communicated with these western kings. When challenged these individuals ask you to read the purans. In other words they don't give any evidence for their claims. So you have no choice but to reject such claims.

Bijoy:  

5\.  Al Beruni's India contains information for finding the dates.  

=========  
Shivraj: Al-beruni in 1000 AD or so just wrote gossip.He asked people and put it in his tome. Gives almost no original sources. His data is of little use for reconstructing indian history.  
His usefulness is in what he saw first hand and recorded.
