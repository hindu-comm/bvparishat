Dear Tapati,  
Thanks for sending the paper. It is a very amateurish attempt and hardly scholarly. For example the paper makes the claim that Samudragupt is Ashokaditya but gives no reference for the same. The author of the paper has said on this very list that this gupt Ashokaditya equation is coming from Purans but to this day he has not provided a reference.  
  
I do not understand how this author can continue to make false statements?  
  
Best Wishes,

Respected  
scholars,There are a vast number of research work on  

this issue. A study of them would help us to arrive some  
solution. I am sending an interesting paper which will  
clarify the issue to some extent. Other related papers will  
take some time.Regards.

Shivraj,  
  
The very fact that Rajatarangini gives  
the date of Kanishka in 13th century BCE has already settled  
the issue. More so as the astronomical studies also  
confirmed that. Then the other evidences automatically fall  
in line. If you think that Ashoka Maurya lived in the 4th  
century BCE, you can very well continue to do so.  
  
Samazdaro ke liye ishara  
hi kafi hai.
