Dear Sunilji,

  

I'm interested in the problem inasmuch as it has deep bearing on all of Indian history. However, I don't think that calling it a controversy helps any development of our knowledge about it and I don't think I'm equipped to find a solution for it. I don't think random speculations about the identities and timelines of various Maurya and Gupta kings helps the process of finding a solution. I would much rather look at fresh analyses of original data and I look forward to reading Prof. Aklujkar's forthcoming publications on the problem, along with the other associated literature.

  

Best regards,

Vidyasankar
