Dear Sunilji,

  

You wrote: "Saudragupta, who assumed the name Asokaditya, could have got converted to Buddhism only after the Kalinga war. I think the need for further research in this area cannot be ruled out."

  

I take that you are claiming that the Kalinga war was fought not by Asoka of the Maurya dynasty but by Samudragupta of the Gupta dynasty. Is there any evidence on which you base this statement?

  

If so, what should be the interpretation of the Asokan rock edict that expresses great regret over the Kalinga war and the violence inflicted upon its people? Would you say that both the carving of this edict was commissioned and the feeling of remorse over the war was expressed by Samudragupta, not by Asoka Maurya? If so, on what grounds?

  

Best regards,

Vidyasankar
