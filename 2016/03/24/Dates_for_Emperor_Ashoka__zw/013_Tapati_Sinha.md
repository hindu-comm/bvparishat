Dear Sunilji,

Thank you very much for the data provided by you.

After cross-checking few more articles including yours, now the challenge is to confirm the identity of Chandragupta Maurya. We have the inscriptions written in Pre-Gupta Brahmi and early Khorosthi and also the dynastical lineage described in the Puranas. Also a good number of coins of different indigenous states.

Hope with a fresh mind and the scientific tools presently available, a new approach towards Indian hist. will divulge a different past.
