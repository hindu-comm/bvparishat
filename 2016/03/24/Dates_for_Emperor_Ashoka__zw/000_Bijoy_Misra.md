Friends,

  

Prof Ashok Aklujkar and his wife Vidyut Aklujkar visited Boston last week in connection with

Annual Meeting of the American Oriental Society. We arranged a lecture at the local

Massachusetts Institute of Technology last Saturday evening.. He spoke about dating Ashoka

from the available evidence. It was a tutorial for me to learn how the dating the Indian history

has been extrapolated with serious flaws. Regarding Emperor Ashoka's dates, his observation

was based on five key points:

  

1. Most inscriptions are in odd locations and would unlikely to appear as royal decrees

  as has been postulated.

  

2. The writings are dissimilar and should be interpreted as post-Ashoka.

  

3\. "devAanam priyah" is a phrase normally associated as a post-death salutation.

  

4\.  Association of Chandragupta to Greek records might not be fool-proof.

  

5\.  Al Beruni's India contains information for finding the dates.

  

His conclusion was Ashoka's dates could go back at least five hundred years than what is

currently accepted. I have asked a colleague to create a report. I will post when ready.

  

I am reminded of a discussion here on dating the Buddha at 1800 BC. I would request the

knowledgeable people to throw further light and help create a line of research. The Government

must support efforts in documenting history as it is getting into the promotion of Sanskrit

language.

  

Thank you.
