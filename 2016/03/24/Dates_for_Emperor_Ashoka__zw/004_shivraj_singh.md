Secondly the accounts such as of Alberuni have to be  
given due crthe edit and not dumped the way the modern  
historians have been doing. For example, Alberuni told us  
that Buddhism prevailed in Persia before Zarathustra  
promulgated his doctrine, and that itself means that the 5th  
/ 6th date of Lord Buddha as supported by the modern  
historians, is not correct.  

=====  
Shivraj: How can we believe al-beruni? Did he give you a source for this? Alberuni lived in 1000AD and what he says about Buddha and Zarathushtra is hearsay/gossip.  
Let me remind you that history is based on sources and not wild imagination like the identity of King Ashok who communicated with western kings debate we have had.

Sunil:  

As regards the date of Adi Shankaracharya too, the  
dating of the king Sudhanva (probably a Somavamshi king  
belonging to the Chahamana Rajput clan) would help. The  
"Rane" sect of Maharashtra claim that they are the  
descendents of king Sudhanva and that they moved to  
Maharashtra after the demise of Rana Pratap..  

=======  
Shivraj: As an Indian we have to be a bit more careful here. Rana Pratap was a Suryavanshi belonging to Guhilot/Sisodia lineage of Rajputs. Rane is just a corruption of the word Rana. If they claim descent from Rana Pratap (even Shivaji's family was descended from the Grand Sire of Rana Pratap: Rana Hamir's brothers) then they cannot be somvanshi.
