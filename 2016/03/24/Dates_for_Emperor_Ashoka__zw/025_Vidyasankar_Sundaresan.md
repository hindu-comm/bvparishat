In fact, I will go one step further and assert thatAjit Vadakayil's blog postsare completely unreliable sources. At best, they can give readers a few laughs over the good old game ofconspiracy theories. For this forum to be a Parishat for Vidvat, could we all please learn to recognize what is vidvat and what isn't?
