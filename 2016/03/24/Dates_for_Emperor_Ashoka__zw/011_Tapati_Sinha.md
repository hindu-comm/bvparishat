Respected scholars,

A lot of controversial discussions are going on the chronology of Indian history, not today but since prolonged years. Scholars have come up with their views on the research they have done and I appreciate the brilliant work of Dr. Sunil Bhattacharya. We all have limited knowledge; to have a confirmed date of Ashoka, we do not have any archaeological evidence except the inscriptions which were issued by "devanam piyo".

The above article is based mostly on literary and astronomical evidences. It has proved some points beyond doubt. 

  

But one problem remained unsolved; I would like to point out that the script in so called Ashokan inscriptions are epigraphically much older than the Gupta script. So "devanam piyo" epithet can not be attributed to the Gupta period. 

Comments are welcome from learned scholars.
