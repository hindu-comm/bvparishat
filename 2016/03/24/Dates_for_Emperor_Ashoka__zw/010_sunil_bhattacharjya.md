Dear Tapatiji,  
  

Thank you for attaching my paper. I attached that paper more than once before, in my mail to BVP. I knew long back that Shivraj had either did not read my paper or if read at all, he had not understood the paper. It could also be that Shivraj does not think that there has been any distortion in ancient Indian history during the colonial period. Just because I did not spoon-feed him where in the Purana, the king
Samudragupta has been called Ashokaditya, he thinks that no other evidence, not even the dating of Kanishka in the 13th century BCE, can change his view that Chandargupta Maurya lived in the 4th century BCE.
Dr. Narahari Achar also found from his astronomical studies that Kanishka indeed lived in the 13th century BCE and he had given reference to my paper on Dotted Record in his paper.  

  
I am sure the scholars of this group and elsewhere understand that in a paper presented in a conference, no comprehensive treatment of any subject is possible. That is why I have addressed in my paper on "Dotted Record" several of the serious distortions in the ancient Indian chronology, during the colonial period and gave mainly the essential details.  
  

Best,
