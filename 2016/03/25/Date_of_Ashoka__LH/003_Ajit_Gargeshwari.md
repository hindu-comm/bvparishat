“Later on I discovered that BVP is converting to be an activist forum.

There are a lot of noisy people. It is good that you stopped it.”



I never knew BVP is an activist forum. Can you show me any document from The list owners or from The moderators team its one. Who are The noisy people? Who stopped whom? I did not understand.
