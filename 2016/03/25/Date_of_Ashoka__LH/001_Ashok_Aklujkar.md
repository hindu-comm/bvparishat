As we go back in history, the number of pieces of evidence generally goes down. In such a situation, it is better to suggest a ’not later than’ type of date and be content with providing an overall chronological frame than to be over-speculative and suggest a particular year or century.

  

In the current state of research, I would not go beyond suggesting ca. 800 B.C. as a date for Aśoka.

  

At present, it would be inconvenient for me to continue this discussion. Pl wait until I publish an essay on this issue. Perhaps, it would have been better if Prof. Misra had not given a summary of what I said.
