A limited audio sample of the first adhyaya traditionally recited by Sri Malola Kannan in एकश्रुति is available here-  

<http://goo.gl/QaW17o>

  

(Correction: The earlier mentioned kandaas with gaanam are in the 1.12 and 2.24 kandaas; theses sections are not included in this audio sample)

  

Hope this helps.

  

Regards,

-Shreyas
