The texts that don't have accents preserved in manuscripts, nor a live, active recitation tradition, can be read like any other text. Verse texts like kaTha and SvetASvatara are read and recited like the gItA, for example. For the sAmaveda upanishats, there is no sAmagAna associated, because they are part of the brAhmaNa texts, not mantra. If at all there were ancient standard methods of reciting the chAndogya and kena texts, they've been long lost.

Best regards,
