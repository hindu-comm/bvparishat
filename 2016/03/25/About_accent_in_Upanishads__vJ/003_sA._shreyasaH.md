Dear Sri Vidyasankar,



नमस्ते.

  

A couple of corrections-

1.   The छान्दोग्योपनिषत् does indeed have a live and active recitation and teaching traditions in several Mutts and Pathasalas in Dakshin Bharath. I know quite a few of the adhyapakas personally who recite theछ.उ.Veda Parayanam at Mutts.



2.  गानम् (सस्वरम्) in the छ.उ. are recited at Sections 2.12.5,
3.24.(5,9, 12,14) with हस्त-चालनम् consistent with the Samhita. The svara-markings are printed in the title published by Sri Govinda Dikshitar Raja Veda Patashala, Kumbakonam. Other publications have indeed omitted these svara-markings.



In response to to Sri Ujjwal’s question, even withtraditionalअनूच्चारणम् practice under a teacher, some sections of this Upanishat which are in गद्यम् and without स्वरम् are relatively harder to recite; my suggestion based on personal experience is to mark out the पदच्छेदम् where required.



Regards,

-Shreyas
