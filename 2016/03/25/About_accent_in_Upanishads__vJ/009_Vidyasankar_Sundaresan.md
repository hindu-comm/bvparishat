The analogy is this. I am not equating gAna in sAma with vikRti modes in Rg-yajus, but pointing to what their presence or absence tells us about the nature of the texts and traditional expectations about their recitation. In the Rgveda and yajurveda, only the mantra texts have vikRti pAThas, not the brAhmaNa texts. In the sAmaveda, only the mantras have gAna, not the brAhmaNa portions. In the middle of brAhmaNa texts, some mantras are quoted in Rk-sAma-yajus. The vikRti modes for two sources and gAna for the third that are recited for these small portions are functions of their mantra character, irrespective of whether or not they are officially found in the text named as the samhitA of the corresponding Veda. The general conclusion remains that recitation of the brAhmaNa texts (and therefore the Upanishads as well, except the ISAvAsya) operates in a very different manner and context than that of the mantra texts.

Even in an upanishat text with a widespread and strong recitation tradition like the taittirIya, you may have noticed that the tones employed do not conform to prAtiSAkhya and SikshA rules about the application of svarita and pracaya.

Best regards,
