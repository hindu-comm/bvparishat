Oh, I didn't read this clarification on the text numbering before responding to your first note. 1.12.5 and the portions in 2.24 are quotations of sAma mantras within the upanishat text, so it makes sense that the gAna for these are preserved.

It is analogous to the situation in the taittirIya mahAnArAyaNopanishat, where a few lines like mayi medhAm ... bhrAjo dadhAtu have vikRti pAThas, because they are mantra sentences, but the bulk of the same text does not have any tradition of vikRtis being rendered.

Best regards,
