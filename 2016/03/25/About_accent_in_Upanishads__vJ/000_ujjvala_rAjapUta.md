Some Upanishads have accent marks while others don't. I know how to read (recite) those with accent marks. But how does one read those that don't have accent marks. I searched on Youtube for Upanishad recitals but could not make sure that they are authentic (according to the tradition). With the parts that are in पद्य, I can still manage to recite in some way or the other, but I am totally confused about how to read prose from Upanishads without accent marks.
