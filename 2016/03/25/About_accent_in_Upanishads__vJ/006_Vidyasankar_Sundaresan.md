Dear Sir Shreyae,

Thanks for the additional information. It is good to know this. However, I didn't mean to say that there is no active recitation tradition for the sAmopanishats. I meant that we don't have sAmagAna for the whole text the way we have for the mantra portions, because the brAhmaNa texts were never designed to have gAna in the first place. For that matter, even in strongly preserved recitation traditions like the taittirIya, the rules used for samhitA recitation don't really apply to the upanishat chapters. And we don't construct/recite various vikRti pAThas for these texts either. We do them only for the mantra portions.

That apart, it looks like you are following a different numbering for the chAndogya? I'm puzzled by the numbers 2.12.5 and 3.24. In my references, 2.12.2 is followed by 2.13.1 and 3.19 is followed by 4.1.

Best regards,  
Vidyasankar
