Hello Mr. Krishna,  
  

You can search for synonyms, according to the famous thesaurus Amarakosha through this [link.](http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/scl/amarakosha/frame.html)  
  

You can also use the Gaveshikaa - the only search engine for Sanskrit through this [link](http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in:8080/searchengine/index1.jsp) from which you can locate the occurrences of a particular noun or verb in many texts.  

  

Hope this will help.  

Thank you.
