Namaste

  

1\. The exchange of mails is turning out from ' kurukshetra of Sanskrit' to ' personal acrimonious attacks at the individual warrior levels with different skill sets and focus'. The war on principal issue is turning to personality focussed attack. This is not in good taste or final interest.

  

Surely both are not i-pods or machines or cyborgs churning out stock responses. The emotions need not turn to cyber- entertainment of in house fight.

  

2\. Personally i have long association with Shatavadhani Ganesh and has very high regard for his scholarship, spirituality and unquestionable commitment to the cause of Sanatana Dharma and Samskrutham. His way of 'immortalizing the language' is through demonstration of skills and art of language and literature- exactly the way followed in tradition by Valmiki, Vyasa, Kalidasa and the like. A language which creates living literature can never be ' dead'. And a language which connects human to Divine can only be ' language of Gods'. For this, reading the inaccurate writings of SP is not a necessity!

  

Rajiv ji has his action field cut out with a focus as IK- pointing to the attack areas and exposing the back-trap doors used for damaging and demolishing the Dharmic traditions by deconstructing its language, text and texture. It is a highly commendable global effort and needs to be taken note of by traditional scholars for their own survival snd safe passage through times.

  

3\. May be the Shatavadhani Ganeshs review of TBFS gets a focussed forum discussion in a face to face mode, moderated well and points are sorted out.

  

I am sure there are convergent and concurrent views to which both can arrive at through discussions.

  

This Could avoid lot of unwanted ' linen-wash in cyber space'.

  

Only a suggestion, if considered palatable and reasonable.

  

Regards
