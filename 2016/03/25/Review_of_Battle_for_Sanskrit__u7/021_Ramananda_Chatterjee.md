you are taking hasty judgments without reading primary sources of Sanskrit texts and relying on secondary sources.

Ironically it applies back to you.

Western idiom is not rocket science and our Scholar even understood the Rocket science very well

Your response is waste unless you understand and exposed to traditional texts

There is nothing big deal to understand incorrectly. Reading book your book is a big waste of time

You think it is not important

Again a big waste of time for readers to read your article

Hold your tongue. He has least memory. He has just an associative memory like all of us. But at least has spent his 40 years in reading the texts. I have listened every discourse of him. There would be abhipraya bheda but not that he has not understand the texts or tradition. He has answers for all his belives and understandings. Of course Abhipraya differs, it was even with all Bhashya karas

You are not eligible unless you are wearing Indian traditional shoes. You are doing this for your NAME and PUBLICITY.  

Now don't say you have not understood ME.

Just NAME NAME NAME FAME FAME FAME/ not Yajna and all  
  

Don't think you have woken up traditional scholars. People like Ashok Aklujkar, R Shankar , Prof Pandurangi, etc even a student knew what you have all written. Writing Battle of Sanskrit is not the solution. We knew the problems. You did not put in proper way and the result is Battle of Sanskrit finally getting name NOT by Sanskrit scholars. But So Called NOT VERIFYING HABIT IIT Prof-who getting scolded by Rohan baby finally. It's IMPACT of your book.
