Friends,

  

I also did a review that came out in our local news magazine today.

My view is that of an immigrant parent and an educator who takes

interest in Sanskrit and Indian Studies for gaining knowledge and

maintaining tradition. My concern as I have stated before is

regarding the reading material for our children. Immigration was

easy, but then it is a "wild west" here! I assume the children in

India are also not so lucky. A big revision is needed. 

Here is my review:
