Rajiv,

  

Sri Ganesh is not contesting your analysis of Prof Pollock. He would like more thorough

study of the texts to create interpretation of the terms. The west is sloppy in this through

massive generalizations. It would help if you both may come together to create a technical

document for our youth and people like me. Sri Ganesh appreciates that the generalizations

must be challenged. What I agree with him is that new scholarly analytic work also must

be produced. He appears as a good bilingual. I think valuable contributions can be

anticipated through mutual collaboration. As much I admire your investigative work,

I admire Sri Ganesh's erudition and diligent devotion to Indian scholarship.

  

I think I have said enough.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
