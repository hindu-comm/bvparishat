I read your review and I would like to point out one big error w.r.t Akbar. The truth is this:

  

Akbar's reign was chronicled extensively by his court historian [Abul Fazal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu%27l-Fazl_ibn_Mubarak "Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak") in the books *Akbarnama* and *Ain-i-akbari*. Fazal gave a positive [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_doctor "Spin doctor") to Akbar's reign by glossing over uncomfortable facts of the emperor's reign related to his interaction with other communities of his empire, which has been repeated by numerous historians over the years. Other contemporary sources of Akbar's reign like the works of Badayuni, Shaikhzada Rashidi and Shaikh Ahmed Sirhindi were written outside of court influence and hence contain more authentic information and less flattery for Akbar. Historian [Vincent A. Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Arthur_Smith "Vincent Arthur Smith") concludes:

> 
> > Injudicious flatterers of Akbar have printed much canting nonsense > about his supposed desire to do good to the conquered peoples by his > annexations.^([\[43\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-43)) >

### Rajput Wives of Akbar

Akbar persuaded the [Kacchwaha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kacchwaha "Kacchwaha") [Rajput](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajput "Rajput"), Raja [Bharmal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharmal "Bharmal"), of [Amer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber,_India "Amber, India") (modern day [Jaipur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaipur "Jaipur")) into accepting a matrimonial alliance for his daughter Harka Bai. This marriage proved to be a turning point in the history of the Mughal empire, as this was the first instance of royal matrimony between Hindu and [Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim "Muslim") [dynasties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasty "Dynasty") in [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India"). Harka Bai was rechristened [Mariam-uz-zamani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariam-uz-Zamani "Mariam-uz-Zamani"). After her marriage she was treated as an outcaste by her family and in the 61 years of married life she never visited [Amer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amer "Amer")/[Jaipur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaipur "Jaipur").^([\[44\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-Nath_397-44)) Her position in the Mughal household was not of much importance because she was not assigned any significant place either in [Agra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agra "Agra") or [Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi "Delhi"). Instead she was assigned a small village of Barah near Bayana in the [Bharatpur district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatpur_district "Bharatpur district") where she passed her time till her death.^([\[44\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-Nath_397-44)) She died in 1623 and her tomb is near Agra.^([\[45\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-45)) As a custom Hindus were cremated and never buried. Her burial signifies she converted to Islam after marriage.

> > Rajput ladies who entered the Delhi royal harem became Muslims and > were buried in Muslim cemeteries, they could no longer visit their > parents' houses or dine with > them.^([\[46\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-jadu_38-46)) >
> 

Subsequently a mosque was built in her honor by [Jahangir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahangir "Jahangir") in [Lahore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore "Lahore"), [Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan "Pakistan") which is called Mariam-uz-zamani mosque.^([\[47\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-47)) She was given this name after the birth of her son Jahangir as a Muslim ruler had to be given birth by a Muslim mother. Other Rajput kingdoms soon established matrimonial alliances with the Emperor of Delhi. The law of Hindu succession has always been [patrimonial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrimony "Patrimony"), so the Hindu lineage was not threatened in marrying their princesses for political gain. Rajputs who did give their daughters to Mughals still did not treat Mughals as equals. They would not dine with Mughals or take Muslim women as their lawful wives.^([\[48\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-48))

Two major Rajput clans remained against him, the [Sisodiyas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisodiya "Sisodiya") of [Mewar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewar "Mewar") and [Hadas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hada "Hada") ([Chauhans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chauhan "Chauhan")) of [Ranthambore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranthambore "Ranthambore"). In another turning point of Akbar's reign, [Raja Man Singh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raja_Man_Singh "Raja Man Singh") I of Amer went with Akbar to meet the Hada leader, Surjan Hada, to effect an alliance. Surjan grudgingly accepted an alliance on the condition that Akbar did not marry any of his daughters. Surjan later moved his residence to [Banaras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varanasi "Varanasi"). Surjan Hada's son, Bhoja Hada, opposed the marriage of his granddaughter (his daughter's daughter. His daughter was married to Prince Jagat Singh, son of Man Singh I of Amer) to Jahangir which caused Jahangir to move against Bhoj.^([\[49\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-49)) After his death, his granddaughter was married to Jahangir. A daughter of [Raja Man Singh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raja_Man_Singh "Raja Man Singh") I was also married to Jahangir and she committed suicide.^([\[50\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-50))

Rajput nobles did not like the idea of their kings marrying their daughters to Mughals. Rathore Kalyandas threatened to kill both Mota Raja Udai Singh (of [Jodhpur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodhpur "Jodhpur")) and [Jahangir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahangir "Jahangir") because Udai Singh had decided to marry his daughter Jodha Bai to Jahangir. Akbar on hearing this ordered imperial forces to attack Kalyandas at [Siwana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siwana "Siwana"). Kalyandas died fighting along with his men and the women of Siwana committed [Jauhar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jauhar "Jauhar").^([\[51\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-51))

[Maharana Pratap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharana_Pratap "Maharana Pratap")

Entering into alliance with Rajput kingdoms enabled Akbar to extend the border of his Empire to far off regions, and the Rajputs became the strongest allies of the Mughals. Rajput soldiers fought for the Mughal empire for the next 130 years till its collapse following the death of Aurangzeb. Akbar could trust the rajputs because he held their dearest (eldest son) hostages in perpetuity.^([\[46\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-jadu_38-46))

However, [Maharana Pratap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratap_Singh,_Maharana_of_Mewar "Pratap Singh, Maharana of Mewar") of [Mewar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewar "Mewar") declined to accept Akbar's suzerainty and till the end was opposed to Akbar whom he considered a foreign invader. Pratap also stopped the marriage etiquette of Rajputs who had been giving their daughters to Mughals and his supporting Rajputs instead:

> With such examples as Marwar and Amer (of giving their daughters to > Mughals), and with less power to resist the temptation, the minor > chiefs of Rajasthan, with a brave and numerous vassalage, were > transformed into satraps of Delhi. >
> But these were fearful odds against Pratap. The arms of his country > turned upon him, derived additional force from their self-degradation, > which kindled into jealousy and hatred against the magnanimous > resolution they lacked the virtue to imitate. When Hindu prejudice was > thus violated by every prince in Rajasthan, the Rana renounced all > *matrimonial* alliance with those who were thus degraded. To the > eternal honour of Pratap and his issue be it told that, to the very > close of the monarchy of the Moguls, they refused such alliances not > only with the throne, but even with their brother princes of Marwar > and Ambar. It is a proud triumph of virtue to be able to record from > the autograph letters of the most powerful of the Rajput princes, > Bukhet Singh and [Sawai Jai > Singh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jai_Singh_II_of_Amber "Jai Singh II of Amber"), > that whilst they had risen to greatness by the surrender of principle, > as Mewar had decayed from her adherence to it, they should solicit, > and that humbly, to be readmitted to the honour of matrimonial > intercourse and "to be purified," " to be regenerated," " to be made > Rajputs" and that this favour was granted only on condition of their > abjuring the contaminating practice (of giving daughters to Mughals) > which, for more than a century, had disunited > them.^([\[52\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-52))

### Hindu temples saved

Akbar sent a golden umbrella for an idol which was destroyed. He also allowed conversion of a mosque into Hindu temple at Kurukshetra. This temple had previously been destroyed and converted into a mosque.^([\[53\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-mukhia-53)) [Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirhindi "Sirhindi"), a contemporary of Akbar, does not credit him for saving the temple instead gives credit to the "infidels" ([Hindus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus "Hindus")) for building their own temple by demolishing the mosque.^([\[54\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-54))

### Hindu temples destroyed

Contrary to popular belief Akbar, continued the policy of Babur and Humayun in the destruction of [Hindu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu "Hindu") temples.

Kangra Fort at [Kangra, Himachal Pradesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangra,_Himachal_Pradesh "Kangra, Himachal Pradesh")

It is recorded by Bayazid Biyat, personal attendant of [Humayun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humayun "Humayun"), that Akbar gave two villages for the upkeep of a mosque and a [Madrasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrasa "Madrasa") which was setup by destroying a Hindu temple, this was done under the supervision of 'Todar Mal' who was highly regarded Hindu minister (vizir) of Akbar.^([\[53\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-mukhia-53)) In Akbar's time Todar Mal was called a simple one (*sada-lauh*) because he mourned the loss of the idols he used to worship and he was also called "a blind follower of custom and narrow mindedness" for being a Hindu.^([\[55\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-55))

Akbar's army was responsible for demolition of rich Hindu temples which had gold idols in the [Doab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doab "Doab") region between [Ganga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganga "Ganga") and [Yamuna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamuna "Yamuna").^([\[53\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-mukhia-53))

Historian Abd al-Qadir Badauni records that during Akbar's reign at Nagarkot, near [Kangra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangra,_Himachal_Pradesh "Kangra, Himachal Pradesh"), 200 cows were slaughtered, numerous Hindus killed and a temple was demolished^([\[53\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-mukhia-53))

During the third siege of [Chittor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chittor "Chittor") many temples were destroyed. The shrine of [Moinuddin Chishti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moinuddin_Chishti "Moinuddin Chishti") in [Ajmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajmer "Ajmer") was presented brass candlesticks by Akbar which were taken after the destruction of Kalika temple by Akbar during the third siege of Chittor.^([\[57\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-57))

[Jesuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuit "Jesuit") Father Monserrate, Aquaviva and Enrique arrived at Akbar's court in early 1580 and Monserrate recording his journey in a travelogue comments that religious zeal of Mussalmans has destroyed many Hindu temples and in their places countless tombs and shrines of mussalmans have been erected in which these men are worshipped as if they were saints.^([\[58\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-58)) Monserrate also tutored Emperor's son Murad.

### Jihad against Hindu Kings

During his time Akbar was looked upon by orthodox Muslim elements as a pious Muslim committed to defending Islam against infidelity.^([\[59\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-59)) Rizqullah Mushtaqi, a well known Shaikhzada of Delhi, writing around 1580, says that Akbar was sent by God to protect Islam from being suppressed by Hemu.^([\[60\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-60))

[![](https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/TRFp4lDtnevKYz6oJTiyyqjcPkJwXzWgiuNAEa066pBwrwU2_LAwyOdWausOdt5cYqeg5pHUJRF7a7Y-y2al4zXK9tbqIWUJ1qiy-PQhvkjxKTMp7nzbYOVcYYOP5-ZtbmM6qmhA6Ipf6yojuTYhBdoTE_zptw8BXS5r1u8rO4CB2nk5uMRvP_RqCJbV_Q=s0-d-e1-ft#https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/India_04_0019_chittorgarh.jpg/220px-India_04_0019_chittorgarh.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:India_04_0019_chittorgarh.jpg)

[Chittorgarh Fort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chittorgarh_Fort "Chittorgarh Fort")

Akbar spread Islam in India by waging a holy war ([Jihad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihad "Jihad")) against Hindu kings. During the siege of [Chittor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chittor "Chittor") in 1567 CE, 8000 [rajputs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajput "Rajput") had remained inside the fort to defend various temples after the cavalry sallied out to meet Akbar's army in the plain below. These 8000 died fighting to the last man in defense of Hindu temples when Akbar's army stormed the fort and attacked the temples. In addition there were 30,000 plus Hindu peasants inside the fort who were unarmed and massacred in cold blood by Akbar's forces^([\[61\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-61)) by his order on February 24, 1568 CE. [Carthaginian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthaginian "Carthaginian") on gaining the [Battle of Cannae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cannae "Battle of Cannae") measured his success by bushels of rings taken from the fingers of equestrian roman soldiers and similarly Akbar measured his by the quantity of cordons of distinction ([Janeu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janeu "Janeu") or the sacred thread) collected from the fallen rajput soldiers and other civilians of [Chittor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chittor "Chittor"), which amounted to seventy four and half *man (a unit of weight in India equalling 40kg)* by weight. To eternise the memory of this deed the number 74.5 is accursed and marked on a banker's letter in [Rajasthan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan "Rajasthan") it is the strongest of seals, for "the sin of the sack of [Chittor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chittor "Chittor")" is invoked on him who violates a letter under the safeguard of this mysterious number.^([\[62\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-62))

Akbar celebrated the victory over [Chittor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chittor "Chittor") and [Ranthambore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranthambore "Ranthambore") by laying the foundation of a new city, 23 miles (37km) W.S.W of [Agra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agra "Agra") in 1569. It was called [Fatehpur Sikri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatehpur_Sikri "Fatehpur Sikri") (**city of victory**).^([\[63\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-63))

[![](https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/YLYr099EunMf45C761kMLouXojq2yN0uX41DJA5oSCBQkWtBCUzjmOHidp01t4xrEdo8YJA6pbNwPTY9RzAjVGvaYNef7khnfYFs0hw4zXIOX7KTz7caJw1FjXBgTnVS0bIiAFBYcIBmEplfODRH4JgxRFV0eNuyIoEysNeA9zZcgOhUxpN9uqbyRddf62Jqb5EV41jO0g=s0-d-e1-ft#https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Fatehpur_Sikri_Buland_Darwaza.jpg/170px-Fatehpur_Sikri_Buland_Darwaza.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fatehpur_Sikri_Buland_Darwaza.jpg)

[Buland Darwaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buland_Darwaza "Buland Darwaza") at [Fatehpur Sikri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatehpur_Sikri "Fatehpur Sikri")

Akbar, bolstered by his success, was looking forward to widespread acclamation as a great conqueror of Islam and his vigorous Islamic policy is illustrated by *Fatahnama-i-Chittor* issued by him after the conquest of Chittor at [Ajmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajmer "Ajmer"), where he stayed for some time en route to [Agra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agra "Agra"), on Ramazan 10, 975/March 9,1568, where the infidels (Hindus) are reviled:

> 
> > ..the Omnipotent one who enjoined the task of destroying the wicked > infidels ([Hindus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus "Hindus")) on > the dutiful > [mujahids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mujahid "Mujahid") through > the blows of their thunder-like scimitars laid down: "Fight them! > Allah will chastise them at your hands and He will lay them low and > give you victory over > them".^([\[64\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-64)) >
> 

Further on the call to Jihad against Hindu kings of [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India") is raised and also a call to the destruction of Hindu temples:

> 
> > This is of the grace of my Lord that He may try me whether I am > grateful or ungrateful— we spend our precious time to the best of our > ability in war (*ghiza*) and > [Jihad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihad "Jihad") and with the help > of Eternal Allah, who is the supporter of our ever-increasing empire, > we are busy in subjugating the localities, habitations, forts and > towns which are under the possession of the infidels > ([Hindus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus "Hindus")), may Allah > forsake and annihilate all of them, and thus raising the standard of > Islam everywhere and removing the darkness of polytheism and violent > sins by the use of sword. We destroy the places of worship of idols in > those places and other parts of > India.^([\[65\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-65)) >
> 

The reimposition of jizya in 1575 is also symbolic of vigrous Islamic policy.^([\[66\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-66)) Abd al-Qadir Badauni who was then one of Akbar's court chaplains or imams, states that he sought an interview with the emperor when the royal troops were marching against [Rana Pratap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharana_Pratap "Maharana Pratap") in 1576, begging leave of absence for "the privilege of joining the campaign to soak his Islamic beard in Hindu infidel blood". Akbar was so pleased at the expression of allegiance to his person and to the Islamic idea of Jihad that he bestowed a handful of gold coins on Badaoni as a token of his pleasure.^([\[67\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-67))

Akbar boasted that he was a great conqueror of Islam to the ruler of [Turan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turan "Turan"), Abdullah Khan, in a letter in 1579:

> 
> > Places and lands > ([India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India")) which from the > time of rise of the sun of Islam has not been trod by the horse-hooves > of world conquering princes and where their swords had never flashed > have become the dwelling places and homes of the faithful > ([Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims "Muslims")). The > churches and temples of the infidels > ([Hindus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus "Hindus")) and heretics > have become mosques and holy shrines for the masters of orthodoxy. God > ([Allah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allah "Allah")) be > praised!^([\[68\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-68)) >
> 

### Taxation on Hindus

[Jizya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jizya "Jizya") was repealed in 1562 by Akbar but was reinstated in 1575,^([\[69\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-69)) before being again repealed in 1580. This tax had been used as a weapon by Muslim rulers in India to convert poor Hindus to the fold of Islam because this tax could not be imposed on Muslims.^([\[70\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-70)) This tax caused most burden on the poor, and on their inability to pay the poor Hindus faced execution but by converting to Islam their life was spared. [Firoz Shah Tughlaq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firuz_Shah_Tughluq "Firuz Shah Tughluq") explained how [jizya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jizya "Jizya") was used to help conversions:

> 
> > I encouraged my [Kafir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kafir "Kafir") > (infidel) subjects to embrace the religion of the prophet, and I > proclaimed that everyone who repeated the creed and became a muslim > should be exempt from > *[jizya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jizya "Jizya")* ...... Great > numbers of Hindus presented themselves and were admitted to the honor > of > Islam.^([\[71\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-71)) >
> 

Akbar's apparent measures of tolerance such as abolition of pilgrimage tax and jizya on Hindus were episodic and had no real benefit for Hindus.^([\[72\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-72))

Akbar forced many Hindus to convert to Islam against their will^([\[73\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-73)) and also changed the name of some of their holy places to Islamic ones, an example being, the changing of [Prayag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayag "Prayag") to [Allahabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allahabad "Allahabad")^([\[74\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-74)) in 1583.^([\[75\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-75)) During Akbar's reign, his general Husain Khan 'Tukriya' forcibly made non-Muslims ([Hindus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus "Hindus")) wear discriminatory^([\[76\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-76)) patches of different colours on their shoulders or sleeves.^([\[77\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-77))

Historian [Dasharatha Sharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasharatha_Sharma "Dasharatha Sharma") says that we are prone to idealise Akbar's reign with court histories like Akbarnama and give Akbar more than his due.^([\[78\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-78)) If one looks at other contemporary works like *[Dalpat Vilas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalpat_Vilas "Dalpat Vilas")* it becomes clear that Akbar used to treat his Hindu nobles very badly.^([\[79\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-autogenerated183-79))

Consequently Hindus did not hold Akbar or his Hindu generals in high regard which became apparent when they boycotted the [Vishwanath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishwanath "Vishwanath") temple built by Akbar's general Man Singh (which he built after taking Akbar's permission) because Man Singh's family had marital relations with Akbar.^([\[80\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-80))

Akbar's grave

Akbar's Hindu generals could not construct temples without emperor's permission. In Bengal, Man Singh started the construction of a temple in 1595 but Akbar ordered him to convert it into a mosque.^([\[81\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-81))

The contempt for Akbar came to fore when Hindu Jat community leader, Raja Ram, tried to ransack Akbar’s mausoleum at [Sikandra, Agra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikandra,_Agra "Sikandra, Agra"). But his attempt was foiled by the local faujdar, Mir Abul Fazl. After a short while, Raja Ram reappeared at Sikandara in 1688^([\[82\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-82)) and taking advantage of the delay in coming of Shaista Khan, the governor-designate of Agra, he attacked and plundered **Akbar**’s mausoleum and carried away the precious articles of gold and silver, carpets, lamps etc. and destroyed what he could not carry.

Rajaram and his men removed the bones of Akbar and burnt them, a grave insult to a Muslim:^([\[83\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akbar&oldid=320822992#cite_note-83))
