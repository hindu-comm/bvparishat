Thank you Bijoyji for a nice review. Permit me to add a few lines about your comment on Akbar.  
  

There is no doubt that Akbar was somewhat different from othet Muslim kings. The Britishers also seem to have appreciated his views on Taxes. According to a British report, Akbar decreed that while collecting tax, the tax payer must have for himself enough money for the upkeep of the family and other needs ( obviously so that nobody starved in his kingdom).  
  

Some of the Rajputs, who sided with Akbar seem to have been misunderstood. Rana Pratap was great hero and he is literally worshipped to this day, His father dispossessed him and made his younger brother the successor. After his father's death Rana Pratap had to dislodge his brother and his brother ran away to Akbar to save his life. Raja Mansingh another great hero and a great Hindu, had enjoyed the status Akbar's son. When Akbar sent Raja Mansigh to fight Rana Pratap, the former first wanted to meet Rana Pratap personally to come to a settlement, but Rana Pratap refused to meet Raja Mansigh, saying that the former's family had sided with the Muslims. Then Raja Mansigh said that his family had sacrificed their daughters only to save the Rajputs. Then the battle was fought and Rana lost and had to withdraw. Raja Mansigh is said to have told his army not to pursue Rana Pratap as Raja Mansingh wanted Rana to escape safely. Akbar was not happy at the lenience of Raja Mansingh and later on he himself led another expedition against Rana Pratap Raja Mansigh made many Hindu temples throughout Akbar's kingdom. Once Salim opposed Akbar's sanctioning money for Hindu temples, but Akbar overruled Salim, saying that Hindus too were also his subjects.
