Dear Mishra Ji  
  
Yours is a very balanced view. I like it.  
  
If Rajiv Ji wants to win over the western schools then he has to accept the views and concerns expressed by Indian scholars. Insiders have also divergent views. However the powerful view which can be used as weapon against western scholarship should be acceptable for us. Let's try to consolidate the views.  
  
With best regards
