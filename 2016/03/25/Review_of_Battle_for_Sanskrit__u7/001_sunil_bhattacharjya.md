Dear friends,  
  

I am sure Shri Rajiv Malhotra knows that no modern writer has claimed to have written any perfect book or any perfect article, which will never need any revision. It is always better to write a book like the one under review, without any delay, even if the work is not perfect, than to delay or not writing at all. As I understand, Shri Malhotra wanted to raise the issue on the Sheldon's views on the subject he covers and his book did create a stir and a welcome stir indeed. Hope he will revise his book to address the lacunae, if any, as may be pointed by the reviewers.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
