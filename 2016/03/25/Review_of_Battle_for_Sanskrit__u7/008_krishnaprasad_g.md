Mr Rajiv  
  

There is a traditional procedure in Vakyartha System. What Vaadi Says some time prativaadi should be able to do anuvada of the same. Here if you are not speaking personally you are also not eligible to do anuvada what Sri Ganesh Ji said. As you can't understand the subject in traditional way. And no need to guess or under estimate Sri Ganesh Ji whether he has understood tradition or western. Because he is well versed in both.  
  

Your attacking style is good but you don't have wepons eithier to defeat westerner or Indian as you have not in to both.  

Those who love Sanskrit but unware of the same would love your book. unless your book is a burden for earth.  
  

Ganjesh is not Ipod He is human. Don't lose respect by stating nonsense, He is an unquestionable scholar.  
  

Regards
