The same rules must apply equally to all. Since you know so much about our tradition please note that even a king must abide by the rules as there is nobody above if. So to elevate one party to such lofty heights that he is exempt from the same criticism he has given to the other would be a breach of the rules of fairness.

  

Nobody is exempt here. As i said i will demonstrate that Ganesh is severely deficient in understanding the west for the task at hand.

  

Pls note i acknowledge my own limits and do not know why Ganesh needs you as his attorney to protect him.
