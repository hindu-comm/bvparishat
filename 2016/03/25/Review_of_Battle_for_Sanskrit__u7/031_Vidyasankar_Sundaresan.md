Could we please keep this about the issues, instead of the people raising the issues? A lot of commenting from the sidelines is extremely counter productive. Both Rajiv Malhotra and Shatavadhani Ganesh are members of this forum. One has written a book and the other has reviewed it. If there is to be any constructive way forward, it should come from a discussion between these two, if they choose to do it here. It would behoove the rest of us to listen more and comment less, in the course of the ensuing discussion. Chiming in with personal comments about each person's qualifications or their perceived lack and their personal motivations does not help an iota.

Best regards,  
Vidyasankar
