Sir please tell me one valid point for why Rajiv criticizing Sri Ganesh. If he has nothing but do personal attacks what could I give clarity. If he has any thing to show he is wrong he should have written without personal attacks. Even a fool can understand his intension of his article. Just jaleousy that Ganesh did not appreciate his work.

One thing is sure. Sri Ganesh sir is doing extreme service to Indian tradition. Which Rajivs book is not even comparable.  
The battle for Sanskrit should be with in. And this is doing by our Ganesh sir.  
He is not selling anything for money. He gives discourses every day. By his lectures many youth from IT and other MNCs have started learning Sanskrit. He even teaches through Skype all over world and not for money. He never advertised till now or he did sell his knowledge.

Basically he is a Rank holder in Engineering. And later a product of IIsc. He is also well versed in Botany Chemistry Metallurgy. He knows more than 20 language.  
Now tell me being a fan of him how can I keep mum ?

As in traditional books ,as you said, scholars uses a word Randa putra etc. also. But I did not do that.
