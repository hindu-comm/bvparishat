Dear Krishna Prasad,

I am writing this message as a list member. Can we please move on. Let Dr. Ganesh respond if he chooses to do so. Please don’t bring in phrases such as ‘Is me and my family are different?’ etc. Lets remove the personal elements out and write only about the issues raised. I hope you have agreed to the moderators note that was sent by the moderators team and also the request made by Prof. Varakhedi not as a moderator in one of his mails on this thread. There is proverb oft quoted ‘United we win divided we fall’
