Dear scholars,  
  
I appreciate all of you for taking part in this debate. But, I am sorry to note that being a member of this scholarly family I do not endorse the exchanges of words in personal level. All discussions must happen in a modest way and with a respect to each other.  
  
Here I found that a reviewer did a critical remarks in a blog. The author can respond to him on the same blog or in any other blog and send the link to this list. I think that's better. May responses confine to the questions raised in this list. Let's not bring outside issues here and debate, when they are not directly relevant. If some scholar or author feels so, let him do so with an objective justification why he is compelled to do so.  
  
Secondly criticising others or opponent scholar s in personal level or describing him as "ignorant" or passing a judgement about his scholarship or knowledge is not a good practice. The list Managemnt does not approve this. I am not writing this on behalf of BVP manamegemt but as a member of the list I just want to request honourable members not to force the Managemnt to keep the members under moderation or to impose restriction on him or her.  
  
The BVP list is not a place for personal battle. It's is a place of dialogue. Please keep the spirit of dialogue.  
  
With best regards,  
Shrivarakhedi
