Response:  

-   Bringing families into this is in bad taste. Please avoid this.  
-   What I can or cannot do is not up to you to assess, just as I do not
    try to pass judgment on you personally. My intent is to critique
    what is written by whosoever. -   I showed lots of respect for Ganesh in my post, in fact not raising
    issue with the numerous personal judgments he made of me - i.e. ad
    hominem attacks. -   Let us move on to discussions of scholarship, not personalities,
    please. -   Regarding my comment on iPod: I wish to clarify this is not anything
    intended to be personal about one individual. Rather, I wish to
    raise the following scholarly issue for discussions: *In this age of
    mechanized memories, is it as important as it once was to learn huge
    quantities of information by heart*? Is that requirement obsolete?
    These days many people even perform yajna, pujas, etc using
    recoorded chants. In my lecture at Maharishi University I asked
    whether this is authentic mantra. My answer was that t*he absence of
    prana makes it less useful even though the sound might be perfec*t.
    So if one agrees with me on this, then one cannot say Sanskrit
    mantras have nothing unique. But Ganesh said Sanskrit is merely a
    language and has nothing special for knowledge per se. If that is
    so, then why bother memorizing and why not replace all that with
    iPods? Please see this as a serious issue about the special status
    of mantra.  

Thanks and regards,
