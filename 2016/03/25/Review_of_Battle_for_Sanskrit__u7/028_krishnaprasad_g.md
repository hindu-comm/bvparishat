If my words show bad taste. Then why not Rajivs  
Is this a way to write about a scholar by non- scholar who doesn't even know Rama shabda  
And more over he said Ganesh cannot understand Western. Isn't that shows a bad taste of him.  
In his lectures he has said umpteen times that you can't understand Western Philosophy. Isn't that a bad taste ? Is me and my family are different?
