There are many academic examples of back and forth articles between scholars triggered by a review. One that comes to mind was between Arvind Sharma and Rambachan both writing in East-West journal from univ Hawaii. I can cite many such examples.

  

Secondly if a review should not get further discussion then why was it posted here followed by posts by various persona supporting it? Why are the rules different? Why am i asked to ignore it, or say one word "disagree", when those on the other side are free to comment?
