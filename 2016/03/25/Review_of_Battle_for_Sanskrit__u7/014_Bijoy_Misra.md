Dear friends,

  

This discussion has little merit. A book is a public document, so is a review. 

A review does not change by argument. Unlike Prof Pollock, Sri Ganesh is only

commenting on a product. Rajiv has a right to refute by stating that he "disagrees"

which is obvious. As a matter of fact a review is only a point of view, it is

not a book. At most it might affect the sales, which I doubt. Sri Ganesh has

done a critical review and I admire the amount of time he has given to his

material. It is so thorough that I have asked him to send me a copy for my

reference.

  

I admire Rajiv for taking up a difficult challenge singlehanded. But the task

remains to mobilize the scholars working in India. Sri Ganesh is a representative

of this august group. Many of the group are members of BVP here. I urge

all in helping Rajiv Malhotra in countering huge misconception created by

the western students of Indology with a pretension to help India. Rajiv needs

support, encouragement and the blessings. For me as an immigrant parent,

Rajiv's work has been a path-finder.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
