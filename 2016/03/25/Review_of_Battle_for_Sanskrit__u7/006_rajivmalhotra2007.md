***My response to Shri Shatavadhani R. Ganesh: Abstract***

***  
***

I just read Shri R. Ganesh's critique of my book, *The Battle For Sanskrit*. I am going to develop a detailed point by point response in the next few days. But meanwhile, I wanted to say a few things to prevent hasty judgments by anyone:  
  
I wish to start by thanking him for showing so much interest in my work. It is a very useful criticism for various reasons. For one thing, all such responses, regardless of their substance or reliability, serve to wake up the traditional scholars and compel them to pay more attention to the prevailing intellectual battlefield. Furthermore, such criticisms also give me a chance to take my book’s debates deeper. His criticism is well-intended, and he seems to want to “outsmart” my purva-paksha of Pollock by offering his own. That is helpful and welcome because it expands the discourse.  
  
However, *there are numerous serious errors, misunderstanding and contradictions, both in substance and in the logic used by him.*  
  
For one thing, he does not seem to have read much (if anything) of Pollock directly, and uses my work as secondary access to the subject matter. (Ironically, he criticizes me for relying upon secondary works on Sanskrit texts.) This deprives him of the full context of Pollock's writings that I am evaluating. He also lacks an adequate understanding of the broader Western idiom and theories in which Pollock's work is couched. It is misleading (though a common bad habit) to surgically pluck out a sentence here and there and rely solely on it. Pollock's work has to be understood *holistically* first, and it becomes clear that Ganesh has not taken the time to do that. My detailed response will show this shortcoming of Ganesh in specific cases.  
  
Nor does he seem to have understood my book correctly. He also cites one of my prior books, but misunderstands it on important issues. For instance, he asserts that I am against the diversity of Indian traditions. Nobody who has read my work in detail ever said such a thing. In fact, my earlier book, *Being Different*, which he cites, says the exact opposite: it contrasts Indian diversity with the Western normative quality and Abrahamic emphasis upon "one truth".

  

Actually, a central highlight of *Being Different* is that it goes beyond the common platitudes we read about our diversity, and proposes *a comprehensive theory on *why* there is diversity*. The contrast between what I call *history-centrism* and *adhyatma-vidya* are key building blocks I have introduced to explain not just the diversity in our traditions, but more importantly *why* this diversity exists. This insight as to the underlying *causes* of diversity in one civilization and monoculture in the other civilization is worked out in considerable detail in my work. I doubt Ganesh has understood the depth and implications of this theory.  

  

Later on, in my subsequent book, *Indra's Net*, I develop this thesis further into what I call the *open architecture* of dharma systems. Not only is there immense diversity, but at the same time there is profound underlying unity - hence there is no fear of chaos as in the case of the Abrahamic systems. There is no control-obsession in our culture to the extent of the West. I explain *why* this is so, whereas most writers have been content merely stating that this is so, without adequately asking why.

  

Given that this theory of our diversity has been one of my important areas of work, I find it disappointing that Ganesh not only remains ignorant of it, but that he misrepresents me in exactly the opposite direction.  
  
Besides his inadequate understanding of both Pollock’s and my writings, Ganesh is also making some *illogical* statements. Ironically, these are made with the stated purpose of exposing "Malhotra's pseudo-logic". I will explain this in my detailed article.  
  
I will also argue against Ganesh's understanding of our tradition in specific instances, the area where he should be much more qualified than I am. No doubt he has immense memory and citation expertise. I admire him greatly for these accomplishments. But just as an ipod machine can recite millions of things without understanding them, I will show where he lacks proper understanding of our traditional worldview on some of the very topics he discusses in this article.  
  
Finally, I will address the issue he starts out with to frame me negatively in the eyes of readers: whether I am qualified to do such a project. Our tradition has encouraged and even valorized innovative thinkers who seemed to lack formal training, but who successfully challenged those with eminent “credentials”. This way to brand me right up front is an instance of his arrogance, and in my full article I shall dwell upon the merits of a given individual’s background. I will explain what exactly the project I have started is about (which he does not seem to grasp properly), and my relevant experience and expertise in doing it; I will let the reader decide for himself.  

  

In fact, I will question whether Ganesh has the required intellectual training in specific areas of competence that are necessary for *this* kind of work that I have undertaken. I doubt he has much real-world experience in the global intellectual kurukshetra, which is not to be confused with meetings of “like-minded people” exchanges accolades sitting in India. For the global battlefield, what would be the relevant experience equivalent to his 1,000 avadhanas? I submit it is the experience of going out of one’s comfort zone, and into the line of enemy fire, surrounded by a hundred or more opponents, and being able to tilt the discourse in one’s favor, and come out stronger for the next encounter. I have had a very large number of these live experiences in audiences where I was the only Indian or Hindu, where there is blatant intimidation and mockery, where every attempt has been made to belittle our identity, and where I had nothing personal to gain and all my reputation and social credibility to lose. I have also had a large number of very direct online encounters with some of the toughest and most renowned Hinduphobics. Mere theoretical knowledge is not enough to be qualified in this battlefield – as I am sure Ganesh will agree, given that his avadhanas are the field-experience necessary to train him in his domain of expertise.

  

My point is that these are two different types of yajnas Ganesh and I have done. They entail two distinct battlefields, with different kinds of opponents and issues. In my case, this entailed quitting my thriving professional life in order to dedicate myself for 25 years to do this with full intensity. I will explain in my article what I have learned that is critical for the present undertaking, and how the lack of this type of yajna is a handicap Ganesh is blissfully oblivious of.  

  

While I am aware of my shortcomings, and explain in my book the necessity for more qualified insiders like Ganesh to join as team players, he does not appreciate his own limitations in this battle. So the appreciation and respect is one-way: I *do* appreciate his value as an intellectual warrior. Unfortunately, his view of the kurukshetra is a limited one, having never stepped into it to experience close encounters personally – not in the global arena. This is why he could not be a team leader, being content living on a high pedestal. The kurukshetra we faace required boots on the ground as well as star wars from the sky.

  

I am preparing a more detailed response to some of the glaring errors in Ganesh's article. I shall do this in the spirit of the Indian tradition to debate opponents with mutual respect. We must set aside issues of personality, who is who in credentials or public image. Let us focus only on facts and arguments.  

  

I will be back with a fuller article in a few days.

  

Regards,

Rajiv
