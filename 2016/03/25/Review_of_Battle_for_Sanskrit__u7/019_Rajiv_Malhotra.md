A good approach would be that anyone who wants to discuss the Ganesh review can post comment under that review in the web site where it appears. Then there would be no need here.

But one sided principles simple are unacceptable.

I could easily request prof Varakhedi to give the same advice to Ganesh.

As far as working w traditional scholars goes, my events in india (with youtube videos to prove) adequately demonstrate my intentions and the reception i received.
