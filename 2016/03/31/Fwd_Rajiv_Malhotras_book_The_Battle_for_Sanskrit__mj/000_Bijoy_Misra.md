Dear Prof Pollock,

Greetings.  

I did receive a copy of Rajiv's book and now finished reading

it. He makes some pointed observations about various aspects

of your work. Some of the observations are alarming. You

should take a look if not already done so. He also says that

he has invited you for a debate. 

I am just writing to advocate in favor of such a debate. As I

said before, my interest is with our immigrant community and

our children. In case Rajiv is misinterpreting your words, you

should directly correct him. It is better to go on with a face to

face moderated public discussion than a long rejoinder.

I am copying to Rajiv Malhotra. I can help organize a venue

and help moderate it in case you think it is a good idea. I have

not asked Rajiv's permission on the debate. I assume he would

agree if you would.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra

Lincoln, MA
