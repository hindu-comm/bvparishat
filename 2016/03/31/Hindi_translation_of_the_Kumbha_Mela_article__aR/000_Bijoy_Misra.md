Friends,

  

Here is a Hindi translation of the Kumbha Mela article I posted earlier.

It appears in a magazine called Grabhanal from Bhopal.
[www.garbhanal.com](http://www.garbhanal.com)

You may read.

  

I am told that there are vedic references of the geometry of Prayag and the

connotation that "sin" may migrate up the river. I have not researched. My

view is with the process of water as a "cleanser".

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
