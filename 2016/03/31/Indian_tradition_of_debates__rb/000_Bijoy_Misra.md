Dear friends,

  

The Indian tradition of "debates" as I know happens one on one where

ideas and suggestions are presented and refuted. Normally there could

be a moderator who could help to streamline the procedure. It is purely

intellectual with no scope of animosity or anger. Motivated with this

principle, I had written to Prof Pollock to engage in a debate with Rajiv

Malhotra directly since Rajiv has challenged his interpretation with

strength and conviction. I did volunteer to organize and moderate

such a debate. Prof. Pollock has not responded to the proposal yet.

  

Now we see several reviews of Rajiv' book. Prof Iyengar posted

Shatavadhani Ganeshji's review, I posed mine. Shivraj Singh (there is

doubt on the identity of the person) started picking on my comment on

Akbar. Rajiv went on a "review" of Ganeshji's review since he thought

that Ganeshji did not read Pollock's material well. More "review"s of

Ganeshji's material is being done by a few others.

  

The forums like BVP have to be secluded from casual blog comments

to ration postings. Loosely I was commenting earlier that it can easily

degrade to an activist group than a considered restrained research group.

I am writing this note to request all to help reduce this possibility.

In an activist group we discard most postings, in a research group we

read every posting.

  

Whether Ganeshji's review or mine has the merit for further scholarly

discussion could be an issue. A review is an opinion, it is not a "book."

Both of us are self-appointed without any institutional back up. I liked

what Rajiv is saying, Ganeshji agreed on the premise but suggested

stronger analysis. Both of us have stated what we liked and Ganeshji

has given in detail what he did not like. The right protocol would be

to ask him to expand on the comments if we want to create a scholarly

discussion. If he fails he could withdraw his review. 

  

Peer review and manuscript review are standard practices in academic

scholarship. The west manages it by planting individuals and creating

"schools". India also had engineered segregated schools of thought

to shout down people who might disagree. At the same time Indian

tradition has been toward a respectful hearing and the acceptance that

multiple views are likely to exist. 

  

What Prof Pollock is engaged in is to paint the India in a biased colonial

view and that is a pure ignorant uncultivated position. His command of

Sanskrit is limited and he has little to do with poets or poetry. His Ramayana

translation lacks rigor and dignity. In older Indian tradition of scholarship

such persons would be considered mischievous and ignoble. I would

consider all to frame the debate against the power of money and bias to

diminish a culture and a tradition. This is the message that Rajiv is

championing and I support him. I say this on behalf of our children and

the nation's youth. 

  

Since Prof Pollock is possibly reluctant to individually debate Rajiv, let

me suggest that BVP as a group can invite him to address the questions.

He should have the dignity and respect to accept such invitation. This

might be in the tradition of "debates" envisaged in Indian tradition.
Others

may suggest different procedures.



Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
