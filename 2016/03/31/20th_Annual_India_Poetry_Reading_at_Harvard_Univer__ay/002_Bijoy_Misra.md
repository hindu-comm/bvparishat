Dear Prof Pandurangi,

I am sorry if the event posting was considered extraneous.

I do see occasional event postings here except ours is a bit far away to enable physical presence.

The goal is to create an intellectual bridge on behalf our youth of Indian descent abroad.

I had also witnessed a poetry event in WSC Bangkok and had enjoyed.

My point of view has been to encourage creativity in language where we can.

Hope I answered the query..

Best regards,

BM
