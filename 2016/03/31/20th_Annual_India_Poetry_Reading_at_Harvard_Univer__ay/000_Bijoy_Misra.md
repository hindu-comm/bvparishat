Dear friends,

  

Here is something I would like your consideration and help.

In 1997, we tried something called India Poetry Reading where

we let people recite poems in Indian languages in a specially

convened meeting. The late resident monk of Ramakrishna

Mission in Boston Swami Sarvagatananda presided. Swami

being a Gandhian, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of India's

freedom through poetry. It was a remarkable afternoon.

  

We have continued to meet every year and eight years ago

we formed a group called South Asian Poets of New England

to help create an immigrant voice in the area. This group

meets every quarter and celebrates the voice of people in

South Asia in all regions. It includes poets from Bangladesh,

Nepal and Pakistan. Others would be included as we reach out.

  

I am sending this invitation for our 20th India Poetry meeting

scheduled for May 15 at Harvard. Our theme this year is

"Environment"**परिवेश. **I am attaching a flyer. If you write and

have a relevant composition, you can send to me with a translation

in English. You can write fresh which we like. All languages are

OK. All material would be archived in our website. A few selected

poems will be read in absentia.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
