Hi,

  

I had to take down the compiler due to certain glitches. We will come online in a bit.

In general, BRDs will be in EBNF format of saskrit sentences. I am not an expert in Sanskrit but only with limited knowledge. So I work with some English to Sanskrit translators. The keywords are fixed set to make complete sentences. Methods are built by the same manner of fixed keyword usage. For test, I have built a demo of list builder.

I will publish the app again after fixes.,

  

best Regards,

Prabhat
