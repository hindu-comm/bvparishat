hariH OM,

1\. Cow urine distillate has been patented by the Go Vigyan Anusandhan Kendra Nagpur for its anti cancer effects. <http://m.timesofindia.com/india/RSS-developed-cancer-drug-gets-US-patent/articleshow/6058657.cms>  
2. There is a tradition of taking medicated cow urine arka (distillate). This tradition is being revived of late by vaidyas. There is anecdotal evidence of wonder cures.  
3. Cow urine, cow dung, buttermilk etc. When mixed and aerobically fermented gives rise to "jiivaamRRita" which is known to rejuvenate barren soils. A variation of this concoction is the biijaamRRita which helps seeds sprout into healthy and robust plants.  
4. Cow urine and cow dung in the soil help absorb and retain soil moisture. In many places in India the soil biomass has reached alarming proportions which has led to underground water becoming scarce.

You may also see the following story where saline soil has been rejuvenated by the use of cow dung and cow urine:

 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  
 shrivathsa.
