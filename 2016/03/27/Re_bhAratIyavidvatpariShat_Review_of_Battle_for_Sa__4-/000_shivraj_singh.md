Dear Bijoy,  
I am a bit confused by your question.  
In your article there is one mention of Akbar. My response was on Akbar. Is'nt it easy to connect the two?  
  
You say:  
"Mahmud came to loot, Al Beruni came with him to study. The scholar studied Sanskrit and was bedazzled to observe India’s life and society. He appreciated India’s balance of the spiritual with the mundane. Babur and Humayun butchered Indians, but Akbar melded into the Indian style. "  
  
Akbar has been eulogised by all and sundry. It is high time at least Indian academics see what he really stood for. I am not sure why Akbar's atrocities are overlooked by all of us, including you?  
  
Did you read what I posted? Do you agree with the content or you have any questions on atrocities against Hindus comitted by Akbar?  
  
BTW let me mention your statement that Akbar's grandson learnt Sanskrit is wrong too.  
  
  
Shivraj
