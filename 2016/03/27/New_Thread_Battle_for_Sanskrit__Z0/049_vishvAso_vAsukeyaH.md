This is in reference to the below discussion.  
  
The verses (40-86 and 40-88) indicate that, atleast within Ayurveda, later discoveries and scholarship overrides even the vedas. To what extant can it be generalized? Of course, there is the concept of arthavAda in mImAmsa and the three level (Adhi-bhautika/ Adhi-daivika/ AdhyAtmika ) interpretation framework ( \<-- कस्मिन्नुपनिषदीदं दत्तम्?) which is relevant.  
  
But, how would traditional scholars judge whether  

-   statement is to be taken as pramANa inspite of contradicting direct
    observation and logic, versus -   whether it should be taken as arthavAda and non-Adhi-bhautika?
