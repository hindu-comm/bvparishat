The battle now enters the opposing side's home turf. The attached posters pertain to my first two events on USA campuses.  
  
Tomorrow April 2 is at MIT.  
April 15 will be at Columbia University, home of Sheldon Pollock.  
  
Both are open to the public. They will be videotaped and uploaded on Youtube.
