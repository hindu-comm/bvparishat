Thanks Shatavadhani Ganesh Ji for the reference. Here are the verses (40-86 and 40-88) with the Sarvangasundara commentary in the NSP 1939 edition

  

<https://archive.org/stream/Ashtanga.Hridaya.of.Vagbhata#page/n1139/mode/1up>

  

Perhaps the intent of Vagbhata behind the verse 40-86 was paraphrased as “Vagbhata laughs at people who seek proof for medicines in mantras” by Hari Ravikumar and Shatavadhani Ganesh Ji. And probably the statement “\[Ayurveda\] doesn’t speak about even the healing effects of yogasanas, let alone mantra” by the authors is to be interpreted as a general statement on Ayurveda, while verses like ओषधयो मणयश्च सुमन्त्राः are to be seen as vestigial elements of older tradition. 



The references are useful. I do not know even theवृद्धिरादैच् of Ayurveda, the Ayurveda scholars on the list may shed more light on how to reconcile the verse mentioning सुमन्त्रs as having the power to heal with the निर्मन्त्र verse at the end.
