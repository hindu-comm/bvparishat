Dear list members,

  

I do not have a position on this debate (as of now, that is), but as I understand, the critique of TBFS on the website of Sandeep Balakrishna is co-authored by Sh. Shatavadhani Ganesh and Sh. Hari Ravikumar. Hari Ravikumar is listed as a co-author in the critique, but separately. Does this mean he is the secondary author? Can somebody please share more information about Hari Ravikumar?

  

While referring and citing the article, it may be helpful to keep the dual-authorship of the article in mind (and also the fact that appendix E has a third author).

  

A minor point, the critique may some copy-editing, I saw some minor errors here and there (e.g. missing diacritics in pram??as, Ved??gas, Raghuva??a, San?tana Dharma). 

  

It would be great if a journal can start a series of articles debating TBFS. The critique by Sh. Shatavadhani Ganesh and Sh. Hari Ravikumar as well as a reply by Sh. Rajeev Malhotra (who said he is working on one) may be published in the same journal. The positions of Sh. Chintaman Vinayak Vaidya and Pt. Shripad Damodar Satwalekar on beef consumption by Vedic Hindus were diametrically opposite, but both were published in the same magazine (the weekly Young India) published by Gandhiji. A common neutral platform (same journal and same editorial board) might be great for such debates.

  

Despite the sharp differences of opinion, there will always be something new to learn in the debate.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
