The context in which this is said in my book must be clear first. I am refuting Pollock in that place. Specifically, he is against mantras and other things he considers spiritual, because one of his core allegations is that yajnas, mantras, sacred texts, etc. (i.e. whatever is not purely "secular") is toxic and oppressive of Dalits and women.  
  
When I say mantras "produce effects" in the sentence quoted by Ganesh, **I do *not* specify healing effects.** Effects could be of any kind. I mention that mantras are used in certain types of meditation, but do not claim healing.  
  
My argument is that there is no oppressive effect of mantras that could be seen as a human rights problem the way Pollock wants to prove. Ganesh makes an assumption about healing and then gives his argument against it. *His argument does not apply to my book's thesis.
