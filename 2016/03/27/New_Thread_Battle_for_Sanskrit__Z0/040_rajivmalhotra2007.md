Since Shatavadhani Ganesh's review of my book was discusses on bvp, I have published my response to him at Swarajya. It is posted in two parts.  
  
Part 1 explains why it is complex to understand Pollock; what is different in his methodology compared to prior Orientalists; what are common errors traditionalists can make in understanding him.  
  
Part 2 shows that Ganesh Shatavadhani has not understood Pollock. A few concrete examples from his writing are cited to show that Ganesh applies knowledge about "generic" Orientalism to address the issues concerning Pollock. Our purva-paksha tradition requires each purva-pakshin to be studied specifically, and not through superficial generalizations based on reading others.  
  
***Part 1 -*** **The challenges of understanding Sheldon Pollock**: **<http://swarajyamag.com/culture/rajiv-malhotra-explains-the-challenges-of-understanding-sheldon-pollock>**  
  
***Part 2: *Has Shatavadhani Ganesh really understood Pollock?**** **<http://swarajyamag.com/culture/purvapaksha-has-shatavadhani-ganesh-really-understood-pollock#.VwIc6bXX6rM.twitter>**  
  
Comments may be posted under those articles at the site where they are published.  
  
I will publish Part 3 (and potentially Part 4) of my response to Ganesh after a few days.  
  
Those who want to join an extensive debate on this matter are welcome to my egroup (which has 6,300 members). See: <https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/RajivMalhotraDiscussion/info>
