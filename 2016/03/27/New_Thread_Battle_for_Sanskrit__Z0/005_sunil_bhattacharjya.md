Dear Nityananda Misraji,  
  

I think the issue for the debate on the "Battle for Sanskrit" could be slightly different from that for the other debate between C.V.Vaidya and S.D.Satwalekar, in the sense that, the multiple author's critique of Shri Rajiv's work seems to show that the battle was theirs as well (and of course of the all Indian Sanskrit lovers' fraternity), only with the difference that while they missed the bus, Shri Rajiv was the first to take up the cudgel. In such a case there should be more of amity and less of fireworks in the ensuing debate.  
  

Regards,
