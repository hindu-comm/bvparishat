Mantra recitation is japa and japa has an effect. I have personally experimented this.

It has a rasa effect. A sick man cannot recite, but a healthy person can keep the

sickness away. 

  

Someone did parody of this in WSC at Bangkok. I protested. There were a whole

group of people with him. One would not understand the power of japa unless one

tries yoga meditation.

  

By the way we have Devi recitation coming Saturday here.
