I completly agree with Ajit ji and Rajiv ji, and also I have posted my doubt in a separate thread. It may take some time it to get through moderator.  
  
I understood that Rajiv Ji wasnt answering me, but clarifying the point which he holds that could have been mistaken with trivial doubt of mine. So he didnt wanted the discussion under the thread dedicated to TBFS diverted to immature doubts of mine. I welcome this.  
  
However I request any Pandita well versed in Ayurveda or who knows the subject matter to clarify my doubt in a different thread.
