I welcome the idea of publishing Ganesh's review and my (forthcoming) response in some journal.  
  
I have prior experience in this approach. My earlier book, *Being Different* (2011), was the subject of a special issue of the *International Journal of Hindu Studies* (Springer). There were 6 separate reviews of my book in that issue, followed by my response. It became one of their most popular issues and the collection of articles is frequently cited. The writers were all well established international scholars in that discipline. A general call for review papers was made by the journal from which these scholars were selected to write their reviews. It was their December, 2012 issue. You can get that issue at: <http://link.springer.com/journal/11407/16/3/page/1>  
  
The reviews ranged from very negative to very positive, and everything in between. Some felt I emphasized too much difference, and others felt I was not being different enough in contrasting Dharmic/Abrahamic worldviews. It was a rewarding experience to hear solid independent evaluations by experts and to interact with them. This kind of feedback and scholarly interaction has helped the success of each of my books.  
  
Within a year, the American Academy of Religion's annual conference (with about 10,000 scholars attending) had a special panel discussion dedicated to my book. The AAR has a group called *Society of Hindu-Christian Studies* and this panel served as its annual event for that year. The panel chair, Prof Francis Clooney, is the head of Hinduism Studies at Harvard. Separately from this event, he also held a debate with me on my book at Univ of Mass, Dartmouth. Though a Catholic and a Jesuit, in one event he said this was a book every Christian scholar must read in order to understand important issues about their own religion from an outsider's perspective.  
  
Last night, I proposed to Prof Varakhedi by phone that I would be willing to have a video conference to discuss issues pertaining to my book with any audience in India. This could also include Ganesh, his students and others. I often use Skype or Google Hangout for such things. People should be able to have productive conversations on serious matters concerning our heritage.  
  
We Indians should hold debates, reviews, discussions in India on topics of broad interest, especially topics with controversy. There is no reason to turn this into acrimony. Nor is there anyone too big to be criticized, i.e. no need for idolatry of any scholar no matter how renowned.  
  
Finally, my detailed response to Pollock should be completed in a few days. I want to send the draft to a few scholars for their peer review in confidence. I have a few lined up, but I am open to more persons who find this interesting. Those interested may write to me privately at: [RajivMal...@gmail.com](). I have always benefited from well-intended critical feedback.  
  
Regards,  
Rajiv
