Sir,

Discussion threads on beef etc has already been in BVP database. I remember I had joined the Group and as a learner requested on certain vedic interpretation (not related to beef) but whole was dragged to beef, and thereafter, I started refraining from interaction for some time.

  

In case of TBFS. discussion, as we know attack and counter attack have part of argumentative tradition, but most of the arguments given so far do not focus on core surface, either are with certain presuppositions or predefined hit surface... it is necessary to focus on the framework itself and the semantic shift. Comparing at the finished output level does not touch the very foundation on which a healthy argumentation rests and arguments remain arguments for their own sake.

  

It is good to see the new thread which permits interested ones to interact.here.

Best Wishes

Sati Shankar
