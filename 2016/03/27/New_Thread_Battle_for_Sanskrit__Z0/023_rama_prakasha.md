This is the ending shloka of Chikitsasthana 1 Adhyaya of Ashtanga Hrudaya of Vagbhata. It is recommending mantras for healing.  
  
ओषधयो मणयश्च **सुमन्त्राः**  
 साधु-गुरु-द्विज-दैवत-पूजाः ।  
प्रीतिकरा मनसो विषयाश्च  
 **घ्नन्त्यपि** विष्णु-कृतं **ज्वरमु**ग्रम् ॥ १७७ ॥  
  
I am no Pandit in Ayurveda. I just want this doubt clarified by Pandits who know whole context of shlokas.
