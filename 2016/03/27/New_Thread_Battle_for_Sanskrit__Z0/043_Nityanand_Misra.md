I have started reading the book now, and am making my notes. Will take my sweet time to finish it and then possibly write a review (if I do, it will be uploaded on [academia.org](http://academia.org)).

  

For an important book like this, I expected much better typesetting and composition (responsibility of the publisher Harper Collins, but typesetting is by Saanvi Graphics Noida). A couple of quick remarks:

  

The worst thing a typesetter can do to put off the reader is changing the book font midway (this is a schoolboy error in typesetting), and that is exactly what happens on the last line of page 17 till the third line of page 18 ("He had visited the US .... superior to Indian ones") where Adobe Jensen 11 pt is replaced by a different font in larger size. Seems the book was composed in a WYSIWYG editor and the paragraph was inserted by copy-pasting from a source which used a different font.

  

The notes at the back (and there are a lot) are easy to read if one is reading the book sequentially, but God help those who skip some pages (e.g. to refer to chapter 4 which the ) and then turn back to check a note, because .... the notes are renumbered from 1 in every chapter and the Notes appendix (which runs into 50 pages) does not have the chapter name in the header! So flip back and forth 2 or 3 pages in the Notes appendix to check the chapter in the Notes appendix, then go back to the page you were reading and the index to see which chapter's note you are looking for, then flip more pages to locate the note. Not renumbering the note at start of every chapter or printing the chapter name in heading would have made the life of a reader much better.

  

I promise the review (if at all I write) will be as punctilious (if not more) as the comments above.
