Dear Rajiv Ji  
  
You have cleared your position on the question raised about your book. If you have the quotation readily available with you which is referred in the book may pl be furnished. We will discuss.  
  
But, now what Prakash Ji is aksing something different, which will be taken up for discussion. In case this matter is not directly connected with your work, fine. Still this independent question could be a matter of discussion in the list. We do not dictate the thread.  
  
Any queries about your book will also be discussed if somebody is interested. However this thread will continue with the question raised by ram prakash Ji.  
  
With best regards  
Shrivarakhedi
