Dear Srinivasa ji,  
  

*Quotes from my book*: Mantra is discussed only for purva-paksha of Pollock. He maintains that things like mantra, yajna etc have served brahmin domination and oppression over Dalits/women. He pejoratively refers to mantras as "hymnology", and says these lacked benefits to wider society, and were meant to assert the power of the elites over the masses.  
  
My response covers many items besides just mantras. The relevant quote on mantras is as follows, and it has *nothing to do with healing*. I mention mantras in two contexts: usage in meditation and yajna.  
  
**"The Battle For Sanskrit", Pages 21-22*:* "Many of them \[i.e. mantras\] are used for specific meditation practices. Their importance derives from the large body of evidence accumulated by practitioners over the centuries that they produce effects which ordinary sounds do not. Sanskrit is therefore indispensable for adhyatmika purposes (inner sciences) and the pursuit of embodied knowing. (For adhyatmika and embodied knowing as I define them, see Malhotra 2011.) Many rituals and practices involve Sanskrit mantras chanted with specific intonations and in precise steps. Hindus subscribe to the efficacy of these rituals, and consider the Sanskrit mantras used therein as non-translatable. By this, I mean they cannot be replaced with synonymous words even in Sanskrit, leave alone words of another language that might appear to have a similar meaning."
