**1) Topic:- \[The following quotation of Sri Shatavadhani Ganesh\]**  
  
**Appendix B. Untenable Arguments**  
  
 \[Sri Rajiv Malhotra says----\]  
  
 “Meditation mantras…produce effects which ordinary sounds do not.” (p. 21; also see pp. 32, 11)  
  
\[Sri Satavadhani Ganesh's comments on this as follows---\]  
  
This is at best a theological argument of a mimamsaka. If mantras truly had healing effects, why did our tradition evolve from the daiva-vyapasraya of the Atharva Veda (which believed that certain chants and spells could cure a disease) into the yukti-vyapasraya of Ayurveda (which relies completely on observation; it doesn’t speak about even the healing effects of yogasanas, let alone mantra)? In fact, Vagbhata laughs at people who seek proof for medicines in mantras.  
  
  
2) Doubt:-  
  
I have a doubt here. Did the tradition understand that the daivya-vyapashraya chikitsa of the Atharva Veda is ineffective and hence wrong? I came across a quotation in Vagbhata (Ashtanga Hridaya, Chikitsa-sthana, 1-177), which recommends the use of Mantras to heal diseases. I am requesting the scholars who has studied the whole context of it to help me clear my doubt.  
  
Do others like Sushruta and Charaka along with Vagbhata really laugh at daiva-vyapashraya Chikitsa in their works? But in the above stated quotation Vagbhata is not laughing at, on the contrary is respectfully recommending it. We find even in the present society many people healing diseases with Mantra Shakti. I myself have seen several people who are alive even now and capable of healing and have healed many. I have heard from the learned people that when Mantras are recieved from a Siddha Guru and practised with shraddha and the neccessary discipline, they become effective. Not recieving from a Siddha Guru, not following the discipline or taking the Mantra from a book - all these are said to be the reasons for ineffectiveness of a Mantra. Does Ayurveda Shastra reject Mantra Sadhana as fake against the living examples of its effectiveness? This is my sincere doubt.  
  
3. My expectation:-  
  
I only wish to have my doubt cleared and have no intention to refute others.  
  
This question pertains to the thread that is already running hence I don't think a seperate thread is required. I don't expect this to be a very big disscussion but some letters which clarify this doubt convincingly.
