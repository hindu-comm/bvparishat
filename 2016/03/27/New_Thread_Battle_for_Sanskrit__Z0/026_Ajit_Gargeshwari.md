Even I don’t have an answer why are we endlessly discussing this book. A book is a book that’s all I can say. Members are at liberty to discuss the book the So called Battle for Sanskrit or Purva paksha without any siddhanta That was what I was trying to point to high lighten. Why western Indology western thoughts have impact on all aspects of our life should we have a relook at that ?. Let me also say its left to members if they want to make this list devoted to One single book or can more books and authors too be reviewed and discussed. Thanks

A question. There are millions of books related to Sanskrit and no one can write a review for each one. Why did Shatavadhani ji write a review on this book. Perhaps he thinks that this book has a huge effect on Sanskrit studies and so he thinks it important to write a review on it. But then Western indology also has a huge effect on Sanskrit studies in India. Does anyone know of reviews written by him on Western scholars. I honestly don't know the answer.
