Namaste

  

In understanding Vagbhata-sloka:

The technicality of the upasarga -अपि should be clearly noticed.

  

The translation has to be made as two lines:

  

**First one is a plain assertive statement: mantra..**.. घ्नन्ति विष्णु-कृतं ज्वरमुग्रम् -destroys/ cures jvara caused by ' hetu'= causatives technically marked as ' vishnu' in Ayurveda - diagnostics (- it is not the jvara attributed to the anger of a god or trinity marked with human fragilityZeus / Indra - like under the same name!).

Such naming of diseases by name of Gods and Goddesses is not uncommon in Ayurveda. To learn this, one needs to go beyond sanskrit learning models governed by conversation , Monier-Williams dictionary assisted translation and popular belief of what all ayurveda vaidya ( ignorant of other shaastras like jyotisha, tantra, veda and aagama) promises to deliver!

  

This is because Ayurveda vaidyas want to be more appreciated by Hippocratus oath governed medical practitioners rather than being being true to Ayurveda as Upa-Veda.

>   

  

**Second one is emphasizing the efficacy of mantras for all the jvaras** technically grouped in to the class of विष्णु-कृतं अपि /  
विष्णु-कृतं ज्वरमुग्रम् अपि - mantras .. Cure jvaras caused by ' vishnu' factors which have become aggravated / jvaras of similar category.

  

Scholars to please clarify
