Thanks Rama Prakasha Ji. Here is the verse with two commentaries in the NSP 1939 edition

  

<https://archive.org/stream/Ashtanga.Hridaya.of.Vagbhata#page/n761/mode/1up>

  

Indeed, Vagbhata seems to say that good Mantra-s destroy acute *jvara* (which I guess refers to fever in Ayurveda?).

  

Would be good to know the other quote also (where he “laughs at people who seek proof for medicines in mantras”).

  

Perhaps the experts on Ayurveda can help reconcile the two.
