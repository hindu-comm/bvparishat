Namaste

( i am responding on this thread, as it took reference to the rebuttal of Shatavadhani Ganesh by Aditi Bannerji. ).

  

1\. I agree with Rajiv Malhotras position in the post below, which is also the essence of Aditi Bannerji's statement reading: 'So even if I don’t know Sanskrit it is my duty to defend my Samskriti irrespective of pramanas.' More so when one had the privilege of working in the innermost sacred spaces where Samskrutham and Yoga - Veda- Tantra- Ayurveda can not be dismembered for part and partial studies.

  

Samskrutham means refined , unified and cultured to emerge as one organic whole. Has it emerged so? Or is it likely to emerge so as this battle seems to be escalating in pitch?

  

2\. Having said this the exchange of mails in this thread( like the previous one) is like the famous debate about the nature of elephant! ( by six blind people or six brilliant people)- each one suffering and stuck to part and partial visions of the bigger issue: Battle for Sanskrit? WHY? BY Whom? For What goal?

  

3\. Rajiv Malhotra is clear in seeing the need to put up Battle for Sanskrit in the ' Pollock focus' - which is just a mark for shooting. The larger problem is why funds of Samskruth anchored and Samskruth loving people is going to the teams which deliver exactly the opposite. Rajivs works have brilliantly exposed the ati-rathi and maha-rathis of this Academic contemporary Kurukshetra, the global issue battle fought from Beyond- India base. The final price and prize is still India, Sanskrit and Yoga! So the request to and expectation sought from Indian traditional scholars/ institutions is of two kinds:

  

\- can you recognize the challenge of current period when battles are fought from satellite channels and not on horse driven chariot with bow and arrows to be powered by mantras? This issue is acknowledged and appreciated by Shayavadhani Ganesh also. Thus there is a concurrence on goal.

  

\- can you contribute your might to support, be a team member to fight this battle in a specific mode for which strategic leadership is give in Rajiv Malhotras pioneering works? This issue is contentious; It seems Shatavadhani Ganesh has difficulties to work in this frame sought by Rajiv Malhotra. This is typical of the pre- kurukshetra battle divisive debate in Duryodhanas strategic team on the issue of who should be 'First Commander in Chief: Bhishma, Drona, Karna!'. While each one had their Dharma, strategies and duties, the outcome of war was Dharma-Samsthapanaa as some one beyond these people had made the decision!

  

4\. While the primary issue of Rajiv Malhotra for the book TBFS has been repeatedly clarified and the focus is ' SP centric poorva-paksha'

The debates and posted issues on ' mantra- efficacy in Ayurveda, Yajna, Meditation studies' are not the main stream issues for this thread. And Shatavadhani Ganeshs TBFS review, as long as it has supported the main issue of battle with SP centric analysis(-with alternate and supplementary issues), i dont find any reason to get engaged in sidetracking issues on ' mantra- efficacy'.

  

If 'mantra-efficacy' needs irreplaceable Sanskrit, Rajiv is right.

  

If ' mantra-efficacy' is at best a theological hypothesis, better invest on investigation of Truth of this claim, which will be the challenge for Vagbhatta- Ayurveda-Vaidyas needing ' mantra-japa' prescription for curing ' jvara'. The beliefs, personal experiences, faith, antiquity of tradition, high esteem for Rishis of yore- will not be a substitute for objective research. This is where Bioy Mishra, Ganesh and many others come in. They are not looking at language per se; but combining and mixing it with application in specific streams of texts and prescriptions in practical disciplines. Rajiv is pointing that he has concurrence with these observations, but he discusses them in different chapters and contexts, as a part of his strategy.

  

How is this influencing SP debate ? Because SP ( and the like) translations are projecting inaccurate painting of traditional texts and practices locked in the intricacies of Sanskrit language.

  

If Ayurveda- Chikitsaa does not need Mantra- in-Sanskrit( like many other world religions do ), let them use a latin or arabic chant to heal ' jvara'! Then dont ask the question why Vagbhatta prescribed only Sanskrit veda-mantras? This is where ' one needs to make ones own siddhanta also as poorva paksha' to test its strength. It is this part, where Shatavadhani Ganesh and other indian institutions have a very good repertoire of learning, tools and ambience for research ! Albeit the ' money ( of Murthys kind) to support it and the passion of a sage- scientist to explore'.

  

This is the ' painful situation' to which reactions have come from Aditi Bannerjee, ( whom i know well from different context). She is bright and sharp and is asking the right question , which needs to be answered. She is right in taking up sides in the statement-'

So even if I don’t know Sanskrit it is my duty to defend my Samskriti irrespective of pramanas.'

  

In other words, Ye learned Saints and Scholars of Sankrit, please provide me just enough tools and supplies related to the ' Sanskrit' -needed for a soldier on the battle- front to fight , return alive, unhurt and safe. And please keep all your Strategy- Scenario detailing to your private board rooms if you can! If you are not aware, what all you consider sacred has been plundered and raped for 300 years when Ye people were lost blissfully in the memory lanes enjoying the ' glory of the past and belief of invincibility and immortality'!

  

As my good friend Dr. Yadu Moharir keeps repeating: you can not debate or engage with an issue unless you acknowledge it. The very fact that traditional scholars have taken cognizance of the need for 'poorvapaksha made in TBFS', there is no reason for internal fight.

  

What next? Again as Dr. Yadu says: find the viniyoga for Sanskrit for its survival and growth on global platform, by coming out of history centric back looking walk.

  

So can this thread come to a conclusion on sending out the patient called 'Sanskrit - freed from its jvara' from this diagnostic lab in a walking fit state to the world outside?? Any mantra for this?
