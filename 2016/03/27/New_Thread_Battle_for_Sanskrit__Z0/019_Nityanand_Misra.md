Ajit Ji

  

Rajiv Ji was has not answered the question by Rama Prakasha, but neither did did he claim that he was answering the question. He was stating his views on the context of the question, and he stated this at the beginning of his response as "*The context in which this is said in my book must be clear first*." One may agree or disagree with his views.

  

To answer Sh. Rama Prakasha's question we have see the original text of Vagbhatta: both where he “laughs at people who seek proof for medicines in mantras”(as Hari Ravikumar and Shatavadhani Ganesh Ji write) and the place where he“recommends the use of Mantras to heal diseases.”

  

Kidn regards, Nityanand
