his is the ending shloka of Chikitsasthana 1 Adhyaya of Ashtanga Hrudaya of Vagbhata. It is recommending mantras for healing.  
\>\>  
\>\> ओषधयो मणयश्च सुमन्त्राः  
\>\>  साधु-गुरु-द्विज-दैवत-पूजाः ।  
\>\> प्रीतिकरा मनसो विषयाश्च  
\>\>  घ्नन्त्यपि विष्णु-कृतं ज्वरमुग्रम् ॥ १७७ ॥  
\>\>  
\>\>  

\> Indeed, Vagbhata seems to say that good Mantra-s destroy acute jvara (which I guess refers to fever in Ayurveda?).  
\>  

Vagbhata here refers not any acute fever, but वैष्णवज्वर - विष्णु-कृतं ज्वर which is additional benefit in addition to being प्रीतिकरा मनसो विषयाश्च as I can read the verse.

Others may take any acute jvara. There is शैवज्वर also as have heard. Many other types of jvara, in addition to phyisical वात, पित्त and कफ. I am also not Ayurveda pandit, but this twofold division of jvara I had heard from my friends.

Scholars clarify further.
