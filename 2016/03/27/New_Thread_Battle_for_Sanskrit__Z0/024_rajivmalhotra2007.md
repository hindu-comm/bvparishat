*Response*:  

-   This thread explicitly exists to discuss my book.  
-   I have categorically stated that in my book, mantra is not discussed
    for healing/Ayurveda. Its significance in my book is for a different
    purpose having to do with what Pollock writes against mantra. -   Therefore, Ganesh's criticism concerning mantra's role in healing is
    *irrelevant* to my book -   The fact that mantra in my book is not healing related can be
    verified by anyone.

Therefore, the separate issue on mantra and healing is irrelevant to this thread.
