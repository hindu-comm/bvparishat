I wish to thank Nityanand ji and all others who make critical inputs that are going to improve the book as it evolves. I have passed on all such comments to the publisher. They are pretty quick to fix these for new print runs. Nowadays publishers do short print runs of a few thousand copies each, and hence they can make changes rapidly when pointed out.  
  
I organize the critical feedback I receive into three categories, as follows:  
  
A) *Style issues*: Things like copy editing, language style, etc. are publisher issues. I pass these on to their copy editor.  
  
B) *Purva-paksha and thesis at Pollock-specific meta-level*: This is my focus in this book. This is not about generic Indology (too abstract). Nor is it at the specific verse level (too minute). It is in between these levels. *His meta-level framing is very different than other Indological schools*. I want to explain Pollock to those who are not Pollock experts. This is an enormous task given his opaque style, convoluted language, contradictions and apparent contradictions, heavy use of other western theories and scholarly works, subtle assumptions that are often hidden, etc.  
  
C) *Uttara-paksha and specific verse level analysis of Pollock*: I have written that this is where traditional scholars who know more than I do must step in and do their job.  
  
In 'B' I want to point out where the issues lie, the foundational errors in his framework and assumptions, etc. But then *I call upon traditional scholars to step in and do 'C*'. I constantly say this in the book - things like "Following is another red flag I am raising that will trouble many traditional scholars ....xyz." In other words, after reading closely some 3,000 pages of Pollock, I tried to summarize what I found to be quite important for our team to examine. Now it is up to them. This is where I handed over to Prof Kannan, and he is taking this forward in a systematic manner with numerous traditional scholars joining his team. I wish them success because only with their responses can we take back the adhikara from western Indologists.  
  
The western academy has ultra specialists organized into large inter-disciplinary teams. I have participated in, monitored and analyzed closely many such teams in the USA for the past 25 years. For instance, Infinity Foundation used to be the sponsor of the annual Indology Roundtable Conf at Harvard convened by Witzel - back in the 1990s. Every year they brought together (from India, Pakistan, Europe, Japan, USA, etc.) several dozen scholars in disciplines ranging from Sanskrit, linguistics/philology, archeology, art history, politics/social sciences, anthropology, genetics, etc. Their inter-disciplinary coordination is impressive. I stopped funding them when I realized they were controlling the big picture interpretation and synthesis, while putting scholars from India/Pakistan into silos as mere suppliers of isolated information. So I started challenging their framework and eventually we parted company.  
  
We must do this for our side with our drishti - i.e. bring in serious thinkers with different kinds of specialties. Have them work together. Someone can decode Pollock in a specific area, while another person can give a rejoinder to Pollock.  
  
Similar projects need to be done for each major western Indologist. Pollock is just the start, and there are many others to critique one by one. This is a 10 year program. The impact will be long term.  
  
My desire is that scholars should join Kannan's team in whatever capacity they can. How they work together is up to him and the scholars. As these good scholars take control, I take leave this topic of work, and move on ...  
  
Thanks and regards,
