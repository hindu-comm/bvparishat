What part of 40-86 and 40-88 indicates that even Vedas are overridden?

  

40-86 says that in the matter of निर्मन्त्र, it does not matter who the speaker is. But Vedas are not निर्मन्त्र.

  

40-88 talks about ऋषिप्रणीत and सुभाषित. From a traditional point of view, Vedas are neither ऋषिप्रणीत (they are ऋषिदृष्ट) nor सुभाषित as they are revealed scriptures.

  

So do 40-86 and 40-88 really imply that later discoveries/scholarship overrides Vedas? Does any translation or commentary say so?
