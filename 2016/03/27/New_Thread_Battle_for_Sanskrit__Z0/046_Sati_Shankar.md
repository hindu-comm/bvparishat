Dear Sri Rajiv ji

  

Your last line in your concluding post above reads,

"My desire is that scholars should join Kannan's team in whatever capacity they can. How they work together is up to him and the scholars. ***As these good scholars take control, I take leave this topic of work, and move on ..."***

***

Sir,

The work being undertaken, to "fight intellectually and strategically" against well founded establishment with all the modernweaponry and when we haveto look forward for cooperation between specialists in diverse disciplines it must be kept in mind that this whole "endeavor" will need a core team which will coordinate between the specialists, who will come , join, contribute their intellectual capital and may remain or leave after finishing their work. Since thisendeavorhas a long term perspective, a "stable" seat for coordination of activities is a must.

Since you have taken the first steps , to my mind, it will NOT be wise for you and beneficial for the whole mission if you, "***take leave this topic of work, and move on ..." .***

***

I think,*Your very presence is a must.... though specialists will be taking care of their well coordinated tasks.  
*

*It is therefore necessary to create an "independent" core team which must be efficient in "Coordination and Management" first.*

Hope you will think on this aspect and be there at each and every stage.......  

  

Regards

Yours

Sati Shankar
