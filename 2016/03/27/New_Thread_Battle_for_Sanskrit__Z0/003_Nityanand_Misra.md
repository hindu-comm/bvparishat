Dear Sati Shankar Ji

  

I mentioned the debate between C V Vaidya and S D Satwalekar only as an example of how both sides of a hotly debated topic were published in the same magazine brought out by M K Gandhi. In a similar way it would be good to see this debate in an edited/reviewed journal which can provide a common neutral forum for both arguments and counter-arguments.

  

Kind regards, Nityanand
