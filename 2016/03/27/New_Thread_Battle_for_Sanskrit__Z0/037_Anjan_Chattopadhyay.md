If vina tarkena is to be taken as the gold standard, we should stop taking allopathic medicine. Nobody knows clearly what the medicines are doing. Sometime drugs are taken back from market when people observe bad effects. The tarka for English medicine use seems to be only statistical (which is not a perfect science).  
  
When the above is the case, how can we call only devavyapashray to be against yukti vyapashray?  
  
Does charak or sushrut say anywhere that devavyapashray is opposite to yukti? If not, then, devavyapashray has its own yukti. Dev vyapashray even today is used in Kerala and many other places to treat mental illness, psychiatric condition etc.  
  
The verbal gymnastics of Krishna ji saying that devavyapashray is vestige is because of preconceptions.
