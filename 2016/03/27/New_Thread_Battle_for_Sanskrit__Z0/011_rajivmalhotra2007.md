Dear Sunil ji,  

-   Many Western Indologists work hard to create a negative brand for
    such things, and Indian Left eagerly spreads that view into media,
    etc. But at the same time, in the very same US universities, other
    departments are doing research to appropriate new "discoveries"
    based on Indian techniques. -   In USA, the National Institute of Health has funded research on the
    effects of mantra meditation. In particular, Maharishi Int'l
    University in Iowa told me that they have data proving specific
    benefits - they will publish in academic journals when completed. -   It is possible that HR Nagendra's VYASA might also have studies on
    this. -   Numerous cognitive science and neurosciences researchers in USA are
    investigating this area using Functional MRI. -   The Tuscon Conference on Consciousness Studies has been at this work
    for the past two decades and I have been monitoring them for a
    future book on how this is being rapidly appropriated in USA while
    in India little is being done. See:
    <http://memo.ahsc.arizona.edu/index.cfm/memos/view/24161/0d5fc7fc2b2c06e4>
    I have interacted with many of the regular participants at the
    Tuscon conference, and in the 1990s we used to sponsor some
    researchers there. -   Yet in India this is considered a suspicious topic to discuss. One
    day it will get re-imported back to India as a Made in America
    breakthrough. Then our people will champion it as the latest
    thing.  

regards,  
rajiv
