These are my simplistic answers at outset, Scholars will give a detailed explanation.

I do not know if there is any chronological data on the various स्मृती like Vyasa,Parashara, Yajgnavalkya,Gauthama, Manu etc etc.

The sages quoted were not contemporaries. P.V. Kane's History of Sanskrit Dharma Shastra and related books might provide answers.

Secondly why or for what reasons did sampradhaya by earlier Munis/Rishis who had guided the then society become defunct?

Munis guided the Society then and even now for they speak of core value and Dharma which is valid for all times. Society does change gradually over a period of time.

Do we not revive this system along with revival of Sanskrit with eternal wisdom as guiding principles for humanity and a later section with ever evolving needs of a changing society?

Yes we do, Vedas are immutable where as smritis are not immutable.
