The reason for me to find these were triggered by the ongoing incidents in the country and checking if there is any solution that can come up to dispel them  
Two major activities that are  
Revival of Sanskrit by Govt  
and  
Some people burning Manusmrti in Delhi.  
Bhat Sir, you say this is updated as last as 18th century, which is that you are referring to?

Also I'm upset and sorrowful for what is happening to our culture due to misinformation and superstitious rituals and practice that go unchecked in the name of authentic rituals. While it may not be possible to remove them from happening, at least if there are codified manuals which exist as beacons for the public at large to take to and prevent them being hoodwinked by the pseudo pundits, lot of face saving can happen.

The tendency to see where is it prescribed in any authentic text will only happen if they are reviewed from time to time and incorporated with the needs of a changing society. But if the texts are considered redundant then no one can blame the society for it.
