विद्वद्भ्यो नमः।

मुनीनामुत्तरोत्तरं प्रमाणम् is true only of Vyakarana, not all Sastras.

Late Mahamahopadhyaya Padmasri Prof. Pullela Ramachandrudu wrote a modern Smriti called Kaundinyasmriti. It is not that these are not composed - the question is about how many follow them.

In History some like Kabir had followers for a time. Others like Nanak ended up starting a new religion.
