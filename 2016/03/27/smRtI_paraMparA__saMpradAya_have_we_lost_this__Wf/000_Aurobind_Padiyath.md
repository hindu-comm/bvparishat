I do not know if there is any chronological data on the various स्मृती like Vyasa,Parashara, Yajgnavalkya,Gauthama, Manu etc etc.  
Secondly why or for what reasons did sampradhaya by earlier Munis/Rishis who had guided the then society become defunct?  
As we all have heard मुनीनां उत्तरोत्तरं प्रमाणं when was the last one created and by whom?  
Do we not revive this system along with revival of Sanskrit with eternal wisdom as guiding principles for humanity and a later section with ever evolving needs of a changing society?
