Thank you both for the replies and also the attachment. Even though the chronological range is too wide to come to any conclusion for fixing the उत्तरमुनि from the पूर्व muni,  
Dr. Anil, from your website,

"SMṚTIS  
Smṛti means that which is remembered. Many Ṛṣis and scholars studied the four Vedas and created Smṛti texts with their interpretations.

Among many, the following 18 Smṛtis are considered the most important.

Manu, Yājñavalkya, Parāśara,  
Viṣṇu, Dakṣa, Samvarta,  
Vyāsa, Harita, Śātātapa,  
Vasiṣṭha,Yama, Āpastamba,  
Gautama, Devala, Śankha-Likhita,  
Uśana, Atri and Śaunaka

Are all these mentioned Smriti texts available? Is not Satatap and Apastamba etc classified as Brahmanas rather than Smriti?

I'm also looking forward to hearing others on the need for a revised and updated नूतनस्मृति to which the current generation can look up to.
