Stop being too sensitive.  
I remember your recent post which is searching for typing professional.  

To which Shastra does it belong ?

Now your current reply which Shastra does it belong to?,

If you say, that post doesn't disturb,

My answer is,  
Your current post is disturbing us for persuading to stop write even though when a madhaandha is ill treating a scholar.

What made you to type the current reply ? The same thing which made us to send mails.
