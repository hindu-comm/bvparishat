**Dear moderators of this group,**

**pl. ask this RM to sit quitely. otherwise remove him for his personal attack on scholars. "**Engage in scholarly debate.

  

Personal attacks, writing in capital letters quoting irrelevant texts, mindless extrapolation is not allowed**" being the policy of BVP RM should be qualified to be disqualified. I do not understand why Shrinivas Varakhedi or Ajit Gargeshvari are not telling RM to stop this nonsense while they are advising Krishnaprasad the same. why they are even afraid to mention the name of RM. I hope sanity will prevail in bvp.**

***here is an account of RM's arrogant personal attack on SG (My reply in Red)***

***RM. My response to Shri Shatavadhani R. Ganesh: Abstract***

***  
***

I just read Shri R. Ganesh's critique of my book,*The Battle For Sanskrit*. I am going to develop a detailed point by point response in the next few days. But meanwhile, I wanted to say a few things to prevent hasty judgments by anyone:  
  
I wish to start by thanking him for showing so much interest in my work. It is a very useful criticism for various reasons. For one thing, all such responses, regardless of their substance or reliability, serve to wake up the traditional scholars and compel them to pay more attention to the prevailing intellectual battlefield.

  

it seems RM does not notice that english knowing traditional scholars have been working for long for this purpose. Being a member of BVP RM should be knowing it. being american he does not know situation in india. Does RM think traditionalists who do not read english are awakened by English review of Ganesh? or he is thinking that Ganesh himself is awakened by rajiv's book? in both cases he is wrong. If he thinks he awakening traditional scholars by books, then also he is wrong. nobody traditionalist is reading these english books. IF RM is serious about awakening then he should establish english course colleges for traditional scholars and inturn should learn sanskrit so he can understand for what he is going to battle.

  

Furthermore, such criticisms also give me a chance to take my book’s debates deeper. His criticism is well-intended, and he seems to want to “outsmart” my purva-paksha of Pollock by offering his own. That is helpful and welcome because it expands the discourse.

  

who is wanting to outsmart whos purvapaksha? is RM doing purvapaksa of pollock. what does it mean? one is supposed to do siddhanta opposing his opponent. Is RM doing purvapaksa to be negated by pollock or somebody?

it seems RM is ignorant of theory ofpurvapaksa, and siddhanta. pity. He is going to battle, without knowing what is purvapasa and siddhanta.  

  

  

However,*there are numerous serious errors, misunderstanding and contradictions, both in substance and in the logic used by him.*  
  
For one thing, he does not seem to have read much (if anything) of Pollock directly, and uses my work as secondary access to the subject matter. (Ironically, he criticizes me for relying upon secondary works on Sanskrit texts.) This deprives him of the full context of Pollock's writings that I am evaluating.



RM should know that it is SG's review of RM and not of pollock. hence it is enough if he read RM.

  

He also lacks an adequate understanding of the broader Western idiom and theories in which Pollock's work is couched. It is misleading (though a common bad habit) to surgically pluck out a sentence here and there and rely solely on it. Pollock's work has to be understood*holistically*first, and it becomes clear that Ganesh has not taken the time to do that. My detailed response will show this shortcoming of Ganesh in specific cases.

  

**if RM understand all these things he should refute them. and not waste time of scholars by attacking them  
**  

Besides his inadequate understanding of both Pollock’s and my writings, Ganesh is also making some*illogical*statements. Ironically, these are made with the stated purpose of exposing "Malhotra's pseudo-logic". I will explain this in my detailed article.  
  
**I will also argue against Ganesh's understanding of our tradition in specific instances**, the area where he should be much more qualified than I am. No doubt he has immense memory and citation expertise. I admire him greatly for these accomplishments. But just as an ipod machine can recite millions of things without understanding them, I will show where he lacks proper understanding of our traditional worldview on some of the very topics he discusses in this article.

  

it is typical american steriotype of calling pandits as Ipods/tape recorders. Does Ipod explain anything that is not fed into it? accusing SG Without showing particular thing that is not understood by SG is typical to RM. 

  

Moreover RM says he is for battling for Sanskrit. What is that sanskrit?, is it a book shelved in LOC library? Sanskrit means the living tradition of sanskrit scholarship, it is Ganesh, it is devadatta patil, it is mani dravid or whoever living/continuing/passing that knowledge to next generation. if RM battles with SG, it means RM is battling with sanskrit (not for Sanskrit) for his own sake or something nobody knows. whom he considers as sanskrit schloars? are they only 132 people who supported Murti petition? and all others are in enemy camp? what is this nonsense. RM should learn to respect schlarship. न हि वन्ध्या विजानाति गुर्वीं प्रसववेदनाम् is an apt description of RM.  
  
Finally, I will address the issue he starts out with to frame me negatively in the eyes of readers: whether I am qualified to do such a project. Our tradition has encouraged and even valorized innovative thinkers who seemed to lack formal training, but who successfully challenged those with eminent “credentials”. This way to brand me right up front is an instance of his arrogance, and in my full article I shall dwell upon the merits of a given individual’s background. I will explain what exactly the project I have started is about (which he does not seem to grasp properly), and my relevant experience and expertise in doing it; I will let the reader decide for himself.  

  

it should attract the moderaters to put RM in moderation. I do not understand why Aklujkar, Dipak Bhattacharya, VN Jha, Radhavallabh Tripathi, Ramanuja Devanathan, Shrinivasa Varakhedi etc. eminent members of this forum are silent when RM is abusing scholarship here. न सा सभा यत्र न सन्ति वृद्धाः, न ते वृद्धा ये न प्रवदन्ति धर्मम्। one should not destroy the decorum of this august forum. no non scholar should be let to abuse scholars. is BVP founded for arrogants like RM? founders should answer this question. sorry for making sharp remarks. but mocking scholars is not acceptable. one should learn to respect scholars.  

  

he is abusing the scholarly community as whole. see his twitter

  

BEWARE! Western Indology strategy now is to buy out traditional scholars & have them do the infighting with us. Divide swadeshi & defeat  
<https://twitter.com/rajivmessage/status/713342278010593281>  

  

RM should specify who are these scholars? otherwise he should withdraw his statement or he should be thrown out of this forum.

  

In fact, I will question whether Ganesh has the required intellectual training in specific areas of competence that are necessary for*this*kind of work that I have undertaken. I doubt he has much real-world experience in the global intellectual kurukshetra, which is not to be confused with meetings of “like-minded people” exchanges accolades sitting in India. For the global battlefield, what would be the relevant experience equivalent to his 1,000 avadhanas?

  

How RM is qualified to question the intellectual training of others when himself is unqualified? what kind of real world experience needed rebuke Pollock's theories? it is the english language and sharp intellect. Questioning somebody's intellect rather than refuting his theory is not a way of debate in BVP. if RM needs more time to refute SG, then he should take it and then only write here. why should he comment unnecessarity wasting time of scholars by posting "I will refute in few days" why dont moderaters take note this nonsense.

Why is raking the issue of 1000 avadhanas? is it a matter of debate here? did SG pointed it it to substanciate his critique of RM? it is purely personal attack.

  

Yes, we in india have luxury of accolades of likeminded people in India. is it our sin to sit and lecture in India? If RM wants it, then he should have studied sanskrit from childhood and lectured here instead of going to US for dollors. it is nonsense to abuse us.

  

  

I submit it is the experience of going out of one’s comfort zone, and into the line of enemy fire, surrounded by a hundred or more opponents, and being able to tilt the discourse in one’s favor, and come out stronger for the next encounter. I have had a very large number of these live experiences in audiences where I was the only Indian or Hindu, where there is blatant intimidation and mockery, where every attempt has been made to belittle our identity, and where I had nothing personal to gain and all my reputation and social credibility to lose. I have also had a large number of very direct online encounters with some of the toughest and most renowned Hinduphobics. Mere theoretical knowledge is not enough to be qualified in this battlefield – as I am sure Ganesh will agree, given that his avadhanas are the field-experience necessary to train him in his domain of expertise.

  

It seems RM has won the hundred world wars and he needs hero's reception everywhere.

  

  

My point is that these are two different types of yajnas Ganesh and I have done. They entail two distinct battlefields, with different kinds of opponents and issues. In my case, this entailed quitting my thriving professional life in order to dedicate myself for 25 years to do this with full intensity. I will explain in my article what I have learned that is critical for the present undertaking, and how the lack of this type of yajna is a handicap Ganesh is blissfully oblivious of.  

  

it seem that RM thinks all sanskrit scholars are doing yajna works for pollock's dollors and only RM is doing yajna of this kind. This is the last sin of RM to do in this forum. How is sanskrit is nurtured in india by scholars like SG or like all of us. accusing these as selfish is highly wrong. how foolish and arrogant he is. sorry.  

"Why blissfully oblivious of" a personal attack again should attract moderators wrath.

  

While I am aware of my shortcomings, and explain in my book the necessity for more qualified insiders like Ganesh to join as team players, he does not appreciate his own limitations in this battle. So the appreciation and respect is one-way: I*do*appreciate his value as an intellectual warrior.

  

RM would have not written all this nonsense personal attack, if he has slightest respect of scholarship. how can a person appreciate his own limitations? one can know his limitation.

  

Unfortunately, his view of the kurukshetra is a limited one, having never stepped into it to experience close encounters personally – not in the global arena. This is why he could not be a team leader, being content living on a high pedestal. The kurukshetra we faace required boots on the ground as well as star wars from the sky.

  

it is not a question of who should be a team leader. why RM is personally attacking SG? it is the question of answering questioning. RM as the team leader has befooled the 17549 people who blindfoldedly supported without using their common sense, only to be rebuked by Rohan. what kind of leadership RM is going to give?

  

  

I am preparing a more detailed response to some of the glaring errors in Ganesh's article. I shall do this in the spirit of the Indian tradition to debate opponents with mutual respect. We must set aside issues of personality, who is who in credentials or public image. Let us focus only on facts and arguments.  

  

this is bible in devil's mouth

  

I will be back with a fuller article in a few days.

RM, Pl. dont write the same thing again and again. Moderators pl. remove this man. here are some of his tweets and mails of this man. today he is abusing SG and Shrinivasa Varakhedi because they oppose his views, if somebody opposes RM tomorrow, RM will abuse him also

  

  

.[@shrivarakhedi](https://twitter.com/shrivarakhedi) Why have traditional scholars failed to publish rejoinders to Indian Left/Hinduphobics & why threatened by me? Strange?  

<https://twitter.com/RajivMessage>  

  

It was always open war, but one side was:

Sleeping? Drugged to "feel good"? World negating? Bought off? In-fighting?  

  

BEWARE! Western Indology strategy now is to buy out traditional scholars & have them do the infighting with us. Divide swadeshi & defeat  

  

Yes. Traditional scholar living in silos upset when told to get out of comfort zones, face the real world   

  

Many traditional scholars with huge memory lack ability to do original scholarship, cannot develop a new thesis/argument. Hence stagnation  

  

see here How RM attacks SG personally

<http://beingdifferentforum.blogspot.in/2016/03/response-to-shatavadhani-ganesh.html>  

4.Ganesh says that Rajivji has not gone through the regional texts and scholars, Expecting something from a person, that too who has taken self initiative to inform the masses to study in depth and doing bit and asking him to do more work without helping him in any way is not a way of a Good Scholar what I believe.**\[Rajiv I have worked hard and at great risk to myself to promote the cause of traditional scholarship in the form of Swadeshi Indology. Where has Ganesh been all these decades when he enjoyed all the glamor, credibility and know how to be able to champion the cause of swadeshi Indology? Why not a single purva paksha by him of Western Indology? Why does he not channel his energy in thie matter to target Pollock instead? Has his insecurity become exposed becasue I am asking traditional scholars to get out of their silos?\]**  

  

6.Apart from above , he indeed talk in favour of Rajivs thoughts, also questioning is not a bad thing! I would urge Rajivji also not to dismiss this S Ganesh critics so easily as just a personal review! Indeed we need chanaakya Neeti applied to onboard.**\[Rajiv: I have tried and tried to engage Ganesh for the past decade. Dr TS Mohan in Bangalore who organizes my events has approached Ganesh on numerous occasions. Pls convey your sentiments to him and ask him to stop being so cynical toward anything I do. I want him on our home team and he must stop feeling threatened by my call to action by traditional scholars to do their job i purva paksha.**  
  
**Finally: A hidden war has started in recent weeks by the Western Indologists to co-opt Indian scholars and do their dirty work. One prominent scholr at a prestigious Sanskrit university in Karnataka first endorsed my work and promised to join the purva paksha (on video); but then a couple of days later wrote in an email that criticizing Pollock should be avoided in order to get a few crores from Sudha Murty!!! Wow!\]**  

  

atleast RM should reveal who is that person and how much money he got? what was the cheque no. etc. so we can be carefull about this professor.
