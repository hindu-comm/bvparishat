I don't think these things were said on our platform(Google Group).

So, this doesn't count.

  

Stop, for a second. Write directly to moderators. Why drag other people in this?

  

I was expecting from this Group that it will allow mostly Sanskrit posts related to shAstra-s, which will help us to understand them clearly. Instead of that I've to see people talking about that which is not shAstra. In such condition, I don't thing the name भारतीयविद्वत्परिषद्****will suit anymore.  

  

I suggest that such discussions, which are related to battle for/of Sanskrit, etc., mostly suit Indology Groups. So, please continue this with enthusiasm, but at suitable platform.

  

I'm disturbed to see that this group is going in some other direction.

  

I think that although the Group Samskrita is less active now(because BVP attracted Sanskrit knower more), it will give scholars and learners more opportunity to teach and learn; if BVP doesn't turn it's flow in right direction now.
