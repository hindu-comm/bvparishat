Meghashyam Ji ,  
  
This much I know KSU has nothing got to do with BVP. BVP is not KSU's blog. If Rajiv has dragged KSU or its faculty or staff it for KSU faculty or staff to respond not me or Prof. Varkhedi as a list member.  
  
We don't tell what members need to write or need not write. All discussions are welcome here if we are ready to discuss in a meaningful manner. If you write this way it does not help much. I personally have got nothing to do with any group members blogs views or theories. If one is writing here the rules of posting needs to be followed that is all I can say. Its is now up to members to decide if they can continue this discussions in proper way if they cannot there is nothing much to do than close this thread
