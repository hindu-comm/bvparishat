In this connection I may be permitted by the scholars to refer to the earliest and successful efforts of Prof. SR RAO in deciphering Indus Script. There is a chamber of exhibition by name LIPI VIITTHIKA in the Academic Buildings of Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Tirupati where the exhibits developed by Prof. SR RAO in the process of Deciphering Indus Script are presented. I think a book also has been published by our Vidyapeetha on this subject authored by Prof. SR RAO.

This is for the kind information of the scholars in this thread.
