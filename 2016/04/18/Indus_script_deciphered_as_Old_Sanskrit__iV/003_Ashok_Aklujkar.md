Dear Vidyasankar,

  

I could read the linked article the first time I saw Prof. Iyengar’s post, but all of my subsequent attempts have failed in accessing the article. The author-discoverer’s name began with “Suzanne”. She lives in California. Has a B.A./B.Sc. in anthropology and deciphering scripts is her hobby/passion. Starting by associating sound values with certain parts of signs, she read many signs/seals as containing the names of Vedic gods. Her very first starting point, like Prof. Asko Parpola’s, was association of sound “mīna” with the fish sign, but she seemed to have given up the assumption of a Dravidian language behind the signs/seals in the rest of the article. There was also a reference to Dr. Shrinivasa Kalyanaraman and (what we take to be) Brāhmī script signs in the article.

  

All this is based on a few minutes glancing through. Perhaps Prof. Iyengar can confirm or modify my recollection. When I glanced through the article, I was about to leave for an appointment and so just preserved the link for a closer reading later on.

  

Swarajya seems to have removed the article quickly. Maybe the editor was informed about a copyright issue.

  

a.a.
