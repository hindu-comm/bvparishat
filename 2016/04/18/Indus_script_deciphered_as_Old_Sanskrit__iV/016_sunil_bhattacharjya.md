Dear Paturiji,  
  

Yes, Egbert wrote that book and it was on display at the 2008 WAVES conferencer in Florida. I was cursorily looking at his book, though I was not into the study of Indus script at that time, as my cup was full with other projects. His book is good, but it did not seem to have aroused much interest at that time.  
  
When I was looking at the book, I came to know that the person next to me was Egbert, We talked. He is a nice person and I talked also about my acquaintance with Goethe and Schiler's work through my German friends during my early days. Before parting, he gave a copy of his book to me. We were in contact for sometime after that.  
  

Now coming to the Indus script, I read some years ago that a scholar found that the Indus script is being used by the Santhals in Bihar even now. In front-side walls of their houses they write in the Indus script and probably they have some literary works also in the Indus script in its pristine form. May be other scholars also have come to know that the Indus scriopt is still a living script in certain places in India.  
  

Regards,
