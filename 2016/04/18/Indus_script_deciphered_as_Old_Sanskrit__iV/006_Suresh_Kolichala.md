Indus "script" is a hard problem because we don't know the language used, and we don't know the script. There are no bilingual texts (or Rosetta Stones). That means, anybody can come up with any meanings and ascribe any symbol to it! So far we have Old Sanskrit, Old Tamil, Dravidian, Sumerian, Egyptian, and even Malayo-Polynesian "decipherments"\[1\]for the Indus seals. Every decipherment claims their system is entirely consistent, of course, with their own set of interpretations!  

  

In fact, it should be a homework exercise for the students of Computational linguistics to pick any random language and assign symbols from that language to the Indus symbols such that they come up with meaningful expressions in that language. We already know Indus script can support multiple solutions, and there appears no easy way to reduce it to a single solution!

  

We need innovative solution to crack the problem of Indus "script", and perhaps the statistical approach of Rajesh Rao et al.\[2\] at the University of Washington might lead us to developing some possible approaches toward a solution to this intractable problem.

  

Regards,

Suresh.
