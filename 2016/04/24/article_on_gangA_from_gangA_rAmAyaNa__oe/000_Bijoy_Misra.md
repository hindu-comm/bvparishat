Dear scholars,

Here is an article on GangA i wrote in my series.

<https://www.dwarkamai.com/vidyapeeth/articles/127-reflections-on-valmiki-ramayana-xiii-the-holy-ganga>  

I learn that there have been research studies on the vegetation

described by Valmiki. I would love to receive links if possible.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
