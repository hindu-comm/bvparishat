Prof Nagarajji,

  

Is there way to get hold of the book referred in the article?

It is not whether the plants existed, it is whether the characteristics can be traced.

Valmiki makes it vivid. The question is if it is through travel or through literature (books).

The latter is like Kalidasa describing the Himalayas.

  

I was particularly drawn to the water to the "underworld". Deep water circulation is

a new feature in oceanography. Denser cold water sinks near Greenland and makes the deep water current.

Deep water study of Bay of Bengal has not been undertaken (you need submarines!)

So the whole Sagara story as an imagination to create a process to channel sweet water deeper

through volume discharge should be examined.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
