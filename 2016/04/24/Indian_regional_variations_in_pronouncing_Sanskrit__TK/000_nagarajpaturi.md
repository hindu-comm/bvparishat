In the thread on पद्यरचने यतिनियमेषु प्रश्नः, a side-topic emerged and got discussed:

  

RSM mail, line 3

Read *ar**t**ha* as *ar**d**ha* !

(Typical Andhra displacement?)

  

-KSKannan

  

Thanks to Prof. Kannan for the correction made.



**Prof. Rani Sadasiva Murty**

  

It's a typo and not Any Typical Andhra Displacement)



**Prof. Rani Sadasiva Murty**

  

In fact a typical Andhra mother tongue interference would be in the opposite direction.

  

artha of Sanskrit loan words in Teluguis pronounced in the coastal Andhra dialects as ardha.

  

katha---> kadha

  

ratham ------> radham

  

and so on.

  

Interstingly it happens to English loan words such as theatre too. It is pronounced as dhiyETar.

  

-Nagaraj Paturi

  

What is a typical Andhra displacement? Is it related to the[*#kogul*](https://tagdef.com/kogul)phenomenon (a propensity among Tamil speakers)?

-Nityanand Misra

  

I know the sense of humour of AadaraNIya Nityanandji here.

  

yes, you are right. Such mother tongue interferences are common among all Indian languages while pronouncing Sanskrit loan words.

  

But there is a method in the g/k/h, p/b pronunciation. It is not as simple as they are pronounced interchangeably.

  

  

  

g,k,h are allophones to each other and make phoneme in Tamil. Where the phoneme takes which of the forms g,k or h has rules of occurrence.

  

-Nagaraj Paturi

  

An Andhra man spoke of *vedAr**tha*** as *vedAr**dha*** !

Karnataka people read *parima**la*** as *parima**La***!

But the best perhaps was a Tamil Nadu man singing

*s'rI-**mahA**-gaNapatim bhaje*

as

*srI-**megA**-gaNapatim bhaje !*  

*

Laugh at ourselves!

ममाभिप्राय

 उपरि 

"***me***"

 इति य उल्लिखितः, स अकारस्योच्चारणे संवृते द्राविडानाम् साधुः प्रयत्नः। यथा वङ्गे "मॊ" इत्यश्रोष्यत्। विदर्भेऽपि तन्निकटे। वयं कर्णाटा एवाकारं ह्रस्वं विकृतरीत्या विवृतोच्चारणेन वदामः।  
  
अपि चान्ध्रेषु "अ"कारे यकारच्छाया कदाचिच् छ्रूयते।

-Vishvas Vasuki

  

In the British and American pronunciation of the English word **mega**, the pronunciation of **me** has theopen-mid front unrounded vowel (IPA /ɛ/). Is this the vowel you have in mind? Is there any evidence or source to back the claim that this is the correct (साधु) pronunciation/effort for the *saṃvṛta akāra*?
