The words 'yugaadi' and baishakhee are the answer to your question.

Both are different ways if Indian/ vedic system of Cyclic time reckoning.

Yugaadi refers to the time lapse from a reference point: using moons repetitive movement in relation to the beginning of creation and/ or 60 year cyclic time reckoning.

  

Baishakhee referes to the moon entering a stellar reference point in the lunar cyclic period.

  

Astronomically as a phenomenon of Nature, no more explanation is needed.

  

Beyond time- reckoning as a natural periodicity observed, the religious significance andcultural factors celebration: depends upon the communities perception of time and ground phenomenon of spring season ushering in. The communities which could ( see- vision- or believe?!) earth- satellite moon as a ' devataa'/ graha make specific actions and recommendations for observation. And this certainly would look 'primitive ridiculous tribal belief' to ' scientists' who assume all knowingness about Nature and its forces! It does not matter whether veda says or Brihaddevataa says!

  

In such a scenario; the best is to explore the prime and primary question; matter- Consciousness - energy- Time relation from the POV of ' consciousness' , shifting from 'instrument based observation- sensing and sensitivity'.

  

Whether moon transiting the asterism Ashvini in Aries or some other asterism in some other zodiac sign, as a phenomenon of nature , scientist astronomer does not attach significance for the transits. But there are other disciplines which look for the impact of shifting moon
across asterisms and zodiac signs on life- mind- feelings- nature and provide useful information. It does not mean that the disciplines are contradicting each other or complementing. It simply means first accept the discipline to understand the cultural religious values associated with it. Each discipline serves a different purpose- like a jeans-pant and shirt serving the wearer differently for conveniences. There is no point in exploring a question: why they should be the way they are and why not interchange them as wares!
