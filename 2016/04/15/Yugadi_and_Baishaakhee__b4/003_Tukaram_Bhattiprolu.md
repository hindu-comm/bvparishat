 The 60 years of cycle started from the time immemorial in our Indian calendar. Varahamihira, who belongs to 5th century, quoted the 60 Year Cycle beginning with the year 'Prabhava'. As per Surya Siddhanta, the srishti started in the year Vijaya. As per Barhaspatyamana, the 60 year cycle begins with 'Vijaya'.  
  
 For further information, please go through any of the commentaries of Surya Siddhanta for the 55th sloka of Madhyamadhikara- which is as follows.
