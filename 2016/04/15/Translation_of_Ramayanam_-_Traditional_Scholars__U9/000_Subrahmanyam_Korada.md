नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Of late , there has been a demand that the traditional scholars should come forward to save Ramayanam from being misinterpreted / mistranslated by some Western scholars .

  

The above demand from scholars is made keeping in mind the न्याय ( सुश्रुतः - उत्तरतन्त्रम्) - परमतम् अप्रतिषिद्धम् अनुमतं भवति and it cannot be taken lightly .

  

In 2008 , after spending a lot of time, I published a book - Theories of Language : Oriental & Occidental and the (D K ) Publisher sent it to US , Briton, Canada etc . I have refuted the so called 'Theories"( hypotheses) of Western Linguists , right from Carnap down to Chomsky , starting with Phoneme and ending in Discourse / Semantics.

  

Till date no scholar/student has commented .

  

The scholars from West (some) often bite more than they can chew in terms of Indian culture/philosophy .

  

There are apparently only two options - take on such scholars by challenging - put up or shut up , or to spend our valuable time , that is running away with age , in explaining / commenting / educating/ illuminating those who are interested .

The परमतम् should, at all costs and by all means , be refuted without the shadow of doubt .

  

Therefore , I rather think it is better to support wholeheartedly those scholars / people , who have already engaged the propagators of
अपसिद्धान्त with regard to सनातनधर्म of आर्यावर्त / पुण्यभूमि ।

  

यो यथा वर्तते यस्मिन् तस्मिन्नेवं प्रवर्तयन् ।

नाधर्मं समवाप्नोति नचाश्रेय़श्च विन्दति ॥ -- भारतम्
