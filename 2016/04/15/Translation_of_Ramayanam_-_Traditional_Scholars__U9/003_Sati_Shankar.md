@Dear Prof. Korada,

  

mAnyavar

  

"The परमतम् should, at all costs and by all means , be refuted without the shadow of doubt .

Therefore , I rather think it is better to support wholeheartedly those scholars / people , who have already engaged the propagators of
अपसिद्धान्त with regard to सनातनधर्म of आर्यावर्त / पुण्यभूमि ।    
                      यो यथा वर्तते यस्मिन् तस्मिन्नेवं प्रवर्तयन् ।

                                
नाधर्मं समवाप्नोति नचाश्रेय़श्च विन्दति ॥ -- भारतम्

It can be Battle for Sanskrit or any other - we will be there to assist - no questions asked - no adverse comments made ..."

  

Your view, intention and the Will, all highly appreciated and endorsed.It is need of the hour to unite and work hard to RESTORE self respect. pride and the Truth of our Scriptures.

Unfortunately,what we intend to denote byपरमतम्  includes a few of our own also.

Best Wishes

Regards

Sati Shankar
