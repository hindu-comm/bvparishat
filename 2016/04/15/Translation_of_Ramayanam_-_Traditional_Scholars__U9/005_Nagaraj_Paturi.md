Pujya Prof. Karadaji's post is theannouncement of a mahaarathiof Battle for Sanskrit that he has been, currently is and will continue to bein the battle.

  

He is one of the savyasaachi ('bilingual' in Prof. Bijoy Misra's words and also a deeply traditionalscholar with the awareness of the modern) mahaarathis the battle has.

  

His announcement of his presence boosts the confidence of those on the side of the battle.
