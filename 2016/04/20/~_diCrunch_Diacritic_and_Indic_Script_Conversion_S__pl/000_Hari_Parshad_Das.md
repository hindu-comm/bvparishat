dear vidvaj-janas,  
  
my praṇāmas.  
  
A handy utility named diCrunch was available till now at: <http://www.ingmardeboer.nl/php/diCrunch.php>  
  
However, this link has now gone down. I am not sure how many web editions of diCrunch exist today. I've been using this utility for many years now.  
  
Therefore, I am attaching the PHP source code of diCrunch to this message so that if any vidvān wants to use it on their personal site, they can do so.
