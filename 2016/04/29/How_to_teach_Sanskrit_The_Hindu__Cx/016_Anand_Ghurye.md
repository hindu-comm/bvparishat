Dear Friends ,

  

A friend of mine sent me these objections to Sanskrit . I have already refuted his claims on my facebook page . I am giving below his write up for your referral .

  

Quote

Great scholars of Indology, linguistic and history have written their bold opinions about Sanskritlanguagein their scholarly works. Here are some of the quotes by by them regarding SanskritLanguage.  
  
Raja Ram Mohan Roy was a great social reformer of18th century. He was a scholar of linguistics and religions. He had translated Upanishids in Bengalilanguage. He says: Sanskritlanguageis so difficult to learn that you will have to give your whole life for it, and even then you would not get much knowledge from it.  
  
Saint Tulasidas was a scholar of Sanskirt, but he always wrote in Hindi. It is interesting to know what he says about Sanskrit: Mylanguage(Hindi) is an earthen pot filled with ambrosia, while Sanskirt is a pot of gold filles with poison.  
  
Kabir, the great saint of medieval India says that thelanguagesof masses are flowing water, while Sanskrit is a puddle of stagnant water  
  
Osho, the great philosopher says: Sanskrit was never a spokenlanguage. It was artificial codelanguagecreated by Brahmins who needed alanguageunknown to the masses.  
  
Famous historian Bhaskar Rao Jadhav writes in his Marathi book 'Marathe Aani Tyanchi Bhasha' (Marathas and TheirLanguage): The name of anylanguageis kept on the people who speak thatlanguage. There were no people named Sanskrit, and their was not a region or country that was known as Sanskrit.  
  
Another historian and authority on Indus valley civilization Advocate P R Deshmukh says, To highlight the difference between thelanguageof masses and Sanskrit, Vedics created grammar and rules.  
  
Renowned historian and the author of 'Buddhist India' Rhys Davids says about ancient India: Nobody from Taxila to Champa was speaking in Sanskrit, but a type of Palilanguagewas speken everywhere'  
  
Professor Sham Sundar Das says in his book 'Hindi Bhasha Ka Vikas', 'Realizing that thelanguageof the indigenous people is affecting theirlanguage, Aryans cultured and separated theirlanguage, but many words which were adopted from nativelanguagesremained in Sanskirt as they were.'  
  
Abe Carrey, a Christian missionarry in India learned Sanskrit as he was informed that there was a lot of knowledge in thatlanguage. But he found that it was unreal, so he said: There is nothing but pebbles and stones in Sanskritlanguage.  
  
B. N. Nayar, author of Dynamic Brahmins says: Sanskrit was never a spokenlanguage, it was just a cultured form of Prakritlanguage.  
  
There are many other quotes by other great scholars, but I think it is enough to give the idea about the reality of Sanskrit langauge  
  

SANSKRIT IS ALANGUAGEOF LOOTING DECEITS IN THE NAME OF GOD Blah Blah to protect the interests of Non Working class and keep the hold on poor masses. They have been fooling since thousands of year to live a creamy life....

  

Unquote .

  

I believe all quotes are just a bit twisted to suit the purpose of the writer . For example

what Kabir says is " “Sanskrit is the stagnant water of the Lord's private well," Kabir said, whereas "the spokenlanguageis the rippling water of the running stream."

 

Which is not exactly same as what you quote - quote "languagesof masses are flowing water, while Sanskrit is a puddle of stagnant water "

  

Do let me know your comments . I am searching for proper references to these quotes about Sanskrit .

  

Regards ,
