Excerpt from the review on the same page:

  

"The next four chapters successfully evolve a novel method to eliminate, as far as possible, the difficulties generally associated with learning Sanskrit – the rules of gender and*sandhi*and the need to memorise numerous conjugations and declensions. This is a major achievement of the author."
