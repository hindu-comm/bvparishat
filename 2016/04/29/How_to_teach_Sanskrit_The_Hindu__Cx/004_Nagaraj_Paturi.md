The author says, "This is another case where the kernel of good intention (supporting serious scholarship on Sanskrit) has been lost in an ill-designed formulation."

  

In fact, after reading the essay, one can't help feeling "This essayis another case where the kernel of good intention (supporting serious scholarship on Sanskrit) has been lost in an ill-designed writing."

  

The essay begins with citing the criticism bythe Aam Aadmi Party which asked her to choose between Java and Sanskrit, and so on, which is said to be in response to "Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani’s written reply in the Lok Sabha recently on teaching Sanskrit in the Indian Institutes of Technology has come in for criticism" The report of Smt Irani's reply is here: <http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/iranis-sanskrit-request-draws-ire/article8525442.ece>

  

In this she is mentioned to have clearly said, 'that IITs have been asked to teach Sanskrit to facilitate the study of science and technology as reflected in its literature'. The report further says, "She cited the report of a panel that had suggested that IITs may facilitate study of science and technology as reflected in Sanskrit literature along with inter-disciplinary study of Sanskrit and modern subjects."

  

AAP leaders' tweets and retweets are also mentioned in this report.

  

Such tweets were recently brought for discussion on the 'Sanskrita' list by Mr Ken P by pasting the link

I responded there by saying, "Do we need to discuss such news where there is complete disconnect between the news of a suggestion forenabling students to consult S & T Sanskrit texts and the comments that talk as though students are being asked to learn contemporary science through Sanskrit?![](https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/x7Az90uC0FlqG1NQNJvbQl7YtYRlnWzoqu2O_ZLb9xIKhYpJarh3aZrZ_qlU6_VKMQpRwI5_nDi9FsJOqf0XSQHw_6yv1VK7rhIBScGS2g=s0-d-e1-ft#https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif)"

  

All the fun comments unscientifically and illogically comparing the natural language Sanskrit with programming languages such as Java are theresponses topopular street-level praising rumours about Sanskrit that "it has been found to be the most suited language for computers" The responses are as uneducated and uninformed as the naïve rumours of lay Sanskrit-lovers.

  

No professional researcher working in the area of Sanskrit related computer science has ever said anything like "it has been found to be the most suited language for computers". No such professional has ever compared Sanskrit to languages such as Java and said that Sanskrit is superior to them in the functions for which they are meant.

  

But to expect political leaders such as the tweeting AAP leadersto know anything more than the naïve street talks mentioned above is unrealistic.

  

Earlier, the allegations were that Sanskrit scholars devoid of modern S&T knowledge were making claims of S&T useful content in ancient Sanskrit texts. Their claims need to be ratified by modern S&T experts. Only modern S&T experts are qualified to make such claims. Now when that link which was found to be missing between modern S&T expertsand Sanskrit language knowledge is sought to be provided, the same people cry fowl and say this is Hindutva agenda.

  

Earlier, the allegations were that Sanskrit was not being taught, Sanskrit language learning was denied to people. Now when Sanskrit language knowledge is provided on platter, people arestimulated and persuadedto learn Sanskrit, the same people cry fowl and say, you are forcing Sanskrit down the throats of people.

  

Regarding the difficulty of learning Sanskrit ('so many tables' and so on), parama pujya Sri Bharathi tirtha Swamiji, in thevideo recently posted on this list by Sri KN Rameshji said, " another allegation is that Sanskrit is difficult to learn. So many grammar rules. Which language doesn't have grammar rules. Doesn't English have grammar ?Any language operates only through certain grammar rules. Can that be argued as a hindrance to learn a language? " 

  

Vidwan Srivatsaji rightly said,"The statement "The aesthetics are difficult to appreciate — how many things can be endlessly and tediously compared to the lotus or the moon?" betrays a total lack of width and depth of exposure to Sanskrit literature. For such a person to be pontificating about Sanskrit pedagogy is quite rich!"
