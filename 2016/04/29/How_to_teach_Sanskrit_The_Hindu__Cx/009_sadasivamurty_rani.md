Yesterday morning sent a letter to The Hindu for publishing in LETTERS TO THE EDITOR in response to the Article in Discussion : HOW TO TEACH SANSKRIT.

I don't know whether they will publish it or not.

Please find it in the attachment of this mail.

Warm Regards,

**Prof. Rani Sadasiva Murty**

I have never heard any one say a language is learnt or exists without grammar. If there is no grammar there is no language.
