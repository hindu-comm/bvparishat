hariH OM,

One smells Pollock in the following:

  
"Perhaps the concentration on Sanskrit science is to move away from the more controversial social aspects of the Sanskrit world (questions of gender, caste, etc)."

1\. It is nobody's case that we have to launch a hunt for quantum mechanics in Sanskrit texts. But the problem with the above statement of the author is its false dichotomy. Science on one hand Vs. gender, caste etc. on the other. With an insinuation that the former is sought to be explored in Sanskrit because the latter is inconvenient.  
2. What has a language got to do with politics? Do the western Anthropologists explore the relationship between slave trade and Aramaic / Greek / English?  
3. The "difficulty" of Sanskrit is tom tommed without regard to the fact that one can read as much Sanskrit as one wants or needs as per his interest.  
4. The statement "The aesthetics are difficult to appreciate — how many things can be endlessly and tediously compared to the lotus or the moon?" betrays a total lack of width and depth of exposure to Sanskrit literature. For such a person to be pontificating about Sanskrit pedagogy is quite rich!

svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  
 shrivathsa.
