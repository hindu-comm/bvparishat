Dear Shrivathsa,

Your analysis of this writing is very apt. While speaking about the objectivity that science (shaastra) expects, here's the article is moving on a flimsy ground of subjectivity and above all, such a subjectivity is not rooted in the aspect of aahaaryasattaa ( vaguely related to the concept of willing suspension of disbelief), the basis of all arts and instead is a baffling bias in reality!
