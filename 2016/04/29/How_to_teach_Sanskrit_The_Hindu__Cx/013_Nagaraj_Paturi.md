1\. Those contexts are built and courses are already designed. The design of the course depends on the target course-seekers. Please have a look at the series of course-books used by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. Or, please have a look at the lessons from the IIT Madras website, that I am sharing here.

  

2\. Those who study a few sargas of a few Kavyas as a beginning are already oriented or motivated towards such a learning. They come with a motivation to study all the remaining sargas of that Kavya and all other Kavyas. There is no need of separate lollipops to them as rewards to doing the favour of learning Sanskrit. They consider the teacher to be doing a favour to them by providing a gateway to the world of Sanskrit Kavyas which they already love.

  

3\. Those who attend the Ashtadhyayi based Sanskrit learning classes choose those classes after knowing that there are other methods available.

  

4\. You mentioned philosophy. For example, if someone wants to study Nyaya, he is already motivated to study Nyaya. He attends the Sanskrit classes with that motivation. It is very hard to persuade people to study things such as Nyaya, Mimamsa or Vedanta by providing lollipops. A prior strong motivation is required. To introduce them to these areas through English, already huge number of resources are available.

  

5\. A student who wants to study S&T books in Sanskrit should also be motivated towards the project. Resources in English are available to enthuse them towards the project. Once motivated, they would not wait for fun learning methods to learn Sanskrit.
