Dear Vidwan Vishal Jaiswal,

  

Sanskrit is traditionally taught directly through the study of Kavyas. Grammar rules are not taught in this method.

  

Many modern Sanskrit courses are taughtin the sameway as English, you say is, taught to you. 

  

You are not compelled to become a vyaakaraNa expert. No one is, for that matter.

  

Among traditional Sanskrit scholars too very few specialize in vyaakaraNa.

  

Though you did not study Wren and Martin, you had grammar notes at the end of each of your English lessons, hadn't you?

  

Similarly basic level of grammar is provided to those students of Sanskrit who do not want to specialize in vyaakaraNa.

  

So you need not newly wish for that kind of a Sanskrit course, it is already there, in fact, there are many such.

  

Best,

  

Nagaraj
