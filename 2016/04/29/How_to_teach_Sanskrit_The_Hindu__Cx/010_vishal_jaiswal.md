Grammatical rules are built observing a living language - not the  
other way around. What was implicit in my sentences was that  
sufficient context simply does not exist in Sanskrit so far ---- such  
context that a beginner can become immersed in, and progress further  
-- whatever that context be - either written or spoken or etc.  
One cannot expect to jump straight to philosophy or poetry ?  
Now, the way Sanskrit must have been taught and learned long back was  
different, because it had a living ambience then. But that has also  
ceased to exist now.
