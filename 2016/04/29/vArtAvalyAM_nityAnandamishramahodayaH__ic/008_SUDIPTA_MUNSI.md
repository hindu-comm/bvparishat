Mr. Nityananda Mishra's interview, if seen, will certainly generate a positive attitude towards Sanskrit and its promotion in the modern world, in the minds of high-nose frowning English-educated dilettantes. My heartiest congratulations to Mr. Mishra for accomplishing the task of editing Swami Ramabhadracarya's book on Paninian usages in Adhyatma Ramayana.
