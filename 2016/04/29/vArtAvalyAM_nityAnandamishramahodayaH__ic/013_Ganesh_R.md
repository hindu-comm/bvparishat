Dear Sri Nityananda Mishra ji,

Thanks a lot for this post. Your novel views are very neatly presented and thy have lot to do with the promotion Sanskrit. I am particularly pleased by the language used here as it is lucid, simple, natural and nice.

May your hard work yield more and more precious things.

Regards

Ganesh
