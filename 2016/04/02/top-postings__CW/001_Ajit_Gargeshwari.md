For those members who still may not have understood. Please read this wiki link. Itâ€™s important to read it

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_style#Top-posting>

Top-posting is a natural consequence of the behavior of the "reply" function in many current e-mail readers, such as [Microsoft Outlook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Outlook "Microsoft Outlook"), [Gmail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail "Gmail"), and others. By default, these programs insert into the reply message a copy of the original message (without headers and often without any extra indentation or quotation markers), and position the editing [cursor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursor_%28computers%29 "Cursor (computers)") above it. Moreover, a bug present on most flavours of Microsoft Outlook caused the quotation markers to be lost when replying in plain text to a message that was originally sent in HTML/RTF^(**) For these and possibly other reasons, many users seem to accept top-posting as the "standard" reply style.

Partially because of Microsoft's influence, top-posting is very common on [mailing lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_mailing_list "Electronic mailing list") and in personal e-mail.

Top-posting has always been the standard format for forwarding a message to a third party, in which case the comments at the top (if any) are a "cover note" for the recipient.
