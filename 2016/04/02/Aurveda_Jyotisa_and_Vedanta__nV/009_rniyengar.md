Namaste.

Excellent discussion by Dr.Paturi. Actual present day practices, beliefs can be vastly different from what is said or argued in the ancient texts. I have seen very often in the BVP discussions the two are mixed up. Textual analysis is essential part of academic work, this should not be mixed up with later tradition clubbed under "Smrti" however strong it might have been emotionally. Keeping Ayurvedic texts of Charaka and Sushruta as focus, for my own education, I like to ask the following questions;

1\. Are there are references to Seasons, Nakshatras and Efficacy of time? If yes, can this be considered Jyotisha? Of course this is not of the Horoscopic kind, and AFAIK the above ancient stalwarts have not mentioned Horoscopes.

2\. Did the ancient authors of Ayurveda, consider only the Annamaya-kosha or did they deal in their logic, analysis and etiology with PraaNamaya and Manomaya koshas too. Even if they did not use such specific terminology, could there have been a theoretical link to the Upanishads such as the MahaanaaraayaNa which originated such terminology?

  

Thanks

RN Iyengar
