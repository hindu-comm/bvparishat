This reminds me a story that I read in a preface (in Hindi) of an Ayurvedic book. The story goes thus:  
  

Once a sishya asked his Guru, all the time we speak of Atma which is eternal, all pervading, beginning and endless by inherent nature. Then what is the purpose of this body. In philosophical discussions, body does not get any significance. So, this perishable body do not have any purpose in loka.  
  

Guru do not say anything. As part of the service to the Gurukulam, the sishya goes to forest to acquire *samidh* etc. in evening. Then, he enters a mango groove. He becomes a goat, as soon as he enters the groove due to '*daivam*.' Suddenly, there appears a tiger looking ferociously into the eyes of the goat, as if, it can plunder over and eat away the goat at any time. Poor goat is trembling in great fear. Tiger is frightening and goat is quivering. Till next morning this episode continued. Meanwhile, Guru went in search of his beloved sishya.  
  
No later the sun raised in the east, the tiger disappeared and the sishya got back to his normal form. When Guru approached his disciple, the sishya narrates the nightmare that he has encountered and tells that with god's grace only he could survive from the ferocious wild animal. Guru asks - why were you afraid, you are not your body, right? Upon Guru's questioning so, sishya realizes the importance of body alongside Atma, and begs his pardon.  
  
So, keeping oneself fit and conscious of one's own bodily health, is the prerequisite of any 'AdhyAtmkia-sAdhanA.'

Kautilya in Arthashastra refers to his pUrvAcAryas in context of 'indriyajaya.' He says - *धर्मार्थाविरोधेन कामं सेवेत* । न निस्सुखः स्यात् । समं वा त्रिवर्गमन्योन्यानुबन्धम् । एकोह्यत्यासेवितो धर्मार्थकामानामात्मानमितरौ च पीडयति । (1.7)  
  

But he slightly differs with his predecessors and declares - *अर्थ एव प्रधान* इति कौटल्यः, अर्थमूलौ हि धर्मकामौ ।  
  

However, when we look at his over all statement about his work, his difference of opinion could not withstand (in light of this statement) - विद्याविनयहेतुः इन्द्रियजयः ....... कृत्स्नं हि शास्त्रमिदम् इन्द्रियजयः । (1.6). When indriyajaya is connected with Ayurveda, it is nothing but the 'sadvrtta, AcArarasyAya and sattvAvajaya' the Ayurvedic scholars refer to.
