Thanks Prof. Iyengar, for finding the observations useful.

  

\> Are there are references to Seasons, Nakshatras and Efficacy of time?

  

------ One of the superior features of Ayurveda over modern medicine is to incorporate the effect of seasons on the tridhatu balance of the body. This helped Ayurveda to provide a season-wise pathya for healthy living. Effects of the time of the day, moon phases etc. on body also are meticulously observed and formulated. Nakshatra-wise seasonal (karate)features are included some books.

  

\>If yes, can this be considered Jyotisha?

  

------ This is a study of the effects of conditions on the Earth and not a study of planets or stars on the body conditions.

  

\> Did the ancient authors of Ayurveda, consider only the Annamaya-kosha or did they deal in their logic, analysis and etiology with PraaNamaya and Manomaya koshas too.

  

------- They did of course deal with praaNamaya and manOmaya kOs'as. It is a well known fact that it is in Ayurveda that we have such a meticulous analysis of praaNas as pancha praaNasatone level and their more micro levels at a deeper level. All the srotases / naaDis through which these praaNa 'vibrations' pass, their interconnecrions, their effects on different dhatus etc. are all meticulously analysed only in Ayurveda. Some of these correspond with neurological aspects, some not.

  

It is the holistic aspect of Ayurveda that makes it include themutual effects of body and mind. Certain mental orientations are prescribed alongside food and medicines for different diseases. Psychological conditions including the psychiatric ones are treated through medicines in this system.

  

> Even if they did not use such specific terminology, could there have been a theoretical link to the Upanishads such as the MahaanaaraayaNa which originated such terminology?

  

--------- Upanishads and Ayurvedic texts have mutual borrowings of terms and concepts is well known. But sometimes the terms seem to have different meanings in these two systems. For example, praaNas may be common, some naaDis may be common. But some naaDis of, say, kaThopanishad may be different than the ones discussed in Ayurveda.

  

My knowledge of these issues is limited to that of a student of culture.

  

There could be more than what I could observe in this regard.

  

Humbly,

  

Nagaraj
