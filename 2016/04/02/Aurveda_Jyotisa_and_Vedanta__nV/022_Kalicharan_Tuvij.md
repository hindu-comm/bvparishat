This is just to add some references to my earlier post in the thread:  
  
On the canonical position of Atharva:  
  
कौटिलीय अर्थशास्त्रं  
१.३.१  
साम । ऋग्यजुर्वदा: त्रय: त्रयी  
१.३.२  
अथर्ववेद इतिहासवेदौ च वेदा:  
१.३.३  
शिक्षा कल्पो व्याकरणं निरुक्तं छन्दोविचितिर्ज्योतिषं इति चाङ्गानि  
  
That is, त्रय: वेदा: is what we essentially understand as "वेद", and when अथर्ववेद and इतिहासवेद are added to the list, the list becomes, "वेदा:". So a distinction is kept between what is वेद and what is वेदा:, furthermore, इतिहास is considered a part of वेदा: much in the same way अथर्व is.  
  
For detailed introduction to trayovedAH and Atharva:  
See the introduction chapter (page xxviii onwards) of The Hymns Of The Atharva-veda (M. Müller):

Re Vedanta:  
महावाक्यम् (e.g. सर्वम् खलु .. etc) are to Upanishads what शब्द is to वेद — the minimum unit of understanding. Just as शब्द needs the full context of the Line (called मंत्र), a vAkya needs the full context of the paragraph to make correct sense. The only problem is: महावाक्यानि have been quoted out of context for quite some time.
