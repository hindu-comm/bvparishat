\>I guess the reason, for our hesitation to offer our knowledge as a whole or to assume or accept the role of becoming the editors of ancient Texts of Charaka and Susruta partly, may be that our Minds are still in western robes.

  

------Whether I am in western robes are not the list members reading my posts know very well.

List members who have been around here might remember my aggressive stand during the debates on yogi pratyaksha or any such issue.

When somebodychallenges us to showdaivavyapaas'raya in Ayurveda, , it is justified to search for those portions and present them to the challenger.When somebody agrees that there is such a thing in Ayurveda and justifies that showing examples in other traditions, there is no point inshowing those portions to that person only.

  

I did not ask not to offer our knowledge as a whole. What I asked is not to *overemphasize* the daivavyapaas'raya. I did not recommend editing the books. Since I know that S'us'ruta and Charaka did not overemphasize daivavyapaas'raya and larger portions of their texts are devoted to yuktivyapaas'raya only, I was asking to present that fact of actual greater significance to yuktivyapaas'raya to the present day readers.

  

\> When they never hesitated why should we hesitate to offer as a whole to our next generations?

  

------ Ican only say that they were never in theenvironment in which we are. I think it goes without saying that communication, not to fail, needs to be carried out, keeping the receiving audience in mind. 

  

\> Other wise is it merely a JADU TONA to speak about our ancient Indian systems of philosophy that speak the Moksha? If others only call it JADU TONA aren't we able retort them with our strength of knowledge?

  

---- My post does not have a statement or any indication thatit is JADU TONA to speak about our ancient Indian systems of philosophy that speak the Moksha.

  

When we present our systems which are as clinically verifiablyscientific as the modern systems, in a form that looks like JADU TONA, there is a danger of the clinically verifiable aspects getting overshadowed bythe form of our presentation.

  

\> Should a person who seeks Moksha always be weak or shouldn't he be healthy?

  

------- My sentence: 'Or, is it shown that for a person who is already a moksha-seeker, health is helpful in his pursuit, Ayurveda helps him for that purpose?' meaning :'For a person who is already a moksha-seeker, health is helpful in his pursuit, Ayurveda helps him for that purpose'

  

\> Can we appreciate if a person attains Artha and Kama going out of the path of Dharma?

  

------ My sentence : 'Does 'Hindu' tradition look down upon the seekers of artha and kaama within the bounds of dharma and force all to seek only moksha? ' Meaning: 'Hindu' tradition doesnot look down upon those whopursue artha and kaama within the bounds of dharma and does not force all to seek only moksha'. 

  

\> The essence of all disciplines of Ancient Indian Knowledge systems is MOKSHA though Dharma, Artha and Kama are incidental gains.

  

------- My understanding of, say,pUrvamImAmsA is that its essence is not moksha and dharma is not incidental to it but central and ultimate to it. The stand 'The essence of all disciplines of Ancient Indian Knowledge systems is MOKSHA though Dharma, Artha and Kama are incidental gains.'is perfect for a moksha-seeker, say a Vedantin.

  

Trivarga saadhana can be a pursuit in itself not necessarily ending in moksha,from the point of view of Indian tradition which is
diversity-centric-- is my understanding. 

  

\> Is Daiva vyapasraya discouraged or dismissed or discarded by Charaka or Susruta or Vagbhata as an alternative or substitute of Yukti Vyapasraya? Can we find any citations any where in these texts?

  

------ Can we find any citation from my posts for 'Daiva vyapasraya is discouraged or dismissed or discarded by Charaka or Susruta or Vagbhata as an alternative or substitute of Yukti Vyapasraya'or at least for ''Daiva vyapasraya is discouraged or dismissed or discarded byus as an alternative or substitute of Yukti Vyapasraya'' ?

  

I am confident that I can continue to hold Prof. Rani in high esteem, in spite of this intriguingly strange misunderstanding of my posts on his part.

  

Humbly,

  

Nagaraj
