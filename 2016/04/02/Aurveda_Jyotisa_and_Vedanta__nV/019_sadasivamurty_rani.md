I have been watching all posts on this topic in this thread and I have been waiting for a post like this by Shri Giridhar Vedantam. I sincerely appreciate the efforts of Shri Giridhar ji.

  

1\. If any body asks whether there is relation between Astrology and Ayurveda with their roots in the earliest Ayurvedic texts we can affirmatively say a BIG "YES". Similarly there is striking relation between Vedanta and Ayurveda too. The major texts on Ayurveda are: Brhat Trayi. : Charaka, Sushruta and Vabhata. In all these three TEXTS with out any necessity of even depending on the commentaries we can show authentic citations to show the relation between Ayurveda and Astrology and Ayurveda and Vedanta.

Soon I shall come out with some Textual Quotes from these texts.

  

2\. Though not directly stated most of the writers on our ancient Indian knowledge systems refuse to talk positively on Predictive Astrology. It is very much unfortunate.

Usually the prominent argument from these authors is:

As there are references to Astronomical matters in the Vedas there are no references to Astrological matters. So Astrology, particularly Predictive part of it is for Bhukti or Bread.

Here I have some questions:

1\. Is Vedic Tradition confined to Veda Samhitas, Brahmanas, Aranyakas, Upanishads and Sutra literature?

2\. What is the practical experience of these writers with Phalita Jyotisha? How deeply have they studied these texts?

3\. Why cannot those who consider Varahamihira's Brhatsamhita as an authentic text, cannot consider his Brhajjataka with the same intensity?

I suggest certain things to those who deny the validity of Predictive Astrology:

Though they deny the validity of this branch of knowledge I am sure most of them do perform all the 15 Samskaras beginning with Garbhadhana in their families usually. .

1\. My suggestion is let those people approach good Astrological Practitioners and request them to fix the following Muhurtams:

1\. Gruha Nirmana (Construction of a house) in Agni Panchaka Muhurta.

2\. Gruha Pravesha (Occupying a new house) and Yatra Arambha (Going for a tour) in a Chora Panchaka Muhurta.

3\. Yatra (Travel) in a Mrtyu Panchaka Muhurta or in a Roga Panchaka Muhurta.

4\. Start a Good Project of Crores of Rupees in Raja Panchaka Muhurta.

5\. Admit a chronic patient in a very good Hospital under the care of excellent team of Doctors in Mrtyu Panchaka Muhurta.

Then let us see the results of such case studies.

Next I request all those who deny the validity of Predictive Astrology and those who blame those who earn their bread from this discipline to carefully, sincerely, completely and thoroughly study Brhajjatakam of Varahamihira, Vasishta Samhita and Satyacharya's text and then analyse certain Kundalis and then say whether it is accurate or not. (Careful, Sincere, Complete and Thorough Study and not mere reading is necessary to pass any further comment.).

With warmest regards to all,

**Prof. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
