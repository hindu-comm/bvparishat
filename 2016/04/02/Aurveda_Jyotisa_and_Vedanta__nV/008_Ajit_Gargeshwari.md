The reason the thread is going haywire is the subject line of the thread itself is difficult to understand. There is philosophy of Aurveda, elements or some generic principles Jyotisa are used in Aurveda but itâ€™s difficult to find any advaita vedanta in aurveda. One can find Mantra Shastra in Aurveda but Mantra Shastra by itself is a different subject. Parading a long lengthy confusing email by a member without any quotes from the original texts or published secondary literature has also diverted the intent of this thread. The concepts and issues involved in this thread has been rightly summarised by Prof. Paturi
