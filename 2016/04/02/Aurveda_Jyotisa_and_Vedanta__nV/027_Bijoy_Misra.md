This sounds just right (from a novice perspective of mine!)

  

Is there any tracking of the wordयुक्ति meaning "considered opinion" in literature?

  

Gita talks about युक्ततम मतः, which possibly has the similar connotation.

  

There's a little book I did with a Swami here in MIT called SriKrishna Yoga

(published by Advaita Press, RKM, 2005 ) and I tried to analyze the technicality of the phrase.

As I see now, it has more पुरुषकार in it thanदैव
