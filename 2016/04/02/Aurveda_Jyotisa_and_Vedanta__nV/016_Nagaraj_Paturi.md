Or, if, by 'the specific concepts of Vedic Astrology that are currently being used', you meant 'the specific concepts of Vedanga Jyotisha or Siddhanta bhaaga of ancient Indian Jyotisha that are currently being used in the current practice of phalajyotisha',may I request you to note, though not directly relevant to the thread,that theword 'Vedic Astrology' is connotatively being used all over, currently, in the sense of phalajyotisha only. For example, if you download a softwarewith the name 'Vedic Astrology software' or if you see a book with the title 'Introduction to Vedic Astrology' , it is always related phalajyotisha only in the current parlance.
