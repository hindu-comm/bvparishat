\> May be if David Frawley (Pandit vamadeva Shastri a recepient of Padma Bhushan) (*I am not sure whether he is on this List* or not) could possibly elaborate on the specific concepts of Vedic Astrology that are currently being used ?

------ Do you mean' the specific concepts of Vedic Astrology that are *currently* being used' or *'the specific concepts* of Vedic Astrology that are currently being used'in the practice of Ayurveda?

  

Either way, we need not all the way trouble David Frawley (Pandit vamadeva Shastri a recepient of Padma Bhushan). I saw posts from highly knowledgeable scholars of Vedic Astrology, Ayurveda both. Some could be on the list silently observing. They can be requested to help us if there is a pointed question. 

  

Siince 'the specific concepts of Vedic Astrology that are *currently* being used' is too general andtoo vast a topic without a pointed objective, not relevant to the current thread, *'the specific concepts* of Vedic Astrology that are currently being used*in the practice of Ayurveda'* which is relevant to the current thread can be addressed to those members of the list who are experts in Vedic Astrology and Ayurveda.
