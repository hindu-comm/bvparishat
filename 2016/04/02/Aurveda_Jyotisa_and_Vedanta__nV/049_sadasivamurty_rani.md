Respected Nagaraj Paturi Ji,

My sincere Namaskarams to you. I always respect your postings and thoughts. Yourself, Prof. Sunil Bhattachar ji, Prof. RN Iyengar Ji, Prof. Korada Subrahmanyam Ji, Prof. Bijoy Misra Ji, Prof. Joshi ji, HNBhatt Ji, Prof. BVK Sastry ji and others (I may be missing some other names) .... are all like Dikpalakas (Quarterly Rulers) to Bharatiya Vidvat Parishat. All of you are regular contributors to every progressive discussion in this Group. All your contributions are both qualitatively and quantitatively rich. So usually when all of you participate I mostly observe silence for the reason that not much would be left for me to say when you all speak. I learn from all of your postings, I feel happy and I enjoy too.

I have always high regard for you.

  

My reasons for participating in this thread:

1st Reason:

There is fundamentally a question in this thread about the elements of Vedanta or any other philosophic system in the realm of Ayurveda. Discussions are in swing. So I thought I too could contribute in this direction. Hence having gone through the Texts of Charaka, Susruta and Vagbhata I have presented certain citations from the first two texts. I reserved the third Text for my future postings.

In the mean while, I should thank Prof. Prasad ji for lessening my efforts by posting from Vagbhata also. 

In consequence to these two postings your posting was seen where there is an expectation not to give over emphasis to Daivavyapasraya.

Here I would like to say something:

a) When the thread is to search about the elements of Philosophy in Ayurveda

b) When the **DIRECT STATEMENTS**related to the philosophic systems cited from SUSRUTA and CHARAKA (**NOT TAKEN FROM ANY SECONDARY OR TERTIARY SOURCES**) are presented -

i\) Is it any kind of OVER EMPHASIZING? 

ii\) Is it wrong to speak of such things?

iii\) Is it wrong if such direct quotes are presented in our postings after scholars like you have already said something in this regard?

  

Reason 2

*Let us all remember that we are in times when all the ancient Indian S&T is attempted to be presented to the younger generation as mere जादू टोना. To overemphasize the daivavyapaas'raya aspects of Ayurveda may add up to this image attempted to be created by the detractors ofthe ancient Indian S&T.Picking out the great achievements of yuktivyapaas'raya of Ayurveda and to present the fact that daivavyapaas'raya is resorted to only as an alternative to and not as a substitute to yuktivyapaas'raya is the need of the hour. (From April 6 posting of your posting)*  

  

This is the second reason to write my yesterday's posting. Here my statement :

I guess the reason, for our hesitation to offer our knowledge as a whole or to assume or accept the role of becoming the editors of ancient Texts of Charaka and Susruta partly, may be that our Minds are still in western robes.

Is made not merely keeping your statements in view. It is the generally prevailing tendency every where.

  

As a Sanskritist I am associated and have been working with many scientists in many practical scientific pursuits at national level centres. Every where this has become a fundamental question to eliminate certain elements of divine interference from the texts and to accept the clinically provable elements only.

Here I could convince most of them to agree with me by dividing our approach in to the following ways:

i\. Let us separate the elements those are clinically provable or provable in physical laboratories for our practical purposes and start our pursuits over them.

  

ii\. Let us exclusively consider the Elements of Divine Interference and have our pursuits over them.

  

iii\. Let us take up special pursuits related to experiments which
require both Physical and Divine elements.

Let us not have a choice of this or that exclusively and let us consider their knowledge as a whole start three way pursuits.

  

in this context I often say them all to be Indian and think Indian and they too never denied me and our practical pursuits are in progress.

With the same spirit I made my above statement. It is not an exclusive statement made keeping your writings and contributions in view. This is keeping in view the generally prevalent tendency among the Indians.

  

In my view THIS IS NOT OVER EMPHASIZING THE DAIVA VYAPASRAYA BUT GIVING ITS DUE IMPORTANCE.



All my other supplementary questions are to bring my thoughts in tact on the topic of discussion and not as a debate.

  

A Personal Appeal:

This is for a second time there has been an occasion for this kind of discussions between you an me. Once in the context of a thread on Alankara Sastra and now at this juncture.

But always my approach is not to confront you as Prof. Nagaraj Paturi Ji. But incidentally it happened to chose certain statements from your postings and a generalized conclusions are tried to be drawn by me.

**Before the interference of the moderators I sincerely apologize if I have made you you to think that I have personally confronted you. Here after I shall take care of not participating in discussions where your lead is progressive.**

**  
**

Finally  I am happy to find place for a statement in your posting:

***I am confident that I can continue to hold Prof. Rani in high esteem, in spite of this intriguingly strange misunderstanding of my posts on his part.***  

  

I feel I am blessed and humbled with your words.

Regards,

**Prof. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
