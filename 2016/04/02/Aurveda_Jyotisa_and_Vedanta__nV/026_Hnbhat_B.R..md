SAnkhya is twofold - निरीश्वरसांख्य and सेश्वरसांख्य. Caraka's सांख्य is specially noted, and the descriptions here are similar to सेश्वरसांख्य.

The terms in the verse quoted दैव and पुरुषकार relates to दैवव्यपाश्रय and युक्तिव्यपाश्रय types of चिकित्सा.

दैव has already been detailed in another thread and पुरुषकार relates to human efforts.
