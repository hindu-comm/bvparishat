1\. Let us all remember that we are in times when all the ancient Indian S&T is attempted to be presented to the younger generation as mere जादू टोना. To overemphasize the daivavyapaas'raya aspects of Ayurveda may add up to this image attempted to be created by the detractors ofthe ancient Indian S&T.Picking out the great achievements of yuktivyapaas'raya of Ayurveda and to present the fact that daivavyapaas'raya is resorted to only as an alternative to and not as a substitute to yuktivyapaas'raya is the need of the hour.

  

2. It is also important to show it to the younger generation that seeking supernatural intervention in medical issues,is not a special feature of the 'Hindu' believers and it is a common human tendency found universally and that there are a huge number of allopathic hospitals all over the world where the staff including doctors, nurses and others resort to 'prayers'. Just a casual net search reveals the prevalence of Christian missionary hospitals all over the world, request for donations for these hospitals including statements that the donation would help evangelism.

  

3\. Does 'Hindu' tradition look down upon the seekers of artha and kaama within the bounds of dharma and force all to seek only moksha? Isseeking moksha essential to be 'healthy'? Is it not enough to be bound by dharmain all the pursuits of artha and kaama , to be healthy? In other words, is moksha-seeking prescribed as essential for health? Or, is it shown that for a person who is already a moksha-seeker, health is helpful in his pursuit, Ayurveda helps him for that purpose? To say that Ayurveda as one of the three cleansing sciences helps the pursuit of moksha is differentfrom saying that he sole purpose of Ayurveda is moksha only.

  

4\. To use the concept of poorvakarma phala (a) to encourage a person to do puNya karma for a future puNya phala (b) to explain the aspects that can not be rationally explained (d) to encourage people for paapavinaas'aka activities of aadhyaatmika saadhana (d) as heuristic concept in the philosophical discussions in Vaidika and avaidika dharma-centric traditions is healthy. To use it to justify the present conditions, 'injustices', as an excuse for human failure, to encourage fatalistic lethargy and inaction is unhealthy.

  

5\. Once these cares are taken, the intertextuality, interdisciplinarity etc. of various Vaidika tradition, when discussed, does not harm the image of the ancient Indian S&T.
