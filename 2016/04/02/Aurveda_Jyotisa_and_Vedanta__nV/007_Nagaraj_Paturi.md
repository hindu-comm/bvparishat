This thread is unnecessarily going haywire.

  

Pertinent questions here are:

  

1\. Is phalajyotisha (of health, what they nowadays call medical astrology), part of either the theory or practice of Ayurveda?

  

Answer to this question is an emphatic 'no'. Texts on Ayurveda do not include phalajyotisha. All vaidyas /bhishaksmay not followphalajyotisha as part of their Ayurvedic practice. Some vaidyas /bhishaks may use their phalajyotisha knowledge. But that they doto make all the 'resources' ofknowledge at their disposal, but not as part of the tradition of practice of Ayurveda.

  

2\. Aetiological discussions in Ayurvedic texts always involve tridosha analysis only and not phalajyotisha aspects. Just as 'aetiology not known' or 'cryptogenic' is recognized in allopathy, the same is recognized in Ayurveda. When such an intriguing situation occurs, the patient may approach a phalajyotisha expert for an explanation and 'remedy' or if the vaidya has confidence in his own phalajyotisha knowledge, may himself resort to finding a 'source' and 'remedy' through that knowledge. This, he does not do as part of the Ayurvedic system, but doeson account of his personal belief system and related knowledge, that is not necessarily connected to Ayurveda as a field. Seeking supernatural intervention when the rational attempts fail, is a tendency found in human beings of a certain orientationall over the world. Incidentally humans with this orientation are far higher in numbers than those who do not seek any such intervention and resign to the answers provided by the rational analysis. Allopathic practitioners and their patients too all over the world, resort to supernatural intervention in conjunction with, or after the failure of the rational attempts. Huge number ofChristian resources are available, so much that just a casual net search yield results such as [this](https://www.google.co.in/?gws_rd=ssl#q=prayers+for+doctors+and+nurses)or[this](https://www.google.co.in/?gws_rd=ssl#q=prayers+for+doctors+during+surgery), or [this](https://www.google.co.in/?gws_rd=ssl#q=prayers+for+nurses+and+hospital+workers)or so many like that.

  

3\. The Advaita Vedantic lines quoted by Dr Joshi, do not make all the Vedanta. Even within Advaita Vedanta when Gajam is faced by Sankara, palaayanam is the wise solution and the answer for why Gajam can not be ignored as mithyaa is, "gajam mithyaa, palaayanam mithyaa. So no wise Vedantin uses the dry Vedantic arguments in the diagnosis ortreatment of diseases.

  

4\. Efficacy of mantras is a different questionalready discussed in the older threads of BVP.
