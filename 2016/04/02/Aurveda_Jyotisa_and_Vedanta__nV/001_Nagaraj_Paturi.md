Dear Dr Joshi,

  

Please provide links to the BVP threads where it was meantioned that (a) Ayurveda is connected to Vedanta (b)Jyotisha is connected to Vedanta (c) Ayurveda, Jyotisha and Vedanta are connected to each other

  

Jyotishaand Ayurveda are never viewed as connected to each other. But there isa section of phalitajyotisha that deals with the astrology of health. There could be health practitioners who combine their astrology of health with their Ayurvedic practice. Majority of the Ayurvedic practitioners today, coming out with their degrees such as BAMS (parallel to MBBS) do not pay attention to astrology of health at all. Most of them do not know about it. Those who know do not believe in it.

  

I can not imagine anyone saying (a) Ayurveda is connected to Vedanta (b)Jyotisha is connected to Vedanta (c) Ayurveda, Jyotisha and Vedanta are connected to each other

  

Ayurveda is connected to Yoga.

  

There is an established tradition of viewing Ayurveda, Yoga and VyaakaraNadars'ana as a mutually connected triad, as a group of 'cleansing' / depolluting sciences.

  

Ayurveda students are taught tarka for logical thinking.

  

Just as allopathic medicine forms part of modern studies containing Botany, Chemistry etc. , Ayurveda makes part of classical Indian studies containing different vaidika dars'anas and other practical sciences of those times such as swarna vidyaa , lohavidyaa, rasavidyaa etc.

  

As long as traditional Sanskrit scholars are imagined to be a bunch of superstitious vestiges of the past, there shall be attempts to help Sanskrit scholarship out of such superstitions.

  

My experience with traditional scholars is that most of them I know pity even those who believe in evil spirit possession etc. as paamarajana. But I never saw them arguing with those believers.

  

If the traditional scolar knows Ayurveda,he treats the symptoms that those believers treat as evil spirit possession as some kind of a vaatadOsha or pittaprakopa, and helps them through traditional treatment without contradicting their belief.

  

Regards,

  

Nagaraj
