Dear Prof. Rani,

  

I probably could have had a similar interaction with one of the more senior family members of mine who are relatively greater traditionalists than I am. They too could have probably asked me not to 'play to the gallery', 'not to present the traditional literature in a way that is acceptable to the audience; in stead ask them to grow up to the level of being able to accept the material as it is'. I would have tried to tell them to realize the situation around and strategize their communication in a way that does not help the detractors of our tradition.

  

Hope, your words

"Here after I shall take care of not participating in discussions where your lead is progressive.'

do not mean you are angry with me.

  

I think your responses were partly triggered by the other threads on BVP of the same time where 'laughing at daivavyapaas'raya kind of things were mentioned, which , I can understand, are not easily accepted byscholars like you.

  

Quite apart from such debates,I would like to express my admiration for the visionary pioneers of Ayurveda like s'sus'ruta and charaka that sorted out the chikitsaavidhaanas of Ayurveda, so muchway backin time, into material-based, supernatural aspect-based and personality/behaviour modification based.

  

That beauty is what is helping us to discuss that material their own vocabulary which is so powerful that it can be taken to be applied to other medical systems too.

  

Please bless us with your colossal expertise to contribute to the betterment of humanity through such aspects of Ayurveda which have antedated modern medicine.

  

Humbleregards,

  

Nagaraj
