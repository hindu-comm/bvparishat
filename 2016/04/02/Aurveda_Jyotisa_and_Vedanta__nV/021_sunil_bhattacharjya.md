**Dear** **Prof. Rani Sadasiva Murtyji,  
  
**

**You have rightly voiced your concern when you said as follows:  
  
**

**Quote**  

2\. Though not directly stated most of the writers on our ancient Indian knowledge systems refuse to talk positively on Predictive Astrology. It is very much unfortunate.

Usually the prominent argument from these authors is:

As there are references to Astronomical matters in the Vedas there are no references to Astrological matters. So Astrology, particularly Predictive part of it is for Bhukti or Bread.  

**Unquote**  
  

To my understanding, there are several reasons for people's distrust in the predictions of the modern day astrologers, even in the case of health. The predictions have gone haywire as the birth-charts are not properly interpreted by today's astrologer. Some of the pitfalls are:  
  
!. The birth chart tells us about what to expect as due to the past karmas (i.e., karmas of the past life) and these are alterable to a great extent by the Karma in the present life. That is why generally the prediction in case of young people becomes more correct than that in the case of the people of advanced age.  
  

2.. Many of the astrologers do not know that the year for "dasha-bhukti" in the Vimshottari dasha is sidereal Lunar years and not Solar Year. The Vayu purana has given the relation between the Solar year and Manushya varsha as follows:  
  

2700 Solar years = 3030 Manushya varsha.  
  

3\. Then there is the free will of the people by which one can nullify many of the results of the past negative actions by resorting to positive actions in the present life.  
  

4\. There can be some degree of inherent uncertainty built up in the astrological sysrem, so that unscrupulous people should not be able to misuse the astrology. There is an anecdote that once Maharshi Bhrigu, when asked by someone, made some predictions about Mother Goddess Parvati and the Mother cursed that nobody would be able to predict the future (absolutely) correctly.  
  

Further elaboration is not possible in this thread, and that will call for a separate thread with a separate subject-heading.

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
