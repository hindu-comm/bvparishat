Here are some of my observations I would like to present here after going through the present post of Shri Nagaraj Paturi Ji.

  

1\. How should we hand over our Ancient Indian S&T to the younger generation?

As we have a younger generation before us about whom we have been facing an alarming situation regarding in what way our inherited ancient Indian Science and Technology should be handed over to them, So also were younger generation to our fathers' generation. Our fathers' generation was younger to their fathers' generation. Thus when we go into the past to the times of Charaka and Susruta all the successive generations to them till our generation or till our next generation all have been younger only.

But never in this chain from Charaka and Susruta to our fathers' generations they were confronted by any such problem regarding in what way or which part of the knowledge of our S&T should be offered to us as their successors. Which part of the stream of knowledge should be ignored or prohibited and which part should be prescribed to read was never a question of their concern. Through generations as whole the entire knowledge has been transmitted to us.

When they never hesitated why should we hesitate to offer as a whole to our next generations?

Though every one of us in the present generation is strongly desirous to free our Indian Knowledge Systems from the fetters of Western influences, domination and forces, **I guess the reason, for our hesitation to offer our knowledge as a whole or to assume or accept the role of becoming the editors of ancient Texts of Charaka and Susruta partly, may be that our Minds are still in western robes**.

  

2\. Other wise is it merely a JADU TONA to speak about our ancient Indian systems of philosophy that speak the Moksha? If others only call it JADU TONA aren't we able retort them with our strength of knowledge?

  

3\. Should a person who seeks Moksha always be weak or shouldn't he be healthy?

  

4\. Can we appreciate if a person attains Artha and Kama going out of the path of Dharma?

  

5\. What is the status of Vajrakaya Nirmanavidhi or Siddha Sarira Nirmana Vidhi in the Ayurveda system which promises one to win over the normal conditions of old age and death?

  

6\. The essence of all disciplines of Ancient Indian Knowledge systems is MOKSHA though Dharma, Artha and Kama are incidental gains. So also with Ayurveda.

  

7\. Is Daiva vyapasraya discouraged or dismissed or discarded by Charaka or Susruta or Vagbhata as an alternative or substitute of Yukti Vyapasraya? Can we find any citations any where in these texts?

  

As I observed these disciplines and Ayurveda all of them have taken enough and perfect care of themselves in being passed to the generations to come for ever.

So we need not take any special care to amend them or edit them as we do wish. If we are successful in offering the knowledge to them as it is that is up to those younger generations what to do further.

  

In this connection I would like to present the views of Charaka in my next post retiring here out of the fear of crossing the limits of space.

Regards,

**Prof. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
