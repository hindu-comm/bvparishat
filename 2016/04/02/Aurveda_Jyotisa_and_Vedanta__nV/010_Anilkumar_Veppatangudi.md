It seems strange to me that the term Vedanta is used as referring to a separate entity. To my limited knowledge, Vedanta means end of Vedas referring to Upanishads. I was also amused to read that 'Vedanta means end of Knowledge' which goes totally against our tradition of non-absolutism. It is said, as you all know, in the Mundakopanishad that there is a greater Knowledge(Para) than Vedas and Vedangas(Apara). Apart from the four Vedas, Vedangas are six - Shiksha, Nirukta, Chandas, Vyakarana, Jyotisha and Kalpa. Jyotisha here means as far as I know, Astronomy and not Astrology.
