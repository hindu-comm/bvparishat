Namaste

On two points focussed by Professor RNI ( and also responding to the issues raised by Professor Paturi - Joshi): The current discussions are criss crossing and mixing the philosophy and principles recognized in Ayurveda calssical texts and practices ( coming along with their diversities and imperfections in delviering the hyped result-claims from practicitioners; and same with Jyoptisha team ). Many good references given in the posts exchanged shows the integral link of Ayurveda -Yoga -Vedanta and Jyotisha. The ' philosophy of Ayurvedic Medical System' is drawn from Vedas and therfore, Ayurveda can not stray away from 'Vedanta -Yoga and Jyotisha'. How much of this is used in current Ayurveda training, practice and across disciplines is our problem to address. It is not a reflection on how the sysem was designed by Sages and early writers or Vedic Risihi's visioned it; and certainly not any reflection on modern scientists who have taken a ' narrow and myopic look at the vedic ssytems and practices'. There is a lot to deliberate and research.

Coming to the points raised by RNI,

**A) On the first point**: The reference to Seasons,Nakshatras and Efficacy of Time recognized as a part of Ayurveda Theory and Practice: Charka Chikitsaa-Sthana - 1-21 to 24 clearly mentions by specific words - 'ayana,tithi, nakshatra and specific details which come from the Vedanga Jyotisha discipline' as an important factor for the practice of Vaidya and administration for ' rasayana'. This is the guiding principle for practice.

More specific references of Ayurveda Vaidya utilizing the ' Jyotisha' disicpline deliberated details for preparation of medicine, administration of aushadha and pariharas are spread over different parts of the work. And some are already covered in the posts.

One point for careful observation in my opinion, in this context is the following ( - an area not researched properly) : Ayurveda as a discipline seems to be focussing on 'Use of the Natures Energy (Prakruti - Kala - Shakti) following different phases of Moon and Seasons ( using Chandra as a Rasa-kaaraka and Manah Karaka) to match the harmony of medicine power and mind-power ( as linked to body processes). As a principle, the relation of Moons phases -Body Mind functioning and Energy of Herbs and medicines is well recognized; though modern science may have serious reservations on this; and modern ' bottled and capsuled Ayur-Veda' practice may not like this ! This is a Vedic Principle that commonly permeates Ayurveda, Yoga, Tantra and Jyotisha. The way Ayurveda uses Jyotisha for ' medicine administration' is certainly different from the way Jyotisha (Phala / Muhurtha) discipline uses it taking relation to Jataka.

Then, what could be the view of 'Charaka-Sushruta-Vagbhata from Ayurveda plank' on use of 'Jataka (Horoscopic kind) used for Phala Jyotisha - Muhurtha and also used for 'roga (6th house)/ Ayush (8th house)- Death -Ayush (12th house)' analysis? There seems nothing to rule out that the disciplines worked together yet, not making cross reference in their works. This 'non-reference / no cross referencing across disciplines' is not uncommon in indian sanskrit writings. This issue may need more research for Textual endorsement substantiating surviving practices.

It would also be interesting to explore how Ayurveda Vaidyas kept their 'medical records and Patient records, uniquely ! Did they entirely rely on their memory ? Or used some mnemonic code? Did they use 'Jataka' as a part of the medical diagnostics and referencing record, as we do know from royal families keeping medical and horoscopic records as 'personal confidential records'? If not what other method was used for social health care records ? What other mode was used to keep track of the ' Patient health hisotry and treatment history' ? Ayurveda as the priamry system of Indian society, a system which bestowed so much care on Health and Wellness, could not have neglected or overlooked the importance of ' accurate medical records of patients and treatment-hisotry ' so critical for ' research'.

**B) On the second point:** Did the ancient authors of Ayurveda, consider only the Annamaya-kosha or did they deal in their logic, analysis and etiology with PraaNamaya and Manomaya koshas too. Even if they did not use such specific terminology, could there have been a theoretical link to the Upanishads such as the MahaanaaraayaNa which originated such terminology?  
  
 Ayurveda deliberation as a 'Medical Philosophy / Philosophy of Medicine' extended far and deeper than 'Body-Matter treatment'. The extent of this expanded deliberation touches as vast a scope as any and all six Darshana Shastras. And main leaning seems to be towards the ' Upanishadic teaching ( and therefore aptly termed as Vedanta based). The attention is drawn to Charka Shaareera Sthana I-13, the interaction of student Agnivesha - Punarvasu Maitreya. The question is: Kva chaitaa Vedanaah sarvah, nivruttim yaanti -asheshatah' ? -When all miseries disapper? The answer is: All miseries end through Yoga and in Moksha. The entire discussions in Chapter 1 to 5 of Shareera Sthana in Charaka contains several quotations indicating the necessity of application of Yoga and Vedanta too in health science in a broader perspective of health science in a broader perspective of the concept of health.

In other words, Classical design of Ayurveda training aimed at
outputting a Vaidya with a Yoga-Vedanta Mind set, just like Artha-Shaastra aimed at outputting a Royal-Sage as a King with a Yoga-Vedanta Mind set. This probably was to build and prioritize ' compassion and pro-life attitude in Vaidya in medical practice' and ' curb the avaricious tendency of using medical services as a money sucker practice'.

This is in keeping with the 'Dharma frame of Ayurveda as a Veda'.

I hope this helps.
