hariH OM,

 One doesn't know which is the appropriate place for all this pompous and high sounding gibberish of Kalicharan mahaashaya. It is based on a wrong understanding of our tradition (e.g. pl see him claiming uttaramiimaaMsaa not to be miimaaMsaa, atharva not to be a Veda etc.). Not only that, his arguments are based on a paribhAShA which is coined by him and used for the sole purpose of putting down well established paribhAShA.

 He is so un-selfconscious that he is indeed making the right statement (about you-know-who) that a ""Village Hindu", not the शास्त्री, who retained the memory of this simple knowledge."

 If he is here to redeem the unlettered (pun intended) from their darkness, it is better to have a formal diikShaa and only those meritorious diikShitas be allowed to learn such esoteric stuff. Let the poor and wretched knowledge seeker be left to his devices and be spared of KT's wisdom. The condescension in his posts and unsubstantiated arguments are insufferable. In case KT wants us to suffer his amorphous ideas, let him present his whole body of work for scholarly evaluation rather than let the hapless knowledge seeker suffer his saMj\~nA and paribhAShA in painful instalments.

svasti,  
 JAYA BHAVAANII BHAARATII,  
 shrivathsa.
