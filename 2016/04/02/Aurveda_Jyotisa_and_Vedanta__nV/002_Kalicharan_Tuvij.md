नमस्ते ।  
  
Vedanta talks about ब्रह्म देवता (प्रातिपदिक - ब्रह्मन्), that the Veda is largely silent about. Veda lent this secret to Vedanta so that ब्रह्म भक्ति would survive. Just as Veda lent other secrets to other Vaidika streams (ensuring no overload to any one stream).  
  
Vedanta is therefore, in no way, the sole proprietor of the Vedic legacy. Vedanta is part, not whole. सांख्य is not वेदांत, मीमांसा is not वेदांत, व्याकरण is not वेदांत, ज्योतिष is not वेदांत, etc; Vedanta is not even "the best of them all" — because in the Immortal Language of Veda, there is no "high and low" or "best and worst".  
  
All the Vaidika streams, are just that : streams; and the overarching, superlatively sophisticated Veda is the Fountainhead. Oddly, it is the "Village Hindu", not the शास्त्री, who retained the memory of this simple knowledge.  
  
Here let me expand the meaning of the word संवर्तन. In material Sciences this idea is known as homomorphism, in life sciences as homology. In simple words संवर्तन (सम् together + वर्तन mutation) means a kind of equivalence between two structures (faith, knowledge or aesthetics systems) where, even though the jargon is not mutual or even of one type, all consistencies are commonly shared.  
  
संवर्तन is a naturalistic principle that can be used to realise worlds (sometimes a Mahabharata, sometimes Cryptology, sometimes Crystallography, sometimes the cult of Durgā, sometimes the larger worlds of a Riemann or a Kähler, sometimes Yoga, and so on) .  
  
संवर्तन is, furthermore, a precise mechanism - and not something allegorical, poetical, philosophical, "protoscience". To know if a relation (between two structures) is संवर्तन or not, the basic requirement is to ascertain the acknowledged location of कुमार in both systems and also the kind of defining morphism that connects the two कुमारs.  
  
Because संवर्तन is a naturalistic principle, or धर्म, of the nature of things, it is either organically evolved through a series of hits and trials (like homology in the history of evolution) interspersed with the interventions of an अवतार here, an अङ्गिरस् there, an Einstein here or a Ramanujan there.  
  
For example, Yoga fits the description and is therefore a संवर्तिन् of वेद. Some other schools, in main those supported by the taxpayer, lost their way - not far downstream the Fountainhead - by the way of being unable to filter down low talent and courtiers.  
  
Neither Ayurveda nor Atharvaveda is a Veda (just because of the word Veda in the name), but at least in the case of Ayurveda we intuitively know that संवर्तन is present. Even in ज्योतिष, in particular among the Southern traditions, all the pillars (even if damaged) of संवर्तन are clearly visible from a mile.  
  
संवर्तन is the only basis of sure knowledge / realisation. In the absence of it, we see two types of foundational mistakes even the well meaning ज्ञाणीs commit:  
  
a) propagating a "conspiracy theory" (at different levels of sophistication). For example, there can be a highly knowledgeable (and sincere) person who may believe that " Jews are the cause of all misery in the world". This will give him an infinite explanatory power (he can invoke the Jew hand behind any cause).  
  
Making "a Jew out of ब्रह्मन्", by veering all the way from नेति नेति to सर्वम् खलु, is another example.  
  
b) making as many number of rules as there are the number of facts (that the rules intend to explain). For example, creating two thousand rules in a grammar where there are two thousand base words. So to explain नहि नहि one relies on the random anecdote involving Shankaracharya, and for नेति नेति some other factoid, and so on. Such systems result in nil explanatory power (inability to deal with new facts).  
  
Now that I have really got to a position with about the right context for discussing संवर्तन as well as the efficacy (including the correct approach for R&D) of Ayurveda, I find that I've already written a long piece. Perhaps, later then.
