On predictive astrology we can have different thread, for I remember having a few astrological related thread a few years back that did not go well.I hope this time it does go well.  

I know there a lot of philosophy in Aurvedic texts. May I request scholars to specifically point to books papers that show relationship between Aurveda and Vedanta.
