Sorry for not being able to join the discussion earlier. There was a network hardware problem at my place.

  

1\. Let me clarify that none of posts inthe related thread were against phalajyotisha. (Hope it suffices to say that I am from a family of Daivajnas such as Sri Pendyala Brahmananda Siddhanti and Sri Paturi Subbaraya Shastri and inherited whatever little I could from the stalwarts.) The point that I was trying to make was that phalajyotisha is not one of the nidaana (diagnosis) tools of Ayurveda nor is grahadoshanivaaraNa coming from phalajyotisha part of Ayurveda chikitsaapaddhati. Ayurveda does not prohibit people from finding reasons for the health problems through the astrology of health.

  

2\. Ayurveda's sharing of the common vaidika s'aastra knowledge from various vaidika s'aastras such as nyaaya, vais'Eshika, saankhya, etc. was also not contradicted by me.

  

3\. The thread initiator Dr. Joshi seems to have been disappointed by the Ayurveda vaidyas who (a) claimed asaadhya rogas to be saadhya for them (b) In treating such extreme cases used grahadoshanivaaraNa pujas, certain mantrasetc. and finally when failed to prove their claims or in other words, when they could not cure the disease, (c) used explanations such as 'your poorva karma is coming in the way of cure' etc. or some other pseudo-vedantic statements.It appeared that he saw all this to be because of the connection between Ayurveda, Jyotisha and Vedanta.

  

That is why, I said, that is not the way, Vedantais used by a proper Ayurvedic doctor in his practice, nor do Ayurvedic texts use the concepts of Vedanta that way.

  

4\. Prof. Rani's following quote has brought into the discussion what I was about to say:

  

दैवमात्मकृतं विद्यात्कर्म यत्पौर्वदैहिकम्।

स्मृत: पुरुषकारस्तु क्रियते यदिहापरम्॥

बलाबलविशेषोऽस्ति तयोरपि च कर्मणॊ:।

दैवं पुरुषकारेण दुर्बलं ह्युपहन्यते।

दैवेन चेतरत्कर्म विशिष्टेनोपहन्यते॥

  

This debate between daiva (fate) and purushakaara (human effort) is the most relevant and important debate in this context. In the western philosophy it takes the form of fate and free will debate. Daivavaadis (fatalists), those who say daiva only works not purushakaara, are the ones who make society nishkriyaapara.



Vaidika texts including itihaasas and puraaNas encourage human effort while recognizing daiva fully.

  

Humbly,

  

Nagaraj
