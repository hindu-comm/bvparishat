Vamanacharya Ramabhatt Jhalakikara is known for his tremendous commentary - BALABODHINI - on Kavyaprakash of Acharya Mammata of 11th Century and not for composing Kavyaprakash.

  

Acharya Jhalakikar covers almost all the important debates featuring in the previous commentaries with regard to poetic terms.

  

Translation of the same into Hindi is long awaited. It is published afresh by Chaukhamba Prakashan, Varanasi and is the most popular commentary on Kavyaprakash a famous poetic treatise prescribed for study in PG and UG courses all over India.
