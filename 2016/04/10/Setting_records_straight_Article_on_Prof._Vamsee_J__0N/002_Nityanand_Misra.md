The government has better jobs to do than ban books. If you feel strongly about it, you may petition a court to issue a writ of mandamus directing the government/police to forfeit the book and ban its publicatioon. You may cite sections [153A](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/345634/), [295A](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1803184/), [502](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1495647/), and [504](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/555306/). Be warned that such a petition may not even be entertained by the court (you may be fined for wasting the time of the court) and may result in an immediate increase in the popularity of the book. Given it is a 110 year old book already available freely on the Internet, a ban may not serve any purpose. Please also read the judgements in two cases: (1) Chandmal Chopra vs State of West Bengal and others, 1988 Crl. L.J. 739, Calcutta High Court, <https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1594975/> and (2) Sarvadeshik Press and others vs Usman Ghani and others, 2008, CM(M) No.588/2008, Delhi High Court, <http://www.jeehcsc.com/judgment?jid=258995>.
