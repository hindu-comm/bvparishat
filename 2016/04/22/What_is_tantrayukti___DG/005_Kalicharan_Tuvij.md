नमस्ते,  
  
तन्त्र युक्ति per se is: "testing of a theory". Testing is done by simulating real world scenario, and running the theory through it. If the theory passes this apparatus, it is good enough for implementation. In fact तन्त्र the word is pretty much related to "implementation". युक्ति on the other hand means "connecting to", so तन्त्र युक्ति means "connecting the apparatus to the theory".  
  
If the theory is about a दर्शन (and not about medicine/ economics/ science/ war, etc), then the testing should consist of experimentations by mental tools, and looking out for inconsistent outputs.  
  
The following paper (on तन्त्र युक्ति) addresses some of these points, and is a good read (barring minor typos):
