Namaste  
  
I should have written earlier on Tantrayukti. I could not because of my schedule.  
  
I thank Prof. Varkhedi ji for referring to my work.  
Thanks also to Shri Udayana Hegde for posting the pdf of my article.  
  
I consider that the previous replies by members of the group on Tantrayukti and also the pdf of my article provide sufficient preliminary information on the topic.  
  
But if there are any specific queries on Tantrayukti and are posted in the group or addressed to my email I will be very happy to provide information to be best of my capabilities.  
  
Though I have done my PhD on the doctrine of Tantrayukti, I am not in a position to share my work. I am yet to publish the same and I am looking for a publisher who can take it up for publication after evaluating its merit.  
  
Still, I attach the content page of my phd thesis that will serve to indicate that direction of my thesis.  
  
regards  
Jayaraman
