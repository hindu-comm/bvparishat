Tantrayukti-s can be taken as the Sanskrit Equivalent of Management Techniques,. 

Among the available ancient texts first time we come across this word as the TITLE of the 15 ADHIKARANA of KATILIYA ARTHASASTRA. In this 15th Adhikarana of Artha Sastra Kautilya speaks of 32 Tantra Yuktis.

These 32 Yuktis deal with the Techniques of Communicative Management in Ancient India particularly in the field of Royal Policy.

In the later centuries we come across this word in the fields of Ayurveda, Astronomy, Ancient Indian Music and Dance, Vastu Sastra etc.
