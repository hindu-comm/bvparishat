Dear Prof. Deshpande Ji

  

You are most welcome. It is entirely my honour to be of help to you.

  

I would like to share with you a melodious rendition of the verse in the voice of the late Purushottam Das Jalota (father of the *bhajan samrat* Anup Jalota, who I have had the pleasure of meeting). My mother is a big fan of Purushottam Das Jalota's singing, and she used to collect his audio cassette tapes in the 1980s and 1990s. I heard this verse being played in my home many times in my childhood. It is much later that I came to know the source when I came across the same verse in the*Śrīmadbhagavatam.*

  

After your email, I listened to the rendition today probably after eighteen or twenty years. Many memories crossed my mind. For this opportunity, I must thank you.

  

Kind regards, Nityananda
