Dear Shankara,

  

  For some reason that I cannot figure out, I tried all these four codes on my DLI downloader, and I get the message that these files are "not found." When I click the links in your email, it does take me to the DLI page, but then a further click for the file viewer tells me "Forbidden.You don't have permission to access on this server." By any chance, if you have successfully downloaded these files, could you send them to me using We-Transfer or Dropbox? Thank you so much in advance.
