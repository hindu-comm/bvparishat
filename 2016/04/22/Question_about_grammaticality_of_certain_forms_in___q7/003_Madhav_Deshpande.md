Dear Shri Nityananda Ji,

  

  Thank you so much for providing a reference for the verse and the commentarial explanations of these expressions. I had come across this verse in a Marathi book describing the wedding procedure, where this verse, among others, is recited as part of the Mangalashtaka verses.
Its occurrence in the Bhagavata Purana explains some of these ārṣa prayogas. Again, thanks for your help.
