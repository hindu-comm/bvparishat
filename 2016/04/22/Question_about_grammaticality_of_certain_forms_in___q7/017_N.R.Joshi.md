Dear Shree Kalicharan, Namaste!



Thanks for reply. Here is my observation. You have used the same meaning of Abhi (at the front) in all words listed below. Is this correct?



If not please correct me.



If yes, do you think the upasarga Abhi has the same fixed meaning in words using Abhi in Sanskrit? Sanskrit scholars differ on the meanings of upasargas-fixed or variable, vaacaka, or dyotaka .



In the dictionary od Apte there are many words starting with Abhi. Did you check your theory of the fixed meaning od Abhi on many of them work or not ?



Please correct me if I were wrong in understanding your posting. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
