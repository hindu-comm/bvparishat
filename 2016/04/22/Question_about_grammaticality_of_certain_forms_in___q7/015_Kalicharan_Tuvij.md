Dr Joshi ji,  
Your reply is much appreciated.  
  
Here is my explanation of the words (along the same उपाय) -  
  
१. अभिक्रम  
अभि = at the front, क्रम = sequence  
अभिक्रम =  
a) enterprise  
e.g., making tea is a sequence, but the same done in a tea stall is enterprise  
b) effort, stepping, ascending : "sequence (at the front / personified)"  
c) any sequence + dynamism  
  
२. अभिसन्धि  
सन्धि = togetherness, of same mind  
अभिसन्धि =  
a) "togetherness in front (of everyone)":  
alliance, joint declaration, (brazen) collusion  
b) "togetherness at the front":  
(common) purpose  
  
३. अभिचार  
चार = conduct, behaviour  
अभिचार =  
a) "conduct at the front"  
good conduct at the front (service, help)  
bad conduct at the front (abusing, cursing, obscene act)  
other conduct at the front (exorcising, treatment, etc)  
  
४. अभिज्ञान  
ज्ञान = knowledge  
अभिज्ञान = acknowledgement ("knowledge at the front")  
  
५. अभ्यन्तर  
अन्तर = middle of two or more finite entities, "inter-"  
अभ्यन्तर =  
a) at the front of the middle (touching some entity): "next", "intimate", "lover"  
b) middleness at the front/ middleness personified: being conversant with many finites  
  
(अन्तर acquired a secondary meaning also: "inside")
