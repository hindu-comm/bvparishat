Your email was received by the group on 27 Apr 2016 00:45 and I was seeing it in my inbox for 3 days. How do you complain moderators have not posred to the group?

If you did not receive in your inbox, it may be for some problems of your mailbox. If you did not receive any replies, it means only that your question was not clear to anybody. That does not mean the moderators have not posted it to the group or it was not received by the group.
