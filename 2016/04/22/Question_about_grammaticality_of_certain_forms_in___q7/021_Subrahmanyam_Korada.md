नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

I've not seen the bhAShya-vivaraNam of govindAmRRita-muni in published form.

Have you seen any published edition? Please, provide information about the same for benefit of students of mImAMsA.

I have discussed this issue in 2010-2011 . Most of the scholars , it seems , do not know about this विवरणम् ( just like महावाक्यम् , some think that it is only in वेदान्त)।

  

The मीमांसादर्शनम् , with five commentaries was published by Tara Printing Works, Kamacha , Varanasi 221010 in 2006(Reprint of 1987) - प्रस्तावना is by Vidvan Pattabhiramasastri .

  

The book is full of errors - not properly proofred .

  

Pl find the snapshots.

  

धन्यो’स्मि
