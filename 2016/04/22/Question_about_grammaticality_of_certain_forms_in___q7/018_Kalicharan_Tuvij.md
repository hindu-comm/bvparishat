Yes the meaning is the same, but as I said earlier, I believe it is non-verbal (I used the term hyper-geometric for it). "At the front" though a good approximation is verbal. That's why I made use of some other terms (personifiedetc) to bolster the non-verbal meaning whenever required.

Yes, the same non-verbal meaning, in my opinion. Scholars differ, because they don't take into account the non-verbal aspect dominated bydaivika.

  

Let me put this framework- in a most reductionist way possible - as under:

  

A\) Sanskritphonemes are like points.

B\) Sanskrit words are equivalent to curves.

C\) Sanskrit sentencesareequivalent to surfaces.

D\) Sanskrit narratives are equivalent to volumes.

  

Every word, in this view, is like a story - because a curve is a succession of points.

Cross sections of curves are points, cross-sections of surfaces are curves, and so on.

  

The R, L, C - matrices mentioned in the BVP thread "Specifics of Sanskrit VarNamAlA" are a good place to locate the "points" relative to each other.

  

Please note that this is onlya broad framework.

I didn't check the words in the dictionary, since I am not doing curve-fitting (but following the framework just mentioned). I believe that this "hyper geometry" is synonymous with grown/ growing consciousness (about the world)of a Rshi â€”similar to visualisations (about the material world) used by Scientists and Mathematicians.
