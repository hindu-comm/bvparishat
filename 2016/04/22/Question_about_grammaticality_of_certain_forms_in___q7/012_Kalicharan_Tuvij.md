नमस्ते,  
  
अभि = at the front, foremost  
युक्त = engaged, connected  
  
So, अभियुक्त = "foremost engaged"  
  
In this way अभियुक्त can be -  
The accused in a judicial proceeding,  
The leading scholar of the day in a field,  
A machine/ युक्ति used predominantly,  
A person with the right युक्ति /skill-set appointed ("sent forward") to a post,  
Engaging (enemy) from the front, etc.  
  
Sanskrit words are ultimately based on "hyper geometric concepts" (that is non-verbal). Verbal meanings are secure only if they are sourced in non-verbal ideas. The above explanation of अभियुक्त should be, therefore, considered as a verbal explanation (and a non-authoritative, personal opinion).  
  
regards,
