नमो नमः।

I am extremely grateful to respected Korada Sir for the detailed explanation with various references from the शास्त्र-s.

In the शास्त्रग्रंथ-s that I have come across during the course of my limited study, I have always seen that the word अभियुक्त has invariably been used in exactly the same sense as explained with examples by Korada Sir.

That is exactly why I was rather surprised when I saw the word being used in the government’s official documentation or by the politicians in the sense of “an accused”. When I noticed the word used recently by Korada Sir, I thought I should request him to explain the correct meaning.

Another minor hitch is that Apte’s dictionary also gives reference of मृच्छकटिकम्‌ wherein the word अभियुक्त has been used for “an accused”. Could it have been a loose, colloquial or a slang usage in the drama?

धन्योऽस्मि।
