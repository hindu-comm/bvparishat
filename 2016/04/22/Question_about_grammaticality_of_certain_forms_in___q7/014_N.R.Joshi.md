Dear Kalicharan, Namaste!



I enjoy reading your postings on BVP. Now you gave meaning of the prefix Abhi in the word Abhiyukta.



Will you please explain to me your thoughts on the same prefix in the following words?



Using your knowledge of the upasarga Abhi please explain the differences between the



\(1\) Abhikrama and karma,



\(2\) Abhisandhi and sandhi,



(3)Abhicaara and caara



\(4\) Abhijn\~aana and jn\~aana



\(5\) Abhyantara and antara



Thanks. N.R.Joshi
