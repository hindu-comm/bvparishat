Dear Kalicharan ji,

  

Let me put this framework- in a most reductionist way possible - as under:

  

A) Sanskritphonemes are like points.

B\) Sanskrit words are equivalent to curves.

C\) Sanskrit sentencesareequivalent to surfaces.

D\) Sanskrit narratives are equivalent to volumes.

  

Every word, in this view, is like a story - because a curve is a succession of points.

Cross sections of curves are points, cross-sections of surfaces are curves, and so on.

  

  

I believe that this "hyper geometry" is synonymous with grown/ growing consciousness (about the world)of a Rshi —similar to visualisations (about the material world) used by Scientists and Mathematicians.  

  

Wonderful line of thought.

nks
