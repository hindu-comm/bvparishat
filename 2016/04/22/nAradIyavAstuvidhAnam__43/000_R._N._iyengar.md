Dear Scholars,

I am looking for a book by the nameनारदीयवास्तुविधानम् . In manuscript form (Grantha lipi) this is available at Adyar Library. However, Stella Kramrisch in her monumental monograph "The Hindu Temple" (Vol II) has reproduced two chapters (8 and 10) of the above ancient text in Devanagari as an Appendix. I suspect the other chapters may also be available in Devanagari. I request members to provide pointers towards the availability of this text. For quick recognition I have attached the two published chapters. In the 10th Chapter the Vastupurusha is mentioned as changing his position every 3 months or so. Is there any other text which explains this "Charavaastu" and the principle behind this ?

regards

  

RN Iyengar
