Dear Prof.Murty garu, Thanks for taking interest in my post and responding in detail. The information you have provided is certainly useful for me.

It appears sthira vastu was applied for Temples, and perhaps Towns, which of course makes sense. But the other variable position of the Purusha is philosophically, the Year, the moving Time.

What intrigues me and hence interesting for further investigation is the equation of Vastupurusha with Chaagaasura (in some books) and Naagaraaja (in some other books). This Vaastu-Serpent

has similarities with the PhaNi-chakra found in some Jyotisha books on "seed sowing" depending on the position of Raahu in relation to the 27 Nakshatras. There is a Panchangam in Tamil, which goes by the brand name "Paambu-pancangam" because it exhibits this sinuous (Sinusoidal) Serpent on its cover page prominently. This in turn is connected with the ecliptic and Raahu the Eclipse Causer as understood and handled in the pre-siddhantic period.

So please post if you come across Vaastu-Naagaraaja and his positions! Incidentally, I can read Telugu script easily even though understanding literary Telugu (language) takes time.

Once again thanking you

with regards

  

RN Iyengar
