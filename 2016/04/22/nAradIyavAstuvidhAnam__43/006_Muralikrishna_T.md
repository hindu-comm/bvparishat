Dear sir,

Please refer Vastuvidya with sanskrit Commentary (of mahadeva shastry) published from Chaoukhamba edited by Shreekrishna Jugnu and Vastushastra Vivekamu (in telugu) in 4 Volumes by Late Madhura Krishna Murthy Shastry, Rajamundry. Many hints are available regarding the topics conversed here.

Thank you
