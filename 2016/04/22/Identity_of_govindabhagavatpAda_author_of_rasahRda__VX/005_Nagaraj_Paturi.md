After some amount of search, now I realize that this book is highly familiar to the Rasa shastra students of Ayurvedic colleges.

  

The period of authorship of the book seems to be when many Jain Rasa shastra books were being written. Soit is possible that this author is a Jain.

  

Words like Bhagavan are also frequently used in Jain books.
