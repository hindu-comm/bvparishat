Rasahridayatantra is a book on alchemy. Most of the references to this book mention the author Govinda Bhagavatpada to be 9th century AD. This date itself shows that to consider that he is the guru of Sankara Bhagavatpada is a mistaken identity.

  

But this book seems to be highly popular in circles interested in alchemy.
