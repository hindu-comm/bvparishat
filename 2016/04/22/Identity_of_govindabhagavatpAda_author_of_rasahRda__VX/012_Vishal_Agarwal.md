Sometimes, the following two works are also ascribed to Govindabhagavatpada:

  

1. Yogataravali (at other times, attributed to Shankara): This work exists with a commentary wherein sometimes the mula verse are attributed to Govinda and the bhashya to Shankara. At other times, both to Shankara. Or sometimes the verses to Hastamalaka and bhashya by his teacher Shankara.

2. Paramarthasara of Shesha, different from its more popular recast by Abhinavagupta later.

  

Both of these are published several times. Let me know if you need copies electronically.

  

Regards,
