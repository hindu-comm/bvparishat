Dear Colleagues,

  

  This morning I came across on DLI a 1927 publication by Motilal Banarsidass of a work titled Rasahṛdayatantra by an author named Govindabhagavatpāda. Here is the DLI source:<http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/handle/2015/369609>

  The editor of the work claims that this author is the same as the teacher of Shankaracharya. I am not aware of any surviving works of Govinda, the teacher of Shankaracharya. So this claim in the introduction to Rasahṛdayatantra came across as a surprise to me. 

   I am wondering if any members of the BVP have looked at this work, or have heard of any other works of Govinda, the teacher of Shankaracharya. Any light on this issue is welcome.
