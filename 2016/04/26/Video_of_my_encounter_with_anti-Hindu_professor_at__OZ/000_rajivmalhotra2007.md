I was invited last week to deliver a lecture at Columbia University by various Hindu groups. The topic was "*Hinduism is Academia*".  
  
Please watch the professor from Wendy Doniger's university trying to hijack during the Question & Answer. His two Indian students shouted "down with Hindutva" and left the room.  
  
Also watch the audience comments at the very end.  
  
This is a good sample of numerous such encounters I have with the US academy.
