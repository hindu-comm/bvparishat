Dear list members,

  

Best wishes to all for the new Saṃvatsara which begins today.

  

Please find attached the Śrīrāghavīya Pañcāṅga for Vikrama Saṃvat 2073. compiled by Dr. Rāmādhāra Śarmā (Patna) and copy-edited by me. The Pañcāṅga is for Citrakūṭa (25°N and 80.83° E). It is in Hindi and follows the Pūrṇimānta system prevalent in northern and eastern regions of the country. The times for sunrise and sunset are the times of apparent sunrise and apparent sunset respectively.

  

All major Hindu, Jain, Buddhist, Sikh, and national festivals are shown along with other vrata-s, Bhadrā times, etc in the last column.

  

For any questions on the definitions of columns and formulae used, members are requested to go through this [thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bvparishat/5q4huzVJlnE),where some of the questions raised by scholars last year were answered, and especiallythis [post](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/5q4huzVJlnE/eXXctbyi2ccJ),where I had cross-verified the sunrise and sunset time in the Pañcāṅga with the NOAA Solar Calculator on the website of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) . For any further doubts, please get in touch with me off the list. 

  

Thanks, Nityānanda
