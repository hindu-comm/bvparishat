The article fwd by Veernarayan ji is about Ganesh and Rajiv. Mr. Nityanand is unnecessarily dragging Kalavai Venkat.

The funniest part of nityanand's mail is this "However, discussing the writings of abusive trolls like this author who calls himself Kalavai Venkat"

What else should Kalavai Venkat call himself?  
It is easy to do Editor work sitting in your room sipping your favorite drink and eating your favorite food. Kalavai has been fighting so many adharmic forces so long. He has been threatened and physically attacked many times by adharmic forces. This is because he doesn't compromise on truth. His next book about which i know a little is a path breaking work. Mr. Nityanand till now will not have written one word against adharmic forces publicly. He is a coward and opportunist. But Kalavai is a fearless lion. It will be better if the moderator puts a brake on loudmouths who do no work on their own but come out as self appointed referees to decide who is troll and who is scholar. For every sane person the double talk that Kalavai is attacking is very clear. Defending Deshpande's double standards is a troll's work.
