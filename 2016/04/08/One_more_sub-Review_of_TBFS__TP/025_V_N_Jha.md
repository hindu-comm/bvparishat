Thank you Prof. Kapoor. I am sorry. To be frank, I do not get now-a-days sufficient time to read all mails. I had read some of them earlier and thought the good sense will prevail and it will stop. Yesterday I just opened and found it still continues. So I made an appeal. I am glad that you found it useful.

Raghunathashiromani in his Padarthatattvanirupana says ( you might have heard it from me several times before !)

  

दूष्यं मे वच; परं निपुणं विभाव्य /

भावावबोधविहितो न दुनोति दोष: //

  

Come and criticize what I have said, but only after deep reflection. The defect pointed out after having understood what I wanted to say does not disturb me. Rather I am happy because the defect will be removed.

When such is our tradition. Is there any scope for emotional outburst ? Let us bring back that tradition and request our Government to take it to every home. That will be empowerment in real sense of the term.
