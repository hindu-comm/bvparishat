Let us concentrate on the intended appeal of Shri Rajiv Malhotra i.e. to know as clearly as possible the purvapksha and then respond. Then alone either acceptance or rejection can follow. I do not understand what is wrong in his appeal.

The most rational step in that direction has been planned by Prof. K.S.Kannan and the Gautama Academy. We may be great scholars in our fields but if we do not know the clear meaning of the purvapaksha our response will carry no meaning. This has been our tradition and let us stick to this. Rajiv Malhotra is fighting the battle single handedly . Let us extend our support to him, not emotional but rational and rationality will emerge only when we know what is the intention of the opponent. If the opponent is using a language of discourse with which we are not familiar, is it not rational to acquaint ourselves with that idiom and intention of the opponent ? Otherwise the response may become laughable . As I understood, Shri Rajivji wanted to say that.

  

There is no need to classify the responses as 'activist's' or otherwise.

  

Let us promote our vaada-paramparaa. Let there be no vivaada since we all are interested in arriving at the Truth. Let everybody participate keeping the same goal in mind.
