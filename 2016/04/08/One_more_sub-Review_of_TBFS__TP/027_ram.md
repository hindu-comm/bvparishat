To be candid, I must admit that I have not been reading many mails. But somehow as I happened to read a few in this thread, I was reminded of the verse:  
  

> परस्परविरॊधॆ तु वयं पञ्च च तॆ शतम् \| अन्यै: साकं विरॊधॆ तु वयं > पञ्चाधिकं शतम् \|\|  
> (supposed to have been said by Dharmaputra)  

I may be corrected if I had quoted wrongly.  
  
Best regards,  
-ram.
