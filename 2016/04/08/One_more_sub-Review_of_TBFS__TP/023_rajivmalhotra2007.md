I agree with Shri Varakhedi's wise advice. Let us work together. Prof Kannan's independent initiative is a great start to bring together his home team which could be the best vehicle to take this movement forward.  
  
I am delighted at the immense interest that has been generated over Pollock very recently. Until recently, Pollock was unopposed in India. For example, please note that:  

-   For 8 years in a row the prestigious Jaipur Literature Festival
    showered him annually, with numerous panels showcasing him as the
    greatest Sanskritist and Indologist in the world. Not a single voice
    opposing him was invited ever to these panels.  
-   Government of India gave him Padma Shri.  
-   Sringeri peetham was on the brink of handing over to Columbia
    University, under his oversight, the international representation of
    the teachings of Adi Shankara. *That was my urgent reason for the
    2-year project to write TBFS*. The whole story is explained in my
    book's Introduction. -   Murty Classics Library under his control is planned to do 500
    volumes - unprecedented in our history, and with cataclysmic
    consequences in the long run.  
-   You can see how the English language media came to his defense last
    month, with strong attacks against everyone who opposed him. You can
    judge the deep-rooted support base he has built. I doubt any
    European Indologist in the past enjoyed so much widespread support
    among Indians across the spectrum.  
-   A whole parampara of his students, supportive writers, media, etc
    are in key posts across India, mainly among the English language
    elites. They are well organized, assertive and vocal in attacking
    anyone who dares to oppose him.

Please note that these things concerning the Pollock school of Indology are not new or sudden. They developed systematically over a period of 40 years. He told me that there had never been a purva-paksha of his work from a broad, critical perspective of the tradition. But now we seem to have a counter movement to take a critical look.  

  

I felt it would take 2 years after TBFS to get enough serious persons in India interested to take up such a project. I am glad it has happened much faster. Hopefully, I will soon be able to move on to my next topic of research and publishing.

  

Thanks to all.

Regards,

rajiv
