Scurrilous and pathetic article, to say the least: abusing one of the tallest scholars of Sanskrit in the world, comparing a group of scholars with Hitler Jugend, and what not. Just goes on to show the journalistic standards (rather the lack of any) of the website. No wonder they publish the likes of Kalavai Venkat and author of the above article. The website does not even list its editorial board members on either the [About Us](http://hindureview.com/about-us/) or the [Contact Us](http://hindureview.com/contact-us/) page.
