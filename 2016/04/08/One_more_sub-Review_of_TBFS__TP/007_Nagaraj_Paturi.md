The points to be noted from this article of Dr S Kalyanaraman are:

  

1\. Sri Kalavai Venkat's article on Prof. Deshpande is dated February 8th, 2006. This has nothing original or new in it. It has selectedsome portion of the article by Dr S Kalyanaraman dated January 26th , 2006.

  

2\. Both the articles are dated year 2006. The context seems to be the Text book controversy of that year in the state of California.

  

3\. Both seem to be among those who did not like the stand taken by Prof. Deshpande during that controversy.
