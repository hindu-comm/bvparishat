Dear BVP management

  

An honoured member of this group, who is on your Advisory Board, is being personally attacked just because the member below does not like his views. The mail by Subrahmanya below is not academic criticism, it is character assassination (and may I add trolling). This is unacceptable. I request you to step in. If the management cannot defend its own Advisory Board members, it will send out a very wrong message.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
