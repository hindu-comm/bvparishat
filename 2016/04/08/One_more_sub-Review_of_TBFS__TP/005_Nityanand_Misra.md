Rajeev Ji

  

Many of sources cited in your list are also non-reliable for the purposes of research and/or scholarly discussion. The reviews/articles by Jithu, Suresh Vure, Raja B, Anon, Sejuti Banerjea, Prof. V V Raman, Akash Ravianandan, Kanakagiri Siddhartha, Nithin Sridhar, etc are all personal blog articles or articles on some other blog (Speaking Tree blog). Amazon is a marketplace, and so compilation of reviews on Amazon are also best ignored. I would request you to refrain from citing such blog articles or marketplace reviews. Yes, reviews by scholars or journalists like Bibek Debroy, R Jagannathan, etc are welcome for discussion, but somewhere we have to draw a line.

  

My personal opinion is that we have had enough discussion on the review of TBFS by Shatavadhani Ganesh Ji and we have also seen Rajiv Ji's response. The topic has been discussed over and over again, and I am tempted to say अलं पिष्टपेषणेन. If we keep on starting a new thread on a response by every X to a response by every Y to a response by every Z to the review by Shatavadhani Ganesh Ji to book by Rajiv Malhotra Ji, there will be no end.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
