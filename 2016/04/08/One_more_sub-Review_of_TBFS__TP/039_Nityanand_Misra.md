Dear Vishvas

  

One can turn the argument around and say you are trying to patronize unnecessarily by trying to act like a moderator (when you are not one): being judgemental about my tastes and offering me unsolicited advice.

  

If at all I have a distaste, it is for half-baked scholarship, intellectual dishonesty, and trolling (nothing personal against half-baked scholars, anonymous bloggers, and trolls). I have protested againstnon-academic, anonymous, questionable, and/or abusive sources on this list (Vadayakil, manasataramgini, kalavai, et al) and will continue to do so.

  

Let me turn your suggestion around and say if you do not like my posts, you are free to move on to the replies and threads which suit your taste.

  

Thanks, Nityanand
