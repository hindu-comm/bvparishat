We read very often 'we should focus on scholarly works' very fine and well warranted but in which direction?????

I repeat from the above,

  

'...If one is comfortable with the derogatory misinterpretation and attempts to destruction of our Socio-Cultural heritage against which TDFS is trying to awake,he/she is free to sit in peace BUT if one in visionary enough and feels its possible repercussions on the future generations of India, whom TDFS is really directed to, must not only stand up but join hands and fight "staregically".

  

"strategically"\~ Strategy , is the most important dimension in success of any mission, academic defense corporate or any..... if this aspect is not given due attention mission is bound to fail. What TDFS introduces is one of the possible strategies and therefore can not be ignored by sensible and sensitive scholars.

  

and those sensitive enough have started in this direction as referred to above, for example planned Conference series byProf. K.S.Kannan.

  

Of course, one is FREE to follow his or her own way of working and strategy.

Inconclusive, unnecessary repetitions should be avoided.

Regards

Sati Shankar
