Sir, you were patronizing (by trying to impose your tastes on the entire list) I am not trying to patronize because I was restoring the propriety of diversity of tastes. If A patronizes XYZ, and B says, "don't patrionize", that does not mean that B is patronizing. Similarly, if A is intolerant to something and wishes to impose that as a norm, and B is intolerant of that intolerance - they are two different things.  

  

Also, I am not in favor of abandoning judgement or viveka. Of course we judge each other all the time. All I say is that don't impose it on others. Further, my advice was not directed at you specifically, and of course, by all means, please feel free to continue your protests " againstnon-academic, anonymous, questionable, and/or abusive sources". I only wanted to counter that protest, and prevent it from affecting the moderation policy.

Completely baked scholarship is extremely hard to find (though people may try to claim "bakedness" with various gimmicks such as "upload my review to [academia.edu](http://academia.edu)"). There are merely multiple levels of "bakedness" in scholarship. At the lower end of this spectrum are journalistic articles (many of which shrI nityAnanda considers worthy of this same forum). The anonymous bloggers are no worse.  
  

Reg. shrI ajita's request - "The list had agreed to the advise of Prof. Jha and others not to open this thread unless we have something substantial or new to discuss. Please don't post or reply unless you need to. Thanks. All views have been discussed we had enough of this."  

Though I don't believe that any one of us is capable of speaking for the list ("it's agreed to xyz advice, it has had enough"), I clarify that the (meta-)views presented by me have not been discussed in this thread before. As adviced, I will not unnecessarily drag the matter.
