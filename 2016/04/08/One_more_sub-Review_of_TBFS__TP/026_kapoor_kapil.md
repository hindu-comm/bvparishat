Absolutely Prof. Jha ji. I tto got a little tired of every one questioning Rajiv ji' Sanskrit scholarship, and even speaking for Sri Sheldon Pollock who is totally anti- Hindu - he wants to take away every virtue of the Hindu civilization, including Sanskrit. He has subverted the minds of generations of our bright students and turned them anti-Indian.

  If we know better, why not argue against his contentions. If there are any takers I can upload some quotes from Sri Pollock that invite a critique. Let us show we know better and not, typically, fight among ourselves.

My regards to all, particularly to Jha ji and Rajiv ji fulfilling the*kshatra dharma - shaastra* defended by *shastra..*
