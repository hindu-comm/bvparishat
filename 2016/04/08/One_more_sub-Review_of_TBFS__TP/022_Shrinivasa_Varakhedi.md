With the appeal and advise by Prof V N Jha Ji, we now need to put an end to this vivAda. No use of continuing such vAda, which will end up with enmity within the home team. Yes, what we come to know is we have different approaches. We also learnt from this debate nobody has said ultimate. We must accept nobody is sarvajna here. We must also acknowledge that we all including Shri Rajiv Ji and Dr. Ganesh Ji are working for good cause. We must note that this has been clearly expressed by Ganesh Ji while appreciating the work done by the author of TBFS. Yet, he has shown some possible improvements in the work. I have no doubt that this review is nothing but an academic exercise. However, while making comments the authors could have been more polite. I request Shri Rajiv Ji take this in a positive manner and not to give any scope for misunderstanding in this regard. At the same time, repeatedly shri Rajiv is making it clear that he needs support of home team who can support him to continue this battle. He wants to work with the traditional scholars acting as a Purva-pakshin in such debates. His words may sound like provocative but intension is to make traditional scholars alert. However, Many including myself felt that the words he used while attacking home team members are harsher than those he employed against outsiders. This need not be taken seriously by us/others.  
  
Prof. Kannan has already initiated one such dialogue. I am informed by Dr. S R Leela Ji (a member of ICOR) that icpr has shown interest to support such dialogues. I therefore fold-handedly request all who are involved in this, to stop at this point and continue to do this debate face to face. The writings on lists and blogs will widen the gap.  
  
Hope, all BVP members will cooperate with us. Hereafter I request the list management to allow the thematic discussion but not criticisms be it any kind.  
  
With best regards  
Shrivarakhedi
