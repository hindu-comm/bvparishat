Dear Prof Kapoor,



As Suggested by Prof Jha” The most rational step in that direction has been planned by Prof. K.S.Kannan and the Gautama Academy.” Let all scholars consolidate their views and get regular papers or organise seminars and then share the experience with the group. All you views about Prof. Pollock and Rajiv’s book needs to go into the paper or into the seminar suggested by Prof Kannan. Simply uploading quotes and inviting varied criticism will not work. We are as Rajiv has said dealing with a scholar of very high repute. Presenting full-fledged papers and books will reduce emotional out bursts and will bring in more objectivity. This would be the best way to move forward is my opinion.
