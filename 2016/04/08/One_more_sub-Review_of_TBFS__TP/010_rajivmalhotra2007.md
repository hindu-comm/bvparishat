RNI ji says his private email to Shri Pandurangi got forwarded to this public forum - with an endorsement saying "This is what I agree to."  
  
This has degenerated the forum into a free-for-all activism devoid of scholarship.  
  
It seems one can score any points against someone X, simply by pointing to a link by a random person Y that is written in some context Z. Is this a standard of scholarship?
