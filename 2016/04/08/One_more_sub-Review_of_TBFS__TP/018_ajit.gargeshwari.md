Here is my reply. I hope Anjan's mail is not paid advise, if he considered what I wrote as free advise. I did not ask any one to stop writing but wanted to know how postings such as these serve the list objectives. As Nityanandaji has said "If we keep on starting a new thread on a response by every X to a response by every Y to a response by every Z to the review by Shatavadhani Ganesh Ji to book by Rajiv Malhotra Ji, there will be no end.
