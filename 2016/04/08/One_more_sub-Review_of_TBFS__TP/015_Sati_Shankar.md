There is a well known line most of us quote while speaking.... "survival of the fittest"

It is well known by now to most that Western Indologists and those in other disciplines where there is a liberty to interpret to significant level, like humanities and Social Sciences, have set their own codes of survival. Those who have been in the Western Universities and Institutions with an objective mindset must be aware, that the the "code of conduct" set there has created stone walls. If one conforms to their "codes of conduct", thinks within their strategically well defined "framework" only then he/she will be able to publish and survive, otherwise blacklisted or put in total black out altogether.

In hard sciences, like mathematics, physics, engineering etc etc where such lofty socio-cultural interpretations are not possible we find no such issues of cultural misinterpretation, but then there are "other" criteria to filter, It is not strange, Interestingly, similar stone walling can be found within our own country if we make inter-regional comparison..I do not want to go in to that here as this forum is supposed to be not for that.

  

After going through various reviews, criticisms and replies thereof, I think in many cases we just get carried away by emotions and derail ourselves from the main line of objectives and related thinking.

  

Clearly If we look at The Defense For Sanskrit, to find something in its structure and presentation like any other Sanskrit grantha, one may be disappointed because it is certainly not a Sanskrit text but if we try finding what this book advocates in its plain English and if we are objective enough to know clearly where we are sitting, ie, if we are not bound by any pre-supposed "code of conduct", we will find that this book, which its author himself calls a "humble beginning" to knock on the minds of the people to rise and know their adhikAra over their own intellectual and socio-cultural heritage and fight to retain in our own possession.

  

I was surprised seeing questions asking how much Sanskrit Mr. Malhotra knows, some questioned on his authority to write on Sanskrit, I am sorry to say, it itself shows the irrationality and lack of exposure of the questioner himself.

Note those who apply mathematics in physics, economics, engineering or life sciences etc are not mathematicians as such, but their applications work, taking it other way round, many mathematicians venture in many fields of applied mathematics, say for example a statistician or an expert in probability enters stock market, he does not become expert in stock market otherwise, most such mathematicians could have become billionaires.

What I want to say is that at the top level most disciplines converge and there come a synergy between research methodologies or respective disciplines... and that synergy works and results come up as effective, correct and acceptable.. so far as the objectives of the exploration is concerned.

  

In case of TDFS, its Sanskrit, underlying authority etc is concerned, no matter what its form and presentation, it clearly raises voice against misinterpretation of our texts and scriptures which may have long term implications due to induction of such interpretations into school text books and reference books like Encyclopedias and Handbooks. The way digital sources are being controlled and made available selectively by prioritizing the key word searches, situation is becoming more and more dangerous. Again "dangerous" to us, sitting on the other side of Western stone wall.

  

I take it liberally. In one is comfortable with the derogatory misinterpretation and attempts to destruction of our Socio-Cultural heritage against which TDFS is trying to awake,he/she is free to sit in peace BUT if one in visionary enough and feels its possible repercussions on the future generations of India, whom TDFS is really directed to, must not only stand up but join hands and fight staregically.

  

It really unfortunate to get derailed from the objective by our own ego. We cite vidyA dadAti vinayam, vinayam dadAti pAtratAm.... it seems we, i am sorry to say, proclaim to have vidyA but have lost our pAtratA.

  

Best wishes

Sati Shankar
