Thank you very much Prof. Kapoor. In fact Prof. K S Kannan is planning to get critically examined the statements of Pollock. It will indeed be very useful if you pass on those materials to him. I shall also write to him to be in touch with you. Certainly, we must respond to such attempts to misinterpret Indian past to suit their ideology. For that absolutely academic approach is necessary. We must expose their hidden agenda.
