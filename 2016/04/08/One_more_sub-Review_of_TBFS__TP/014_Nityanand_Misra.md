I believe this part is already answered by Prof. Paturi Ji, that it is a pen name.

Can I request you to please back these claims with some sources? When and where were has this person (who lives in the USA where police is quick to act and free speech is backed by the First Amendment) been threatened and physically attacked? Any police reports or news articles which confirm this? 

  

Thanks, Nityanand
