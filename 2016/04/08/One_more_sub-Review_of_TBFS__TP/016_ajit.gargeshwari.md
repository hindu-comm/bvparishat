Anjan, we need less of posts like this and more serious academic discussions here. I hope threads such as TBFS are wound. Up quickly. We need less of lions and more objective workers. No need to post back l hope you got my message thanks. This is perhaps the first time in history a book review is discussed so much. If we continue we may have to read a a billion mails as more advisors han a million book has been printed. Thanks.On Apr 9, 2016 00:24, Anjan Chattopadhyay \<[anjan.cha...@gmail.com]()\> wrote:
