Dear sirs,  
  
Hoping that people have cooled down, I wanted to return to this thread just to point out the following "meta" points:  

-   "discussing the writings of abusive trolls like this author who
    calls himself Kalavai Venkat would be a waste of time for this
    esteemed list" is an unnecessarily patronizing attitude that
    generalizes one's one personal (dis)tastes (vis a vis say Kalavai
    venkat) to the entire list. We can see that members like shrI
    vIranArayaNa and RN Iyengar and many others find it worth their time
    to discuss this. Those not interested can just move on to threads
    that suit their narrower(?) tastes.  
-   As the [screenshot here](http://i.imgur.com/S32Ckrk.png) , reveals,
    threads of these sorts do not dissuade discussion of other topics.
    So, no hand wringing or grand-mothering is necessary. People
    naturally move on with time, and know how to use this communication
    resource well.  
-   Insightful comments can be mixed with other rhetorical elements. One
    can just ignore or note the latter and take the former. They are
    natural parts of human speech, and one need not be too uptight and
    ape the western academy which is makes a farcical show of
    objectivity while actually being biased. Please consider that our
    own scholars have studied and written titles like "Appayya
    kapolachapetika" and "madhva-mukha-mardanam".  

At a still higher level, given the dominance of personalities in this debate, I wanted to repeat the suggestion of sages that personal loyalties and friendships should not supersede one's notion of what's right and proper. This is what sItAparityAga and verses such as "द्वेष्योऽपि संमतः शिष्टस्तस्यार्तस्य यथौषधं । त्याज्यो दुष्टः प्रियोऽप्यासीदङ्गुलीवोरगक्षता" tell me। So, I hope that the wise will consider the words and deeds of KV, RM, SG, MD etc.. impartially, while allowing them a chance for regret where it is due.
