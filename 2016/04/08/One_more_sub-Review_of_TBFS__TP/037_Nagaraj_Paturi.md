Each ofthe members of the advisory board of BVP ,

  

Prof. Ashok Aklujkar, Prof. Dipak Bhattacharya, Prof. Madhav Deshpande, Prof. Amba Kulkarni, Prof. K.S. Kannan and Prof. R.N. Iyengar

  

have his or her own area of expertise or ideological position.

  

In terms of ideological positions, inclusion of Prof. Madhav Deshpande whose ideological position as more bent towards the liberal, left and enlightenment age spirit side is clear from his publications and other expressions, brings a very good balance, which Dr Gargeshwari tries to securerepeatedly,to the ideological composition of the advisory board.

  

Though the remaining members of the advisory board may haveideological similarities among themselves, minor differences among their positions too have been decently, politely and courteously expressed on various occasions. That adds to the beauty of balance of the group.

  

Polemics are the beauty of any scholarly discussion and the forums meant for it. To have a strong purvapakshin to engage with is the whole fun of a good polemical discussion. Mutual respect of the participants in such an academic endeavour is an essential precondition ofthat endeavour.

  

Members of the list (or any such forum) may engagemembers of the advisory board, list owners, moderating team members or any other such member of the management in such debates. But in stead of making generalized comments, it is healthier to take up a certain documented position and do a respectful debate about it.

  

Humbly,

  

Nagaraj
