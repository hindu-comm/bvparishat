"The same scholar, Koenraad Elst (mentioned below), read out his review of TBFS at two event last month." makes it appear that my quote from Koenraad Elst is to show that he is against TBFS and you are showing evidences for the support of Koenraad Elst to TBFS.

  

But in fact , my quote from Koenraad Elst is not intended to show that he is against TBFS.

  

It was connected only toa minor point: Nityanandji's words 'who calls himself Kalavai Venkat' were questioned by Vidwan Anjanji by saying 'What else should Kalavai Venkat call himself?. I wanted to say that ''who calls himself Kalavai Venkat' is not incorrect because 'Kalavai Venkat' is a pen name.

  

That quote from meis not in opposition to the remaing points made by Sri Anjanji , nor are they in support of all the points made by Sri Nityanandji.

  

It is limited to the expression used with regard to a name.

  

Isn'tthe approach ofgiving evidence for even for such a minor issue good ?
