I agree that Rajiv Malhotra's Sanskrit scholarship of is not pertinent to this debate. The fact that some of the tallest Sanskrit scholars like Dayananda Bhargava, K S Kannan, Sampadananda Mishra, K Ramasubramanian, etc have praised the book, knowing well that Sh. Malhotra is neither a traditional or modern scholar of Sanskrit, shows that the issues raised in the book go far beyond the scope of scholarship of Sanskrit. Mr Malhotra is not contesting the interpretation of a rule of Ashtadhyayi/a verse of Naishadhiyacaritam/an aphorism of Tarkasangraha which would require one to be proficient in Sanskrit.
