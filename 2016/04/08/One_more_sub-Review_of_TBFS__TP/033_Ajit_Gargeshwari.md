Dear Nityanandaji,  

I agree with you views partly but do you think this should be the only thread that needs to be discussed here. We have been discussing this thread in its various avatars from the past 2 -3 months. Don't you think all have said what they need to say. Its now left to your choice of wisdom If you want to continue endless this discussion or debate If we continue this will be like the dvaita Vs advaita debate which will go on for centuries with no conclusions.  

Rajiv has created an awareness, He has raised important issues, Insiders and outsiders have given their view Lets please give ourselves some break and continue once the all scholars have taken their final stance.  

  

Regards
