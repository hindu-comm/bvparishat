You vividly lionize (pun intended) a person as a "fearless lion".

You make a bold claim that this person has been threatened and physically attacked many times, which is a criminal offence in the United States (and in most other countries).  

When asked for details (when and where) or evidence (news coverage or police report), you say "take my word or ask the person."  

  

This only hurts your credibility. If you want to be taken seriously on a list for scholars, please do not make claims which you cannot back with facts.
