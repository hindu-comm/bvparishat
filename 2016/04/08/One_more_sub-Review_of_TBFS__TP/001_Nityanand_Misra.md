The title is misleading. This is not a sub-review of TBFS, but a review of the response of Rajeev Malhotra to the critical review of TBFS by Shatavadhani Ganesh.

  

Secondly, as I have request in the past, please raise the standard of discussions on this list by citing sources which are reliable and scholarly. A few days ago somebody cited Ajit Vadakayil's blog posts which I stated are hardly reliable (and which Dr. Sundaresan said are completely unreliable). Today we are citing an article which hasnon-scholarly childish statements like “Oh, really? Ganesh must have unleashed paranormal forces to manipulate Malhotra’s mind and made him write these sentences ….” An example of his lack of serious scholarship (as well as enviable trolling and abusive skills) of the author is [this masterpiece](http://hindureview.com/2006/02/08/madhav-deshpande-amnesiac/), where he cannot even fathom the extent of drastic changes which can happen in a single generation in a family and writes trash about our very respectable Prof. Madhav Deshpande Ji.

  

A book like TBFS by an influential author and reliable publisher is welcome for discussion. A critique of the book by an exemplary scholar like Shatavadhani Ganesh Ji is welcome. However, discussing the writings of abusive trolls like this author who calls himself Kalavai Venkat would be a waste of time for this esteemed list - best to leave such writings for social media.
