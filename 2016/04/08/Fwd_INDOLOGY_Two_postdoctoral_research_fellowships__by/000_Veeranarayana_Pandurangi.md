Subject: Advertisement and further particulars for two 2-year postdoctoral research fellowships in Indian Philosophy at Wolfson College Oxford, starting 2016  
  
  
Dear Friends,  
I am attaching an advertisement and further particulars for two 2-year postdoctoral research fellowships in Indian Philosophy at Wolfson College Oxford, applications and references due by 13 May to start in Wolfson this October, 2016. The required part of the research concerns the application of Indian Philosophy to certain socio-political issues listed here by the Berggruen Institute, some more and some less closely connected with Indian Philosophy, because the philosophies of other cultures are also being accommodated on other sites.  
 The reason why some postdoctoral experience is required is that these posts are more generously funded than Wolfson Junior Research fellowships, so as to guarantee substantial research in the area. Wolfson was envisaging typically between 3 and 10 years from the relevant PhD. But if equivalent experience can be claimed, candidates should not hesitate to make a special case. Provided the substantial research in this area is produced, postholders are free to publish on their other interests as well. Other schools of Indian Philosophy can be researched besides the ones I have listed as examples.

Do let me know if you know of good candidates.  
All good wishes  
Yours  
Richard
