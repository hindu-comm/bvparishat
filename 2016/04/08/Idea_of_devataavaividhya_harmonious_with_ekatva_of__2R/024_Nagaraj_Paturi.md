Dear Vidwan Shreyasji,

  

I agree and I am with you in asking scholars to avoid, as far as possible, discussions that bring in the differences of opinion between different schools of Vedanta.

  

An American Indologist asked me, "is such a discussion of Vedanta possible?" . I confidently answered him in the affirmative. This was in response to my proposal of what I called 'Nirvivaada Vedanta' or 'vaadabhEdaateeta Vedanta'. He exclaimedwith utter disbelief in and tone and facial expression, "Eh, is this a valid notion? Can anything like that ('Nirvivaada Vedanta' or 'vaadabhEdaateeta Vedanta') exist or thought of?"

  

I again answered in the affirmative with the same confidence.

  

It maysuit a full separate thread to discuss the details of my idea of 'Nirvivaada Vedanta' or 'vaadabhEdaateeta Vedanta'.

  

But such a view isthe need of the hour and should be incorporated in the discussions such as the one in the present thread.

  

Humbly,

  

Nagaraj
