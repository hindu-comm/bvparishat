I thought of starting this thread after a scholar respected by us is mentioned to have said that claims of monotheism of Hinduism are in imitation of Christianity. I am not in favour of applying categories such as 'polytheism' and 'monotheism' to 'Hinduism'. Using our own categories, Iwas wonderinghow the fact well known to most of us in India that the idea of devataavaividhya harmonious with ekatva of brahman is as old as at least the Upanishads got distorted like this and the imitation theory got currency among even the learned.
