Thanks pujya Kalicharanji for joining the discussion.

\> To the core deity d. This makes sense as d is anyway the deity of the context (say, a Hindu sect), and is therefore the "core deity" (the deity under focus/ इष्ट देवता of the sect) in the set {a, b, c, d, e, f, g}.

  

------ This suits

 (a) the panchaayatana model. There are Vishnu panchaayatana, Shiva panchaayatana etc. where one of the five is the

 'presiding' or 'central' deity.

  

 (b) paaramya sampradaayas: 'shaNmatas' : Saiva, Vaishnava, Sakteya (well known) and the less known Soura, GaaNaapatya

  and Soura.

  

\> In this way, each Hindu sect can operate as some form of monism/ monotheism, even while Hinduism, overall, remains polytheistic. So there is no contradiction.

  

--------- The English words 'monism/monotheism are problematic. But for want of a better alternative, we can compromise and say that this is one of the ways in which polytheism and monotheism, in stead of being mutually exclusive binary as in the western parlance, are mutually inclusive and mutually coherent in 'Hinduism'.

  

\> Now let us come to the context of वेदान्त where ब्रह्म is the इष्टदेवता.  
d = ब्रह्म  
D = पुरुष / ब्रह्मा

  

Sir, probably your 'd' seems to be the pauraaNic god brhma, the creator who is part of the trimurti set.

  

Your 'D' seems to be Brhman, the central concept of Vedanta. 

  

\> Here, पुरुष is more of a generic term which can be used for any D-deity (पुंदेवता only), e.g. for विष्णु, शिव, इत्यादि (again, depending on the d-deity of the context).  

  

  

-------- Sir, you are completely mistaken in thinking that पुरुष has reference to पुंदेवता only or male or masculine gender.

  

\(a\) पुरुष of the Vedas such as Virat purusha, samvatsara purusha etc. is a word similar to the English word 'person'. In fact, I would even say that it is used in the sense of 'organism'. It is used to describe 'organismic' coherent organization of various entities into a set, or organism-like (self-regulated and self-sustained ) functioning of a system, such as an eco-system.

  

\(b\) पुरुष of Saankhya is a concept meaning something like 'motive' or 'dynamising' aspect of reality in contrast to 'prakriti'the motivated or the dynamised aspect of reality.

  

\(c\) पुरुष of Vedanta is also a super-gender (beyond gender distinctions ) concept, not any deity . Gita has a detailed, intricate discussion of various aspects of this concept. 

  

\> ब्रह्मा is rarely used in Vedantic contexts, but that is purely due to historical reasons (duly enunciated in Purana-s).  

  

-- You are probably talking about your small /lower case 'd' here.

  

\>This maths of d & D is exactly what Br.Up is seen performing. But all that is when we holistically understand the वाक्यानि, taking into account the contexts they are found in.  

  

  

------- I agree.
