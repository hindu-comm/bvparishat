नमस्ते ।  
  
Suppose we are talking about a set of deities {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} in certain context (of which the presiding deity is, say, d).  
  
How do we reduce the multiplicity of deities to a singularity? In two ways:  
  
1. To the core deity d. This makes sense as d is anyway the deity of the context (say, a Hindu sect), and is therefore the "core deity" (the deity under focus/ इष्ट देवता of the sect) in the set {a, b, c, d, e, f, g}.  
2. To the विराट देवता D = d \| a+b+c+e+f+g, which is a "summation" performed on deities , while still retaining deity d at the core of the sum.  
  
An example:  
d = पार्वती  
D = दुर्गा  
  
In this way, each Hindu sect can operate as some form of monism/ monotheism, even while Hinduism, overall, remains polytheistic. So there is no contradiction.  
  
Now let us come to the context of वेदान्त where ब्रह्म is the इष्टदेवता.  
d = ब्रह्म  
D = पुरुष / ब्रह्मा  
  
Here, पुरुष is more of a generic term which can be used for any D-deity (पुंदेवता only), e.g. for विष्णु, शिव, इत्यादि (again, depending on the d-deity of the context).  
  
ब्रह्मा is rarely used in Vedantic contexts, but that is purely due to historical reasons (duly enunciated in Purana-s).  
  
This maths of d & D is exactly what Br.Up is seen performing. But all that is when we holistically understand the वाक्यानि, taking into account the contexts they are found in.  
  
I have said this earlier: Upanishads' वाक्यानि have been systematically quoted out of context. By whom? People who saw/ see शास्त्र as a gravy train.
