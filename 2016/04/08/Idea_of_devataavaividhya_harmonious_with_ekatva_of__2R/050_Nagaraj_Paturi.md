Pujya Prof. Raniji said: Most of the things which I mentioned here are not uncovered by the previous writers of this thread. Yet I chose these aspects to supplement the necessity of protecting and propagating our tradition.

  

The double negative 'not uncovered' , I assume, means : Most of the things which I mentioned here are covered by the previous writers of this thread.

  

For example, combining Prof. Raniji's two statements :

  

(1) As far as this Devataavaividhya is concerned Our seers seems to have preferably recommended us to worship GODS and not any Single GOD only.

  

\(2\) "But there were some ideal preceptors who attained fulfillment even by worshiping any single God or Goddess. So they preached to worship any single GOD......... It doesn't suggest us to worship only a single god and to shun all the other gods." ,

  

we probably get the idea contained in

  

But for want of a better alternative, we can compromise and say that this is one of the ways in which polytheism and monotheism, in stead of being mutually exclusive binary as in the western parlance, are mutually inclusive and mutually coherent in 'Hinduism'.

  

The early posts of this thread were focussed on *one of* the chief *early* sources of what is being called as 'Hinduism' namely, the Vedas and the Upanishads. That is why the focus was on the concepts such as Brahman and the Vedic gods.

  

The later textual sources such as the Puranas too continued the mutual inclusivity of Devataavaividhya and the Parama daivata such as Shiva, Vishnu or S'akti. This is inherent in the Vedaartha upabrimhaNa nature of the Puranas.
