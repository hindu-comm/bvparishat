That is the only way Sir. We already have so many interpretations from people of various eastern and western origines, all feel correct from their point of view.

  

To be practical, we can take up significant key words, meditate upon them individually, do cross referencing, discussions and write a n article explaining that fully. Then take up next one..... and at the end we will have a compedium of key words in our tradition fully explained and defined, compilation will be a good reference from within our own tradition and that we should use as a standard reference.

  

Works are already available on this line from some western Sanskritists loke J gonda and V S Agrawala from India, just to cite example,

Regards

Sati Shankar
