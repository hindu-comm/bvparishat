नमस्ते ।

  

भाष्यानि उपनिषदेषु, after all, are secondary sources - no matter who wrote them. Indispensable for स्वाध्याय, no doubt, but far from unequivocally authoritative in scholarly citations.

  

This doesn't mean neglecting/ overturning historical scholarship on Vedanta. Let me demonstrate this using the terminology I've already used in this thread.

  

D = d \| a+b+c+e+f+g  is the पुरुष देवता understood as the "oriented sum" of deities a-g. I call this "oriented sum" because the deity d has a special place in this sum - one that of being a "guide" or the "giver of direction".

  

D is greater than merely the sum of its parts (as the saying goes), and one needn't emphasise how "D exemplifies एकत्व and is far from being hodgy-podgy".

  

But the more interesting question is the nature of the "oriented sum", especially the meaning of the"orientation" part. Because in the sum D, the d-deityenters with a slightly different operation (symbolised by " \| " here) compared to " + " in case of other deities.

  

अद्वैत says, there is no difference between \| and + and therefore thereis no special deity such as 'd'. All that we have is 'D'.

द्वैत says \| is like a पूर्ण विराम and therefore the separation between d and (a+b+c+e+f+g) is complete. All we have is 'd', and the "others".

विशिष्ट अद्वैत says \| is neither + nor पूर्ण विराम exclusively.

  

We can transcend this question, especially for contexts such as the present one, by plainly referring to "oriented sum". (I hope scholars will pinpoint the exact Sanskrit word used for it)

The next important question is how D-देवता comes to be also identified with प्राण. This is what we saw in Nagaraj-ji's original quote from Br. Up. and also in Shri V. Subrahmanyam's quote from प्रश्नोपनिषद २.९.

  

Why is प्राण देवता so important to Upanishads?
