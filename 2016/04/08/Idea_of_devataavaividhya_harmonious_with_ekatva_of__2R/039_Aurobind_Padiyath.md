Hypothetically if Christ and Mohamed were to be born in India or were allowed to be included in the "Vasudaiva kudumbhakam" , won't they also be like Karthikeya and Buddha? Just that they were in other countries we have problem in including them. Are we not allowing Sai followers and others to function? Only when these followers try to impose and tramp on the existing systems and undertake forceful conversations, people react.

Are we not taught to accept noble thoughts from all over the world to be accepted? If not can we ever would have seen any footprints of Zorashtrians etc in this country?

While we accept noble thoughts It's our right to protect what's rightfully our's.
