Prof Nagaraj,

You got the point. The message has to reach our youth. Whatever we think is educational,

should be enumerated as readable articles. It is the latter where we have to alert ourselves

for the future. While I realize it is not straightforward, but I believe it is a part of the national

service specially when massive cultural invasion has been underway.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
