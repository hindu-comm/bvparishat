Dear Prof. Misra,

  

The initiating post of the thread is self-explanatory. It makes it clear that the thread is indended to do purvapaksha of a position:

  

'Hinduism was polytheistic before the arrival of the British and the colonial time Christian evangelism. Hindus started claiming their religion to be monotheistic only in imitation of Christian monotheism.'

  

For anySaskrit-knowing Hindu, that this position is wrong is well known. So to write a paper on this , as if this is a path-breaking new idea, is not required.

  

We engage in such manana of our own known ideas just for the purpose of a svaadhyaaya with a purpose, reminiscing our past knowledge on a specific issue reminding ourselves that our understanding contrary to the above position is well founded.

  

The problem with these positions is that they are getting into the textbooks of young children and are turning into the 'common sense' of educated Indians.

  

One of the purposes of the thread is to remind the concerned list members that they use their respective platforms to counter such misinformation.
