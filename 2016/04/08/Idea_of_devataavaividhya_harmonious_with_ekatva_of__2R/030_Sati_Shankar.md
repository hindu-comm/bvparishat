In our Sanatan tradition, we consider "*devatA*", "*devi*", or whatever we perceive the form and name it, *nAma - rUpa*, is realised in our tradition as *vishvam ekam, (*RV. 3.54.8), the many are the One and the One that is manifold, *vishvam satyam*, (RV. 2.24.12); the manifold truth,and *vishvam .....garbham (RV. 10.121.7).* therefore, if asked, "Is He One or many?", our tradition says,"One and many", The general principle is ,the *devah* is every where of one and the same form. (RV.8.11.8)., that is, "Even as he seems, so is he named" RV. 5.44.6., the way being *anurUpah, pratirUpah, (*JBU.I.27). Here, He, Prajapati, *manifests in "Himself*", so this universe, *idam sarvam,* pecieved according *to anurUpam, pratirUpam,*to be declared " One and many", there by clarifying that the translation of the *NasadIya Sukta,* the Manifestation Hymn*,* as the "Creation Hymn", signifies the error interpretation and naming by the Indologists had in their minds the "Creationist presuppositions" of Christianity. Therefore, using the "God" for the "Self Manifested", *idam sarvam,* is like limiting Him and equally makes "theology" a term unfit to proceed for *brahma jijnAsA* of our tradition*.PrajApti*, thus manifested in Himself*, idam sarvam,*selforganizes in *dharma* by *his own* multifarious *sva-bhAva,* such that in Him are all beings*, idam sarvam, manas, prAnah, nAma-rUpa,* are within, as coincident; " sent by Him *onto him*, and born of Him *into him*, it is in Him that all this universe is stabilised, that is how our tradition invokes for *shAnti*, ... *sarve devAh shAntih, nakshatrh shAntih, vanaspatayah shantih.....aum shAntih, shAntih, shAntih...* to keep the equilibrium in *idam sarvam* intact, for welfare of the cosmos. Our scriptures teach,*"idam sarvam brahm*" and therefore, being a manifestation within, *Aham brahmAsmi* since we ,*aikik* and *samyaka* are this *"idam sarvam",* well connected in such a way that a chance deviation at any level, be it microcosm or macrocosm, does not leave unaffected within. These are just examples within the limits of this forum.
