Historically Sanskrit was not the only language in which spirituality was discussed for popular reading and understanding of philosophy. Philosophy was extensively discussed in regional languages. When philosophy can be discussed in regional languages why not English. The problem is we loosely use western Philosophical terms whose usage for Indian systems of philosophy, many concepts are similar but not identical. Why do we need to compel any one? Westerner easterner or even an Indian. If you say I am wise listen to me forget westerners even Indian wont listen. Don't we many sub schools in Indian philosophy?  

  

1) Does the concept of religion apply in the Indian context where ancient Indians believed more in 'mata' or opinion and 'path' or different approaches to God. 2) Should Hinduism not be equated with Sanatana Dharma.   
  

I don't know mata but each school of philosophy was and is called a darshana. The word Sanatana Dharma is not found in Vedas or any old philosophical texts. Its a recent word and should be ignored. The problem starts if we start writing like chauvinists.   
  

In my opinion both द्वैत and अद्वैत are the गुणाः of ईश्वरः Like so much else seems contradictory when we try to understand it through human logic, the simultaneous existence of द्वैत and अद्वैत seems contradictory when we try to understand it logically. 

  
I don't understand the above sentence.

  

The problem arises when Zakir Naik quotes from Hindi scriptures to prove that some of the attributes of God in Hindu scriptures are those of Allah, and, therefore, Allah is there in Hindu scriptures. As a Hindu I am ready to accept this. But would Zakir Naik accept if I sit in a mosque and worship a Hindu God because that is afterall a representation of Allah?

  

Let me ask the same question if some one sits in temple and loudly read Koran will it be fine. (Personally for me it does not matter). If one says there is God and theology in Hindu texts whats wrong one may call God allah or Ram.  

  

श्रोत्रादीनीन्द्रियाण्यन्ये संयमाग्निषु जुह्वति  
शब्दादीन्विषयानन्य इन्द्रियाग्निषु जुह्वति  
  
I take the second line to mean that even deep indulgence of the senses is a kind of yajna. Interpreters of the shlokah with a rigid 'Hindu' mind try to fit this into 'family dharma' and all that. But where is the need for such forced fitting? Why can't we simply accept and say, "Yes, complete application of the senses, when for instance listening to a raga or watching a dance, is also a kind yajna"?

  

This might be popular interpretation or your own interpretation of the sholka. This interpretation is neither shastric or traditional or has logical backing.

  
  
There is no doubt that we have moved into an age where different religions are not only in competition with one another, but also tend to take a rigid and exclusive position.  
  

This is because many Indian saints saints and good meaning God men and women have made yoga and other Indian concepts a commodity and are earning millions of dollars which is against our Dharma Shastras for Dharma is never for sale. If my followers are making more money than your followers then the problem starts.  

  

We need to focus on new interpretive tools rather than rigidify our views about the scriptures. For, if we try to look at the scriptures every time with a new perspective we might find meanings that we had never thought of.   
  

There are enough tools and there always scope for more I agree
