On School books:

Sir

We must be realistic. In our own country school books with anti national, contents such as India bombarded Nagaland and acquired it, so is Kashmir etc.... were cited by Education Minister in the Parliament. We must realize that it is part of education policy of the Govt and depends on hoe vigilent the Govt is. What is anti-national content here is well received in pakistan. For the same content authour here is wrong but right there in pakistan. so who selects the content and what and where is vital.

What they teach in California is their matter, in a sense if a student writes in exam there based on our tradition, may fail, he has to read and write what is correct from their point of view, irrespective of what facts are.
