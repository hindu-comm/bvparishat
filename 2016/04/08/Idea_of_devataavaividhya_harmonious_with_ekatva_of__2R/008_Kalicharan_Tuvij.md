Highest Pranama-s,

Prof. Nagaraj ji.

  

पुरुष the word is not the key issue here. I admit that पुरुष, much like 'Man', can also mean thegender-neutral "(human)being". So it would be an overkill assigning exclusively either "male" or "being" to पुरुष.

  

My point was that पुरुष is a generic term for D-देवता, i.e. the विराट (so Samkhya interpretation isn't considered here). In the same Br.Up, he is also called पिता.

  

Re: ब्रह्म, ब्रह्मन्, ब्रह्मा

  

I did mean ब्रह्मा as the D-देवता/ पुरुष, as described with detail in Purana-s (one of the Trinity). In the first para itself of the wiki page on ब्रह्मा says— "In the epics, he is conflated with Purusha."

  

By ब्रह्म, I did mean the d-देवता, ब्रह्मन्. However, as we know ब्रह्म is many times used to mean ब्रह्मा, ब्राह्मण, prayer, etc as well. I will henceforth use ब्रह्मन् for ब्रह्म, to avoid confusion.

  

व्याकरण dictates that it is ब्रह्मा who carries ब्रह्मन् within, and not the other way around. It is D-देवता that has d-देवता within himself.

  

So the एकत्व-context can mean either 'd' or 'D', and Upanishads are full of both descriptions. Cha.Up. ६.२.२ for example talks about 'd'.

  

Creation can start in mainly two ways:

A. An undifferentiated D-देवता starts naming/ formulating his parts.

B. A d-देवता, by the summation process (discussed earlier), expands itself. There are intermediate stage deities involved in thisprocess.

  

नेति नेति is the "process of subtraction" to arrive at d-देवता starting from D-देवता or the multiplicity {a, b, c, d, e, f, g}.

  

An inability to read differentiation between D-देवता and d-देवता in Upanishads has resulted in conflating of ब्रह्मन् (d-देवता) with पुरुष (D-देवता). A tragedy indeed.

  

Re Hinduism

Yes I agree that Monism/ Monotheism in Hinduism is merely complementary to Polytheism in Hinduism. So much so that applying such filters on Hinduism is not productive at all. Unfortunately, however, these facts are not projected at all in media.
