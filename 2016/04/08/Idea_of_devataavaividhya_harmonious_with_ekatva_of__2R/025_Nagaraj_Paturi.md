\> Well, for scholars learned in the Śāstras, the Vedic and Vedāntic positions may be very clear.

  

---- I agree. Considering that BVP has many 'scholars learned in the Śāstras, the Vedic and Vedāntic positions ', expecting them to say, 'all this is obvious to us, why to discuss the well known again?' , I have been saying 'it is well known' etc.

  

List members know thatProf. Iyengar amongthese learned members of BVP, as such they take his words such as, 'But for an average Hindu, like the undersigned, with bits and pieces of knowledge picked up from inherited tradition and listening and reading here and there' as expressions of humility whichthey naturally take as the hallmark of again his greatness as a scholar only.

  

\> Referring to Hinduism as a religion vis a vis Xtianity and Islam itself is not proper.

  

Absolutely. That is the reason, why, as I do in all my posts except when I am unalert, kept the word 'Hinduism'in quotes.

  

It may be noted that I did the same in the thread initiating post, here, too.

  

My words there: "I am not in favour of applying categories such as 'polytheism' and 'monotheism' to 'Hinduism'. "

  

\> My humble submission is Hinduism is a Meta-religion (it can subsume Abrahamic vyavahāra in its outreach) and it is Uni-theistic, which is neither polytheism nor monotheism.

  

Leaving aside other portions of this sentence (for a separate discussion ) , the claim ".... Hinduism is....... neither polytheism nor monotheism." iswell in agreement with the thread initiating post where it is said,

  

"**I am not in favour of applying categories such as 'polytheism' and 'monotheism' to 'Hinduism'**. *Using our own categories*, Iwas wonderinghow the fact well known to most of us in India that the idea of devataavaividhya harmonious with ekatva of brahman is as old as at least the Upanishads got distorted like this and the imitation theory got currency among even the learned."

  

'Imitation theory' here means the theory that 'claims of monotheism of Hinduism are in imitation of Christianity'.

  

Thus on the whole Prof. Iyengar doesn't seem to disagree with any of the words in the first post of the thread. Nor does that post has anything in contradiction with the present post of Prof. Iyengar.

  

Thanks to Prof. Iyengar for providing a detailed explanation for why 'I am not in favor of applying categories such as 'polytheism' and 'monotheism' to 'Hinduism''.

  

Warm regards,

  

Nagaraj
