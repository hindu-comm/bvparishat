We are accustomed to use words by common sense, we use them without specifically knowing what they denote, in every day life it works since transmitters and receivers both operate at the same platform of commonsense, but becomes critical when we proceed to textual and scriptural interpretations. This is source of most of the controversies and disagreements.

Recently I had pointed out in another thread how misfit it is to use the word "Theology" in our context, and even in this thread we are continuing to discuss mono-"theism", , poly-"theism" and going on superimposing over "idam-sarvam". We are overloaded with such mis-marriages and superimposition of concepts.

It is this crisis I have been advocating that we need our own dictionaries of technical terms, defining terms based on our own systems and traditions but most often found a discouraging or blunt replies even from some of my professor friends who make their living out of the same subject. Unless we will be very clear of our own terminologies we can not hope to refute some body using his or her own mistaken notions. I see grave problem at this front without any satisfactory resolution in immediate future.

  

It is surprising to see a discussion whether we should teach our children what and what not the Hinduism is. We will be fooling them if we do so. as we yourselves are not, at the moment, sure of what it is. But tradition moves forward through our culture and customs and not by memorizing dictionary words and that is why our tradition has survives jolts exerted upon it for thousands of years.

  

Things need to be meditated upon and settle down to some interpretations based on our own tradition, to a satisfactory level for now, future generations will be adopt or adapt as per their own circumstances. It is our responsibility if we can realise.
