Ajitji,

This is a strange observation. There is something called India and something called Indian tradition. It is necessary that the

intellects in India refresh what India has been and where her core beliefs lie. A human being is a spiritual entity, the life is

lived through beliefs. Our society, interaction, respect, friendship, habitat and basic living are influenced by our belief. Belief

is a part of human psychology which is inescapable through its cosmological design. The inquiry, enunciation and articulation

of belief is important, actually more the better. As I see from a distance,m India's uniqueness in the world is through her

belief system and the speculative inquiry. Prof Korada reintroduced the word "sanAtana" ., There should be a more thorough

analysis and discussion of this concept. The other word is anAdi. They both may not be complementary. I would like

the scholars to probe into the concepts and bring clarity. He also said "sagunA" and "nirguNa" which could be linked to the

other concepts. I agree the efforts to nail a "theology" on Indian speculations have be rejected.

Best regards,

BM
