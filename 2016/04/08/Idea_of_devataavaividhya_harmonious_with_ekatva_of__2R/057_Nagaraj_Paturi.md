For the substantiation of my point of current relevance of the issue and the point that school books were involved , as proof, references were given to posts on another list.

  

I copied my own posts from other lists here, when I was asked to do so, as you remember.

  

The recent link to Sanskrit word frequency post was also from the same list.

  

Thanks for suggesting me to provide reason.
