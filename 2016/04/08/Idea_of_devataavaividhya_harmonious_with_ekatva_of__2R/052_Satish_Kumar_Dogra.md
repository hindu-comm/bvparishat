Mr. Sati Shankar,  

 What you say is correct. There is need for well-informed discussions in order to define the contours of meanings. Otherwise, we might be talking of different things while using the same terms. Words are afterall combinations of vowels and consonants. What makes them meaningful is the vague mass of thoughts they produce in our mind when we read or hear them. Unless the vague mass they produce in the minds of different people is roughly the same, there is bound to be misunderstandings. Therefore, as you rightly say, scholars must undertake an exercise to define what is what. Initially, perhaps, this can be in the form of articles, which can then be converted into dictionaries and encyclopedias as archives and reference materials.  
  

Regards,  

Dogra
