Dear SriSubrahmanian,

  

Given the fundamentally divergent metaphysical frameworks of each Vedanta tradition wrt the other, I think we need to separately analyze 

and map out what "monotheism" means (and assumes!) for each individual philosophy - i. Advaita, ii. Visishtadvaita iii. Dvaita iv. bheda-abheda etc.

  

It might be confusing to discuss on a single thread.

  

Namaste,

-Shreyas
