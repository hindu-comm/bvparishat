Yes it did deviate . I tried to give my understanding or reply to Satish Kumar Dogra jis mail.  
  

There is no one single acceptable view which can be said as Hindu view. Many views have been propounded by many people from various parts of India from various times under varied circumstances have given a set of opinions on varied topics. All these views can be considered as Hinduism. Hinduism has polytheism, monotheism, theism, atheism etc. The problem starts when we use the word Hinduism and say it is for a particular view and other views are not there. A Hindu has no quarrel with any religion. If I communicate one view and say this Hinduism another parson will give another view and say that too is Hinduism. Both my view and another person view can be traced in Hindu texts. Each view has to be examined within the context traditions in which a view has been said. Views bereft of context will simply give raise to debates not having any bearing on the views. There can be no single communication to any audience say this Hinduism and this is not Hinduism. Was there or is there one common unitary principle that is or was universally accepted at any one given point of time by all people spread across a vast and culturally varied land such as India is difficult or impossible to answer.
