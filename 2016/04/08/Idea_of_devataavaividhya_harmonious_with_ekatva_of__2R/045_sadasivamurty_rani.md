I fully agree with Sri Ajit Ji as far as his statements "We need not teach our children this is Hinduism this is not Hinduism. They can read explore and find out. We can teach them our family traditions at a personal level." are concerned.

  

Here I would like to add a few reasons for supporting his views.

1\. The words Hindu and Hinduism are popularized and given more focus as a result of social and historical necessity in the recent centuries. Moreover these two words are very late originated too.

  

2\. Christianity and Islam are surely two religions in modern terms.
Where as we do not have any religion by name. These two and many of such other religions have - One God, One Text and One Pravakta or Preacher system.



But We don't have any religion but a perennial stream of Dharma - the way of living of Bharatiyas - I don't even prefer the word - Indians - to call ourselves. So we have multitude of Gods, Plethora of Texts and a galaxy of Teachers.

Thus this Sanatana Dharama or Bharatiya Dharma with an ever uninterrupted TRADITION gifted us PRICELESS LEGACY and GLORY of spiritualistic elevation of individual with full freedom of worshiping many Gods or Single God.

  

3. Meanwhile, some of the prominent leaders of 19th and 20th centuries who inspired our entire nation during the British rule and led our country in the freedom struggle felt the need of a label to unite all of us and adapted these words HINDU and HINDUISM of persian origin. As a token of our respect to them we are accustomed to accept these terms. 

  

  

So as said by AJITJI let us teach our younger generations our family traditions - ***I add a phrase 'without any amendments '***- at a personal level.यद्यदाचरति श्रेष्ठ: तत्तदेवेतरो जन:*.\_* As the elders do so the younger generations. If we have commitment in teaching them surely a majority of our younger generations will respect our tradition and systems. Sometimes we need not even teach them if we regularly and systematically practise they too will follow.

  

**II. Idea of Devataavaividhya**

As far as this Devataavaividhya is concerned Our seers seems to have preferably recommended us to worship GODS and not any Single GOD only. Let us see the following statementsfrom Vedic Texts, Smritis, Puranas etc :

  

  

जायमानो वै त्रिभिर् ऋणवान् जायते (तै. सं) and

  

अथोच्यते गृहस्थस्य नित्यकर्म यथाविधि।

यत्कृत्वाऽनृण्यमाप्नोति दैवात् पैत्राच्च मानुषात् ॥ आश्वलायन गृह्यसूत्रम्)

  

These two statements say that any human being in this world is born with three debts : *1. To Gods, 2. To Sages and 3. To Human beings (fore fathers).*

To set ourselves free from these three debts we have to perform Nitya Karma Anusthana. The next question that confronts us is: What are the main deeds of Nitya Karma Anusthana? The following slokas from Brhat Parasaraa Smriti and Parasara Smriti answer this question.

  

सन्ध्यास्नानं जपश्चैव **देवतानां च पूजनम्।**

वैश्वदेवं तथाऽऽतिथ्यं षट् कर्माणि दिने दिने॥ (बृहत् पराशरस्मृति:)

  

सन्ध्यास्नानं जपो होमो **देवतानां च****पूजनम्।**

आतिथ्यं वैश्वदेवं च षट्कर्माणि दिने दिने ॥ (पराशरस्मृति:)

  

Here Devataanaam ca Puujanam is in plural form suggesting the Polytheistic worship. Further to say:

ब्रह्मादयो ये देवा: ताऩ् देवांस्तर्पयामि।

सर्वान् देवांस्तर्पयामि।

सर्वाऩ् देवगणांस्तर्पयामि।

सर्वा: देवपत्नीस्तर्पयामि।

सर्वान् देवपुत्रांस्तर्पयामि।

सर्वान् देवपौत्रांस्तर्पयामि।

भूर्देवांस्तर्पयामि।

भुवर्देवांस्तर्पयामि।

सुवर्देवांस्तर्पयामि।

भूर्भुवस्सुवर्दॆवांस्तर्पयामि।

All this is an illustration of polytheism only.

  

Vyasa in the sloka:

वेदोदितं स्वकं कर्म नित्यं कुर्यादन्तन्द्रित:।

तद्धि कुर्वन् यथा शक्ति प्राप्नोति परमां गतिम् ॥ (व्यासवचनम्)

emphasizes that one who following the Vedic injunctions as specified above performs all his daily rituals etc will attain salvation at the end.

  

Following the same concept, we have the Panchayatana system of worship with the placement positions of the Gods according to the preference of the worshiper.

  

पञ्चायतनविधि:

शिवपञ्चायतनस्थानानि : मध्ये - शिव:, ईशान्ये-विष्णु:, आग्नॆये-सूर्य:,निऋत्यां-गणेश:,वायव्ये - अम्बिका

विष्णुपञ्चायतनस्थानानि : मध्ये -विष्णु:, ईशान्ये-शिव:, आग्नॆये-गणॆश:,निऋत्यां- रवि:, वायव्ये-अम्बिका

अम्बिकापञ्चायतनस्थानानि : मध्ये- अम्बिका,ईशान्ये-विष्णु:, आग्नॆये-शिव:, निऋत्यां-गणेश:, वायव्ये - सूर्य:

गणेशपञ्चायतनस्थानानि : मध्ये - गणेश:, ईशान्ये-विष्णु:,आग्नॆये -शिव:,निऋत्यां- सूर्य:,वायव्ये-अम्बिका

सूर्यपञ्चायतनस्थानानि : मध्ये - सूर्य:, ईशान्ये-विष्णु:, आग्नॆये-गणेश:निऋत्यां- शिव:, वायव्ये-अम्बिका

  

Even the Puranas recommend us never to discriminate between any Gods or Goddesses.

शिवाय विष्णुरूपाय शिवरूपाय विष्णवे।

शिवस्य हृदयं विष्णु: विष्णोश्च हृदयं शिव:॥

यथा शिवमयो विष्णुरेवं विष्णुमयश्शिव:।

यथान्तरं न पश्यामि तथा मे स्वस्तिरायुषि॥

  

and the Slokas like:

यं शैवा: समुपासते शिव इति ब्रह्मेति वेदान्तिनो

बौद्धा बुद्ध इति प्रमाणपटव: कर्तेति नैयायिका:।

अर्हन्नित्यथ जैनशासनरता: कर्मेति मीमांसका:

सोऽयं नो विधधातु वांछितफलं त्रैलोक्यनाथो हरि:॥

  

But there were some ideal preceptors who attained fulfillment even by worshiping any single God or Goddess. So they preached to worship any single GOD. This we had Vaishavities, Shaivites, Shaki worshipers and so on. It doesn't suggest us to worship only a single god and to shun all the other gods. This is to develop our faith in our family tradition.

  

Most of the things which I mentioned here are not uncovered by the previous writers of this thread. Yet I chose these aspects to supplement the necessity of protecting and propagating our tradition.

Warm regards,

**Prof. Rani Sadasiva Murty**

We need not teach our children this is Hinduism this is not Hinduism. They can read explore and find out. We can teach them our family traditions at a personal level. If they are interested they continue else they do not. We are living in times where lively hood is not dependent on religion. Only time can decide is this is best method or not. “superior in power, be it intellectual power, or physical might and wealth. It is due to this fact, for centuries deliberate interpretations have been made by power brokers to satisfy their vested-interests.” This is not created by west alone historically we are also responsible. Our Kings and past policy makers should also share and take blame to large extent. Many are fed up with this have preferred to keep religion at a personal level and talk only about philosophy Art ,Music language and other aspects on Indian culture.. The more such concepts Santana Dharma in the connotations its used are discussed more disgusting it becomes

"The situation is analogous to the Indic position on religious salvation—that a human being has access to it not by virtue of belonging to this or that religion—but by the mere fact of being a human being."

The fact of matter is that the duality inherent in our own reasoning makes it more convincing to believe in all those things which are consequences of duality. And the process goes on, leading to very many interpretation and consequent uses and abuses by those superior in power, be it intellectual power, or physical might and wealth. It is due to this fact, for centuries deliberate interpretations have been made by power brokers to satisfy their vested-interests.



Like Mr. Tully, Kerry Brown observes, “… the culture that we know now as Hinduisms and that the Indian ones call SanAtana Dharma - the Law Eternal - precedes this name by thousands of years. This is more than a religion, more than the theological direction in which the west understands religion. One can believe in all divinities or in no divinity and remain Hindu. This is a manner to living."

It is due to this prevalent undercurrent, Mr. Mark Tully observes that Indian secularism does respect all religions and rejoices in the diversity of faiths we Indians follow but, “the Western world and the Indian elite who imitate it ignore the genius of the Indian mind. They want to write a full stop in the land where there are no full stops.” This is why he writes, “for thousands of years, in changing historical circumstances, in different countries, and cultures and climates,people had experienced what appears to be the same reality, although describing that reality differently, I saw that a universal God made far more sense rationally than one who limited his activities to Christians.”
