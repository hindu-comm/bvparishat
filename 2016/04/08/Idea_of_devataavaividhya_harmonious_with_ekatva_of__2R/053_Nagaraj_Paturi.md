During the original debate, the three main issues to whichdissenting parents raised objections were : (a) Hinduism is polytheistic (b) Caste system and caste discrimination is part of Hinduism (c) Status of women in ancient India was inferior.

  

These are textbooks written in English, meant to be read by sixth grade children of US. The terminology to be used here can not be other than English. Any other solution would need elaborate explanations.

  

There were similar debates on CBSE books here. Language /communication difficulties can be lesser on account of the readers being Indian. But nevertheless the medium being English, children being very young poses similar communication problems.

  

Suggestion of Prof. Sati Shankar is helpful in improving the knowledge of the authors. But ultimately when the idea is to be communicated to children as young as the sixth graders in English medium, the issue turns out to be highly tricky.
