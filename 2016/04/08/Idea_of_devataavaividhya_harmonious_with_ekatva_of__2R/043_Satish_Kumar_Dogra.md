Shri Nagaraj Paturi, Shri Aurobind and Shri Ajit,  
  

Is the thread going off-track? I believe not. The basic issue to my mind is that Hinduism is under attack and the nature of attack and the methods of warding it off need to be identified by those who are in the fore-front of think-tanks.  
  

As Mr. Ajit says, a Hindu could be an atheist, a theist or an agnostic. As Mr. Aurobind says, but for the rigidity that has crept into religions during the past few decades, Christ and Mohammed could well be having their idols side-by-side with Krishna and Rama in our temples. This is the beauty of Hinduism, because a Hindu is a seeker and spiritual explorer who starts out with the view that the scriptures and the Gurus are only guides. It is he himself who must seek his path and find the Truth for himself.  
  

Therefore, when Hinduism is attacked, it is this spirit of free thinking and free exploration which comes under attack. The all-accommodating philosophy that treats theism and atheism, Buddha and Krishna with equal value is sought to be replaced by a belief-system that prescribes and says, "You shall do this and only this." It is this prescriptive and proscriptive approach which makes an attack on Hinduism dangerous for humanity.  
  

Centuries ago, Hinduism came under attack and the leaders-of-thought at that time failed to identify the symptoms of the attack and to take steps to ward it off. That is how a centuries-long tradition was broken, and now we are trying to bring about its resurgence. Should that mistake be repeated?
