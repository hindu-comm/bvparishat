Dr Gargeshwariji,

  

For a moment, let us assume that Hinduism can be anything for anyone is true. 

  

Even in that case, is it not wrong to tell the young children that Hinduism had polytheism only before the British and it is only after theChristians told them about Christianity being monotheistic that the Hindus started claiming their religion to be monotheistic?

  

For a moment, let us go with your view that 'We need not teach our children this is Hinduism this is not Hinduism. They can read explore and find out.'

  

You or medid not write that Hinduism is polytheistic only. Someoneelse wrote that. Someone is else is teaching our children that 'this is Hinduism this is not Hinduism'. Then what would you do?

  

If you believe that 'Hinduism has polytheism, monotheism, theism, atheism etc.',would you not tell those who are teaching our children that Hinduism is only this,

  

Either

  

(a)" Please don't teach my children anything about Hinduism. I would like to 'teach them our family traditions at a personal level. If they are interested they continue else they do not.' " ?

  

or

  

\(b\) "Please don't teach my children that Hinduism has polytheism only. In fact 'Hinduism has polytheism, monotheism, theism, atheism etc.'. Please teach these facts about Hinduism to them." ?
