Well, for scholars learned in the Śāstras, the Vedic and Vedāntic positions may be very clear. But for an average Hindu, like the undersigned, with bits and pieces of knowledge picked up from inherited tradition and listening and reading here and there, the situation is not that easy. Referring to Hinduism as a religion vis a vis Xtianity and Islam itself is not proper. However if we agree that we are all Hindu insiders for this discussion, monotheism has to be first defined or at least explained. Quoting from ancient texts does not address the Position at all. Let me explain my difficulties. As is well known and repeated by many, Abrahamic religions have only Single Prophet and One Book. Coming to the concept of One God, as far as I have understood, Xtianity (corrections welcome) the Oneness is contrasted with anti-God or Satan, who is not to be worshiped. It appears to me by definition monotheism in the Position is a Male Godhead isolated from His Creation but existing with a Polar opposite, making space for Sin and Evil. AFAIK Xtianity accepts God to be (3 O) Omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient. But I am not sure about the “*sarvāntaryāmitva”* of the Xian God among the living (*chit*) and also the non-living (*achit*). If this were to be accepted, His Creation cannot be separated from Him and monotheism collapses. Still one can bring in Prakṛti, but this is not at all same as anti-God. Brahman-Māyā; Savitṛ-Sāvitrī; Śiva-Śakti; Viṣṇu-Śri; are not antagonistic to each other and the Hindu does not despise the Female-God. In fact Hindus can as well worship Her instead of Him. So, worshiping Bhāratamātā is as good as worshiping Bhūdevi which will give the same result; but it is not so for the Abrahamics mainly due to monotheism defined in the Books. Hence, to me it seems Hinduism (as a religion) at the Vyāvaharika level gets automatically differentiated from Xtianity and Islam. But how to reconcile with what Yāska has pointed out and all our great saints; men and women; have realized? My humble submission is Hinduism is a Meta-religion (it can subsume Abrahamic vyavahāra in its outreach) and it is Uni-theistic, which is neither polytheism nor monotheism.
