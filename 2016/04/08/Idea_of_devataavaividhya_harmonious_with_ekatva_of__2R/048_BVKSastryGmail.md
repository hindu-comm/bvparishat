Namaste Aurobind Padiyath



On \< Hypothetically if Christ and Mohamed were to be born in India or were allowed to be included in the "Vasudaiva kudumbhakam" , won't they also be like Karthikeya and Buddha? \>



A. The Hypothetical answer is \< Both would have taught in their recorded teachings and history two important things, after acknowledging the ‘ ANCIENT VEDIC SANATANA DHARMA TRADITION’.



First: New Testament would have been one of the \< branched out
narratives taking recourse to the roots in Post Mahabharata
narratives and embedded in to Purana Narratives / Buddhist tales ; positioning ‘Old Testament’ as one of the intermediary historical documents in between the time period \< Sindhu Sarasvati civilization circa 6000 BCE upper limit and Pre-Dhammapada > 



Second: The Abrahamic religions and indology –linguistics would have their ‘ Tower of Babel’ based language- branching using the ‘Vedic Narratives’ ! And Samskruth scholars would be working to derive ‘ Hebrew’ from ‘ Vedic Sanskrit’ !



B. The Hypothetical situation would have resulted in a total absence of ‘Religion anchored Thousand Years war ( in Europe) as war of infidels (Saber and Cross for thousand years), and eliminated the seeds of ‘ race supremacy ending in genocide and last world -war’.



C. The Hypothetical INDIAN HISTORIC SCENARIO would have been the HISTORY OF ‘RAMA-RASHTRA (– Or Dharma Rajya/ RASHTRAM ) from Ayodhya
(Or HASTINAPAUR’) in the place of ‘Sultanates rule from Red-Fort’ .



D. On \< Are we not taught to accept noble thoughts from all over the world to be accepted? If not can we ever would have seen any footprints of Zorashtrians etc in this country?

While we accept noble thoughts It's our right to protect what's rightfully our's. \> YES, the TIME is not appropriate to fight the Cyber Wars from ‘ inscribing Stylus’ on ‘Palm leaves’. 



There has to be a sense and direction of ‘ Strategy and action for protection of what is rightfully a part of WROLD CIVILIZATION AND HUMAN HERITAGE beyond ‘ Places of Religion’
