The theory of imitation of Christianity is probably proposed to explain the claims of monotheism in the colonial time born organizations such as Arya Samaj and Brahmo Samaj.

  

Even in that case

  

\(1\) Based on the claims of these new organizations, to generalize that entire Hinduism brought in monotheism claims in imitation of Christianity has ativyaapti dosha.

  

\(2\) Even limited to organizations such as Arya Samaj, the imitation theory is wrong because what Swami Dayananda Saraswati did was to counter argue or to do purva paksha of the claims or false understanding that the Vedic tradition was polytheistic and not to create a new monotheistic interpretation of the Vedas. Heshowed, the way we are doing in this thread, from the evidences within the Vedic texts that those texts had the concept of "One as many" (to use Prof. Sati Sankar's words)as central to them. So it was a rejoinder and revival not an imitation, even in the case of Arya Samaj.
