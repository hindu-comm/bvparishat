Professor Korada,  

 You are a scholar and the following arguments are not intended to challenge your views, but just to project a counter-point.  
  

It has become customary to say that Hinduism is not a religion but a way of life. This is stated by persons of different persuasions: those who wish to say that Hinduism is vague and confused; those who wish to present Hinduism as 'scientific' and useful in a world in which religion seems to be becoming irrelevant and is even seen as a negative force; by those who try and fail to draw a circle and say this is what Hinduism is; and by those who have never studied the scriptures and have picked up the phrase from others.  
  

Since, then, "Hinduism is not a religion but a way of life" is stated not only by the opponents of the religion, but also by its supporters, the whole issue needs to be examined. There are questions that need to be examined along with this, if the final answer is not to suffer from ambiguities. Two of these questions are implied in what you have written: 1) Does the concept of religion apply in the Indian context where ancient Indians believed more in 'mata' or opinion and 'path' or different approaches to God. 2) Should Hinduism not be equated with Sanatana Dharma.  
  

There is no doubt that we have moved into an age where different religions are not only in competition with one another, but also tend to take a rigid and exclusive position. This rigidity is antithetical to a faith that says "यो यथा मां प्रपद्यन्ते तान्स्थैव भजाम्यहम्" Hinduism is a spiritual philosophy where the worshiped adjusts to the desires of the worshiper rather than expecting the worshiper to stick to a rigid method of worship.  
  

Then, where is the problem?  
  
The problem arises when Zakir Naik quotes from Hindi scriptures to prove that some of the attributes of God in Hindu scriptures are those of Allah, and, therefore, Allah is there in Hindu scriptures. As a Hindu I am ready to accept this. But would Zakir Naik accept if I sit in a mosque and worship a Hindu God because that is afterall a representation of Allah?  
  

What creates the problem is that one is forced in today's world to defend Hinduism against attacks that are not based on spiritual philosophy or logic, but upon religion as a social force. That is what brings in 'religion', even though 'dharma' is a universal law applicable to all human beings.  
  

Let us look at the issue from another angle. Psychologists have been trying to understand the inscrutable human mind. Psychoanalysts, Behaviorists, Gestaltists, Positivists, Congnitivists, Personality theorists and innumerable others have given their different approaches to an understanding of the mind. None of these approaches is the mind. Just as none of the religions is God.  
  

To the faithful Hindu, of course, God is Rama, just as to the faithful Christian it is the Holy Spirit. But discussions involve logic, not faith.  
  

Western monism begins to confuse our own द्वैत-अद्वैत dichotomy because we have got used to understanding our scriptures through Western eyes and through a Western language. In the following shlokah from Srimad Bhagwad Geeta, do we infer द्वैत or अद्वैत when He who says this is an avatar?  
  
ब्रह्मार्पणं ब्रह्महविर्ब्रह्माग्नौ ब्रह्मणा हुतम्।  
ब्रह्मैव तेन गन्तव्यं ब्रह्मकर्मसमाधिना।।  
  
In my opinion both द्वैत and अद्वैत are the गुणाः of ईश्वरः Like so much else seems contradictory when we try to understand it through human logic, the simultaneous existence of द्वैत and अद्वैत seems contradictory when we try to understand it logically.  
  

We have failed because we have made English the medium of our discussions of Hindu spirituality. We need to start the tradition of discussing in Sanskrit. You as a great scholar can give the lead and take along the beginners like me. I hope to soon jump on the bandwagon of those who write fully in Sanskrit. We should build up a tradition of discussing our scriptures in Sanskrit and bring the standards of discussion to a level where the Westerners feel compelled to learn our language to get wisdom. The possibility of putting up our articles on our websites removes the difficulty you mentioned in one of your posts where you said the Western press ignored your book on linguistics.  
  

First and foremost, we must learn to approach our ancient writings with an open mind operating like a blank slate. We need to be led by what TS Eliot said in his essay on Philip Massinger in his book The Sacred Wood, published in 1920. He says: "the advantage of good scholarship is that it presents us with evidence which is an invitation to the critical faculty of the reader: it bestows a method, rather than a judgment."  
  

We need to focus on new interpretive tools rather than rigidify our views about the scriptures. For, if we try to look at the scriptures every time with a new perspective we might find meanings that we had never thought of.  
  

Take the following shlokah from Srimad Bhagwad Geeta, for example: 
****

  
श्रोत्रादीनीन्द्रियाण्यन्ये संयमाग्निषु जुह्वति  
शब्दादीन्विषयानन्य इन्द्रियाग्निषु जुह्वति  
  

I take the second line to mean that even deep indulgence of the senses is a kind of yajna. Interpreters of the shlokah with a rigid 'Hindu' mind try to fit this into 'family dharma' and all that. But where is the need for such forced fitting? Why can't we simply accept and say, "Yes, complete application of the senses, when for instance listening to a raga or watching a dance, is also a kind yajna"?  
  

Thanks for your patience in reading this long note.  
  

Regards,  

Dogra, Chennai.
