Is notthe thread getting digressed from the original theme ?

  

Young children are being told that 'Hinduism', before the British had polytheism. It is when the Christian missionaries told them that you are polytheistic, but see we are monotheistic, they started claiming that 'ours is also a monotheistic religion'. This, when told to a young audience knows the ancientGreek Polytheism which is a polytheism that excludes monotheism and Christianity which is a monotheism that excludes polytheism, there is a scope for misunderstanding. That what is being called as 'Hinduism' has a different situation is to be communicated to such audience.
