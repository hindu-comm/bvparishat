Shri Sugyan,  

 Standard DTP softwares do not use unicode. I think a little bit of technical background to the issue might help:  
  

Unicode records the data of languages as numbers and not as letters. For example, here is how it records a sentence written in Devanagari: "à¤•à¥‹à¤¨à¥ à¤µà¤¸à¥ à¤®à¤¿à¤¨à¥ à¤¸à¤¾à¤®à¥ à¤ªà¥.." When we try to retrieve this data, a reverse process takes place and the numbers are converted into letters. Microsoft has built this process of converting fonts into numbers and back into letters. But companies like Adobe have not adopted this.  
  

So, you have two choices --- either to use Microsoft's Word document, which will allow you to use unicode, but will not provide the type of formatting available in InDesign or PageMaker. The other choice is to convert your unicode font into an ANSI font by using a conversion software and use it for printing in InDesign, or PageMaker.  
  

Conversion softwares are available on the Internet that allow you to convert ANSI to Unicode and vice-versa. But you have to go through the text after conversion, because the conversion sometimes creates junk characters also.  
  

Regards,  

Dogra
