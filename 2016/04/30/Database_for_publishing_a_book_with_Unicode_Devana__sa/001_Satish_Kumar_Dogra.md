Mr. Sugyan, the question is not clear --- at least, to me.  
  

Unicode is a font. You are talking of a database for publishing a book. What exactly do you mean by that? A database is what you use for creating a retrieval system. For instance, you use SQL or MySQL or DB or a host of other databases for filling up data and then retrieving them. Like, I use MySQL and PHP for my databases.  
  

Printing of a book uses something like Indesign or PageMaker. These are not databases, but DTP software.  
  

So, are you in the process of creating a database, or are you planning to print your book with the help of Indesign or PageMaker? I know Indesign does not use unicode. I do not know about Pagemaker. So, if you use Indesign you will have to use a non-unicode font.  
  

Please feel free to contact me over 9840093148  

Regards,  

Dogra.
