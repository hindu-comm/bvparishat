Hi,

  

I would like to request everyone to use Unicode fonts wherever possible, be it on webpages, Whatsapp, facebook and Prints. This is very useful to create content on the web which is searchable. ANSI fonts not at all can be searched. When we need to stylize the prints then we can use other Non-Unicode fonts but wherever possible create contents using Unicodes.  

  

Thanks,

Alankar
