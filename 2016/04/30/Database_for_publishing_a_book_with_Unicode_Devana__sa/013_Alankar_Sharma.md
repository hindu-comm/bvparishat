Sugyan Ji Namaskar,

  

My pritny magazine ' Prachya Majusha' is printed using Unicode fonts only. I use Sanskrit2003 font for Sanskrit and Hindi articles.

  

To use Unicode fonts you need CorelDraw 6 which supports Unicode fonts. I am using it for quite few years now. Let me know if I could be of any help.

  

Thanks,

Alankar
