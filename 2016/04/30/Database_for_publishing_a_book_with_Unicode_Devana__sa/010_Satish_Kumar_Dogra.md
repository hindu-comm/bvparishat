Most welcome Sugyan Ji. If there is any difficulty just put me in contact with whoever is doing your printing job. I can sort out any technical issues with him on your behalf. You are a venerable Lover of Sanskrit for whom I have very high regard. I would consider it my privilege to be of assistance to you in whatever manner possible.  
  

Recently I formatted my laptop and my Adobe CS software got deleted. I shall try to get it installed in the next couple of days, if possible. In case I am able to install it, I can help with formatting of your documents in future. Whenever I publish something, I myself format it in InDesign and give it to the publisher as a PDF file. This prevents spelling mistakes and also ensures the exact format you are looking for.  
  

I consider any assistance given to someone for promotion of Sanskrit as a service to Ma Saraswati. And since you are one of her ardent devotees, I won't mind working as your unpaid assistant.  

  
Incidentally, I am neither a professor nor a PhD. I am a retired police officer. So, please feel free to address me as Dogra or Satish.  
  
Regards,  

Dogra.
