Namaste,

  

I have experience of over 15 years in publishing. Following are my suggestions:

  

1\. Use **ONLY** Unicode fonts. Sanskrit2003 is just perfect. There are very many benefits with using Unicode fonts over old style. The most important being portability across fonts.

  

2\. Use some standard publishing tool. If you are a Windows user, InDesign is the best. If you have academic connections, InDesign academic versions (student / teacher editions) are significantly cheaper. Otherwise Adobe tools are quite expensive.

  

3\. Do not use obsolete tools. PageMaker is obsolete for over 10 years. 

  

4\. There are significant benefits in using a proper tool like InDesign over MS Word like word processors, especially for layoutting. InDesign is basically a page layout tool.

  

Please do contact me if you have any further questions.

  

pranams,

  

Krishna Kumar
