Respected Scholars,

Namaste !

I want a photo-copy of abbreviation part of a book : Kalidasa Complete Collection of the various Readings of the Madras Manuscripts, Vol - 2, Ed. T. Foulkes, 1904. So I request you to get these pages from the Library of BORI, Or Madras University, or from any rich / old oriental Library. I want just a list of those pages which shows a list of utilized manuscripts for the various readings of Shaakuntalam.

You can take photographs by your mobile & send it to by WhatsApp. My mobile number is 094277 00064.

Regards,

Vasantkumar Bhatt
