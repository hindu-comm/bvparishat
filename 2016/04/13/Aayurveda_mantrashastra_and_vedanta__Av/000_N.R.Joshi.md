Prof S. Korada, Saadara PraNAma !

As always, your posting on Aayurveda, Mantrashaastra and Vedanta is loaded with information. I have at present a couple of questions.

First question-- There are mantras in Yajurveda for graha( like Mangala, Budha from Phala Jyotisâ€™a I suppose) adhidevatas and Pratyadhidevatas.

What is the difference between Adhidevata and Pratyadhidevata?

I am asking this question because in Brihaddevata, Shounaka talks about Abhimaanee devata and Nipaata devataa. When one invokes one devata, the other devata may also appear along (Nipaata devata). I may be wrong.

My seond question---Mananaat traayate iti mantrah.

By this are you implying here Manana as an inference arrived at by reasoning? So one is saved from reaching wrong inference. (I may be wrong in my understanding. If so please correct me) There are other meanings to the same word such as thinking, meditation etc.

Thanks.N.R.Joshi
