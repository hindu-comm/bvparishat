नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

  

First question-- There are mantras in Yajurveda for graha( like Mangala, Budha from Phala Jyotis’a I suppose) adhidevatas and Pratyadhidevatas.

What is the difference between Adhidevata and Pratyadhidevata?

I am asking this question because in Brihaddevata, Shounaka talks about Abhimaanee devata and Nipaata devataa. When one invokes one devata, the other devata may also appear along (Nipaata devata). I may be wrong.

                         -- Vidvan N R Joshi

As per the tradition , one should not perform ग्रहजप only - it should be followed by जप for अधिदेवता and प्रत्यधिदेवता also - simply to please them too .

For every hundred ग्रहमन्त्रs 4 or 5 for अधिदेवता and प्रत्यधिदेवता ।

It is an order - just like - ब्रह्मन् (कारणब्रह्म) - ब्रह्मा (कार्यब्रह्म / सृष्टिकर्ता ) - विष्णुः (स्थितिः) - महेश्वरः ( लयः) and so on .

If you want the meaning -- अधि means अधिका ( Patanjali under स्वरितेनाधिकारः पा सू explains अधिकः कारः अधिकारः) - in day to day conversations also we say he is अधिकारी - which means he has something more to do when compared with others. So अधिका देवता अधिदेवता ।

अधिदेवताम् अधिदेवतां प्रति प्रत्यधिदेवता ।

Just try to understand one thing - Bhartrhari in Brahmakanda of VakyapadIyam says - ऋषीणामपि यज्ज्ञानम् तदप्यागमपूर्वकम् - even the knowledge of sages has got its roots in Veda . So we have limited access to Vedas (only 12 Branches out of 1137).

My seond question---Mananaat traayate iti mantrah.

By this are you implying here Manana as an inference arrived at by reasoning? So one is saved from reaching wrong inference. (I may be wrong in my understanding. If so please correct me) There are other meanings to the same word such as thinking, meditation etc.

---- that is right . While doing जप one should think the meaning of the मन्त्र and then only it would be fruitful.

मन = ज्ञाने (दिवादिः) + त्रैङ् = पालने (भ्वादिः) ।

Thinking per se cannot be termed as मन्त्र - if such a usage is there then it is औपचारिक ( shade of original meaning) .

Meditation is ध्यानम् in योग and निदिध्यासनम् in वेदान्त । ध्यै = चिन्तायाम् is the root . So while doing जप one should concentrate on the देवता - ध्यानम् is एकतानता = concentrating on a single thing .
