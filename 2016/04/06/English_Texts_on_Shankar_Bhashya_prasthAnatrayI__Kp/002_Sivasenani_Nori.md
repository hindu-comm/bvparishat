Following are the translators of Sankaracarya's Bhashya on Brahmasutras:

  

1\. Rev. K. C. Banerjea - ends abruptly in the middle of 1.2.4 - 1870.

2\. George Thibaut - influenced translation numbers 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Generally very good, but in translating the Vedic sentences follows the view of Max Muller (the general editor of the series "Books of the Orient"), rather than Sankaracharya's views given in Upanishadbhashyas. circa 1890.

3\. Swami Vireswarananda - of the Ramakrishna Math. Swamiji drops quite large sections in his translation, which is otherwise faithful. In its introduction it tries to address the charges made by Thibaut that Sankaracarya interpreted the Sutras against the views of Sutrakaara. 1936.

4\. Swami Sivananda - presents the summary of the arguments in Bhashya, and sometimes Swamiji's own interpretation. It follows Thibaut's translation of Vedic sentences. 1949.

5\. V. H. Date, 1954.

6\. Vasedeo Mahadev Apte, 1960.

7\. Swami Gambhirananda, 1965. - The most dependable and faithful translation of all (without considering No. 8). Stands out for translating Vedic sentences (these 2,200 odd Vedic sentences quotes and discussed are important because Brahmasutras may be described as an attempt to fix the meaning of certain Vedic sentences spread over nearly 200 topics).

8\. I believe Chinmaya International Foundation has released the English Translation of ChatussUtrI. I did not get the opportunity to go through it, but it is said to be most detailed - of the whole lot.

  

Apart from the above, many have written on Sankaaracharya's views. Prominent amongst those are Paul Duessen, Leo Barnett and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. Though the topics are presented in a different order, the treatment on specific topics - say epistemology - is easier.

  

Finally Dr. K. Aravinda Rao, IPS, former DGP of the erstwhile AP, did his Ph. D. on Epistemology in Upanishads. I would think that he mainly followed Sankaracharya's views, given his later extensive work in Advaita.

  

There is also a brief summary by S. Tattvabhushan (early twentieth century) a follower of Raja Rammohan Roy, but let us say, that book has a few "innovations".

  

The enquirer might also find English translations of glosses on Sankaracharya's bhashya like Bhamati (available on the CatussUtrI part) and Vivarana, useful.
