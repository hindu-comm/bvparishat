Respected Scholars,  
  
Pranamas  
  
I am looking some English texts on epistemology specially on Shankar Bhashya and other Vetantic Texts.  
I googled for it but didn't find it.  
  
If someone scholars knows the name of translator/writer of English text of Vedanta book, please help me to find it.  
  
With regards  
  
Dr. Janakisharan
