Respected scholars, Namaskar!

Thanks to Dr.D.Bhattacharya, Dr.Hari Bhat and other scholars who responded to my posting on English spelling of Sanskrit words

Let me rephrase my question.

I was not asking for different pronunciation of the word Hansa (swan) from different parts of India.

Devanagari script uses dot on the letter to show effect of Anuswaara in all words. English script has no convenience of dot (on the top) like Sanskrit .

However in English writing of Sanskrit words Gangaa and Mandala the ‘n’ is replaced by the corresponding nasal with diacritical marks.

When we pronounce the Sanskrit word Vamsha, (or Samshaya) we certainly feel that nasal here is entirely different from the listed ones for the first five rows of the Varnamala. How to express it in English spelling? By

1.  Vaṁsha

or (2) Vaṃsha

or (3) Vamsha with chandrabindu on the top of m ?

Was there any effort in the history to complement the current Varnamala with nasals involved in pronunciation of words like Samvatsara, Prashamsaa, Samvaada.

Many scholars of BVP are familiar with the ancient Shiks’aa treatises. They could add their knowledge on this subject for our understanding. Thanks. N.R.Joshi
