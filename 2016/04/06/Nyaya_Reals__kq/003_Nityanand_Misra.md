A brief explanation of ‘abhāva’ is to be found in Dr. Dayananda Bhargava's translation of Tarkasaṃgraha and Tarkadīpikā (MLBD, ISBN 81-208-225-0, 2007 reprint, pp. 22-23).

  

For the meaning of ‘svarūpavān’, it must be first decided in which sense the ‘matup’ suffix is. As per MBh 5.2.94 we have ‘bhūmanindāpraśaṃsāsu nityayoge’tiśāyane, sambandhe’stivivakṣāyāṃ bhavanti matubādayaḥ’. We can possibly rule out ‘bhūma’, ‘nindā’, ‘nityayoga’, ‘atiśāyana’ and think of the other senses. The ‘Kiraṇavalīprakāśa’ of Vardhamāna Upādhyāya may throw some light on the sense of the suffix or ‘svarūpavān’.
