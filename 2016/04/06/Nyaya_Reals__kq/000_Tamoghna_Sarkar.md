Dear Members,  
In an interpretation of Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika ontology,  
each category, including abhāva, is real since it is svarūpavān. (‘Abhāvah̩ tu svarūpavān api’, Kiranāvali). Can anyone provide any other textual reference in favor of this? Can anyone of the learned scholars highlight what can be the possible explanation of 'svarūpavān' in this context?
