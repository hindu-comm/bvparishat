Dear Scholars,

I think that अभावस्तु स्वरूपवान् this statement should be understood in the following way. An अभाव can be substratum of some properties as well as property of something else. The svarūpa of an abhāva should be understood only in this way. शशशृंग can neither be a substratum of any property nor a property of something else. This is the difference between an abhāva and शशशृंग Udayana is willing to highlight when he is making such a statement.

With regards
