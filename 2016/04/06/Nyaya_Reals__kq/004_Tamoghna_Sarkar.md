Thank you Prof. Korada,

But in what sense abhāva is at per with dravya etc in being svarupavān? svarupavān 'API'.. Is it svarupavān as it is sat like dravya etc? And what is svarūpa of dravya etc if we understand the svarūpa of abhāva aspratiyoginirūpaṇādhīna?  
These are my concerns. You can also suggest some readings.
