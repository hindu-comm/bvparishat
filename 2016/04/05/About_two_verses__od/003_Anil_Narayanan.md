Sir,  
 The very first verse can be traced out in subhashitavali- a compiled work-attributed to vallabhadeva (16th cent.?). I think this vallabhadeva is different from vallabha (10th cent.) who wrote raghupanchika commentary on raghuvamsha..let the scholars shed more light on this subject..  
 thanking you,
