Respected scholars,

I am glad to inform that IIT Gandhinagar is inviting applications from young scholars in Sanskrit for a one-year appointment. Details are below. I will be grateful if this is shared widely, especially among bright PhD scholars in Sanskrit departments or research institutions of high standards.

IIT Gandhinagar invites PhD students in Sanskrit or PhD holders not yet into a career path to apply for a one-year post as Sanskrit Instructor. Selected candidates will be expected to offer two courses per semester, one at the beginner and one at the intermediate level. They will be free to propose other activities related to Sanskrit learning. The post will be limited to a term of one year, with a different Instructor selected every year. The monthly remuneration will be in the range of Rs. 30,000/-.

 Interested candidates should apply with their CV, a short Statement of Purpose and a brief outline of proposed courses to : Professor- in-Charge Faculty affairs, IIT Gandhinagar, Village Palaj, Simkheda, Gandhinagar, Gujarat 382355. Applications should be sent by Speedpost, with a scanned copy additionally send by email to [\<faculty.r...@iitgn.ac.in]().>



I may add independently that applications for faculty positions in Sanskrit, Indology, History of science, etc. can always be made. Scholars with some interdisciplinary competences as well as innovative projects may generally be preferred. To apply, the following pages may be consulted:
