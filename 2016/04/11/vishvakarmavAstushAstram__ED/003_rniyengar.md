Dear Sri Bijay,

I am asking about the commentator and not the editors. I have the book downloaded from the DLI site. Some 10 pages are missing in this scan! Please give the link to the IIT Bombay site. Or you please send me the 1990 second edition by email.

I find that there are several texts attributed to Vishwakarma. If you have e-link to Vishwakarma-prakaasha, please let me know.

Thanks for your response.  

  

RN Iyengar
