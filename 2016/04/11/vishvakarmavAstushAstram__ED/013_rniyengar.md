Dear Prof.Murty,

Thanks for taking trouble to go thro' your copy of VKP. Your book is same as what Sri Bijay Upadhyaya sent me. I have also gone through the long text and did not find the desired word! Now, coming to works attributed to Vishvakarma; there are several different texts.The one that I was originally referring wasविश्वकर्मवास्तुशास्त्रम्published by Sarasvati Mahal, Tanjavur. As per your desire I am attaching (by private mail) the text and the commentary of the relevant portion of the text. The complete Chapter 53 is attached. Please see verse 8 for
मिर्णिका. There is a VK-Vaastuvidya available at Maharshi University website, published by Somapura. Gujarat. This also does not haveमिर्णिका. I am working onNārada Śilpa Śāstra which has this word.... Hence, I am curious to know which other authors use this word meaning "lock" and also about the origin of this word. The word might have appeared in non-Vaastu texts also. Thanks for your cooperation and interest.

with personal regards

  

RN Iyengar
