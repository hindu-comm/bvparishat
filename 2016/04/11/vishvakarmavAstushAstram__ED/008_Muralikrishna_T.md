Dear sir,

  

You can also search the book in Personal library of Madhura Krishna Murthy, who has passed a few days back, of Rajamundry. He has worked on Vastu Shastra and wrote many Vastu books. He had a hobby of collection of manuscripts. Now a days the library is kept under the supervision of his Son.

Thank you
