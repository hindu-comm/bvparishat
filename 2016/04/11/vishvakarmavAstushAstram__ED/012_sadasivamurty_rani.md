Dear Sri RN Iyengar Mahodayaah!

Namaste.

I have a book by name Vishvakarma Prakasa in Telugu Script with Telugu Translation in my collection. It is a recently published book (in the year 2004). It has It is a Text in 13 Adhyayas with the titles : 1. Vastu Purusha Varnanam,

2. Svapnavidhi Vichara, 3.Gruharambha Vichara, 4. Sayya Vichara, 5. Sila nyasa vichara, 6. Prasada Nirmanam, 7. Durga Nirmanam, 8. Jalasaya Vichara, 9. Vrksha Chedana-Kashtha vichara, 10. Grhapravesa vichara 11. Durganirmaana Vichaara, 12. Salya Jnana Vichara and 13. Grhavedha Vichara. 

  

I have gone through the entire text for the word Mirnika. But I could not get it. Particularly there is no chapter like Sandhkarma among these 13 adhyayas.

  

If the above thirteen names of the Chapters agree with the chapter names in the TEXT studied by you I request to to specify in which of the above 13 adhyayas the SANDHI KARMA occurs. I shall once again search.

  

Or

If the slokas where the word MIRNIKA is used are given by you in full text (At least one or two slokas) I shall search for those slokas. Even in such case if the word and slokas are not traced out it can be concluded that the text by name VISHVA KARMA PRAKASA which I possess with me may be different from the text you possess with you.

  

I wish that my efforts would be of some help in your pursuits.

Warm Regards, 

**Prof. Rani Sadasiva Murty**

Dear Sri Shankara,

I am extremely thankful to you for your help with theVishvakarma-prakasha.This and several other books on Vaastu are listed in the work of PK Acharya on the Maanasaara and his Encyclopedia(1946) . But the Tanjoreविश्वकर्मवास्तुशास्त्रम् and the commentary (1958) were not listed by him. My interest in these texts is mainly for a comparative study of another text in which several technical words are used. In particular the word मिर्णिका is not listed in MW, Apte and several other koshas including that of PK Acharya. But I found this word in theविश्वकर्मवास्तुशास्त्रम् and its commentary explained as "Lock". It is not just the अर्गल (cross bolt/bar)for doors. Its பூட்ட் in Tamil and ಬೀಗ in Kannada. The current Hindi word does not match withमिर्णि ,मिर्णिक.Initially this seems to have been made of wood, since it is discussed under सन्धिकर्म (modern Joinery).I am curious to know when this word entered Sanskrit vocabulary. Who else has used this word; what is the origin of this word.....Is this used in this sense in any other Indian or foreign language? I would be happy to get realistic etymological and other historical information about the wordमिर्णिका.

I once again thank you for the attractive Pothi style Mss. I like to share the following information from PK Acharya:
