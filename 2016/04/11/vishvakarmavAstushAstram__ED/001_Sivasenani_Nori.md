If Iconography is to be taken as a part of VaastuSaastra, there is one book called देवतामूर्तिप्रकरणम् (<https://archive.org/details/dmp_rm>) which deals with the subject in Sanskrit. The original text was compiled in the fifteenth century by the famous architect of Chittor, सूत्रधारमण्डन, and the Sanskrit commentary was supplied in the twentieth century.

  

The guNa of this book is that it provides a traditional summary of Iconometry, and is much more accurate and much less confusing than the treatment by T. A. Gopianatha Rao (in *The Elements of Hindu Iconography*). As an aside the particular Murtis mentioned, and the varying detail in which they are treated, in these kind of texts are interesting, to say the least. They definitely provide good material for those who are researching issues such as which deity was popular in which part of the country in which time period.

  

Finally it is Sri Hariparshada Das, familiar in BVP, who has so kindly uploaded this book to Archive.org. Many thanks to him.
