Dear sir,

I have seen a book named Ainthiram which is said as the translation of Mayamatam(I think so... its not clear...) in Tamil(written in tamil verses). I had a glance on the introduction of the book in RSVP, Tirupati Library. But its not clear to me that above said topic is available or not. Its published from Tanjavur Library.

Thank you,
