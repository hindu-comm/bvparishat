Dear scholars,

  

The above book with the commentary प्रमाणबोधिनी by अनन्तकृष्ण भट्टारक (ed. Vasudeva Sastri and N.Gadre) has been published by the Sarasvati Mahal Library, Tanjavur, in 1958. This is perhaps the only Vastu book for which a Sanskrit commentary is available (Pl correct me if wrong). My question to scholars here:

  

1\. Is any information available about this commentator अनन्तकृष्ण भट्टारक ? Where and when he lived?

  

2\. In the commentary प्रमाणबोधिनीin several places he refers to his own work Shilpakaladiipika:

Is the above text available in any form? I could not find any online information. The commentator is versatile with eye for even engineering details.Hence my interest in him.

Regards
