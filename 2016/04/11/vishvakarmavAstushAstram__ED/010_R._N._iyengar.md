Dear Sri Shankara,

I am extremely thankful to you for your help with theVishvakarma-prakasha.This and several other books on Vaastu are listed in the work of PK Acharya on the Maanasaara and his Encyclopedia(1946) . But the Tanjoreविश्वकर्मवास्तुशास्त्रम् and the commentary (1958) were not listed by him. My interest in these texts is mainly for a comparative study of another text in which several technical words are used. In particular the word मिर्णिका is not listed in MW, Apte and several other koshas including that of PK Acharya. But I found this word in theविश्वकर्मवास्तुशास्त्रम् and its commentary explained as "Lock". It is not just the अर्गल (cross bolt/bar)for doors. Its பூட்ட் in Tamil and ಬೀಗ in Kannada. The current Hindi word does not match withमिर्णि ,मिर्णिक.Initially this seems to have been made of wood, since it is discussed under सन्धिकर्म (modern Joinery).I am curious to know when this word entered Sanskrit vocabulary. Who else has used this word; what is the origin of this word.....Is this used in this sense in any other Indian or foreign language? I would be happy to get realistic etymological and other historical information about the wordमिर्णिका.

I once again thank you for the attractive Pothi style Mss. I like to share the following information from PK Acharya:
