Dear Sri Shankara,

I am aware of this catalogue. The links you have provided are of course useful in general. But no details are available about the text or about Anantakrishna Bhattaraka. Please see if an e-copy of Vishvakarma-prakasha is available. There is one English doc at scribd but it is too much abridged and is of no help. I understand originallyVishvakarma-prakashawas published by BHU, but I am not sure.

Thanks for your cooperation.

regards

  

RN Iyengar
