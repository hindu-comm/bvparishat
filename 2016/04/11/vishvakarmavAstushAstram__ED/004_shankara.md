Sir,

  

Silpakaladipika is listed in page 62 of 'A Classified Index to the Sanskrit Mss in the Palace at Tanjore' by Burnell published in 1880 available online at <http://wujastyk.net/mscats/Sanskrit_Catalogues/Biswas%200959%20Burnell%20Tanjore%20Palace%20Library%201880/>  

  

Burnell mentions that its manuscript preserved at Tanjore Palace is incomplete.
