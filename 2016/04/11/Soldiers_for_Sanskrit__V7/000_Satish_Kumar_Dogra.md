The editor of Prachi-Pragya, an online e-journal, related in his editorial to the latest issue of the journal the story of a saint who possessed knowledge of the past, present and future. Seeing his popularity rising among the masses, his adversaries decided to spite him by playing a trick. One of them carried a small insect in his closed palm and asked the saint whether the insect in his hand was alive or dead. The plan was to prove the saint wrong by killing the insect, in case he said it was alive, and by showing that it was alive, in case the saint said it was dead. The saint scuttled the question by saying, "It is in your hands to decide whether the insect shall live or die."
