Aalaata chakra etc.are the words used for certain fire related entertaining, acrobaticperforming arts. They are not fire works. But nevertheless involved fire. They were part of a huge list of 'procession-performances' and 'fare-performances', majority of which did not involve fire.

  

Those which involved fire were done with a provision of huge space around and tested control on the part of the performer.



Mismanagement, negligence, not taking care of space availability, playing with hard to controlfire in the vicinity of a fire-works dump etc. have no tradition.
