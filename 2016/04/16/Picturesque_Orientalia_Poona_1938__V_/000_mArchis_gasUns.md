Namaste,

  

 I'm reprinting a book of Buehler and want to add his portrait. In<https://web.archive.org/web/20140910034056/http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz6325.html> I read there is one in R. N. Sardesai, Picturesque Orientalia, Poona 1938, Nr. 10. - is it possible to ask a scholar from Poona to scan it at 600 dpi greyscale, please?
