Today I could access the University of British Columbia’s copy of Rau’s book. It has a black-and-white picture of Bühler on p. 34 taken from “J. Jolly. Georg Bühler 1837 - 1898. Karl J. Trübner Straßburg,1899” (cf. p. 103). Off-list, I am sending two shots of the picture I took with a hand-held camera. They should at least let you decide If you should get a professional reproduction of the image on the specified page of Rau’s book or try to access Rau’s source directly for the same purpose.

  

Best of luck.
