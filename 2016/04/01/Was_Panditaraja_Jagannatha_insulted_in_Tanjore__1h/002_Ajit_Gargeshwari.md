According to above sloka Hrudayamruta was composed in the year 1742. This Jaganntha appears to be different from Panditaraja Jagannatha. One can refer to G.V. Devasthalis paper Jagnnatha Vs. Umanandanatha .Ashwadhaati is a work of Jagnnatha

NCC lists his works separately under two names Jagnnatha Pandita and Umanandanatha
