Namaste,

  

In the preface to the Translation of Bhaminivilasa of Jagannatha (1894), the editor Sri Mahaveerprasad Dwivedi says that the following slokas written by Jagannatha in his work 'Ashwadhaati' prove that he was insulted in Tanjore and had to leave the place.

  

  

**खंजायितोन्धिमति गंजाsपरोपि बत संजायतेत्र धनद**

**संजा धटीति गुण पुंजायि तस्य न तु गुंजामितं चकनकं \|**

**किं जाग्रती जयसि किं जानती स्वपिषि सिंजाननूपुरपदे**

**तंजापुरेषि नवकंजाक्षि साधु तदिदं जातु वा किमु शिवे \|\|**

**  
**

Could someone please *translate these slokas* and decipher the real meaning of them?**

Dhanyavaadah,

  

Praveen.
