Dear Respected Members, 

  

Greetings from CIF!

  

Here is a unique opportunity!

  

Unlike many other cultures, Sanātana-dharma emphasizes a lot on the importance and realization of Art as an Experience. This course, Kalāyoga, offered with the rigour of a Summer School, by Śatāvadhāni R. Ganesh, deals with Art that merges the beauty, joy, and entertainment yet combines as a path to self-realization, contrasting to the logic of vedānta that utilizes the prakriyā of adhyāropa and apavāda.

  

For an introduction to the nature and culture of Art, its creation and appreciation, the aesthetics and Sanskrit poetics, its underlying philosophy and its uniqueness, along with an opportunity to interact at a deep and intense level with Śatāvadhāni R. Ganesh, Prof. Varakhedi and other philosophers and practitioners of art, you are invited to **'Kalāyoga - The Heart of Indian Art',** from July 2-11th, 2016 at Chinmaya International Foundation, Adi Sankara Nilayam, Ernakulam.
