Dear Scholars,

I am searching old issues of the monthly"Tirumalai Sri Venkateshwara" started by the Temple in 1932. Search on the internet produced the information shown below. I would be grateful if any one reliably shares information on how to access the old Temple journal..

Let me explain why I am looking for this Journal. I am interested in a manuscript known as "Narada shilpa shastram." Three paper Mss (Adyar, Baroda, Mysore) are available but the original is not known. The available Mss mentions that it was transcribed by Pt.V. Vijayaraghavacharya, Epigraphist, Tirupati in 1930. I had asked BVP about this text and the epigraphist scribe last year. Recently I got this new information that some chapters of the text were published in the above Temple Journal starting from 1932. Since many BVP scholars are from Tirupati or have close links to Tirupati, I look forward to actionable help.

regards

  

RN Iyengar
