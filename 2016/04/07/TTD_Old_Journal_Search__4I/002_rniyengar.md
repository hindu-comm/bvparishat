Dear Members,

Permit me to pick up an old thread. Narada shilpa manuscript refers to a person by name "Naadadhwani" नादध्वनिः \|\| The context is establishing the BalipeeTha in temples.

.......सर्वेषां वै देवानां देवीनां पुरतःस्थले बलिपीठकम् इत्युवाच
नादध्वनिः \|\|.....

  

He is cited in two other placs also in the above Mss and is clearly different from Naarada.

  

If you have come across this word नादध्वनिः ( not the ending sound of Omkaara) as a personal name in any context in any other text please share the information.

  

regards

  

RN Iyengar
