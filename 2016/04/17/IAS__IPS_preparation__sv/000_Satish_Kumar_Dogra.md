A couple of days ago I put up a brief message in Sanskrit telling that I would be happy to guide candidates who wish to appear for the Civil Services Exams (IAS / IPS) with Sanskrit as their medium. This is a more detailed message about the same topic. I request the members of the group to take it to the notice of those who might like to utilise my services.  
  

Let me make a few points clear:  
  

For those who appear with other languages as their media, the service I render is a paid service as it involves a drain on my time, energy and finances. However, I am making an exception for those with Sanskrit medium in the belief that more and more people with knowledge of Sanskrit in the top positions of India would be congenial for the growth and popularity of Sanskrit.  
  

The Preliminary Exam for CS-2016 is scheduled for 7th August. So, a little more than three months alone are left. Therefore, those interested in appearing this year need to take a decision fast.  
  

I would suggest that even those who are not sure of success this year should appear. One attempt will give them a clear idea of what the entire exercise involves. And one never knows. If they clear the Preliminaries, they will feel enthused to work for the Mains.  
  

Those planning to appear next year or during subsequent years should begin to tune their mind now itself. For them I can run a separate orientation-training where they can be given gradual tuning of mind.  
  

How will I help the prospective candidate?  
  

CS exam is not just a matter knowledge, but also of technique and nerves. The test is intended not to select scholars but youngsters who can handle huge amounts of reading material by striking a balance. Also, the pre-exam tension is very high. So, one has train oneself to hold one's nerves. Therefore, my training focuses on personality and thinking-styles. It also involves sharpening of the mind, so that you can grasp things better and your turn-out of work is more in quantum and of better quality than that of others.  
  

How tough is the exam?  
  

CS exam is one of the toughest in India. But those who go systematically about it are able to make it, while those with a haphazard approach flounder. Even if you have been working steadily for many months, you would need to devote at least one last month with total and exclusive attention.  
  

What will be my role in the training?  
  

CS exam is not something where you can spoon-feed a candidate. He or she will have work on their own. My role is to act as a dashboard to indicate to them whether they are going along the correct lines. As things move forward, I would wish to interact with the entire group every evening over skype where issues could be discussed and information exchanged. It will be a slow build-up towards gaining confidence and level of preparation that makes success almost sure.  
  

I again request members of the group to bring the contents of this post to the knowledge of those prospective candidates who are serious about trying for the IAS / IPS. If a sizable number of Sanskrit-knowing candidates begin to enter into these services, it will change the complexion of these services. As things pick up, I am sure I will be able to take others among my friends on board as trainers.
