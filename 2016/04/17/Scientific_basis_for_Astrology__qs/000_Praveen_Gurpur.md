Namaste,

  

I was wondering if in any of the Sanskrit works on Jyotisha Shastra, they mention the**scientific basis and logic**of how positions of planets and stars in the sky at the time of a person's birth govern his/her entire life?

  

Being a researcher in Biotechnology, I am always curious how astrology actually 'works' ? Frankly, how can heavenly bodies 'dictate' a person's life and future? is it through gravitational pull (like the moon's effects on tides?)...but that does not explain how a person's life-course is 'sealed' by the heavenly bodies at his time of birth, does it?...

  

Thanks,

  

Praveen.
