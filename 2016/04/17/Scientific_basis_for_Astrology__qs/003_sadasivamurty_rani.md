Three Cheers for Sri BVK Sastry Garu for your excellent reply Sir!.

Yes. The conclusion with two options given by Sri Sastry garu are the best of their kind.

Those who are interested to know should study and not merely reading the ancient texts on Astronomy and Astrology. Then they can get all the required answers and they being scientists can help others also to learn from them what our ancient people's contribution is. 

Regards,

**Prof. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
