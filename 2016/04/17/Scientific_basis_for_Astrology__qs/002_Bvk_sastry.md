You have asked a good fundamental question on ' human action guidance and record of action- history ( vidhi- preraNA + vidhi- likhita) which has been answered by ancient disciplines related to vedas.

Modern Physicists call this phenomenon by the statement: ' everything in universe is connected' .

  

The principle of connectivity ( sutra) is not questioned. The human interest- curiosity- greed to know and meddle with future is the issue. If sci- fi movies talk of time- travel ( and produce blockbusters to plant fancy research ideas and ideations in society), they are ' swallowed, rather gulped raw!' The ' logic' is not questioned , knowing fully well that ' linear time- reckoning model has no way of taking a negative value. In other words' past- tense' ( bhoota-kaala) for a scientist is ONLY the Historic Record of an Event at Then- Current Time, which no more exists ; and therefore can not be visited back! When time does not exist, space does not exist; when time-space combine does not exist, there is no action or agent ( kartaa or karma). The TIME (kaala- Purusha) concept in Vedanga Jyotisha is a cyclic Sacred time ( kaala- chakra/ punarAvrutti). In this model, time- travel back is a way of peeping and seeing in and in- to TIME and events that unfold in its movement.

  

For this TIME analysis, the field of energy postulated is KAALA- Jyoti: light of Time/ Time- Light deeply associated with consciousness, agency, intention.( the total meaning of Samkalpa stated as Aham- Karishye).
The tools of analysis in the discipline of JYOTISHA (= kaala- jyoti- shaastra to know Mahaa-kaala- Purusha) provide NINE cosmic capturing energies( nava- grahas) impacting the ' moment- at which agent is acting'.( lagna- muhurta).

  

These cosmic capturing energy fields are marked in relation to the nine visible cosmic bodies (- as outside planets?!) and inside body as different bio - features.

  

Modern Science/ bio- technology has no matching postulate for the concepts in Jyotisha. Jyotisha researchers have no evidence base organization to convince the scientific groups looking for statistical model and double blind fold trial samples. This does not work with Jyotish! The moment never repeats !

  

Summing up: the choice is : do research as varahamihira, bharadwaja and the like to explore nature- Time- Divine to understand Jyotish working model ( and its parihara system of devata-mantras)

  

Or

  

Pool funds for dialogue of research scientists in bio- technology and modern physics to study Jyotish fundamentals to map their frame of thoughts and tools.

  

Till then, the dialogue remains on parallel track motion!
