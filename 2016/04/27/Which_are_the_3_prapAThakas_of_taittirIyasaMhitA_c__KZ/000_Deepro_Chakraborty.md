Dear All,

Are there some three anuvakas in the Taittiriya Yajurveda which are called Ishti or related to Isti?

I am editing and translating a siksha text called Sambhusiksha in which there is a half-verse-- दशमाद्यास्त्रयः प्रश्ना इष्टयो नामसंज्ञकाः। (पाठान्तरम्-- दशमादि त्रयः प्रश्ना इष्टयो नाम उच्यते).

I am unable to interpret this line as I have no idea about these three prapathakas referred to here. Please enlighten me.

  

Regards,

Deepro Chakraborty.
