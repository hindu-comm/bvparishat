Resp. Nityanand Mishra Sir, it is commonly held that this bird is separated from his/her sweat-heart after Sun-set, and reunited at the day-break. Does the bird referred to by you, Ruddy, has this quality described in the said book? If it is so, this bird may be held as Chakravaaka most familiar in Sanskrit literature. Regards,
