Nagaraj ji,  
नमस्ते ।  
  
I went through some of this quite interesting research done by Prof Vidwan, kindly shared here by you.  
  
The following is a brief comment on a very specific point.  
  
Naradiya's 5 Shrutis and Bharata's 22 Shrutis in my opinion are compatible with each other: more than that, these two even make each other consistent.  
  
In my earlier thread "Specifics of Sanskrit Varnamala" on BVP three equivalent matrices (named L, R, C matrix) were discussed as being the daivika generators of the Varnamala.  
  
Within each matrix, further, the diagonal elements (5 in number) were shown as the base elements. Out of these 5, two were said to be the boundary elements.  
  
The production of Music follows the same daivika route. Five daivika Shrutis are visualised as the base swaras. And then the 5x5 matrix is created.  
  
The matrix generates, in this way, 25 elements - a number perilously close to Bharata's 22.  
  
Bharata's 22, therefore, are a subdivision of Naradiya's 5 (with 3 fundamental swaras of the 5 subtracting from the total number 25; these 3 are the same as the RgVedic swaras).  
  
It is surprising to see deep consistencies running across all Vedic branches. The evidence is overwhelming.
