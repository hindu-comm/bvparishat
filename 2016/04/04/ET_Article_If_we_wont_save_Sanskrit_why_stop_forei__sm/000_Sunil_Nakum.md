Namaste,  
  

I come across this article on Economic Times website published on 3rd April, 2016. My intention is not to invite everyone's option and start a discussion (if anyone chooses to, they are mostwelcome), but to share this incident if someone has missed it.  

  

If we won't save Sanskrit, why stop foreigners from doing so?

Let me try to summarize it from what I've interpreted so far,  
  
The news article rounds about the choice of Sheldon Pollock as chief editor for an English translation project of some 500 volumes of Classical Indian texts at Murty Classic Library, Columbia University. About 130 academicians have wrote to Narayana Murthy and his son Rohan indicating that Pollock had insufficient "respect and empathy for the greatness of Indian civilization". The article does not clarify what happened after this incident. Being, unaware of other details, I tend to agree with the opinion of JNU professor Makarand Paranajpe, one of the signatory of the appeal that such ambitious project should have been undertaken by Indian Scholars and by outsourcing it Mr Murthy has reinforced West's leading role in interpreting India for Indians.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil
