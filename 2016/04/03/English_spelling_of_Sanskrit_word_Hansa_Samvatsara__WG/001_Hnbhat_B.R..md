In Devanagari writing a dot on the consonant performs the function of nasal. But problem arises when writing English spelling of Sanskrit words like Samvatsara or Hansa. Here is the question

4\) haṃsa is correct following Sanskrit.

The easy solution is to use देवनागरी fonts and write हंसः instead of using different spellings in roman and get confused every time which is correct. Also 4) saṃvatsara or संवत्सरः . You can use dot below or above "m" as it does not affect the pronunciation in Sanskrit. "chandrabindu" is not used for अनुस्वार generally. It is used rarely in sandhi forms as सँयन्ता, सँवत्सऱः etc. अनुस्वार is commonly used and correct.
