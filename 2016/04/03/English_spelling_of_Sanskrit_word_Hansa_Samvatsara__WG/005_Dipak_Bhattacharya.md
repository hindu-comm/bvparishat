Dear Dr. Joshi,

Will you kindly allow me to clarify the position as I understand?

As you write ‘For remaining two rows of semivowels and sibilants there are no nasal orthographs. In Devanagari writing a dot on the consonant performs the function of nasal’

There cannot be any question of nasals for the two rows of semivowels; for, for consonants nasality and place of articulation are integral in ङ ञ म etc.
