Respected scholars, Namaskar!

For first five rows of Sanskrit varnamala there are separate nasals one for each row. For remaining two rows of semivowels and sibilants there are no nasal orthographs. In Devanagari writing a dot on the consonant performs the function of nasal. But problem arises when writing English spelling of Sanskrit words like Samvatsara or Hansa. Here is the question

How to write English spelling of the Sanskrit word Hansa (swan).

Is it (1) Hansa,

or (2) Hamsa

Or (3) Haṁsa

or (4) Haṃsa

or (5) Hamsa with chandrabindu on the top of m

In the character maps of Times New Roman and Tahoma (these two fonts show diacritical marks intact in PDF versions, that is why I am using them),

I do not find character m with chandrabindu on its top? Is there other solution to this problem? Thanks N. R. Joshi.
