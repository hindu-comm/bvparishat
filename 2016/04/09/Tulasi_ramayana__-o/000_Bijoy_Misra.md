Friends,

  

As some of you might be aware, Tulasi Ramayana has been

a staple of an Indian immigrant's life ever since bonded laborers

were rounded up from Bihar ro come to work in the plantations

in the west some hundred fifty years ago. We are told that the

book was smuggled in the pretext of a "love story" since no

religious books were supposed to be carried.

  

I was requested to read the book in the events of need (there were

many!) some thirty five years ago. We continue every year. Reading

Ramayana is an internal journey.

  

We begin today at noonand continue for twenty four hours. I am sharing

the news from the life of a fellow practitioner. Seek your blessings.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
