Dear Prof. Aklujkarji,  
  

I left for Mumbai and Goa a fortnight ago and my first mail on this thread was sent five days ago from Goa, when I could find some time to open my laptop. I have returned just now. As desired by you, I am giving below, some of the Jaina texts relevant to the date of Lord Mahavira.  
  
1)  
The date of demise of Lord Mahavira as commemorated by the Svetambara sect, is by the start of the jaina year called "Vira Nirvana Samvat".(VNS). Lord Mahavira, according to that sect, was born in 599 BCE and he passed away in 527 BCE, ie,  470 years before the start of the Kartikadi Vikram Samvat. in 57 BCE. It has been the practice among the Jainas to calculate the Jaina year accordingly by .adding 470 years to Kartikadi Vikram.  
2)  
Further, Jinasena's "Harivamsha" gives the year of Nirvana of Lord Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankar, by its relationship with the Saka Era, which started in 78 CE. The Nirvana occurred 605 years and 5 months before the start of the Saka Era and that means Lord Mahavira passed away in 527 BCE.  

3)  
Thirdly, "Titthogali Painnaya" and "Dhavalaa" of Acharya Virasena also concur with this relationship between the Vira Nirvana and the Saka-kala. This has been expressed as follows:  
  
पंच य मासा पंच य वास छच्चेव होन्ति वाससया\|  
परिणिव्वुअस्स अरिहितो तो उप्पन्नो सगो राया\|\|
