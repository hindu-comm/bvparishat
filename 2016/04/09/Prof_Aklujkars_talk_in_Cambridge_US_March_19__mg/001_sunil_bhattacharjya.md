Friends,  
  

Prof Aklujkar rightly opines that the date of Ashoka Maurya, as is presently accepted, is questionable. .Late Mr. Sethna made some valiant attempts to correct the dates of ancient Indian History, but he too created fresh controversies by pushing back the date of Lord Mahavira by more than a millennium (even though it is firmly established in the 6th century BCE.by the Jaina texts) as well as pushing back the dates of Antiochus etc. against what is firmly established by the ancient western materials.  
  

To my mind the ancient Indian chronolgoy is doubly important as it will help challenge some of the absurd views of the western intelligentsia on the ancient Sanskrit texts too.  
  

May be, we should create a separate thread to discuss the ancient Indian chronology.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil Bhattacharjya.
