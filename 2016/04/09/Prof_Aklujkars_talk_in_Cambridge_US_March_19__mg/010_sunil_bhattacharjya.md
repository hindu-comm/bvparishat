Dear friends,  

There was the following uery from shri Nityanand Mishraji,

Quote

Can you please share the exact verses/passages in Jinasena's work which give the above year? I think the relation with the Saka Era of 605 years and 5 months is given rather by the Arya cited below. Does Harivamsa of Jinasena also contain a similar verse?

> 3)  
> Thirdly, "Titthogali Painnaya" and "Dhavalaa" of Acharya Virasena also > concur with this relationship between the Vira Nirvana and the > Saka-kala. This has been expressed as follows:  
> पंच य मासा पंच य वास छच्चेव होन्ति वाससया\|  
> परिणिव्वुअस्स अरिहितो तो उप्पन्नो सगो राया\|\|

> Where is this verse in the above works?

In reply I would refer you to the views expressed by the famous historian late Prof. Dineschandra Sircar. In page 321 of his Book “Indian Epigraphy”, Prof. Sircar writes on the Jaina Nirvana Era as follows :

A reckoning from the date of nirvāna or salvation of the last Jain Tirthaṅkara, Vardhamāna Mahāvīra (or Vīra), is prevalent among the Jains and is called the Jina Kāla or Vīra-nirvāna-samvat

  
  

The *Vicāraśrenī* (c. 1310A.D.) of the Svetāmbara author Merutunga gives the difference between the Vīra-nirvāna and Vikrama eras as 470 years while another Svetāmbara writer named Nemicandra, disciple of Ambadeva and author of the Prakrit poem entitled *Mahāvīracaritam* (1084 A.D.), quotes 605 years and 5 months as the intervening period between Mahāvīra's Nirvāna and \[the beginning of the rule of\] the śaka king, i.e. the beginning of the śaka era is given also the Digambara works like Nemicandra's *Trilokasāra* (11^(th) century A.D.) as well as in the ***Harivamsa Purāna*** and Meghanandin's Srāvakācāra. But there are discrepancies in the traditional dates of Mahāvira.

Again in page 322 of the same book Prof. Sircar wrote as follows:

Some scholars have accepted the Svetāmbara tradition giving the difference between the Vīra-nirvāna era on the one hand and the Vikrama and śaka eras on the otheras 470 years and 605 (years) and 5 months respectively and suggesting the beginnng of the era in 527or 528 BC. But this is untenable since, aas now accepted by most historians, Mahāvira, who was a contemporary of the Buddha, must have died in the first half of the 5^(th) century B.C. In support of his this assumption Prof. Sircar refers to the Max Mullerian chronology given in the following :

\[the *Camb.Hist.Ind*.,Vol. 1, p. 696, the probable period of Mahavira is given as 540 – 468 B.C.\]

  

As you can see that Prof Sircar mentioned the Harivamsha purana but had not quoted any paragraph from that book. From what he said above there is no doubt that Lord Mahavira left this world in 527 BCE. In case we have any jain scholar in the BVP he may kindly help us with the paragraph where Jinasena supports the 527 BCE as the year of Lord Mahavira's Nirvana.

Regards,
