Dear Sunil Bhattacharjya Ji

  

Can you please share the exact verses/passages in Jinasena's work which give the above year? I think the relation with the Saka Era of 605 years and 5 months is given rather by the Arya cited below. Does Harivamsa of Jinasena also contain a similar verse?

Where is this verse in the above works?

  

Would be better if you can also share details of the editions/translations you may have referred.  

  

Thanks, Nityanand
