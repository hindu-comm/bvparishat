Agni:  
Agni is a "D-देवता" (a term from the other thread), i.e. a composite of a particular set of deities "oriented along" one of its constituents- सूर्य देव.  
  
So in the worship of Agni, सूर्य is the ultimate/ इष्ट देवता, also there are some other "intermediate stage deities" (as in a cumulative sum) involved, namely:  
1. physical fire. Photon. धातृ । matter. material world. भग देवता ।  
2. जातवेदस् । कुमारौ ।  
  
Dynamics:  
  
Worship of composite deities (ब्रह्मा, विष्णु, शिव, दुर्गा, गणेश, इत्यादि) is particularly helpful for -  
a) lay persons who don't have the time/ energy to go into pointed sAdhanA,  
and b) those who are into the integrating phase of their evolution.  
  
A proper worship (or a shrine), therefore, should consist of-  
Only one (or none) composite deity, plus any number (including none) of non-composite deities.  
  
(Note: विष्णु is a composite, but his avatAra-s, e.g. Ram Krishna etc, are non-composites)  
  
  
Who imagined the Devata-s?  
The Rsis discovered them (as axioms). For example, अङ्गिरस् discovered ब्रह्मन्.  
  
So many Devatas:  
Only a few are fundamental, the rest are their -  
a) differential manifestations  
b) epithets  
  
Why क:  
Originally it was for ब्रह्मन्, since ब्रह्मन्, the one without an attribute, was supposed to be "not spoken of" (since the name itself is an attribute) in the ancient Vedic tradition.  
  
Brihaddevata of Shaunaka:  
It recollects the fragmented folk memories of Veda's anthropological dimension. In terms of thought, Brihaddevata is far more closer to us than to the Vedic people.  
  
Myths:  
These are the vague records of things that people can no longer relate to as real. More often than not these myths tell us about the very chain of incidents that caused the loss of those reals.  
  
Adhibhautika, adhidaivika, adhyatmika:  
This classification is not useful.
