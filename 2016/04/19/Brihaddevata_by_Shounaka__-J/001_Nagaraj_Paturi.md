\> Thank you Dr. V. sundersen and Dr. N. Paturi. I was not referring to mantra and Devata for Brahmajnaana. That is different.

  

------- If these sentences are connected to each other and that means that I said/understood that you referred to mantra and Devata for Brahmajnaana , let me clarify, I did not say /understand that you referred to mantra and Devata for Brahmajnaana.

  

Let me also clarify, for whatever it is worth, that I did not mention anywhere, even in the thread on polytheism related discussion that

" that everything came from Brahman/Aatman." .

  

" that everything came from Brahman/Aatman." was not said by anyone in that thread. In that thread, no one made any attempt defend his religion against other religions.

  

With these, I leave the post here, to make way for the intended discussion to continue as intended.
