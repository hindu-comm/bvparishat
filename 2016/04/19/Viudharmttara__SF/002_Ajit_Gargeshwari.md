Vishnu Dharmottara Mahapuranam Venkateswara Steam Press 1929 Pothi Edition is available at DLI the same was reprinted by Nag Publishers. There is one more complete Pothi edition at DLI but the publishers name is unknown If you are un able to download it yourself please inform me by a private mail.



It would be good Sahaji adds his name in the signature column or let his name known in English. Not all know telegu.
