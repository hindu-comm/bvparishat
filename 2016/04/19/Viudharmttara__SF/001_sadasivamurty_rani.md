Dear Saha!

Vishnudharmottara Purana in two parts is available with Nag Publishers. Please contact them. Nearly 15years ago I bought nearly 11 Puranas from Sri Lal Bahadur Sastri Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, New Delhi at an unimaginable low price. Most of them were published by NAG Publishers, New Delhi.

Hope this information will be useful to you.

Does anyone have any idea where I can find the entire Sanskrit text of the Viṣṇudharmōttara Purāṇa? I can only find what looks like a translation of the citrakalā section.

Thanks in advance.
