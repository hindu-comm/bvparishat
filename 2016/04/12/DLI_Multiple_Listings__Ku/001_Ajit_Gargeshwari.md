DLI website in terms of user experience is a nightmare. One will never know till one downloads. Sometimes there are identical scans sometimes they are different scans of the same book. I usually check the file size or number of pages. Many a times you get different scans of the same book or different editions with different spellings. Of one simply types cltlftr at times one gets a rare Sanskrit books. We had a thread to get DLI data re indexed but looks like no one is interested. I cannot do it by myself. I had offered my services but it appears that no one wants to help.
