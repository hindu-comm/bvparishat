I am pasting this post from another list in response to this article by **Dr. Jeffery D. Long Professor of Religion and Asian Studies Elizabethtown College Elizabethtown:**

  

**Are there any possible circumstances under which Hindus might advocate for a fair and accurate representation of Hinduism, one which reflects Hindu sensibilities, without being characterized as or lumped in with Hindu nationalism? Is every Islamic, Jewish, or Christian advocacy group characterized as representing jihadism, zionism, or fundamentalism? Another disappointing article from the mainstream media.
