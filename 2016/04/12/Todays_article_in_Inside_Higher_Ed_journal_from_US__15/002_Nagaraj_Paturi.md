To that post, the response of Phillip Goldberg, the author of American Veda, is as follows:

  



I had the same feeling, Jeffery (although Inside Higher Ed is not exactly “mainstream media”). Not only does the author link all critiques with Hindu nationalism but she makes other egregious generalizations, like “The distrust and even disdain with which many practicing Hindus view the scholars who study their religion” in the very first sentence.
A good journalist would at least use the word “some” instead of “the,” since the objections are aimed at a few scholars, not all of them.
