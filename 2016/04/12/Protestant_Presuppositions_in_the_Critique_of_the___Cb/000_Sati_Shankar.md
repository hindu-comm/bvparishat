mAnyavar,

  

Found an article, may be of your interest. It says,

  

"The claim that Hinduism is not a religion, or not a single religion, is so often

repeated that it might be considered an axiom of research into the religious beliefs

and practices of the Hindus, were it not typically ignored immediately after having

been stated. The arguments for this claim in the work of several representative

scholars are examined in order to show that they depend, implicitly or explicitly,

upon a notion of religion which is too much influenced by Christian conceptions of

what a religion is, a conception which, if it has not already been discarded by

scholars of religion, certainly ought to be. Even where such Christian models are

explicitly disavowed, the claim that Hinduism is not a religion can be shown to

depend upon a particular religious conception of the nature of the world and our

possible knowledge of it, which scholars of religion cannot share......"

  

best wishes
