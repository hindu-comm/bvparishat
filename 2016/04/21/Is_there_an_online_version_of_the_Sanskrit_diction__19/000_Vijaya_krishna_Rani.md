namo vAkAH,

  

There was a Times of India article (back in 2014) which claimed that the published parts of the Sanskrit dictionary from the Deccan college will be available online. Here is the news article:

I couldn't find any information of its availability online. Do you have any idea on this. Also, any information on the progress of the Deccan College dictionary (and its digitization efforts) is appreciated.
