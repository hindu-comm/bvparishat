1\. First of all I apologize that since I am traveling and without my laptop I have issues with transliteration. You said:  
'निस्स्वरूपत्वं हि तुच्छत्वम् इतिनिरूपिते सति अतुच्छानां सर्व्वेषां स्वरूपवत्त्वं सादृश्यं सिद्ध्यत्येव । पदार्था हि सर्व्वे तुच्छभिन्ना इति तुच्छभिन्नत्वमेव तेषां सादृश्यम् ।  
तुच्छस्तु न तार्किकनये पदार्थो , ज्ञानाविषयत्वात् । अन्ये सर्व्वे ज्ञानविषया इत्यपि तेषां सादृश्यम् ।'  
I may misformulate your argument here. I thought that since I had asked for the sense in which both bhAva and abhAva padArthas are svarUpavAn, you are trying to argue that since tuccha is both jnAnAvishay and and niHsvarUpa, jnAnavishayattva is the svarUpa of padartha-s.  
'मन्मते स्वरूपवत्त्वं(स्वरूपं) तत्तद्व्यक्तित्वं वा जातिर्वा सम्भवति । तुच्छस्य तदुभयं नास्ति ।'  
If I am not wrong this time, you said that svarUpam in the sense of tadvyaktittva or jAti may be the similarity of padArthas. Kindly explain how sAmAnya, visheSha, samavAya and abhAva have this? I think sattA jAti holds the key here.  
'jadyapi eShA sAmAnyAdiyyo vyAvartate tathApi na tevya svAshrayam vyavartyitum shaknoti. TeSham api svarUpasatta sambuddhi samvedyatvat. Vastu apekShayA ca anuvrittihetuttvam vivakShitam, tena abhAvAt vyAvrittihetuttve api na doShah ' (NyAyakandali)

\>\> since tuccha is jnana-avisaya. Actually it is Prabhakaras who argue that satta jati is nothing but vastusvarupa or vastusvabhava which is pramanagamya and that is why tuccha is avastu.  
\> Your expression is not conveying anything clearly.  
\> It appears that you want to tell that tuccha is avastu because prAbhAkara argue something about sattA jAti!!?? You need to fill the between those two ideas. hetu(cause) must be in paxa to prove sAdhya in the same.

2\. It is a PrAbhAkara argument that svarUpavattva of seven padArthas is jnAnaviShyattva, since tuccha is jnanAviShaya. I had written it in the first line of my earlier post. Yes PrAbhAkara argue that sattA jAti is nothing but vastusvarUpa and tuccha is svarUpashunya, that is why tuccha is sattAshunya. This vastusvarUpa or sattA is pramANagamya. So there is a connection between tuccha being avastu and PrAbhAkara argument about sattA jAti. See prakaranapancikA and NyAyakandali. I am not so novice that I do not know the structure of an anumAna. I thought you can decipher the hidden premise.

\>\> But Nyāya must maintain that vastusvarupa is not conditioned in being jnanagamya.

\> What do you mean by 'not conditioned' ?

3\. Hope it is clear by now.

\>\> Padarthas which are already svarupasat can only be jnana-visaya.

\> OK. But, what is the laxaNA of svarUprasat which is different from sattA jAti? You need to produce from nyAya texts.  
\> What do you mean by 'already svarUpasat'?  
\> What do you mean by 'only be jnAnaviShaya'? Do you think that they can't posses any other quality? Do you think that sattAjAti can't become jnAnaviShaya?

4\. Please see NyAyakandali and sukti of Jagadish. There are, no doubt, some confusions regarding the nature of svarUpasattA. I think it may well be astitva, existence. There are some gray areas regarding the relation between sattA jAti and svarUpasattA. What I found that sattA jAti as svarUpasattA is the cause of anugatAkAra jnAna in all bhAva padArthas but in dravya, guna and karma sattA jAti is the natural property while in sAmAnya, VisheSha and samavAya it is an upAdhi. I think sattA jAti may well be an upAdhi of abhAva as well.
