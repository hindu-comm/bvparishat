Naiyayikas have a limited eyesight so they have kept bandhyaputra like concepts outside the purview of ‘existence’. Whereas vaiyakaranas specially give them the status of aupacarika satta vis-a-vis subsistence. Yogasutra talks about sabdanupatijnana very much close to linguistic existence. When someone abuses me saying ‘you are a liar ’ i feel hurt though i know that it is not true. Unless i understand the meaning of the utterence i would not have felt hurt. So bandhyaputra must have existence/subsistence in a wider sense.  
By introducing the condition of yogyata naiyayika robs off the tag of validity from the statement bandjyaputra etc.  
One has to take into account the ontology of every system that fixes the destiny of concerned epistemology.  
It is like saying Hospitality is good but how long and for how many? Once one crosses the boundary there is no limit.
