Yes, it was the case, you got wrong meaning.

There is no problem in there case, because they all have tadvyaktitva.

The jAti may be treated as svarUpa, when it is present; as in cow.

The idea is that any dharma which is asAdhAraNa to dharmI, is it's svarUpa.

This may be a desired solution. I've no problem with it.

I understand that you said this because you got wrong meaning of my message. So, it's irrelevant for me. That's why I asked about it's use in last mail.

Anyway, it is good for comparison.

I've not checked both works. - This is for those who are following my mails to know correct stand point of prAbhAkara-s.

No, because it's base was faulty comprehension of my sentence, in a way बलादापाद्य दूषणम् and unnecessary.

I think sattA jAti may well be an upAdhi of abhAva as well.

It is good that you presented your present understanding of the matter.

That may/may not be related to my original post, and may/may not address problems I posed with the idea and way to convey it.

But, that is not needed now. Since, it was based on an unnecessary extension of the discussion.

  

For discussion on sattA jAti and to compare it with svarUpasattA, you may create a new thread and present your understanding.

Interested people may go through works and put their ideas there.

It is an interesting topic.
