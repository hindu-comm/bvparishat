I don't think it is true. vAkyapadIya, etc. just say that even for alIka shAbdavRRitti is possible. They are mute on it's existence.

Wow ! A new division of existence. Never heard of it.

There sUtra doesn't say that there is any such thing. It talks about laxaNa of vikalpa, It doesn't even talk about alIka.

You are hurt because they are presenting your wrong image, not because both false-statement and you



don't exist. It mostly a case of superimposition of undesired qualities, it's not a case of vikalpavRRitti.

> So bandhyaputra must have existence/subsistence in a wider sense.  

No.

I don't understand why you are thrashing naiyAyika-s. They are following there own sUtra-s and the philosophical school based on that.

If they are not understanding other's point of view, I think it is true for you too since you are tagging them with special adjactives.
