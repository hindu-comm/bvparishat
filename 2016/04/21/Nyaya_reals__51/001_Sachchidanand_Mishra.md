Dear Tamoghna Sarkar,

An अभाव is endowed with so many properties. Take for example the absence of pot, in this absence there are properties abhidheyatva, jñeyatva, abhāvatva, ghatatvāvacchinnapratiyogitākatva etc. Some of these properties are sakhandopādhi and others are akhandopādhi. Therefore, here an अभाव is becoming substratum of these properties. When this अभाव is qualifying the ground this absence is becoming a property of the ground. If abhāva were devoid of svarūpa, it could neither become a substratum nor a property. अलीक is not a padārtha because it is devoid of svarūpa; it has no property and cannot become a property of something else. This is the basic difference between an absence and an alīka.

Hope I could make the point clear.
