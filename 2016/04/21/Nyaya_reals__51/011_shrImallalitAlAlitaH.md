I don't think that I said anything like that which you are negating.

We separately mentioned that svarUpam and GYAnaviShyatvam are similarity of padArtha-s.

Your expression is not conveying anything clearly.

It appears that you want to tell that tuccha is avastu because prAbhAkara argue something about sattA jAti!!?? You need to fill the between those two ideas. hetu(cause) must be in paxa to prove sAdhya in the same.

What do you mean by 'not conditioned' ?

> Padarthas which are already svarupasat can only be jnana-visaya.

OK. But, what is the laxaNA of svarUprasat which is different from sattA jAti? You need to produce from nyAya texts.

What do you mean by 'already svarUpasat'?

What do you mean by 'only be jnAnaviShaya'? Do you think that they can't posses any other quality? Do you think that sattAjAti can't become jnAnaviShaya?
