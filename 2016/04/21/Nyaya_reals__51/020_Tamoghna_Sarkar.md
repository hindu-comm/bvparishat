In Nyāya, alīka or tuccha is a non-entity as it can not be the content of any pramān̟a. Śaśaśṛnga, i.e, horn delimited by hareness, is not the content of any valid means of cognition. There is a definite cognition of the absence of horn in a Hare and this nisćaya acts as the deterrent to generate any cogntion from the expression ‘a horn delimited by Hareness’. Those ignorant persons who do not have the definite cognition of the absence of horn in a Hare may only have an erroneous cognition of the horn in a hare, since apramā is a cognition of a relation which is actually not there. That is why, when we have the cognition ‘There is no horn delimited by hareness’ it means that there is no actual relation between a hare and a horn (śaśe śṛngābhāva). Just because ‘horn delimited by hareness’ is alīka and we do not have any valid cognition of it, there can not be any cognition of ‘the absence of horn delimited by hareness’ as well. Only those who accept vyādhikaran̟dharmāvacchinna abhāva can uphold the thesis of the absence of alīka. But, Nyāya in general does not accept this type of absence. Udayana in his Nyāyakusumānjali famously says that if we have an erroneous cognition of Śaśaśṛnga, it is due to the presence of defects in the causal set of perception and if there is non-apprehension of Śaśaśṛnga we must admit that there is no defective causal set of perception.
