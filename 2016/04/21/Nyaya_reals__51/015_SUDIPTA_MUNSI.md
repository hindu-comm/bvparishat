Another interesting thing that Mm. Manudeva Bhattacharya brought to my notice with regard to a specific example of alika (viz. “Bandhyaputra” or ‘the son of a barren woman’) is the following –

If a son is adopted by a barren woman, then according to Dharmasastra rules she becomes a mother, but according to the medical sciences such a son is fit to be called a “bandhyaputra” or the ‘son of a barren woman’. Then the question arises as to whether such an alika thing as a bandhyaputra does not exist at all or a separate grade of existence (may be a linguistic or ideational one?) is to be hypothecated with regard to them.
