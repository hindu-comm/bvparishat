Namaste



Keeping brief:



1. Thanks for the ‘ observation on length of response mails’.



2. ‘Veda vihita Karmas (= Upakarma) have a core and cultural –local wrap. The cultural wrap can be at variance to achieve the intention of ‘ Core’. Even the ‘Samkalpa’ elaboration has the cultural wrap along with religious, philosophical overtones ! And for practical purposes, the ‘ prasadam’ variation is an interesting study ! The only explanation is ‘ we do like this, because, they used to do like this’.



3. On ‘Review and revision’ and slippery slope’ - ‘ anAyAsa ( Comfort of operation to avoid extreme inconvenience or public bad) ’
is not the same as ‘ Alasya ( convenience of lethargy). anAyAsa is welcome; Aalasya needs careful review.



4. On upAkarma as an annual audit, may be I have drawn from Brahmakarma samucchaya : Local variation here, which refers to ‘Samvatsara Kruta dosha Prayaschittartham’ …’ adheetaanaam Chandasaam saveeryatvaya..’.
IF the clothe is daily washed, there is no need for an annual dry-wash.
Other wise…. 



The purpose of ‘ Aghamarshana’ and ‘Virajaa Homa as a part of upAkarma (seen lately) – is an interesting ‘ Prayoga issue for review’.
