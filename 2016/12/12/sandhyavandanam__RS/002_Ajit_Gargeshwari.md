Those who perform the samskara of Upanayana Sandhyavandana is performed. The procedure or mantras might vary slightly depending on the Veda one follows. I don't know about any vaishnavaite shaivaite or Sakata Sandhyavandana  
  
If by shavaites you mean those who don't have the tradition of upanayana may not perform sandhyavandana.  
  

There is enough information available on the web about Sandhyavandana
