Namaste



On \< It is news to me that virajaa homa is being used by some in upaakarma prayoga-s now . **Could you elaborate** \> : 



***Specific Response***:



a) I have stated what I have seen / seeing in the period (1990 onwards – in and around Bengaluru) as the ‘practical of upaakarma’ with
the use of ‘ Virajaa Homa mantras’, coming as a part of ‘ Mahanarayana upanishat ‘ used as ‘ paahi trayodasha…’ - aajyaahti in the saamoohika upaakarmas.



 Is it a mix up of Rik and Yajus – prayoga methods ? a mix up of different books of different periods ? Different schools of teaching ? – I have no answer. 



 Suffice it to say : There is no Generic rule, standard and Convention of Upaakarma practice, beyond the ‘ event –observation points of : Going to temple / place of performance, observing a dress code and facial marks, Do the ‘Group Worship of (Sapta- Gotra) Rishis invoked in the darbha grass’, Give ‘ ready made yajnopavitam to a few people around, Wear the new yajnopavita, Take Prasadam’ ; and if possible do a ‘Tarpanam’. The ‘ Brahma Karma, Deva-Rishi Tarpana’ almost becomes a meaningless group act and a drill of left-right shifting of the sacred thread tangled to the thumb or otherwise !



b) The use of ‘virajaa’ mantras may have been prescribed for ‘some other prayoga’, and might have been carried over as an ‘osmosis phenomenon’ by the ‘ Acharya – Purohita’ to the upaakarma prayoga. Mahanarayana upanishat is one of the common veda-portion learnt across the three –acharya schools; and ‘ common knowledge text of vedas’, along with ‘ mantra-pushpam’. It could be a ‘ social community connection establishment model’.



The ‘ practical performance, as it comes over a year and in a ‘crowd –crowded event’ does not subject itself to any systematic study by a control model study. One would notice these changes only over few decades of observation and with a fair comparative acquaintance of ‘Vaidika Brahmana Prayogas(Design and implementation) in the inner circles’ with a keen sense for details, comparison on how it was done in the past, and a compulsive ‘itch’ for ‘ ‘backward compatibility of traditional practices anchored to some source books, at least some hundred years old (?!) where author cannot be traced or questioned’.



***Elaborating ( as your pointed question is involved with several issues)***:



a) The ‘prayoga modifications’ of ‘Vaidika Samskara Vidhi’ is currently carried out at the ‘ discretion of the lead Community Ceremony conductors of ‘Vedic religious rituals ( In-House or at Temples’). Logical reasoning or sanctions is not known. The only answer , in pure personal conversations’ for such modifications is ‘ My Guru Told, My hand scribed book is like this… , My teacher taught me like this…..’.




Mathams have no interest in interfering to this area and ruffle feathers of intra-community supporters. Ashrams and Missions keep priority on Spirituality and Social Service, relegating the ‘ Priest’ to background as a ‘ link to the inner sanctorum of temple to do worship’. The ‘ guru-kuls are burdened with lack of resources and luke warm community support. So Gurukuls are orienting themselves as ‘ outsourcing contract suppliers of vedic religion services to the believers’. And ‘ Universities’ are scuba seat divers in this subject, who do not want their ‘skin and fingers get wet with the practice challenges’. So, where is the ‘Guru delivering Vedic Education and Training a Professional fit for Practice ? And a licensing institution (Snaataka –Shikshana Samsthaa) for practice ?



b) Audit of ‘ Prayoga books’ published in any regional language with the name of ‘lead Community Ceremony conductors of ‘Vedic religious rituals ( In-House or at Temples’) as ‘ authority’ are either poorly proofed reprints with ‘ unspecified edits’ and ‘ no reference to source works’ and ‘Samskruth Language check’. There are exceptions of course, as in any case. Like, One good apple in a basket of unspecified number of rotten apples. The ‘ Granthi – Knot -divide of ‘ Sanskrit –Tamil-Grantham’ is too strong to bridge !



c) The ‘ upaakarma’ practice in the largesse of State, is another messy scenario : What one would see is ‘Veda- Abhyasa/ prayoga’
flavored by ‘ matha specific Vedantacharyavarya’ –localized versions.




 Did Veda –Samskaras exist prior to Vedantacharayas ? Did Vedantacharyavaryas recommend any change in the ‘Vaidika Samskara prayogas / Sandhyavandanam ? OR provide any Vedanta overrides on Dharma-Shaastra prayogas ? – would be an interesting exploration of academic research on ‘Dynamics of Vaidika Samskaras’.



 Some of these are topics of exploration proposed for research with a community interest, at Yoga-Samskrutham University. Also, there seems to be no evidence to anchor and engage studies with ‘ validating people or manuscript or rock edicts’ to decode here ! beyond ‘ Gruhya and Shrauta Sutras’, possibly Dharma Shaastra works. What seems to be left of ‘Veda-Abhyasa /Prayoga’, even inside the core Brahminical institutions, is a highly, dynamically, diluted, Vedanta flavored (- A-Karma /Vi-Karma) models of ‘ Purana –aagama –Tantra’ cultural outfits, with atleast a three centuries backlog to be cleared ?



 And this is what is showcased and studied as ‘ Hinduism /Religion in India’. There seems to be no takers, doers, guides and ‘ Funders’ for education investigation and implementation on these fundas!

 Despite \< Battle: Sanskrit War cries>.



d) Going India nationwide, the problem is much more complex ! and Going International, the challenge seems to be of Himalayan magnitude.



 Should then the issue be left unanswered ?The options to explore are : ‘Academic curios engagement ’ OR ‘ Address Identity –Practice needs of community in a current Society’ ?

 Should this issue be answered by ‘ World Religion-Research Team’ as a ‘Faith Community practices of an ancient period by a miniscule community who desire backward text-practice continuity and compliance’ OR 

 As a ‘ Intra Community Crisis in streamlining the Practice? - OR left best for some future ‘ Dharmacharya varya’ ? 

 I don’t have an answer, beyond the pious expression : ‘ I look for some guidance and answer here, for personal solace’ with a lingering question:

 Is there a need to deliberate for a Universal Global Standard Practice of ‘Veda’ ? What was ‘ Viswamitra Gayatri Mantra’ motivation as a ‘ Universal Vedic Practice, across all Varnas and Vedas’

 OR

 one should stay content with the guidance ‘ Anu-Shaasanam’: The personalized guidance for Self’ ? ‘ Atma-Kalyanam as priority and preference over Loka-Sangraha /Vishwa-Mangalam’ ? .
