Dear Sri Abhijitji,

  

From your question, I get an impression that you are interested in knowing the procedure of sandhyāvandanam for you to follow.

  

If I am right, can you provide me more details about the specific Shaivaite sect of which you would like to know the procedure of sandhyāvandanam?

  

Virashaiva people who have iṣṭalingadhāraṇa do not consider sandhyāvandanam as important as iṣṭalingārchana.

  

Shiva advaita followers perform sandhyāvandanam as per the smārtapaddhati only.

  

ārādhyaśaiva Brahmins too perform sandhyāvandanam .

  

If you can provide more background , it may be helpful to help you with more pointers.

  

Best,
