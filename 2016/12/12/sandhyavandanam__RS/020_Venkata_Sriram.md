Dear Sastry Ji,

  

On upAkarma day, we doकामोऽकार्षीत् मन्युरकार्षीत् mantra japam. The next day, which happens to beगायत्री प्रतिपद्,, we do sahasra gAyatri japa. However, one should perform gAyatri havan with 1000 Ahutis but owing to time constraints and official pressures, I do sahasra gAyatri japa as a pratyAmnAya.

  

I never heard of virajA hOma on upAkarma. This is done prior to taking sanyAsa.

  

regs,

sriram
