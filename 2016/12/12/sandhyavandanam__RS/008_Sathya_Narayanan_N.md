Hi abhijit,

  

Yes. If upanayana samskaara isperformed. Tri Kaala Sandhyavandana is must.

  

For example, Saivites in Tamilnadu and around perform it.

Dikshitaars of Chidambaram or Shivacharyaas perform it.

  

The procedure varies across Vedas/ Desha/Sutra/ Darshana. Also sometimes based on the guru.

You have to be specific when you ask for the procedure.

  

regards,

Sathya
