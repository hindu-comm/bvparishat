I presume Dr.BVKShastry has *a lot more* to say:

for, his post begins with "1.", \[just\] the first point, that is.

  

Either he has forgotten to set forth the next points - "2.", "3." etc.,

or, what is more likely,

they are going to come in his future message(s),

perhaps in instalments.

  

Well, some people adore freedom of expression,

while some people admire conciseness and preciseness.

  

Is it right, or has anybody the right,

to call either wrong?
