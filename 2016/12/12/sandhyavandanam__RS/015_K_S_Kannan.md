As in *kāvya*, so in *loka*

*(*or is it vice versa?*):*

prolixity is not always a demerit,

nor conciseness a constant merit.

*Guṇa*-s can become *doṣa*-s,

and *doṣa*-s,*guṇa*-s.

  

We can rather go by the dicta of Mammaṭa and Vyāsa -

M (definition of doṣa) : ***mukhyārtha-hatir doṣaḥ***.

V : ***iṣṭam hi viduṣām loke samāsa-vyāsa-dhāraṇam.***

***  
***

Little to dispute if the above norms are grasped in their right spirit and well assimilated

\- by writers as well as readers;

and despite Bhāmaha (*dhī-khedāyaiva vistaraḥ*)

and Shakespeare ("Brevity is the soul of wit").

(Hope this is no expatiation upon the merits of concision!)
