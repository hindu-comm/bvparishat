Namaste



On **Précising and restricting the response**:



A) If questions can be straight simple, simplified responses can be attempted.



 Prof. KSK wrote \< Well, some people adore freedom of expression, while some people admire conciseness and preciseness. Is it right, or has anybody the right,to call either wrong? > 



 It all depends on whether one is looking to satisfy their ‘ Question-Hunger’ for a ‘quick snack like quick reading’ Or a ‘ Full Five course Menu for a leisurely enjoyment of food delicacy’.
‘Band-aid’ model answers may not be sufficient to address Battle: Sanskrit scenario missiles in the form of ‘ innocent-questions’. When complex question needs a group mode response, the precision of expression gets compromised to keep the communication flowing, easy and comprehensible in ‘ current idiom’ yet reflect the textual precise position. It is an option for readers to choose how they desire to engage with such responses. The ‘ three word –one liner Starting question in Brahma Sutra (1-1-1) ’ has been incessantly, intensely debated for pros, cons, compromises, condemnations over three plus millennia ! in volumes of writings and by brilliant minds of tradition. And 1800 lines of Gita- narrative dialogue’ is used as an ‘ equal opportunity -equally convincing ’ authoritative exposition of this one liner. 



A) On **Summarizing as briefly as possible the thread discussion**:



The Primary question on Dec 12, 2016 - Abhijit Todkar reads: - Do shaivaites perform sandhyavandanam?If yes does anyone have the procedure and the mantras?



The summary response is : यदि शैवाः (१) वेदः शिवो, शिवो वेदः, इति मन्यन्ते( २) वेदादेशः शिवाज्ञा इति मन्यन्ते, तदा वेदोक्त सन्ध्यावन्दनं तेषां विहितमेव \|\| सन्ध्यावन्दन-अनुष्ठान-प्रकारः स्व-गुरुमुखेन ज्ञातव्यः, स्व कुल -संप्रदायः ज्ञातव्यः इति दिक् \| 



This is the sanskrit version of my first response which read \<Summing up, the response: IF \< Shaivites> accept and hold to the statement that ‘ Vedas are the very embodiment of Shiva’ ( Vedah Shivah – Shivo
Vedah), then better they learn to perform ‘Sandhya-Vandanam’ to keep their own Vedic Varna Identity.>



B) The legacy of expanded answer to the primary question goes back to : December 12, 2016 ripping open the response scope to \< - Those who perform the samskara of Upanayana Sandhyavandana is performed. The procedure or mantras might vary slightly depending on the Veda one follows. I don't know about any vaishnavaite shaivaite or Sakata Sandhyavandana. If by shavaites you mean those who don't have the tradition of upanayana may not perform sandhyavandana. There is enough information available on the web about Sandhyavandana. And Sivasenani’s follow up \< on BVK Sastry's post : \< I wonder if you have any pointers in Saastra which led you to conclude as above or other positions arrived at; or is it a holistic analysis and a view on what ought to be? \>
