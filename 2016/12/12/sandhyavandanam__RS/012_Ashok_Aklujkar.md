I too would like to stress this one more time.  
  
Idiosyncratic or popular (newspaper-like) transliterations should also be avoided as far as possible. The system established since the International Congress of Orientalists in 1872 (as far as I know) may not be perfect, but it is important to stick to it especially if computer-searching of words is to be made more efficient.
