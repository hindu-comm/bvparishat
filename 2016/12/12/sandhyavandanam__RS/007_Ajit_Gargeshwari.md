Dear Prof. Shastri,

It would be useful if you can sum up you points and post. Please restrict you post to five to six sentences maximum per post. You can always quote articles and books to substantiate you views. Please post in a manner which is comprehensible to all for quick reading. I could not understand most of what you said. Sorry I am with limited intellectual capacity may be others have grasped the entire contents.

Thanks
