Namaste



The question is a mix up and messy understanding between ‘Veda –Guidance for ‘Spiritual / Yoga routines’ as ‘Brahma / Brahmana – Karma ( - A consequent commitment of a Samskara) ’ **and **\< Faith-Community practices / Sampradayas, to show a social belongingness by practice - appearences \> .





**A. On \< Do shaivaites perform sandhyavandanam? \> **

****

1. \< Some Shaivites, who consider themselves as ‘ Orthodox Veerashaiva Brahmanas and Vedadyayi’s do perform ‘Vedic Sandhyavandanam’ with a flavor of ‘Shiva Devotion’ and imagery association; similar to the Vaishnavites who do perform Sandhyavandanam with a ‘Narayana –Devotion and imagery association’. So does the \<Shaakta’s ; Gaanapatyas and Sauras !.



2. Veda Guidance is for ‘Varna’ status person and is a prescribed practice injunction ( = Vihita Karma) . Vedas have nothing to offer as flavors and variations of ‘Sandhya-Vandanam’ by faith-God- Guru flavors.




What if a Varna person violates this guidance ? ( vihita-karma - akaraNe PratyavAyah).



Vedas are not going to punish a violator like a ‘ God/ Goddess (Devataa) who would curse ( = Shaapa /Aprasaada) the individual who is misdoing’ and ‘ reduce the benefit due to displeasure’. 



Nor Vedas would grant a special ‘boon (vara) for a regular performer of Sandhya.



Why then should one be a stickler to this practice ?



The answer is to ‘ Keep a daily Spiritual Fitness for Upliftment =
‘Yogayataa- rakshana’ for ‘Adhyatma Jnana –Nityatvam’.



Why flavor Vedic Sandhyavandana practices with faith-colorations ?
There is a ‘Taste’ difference in eating Plain rice for sustenance and the ‘Vegetable fried rice’ for taste ! Wearing a plain white saree is different from wearing a design printed saree. The cloth and the design printed are not easy to separate.



3. ‘ Sandhya-Vandanam’ is technically a plurality of ‘Yoga- practices, a bundled sequenced Yogas. It is guarded by the practices of the Highest of the Varna Category’ and with the ultimate goal set as ‘ Parameswara Preetyartham / ‘Dhee –prachodanaa / Brahma –Medha Siddhi’.



These words are loaded with a plurality of meaning and defy any simple translation. 



Sandhyavandanam is unlike any other ‘ Ishta- Kamya Samkalpa’ = Speciifc desire seeking and personal want fulfilling activity like a ‘Vrata, yajna, prayaschitta..’. 



4. **Sandhyavandanam , as ‘Yoga’ is an ‘Anu-Shaasanam’ = Custom prescription ( =Shaasanam) in a CONTEXT AFTER a Due deliberation and Examination (= Anu) **( like answering the ‘anubandha chatushtaya’:
Why, Who, When, How, …questions for each seeker). As ‘Custom prescription’, one sees the streamlined prescription of Sandhya –practice system by ‘Veda’ , by ‘Varna – Ashrama ’ and by ‘ Samskara’ -
and several other critical factors.



An analysis of each individual by these checklists , are provided in ‘Dharma-Shaastra’ as a preparation for the ‘ proper initiation to Sandhya-Vandanam’. A total application of these factors explains the diversity of ‘Sandhya vandanam’ practices seen around us. This analysis, when completed, yields the final output on the total structure and scope of Sandhya-Vandanam; giving What mantras are to be used, in what sequence, what form of the deity needs to be worshipped.. et al.



**What is seen in practice of current period, is a serious violation of this ‘Sandhyaa-vandana Anushaasana Paddahti’. This is a result of poor and inadequate identity understanding of ‘Varna –Status’ before administering and authenticating entry to the portal of ‘Vedas’. And of course, bad understanding of the ‘Samskrutham: Language of the documents of Tradition. **



The ‘ praticum of Sandhya-Vandana Samskara and Practice is to be arrived at and understood under the totality of ‘ Gruhya Sutras and Dharma –Shastras’ and analyzing ‘ individual requirements ‘ case by case basis. Sandhya vandanam practice needs an annual audit and update through the review system of ‘ Upaa-karma’ (= Annual Thread Changing program, a time to review and make course correction in ‘Brahma-Karma /Brahmana-Karma Practice). This has ended up as a farcical practice of ‘ New Thread wearing’, not understanding why the old thread was worn in the first instance.



The blind-follow- blind method of following ‘ (Fore/ Grand- ?)-Fathers method (?) of Sandhya-mantras, by son’ needs a serious review! The son /daughters needs through Sandhya-Vandanam are different from the Father/ Mothers needs: Exactly like the Dress and food by Size and Quantity. In this sense, Sandhya-Vandanam is an evolving Practice of Yoga –Guidance and Practice. It is not a freezed system for all years same –from day one to end.



If the ‘Acarya’ fails to make the Parents /Vatu understand and educate on these aspects of ‘Sandhya-vandanam’ as ‘Yoga’; and worst, substitutes it by ‘Simplified Systems of Convenience’ limited to wearing the ‘threads to tie the key and scratch the back’, it will be doing no better than the sharvilakas use of the ‘Brahma Sutra, as a measuring thread to cut open the wall for a thieves entry’. ( Cf. Shudraka’s Mruccha Katika).



5. When Vedas do not provide a ‘Faith based classification’ as ‘Shaivites /Vaishnavites /Gaanaapatyas..’, ; and all the ‘Varnas are given a universal injunction ( aadesha) to perform Sandhya-Vandanam, the right thing is to find out what and how of ‘ putting in to practice’ the injunction.



This aspect is personal fit; and is like the ‘ best fit of an undergarment ( Rahasyam, Gopaneeyam, Guhyam) ’ that suits ones needs, aspirations and comfort. It is not meant for public debate and disclosure.



The diversity of practice does not matter; The conformity to be compliant with Injunction of Vedas is what does matter.



It would be worthwhile as a research topic for some one to investigate what was ‘prescribed practice for a Shudra’ and method –mantras to do Sandhya-Vandanam’ according to Vedas. IF ‘Shudras’ are having ‘Gotras’, how can they be missing a ‘Sandhya-Vandanam’ system ? and be violating
Vedic injunction? The so called ‘Shudras’ who are ‘Fourth Varna’, some of whom could be ‘Rishis’ having a ‘Veda –Darshana’ \<Aitareya Rishi : associated with Aitareya Brahman and Aitareyopanishad (related to Rig-Veda); Ailush Rishi mentioned in (Aitareya Brahman 2.19)> ;
Manu Smriti 10.65 pointing to intra-varna movements (Brahmana can become Shudra and Shudra can become Brahmana; Kshtariyas and Vaishyas can also change their Varnas). Read this with ( 2-104, 2-168, 2-172, 4-245). What happens to Sandhyavandanam in such intra-varna movements ?



And that opens up the question: What is ‘Veda’ in relation to \< Shiva, as understood by the Shaivites’ ! - Would Shiva –Rudra be a Tribal chief wielding ‘ trident, and leading a bandit team’ OR Shiva –Rudra is Supreme Divine. 



**Summing up, the response**: IF \< Shaivites> accept and hold to the statement that ‘ Vedas are the very embodiment of Shiva’ ( Vedah Shivah – Shivo Vedah ), then better they learn to perform ‘Sandhya-Vandanam’ to keep their own Vedic Varna Identity as ‘ Noble Shudras = Arya Shudra’.?!



Same thing applies to Vaishnavites , if they firmly believe that ’Vedas’ are the ‘breath and body’ of ‘ Parama Purusha Mahavishnu’. Shiva is no enemy of Narayana .



**B. On \< If yes does anyone have the procedure and the mantras \>**

The answer is \< YES>; the procedure and the mantras may be sought by the \< Traditional Gurus of Shaivite Schools, guiding the communities.
This would make further sense only if one knows how to separate and see the ‘Core of Vedic Sandhya-vandanam’ and the ‘ Sampradaya Flavors which serve as a Add- on’.
