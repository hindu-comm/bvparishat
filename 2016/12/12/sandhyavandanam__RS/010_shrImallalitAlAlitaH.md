I think that asking one to stay within limit of 5 or 6 sentences is as useless and bad as a post expanding to 10 pages. It will not give you enough space to express properly. Long posts have other problem, which are mentioned later.

  
By the way, I didn't feel any problem in reading and understanding. But, you can't grasp whole picture of thought and flow in such a long post, which makes it useless anyway. Please, note that we don't treat emails as important as a philosophical text in Sanskrit, so it is difficult to dedicate much time to understand it.

  

One more thing,

I was replying to the last mail by k s kannan. I expanded to see how many posts were quoted. I found that Ajit G's post was there, who had quoted shastri's post who had quoted shivasenAnI's post, who had quoted shstri's post....upto original post.

If possible please avoid quoting useless things. Our laziness and Google's habit to hide quoted post (like ... three dots) is culprit here.
