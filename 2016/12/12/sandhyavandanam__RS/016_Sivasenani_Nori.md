Dr. Sastry ji

  

Namaste.

  

Thank you for your response. I would like to submit a counterview regarding length of posts. Many on BVP are academicians; most of the others are voracious readers. So most of the members are used to heavy reading, by profession or reading or both. As such, length of posts would not be a issue for the silent majority - definitely not for yours truly.

  

Coming to the res, if you are referring to the practice in some communities of doing the upAkarma collectively, that is not always the case. Where we live (Serene County, Hyderabad), I usually see the Tamil Brahmins congregate in a place and do it collectively with one priest, whereas the Telugu Brahmins do it at home usually without a priest. Further, if the emphasis is on understanding the spirit of the Vidhi, I have no hesitation in agreeing with you - for tradition is consistent that mere learning of mantras by rote is of no use. There is indeed a case for adding some mantras or some other parAyaNa for particular individuals. This is usually done by Guru, but it is not treated as a part of Sandhyavandanam, which is kept short.

  

However, if by review and revision we talk about introducing new practices, or changing AchAra in the name of progressive practices (example: being half-naked is not "good", therefore we will use normal, clean clothes), I submit that it is a slippery slope. The driver of change with respect to AchAra seems to "avoidance of extreme inconvenience, or public bad", rather than what would

be good, because anAyAsa has the sanction of Gautamasmriti as a necessary perquisite (AtmaguNa) for performing dharma.

  

Finally, even if we say that there is to be areview, there is nothing in the saMkalpa etc. that I recall which makes upAkarma the candidate for that. Anyway, I will look at it once more.If the upAkarma talks about sins accumulated over a year; in sandhyAvandanam the frequency of washing off sins is much more - यदह्नात् कुरुते पापं तदह्नात् प्रतिमुच्यतेयद्रात्रियात् कुरुते पापं तद्रात्रियात् प्ततिमुच्यते ...,
यदह्ना पापमकार्षं मनसा वाचा हस्ताभ्यां पद्भ्यामुदरेण ..., यदुच्छिष्टमभोज्यं यद्वा दुश्चरितं मम सर्वं पुनन्तु मामापः ... ; so that might not be sufficient to say that upAkarma is the chosen rite for review.
