Namaste

  

On \< I wonder if you have any pointers in Saastra which led you to conclude as above or other positions arrived at; or is it a holistic analysis and a view on what ought to be? \>

  

1\. Yes, it is a holistic analysis, based on what the texts say, what I have seen as living practice undergoing mutation and a pointer to course correction for the communityon \< Hoped expectation on what it ought to be>; and more so for 'Vaidika Purohita Training'. This is a status review. This is alsoa rebuttal on inaccurate interpretation of ' Core Traditional Thought related to Upaakarma for Sandhyavandanam -Annual Audit for renewal and recharge'. This is taking in to account the slide down of practicesseen in community as 'Corrupted Practice'leading to'distorting internal soul of Varna-Identity'. ( Kuryaat anyat, na vaa kuryaat, maitro Brahmana uchyate : Manu Smriti)

  

For reference sourcing, Take any upaakarma prayoga book and read the
'samkalpa' that precedes the ' Nootana Yajnopavita Dharana' and 'Brahma Karma Prayoga'.The flavors of Saivite and Vaishnavite -Shaakta et al
does not change the scenario, the rule, standardsor the goal.

  

 My statement is based on the clear textual statement of authorityin'Mantras and Vidhis' prescribed for EACH VEDA recommended ' Upaakarma' Prayoga . I am of the opinion that the ' Prayoga texts' do provide a holistic guidance on ' Veda-Practicum' ;
they are extremely accommodative and considerate for the social dynamics and economic scenarios.

  

 What ' Upaakarma' needs in terms of ' material needs, for one day in a year, is a few liters of water, some darbha grass, some fruits and flowers, some yajnopavitams, and havan samagri. Rest is all 'Chants'. Of course, TIME is the premium issue along with personal commitment to stay to the rule book and practices. A whole one year time is given to pursue the upaakarma commitments (samvatsara kruta dosha prayachittartham) to help and be helped by the Vedas ( It is the timegap between Vedaarambhana-Upaakrutaa vai vedaha - utsrushtaa vai vedah) between these audits.

  

When Prayoga texts direct the 'Acharya /(Brahmana -?) community to observe ' Upaakarma Vidhi' by Rik, Yajus, Saama and Atharva veda specificities,it is a clear pointer to the ' Dharma-Shaastra - Prayoga' position. What ought to be used for audit.

  

When it comes to ' Practice', the social dynamics causedifferences in implementation and ' preferential choice by the individuals'.

  

In the early period ( and by that I mean even aslate as and up to 1990 which I have seen in myownclose circles, ; itmay be there even now in some special Gurukuls and Veda -Patha Shaalas), the Rig-Veda upakarma was conducted specifically on 'Shrvana nakshatra) and only for Rigveda teams; And ' Shraavana- Poornimaa' for Yajurveda teams; and some other preferred prescribed days for the Saama-Vedins. 

  

 The rule was strict.The ' Vedanta flavor 'Mathas, the Gurus, the Jyotisha teams, the space providing Temple authorities' have absolutely no scope to interpret or influence or change what is already in the prayoga texts. ' The ' Upaakarma' vidhi is prescribedby 'Varna -Veda -Samskaara' factors using when a 'Stellar combination and a lunar tithi/ masa occurs. On which none of us have any control.

  

On the next probable question why upaakarma on a specific day / nakshatra, the question is to be answered by the 'Sutra-kaaras /Rishis'. I am not competent enough to address it.

  

Currently, when the ' Personal Vedic Renewal process ( = Upaakarma) has become a Community Collective Group Regimentation Ritual (Saamoohika Karma ?!) the 'Conducting Acharya handles the 'Team' in the
Time-constraint and Space Constraint of ' performing place like 'Temple'. This scenariodoes not help to address ' individual needs', meet the standards set by Rule books and 'generate enoughservice charges for the conducting scholar of Vedas.This is lack of motivation to conduct the 'veda -vihita vidhi' in its appropriate way as prescribed. The net result : Ritual to Keep Appearances', with stress on 'Aakaara minus Aachaara-Vichara to back the Samskaara'.

  

So the individual fruits ( The individual'brahmanas'/ Varnas - with 'veda' specificity - like the specific fruit category-identity of of mango, the banana) loose their unique identity to the Collective
Identity when placed in a ' Fruit basket (Brahmana Samooha) along with other (fruits of similar / dissimilar nature :: sa-jaateeya / vi-jaateeya) in performing a ' Personal Private Samskara' in a 'Public Collective way' . In Rajiv Malhotras terms, this is 'Digestion and Internal Distortion -dilution'.

  

All this for what ? The ' Cost and Effort saving for comfort at House' - For one day??!!to provide support for a Vedic scholar for one day?? The economics of 'Brahmana - Purohita Vrutti' :: Professional living and life style of 'Brahmana Vedic Scholar' depends upon the ' Consumers of this service in community'.Consideration of
Individual Varna Community consumers by factors of Economics of operation has lead to cutting cornersin administration of
'enlightenment samskaras' (= Brahma-Karma and Brahmana Karma), like the 'Shortened and distorted modes of 'Sandhyavandanam, substitution of Sandhyavandanam by ' temple visit and prayers'... et al. 

  

What would Dharma -Shastra /Prayoga books advocate on such distress mode practices ? It is for each individual family and internal community to make a self-audit : Whether they are in ' real distress mode to invoke and -self-prioritize the compliance to Vedic Guidance' ? Should Cost reduction mode- No stress and commitment inside the family and personal heart/ head toperform a 'Veda -Compliant Samskara' overpower and blockones own 'Swa-Dharma' for 'Atma-Kalyana /Vishva Kalyana'.

  

**Ending,**

  

Should one follow a two or more century old ' Prayoga' talking about hoary antique 'Veda / Gruhya /Dharma Sutra' texts written in Samskrutham ? and struggle to retain the 'Varna -Identity Appearance ' by 'display of half naked upper body with decorative marks and tarnished Sacredthreads?

  

 OR

  

Should onemake efforts to make a 'Critical (?) Edition of the ' Prayoga works' that best suit the ' Digital Payment ' mode in the 21st
century ' prescribing Ultramodern Pizza Berger naivedya prescribtions withaerated drinks for aachamanam'? May be one needs a ' Boden Initiative' to fund such work ?!

  

It all depends upon who wants the 'Varna Identity'? Who is ready to research and take lead in the ' Veda -Practicum beyond Temples, Ashramsand Missions' to 'University and Communities'. 'Artha moolau Dharma-Kamau' is Chanakya guidance for such endeavor. Getting Grants for studies is the summing up in current idiom.
