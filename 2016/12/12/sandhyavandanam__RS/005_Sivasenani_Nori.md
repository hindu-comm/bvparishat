The ‘ praticum of Sandhya-Vandana Samskara and Practice is to be arrived at and understood under the totality of ‘ Gruhya Sutras and Dharma –Shastras’ and analyzing ‘ individual requirements ‘ case by case basis. Sandhya vandanam practice needs an annual audit and update through the review system of ‘ Upaa-karma’ (= Annual Thread Changing program, a time to review and make course correction in ‘Brahma-Karma /Brahmana-Karma Practice). This has ended up as a farcical practice of ‘ New Thread wearing’, not understanding why the old thread was worn in the first instance.

  

I wonder if you have any pointers in Saastra which led you to conclude as above or other positions arrived at; or is it a holistic analysis and a view on what ought to be?
