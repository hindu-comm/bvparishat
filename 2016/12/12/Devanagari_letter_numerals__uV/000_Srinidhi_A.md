Namaste,

Modern Devanagari script use digits based on Decimal system.(०, १, २, ३, ४, ५, ६, ७, ८, ९)

However a distinct non-decimal set of numerals existed inearly and medieval manuscripts along with regular digits.

These are derived from Brahmi script. Numbers are used in following manner 1-9,10-90,100-... and so on.These are knownas 'Letter-numerals' among scholars.  

**Region:**It was prevent in Rajasthan,Gujarat states of Western India.It was used in both Jaina-nagari style and regular Devanagari.

Similar Letter numerals were also used in Newar and Ranjana scripts of Nepal.

  

I request to scholars and manuscriptologists to give additional information. And also **respond the****following questions** on letter-numerals of Devanagari and Nepal.

1.How were the letter numerals writtenafter 400,i.e 500 to 900?

2.Are there distinct letternumerals for multiples of thousand like 2000,3000, etc?

3.I requestto share images/send link of manuscripts containingthe letter numerals.

Are there any websites where these digital manuscripts are available.?

4. Up towhat time period/centurythese numerals were used?

  

Regards,

Srinidhi A
