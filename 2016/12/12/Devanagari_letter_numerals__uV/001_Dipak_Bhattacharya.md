Dear Srinidhiji, I thank you for the postings. Could you kindly state how you determined whether they have place value or not? A decimal system must have place value but could you determine that with their qualifying any object/objects?  

I am sure that you must have done so, but that was not clear from the mail.  

Best wishes  

Dipak Bhattacharya
