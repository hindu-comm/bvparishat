Dear friends,  
  

I am looking for a paper by SengakuMayeda, entitled "The Authenticity of the Bhagaavadgitabhasya Ascribed to Sankara", which was published in the Journal *: Wiener Zeitschrift fur die Kunde Sud-und Ostasiens, part IX, 1965, pp, 155-94. I shall be thankful if any scholar can help me get a copy of this paper,

Regards,  

Sunil K. Bhattacharjta*
