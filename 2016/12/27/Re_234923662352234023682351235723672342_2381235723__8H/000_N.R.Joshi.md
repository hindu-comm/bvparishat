Namaste Prof. Korada & Dr. BVK



Hope, your posts serve as an eye openers for Scholars in India.



Obviously, at present India is a culturally bankrupt country, which we do not want to agree.



Samartha Ramadaa Swami expresses the reasoning & possible solution for such state affairs as an advise to your own mind :



अविद्यागुणे मानवा ऊमजेना ।  
भ्रमे चूकले हीत ते आकळेना ॥  
परीक्षेविणे बांधले दृढ नाणे ।  
परी सत्य मिथ्या असे कोण जाणे ॥ मनाचे श्लोक १४३ ॥



तस्मात् विचार करावा। देव कोण तो वोळखावा ।  
आपला आपण शोध घ्यावा। अंतर्यामीं ॥ दासबोध ४-७॥



When US Supreme Court Judge (Late) Warren Burger took office of Oath in 1984, he said,*"If you ask the question who is responsible, answer always must be I am, You are and We are".* 



IMO: Having also the "*viniyoga*" (the utility aspect) as it applies to the present from our vaidik it purely remained confined to recitation as a part of academic exercise of "*veda raksha*" for scholars. I think one needs to look at our vadik text as "*PURE MATHEMATICS*" and "*ENGINEERING, TRIGONOMETRY*, & Science in General" as an application - The Viniyoga - Upauktataa to the present times.



It is unfortunate that many scholars have become Black-Belt Champions of Internet Surfing and rarely express what is meant by the text.



Again, I would like to thank Prof Korada and Dr. BVK to touching the subject that is so dear to my heart.



Best rgds



Dr Yadu
