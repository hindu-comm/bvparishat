Namaste

  

  

This thread has brought in a focus on two specifics: (A) Historic causes and check points for reviewing how \< to address the decadence set by kaliyuga -Dharma> (B) Provide some Current explanation pointers, good as lamentation by the ' wishful desire for restoring past glory', which seem to end up in seminars and journal papers, 'preaching to the already convinced and lamenting team'. The untouched issue is same which Acharya Sayana, echoing Yaska has asked:

  

How would Vedas be beneficial to us, Here and Now ? The question is not a Post-British issue. The question has been eternally debated right from early days, through out the Vedas, Vedangas and Darshna Shaastras desiring to bring out the ' Applied Vedas (Veda-Viniyoga) for a Desired Phala ( Desired Benefit). The language tools and pedagogy has been a standing one all through.

This question is clearly and repeatedly articulated in Sayana in all his commentatires. One such being the commentary on Aitreya Brahmana -

The difficulty of understanding even Sayana Madhava ( Circa 1387 C.E)
is articulated by the stalwat schoalrs of earleir period like Satyvrat Sami Sastry, and lamented on for ' loss of tradition, Students interest ( who want to be tvaritaa vaktaar = Quick response providing spokes persons). Nay, this particular book has already introduced the mix of Oriental thought in articulate Sanskrit, which should have deserved better review attention by traditionalists since 1906. (See- <https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo.31924022991529;view=2up;seq=6;size=150>) .

The action here calls for a self review, a plan to be the 'Change Agents of what we wish to see as ground relaity in coming yeas', and take action by identifying the ' benefit receivers ( 'kasmai Devaya' and 'Tasmat' combined ) .

The strategy seems to be the same ' EDUCATION -ACTION - CORRECTION : Whether it comes from Samartha Ramadas \<परीक्षेविणे बांधले दृढ नाणे ।
परी सत्य मिथ्या असे कोण जाणे.. तस्मात् विचार करावा। \> OR Warren Burger \< "If you ask the question who is responsible, answer always must be I am, You are and We are".> The application and Benefit ( Viniyoga : Dr.Yadu's post) need to guide the strategy for recovery action. The \<Black-Belt Champions of Internet Surfing> seem to have some where lost the \< essential trio of पदवाक्यप्रमाणशास्त्रs ( व्याकरणम् , मीमांसा , न्यायवैशेषिके)> .

The seeds of divorce of ‘Spiritual and Social Streams of understanding the Classical (God’s) language' seems to have been set in the 'Indian Soceity of Traditional Teams way before \<The British ( we are not touching others) have entered Indian subcontinent thru East India Company for trade and commerce.> And this anchor gets pushed to the date and commentary written by Sayana as Veda -Bhashya, using the Shadanga methodology -pedagogy. This is the standard method approved by Sri Jayateertha and Acharya Madhva. The differences in conclusion apart, as Vedanta, there is no difference in the pedagogy and tools to be used to understand the langague documents of Dharma.

Certainly the British did take advantage of the situation> . As pointed by Professor Korada, \< People started tilting towards English as it was easy to learn compared to Sanskrit. They also started compiling dictionaries with regard to Sanskrit and vernaculars... During the course of time there emerged a group of people who have deviated from the original path of Education associated with Philosophy / Spirituality and started to take things as merely mundane ... Such a shift in education had had a very hard impact on Indian Education System and consequently on the minds of the indigenous people and their behavior . The way of thinking had completely changed. Instead of memorizing अमरकोश and getting trained in the scholars were attracted towards the English Dictionaries...>. The consequence of this is \< backbone of आर्यसंस्कृति , i e धर्म , is dissociated from Education as well as day to day life and today we face people of even Indian origin arguing against the established tenets .  

Today , it is almost impossible to find a scholar who is trained on traditional lines and can interpret the वेदs , इतिहासs etc. Also the present day students are are not interested in learning more . It is the धर्म of कलियुग !>

Ending: What is the action proposed ? And Team members ready to jump in ?
