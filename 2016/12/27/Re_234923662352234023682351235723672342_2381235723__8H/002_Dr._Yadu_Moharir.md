Namaste:

  

Here I would like to make few Points:

  

1. Thanks to Dr. BVK for correctly identifying the the core issue I was trying to lead to.  

  

2. There has been significant discussion pertaining to "BATTLE FOR SANSKRIT"; a great observation brought in the limelight by Sri rajiv Malhotra, but is the approach, blame on Western as well some select Indian scholars for not understanding / following / disregarding "*puurva paksha*" need to be evaluated by scholars by themselves.  

  

QUESTION: Have Indian scholars presented asserted their position on home tradition accurately ?  

  

 This the first time that an eminent scholar like Prof Korada has acknowledged the problem. I thought that it is important to recognize the universal truth that, "*You cannot change what you cannot acknowledge*". Acknowledgement begins with recolonization & interactions.  

  

Based on the specific example cited by Dr, BVK, is it not clear that the real fault is not with the Western scholarship but our own failure to recognize and acknowledge the problems when it comes to our real inheritance, the "knowledge from veda". I would be happy to provide many more such examples in due course of time (as and when needed)..  

  

Hope scholars will introspect the real issue and make some efforts towards the real "*Battle for Sanskrit*" and an exercise transition of authentication to 21st century as "*veda vidyaa viniyoga*". For this, home teams have to prepare "without a blame game".  

  

At this time only paksha that is alive in India, is "*dakshiNa paksha*" by becoming ब्रह्मवेत्ता as well as कर्मकर्ता ॥  

  

With best humble regards,

  

Dr Yadu

  

PS: A request to Dr Joshi please do not change the subject line with hundreds of Numbers as the subject line would never be able to be traced to the core subject matter being discusses in the context. I have no clue why you write the numbers and how it integrates on the list.
