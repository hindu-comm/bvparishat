Dear Raviji,

  

Also note that the Brahmasūtras begin with "athāto brahmajijñāsā" and the Mīmāṃsāsūtras begin with "athāto dharmajijñāsā". There are extensive discussions on the word "atha" by Śaṅkarācārya and Śabara, as well as by the commentators on the Mahābhāṣya. You should review these discussions, before making up your mind about what "atha" means in "atha yogānuśāsanam".
