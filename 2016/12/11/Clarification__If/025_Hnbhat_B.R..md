What is difficult in accepting in accepting what Vacaspathi Mishra's explanation of अथ योगानुशासनम्? Or भाष्य of पतञ्जलि which givesअथेत्ययम् अधिकारार्थः। योगानुशासनं शास्त्रम् अधिकृतं वेदितव्यम्। योगः समाधिः।

For the benefits of Yoga in life, read समाधिपादः of योगसूत्र and not only the first सूत्र of समाधिपाद and कैवल्यपाद. But it is out of the question you have raised about the first sutra of first pada in this thread. If needed, you can ask as other members suggested, you can start a new thread "how it can be used in life and is it useful in life or not?"  

  

This what has been said repeatedly by the other members and not any one has said Yoga Sutra-s are not useful in life.

  

Read the text with commentary which is available online
