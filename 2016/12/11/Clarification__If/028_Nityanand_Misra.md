Perhaps start a new thread for this? The question has been answered by several scholars. For any further treatment, you may see Ganganath Jha's excellent English translation, with notes, of the commentary by Vyasa on the Sutra.

I do not see any point in counter-questioning scholars who have helped you with anwers or unnecessarily dragging the thread. Questions like “Is Yoga Sutra useful in life or not” are themselves not useful in life. It is accepted that Yoga Sutra is theory for the practice of yoga which is practical. Both theory and practical are *puraka*-s (pun unintended) of each other. If you admit yoga is useful in life, its theory is certainly useful in life.
