Mr. Anil it is not difficult in accepting what you have said, okay can you tell what are the benefit of yoga sutra and how it can be used in life and is it useful in life or not



Regards,  
B S Ravindranath

Mr.Ravindranath,

It is difficult to understand why you cannot accept the meaning of Atha Yogaanushaasanam to be 'Now the discipline of Yoga will be dealt with'. As far as I know, there is no other meaning.
