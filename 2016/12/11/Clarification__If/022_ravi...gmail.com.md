Thanks to all scholars, any textual or literature is of no use if it is not related to life and yoga sutras are 100% related to life, hence I did the statement in that way and it is not create confusion in anyone, anything which doesn’t make any sense or support to life I am also not interested in it.

I am really interested in knowing the right meaning of the first sutra “Atha Yogaanushaanam” by understanding this sutra the remaining sutras are going make a big difference and that is why I have approached BVP.



Regards,

Bhagavaan! Uhh!



Thanks again.
