Thanks to all those who sent me messages of congratulating Meru, my grandson. His one Sanskrit sentence as a crocodile in the drama, as he told me on phone, was: मम चर्मण: बहुद्रव्याणि भवन्ति. Different children had roles of different animals, each claiming to be superior, and objecting to the claims of other animals. In the few seconds of video I have seen, after the crocodile says the above sentence, another character comes forward and says: किन्तु भवान् गिरति. Clearly, the children had a lot of fun, and Meru was excited after his performance, saying "I did a great job!"
