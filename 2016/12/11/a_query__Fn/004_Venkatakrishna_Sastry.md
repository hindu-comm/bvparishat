Namaste

  

Thanks for invoking the authority of Sri Jayateertha and linking it to the tradition which is set by Vedas, Vedanga ( Nirukta of Yaska) and followed by Sayanacharya.

  

Here are a few clarification requests, ( unless ... one places Sri Jayateertha - (c. 1365 – c. 1388) the sixth pontiff of Madhvacharya Peetha, of proximate period to Sayana Madhava Vidyaranaya Muni( associated with Vijayanagar empire and also Advaita Sampradaya peethm ; said to have died in 1387 CE) inthe same basket as ' narrowly traditional, confused commentator on Vedas withinsensitivity to Vyasa -Vedanta Sampradaya) ?

  

  

1. What precisely is the meaning of the expression yAtayAma in
\<यातयामान्यस्य छन्दांसि भवन्ति । अथ यो मन्त्रे मन्त्रे वेदसर्वमायुरेति श्रेयान् भवति अयातयामानस्य छन्दांसि भवन्ति । \> Literal meaning would be to say If practiced other wise, Vedas become 'Stale, unhealthy, sterile , distorted, tasteless' for the performer and the performed.

  

How have the commentators and 'Veda Instructors' adapted and lived by
this standard in in-house practices' ?

  

2. Whichis this 'Skandha school' referred to here ? \< अत्र स्कन्दमतस्य निराकरणम‍् \>

  

3. What transpired Histroically, Socially , in 'Veda Teaching Communities, to jump out of the boundaries set by Arsheya Brahmana
and 'Teaching Vedic Samskruth (Chandas) Language to societies' in the period of almost three hundred years, in India (Benares, Calcutta, Kashmir, Pune )facilitating  Max Müller,( 1823-1900) and others to learn , Edit , Translate 'Vedas and Vedic Language' ' ?which is out of synch with any known tradition of Vedanta -Shastra / Veda -Viniyoga Paddhati ?

  

What was the prompting whichpromulgated this ' another school of Veda - Studies, which is deeply and integrally impacting the pedagogy of
Samskruth Language ?

  

Just to give checkpoints on the History of Texts and Traditions setting Standards of Samskruth Language-Study Pedagogy, which existed prior toOrientalists neo-tradition constructions on Vedas:

  

Panini - Ashtadhyayi :700 BCE circa  
Patanjali - Mahabhashya : 200 BCE circa  
Bhartruhari - Vakyapadiya : 600 CE circa  
Jayaditya / Vamana -Kashikaa Vrutti : 700 C E circa  
Bhattoji Deekshita (Maharashtra)- Siddhnata Kaumudi: 1700 C E Circa

  

We do know several 'Kavya' usages of 'Bhashaa- Samskrutham, which is ' Not bound to the strict demandsof Chandas/ Veda'. Right from Valmiki, Vyasa, Kalidasa, Bhasa tolater writers. Bharatas Natya shastra provides enoughevidence for social usage of ' Bhashaa -Samskrutham'. 

  

In this context, will traditional schools still hold the Nirukta and Arsheya Brahmana guidance, validall throughOr shelve it as a historic relic of information, only for faith-folks to entice the gullible !
