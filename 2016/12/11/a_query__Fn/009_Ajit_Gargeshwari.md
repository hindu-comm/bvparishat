Both Manu Smriti and Yajanavalkya Smriti talk about 14 vidyasthanas, quoting Manu



Angani Vedascatvaro mimamsa-nyayavistharah

Puranam dharmasastram ca vidya hyetascaturdas



The remaining four - Ayurveda, Arthasastra, Dhanurveda and Gandharvaveda - don’t directly deal with dharma. They are not dharma sthanas (abodes of dharma) but they qualify to be Vidyasthanas (abodes of knowledge). Some schools hold Sthapatya Veda as the fourth Upaveda Arthasastra.



All the aforesaid eighteen Vidyasthanas or bodies of knowledge (four Vedas, six Veda angas, four Upavedas and four apanagas) fall into one or the other of the categories Vedanta Desika enumerates as



"asAram, alpa sAram, sAram and sArataram"



While being formidable avenues of learning by themselves, they would not help us attain Moksha. Hence the description of these as "SumayAna KalvigaL", bodies of knowledge which are but burdensome.
