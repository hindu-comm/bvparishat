Namaste





1. On \< The remaining four - Ayurveda, Arthasastra, Dhanurveda and Gandharvaveda - don’t directly deal with dharma. They are **not dharma sthanas** (abodes of dharma) but **they qualify to be Vidyasthanas (abodes of knowledge).** > :



This statement needs further clarification, as it appears to be ‘
jarring from the main stream understanding’ of the ‘ Upa-Vedas’ as given in the source works themselves. Each Upa-Veda yields ‘ Four Fold Purushartha’ where in ‘ Dharma-Artha – Kama - Moksha’ are integrally covered. Therefore, each upa-veda is also a Dharma –Sthana and also a Vidya –Sthana.



2. On \< Both Manu Smriti and Yajanavalkya Smriti talk about 14 vidyasthanas \> : The quoted reference does not add up to the number count of fourteen/ eighteen ?



(Vedah/ Upavedas -4 ) + (Mimaamsaa -1) + ( Nyaya vistarah -1) + ( Puranam -1 category, even if the number is 14 or 18 or more) + (Dharma Shaastram -1 category, even when there are several books) = Totals to 8.



Even if Veda (4) + upaveda (4) adds to 8, the total is 12. 



IF the given explanation of 18 \<** All the aforesaid eighteen Vidyasthanas** \> is to be counted as \< four Vedas, six Veda angas, **four Upavedas** and **four apanagas** \> the quoted sloka needs to be reexamined for the listing of the word ‘ Upa-Vedas’ (4) .



Angani (-6) Vedascatvaro (-4) mimamsa-nyayavistharah (1+1)

Puranam (-1) dharmasastram (-1) ca vidya hyetascaturdas (=14)





Am I missing something the numbers?



3. On \< 14 Vidyasthanas \> : The reading in the text is \< Vidyah> = These are Vidyas ; The difference between the textual word ‘Vidya’
and expansion of it as ‘Vidya-Sthana’ needs an explanation.



Vidya – is a direct designation of the Discipline, the ‘Body of Knowledge’. 



‘Vidya-Sthana’- would mean ‘ Resources to attain Knowledge / Vidya’.
