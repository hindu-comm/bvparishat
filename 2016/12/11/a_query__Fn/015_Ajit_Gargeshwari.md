Dear Prof Shastri,

Let me clarify there are 14 Dharmasthanas 4 Vedas6
Vedangas,Mimamsa,Nyaya, Dharma shastras Puranas which the quote from the Yjnavalkya smrti which Prof Varakhedi gave and from the quotation of Manu which I gave. There 4 Vidyasthanas Ayurveda Dharnurveda Artha shastra Gandharva Veda. Now this adds up to 14 Dharamasthas plus 4 Vidyasthanas. If one combine Dharmasthans and Vidyasthanas and call them Vidyasthanas one gets 18 Vidyasthanas



I don’t want to get into complicated definitions what I wrote was what Dharma Shastras and Upanishads says on Dhama Sthanas and Vidya Sthanas

Regards
