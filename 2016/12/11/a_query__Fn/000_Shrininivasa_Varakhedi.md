scholars,  
  
i would be grateful if someone enlightens me about the vedic/smruti statement where the ignorance of Chandas is condemned. While reading the PrasthAnabheda of Sri Madhusudana saraswathi i came across a sentence like - तदज्ञाने निन्दाश्रवणात्. Here tad means Chandas.  
  
with best regards,
