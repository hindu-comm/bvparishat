Thanks to all scholars who extended their help. This verse is a wonderful verse. I need another help.

  

Reference to the following verse in Yajnavalkya smruti

  

पुराणन्यायमीमांसाधर्मशास्त्रांगमिश्रिताः ......where fourteen vidyasthanas are enumerated.

  

There is another mention of Vidyasthanas in Upanishads where eighteen are counted. Could you please help me to get these references ?

  

I searched but could not get in time.

  

best regards and thanks in advance
