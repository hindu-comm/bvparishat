Dear Dr. Anilkumar,

I am very glad to learn that your book will be released. I wish the program a grand success.

I have been trying to send the following mail to [bypar...@googlegroups.com]() but failed. If you find it relevant please forward it to the group and also let me know what mistake I was doing.

  

Subject; Tribal Heritage  

  

Namaskar,

I have been doing research on Tribal Heritage in India. Obviously I was interested to learn as to how the people whom we now know as tribe were conceived in ancient India. A couple of years ago I had requested you to help me to get some relevant information. I did get some and continued my research. It is now complete and the book **Tribal Heritage an overlooked chapter of Indian history** will be out soon printed by Ingram Spark.

  

Briefly my conclusions are that there was a never a category of tribe in Indian thought. They were a part of the regional set up like any other jati. There were periods of hostility and cooperation between forest dwellers and food producers. But like other communities they were the building blocks of the Indian civilization. They played a variety of roles such as supply of goods and services, maintained forest resources, which were so vital in pre industrial India, acted as bridge and buffer between powerful nations. Since they lived in forests, hills and remote areas they were always close to nature and maintained their cultural and linguistic identities.

  

Forests in Indian thought were not merely wilderness but place for retreat, learning and introspection. The forests were for renouncers and also for those who were banished. Many sacred places were located deep in the forest or on the top of the hills. Herbal medicines were drawn from forests In all such activities the forest dwellers played a vital role including catching and domesticating elephants which has such a prominent role in larger Indian society. The tribes even today depict values, which are eternal and they also conserve the environment in which they inhabit. They believe in sharing and social storage and are generally egalitarian.

  

It was during the colonial rule that the category of tribe emerged in India when most of their traditional rights and roles were extinguished. The popular theory that was propagated and passed on from one generation to the other was that before the Aryans came to India there was a substratum of populations in different parts of the country They were either subjugated or enslaved or driven into remote regions of the country by the Aryans ignoring the great variety they present maintaining their linguistic and cultural identity. This theory was based on flimsy data. Since Aryan invasion theory is coming under severe challenge it is relevant to bring to your information a significant paper written by Dr. Purnima Sinha entitled ‘Jarawa Songs and Vedic Chant’ published in Journal of the Asiatic Society Vol. XLVII, No.4 2005 (Pp.114-123).

  

Sinha writes ‘ I had with me tape records of contemporary way of Vedic chanting in India both from South and North. The tunes in both regions are same and it is believed that the way of chanting Vedic hymn has continued more or less unchanged from the ancient to contemporary age. I was amazed by striking similarity between the melodic pattern of Jarawa songs and Vedic chant, using the same set of notes.’ Sinha was a physicist but was interested in Indian music. Jarawa are considered to be a classical food gathering and hunting population and inhabit a certain portion of Andaman Island.

  

I would like to draw the attention of the learned scholars of this forum to this article and to the brief introduction which I have given above and invite their valued comments. I can forward a copy of Sinha's article to those who may be interested in it.
