Dear Shrinivas ji,  
  
This is a commentary on the Shruti-stuti (also known as the Veda-stuti) chapter of the tenth skandha of Srimad-bhagavata mahapurana.  
  
This is considered to be one of the most difficult to interpret chapters of the bhagavatam. Sri Prabodhananda Saraswati interprets this chapter in a completely new light.

  
  
sādhu-caraṇa-rajo'bhilāṣī,  
  
hari parshad das.
