Dear BVK, Now you offered good reply to my posting. I am not keeping you in the dark. Saamba received curse from sages who came to the holiest place on the earth created by Shri Krishna. It was Pindaraka teerth. It was created by Krisha himself.



Now regarding your other post on changes in Sanskrit by M.W. or other recent scholars. I am reading the book (Language of Nirukta) by Mantrini Prasad. Ph.D.Thesis



Opinions of many scholars on etymology of Sanskrit words starting from Yaaska are included in this book. Hundreds of vocables from Samhitas, Brahmanas went out of use by the time of Yaaska (700 BC). Hundreds of vocables become unintelligent by 700 BC. Sound changes took place, Phonemes were replaced. There were dialects of Sanskrit even before 700 BC. Meanings of certain words were completely changed by the time of Panini. Where is the truth?



Information which is certain in the beginning tends to become uncertain with passage of time.



Why did I turn to VarNavaada? (1) Almost all Acharyas (except few) supported it. (2) It is based on the scientifically arranged letters of Sanskrit VarNamaalaa.



VyaakaraNa is totally different subject.

I will give some concrete examples of changed meanings of Sanskrit words by the time of Yaaska. Thanks. N.R.Joshi

Namaste Joshi ji 



**Points I agree with you**:



1. On all ‘ Why and Why not questions’ -- \< Why to blame Kaliyuga…. There are hundreds of question to which religious scholars have no answers \> . I agree. We don’t have to lament.



 Neither I can correct it, OR can I answer it. Nor anybody can answer this ! Time Travel machine is yet to be available to us ! 



2. On \< Moreover, I have nothing to do with Bible history, Abraham the Hebrew, Latin , Greek, etc from your post \> O.K. We can drop it out.

3. I understand your focus on History and Mahabharath outside Bharath.



**Points we can continue to research as suggested:**

1.On \< Location where Saamba received curse and giving birth to Musala> . Need further research and clarity on the Text. Why would a man give \< birth> to a \< pestle? \>



2. Importance of curse : We can either \< believe> and pursue the consequence OR Ignore it and search for a physical logical explanation OR Force explanation on the narrative.

The path of research by \< Moksha seekers using Mahabharata> is different from \< History seekers from Mahabharata studies>.



3. For a team which looks at \< Mahabharata as Sri Krishnas Avataar and detailing of Dharma establishment>, the land-history of \<Saambas curse> does not make any difference; nay even the place where Krishna exited by the hit of the arrow on left feet. (*<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhalka>* - ) This place has now become a commercial ‘Kshetra’ beyond history.

Then do we want to interpret ‘ musala’ as a part of the word ‘ Musala-maana’ / Muslim using Sanskrit rule base and ingenuity ? Probably not.



Let us explore the land history of Mahabharata with different means and tools; and with you in the lead.



Regards

BVK Sastry

Dear BVK Sastry, PraNaama,

You missed the important point from my posting. Have youthought why Dr,Joshi was referring to the location where Saamba received curse of giving birth to Musala?



Why to blame Kaliyuga for the changed religious, dharmika, spiritual situation of present day India and spreadof English? why to blame Muslim aggressions? Why India did not look beyond its western border before 600 AD to find out what was happening there, who was inventing what? Rajputs swords were defeated by new technology of guns of Babar. Why did not Indians do archaeological excavation in the subcontinent/ Why they have to wait outsiders (British) to undertake it? There are hundreds of question to which religious scholars have no answers..

If you get time find out importance of location of curse. Moreover, I have nothing to do with Bible history, Abraham the Hebrew, Latin , Greek, etc from your post. You know that I am independent scholar. I did my own research because of the spread of Persian empire from Egypt to Sindhu river in the known history from 526 BC to 326 BC.Thanks.

NRJOSHI.
