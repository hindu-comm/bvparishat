1. On \< Pindaaraka Teertha>, as a faith person, I too would be happy to accept your statement. But some where the ‘academic gene’ haunts.
Help me with more specifics : What proof can we adduce for the statement \< Sri Krishna himself created Pindaarka Teertha> ? Cultural belief, Faith, Langauge, Practicing Tradition, Beyond India evidence ….
We are not the only two to be happy with this sacred secret
information.



2. Regarding other posts .. MW … Nirukta .. Your Varna-Vada theory …Ph.D thesis …. I want to get back to the basic question you had triggered on me :What is Samskrutham ? The language of the ancient Indian Documents ? What does the locals believe in its entirety ? beyond one specific one sixth model of research as ‘ Nirukta’ ? Let us start abinitio, using Native lens and resources and keeping aside the ‘ Linguistic and Indology from Orientalists’ ? It gives less load and freedom to explore ? How about a relook at Panini ?
