**CALL FOR PAPERS FOR THE FOCAL THEME- AYURVEDA WITH SANSKRIT AND ITS PROFOUND SIGNIFICANCE FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING**

**Back ground**

Vedas are the compendium of divine wisdom. These are expounded by *Rishis* – Vedic visionaries. It is perfectly preserved in the purest form by *swaruparaksha* (preservation of the text in its pristine form as expounded by the *Rishis*), *artharaksha* (preservation of the true meaning), *prayogaraksha* (preservation of the methodology of application). Hence the Vedic rituals are performed with precision. Being an *upaveda* of *Athravaveda*, Ayurveda is well structured on axiomatic concepts, which are unchangeable. This is unique and extra-sensory and free from limitations. Ayurvedic concepts of *Swasthya* stand on the same horizontal plane of Yoga but later are higher in vertical plane due to its all-inclusive nature.

The universe – *Brahmanda* is manifestation of divinity. Hence universe is potentially divine. According to Ayurveda, everything existing in this universe, matter or energy, living or non-living, is medicine if properly used. Improper use will result in *visha* (poison). Basic pharmacology - *bheshajakalpa* of Ayurveda holds good to all existing healing art whether modern or ancient. Etymology of the words “*Aushadha*” and “*Bhesaja*” clearly elucidates at a sweep all present and future medication of any system.

During the British rule, directly and indirectly, due to the process of deculturation we were compelled to debunk many of our treasures of ancient wisdom. Fortunately, objectivity (sensory) of science and technology started realizing the greatness of our ancient wisdom. The intelligentsia of the west started the restoration operation. Sensory knowledge opened a vista to peek through unlimited potentialities of the abstract and extra-sensory concepts of the Vedas. The advancement of modern science accelerated the process of inquisitiveness to delve deep into the infinite source of Vedic wisdom. Now the universal principals enshrined in Vedas are appreciated by many disciplines of modern science. Now a stage is reached for bridging *aprathyaksham* (extra-sensory knowledge on ancient wisdom) and *pratyakhsam* (sensory knowledge of modern science). *Charakacharya* evaluated and appreciated both sensory and extra-sensory.

This National seminar intends to highlight the global relevance of intellectual heritage, particularly Ayurveda and its allied subjects with a vision on “AYURVEDA WITH SANSKRIT AND ITS PROFOUND
SIGNIFICANCE FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING”. Original research papers (written in Sanskrit/Hindi/ any Recognized regional language/English) are invited on -
