That's good.

But, your post appears to imply objections to any such attempt in every next sentence.

I read. They don't say that they are for promoting participation of traditionally trained scholars. So, it is better to have something for them.

चतुर्दशविद्यास्थानानि तदनुकूलानि च सर्व्वाणि ।

Clearly not.

Nope. विद्यास्थानानि are not flexible. They are fixed and rigid.

You can study and reflect on them. You can write commentaries on them. You can write essays explaining them. And those may be treated as शास्त्रम्. It doesn't become shAstra. Please, refer मीमांसाशास्त्रम् to have some idea.

It is more true that if you write about शास्त्रम्, it is not शास्त्रम्. You must write about the subject of shAstra, to make it compatible to them.

  

Anyhow, I don't think you were interested in actually understanding this. Your post was more like an outburst which occurred by watching someone pointing failure of BVP and proposing creation of a new group for a specific goal.

Any pointers in my posts which led you to such absurd idea?

That's a problem. No restriction means that you don't have a defined goal/subject.

That's why I proposed to have something with defined subject and goal.

Actually, I've answers. And, I already revealed it.

You must give some time to read and reflect.

This was discarded already. Please, read again to have a clear idea.

Yes. But, it's BVP's decision to not promote them. There is a role of BVP in that. You can't deny that the rules and prevailing trend of members and posts decide future participation.

A new platform can be made.

That's another absurd allegation if that's what you are trying to imply.

Prof Korada is a traditional scholar, Prof H N Bhat is same. But, both of them were/are related to University and similar organisation.

So, I can't say that traditional and University teachers are distinct divisions. It's you who is assuming too much to defend BVP which was administered by you for long.

  

For my definition, please read my posts. And avoid assuming too much.

Not all Indologists can write in Sanskrit. Similarly, not all traditional can write in English.

That has stopped them.

While Indologists have some well known platforms, Traditional Sanskrit Scholars don't have any dedicated group.

I've no objection if BVP becomes more and more Indology-inclined. But, I'm worried that Sanskrit scholars can't find enough space and support to reveal their ideas.

All posts or selected ones?

If all, then they must be exceptionally brilliant and almost omniscient.

If selected ones, then creating a new group for a group of them, which are finding this group bending towards Indology, is a good idea.

Same tolerance is expected from all who are feeling offended by seeing a proposal for traditional scholars/students.

Why not walk the path first?

I barely saw any such posts. You must be finding them more objectionable which make them appear bigger than they are.
