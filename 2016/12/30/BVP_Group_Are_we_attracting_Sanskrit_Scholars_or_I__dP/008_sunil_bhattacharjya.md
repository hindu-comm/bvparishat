Namaste,  
  

Kindly permit me to rlook at the term "Shastra". We know that two major upanishads recognized the Puranas and Itihasas as constituting the fifth veda and the Puranas are bound by five obligatory criteria, one criteria out of the panchalakshana, requires the puranas to be updated, such as by incorporating the political and astronomical changes with passage of time. That finally means that the definition of shastra has to be broad, like incorporating religion, philosophy. history etc. This also means that there can be fusion of Indology and the other areas of learning in Sanskrit.
