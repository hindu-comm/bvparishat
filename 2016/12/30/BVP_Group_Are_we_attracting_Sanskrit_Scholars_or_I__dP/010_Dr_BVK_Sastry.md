Namaste



Is ‘Samvaada’ turning to ‘Sangraama’ ? 



The focus of ‘Bharateeya Vidwat Parishat’ needs to stay true to its name –connotation : Bharateeyataa , Vidwattaa , Parishad-Dharma Niyama.



How will a new name change the ‘ essence of the discussion’ ? I presume that Samskruth Language posts are hall mark of Bharateeya –Vichara Dhaaraa Abhivyakti. 



Why is the thread turning to a ‘Siddhanta –Raaddhanta’ model with
‘person focus’?



**My personal view**: Language and Communication ( Bhaava –Bhashaa –Artha Taatparya) must match like ‘Ratnam Samaagaccahtu Kaancahnena) .


 We do want Traditional Classical Samskruth writing on the Group as much as a ‘ Content deliberation’ in practical language for a purpose.



For me this debate seems to be more on ‘ Whose authority one is accepting more as ‘ Shaastra and Pramanam’ than the language of the post. 



The trigger has always tripped whenever Shaastra –understanding is violated by the ‘Translations, taking the ‘ published journals and post colonial sources as authority to ride over the surviving system of tradition and pedagogy, rendering a hurt on the ‘pride of firm
belongingness and integral identity with a tradition’ ( = Sampradaaya –Paramparaa Nishthataa / Nishturataa).



Instead of getting emotionally upset on the individuals, can we address the goal oriented team work – as the vision of BVP ? to bring out the
‘Bharateeyataa – Vidwattaa – Parishat Dharma in samvaada’.



If legs walk differently than what the head guides (Buddhi) and eyes see (Pratyaksha) , the result is disaster (Pramaada) for both legs and head carried over the legs.

Then should one walk over the head and make head carry the leg OR
separate head from the legs?
