I think it is not possible in BVP. It is now more or less a group prevailed by Indologists or hybrids of two schools.

  

BVP started with good number of Sanskrit scholars and most posts were not so Indology-themed in early days.

Now, since last one and half years, the trend has changed. More and more persons with Indology background are part of our group. The number of posts dedicated to subjects other than shAstra-s has increased. The It is turning in to an Indology Group slowly. It's good in a way, and bad in other.

  

I think it's good time to create a group dedicated to shAstra-s from traditional point of view. We may exclusively allow Sanskrit posts, avoiding any other language altogether or may allow limited posts.

Threads may concentrate on solving problems in Sanskrit works mainly.

This may inspire Sanskrit scholars to write more. Writing skills in Sanskrit will be improved by reading them. Question answer style will be ननु ----इति चेत् । न च --- वाच्यम् । and न । मैवम् । and the logic will be presented in short as पञ्चम्यन्त and then elaborated.

This will bring many Sanskrit scholars to that platform, since many of Sanskrit scholars don't know the way to clearly express in English language. It may even help avoid personal comments/attacks, since that falls in अनुत्तर category. I don't see such precise-ness in English conversation.

  

It is evident that in these many years, both groups - BVP and Samskrita, has generated limited number of posts in Sanskrit language.

It is also clear that most traditional scholars are not part of these groups, because of lack of knowledge of English language. (Ignorance of technology is a common problem - so I don't count that.)

I think that, a group which is more compatible to them is needed.

  

If there is any such group already existing, please enlighten me. I'm willing to shift from BVP to such a group.

Otherwise, I've reserved one at [shaa...@googlegroups.com]()bearing name शास्त्रम्.
