Mr Sunil is famous for his innovative, although unverified and baseless, ideas throughout forums.

Many has tried to persuade him to present proof in support of his ideas in past and not to bend every word of every sentence to the boundaries.

I'll entertain his ideas only when his presents the shloka mentioning panchalaxana and his understanding of the word which lead him to such idea is revealed. Till then it's in the same category of his ideas about buddha, ashoka and Vedanta.
