Dear friends,

  

I do agree with Swami on his observation. A तर्क in Sanskrit is different than an "argument"

in English. A Sanskrit medium discussion would inspire people to express in Sanskrit

which would enhance their own understanding. People would write short and precise.

I think over all it would help create new scholarship by adopting technology into the tradition.

  

The question of course is for initiation and moderation. Swami with his command of the

language should be the moderator. The medium would be Sanskrit only.
People would be

allowed to join with a basic introduction written in Sanskrit. Swami can take a student of

his or a young volunteer from the group here to host the group.

  

It might sound elite and exclusive. But we must initiate analytic work using Sanskrit as

the medium and restrain from using distortions in translation. People like me must learn

to express ourselves more fluently in Sanskrit in order to participate.
That would certainly

help scholars in creating clarity and more referenced analysis. 

  

The process may get slow to warm up. But it would create a new environment of analytic

scholarship with more reading, quality thinking and referenced scholarship. Since Swami

appears to have command on the technology, he is ideally positioned to bless as well as

launch the project.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
