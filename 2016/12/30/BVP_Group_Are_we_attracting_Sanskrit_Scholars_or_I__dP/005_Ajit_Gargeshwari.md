Still you have got me wrong .Since I cannot create a group due to time restrictions please create one. I have the utmost respect for traditional scholars and traditions. I never said anything against traditional scholars it’s you who probably are of the opinion I have disrespect for tradition or traditional scholars. All know that traditional scholars are most important for our traditions and to have a vibrant continuity with past I need not repeat it here. Thanks

Regards

Ajit Gargeshwari
