The decision to start any group is yours There are or cannot be any objections. The objectives of the group is clearly posted on BVP home page. I don’t understand, forgive me for asking what shastra are we talking about here. If one writes in Sanskrit it becomes shastra else it is not is that what you are implying. Shastras are thought and even written in regional languages when that true if one writes in English does such writings become anti shastric writings? Members choose any topic they wish to discuss and there are no restriction on anybody to post their question or ask questions Again with due respect to the respected swami.



You say scholars should write more why are scholars not writing it’s a question which I have no answers. Traditional scholars are not writing because they don’t use computers or don’t want to use computers. It’s their decision if they choose to write or not. There is platform if they don’t write what can be done. There is no difference between traditional scholars or scholars who work in universities. I see no difference. All can post or write in Sanskrit or English what has stopped them? There are very good scholars who are writing or reading what’s posted here.



All I can say one must be tolerant and willing to debate and discuss all issues in Sanskrit or English. Every couple of months I keep seeing such posts as soon as a member disagrees with another members view they say they will start an new group. One cannot force on others ones view one can only articulate and write one view. One can agree or disagree is that not fair?
