Dear Scholars,



I attached an announcement for the post of Sanskrit Instructor at IITGn, open to registered PhD students close to completion (about to submit their thesis) or fresh PhD holders not yet in a career path. I will be grateful if you can help us identify potential candidates.



Best regards,



Michel
