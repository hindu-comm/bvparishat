Sunilji.

Please pitch in. Conjectures or broad pointers simply confuse.

Make a list of your objections. You are not wasting time.

These are more important than many other discussions we

witness. Incoherent statements however would be a waste.

Please concentrate on Mahabharata and the Vedas. I would

also request others to assist without making cursory remarks.

It would be a great help.

Thank you.
