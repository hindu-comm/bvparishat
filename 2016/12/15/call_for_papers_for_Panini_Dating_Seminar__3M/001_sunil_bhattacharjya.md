Namaste,  
  

This is a very good decision to organize a seminar of the date of Panini and I hope there would be very good response from the Sanskritists, worldwide. We know that Panini lived after the Mahabharata time (3139 BCE), as he mentioned Vasudeva-Arjuna and his date could be even after the time of Lord Buddha (19th century BCE). From the Rajatarangini we know that Chandracharya lived during the reign of the Kashmir king Abhimanyu (late 13th century BCE). It could also be that Panini was a senior contemporary of Chandracharya and also a junior contemporary of Ashvaghosha (late 14th century BCE).  
  

The Vedanga Jyotisha (14th century BCE) does mention about the start of the Uttarayana (Winter Solstice) as well as of the Month "Tapa" (of the Sayana or Tropical calendar) from the Shravistha nakshatra and may be that is also what you are referring to.  
  

I wish the seminar a great success.  
  

Regards,  

Sunil K.B.
