Dear Bijoyji,  
  

I am too in the west, though may not be not as long as you stayed, and I feel strongly about the need to have the correct history of the ancient past of India.. When I said historical and astronomical studies I meant documents too and that too read and understood properly and supported by other documents. What is use of documents if the documents are not properly read and understood. For example, Kalhana pandit in one place in the Rajatarangini tells us that a few people opposed about the time of the Mahabharata. That obviously means that barring (except) a few, the majority of people did not oppose the time of the Mahabharata as can be seen from the Rajatarangini.. It is a pity that all the scholars, including the scholars from Kashmir did not understand that and followed the interpretation given by the western scholars. In another place the same Rajatarangini, Kalhana was referring to the kuru pandavas ruling Kashmir in the kali era and this too was mot understood by the scholars, who followed western interpretation. I shall leave here and not take the valuable time of the scholars, but would like to point out that one should not blindly accept the interpretations of the western scholars regarding the ancient Indian history.  
  

Regards,  

SKB
