Dear Bijoyji,  
  

I read quite some years ago, some of the dates of the astronomical events (such as the solstices and the equinoxes in the different nakshatras) mentioned in the Vedas as have been worked out by scholars like late P, C, Sengupta, Late B.G,Tilak and late Ketkar and given in their publications. I would not name the figures offhand but these dates are generally not less than  a millennium before the Mahabharata times.  
  

Regards,
