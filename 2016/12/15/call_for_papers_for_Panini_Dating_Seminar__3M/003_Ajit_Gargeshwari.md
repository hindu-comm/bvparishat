Vedas was never composed its always there. This is the composition scheme I have. The current system classified by Sri Veda Vyasa happened 50,000 years back. Civilised men are in existence for 800,000 years. All is said spoken and written in Vedas. The jyotishas were precise documenters of ancient Indian chronology. The Indus are seal deciphered. Planes cloning and quantum mechanics were common day to knowledge during the Vedic era. I have enough proof. All those who don’t believe these have a western tilt. They don’t understand Sanskrit. If they believe and propagate the most ancient chronology then they are champions. Will send my detailed justification as soon as my hands are free. Please allow a year or so. Please write to off the list if needed.
