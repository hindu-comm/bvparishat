Dear Bijoyji,  
  

I can understand your concern and you have rightly mentioned about the evolution of language and script, and let us hope that the Indian scholars would care about these?  
  
liguistic aspect and After Lord Buddha's demise, the Hinayana Buddhst religious texts were written down in the Magadhi of that time and that shuddha Magadhi came to be known as Pali, as that language had done PAlan (nurturing) of the canonical Hinayana Buddhist scriptures. Thus Pali became a classical language and practically remained unaltered to thisday. A few inscriptions of Ashoka Maurya as well as a couple of inscriptions of Dasharatha, the grandson of Ashoka, were in that shuddha Magadhi or Pali whereeas the many inscriptions of Ashoka-II, prepared more than one thousand years later, are in a variant (evolute) of Pali. One scholar was ruing that many Ashokan inscriptions are unintelligible to Pali speaking people. There have been umpteen books on Ashokan edicts by great scholars, but practically none of them so far cared to look at this aspect that there could have been two Ashokas separated by more than a millenium. May be I will take up this work soon. With my limited resources and in the mid seventies, I may not be able to pursue many of these aspects to the desired conclusion, at the speed I myself would have liked to do.  
  

On the date of the Mahabharata war, I found historically and astronomically (mind that the stars do not lie and give you the correct information when you give the correct data) that it was fought on 3139 BCE and I shared lot of information on that publicly at different places, hoping that some of the scholars would have a second look at their own work giving them the other dates. As nobody has come out so far I shall have to publish my work on that and this is one of my priorities.  

  
Similarly there is confusion among many regarding the date of Adi Shankacharya. Historically as well as astronomically I find that he was born in the 6th century BCE, but the proponents of the 8th century CE date are yet to get convinced on that, and only an open mind on all sides to discuss things will help.  
  
Thorough seaching the relevant literature is very much a part of any research work. I hope many scholars will take up these projects. I also hope that the ICHR would be more active on these historical issues.So it is a question of time when all these issues will be sorted out, and the results will come out earlier provided more scholars take up work on these neglected areas.  
  

Regards,
