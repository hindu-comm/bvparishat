Dear Scholars,

Some of you may be interested in the second edition of our semester course on Introduction to Indian Knowledge Systems at IIT Gandhinagar, beginning next January. Details of the course, scholars and sessions are attached. The main theme is a study of ancient Indian society on its own terms, which, we hope, will promote a more intimate understanding of Indian society and its evolution in time.

I will be thankful if you circulate this announcement among interested friends and colleagues in the Ahmedabad / Gandhinagar region.

Best regards,

Michel
