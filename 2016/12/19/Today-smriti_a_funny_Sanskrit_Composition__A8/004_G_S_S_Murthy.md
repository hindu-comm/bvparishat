Very nice satirical piece in Sanskrit.

T P Kailasam, a famous playwright of Kannada wrote a play, "NamBrahmanke", which though is not very popular these days as being sectarian. I quote from the play, a passage which is in his Sanskrit, "

समिधमादाय, मुखे निक्षेप्य, वायुमाकर्षतः, अग्निं स्पृशाव्य, धूममुच्छ्वास्य, इदं तबाकू पत्रजो धूमः,अग्नये इदं न मम, अग्नैरिस्वाहा".

I record here a kannada verse which one of the elders in my village recited to me, which I managed to learn by heart and still remember.

" ಸಾಟೀನ್ಕೋಟು ಶರಾಯಿ ಟೋಪಿ ಮುಖಮಲ್ ಜುಬ್ಬಾ ಕೊರಳ್ ಪಟ್ಟಿಯಂ

ಮಲ್ಮಲ್ ಪಂಚೆ ಬೆರಳ್ಗೆ ಗ್ಲೌಸು ಮೊಳಕಾಲ್ ಮೋಜಾರಮಂ ಚುರ್ಚುರುಂ

ಬಂಗ್ಲೇ ಮಧ್ಯದ ಕುರ್ಚಿಯಲ್ ಕುಳಿತುಕೊಂಡಗ್ರೇಕ್ರುಮಾಲ್ ಸುತ್ತುವರಿಯೇಂ

ಮಹತ್ಪದವಿಯೋ ನಾ ಕಾಣೆ ನಾರಾಯಣಾ \|" It looks like I have missed a part of the verse.

Possibly the said elder person was himself the author.

Regards,

Murthy
