Dear Hari Parshad Dasji,

  

  Thanks for sharing a nice comic Sanskrit composition. Reminds me the style of Kaṇṭakāñjali of Late Profesor Arjunwadkar of Pune and Nīlakaṇṭha's Kaliviḍambana. My Sanskrit teacher (also teacher of Ashok Aklujkar, my senior Gurubandhu), Late Pt. N. N. Bhide used to give us one verse each week to memorize, and many were funny verses of unknown origin. Here is one of those verses satirically describing what happened to a Yogīśvara:

  

जग्ध्वा चक्रसमानमाषवटकान् आध्मायमानोदरे

  फट् फट् फाडिति पायवीयपवनान् योगीश्वरे मुञ्चति ।

उड्डीनं विहगैर्घटैर्विदलितं चान्दोलितं भित्तिभि:

  शिष्यैर्धावितमर्भकैर्निपतितं कोलाहलोऽभून्मठे ।।

  

  I wonder if anyone had read this verse before, and knows its source. I wish I had written down the whole (some comic, not all) collection of verses taught to us by Pt. Bhide. Pt. Bhide was an exacting teacher, especially for the voluntary class he used to teach at his home on the weekends. There were two rules for this class. If one made a single mistake, you go home an never come back. The second rule was that if one was more than 5 minutes late (without a good reason), you go home and never come back. On the first weekend, there were about 12 students. By the end of the first month, there were only two students left, who remained with Pt. Bhide for the rest of the year.
While Pt. Bhide was such a demanding teacher, he also made the learning of Sanskrit a lot of fun for those of us who were willing to adhere to his demanding discipline. ते हि नो दिवसा गता: ।
