The publishers provided an introduction describing the prodigaltalents of the author.

  

Humour through Satire is only the means but the end, the objective, the taatparya of the book is a critique of westernization from the perspective of a traditional Indian.

  

There are deeper observations such as

  

1\. A critique of Darwin's evolutionism

  

2\. Our readiness to accept with praamaaNyabuddhi if it is published in modern periodicals or if it is from someone with a western sounding name.

  

3\. Skin colour basedattitudes.

  

Thanks to AadaraNIya Hari Parshad Dasji for sharing such an important historical document.

  

These documents expressing attempts to decolonization right during the colonization itself (unlikethe cases of post-colonial decolonization attempts) are treasures to preserve.
