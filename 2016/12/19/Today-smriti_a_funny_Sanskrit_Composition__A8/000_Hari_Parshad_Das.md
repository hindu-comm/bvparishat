dear vidvaj-janas,  
  
A funny booklet named 'Today-smriti' by Kaviraj Jagannath Jha Shastri.  
  
<https://archive.org/details/today-smriti>  
  
The author pokes fun at the British way of life which was followed blindly by the Indian babus of his time.  
  
Its disappointing to note however, that the author passed away at the young age of 20.  
  
sādhu-caraṇa-rajo 'bhilāṣī,  
  
hari parshad das.
