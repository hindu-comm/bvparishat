Dear Dr Joshi,

You seem to suggest what a good study of Mahabharata should be.

It also would suggest that you have some studies done. Is it not

appropriate to detail your findings out for the benefit of others?

I personally would certainly deeply appreciate. We are trying to

create boundaries for our India Geography segment as we speak.

Your paper could be an asset.

Best regards,

BM
