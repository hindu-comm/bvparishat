Respected Scholars, Namaskar!



In my opinion, a true researcher will take into consideration all resources available. He will not filter out certain evidences coming from outside of the subcontinent in understanding extent of Mahabharat empire beyond borders of the subcontinent. I suggest if you look into the ancient known history of Persia (Persian empire), you will get a new insight into the ancient history of Mahabharata. Thanks . NRJOSHI
