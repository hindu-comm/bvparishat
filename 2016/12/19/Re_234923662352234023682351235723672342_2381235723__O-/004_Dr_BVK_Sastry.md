Namaste Joshi ji



Thanks for your post below with (a) clearly articulated \< IF …… THEN ……> Logic and (b) What you are looking for \< - Geographical place locations by Names in Mahabharata Text that will make Mahabharata really the history.> And you ask ‘ involved questions’ which cannot be answered with \< brevity> !



Let me address the **three issues** separately.



**1. \< IF… THEN … issue>** A History Seeker is NOT constrained by the \<Word- Meaning –Context of a given text> to anchor the grand narrative. In Bharath, the \< Mahabharata – itihasa> was primarily considered as a’ \< Moksha Narrative> and ‘ NOT as a narrative meant for detailing the Ground History of Land- People – in Time Line’. 



In this sense, Mahabharata, or Puranas are not the primary resources to delineate the ‘ locale –land identification with Coordinate precision for mapping’. 



Having said that, what role has ‘ Mahabharata / Ramayana/ Purana / Bhagavata…’ has played in giving a name identity for the People of a Land ; a National Pride and Cultural Heritage is a question worth pursuing. I limit this question to the current document in Samskruth language; and Mahabharata, as we have it. 



It is accepted from the known evidence that Mahabharata of Today has passed through an inclusive upgrade expansion / interpolation .. in many stages ( Jaya, Bharata, Mahabharata) through several narratives from Vaishmpayana, Suta and others, in multiple locations. Given the difficulty to clearly identify the ‘ Text layers, Language strata and the like’ which is multiply wrapped up in Local Faith –Practice belief traditions, I am of the opinion that the texts mentioned above are not to be used as ‘ History document’. The ‘ idea of a ‘Critical edition of Text ’ by use of ‘ academic scholarship, manuscript comparison..’
does help to the extent of ‘ getting to the literally grammatically consistent text’. But beyond that, the chopping of \< given text \> as \< interpolation – reconstruction \> is a \<Team- Scholars personal opinion> and holds no more value beyond that. Be it Mahabharta Critical edition or Vedas edited. In Traditional parlance, Veda is NOT a land history narrative of generations or human composition; not even a \< dialogue with Gods to give a message to a falling humanity !>



The follow up shoot – out question is : How is one to understand the given text of Bharateeya Tradition in Samskruth Langauge to make a Grand History narrative ? How have people of earlier time used and lived the text in their practices ? How does one work with the ‘ Uniquely peculiar, multiplexed by rules to accommodate derivation of a plurality of meanings” ? 



The choice is clear : One may believe in the mystic and live with the narrative of \< aadya-brahmanah dviteeya –parardhe,… vaivasvata manvantare… kali prathama charane ….bharata varshe bharata khande..> , which a historian will not accept. OR Start working backwards on :When was the first land-name association was made as \< kuru- jaangala, Kuru-kshetra, Bharata-Varsha, Hastinavati…>. There is no need to mix up the ‘Tradition of Faith and Doubt of Oriental Scholar’ by reading ‘ History that may be elusively present in such works’.

Before Concluding, if one has an answer on the naming conventions of ‘ Viswaroopa in Gita’ and firm up when the Snowy mountains on North of India were called ‘ Himalaya’ for the first time, may be we get an anchor. Similarly when was a mountain in current Sri lanka called ‘ Tri Koota Parvata’ ? 



**2. \< Identifying Geographical Place locations for names mentioned in Mahabharata \> **



 Probably, The starting book to look for would be a work like
‘Artha-Shaastra’ where land based names, kings would be figuring. May be another good point is ‘ Kalhanas Rajatarangini, and work backwards’; using ground reality of evidence as ‘ Primary Skeleton Structure’ . Language naming conventions and faith –practice parts can add flesh , blood , skin and decorative overcoats for ‘ imagining –imaging the past on a ‘ Television Serial’ and shape the feeling of people for pride.

A historians job needs to be clearly distinguished from the focused work of a - ‘ Poet, Philosopher and Priest ( = Purohita)’. It is more than likely that the ‘ Kings’ over a period of Time, have gotten themselves ‘ Painted afresh as incarnations ( = avatars) of Previous illustrious personalities’ and ‘ altered the course of ground and grand history narrative’. The purpose of Mahabharata as \< itihasa = Panchamo Vedah> in traditional sense is different from Mahabharata as \< itihasa = Desha vruttam and Vamshaavali = Land history and Family Geneology of modern Historian and academician. Each approach has its focus and purpose. Not to be confused.



And when at this point, the popular equation held sacrosanct by ‘ Oriental Academicians’ writing ‘ Land-People History of Vedic Traditions’ is worth a total review.



The ‘Oriental Scholars hypothesis and history -narrative build, is
anchored around the ‘ popular understanding and practice of language to construct the land-people history narrative.



The ‘ Language of Traditional Text and Tools used by Traditional Scholar for Technical explanation’ is set aside as ‘ irrelevant’. As in this case for \< itihasa, Purana>. 



The ‘Oriental Scholar’, has serious ‘ Doubt as the basis’ to reject the tradition for want of ‘Ground Evidence (= like inscription, numismatics, fossils, metals… ).

The Traditional schools carrying their narrative do not have anything more to offer beyond the norm of Experience-As- Evidence (= anubhava Pramana) and quote a \< rule from Grammar of language>. .



As an outcome of this shifted perspective, the result is the Battle :Sanskrit. The underlying hypothesis is ‘ Vedas deserve a position as Hindu Scriptures, an equal level platform and treatment as the ‘Scriptures of Abrahamic Traditions’.



IF \< Abrahamic Scriptures provided a Land-People-History grand narrative for Religion Teams> , THEN \< Vedas and related works of VEDA must follow the same pattern to provide the a Land-People-History grand narrative for Hindoo-Religion Teams.> And Fall out of this is \< Analysis of Samskrutham> on the model of \< Latin-Greek –Hebrew>. 



For example: Chatrpati Shivaji Maharaj / Sri Krishna Devaraya , in the known Historical context, at the time of coronation were ‘ Connected back to some illustrious personalities of \< Mahabharata itihasa>’.
This was done consciously, by the blessing of tradition and to keep connectivity and continuity of past. Same thing has happened with many kings of North. Many grand narratives of ‘ many jana- jati’s’ identify themselves with an epic character / Avatar at their ‘ local land’. It is a slippery ground to build a \< History>. 



**3. \< ( Approach that will make Mahabharata a Traditional understanding of \< itihasa = \> as Modern understanding of \< itihasa = Real History> **



May be the question can be better articulated as Follows: At what point of Historic time line, the currently identified ‘Kurukshetra, Hastinavati, Indraprastha, Khandava, ..> started using these names which seem to have been derived from the ‘ Earlier Works’ ?



Obvious is the point : The people of land named their locale and themselves using an ‘Earlier resource’ – ‘ Document of Historic or Mystic nature’.



This shifts the stress of interpreting language of text to the ‘ seeking of name adaptation for business’. If the name ‘Narayana’ or ‘ Joshi’ is given to the child, then the name existed prior to the
‘Child’ and some one took the pleasure of associating the identity of child with the ‘ given name’.
