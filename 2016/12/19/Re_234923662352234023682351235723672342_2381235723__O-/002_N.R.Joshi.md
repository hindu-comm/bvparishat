Dear BVK, PraNaam.

If one is looking for the knowledge of Darma and Moksha, in Mahabharat, it is good for him. If one is looking for Yoga in Mahabharat it is good for him.

I am looking for locations of Kurujangal, Kurupaanchaala, KurushraavaNa, Kuruyugandharou, Kurukambojas, Ladies Kingdom, Dvaitavana of Raja Yudhishthira, Tokhara whose king was taking care of pantry in the Raajasooya yajna of Raja Dharmaraja, Dvaitavana sarovara of Saughanthika lotuses, Paradise, and above all looking for the place where Saamba received curse of giving birth to Musala? In my opinion that will make Mahabharata really the history. Thanks. N.R.joshi

Namaste



Thanks to Professor Korada, who has illustrated clearly and with source references on SOME CRITICAL points, which may be lost sight of in skimmed reading of this post. 



According to the post, there are critical governing frameworks to be used to understand Samskruth Word-Meaning which govern the Word-Usage.
In this case, illustration coming for two words- itihAsa, Mahabharata. 



I am placing my follow questions alongside the post extract:



1. **How to approach Mahabharata :Research Studies** where ‘ Mahabharata is currently studied as a ‘ Document detailing the Land and People / History of ‘ Bharath that has become India’ ?



**Post Extract**: As far as interpretation of इतिहासौ is considered the less spoken the better . …. महाभारत is पञ्चमवेद -- the पुरुषार्थs that are dealt with in वेद are difficult to understand and follow for a common man . So the same meaning that is there in वेद is put in लौकिकशब्दs . Therefore , one who wants to understand / interpret the इतिहास should first study / understand the concepts such as धर्म , मोक्ष etc , that are embedded in वेद , with the help of वेदाङ्गानि and दर्शनानि । ….. अङ्गानि वेदाश्चत्वारः मीमांसा न्यायविस्तरः --- याज्ञवल्क्यस्मृतिः । … इतिहासौ - are grossly misinterpreted .



Many people do not know the meaning of - भारतम् ( तद्धितवृत्तिः) ---
सङ्ग्रामे प्रयोजनयोद्धृभ्यः ( पा 4-2-55) , अण् , ’ सो’स्य ’ अनुवृत्तिः । भरता योद्धारः अस्य सङ्ग्रामस्य भारतः । The Armageddonof भरतs .



The आख्यानम् that is written following भारतयुद्धम् is उपचारात् / ’अधिकृत्य कृते ग्रन्थे’ , भारतम् । महच्चेदं भारतम् महाभारतम् ।
महत्त्वात् भारवत्त्वाच्च महाभारतमुच्यते ।



**Follow up Question** : What is the border line point, where ‘ Indian Academia willingly embraced the shift from ‘Traditional Spiritual Anchor of understanding the text’ to the ‘Socially oriented colonial thought, leading to a deviant study of ‘ Mahabharata as a Document of Land- People History of Bharath, that has become India’ ? What is the precise marker for the shift in ‘Word- Meaning of itihAsa’ to ‘ Land –People-History’ ? to be studied as ‘Bharata – itihAsa’ / Bharateeya itihAsa’ ?



2. What is ‘ itihAsa’ ? What is the purpose and application of
Mahabharata as ‘itihAsa’ ? 



**Post Extract** : महाभारतम् / जयः - is an इतिहास । …
तैत्तिरीयारण्यकम् (2-13) clearly says that वेदाः , इतिहासाः , पुराणानि etc are helpful in attaining स्वर्ग and मोक्ष -- … ..... यद्ब्राह्मणानीतिहासान् पुराणानि कल्पान् गाथा नाराशग्ंसीः मेदाहुतयो देवानामभवन् ताभिः क्षुधं पाप्मानमपाघ्नन् अपहतपाप्मानो देवाः स्वर्गं लोकमायन् ब्रह्मणः सायुज्यमृषयो’गच्छन् ।





**Follow up Question: **What is the border line point, where ‘ Indian Samskruth studies willingly embraced the colonial Lexicons as overruling authority on traditional pedagogic resources and tolerated the ‘ deviant interpretations’ ? cutting asunder the ‘ Veda umbilical chord to understand Mahabharata, Puranas’ ? Is it due to divorcing of ‘Spiritual and Social Streams of understanding the Classical (God’s) language ?

नमो विद्वद्भ्यः



They did not believe in Guru-shishya tradition at all. While this was going on, I saw this thread in the group. The case with them was the lack of a Guru and lot of intellect resulting in misinformation of the text. Now I am wondering, could this have been a possibility (possibility of misinterpretation without the guidance of a Guru) that it was said Mahabharata should not be kept at home?
