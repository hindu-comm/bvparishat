नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

1.What is the border line point, where ‘ Indian Academia willingly
embraced the shift from ‘Traditional Spiritual Anchor of understanding the text’ to the ‘Socially oriented colonial thought, leading to a deviant study of ‘ Mahabharata as a Document of Land- People History of Bharath, that has become India’ ? What is the precise marker for the shift in ‘Word- Meaning of itihAsa’ to ‘ Land –People-History’ ? to be studied as ‘Bharata – itihAsa’ / Bharateeya itihAsa’ ?

  

2. Is it due to divorcing of ‘Spiritual and Social Streams of understanding the Classical (God’s) language ?

The British ( we are not touching others) have entered Indian subcontinent thru East India Company for trade and commerce. Then there were many small kingdoms and already the political arena was too disturbed with Hindu and Muslim kings fighting every now and then. Taking advantage of the situation the British slowly entered into other fields also while the trade was flourishing .

Some of them started learning Sanskrit . Once the Western Education System (WES) was in place the deterioration of Traditional Education started.

  

In fact, it is not only the field of Education , but Finance , Medical System, Polity , Defence ( then War Dept) etc are also affected by WES .

People started tilting towards English as it was easy to learn compared to Sanskrit . They also started compiling dictionaries with regard to Sanskrit and vernaculars.

  

During the course of time there emerged a group of people who have deviated from the original path of Education associated with Philosophy / Spirituality and started to take things as merely mundane .

  

Such a shift in education had had a very hard impact on Indian Education System and consequently on the minds of the indigenous people and their behavior . The way of thinking had completely changed. Instead of memorizing अमरकोश and getting trained in the essential trio of पदवाक्यप्रमाणशास्त्रs ( व्याकरणम् , मीमांसा , न्यायवैशेषिके) scholars were attracted towards the English Dictionaries.

  

So the backbone of आर्यसंस्कृति , i e धर्म , is dissociated from Education as well as day to day life and today we face people of even Indian origin arguing against the established tenets .

  

Today , it is almost impossible to find a scholar who is trained on traditional lines and can interpret the वेदs , इतिहासs etc.

  

Also the present day students are are not interested in learning more .

  

It is the धर्म of कलियुग !

  

गृहे गृहे पुस्तकभाण्डभाण्डम्

पुरे पुरे पण्डितयूथयूथम् ।

मठे मठे तापसबृन्दबृन्दम्

न ब्रह्मवेत्ता न च कर्मकर्ता ॥

  

धन्यो’स्मि
