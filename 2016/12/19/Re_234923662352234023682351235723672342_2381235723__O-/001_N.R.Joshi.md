Dear Prof S. Korada, Namaste!



गुशब्दस्त्वन्धकारः स्यात् रुशब्दः तन्निवारकः ।

I checked meanings in Apte dict--- Gu = to evacuate with stools and Ru is to cry.

Where could I get meanings of Gu and Ru you mentioned above? Thanks. N.R.Joshi

नमो विद्वद्भ्यः



They did not believe in Guru-shishya tradition at all. While this was going on, I saw this thread in the group. The case with them was the lack of a Guru and lot of intellect resulting in misinformation of the text. Now I am wondering, could this have been a possibility (possibility of misinterpretation without the guidance of a Guru) that it was said Mahabharata should not be kept at home?

Do not fall in the company of such people , even if they have वैरभक्ति as per भागवतम् ।

गुरुरुपायः - शिवसूत्रम् 2-6



गृणाति उपदिशति तात्त्विकम् अर्थम् इति गुरुः -- शिवसूत्रविमर्शिनी



महाभारतम् / जयः - is an इतिहास ।



तैत्तिरीयारण्यकम् (2-13) clearly says that वेदाः , इतिहासाः , पुराणानि etc are helpful in attaining स्वर्ग and मोक्ष --



..... यद्ब्राह्मणानीतिहासान् पुराणानि कल्पान् गाथा नाराशग्ंसीः मेदाहुतयो देवानामभवन् ताभिः क्षुधं पाप्मानमपाघ्नन् अपहतपाप्मानो देवाः स्वर्गं लोकमायन् ब्रह्मणः सायुज्यमृषयो’गच्छन् ।



What is इतिहास ?



Kaiyata under क्रतूक्थादिसूत्रान्ताट्ठक् (पा 4-2-60) --

भाष्यम् -

आख्यानाख्यायिकेतिहासपुराणेभ्यश्च - explains --



ऐतिहासिक इति । इतिह - शब्दः उपदेशपारम्पर्ये वर्तते । इतिह आस्यते अस्मिन् इति - इतिहासः। " हलश्च ’ इति घञ् । मयूरव्यंसकादित्वात् समासः , ततः ठक् ।



नागेशः -- इति हास्यते इति । उपदेशपारम्पर्येण आस्यते - निश्चयबुद्ध्या स्थीयते अस्मिन् इत्यर्थः ।

So , in spite of some interpolations , the इतिहास , which is handed down , is प्रमाणम् ।



अविच्छिन्नगुरुशिष्यपरम्परा is there in the उपदेश ।



गुरु can be any elderly person who conforms to the above definitions --



स राज्यं गुरुणा दत्तम् ( रघु - ४) -- गुरुः = पिता । नाटकेष्वपि - गुरुजनः इत्यादि ।



One should not keep the text of महाभारतम् etc - is an अन्धविश्वास ।



Even great scholars and poets are not above such superstitions .



The parents and गुरु should have good knowledge and carefully train the children .



We do not have any such blind faith .



The eighth house (from लग्नम्) in the horoscope tells the longevity and शनैश्चर , who is आयुष्कारक as well .

Some people , depending on पूर्वजन्मकर्मफल , may have अल्पायुर्दाय , others मध्यायुर्दाय , and still others पूर्णायुर्दाय ।



No other factor can influence आयुर्दाय ।



अरक्षितं तिष्ठति दैवरक्षितं सुरक्षितं दैवहतं विनश्यति ।

जीवत्यनाथो’पि वने विसर्जितः कृतप्रयत्नो’पि गृहे न जीवति ॥ (हितोपदेशे)



As far as interpretation of इतिहासौ is considered the less spoken the better .



महाभारत is पञ्चमवेद -- the पुरुषार्थs that are dealt with in वेद are difficult to understand and follow for a common man . So the same meaning that is there in वेद is put in लौकिकशब्दs . Therefore , one who wants to understand / interpret the इतिहास should first study / understand the concepts such as धर्म , मोक्ष etc , that are embedded in वेद , with the help of वेदाङ्गानि and दर्शनानि ।



अङ्गानि वेदाश्चत्वारः मीमांसा न्यायविस्तरः --- याज्ञवल्क्यस्मृतिः ।



इतिहासौ - are grossly misinterpreted .



Many people do not know the meaning of - भारतम् ( तद्धितवृत्तिः) ---



सङ्ग्रामे प्रयोजनयोद्धृभ्यः ( पा 4-2-55) , अण् , ’ सो’स्य ’ अनुवृत्तिः । भरता योद्धारः अस्य सङ्ग्रामस्य भारतः ।



The Armageddonof भरतs .



The आख्यानम् that is written following भारतयुद्धम् is उपचारात् / ’अधिकृत्य कृते ग्रन्थे’ , भारतम् । महच्चेदं भारतम् महाभारतम् ।



महत्त्वात् भारवत्त्वाच्च महाभारतमुच्यते ।



धन्यो’स्मि
