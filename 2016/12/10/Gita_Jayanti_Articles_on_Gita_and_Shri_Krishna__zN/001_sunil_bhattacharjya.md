Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya,  
  

Dear Vishalji,

  

We have the highest regards to the Bhagavad Gita, which gives us the highest spiritual teachings, and your mail on it is a good one, However, I hope you would not mind if I put before the learned members of this august forum a few points on the Gita-Jayanti, the date of the Bhagavad gita and the number of verses in the original Bhagavad Gita.

  

As regards the Gita-jayanti we cannot ignore the fact that Bhishma fell in the war on the Ashtami thithi and he passed away on the 59^(th) day on the Ashtami tithi. It was immediately after Bhishma fell that the king Dhritarashtra asked Sanjaya to tell him all about the war. Till then Dhritarashtra was confident that the Kaurava's could not lose the war as their side was commanded by Bhishma whom, even Parashurama could not defeat. Dhritarashtra's confidence was shaken when he came to know that Bhishma had fallen. Thus the Gita Jayanti has to be on the Ashtami tithi on which Bhishma fell and not three ttithis later in the Ekadashi.

  

As regards the date of the Mahabharata war, the tradition of the Kali yuga-arambha in 3102 BCE, when Lord krishna passed away, the pauranic chronology and the Rajatarangini, all point to the fact that the Mahabharata war was fought towards the end of 3139 BCE. Even the astronomical dating shows that 3139 BCE is the date for the Mahabharata war. The 13-day eclipse pair is also seen in the 3139 BCE.

  

Regarding the number of verses in the Bhagavad Gita, the Mahabharata itself says that there were 745 verses in the Bhagavad Gita and there were manuscript available on that. The Gondla math in Gujarat and Dr. E. Vedavyasa from Hyderabad had workrd on it but their version has some superfluous verses. Two years ago I published the Original Bhagavad gita which has the original 745 verses. The book is out of print now and second edition will be published soon with certain additional notes etc.

  

Regards,

Sunil K. Bhattacharjya
