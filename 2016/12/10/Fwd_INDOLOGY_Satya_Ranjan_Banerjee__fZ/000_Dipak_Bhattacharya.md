It is with great sadness to report that Dr Satya Ranjan Banerjee, formerly Professor at the Department of Linguistics of the University of Calcutta, has passed away. He was one of the foremost scholars of Prakrit and Jainology of his generation and has taught numerous students from all over the world in India and abroad.

  

Amongst the inluential of his countless publications are: A Skeleton Grammar of Prakrit attributed to Jiva Gosvami (1963), (ed.) The Prākṛta-Prakāśa of Vararuci, Text Edited for the First Time with a New Commentary entitled Prākṛta-pāda-ṭīkā by Nārāyaṇa Viydāvinoda (1975), The eastern school of Prakrit Grammarians : a linguistic study (1977), A bibliography of Prakrit language (1977), Prākṛtādhyāya: The Prākr̥ta book of the Samkṣiptasāra (1982), Indo-European Tense and Aspect in Greek and Sanskrit (1983), A Handbook of Sanskrit Philology (1987), (ed.) Essays on Indo-European Linguistics: Proceedings of the Seminar on Indo-European Linguistics held on 1-2 February 1986 (1990), Jainism in different states of India (2001), Prolegomena to Prakritica et Jainica (2005), (ed.) Narrative Tale in Jain Literature (2008).

  

He will be dearly missed by all of us.
