Namaste Joshi ji 



**Points I agree with you**:



1. On all ‘ Why and Why not questions’ -- \< Why to blame Kaliyuga…. There are hundreds of question to which religious scholars have no answers \> . I agree. We don’t have to lament.



 Neither I can correct it, OR can I answer it. Nor anybody can answer this ! Time Travel machine is yet to be available to us ! 



2. On \< Moreover, I have nothing to do with Bible history, Abraham the Hebrew, Latin , Greek, etc from your post \> O.K. We can drop it out.

3. I understand your focus on History and Mahabharath outside Bharath.



**Points we can continue to research as suggested: **

1.On \< Location where Saamba received curse and giving birth to Musala> . Need further research and clarity on the Text. Why would a man give \< birth> to a \< pestle? \>



2. Importance of curse : We can either \< believe> and pursue the consequence OR Ignore it and search for a physical logical explanation OR Force explanation on the narrative.

The path of research by \< Moksha seekers using Mahabharata> is different from \< History seekers from Mahabharata studies>.



3. For a team which looks at \< Mahabharata as Sri Krishnas Avataar and detailing of Dharma establishment>, the land-history of \<Saambas curse> does not make any difference; nay even the place where Krishna exited by the hit of the arrow on left feet. (*<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhalka>* - ) This place has now become a commercial ‘Kshetra’ beyond history.

Then do we want to interpret ‘ musala’ as a part of the word ‘ Musala-maana’ / Muslim using Sanskrit rule base and ingenuity ? Probably not.



Let us explore the land history of Mahabharata with different means and tools; and with you in the lead.
