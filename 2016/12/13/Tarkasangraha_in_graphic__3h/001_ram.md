Thanks to VP for bringing this to our attention. I can't agree more.  

Indeed a worthwhile contribution.  

Though the contents of the slides need polishing, the efforts are commendable. Kudos!

If the author or someone else is willing to work on it, and produce more such works, would be glad to support such efforts by way of providing some financial assistance.  

They may write to me at the id: [mullai...@gmail.com]()  

Best wishes,

-ram.
