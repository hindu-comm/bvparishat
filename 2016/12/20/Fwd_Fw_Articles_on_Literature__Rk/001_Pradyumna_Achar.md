Dear Sir,

  

I would like to read these over the weekend; I'm sure I will have to look up the meanings of \*lot\* of words in these documents to understand them :-)

  

To make sure I'm not way off off-track in reading them, could you please tell me if my superficial understanding about these documents, as mentioned in the three points below, is correct:

   a) these documents propose a new method using which the meaning of texts can be decided

   b) this new method uses only tarka; without requiring any aagama.

   c) this new method does not consider pratyaksha as a pramaana either.

  

Regards

Pradyumna
