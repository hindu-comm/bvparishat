Dear Friends,

  

I am sending you five important articles on literary criticism for your kind reading and valuable comments.

  

These articles inaugurate a new literary theory of criticism in Indian literature.

  

The theory is inspired from Sri A:di Samkara Bhagavatpu:japadah and it is formulated as a NON-RELIGIOUS theory as can be seen from its application.

  

The concepts of adhya:sam (superimposition) and apava:dam (sublation or negation) belong to science and logic.

  

adhya:sam is optical illusion seen in mirages and negation is a technique used in logic . In superimposition one phenomenon is superimposed on another like a snake on a rope in dim light by mistake; in language, it is superimposing phonemes, words, sentences on sound by wilful knowledgeand apava:dam is peeling off like therind of an onion, is uncovering one by one to reach the core. In literature, both of them are used depending on the knowledge of authorial intentionality or absence of it. If it is present, adhya:sam of it used; if not apava:dam is used to uncover it from textual clues.

  

Kindly give me a feedback.
