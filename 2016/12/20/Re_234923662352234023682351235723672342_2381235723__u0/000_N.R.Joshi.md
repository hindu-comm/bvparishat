Dear Dr. B. Mishra,

I have posted a lot of information on this subject on BVP. I feel uncomfortable to write the same thing after many years. I am giving you a reference tothe book.----The Persian Empire by Dr. Ernst Herzfeld. You may find it in your library.The book describes 20 satrapies of the Persian empire. If you find a couple of names familiar to you,please let me and I will then add more information. Thanks for your interest. N.R.Joshi

Dear Dr Joshi,

You seem to suggest what a good study of Mahabharata should be.

It also would suggest that you have some studies done. Is it not

appropriate to detail your findings out for the benefit of others?

I personally would certainly deeply appreciate. We are trying to

create boundaries for our India Geography segment as we speak.

Your paper could be an asset.

Best regards,

BM
