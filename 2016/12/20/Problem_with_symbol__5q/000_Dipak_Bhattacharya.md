Dear friends,

My computer developed a problem. Could anyone help?

Formerly various symbols were available with the TNR script. Some like Æ,Å are missing at present. The symbols do not show up in the list of symbols if the TNR. I have to take recourse to scripts developed in India.

Has Unicode curtailed its repository?

Best
