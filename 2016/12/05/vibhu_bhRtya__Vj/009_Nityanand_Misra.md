This is interesting, so there exists a reading with भृत्य, and perhaps Böhtlingk and Taranatha Tarkavachaspati had this reading.

  

Of विभुः स्यात्स्वामिनित्ययोः and विभुः स्यात्स्वामिभृत्ययोः, only one can be the correct reading. It makes sense for vibhu to mean nitya, as it means omnipotent/omnipresent, etc. But meaning as a servant? Sounds suspicious. Unless some examples or justifications can be offered, I would think that the original reading in Trikandashesha was नित्य which got corrupted to भृत्य due to some scribal error.
