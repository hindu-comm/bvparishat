Not too surprising.

  

Bohtlingk is notorious for tampering with the readings of texts. Arrogance unlimited, plus norms of textual criticism thrown unto winds, he has deliberately and mischievously "rectified" texts without as much as a decent warning to the readers, and misled scores of subsequent scholars.

  

Simply reprehensible.
