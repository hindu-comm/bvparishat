Thanks for sharing. Parts II and V were available on scribd:

I do not know if parts III and IV are available anywhere.

  

Around a year ago, I called MLBD several times to see if a complete set exists in any of their outlets. They could not find it. I even contacted Satyavrata Shastri Ji, the great son of the great author. He said he had a full set with him at his residence. He offered to get it photocopied but I did not press as I did not want to trouble him. If somebody in Delhi can meet him (I have his residence address and contact number) and request him for volumes III and IV and make them available online, it would be great. I am sure the late Charudeva Shastri and Satyavrata Shastri will be more than happy to make the entire set freely available.

  

It is sad that Motilal Banarsidass have not republished the work. I can understand their constraints, there is simply not much demand for such books these days, and Kindle/EPUB is probably the only way. There is hope. Last Friday, ET had an article on Kindle books being available in five Indian languages. I have not checked if their spec has changed, earlier Unicode Devanagari was not supported on Kindle.
