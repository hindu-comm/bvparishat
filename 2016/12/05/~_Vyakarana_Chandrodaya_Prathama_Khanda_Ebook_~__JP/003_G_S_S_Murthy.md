Thanks. I have downloaded Vol I from Archiv.Org. But it looks like downloading from Scribd is now constrained ( Several years back I uploaded some of mine, when everything was free). If Mishraji could make scribd volumes available over "We transfer" or similar site I would be grateful.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
