**About the book**: This is the magnum-opus of Mahakavi Sri Kavi Karnapur, where he displays his extraordinary devotional scholarship and mastery over Sanskrit grammar, kāvya and alaṅkāra-śāstra. The main alaṅkāra used in this grantha is 'yamaka'. Sri Kavi Karnapur harmoniously blends the already sweet Krishna-līlā with the brilliance of his artistic capabilities. This work was later commented upon by the great Srila Vishwanath Chakravarti Thakur. The Hindi translation of Sri Vanamali Das Shastri is based on that commentary (named 'Sukha-varttanī') of Srila Vishwanath Chakravarti Thakur.
