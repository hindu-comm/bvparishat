Dear Dr. H. N. Bhat,

  

  Thanks for sharing this digital file for the Siddhanta Kaumudi.
For some reason, my Microsoft Word \[for Mac\] does not show the characters, but only boxes in their place. However, I opened the file with OpenOffice, and the Devanagari text is fully readable. Thanks, once again for this gift. With best wishes,

  

Madhav Deshpande

Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA
