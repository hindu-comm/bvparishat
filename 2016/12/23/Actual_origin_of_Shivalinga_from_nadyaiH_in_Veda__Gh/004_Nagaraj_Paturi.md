My post that is taken up for discussion by the scholar venerable for me on account of my respect for ascetics is addressed to the audience in the list who appreciate a methodology that is balanced between modern historical critical approach anda cultural relativistrespect for an insider's view of a cultural element.



Fortunately or unfortunately, for good or bad, I can not afford to completely negate certain framework of modern academics as an ascetic not inside that system can.



It may also be noted that I avoided sectarian Vedantic stances or stances from the perspective of a certain Dars'ana or the other. 



Saakaarain the sense ofanthropomorphic and niraakaarain the sense ofuniconic or non-anthropomorphic in my post is limited to the classification of images only not applicable to the classification of views of Brahman or classification of upaasanaa methods.



I was discussing Puranas not the Vedas. That Puranas were composedduring a certain time much later to the dars'ana / s'ravaNa of the Vedas is not against a tradition insider's view. In many Puranas, we see instances where a certain cultural practice is mentioned to have been already in existence and the questioner asks why that practice is only that way not otherwise and an answer is givenin the form of a storythat explains the 'why' in that question. So toargue that a certain cultural practice must have been in existence before the question and answer about that in the above mentioned form is included in a certain Purana is not against tradition insider's point of view.



Puranas giving (probably apparently ) different /alternative answers to the 'why' of the same phenomenon or cultural practice is not unknown. Those believing in the EkavAkyatA of all Puranas have a responsibility to resolve these apparent contradictions.

is my stand purely from a modern academics framework.



My post was mainly focussed on my folk cultural study results and similar such studies by a German professor and how they can inform the question of origin being discussed. To show that I was not insisting on a folk cultural origin alone, I mentioned the yUpastambha-origin argument which is already there in modern academic circles.

  

Thanks to the venerable ascetic for his advice to me tostudy Mimamsa and Yuktivada. I will certainly employ that aspect of my knowledge when it is necessary unlike here where it is not.

  

Pranams to Swamiji.
