Namaste Paturi ji



1. This is not a witch hunting exercise or blame game. The point needs to be ‘tattva –bodha’ and not ‘ tattva –baadha’. This is where Professor Koradas post clarifying what is ‘itihAsa’ was important.

 No hard feelings, No community or sectarian feelings; Sorry if that is a matter of sensitivity to some readers.

 The subject that is being discussed is something that does hurt a ‘ miniscule’ part of ‘Global Hindus’ and largesse of ‘ Bharath : Understanding as land of Vedic Traditions in living practice’; where Ramayana and Mahabharata, Puranas, Aagamas are aligned endorsement of Veda –Sanatana Dharma. The Academicians license for free speech and analysis cannot go to paint a ‘ poor image’. If the available evidence is insufficient, go for a re-examination than imagining and relying on ‘ inaccurate interpretations’. The discussions just in this thread have shown how poor are the tools provided by oriental linguists to understand the ‘Vedas’. 



You are asking \< in which the practitioner-fills / doesāvāhanā of- the dēvatātattva into hisown body,and is as per nārudrō rudramarchayēt . True, but the point there was **in what way does it compel a phallic view** or in **what way my post under reference at that point was going against this view ?**\> 



***This is tracing the post history**** (- certainly a time wasting exercise) .*



You wrote On Wed 12/28/2016 1:49 PM – Point 1-6 ; and this was responding to Ajit Gargeswari - Wed, Dec 28, 2016 at 10:21 PM, which went back to Swami Lalitalalitha post of Wed 12/28/2016 5:33 AM – again going back to Your response on Fri 12/23/2016 1:33 PM and that going deep down to ‘nadyaih’.

On Fri, Dec 23, 2016 at 11:58 AM, Nagaraj Paturi \<[nagara...@gmail.com]()\> wrote: Meaning in use of Shivalinga means meaning with which worshippers of Shivalinga look at it

a\. as documented in the past literature such as12th century Veerashaiva literature and non-sectarian Kavyas (e.g. Raghavendra Vijaya mentions Gururaya Raghavendrateertharu worshipping Shivalinga in certain Kshetras during his teerthayatras) 

b\. as found in the present day worshippers of Shivalinga (no worshipper of Shivalinga worships it with the view that he is worshipping the phallus of Shiva. ) .



This is the legacy of post.



***The response to your present post is linked to your 8 point response made earlier ****(- where the post had already consumed too much of bandwidth under nadyaih ) .*



a\) The phallic view is not an issue for worshippers making nyasa ? How would you explain the nyasa \< Prajanane Brahma rakshatu …. \> No need to elaborate. This is not about the sensitivity of ‘ already committed worshippers’. This is about the Text –Statement- practice evidence and
a ‘ need to plug a hole, which is currently open for poking and at a later date, for misinterpretation’.



 This is prone to be constructed by \< Uneducated' Indians(those who are not informed of Puranic narratives nor of the modern Englisheducation -born matters, they are very big in size among common worshippers) \> as endorsing the \< phallus worship –concealed. 



 In this thread, the ‘ Purana quotes’ did fly high.



b\) When a Yoga-symbolism of worship is transported to the portal of folklore and ‘ history-accommodated interpretations’ as in the post points by you below, there is all the chance for later ‘selective extraction specialists to push the negative view and hurt the stand of tradition.



 If the \< point -1 post note by you below> stands as a ‘ cat on the wall model’ in explaining the ‘ stand of tradition’, then the very act of ‘ failure to make homogenous construction’ of textual resource will remain an open gaping hole ! If you need how a single hole left open in the past in explaining the ‘ (Veda / History of India’, please refer to Professor Michael Witzel blistering attack on David Frawley / NS Rajaram on one point of ‘Ashwa’ interpretation in Purusha Sukta X-90. 



 The interpretation of Vedic resources have been at divergence not only on high plane of Adhyatma traditions; but also on down to earth , Nation-Civilization History- Practices Construction and explanation.
One need to define what stand one is taking in explaining a sensitive part of tradition. 



 What is the ‘ **narrative- alternative position?** Is it some thin like poorva-paksha or ‘ iti kechit’ ?? This is not about \<Western researchers method of giving a Samskruth word meaning> . This is what the Native Scholar of tradition holds as ‘ Official position on how Samskruth word should be interpreted and Text document meaning (Padaartha- Vaakyartha samanvaya) needs to be done. Don’t we have a traditional understanding of the word ‘ oordhva retas’ prior to 800 C.E different from what the modern lexicographer documents?

The conclusion of your position on point 7 and 8 make you neither an insider defender of tradition or an outright demolisher of tradition. It is a goodie –goodie central position of comfort, that does not suit the Battle :Samskrut scenario. There is no known resource or way to \<
balance the historical critical interpretations going against tradition> without deconstructing the ‘ Veda –history model’ and reestablishing the \< Vedartha Nirnaya through Saanga Shadanga Samshodhana ( beyond Vedanta- Tatparya nirnaya) \> , which needs to be done only by the HOME –TEAM with NATIVE and NATIONAL RESORUCES.
Whetehr one uses ‘ itihAsa or Purana for bringing out ‘Vedartha’ is a decisive issue here; and language tools usage is critical. 

 ‘Hindu’ is a broad umbrella, under which ‘Vedic Brahmana’ is a 2% or less stock. And if \<Brahmana> needs to be Veda-defender and Global Authentic spokes person / Defender / Guardian of ‘VEDA (Brahmano asya mukham aaseet … Vidyaa ha vai Brahmanam aajagaama Gopaaya maam..> , then gear up with the right resources and tools. This is the Battle : Samskrutham ( starting with the defense of Chandas and Bhashaa) from Anglicised Sanskrit. 



The following is extract from your earlier post for a re-read: 



1. In which post during the present discussion, through which words did I express any लज्जा or embarrassment or aversion foror negation of the Purana - narratives that lead to the Phallic view of Shivalinga?



2\. In my posts in the origin- thread to this thread , I was talking of good lexicographical practice and there too I , in all my posts , mentioned that the lexicographer,during his mention of narratives dealing with the origin of Shivalinga, should mention both the Fire-column narrative and phallus narrative as alternatives to each other.



3\. It may be noted that in the very title of the present thread, I put the word 'actual' between single inverted commas, meaning thatwhat I was going to say in the post was not going to be claimed by me asTHE (only) actual origin of Shivalinga; my intention was to bring to the notice of the readers/ list members non-Puranic analyses of the origin of the image of Shiva that is being called as (Shiva) linga. **Such analyses, whether one likes it or not, do exist; it is not a crime to keep the list /forum informed of such analyses orshare or bring into discussion such analyses**.



4\. It is not unusual, moreover it is quite regular,in this forum to speak within the parameters of modern academic methodology. For that matter, the very originof the present thread, the other thread was about a western researcher's method of giving meaning to a Sanskrit word.



5\. Throughout my discussions **I was trying to reflect how the actual worshippers of today receive the Shivalinga**. 'Uneducated' Indians(those who are not informed of Puranic narratives nor of the modern Englisheducation -born matters, they are very big in size among common worshippers) do not even know that there is a phallic interpretation. I was also mentioning how the ancient time worshippers' reception/ viewof the same is (documented) in (the Vachanas and other literature of ) Virashaivism.



6\. Theūrdhvarēta(ska) image ofṣiva etc.have a very clear Puranic connection and are understood from that perspective.



7\. I shall continue to balancethe historical critical interpretations going against tradition insider's understanding with my cultural relativist tradition insiders view, my tradition being a Vedic-folk culturalbroader'Hindu' tradition and my target audience being those informed by the methods of the contemporary academics.



8\. I shall continue to respect ascetics, that respect not affecting my adherence to my position.
