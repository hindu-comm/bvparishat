Thank you for this post. I hope that posts like these will be posted by members more often which can lead to further systematic studies on anthropomorphic, historical, iconographic, religious, linguistically studies keeping in mind the various cross currents of free thinking including tantra Buddhism and Jainism ran concurrently through Indian history and one has to make deep inter disciplinary studies in different areas and put tentative conclusion for further research than simply quoting a single epic or quotes from puranas and say that there is conclusive evidence where as the case is not. We should not fall into the trap of trying to simply misinterpreting puranic and dharma shastra texts by quoting them out of contexts or quoting them selectively to prove our view is there in them and hence its justified and argue endlessly.

Regards

Ajit Gargeshwari
