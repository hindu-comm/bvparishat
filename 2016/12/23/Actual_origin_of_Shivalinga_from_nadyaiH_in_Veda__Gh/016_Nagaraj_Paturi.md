Sir,

  

The present thread is a new one. Created just for the purpose of a digression from the issue of lexicographical practice. (The issue there was linguistic. How the word 'linga' in one of its big number of senses, namely, non-anthropomorphicimage of Shiva , has been being represented in dictionaries directly as 'Shiva's phallus'; whereas the fact is that the word in that sense is being used in reference to an object used for worship as a representation of Shiva and that that object is said to be Shiva's phallus in some Puranas is additional information outside the meaning in use of that word. )

  

The issue in the present thread is not focussed on the word linga. It is focussed on theobject used for worship as a representation of Shiva. How that object could have come to be used for worship as a representation of Shiva ?

  

There are two answers given to this question in Puranas: 1. It is the Shiva's phallus 2. It is the creation-dissolving fire-column.

  

One way is to shut my eyes to any other answer to this question from any other source, as a strict adherent to the tradition of Puranas.

  

There are answers given by archaeologists and historians. I am a culture researcher myself by my career. I study these issues and give my answers.

  

What I did is to share the answers given by archaeologists and historiansand the results of my own study.

  

I thought not to insist that any of these answers is THE correct answer was a good practice.

  

With this, I withdraw from this discussion.
