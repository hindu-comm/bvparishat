Itâ€™s very difficult to change misconceptions that have crept in on Tantrik Practices and mixing them with orthodox worship and making generalisation based on weak grounds. When one reads biased books one gets the impression that all Shaivites are phallus worshipers and will suit the convenience of a few. The case is not so is what I have pointed out. Tantrika vaidika, Buddhist, folk and other practices have their own place in the cultural heritage on India and the picture and studies will be left incomplete if one avoids or does not include these studies. One has to make systematic multi disciplinary studies keeping the historical and cultural contexts to arrive if not a conclusion one can reach a working hypothesis.

Unfortunately many good discussion ends up in prolonged debates and abrupt endings leaving the learners frustrated.
