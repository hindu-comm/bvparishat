Namaste

  

This thread has generated many cross- issues: ( and answered part by part).

In this post,

A).  the Samskruth word translation in an inappropriate way with a pointer to Monier Williams/ later period .

I have made repeated reminders for A Samskruth Vocabulary : Review of Translations floating around, starting from Monier Williams, with Traditional resources as standard of measure ( using vyakarana - nirukta- paribhashaas).

Till that is done,...

Let us wish some one will step forward to team up and work, beyond taking fall- back on previous print resources of post 17th century!

  

B\) On \< first hand or otherwiseof the 'ground practice' of 'Body- anchored Mantra-Yoga'*involving Shiva-linga worship*? \>You are trained in traditional worship system; and just need a pointer. Please explore the Mahanyasa poorvaka rudraabhishekha where the Mantra-Nyasa is the Mantra- Yoga on Saadkakas Body as a part of Shiva worship. Shivo bhootvaa Shivam Yajet.

The living practice is a greater proof than a journal report in these matters.
