\> The discussion on ( Shiva-)- (Linga-)- upaasanaa has taken a turn from where it started!

  

----- Sir, if your reference is to the present thread or the thread leading to the present one, it did not start with any discussion on any upaasanaa sir. In the previous thread leading to the present thread, the (Shiva) linga part of the posts were focussed on the issue of lexicographical practice.

  

\> Swamy ji is right in putting the 'vision of Shiva based on tradition' - as primary over the ' intellectual and imagined regurgitation' of anthropological constructs.

  

------- Sir, can you please point out which part of my post are you describing as anthropological *constructs ?* If you have my reporting that shepherd communities worship a piece of a stone, that is not a 'construct' sir, that is an ethnographic report. That they view the Shivalinga of Srisailam, being called Mallikarjuna, as their Malhari /Mallanna only is also an ethnographic report of their actual view and practice from my first hand fieldwork.

  

\> This happens when ' Yoga' behind a practice is forgotten and ground practice of Body- anchored Mantra-Yoga is not recognized.

  

------- May I request you to enlighten me with the report, ethnographic or otherwise, first hand or otherwiseof the 'ground practice' of 'Body- anchored Mantra-Yoga' ?

  

I fail to understand the connection between the Ardhanaarees'vara concept and the Shivalinga's phallic view. In any case, regarding the kaula tantra etc., may I recollect your post in another list

and try here again to get the opportunity to read the exact words from the Tantra texts, analysing /describing ordaining the Shivalinga worship as worship of Shiva's phallus ?
