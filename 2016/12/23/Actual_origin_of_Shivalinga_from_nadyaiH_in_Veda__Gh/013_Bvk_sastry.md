Namaste Paturi ji

  

You are pushing sensitive issues, especially on Tantra part, which if separated from the vedanta backdrop, will make this debate uncivilized.

In short, as it came in earlier posts, when ' vini-yoga' (- Dr. Yadus post) of ' veda-tantra-Yoga' got corrupted due to Anglo-Amor in India, the Samskruth Word meanings suffered distortion-dilution- digestion.
Outcome is the cry for Battle: Sanskrit.

In this thread itself,

First, we had a flood of discussion where the meaning of the word ' linga' in relation to shiva worship went for a toss. The non- traditional view was pushed to sully the live tradition. ( oordhva-retas issue). The impact of this would push a question like how to explain a IVC seal of yogi in meditation! And understand history of yoga.

  

Second, issue of mistranslations cropped in to the discussion. Abundant web extracts of lexicons.

  

Third, tantra practices got drawn in to the thread.

  

The narrative of Srisailam has two perspectives: one from Purana perspective of jyotirlinga and shaktipeetha; second is local version of tribes worship. Each stands on its own merit, language and faith. The amalgamation of 'mango and salt' to make a pickle to sell- is a commercialized Srisailam history and Trilinga desham-is an academic process, which finds many flavored journal report model documentation.

  

As a study of ethnography, anthropology, the scholars reporting is highly acclaimed and respected. But the flavor of cross connections , introduced from the scholar-academia, to ruse that folklore is the mother seed of yoga- ritual practices is questionable. Why would a scholar do such an error ? Three reasons: Please the Boss to get a publication, Anglo-Amor accepting the whitemans writing as faultless; lack of home- ground scholarship and courage to defend the tradition impartially .

  

It is the last part where the ' break- down of Unified Samskruth studies (Shadanga Veda adhyayana/ Saanga veda adhyayana) in India needs to be acknowledged and corrected. How many scholars of Veda do we have around who will present a given veda sukta, say Purusha sukta ( without bringing in vedantaacharya flavors) in line with Yaska-Patanjali -Sayana guidance compared to vedic studies under the framework provided by orientalist? The outcome of such sides taking and fence sitting is the problem of Shiva worship we are discussing here.

  

It is in this backdrop, my earlier note on Tantra and the word ' uma-dehardha-dharinam' needs to be seen. If tradition has seen Shiva - linga- worship as one unified mantra yoga practice, presented in Lingaashtaka, And orientalists make a piecemeal break up of this and make journal reports, who is at fault?

  

On \<One must look for the exact wordsfrom the tantra texts in this respect to be able discuss that aspect.>." True. The words in Text have to be taken for their exact meaning. What is exact word meaning? It is domain specific technicality= paribhashaa of Tantra, which is different from lexical resource based translations. If one goes to the root explanation and yoga practices related to tantra words like \< yoni- mudraa, trikhandeshi>, \< bhaga-maalinee> etc; in conjunction with \<chidagnikunda-sambhootaa> the stand of tradition will be clear. So also, the fallacy of ' phallus worship'.

  

It hurts the pride. But if we dont recognize the ground reality, efficient action can not be triggered beyond a ' band-aid' cure for cancer.
