There are Puranic narratives 'explaining' why Shiva is not worshipped in the form of a saakaara moorti but is worshipped only in the form of a niraakaara linga. It is explained there that it is Bhrigu Maharshi's curse to Shiva. (BTW, the curse does not meantion, "You shall be worshipped in the form of your phallus" ).

  

But is it true that Shiva is not worshipped in a saakaara , in modern paralance 'anthropomorphic', form at all?

  

It is not true.

  

Shiva is worshipped in the form of Naaraja, various forms of Dakshinamurty, what modern archaeologists and iconographyexperts call Sadashiva, Sarangapani (saarangapaaNi) and other such forms which are clearly anthropomorphic. 

  

Thus the observation (that Shiva is worshipped as linga only ) 'explained ' by the story of Bhrigu's curse itself is not an adequate observation. The story must have come into existence much later to the establishment of Shivalinga as an object of worship and must have been an attempt to explain the partially informed observation mistaking it for a full observation.

  

Similarly the stories trying to 'explain' the origin of Shivalinga either as the cooled down fire-column or Shiva's phallus must be later to the actual establishment of Shivalinga as an object of worship.

  

Outside this mythological space and time, in the historical space and time, the origin of the uniconic object as the image of Shiva must have been different from what the stories narrate it to be.

  

Puranic / Agamic culture (that is being called 'Hindu' culture today) is a syncretism between the Vedic and folk cultures. Is the Shivalinga a contribution from the Vedic or the folk side?

  

On the folk side, there are numerous instances of non-anthropomorphic shaped objects /images being worshipped. Shepherd caste people called as Kurumas in Telangana, Kurubas in Karnataka and southern Andhra Pradesh (both studied by me for nearly 30years) , Dhangars in Maharashtra (studied by the German professor Gunther Sontheimer and the study published in his "Pastoral Deities in Western India, ), worship an oval shaped naturally formed stone on any hill that they come across during their sheep grazing expeditions as the representation /image of their caste god Mallanna /Mailara / Malhari / [Khandoba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khandoba)and as a sample of the hill itself which is the deity Mallanna /Mailara / Malhari / [Khandoba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khandoba)for them(They worship this deity in the form an anthropomorphic image in their homes and shrines). Interestingly they consider this god to be a form (Avatara) of Shiva only. Prof. Gunther Sontheimer in the above mentioned book, among other things, explains the commonalities of Malhari with the Vedic Rudra.

  

In the south India, village goddess worship includes the worship of two uniconic stone images: one, called Potraj /Potaraju , kept beside the image of the goddess (ammaa/ammaavar/ammavaaru ) and the other called, in Telugu, Bodrai /Boddu rayi (boDDu rAyi), literal. navel stone a Shiva linga-like stone posted in front of a neem tree. The stone is called navel because that is the centre from which the residences in the village are spread around in aconventional form. The offerings to the village goddess, which, I argued in my publications, is the personification of the village eco-system, are offered to/through the navel stone. 

  

Researchers of these cultures in the south, quite often, view these non-anthropomorphicuniconicimages of the male deities Potraj, Bodrai etc.,as the origin of Shivalinga.

  

Researches who wanted to trace the origin of Shivalinga in Vedic culture, proposed yUpasthambha as the origin.

  

Whatever is the 'actual' source, the interpretations of the image as creation-dissolving fire-column or Shiva's fallus thrown down on the earth, are attempts to'explain' an image that was already in existence.

  

Among such explanations, the explanation that it is the creation dissolvingfire-column goes down well with the devotees because Shiva as a member of the Trimurti formula is viewed ashaving the function of laya, devolution of the creation.

  

abhishEkapriyatva of Shivalinga etc., match well with the fire-view.

  

Rudra's features too match well with the fire-view.

  

Virashaivism and other such Shaivite traditions take it much beyond the limited trimoorti-member role thatis, the laya role and equate Shivalinga with the ultimate spiritual concept equivalent of Vedic Parabrahman.
