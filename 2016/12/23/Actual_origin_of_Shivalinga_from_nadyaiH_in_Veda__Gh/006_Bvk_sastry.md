Namaste

Sri Laliatalaalita swamy is right.

  

1\. The discussion on ( Shiva-)- (Linga-)- upaasanaa has taken a turn from where it started!

  

2\. Swamy ji is right in putting the 'vision of Shiva based on tradition' - as primary over the ' intellectual and imagined regurgitation' of anthropological constructs.

  

3\. This happens when ' Yoga' behind a practice is forgotten and ground practice of Body- anchored Mantra-Yoga is not recognized.

  

There is nothing in Body that is ' impure and unworthy of use as a starting point to realize Shiva. These technical doors are not open to all!

  

4\. How and where does one see these footprints in tradition? I just provide pointers. These are not for those people with sensuous sensitivity for victorian language and ' averse to victorias secret drapes that make more exposure than they conceal'. If Shiva is not averse to be ' umaa-dehaardha-dhaaree' why are his bhaktas averse to parts / Half of his body? Do they teach to see shiva with one eye? Here are the pointers:

  

4a) Srividya Kaula Tantra unifications- as practiced in Kashmir to Kanyakumari, including the sacred portals at Trilinga- desha

And shaktipeetha traditions.

  

4b) Contemplate on iconic representation of Shiva in Lakuleesha Paashupata Darshana, which is a valid Saiva darshana.

These are visual forms of shiva in sacred art, yoga and tantra since 800 AD.

  

So what is Shiva- linga- upaasanaa?

Is a contextual guidance and not segmented debate.
