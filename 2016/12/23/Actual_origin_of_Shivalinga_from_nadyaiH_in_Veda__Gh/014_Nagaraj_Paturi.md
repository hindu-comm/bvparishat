Prof. Sastryji,

  

mahanyāsa pūrvaka rudrābhiṣēka of śivalinga is certainly a procedure in which the practitioner-fills / doesāvāhanā of- the dēvatātattva into hisown body,and is as per nārudrō rudramarchayēt . True, but the point there was in what way does it compel a phallic view or in what way my post under reference at that point was going against this view ?
