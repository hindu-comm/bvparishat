There are different cults and many religious practices that are and were prevalent. I agree with that there are tantric and esoteric elements but that does not make all shaivites phallic worshipers. Not all trantrikas resort to esoteric practices. Not all tantrikas are ‘Viras’. Not all shaivites do resort to esoteric practices. Not all tantrikas are shaivites neither are all shaivites Tantrikas. Pasupatha and such other cult and their iconography was not main stream thinking in the past nor are they today. One can see any or all religious idols from different views but one need not stress and generalise one minority view and say all shaivites are some primitive tribals and phallus worshipers.



Prof Sastry ji is right when he says different heterogeneous tradition get mixed up and if the complete perspective is not grasped then many esoteric traditions practices methods and their philosophy appear to be obnoxious but is essence they are not. They are all aids to sadhakas to achieve his or her goal to get liberated. To understand higher physics and mathematics one needs to go to universities or read the right books. Similarly esoteric practices are and were meant for the initiated and not for theoretical arguments. There is a lot of philosophical social, psychological, physical and other elements is practice. Several good anthropological historic studies have been done on these elements. One can read and interpret shaivism from different perspectives from the bibliography that was given in an earlier post.
