I noticed that a wrong translation of ūrdhvaretas as ithyphallic has become widespread now. ithyphallic means erect pennis, whereas ūrdhvaretas means celibate.

  

By the time of Monier Williams or Apte this wrong meaning was not there. Sharing snapshots from both.

  

So the mistranslation must have started recently.
