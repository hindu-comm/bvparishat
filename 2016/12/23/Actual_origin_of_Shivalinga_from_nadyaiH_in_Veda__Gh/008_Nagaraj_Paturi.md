1\. In which post during the present discussion, through which words did I express any लज्जा or embarrassment or aversion foror negation of the Purana - narratives that lead to the Phallic view of Shivalinga?

  

2\. In my posts in the origin- thread to this thread , I was talking of good lexicographical practice and there too I , in all my posts , mentioned that the lexicographer,during his mention of narratives dealing with the origin of Shivalinga, should mention both the Fire-column narrative and phallus narrative as alternatives to each other.

  

3\. It may be noted that in the very title of the present thread, I put the word 'actual' between single inverted commas, meaning thatwhat I was going to say in the post was not going to be claimed by me asTHE (only) actual origin of Shivalinga; my intention was to bring to the notice of the readers/ list members non-Puranic analyses of the origin of the image of Shiva that is being called as (Shiva) linga. Such analyses, whether one likes it or not, do exist; it is not a crime to keep the list /forum informed of such analyses orshare or bring into discussion such analyses.

  

4\. It is not unusual, moreover it is quite regular,in this forum to speak within the parameters of modern academic methodology. For that matter, the very originof the present thread, the other thread was about a western researcher's method of giving meaning to a Sanskrit word.

  

5\. Throughout my discussions I was trying to reflect how the actual worshippers of today receive the Shivalinga. 'Uneducated' Indians(those who are not informed of Puranic narratives nor of the modern Englisheducation -born matters, they are very big in size among common worshippers) do not even know that there is a phallic interpretation.
I was also mentioning how the ancient time worshippers' reception/ viewof the same is (documented) in (the Vachanas and other literature of ) Virashaivism.

  

6\. Theūrdhvarēta(ska) image ofṣiva etc.have a very clear Puranic connection and are understood from that perspective.

  

7\. I shall continue to balancethe historical critical interpretations going against tradition insider's understanding with my cultural relativist tradition insiders view, my tradition being a Vedic-folk culturalbroader'Hindu' tradition and my target audience being those informed by the methods of the contemporary academics.

  

8\. I shall continue to respect ascetics, that respect not affecting my adherence to my position.
