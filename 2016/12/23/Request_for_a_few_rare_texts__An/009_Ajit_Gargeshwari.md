I am not sure if Gaudapadabhshya on the Nrisimha-Uttara-Tapaniya Upanishad has ever been published. I would be interested if anyone has a copy of such a book. It would always be useful to include editors name and publication details to make it easier for other to easily search

Dear Ajitji,

Thank you for the Shankarabhashyas. I am now looking for the Gaudapadabhshya on the Nrisimha-Uttara-Tapaniya Upanishad.

Regards,

Sunil KB

Dear Ajitiji,

I failed to find these three Shankara-bhshyas and one Gaudapada-bhshya in DLI as well as in Google-search. That is the reason for my request to the members, and that certainly includes you too. In the past several kind members helped me find some books, which I could not find and I also helped some members with books which they had difficulty in
finding. I shall be grateful if you can help me find these four books,

Regards,

Sunil KB

Do you search DLI or archives at all? Do you expect list members to search and send texts. I can understand if it a particular edition a rare book or article if you are looking at the the list members will surely help.

Dear friends,  
  
I shall be thankful if any scholar can let me know as to how to find a copy (preferably pdf) each of Shankara-bhashya on SanatSujatiya, Svetashvatara uanishad and Nrsimha-Purva-Tapaniya Upanishad as well as of Gaudapada-vashya on Nrisimha-Uttara-Tapaniya Upanishad.
