dear vidvaj-janas,  
  
i'm planning to start some threads on how to sing specific meters. Vidvāns can contribute their recordings of how they sing these meters so that we all can get to know different styles of singing the same meter in a single thread.  
  
The meter i am posting today is Pṛthvī. The verse that i've sung is as follows:  
  
अनर्पितचरीं चिरात्करुणयावतीर्णः कलौ ।  
समर्पयितुमुन्नतोज्ज्वलरसां स्वभक्तिश्रियम् ॥  
हरिः पुरटसुन्दरद्युतिकदम्बसन्दीपितः।  
सदा हृदयकन्दरे स्फुरतु वः शचीनन्दनः ॥  
  
**Link for recitation**: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdOzG_oKjCA>  
  
Interested vidvāns kindly suggest your own styles of singing this meter by posting a recording here or on youtube. Please feel free to select any verse of your choice in the Pṛthvī meter.  
  
sādhu-caraṇa-rajo 'bhilāṣī,  
  
hari parshad das.
