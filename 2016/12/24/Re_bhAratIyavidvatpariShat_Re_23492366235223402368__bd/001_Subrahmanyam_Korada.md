नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Thank you very much Vid Harinarayana Bhatta .

  

In fact , I forgot the source - the verse is quoted in commentaries of शाकुन्तलम् etc.

  

\>Youcannotfindsuchmeanings\<

  

  

Exactly . Prof Joshi may note that Dictionaries offer the popular meanings only.

  

Repeatedly I have been suggesting - one should learn with the help of a गुरु at least to some extent .

  

There is gulf of difference between self learning and learning from a गुरु ।

  

धन्यो’स्मि
