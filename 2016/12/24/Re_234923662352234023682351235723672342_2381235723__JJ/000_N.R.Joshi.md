Dizzing amount information of Shiva Linga from mundane level to highly mystic level. Is there simplied version of Hindu religion ?



or Hindu religion means multitudes of opinions of hundreds of Pandits over thousands of years never reaching definite conclusion. Say both sides are correct and take it to OM or Brahma and then everythingbecomes holy. N.R.Joshi.

Irrespective of what Mahabharata or Vamana Purana says and which you can quote, which is again subjected to interpretations and interpolations it would be best if you would share you reviewed paper. There are arguments to show that that “The meaning “Œiva in the form of a phallus” is not correct and Shaivaites don’t worship any Phallus. There are many schools among of Shaivites one has to consider this as well. Thanks

..The practice of referring the sources in Böhtlingk and Roth's Book is different than what you thought.

I would rather write an article showing Böhtlingk and Roth are correct quoting linja is popularly called Phallus of Shiva quoting Mahabharata and Vamana Purana.
