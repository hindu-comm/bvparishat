Dear All,  
Namaste!  
We at Shree Somnath Sanskrit University have included the first volume of Ashtadhyayee Bhashya prathamaa vrutti of Brahmadatta Jignaasu as a part of our curriculum. Can anyone please help finding the pdf of the same so that I can circulate it among the teachers and the students apart from ordering the book for those who desire.  
  
Dhanyavaadaah!
