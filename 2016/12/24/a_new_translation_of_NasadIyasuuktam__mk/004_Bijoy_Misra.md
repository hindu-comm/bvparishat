Dr. Basu and Dr. Achar,

I would love an advance copy of the paper.

Through our India Discovery Center, we are doing our Seminar on

the Vedic Period on Jan 21. I am attaching our announcement.

We create six tracks: Geography and People, Art and Culture,

Language and Literature, Philosophy and Religion, Science

and Technology, Economy and Politics. Please help us with

any recent work on the subject. We would respectfully

acknowledge.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
