Respected all,  
  

This has reference with the structure and organization of the Rgveda.  
  
In the WAVES International 2016 conference, Prof. Narahari Achar has shown that the Somayajna forms the basis for the structure and organization of the Rgveda, which mirrors its performance as far as the required rcas are concerned. Mandala 1 lays out a plan for recitations at the three savanas, Mandalas 2-8 reflect that plan, 9th mandala forms the nabhi, 10th mandala contains rcas for recitation at Somayajna, the entire 10 mandala samhita is one unit and compiled at one time. the 1st and 10th mandalas have the same number of suktas and this gives an endless structure to it, the beginning and end are indistinguishable, hence It is a mandala.  
  

According to him, "the 1000 and odd suktas envisioned and given expression to by some 400 rshis over a period spanning some 1000 years still exhibit a unity and an organic binding...Various identities establish the equivalence of yajna and samvatsara and hence there is an astronomical basis for chronology..."  

  
Please wait for the publication of the article where he has explained each of his such statements and given well organized reasons towards his conclusion.
