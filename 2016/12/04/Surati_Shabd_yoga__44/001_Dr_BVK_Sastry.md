Namaste



1. \< Su-Rati Shabda Yoga> is a drilled down model and flavored practice of Yoga under the branching as \<Yoga / Ishwara –Pranidhana /
Swadhyaya / Mantra-Yoga/ \> where



1a) the specific understanding of Ishwara-Pranidhana is taken as ‘ Bhajan- Keertan- Prarthana - Japa- Naama Samkeertana –Dhyana –Chintana’
depending upon the teaching school.

1b) Iswara is explained as ‘ Sri Krishna with Radha’

1c) Mantra is taken specific under the Bhagavata Katha - lineage of Bhakti.



Surati Shabda-Yoga is for those who seek ultimate vision of Raam ‘Darshan’; and not for those who want to dig the ‘ history- historicity - politics of Raam’.





2. On \< I need to learn how this yoga> , Please check with the ‘ Masters of Tradition’ ; and they will decide and guide your eligibility for receiving the practice. Yoga-Engagement is not news reporting for annals OR chronicles for posterity. Yoga is a personal and personalized practice. The seeker needs to have the clarity on why this pursuit is being taken.



 IF you are making ‘ academic engagement with this Yoga’, your next question is not relevant ! IF you are ‘ seeking personal practice engagement with this Yoga’ , then also your next question is irrelevant, for your experience can not be compared to others experience. 





3. On \< **what is the ultimate sound they hear**… \> , it is for the ‘practicing group to deliberate on this, as shared personal experience and for comparing personal notes, under the guidance of a Guru ; and for the Master to validate.



 Other wise, all documentation and ‘ reported claims’ on this topic will simply get pushed under ‘ Auditory Hallucination’ – (
<http://www.webmd.com/brain/what-are-hallucinations#1> ) glorified glibly as ‘Samadhi, Self-Realization, Past-Masters Whispering in the ‘ right ear of the seeker, meditating at Himalayas or Deep forests’ et al. 



4. On \< Shri Ramanandiy Vaishnavas **believe** that this sound is Ram naam \> , It would be better to let the believers believe what they want and leave the ‘Ram Naam’ to those who want ‘Ram’.
