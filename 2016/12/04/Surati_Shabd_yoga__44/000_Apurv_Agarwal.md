Namaste dear scholars,

  

I am looking for some basic information on Surati shabdyoga. I need to learn how this yoga is performed and if the act involves meditation or chanting.

I learned that Radha Soami sect performs this yoga in particular.

  

Also, what is the ultimate sound they hear when the reach the highest state of 'bhajan'? As no act of deliberate contemplation on sound is involved, all must be hearing the same sound that is supposed to emerge from the soul. Shri Ramanandiy Vaishnavas believe that this sound is Ram naam.

  

Please guide.

  

**Warm regards,**
