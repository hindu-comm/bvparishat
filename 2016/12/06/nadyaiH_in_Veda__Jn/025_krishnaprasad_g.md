..The practice of referring the sources in Böhtlingk and Roth's Book is different than what you thought.  
  

I would rather write an article showing Böhtlingk and Roth are correct quoting linja is popularly called Phallus of Shiva quoting Mahabharata and Vamana Purana.  
  

I am not going into whether pandits helped Böhtlingk and Roth or not. However writing such a voluminous books will not make lullaby mistakes.  

I am ready to accept challenge to prove Böhtlingk and Roth are correct in this instance. While doing big works will occur mistake as Monier Williams quotes so there may be other mistakes in  

German Worthbuch but this is not
