Thanks Professor Kannan, this is very useful. What do you think of this example, where Böhtlingk and Roth (1855) mislead by citing the authority of *Trikāṇḍaśeṣa* and *Medinī* in giving the meaning of the word *liṅga* as

  

“das göttlich verehrte Geschlechtsglied Çiva's (Rudra’s), Çiva in der Form eines Phallus”

English: “The divinely revered sexual organ of Śiva (Rudra), Śiva in the form of a phallus”

  

This is unpardonable. A Sanskrit dictionary is supposed to give meanings of words as used in Sanskrit, and not modern readings or interpretations which are controversial, to put it mildly. When both *Trikāṇḍaśeṣa* and *Medinī* give many meanings of the word *liṅga* and give the male organ and Śiva’s *mūrti* as separate meanings, what gives Böhtlingk and Roth the authority to imagine things and combine two meanings into one, that too citing the authority of famous Sanskrit lexicons? Even if Böhtlingk and Roth and people in their time in Europe misunderstood *śivaliṅga* to be the sexual organ of Śiva, is this skulduggery justified in a dictionary? Were Böhtlingk and Roth compiling meanings in which Sanskrit words were/are used by Sanskrit speaking peoples or were they compiling meanings as understood in the West?

  

Monier Williams (1872), needless to say, simply copies from Böhtlingk and Roth and gives the meaning as “Śiva's genital organ or Śiva worshipped in the form of a Phallus”

  

Compare this with how the Ceylonese (Sri Lankan) Buddhist commentator C A Seeakkhanda Maha Thera carefully explains the two different meanings separately in his commentary on the*Trikāṇḍaśeṣa*.

  

My experience over the years is this

1\) *Śabdakalpadrumaḥ* and *Vācaspatyam*: Very useful as they (1) give grammatical derivations (2) not only cite but also give useful extracts from both texts and famous commentaries, mostly reliable and unbiased

2\) Monier Willams: Simply copies from Böhtlingk and Roth. Useless if one can understand German, for one can directly refer to Böhtlingk and Roth.

3\) Böhtlingk and Roth: Very useful as they give many citations, generally reliable but not necessarily unbiased, there are cases where they can be misleading

  

Perhaps this is a good topic for research: *Sanskrit Lexicographers—Misleading scholars since 1850s*.
