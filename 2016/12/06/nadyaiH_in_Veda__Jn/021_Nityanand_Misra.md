I vaguely recall entries in Apte are also based on a Western dictionary. It is interesting to see that the Sabdakalpadrumah (1820s) does not have this meaning. It gives the meaning शिवमूर्त्तिविशेषः । इति मेदिनी । गे, २३ ॥ separately from शेफः which is correct and in accordance with ancient lexicons. The meaning “Śiva in the form of a phallus” (Çiva in der Form eines Phallus) is an invention of Böhtlingk and Roth and is not (rather was never) a meaning in use as you say.
