I am so happy to see such a detailed post with a long argument and analysis from Dr Gargeshwari.

  

\> There is a Puranic legend about the appearance of Siva as an effulgent, huge column of fire in front of Lord Brahma and Lord Visnu engaged in a verbal dispute about the relative superiority of each. Sculptures of the manifestation of Siva as a linga, portraying this legend are found in all the Siva temples at the back of the sanctum sanctorum.

  

------ This sculpture is called Lingodbhavamurti by archeologists, art historians and iconography experts.

Strangely , Prof.Wendy Doniger writesina few of her writings that thisimage in these sculptures wascreated in competition with the images of Narasimha form of Vishnu emergingout of a pillar. The conspicuous difference betwwen the two is that in the Narasimha Swami's image, the actual emergence of the half-lion half-human form of Vishnu is depicted whereas in the lingodbhavamurti image, the anthropomorphic Shiva image is included in the sculpture only to communicate that what/who took birth in the form of a huge column of fire is Shiva only. It does not communicate that Shiva emerges out of any pillar or column of fire or anything like that. This difference and this communication is obvious even to a common Hindu devotee observing these two images in sculptures. She probably failed to connect this image to the Puranic narrative mentioned by you.
