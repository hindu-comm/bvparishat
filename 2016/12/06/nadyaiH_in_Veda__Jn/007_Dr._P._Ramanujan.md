Dear Dr BVK Sastry!



The {wrong} citation of RV is from my database of \[hundreds of\] OCR-ed texts which have not been proof-read.

I agree with Shri Ajit in that no text that is not verified should find place in internet resource.

I have done the only thing that is possible today, (like you have very well articulated), viz. removed the texts

from public.

I have a plan to quasi-programmatically try a solution, if that could make sense.

Manually, I am yet to find a suitable, motivated scholar willing to toil for perfection in such a 'cause',

even if assured reasonable compensation. I would be happy if this could be proved wrong.

This may have something to do with our current education/societal system.



I am hopeful on that Gitacarya's assurance धर्मसंस्थापनार्थाय सम्भवामि युगेयुगे.



Ramanujan
