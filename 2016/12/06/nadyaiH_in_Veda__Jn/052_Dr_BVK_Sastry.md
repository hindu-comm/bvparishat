Namaste



1. Thanks and great initiative and work done as seen at url’s : <https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/PWG/issues/3> and
<https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS> 



The need expressed is good; the need is certainly felt. But there is
need to address the following question in greater focus and with clarity**. The ‘biggest ‘ does not mean the ‘ accurate and reliable’ by any stretch of imagination.** The good old Amarakosha still serves
good, with one tenth the vocabulary in MW.



There could be a different path to undertake your passion for a \< post-PhD work on Sanskrit Lexicography, History of the last 200 years, but it's a mega task and as I have no affiliation with a University now, no need for it. \>. Nay as an Independent research project.



The effort involves Two languages (Source and Target :: Samskruth and English /German …) using distinctly different standards of language-grammars and ‘ philosophical/ philological constructs’. The team expertise needed for such a work needs a team of scholars who understand source and target language uniqueness distinctly and have the skills to work with the technologist ( beyond a spread sheet formulation, search engine , font-rendering and the like). In the present case, the ‘ Anglo-Anchor of Technology’ is another serious barrier for progressing in this work !



2. What then are the other barrier issues ? First and foremost, limited home team resources and priority ( or rather motivation) to take up this daunting task. Second is ‘Cleaning the sullied stables of Three hundred years writings using inaccurate / inadequate representations of Vedic documents in Samskruth. In this case, the most earliest writings of ‘ Shiva worship as ‘ symbolic phallus worship’ goes back to two centuries on construction of world wide myths, cultural studies, Tantra and such exotic issues ! Example: \< In 1825 Horace Hayman Wilson's work on the lingayat sect of South India attempted to refute British notions\[specify\] that the lingam graphically represented a human organ and that it aroused erotic emotions in its devotees. -
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingam#cite_note-Pennington-20> > On the top of which there are countless publications from respected names and institutions.



Third and most important is the evolving nature of the current language technology and content- container handling systems. IF Samskrutham were a straight jacketed language that would fit the model of a ‘ data base’ and hyper text linking, probably much progress could have been made. Unfortunately , Samskruth belongs to a different class of ‘ Language Model and structure’ compared to the rest of the world-languages. This paradigm is represented in the simple expression : ‘Samskrutham –Prakrutham- Apabhramsha-Mlecchitam’ :: Refined and purified for excellence – Disassembled, Slackened – Distorted – Corrupted - Language models. And expression and modeling willfully distorted in language studies of orient. Such being the case, there is a need for revisiting the base and basics of Samskruth Lexicon construction, before heading forward with ‘ Dictionaries of Word- Meaning Equivalences across languages’. Take an illustrative example : The translation of the word ‘ Purusha’. How would a ‘ limited model word-meaning pool , called
Dictionary help and guide the user to understand the purpose and meaning of this expression ? How many correction forms would be needed to mark up all the shades of meaning that goes with this from on extreme of ‘ rest room marker for use by male’ to the esoteric extreme of ‘ Supreme Divine’ ? How will a dictionary help the decoding of the word ‘ Purusha-Sukta’ ?



3. Such being the case, which confronts the traditional scholar, to get deeply engaged with the GITHUB Lexicon review and revision project.



4. Coming to the point of OCR, Scanning and the like, Certainly they are useful. But the critical part of ‘ OCR Logic needs to be guided by the ‘ Bhashaa -Lipi-Shaastra’ Scripting convention of Language . This is NOT the same as ‘ Font designers discretion to display a graphic visual as a pixel display on screen under a given standard and OS /Application. The Linguist has little knowledge and exposure on how the ‘Techno-lingusit /Font designer and programmer is writing the logic and ‘ tolerances’ in pattern recognition.



There are further deeper problems when it comes to Voice par , which is critical for Samskruth. The current programs and standards are poorly designed for handling the ‘Accented variations in Vedas or the local dialects’.



The great interest of technologists in Samskruth is seen mainly to hover around the rule based voice primary processing of communication’ and
‘decoding’ - an effort to find a solution for Voice-recognition/ management organization in technology devices’. The love for Samskruth is a means for an end goal.



Samskruth teams are not averse to work on this issue; but the fact stands that the current OS /App / Language-Technology Research Models are poorly made to address the key issues. There are very limited persons who understand the complexities here and have time –energy and motivation to get involved for a ‘volunteering’. That does not mean they are not concerned or fail to appreciate the work done. It is a matter of prioritization and resource support.



**As this subject is of interest to a very limited number of persons, please write off forum for further deliberation and designs. **

BVK Sastry
