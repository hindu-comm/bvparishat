Nityanand Misra has quoted: "काशिका on बहुलं छन्दसि (७.१.१०)

  

छन्दसि विषये बहुलमैसादेशो भवति। अतः इत्युक्तम्, अनतो ऽपि भवति नद्यैः इति। अतो न भवति , देवेभिः सर्वेभिः प्रोक्तम् इति।"

  

For whatever reasons, neither Nyāsa nor Padamañjarī have anything to say on this comment from Kāśikā, and this raises the question about the text of the Kāśikāvṛtti itself. Was this comment of Kāśikā known to these commentators? Or did they simply ignore it? Professor Malhar Kulkarni has shown that often the text of the Kāśikā as known to the Padamañjarī was different from what is found in other manuscript traditions. I wonder if Malhar can check the manuscript readings for this line of Kāśikā. I hope he is on this list.
