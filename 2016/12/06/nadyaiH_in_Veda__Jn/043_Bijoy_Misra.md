Nagarajji,

With my observation, it is best to ignore persons like WD

and the likes. There are many. Their audience is not

Indian scholars though they flood the market to convert

and confuse. We should sympathize that some are

interested in learning about India. But we must understand

that their knowledge level is weak and command on the

language is weaker. They operate as tourists to take

pictures. Quick profile impressions are always wrong and

biased thinking is dangerous! India has to rescue herself

from the aggression! It's a task that India has to win on

behalf of herself!

Best regards,

BM
