This is an interesting discussion. Evidently the authors of the Kāśikāvṛtti found the form nadyaiḥ in some source and felt the need to discuss it. The Tattvabodhinī reference is only a secondary reference, just pointing to Kāśikā. While the Vaidika Padānukrama Kośa of Viśvabandhu does not find a single occurrence of nadyaiḥ in any known Vedic text, the authors of Kāśikā, coming from the region of Kashmir, must have found this form in some source. Even back then, it could be a manuscript error, but the error probably is not just a new OCR error.
It probably has a historical depth. Some Kashmiri manuscript probably had this variant reading.
