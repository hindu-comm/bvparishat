Would be helpful if you can point them. If you have Vamana Purana in mind, the word used in लिङ्ग which has other meanings also. My point is that that there are also descriptions of लिङ्ग as arising from a column (स्तम्भ) and being the formless (i.e. without antropomorphic features) emblem of Shiva. For example, the fifth chapter of विद्येश्वरसंहिता in शिवमहापुराण contrasts two emblems of Shiva-the लिङ्ग and the बेर (=body, i.e. the anthropomorphic form). The former is explained as निराकार (without \[anthropomorphic\] form) and said to represent the formless (निष्कल) aspect of Shiva. The latter is explained as साकार (with \[anthropomorphic\] form) and said to represent the with-form (सकल) aspect of Shiva:

  

निष्कलत्वान्निराकारं लिङ्गं तस्य समागतम्॥ ११  

सकलत्वात्तथा बेरं साकारं तस्य संगतम्। १२

Hindi translation of the above by Gita Press (संक्षिप्त शिवपुराण, p.22):

शिव के निष्कल या निराकार होने के कारण ही उनकी पूजा का आधारभूत लिङ्ग भी निराकार ही प्राप्त हुआ करता है। अर्थात् शिवलिङ्ग शिव के निराकार स्वरूप का प्रतीक है। इसी तरह शिव के सकल या साकार होने के कारण उनकी पूजा का आधारभूत विग्रह साकार प्राप्त होता है, अर्थात् शिव का साकार विग्रह उनके साकार स्वरूप का प्रतीक है।

  

The same chapter describes that the लिङ्ग as निष्कल in verses 20 and 21

शिवस्य ब्रह्मरूपत्वान्निष्कलत्वाच्च निष्कलम्॥ 20cd

लिङ्गं तस्यैव पूजायां सर्ववेदेषु संमतम्। 21ab

Hindi translation by Gita Press (ibid, p. 23)

भगवान् शिव ब्रह्मस्वरूप और निष्कल (निराकार) हैं, इसलिये उन्हीं की पूजा में निष्कल लिङ्ग का प्रयोग होता है

  

The same chapter describes that the लिङ्ग arose from a स्तम्भ, and not शिश्न/मेढ्र.

  

Similar descriptions are found in Skanda Purana, Maheshvara Khanda, Chapter 1, and other Puranic sources.

Yes, the word मेढ्ररूपेण is there, but लिङ्गं is explained as प्रसवसामर्थ्यम्. I am not sure what to make of the comment, since प्रसवसामर्थ्यम् is abstract and has सामानाधिकरण्य with लिङ्गं, and मेढ्ररूपेण is in the instrumental case. How would one translate/explain लिङ्गं प्रसवसामर्थ्यं मेढ्ररूपेण अविध्यत भूमौ पातितवान्? “Dropped the *linga*, the genitive power, in the form of a *medhra*on the earth?” So is the linga the genitive power of Shiva then as per Nilakantha?

You say shivalinga need not mean phallus. Do you not agree, then, that शिवमूर्तिविशेष (a specific form/image of Shiva) is the correct and proper meaning of the word लिङ्ग? Whether it is a column (स्तम्भ) of light/fire (ज्योतिः), or the formless (निष्कल/non-anthropomorphic) emblem of Shiva, emblem of genitive energy (प्रसवसामर्थ्य), or phallus (शिश्न) depends on the source or interpreter. If B-R give Trikandashesha and Medini as a source, but give a different meaning, does it not mislead readers who cannot/do not bother to read the original Koshas?

Specific examples would help (I do not know the verse you are referring to), but I think it is apt that they are not found in any Koshas, since the cosmology given inSrimadbhagavata does not change the meanings of Sanskrit words. Just like based on JUB, one would not expect a lexicographer to say that the word Om means "a hole in the sky", similarly one would not expect the word *dvija* to be explained as a star or तारक to be explained as tooth in a dictionary simply because the cosmology in Srimadbhagavata says that stars are born from teeth.
