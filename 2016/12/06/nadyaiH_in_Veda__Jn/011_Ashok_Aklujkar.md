The statement may be taken as essentially true, sinceBöhtlingk spent most of his professional life in Germany. However, one of my well-informed friends from Germany told me a few years ago thatBöhtlingk was actually Dutch by birth. Also, since it is quite likely that changing citizenship (for accepting a job, etc.) was not necessary in Europe in his time, he might have legally remained Dutch throughout his life.

  

Both Roth andBöhtlingk come across as over-confident from time to time. That they could have an inherent handicap because of their non-acquaintance or indirect shallowacquaintancewith traditional Indian scholarship does not seem to have occurred to them. However, they must be given a place of honour inIndologyfor the new questions they raised and the tools they made available. Ideally, originality in historical research should rest on comprehensive collection of evidence, proper judging of the relative strengths of different strands of evidence and a good instinct for what is more probable in a specific cumulatively constructed context. However, when that is not possible to reach this high a level (for whatever reason), a researcher’s raising of (reasonably substantiated) alternative possibilities is also important in the development of a field of historical research. If one keeps this consideration in mind,Roth andBöhtlingk cannot be denied a place of unusual significance in the history of Indology.
