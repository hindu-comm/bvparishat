Meaning in use for linga in relation to S'iva's worship is ' unantthropomorphic image of Shiva' .

  

Hence a good lexicographer , at the entry for linga lists unanthropomorphic image of Shiva along side other meanings such as mark, reason, phallus, symptom, mark of disease, and so on. At the end of the entry, if it is his policy to provide word origin information, he adds " For , (say) #3 (if that is the number given to the meaning unantthropomorphic image of Shiva ) , there is a myth whichgives theexplanation to this image as 'creation - dissolvingflame in its cooled down form' and another myth that gives another explanation that that it is Shiva's phallus thrown down on to the earth.

  

'Actual' origin of that image of Shiva is a different story that deserves a separate thread that I would like to start.
