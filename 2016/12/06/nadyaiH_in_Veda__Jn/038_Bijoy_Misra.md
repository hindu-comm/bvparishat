Friends,

  

I would agree that liṅga was used as a signature (symbol) through

the language evolution. I don't know why. As Ajitji says in his post.

aliṅga (unmanifested) is a word used.(yogasutram). My thinking is

that it was a depiction to distinguish wherever new "feature-like"

geologic formations happened on the earth. In the spirit of

animation, these features would be considered the symbol of "life" of

the earth. (animated earth is a rooted vedic concept)

  

This thinking is purely empirical, but is connected to many

odd places where new liṅga formations are noticed and celebrated.

I have not studied why the formations happen. Such raw geologic

structures are everywhere in Yellowstone National Park formed through

salt water sprouting out. India is in more advanced stage of

geologic formation, but still forming. Color of formation is a function

of salt content, sulphur and metals.

  

This is a speculation. I shared because of my mind was attracted.

I have not studied in depth. This needs scientific study.

  

Best regards,

  

BM
