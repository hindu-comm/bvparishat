The issue here is lexicographical practice.

  

Right lexicographical practice is to provide the meaning in use as the definition in the entry and then provide the word origin information as separate additional information. The meaning in use of linga is variegated and a right lexicographical practice is to give the multiple meanings in use with different numbers. At the end, the lexicographer may provide word origin information. In the case of linga, the phallusmeaning is not part of meaning in use at all. It is part of word origin information only. Even as part of word origin information, a good lexicographer gives place to both the versions: the one mentioned by AadaraNIya V. Subrahmanianji and theversions in Vamana Purana etc.
