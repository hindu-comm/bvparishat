Irrespective of what Mahabharata or Vamana Purana says and which you can quote, which is again subjected to interpretations and interpolations it would be best if you would share you reviewed paper. There are arguments to show that that “The meaning “Śiva in the form of a phallus” is not correct and Shaivaites don’t worship any Phallus. There are many schools among of Shaivites one has to consider this as well. Thanks
