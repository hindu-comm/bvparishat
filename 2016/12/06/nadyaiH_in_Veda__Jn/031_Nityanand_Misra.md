1\) This is just one of the many narratives about linga

2\) The original text still does not specifically make the connection, Nilakantha does that (though it is not completely clear to me as प्रसवसामर्थ्य is an abstract concept and not something material).

3\) B-R Woerterbuch is a dictionary, not a Puranic (or Sauptika Parva) Encyclopedia

  

Even if one takes Nilakantha's interpretation, it does not amount to the word linga meaning Shiva's generative organ or Shiva in the form of a phallus. I agree with Nagaraj Paturi Ji that lexicographic convention is to provide meanings in use. Here is an example. The JUB 1.3.5 says ओमित्येतमेवादित्यं समयातिमुच्यते एतदेव दिवश्छिद्रम्. Even though Om is explained as a hole in the sky in this Aranyaka, is this the sense in which the word Om is used in the language? No. Then, can any lexicographer use this to say the word Om means "a hole in the sky" (दिवश्छिद्र)? No.

  

Now think ofचन्द्रमा मनसो जातः .... Would anybody in their sane mind use this to say that the word मनस् means the moon, since the Purusha Sukta says चन्द्रमा मनसो जातः? Does not make sense.
