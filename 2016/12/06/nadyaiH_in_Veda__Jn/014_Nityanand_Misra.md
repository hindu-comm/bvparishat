Also see AlbrechtWezler’s Preface to*Pāṇini’s Grammatik* (Motilal Banarsidass, 1998, ISBN 9788120810259), p. xxx:

  

“Otto von Böhtlingk was born in — what is now again called — St. Petersburg on June 11th, 1815 and was brought up there. His family originally hailed from Lübeck and had moved from Holland to the famous city founded by Czar Peter the Great on the bank of the Neva. (Those were the happy days when the relations between Russia and Germany were friendly and civil, and there is hope that they will return.) In fact it was only late in his life that Böhtlingk took Russian citizenship, giving up his original Dutch.”
