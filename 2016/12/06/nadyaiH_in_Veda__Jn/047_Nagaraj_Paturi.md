Meaning in use of Shivalinga means meaning with which

  

worshippers of Shivalinga look at it

  

a\. as documented in the past literature such as12th century Veerashaiva literature and non-sectarian Kavyas (e.g. Raghavendra Vijaya mentions Gururaya Raghavendrateertharu worshipping Shivalinga in certain Kshetras during his teerthayatras)

  

b\. as found in the present day worshippers of Shivalinga (no worshipper of Shivalinga worships it with the view that he is worshipping the phallus of Shiva. )

  

As far as origin stories are concerned, whatever be the number of Puranas that give the origin from Shiva's phallus, even if one Purana gives an alternative origin story such as from the fire column ( in fact there is a big number of sourcesmentioning such origin),both theversions stand on equal footing as alternatives to each other. Neither of them stands as THEcorrect origin story. Nevertheless, they are the origin stories not the meanings in use.
