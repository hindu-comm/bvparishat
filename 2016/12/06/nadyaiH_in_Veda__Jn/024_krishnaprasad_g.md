The practice of referring the sources in Böhtlingk and Roth's Book is different than what you thought.  
  

I would rather write an article showing Böhtlingk and Roth are correct quoting linja is popularly called Phallus of Shiva quoting Mahabharata and Vamana Purana.  
  

I am not going into whether pandits helped Böhtlingk and Roth or not. However writing such a voluminous books will not make lullaby mistakes.  

I am ready to challenge to prove Böhtlingk and Roth are correct
