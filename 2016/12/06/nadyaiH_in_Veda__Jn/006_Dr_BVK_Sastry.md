Namaste



I am referring to the observations that have come up in various posts, in connection with the word ‘नद्यैः ‘ in vedic document -RV 1.54.1.
and word ‘vibhu = bhṛtya भृत्यः/ in another thread. The observations are compiled at the end of this post.



This is to reason out ‘why’ of my questions addressing the ‘ **In House Break down in Traditional Samskruth Studies’**, taking the bottom line of reference to be the same 1855 C.E – the period around, when these lexicons came in to Sanskrit studies domain . What corrective actions do we have on our hand as a team to address these deep rooted issues? Individually and Institutionally? Let us clear the dust of \< tampering, arrogance, norms violation, mischievous rectifications of text \> by impeccable scholarship and authority drawn from proper resources.



What the posts point to is something that makes the Battle: Sanskrit a relevant and worthwhile issue, with a much bigger spectrum of question for analysis, to be answered by native traditional Scholars and Sanskrit enthusiasts. These are some of the issues I hope the panel proposed by me for Chinmaya International Conference in 2017 will take up for discussion (and I am looking for a team of members).



**Here are the questions, seeking in-house course correction to clear
hundred years of ‘ apathy and inaction’ in tolerating the errors !**:



1) The ‘ **extent of reliability of On-line ‘ Defectively Keyed
in Text’** of Devanagari text (- By spelling, By diacritic signs, By Deviant articulation etc;, ) for scholarly studies of Samskruth documents?

2) **Reliance of ‘** **OCR’ generated ‘Samskruth Texts’** from the ‘ Earlier Print / Hand scribed / Manuscripts ? - The ease of access is NOT a substitute or excuse for lack of precision ; leading to the errors tagged on to the current texts.

3) ‘**Out of Context’ Translations of Words**, Free-pickoffs of
Sanskrit word- meaning association from the plurality of meanings listed in the lexicon.

( Try a simple exercise to translate the sentence : \< Ramah
shyaamalah = Rama is Sky Blue. \> , where the common reader understands the word ‘Rama’ as noun . Now try to pick this meaning from the lexicon entry in MW dictionary Entry reference : rāma \[L=39401\] \[p= 0842-c\] and see whether this meaning can be lexically arrived at. What ‘context’ needs to be provided for making the reader comprehended sense and the filters to be applied ? ) Veda related is a scaled magnification of this problem !

4) The **scribing practice of Sanskrit in Indic scripts** (has been discussed in an earlier post in detail ! Bringing back the key issue, Sanskrit was written in several Indian scripts; and the ‘punctuation – word boundary marking was not any strong forte of Indian manuscripts or print documents! What ruled was ‘Pronunciation and Grammar –Context’ . Take for example, the same sentence above. If there is a sentence /word break , then the sentence would look as below:

Original Intended \< Ramah shyaamalah \> : After word break inadevertently : \< Ramahshya> \< -- word /Sentence/ line break \> \< malah \> . There is no need to expand on the deviant meanings that come out of such missing with the reasoning’ and invoking the justification of ‘ metrical balancing’.

5) ‘ **Anticipate and answer’ all the future errors of the later generations** ? Why would a traditional writer like Yaaska do it? He has set the guidance for study of Vedas very clearly and cautioned the otherwise situation for a ‘Scholar of Veda’ as ‘Sthanurayam bhaarahaarah / … garte patati… ’.



I feel there is a need for restraint in passing a comment of frustration in public forum, on scholars of yore, of any country and faith. Our own effort to make a course correction here probably can be translated to
a worthwhile multi-institutional project of updating and reviewing the available lexicons-translations of earlier period. ( This is a project request I have voiced many times, earlier also with a focus on Monier Williams Sanskrit –English Dictionary; for which I have received only lukewarm response and support. For details, contact me off line.).



Whatever the Oriental scholars have written ( or for that matter ignored the ‘glaring’ obvious meanings, probably they may have had their own reasoning. One thing is for sure, that these two orientalises had much better equipped ‘native pundits’ working for them to give the word- meaning –usage data in an objective way.



These two were lexicographers of an absolutely foreign language to their nativity and nationality, having due regard for the ‘sensitivity of religions associated with the sacred language of the Hindoo’s’, which was overpowered by the interests of the funding institutions. The two orientalists aimed to bring the precision of classical language scholarship used for German, Latin, Greek ( how so ever inadequate the model may be) in to the study of Sanskrit –Texts and resources. Both scholars worked in the ‘Dark Ages of Pre- Computer and NO-INTERNET RESOURCES’ depending upon much reliable human scholarship of far earlier generations ! 



Motives apart, Both scholars dedicated long years of life, pursuing Sanskrit Studies and created publications which have shaped the course of Sanskrit studies all over the globe for over hundred plus years ( and to the shrinking of the traditional excellence !)

Otto von Böhtlingk (May 30, 1815 – April 1, 1904) was a German Indologist and Sanskrit scholar. He worked with Rudolph Roth, to bring out many Sanskrit studies related works, His magnum opus was his great Sanskrit-German dictionary, Sanskrit-Wörterbuch (7 vols., Saint Petersburg, 1855–1875; shortened ed. (without citations) 7 vols, Saint Petersburg, 1879–1889), which with the assistance of his two friends, Rudolf Roth (d. 1895) and Albrecht Weber (b. 1825), was completed in 23 years. He also published several smaller treatises, notably one on Vedic accent, Über den Accent im Sanskrit (1843). Also notable are his Sanskrit-Chrestomathie (Saint Petersburg, 1845; 2d ed., 1877–97), and an edition with translation of a treatise on Hindu poetics by Daṇḍin, Kāvyādarsa (Leipzig, 1890). Böhtlingk took up Panini's grammar again, 47 years after his first edition, when he republished it with a complete translation under the title Panini's Grammatik mit Übersetzung (Leipzig, 1887). 



Sir Monier Monier-Williams, (12 November 1819 – 11 April 1899) was the second Boden Professor of Sanskrit at Oxford University. His Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged with Special Reference to Cognate Indo-European languages, Monier Monier-Williams, revised by E. Leumann, C. Cappeller, et al was published during 1899, Clarendon Press, Oxford.





**Observations from the posts compiled: **

1. I keep wondering what’s the use of having **defective typed texts by hundreds that are there all over the web.** This is one example
( - Ajit Gargeswari )

2. It is an **OCR Error**. ( - V.Subramanian)

3. I have personally felt that the **sanskrit words have to be interpreted in the context of use**. Bhatrhari spends enormous time on this in his book and scolds people who handle words casually. ( Bijoy Misra)

4. Dont you think that **Yaaska could have got the meaning from the AV Paippalaada?** The AVP is earlier than Yaaska who cites from it in the 12th book. ( - Deepak Bhattacharya – responding to Nityananda Misra, invoking - AVP 4.33.2. and Yaska (2-19) explanation / usage RV 1.113.1

5. The **probability of scribal error in ‘proper hearing’
and ‘ cover up reason of ‘ metrical balancing’** - \< मन्ये यत् स्वामिभृत्यशब्दयोः प्रायः युगपद् श्रवणं भवति तस्मात् त्रिकाण्डशेषपाठेषु स्वामिशब्दस्य सामीप्यात् छन्दोभङ्गं विनैव नित्यशब्दः दोषाक्रान्तो भृत्य इत्येवं लिखितः। यथा पूर्वमुदाहृते तेलुगुभाषासहिते त्रिकाण्डशेषमु इत्याख्ये ग्रन्थे। एवमेव कस्माच्चित् स्खलितयुक्तात् पाठाद् असमीक्ष्यैव Böhtlingk इत्यनेन भृत्यशब्दो गृहीत इति प्रतिभाति। \> - Ujjwal
Rajput

6. SS Murthy invoking, where in Computer related errors add up to the confusion - \< Popular sloka usage scripted in Telugu Characters, where the Sanskrit Dental – Second letter is scripted with variance (following the regional pronunciation ?!) .. ..ప్రభుం ప్రాణ**నాథం**
విభుం విశ్వ**నాధం**...,

7. Nityananda Misra - who points clearly the glaring error between the traditional Samskrutha Kosha Vachaspatyam and Modern English Dictionary by Monier Williams \< Now see how some famous lexicons give the meaning भृत्य, which is completely opposite to स्वामिन्. Did somebody (Böhtlingk?) err and everybody else blindly followed? Or is there an edition of Trikandashesha with a different reading? I fail to see how etymologically vibhu can mean a servant, given other meanings of the word are omnipresent, omnipotent, Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, etc. Nor do I recall any famous usage in this sense.

**Vacaspatyam** : विभु ४ भृत्ये त्रिका०

**Monier Williams** Sanskrit-English Dictionary (H2) वि-भु b \[p= 978,3\] \[L=198438\] mfn. or » विभू

(H3B) वि-भू \[L=198445\] m. a servant L.



**Böhtlingk and Roth** Grosses Petersburger Wörterbuch

Vibhu — 2) ṃ. — b) Diener (bhṛtya) Trik. 

8. KS Kannan : \< Not too surprising. .. Bohtlingk is notorious for tampering with the readings of texts. Arrogance unlimited, plus norms of textual criticism thrown unto winds, he has deliberately and mischievously "rectified" texts without as much as a decent warning to the readers, and misled scores of subsequent scholars. … Simply reprehensible. \>
