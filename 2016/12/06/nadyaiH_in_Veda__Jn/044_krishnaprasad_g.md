1\) This is just one of the many narratives about linga  
  

There are many instance at least more than 5 which exactly specifies Phallus. I can't provide ref for you since all puranas are freely availably or at least in shops. You can also refer Puranic Encyclopedia by Vettam Mani  
  

2\) The original text still does not specifically make the connection, Nilakantha does that (though it is not completely clear to me as प्रसवसामर्थ्य is an abstract concept and not something material).  
  

Did you read completely the orginal verses? in some recensions and some other stories even Shiva himself says.  
  

प्रसवसामर्थ्यं in मेढ्ररूपेण you skipped the word मेढ्र  
  

3\) B-R Woerterbuch is a dictionary, not a Puranic (or Sauptika Parva) Encyclopedia

  

This is a small type of Encyclopedia giving information about Puranich Charecters and Mahabarata ramayana charecters check for yourself  
  

Even if one takes Nilakantha's interpretation, it does not amount to the word linga meaning Shiva's generative organ or Shiva in the form of a phallus.  
  

मेढ्र is given exactly and other PUranas we have as samvaada. As yourself being a scholar you should search that. I don't have time. I am not interested to change your misconception any more.  

  
  
I agree with Nagaraj Paturi Ji that lexicographic convention is to provide meanings in use.  
  

Shiva Linga need not to mean only Phallus but it also mean Phallus and Linga we worshipping every where. Again I am saying this not pure lexicon like Medini Amara etc. And who wrote Medini Amara or not Brahmas because even they being criticized using wrong words skipping the famous words etc.  

  
Here is an example. The JUB 1.3.5 says ओमित्येतमेवादित्यं समयातिमुच्यते एतदेव दिवश्छिद्रम्. Even though Om is explained as a hole in the sky in this Aranyaka, is this the sense in which the word Om is used in the language? No. Then, can any lexicographer use this to say the word Om means "a hole in the sky" (दिवश्छिद्र)? No.  
  

दिशवश्छिद्र is not famous as Linga  

  

Now think ofचन्द्रमा मनसो जातः .... Would anybody in their sane mind use this to say that the word मनस् means the moon, since the Purusha Sukta says चन्द्रमा मनसो जातः? Does not make sense.  
  

Sri Bhagavatam uses such words again you search for yourself. for instance a star is born by Teeth and dvija is called as star but quoted in Puranas but you will not find this any Koshas. Even B-R doesnt qoute cos he would have not observed it.  
  

The main thing is you are comparing Shivas Phallus to trNa Maanvavas Phallus that is the problem  
  

I worship Shiva more than any one here and have heard Shiva Story from Bhagavatam umpteen Number of times.  
  

Any one is not authority to question the interest or the style of B-R when he has a source for that.  
  

Moreover the misconception, of telling he has mixed Trikanda etc, is nonsense
