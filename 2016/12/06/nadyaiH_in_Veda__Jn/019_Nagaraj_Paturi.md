On the same forum , in the same thread, I posted as follows:

  

The dictionary definitions for the entry 'linga' have been violating a very significant lexicographical convention from the beginning. It is lexicographical convention to list the meanings that are 'in use' and mention etymological / word origin information at the end of the entry separated from the list of meanings. The meaning:'phallic image of Shiva'is not a meaning in use, it has only a word origin or 'archaeological' significance, if at all. But the dictionaries including Apte list this among the meanings of the word.
