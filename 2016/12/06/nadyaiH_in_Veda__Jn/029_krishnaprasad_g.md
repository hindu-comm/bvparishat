B-R did not mistook Trikandasesa and it is not their style of quoting as you have interpreted now.  
  

There are many instances in Vamana Purana which says it is a Phallus of Shiva we worship and also in Mahabharatam  

here I am giving the extracts from Sauktika Parvan with the commentary for it by Nilakantha  
  

पितामहोऽब्रीवत्.... भूतानि सृज..... ॥ १७. अध्या १० श्लो  

तथेत्युक्त्वा...  

दीर्घकालं तपस्तेपे...  

(तप्यमानं) गिरशं सुप्तमम्भसि दृष्ट्वा...  

(ब्रह्मा स्वमेयासृजत् ततः क्रुद्धो रुद्रः)  

चुक्रोध बलवद्दृष्ट्वा लिंगं स्वं चाप्यविध्यत ॥ १७. अ २१. श्लो  
(किमनेन लिंगेन प्रयोजनमिति मत्वा तमुत्पाट्य भूमावपातयदिति कथा)  
  

तत्र नीलकंठः  

"लिंगं प्रसवसामर्थ्यं मेढ्ररूपेण अविध्यत भूमौ पातितवान्। एतदेव पूजितं तत्सर्वसिद्धिप्रदमास्तिकानां भविष्यतीत्यभिप्रायेण"  
  

It is not I am going to prove here the story to be interpreted, B-R etc have mentioned because in many puranas it is called Shivas Phallus.  
  

One more thing  

Even Amara Kosha has also flaws which were mentioned by earlier commentators.  

for instance please check balapatra(putra) in Kshiratarangini.
