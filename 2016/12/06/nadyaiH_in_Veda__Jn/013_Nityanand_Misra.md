He was German by ancestry, Dutch (and later Russian) by nationality, and Russian by birthplace.

  

Ladislav Zgusta (2006), Lexicography Then and Now: Selected Essays (Volume 129 of Lexicographica, Series Maior), Walter de Gruyter, ISBN 9783110924459, p. 273:

  

“The first of the three lexicographic projects is a dictionary of Sanskrit compiled mainly by Otto Böhtlingk (1815-1904). Böhtlingk was a scion of an old German family of Lübeck; the family moved to St. Petersburg but had acquired Dutch citizenship through extended business with and a long residence in the Netherlands. Hence, Otto Böhtlingk was born in 1815 in St. Petersburg but was a Dutch subject; although he wrote all his works in German and spent half of his life in Germany, he never became a citizen of any German state; only late in his life did he become a Russian subject.”
