This topic is of greatest interest for me, because of<https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/PWK/issues> and<https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/PWG/issues> as well.

That's a good question. "compiling meanings as understood in the West" is what has been said about PWK and PWG since 1852, but anyway - it's the biggest Sanskrit dictionary still around.

Right, you are aware of Zgusta's article Copying in Lexicography, right?

Would want to know why Apte is not listed here. Too European?

Has there ever been a review or evaluation what and how has been done in*Śabdakalpadrumaḥ*or*Vācaspatyam?*

I was thinking once about doing my post-PhD work on Sanskrit Lexicography, History of the last 200 years, but it's a mega task and as I have no affiliation with a University now, no need for it.

  

"A dictionary of Spoken Sanskrit" is no source to trust, just a compilation, nothing more. Use<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/> instead or even<http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/awork/apidev/sample/list-0.2.html>
