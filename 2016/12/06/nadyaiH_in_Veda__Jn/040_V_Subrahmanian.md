It is also to be noted that the idea of 'linga' is not exclusively associated with Shiva, for, the followers of Madhva believe that Vishnu abides as Lingaroopi as well:

//8.Udupi Ananteshwara – Anantha + Eshwara

In Udupi, just opposite to Sri Krishna Mutt, one can see the Anantheshwara Temple.In this temple, there is sannidhya of both Shiva and Srihari.Here Srihari is in the roopa of Linga, wherein the apart from lingaroopi shiva, there is Anantha – That is why the kshetra is called as Anantheshwara.//
