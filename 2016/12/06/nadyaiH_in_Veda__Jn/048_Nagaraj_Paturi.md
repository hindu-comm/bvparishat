[The word is first attested as the 12th-century *bacheler*, a](http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?year_start=1800&year_end=2008&corpus=15&smoothing=7&case_insensitive=on&content=bachelor) [knight bachelor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_bachelor "Knight bachelor"), a [knight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight "Knight") too young or poor to gather vassals under [his own banner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_banneret "Knights banneret").^([\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor#cite_note-oed-3)) The [Old French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_French "Old French") *bacheler* presumably derives from [Provençal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occitan_language "Occitan language") *bacalar* and [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language "Italian language") *baccalare*,^([\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor#cite_note-oed-3)) but the ultimate source of the word is uncertain.^([\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor#cite_note-FOOTNOTE.27.27EB.27.271878-4)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor#cite_note-oed-3)) The [proposed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_reconstruction "Linguistic reconstruction") [Medieval Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Latin "Medieval Latin") \**baccalaris* ("vassal", "field hand") is only attested late enough that it may have derived from the vernacular languages,^([\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor#cite_note-oed-3)) rather than from the southern French and northern Spanish Latin^([\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor#cite_note-FOOTNOTE.27.27EB.27.271878-4)) *baccalaria* ("cattle ranch", from *bacca*, "cow").^([\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor#cite_note-dc-5)) Alternatively, it has been derived from Latin *baculum* ("a stick"), in reference to the wooden sticks used by knights in training.^([\[n 2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor#cite_note-8))

From the 14th century, the term was also used for a junior member of a [guild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild "Guild") (otherwise known as "yeomen") or [university](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University "University") and then for low-level ecclesiastics, as young [monks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monk "Monk") and recently appointed [canons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(priest) "Canon (priest)").^([\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor#cite_note-10)) As an inferior grade of scholarship, it came to refer to one holding a "[bachelor's degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor%27s_degree "Bachelor's degree")". This sense of *baccalarius* or *baccalaureus* is first attested at the [University of Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Paris "University of Paris") in the 13th century in the system of degrees established under the auspices of [Pope Gregory IX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_IX "Pope Gregory IX") as applied to scholars still *in statu pupillari*. There were two classes of *baccalarii*: the *baccalarii cursores*, theological candidates passed for admission to the divinity course, and the *baccalarii dispositi*, who had completed the course and were entitled to proceed to the higher degrees.

In the [Victorian era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era "Victorian era"), the term [eligible bachelor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eligible_bachelor "Eligible bachelor") was used in the context of [upper class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_class "Upper class") [matchmaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arranged_marriage "Arranged marriage"), denoting a young man who was not only unmarried and eligible for marriage, but also considered "eligible" in financial and social terms for the prospective bride under discussion. Also in the Victorian era, the term "[confirmed bachelor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmed_bachelor "Confirmed bachelor")" denoted a man who was resolute to remain unmarried.
