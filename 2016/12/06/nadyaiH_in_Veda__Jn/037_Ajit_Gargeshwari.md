To add to what scholars have already written. Due to lack of time I have not used any dielectrics. There are enough articles and books written by eminent scholars which shows that Linga does not correspond with Phallus. Linga stands for sign of God used for meditation and puja. Some Puranas which have tilt towards vishnavism give their own version and biased readers or propagators make their own conjectures.



Linga as a term requires explanation. The fundamental meaning word is a 'mark or' symbol'. In grammar, it means the gender, whereas in logic it means the mark (hetu). Even in respect of the meaning of a phallus, it has the fundamental meaning as a mark distinguishing one sex from the other. As applied to Siva, it is a visible symbol of the absolute form of Siva, which is difficult to comprehend (alinga).the sanctum sanctorum of all Siva temples. There is a Puranic legend about the appearance of Siva as an effulgent, huge column of fire in front of Lord Brahma and Lord Visnu engaged in a verbal dispute about the relative superiority of each. Sculptures of the manifestation of Siva as a linga, portraying this legend are found in all the Siva temples at the back of the sanctum sanctorum. The resemblance of the linga to the genital organ and the base of the linga to the female organ and the fertility theory have led to the mistaken notion that linga worship is identical with a phallic cult. The sarcastic reference in the Vedas to the phallic cult as sisna devah (those who sport with their genital organs) and the long-standing Hindu tradition of worshiping the linga with great devotional fervour donâ€™t appear compatible.



Linga is defined as visible symbol representing formless aspect of Siva. Linga literally mean sign or symbol. It consists of a piece of short cylindrical rod called bana with a rounded top, inserted in the middle of a wider circular piece called the avudaiyar, having a pedestal or base called the pitha. As the linga represents Siva, the pitha represents his consort Parvati. The pitha symbolizes the yoni (vulva) and forms the lower part of the phallus. The principal parts of the pitha are the nala (drain), the jaladhara (gutter), the ghrtavari (water pot), the nimna (drip), and the patrika (plate). The nagara-pitha-s are square, the dravida-pithas are octagonal, and the vesara-pitha-s are circular or round. The square, octagonal, and round parts are also known as Brahma-bhdga, Visnu-bhaga, and Siva-bhaga, respectively.



Siva is commonly represented as a liniga (generally, a form with a conical base and a cylindrical top) .The lingas, belonging to different periods and

regions, vary in size and shape. Lingas can be termed as Saivas, Pasupata, Kalamukha, Mahavrata, Varna, and Bhairava, and can be typified as samakarna (worshiped by brahmins), varthmana (by ksatriya-s), sivanga (by vaisyas), and swastika (by others).



Lingas may be cala (moveable) or acala (immoveable). The cala linga-s are of many types. Mrnnmaya or clay lingas, lonaja or metal lingas, ratnajas, made of precious or semiprecious stones, daruja or wooden linga-s. Among the Tamils of the Samgam age, the linga was worshiped in the form of a stump of wood, known as kandu, sailaja or stone linga-s, ksanika made of rice, cow dung, rudrakasa seeds, grass, flowers, or jaggery. These lingas are made for a particular occasion and are disposed of after the event.



Among Achala Linga Svambhu is most sacred. The other acala lingas-s are daivika lingas, which are of the shape of a candle-flame and have a rough surface dotted with trident-shape scar. Ganapatya Linga resembling the cucumber or Wood-apple; and spherical arsa Lingas are set up and worshiped by sages. The commonest acala lingas are the manusa lingas made as per religious texts. The height determined by the breadth of the sanctum, the breadth of the door, the breadth of the prasada ,the height of the adhastana, the height of pada, the length of the hand, the inch-length, the height of the yajamana, and the tunga of the linga. Based on this, the linga can be uttama, madhyama, oradhama (or combinations of these three,numbering nine).



In Vedanta, the Linga Sarira is said to contain only seventeen elements, ahankara and tanmatras being not recognized in Vedanta, but the five pranas (vital airs) are admitted. Patanjali does not mention linga sarira in his Yoga sutra but only Citta which carries the Smaskaras. Linga Sarira cannot mean Pahllus Sarira by any stretch of imagination.
