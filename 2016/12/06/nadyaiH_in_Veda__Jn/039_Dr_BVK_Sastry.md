Namaste



On \< the plurality of meanings for the word ‘ Linga (लिङ्ग ), listed in ‘"A dictionary of Spoken Sanskrit".> and Nityananda Mishras note : \< Perhaps this is a good topic for research: *Sanskrit Lexicographers—Misleading scholars since 1850s*. \>



**Question**: What would the conversational Sanskrit speaker convey or understand from the most common prayer of Shiva, titled ‘ Linga-Ashtaka’ ? What **guidance is there to fit and filter the ‘ word meaning**’ ? Who is providing the regulatory guidance ? What is a Spoken Sanskrit Educator supposed to do ? Redirect the student from Menon to where ? ….. To MW , Apte, Bohtlingk, Shabda-kalpadruma……..

( Note: Prof. Subramanyam Koradas detailing on the understanding of the word ‘itihAsa, Bharata-bhArata’ is worth reading in this context.



IF the answer is ‘ Seek Guru Guidance’, THEN ‘Spoken Sanskrit’ is not guided and regulated by any ‘ Guru’ !

IF the answer is ‘ Stick to Social Usage by Religion-Faith, as taught’
THEN Dictionary is of ‘minimal help’!

The ‘Sanskrit Word Meaning Interpretation’ is Free and Open for All !
Media and academician will mount the unregulated discourse picking the preferred meaning to explain the ‘ Title of the Prayers used by the Community to worship their (tribal God - ? ) using ‘an ancient classical language’ ? especially on a ‘Shiva-Ratri Day, explaining what could have been the ‘ Jyotirlinga-Darshana’ conceptuality ?!



This is NOT a new line of exercise; but the Battle :Sanskrit \< Word Meaning derivation = Pada-artha Prakriyaa nishpatti \> has been existing ‘ naked and stripped to the skin’, for almost three centuries, as ‘Sanskrit Documents Translation and Research’ in the academics’ violating the ‘ Panini-Patanjali –Yaska/ Amara ksoha’ guidance. One may explore how the word ‘Linga- Purana’ has been explored with this model of ‘ dictionary anchored translations’ , as early as 18^(th) century under ‘ Hindoosim’.



IF I need to reframe the question for this context, it would read :

**Question reworded :** Using the given dictionary of Sanskrit,
how would a student translate and understand the meaning of the popular Sanskrit word \< Linga-Ashtaka \> ? What audit-regulatory work has been undertaken by Traditional Sanskrit Scholars to review and upgrade the ‘ Modern Tools of Sanskrit Studies’ Especially ‘ Lexicons that have come in the post period of 1800 C.E?



**Note**: This is one project pressed by me as ‘ Monier Williams : A Lexicon Word- Meaning Entries Review with a focus on 40,000 words marked ‘L’ by MW, for meaning’; and it’s impact on Digestion and Dilution in Standards of Samskruth Studies in two centuries’. I am yet to get any response by ‘ Battle :Sanskrit Enthusiasts’ who need a ‘ funding mechanism to address the fundamentals of Samskruth’. Please write to me off the forum on this topic.



Thanks in advance for the help.
