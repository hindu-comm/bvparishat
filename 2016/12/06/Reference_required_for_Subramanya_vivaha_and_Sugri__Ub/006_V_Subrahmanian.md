Thanks for the very informative resources Sri Nagaraj Paturi ji. 

  

In the South, Subrahmaṇya is also called 'vallīśa'. There is also the famous composition of Pāpanāśam Śivan: 'srīvallīdevasenāpate srīsubrahmaṇya namost te..'

Just as in the case of Subrahmanya, Ganapati's wedding with Siddhi and Buddhi is an issue with variations.
