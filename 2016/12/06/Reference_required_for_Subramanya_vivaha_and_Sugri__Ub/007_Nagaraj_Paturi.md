Now that the Purana references aspect is covered, if we come back to the 'meaning' of the 'narrative' or 'form' of Sri Subrahmanya asdēvasēnāpati and vallīpati ,at least the name dēvasēnāpatiinstantly sounds allegorical to the observers who know that Sri Subrahmanya is the head of the dēvasēnā , the army of all the devas as per the well known narrative of tārakāsurasamhāra. 

  

Though Prof. Kamil V. Zvelebil, in the reference that I mentioned, derives the word vallī here as a Dravidian one and views the Sanskrit word vallī too to be of Dravidian origin, my hunch is that the word vallī in the name vallīpati is aSanskrit word as inśikṣāvallī,ānandavallī, and bhr̥guvallī of taittirīya upaniṣad .

  

Siddhi and Buddhi, as you know,are so evidently allegorical.
