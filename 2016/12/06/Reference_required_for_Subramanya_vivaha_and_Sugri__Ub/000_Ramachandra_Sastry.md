Namaste All,

  

I am looking for the below references in Purana and different ramayana.

  

Can i request scholars to help me with the references.

  

1\) In which purana/upa-purana, we can find a reference for Subramanya getting marriage with Valli and Devasena. Father and mother details and vivaha vivarana details if available.

  

2\) In valmiki ramayana we can see Vali capturing Sugriva's wife Ruma and Sugriva was sent out of the kingdom.

However, some say Sugriva married Tara wife of Vali after Vali's death.

I couldn't find a reference in Valmiki ramayana for Tara getting married by Sugriva, hence would like to know if there is a reference to above in any other Ramayana.

  

Dhanyavada

Ramachandra
