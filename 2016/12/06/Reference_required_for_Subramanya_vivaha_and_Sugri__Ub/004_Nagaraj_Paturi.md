### Marriage of Skanda

The Brahmānda Purāna**³⁵** states that Skanda married Devasenā, the daughter of Indra. But the Skanda Purāna**³⁶** states that he married Senā, the daughter of Yama, the god of death. But according to the Varāhapurāna**³⁷** Shiva blessed him with all playthings and asked him to be the husband of Senā.**³⁸** Since the meaning of the words Devasenā and Senā denote the army of celestials, it is considered that they are symbolic representations of Kumāra made as the chief or leader of the celestials.

According to another version found in the Brahma Purāna³⁹ describing the Kumāratīrtha, he never married. This purāna adduces the reason for the same. After killing the demon Tāraka, Pārvatī devised a plan and made every woman to appear to Skanda as his mother. This had the desired effect. Skanda beheld his mother in every woman and hence got detached from life and declared that all women were mothers for him and resolved to be a bachelor.

The Shiva Purāna^(**40**) contains a different version furnishing the reason for Skanda remaining unmarried. According to this version when Skanda was going round the earth, he was informed by Nārada that the marriage of Ganesa, his brother, was performed by his parents in order to get rid of him. On hearing this Skanda was angry in spite of the entreaties made by his parents and proceed to the mountain Krauñca with the resolve not to marry any time. Hence Skanda was known to be Kumāra indicating that he was not married. It is to be noted that the traditional Tamil account holds that he set out to the Palani Hills protesting the favourtism shown by his parents in offering the fruit to his elder brother for having won the competition of going round the world first. Similarly the legend of Skanda marrying Vallī is unknown to the Sanskrit purānic tradition.
