vallī in all the Vediccases mentioned by Prof. Kannan seems to be in the sense of a creeper. That is the sense which is being derived from native Tamil. Prof. Zvelebil's derivation is from the name of a certain specificplant in Tamil. Butin Sanskrit, it seems to havethe meaning of any creeper in general.

In Sanskrit, the wordhas two forms valliḥ and vallī. Prof. Zvelebil's Valli seems to be hrasvānta.

  

For valliḥ, Apte gives, a creeper, creeping or winding plant. and the earth.

  

For vallī he gives apart from a creeper, creeping or winding plant, valljam = pepper, vallīvr̥kṣah = sāla tree.

  

My hunch is that vallī of the Vedic though could have been a metaphor from creeper, in the sense of a section of Veda goes well with words like su-brahmaṇya.

  

It is possible that (there are examples for that) folk etymologyis created for the Sanskrit origin name.
