Even though a reference to any formal marriage of Tārā-Sugrīva may not be found, for the two being in intimate relationship here is the reference:

  

\|\| वाल्मीकि रामायण - किष्किन्धाकाण्ड \|\|

\|\| सर्ग \|\|

३० \[Gitasupersite has this number as 31\]

  

ततः सुग्रीवभवनं प्रविश्य हरिपुङ्गवाः \|  
क्रोधमागमनं चैव लक्ष्मणस्य न्यवेदयन् \|\| २१\|\|

Having entered Sugriva's palace, the monkeychiefs reported the arrival of angry Lakshmana.  

*तारया सहितः कामी सक्तः कपिवृषो रहः \|*  
न तेषां कपिवीराणां शुश्राव वचनं तदा \|\| २२\|\|

तदा then, कामी passionate, तारया with Tara, सहितः along with, रहः in privy, सक्तः engrossed in love, कपिवृषः bull among monkeys, तेषाम् their, कपिवीराणाम् of the monkey-chiefs, वचनम् words, न शुश्राव not heed.  

  

But Sugriva who was engrossed in overtures with passionate Tara, did not heed the words of the monkey-chiefs.
