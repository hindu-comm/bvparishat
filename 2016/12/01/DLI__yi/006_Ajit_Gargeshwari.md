Dear Sir,

Yesterday I sent a clear Message on another thread.



<http://dli.serc.iisc.ernet.in/> this site is for tiff Page viewing

<http://www.dli.ernet.in/> is the site to download books as PDF

DLI has no other sites as of now

DLI downloader even before was never a Part of DLI it was a siftware developed independently not by DLI.

Regards

Ajit Gargeshwari
