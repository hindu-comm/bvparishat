I have been one of the members of BVParishat ever since its inception.I feel proud of being such a member. In the initial years the environment of the parishat was very healthy, amicable and excellent. But gradually a parting tendency has been developing and its presence has very clearly been felt very often in the recent years. Particularly for the last two years Its influence has been growing more n more.

  

Earlier whenever any thought is posted the way of dealing with it by the respected members was very tender, smooth, scholarly and convincing.

  

**But during the past two years my personal experience I would like to share that the comments some members are of the following nature :**

**1. Some comments are bitter**

**2. Some are sweet quoted satires**

**3. Some of them are of insulting nature at personal level**

**4. Some are even vehemently attacking by nature.**

**5. Some are monopolizing.**

**6. All language efficiency is being used to dismayingly ill-treat the views submitted.**

  

Right from my recent mails on the prevalent beliefs about Mahabharata in our region where I have clearly mentioned that it is not my personal belief but an existing belief in Andhra region to most of my other mails during the last two years on different topics I have such agonizing experience through the comments of some scholars.

  

Of course even appreciation from some other scholars also is not out of the horizons of my contentment for which I am ever grateful to them. 

  

**I have always high regard for the team of members who developed this group also. I express my thanks to them for accommodating me till date.**

  

Having reviewed all my experiences of recent years I take this new year RESOLUTION to leave this GROUP. I humbly request the moderators to delete my name from this group.

  

Namaste to all the respectful learned members.

  

Warm regards to all, 

**Prof. Rani Sadasiva Murty**
