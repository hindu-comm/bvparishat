The BVP charter or guidelines of Posting clearly says post can be in English or Sanskrit. I don't see "Sanskrit medium traditional style Shaastra discussion forum " purely in Sanskrit will or can happen on a mailing list like BVP. There is no need to make BVP apurely Sanskrit or Traditional scholar mailing list. We have both Scholars and ordinary members. Scholars can write anywhere. There is a need for an interface where scholars and serious readers on whom scholars are dependent need to interact. Writing in Sanskrit or English doesn't matter.  
  

We have printed books and manuscripts various Sabhas, Vagarthas ghostis etc where refutation style of debates can take place (purva Paksha has been vanquished and I am the champion style) .  
  
If I have a doubt or need a discussion on a topic I am reading, I write to BVP where experts or more knowledgeable people on that that topic write. No two views can be identical and there may not be agreement. If there no disagreement and and one simply reads what others write it will be like a pravachana or discourse. that is not how it should be. This is how I see BVP list and nothing more.
