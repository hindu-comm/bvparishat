It's not possible, since there is no clear division of subjects.

Traditional like to interpret the same thing, e.g. who shivali\~Nga, and indologist also have some ideas about the same.

So, these subjects provoke both groups to write pointing errors of others.

Who is going to stay and watch and decide what thread is for whom?

Better, indologist have one group and traditional other.
