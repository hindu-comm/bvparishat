Yes, the place where non-traditional are residing is a heaven, so these traditional must leave their groove!?

  

I mean really, just writing poems about love doesn't make you eligible to understand pramANa-prameya-vyavasthA which is core of any philosophy followed by traditional schools.

  

It's just because of this attitude of indologist and poets that traditional feel shy to speak. Your number is enormous, you think similar and you never read any of Sanskrit works as an insider. You have
readymade, prepared without study, ideas about Indian shAstra and philosophy, and you try to interpret them to match that idea.

That separates indologist and traditional.

And, that's why traditional feel in foreign land with indologist.

  

I hope each post which opposes any support to traditional will reveal the reason to separate indologist and traditional.

  

This differentiation must be clearly known.

We are not same. Even having common language, Sanskrit, does not ensures that we are on same side.

Hybrids of traditional and indologist come in different variety. So there are many divisions. Hybrids better fit with indologist, since they provide their core.

  

Traditional are seen as idiots generally, although they are academically more honest compared to indologist.

  

I hope some more people may be able to reveal more difference in clear words which will give clear idea about division and need of support to traditional.
