\>Traditional like to interpret the same thing, e.g. who shivali\~Nga, and indologist also have some ideas about the same.

\>So, these subjects provoke both groups to write pointing errors of others.

  

  

-------- If handled healthily, such a situation and such an interaction can be taken into a useful and productive direction. A critique of the modern method from the traditional point of view in a way communicableand convincing to the other side is long overdue. But for this, each side needs to be conscious of the fundamental premises, methods of proof , methods of argumentation and point out the error at that level.

  

For example, the traditional side may say, you assume that there can be other historical /mundane space and time reasons than the one mentioned in a puranic narrativefor a certain object of worship to come into existence; but what is mentioned in the puranic narrative is the only way it could have happened inhistorical /mundane space and timebecause...... as you can also agree.... etc., in stead of saying you are wrong because you are committing the error of not accepting the narratives inPuranas ashistorically occurred happenings

or they can even provide argument to establish that narratives in
Puranas are to be accepted as historically occurred happeningsand each time refer to that argument and say as per that argument and as per the already mutually agreed conclusion that the narratives in Puranas are historically occurred happenings, your argument that there can be other historical space and time reasons for this object of worship to have come into existenceas such is erroneous.

  

Such an interaction will contribute to bridging between the two approaches currently running parallel to each other.

  

Currently there is a section of Indology that is mostly from a section of western Indology and to an extent from some westernized Indian Indologists that outrightly rejects the traditional Sanskrit scholarship as superstitious and unscientific and there is another section to which I belong, which opposes this group and fights this group defending the traditional scholarship in Indological forums. On BVP too it has been witnessed howa huge number ofpro-tradition Indologists have been trying to defend the traditional against the onslaught by the anti-traditionals.

  

Some savyasaachi traditional scholars themselves are participating in this fight while continuing with their traditional academics in the forums where it suits.

  

It is not fair on the part of the part of some of the traditional scholars to bundle up all those engaged in modern academics about Indian culture into one.

  

A successful and powerful critique of the anti-traditional Indology by a traditional scholar is a thing to celebratefor all the pro-tradition modern academics about Indian culture.
