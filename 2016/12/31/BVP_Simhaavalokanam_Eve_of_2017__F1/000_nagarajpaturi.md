This is a bi-product of my introspection if BVP was a predominantly Sanskrit medium traditional style Shaastra discussion forum and if I was responsible wholly or partially for the change of the forum into a forum with a different nature than this. I thought if my leaving the forum can restore it back to its original nature, I must do it.

  

But to draw a conclusion with regard to the question ofwhether BVP was a predominantly Sanskrit medium traditional style Shaastra discussion forum, I need to do acontent analysis of these posts, which thoughis not an easy task, I will certainly give it a try.
