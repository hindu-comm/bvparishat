Dear Swamiji,

The traditional scholars must also not bury themselves in the past.
Rote repetition of books does not

makeप्रमाण. India must distinguish herself from the Bible studies.
She is open, curious, always

evolving. While I love the brilliance of theशास्त्र, I would urge the traditional scholars to handle any

and all questions with agreeable respect. I agree that the questioner must have the basic preparation

exemplified by some training in Sanskrit verified by the ability of expression. There must be tacit

assumption that all answers may not be in the शास्त्र.

Most, do I dare say all, material developed as Indology is half-baked and flawed. People have

done it for administration convenience than for the love of the study.
Quick and haphazard conclusions

are rampant. They were designed to caricature India for people in their foreign homes. The early

"Indologists" never knew that some day people of Indian descent would live abroad. In any case

they had already profiled that a person of Indian descent needs to be told about what his/her culture is.

I have not researched how this situation has developed, but I witness it in proximity.

It is a sad feeling. Many are forced to ignore. Many others develop contempt for the traditional studies

which is the political goal of agencies that fund these profile-based "discoveries". A good part of India is

also affected because of improper exposure to the beauty of the tradition.

The traditional scholars have a massive role to play. They have a role of nation reconstruction besides

being scholars. The average young student needs their guidance. The person does not speak the

traditional language. But he/she is real and the future depends on him/her. The traditional scholars

must create new methods to convey. Valmiki put music to Ramayana such that Lava and Kusha

could sing. We must bring knowledge to the grass root level.  

Best regards.

Happy New Year.

Bijoy Misra
