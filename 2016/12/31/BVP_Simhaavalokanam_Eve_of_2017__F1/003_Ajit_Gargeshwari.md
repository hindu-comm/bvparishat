I agree when such discussions are started let only those members who can write on such threads post if they cannot they may simply read such posts. That will solve many problems. We should not have 'I support XYZ' type posts by those who do not share the approaches needed for rigorous scholarship and think that they should post their pet theory and everyone on the list should applaud such posts and need not have a different view. We should avoid posts saying I like what Vidvan or Prof. Says............ and not posting anything else substantial, which will make it appear one doesn't like what others have said. Please understand scholars are posting here in-spite of their numerous occupation keeping the larger cause in mind not that they don't have other forums or places to write. If one needs to start new mailing list please start no need to make such announcements here. Thanks
