Dear members,  
  
If I understand correctly, सुखप्राप्ति and दु:खनाश is desired by every चेतन. Traditional philosophy is aimed at finding methods to fulfill these two goals. Some schools of traditional philosophy only focus on fulfilling this in an ऐहिक sense (Eg: चार्वाक ), and the others in the पारत्रिक sense. They involve observation, reasoning, study of nature, study of literature, and then formulation of a set of practical activities that the Traditional philosophy practitioner follows to achieve those two goals.  
  
Indology, on the other hand, is a pure academic study -- "academic study of the history and cultures, languages, and literature of the Indian subcontinent " (wikipedia)  
Indology does not have the constraints of having to meet the goals of सुखप्राप्ति and दु:खनाश \| In fact, the study is an end goal in itself.  
  
The scope of Indology includes a wide range of topics many of which would be insignificant to the Traditional philosopher as they have no significant impact on achieving his clear goals. In the wake of new literature, new developments and discoveries in the world, the traditional philosopher has to only ascertain whether his method of achieving the twin goals of सुखप्राप्ति and दु:खनाश are still valid or not. Only to that extent does his interest in dealing with the Indologists lies.  
  
In this context, I would be interested in a forum where the validity of existing traditional philosophies can be debated in view of the findings that the Indologists. Since traditional philosophies are in Sanskrit and the Indologists are mostly English-speaking, it would be prudent to convert the English arguments to Sanskrit (as the philosophy being defended would be in Sanskrit)
