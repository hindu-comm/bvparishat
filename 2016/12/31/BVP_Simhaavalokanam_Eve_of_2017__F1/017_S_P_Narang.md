Respected Scholars,  
  
I am writing this mail with a strong and humble request to all of you and also with an expectation that all my seniors and friends who have nourished this list with their immense contribution in terms of both quality and quantity, would never go to such an extent by which the list will die it's death! (I mean this that's why I used the root die twice)  
  
विषवृक्षोऽपि संवर्द्ध्य स्वयं छेत्तुमसाम्प्रतम् ..  
  
No matter what it takes we shall work to reconstruct this list with your ideas. Never ever, we the owner or the management felt that list is owned by us. It is the list of scholars. As all of us have strong faith in democracy we will come to a good conclusion through debate which will I am sure will strengthen the list. I personally do not let any scholar leave this place. Everyone is important here. No question of leaving in the disguise of sacrifice.  
  
From the inception, it is made very clear that this list is meant for all discussions concerning Sanskrit, philosophy, Indology, history, archeology, art forms, language, grammar, or any subject that is connected with ancient Indian knowledge base. I hope all Sanskrit scholars in the list support my voice in saying that we Sanskrit scholars can not work in isolation. If at all we want we can educate others who are interested. Even within the list a big number of contributors belong to non-traditional Sanskrit learning but their contribution to the tradition is very significant. Sanskrit scholars who got training in traditional Shastric learning have showed us the right path. When this is the case why is this question of Sanskrit and non-Sanskrit ? I urge all scholars not to split the vote here. Let's work together. This is the time to show the unity and work for our tradition. This is the place where scholarly community get information, knowledge and what not ? We all have mutually benefitted.  
  
The personal attacks and showing fingers at others may happen sometimes due to misunderstanding of the lines that are read without the persons presence. Same line would mean in different way if it is heard in person. Hence the remote debate always will increase the distance. Let's find out a way. People can sort out the issues by meeting others. This is just a Dias of sharing.  
  
I apologies for any lapses on behalf of the management. We have already taken some steps again and we will soon sort it out. Till then please please close this discussion.  
  
BTW today I had a long discussion with Dr. Shatavadhani Ganesh Ji who is a senior member of this group who has expressed his concerns about this happening. Many people like him are in silence but want a peace here.  
  
Any concerns please write to me or prof Pandurangi. We try to solve the issues in an unbiased way to the best of our abilities. All scholars here in this list be a Shastric or a poet or an Indologist or a historian, have faith and respect in other disciplines and the parishrama of others in their own disciplines.  
  
संगच्छद्ध्वं संवदध्वम् .....  
  
Yours  
Shrinivasa varakhedi  
And  
Veeranarayana Pandurangi
