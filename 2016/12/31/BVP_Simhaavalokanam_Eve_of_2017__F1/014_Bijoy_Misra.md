Dear Sri Achar,

it would be prudent to convert the English arguments to Sanskrit (as the philosophy being defended would be in Sanskrit)

![](https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/x7Az90uC0FlqG1NQNJvbQl7YtYRlnWzoqu2O_ZLb9xIKhYpJarh3aZrZ_qlU6_VKMQpRwI5_nDi9FsJOqf0XSQHw_6yv1VK7rhIBScGS2g=s0-d-e1-ft#https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif)

There is no reason why should one make effort to engage is arguing anything with ignorance.

The only catch is that our young people read English and the new material is directed to them

possibly politically. My observation has been that the new academic scholars are not prepared

enough to sharpen their viewpoint. There is a pressure in the west to put the material in the

market before it is ripe. We have a large number of uncooked arguments. The fundamental

difficulty is that Indian system rejected all classification as a logical conclusion several thousand

years ago. The western logic is based on classes and the class differentiation infects to other

societies. The conclusion that everything has a self-expression आत्मभाव and an expressing capacity

अभिव्यक्ति is the basis of Indian cosmology. This idea is so profound that it may take several

more hundred (thosand?) years to be understood in the west. The west is still forming its intellectual

basis. 

  

But meanwhile India could erode. It can always feel that life is more of a competition than

existence. It is easier to look outward than inward. It is not easy to gauge that "existence" has no 

दुःख, it is eternal, classless neuter.

  

Can we salute the gentlemen who might have argued the conclusion several thousand years

ago in some form of BVP? Are we capable of analyzing it and present it to the world?

In the process we might discover the man and the process than read some tortured explanations.

So is my wish on this New Year's Day, 2017.

  

Best regards,

BM
