I think it's your mail client juno which is not compatible with Unicode. It also adds advertisements at the end of mails.

It appears that you have one gmail account too. I'll suggest to use web interface of Gmail to reply to BVP, it may eliminate problem.

If you are using any desktop client, please avoid it. Outlook and Thunderbird are Unicode compatible, you may use them though.
