Dear list

  

I am looking for this book

  

Title Mānava-darpaṇa

Author Raghuvaranārāyaṇa Siṃha

Publisher Pustakāyana, 1963

Length 274 pages

<https://books.google.co.in/books?id=tL1WAAAAMAAJ>  

  

The Delhi Public Library lists a newer edition

  

<http://delhipubliclibrary.in/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=29095>  

  

But the ISBN seems to be wrong, as a search for the ISBN9788189264516 leads to only the DPL page.

  

Does anybody know if a print or digital edition is available?
