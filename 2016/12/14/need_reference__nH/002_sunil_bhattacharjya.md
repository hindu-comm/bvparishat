Dear friends,  
  

So correct. Vaisheshika and Nyaya are needed as a stepping stone to higher knowledge. With the attainment of the knowledge of Nyaya-Vaisheshika, the aspirants may yearn for higher (spiritual) knowledge. Though Sankhya provides the higher knowledge, the plurality of the souls is still an issue. That is why Lord Krishna brackets Sankhya and Yoga together. The eight-limbed Yoga with Svadhyaya and Ishvara-Pranidhana in it, helps the aspirant to reach the goal.
