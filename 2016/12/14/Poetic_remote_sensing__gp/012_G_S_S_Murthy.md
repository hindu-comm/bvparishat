Der Dr.Misra,

The learned and respected commentator has given 3 reasons for treating those sargas as extrapolations. 1. They are missing in several manuscripts. 2. There is discrepancy between those sargas and the previous sargas.(The discrepancy is in the narration of the story.) 3. There is seamless continuity even without these sargas.

Having stated that I need to say that I would very much like that Valmiki himself was the author of that fantastic description.

REgards,

Murthy
