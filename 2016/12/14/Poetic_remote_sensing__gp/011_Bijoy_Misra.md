Dear Dr Murthy,

Is there a logic for the conclusion?

What I have heard is that the commentators apply "common use"

or the prevailing practices in order to edit text. The observation that

the earth could be spherical and a celestial object certainly would not

fit into the scholars of religious practices. I have heard that Sayana threw

away or made his own religious interpretation when the Veda lyrics

appeared too secular. 

The credit for the conjecture of the spherical earth is attributed

to Pythagoras in 6th century BC. Aryabhatta in India (5th century AD)

did analytic studies and estimated the size of the sphere. But that

at a point in space the earth and sun might create the same solid angle

was possibly not known until Kepler in 16th century AD.

Scholars of Indian astronomy like Dr Iyengar may have more light.

Best regards,

BM
