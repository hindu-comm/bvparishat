There are several such verses, mostly in plays. Most of them are modeled after kaalidaasa.( "shailaanaam avarOhateeva.... " from the seventh act of shaakuntalam). baalaraamaayana of raajashekhara, anargharaaghava of muraari, hanuumannaaTaka of unknown authorship, avimaaraka ascribed to bhaasa etc., Long ago I had written a paper ( in kannada ) on such arial observations of sanskrit poets. A scholar by name Dr. BhaavE from Pune had written, perhaps a book, on the arial route of meghadootam based on his own arial survey andstudies. I had attended his illuminating talk aided with slide show. It was really good and inspiring.
