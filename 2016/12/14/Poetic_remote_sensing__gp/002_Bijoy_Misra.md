Dear Ashokji,

  

Excellent. I just glanced through Raghuvamsa online. He gives a bird's eye view where the

surface features are recognizable. This can happen up to 10,000 ft.
What is remarkable about

Valmiki that the surface features merge and only mountains show up as humps of elephants

submerged in water. It gets more interesting as the brothers Sampati and Jatayu fly higher

towards the sun. They get disoriented since the sun got too bright and everything around looked

the same. (no navigational tools!) Jatayu (younger) got sick and Sampati covered him with his

wings. His wings burned out in heat! 

  

So is Sampati's description of losing his wings. I would think that the star positions

corresponding to sun were known by this time. There are other concepts also. Has there been

there any other effort to imagine/narrate flying in space? Other purAnas, stories, s'Astras ?

  

Disclaimer: I make a living through rocket flights in space. Hence my attention..
