While I respect the opinion, sometimes I do think that the text editing

is selective. Dropping difficult lines gets justified.with a rationalization.

I believe that some such lines might give a pointer to the prevailing

thinking. 

  

I do not think that Sampati's story is out of context. He claims that

he can see long distance. He wants to convince Angada that he

could see Sita in Lanka from that location (a hundred yojanas). 

  

इहस्थोऽहं प्रपश्यामि रावणं जानकीं तथा।  
  
अस्माकमपि सौवर्णं दिव्यं चक्षुर्बलं तथा।।4.58.30।।

The new thing comes regarding how far hawks can see, concept of garuDa etc.

  

Then he continues to narrate the story in order to express his inability

to fly since his wings were burnt away. Fanciful but logical!
