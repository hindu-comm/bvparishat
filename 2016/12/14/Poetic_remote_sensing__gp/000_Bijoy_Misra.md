Dear friends,

  

I am preparing for a segment to be recorded by the local Public Television

under a segment entitled Poetry in America<http://www.poetryinamerica.org/>

I will cover our efforts called India Poetry which completed twentieth year this

year. In the process I came across the following line which I call Valmiki's

remote sensing.This is Sampati narrating the earth view as he flew towards

the sun. I am reproducing from the online version:

  

हिमवांश्चैव विन्ध्यश्च मेरुश्च सुमहान्नगः।  
  
भूतले सम्प्रकाशन्ते नागा इव जलाशये।।4.61.9।।  

  

I will appreciate if anyone has other lines elsewhere.  

  

Best regards,

BM
