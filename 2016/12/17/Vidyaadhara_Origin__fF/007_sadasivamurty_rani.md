Jimutavahana, the Hero of the play NAGANANDA written by the KingSriharsha, was said to be the Monarch of Vidyadhara Clan. As Sri Harsha was a patron of Buddhism it is believed that the source of Nagananda is from Bauddha Jataka tales.

  

But the efforts of the Hero Jimutavahana in this play is to save the race of the snakes by offering himself as a Prey to Garuda. Garuda according to the Puranas is the vehicle of Vishnu (Vishnuratha). Then the story ends with the blessings of Siva and Parvati- Jimutavahana was saved from dying state due to the prayers of Malayavati, the spouse of Jimutavahana. In order to save him Garuda brings Amrta from Indra.

  

Thus this story deals with all Hindu Gods and narrates us the story of Jimutavahana, the Monarch of Vidhyadhara clan.

  

Similarly in the Skandapurana and also in many Siva stotras and Devi Stotras a frequent reference to Vidyadhara clan is available.
