There is a highly informative and carefully written dissertation on the Vidyādharas in German:  
  
Grafe, Jörg. 2001. Vidyādharas: früherste Zeit bis zur kaschmirischen Bṛhatkathā. Frankfurt am Main \[etc.\]: Peter Lang.  
  
According to Grafe, the Vidyādharas begin to appear in the Indic tradition roughly with the Theravāda literature and the Rāmāyaṇa.  
  
a.a.
