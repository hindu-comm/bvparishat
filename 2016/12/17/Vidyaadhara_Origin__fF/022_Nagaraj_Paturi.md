\> Already traditionally ' Vedanga" is recognized as distinguished from 'Vedas/Vedic'

  

----- 'Vedanga is recognized as distinguished from Vedas' goes without saying. Butto put Vedic after a slash '/' with Vedas is not fair not correct. This leads to the implied sentence 'Vedanga is recognized as distinguished from Vedic" . If Vedanga isnot 'Vedic' what is? At least some western scholars not ready to accept the present traditional Indian astrology as 'Vedic Astrology' were ready to call Vedanga Jyotisha as Vedic. Your formulation makes even Vedanga Jyotisha not Vedic. 

  

  

\> Otherwise all Sanskrit literature will be an unstructured mass with no discriminatory characters.

  

------ Why? If one is interested in knowing whether a certain word is found in the Vedas, they can directly ask so in stead of asking if that word is Vedic. In what way, taking two different meanings for the questions "Is it in the Vedas?" and "Is it Vedic?" render all Sanskrit literature as an unstructured mass? Moreover, contrary to your opinion, distinguishing between those two questions createsbetter structured view of Sanskrit literature. 

  

To say that vēdōchcharita / vēdaśr̥ta is different from vēdāviruddha /
vēdānurūpa / vēdānusāri / vaidika leads to a more nuanced understanding than not being able to distinguish between the two.

  

The issue at stake here is continuity from the texts / culture of one period to the texts / culture of the other. While dealing with the continuities and discontinuities , unities and diversities of a certain culture, a well nuanced understanding takes care of the intricate connections between continuities and discontinuities , unities and diversities. Looking for continuities and unities with such an intricate nuanced understanding is academics that ishealthy for the nation. Emphasizing discontinuities and diversities whenever continuities and unities are highlighted is being done with a purpose. Hope learned scholars recognize those purposes sooner than later.
