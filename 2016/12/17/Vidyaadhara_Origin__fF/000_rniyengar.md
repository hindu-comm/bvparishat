Dear Scholars,

Vedic literature has references to semi-divine beings such as Gandharva, Yaksha, Kimpurusha/Kimnara. The special Vidyaadhara group is perhaps not cited in any where in Vedic literature. If I am wrong please correct me with references. I seek further information on Vidyaadhara. The word appears in the Harivamsha (based on memory. I have to search!) and in some PuraNas. I am interested in the historical issues and not so much about what ISKCON website or Kamakoti web site says about Vidyadhara-loka. Whatever might have been the need for introducing this special group of beings into the ancient society, is it possible their occurrence in Sanskrit literature has happened due to Buddhist and/or Jaina influences?

best regards

  

RN Iyengar
