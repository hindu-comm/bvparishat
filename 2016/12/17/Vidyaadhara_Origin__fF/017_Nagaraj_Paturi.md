Let me get back to the question of 'Vedic' , since this is being taken up by the western Indologists too in a big way.

  

This English word has the suffix -ic in it, which seems to be close to the Sanskrit suffix -इक. Is the English word Vedic being used as

  

equivalent of the Sanskrit "वैदिक " ?

  

How do we look at ideas such as Puranas and Mahabharata as Panchama Veda ?How do we understand "इतिहासपुराणाभ्यां

  

वेदार्थमुपबृंहयेत् ". Do wehave to look for एकवाक्यता between the Vedas , Puranas, Ramayana and Mahabharata or not? In other words

  

do we consider Puranas, Ramayana and Mahabharata asवैदिक/ Vedic or not?

  

Recently, during some other search, I found the book " Sanskrit Epics : Representation of Vedic Myths" by Danielle Feller. Do we not

  

have to work from a tradition insiders' point of view aboutवेदार्थ उपबृंहण with the details of which Vedic idea isconnected to which idea of

  

Puranas, Ramayana and Mahabharata in which way?

  

The view that Puranic /Agamic texts/ culture 'were influenced by' /'incorporated' elements of 'Buddhist' / 'Jain' or otherlocal (folk)

  

cultures can in fact be viewed as a natural consequence of intercultural interface resulting in various developments such as

  

syncretisms, assimilations etc.. If an element /aspectof some local /folk culture are something like that enters the Puranic/ Agamic

  

cultureitcan not happen without that element or aspect being coherent with the spirit of the Vedas. Hence even such Puranic /Agamic

  

elements too can safely becalled asवैदिक/ Vedic .

  

Those who demand for an evidence inside the texts of Vedas for something to be called as 'Vedic' , do not speak a word about the

  

major festivals of Christianity, Christmas, Easter being pagan festivals (as mentioned [here](http://www.tomorrowsworld.org/commentary/is-religious-syncretism-a-good-thing))in their origin but still being called as

  

Christian.
