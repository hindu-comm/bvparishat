Iyegar was seeking in Vedic Literature the occurrence of Vidyadhara and not in classical literature. Classical literature beginning from Puranas, he has seen in Harivamsha in the first post itself without quoting the occurrences.

  

It is not clear whether his cassification include Puranas as questioned by Mr. Nagaraj. As Madhusudana Saraswati mentioned in प्रस्थानभेदसंग्रह "वेदः स च मन्त्रब्राह्मणात्मकः ।" वेद is for मन्त्र and ब्राह्मण portions only and आरण्यक portions including Upanishads is excluded. Western scholars consider any literature relating to Veda, Vedanta and Upanishads as Vedic literature. Mahabharata considered as Fifth Veda.

  

इतिहासः पुराणं च पञ्चमो वेद उच्यते \[भागवतम्१.४.२०\] ।

  

Strictly त्रयी excludes अथर्ववेद. Patabjali counts अथर्ववेद as fourth. Extended to Mahabharata and Purana, as Fitfth Veda. Including उपवेद-s number can be extended.

  

Mr. Nagarajan has quoted from Upanishat earlier. Any more in occurrences in Four Veda-s of Vidyadhara will be satisfying Mr.Iyengar's querry. Any extension as explained by Nagaraja can also be inclded. But as Iyengar has kept Harivamsha, out, he seems to look for in वेद texts four or including Upanishads.
