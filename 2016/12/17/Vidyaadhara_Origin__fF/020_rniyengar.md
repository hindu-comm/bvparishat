Thanks to members for discussing this topic.The points put up were useful. Regarding my use of the word "Vedic literature" my contention is that in academic discussions one needs to have some common notation. Otherwise all Sanskrit literature will be an unstructured mass with no discriminatory characters. While individual perceptions can vary widely, I have the feeling that the word Vedic can be used for Samhita, Brahmana, AraNyaka and the accented Upanishads. On BVP we mainly discuss about TEXTS that are available in print. It would be a safe approach in such discussions to agree that "Vedic" means those with accents. Already traditionally ' Vedanga" is recognized as distinguished from 'Vedas/Vedic' We may refer to these as Ancillaries, including the Parishishtas. Purana texts are influenced by the Vedas; no doubt about that. But any interested person comparing Vedic Samhitas with any PuraNA will immediately recognize that the two types of literature are different in many ways. It is possible, not being a a professionally trained Indologist/Sanskritist my thinking is different from traditional points of view. Any way thanks to Prof.Paturi for his PoV.
