\> The special Vidyaadhara group is perhaps not cited in any where in Vedic literature.

  

--- Can you kindly elaborate your usage of the word 'Vedic literature', since it means different things to different people. For example, for me Puranas are Vedic. Since you say , "The word appears in the Harivamsha (based on memory. I have to search!) and in some PuraNas" and while at the same time you say, "The special Vidyaadhara group is perhaps not cited in any where in Vedic literature" , you seem to consider Harivamasha and Puranas not as Vedic literature. Probably you consider the Veda mantras, Brahmanas, Aranyakas and Upanishads alone as Vedic literature. At the same time, you say also, "Vedic literature has references to semi-divine beings such as Gandharva, Yaksha, Kimpurusha/Kimnara.". So probably you have evidences for the description of Gandharva, Yaksha, Kimpurusha/Kimnara in what you consider as Vedic literature.

  

Can you kindly elaborate?
