Points to consider:.

  

1\. The word is a Sanskrit word, not a pālī one.

  

2\. The word vidyā in this has been theorized (in modern Jain, Buddhist and 'Hindu' discussions) to be referring to a. khēcharī vidyā b. mantravidyā in particular or vidyā in general.

  

3\. It could actually mean different things in different contexts.

  

4\. The etymological meaning of the word'knowable' indicates that it is not invented/ created/ 'generated'/ 'produced' knowledge, but 'dis-covered' knowledge. To perceive such a discovered knowledge(whether of a particular strand of it orknowledge in general), rather units of it, as already existing out there to be found out, isnot only rational but even beautiful.

  

5\. When such a coinage for this idea occurred in oral tradition isimpossible to trace. What can be traced is only its earliest entry into written texts.

  

6\. The coinage must have occurred in the hands of those concerned about *knowing,* not in the hands of the generalpublic, not concerned about it.
