द्वितीयायां समुत्क्रान्तो भवेद्यक्षो महात्मवान्

  

विद्याधरास्तृतीयायां गान्धर्वस्तु चतुर्थिका ॥13॥ नादबिंदूपनिषद्

  

The relative chronology of the text is placed by Mircea Eliade with the ancient Yoga Upanishads. He suggests that it was composed in the same period when the following texts were composed – Maitri Upanishad, the didactic parts of the Mahabharata, the chief Sannyasa Upanishads and along with other early Yoga Upanishads such as Brahmabindu, Brahmavidya, Tejobindu, Yogatattva, Kshurika, Yogashikha, Dhyanabindu and Amritabindu.These and the Nadabindu text, adds Eliade, were composed earlier than the ten or eleven later yogic Upanishads such as the Yoga-kundali, Varaha and Pashupatabrahma Upanishads.

Gavin Flood dates this text, along with other Yoga Upanishads, to be probably from the 100 BCE to 300 CE period. Guy Beck dates it to be probably from the pre-Christian era and the earliest document on the Yoga of sacred sound, while Georg Feuerstein suggests that the text is likely from a period in early 1st millennium CE. Mikel Burley states that this text does not provide techniques of Hatha Yoga, but probably influenced the later Hatha yoga texts.

The Upanishad is also referred to as *Nadabindu Upanishad* or Nadabindupanisad (नादबिन्दूपनिषत). It is listed at number 38 in the serial order of the Muktika enumerated by Rama to Hanuman in the modern era anthology of 108 Upanishads. In the Colebrooke's version of 52 Upanishads, popular in north India, it is listed at number 17. The Narayana anthology also includes this Upanishad at number 17 in *Bibliothica Indica*. In the collection of Upanishads under the title "Oupanekhat", put together by Sultan Mohammed Dara Shikhoh in 1656, consisting of a Persian translation of 50 Upanishads and who prefaced it as the best book on religion, the Amratanada is listed at number 43 and is named *anbratnad*.\[<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadabindu_Upanishad>\]
