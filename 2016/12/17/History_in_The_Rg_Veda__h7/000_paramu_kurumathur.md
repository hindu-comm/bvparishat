Dear friends,

  

Am new to this group. My interests are Sanskrit as a language and also history in the Vedas (especially the Rg Veda). My feeling is that some of the hymns in the Rg Veda can be interpreted as historical events. Have already done analysis of a couple of possibilities like the Vrshaakapi hymn (10.86). See [oursanskrit.com](http://oursanskrit.com).

  

Would be interested if you can point me to hymns / stanzas which you feel could depict historical events. The main thing is the "ha" moment where you suddenly see a stanza or a complete hymn as possible events in history.

  

Regards
