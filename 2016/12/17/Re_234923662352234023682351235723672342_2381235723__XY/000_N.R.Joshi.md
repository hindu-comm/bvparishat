Dear Bhatji,

Possibly you can help me with a query in this context.

I need a reference which delineates the classification of humans like

pis'Acha, rAkshasa, vAnara, kinnara in visible and gandharva, chAraNa, vidyAdhara etc in the invisible.

I have heard that there is mention of a fourteen way gradation.

deva and dAnava are possibly in the mix.

Clues?

Regards,

BM
