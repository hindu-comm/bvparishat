Namaste,

  

I have seen the paper cover of "**Valmiki Ramayana - with selected commentaries**" edited by the Chairman of RS Vidyapeeth, Tirupathi **Prof.Harekrishna Sathpathy, Prof. PM Nayak and Prof. P.Geervani.**

  

I would like to know whether the commentaries are in english and whether the Govindaraja's "Bhushana" is included in those selected commentaries or not.

Are the entire 7 kandas available for purchase?

  

How to procure those volumes thru RS Vidyapeeth, TPTY.

  

regs,

sriram
