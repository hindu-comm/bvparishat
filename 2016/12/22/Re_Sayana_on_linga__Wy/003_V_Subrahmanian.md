We have a famous Lingāṣṭakam where occurs this expression: सर्वसमुद्भवकारणलिङ्गम् where the Linga is the source of the entire creation.

  

Sri Nagaraj Paturi's observation is quite pertinent: those who worship the Linga do not do that with the idea that they are devoted to the phallus of Shiva but they are actually worshiping Shiva Himself. The idea is: Shiva and the Linga are non-different. Just like sāligrāma is worshiped as Vishnu.
