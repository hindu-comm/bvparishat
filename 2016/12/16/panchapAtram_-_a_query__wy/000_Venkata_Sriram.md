Namaste,



In सन्ध्या तत्त्व सुबोधिनी (the e-book in telugu can be downloaded from the below link) vide page no. 233, it has been mentioned that while doing sandhyavandana, one should have pancha-pAtra which we are aware of. However, contrary to the usual practice, it says that one should have 5 pAtrAs (5 vessels) and the author refers to smruti-muktA-phalaM.
However, I didn’t find this shloka in Ahnika-kANDa of smriti-muktA-phalam of Vaidyanatha Dikshitar.



The following is the link to download the e-book:

For non-telugu people, producing below the shloka as below:



////////

“कुर्वीत पञ्चपात्रं तु सन्ध्योपास्तौ गृहे द्विजः । उपस्पर्शे प्राशनेऽर्घ्ये मार्जनेऽषु विमोचने”

////



The author advices to use 5 vessels for the following purvAngAs of sandhya:

· upasparsha

· prAshana

· arghya

· mArjana

· vimOchana



However, nowhere, I have observed people using 5 pAtrAs for sandhyAvandana. Even, the siSTa-brAhmaNAs use one extra pAtra which is used for “arghya” only and I have been taught like this by my vedic teacher. Personally, I use 2 pAtrAs viz., one for Achamana and another for arghya.



Can somebody show me the reference where this usage of 5 pAtrAs (for panchapAtra) is mentioned. AFAIK (as learnt from my elders) that “pancha” means “wide” and hence we have to take a “wide open-ended pAtra” for sandhyAnuSTAna.



Regs,

Sriram
