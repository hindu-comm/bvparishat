Dear Sriram ji,

  

By two pātram-s do you mean two pātram-s apart from the arghya pātram, which is a kind of a basin? I have seen śiśṭa-s in Karnataka using two vessels and a basin (for pouring the arghya water into). Of the two vessels mentioned, one is with an uddharani from which āchamanam is performed. The other is a kind of a small chombu, pot, which contains maximum water that is used for prokṣaṇam, arghyam, etc. The first said vessel with uddharaṇi is kept separate from the chombu because āchamanam involves ucchiṣṭha and such śeṣa water is not fit to be used for arghya to surya, devata-s, etc. Hence two separate vessels apart from the basin.

  

regards
