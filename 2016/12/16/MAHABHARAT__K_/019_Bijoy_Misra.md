Dear Bhatji,

It is difficult to shake people from religious beliefs. Empowerment through

work is a product of overall well being of people. While it is the only truth

there is, it can easily appear as a slogan of intellect. It is easy to look

for truth outside than probing inside. 

  

My thinking is that beliefs grow when people freeze the physical nature of

books. This might have come with interaction with the book-oriented

belief systems in the west. To reduce the natural order of the universe

from the functionality of objects, into regimented order of clans, groups

and cults is possibly the problem. 

  

I gave an example from Valmiki a few days back about Sampati flight

in space. The important point that Valmiki makes (that appealed me)

was the discovery that the space has no direction.

  

न दिग्विज्ञायते याम्या नाग्नेयी न च वारुणी।

  
युगान्ते नियतो लोको हतो दग्ध इवाग्निना।।4.61.11।। 

  

Once we encourage people to read the original texts than following

belief-oriented instructions, I believe people would be more creative

and more empowered which is the goal anyway!

  

Best regards,

  

Bijoy Misra
