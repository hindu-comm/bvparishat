Yes. There is a belief in vogue as said by Sri Ajit ji that Mahabharata should be started reading from Adi Parvan. This belief is popular in Andrha Pradesh also. The reason emphasized upon is that the beginning of the Mahabharata is with the Sarpayaga of Janamejaya and the demise of Parikshit which is considered inauspicious.

  

But in fact nothing bad had happened to me though I possess both Devanagari version and Telugu script Version of Vedavyasa's Mahabharata at my home. Even from the times of my grand father and my father they possessed Mahabharata at home. My father gave 27 readings of entire Mahabharata including Harivamsa during his life time who lived for 84 years. Never any evil took place.

  

We cannot deny the validity of belief though nothing had happened. May it be the reason, as said by Sunil ji that we possess The Ramayana, 18 puranas including Bhagavata Purana (which is said to be the very literary manifestation of Lord Srikrishna) in our personal collection, we are safe in the hands of Lord Srikrishna. 

  

Let us expect any supporting slokas from the other scholars in support of either to possess or not to possess it with us.

Warm Regards,

Mahabharata is not read from adiparva to the last parva unlike other puranas. I have heard people say not to display painting or picture depicting Krishnas discourse of Bhgavad Gita with armies standing on either sides in ones living room. There are several such beliefs about mahabharta.

Mahabharat is a Holy Book and has great respect in the Society. Why this is advised, not only by the ordinary man, even by Acharyas, not to keep in the house ?
