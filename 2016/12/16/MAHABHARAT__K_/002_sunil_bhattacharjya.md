As the Mahabharata war was the consequences of dispute between two groups of cousins, there is a belief among some (not all) that keeping the Mahabharata in home may lead to such family disputes. Moreover the Mahabharata is not an easy text for all to understand and realizing that Vedavyasa subsequently wrote the Bhagavatam, giving all the essence of the Vedic literature.. The Bhagavatam is caonsidered the vangmayee-roopa of Lord Krishna himself and people generally prefer to keep the Bhagavatm instead.
