I happened to do a course under a group of 'intellectual' scientists in the last week who argued that all that happened in Mahabharata was unfair and biased and that Krishna brainwashed Arjuna to fight the war and kill his cousins. They gave many such arguments which was based on their own understanding about Mahabharata. They did not believe in Guru-shishya tradition at all. While this was going on, I saw this thread in the group. The case with them was the lack of a Guru and lot of intellect resulting in misinformation of the text. Now I am wondering, could this have been a possibility (possibility of misinterpretation without the guidance of a Guru) that it was said Mahabharata should not be kept at home?

  

Regards,

  

Vinay
