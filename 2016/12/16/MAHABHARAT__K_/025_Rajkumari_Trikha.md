Namaskaram and happy new year to all.  
This thread is very interesting.

I myself have full text of the MBh. in my home. I have gone through it several times and have written three books on the Mahabharata.  
1.महाभारत में योगविद्या  
2. महाभारत में विज्ञान दर्शन और समाज  
3. महाभारत की बोध कथाएँ  
  
Nothing inauspicious happened.

About the common beliefs

I feel it takes a longer time to do its parayana as compared with other holy books , bhagawat/Ramayana. May be its public katha sessions were disturbed by frequent foreign invasions, and so it was believed that Mahabharata's reading is inauspicious.

Secondly, disputes of kuru family can trigger disputing mentality. Vastu also advises to keep those things in forefront, which direct mind for positive thinking. It is all psychological.
