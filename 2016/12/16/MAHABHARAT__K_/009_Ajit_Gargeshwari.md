The word Guru has to be defined. How does one know A so called ‘Guru’ is right and all others are wrong. If it confined to one’s personal beliefs I have nothing to add.



Good scholars who have made deep studies, subject matter experts are gurus. Why does one need Guru Shishya traditions for Mahabharata study. One can read the Mahabharata and ask for expert clarification with an expert. Each person will have his own view and can have different interpretations based on ones learning.



If one needs to make serious studies one will have do away with this guru shishya tradition in which argues for one own gurus view point and consider oneself as the greatest champion if one has outclassed a rival camp.

I happened to do a course under a group of 'intellectual' scientists in the last week who argued that all that happened in Mahabharata was unfair and biased and that Krishna brainwashed Arjuna to fight the war and kill his cousins. They gave many such arguments which was based on their own understanding about Mahabharata. They did not believe in Guru-shishya tradition at all. While this was going on, I saw this thread in the group. The case with them was the lack of a Guru and lot of intellect resulting in misinformation of the text. Now I am wondering, could this have been a possibility (possibility of misinterpretation without the guidance of a Guru) that it was said Mahabharata should not be kept at home?
