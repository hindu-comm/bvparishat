Transforming the epics as religious edicts has been the problem.

They should be treated as marvelous literary compositions depicting

the nature and culture of the society at a time in the past. The morals

and the empiricism would apply and they would need interpretation.

The scholars have a role to play in this as the inheritors of the scholarly work.

Huge amount of disservice has happened through literal interpretation

possibly begun by the outside invaders to figure out a way to rule.

I would assert that all principal poetic compositions have an angle of education

and analysis than propelled by conservative dogmatism.

We must be open to celebrate India's own discovery of freedom and truth!
