Mahabharata is not read from adiparva to the last parva unlike other puranas. I have heard people say not to display painting or picture depicting Krishnas discourse of Bhgavad Gita with armies standing on either sides in ones living room. There are several such beliefs about mahabharta.

Mahabharat is a Holy Book and has great respect in the Society. Why this is advised, not only by the ordinary man, even by Acharyas, not to keep in the house ?
