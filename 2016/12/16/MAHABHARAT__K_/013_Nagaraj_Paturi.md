"Such a belief must have been limited to certain regions or communities."

  

 ---- Prof. Deshpande

  

I don't know, whether this belief exists in other parts of the country or not; but here in Telugu speaking areas, it is believed that purāṇa pravachana or narrative performance of virāṭa parva brings rains.

  

Beliefs about positive benefits of reading or reading out or narrative performance of different specific portions of Mahabharata do exist.

  

The belief mentioned in the initiatingpost of the thread could not have existed, for example, in mādhva families, because mādhvas look at the book as the story with Bhima, the avatāra of vāyu, the jīvōttama as the hero andHari, the sarvōttama as thefacilitator of all the events in the narrative. 

  

Among the ancients too, the view was variegated.

  

Anandavardhana viewed it asśāntarasapradhāna: nirvēda orśama as sthāyībhāva . 

  

There is a Jain adaptation of Mahabharata in Kannada dated 8th century AD. The presentation is with non-violence as message. (In fact, in the Vyasa's version itself, "ahimsā paramō dharmah" occurs a huge number of times.The book can comfortably be read as an anti-war warning to humanity. (Details may takeanotherthread/post)

  

My Guruji, Prof. G V Subrahmanyam argued that dharmavīra is the angirasa of the book. (I argued that the theories ofśānta as angirasa and dharmavīra as angirasa as mutuallyreconcilable.)

  

It is said that in the Indian Army Mahabharata narration is used to instilboth a war-ready ( vīra)and war-withstanding (śānta) mindset among the soldiers.

  

At leastin legends , it is mentioned that Jijiya Bai used Mahabharata and Ramayana to instil vīra bhāva in Shivaji.

  

This list of perspectives can go onand on and on.
