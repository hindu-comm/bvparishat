There are many slokas giving phalasruti of reading theMahabharatha.So it was really intended to be recited at home. Many historical evidence to prove that endowments

were made in temples for daily recitation of TheMahabharatha.Anecdotal evidence in connection with MelputhurNarayanaBhattathiri and AmbalapuzhaKing also suggests daily reading of TheMahabharatha.There is also a belief that for overcoming of obstacles in daily life Mahabharatha is best suited for here SriKrishna comes to our help

the way He helped ThePandavas.Now to end I have a question.Eventhough TheMahabharatha contain a mode of recital ie during the period of chathurmasya there may be other modes of recital.Books on karmakanda may throw light on this.You are requested to help me.I completed one re citation in 280hours.
