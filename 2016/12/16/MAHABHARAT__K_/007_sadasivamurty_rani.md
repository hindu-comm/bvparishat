There is strong reason for such belief among the learned folks in Andhra Pradesh.

Nannayya or **Nannaya Bhattaraka**, a court poet of Raja Raja Narendra was said to have been the First Classical Poet in the literary history of Andhra (Hence called ADI KAVI in TELUGU).

  

He was the poet, who for the first time attempted to translate the Sanskrit Mahabharata in to Telugu in metrical style. He began with Adi Parava. He could successfully complete ADI PARVA, SABHA PARVA and a HALF of VANAPARVA. The he abruptly died. So the Translation of Mahabharata was left in the middle.

  

Then **Tikkana Somayaji**, the court poet of the King Manuma Siddhi of Nellore region took the responsibility. He having left the VANAPARVA part could complete all the remaining from Virataparva to Svarga Arohana Parva.

  

Later, **Erra Preggada** took up the job and finished the VANA PARAVA Part.

  

Thus these three were popularly known as "KAVI TRAYA" or the TRIO of POETS.

Because of the abrupt ending of NANNAYYA this notion of inauspiciousness had ever since come into existence.
