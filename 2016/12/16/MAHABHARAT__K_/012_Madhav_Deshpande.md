Dear Nagaraj-ji,

  

  I very much like your analysis. Writing and copying manuscripts was a very expensive business. The documents from the Peshwa daftar in Pune show many instances of the Peshwas paying large sums of money to have copies of Sanskrit texts made for them. Such large sums of money were indeed beyond the means of common people, and hence the existence and circulation of manuscripts was limited by the economy of the production of such manuscripts. Some manuscripts may have been produced by dedicated individuals for their own personal use, as is the case of some of the Vedic manuscripts that I have studied and used in my research, but it it more likely that the large numbers of surviving manuscripts were produced either under royal patronage, patronage by wealthy individuals, or by institutions like the Mutts and Jain and Buddhist Sanghas. The belief of not keeping the Mahabharata manuscripts at home must be seen on the background of this reality. My grand mother routinely used to read the pothi of Marathi Pāṇḍava-Pratāpa, a version of the Mahābhārata story, along with other pothis like Harivijaya, Rāmavijaya etc., and I was not aware of this belief of not reading the Mahabharata at home. Such a belief must have been limited to certain regions or communities.
