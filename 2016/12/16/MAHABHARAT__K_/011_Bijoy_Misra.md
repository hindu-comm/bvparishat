A simple knowledge of Sanskrit grammar would not be enough to interpret the

scriptural texts. There are nuances of the culture, practice of the language

and the poetic rendition. Most of the rapid translations that have happened

in the west for the sake of "curiosity" fail on each of these. I had confronted

one of the major translators last year to ask him what qualifies him to translate

the epic literature of India. He did not have a response but conveyed indignant

irritation. Most use dictionaries to make sense and they go for glossy printing.

Apparently there is money in the market.

  

These artificial translations become the reading material for our university

students who are inbred to be confused about the values of the Indian tradition.

The goal of western tradition is survival (Darwin) and competition. The ideal

of dharma etc through analysis is a tall order to contemplate. The families

and the parents shout for "survival." This process creates the modern "intellectuals"

who cannot but identify themselves of Indian descent but never cultivated

what that descent entailed. Unfortunately they become the new teachers.

  

By sitting here in Boston, I see both back home and my colleagues here.

I sympathize my colleagues since they just do not know and had no opportunity

to know. They guess and fail royally. There could a tacit hunger for supremacy

in some low level "scholars". But I do get appalled when "scholars" back home

comment on the Vedas never having digested the material. Like my friends

in the local area, "scholars" back home pick up lines for their convenience

or from sources and make up "lectures". Apparently there is market for such

discourses as we witness in this thread.

  

We must recover!
