Dear Vdwan Vinayji,

  

Let us look at it this way.

  

If there is a belief that the book Mahabharata should not be kept at home, how old could that be?

  

Before print, before the paper manuscripts, there were palm leaf manuscripts. How manyhouseholds could have had those manuscripts at home? If having the manuscripts at home itself issuch a rare possibility, how widespread a belief that thebook should not be kept at home have been?

  

Possibility of many 'literate' 'educated' people having a copy at home itself is very much recent. So the belief itselfmust be of a recent origin.

  

Then the source of the belief: oneway of looking at the book is as a story of a severe split in a joint family, leading to a world war scale war. In the early days of printing, joint families were widespread. There was a scope for a superstition that the story of infight in a joint family could bring a similar result. Already, joint families have broken up in a big way. Even if joint families continued , a superstition, arecently born one is a superstition.

  

Yes, the role of right guidance, nullifying such superstitions, to whichyou gave the good name of Gurusishyaparamparaa , is crucial to avoid such superstitions growing.

  

These superstitious lot are deluded by too much of faith, whereas the 'intellectuals' that you mentioned are , deluded by theabsence (of proper understanding)of it.
