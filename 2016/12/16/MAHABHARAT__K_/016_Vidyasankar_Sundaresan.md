The belief about not reading the Mahabharata as one continuous account is present among Tamil families too. When I was a child, my grandmother insisted that I shouldn't read even the abridged English retelling by Rajaji from cover to cover. I remember she made me jump to the Yaksha Prashna after I had read the first thirty pages or so! Her argument was that reading it all in sequence would lead to feuds within the family.

  

That said, I like Prof. Paturi's take on it too. These attitudes towards printed versions of the itihAsa must have been inherited from other older attitudes about the content of the text itself.

  

Best regards,

Vidyasankar
