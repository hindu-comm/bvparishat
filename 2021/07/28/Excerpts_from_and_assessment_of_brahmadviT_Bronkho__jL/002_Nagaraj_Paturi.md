**Between Sound and Silence in Early Yoga: Meditation on “*Om*” at Death**

While sharing this on the Indology list, the author said :

  

Dear colleagues—

I’d like to draw your attention to the new issue of*History of Religions*(vol. 60, no. 3 February 2021), which features my article[“Between Sound and Silence in Early Yoga: Meditation on ‘Om’ at Death.”](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/711944)Pushing back against Johannes Bronkhorst’s contention that Brahmans played no role in the formation of early yoga, this article examines a mantra-based contemplative praxis that was central to Brahmanical constructions of yoga from the late Veda up through Patañjali and beyond. I hope my contribution will be of interest to list-members—especially in light of the upcoming online symposium at the University of Alberta on Bronkhorst’s Greater Magadha hypothesis.

  

Yours,

Finnian
