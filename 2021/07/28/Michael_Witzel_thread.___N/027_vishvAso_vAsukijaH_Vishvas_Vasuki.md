Look at my sentence: "Partly because of frenzied antipathy by some Hindus towards AIT, and partly because of his inevitable conditioning - he got pushed into the anti-Hindu political activism business during the first CA textbook battle."  
  
That there are two clauses in my sentence is apparent to anyone. It is strange that one is picked while the other is ignored since it is clear that both taken together give the exact nature of my current view.

This is a good example of criticism of content. I don't mind. Your assessment, as I have demonstrated above and elsewhere, is quiteworthless.

Oho - being underwhelmed by your failed efforts at delinking Witzel's bout of anti-hindu activism from anti-AIT frenzy is an insult to parents involved in 2006?

  

(PS: While you blow hot air here, I did my bit in the next cycle of the battle when I lived in California, in full coordination with parents and orgs involved.)

I agree with that attitude. My only point was that H should not go bonkers \_before\_ such hate is demonstrated.
