It does not matter whether a theory was originated by your enemies or whether you think it was hatched just to make you start fighting among yourselves (long shot). What matters is if it is correct or not - atleast as far as people who care abouttruth more than pedigree.

  

Just as your phone contains Chinese parts and you still use them etc..

Calling Michael Witzel a racial supremacist is a serious accusation. Precisely the kind of lowly loose talk which brings us discredit when done without the slightest shred of evidence.

You don't like it? Or sAvarkar's non-traditional views? Criticise theproposition. Say "it is trash". You're welcome to your views. Calling them "colonial slaves", "racial supremacists" etc.. just because theyhave such views is execrable.

  

There is so much dishonest presentation (not to mention "name calling") in even those two lines. You could have been a tabloid journalist. Just to correct one small bit: Honesty and boldness bring your calling them "slaves" and "not intellectually independent" to the dust. It was not proposed as a criterion for "tolerance", which is itself a weird word to use givenone can't go and shoot someone.

You called him racial supremacist. Now this. Given the former, youhave close to Zero credibility with the latter.

It's nowhere close to howpetty you're being - "Look racial supremacist".They're being forthright about what they think is wrong with the paper.
