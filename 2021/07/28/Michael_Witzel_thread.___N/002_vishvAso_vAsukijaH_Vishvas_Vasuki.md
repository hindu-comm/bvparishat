I recall that paper, but not Witzel's response or counter-responses. It would be useful if you quoted that communication here.

  

Looseness on his part wouldn't surpriseme - seems to be a widespread trait among Indologists (and "soft" sciences in general), where not everyone is kANe-like. For example, this absurdityrecorded in<https://talageri.blogspot.com/2021/02/fake-allegation-about-my-insulting.html> (witzel's reference to it being seen at <http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/Talageri-answer.htm> ) -  

**'Amusingly, HINDUTVA (given just like this – all in caps!), a book by the nationalist politician V. D. Sarvarkar, who closely worked with Italian and German fascists, is not further abbreviated in T.’s bibliography – indicating, in an almost Freudian way, the bent of mind of the author under discussion here. Nomen plenum est omen.'(§5).**
