How closely did Savarkar work with Italian and German fascists as is being claimed? What is the source of this claim and what is the evidence in support? We have two recent books on Savarkar by Vikram Sampath, does anybody know what they say on this.

  

I find it strange that Subhash Chandra Bose, the Indian who actually met Himmler and Hitler and worked/wanted to work closely with German Nazis is whitewashed by left-liberals but Savarkar is not spared even for a single day.
