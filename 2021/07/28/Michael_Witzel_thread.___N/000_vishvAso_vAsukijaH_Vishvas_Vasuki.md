In this thread, I intend to collect bits about Michael Witzel's scholarship and past activism,as I stumble upon them.

  

My gross impression, gathered from others, is that he is a generally worthy scholar who was initially more pro-Hindu than his American peers and sympathetic to worthy v1 students at his institution. Partly because of frenzied antipathy by some Hindus towards AIT, and partly because of his inevitable conditioning - he got pushed into the anti-Hindu political activism business during the first CA textbook battle.

  

Here is a very nice article by him about his memories of a Nepal which may have sadly passed - <https://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/Swadharma.htm>
