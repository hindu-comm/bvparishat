Namaste,

  

**काव्य शास्त्र विनोदेन**, कालो गच्छति धीमताम्।  
व्यसनेन च मूर्खाणां, निद्रया**कलहेन** वा। ।  

  

Amusingly both happen on this list!

  

A simple rule of thumb to follow to avoid such conflicts is to speak only for yourselves and not for others - example, in the very first mail in this thread, there was a defense for Wutzel as to why he has become anti-India. This was completely avoidable. Just remove that sentence and much of the garbage mail followed disappear!

  

Regards. . . .yoga
