"Any one who thinks that Savarkar and Tilak, who were respectively open and favorable towards Aryan invasion theory, were not intellectually independent, or (neo-)colonial slaves is displaying cretinism of the lowest order. Their positions were not a result of "desperation" as some imagine - but bold, honest, careful study."  

  

Ok to paraphrase this way?-  

"Some anticolonials tolerated AIT, so it is not colonial after all."?

  

To the extent even bold truthful people were supporting it, they were peddling colonial narratives. Savarkar had some views that were quite different from traditional Hindu positions and we cannot but say that his thinking was quite divorced from the common Hindu (E.g. his views on gomaataa). To this extent his views will be unacceptable.

  

Our problem is not in some people being independent and honest. It is about tolerating a colonial theory (purposefully or willy nilly). It is nobody's case that we need to repeat the mistakes of (even well-meaning) people of the past. Moreover the person in question here doesn't seem to be above water in his intentions. He is an out and out racial supremacist who wants to coopt some willing people on this side.

  

There is another low life on Twitter who peddled the obnoxious theory that Rama was not born to Dasharatha. This theory is exactly the same as peddled by the "architect" of kaanTiTuusan. And some slaves of this low life put their credibility at stake to defend this lie. They even went so far as to torture the meanings of Veda mantras. Going by you, we will have to tolerate all this because the person spouting this is "honest and bold" per you.

  

Our position is not vis a vis any political consideration (hindutva etc.) So the rest of your post is irrelevant.

  

The "brahmin loving" intellectual bully actually hates Hindus. An example of his execrable behaviour vis a vis an intellectual question was presented. If it is your case that the authors of the computational linguistics paper were hindutvawadis and prodded him for such a petty response, there is nothing more to discuss.
