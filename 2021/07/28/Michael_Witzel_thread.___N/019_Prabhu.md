namaste Mishra-ji.

  

I am not aware of anything that supports the claim you mention... however some facts like Shri Savarkar's foreward to one of Smt. Savitri Devi Mukherji's book, might give some material for whoever wants to make such claim.

  

Irrespective of which side one is w.r.t Shri Savarkar and fascism/nazism, between the general view of Hitler prevalent around 1939 (when the above mentioned book was published) and the view now.. there is a vast difference.

As George Orwell's essays reveal, for eg, there was no significant hatred among the British, especially the ruling class, towards Hitler during the years leading the WWII. Likewise, I guess, was in the rest of the world.
