"Partly because of frenzied antipathy by some Hindus towards AIT, and partly because of his inevitable conditioning - he got pushed into the anti-Hindu political activism business during the first CA textbook battle."

  

Oh "frenzied antipathy" against the obnoxious AIT shouldn't be there because neo-colonial masters of some neo-colonial slaves will be upset. They will descend into anti-hindu activism. "Hey, eeydeeyoTTs he was good to some V1s (brahmins) after all!"

  

I wish and pray that all colonial slaves become intellectually independent. Too many slaves lurking around. This doesn't bode well neither for this group nor for the nation.

  

One wishes that the fact that the worthy got a thorough whacking from a computer science journal for throwing the weight of his colonial hindside around also be recorded in this inauspicious thread for posterity. And no. The ones who he wanted to discredit were mathematicians and didn't know or care about the AIT. They indulged in the cardinal sin of suggesting that the Harappan "heiroglyphs" actually constitute a language (through sound mathematical reasoning). Something that went against the bully's pet theory.

  

Colonial slave mindset hasn't at all gone away. One is disgusted to see (not so) veiled apologetics for out and out colonial intellectual bullies.

  

Bhagavaan save us from intellectual slaves.
