Thanks Prof. Paturi. It's interesting. But I am also curious about the following statement in the originalmail, and what paper and journal is referred to here.:

  

"One wishes that the fact that the worthy got a thorough whacking from a computer science journal for throwing the weight of his colonial hindside around also be recorded in this inauspicious thread for posterity. And no. The ones who he wanted to discredit were mathematicians and didn't know or care about the AIT. They indulged in the cardinal sin of suggesting that the Harappan "heiroglyphs" actually constitute a language (through sound mathematical reasoning)."

  

Thank you.

  

Ramakrishnan
