I'd not responded to this bit because it is a stupid mischaracterization at many levels - but to forestall ill-effects of such neglect, here goes:

  

Any one who thinks that Savarkar and Tilak, who were respectively open and favorable towards Aryan invasion theory, were not intellectually independent, or (neo-)colonial slaves is displaying cretinism of the lowest order. Their positions were not a result of "desperation" as some imagine - but bold, honest, careful study.

  

The proper way to respond to Indologists seems to be the below (excerpted again from opinions of others, partly verbatim):

  

\- Favoring AIT is not equal to anti-hindutva. Idiots who conflate the two risk pushing some supporters of the former into becoming the latter.

-If they have interpreted something in a way that you don't like but are relatively firm ground doing so, the best you can do is write rebuttals.

\- If they havemade fallacious claims, presented false translations or false datings: expose those pointedly - without getting personal.

 - Attaching an example of a harsh review of some Indological work by one Indologist, which demonstrates the above.

\- In either of those cases, don't write hate mail. It reflects poorly on Hindus and provides raw-material for "victimhood" drama. (Unless of course, the Indologist does this first to some H.)

\- "However, if the said indologist indulges in H hatred (covert or overt), political activism against H power & H dominance in the Indian state or meddles in internal affairs of H with the aim of helping enemies of H or abrahamistic potentates then all bets are off. So the rule of the thumb is any attack on H political power should be mercilessly countered by all available means. "

 - Here too, until such a stage is reached, it is best not to shove them into such a corner. For the most part, it is best to simply leave them in a

state of non-enmity.
