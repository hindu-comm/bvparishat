The above is based on a misreading of a two sentence paragraph which began with "My gross impression, gathered from others, is that ...". The correct reading would understand "My gross impression, gathered from others, is that ..." to continue in the second sentence as well. As such, I was not speaking for Witzel, but stating "my gross impression". It was by no means a defence of Witzel, and "my gross impression" is subject to revision (which has so far not been warranted).

  

I don't protest the view that "garbage mail followed" (anyone is welcome to call my email "garbage", I won't cry for censorship) - though I just identify the "garbage mail" differently. I've said before in other threads -these meta-level mails where people start preaching about "thread going to dogs", "mailing list loosing its dignity" add nothing of value,and in fact stifle frank exchange of views (given that the persons most directly involved were not complaining). As such it is these meta-level emails which deserve to be called "garbage mail", coming from people who just won't use the gmail mute button on threads they don't like.
