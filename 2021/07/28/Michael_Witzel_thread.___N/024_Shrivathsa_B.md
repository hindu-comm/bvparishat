Mr. Vishvas,

  

I presented the instance of Witzel's intellectual bullying. If you don't want to see it, it is not my problem. Writing a "rejoinder" to a journal on a question where he has no training is indeed just bullying. The word "Intellectual" is actually unnecessary here. "Garbage in garbage out" is your cherry picked instance.

  

Witzel has a chequered history. His hindu hating side got exposed in the California Textbooks case. But you seek to lay the burden of Witzel's mistake at the door of "Hindutvawadis". This is worse than slavish. It is traitorous. You also insult the efforts of parents who genuinely wanted the content amended. This is typical victim shaming indulged in by many tabloid journalists.

  

We the self respecting Hindus also don't have the burden of proving ourselves to be a "good boys" to those who hate our dharma and at the same time try to appropriate it by trying to become its gatekeepers. You have such a burden perhaps. Don't ask us how to behave with an enemy, don't tell us that the enemy is actually a friend and my perception should be corrected.

  

You won't get any more responses from me on this thread any more.
