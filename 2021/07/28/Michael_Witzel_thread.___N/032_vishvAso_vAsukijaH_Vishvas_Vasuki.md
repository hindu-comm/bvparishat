I saw a similar claim in the "witzel dossier" provided by shrI vishAl:

  

"Moreover, Dominik tolerated 250 posts from Western Indologists deriding the level of science and engineering in India in a period of two months (this is strange because Indologists have little appreciation of science themselves!) in late 2000"

  

This led me to search using the keyword "engineering" and led me, after some effort, to<https://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology/2000-October/023202.html> by Steve Farmer (a thread of 68 posts), to which Vidyashankar (I hope he's recovered?) responded well -<https://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology/2000-October/023216.html> . It seems to have been an emotionally charged conversation.

  

So, now I can confidently state that "Farmer guy alleged that \*all\* Indian programmers are of low quality" is false.
