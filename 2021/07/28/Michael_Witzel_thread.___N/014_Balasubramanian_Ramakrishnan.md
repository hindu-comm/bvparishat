Thank you Shrivatsa-ji. I'll make more detailed comments later when I get time, but it's not very surprising. This same Farmer guy allegedthat \*all\* Indian programmers are of low quality in the "Indology" list. Lest anyone think that he was exaggerating, he quickly dispelled any such notion quite explicitly, and Prof. Witzel jumped to his defence saying that the number of Indian universities in the list of top Asian universities provided by someone was much lower than that of a much smaller nation like Japan, essentially implying Indians are stupid! So no wonder they are going after a CS Prof of Indian origin. Imagine if some such conversation had been conducted about Africa, Witzel would have been tarred and feathered and deposited outside Cambridge promptly.
