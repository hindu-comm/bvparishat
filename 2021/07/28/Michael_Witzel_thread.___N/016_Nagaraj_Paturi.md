Aadaraniya Nityanand-ji,

  

We have been announcing the moderating procedure of the list, time and again.

  

Not all mails arrive here after going through moderator's control.

  

Most mails arrive here without getting moderated.

  

All new members are moderated and they are changed to non-moderated or " allowed' category when they are found to be 1. frequently posting 2. not found to be impolite , indecent, unparliamentary in their posts.

  

Even such an "allowed' member when found to be violating the netiquette, public norms of politeness etc., is brought back under moderated category for a temporary period. After observing the member for some time, after confirming that the member mended his ways, member is again brought into the allowed category.

  

This is done for a balance between 1. reducing the burden coming from moderating every post 2. needs of moderation, like avoiding irrelevant posts, indecent posts, impolite behaviour posts etc.

  

When a member is brought back from moderated to allowed category, it is done in good faith.

  

But if a member is found to be repeatedly needing to get moderated, the admin committee shall think of some extreme step to avoid the repeated misbehaviour.

  

I have been getting messages like that of yours below from many members individually addressed to me about such mutually disrespectful use of language.

  

My view is that one can strongly articulate his view, his paksha without resorting to impolite, harsh language. Bitter debates need not have bitter language. powerful debates need not be verbally violent.

  

In any case, thanks for drawing the attention of the list and the admin to this aspect thatdeserves attention.

  

Regards,
