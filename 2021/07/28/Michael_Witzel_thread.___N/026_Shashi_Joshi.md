Just Sanskrit doesn't make one sanskAri.  
All the villains of the epics also spoke and were pundits of Sanskrit the language.

  

Nature, svabhAva, can't be transgressed, and everyone is slave to theirs.

As they say, treat a man according to his rank.

Treat a person according to his/her svabhAva, not just acquired skills.

  
  

Thanks,
