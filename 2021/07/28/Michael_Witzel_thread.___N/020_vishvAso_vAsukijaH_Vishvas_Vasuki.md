नमो वः।  
  
It is salient to distinguish the above into two categories:  
  
- Primarily criticism of content/ ideas -“stupid mischaracterization”,“displaying cretinism of the lowest order”,“lowly loose talk”  
- Insults to a person.“neo-colonial slaves”,“you could have been a tabloid journalist” (although this is borderline, given that it referred to "dishonest presentation")

  

IMO, there is no need to moderate the former.
