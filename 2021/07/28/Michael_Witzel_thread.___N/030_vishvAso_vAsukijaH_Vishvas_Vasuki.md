I found no evidence of the above in this dump (made for search convenience) of indology mailing list -<https://github.com/hindu-comm/mail_stream_indology> (I searched for "programmer" and "ranking"). I saw some related conversation at<https://list.indology.info/pipermail/indology/2009-April/> , wherein I observed the "garbage in garbage out" and "invented data" comments.

  

So, unless there is contrary evidence, these are some explanations for shrI BR's claim:

  

\- memory lapse+ prejudice

\- deletion of emails from their archive by list moderator (unlikely)

\- relevant mails sent in some other mailing list

  

In any case, these are matters of fact (Reasons could be debatable - genetics, nutrition, existential threats etc..):

  

\- Japanese ARE on average brighter than Indians (compare countrywise average IQ etc..)

\- Japanese have achieved far more per capita than Indians inscientificfields.

\- Indians are unfortunately among the leaders in scientific fraud.

  

The are broad (but substatiable) comparisons - but they need not be taken in a negative light. Rather, they should spur us to work harder and learn from more advanced cultures (in pertinent areas). The Japanese became what they are because of this ("sincere but critical student") attitude.
