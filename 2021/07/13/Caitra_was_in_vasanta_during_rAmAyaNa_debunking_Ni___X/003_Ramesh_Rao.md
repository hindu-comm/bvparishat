Glad that we are getting some traction on this matter.

  

That Nityananda ji has gone to the trouble of listing Nilesh ji's stonewalling and dismissive responses to his critics goes to show how frustrating it must be to deal with scholars who do not follow scholarly ways.

  

The unwillingness to engage with serious critics should be enough indication of the fragility of the Oak hypothesis.

  

Therefore, it is time to call the bluff on the 12209 date, and I hope there will be a co-authored article (Misra, Roy, Saranathan -- listing the authors alphabetically, no more, no less) published in a reputed journal that will put an end to the untenable but popular Oak thesis.

  

Regards,

  

Ramesh Rao
