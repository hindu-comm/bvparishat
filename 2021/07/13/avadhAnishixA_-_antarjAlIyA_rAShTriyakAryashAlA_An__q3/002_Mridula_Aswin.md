Respected Sir,

Namaste.

The entire credit goes to Dr Ramakrishna Pejathaya, Associate Professor at Chinmaya Vishwavidyapeeth, now Director of the Centre for Avadhanam, and Indic Academy, for mooting the idea and conceptualizing everything right from the establishment of the Centre. I am but a recent addition (As a Project Assistant) to this brilliant initiative to revive the unique art-form. We are grateful for your wholehearted wishes, and seek the support of all the scholars present in this Parishad, to succeed in our endeavour.  

  

Many Thanks,

  

सविनयम्,

Dr Mridula Aswin.
