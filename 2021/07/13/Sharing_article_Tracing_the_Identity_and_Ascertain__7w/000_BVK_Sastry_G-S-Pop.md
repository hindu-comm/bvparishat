1. Sharing a recent (2019) paper from one of Indias premier institutions :



 **Title**: Tracing the Identity and Ascertaining the Nature of Bharmi-derived Devanagari Script

**2. Points to ponder**: Authors argument for ‘Aksara –Script’ : ” Based on these facts we can argue that the Shruti and Smriti tradition have hugely affected the structure and design of Brahmi and the scripts derived thereafter. ….. (68)- We believe and argue that the Brahmi-derived scripts should not be categorized as scripts with overlapping features of alphabetic and syllabic system as they contain categorization of their own. We suggest a new category named as ‘akshara scripts’.



***3. Question***: Given the fact that ‘ Unicode model of Devanagari script’ is inadequate in meeting the requirements of ‘ Digital Writing/Display system of Devanagari / Indic script aksharas’, What is the next action step for Digital Samskruth Literacy promotion under National Education Policy implementation drive ?

Is there any action to get the ‘akshara-script’ on to ‘digital devices at early schooling for language –script education’? In the absence of which early language –educators and learners get stuck with on line resources like the one at ‘[Liveworksheets.com - Interactive worksheets maker for all languages and subjects](https://www.liveworksheets.com/)
?



***4. Paper Details***:

**Abstract**: Current research exploits the orthographic design of Brahmi-derived scripts (also called Indic scripts), particularly the Devanagari script. Earlier works on orthographic nature of Brahmi-derived scripts fail to create a consensus among epigraphists, historians or linguists, and thus have been identified by various names, like semi-syllabic, subsyllabic, semi-alphabetic, alphasyllabary or abugida. On the contrary, this paper argues that Brahmi-derived scripts should not be categorized as scripts with overlapping features of alphabetic and syllabic properties as these scripts are neither alphabetic nor syllabic. Historical evolution and linguistic properties of Indic scripts, particularly of Devanagari, ascertain the need for a new categorization of its own and, thus preferably merit a unique descriptor. This paper investigates orthographic characteristics of the Brahmi-derived Devanagari script, current trends in research pertaining to the Devanagari script along with other Indic scripts and the implications of these findings for literacy development in Indic writing systems. Keywords: orthography; Brahmi; Devanagari, akshara; alphasyllabary; alphabet\].



**Conclusion:** The nature of Brahmi-derived scripts, particularly of Devanagari, is often termed as alphasyllabic. Some researchers believe that the alphasyllabic attribution to the Indic scripts can be found in overlapping features of alphabetic and syllabary writing systems. On the contrary, there are some researchers who assert that the Indic scripts are neither fundamentally alphabetic nor fundamentally syllabic. It is because of the strong influence on the Indian academia of the identity and methods that originate in the Western academia, the attributions like alphasyllabic or semi-alphabetic for Bhramiderived scripts are readily accepted. It is essential to understand that the complex architecture of Devanagari script superficially presents some alignment with the alphabetic as well as syllabic properties. However, **the fundamental property of akshara units of the Devanagari script is distinctive in its nature**. Thus, the Devanagari script should not be termed as any of the two types and demand a unique descriptor.
