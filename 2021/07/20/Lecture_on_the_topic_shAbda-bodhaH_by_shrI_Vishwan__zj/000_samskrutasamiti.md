**Abstract:**

Communication between a guru and a shishya is a rather subtle issue.
The subtlety is of course profound with respect to spiritual matters, but it is so even in respect of secular knowledge. This issue of the subtlety of communication was a field of interest to our academic tradition, which they analysed under the heading of Śābdabodha. The speaker has some ideas in mind and uses words to communicate them. The listener hears words and grasps the idea in the mind of the speaker. An oft-discussed issue is whether words yield meaning in an already related manner, or is the relation between word senses worked out as the second step after the meanings are first figured out. The Indian theory of verbal communication has implications for many secular contexts also like the interpretation of documents etc. even in the legal field.  
  
Hence, an introduction to this subject matter will be attempted in this popular lecture.
