Dear Scholars,  

   Namaste.

  

   I would like to know whether any scholars would kindly accept the request to review my published book: "Sketches of Ceylon and India" ( 2020) (translated from Russian, originally published in 1878).

  

   The links to the publication details (along with preview of the book) are as follows:

    <https://www.amazon.in/dp/1648056539>

  

    <https://www.amazon.com/dp/1648056539>

  

    <https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1648056539>

  

    I will ask the publisher to send the book directly to the scholars willing to review the book.

  

 Thanks and regards

 Narayan Prasad
