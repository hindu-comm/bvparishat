That is an interesting view. Kalidasa’s time would not have been far removed from Ashoka’s time. The script in which his dramas were written would obviously have been quite capable of writing all Sanskrit sounds. Yet, Prakrit as spoken by some of the characters is written with all the phonological changes from Sanskrit that we expect of Prakrit. Another point is that Greek is quite capable of representing the ‘r’ sound with the character‘rho’. Yet the scribes chose not to use it.

This seems to support the view ofŚrī Rāmakṛṣṇa Sūryanārāyaṇan that the deviations from Sanskrit phonology seen in ancient Indian inscriptions are primarily due to orthographic constraints and do not represent the actual phonology of the spoken language. Ancient Greek scholars investigating Greek writings in various scripts take into account the inadequacy of scripts and try to reconstruct the spoken word from the written. Why then do we take the written to be representative of the spoken here and not do the same kind of inquiry? Would especially like to listen from Śrī Mādhava Deśapāṇḍe on this.
