Dear Ujjwal Ji,

  

  I have not personally worked on the Brahmi and Kharoshthiscripts. However, if one consults the modern research on Ashokan inscriptions, origin of Brahmi and Kharoshthiscripts, etc. by M. A. Mehendale, K.R. Norman, Richard Salomon, Oskar von HInuber, Hartmut Scharfe and many others, there is clear awareness and explicitdemonstration of the slow development of these scripts and the inadequacy of the earlier forms of these scripts to fully represent the underlying languages. All the same, the same Brahmi script in Ashokan inscriptions ranging from the northwest to east shows local variations, for example rācā in the northwest to lājā in the east, and this gives us glimpses of the local language differences. That is the best I can say. With best regards,
