Here is emperor Aśoka’s bilingual rock inscription in Greek and Aramaic from Kandahar: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar_Bilingual_Rock_Inscription>

Interesting to note these:

1.  “Dharma” is translated into Greek as “*εὐσέβεια*” (eusebeia meaning
    piety)
2.    
3.  “Priyadarśin” is not translated but transliterated as Πιοδασσης
    (Piodasses) most probably from a Prakrit version Piyadasi or
    Piyadassi. Interestingly, the Aramaic transliteration of the name
    seems to be directly from Sanskrit as it is Priyadarśi and not
    Piyadasi (*pryd’ršmlk - *Priyadarśi malik or King Priyadarśi.
    Aramaic, like modern Arabic, does not generally show short vowels
    unless it is word initial. Incidentally, Aramaic mlk (king) may be
    etymologically related to mālik, malik and mulk). Since the word is
    transliterated and not translated, it could be considered as one of
    the personal names of Aśoka.
4.    
5.  It appears that Aśoka prohibited slaughter of animals and hence meat
    eating. “And the king abstains from (killing) living beings, and
    other men and those who (are) huntsmen and fishermen of the king
    have desisted from hunting.” However, a vast majority of
    present-day Buddhists are non-vegetarians. Perhaps Buddhism and
    Jainism owe much to pre-existing Śramaṇa traditions of which
    vegetarianism might have been a part.
