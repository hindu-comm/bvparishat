Namaste



On \< “Dharma” is translated into Greek as “*εὐσέβεια*” (eusebeia meaning piety)\> :

Classical definitions of ‘Dharma’ even in works prior to Ashoka include ‘ahimsaa’ ( including meaning shades of krupaa, dayaa, abhaya) .

The ‘ten classical list of values covered under ‘Dharma (- dashakam dharma lakshanam) includes ten yogaangas of yama- niyama; and higlights ‘ ahimsaa’.

‘Ahimsaa’ was a common ‘Dharma factor’ for Vedic traditions, Buddhist and Jains. ‘Ahimsaa’ becomes the basis for ‘shaanti’- peace.

So the highlighting of ‘Core common value in translation seems appropriate.
