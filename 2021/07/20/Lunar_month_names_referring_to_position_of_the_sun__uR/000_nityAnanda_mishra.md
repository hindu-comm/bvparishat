Dear list members

  

On page 172 of his book ‘12209 BCE: Rama Ravana Yuddha’ (2021 revised edition, ISBN 9788194027812, Subbu Publications), Sh. Nilesh Oak writes—

  

Quote

“I conjecture that the word ‘masa’ was used in the sense of duration (\~30 days) and/or time, and words such as ‘Shravana’, Kartika’ and ‘Proshthapada’ \[sic\] as referring to nakshatra of the sun for designating beginning, end and peak of rainy season, respectively, as is also done in our times.”

This has already been questioned by Dr. Raja Ram Mohan Roy[here](https://rajarammohanroy.medium.com/refutation-of-nilesh-oaks-astronomical-dating-of-ramayana-to-12209-bce-80c173b81c25). I have an additional thing to note. In the verses cited by Sh. Oak on pages 171 and 172, the words are*śrāvaṇa*,*kārttika*, and*prauṣṭhapada*(and not*proṣṭhapada*), which are names of lunar months and not *nakṣatra*names (*śravaṇa*, *kṛttikā*, and *proṣṭhapada*). Theauthor seems to have mixed up month names and*nakṣatras* names**while writing this. Further ahead, on pages 172 and 173, Sh. Oak writes—



Quote

“There is additional evidence within ancientIndian literature in support of my conjecture (nakshatras as referring to the position of the sun and not the moon,in describing rainyseasons), however elaboration of that evidence necessitates detailedexposition. I do intend to discuss this additionalevidence in future editions of this book.”

Does anybody know of this evidence from ancient texts where*nakṣatra*names refer to position of the sun and not the moon during descriptions of rainy seasons.

  

And is there any example where a **lunar month name** like*śrāvaṇa*,*kārttika*, or*prauṣṭhapada*(as opposed to a*nakṣatra* name like*śravaṇa*,*kṛttikā*, or*proṣṭhapada*) is used to refer to the position of the sun in description of the rainy season?

  

I also request Sh. Nilesh Oak, member of this list, to share the evidence from Indian literature that supports this conjecture.
