It is not to offend anyone. But what indian people did mistakes is not publishing anything. We can say and write one thousand things in samskrit kannada marathi or whatever language, it will not count. Only English books will count for authentic research now.

Hence most important thing we need to do is to write in English whatever pages. If again Columbians write one hundred pages, we should be patient enough to write two hundred pages against it. This is how humanities are made in general and Indology especially. Whatever thing written in English becomes research.

  

We need to do it again and again.

The sutra is

Don't hesitate waste thousands of pages if want to change it.  

I request everyone to follow it.
