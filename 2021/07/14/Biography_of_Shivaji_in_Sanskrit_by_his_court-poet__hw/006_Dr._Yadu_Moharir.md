Namste Panduringi-ji

  

On another thread Prof Paturi-ji says,

  

\>\>

Towards the end of the video , the woman anchoring the lecture emphatically declares that languages are created by humans , not by 'any so called' 'devas' or anything.

  

This reveals the intention behind the title 'deification' . 'Deity ' (divine status, quality, or nature) is factual but is '-fied', attributed to, put over Sanskrit.

  

The lecture too begins with the mention of 'देवीं वाचमजनयन्त देवाः' .... and its interpretation around 14:20 - 15:20 .

  

There it is said that वाच्‌ or वाक्‌ is देवी why ? BECAUSE it is created by 'gods'

\<\<  

  

Does this mean that English language is and/or needs to be classified as the "वाक्‌ देवी" ?

It is not to offend anyone. But what indian people did mistakes is not publishing anything. We can say and write one thousand things in samskrit kannada marathi or whatever language, it will not count. Only English books will count for authentic research now.

Hence most important thing we need to do is to write in English whatever pages. If again Columbians write one hundred pages, we should be patient enough to write two hundred pages against it. This is how humanities are made in general and Indology especially. Whatever thing written in English becomes research.

  

We need to do it again and again.

The sutra is

Don't hesitate waste thousands of pages if want to change it.  

I request everyone to follow it.
