Dr Yadu,

  

Since you mentioned my words , it is appropriate only for me to respond.

  

If your remark is sarcastic, a response to Prof. Pandurangi highlighlighting the unfortunate reality of significance gained by
publishing in English, it is fine, I tooüòÄüòÄalong with you.

  

But if it is a serious query, then the following is my answer .

  

If you understand the difference between speech, speaking, communicating through a system of sounds, as a universal human if not animal/zoological phenomenon and English, Marathi, Telugu etc. as specific languages,

  

what is being stuta /varNita as ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡•Ä here is

  

not any specific language like English, Marathi, Telugu etc.

  

but

  

speech, speaking, communicating through a system of sounds, as a universal human if not animal/zoological phenomenon.  

  

Evidence ?

  

‡§§‡§æ‡§Ç ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞‡•Ç‡§™‡§æ‡§É ‡§™‡§∂‡§µ‡•ã ‡§µ‡§¶‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§ø ‡•§

  

just a few words later in the same mantra.

  

Does it mean that Vedic tradition does not recognize any special significance for Sanskrit ?

  

Vedic tradition does recognize special significance for Sanskrit.  

  

It is based on the encapsulation of the culture of the speakers in their speech.

  

Sanskrit has the Dharma of the s'ishTas through whose speaking / speech it evolved.

  

‡§∂‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü \< ‡§∂‡§æ‡§∏ means disciplined, here self-disciplined, naturally self-disciplined, self-discipline being their helpless born nature.

  

One could universalize this discussion and say, there could be self-disciplined English speakers too.

  

Yes, the English of the self-disciplined English speakers has the self-disciplined culture of them.

  

If English speakers consciously developed their language in a way that preserves the culture of their self-disciplined ancestors, they do so with a respect for and in order to imbibe the culture of their self-disciplined ancestors.

  

In the case of Sanskrit, Sanskrit speakers consciously developed their language in a way that preserves the culture of their self-disciplined ancestors with a respect for and in order to imbibe the culture of their self-disciplined ancestors.

  

For Bhaarateeyaswho respect the Dharma of the s'ishTas through whose speaking / speech Sanskrit evolved, Sanskrit is special, divya = divine, respectable, worshippable for that reason.
