Dear friends,

  

To say that man makes without a caveat itself shows the ignorance of the person making the statement. Man makes but not as he wishes. He makes in given circumstances dictated by nature.

  

The question is what has nature provided that man make a language. Has any linguist described it? Has any linguist described the rules that govern the sequence of letters that go into making of a word?

  

What makes Sanskrit so unique? As a language it is no different than any other. However when it comes to its structure it is different.
Thanks to Panini for describing the Sanskrit language by means of rules.

  

However a more pertinent question needs to be answered. Why only rules of letter sequences could be made for Sanskrit? Did Panini through his rules reveal the aesthetic running in the minds of the Shisthas
contemporary to Panini regarding order of letters in words? Did his contemporaries accept them or were there differences of opinion?

  

It is a tragedy that my book 'The Atlantis of Sanskrit Phonology' has not been taken seriously. There is a thread running through the Mahesh war Sutras which is much deeper than what it is considered to offer - ie pratyaharas. It is also a tragedy that contemporary shisthas take a utilitarian view of the Ashtadhyayi.

  

By saying that the Astadhyayi is a masterpiece nothing is served.
Voicing mere opinions on it too also does not serve any purpose either.

  

One may write pages on length 100, 1000 or more. The Question is can we draft a single sutra?

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
