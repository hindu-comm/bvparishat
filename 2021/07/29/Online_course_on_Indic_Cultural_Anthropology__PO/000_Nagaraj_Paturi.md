Cultural Anthropology, like few contemporary Social Science disciplines like Linguistics, has been misunderstood by some Indophiles who perceive that it looks down upon Hinduism as a primitive and superstitious culture. Contrary to this belief, cultural anthropological conceptual tools can prove beneficial in articulating an insider understanding of Hinduism.
