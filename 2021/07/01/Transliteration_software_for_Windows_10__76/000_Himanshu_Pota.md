Recently I shifted form Windows 7 to Windows 10. Itranslator from Omkarananda Ashram is behaving erratically and I have had to reinstall it several times.

  

Is there a stable version of Itranslator for Windows 10?

  

Is there an equivalent software which also enables Vedic accents with Devanagari?

  

I tried Baraha but I didn't see any facility to input Vedic accents.

  

Please guide

  

Thanks.

  

Himanshu
