If Vedic accents is your purpose there are a few different options.

  

If transliteration from an already existing ITRANS document, you may use<https://sites.google.com/site/bhashaime/>

  

You have ITRANS to unicode transliteration option in this.

  

This has two modules. Key in module(Bhasha IME Run Me). Transliteration module (Bhasha Trans Run Me).

  

In Bhasha IME Run Me, you have Vedic Input option.

  

There is a Bhasha IME user reference pdf in the folder that comes zipped to be downloaded.

  

That has help for Vedic input.
