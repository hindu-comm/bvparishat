Sri Alwar's Sanskrit lectures on tattva Mukta Kalapa of Sri Vedanta Desika are really amazing. The work of Sri Vedanta Desika is a Classic. The lectures are in simple Sanskrit. Every third lecture will be in colloquial Tamil plus English language to summarize the previous 2 Sanskrit lectures. Here below are the youtube links for the first 2 lectures. FYI

Some people are joining this group to improve their Sanskrit and Darshana knowledge

  

Listen to these two lectures to see if this is of any interest to you.
