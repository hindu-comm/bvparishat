Post from Jataayu in FB:  Yog Darshan: The Story of Yoga - A wonderful musical. From Upanishads, Gita and Patanjali through Siva Sutras, Thirumanthiram, Hatha Yoga Pradipika to Swami Vivekananda and the modern Yoga renaissance. From Kashmir to Kanyakumari, Kamarupa to Sourashtra. The story of Timeless science of Yoga across Time and Space has been brought out beautifully, with soul stirring music and apt choice of verses from a wide range of texts, with blissful visuals of the Indian spiritual landscape. The English subtitles all through the video are well presented. Appreciation to all the artists involved for this beautiful offering, especially Dr Kanniks Kannikeswaran, the man behind the conceptualization, script, music composition and production of this video
