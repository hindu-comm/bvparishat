Namaste



I came across a 5x5 table with the following number combination-placements.

The table uses numbers sequentially from 1 to 25. The cross total adds to 325. The number 325 is a product of primes: 1x5x5x13.

Looks like a Magic table ! Help requested to identify the deeper construction and features of such table please.



***Basic Table***: Figures in RED are the numbers. 325 is the row-column total.
