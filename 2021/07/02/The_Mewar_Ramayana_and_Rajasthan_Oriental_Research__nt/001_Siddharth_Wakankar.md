Sir,

  

As far as I know,there is no Sanskrit scholar at RORI in Jodhpur or in any of their seven branches in Rajasthan.

  

The last Sanskrit scholars I knew were Shri Sharma at Jodhpur and Shri Dharmadhikari at Alwar who arranged to supply to me Xerox.copies of their rare Mss.of Gargasamhita, which I passed on to Prof.R.N.Iyengar in 2015 and who is editing this Text with his team of scholars.The Alwar authorities refused to supply copies to non Sanskrit scholars,so,Prof.Iyengar requested me to

use my credit to get the xeroxcopy.I did it in good faith.

  

Kind regards.

  

Prof.Siddharth Y.Wakankar.
