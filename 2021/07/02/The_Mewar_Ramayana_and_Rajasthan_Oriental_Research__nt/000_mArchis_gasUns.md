Namaste,

  

 At <https://www.bl.uk/turning-the-pages/?id=68b0d8eb-787f-4609-9028-8cd17ff05c96&type=book> it is stated that (7 years have passed since):

  

The Araṇyakāṇḍa (Book of the Forest)

It is hoped that images of folios from the Araṇyakāṇḍa currently held at the Rajasthan Oriental Research Institute, Jodhpur, may be included in a subsequent phase.

  

 Does anyone know why Rajasthan Oriental Research Institute has not scanned it's part of the MSS? Anyone from there here around?The Mewar Ramayana lacks the Araṇyakāṇḍa and it's so sad.
