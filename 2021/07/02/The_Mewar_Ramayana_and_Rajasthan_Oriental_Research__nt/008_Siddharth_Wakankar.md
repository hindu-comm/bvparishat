RORI Jodhpur Head office has a lot of illustrated manuscripts,which are kept underground and hardly anyone is allowed to enter it.

  

I was fortunate to visit it in 2005 February and see some of the most exclusively beautiful illustrated and coloured manuscripts,miniature paintings etc. in the [mss.department.It](http://mss.department.It) is a very rich and varied collection,but,very difficult to see unless you have some special kind of approach.

  

I could see their rich collections in Udaipur, Alwar and Jaipur branches too in 1982 after the AIOC Session.

  

I was singularly fortunate to have the rare darshan of this treasure.

  

Best luck to my friends to have a look at this rich heritage.
