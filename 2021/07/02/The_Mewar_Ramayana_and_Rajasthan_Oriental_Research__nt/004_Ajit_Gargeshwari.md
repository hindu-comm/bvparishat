Ramayana J.P. Lotsy Sumeddha V. Ojha Published by Roli Press

  

Beautifully illustrated with paintings from manuscripts prepared for Rana Jagat Singh of Mewar (reg. 1628–52),this is the first time that paintings from different locations have been put together in one volume. In the hands of mid-seventeenth century artists the story of Ram has been turned artistically into a sophisticated expression of Rajput ideals and society.
