Namaskar,

  

<http://swatantramag.com/naivedya-70-rabindranath-tagore/>  

  

Here's a translation of one of Tagore's well-known Bangla poems (maybe not so well-known outside native speakers), one which has inspired Bengalees over generations, and one that, I believe, needs to be resurfaced now more than ever. 

  

Thanks and regards,
