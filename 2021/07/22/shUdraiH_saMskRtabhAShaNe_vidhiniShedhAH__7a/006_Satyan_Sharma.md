I think if 'संस्कृतां गिरम्' here means the non-Vedic Sanskrit language, and if reciting it is prohibited for Śūdras, then it is to be noted that in Śūdrācāraśiromaṇi and Śūdrakamalākara, in the portion for bhūtayajña, the Śūdra is told to recite a Sanskrit prayer (देवा मनुष्याः पशवो वयांसि ... तेषामिदं ते मुदिता भवन्तु॥). Also, in Śūdrācāraśiromaṇi, regarding Brahmayajña it is said 'किञ्च येषु स्तोत्रादिषु साक्षाच्छूद्रस्य पाठाभ्यनुज्ञानं पुराणे दृश्यते तत्पाठेन वा ब्रह्मयज्ञं निवर्त्तयेदिति (पृ० ११३, भाग १)'.

  

InŚūdrācāraśiromaṇi, during the discussion of prohibition of Vedic education for Śūdra, the author begins the discussion against the teaching of आर्ष-व्याकरण. He ends it by quoting the same passage of Skāndapurāṇa and says, 'अत एव वैदिकस्य व्याकरणस्य संस्कृतशब्दात्मकत्वात्सिद्धमनध्येयत्वम्'. The prohibition is extended to the study of all Vedāṅgas, and also Smṛti. I did not find any prohibition regarding other Śāstras. Vidyārambha is open to Śūdras and 'स्वविद्यासूत्रकारांश्च स्वां विद्यां च विशेषतः' is a verse included even in Śūdrakamalākara, and the Vidyā includes all Śāstras, from which even if we subtract the आर्ष-व्याकरण, वेदाङ्ग, कर्ममीमांसा, ब्रह्ममीमांसा and स्मृति, we're still left with a lot of Sanskrit literature left which can be studied by Śūdras, and they may also teach it under āpat-kāla as indicated in Manusmṛti 10.116 (विद्या शिल्पं भृतिः...) which is explained as सर्वपुरुषसाधारणवृत्ति. Hence speaking the language of those texts may not have been a problem or prohibited.

  

So it seems that 'संस्कृतां गिरम्' does not denote the non-Ārṣa and non-Vedic Sanskrit, which is the language of Śāstras other than those mentioned as prohibited.
