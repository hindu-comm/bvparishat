Dear Vishvas Ji,

  

One basic fact is that in all the shastras (Puranas and the epics), non-Dvija and female characters speak only in Sanskrit. Are all their words supposed to be translations from Prakrita-s? I would highly doubt that. Then, if there was such a restriction, why have the Rishis recorded them as speaking in Sanskrit?

  

Best,

Kushagra
