Namaste



On \< I think if 'संस्कृतां गिरम्' here means the non-Vedic Sanskrit language, and if reciting it is prohibited for Śūdras, then it is to be noted that in Śūdrācāraśiromaṇi and Śūdrakamalākara, in the portion for bhūtayajña, the Śūdra is told to recite a Sanskrit prayer (देवा मनुष्याः पशवो वयांसि ... तेषामिदं ते मुदिता भवन्तु॥). Also, in Śūdrācāraśiromaṇi, regarding Brahmayajña it is said 'किञ्च येषु स्तोत्रादिषु साक्षाच्छूद्रस्य पाठाभ्यनुज्ञानं पुराणे दृश्यते तत्पाठेन वा ब्रह्मयज्ञं निवर्त्तयेदिति (पृ० ११३, भाग १)'. \> :



***Some inconvenient questions, with a focus on **\<**** vidhi/ niShedha-s in shAstra-s. That is very tight focus**** \>** *****

****

**The highlighted conditions set the worry on ‘ how tradition’ is being presented and ‘ misaligned’. **

****शास्त्रे का स्थितिर्इति जिज्ञासा - धर्म-शास्त्रं नदीवत् गङ्गावत् प्रवहति लोककल्याणाय. कूप-वापी-फलं. देवकल्याणीवत् –न सार्वजनीनंभवति****

****

**If the debate is limited to ‘ text- interpretation issue, then the term **अपकृष्ट-शूद्र in शूद्राचारशिरोमणि** – with the qualifying term ‘**अपकृष्ट** has all the explanation covered. **

**Why is the ‘ status of shudra reduced to’ – is a different question like ‘ why did the other varnas ( Brahmana/ Kshatriya/ Vaishya) fall in their status. ( Manu’s thoughts ! not mine). The entire section of ‘ Prayaschitta’ in dharma-shaastra’ has more details for this ‘ apa-krushtataa’.**

** **

**If the individual ‘**शूद्र’ **has not come under the status of ‘**अपकृष्ट’(= non compliant practices) **the rule will not apply. As the book **शूद्राचारशिरोमणि** is a context- specific work, stretching it back and forth is not a right way to get at the intention of text. The ‘samskara’ for ‘shudra’ has its own unique format; and there are practices justifying the same with texts. It is for the individuals in the community to be complinat or other wise. The logic is a direct continuation of Gita (16-23 to 16-6) : **

******

**In current period, ‘ Saamjika-Dharma- Shaastra’ for ‘ prajaa (citizen) ’ of ‘ Bharath-Rashtra, now known as ‘ India’ ‘The Constitution, for ‘We the people of ….’. **

****

**If any ‘Varna-ashrama- individual’ -community desires and thinks that they need to carry a special identity based on ‘ PEROSNAL DHARMA-SHAASTRA ( Vyakti – Vishista Dharma Shaastra) by the authority of
historical / sacred/ practice/ culture/ tradition/ special texts, THEN, the stake needs to be claimed as a petition for ‘Amendment –Review of Fundamental rights (Articles: 25-28) of citizens under appropriate provisions and forums’. **

****

**Why is this right approach? The constitution of India stands by the standard: यतो धर्मः ततो जयः – For more details, one may read (Late) Hon.justice Rama Jois’s work.**



***Additional points which one may prefer to ignore if not interested.***



A) Why constrict \< 'संस्कृतां गिरम्' \> to \< Vedic Sanskrit / classical Sanskrit \> ? – Any specific reason ? why overlook/ discredit the precept and practice of ‘Samskrutha-Stotra’ for EVERY ONE in society since 6^(th) century where we see a proliferation of ‘bhakti-stora sahitya’ composed and socially adapted under the guidance of ‘acharyas’ ? Example: Soundarya lahari , morning prayers and many other ‘prarthana’?



B) Why overlook the backdrop of ‘Varna-Ashrama- Aachara –paddhati’ framework of social dynamics in Indian society which made ‘ local cultural adaptations of ‘ shaastra’ as ‘ practical ‘aachaara- sampradaya’ ? Take any specific historic cross section in time: the ‘desha-aachara’ – regional custom-culture mode of ‘shaastra-abhyaya –anushthana’ was at variance., even amongst ‘brahmanas’.



C) The institutional model of ‘teaching ‘Samskruth Language’ was a ‘Guru-Kul’. Teaching ‘Chandas and Bhashaa, Prakrut and other desi languages was discipline options by pre-qualification. The size and model operations of ‘ Gur-kul’ did change from its famed ‘ Nalanda’ model to ‘ family Gurukuls’ over a period of centuries. So did the student admission, teachers preference to teach, learners interest and social support to ‘practicing teachers’. The modern schooling model- starting with ‘Montessori’ model to ‘Government funded university’ institutional education has distanced out itself from all types of
‘gur-kul’ frame work.



So, why mix up and compare ‘Samskruth- language -education model’ used
for ‘ sacred texts as sacred language’ at incompatible institutional frameworks?

- ‘Personalized Teacher run –Vedic Guru-kul’ model (in mediavel period) ***to*** the ‘historical outlived model of ‘Nalanda- open school ( which lost its sheen with Buddhism) ’ ***or ‘*** Kulapati- run King /state supported ancient model ( of BCE period) ’ or modern ‘Home school / religion institutions/ government funded social agenda language-schools and universities’? 

- The meaning-practice- social identity associated with the term ‘shudra’ moved from the contexts of ‘Vedas, Gita, Kavya, itihasa-purana, Dharma-shaastra, Yoga-Vedanta’ . The boiling point is seen at Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar’s writings: The unanswered questions in his work : Who Were the Shudras? How they came to be the Fourth Varna in the Indo-Aryan Society, published in 1946. The book was dedicated to Mahatma Phule (or Fule): “Inscribed to the Memory of MAHATMA JOTIBA FULE,”. The questions in the book are based on several mix ups and bad social practices of day is a different issue for debate. How this
projection of ‘shudra’ has percolated to Indian governance in the name of ‘religious minorities and others’ is out of scope issue. 



D) The reforms of the kind being asked here went in to social correction mode, at least in Mysore ( Now Karnanataka) under the leadership of then Highness Wodeyars

in 19^(th) and 20^(th) century. It was nothing to do with British or muslim demands.

 It is on record that ‘ doors opened by Brahmana communities inviting others to study Samskruth and Vedas was ‘ honourably rejected by the local communities’ and

‘ local communities wanted only brahmanas to learn-practice-profession related to Veda –Samskruth’. One may look for details of this historical annals and

Footprints of ‘Establishment and development of Sri Chamarajendra Samskruth Maha-Pathashaalaa’ : the for and against, the way the professor chairs were

established and student admissions were taken.
