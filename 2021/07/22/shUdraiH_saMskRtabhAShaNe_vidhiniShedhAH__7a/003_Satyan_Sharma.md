Namaste

  

The verse of स्कान्दपुराण (न शिखां नोपवीतं...) is said to be 'अपकृष्टशूद्रपरम्' in शूद्राचारशिरोमणि. The similar verse of पाद्मपुराण (न शिखी नोपवीती...) is said to be 'असच्छूद्रपरम्' in संस्कारदीपक. In the निर्णयसिन्धु, the same verse is said to be for असच्छूद्र as per some authorities.
