Dear Sirs,

  

I need the Telugu translation of Jaimini Bharatam by Sri Pillalamarri Pina Veerabhadra kavi. I am aware that only Aswamedha parva is available now, but would like to get an electronic copy of this telugu version. I would be eternally grateful if someone on the list can share a copy with me, as I need it for some research purposes.

  

I have Sringaara Sakuntalam by the same poet - Pillalamarri Pinaveerabhadra kavi, but if any of you have any other works by him, kindly share with me. Thanks in advance foryour help.

  

  

Best Regards,  
  
Krishna
