Namaste Radhakrishna Ji,

  

Just about this one point.. you said:

\>But isn’t the aim of yoga to join (yuj)?

  

Just for your information, this is not true according to the traditional view!

  

The root yuj/युज् has three different meanings in the धातुपाठः. Extract from [ashtadhyayi.com](http://ashtadhyayi.com) below.

1.  [(४.७४](https://www.ashtadhyayi.com/dhatu/04.0074))युज्युजँ
    **समाधौ**(to concentrate, to focus, to abstain from senses, to
    meditate)(चित्त स्थिर करना, मन को रोकना)  
2.  [(७.७](https://www.ashtadhyayi.com/dhatu/07.0007))युज्युजिँर्
    **योगे**(to bind, to restrain, to join, to unite, to apply, to
    combine)(जुड़ना, मिलाप करना, एकत्र करना)  
3.  ([१०.३३८](https://www.ashtadhyayi.com/dhatu/10.0338))युज्युजँ
    **संयमने**(to restrain, to control, to bind)(संयत करना, बांधना,
    वश में रखना)

And, the commentaries say that the word yoga/योगः is derived from the first one;**yoga == "samadhi",** not from the others.

  

Regards,

Sudarshana
