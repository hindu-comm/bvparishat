Ātmārāma Sūri, in his Haṭha Pradīpikā (hand-lamp of Haṭha Yoga), after mentioning the names of many a mahāsiddha, says:

  

Ityādayo mahāsiddhā haṭhayoga prabhāvataḥ

Khaṇḍayitvā kāladaṇḍaṃ, brahmāṇḍe vicaranti te

  

इत्यादयो महासिद्धा हठयोग प्रभावतः

खण्डयित्वा कालदण्डं ब्रह्माण्डे विचरन्ति ते

  

"These great siddhas through the power of haṭhayoga have broken the rule of time (became immortal) and are roaming in the universe (brahmāṇḍe vicaranti te)."

  

But isn’t the aim of yoga to join (yuj), or to be one with the Ultimate Reality? Would the one who has become one with the Ultimate Reality roam in the universe? Doesn’t roaming in the Brahmāṇḍa imply an individual identity separate from the Brahmāṇḍa? If one is the same as Brahmāṇḍa, what is the need to “roam” in it?
