सुध्युपास्य "worshipped by the wise"

  

गृहीतं सुध्युपास्येन हरिणा मे मनो दृढम् ।

कामं द्विधो द्वियो वास्तु को भेदो मम बन्धने ।।

  

My mind has been firmly captured by Lord Hari worshipped by the wise. Whether the word sudhyupāsya “worshipped by the wise” has one or two dh/y sounds makes no difference in my bond with him.
