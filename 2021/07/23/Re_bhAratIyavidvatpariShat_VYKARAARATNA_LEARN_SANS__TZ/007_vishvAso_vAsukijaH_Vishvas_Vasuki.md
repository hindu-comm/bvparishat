This is contrary to the experience of saroja bhATe - <https://youtu.be/AGPfSgVqb78?t=880>

  

It is critical to use the right register - if one starts saying "निमित्तसप्तम्येषा । क्ङिन्निमित्ते ये गुणवृद्धी प्राप्नुतस्ते न भवतः ।" - that's obviously hard. Rather, if one says - "यदि कस्मिंश्चित् प्रत्यये ककारः / गकारः / ङकारः इत्संज्ञकः अस्ति, तर्हि तस्य प्रत्ययस्य उपस्थितौ अङ्गस्य अन्तिम इक्-वर्णस्य यद्यपि केनापि सूत्रेण गुणः वृद्धिः वा भवितुमर्हतः, तथापि तौ न भवतः । ..." (as niilesh does on his website) - that's far clearer.

  

<https://sites.google.com/site/samskritavyakaranam/> is another example - that American non-Indian gentleman (svarUp) has taught vyAkaraNa and nyAya to lots of students in weekly phone classes (should be able to find recordings) which uses Simple Standard Sanskrit register. I attend a few and found that students were able to grasp what was being said very clearly.
