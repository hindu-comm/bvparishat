I once travelled to Srisailam from Hyderabad (and back) with Prof. Rama Nath Sharma (translator of the Ashtadhyayi into English, a much more comprehensive translation than that of S C Vasu, nearly a century earlier), worthy son of the illustrious scholar Padmashree Raghunatha Sharma, who wrote the only complete commentary on the Vakyapadiya and who taught many great scholars of Sanskrit vyakarana including George Cardona. I asked Prof. Rama Nath Sharma how his father taught him Ashtadhyayi, especially the medium of instruction. It was Bhojpuri, their mother tongue. I am more familiar with the tradition in South India and know that languages other than Sanskrit are used in the initial stages. My own teacher, MM Prof. Korada Subrahmanyam garu switches languages based on the comprehension level of the student, in the tradition of तदाचार्यः सुहृद्भूत्वान्वाचष्टे. So, if the paramana of aptavaakya is sought, there is equal weight, if not more, for other views as well.

  

The point is that those who focus on teaching Sastra use all the means available to teach. At any rate, all that I say is that there is a case to use a medium other than Sanskrit. It is perfectly alright, welcome actually, if Sanskrit is taught through Sanskrit, whether the simple register or actual sentences from works like Siddhantakaumudi. There is no opposition to that.

  

The views of activists are different. Usually commitment to any cause, including noble ones, creates intolerance for other views, like how roses come with thorns. So be it. The other view, of course, is as Bernard Shawputs it: allprogress is due to unreasonable people, as the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself and not the other way round. My view is that an Acharya is competent to decide how to teach and we should respect that.

  

विपुला च पृथ्वी। There is enough space for all views.
