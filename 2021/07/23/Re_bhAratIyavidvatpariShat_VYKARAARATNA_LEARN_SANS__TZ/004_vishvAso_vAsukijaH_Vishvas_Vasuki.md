Indeed! It is not like people using SSS for teaching shAstra-s are compromising on this fundamental requirement. I don't think that this is compromised if one uses SSS register instead of marAThi or kannaDa or English. It might be a good idea to experiment before making up your mind.

I disagree that standard of sanskrit is maintained by choosing to use marAThi (ie abandoning sanskrit all together) instead of SSS in the first level. It is natural to speak languages at multiple levels - one does not loosen the standard of English (or lose the ability to use it well) by choosing to use a lower simpler register while speaking to children.
