Dear Kulkarni

Thank you for your prompt response. I do not know Marathi. If the medium of instruction is either Sanskrit, Hindi or English it would be better for me. I also want to introduce Sanskrit Grammar to my nieces. Theirmediumof learning could be Hindi or English. They are just beginners.

With regards
