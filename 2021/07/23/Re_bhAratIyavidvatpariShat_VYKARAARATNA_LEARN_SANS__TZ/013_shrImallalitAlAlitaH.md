I think that your age may not be a barrier. The program definitely doesn't take 12 years to teach laghusiddAntakaumudI.

It is lack of elaboration about program which gives birth to such a confusion.

And, I also hope that those who want to take only one level or more, are allowed to do so.

I've seen some teacher who insisted on completing very long courses and failed miserably.
