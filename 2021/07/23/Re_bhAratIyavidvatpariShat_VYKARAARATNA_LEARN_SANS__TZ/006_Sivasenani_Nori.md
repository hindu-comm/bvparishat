While teaching Grammar (or any Sastra), explaining how sutras need to be interpreted is quite involved. While it is indeed possible to do so in simple Sanskrit, except with exceptional students, a lot of what is said is not absorbed in the first pass even when a more familiar language is used. For instance when we teach Sivasutras, even in English, Telugu, Hindi etc., and then ask the students as an exercise to expand certain pratyaharas, we realize how much is lost between what was said and what was understood. This loss is more when the explanation is in Sanskrit, because they have two difficulties - of the subject matter itself and the language of instruction. Similar is the case even at advanced levels, say samaasa prakaraNam. Sometimes one wonders if the students understand even the simple sanskrit used in the prakriya of samaasanirUpaNa.

  

There is indeed a case for making learning Sanskrit easy by using language easily understood by students, especially when teaching Sastra (कष्टं शास्त्रम्, it is said lest one forget).

  

As an aside, it is interesting to note the difference in the present announcement - most announcements highlight the link for attending classes. It seems to be different in this case.
