No doubt, an AchArya is free to do what he/ she likes considering his/ her circumstance. No doubt the person will be fairly competent given prior experiences.

  

That said, there are superior and inferior means of pedagogy; as well as true and false assertions. So, a competent teacher's practice (though good/ ok) is not necessarilythe best, and the justification used for it (eg. teaching in marAThi is necessarily easier than teaching in SSS) is not necessarily true.
