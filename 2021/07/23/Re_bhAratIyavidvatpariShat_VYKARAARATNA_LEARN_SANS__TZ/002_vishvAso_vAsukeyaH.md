An admirable program with one major drawback. It is regrettable that the organizers are of the opinion that "Sanskrit is not the medium of instruction in level 1 because of difficulty in comprehending the subject in Sanskrit which is itself difficult to understand.". The Simple Standard Sanskrit register (<http://www.sanskrit.nic.in/sss.php> ) is indeed easily comprehended and widely used for instruction in many beginning shAstra courses.
