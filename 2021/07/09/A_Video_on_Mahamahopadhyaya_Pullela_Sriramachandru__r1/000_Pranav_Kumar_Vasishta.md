Namaskaram

  

A friend of mine, Sri Vajjhala Balakrishna Halley Kalyan, recently attempted to introduce the enormous lifetime work of Kirtiseshulu Mahamahopadhyaya Acharya Pullela Sriramachandrudu garu to generic audiences across our country by doing this following video::

To quote Prof. PK Mukhopadhyay, one of the finest Naiyayika-s of our times, and a former Professor of Philosophy from JadhavpurUniversity from an essay titled: 'The place of humanities' in the book: ThePlace of Humanities in Our Universities ed. Mrinal Miri:

  

> The most important consideration is that for the development of any > branch of knowledge and particularly any highly specialized branch of > knowledge  
> – science or certain area of science, say – there is need for honest > appreciation and authentic criticisms. This can be ensured only if > there

Scholars like Acharya Pullela Sriramachandrudu have done a great degree to create such 'informed amateurs' and my friend who spoke could fall in such a category.

  

It is desired that many such or even better videos on the galaxy of such scholars who have dedicated their lives to scholarship that include stalwarts like several Mahamahopadhyaya awardees - the names of Sri K T Pandurangi / Sri Rewa Prasad Dwivedi starting from the most recent to the earlier times - may be done. Any suggestions in this regard will be very highly welcome.  

  

Thank you.

  

Sincerely,

Pranav
