Dear Shri Senani garu,  

  

Thanks for dipping into Purva Mimamsa to explain my superlative.

Just one clarification sir:

I wrote: "He is trulyone of a kindand***one of the last real brahmanas left on***earth."

SS->"about Br. Mani Dravida Sastrigal being *the last Brahmana* should be seen only as an arthavada"

  

I have nowhere said Shri Mani Dravid is the last brahmana, which is the main bone of contention with Sri Raghavendra.

I have used the term "***one of the last real brahmanas left***" to denote he is one of a very selective and rapidly diminishing group, but a group nonetheless. I have not suggested that Shri MD is the only person in this class/group. I know you do not need this explanation, but I am including it just in case there are others who are still confused.

  

Thanks again,

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
