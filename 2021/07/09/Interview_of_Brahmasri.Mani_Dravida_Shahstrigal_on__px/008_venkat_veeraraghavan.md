I am reminded of a quote from John Wick...."..You dip so much as a pinky back into this pond... you may well find something reaches out... and drags you back into its depths"

  

I posted my original message merely to gently correct Shri Ramesh on his (inadvertent?) use of "Brahmarshi" in describing Shri MD.

  

Now to the main business at hand: pasting below verbatim what I wrote.

  

"I have had the good fortune of meeting this great soul. He is truly ***one of a kind*** and ***one of the last real brahmanas left on*** earth. Kindness, wisdom, clarity, vinaya and erudition rarely combine in one person."

  

I do not know what rarefied level of language you operate from, but my layman's understanding is as follows:

1.*one of a kind *= is unique (in this case in a good way)

2.***one of the last real brahmanas left on***= is one of a group (Please note the use of plural brahmana***s)***

***  
***

***I have nowhere suggested that Shri MD is the ONLY brahmana left on earth.***

***  
***

***There are many in this group who also qualify for that superlative...an immediate example that comes to mind is Shri Korada garu.***

***  
***

There is no hornet or nest here. All hornets and their associated nests are a product of one's own imagination. If one listens instead of filtering throough one's own inner narrative***it is possible for a dialogue to happen.***  

With conversation both parties gain.

  

Henceforth if you are oversensitive about use of language, kindly ascertain what is meant instead of shooting from the hip and making a mountain out of a mole hill.
