Dear Sri Raghavendra

  

You have already misunderstood a statement i made....so before i respond pls clarify the following-

  

"What if one were to ask,

  

He is truly one of a kind and Is he one of the last real brahmanas left on real or false earth?"

  

What are you trying to say here? Are you poking fun at MD's advaita siddhanta position or is there something more superficial?

I find this paragraph hard to parse and may require your tika for the same.

  

Regards

  

Venkat
