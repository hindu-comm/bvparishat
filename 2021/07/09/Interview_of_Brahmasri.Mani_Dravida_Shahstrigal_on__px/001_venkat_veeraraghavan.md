Dear Shri Ramesh

  

I have had the good fortune of meeting this great soul. He is truly one of a kind and one of the last real brahmanas left on earth. Kindness, wisdom, clarity, vinaya and erudition rarely combine in one person.

But I think you meant Brahma Shri and not Brahmarshi.

Shri Mani Dravid Garu more than anyone else would be embarrassed by such conferred rishihood.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
