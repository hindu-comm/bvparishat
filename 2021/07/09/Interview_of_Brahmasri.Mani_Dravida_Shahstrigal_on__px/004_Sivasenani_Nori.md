नमो विद्वद्भ्यः।

  

It is appropriate that in a post about Mimamsa and a Mimamsa scholar, one of the contributions of Mimamsa be recollected. In the Veda, we have superlatives used for various devatas. Example: वायुर्वै क्षेपिष्ठा देवता। Does it mean other devatas are slower - say, in granting boons? No. Mimamsa teaches us that such sentences are to be taken as arthavada and that they should be understood as praising the devata in context, Vayu here, and not as a statement of fact comparing thesaid devata with others. Similarly here, the statement about Br. Mani Dravida Sastrigal being the last Brahmana should be seen only as an arthavada praising him and not demeaning other learned scholars..

Senani
