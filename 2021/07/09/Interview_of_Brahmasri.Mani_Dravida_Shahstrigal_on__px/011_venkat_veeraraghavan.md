Dear Sri Raghavendra,

  

Instead of indulging in strawman shadow boxing, contact English Literature Grads/postgrads and PhDs. Ask if your inference from my simple statement is justified.

  

You have serious issues with reading comprehension in English.

  

I am not going to respond to your verbal diarhoea. And I am not here to tutor unwilling people on the finer aspects of English.

  

Good day SIr,

  

V
