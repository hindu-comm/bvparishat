Thank you for this one,

  

***"There are many in this group who also qualify for that superlative...an immediate example that comes to mind is Shri Korada garu".***

  

While accusing me of being oversensitive, what has got demonstrated below is hypersentivity on your part by use of phrases viz., shooting from the hip / making a mountain out of a mole hill etc., Please read my posts on the subject again, I never use such language.  

  

How it dragged into whirlpool is evident in your inner narrative. I cautioned there being a whirlpool if one were to talk of a system of thought already dead and***one of the last real brahmanas left on***= is one of a group (Please note the use of plural brahmana***s) I have made note of the plural, but you seem to have left out one term in your narration which was there in the original post. How come?***  

***  
***

In one vein there is talk of rarefied level of language and in another there is talk oflayman's interpretation and in yet another one (another post) there is talk of application of the cannons of interpretative exegesis of मीमांसा, you seem to be all over the place.

  

\<\<Henceforth if you are....>\> Please don't direct others what they need to do.Questions will be asked, bit it is up to the person concerned to answer it or not.

  

Happy Sunday,

  

Thank you & Best regards,

I am reminded of a quote from John Wick...."..You dip so much as a pinky back into this pond... you may well find something reaches out... and drags you back into its depths"

  

I posted my original message merely to gently correct Shri Ramesh on his (inadvertent?) use of "Brahmarshi" in describing Shri MD.

  

Now to the main business at hand: pasting below verbatim what I wrote.

  

"I have had the good fortune of meeting this great soul. He is truly ***one of a kind*** and ***one of the last real brahmanas left on*** earth. Kindness, wisdom, clarity, vinaya and erudition rarely combine in one person."

  

I do not know what rarefied level of language you operate from, but my layman's understanding is as follows:

1.*one of a kind *= is unique (in this case in a good way)

2.***one of the last real brahmanas left on***= is one of a group (Please note the use of plural brahmana***s)***

***  
***

***I have nowhere suggested that Shri MD is the ONLY brahmana left on earth.***

***  
***

***There are many in this group who also qualify for that superlative...an immediate example that comes to mind is Shri Korada garu.***

***  
***

There is no hornet or nest here. All hornets and their associated nests are a product of one's own imagination. If one listens instead of filtering throough one's own inner narrative***it is possible for a dialogue to happen.***  

With conversation both parties gain.

  

Henceforth if you are oversensitive about use of language, kindly ascertain what is meant instead of shooting from the hip and making a mountain out of a mole hill.
