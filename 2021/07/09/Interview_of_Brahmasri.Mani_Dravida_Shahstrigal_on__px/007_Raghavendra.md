Hello Sir,

Greetings,

Misunderstand, I did not; “….one of the last real Brahmanas left on earth”… is stated in plain and simple language; there isn’t anything in it for misunderstanding; I have brought in Siddhanta position in parallel; it was never for fun; it has seriousness in it which become clear if my note is re-read; now the question asked is: if there is something more into it – serious or superficial?

Let me explain,

“Every age has its great men and women and therefore, to say, one of the last one left on earth is incongruous; I am reminded of the following touching and poignant words from the pen of a modern thinker, every word and even pause between the words of that saying are true and it leaves an everlasting impression on the mind, please read,

**“Lives of great men all remind us, we can make our lives sublime, And departing leave behind us, Footprints on the sands of time, footprints, that perhaps another sailing over life’s solemn main, a forlorn and shipwrecked brother, Seeing shall take heart again”, By Henry Wordsworth Longfellow.**

Great men have left footprints on the soil of this nation and it is a continual process and those footprints are never erasable.

A suggestion is made to read अर्थवाद (प्राशस्त्यपरम्) into what is said viz., “….one of the last real Brahmanas left on earth”…I defer it to learned scholars in the group to throw light on what is said qualifies for अर्थवाद or not.



Responses, rebuttals, and/or criticisms I am sure are on the way, and it is in order in a scholastic debate, but let me make it clear, I have said what I had to say going by what was stated earlier on and in the light of what I have quoted above there is nothing **‘dead nor is there the last one left’; footprints on the sands of time will go on and on and on.**



Thank you for your patience and understanding.

  
Best regards,  
Raghavendra,
