Greetings of the day,

  

Two disquieting comments found on the group today....

  

\<I thought it was already dead>

  

...there can be no total extinction of any system of thought…..they have been there and they are going to be there...may be inactive (temporarily) in the present…

  

Acharya Madhva in his अनुव्याख्यान (२.२.१-३ to ९) has this to tell us,

  

...अनादि कालतो वृत्ताः समया हि प्रवाहतः, न चोच्छेदोस्ति कस्यापि समयस्य…

तथापि शुद्ध-बुद्धीनाम् ईशानुग्रह-योगिनाम् सुयुक्तयस्तमो हन्युरागमानुगताः सदा । इति विध्यापतिः सम्यक् समयानां निराकृतिम्। चकार निज-भक्तानां बुद्धि-शाणत्व-सिद्धये।

  

If one were to listen to the interview carefully there is a mention of great men of letters who had dedicated their life to the study and propagation of that system of thought not so long ago. Mention is also made about receiving intricacies of knowledge pertaining to that thought from them.

  

\<He is truly one of a kind and one of the last real brahmanas left on earth>

  

Emotional intelligence / quotient is critical and it is best exercised. There are highly respectable men of letters with high erudition across the spectrum of thought of our soil. They command our reverence, not because of their age alone, but because of the lifelong dedication to the assimilation, preservation and propagation of thought. They possess encyclopedic knowledge which we experience reading their scholarly writings on this very group. I need not have to mention their names as we know them through their writings.

  

What if one were to ask,

  

He is truly one of a kind and Is he one of the last real brahmanas left on real or false earth?

  

I never wanted to ask this question, but I thought it fit to ask it to carry a message. I am fully aware that I have disturbed the hornet's nest here. One may have reasonings / justifications for the "two views" expressed, but there are other viewpoints also...



Thanks you and Bestregards,
