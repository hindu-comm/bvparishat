Thanks for the link, Nagaraj ji.

  

Puts a Saturday morning dizzy spin in my head...

  

I also read this interview of SwarnmalyaGanesh... and the jaw-aching and nonsensical mouthing of continental and new-American sophistry -- "patriarchy," "intersectionality," "marginality," by the interviewer from Ashoka University, and Swarnamalya's equallydistracting stretching of reality with the use of selective data. This is all stuff concocted in the hot houses of Western academe -- mindlessly imported by Indian "scholars" and artists, with TM Krishna the most prominent among them.

  

Sure, the popularity of teaching and learning the classical dances and music in newly independent India spawned and shaped new social dynamics, including the influence, of course, of films and the film-industry.

Sifting through the charges against Davesh by Swarnamalya also gives us an insight into the world of Indian art appropriated by Western academe and its battalions of scholars in search of data to fit preconceived theories, and in the pursuit of a livelihood.

  

Modern academe has turned monstrous, and the dollar destructive.

  

I am in the business too :-(
