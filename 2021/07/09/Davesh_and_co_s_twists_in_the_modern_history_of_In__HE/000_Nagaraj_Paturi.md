Modern history of all Indian classical dances : Sadir to Bharatanatyam , Telugu court and temple dances to Andhra Natyam /Vilasini Natyam, Traditional Kuchipudi to modern Kuchipudi, Krishnattam etc., to Kathakkali, Odisha temple dance to Odissi etc., have two common themes:

  

1\. Open up - from single gender heredity to both genders, from single caste heredity to people of any caste.

  

2\. Adaptation from traditional stage i.e., street, royal court floor or temple natya mandapam to modern proscenium/fourth wall stage

  

Both these aspects, like many developments of modern history with regard to traditional Indian life, allow two opposing perspectives:

  

1\. that of celebration, looking from the perspective of hereditary occupations to choice based occupations to be good , democratic, egalitarian , progressive etc.,

  

2\. that of the pain of losing hereditary rights by a gender or a caste  

  

Liberals, in general , advocate or give the impression of advocating #1 of the above two perspectives regarding these modern developments.

  

Davesh and co are doing what they are doing, as liberals or in the name of liberalism.

  

So logically they should celebrate Sadir, the Tamil court and temple dance or Telugu or Odisha court and temple dance shifting from the court and temple dancer community to the general population of all genders and castes, in becoming Bharata Natyam.

  

But their argument , in this case, is on the lines of the perspective #2 above , which in fact, is considered to be the perspective of the pro-caste, conservative, illiberal Indians.

  

One more of their arguments is the stigma attached to the premodern forms of these dance forms. This , they, unjustifiably and baselessly blame on Brahmanical patriarchy while the fact is that it is the Victorian morality of the colonial government and the colonized Indians that brought an unprecedented stigma towards the community and their dance.

  

Their attempt to blame all this on Brahmanical patriarchy is a clear attempt to whitewash the sins of the colonial rulers and their racial inheritors on whose pay rolls these tricksters are.

  

They are co-opting some modern educated women dancers hailing from these communities to speak this version of interpretation of modern history of these dance forms, who get easily played into the false sympathy towards them and scapegoating the usual scapegoats Brahmins, created by them.
