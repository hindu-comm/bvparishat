Namaste Everyone,

         Sharing a paper that I wrote on Swami Vivekananda's epistemological views which is forthcoming in*Philosophy East and West:*

*<https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351448454_How_Neo_is_Swami_Vivekananda's_Vedanta_A_Response_to_Rambachan>*

  

It is a response to Dr. Rambachan's influential book*The Limits of Scripture: Vivekananda's Reinterpretation of the Vedas,*and challenges the label of Neo-Vedanta applied to Swami Vivekananda.

  

Thank you,
