Namaste.

  

My father's gotra is पैंग्यस्. As pointed out, this 'sakaara' is wrong. We realised it only when in the Date Panchanga (from Solapur), the list of gotras was given, where there was no last 'sa'.

  

My question is related to this gotra. I noticed that this gotra is very rare among the देशस्थ ब्राह्मण in Mahatashtra. No पुरोहित would know about this gotra, and my father had to explain him with the pravaras etc.

Recently while searching on the internet, I found that this gotra is very common among the सीकेपी - चांद्रसेनीय कायस्थ प्रभू. CKPs are different from देशस्थ ब्राह्मणs. There is a controversyregarding whether CKPs are Brahmins or not.



How can the same gotra be used by two different varNas?

  

I'm researching our family history - our ancestors left Satara, having some dispute with the Raja, sometimes around 200 years ago and went and settleddown in Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh. They dropped their family name and adapted 'Ananthapur' as their family name. There is a street by the name 'A B street' in the old City Anantapur, where "A B" stands for Anantapur Baccherao. Baccherao was the name of our ancestor who left Satara. All my uncles speak Tanjore Marathi at home.

  

Any more information regarding the Paingya gotra of Deshastha Brahmana, is welcome.

  

Thanking you in advance,

Amba
