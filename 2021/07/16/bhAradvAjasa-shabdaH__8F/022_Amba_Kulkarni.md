Thank you Vishvas for this information.

  

Yes, I'm aware of this. And my hypothesis is that our ancestors had to 'run away from Satara, since they had disputes with the Raja. But apparently,they had support from the Britishers, since my grandmother used to receive pension from the Bombay Presidency.

  

By the way, will you please tell me which is this paper (excerpt from MD's paper) ?

  

Best,

Amba
