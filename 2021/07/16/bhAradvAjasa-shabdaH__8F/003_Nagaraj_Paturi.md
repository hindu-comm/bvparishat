Shandilyasa, Goutamasa, Yaskasa, Atreyasa, Kashyapasa (Kashyapas इत्यपि), Koushikasa, Koundinyasa, इत्यपि दृश्यन्ते। सर्वं प्रामादिकमित्येव ब्रूमः।

But such pramaada becomes a convention and leads to formation of certain words, whose praamaadikahistory is forgotten by people.

  

This phenomenon is given the name 'wrong splitting' in linguistics.

  

All these -sa ending forms are born out of the wrong splitting of expressions such as Shandilyasagotrah , Goutamasagotrah, Yaskasagotrah, Atreyasagotrah, Kashyapasagotrahetc.
