Dear Dr.Ambatai,

  

You may refer to different Gotravali(गोत्रावळी) books published by Datye and other Panchagakaras.

  

Gotrapravaramanjari would be the best book to refer to if you can lay your hands on it.Other books on Gotras could also be useful.

  

Best of luck in your search and research.

  

Warm regards.

  

Prof.Siddharth Y.Wakankar
