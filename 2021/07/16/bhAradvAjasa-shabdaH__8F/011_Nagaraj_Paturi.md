Place names and family names originating from place names are good examples for words formed out of wrong splitting.

  

At least in Telugu we have a humongous number of examples.

  

-a is a genitive case marker in Telugu. Most of the place names ending in -a are actually genitive case forms of the -u ending nouns.

  

For example , renTachintala is a place name. But rentachintala in Telugu can not be an independent word. It is always a genitive form former word of a compound. So some word like renTachintalapalle gets wrongly split and the the former word of the component comes to settle down as an independent word.

  

renDu = two; chinta = tamarind tree ; renTachintalu= two tamarind trees; (renTa -rusticization of renDu) palle = hamlet, village;

  

renTachintalapalle = a village of two tamarindtrees (a metaphor laakShaNikaprayOga) for 'a village identified with the landmark of the two tamarindtrees.  

  

palle is omitted as gataartha.

  

rentachintala remains.
