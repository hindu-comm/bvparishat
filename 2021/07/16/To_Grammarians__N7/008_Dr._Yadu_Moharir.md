Dear Scholars,

  

One can easily understand the core principle what Sri Achyut Karve-Ji is saying if one understands difference between terms "taala", "maatraa" and "laya (tempo)" in Indian classical music.  

  

Ek taala has 12 maatra's. but the division of thees 12 maatraa's is not evenly divided like "teen taala" that has 16 maatra's.

Pt Ravi Shankar when teaching his students the concept of "tihaaii" (a phrase repeated 3 times), he used to ask students to repeat "मेथि पालक चूका" 3 Times but the "SUM" must arrive (land onका and not चू ". This teaches student how to sub-divide for remaining faithful the the bandish.

  

My 2 cents

Dear Madhavi,

  

One need not place a virama, it occurs in faulty speech. A virama is experienced as a guttural stop in between letters of a word. It occurs in all syllabic languages. For eg. in the word 'compound' there occurs a guttural stop in between 'com' and 'pound'.

  

As suggested in my book a rule needs to be made for Sanskrit that while voicing successive letters of a word the tongue invariably needs to
pulled back each time so as to avoid a virama.

  

1\) In the word in question I suppose that श is replaced by स.

2\) As in the Marathi word शुद्ध the द and ध are by no means dental.
The द is alveolar and the ध is palatal.

3\) Now one needs to answer whyश is replaced by स. The answer possibly is on account of ध losing it's vowel and य coming in its place.

4) Once this is done one need not remove the द्resulting in sanyoga of three consonants द् ध् and य.

5) Since the time taken to sound consonants is negligible the matra remain the same.

  

I would like to hear from you what Paninian rules have been applied that the द is dropped.

  

Without prejudice.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
