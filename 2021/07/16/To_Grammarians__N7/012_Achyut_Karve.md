Dear friends,

  

The Sutra barakhadi will overcome the criticism of Panini that he did not read all the हल् letters by suffixing all the vowels including short and long and udatta and annudatta and swarita.

  

What about instruction about udatta, anudatta and swarita?

  

The answer is that the Bara khadi Sutras are read swarita. Once the prayatna of swarita is fixed one can easily read udatta and annudatta by virtue of sutras

उचैः उदातः and निचैः अनुदातः.

  

Thus all the variations of theहल् letters stand instructed.

  

My question is, can a shastra stand on a faulty prayoga?

  

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
