Dear friends,

  

The sutra तपरस् तत् कालस्य has a wider meaning than that pointed out by Patanjali.

  

Had the Mahesh war Sutras been recited with swaras all the sutras from the 5th to the 14th would have त as their pratyahara letter. That it is not indicates that the above letters are not recited with vowels instead all the sutras have consonants as their pratyahara letter.

  

What I have done is using तकारा as pratyahara to generate the barakhadi. From the barakhadi sutras one will notice that not only तकारा but all the letters of the त class have the same force depending on which of the consonantof a class is being phonated.

  

Attached are the requisite PDFs.

  

This shows that the tradition itself has come under the influence of the west for centuries viz. that a consonant cannot be voiced without being suffixed or prefixed by a vowel. This needs to be set right.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
