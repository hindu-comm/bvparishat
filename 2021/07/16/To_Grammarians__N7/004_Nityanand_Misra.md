Dear Sh. Achyut Karve Ji

  

Apologies, but I am thoroughly confused on reading all this. I do not understand most of what you wrote. How does द become alveolar? How
doesध become palatal? What does श in Sanskrit changing to स in Marathi (happens in Hindi also) have to do with यcoming in place of the vowel following ध?

  
Can you please share publication details of your book where this is discussed in depth. Are these your original ideas/theories or have they been expressed by other Marathi linguists/grammarians also? If so, can you please share their publication details also?

  

Thanks, Nityananda
