Dear Shri Korada Garu,

  

Namaskaram.

  

Thanks for your lucid and simple explanations.

सूर्यास्तमयः-- सूर्यस्य संपूर्णतया अस्तंगमनम् - अभावः - completely out of sight -- उपस्थानम् (उत्तमसन्ध्यावन्दनम्)।  
  

I remember reading that उत्तमसन्ध्यावन्दनम् is defined as arghya when nakShatrAs are visible at prAtaH-kAla and japa till sunrise (उपस्थानम् afterwards ) and arghya before suryAstaH and japa until nakShatrAs are visible(उपस्थानम् afterwards). This would imply उपस्थानम् happens some time after complete sunset at sAyamkAla. Even after complete sunset it takes some time before nakShatrAs are visible, depending on season no?

  

The other issue is for citydwellers since the horizon is not visible, it is simpler to go by the nakShatrA rule. Isn't it? Granted that one is advised to go to a river bank on the outskirts of one's town to do sandhyavandanam (this is not practical in the present context for most).

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
