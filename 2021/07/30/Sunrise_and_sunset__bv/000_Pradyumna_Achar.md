Respected list members,

  

What is the traditional definition of सूर्योदय for the purpose of daily rituals?

  

I am confused as to which one to pick among these

 a. when the top of the sun's disk appears on the horizon

 b. when the center of the sun's disk appears on the horizon

 c. when the bottom of the sun's disk appears on the horizon

 d,e,f. Options (a) / (b) / (c) with the calculated position of the sun, ignoring refraction

 g. any other definition

  

(And similarly forसूर्यास्त )

  

Thank you

Pradyumna
