सर्वेभ्यः नमो नमः!

  

In a certain संस्कृत book, the declensions of the following masculine तकारान्त words are listed: मरुत्, पचत्, धीमत्, महत्.

  

You come across a certain masculine तकारान्त word like हरत् (which means the one who *is* taking something away or the one who *is* snatching something). How do you decide according to which of the template words it declines?

  

The question, I guess, applies to other अजन्ताः and हलन्ताः as well. May I request you to simply explain the सूत्रम् that dictates such a choice?

  

Thanks and Best Regards,

Kedar
