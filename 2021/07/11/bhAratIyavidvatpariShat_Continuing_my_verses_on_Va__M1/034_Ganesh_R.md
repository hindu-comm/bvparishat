Dear Sri. Kushagra ji,

  

Since long I am observing your verses and their nature of gradual maturity in terms of both form and content. I am really happy with them. Please accept my best wishes. Recently I had an accession to watch your brief interview in vaartaavali. It was nice. Congratulations.

  

  

With best regards

  

  

Ganesh
