Dear Kushagra Ji,

  

  What a beautiful verse. Reminds me of Bhartr̥hari's Śr̥ṅgāraśataka. I have a question about your use of *mugdhvā*. From your translation, it seems that you are using it in a causative sense, from *mohayati,* rather than from *muhyati*, which is an intransitive verb in my understanding. I wonder how one can get the causative sense from *mugdhvā*. With best wishes,
