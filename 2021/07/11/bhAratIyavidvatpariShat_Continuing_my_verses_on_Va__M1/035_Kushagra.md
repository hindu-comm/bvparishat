Thank you, Dr. Rajaraman Ji and Dr. Ganesh Ji. I only started writing in Sanskrit a few years ago. First shloka in Sanskrit was written on August 17, 2018. Prior to 2018, I used to write in English and Hindi. Your appreciation continues to motivate me!

  

Dr. Rajaraman Ji, please share the काव्यमीमांसा verse if you have it handy.
