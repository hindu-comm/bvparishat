But we still need, and in fact must initiate, **a new counterpart of Chandamama/Amara Chitra Katha**

\- which would rather have **purely Hindu sources** (inclusive of course of

Buddhist, Jain, and Sikh sources too - as all these are Dharmic faiths, after all);

and more importantly, excluding all exclusivists - which is to say  

uncontaminated by any of the Abrahamic sources - which are all essentially predatory  

and menacing to mankind - destroying all native cultures wherever they have set foot.

  

\[Too few have learnt a key lesson of survival viz.

**the royal road to self-destruction is** to be tolerant of the intolerant.

Ironically, we have some of the best minds of our country - acting the role of intellectual coolies,

or perceiving a sense of fulfilment in acting the role of "faithful" sepoys to their Western bosses.\]  

  

\[We need to put an end to the current intellectual imperialism of the West:

which is to say - of its sophisticated supremacists and well-camouflaged racists.

We must study the West - especially in regard to their essentially deceitful conquests  

and techniques of genocide (physical/cultural, and currently mainly intellectual)  

that has marked their history through and through  

\- but only to be wary of them (and use it against them if need be);

but never emulate them.\]  

  

Is there no well-equipped man of vision in this vast country who can champion the cause of  

**a new family-magazine of stories** that answers to the above description?
