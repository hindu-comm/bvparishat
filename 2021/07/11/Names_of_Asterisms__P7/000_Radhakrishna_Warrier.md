Names of asterisms (nakshatras) provide interesting examples of phonological transformations that occur duringthe tadbhava process in Malayalam words. All the asterism names are tadbhava in origin. Looks like the tadbhava occurred in three time periods - a very old time period, an old time period and a relatively modern time period. Some of the tadbhavas might not be directly from Sanskrit, especially those of the very old time period. They could be from different Prakrits.

  

Here are the Sanskrit and Malayalam names of the 27 asterisms with my comments:

  

Sanskrit name – Malayalam name – Remarks

  

1\. Aśvini – Aśvati (അശ്വതി) – Relatively modern. The /śva/ would have changed to some other sound, probably /yva/ if it were an old or very old tadbhava.

2\. Bharaṇi - Bharaṇi (ഭരണി) – Relatively modern. The /bha/ would have changed to /pa/ if it were old or very old tadbhava.

3\. Kṛttikā – Kārttika (കാർത്തിക ) - Could be of any time period.

4\. Rōhiṇī - Rōhiṇi (രോഹിണി) – Could be of any time period.

5\. Mrigaśīrṣa – Makayiram (മകയിരം) – Old or very old.

6\. Ārdrā – \[Tiruv\]Ātira (തിരുവാതിര) – Old or very old.

7\. Punarvasu - Puṇartam (പുണർതം) – Very old.

8\. Puṣya – Pūyam (പൂയം) – Very old.

9\. Āślēṣā – Āyilyam (ആയില്യം) – Very old.

10\. Maghā – Makam (മകം) – Old or very old or even relatively modern.

11\. Pūrva phālguni – Pūram (പൂരം) – Very old

12\. Uttara phālguni – Utram (ഉത്രം) – Very old

13\. Hasta – Attam (അത്തം) – Very old or old

14\. Citrā – Cittira (ചിത്തിര) – Very old or old

15\. Svāti – Cōti (ചോതി) – Could be of any time period

16\. Viśākhā – Viśākham (വിശാഖം) – Relatively modern because the /kh/ and /ś/ remain unchanged

17\. Anurādhā - Aniẓam (അനിഴം) – Very old

18\. Jyeṣṭhā – \[Tṛk\]kēṭṭa (തൃക്കേട്ട) – Very old changed slightly (tiru became tṛ) during the old time period

19\. Mūla – Mūla (മൂലം) – Could be of any time period

20\. Purva āṣāḍha - Pūrāṭam (പൂരാടം) – Very old

21\. Uttara āṣāḍha - Utrāṭam (ഉത്രാടം) – Very old

22\. śravaṇa – \[Tiruv\]Oṇam (തിരുവോണം) – Very old

23\. Dhaniṣṭha - Aviṭṭam (അവിട്ടം) – Very old

24\. Śatabhishaj – Catayam (ചതയം) – Very old

25\. Pūrva bhādrapada - Pūrūruṭṭāti (പൂരൂരുട്ടാതി) – Very old

26\. Uttara bhādrapada - Uttṛṭṭāti (ഉത്തൃട്ടാതി) – Very old changed slightly during the relatively modern time period (Uttaraṭṭāti changed to Uttṛṭṭāti in the relatively modern time period)

27\. Rēvati – Rēvati (രേവതി) – Could be of any time period

  

Notes

  

1\. The difference between hrasva e and dīrgha ē, as also the difference between hrasva o and dīrgha ō are shown in transcription because Malayalam words had to be transcribed. In Sanskrit they are abhēda (without any difference).

  

2\. In the names of some asterisms a “tiru” equivalent to Sanskrit “śrī” is seen prefixed to the Malayalam tadbhava. When tiru is added, an āgama consonant might appear in the sandhi; tiru+ōṇam becomes tiruvōṇam, the “v” being the āgama consonant. Interestingly, the tiru appears to be a very old tadbhava; an old tadbhava would have been “tiri” or “ciri”.

  

3\. Intervocalic, non-geminate consonants are voiced in pronunciation. For example, Pūrāṭam is pronounced as Pūrāḍam, the ṭ getting voiced as ḍ.
