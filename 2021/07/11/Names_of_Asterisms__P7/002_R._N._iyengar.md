While relaive chronology (old/very old/recent) of names of nakshatras is interesting, something special is

  
**23. Dhaniṣṭha - Aviṭṭam (അവിട്ടം) – Very old**  

**  
**

I don't know what is meant by **Very old** here. The older name was Sravishtha श्रविष्ठा .

This श्रविष्ठा seems to be the origin of Avittam and not Dhanishtha धनिष्ठा. This observation indicates that

Vedic asterism names had been accepted by Tamil before classical Sanskrit recognized श्रविष्ठा = धनिष्ठा

Similarly 25 & 26 are likely related to पू ; उ प्रोष्टपदा
