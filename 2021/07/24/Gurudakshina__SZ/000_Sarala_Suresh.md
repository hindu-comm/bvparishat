I am running a crowdfunding campaign to help Reimagine Education. Education is the foundation for creating opportunities for an individual and for shaping the leaders of the future.  
  
This campaign aims to do three things

1\) Support the creation of the unique Chinmaya University at Kochi that integrates Indian wisdom with modern knowledge

2\) Sponsor/fund the education of underserved kids and

3\) Improve the infrastructure at Chinmaya schools pan India.  
  
INR 24000 p.a transforms the life of an underserved child for a year through the scholarship program. INR 15L funds the creation of a classroom at Chinmaya University.  
  
Please support this campaign by clicking on the link below and donate with Credit/Debit cards, Wallets, Net-banking, UPI, etc. This campaign has 80G tax benefits. You will also get feedback on how funds are used.

This is the ONE KNOWLEDGE ONE WORLD initiative and is being done in
partnership with the Central Chinmaya Mission Trust.

  

At the Lotus Feet of Pujya Gurudev,

Sarala Suresh
