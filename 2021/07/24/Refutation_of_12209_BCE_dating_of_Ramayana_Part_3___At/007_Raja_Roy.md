Respected Deva ji,

I have not dated the Ramayana. Refuting the dating of 12209 BCE itself has been a major task. In the near future I will be busy with refutation of other dates proposed by Mr. Oak. My immediate task is to contain the damage beingdone to our traditions by Mr. Oak. Some examples are changing the season of birth of Lord Rama, the date of Gita Jayanti, thedate of Bhishma Nirvana, all based on the absurdity of using analogies as astronomical observations. He has managed to change the traditional date of Mahabharata in "Date Panchanga". Hindu kids are making spark notes on hisbogus date of Ramayana and learning that Lord Rama was bornin Sharad, while the Ramayana is clear that Lord Rama was born in Vasanta. Once I am done refuting Mr. Oak's dates of various texts, I will see if I can take up the dating of the Ramayana.

Bestregards,

Raja
