Friends,

Good morning.

We continue on our effort to narrate India's story for the high school students. We chose Facebook as a medium for outreach. The known current chronology is divided into seven

historical periods and the effort is to develop the story in six tracks addressing the continuity

and evolution. We take a secondary school teacher's classroom view and create material

that can be used in classrooms worldwide. I handle Science and Technology track. We are

six in the team. I am giving the link of my article on Science and Technology for the period

200BCE to 500CE (labeled as Golden Period below). People may comment and guide us to  

refine the material for precision and clarity. There are other articles at the site. We plan to get feedback from the local teachers through workshops here in Massachusetts next Spring.  

Let me thank all in advance who may read and comment.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
