Thank you, Prof. Mahulikar Ji, Prof. Deshpande Ji, and Prof. Misra Ji.

  

I was honored and humbled to receive the first prize in the Sanskrit poetry competition organized this morning. I recited this गुरुस्तवः itself at the event. Jagadguru VidyabhaskarJi and Prof. Ramakant Shukla Ji graced the occasionwith their presence.

  

Best,

Kushagra
