We come across expressions like भुवनत्रयम्, त्रैलोक्य..., त्रिभुवन..., जगत्त्रयम्... Is thereany standard acceptance on what the constituents of this triad are? There is certainty on the चतुर्दशभुवनानि, with specific names, as constituting the Brahmanda. So, if someone's vyapti is to be infinite, it should pervade the 14 lokas. How do we match the above triad-expressions with the fourteen?

  

Thanks
