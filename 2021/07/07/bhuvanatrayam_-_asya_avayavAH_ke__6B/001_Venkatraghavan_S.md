Namaste Subbu-ji,

I think the three loka-s in the phrase भुवनत्रयम्must refer to bhU-, bhuvah-, suvah- loka-s.

  

The meaning of what is denoted by the phrase depends on the context. In the instances where the tAtparya is to convey IshvarasvarUpa, and the three lokas are mentioned to convey that Ishvara is भुवनत्रयव्याप्तः, we can take the phrase भुवनत्रयः to refer to all the loka-s (the entire universe) by ajahallakshaNA.

  

In other places, the intended meaning denoted by the phrase may be different. In the prANAyAma mantra, for example, the vyApti of Ishvara who is referred to by the praNava, is only with the higher 7 loka-s, but that does not mean in reality Ishvara does not pervade all the lower loka-s also.

  

Then why are only seven higher loka-s mentioned in the mantra? Essentially it is a case of tatkRta nyAyA, तं यथा यथोपासते तदेव भवति -
even though Brahman is nirguNa, the shruti sometimes teaches upAsana of Brahman with some utkRShTa guNa-s, so that the upAsaka gets those guNa-s himself. Here the shruti is prescribing a meditation on Ishvara as pervading the higher loka-s, so that the upAsaka gets the bliss of the higher loka-s.

  

Similarly, for example in the annapUrNeshvarI Sloka ending with स्वदेशो भुवनत्रयम्, the devotee prays to Parvati-Parameshvara saying the entire universe is his own native place - a "वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम्" like idea. Here the tAtparya of the Sloka is to pray for the devotee's well being. So here, I don't think we can take the meaning of the phrase भुवनत्रयम् by lakshaNAvRtti to denote the lower loka-s also, because such a prayer would inadverently be seeking the devotee's harm (by postulating an identification with the lower loka-s as the devotee's native place). Here the phrase भुवनत्रयम्must refer to the higher loka-s only.

  

Regards,

Venkatraghavan
