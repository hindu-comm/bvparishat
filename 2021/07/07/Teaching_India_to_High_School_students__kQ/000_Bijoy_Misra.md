Dear friends,

  

Good morning.

This is not a research question, but an outreach question. For many years,

the education of the youth about India and her culture has bothered me.

It has two aspects : (i) an understanding of what India and Indian culture is

and (ii) an articulation of it for the benefit of the high school students.

We have been struggling with (i) for about ten years now and we are now

just starting to prepare the course material for (ii).

  

We plan to convene a Social Studies teachers' workshop in late Fall or

early Spring to initiate a process of High School teaching in the US. I will  

appreciate to know any experience you may have with direct classroom  

experience in secondary school like teacher interest, student attention,  

course relevance etc., or any experience with preparing course material

for high school education like topic selection, audio-visual, interactivity etc..

  

Please feel free to write privately or post relevant experiences here.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
