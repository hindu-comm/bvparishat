Dear Professor Sundareswaran,

  

Many years ago, I had the honor of meeting Professor K. V. Sarma at the Adyar Library and at his home on the campus of the Adyar Library. It is wonderful to see your poetic homage to his memory. He was one of the rare scholars who could interpret and explain Sanskrit works on mathematics and astronomy. With best regards,
