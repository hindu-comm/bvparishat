The following is the message from Deva Pattanayak-ji:

  

Dear friends,

I am interested in Hindi translation of Spandan Karika. Only of the original Sanskrit text. Odia translation will be better.

Thank you. Please stay safe, away from unknown people and avoid indoor gatherings.

Best regards

Deva
