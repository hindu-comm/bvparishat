Which is correct, Rukmiṇī or Rugmiṇī (रुक्मिणीorरुग्मिणी)? In older Malayalam literature, the name used to be written as Rugmiṇi (രുഗ്മിണി) but nowadays it appears that Rukmiṇi (രുക്മിണി) is more popular.
(Please note that in Malayalam, the word-final vowel is always hrasva – short – even for Sanskrit tatsama words irrespective of the vowel being long or short in the original Sanskrit word.)
