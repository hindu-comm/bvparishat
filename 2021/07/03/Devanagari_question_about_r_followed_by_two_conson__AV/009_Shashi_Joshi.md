Dhanyavada, for this example.

This works only because 'tra' already has a saMyuktAkShara.

So, I didn't state the question correctly.

  

Attempt at framing the Q better:

  

rXYa  

\- where XY are consonants

\- they may or may not have a saMyuktAkSharaform

\- but two consonants (or even more), it is understood that 'r' will go on top of the saMyuktAkSharaOR to say, if 'r' is on top of a set of consonants (whether they form a single saMyuktAkSharaor not र्ध्नि = rdhniर्ध्व = rdhva ) - it is understood that 'r' comes before the entire set of consecutive consonants.

  

र् ध् न् इ = र्ध्नि dhna is written as conjugate,

र् ध् व् अ = र्ध्व dhva is not written saMyukta, it is dh and va  

  

अ प् र् न् अ = अप्र्न - Unicode algo gives this, but this is not necessarily the convention.

  

  
  

Thanks,
