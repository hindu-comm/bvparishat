Namaste



A connected question: What is the right way to display the ‘deergha-svara symbol’ in each language? How to decode ?

This leads to a deliberation: ‘How are we able to read the same sounds from different brahmi scripting conventions ?

How to teach this in Digital Literacy to read visual text ? Adding accent in an indiscriminate way, would complicate the story !
