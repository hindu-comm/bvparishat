Kannan ji,

Thank you for your patience, so far :)

  

Two reasons for my continued posts:

1\. Due to an error in formulation of my original Q, it caused a bit of confusion. (See below for rephrased Q)

2\. What we see in unicode when writing 'agrya' (as you posted in the mail), I was not sure if it was as per Unicode'sownalgorithm, or is it how it would be written, say when written by hand before computer fonts/printing press were created (both of which are limited by the number of letters they have).

  

I checked the word agrya in print (not computer), and found this in SKDrum

Again, not sure if this is also due to the limited letters in the printing press arsenal.

  

**So, for clarity, here is the question rephrased.**
