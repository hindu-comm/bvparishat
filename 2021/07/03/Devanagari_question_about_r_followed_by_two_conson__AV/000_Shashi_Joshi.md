Namaste VidvatjanAH,

In devanagari mUrdhni is written as मूर्ध्नि where the r is considered after dh in the way it is written.

  

If one were to write a word (which I can't think of any), where r is followed two consonants, e.g. **mUdhrni**, how would it be written?

Or, when r is on top of the akShara, or saMyuktAkShara, we always pronounce the r before the saMyuktAkShara.

  

Q1. How would **mUdhrni** be written in devanagari?

  

Q2. Are there any such valid words where r is followed by two consonants?

  
  

  
Dhanyavada,  
Shashi
