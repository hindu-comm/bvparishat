Namaste.

  

  

The conjuncts in Devanagari are written either from left to right or from the top to bottom and are pronounced in the same sequence.

  

The writing conventions for conjuncts with 'र्" as one [var.na](http://var.na) are as follows:

  

a\) If it is the first [var.na](http://var.na) of the conjunct, it is written on the top of the following [var.na](http://var.na)(s)

b\) If it follows any other [var.na](http://var.na) then it has two different shapes as in क्र & ट्र depending on whether the previous [var.na](http://var.na) has a verticalline or not.
