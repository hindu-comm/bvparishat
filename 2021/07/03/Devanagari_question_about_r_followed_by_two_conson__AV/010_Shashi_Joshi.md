Misraji,

Sorry for my incorrect wording.

I do know r followed by many consonants is indeed there.

  

What I meant was **XrYZa**, that is, a consonant string where 'r' is **NOT** the first one, but in between, maybe second.

How would that be written?  
  

Or is there a linguistic reason for 'r' to always be at the front of the consonant group, wherever it occurs?

  

  
  

Thanks,  

\~ Shashi
