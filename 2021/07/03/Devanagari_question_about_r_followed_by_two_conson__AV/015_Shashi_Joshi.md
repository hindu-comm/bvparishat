Namaste AchArya.

  

Here is a somewhat better attempt at the original question:

  

What I meant was**XrYZa**, that is, a consonant string where 'r' is**NOT**the first one, but in between, maybe second.  
How would that be written?  
  
Or is there a linguistic reason for 'r' to always be at the front of the consonant group, wherever it occurs?

rXYa  
- where XY are consonants  
- they may or may not have a saMyuktAkShara form  

\- if 'r' is on top of a set of consonants (whether they form a single saMyuktAkShara or not र्ध्नि = rdhni र्ध्व = rdhva ) - it is understood that 'r' comes before the entire set of consecutive consonants. Is this the rule always ? That if 'r' on top, then it **must**be before the entire consonant cluster?  
  
र् ध् न् इ = र्ध्नि dhni is written as conjugate,  
र् ध् व् अ = र्ध्व dhva is not written saMyukta, it is dh and va, and still it is understood that 'r' goes before 'dh' also, not between 'dh' and 'va'.  
  
अ प् र् ग् म् अ = अप्र्ग्म - Unicode algo gives this, but this is not necessarily the convention. In this case, the Unicode font did not put the 'r' on top (this may be its limitation), but how would it be written by hand, this same way, or p+g+ma with 'r' on top of 'ma' ?  
  
  

  

  
  

Thanks,
