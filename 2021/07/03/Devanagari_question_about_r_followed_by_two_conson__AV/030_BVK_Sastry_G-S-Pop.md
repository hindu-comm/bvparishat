Namaste



1. Interesting that ‘Anglo-saxon’ script felicity is being invoked in to the deliberation here.

The felicity point is ‘ Writing Sanskrit as spoken’ ( ukta- lekhana) = True –Scripting of Voice. 



2. Anglo-Saxon script was not designed as ‘ABUGIDA’ script. Anglo-Saxon has limited utility in serving the ‘True scripting’ needs of ‘Brahmi’ Devanagari.



 Brahmi Devanagari design provides True scripting with three layers:
(i) the base akshara (svara- Vyanjana) (ii) akshara-samyojana (
Gunita- Samyukta- abugida

feature) (iii) akshara- svara- ankana ( tonal –diacritic markers). 



3. Some links placed below may help to explore more on this issue . The summary pointer is the ‘Compromises accommodated in Typography and Fonts aiming for providing a digital tool for True scripting of Brahmi Samskruth Phonemes’ . 



True Phonetic/ Phonemic fonts needed for native needs of Samskrutham – Documents are yet to be seen on the horizon of Digital Font-arts, even at concept –level.

What seems to the trend is ‘ overlay of Brahmi on provided salad of
IPA / Roman –Latin Character set.



Here below are some links on how ‘ Old English /anglo-saxon linguistics are explored in language teaching and Technology-standards.
