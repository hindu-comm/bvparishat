Greetings of the day,  
  
The Anglo-Saxon script provides felicity of writing Sānskrit words as spoken, (the sequence of the speech sound follows without having to write them left to right or from the top to bottom.



मूर्ध्नि = Mūrdhni

दारिद्र्यम् = Dāridryam

कार्त्स्न्य = Kārtsnya



This is quite interesting; the Anglo-Saxon script which does not belong here, - but, it provides felicity at writing Sānskrit.  
  
Thank you and Best regards,

Namaste.





The conjuncts in Devanagari are written either from left to right or from the top to bottom and are pronounced in the same sequence.



The writing conventions for conjuncts with 'र्" as one [var.na](http://var.na==) are as follows:



a\) If it is the first [var.na](http://var.na==) of the conjunct, it is written on the top of the following [var.na](http://var.na==)(s)

b\) If it follows any other [var.na](http://var.na==) then it has two different shapes as in क्र & ट्र depending on whether the previous [var.na](http://var.na==) has a verticalline or not.
