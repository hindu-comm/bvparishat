Dear List:

  

Just like to mention here that Dr BVK has a US Patent for his samsk^rita "KEY BOARD" that is independent of the Operating System. Thus, it does not have to depend various gymnastics for creating graphic display of "FONT".

  

May be, one needs to start using our own "devanagari" script for correct display rather than ITRAN and other tools to achieve this.

  

May be Dr BVK will further elaborate on his Intellectual Property.

  

Dr Yadu

Namaste



A connected question: What is the right way to display the ‘deergha-svara symbol’ in each language? How to decode ?

This leads to a deliberation: ‘How are we able to read the same sounds from different brahmi scripting conventions ?

How to teach this in Digital Literacy to read visual text ? Adding accent in an indiscriminate way, would complicate the story !
