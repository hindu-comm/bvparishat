It is purely about how to read the script, or write if 'r' is followed by two consonants.

How does a beginner of devanagari know how to read - मूर्ध्नि

Is it mUrdhni or mUdhrni (assuming the person has never heard the word) ?

  

This is not a trick question at all :) a sincere question.

And also, if there are any real meaningful words that have 'r' followed by two consonants.

  

  

  
  

Thanks,
