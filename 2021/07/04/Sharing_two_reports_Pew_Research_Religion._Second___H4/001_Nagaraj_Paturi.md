Dear Dr Sastry avare,

  

Only one of these two is a survey report.

  

The second is not.

  

The second is a 'paper' in the form of 'inquiry' that claims itself to be 'pioneering' in taking the caste issue beyond India. (Though this kind of wrong use of 'caste' as a term for discrimination that leads to non-Indians see caste in India as the same as the discriminations in their own societies is not newly being done in this 'paper'.

  

In any case, this is not a survey report as the first one.

  

Let us not mix up things and add to the already existing confusions.
