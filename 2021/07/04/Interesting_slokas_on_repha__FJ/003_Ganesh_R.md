Yes, Dr. Shankar, these are quiteinteresting verses. When my revered guru and a great grammarian Mahaamahopaadhyaya N. Ranganatha Sharma ji was informally enlightening me about various aspects of Sanskrit, I had come across several such verses that beautifully describe the nuances of grammar. Hope somebody would have already made a compilation of such verses. Anyway, I am extremely thankful to Sri. Krishnaprasad for sharing these nice verses.

  

With utmost regards

  

  

Ganesh
