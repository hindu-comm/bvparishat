Thanks to pUjA, we were able to convert and publish a good portion of the mattUru shrauta prayoga book (first part). Available at<https://sanskrit.github.io/mattUru-shrauta-book/1/bhUmikA/01_agnihotramahimA/> .

  

Known defects - some missing pics, incomplete text (esp for second part). Corrections welcome.

  

कल्पविविदिषूणाम् अस्तु प्रीत्यै। सोमार्पणम् अस्तु।
