Aging!

  

कालक्रमे क्षयमुपैति यथा यथाऽऽयु:

क: काकदन्तगणनेऽविरतं प्रयास: ।

शब्दात्परं यदुवरं भज सुध्युपास्यं

मा ते रतिर्घटपटे भवतात् कदाचित् ।।

  

As life depletes in the course of time, why waste efforts in constantly counting the teeth of a crow? Be devoted to Lord Krishna, worshipped by the wise. He is beyond language. May you not seek delight in futile objects like pots and clothes \[or pots and pans, as we might say in English\].
