Aging!

  

कालक्रमेण तरसा वयसि प्रयाते

चिन्ता न मे किमवशिष्टमिहेति चित्ते ।

यावत्कृतं तदलमस्तु, कुतोऽस्ति भेद:

मेघस्य मोघमिह चेद् वदनं विवर्षम् ।।

  

With my age speedily moving ahead in the course of time, I am not worried about how much is still left for me. Whatever I have done is enough. What difference does it make if the clouds roar in futility without rain?
