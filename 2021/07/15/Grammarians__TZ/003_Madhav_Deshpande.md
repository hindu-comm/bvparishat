Grammarians!

  

सुध्युपास्यपदाम्भोधौ निमज्जन्ति सदा बुधा: । or \[सदाऽबुधा:\]

केचित् तरन्ति तत्रापि ते हि न: शाब्दिकोत्तमा: ।।

  

The learned often drown in the oceanic grammatical complications of the word suddhyupāsya “worshipped by the wise.” Some however survive, and they become our leading grammarians.
