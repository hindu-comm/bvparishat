With deep sorrow, we inform the sad demise of Prof.Venkataraja Sarma, who was principal of Tiruvananthapuram samskrit college and worked as principal researcher of पाणिनीयोदाहरणकोश and other works published by Ecole Francais de extreme orient in Pondicherry.

He was an authority on the Vykarana. He recieved Rashtrapati award and other titles like Mahamahopadhyaya etc.

I had fortune of working with him in Pondicherry for many years though I had nothing to do with Vyakarana.

Some of his publications can be viewed here.
