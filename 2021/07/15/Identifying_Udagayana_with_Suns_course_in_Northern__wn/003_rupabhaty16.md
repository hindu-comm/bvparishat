Namo namaḥ,

  

Dhanyavādāḥ Shriman Dr. Korada ji,  

  

The first Paṭala and all the sections of this Paṭala from Āpastamba-gṛhya-sūtra belongs to ceremonies involved in a marriage. Thus, "**उदगयन**पूर्वपक्षाहःपुण्याहेषु कार्याणि २" ; They should be performed during the **northern course of the sun**, **on days of the first fortnight (of the month), on auspicious days,** statement can have two interpretations about **"उदगयनपूर्वपक्षाहः**" as either "**first fortnight when the Sun is in northern course**" as always have been interpreted, or it should be **"Sun's course in Northern Hemisphere"**.

  

If we employ"first fortnight when the Sun is in northern course", then śiśira should be the auspicious season. Unfortunately this is not the case.

and we find the evidence in second section of the same Paṭala that śiśira is inauspicious to perform marriage ceremony.

  

I have no problem in understandingपुण्याहेषु = पुण्यनक्षत्रयुक्तदिनेषु, and the ceremony to be sought on only auspicious nakṣatra days in the first fortnight, in accordance to T.B;**तै ब्रा 1-5-2,** when the Sun is in the northern hemisphere, i.e., Vasanta. If I am wrong here kindly point me out.

  

My contention is to show that "**Udagayana"** means **the sun in northern hemisphere** which means **the time period during Vernal equinox to Autumnal equinox, which was known as deva-yāna or Deva-ayana** Thats all.

**

Hope this serves.

  

Regards
