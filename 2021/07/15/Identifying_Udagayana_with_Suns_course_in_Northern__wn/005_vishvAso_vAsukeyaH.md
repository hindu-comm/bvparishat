नमो नमः।  
  
Traditionally, सर्वऋतवो is taken to mean all 12 months - an exception to the उदगयन rule. So, that would invalidate your reasoning.

  

However, let us say that you are interpreting Apastamba correctly in saying उदगयन constraint should be applicableto vivAha as well. If so, the "सर्वऋतवो विवाहस्य शैशिरौ मासौ परिहाप्योत्तमं च नैदाघम्" rule simple constrains it further to disqualify 3 of the 6 months. Hence, there is no contradiction between the two rules. (In sUtra literature, this kind of "scope-shortening" rule is called नियम. ) None of this prevents vasanta marriage or saMbhoga.  
  

That said, my current understanding of the uttarAyaNa /udagayana identification is well stated by the great genius BG Tilak in Orion:  
  

\> Uttarāyaṇa (if such a word was then used), Vasanta, the year and the Satras all commenced together at the vernal equinox. The autumnal equinox which came after the rains was the central day of the year, and the latter half of the year was named the Pitr̥yāna or what we would now call the Dakshiṇayana. It is difficult to definitely ascertain the time when the commencement of the year was changed from the vernal equinox to the winter solstice.  
  

What we can say is that by the time of Apastamba, the Arya-s were solidly in India ("श्रवणापक्ष ओषधीषु जातासु"). Your reasoning can ironically be taken to support the argument that udagayana / uttarAyaNa had mostly come to take the currently popular meaning.
