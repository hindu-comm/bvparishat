आयुष्मती भव

  

Here the question is whether पुण्याह can be translated as an ' auspicious day ' or not .

  

Let us go to back translation -- ' auspicious day ' = शुभदिनम् , i e it can be any day like एकादशी / पर्वदिनम् etc - not necessarily ' पुण्याह ’ ।

  

As soon as the term ' auspicious day ' is heard one does not understand it as पुण्याह ।

  

Some people translate’ धर्म ’ as religion - let us go for back translation -- religion = मतम् , i e we do not get धर्म । So in such cases it is better to adapt / retain the word / term as it is and some explanation may be provided in parentheses/ footnotes / endnotes .

  

I think I am clear . There is nothing to discuss about the rest .
