Dear members,

  

Please find new evidenceon Udagayana fromĀpastamba-gṛhya-sūtra (आपस्तम्ब-गृह्य-सूत्र)- on Marriage and Ceremonies. Please read the evidence given below.

  

Regards,

  

Rupa Bhaty

  

-   -   Identifying Udagayana-Praśna 1, Section 1; अथ
        कर्माण्याचाराद्यानि गृह्यन्ते १; 1. Now (follow) the ceremonies
        (the knowledge of) which is derived from practice (and not from
        the Śruti). 2. **उदगयन**पूर्वपक्षाहःपुण्याहेषु कार्याणि २; They
        should be performed during the **northern course of the sun**,
        **on days of the first fortnight (of the month), on auspicious
        days,**
    -   Praśna 1, Section 2; सर्वऋतवो विवाहस्य शैशिरौ मासौ
        परिहाप्योत्तमं च नैदाघम् १२; 12. All seasons are fit for
        marriage **with the exception of the two months of the śiśira
        season,** and of the last summer month.
    -   The above reading clears all the doubts on the word "Udagayana".
        For the auspicious ceremonies, like marriage, has to begin in
        Udagayana but with an exception of the **śiśira season.** If
        Northern course Udagayana has to be from Wintersolstice in
        Āpastamba-gṛhya-sūtra then the exception of the śiśira season
        should not have been mentioned neither this would corroborate
        "northern course of the sun**, on days of the first fortnight
        (of the month), on auspicious days**,", i.e., it would not have
        mentioned the first fortnight after **śiśira** **since the two
        months of** **śiśira begins with winter solstice, unfortunately
        is being prohibited**. The two statements become contradictory.
        We have a long tradition of reading about marriages, copulation,
        Rati-Kāmadeva Mahotsava in the Vasanta season in Indic texts and
        poetries.
    -   **This find also clears the fog from the
        wordsUdagayanaandUttarāyana. Udagayana means Sun coursing in
        "Northern Hemisphere" and not "the northern course of the sun".
        The northern course of the sun is clearly stated as Uttarāyana
        in Jyotiṣa texts like Sūryasiddhānta.Sūryasiddhānta has
        differentiated between Deva-Ayana/Devayāna andUttarāyana. All
        the Indic texts compliment each other and are consistent about
        Udagyana-Sun's course in the Northern hemisphere. **
    -   **This study onUdagayana will have implications on dating
        Vedāṅga Jyotiṣa (udagatau+ dakṣiṇetievidence).
