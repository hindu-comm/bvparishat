Dear Prof Deshpande,

  

Yes, there is a recording available on youtube.

  

Here is the link:<https://youtu.be/JDNl8e_RvBE>

  

Unfortunately there was some internet problem at my end as well. However the main part of my talk could get transmitted well, as I had switched off my video.

  

Best regards,

Amba
