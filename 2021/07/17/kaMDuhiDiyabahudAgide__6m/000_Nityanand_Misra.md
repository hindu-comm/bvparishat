ನಮಸ್ಕಾರ

  

I need some help from Kannada-speakers? What is the meaning of the long verbal form ಕಂಡುಹಿಡಿಯಬಹುದಾಗಿದೆ (from N Ranganatha Sharma’s translation of the Valmiki Ramayana)? Google translator says “can be found”. Can somebody please break it down and show how it is derived?

  

ಧನ್ಯವಾದಗಳು!
