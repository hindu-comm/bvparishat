This is a good Gujarati-only translation of the Valmiki Ramayana.

  

Part 2 (Kishkindhakanda to Uttarakanda) is here: <https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.319139/page/n1/mode/2up>  

  

I am looking for part 1 (Balakanda to Aranyakanda)? A partial scan of part 1 (starting from page number 216, midway from sarga 34 of Ayodhyakanda,is here:<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.319028/mode/2up>. Does anybody have the link the full scan?
