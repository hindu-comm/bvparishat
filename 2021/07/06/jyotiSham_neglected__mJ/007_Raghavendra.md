Greetings of the day,

  

A question on the following,

  

To avert such disasters, King Janaka solemnized Sita Devi's marriage on the most auspicious moment, "yet the couple did separate. Sita Devi left Lord Ram".  

  

Should we not understand the above in the light of what Bhagavan Sri Vedavyas has said: मर्त्यावतारस्त्विह मर्त्यशिक्षणम्...श्रीमद्भागवतम् (५.१९.५) instead of taking it in the literal sense of separation etc.,.

  

Please guide,

  

Thanks you and Best regards,

नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

  

To avert such disasters, King Janaka solemnized Sita Devi's marriage on the most auspicious moment, yet the couple did separate. Sita Devi left Lord Ram. I feel there could have been deeper reasons, such as the Saturn being in the 8th house of Kumbha rashi. The 8th house Saturn is known to enhance the ill effect of theकर्कटकलग्नम्. May I hear your kind comments.?

In spite of the facts that are available from जातकचक्रम् , one has to take all the precautionary steps to see thatthere will not be further deterioration .

  

अष्टमम् is आयुःस्थानम् । शनि is आयुष्कारक and here he is in स्वक्षेत्र । So , we may take कुज in कळत्रस्थान ( so that one has to go to war with regard to wife ) and it is नीचस्थान as well as शत्रुस्थान for him . All the things for अशुभ got culminated and the effect was that .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
