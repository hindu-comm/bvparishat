Sunil Ji,

  

Moon is in Karka only, because it is supposed to be with Jupiter. Other five planets are supposed to be exalted (Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, Sun - all Kendra houses and Venus in the 9th). There is some debate on the placement of Mercury.

  

Yes, I don't agree with K.N. Rao Ji's placement of the sun. However, somewhere in the video (it has 4 parts), he has also given the date of birth. It is an estimate, of course.

  

I remember seeing the (publicly available, unverified) chart of Shri Raghuvar Das (Former CM of Jharkhand) - same Lagna and a few similar placements. I also have Karka Lagna (Sun in the 10th, Venus/Mercury in the 9th, and Saturn in the 8th).
