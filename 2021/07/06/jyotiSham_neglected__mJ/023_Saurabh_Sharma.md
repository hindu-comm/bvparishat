Dear Korada sir,

  

Thank you kindly. I will in the future reach out to you personally with a short summary of my queries.

  

I am currently referring to not only Jagaccandrika (Bhattotpala's bhashya), but other commentaries on Varahamihira's Brihajjataka by Talakkulathur Govindam Bhattathiri (Dasadhyayi) and Rudra (Vivarna). Can you suggest a good resource for improving one's grasp on vyakaranam, based on Panini, Patanjali and the other ancient grammarians?Also, are you aware any translations or just the devanagri text of a muhurta work titled Muhurtadeepika by Vishnusharman (a tika on his father's Vidyamadhava dated to 1360 CE), it is rich in quotations from many older authors (I was able to find pdfs in Kannada and Telugu but not in Hindi or Devanagri)?

  

Best regards,

Saurabh Sharma
