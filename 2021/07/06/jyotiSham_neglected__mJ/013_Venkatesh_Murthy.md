Namaste

  

ग्रहाः खलाः खला नात्र सौम्याः सौम्याः कदाचन।

तत् तत् स्थानानुसारेण भवन्तीह खलाः शुभाः॥

केन्द्राधिपतयः पापा भवन्त्यत्र शुभा यतः।

शुभाः पापास्तथा बोध्याः प्रबलाश्चोत्तरोत्तराः॥

There is no bad planet or good planet. Depending on the position in the horoscope they become good or bad. The lords of Kendras 1, 4, 7, 10 if they are malefics like Saturn, Mars or Sun become benefitsand vice versa if they are natural benefics they become malefics. Chandra, Budha, Guru and Shukra become more and more malefic in ascending order. Chandra will become a malefic but worse than him Budha, worse than him Guru and worse than him Shukra.

If the Karaka is present in the same house he destroys the house and gives bad results. Shani in eighthhouse will give bad results. Because he is Karaka for 8th. Similarly Brihaspati in 5th will be bad for children. If he is exalted there will be no children. The more powerful the Karaka is in this situation the more evil effects he will give.

  

Lords of 2nd and 7th become Marakesh and they will cause death. For Karkataka Lagna the lord of Makara Shani will be a Maraka also.
