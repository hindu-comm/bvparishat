Respected members,

  

you all seem very knowledgeable in the field ofjyotisha, especially Prof.Korada Subrahmanyam who has quoted relevant passages from several sanskrit texts, both astrological and non-astrological. Prof. Subrahmanyam at one place writes that उच्चगुरु in पुत्रस्थानम् gives a single boy only, however a few classics like Mantarswara's Phaladeepika say that it gives many daughters (ch 12 verse 5).

  

Regarding Lord Rama's jataka, Valmiki in the Balakanda verse 18.9 uses the word स्वोच्च for the five grahas, which can mean either in their own sign or exaltation, or in their own sign of exaltation. Which is perhaps why Kalidasa in his Raghuvamsham 3.13, taking the latter meaning, writes - ग्रहैस्ततः पञ्चभिरुच्चसंस्थितैरसूर्यगैः i.e. Five grahas were exalted and leaving the Sun during Lord Rama's birth. Now since the tithi was navami, the Moon has to be between 96 - 108 degrees from the Sun. The Moon is in Punarvasu, which lies roughly between 20 and 3 degrees of Sidereal Gemini and Cancer respectively, and the Sun can only be between 2 and 27 degrees of Pisces, which rules out the possibility of Sun being in Aries which is it's sign of exaltation. Since Mercury never goes more than one sign away from the Sun, It can only be in Aries, Pisces or Aquarius (and not in own sign / exaltation of Gemini / Virgo). Therefore we know now that Moon was in Cancer (own sign) with Jupiter exalted (कर्कटे लग्ने वाक्पताविंदुना सह), Sun in Pisces, and Mercury not in Gemini or Virgo, which leaves ambiguity only in the placement of the other three - Mars, Saturn and Venus. Even if these three were to be exalted, the total exalted planets would be (including Jupiter) only four, not five like Kalidasa writes. Therefore in their own sign or exaltation is the correct meaning intended by Valmiki. I give more details and references in a book I'm currently working on, which is an english translation of a 4000 verse phala jyotisha text written during the times of Varahamihira.

  

Best Regards,

Saurabh Sharma
