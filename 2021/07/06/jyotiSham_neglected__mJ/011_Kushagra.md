Thank you very much for your reply, Sunil Ji. By स्वोच्च, we mean स्वराशि as well as उच्चराशि. However, there is another verse in the चम्पूरामायण that states that five grahas were exalted.

  

उच्चस्थे ग्रहपञ्चके सुरगुरौ सेन्दौ नवम्यां तिथौ

लग्ने कर्कटके पुनर्वसुयुते मेषं गते पूषणि।

निर्दग्धुं निखिलाः पलाशसमिधो मेध्यादयोध्यारणेः

आविर्भूतमभूतपूर्वमपरं यत्किञ्चिदेकं महः॥

  

Besides, in this video by Sri K. N. Rao, Saturn is shown in the 4th house (Tula):

Hence, my query.

  

Best,

Kushagra
