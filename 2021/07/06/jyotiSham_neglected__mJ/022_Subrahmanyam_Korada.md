नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

  

Would love to have a small discussion on personal mail about a few doubts / possible corrections in my work if you're fine with it.  

  

                                   
                                   
            ---- Vid Saurabh Sharma

  

I have no problem . But it may be better to put any doubts on this group - there are teachers, both in North and South , on this list , who regularly teach ज्योतिषम् in Universitiesand they may also add to the discussion .

  

And thediscussion may be useful for many.

  

It is upto you to decide .

  

Since you are dealing with heavy duty works , I may suggest , take the help of व्याकरणम् and पूर्वमीमांसा while interpreting any text --- भट्टोत्पल on बृहज्जातकम् and गोविन्द (पीयूषधारा ) on मुहूर्तचिन्तामणि ।

  

The fact is that good knowledge of कृत् and तद्धित is essential to understand high level ज्योतिषग्रन्थs.
