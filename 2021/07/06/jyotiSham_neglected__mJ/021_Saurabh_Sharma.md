Dear sir,

  

Thank you for pointing out the correction in point 2 and the detailed reply in the rest of the points! Would love to have a small discussion on personal mail about a few doubts / possible corrections in my work if you're fine with it.

  

Regarding the use of the भम् in the sense of Rashi and not नक्षत्रम्, Varahamihira in the Brihat Jataka 1.4 writes राशि क्षेत्र गृह ऋक्ष भानि भवनं चैकार्थ सम्प्रत्ययाः i.e Rashi, Kshetra, Griha, Riksha, Bha, Bhavana all mean one and the same thing (ऋक्ष, Amarasimha writes, means नक्षत्रम् too). This could be because Hindu astrology uses fixed signs with whole sign houses, where amshas of Nakshatras always overlap with the rashis, which are treated as houses (Ancient Greek writers like Vettius Valens gave the star counts for the zodiac signs Aries etc. too, much like all ancient vedic and Jyotisha texts do for the nakshatras, somehow Indian texts never do that for the rashis).

  

Best regards,

Saurabh Sharma
