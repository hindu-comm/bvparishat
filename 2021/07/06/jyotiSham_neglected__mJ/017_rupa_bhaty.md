Dear Kushagra,

  

I am more interested to learn about the "12th month--Chaitra". In Valmiki Ramayana from where the Year began, and from where the seasons werebeing counted, remains a question?

  

Will it be the Winter solstice or Vernal Equinox (vasanta sampaat) i.e., half way of Vasanta month. In case you still stick to Winter Solstice as a year beginning, that would mean it's a case of the Hemanta just before the two months of Shishir season. It appears to me that the versesrelated to Chaitra are basically theinterpolations. Or, either it shows that this one particular verse was edited when **Chaitra was literally in the 12th month** (If samvatsara in WS then Chaitra in Nov-Dec = 12000 to10000 years ago, or if the new year began from VE then Chaitra as a 12th month in Feb, i.e., 3500 years ago, i.e., around 1400 BCE, i.e., after the famous Kaliyuga 3102 BC). However, this goes against some of my findings too which will come later in my book, "*Tale of Three Cities, Kurukshetra, Avanti And Lanka*" with a few verses which identifies Lanka at equatorand south of equator only during @12000 BCE.

  

Secondly, the verse states"स्वोच्चसंस्थेषु", which would mean all the grahas were either exalted or in its own house which makes most of the grahas/planets with dual possibility,and the permutation and combinations will have a myriad impact on studying the Horoscope. The estimates given by many reseachers are generic in sense. Still the readings can get highlynon effective if the exact timingis not known true to withintwo minutes of birth, since shaShThyAmsha changes drastically giving variedresults even for the identical twins (for example Laxmana and Shatrughna had different meted fate). My real life mother-in -law and her sister, identical twins separatedby a few minutes, haddifferent fate altogether,even their ailment,marriage, and children were separatedby 8+ years. How to reconcile this...

  

We had the pleasure of meeting Shri KN Rao ji, years back. Though he discussed Shri Ram's janma kundali (coincedently he talked since my husband's horoscope was a little similar to Shri Ram's),yet he had apprehensions that a huge time lapse maynot give the desired understanding of what we are thinking of (this was his personal view).

  

Regards
