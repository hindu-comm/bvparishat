Dear Shri Korada Garu,

  

Thanks for the details about jyotisham.

I have a query.

Was Jyotisham traditionally used superficially along with certain nimittas?

If you refer to the Valmiki Ramayan at<http://valmikiramayan.pcriot.com/utf8/yuddha/sarga4/yuddha_4_frame.htm>

  

अस्मिन् मुहूर्ते सुग्रीव प्रयाणम् अभिरोचये \|  
युक्तो मुहूर्तो विजयः प्राप्तो मध्यम् दिवाकरः \|\| ६-४-३  

  

further

उत्तरा फल्गुनी हि अद्य श्वस् तु हस्तेन योक्ष्यते \|\| ६-४-५  
अभिप्रयाम सुग्रीव सर्व अनीक समावृताः \|

उपरिष्टाद्द् हि नयनम् स्फुरमाणम् इदम् मम \|\| ६-४-७  
विजयम् समनुप्राप्तम् शंसति इव मनो रथम् \|  

  

Even for a very important task, Rama looks for theconjunction of certain nakShatras and does not go too deep into grahas and aspects.

Is it possible that the more involved application of jyotisham is a modern addenda?

  

Look forward to your thoughts,

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
