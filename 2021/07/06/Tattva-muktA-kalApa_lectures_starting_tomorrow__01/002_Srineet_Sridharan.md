Hello Krishna Kashyap Mahodaya,

  

This is wonderful to hear. I have gone through M.A. Alwar's 85+ (I think) Sanskrit lectures on Nyayashastra available on YouTube and really liked and value them. Would these lectures on Tattva-mukta Kalapa be uploaded as well? I ask because due to office etc. I will not be able to attend these sessions live, and I think there might be others with a similar problem. Also, uploading them would help for future access too.

  

Request you to please consider taking up this request and upload these videos for offline viewing.

  

Thanking you.

  

\- Srineet.
