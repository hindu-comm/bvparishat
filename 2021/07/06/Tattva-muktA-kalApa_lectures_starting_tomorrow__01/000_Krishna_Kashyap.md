**The doctrine of Visistadvaita, expounded by Ramanuja, was developed into a sound system of philosophy by one of his illustrious successors, Sri Venkatanatha, \`popularly known as Sri Vedanta Desika\`. His chief contribution to the intellectual foundation of the system lay in the composition of the text of Tattva-mukta-kalapa, a treatise of significant philosophical import left for posterity.**  

  

**On this topic, Sri M.A Alwar will be giving"lectures in Sanskrit language"3 times a week. M, W , F morning 8am to 9am IST, starting the day after tomorrow.**
