Please note: for every 2 lectures in Sanskrit, Sri M.A Alwar will summarize in the 3rd lecture the contents of the first 2 lectures in colloquial easy to understand Tamil and English (mixture). If you know Sanskrit you don't have to worry about the 3rd lecture. You can follow the first 2 lectures in Sanskrit itself. For those who cannot understand Sanskrit well, the third lecture will have the summary in a mix of Englishand Tamil to make it easy for other people.

  

I would like to keep all the TMK related messages directly on the TMK channel on telegram to avoid cross-postings. Please join and ask questions on that channel regarding TMK rather than on this bvparishat group.

  

Thanks.
