Dear Members,



I am happy to share with you that I have just published my new book titled, “Oral Cancer -Astrological Prediction and Remedies”. This e-book is based on my Ph.D Thesis analysing 100 horoscopes of oral cancer cases and more than 70 horoscopes of cancer in general and diseases of the face and the mouth.



This book serves as a guide in medical astrology not just for the astrologers and astrology enthusiasts, but also for those who have no previous knowledge of astrology. This book is the first of its kind in detecting oral cancer in the horoscope. It also offers techniques of predicting different types of cancer, diseases of the mouth and the face including various kinds of eye problems, speech disorders, cleft palate and five types of non-cancerous and pre-cancerous lesions in the mouth. A section on palm lines related to prediction of diseases is added. More importantly the book offers simple astrological remedial measures, the scientific rationale behind them and the methods to derive remedies from the horoscope.

In a few days the paperback edition will be brought out.



The e-book is available in Amazon.com
