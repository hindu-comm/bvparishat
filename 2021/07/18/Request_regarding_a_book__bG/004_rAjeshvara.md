Respected Vineet Sir,

Thank you for your reply,

I came to know about 'Sikshaa Saastr ke itihaas' book from that 'Sikshaa-sootraaNi' book only.

In the preface of this book, Miimaamsak Ji mentioned that he will be explaining in detail about Sikshaa in the perticular book (please find the attachment).

But I don't know whether it was completed and printed or not.

If not, I request you and other scholars to through a piece of information regarding the history of the Sikshaa-shaastra.

Already, I have three books regarding Sikshaa. Those are

1\. Sikshaa-sangraH

2\. PaaNiniiya-Sikshaa by Manomohan Ghosh

3\. PaaNiniiya-Sikshaa by Balakrishna-sharma

  

Respected Nagraj Pathuri gaaru

Thank you very much for the reply and valuable link as well.
