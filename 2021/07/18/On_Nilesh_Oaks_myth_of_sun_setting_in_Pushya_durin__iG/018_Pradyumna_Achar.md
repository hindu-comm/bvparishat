Sri Kalicharanji,

  

Could you kindly correct my understanding of your statement if I have understood it wrongly:

 - We have to interpret texts with an assumption that the authors were lying or hiding the truth, for whatever reason

 - We have to extract the truth from statements in the texts where the author could have inadvertently leaked the truth

 This is the better approach rather than assuming that what is written is true unless proven otherwise.  

  

Regards

Pradyumna
