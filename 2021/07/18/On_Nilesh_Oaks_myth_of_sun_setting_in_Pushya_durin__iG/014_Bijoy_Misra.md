The whole episode looks to me like the social media disinformation that has become rampant in the US lately.

The technique is to take advantage of the general illiteracy of people and then attempt to throw material that

might stick. In certain cases the process is political. Use of abusive language is common. A lot of bad

in the world has happened through mob mobilization.  

During occupation and colonial times, misinformation was spread as official circulars. Lately governments  

sometimes broadcast false information for political purposes. In the scholarly world, plagiarism has been noted.  

But the trend to unanalytic assertion is a new phenomenon. We had a public examination of one event.

There could be several others plotting their own schemes.

While some of us are attempting to reach out to the new youth, blots of this kind become incompatible to

the elucidation of pristine analytic inquiry that India gave to the world. We need more vigilance.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
