Shatavadhani Galu,

  

Thanks for your kind words. I can only say what Kalidasa said,

  

आ परितोषाद्विदुषां न साधु मन्ये प्रयोगविज्ञानम्।

बलवदपि शिक्षितानामात्मन्यप्रत्ययं चेतः॥

  

Until ‘vidvajjana’s like you are satisfied, I do not consider my expression to be any good. Your satisfaction is the litmus test of a good expression.

  

धन्योऽस्मि
