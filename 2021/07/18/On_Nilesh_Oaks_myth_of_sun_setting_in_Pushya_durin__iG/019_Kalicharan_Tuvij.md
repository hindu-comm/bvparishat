Pradumna ji,

  

You're nearly correct in the reading. We should even eliminate "motive" from it to take it further.

  

For indeed, while analysing "time domain data" (TDD) the scientist/engineer often gains better insight by translating the same into "frequency domain".

  

Ramayana text \~ "time domain data"

of which the "frequency translation" (i.e. research) should yield already two "peaks":

1\) \~300 AD when the text was written (linguistics corroboration too).

2\) a much more ancient date (nothing to feel ahamed about it).

  

Besides the point, but there's another basic observation:

"One cannot question a hypothesis directly".

Precession in panchanga is a hypothesis.
