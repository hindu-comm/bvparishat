Greetings of the day,



**Disclaimer**: I am not a historian. I am in no way contributing to the series of discussions on the subject at hand. I am sharing information only. However, I have one question towards the end.



The southern recession of **mahābhārata** has following verses in the beginning of the **50th chapter of sabhā parva** which appear to indicate in clear terms the **date of rāmāyaṇa**,



भीष्म उवाच,

श्रुणु राजंस्ततो विष्णोः प्रादुर्भावं महात्मनः /

\*अष्टाविंशे युगेचापि\* मार्काण्डेयपुरःसरः //१//

तिथौ नावमिके जज्ञे तथा दशरथादपि /

कृत्वाऽऽत्मानं महाबाहुर्श्चतुर्धा विष्णुरव्ययः //२//

लोके राम इति ख्यातः ………………..//३//



(found in 1906 edition printed at nirṇaya sāgar press, Bombay, edited by śrīyuts TR Krishṇāchārya and TR Vyāsāchārya)



The date of rāmāyaṇa was during the **28** **महायुगान्तर्गत त्रेतायुगे** is clear from the above verses.



According to the traditional account held within the **school of श्रीमद्-आनन्दतीर्थ-भगवद्पादाचार्य** is that the manifestation of **paraśurāma and rāmachandra** took place in the **28th mahāyuga itself**. The mahābhārata was in 28th mahāyuga (dvāpara).



**The question is** - How do paraśurāma and rāmachandra belong to the same 28th mahāyuga? The answer is this - we hear about the battle between **kārtavīryārjuna and rāvaṇa** and the former defeating the latter in the annals. Kārtavīryārjuna was one among the innumerable warrior kings killed by **paraśurāma**, this incident unmistakably points to the fact that **bhārgavarāma, rāgḥavarāma, kārtavīryārjuna and rāvaṇa belonging to the same age (which is 28th mahāyuga)**



As per **devamāna** (1 = 360), we have a total of 1200 years of all the yugās put together.



4800 = Kṛutayuga

3600 = Tretāyuga

2400 = Dvāparayuga

1200 = Kaliyuga



Approximately, 14 years out of the 1200 devamāna years have gone by, in Kaliyuga. We get 6014 (3600+2400+14) devamāna years,



Question - Is it safe to consider that rāmāyṇa took place 6,014 devamāna years ago, based on the traditional account?



Thank you and Best regards,  
Raghavendra
