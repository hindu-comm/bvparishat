Dear Sri. Nityananda Misra,



Thanks a lot for your erudite articulation of the meaning of the verse misinterpreted by Mr. Oak, presumably thinking that हिमारुणाः refers to the sun. As soon as his interviewin DD was telecast, I wrote in Jan 2020 the three mistakes in his understandingof Caitra- Sharad, Abhijit as the pole star and the sunset in the sign Kataka in Hemanta Ritu.

<https://jayasreesaranathan.blogspot.com/2020/01/should-dd-doordarshan-promote-mis.html>




In the context of the sunset, I would like to add that, startingfrom the 4th verse in that chapter (VR: 3-16), Lakshmana is talking aboutwhat is called "the pregnancy of clouds" - known as "Garbottam" in Tamil about which I am doing a 9-year long research (currently in the 6th year of this research). I maintain a separate blog for this topic to bring out the ancient wisdom of rainfall prediction from the Pregnancy that is watched in two ways,

(1) for the 14 days of the sun’s transit in the star Purvashadha and

(2) for six months starting from Hemanta ritu to Vasanata ritu

(or from Arudra darshana to Arudra Pravesha when the Sun enters the star Arudra) <https://jayasreeweatherblog.wordpress.com/>



Throughout that chapter we can see the Pregnancy features expressed by Lakshmana. One of them was the early night dew enveloping Pushya. The mention of three Yaama (1 Yaama = 2 hours, 24 minutes) following this shows that the star Pushya had risen after sunset. The specific reference to Pushya shows that the sun was in the 3^(rd) degree of Purvashadha (or 17^(th) -18^(th) degree of Sagittarius). The nature of rainfall later when the sun would be transiting Pushya is known from the features on the 3^(rd) day of the sun’s transit in Purvashadha. So, Lakshmana was observing the 3rd day of the 14-day pregnancy period. In this period the sun must be reddish. He does mention that. For the kind of features to observe for pregnancy of rainfall: <https://jayasreeweatherblog.wordpress.com/2017/12/31/how-to-observe-garbottam/>



We find a corroboration for this Rama’s description of the rainy season when he refers to the nine-month pregnancy: “nava maasa dhritam garbham Bhaskarsya Gabhastibhih” (VR: 4-28-3). Based on the first type of 14-day observation, Bhadrapada is the ninth month. Expectedly Rama refers to the Upakarma of Saama Vedins in Bhadrapada in that chapter. That description of Rama had taken place in Bhadrapada Hasta or immediately after Hasta in that month. Lakshmana’s talk in Hemanta Ritu had taken place on the 17^(th) or the 18^(th) day of solar Margashira month.



This is to highlight that Astro-meteorology helps in understanding certain verses and in deriving the date of observation. The dew in Pushya star observation is of that category and not as what Mr. Oak thinks.



I have spoken about the ‘Pregnancy’ feature in that verse in this video from 28 to 36 minutes.
