Dear Dr Raja,

I have never met Nilesh, it appears that he possesses an abusive temper.  

While I appreciate his zeal, he lacks scholarly training and humility of knowledge.

He is young, can develop in time. I would appreciate if he understood why the  

text has to be understood in its full context.

I appreciate your work though the line of research of astronomical dating does not

interest me. A sky map should only be used as a supplement.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
