Dear Prof. Misra,

Mr. Kalicharan Tuvij did not respond to your email. However, Mr. Nilesh Oak is using Mr. Tuvij's remarks to show me and Nityananda ji in bad light. He uses the term "Woke Indic Gang". Is Mr. Oak unaware that you had responded to Mr. Tuvij? Please see the detailsbelow.

Bestregards,

Raja
