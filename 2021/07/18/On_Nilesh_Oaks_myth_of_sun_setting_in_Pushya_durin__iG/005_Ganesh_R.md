Dear Sri. Nityananda Mishra,

  

Thanks a lot for your thoroughly researched post. I am amazed by your patient and critical acumen. It demands so much of study and academic diligence to present the facts so well. I am also impressed by the dignity with which you have handled the present issue. Please accept my heartfelt appreciation and I also wish that self styled scholars and indologists who have no first hand knowledge of the original texts would learn from such critical feedback.

  

  

Withutmost warm regards

  

  

Ganesh
