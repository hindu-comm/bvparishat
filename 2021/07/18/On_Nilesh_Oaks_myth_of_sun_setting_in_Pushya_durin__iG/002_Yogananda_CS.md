Namaste,

  

That's an impressive assembly of resources! In the Kannada translation, a word has been missed in the first sentence:ರಾತ್ರಿಯ ಹೊತ್ತು ಬಯುಲಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಜನರು ತ್ಯಜಿಸಿದ್ದಾರೆ. The correct sentence is:ರಾತ್ರಿಯ ಹೊತ್ತು ಬಯುಲಿನಲ್ಲಿ ಮಲಗುವುದನ್ನು ಜನರು ತ್ಯಜಿಸಿದ್ದಾರೆ. (With the word ಮಲಗುವುದನ್ನು, meaning \`sleeping' missing, the sentence would mean 'During the night people have given up in the open field'; what is given up in the open field during night is not hard to imagine!☺).

  

regards...........................yoga
