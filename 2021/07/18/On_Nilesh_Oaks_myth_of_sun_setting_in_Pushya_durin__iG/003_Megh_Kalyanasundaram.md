FromManogna Sastry and myself:

  

Thank you for writing (and then sharing) such a detailed, pointed and sumptuously referenced article which clearly is—well it seems so to us at least—written in a way that, amongst other things, 1) facilitatesengagement with its details devoid of unverifiable claims 2) is thoughtfully structured and 3) simply gets on with the job of being carefully reasonedsans grandioseprefaces to that effect.

  

We learnt more than a thingor two from this article including sources we did not know of before.

  

Best,

Manogna, Megh
