ಧನ್ಯವಾದಗಳು, Dr. Yogananda. I may have missed the word while typing the Kannada part. It was a pain to type all the various citations in Gujarati, Marathi, Kannada, etc.I have corrected the mistake in the edition of the article on medium:<https://medium.com/@nmisra/26ef0fe7bccc>.

  

PS: I hope one day N. Ranganatha Sharma's scholarly translation of the Ramayana is available as Unicode text, so I can copy-paste and cite from it without having to type the citations.
