We have to be careful here, and not allege malfeasance when all that has happened is the unwillingness of a scholar to engage with his critics, and his use of smelly red herrings to distract his thirty thousand plus followers from the arguments put forth and evidence offered by his critics.

  

As I have said repeatedly, all that was needed of Nilesh was to acknowledge that his critics had offered new evidence and had done some careful analyses of his theses, and that if he found any mistakes in his work he would correct them.

  

Alas, the theses he has offered are of such seductivity and power that he could not muster the courage to say "mea culpa". Instead he has blustered, feigned harm, and committed himself to the "best defense is offense" (alas, it has only been offensive...) strategy believing that his critics will tire soon and go away and allow him to ride the tiger to TV studios and Amazon sales.

  

Nilesh has done a lot of work. Let us give him credit. But then he has been so carried away by his own "insights" that he has now, perforce, become a huckster. Alas, mutual friends, who have been so taken in by his claims, are also getting trapped in the "best defense is offense" strategy, and are becoming abusive. For the good and the welfare of his friends and followers, Nilesh should call a halt to this offensive behavior, especially on social media.

  

There is still time for him to apologize, make course corrections, and work with scholars to repair the damage he has done.

  

Dr. Saranathan, Dr. Raja Roy, and a few others have diligently, painstakingly sought to unpack Nilesh's theses, and Nityananda ji now offering his broad scholarly shoulders to this effort should at last get Nilesh to stop stonewalling.

  

Acknowledging mistakes takes courage. It is hard. Earlier we do it the better.

  

Many thanks to Nityananda ji for bringing his scholarship, his experience to bear upon these matters.

  

Regards,

  

Ramesh Rao
