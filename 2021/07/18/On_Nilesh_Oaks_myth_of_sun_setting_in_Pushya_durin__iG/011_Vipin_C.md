Dear Nityananda Mishra Ji,

  

Thanks a million for sharing with us so thorough, logical, scholarly analysis on this topic. I am not a Sanskrit scholar but a student of biological/medical sciences. Your detailed presentation of critical evidence from other peers/scholars in the filed is commendable and so much in tune with what we practice. There is a need for all scholars to come together and present the best evidence on these kind of issues so that we could arrive at the truth (based upon our material senses). There is so much more to learn and “manthan” is the need of the time.

  

Best regards,

  

Vipin K Chaturvedi
