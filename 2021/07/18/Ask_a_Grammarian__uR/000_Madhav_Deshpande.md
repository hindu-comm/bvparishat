Ask a Grammarian

  

ईशावास्यमिदं सर्वमिति प्राह यदा श्रुति: ।

का चिन्ता धययोश्चित्ते सुधियो वद माधव ।।

  

Tell me, Madhava: When the scripture says that the entire universe is pervaded by the Lord, why should the wise care whether there are one or two “dh/y” sounds \[in the word “sudhyupāsyaḥ”\]?
