What is the etymology of the Hindi suffix vālā, vālī (वाला, वाली)?

As in:

Bhājīvālā (भाजीवाला) – vegetable vendor (Mumbai Hindi)

Gharvālī (घरवाली) – one who takes care of the home, wife

Maiṃ jānevālā hūṃ (मैं जानेवाला हूँ) – I am about to go

  

Is the word cognate with Sanskrit kāra (कार)?

As in:

Kumbhakāra (कुम्भकार) – potter

Bhāṣyakāra (भाष्यकार) – one who wrote the bhāṣya
