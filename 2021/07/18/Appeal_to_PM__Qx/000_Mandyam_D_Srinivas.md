Respected Scholars,  

  

I am forwarding an appeal requesting the Prime Minister of India for full and effective use of Indian systems of medicine in the prevention and treatment of Covid. The appeal has been initiated by colleagues in the PPST Group ( Patriotic and people-oriented Science and technology Group). It is likely to be signed by a large number of practitioners of the indigenous systems of medicine; some senior practitioners of the modern system of medicine; several senior scientists and technologists; and, leaders of public opinion in different fields.



If you agree with the above appeal, please send a reply by e-mail to me ( at [mdsrin...@gmail.com]()) the following format, mentioning your e-mail id or contact number.

  

With best regards

  

M D Srinivas
