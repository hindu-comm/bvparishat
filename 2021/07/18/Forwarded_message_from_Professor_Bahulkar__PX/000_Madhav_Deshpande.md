डान क्व् िक्षोटः Don Quixote

(Chapters I.2, I.3, I.8, I.10, I.16, I.17, I.18 & I.23)

By Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra

Translated from English into Sanskrit by Jagaddhar Zadoo & Nityanand Shastri

Introduced and edited by Dragomir Dimitrov

With a reprint of the English translation by Charles Jarvis and

An audio recording of the Sanskrit text by Shrikant Bahulkar

SUMMARY: The present book contains a modern Sanskrit translation of eight

chapters from the First Part of Cervantes’s monumental Don Quixote. In this book

both the Sanskrit translation and the corresponding parts of Jarvis’s English

version are printed on facing pages. The Sanskrit text, typeset with a newly

produced historical reconstruction of a Nagari typeface designed by the German

critic, translator, poet, and Sanskritist August Wilhelm von Schlegel (1767–1845),

has been edited on the basis of a unique manuscript which was written in Kashmir

in the winter of 1936/37 and is now kept at the Houghton Library of Harvard

University, USA. This publication includes an overview of the reception of

Cervantes’s classic in India, as well as a detailed study of the fascinating history of

the Sanskrit translation of Don Quijote and its still unedited partial rendering in

Kashmiri. The printed book is accompanied by an audiobook containing the

recording of the entire Sanskrit text read by Prof. Shrikant Bahulkar in Pune

2017/18.
