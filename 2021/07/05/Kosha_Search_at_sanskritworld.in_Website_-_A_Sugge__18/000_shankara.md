Dhaval ji,

  

The following is a humble suggestion regarding the Sanskrit Kosha Search at [sanskritworld.in](http://sanskritworld.in)  

  

At present, the results from various koshas can be seen only by clicking on each button separately.  

  

Instead of this, if the results from various kosas are displayed one below the other, it would be more convenient for the users.  

  

Please consider this request, when you revise the interface, next time.  

  

regards  
shankara

shankara
