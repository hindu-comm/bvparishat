Yes,i did wonder when you said he is Italian.

  

Mr. Jacob visited me thrice or four times in Vadodara and Ahmedabad in 2014 and 2015 too.

  

He has expressed his gratitude to me in glowing terms in his Thesis and said that he was inspired to work on this topic due to my guidance and preliminary work which I did some 30/35 years ago and created awareness and interest in the West about this game.

  

He completed his Thesis on Snakes and Ladders under the guidance of Prof.Zyks of his own department. The [prof.is](http://prof.is) working on Ayurveda and I arranged his lecture in Ahmedabad in 2015.

  

Jacob has done a wonderful work and he has sent his thesis to me after submitting it for the award.

  

Am happy that now he is working under your able guidance.
