Respected Prof . Wakankar,

Nice getting all the informationfrom you. You wrote :

“He completed his Thesis on Snakes and Ladders under the guidance of Prof.Zyks of his own department. The[prof.is](http://prof.is/)working on Ayurveda . “  

  

I think he is Prof. Zysk. We have in my department his book on stanzas from the Rigveda and subsequent explanation of Ayurveda, the exact name of the book, I am sorry, I cannot recollect right now.

Congratulations to Dr Jacob for the wonderful work doneand to you for the inspiration and guidance.

  

Regards,

Yours,

Soma Basu
