Prof.Paturi,

  

Namaskar.

  

May I know the name if that Italian scholar working in board games.

One scholar working in Chess met me in Wiesbaden in August 1997 during my talk there.I just forgot his name.He could be the same as you refer to.

  

Thanks and regards.

  

Prof.Siddharth Y.Wakankar
