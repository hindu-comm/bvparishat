**Abstract**:

  
It is a matter of great surprise that the most important part of our life viz. the games, especially indoor games that remove the laziness of our minds, did not get due attention from Sanskrit scholars. It was not considered to be a subject of serious research, as it did not figure in their traditional set of research topics. The unknown Sanskrit material, books as well as unpublished manuscripts, bearing on some of these games, should be brought to the notice of the interested, thereby throwing light on the social orientation of Sanskrit.  
  
With this idea in mind, unknown or little known Sanskrit material has been collected on three main indoor games,viz. Chaturanga (which turned into Chess or Buddhibala), Ganjipha (or Playing Cards) and Jnaneshvara's Mokshapata (now generally known as Snakes and Ladders). These were used to impart principles of *dharma/rājanīti* even via playing the game. The talk will discuss some Sanskrit texts dealing with the varieties of these games, also noting some of their peculiarities, and even their role vis-a-vis our day to day life.

  

It may be of interest to note that serious research interest is being evinced in many countries in respect of the last two games, also from
points of view as of museology and sociology; archaeology has some light to throw on the game of chess, too.
