Dear Subramanian Ji,

  

I verymuch like the line "Knowing that we Know the Rule... Without Knowing It...!" This is true of all languages. Native speakers learn and speak the languages without ever learning the languages from grammar books. As Patanjali says:घटेन कार्यं करिष्यन्कुम्भकारकुलंगत्वाआह - कुरु घटं कार्यमनेन करिष्यामि इति । न तद्वत् शब्दान् प्रयुयुक्षमाणः वैयाकरणकुलं गत्वा आह - कुरु शब्दान् प्रयोक्ष्ये इति । All grammars and their rules are after-the-fact results of an analytical examination of the data of language use. In English, the native speakers don't use grammar books to learn that the word "dogs" is pronounced as '*dogz*", while "books" is pronounced as "*buks*". It is the linguists who try to find out what is going on and why.
