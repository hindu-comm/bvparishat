We are teachers of English to the British !!  
  
"The Rule of Ablautreduplication"  
  
Why \`tock-tick' does not sound right to your ears?  
  
  
Ever wondered why we say :  
  
tick-tock, not tock-tick,  
  
or ding-dong,  
not dong ding;  
  
King Kong,  
not Kong King...?  
  
Turns out it is one of the unwritten rules of English that native speakers know without knowing!  
  
The rule, explains a BBC article, is:  
  
â€œIf there are three words then the order has to go...  
I, A, O.  
  
If there are two words then the first is I and the second is either A or O."  
  
Mish-mash,  
Chit-chat,  
Dilly-dally,  
hilly-shally ,  
Tip-top,  
Hip-hop,  
Flip-flop,  
Tic-tac,  
Sing-song,  
Ding-dong,  
King Kong,  
Ping-pong.â€œ  
  
There's another unwritten rule at work in the name Little Red Riding Hood, says the article.  
  
â€œAdjectives in English absolutely have to be in this order:  
  
Opinion - Size - Age -Shape - Colour -Origin - Material -Purpose - Noun.  
  
So you can have a lovely little old rectangular green French silver whittling knife.  
  
But if you mess with that word order in the slightest... you'll sound like a maniac.â€œ  
  
That explains why we say â€œlittle green menâ€œ not â€œgreen little men,â€œ  
  
But â€œBig Bad Wolf â€œ sounds like a gross violation of the â€œopinion (bad)-size (big) noun (wolf)â€œ order.  
  
It won't, though, if you recall the first rule about the I-A-O order...!!  
Got it..?  
  
That rule seems inviolable:  
  
â€œAll four of a horse's feet make exactly the same sound.  
  
But we always, always say clip-clop, never clop-clip.â€œ  
  
This rule even has a Technical Name...!  
If you care to Know it...  
  
ðŸ‘‡  
  
the Rule of Ablautreduplication!  
  
But then...  
Life is Simpler, Knowing that we Know the Rule... Without Knowing It...!
