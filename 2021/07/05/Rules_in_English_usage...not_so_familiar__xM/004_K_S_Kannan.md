Additional Notes:

The role of Ablaut Reduplication is somewhat consistent  

within languages like English, French and German.  

  

Vowels always move from front to back.  

E(as in email), I(igloo), A (as in apple), uh(as in umbrella),  

oh (as in auto) and oh(as in oatmeal). This is the prevailing theory  

behind the way reduplication works in English;  

however, its roots predate back some 2000 years.
