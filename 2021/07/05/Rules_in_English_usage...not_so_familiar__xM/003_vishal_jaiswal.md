Namaste Madhavji, the million dollar question is, can we replicate the same learning process for Sanskrit where the majority of concrete material primarily exists in the written form at a higher philosophical level ?

How does one soak in the highly inflective nature cum sandhis without resorting to mugging up declension and conjugation tables ?

  

I would appreciate your thoughts on this.

  

Thanks,

Vishal
