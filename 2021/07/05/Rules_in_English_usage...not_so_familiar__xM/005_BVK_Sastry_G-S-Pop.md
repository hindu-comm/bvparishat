Namaste



My thoughts:



1. On \< the million dollar question is, can we replicate the same learning process for Sanskrit where the majority of concrete material primarily exists in the written form at a higher philosophical level ?>



1.1: BVK Sastry (on- million dollar question) : Yes. This ‘pedagogic teaching- learning- practice’ model is called ‘Vedanga- Vak-Yoga- Sampradaya’.

Samskruth-Language Learning does not start with Grammar-analytics. Samskruth- Language-application does not end with conversation.



 The Vedanga-Vak-yoga’ tradition is still alive at some ‘Guru-Kuls’ in ‘coma state’;

This tradition is dismembered, disconnected, discarded, diluted and discredited widely in academia by preferring an alien model for ‘Samskruth – Language

study, like english’ .

The new trend is to design pathways of ‘ A.I –guided Mechanized Samskruth Instructor- translator’. Patanjali did caution on dangers of this approach in the

sentence ‘ Tvaritaa vaktaro bhavema’.

1.2: BVK Sastry (on-can we replicate): Yes. In Human mode with the existing pedagogic model. For the ‘Mechanized Model’, Lot more research and modelling is needed. 



1.3: BVK Sastry (on- same learning process): Yes. If we have understood the ‘human process-model of Panini-samskrutham as Vednaga’.

Vedas have provided primarily existing
concrete ‘Shabda- Raashi’ ( Word-Sentence –Stock).

Patanjali confirms ‘Vedat no vaidikaa shabdah; lokaat laukikaah’.



1.4: BVK Sastry (on- higher philosophical level): Yes. If we do not get confused between the Social and Spiritual purpose;

 If only we do not make a confusion between goal of Samskruth set as ‘Conversation – Computation- Communication- Cognition- Communion’.

The pedagogic models of learning-using Samskrutham for different goals as Language and application carry different pedagogies and linguistic Processes. 

The machine model replication of ‘Vedanga- Sanskrit –learning -teaching analytic-pedagogy’ in current state of computers – font art needs revisit/ re-thinking to be of

better use. This needs ‘Technologists help’ beyond build up over inappropriate foundation of language-modelling. 

The human model replication of ‘Vedanga- Sanskrit –learning -teaching analytic-pedagogy’ in current state of schooling needs revisit/ re-thinking to be of

better use. This needs ‘ Academic- Community help’, beyond lamenting.





What role vedangas play in Samskruth education? Vedanga’s provide the
total philosophical and spiritual vak-yoga-framework to replicate learning process for Sanskrit in a series of six stepped unified disciplines. The current available model works in the context of ‘Human Learning Process: Human Supervised- Human Intervention – Models with Voice Primary, Primacy and Supremacy guidance’.

This is open was open in history for every seeker to get the benefit of learning Samskrutham. The process can be replicated ; has a historic foot print for success through gurukul model, adapting the same learning process for Sanskrit, over millennia, to understand and benefit from the majority of concrete material primarily received by us / existing in the written form at a higher philosophical level.



Vedangas are connected integrally tied disciplines.

 - Starting with Shikshaa ( learning write Phonation) as Listen-Repeat –Validate Training (Ucchaarana- Anoocchaarana – Shravana- Grahana-Dharna- ).

- Enhanced with Chandas- Route Memorization and Voiced Repetion model of ‘ Prarthana- Sloka- Kavya- sukta-sukti’s

- Explained with ‘Vyakarana’ rules using ‘ Anvaya-krama to explain the ‘used -word-formation’ for comprehending communication and appreciation of

document-content for practical utility before ‘linguists technical analysis of pada-prakriyaa’, comes in.

-Validating the right usage, application and analytic frame work to be used as ‘Nirukta’: Semantics appropriate for context to explain the morphology. 

- Jyotisha and Kalpa are Vak-Yoga’ tools to engage with primary stock of existing concrete ‘Shabda- Raashi’ ( Sukta for Yajna in right time )



2. On \< How does one soak in the highly inflective nature cum sandhis without resorting to mugging up declension and conjugation tables ?>



BVK Sastry: ‘Soaking’ needs ‘Vak-Yogaanga guidance’; Another name
‘Vangmayam tapah’. Technique is ‘ Tat-Pada-Dhyaana’.

 Connected words: ‘avadhaana- dhyaana –saavadhaana’.: Focused one pointed meditative contemplation.

This is to experience ‘Aksharam Brahma Paramam’ (Gita:8-3) when the ‘Vishwa-roopa –aakruti’s of Shabda’s just unfold’.

Traditional guidance of Patanjali’s for ‘Vyakarana study to realize the highly inflective nature of Sandhi’s without resorting to mugging up and conjugation tables’ is ‘Practice of Vak-Yoga for ‘Shada-Roopa-Darshana’. The pedagogy of ‘Pada-shaastra- sutra-Prakriyaa -Shikshana’ aims to train learner to acquire skills of ‘ Shabda-Panditya and Shabda-Prayoga’ : Pedantic Scholarship needed to use right words for right benefit in right way for intended benefit; function as a teacher- preserver- and living practitioner of the higher
Philosophical Material = Vaidika Brahmana with anushthana. This is the essence of the statement : rakshaartham vedaanaam adhyeyam Vyakaranam.

If Vyakarana-Scholar falls short of this standard, they are still good as ‘ *shaabdika*: Scholars of text, language and tradition’, but they cannot meet Patanjali’s higher expectation set for ‘Vyakarana-Vedanga- Vak-yoga’; i.e. they cannot perform the role of practical utility deliverers as *Vaidika-Yaajnika*.
