Dear Aparna ji,

I am not very excited to write articles as I have to drastically

reduce the strain on my eyes.

I am doing,therefore, more videos than writing.

I can also hold one day discussion sessions on Google or Zoom.

I shall present some videos with titles on the subjects I mentioned.

Your kind cooperation and of others on these lists is solicited.

  

Svasti bhavatu,
