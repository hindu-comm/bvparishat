Dear Esteemed Scholars

and Thotapalli ji:

The problem is the guilt that

Hindus carry for being a harmonious and diverse society that succeed in creating all kinds of wealth not despite but because of polygamy, polytheism, strict danda niti, occasional sati, 8 kinds of marriage, legal prostitution and adhikaar bheda and above all a sense of social shame.

  

Since 19th century, we have

been intimidated by superiority of Christian monotheism, monogamy, anti ritualism, and

Enlightenment notions of commercial sameness masquerading as equality liberty and fraternity.

  

The West is crumbling under these values now, as it has not

been able to go beyond Abrahamic intolerance that keeps reinventing itself from Rousseau to Wokism.

  

Time that we undertake an honest reassertion of Shruti Smriti Shastra parampara which has been revitalising itself through ages to meet contemporary challenges.

  

How to stem the tide. Not by merely restating the ancient system but by altering the notions of modernity which are taken as essential world order.

  

Some suggestions:

1\. Save Democracy from Digitocracy.

2\. Voting age 30-75 (to revive

brahmacharya and other two

ashramas. Students and seniors

live in a mirage wasting their time.

Nobody with a criminal case or a heavy debt can contest or continue as

a legislator.

3\. Rethink on advertising rights,

morality and pornography.

4\. Teach more technical skills than theory in schools.

5\. Higher education under apprenticeship model.

6\. Extensive patronage to artists and artisans by people not only by State.

7\. Ensure purging of Socialism (now disguised as Gandhism by RSS and BJP) and Secularism (degenerated into creating and appeasing minorities of Abrahamic mindset).

8\. Reservations/ affirmative action on economic basis.

9\. Support to poor for medicine, education, vivah of their Jati brethren by rich jati members.

10\. Major reforms in judicial systems.

  

I have made some humble attempts by making videos on

Shastras and Smritis which can be seen on my YouTube channel.

Would love reactions and counters,

With deep regards,
