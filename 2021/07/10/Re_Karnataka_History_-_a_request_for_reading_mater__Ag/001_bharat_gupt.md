Dear Indrani ji,

I shall plan how to give these lectures to political classes.

It can only be given to some young people who aspire to

become social leaders. I have given several such lectures on some

forums, but much more is needed.

For the entrenched politicians you cannot dare advise them.

You can publicly admonish them, that is all.

Just did it last night, along with another speaker, will send video

regards,
