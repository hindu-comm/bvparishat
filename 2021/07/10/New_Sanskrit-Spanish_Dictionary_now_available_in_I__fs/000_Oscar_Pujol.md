I am happy to tell you that the Sanskrit-Spanish dictionaryis availablenow in India throughGoyal Publishers. This is a revised and updated version of the Sanskrit-Catalan dictionary. Much workhas been done to find the Spanish equivalents of Sanskrit botanical terms. Moreover the comparative etymology of Sanskrit words, mostly according to the work of M. Mayrhofer, and the Paninian derivations are given side by side.
