Dear Pradyumna ji,

  

Not only in the Puranas, but the same structure is also described in the Yogasutra (Vyasabhashya) , Sūtra 3.26 — **bhuvana-jñānaṁ sūrye saṁyamāt**

  

Please see Vyāsa-bhāṣya on that sūtra. This universe is only visible to the yogīs who have acquired saṁyama over sūrya-nāḍī. You can also refer to the comments on this sūtra by Sri Hariharananda Aranya.

  

sādhu-caraṇa-rajo'bhilāṣī,

  

hari pārṣada dāsa.
