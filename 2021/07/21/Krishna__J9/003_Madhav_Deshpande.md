Krishna

  

राधाया विरहेण तप्तहृदयो भ्राम्यन् वने माधव:

अन्विष्यन् गिरिकन्दरे प्रियतमां पृच्छन् मृगान् शाखिन: ।

सोऽपश्यद्यमुनाजले निजमुखं तत्राप्यसौ नेत्रयो:

स्वस्यैव प्रतिबिम्बितं यदुवरो हा धिक् प्रियाया मुखम् ।।

  

His heart scorched by separation from Radha

Wandering in the forest

Looking for her in the hills and caves

Asking the deer and the trees

He looked at his own face

In the water of Yamuna

And reflected in his own eyes

The best of the Yadus, Krishna,

Suddenly saw the face of his beloved
