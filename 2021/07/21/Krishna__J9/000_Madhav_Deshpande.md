Krishna!

  

सर्वे कामा भवेयुर्यदुवर तव संदर्शनेनैव तृप्ता:

प्राप्ते गेहं मदीयं त्वयि जनसुमनोनन्दने गोपबाले ।

इत्युत्कण्ठा मदीये हृदि सुचिरतरं वर्धते, त्वां प्रतीक्षे

आयाहि त्वं त्वरस्व क्षणमपि न सहे दूरतां ते मुकुन्द ।।

  

I just keep on thinking

All my hopes will be fulfilled

Just by looking at you

Jewel of the family of Yadus

Cowherd-child

Delight of the people of Vraja

As soon as you arrive at my home

The anxiety grows in my heart

For a very long time

I keep on waiting for you

O Krishna, come

Hasten!

I cannot bear you being away from me
