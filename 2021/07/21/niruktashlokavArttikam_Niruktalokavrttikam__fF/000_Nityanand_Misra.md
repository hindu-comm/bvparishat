Dear list members

  

I am looking for a digital or print edition of the Niruktaślokavārttikam (निरुक्तश्लोकवार्त्तिकम्). Its manuscript was discovered by Dr. C. Kunhan Raja and it was edited and published by Vijayapala in 1982. The editor is probably the same Vijayapala Vidyavaridhi who has produced a flawlessly edited edition of theMādhavīyā Dhātuvṛttiḥ.

  

An help is appreciated.

  

Nityānanda
