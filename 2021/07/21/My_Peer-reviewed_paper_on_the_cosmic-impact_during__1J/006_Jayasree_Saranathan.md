Dear DrRamesh Rao and Dr. Megh Kalyanasundaram,

  

Thanks Dr. Megh Kalyanasundaram for highlightingthe parts of Dr.Rao's mail whichI apparently missed reading.

Let me make a clarification here.

  

Academia.edu (Academia Letters) has a policy of not revealing the names of those who rejected a paper and their reviews as well. But I am given access to all the reviews and incorporate changes if I feel necessary. Only the positive reviews are published by them upon acceptance, after which the paper is kept open for three months for review by anyone - both positive and negative.

  

I exercised my prerogativeof making the rejecting reviews open for the public to give both sides of opinions - since this is a vital topic, validating the year of Mahabharata that was 35 years before Kali Yuga began.

As such Academia.edu cannot be faulted for the reviews.

  

The choiceof reviewers at the primary level comes from the references we quote. Mr. Seifert, whose paper was the basis of my paper, was one of the reviewers. There are two more working on meteor / comet impact theories who have been roped in to review and they are in touch with me now. Others are selected on the basis of key words matching with their papers.

  

It is good we come to know of different opinions but the decision is with the author whetherto give merit or not. The ones referred to by Dr. Rao and a few other reviews come under that category which I would anyway address in the open comment section on Academia Letters page for everyone to see.

  

Hope I clarified.

  

Regards,

jayasree
