I know my response included some rhetorical questions about standards for determining fact and fiction, and about dating conventions. Yes, there are accepted standards, but that the reviewers failed to identify standards that Dr. Saranathan'spaper did not meet is what is problematic. They have simply asserted without offering any evidence or explanation. Such reviewers are activists, ideologues, and do not deserve to be retained as reviewers.
