Yes, Dr. Saranathan, the blind peer review process ensures that we don't get to know who the reviewers are, just as the reviewers don't get to find out who has submitted the paper.

  

One of the papers that I recently submitted and which was rejected had a very similar comment about my political leanings: my paper was about the New York Times' coverage of Indian matters. Academic journals are now stackedwith the left/liberal/Marxist types, and they are ensuring that no paper challengingtheir versions of reality will get published.

  

The Journal of International Communication Research rejected my paper, but "China Media Research" published my paper... Ah, the irony...  

  

My point was simply to highlight the political nature of some of the reviewers' comments and the lack of rigor/discipline/care in their reviews.

  

Regards,

  

Ramesh
