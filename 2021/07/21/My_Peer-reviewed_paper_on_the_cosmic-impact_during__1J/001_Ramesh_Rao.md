Thank you Dr. Saranathan for sharing the reviews of your paper.

  

What I found distressing, even abominable, is the third reviewer's comment -- the one who sought to reject your paper. He/she says:

  

"“This is pseudoscience, commingling religious text with factual history. This is another push by the current Indian government to miseducate the masses.”

  

Where the heck did they figure out that Dr. Saranathan works at the behest of the present Indian government, and how the heck they call the Mahabharata "religious text". And what are the standards for putting their stamp on what is fact and what is fiction from the historical past?

  

I would suggest that as scholars each one of us should write to the editor of Academia Letters and ask whether such reviewers deserve to be consulted by the journal, and what, if any, reprimanding will be done for such crass, unscientific, political comments to be passed on as a review.

  

Reviewer #5 says -- "It claims dates for Mahabharata in 3100 BC which is too early by conventional standards" -- as if convention is writ in stone, and that one should blindly accept convention set and fortified by colonizers.

  

I wish we had the money and the talent to establish a clearing house/editorial offices that would help all of us submit papers for copyediting, proofreading, and citation help. There are academics and copy editors who can be hired to do such work, but it may be expensive for Indian scholars to submit work and pay for such services.
