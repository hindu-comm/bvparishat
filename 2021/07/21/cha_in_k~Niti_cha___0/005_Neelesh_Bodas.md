नमः सर्वेभ्यः ।

  

Let me first try to answer the question posted by OP - "Why have च in क्ङिति च". While no traditional commentaries talk about it in details, I remember reading (in one of the papers of Prof. Joshi and Prof. Bhate) that the च in क्ङिति च is used to indicate that "क्ङिति च" is a separate sutra. In absence of "च", the question could arise as to why not combine "क्ङिति" in the previous sutra, making it a single sutra as "न धातुलोप आर्धधातुके क्ङिति" that would possibly alter the meaning of the previous sutra.  
  
Coming to the observation done by Narayan ji and the apt reply from Nityanand ji, it looks like that Panini indeed never uses ग् as an इत्संज्ञक letter. This whole addition seems to be from the Bhashyakara, and while it is justifiable, it seems unnecessary. The problem is not at क्ङिति च at all, it is at ग्लाजिस्थश्च क्स्नुः । Having a कित् pratyay here would cause inappropriate ईकारादेश of स्था by घुमास्थागापाजहातिसां हलि. A simple way to avoid that was to provide a vartika "स्नोः कित्त्वे स्थ ईकारप्रतिषेधः" । And वार्त्तिककार indeed does that. The Bhashyakara, however, rejects the need of this vartika by modifying, not one, not two, but three sutras to solve the whole problem - ग्क्ङिति च instead of क्ङिति च, ग्लाजिस्थश्च ग्स्नुः instead of ग्लाजिस्थश्च क्स्नुः, and श्र्युकः ग्किति instead of श्र्युकः किति । The Bhashyakara justifies this change by saying that this was actually the original patha ("क्रियते न्यासे एव" in 3.2.129). However it is hard to agree to that because this modification causes more problems that it solves. First, श्र्युकः क्किति" will need to be changed to श्र्युको क्किति (The ग् will cause उत्व before the ग् becomes क् by चर्त्व) unless we opt-in for a पाठ without संहिता (Which is questionable to start with - Where at other places in ashtadhyayi such a पाठ is seen?). Secondly, the derivation of क्ङिति च that has been pointed by Nityanand ji appears very clever but possibly incorrect. In the initial state of "ग् क् ङ्", we have a simultaneous application of खरि च and यरोऽनुनासिकेऽनुनासिको वा, and I'd assume यरोऽनुनासिकेऽनुनासिको वा will take precedence as it fails to accept the presence of खरि च. Once क् becomes ङ्, then we cannot do चर्त्व, thereby further unable to justify the "क्ङिति च" as the form.  
  
In summary, I tend to agree with Narayan ji that Panini did not really intend to have a इत्संज्ञक ग् anywhere in Ashtadhyayi. However I am also aware that today, the unanimously accepted patha is "गकारोऽपि चर्त्वभूतो निर्दिश्यते" ।
