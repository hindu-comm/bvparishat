Dear friends.

  

What does Panini want to tell by the sutra क्ङितिच ?

  

The general view is that he wants to indicate the pratyayas कित् and ङित् .

  

The opinion is that while pronating the sutra it is heard as ग्ङिति च instead of क्ङिति च.

  

The phonetic answer is that the pratyayas are of क class i.e. they are pharyngeal. Being so the back of the tongue cannot capture क् and ङ् in संयोगा form because they are too far away.

  

Just as we use a stick to reach out to a mango when our hands cannot reach them or we pull the branch to reach the mango, in the same way the ग् takes the place of the stick which is used to draw the mango.

  

Thus it would be prudent to write it as ग्ङिति च rather than क्ङिति च when the person reading it knows that there is no ग्ङित् pratyaya in Sanskrit.

  

If there exists a sutra to the effect in the Ashtadhyayi so far so good or we will have to make one to say that while making a Sutra if two or more consonants are joined in संयोगा and being far away the letters cannot be so phonated within the framework of the Mahesh war Sutras than the one near will be phonated in its place.

  

Once the purpose of the Sutra is clear no further wrangling is necessary

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
