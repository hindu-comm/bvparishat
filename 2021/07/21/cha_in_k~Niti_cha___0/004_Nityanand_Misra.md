Narayana Prasad Mahodaya

  

Do you agree with the Mahābhāṣya position or not? If not, why?

  

Ujjvala Mahodaya

  

Please see the attached images. Sudarśanadevācārya argues in his commentary on Aṣṭādhyāyī 1.1.5 that the form क्क्ङिति च \[optionally\] results in क्ङिति च by यरोऽनुनासिकेऽनुनासिको वा (8.4.45) and हलो यमां यमि लोपः (8.4.64). His argument seems correct to me, except that he has not specified the optionality part. Ramānātha Śarmā also says this. If this is the case, then both क्क्ङिति च and क्ङिति च (and also क्ङ्ङिति) are correct even if we assume गित् is implied in 1.1.5.
