Dear Prof. Deshpande,  
  
This reminded me of another charming translation - Alfred Tennyson's *Home they Brought her Warrior Dead*, translated some decades ago into Sanskrit verse by Shri Vasant Nanivadekar, and shared by his relative on the Sanskrit Documents website (see below - I took the liberty of fixing some scanning/ transliteration errors). He was perhaps one generation earlier to yours and lived in Mumbai. He passed away a few years ago. I wonder if you might know anything about him or his other compositions/ translations? He appears to have been prolific, but nothing was preserved.

  
Regards,

गेहानीतेऽप्यसुविरहितेवीरसिंहे स्वनाथे 

मोहं प्राप्तान च न च सखी क्रन्दितुं वा प्रवृत्ता ।

पश्यन् देवींपरिजनइदं प्राह मर्माहतां तां  

नो चेद् रुद्यात् इयमपि भवेत् प्राणहीनाचिरेण ॥

  

Home they brought her warrior dead

She nor swooned nor uttered cry

All her maidens watching said

She must weep or she will die.

  

लोकैर्मन्दं विनतहृदयैः संस्तुतो वीर एवं

स्नेहस्यासीत् खलु नरवरो भाजनं श्लाघनीयम् ।

संहार्दं वा नरतनुधरं शत्रुरौदार्यमूर्तिः

नोचे किङ्चित् तदपि किल सा नाल्पमात्रं चचाल ॥

  

Then they praised him soft and low

Called him worthy to be loved

Truest friend and noblest foe

Yet she neither spoke, nor moved.

  

स्वीयस्थानात्तदनु शनकैः कापि दासी तदानीं

प्राप्ता वीरं निभृतगमना कानि गत्वा पदानि

दूरीचक्रे नरवर मुखाच्छादि वस्त्रं कराभ्यां

किङ्चिन्मात्रं न हि विचलिता नापि वा सा रुरोद ॥

  

Stole a maiden from her place

Lightly to the warrior stept

Took the face cloth from the face

Yet she neither moved, nor wept.

  

काचिद् वृद्धा नवतिशरदां दीर्घमायुर्दधाना 

क्रोडे तस्याः प्रियतमशिशुं स्थापयामास धात्री

ग्रीष्मे वृष्टिं जलद इव सा बाष्पपूरं मुमोच

जात, प्राणांस्तव खलु कृते धारयामीत्युवाच !

  

Rose a nurse of ninety years

Set his child upon her knee

Like summer tempest came her tears

Sweet my child, I live for thee !
