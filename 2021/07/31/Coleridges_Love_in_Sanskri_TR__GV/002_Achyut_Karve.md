Dear friends,

  

Here is the other side of the story. The poem has been composed by my granddaughter aged 14 years.

  

"The Princess and her Knight

  

She lay in the comforts of her keep,

Thinking ‘bout her knight

She wished to see him swing his sword,

But he was off to fight.

He was so gallant and so skilled,

And so fine did he joust

He fought like he was on the edge of a knife

But fierce as a dragon roused.

She knew that she won’t have her knight

With a prince she’d wear a crown,

All she wanted was a knight

On that thought she did frown.

She sat near window pale as chalk

Staring at the gate,

She did fret that he would die,

And could do none but wait."

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
