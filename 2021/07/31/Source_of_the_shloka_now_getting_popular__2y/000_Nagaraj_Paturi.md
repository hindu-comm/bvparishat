I request the experts on Ayurvedic textual sources to help with the source of the shloka

  

*देहे सर्वत्र चोष्णस्य समता लाघवं सुखम् ।*

*क्षुत् तीक्ष्णा गाढ़निद्रा च मनसोऽपि प्रसन्नता ॥*

*शरीरे कर्मसामर्थ्य अनालस्यं च कर्मसु ।*

*स्वतःस्वेदोगमःकाले स्वस्थतांलक्षयन्ति हि ॥*

which is now being shared on the internet in the context of immunity check during pandemic conditions.

Some are trying to compare this with Immunity Status Questionnaire (ISQ) of modern medicine.

Some think that this shloka is of a recent history.
