Respected Sri Chamu Krishna Shastry-ji's idea seems to have two arguments :  

  

1\. Translations **from** Sanskrit have been done enough. No further need.

  

2\. As long as translations from Sanskrit keep happening, people are not compelled to go to Sanskrit sources. This is to the detriment of Sanskrit.

  

I respectfully disagree.

  

As you rightly pointed out , translations from any source language to any target language never to the detriment of any source language.

  

#2 has an underlying assumption that there is a great urge to approach original Sanskrit sources among the general public and people are losing that motivation because of the availability of translations.

  

But it is a fact of life that there is not such a big urge to approach original Sanskrit sources. The general situation in any society is always like that. Not everyone would and should be interested in approaching texts, leave alone Sanskrit texts. That is why I keep saying that the whole argument of Sanskrit being denied to certain sections of the Indian society is a hoax. (It is a different matter that some of us who get fascinated by the work in Sanskrit by the western scholars while quoting Shastric sources that appear to prohibit Sanskrit to certain sections of Indian society, proudly announce the study of Sanskrit or Shaastras by a Sanskrit scholar in their religious institution while taking equal pride in certain sections of Indian society not (being allowed to) studying in their institute. Question of denying comes only when one is denied a thing that one asked for. (Denying to teach Sanskrit to certain sections of Indian society while laying red carpet to western scholars/students in the same institute certainly is a discriminatory /exclusionary denial) But general tendency in general society is not being interested in textual sources , leave alone Sanskrit sources. So translations from Sanskrit coming in the way of the motivation of the general public to Sanskrit sources is not a valid argument.

  

Then the argument could be that translations from Sanskrit are coming in the way of the motivation of not the general public but of the scholars / students that might be in need of Sanskrit sourcesor otherwise would have been motivated to study the original Sanskrit sources.

  

It is in fact laudable that Samskritabharati and other such organizations, mainly Sanskritabharati have done a yeoman'sservice by spreading access to Sanskrit with an unimaginable scale. (to continue the hoax of denial of Sanskrit even after such a humongous access to Sanskrit and Sanskrit studies during contemporary times through governmental and nongovernmental efforts is certainly part of shenanigans. )

  

But that this has reached a level where everyone seeking to approach Sanskrit sources is now facilitated with that ability is not correct.

  

Translations from Sanskrit are still needed for many.

  

That space of necessity can not be , again, left to the inefficient or the shenanigans.

  

That is the reason why Indic Academy has taken up the translations program under the banner of Indica Classical Library.
