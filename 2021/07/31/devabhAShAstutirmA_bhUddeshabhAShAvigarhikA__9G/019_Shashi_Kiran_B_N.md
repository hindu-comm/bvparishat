Dear Prof. Paturi-ji,

  

Thank you for posting Sri Chamu Krishna Shastri-ji's view here. I had sent my *pratispanda* to him and he had opined the same.

  

Specifically, one sentence of Shastri-ji's article did not resonate well with me -- "Translation from Samskrit language to other languages has become a great obstruction to the development of Samskrit language."

  

You stated your views on this in your initialemail. Thank you for that.

  

To reiterate my position: I am all for translating works into Sanskrit and writing orginiail works in it. I have been doing it myself. But Sri Shastri-ji's stand, taken to its logical extremity, leads to certain repercussions not exactly favourable to either our culture or Sanskrit. Among other things, the objective of my rejoinder was to draw attention to this aspect.

  

I have nothing more to add.

  

Thank you.

  

Best regards,

Shashi Kiran B N
