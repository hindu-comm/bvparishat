I had a conversation with respected Chamu Krishna Shastry-ji regarding this.

  

He thinks his blogpost is misunderstood.

  

His intention is basically to enrich Sanskrit with contemporaryor contemporaneous expression, either through translation from English and /or regional Indian languages or through independent writing of contemporary stuff directlyin Sanskrit that incorporates contemporary advancements in thought, sciences and technologies etc.

  

'Sanskrit being reserved for traditional discourse limits its progress' is his view.

  

One of the ways in which such progress can happen in Sanskrit, according to him, is through translations INTO (rather than FROM) Sanskrit.
