Sri Chamu-ji's emphasis is also with regard to Sanskrit language teaching too.

  

He emphasizes teaching Sanskrit through Sanskrit, not through translation of Sanskrit into other languages.

  

In technical terms what he insists on is called Direct method inthebranch of Applied Linguistics called Language Teaching.

  

Grammar Translation method is the name used for the method of languageteaching where the teacher uses translation of the language taught into the lingua franca of the teacher and the learner or the mother tongue of the learner.

  

Nowadays all over the world, Grammar Translation method is taking back seat and Direct Method is gaining greater and greater currency.

  

Though he does not use these technical terms of Applied Linguistics, Sri Chamu-ji says in his blogpostthat all foreignlanguage teachers too are teaching those languages through those languages only, why not do that for Sanskrit.

  

This is another context in which he opposes translation from Sanskrit.

  

In this case, his argument is well in line with the current trend in the Language Teaching area of Applied Linguistics.
