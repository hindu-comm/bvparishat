सर्वेभ्यो नमः।

  

Thanks to everyone who shared their valuable thoughts on this thread. Prof. Paturi, I am particularly grateful to you for your analysis of the issue from multiple viewpoints. I thank you not merely for bolstering my argument but for showing the right way forward by adopting a well-rounded approach.  

  

A couple of clarifications:

  

1\. I agree that the quantum of works translated into Sanskrit is meagre in comparison to those translated from it. I am wholly in support of translating works into Sanskrit -- just not at the cost of disregarding *deśa-bhāṣa*s. (An original work of unignorable merit shores up the language and commands attention like nothing else; but that is beyond the point.)  

  

2\. The focus here is on translations done in *deśa-bhāṣa*s and not English, as some scholars seem to think.  

  

3\. The crux of the issue, as I see it, is this -- Today, concerted efforts are being made to delink Sanskrit and *deśa-bhāṣa*s. Kannada, my mother tongue, is being "cleansed" to "free it" from words and thoughts embedded in Sanskrit. Many states including but not restricted to Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra are facing similar issues. In this context it is inadvisable to make an island of Sanskrit, which, in a manner of speaking, issues only an entry-only visa. Ignoring this will in all likelihood lead to unsavoury long-term repercussions.  

  

It might be argued that the premise of Sri Chamu Krishna Shastri-ji's article is different. I wrote the rejoinder bearing in mind the gravitas of the issue, intending to draw attention to several other key facets.

  

With best regards,

Shashi Kiran B N
