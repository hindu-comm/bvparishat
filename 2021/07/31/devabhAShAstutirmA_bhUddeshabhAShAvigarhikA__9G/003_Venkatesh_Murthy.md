Namaste  

  

Though many translations from Sanskrit are available there is also a counter awareness in intelligent people to recognize the limitations of translations. Seeing translations like Wolf Belly for Bhima and Monkey God for Hanuman the intelligent people will try to read and understand textsin original Sanskrit language. Much information is lost in translation and the awareness of this is there already. There will not be a dearth of people wanting to read original texts.
