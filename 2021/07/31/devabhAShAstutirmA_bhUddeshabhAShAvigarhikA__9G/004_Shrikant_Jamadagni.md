The entire argument of Shri Chamu Krishna Shastri is that one should lean Sanskrit so that one can read Sanskrit literature in the original. I believe this is a strong argument as translations cannot avoid interpretation. Besides there is the joy of sound of reading and listening Sanskrit. All of this is defeated by translations. Hence his opposition to translation

  

Actually more importantly Shri Shastri and Samskrita Bharati is keen on spread of Sanskrit as a language in active use i.e., to increase the number of Sanskrit speakers. What motivation is left for a person to learn Sanskrit if the information is readily available in one's mother tongue?
