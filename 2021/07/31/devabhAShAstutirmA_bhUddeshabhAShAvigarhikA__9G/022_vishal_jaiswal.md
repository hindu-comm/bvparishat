"When it comes to shastras like yoga or ayurveda or vedanta, faithful translations exist in some modern Indian languages today, such that one need not access the original directly at all for serious studies in the same".

  

How true is this statement and to what degree ?

  

Framing the same sentence slightly differently, why strive for samskrita fluency to directly access these domains, if such faithful translations exist ?

For the emotional satisfaction ?

If there is any loss via translation, please enumerate.

  

Also regarding translation, isn't it possible that someone well versed in vedanta rather than yoga could interpret the yoga texts from a vedantic perspective/bias knowingly or unknowingly and translate accordingly ?

  

Please note that my question is strictly about darshanas and shastras, and not kaavya.

  

I hope to hear various views on this.

  

Thanks,

Vishal
