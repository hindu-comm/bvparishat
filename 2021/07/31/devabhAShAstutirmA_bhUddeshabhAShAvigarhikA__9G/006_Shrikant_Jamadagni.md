I agree that modern tech needs to be employed in better ways to take to Sanskrit to the people.

  

But there is really no barrier. For example, Samskrita Bharati's 4-level course is available to all at practically zero cost. There are other avenues also. What is lacking among people is the will and the wisdom.

  

In the past 15 years many adults have approached me with "interest" in Sanskrit. The "interest" lasts about a month. Maybe i am a bad teacher! who knows?
