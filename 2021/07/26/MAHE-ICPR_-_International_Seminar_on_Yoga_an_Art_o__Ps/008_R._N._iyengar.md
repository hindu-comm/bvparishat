Dear Dr. Ganesh

Thanks for seconding my views on uncalled for distortion of Sanskrit words and usages internalized by Indian culture for millennia.

Your observation that this appears to be a mischievous fad of western writers in recent times is also largely true. This may be due to a mental preconditioning

that there should be unique meanings to Sanskrit technical words as it might be the practice in the daily use of their languages. In such situations, the nuances

and the 'greater meanings' as you have noted get lost in lexical banality.

  

with kind regards
