Dear prof. R. N. Iyengar Sir,

  

Yes, I do see a point in your objection. Many times me too have found such nauseating translations being done in the name of understandability. Sometimes it appears to be a mischievous fad of the Western scholars of recent decades. Even the titles of Sanskrit classics are badly and baldly translated and this has eventually destroyed the suggestivity and dignity of those names as these translations are blind and indifferent to their original cultural ethos. For example kaavyaadarsha of Dandi is translated as mirror of poetics where the other implied/suggested and greater meaning of aadarsha (ideal) is the lost. Such examples are numerous.

  

  

With warm regards

  

Ganesh
