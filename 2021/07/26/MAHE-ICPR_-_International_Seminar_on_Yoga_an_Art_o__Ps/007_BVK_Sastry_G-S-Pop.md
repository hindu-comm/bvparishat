Namaste



Here are snippets from on-line Translation for ‘moral rain cloud assessment’, and ‘Daasa Saahitya’.

Hope this provides some inputs for review on ‘Samskruth Language Modelling in Techno-Linguistic analysis’ .



What are M.T / A.I - Techno-Linguists missing which ‘ Human Mind’
constructs ?

Human Language- Meaning Process Modelling in Machine Translation systems –pedagogy is short scaled in heavily depending on ‘ lexicon –data base’ approach.

The outcome of meaning offsets in MT/ AI ( and dependent computational linguistics) will increase exponentially when non-english like Indic language’s ( more so Panini Language) continue to be sliced and diced using ‘ anglicised model of Panini-language –grammar rules’.
