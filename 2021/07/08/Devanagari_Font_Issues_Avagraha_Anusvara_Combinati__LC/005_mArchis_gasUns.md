Harfbuzz renders the sequence ऽं correctly, but Microsoft shaping engine has a restriction.

The sequences are rare in Devanagari as there are very few words starting with अं like अंस, अंश, अंशु (अंशुमान् अंशुमती अंशुमाली etc.), अंशुक,अंह, अंहतिः etc

  

Thanks for such a detail. The technical manual I've read. I need a person who can fix it in the font, not to tell me to do that ))
