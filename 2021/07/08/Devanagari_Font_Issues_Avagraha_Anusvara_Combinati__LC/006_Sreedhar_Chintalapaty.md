HiMārcis,

  

A suggestion/request if I may, based on my experience trying to design sa-svara mantra books that use both dEvanAgari and IAST: please enable the use of accents for IAST as well; move the udAtta further downand svarita further up to accommodate the dots and lines in IAST.

  

Attached is an example of what I mean -- no matter which font I used, font-supplied udAtta and svarita signs hadlegibility issues with IAST. As a result, I ended up creating separate line objects that moving them around to (approximately) the right place.

Best Regards,

Sreedhar
