Namaste,

Yo may go through this document of mine which was posted recently.

<http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2021/21113-avagraha.pdf>

Harfbuzz renders the sequence ऽं correctly, but Microsoft shaping engine has a restriction.

The sequences are rare in Devanagari as there are very few words starting with अं like अंस, अंश, अंशु (अंशुमान् अंशुमती अंशुमाली etc.), अंशुक,अंह, अंहतिः etc

Regards,

Sridatta A
