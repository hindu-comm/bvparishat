विद्वद्भ्यः सादरप्रणामाः।

  

The **Centre for Avadhanam**, a joint initiative of **Chinmaya Vishwavidyapeeth** and **Indic Academy,** is delighted to announce an **Online National Workshop on Rāsikya: Appreciating Classical Poetry,** coming up in the month of August, **(Aug 11-20, 2021)**,

This workshop will introduce participants to the ingredients that go into the making of a flavourful Sanskrit poem, such as metres, figures of speech, elements of grammar, recurring motifs, poetic conventions, and the foundational texts of Indian culture. It will equip the attendees to savour any classical Sanskrit poem that they might lay their hands on.

It is our fortune that the versatile poet and esteemed scholar, **Śatāvadhānī Dr. R Ganesh**, has consented to be the resource person for this workshop. We will also be having amongst us Sri **Shashikiran BN**, an erudite scholar himself, as a resource person, in addition to being one of the coordinators.

**Last date to register - August 05, 2021.**  

Please find attached the flyer, and click on the link below to know more about the workshop.

Warm Regards,
