Dear Madam,

  

Thanks for this update.

  

I hope,you mean रसिकता,when you use the word रासिक्य. Why use a difficult word when a simpler and more common word is available.

  

This tendency of majority of Sanskrit scholars using difficult words is,so to say,a main reason why general public goes away from Sanskrit,thinking it difficult to understand.

  

I do not desire to hurt the feelings of any scholars,but,it will be better if we use simpler language to attract students.

  

तद्धितप्रियाः दाक्षिणात्याः seems to be still lurking in our minds.

  

Best wishes for this endeavour.

  

Kind regards.
