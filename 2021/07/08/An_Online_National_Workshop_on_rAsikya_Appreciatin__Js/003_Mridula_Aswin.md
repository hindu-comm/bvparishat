आदरणीयाः मदाभागाः,

नमो नमः।

I agree with what you have expressed about ensuring wider reach of Sanskrit. As you said, we can use रसिकता or रसिकत्वम् too in the sense of रासिक्यम्, yet we chose the latter, because, among the तद्धितप्रत्ययs that denote भाव, ष्यञ् when used, is more pleasing to listen and endows तदन्त with माधुर्य. Moreover, we have also given the appendage in the title - 'Appreciating Classical Poetry', and anyone unfamiliar with the word रासिक्य is bound to grasp the meaning. This way, people get to acquaint themselves with new words. If academic institutions themselves do not promote rarer vocabulary in Sanskrit, then over time, such usages will be relegated to the texts, and might one day become like ऊष, तेर, पेच etc. ('अस्त्यप्रयुक्तः' - वा.पस्पशा. महाभाष्यम्). Apart from that, we run the risk of classical literature of say a poet like Kalidasa, and treatises on शास्त्र (like the Mahabhashyam) not being understood by the common reader of Sanskrit without the aid of कोष-s. By such efforts, we do not expect everyone to be a प्रौढसंस्कृतभाषी, but to promote सहजसंस्कृतभाषी-s.  

  

Using unfamiliar words alongside familiar words in conversation or regular writing would help the listener or reader to add to his vocabulary

(शक्तिग्रहं व्याकरणोपमानकोशाप्तवाक्याद् व्यवहारतश्च।वाक्यस्य शेषाद् विवृत्तेर्वदन्ति **सान्निध्यतः सिद्धपदस्य** वृद्धाः॥). After all, when we support this idea in other modern languages, why not extend it to Sanskrit?
