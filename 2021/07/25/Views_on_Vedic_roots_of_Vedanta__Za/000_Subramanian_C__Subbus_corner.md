Dear all,

  

I know there have been many foreign and Indian scholars favoring 'Non-vedic roots of Upanishadic ideas/ Vedanta' i.e. the messages and ideas of the Upanishads like immortality, rebirth, etc are first thought of in Upanishads and not seen in Samhita or Brahmana portion

  

There are also many authorswho have refuted this with strong evidence

  

Can you share references of both of theabove?

  

Regards,  
Subramanian Chidambaran
