Seems to merit its own thread, rather than this one. But responding with a gross view anyway.  
  
saMskAra in bhAShA has many aspects - pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary, idioms ... The idea that this saMskAra should increase is definitely a good one. But the idea that these improvements in saMskAara are sequential - first shixA, then vyAkaraNa etc.. is not practical, and is anyway suboptimal. It may be natural for some people to know yaN sandhi long before the figure out/ decide how to say visarga.

  

Just a strong determination that saMskAra in one's language should increase is sufficient. And saMskAra improvement may span generations.
