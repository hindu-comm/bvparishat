Dear Friends,

  

As all are aware I am a student of the tabla. The tradition has a vast collection of compositions. With the popularization of modern education there started a change in the lingual makeup of the shisthas among the tabla shisthas. This led to a paradigm shift in the prayatna while leading to substitution of certain letters of the compositions thus corrupting the tradition. As on date the classical tradition is totally broken and we see that in various regions various tabla dialects have emerged.

  

My and my Guriji's effort was to preserve the tradition in written form. It was here that we started facing problems of short and long vowels and marking udatta and anudatta swaras.

  

This task was difficult

1\) because short and long vowels have become inconsequential in speech.

2\) There is no instruction in udatta anudatta swaras in formal teaching.

  

Thus establishing a shiksha patha was essential if the tradition had to be preserved. In the absence of a shiksha patha it would merely be wishful thinking as the compositions would be preserved only in letter and not in spirit.

  

The written compositions help to preserve the tradition only in the presence of a detailed shiksha patha.

  

Would Panini not have seen the futility of the Ashtadhyayi in the absence of a robust shiksha patha?

  

Surely, he must have realised it. And could a shiksha patha be more concise than the Mahesh war Sutras?

  

The problem with learning Sanskrit is getting the pronunciation. All are aware that nearly 40 to 50 percent of children below the age of 11 cannot read or write formallanguages. This is the case with both vernacular languages as well as English.

  

Socially Sanskrit is not a spoken language and hence a child being introduced to Sanskrit does not have an experience of listening to spoken Sanskrit. Children pick up languages through listening.
Sanskrit being a language of Shisthas has a unique phonetic signature..
For example unless one is uniquely instructed in appreciating the vocal signatures of the Classical Tabla one cannot interpret what is being played. Similar is the case with North Indian Classical Music.

  

It is thus clear that the reason why children do not take up Sanskrit after 10th Std. is that they cannot read, write and speak Sanskrit.
Lakhs of students pass 10th Std. with Sanskrit as their 3rd language and yet a miniscule number alone take it as a subject at the Graduation level.

  

Take my example. Being a child brought up in an English environment my father attempted to tutor me in Sanskrit when I was in 5th Std.
However, though the teacher was learned, he could not teach a child and so the experiment failed miserably. I had taken Sanskrit as a third language in 8th, hereto it was a repeat of what happened when I was a ten year old because the teacher only asked us to commit to memory declensions of nouns and verbs. Can a student even understand the unique word form that a word takes in Sanskrit in the absence of being taught the grammar of the language through which he is being instructed? Are cases ever taught in English grammar leave alone teaching their usage in vernacular languages. It took me a good 20 years to understand cases but not before my daughter was in 8th standard studying Sanskrit.

  

There are two things that I wish to point out. 1) the phonetic aspect of Sanskrit should be rehearsed and should not be taken for granted before the child is introduced to Sanskrit . 2) The child should be taught the grammar of the language through which he is taught Sanskrit. It is only then that Sanskrit can get any lease of life.

  

What I find with those well-versed in Sanskrit is their inability to teach children which they think is left to teachers in schools.

  

If one is serious about reviving Sanskrit one needs to go back to the basics, i.e., Shiksha.

  

Today Scientists make a living by becoming handmaids of Industry and linguists and social scientists make a living by becoming handmaids of Universities whose curriculum is dictated by politicians.

  

Sanskrit has to come out of this rut if it has to get a lease of life.
It is not just a question of translations.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
