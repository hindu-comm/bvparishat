Dear Prof Deshpande,

Nice poem.  

I have heard of a similar story where Guha says to Sri Rama to carefully place his lotus feet on his boat. He was concerned about losing his livelihood if his boat turned into a damsel just like what happened with Ahalya at the mere touch of His lotus feet.

I am still a beginner and can't write in Sanskrit.
