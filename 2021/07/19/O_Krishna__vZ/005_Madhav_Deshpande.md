O Krishna!

  

कृष्ण त्वदीयचरणाम्बुजधूलिरागात्

पुष्पत्वमेति सहसैव मृदां चयोऽपि ।।

आयाहि मे मनसि ते चरणद्वयस्य

स्पर्शेन मां विमलतां नय सुध्युपास्य ।।

  

O Krishna, by the touch of the dust of your lotus feet, even a clod of earth instantly turns into a flower. Worshipped by the wise! appear in my heart and cleanse me by the touch of your feet.
