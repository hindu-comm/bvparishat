O Krishna!

  

अङ्गानि मे गलिततामनिशं प्रयान्ति

शीर्षं पुरैव पलितं वलितं मुखं च ।

कालोऽखिलं च सकलं कवलीकरोति

कृष्ण त्वमेव शरणं मम सुध्युपास्य ।।

  

Limbs are constantly falling apart

The head is already gray

The face has crinkles

Time is devouring everything

O Krishna, worshipped by the wise,

You are my only refuge.
