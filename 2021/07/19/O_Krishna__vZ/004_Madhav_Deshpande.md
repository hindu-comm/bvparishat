O Krishna!

  

कृष्ण त्वया मनसि मे विशता कृतं किम्

अन्त: प्रविश्य महसा तव पूरितोऽहम् ।

प्रागागमात्तव यदूत्तम यन्ममाभूत्

सर्वं तवैव तदभूदयि सुध्युपास्य ।।

  

O Krishna, what have you done by entering my mind?

You entered and filled me with your illumination.

O best of the Yadus worshipped by the wise,

Whatever I thought was mine before your arrival

It all turned out to be yours.
