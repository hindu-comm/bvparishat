Namaste



There has been a kind of ‘mystic aura’ used to bring home the importance of ‘ Authentic – pronunciation –of- Samskruth (Brahmi)- Varna-aksharas’ ; and the ‘authenticity for benefit of right pronunciation’ is vested in ‘Vedas and Vedanga / Vyakarana and Nirukta.

The classic illustration is ‘ yathendrashatruh svartoparadhat’ ; he-arayah / he-alayah’. 



Here is some thing , sounding similar on ‘right way of pronunciation of a specific term’ as a ‘ community identity passcode’ coming from Old Testament’. **The term is ‘shibboleth’**. \[[Shibboleth - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth)
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth> \].



The term originates from the[Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language "Hebrew language")word*shibbólet*(שִׁבֹּלֶת‎), which means the part of a plant containing[grain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain "Grain"), such as[the head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear_(botany) "Ear (botany)")of a stalk of[wheat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat "Wheat")or[rye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rye "Rye");^([\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth#cite_note-6)[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth#cite_note-7)[\[Isaiah 27:12\]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+27%3A12&version=NRSV))or less commonly (but arguably more appositely)^([\[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth#cite_note-Speiser-8))"flood, torrent".^([\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth#cite_note-9)[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth#cite_note-10))

The modern use derives from an account in the[Hebrew Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible "Hebrew Bible"), in which pronunciation of this word was used to distinguish[Ephraimites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe_of_Ephraim "Tribe of Ephraim"), whose dialect used a differently sounding first consonant. The difference concerns the Hebrew letter*[shin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_(letter) "Shin (letter)")*, which is now pronounced as\[ʃ\](as in*[shoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_postalveolar_fricative "Voiceless postalveolar fricative")*).^([\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth#cite_note-HessBlock2016-11))In the[Book of Judges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Judges "Book of Judges"), chapter 12, after the inhabitants of[Gilead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilead "Gilead")under the command of[Jephthah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jephthah "Jephthah")inflicted a military defeat upon the invading[tribe of Ephraim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe_of_Ephraim "Tribe of Ephraim")(around 1370–1070 BC), the surviving Ephraimites tried to cross the[River Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_River "Jordan River")back into their home territory, but the Gileadites secured the river's fords to stop them. To identify and kill these Ephraimites, the Gileadites told each suspected survivor to say the word*shibboleth*. The Ephraimite dialect resulted in a pronunciation that, to Gileadites, sounded like*sibboleth*.^([\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth#cite_note-HessBlock2016-11))In the[King James Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_James_Bible "King James Bible")^([\[Judges 12:5-6\]](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges+12%3A5-6&version=KJV))the anecdote appears thus (with the word already in its current English spelling):

And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;  
Then said they unto him, **Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan:** and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.

— *[Judges 12:5-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges+12%3A5-6&version=KJV)*



Such ‘ voiced language –terms insignia (= pada- vakya –uccharana / prayoga)’ for identifying the unique community, teaching schools and masters , ‘veda-instructional-pedagogy, mantra-usage, community samskara- pooja-patha-paddhati’ are integral part of ‘ Samskruth –Social- Usage- Diversity’, which is difficult to script in English characters / document ! Kerala has many shades of same language usage which is used to distinguish the ‘ local origin and nativity of speaker’. ( Panini has some pointers to such local usage and included it as a part of grammar discourse : ….kambhojeshveva….. \].
