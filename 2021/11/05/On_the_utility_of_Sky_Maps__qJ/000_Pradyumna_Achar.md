Respected list members,

  

There are several instances where ancient texts mention the positions of various celestial bodies at the date and time of the events that they describe.

  

There is a line of thought that these texts are literary fiction, and the dates and times mentioned therein ought to be treated as fictional. They come in the same category as J.K. Rowling mentioning that Harry Potter was born on 31st July 1980, which is purely fictional, as we know that the author has herself declared the character and the story to be fiction.

  

However, if we suppose that there is a text that is not known to be fact or fiction, say a detective mystery novel, and it mentions the bank account numbers and internet banking passwords of a famous personality. In case that the account number and password turns out to be correct, we do not believe that the author randomly imagined some account number and password for his fiction that turned out, by mere coincidence, to be true. We would consider that the author knew the fact and wrote the fact.

  

The sky is large and complex. The relative positions of celestial bodies therein changes rapidly and in a complex manner. Only recently, with advances in physics and astronomy and the availability of computational power, we are able to calculate the positions of the these bodies at dates and times that are several hundreds and thousands of years old.

  

Given this, if a text that is not known to be a fact or fiction states the positions of celestial bodies as seen at some date and time that is purportedly 1000 or 2000 years ago, and it in fact turns out to be a fact that these positions are indeed correct as per modern astronomical models, we should not be concluding that the positions of celestial objects were figments of literary imagination that turned out to be correct by mere coincidence. Rather, we should conclude that the author of the text either saw the positions of those bodies and wrote them down, or that he/she had the knowledge equivalent to modern physics, and had accurate observations and computational power to determine the positions of these bodies.

  

Hence, when ancient texts mention the positions of various celestial bodies at the time of the events that they describe, they should be seen as stating facts that can be verified, and hence providing verifiable authenticity to those texts. In this sense, the celestial objects are acting as notaries.

  

Please let me know what objections might be to this line of reasoning.

  

Thank you.

  

Pradyumna
