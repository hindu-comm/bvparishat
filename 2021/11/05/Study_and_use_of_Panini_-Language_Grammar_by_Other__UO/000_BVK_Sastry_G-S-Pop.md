Namaste



I am initiating a study of ‘ Panini Language: Rules and Word –listings’ classification in the frame work of ‘ Four Varna’s: the special terms needed by profession, faith-belief practices and cultural practices. The broad painting that ‘ Paninian language is Vedic-classical / Brahminical does not give the requisite clarity for this line of studies. The help I am looking for is reference to any earlier studies of Panini in the frame work of ‘Varna-Ashrama/ Jati-Kula-Vrutti’ Socio-economic eco system.



***Question ***: Has there been any referential study of ‘ Paninian Vocabulary in the frame work of ‘ Bharateeya Varna-Ashrama/ Jati-Kula-Vrutti’ Socio-economic eco system ? beyond the ‘ brahmana’ – ‘Vedic Yajna’ framework? More so for rest of the three varnas ? ?



***Basis*** :

a) Paninian language aka Sanskrit is ‘painted multi-coat thick as a Hindu –Brahmana (varna/ Jati/ Kula) –ritual –language’,

where in scholastic teams seem to project a public perception that ‘Sanskrit was ( is -?) not a language of / for ‘Broader Hindu – 

Kshatriya- Vaishya- shudra (varna- Jati-Kula) communities of Bharath’.
Is this correct ?



b) The ‘respected Panini- language –lexicon: Amarakosha’ lists by ‘varga’, Varna- specific vocabulary which comply and connect to Panini rules.



c) The ‘ Samskruth Vocabulary formation rules’ mainly in Taddhita-prakarna’ ( arhiya-pratyayas) are meant directly addressing
trade, commerce, service professions which are not characteristically marked for ‘Brahmana Varna / Vedic usage’. Example: ‘ purchased for the cost of the tail of a cow’ ( gopucchikam), ardha-navam ( Half- boat)/ naava-ardham ; ardha-dronakam ( half –measure of ‘drona’ unit). There are many more.
