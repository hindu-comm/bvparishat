This is one of the best decisions the Indian government made. Having met and interacted with him a few times, it is my belief that he will bring clarity to the muddled planning currently being implemented in India. I congratulate Sri Chamu Krishna Sastri on his new role, and wish to see SamskRutam and other Indian languages promoted fully.

  

Best Regards,
