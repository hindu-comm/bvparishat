A Peek into the Lecture:  

The art of Avadhāna is a unique feature of India’s literary tradition. Right from Vedic age it has been assiduously pursued and cultivated. Avadhāna was nurtured by the genius of the paṇḍitas or kavis and was cultivated as a śāstra (knowledge system), a vidyā ( a branch of learning) and a kalā (an art). Eventually it developed into a unique
tradition. This tradition is characterized by the interdependence and interrelationships with regional traditions, local dialects of India and its indigenous roots.Avadhāna was employed for preservation of Veda and also to make the practice of its memorization an engaging exercise. In
this lecture it is proposed to trace the continuous history of the Avadhāna-tradition from Vedic age to the 17th Century.
