Namaskar,

  

The cities are not sinking. The water level is rising and parts of the cities may get submerged.

  

There are many ways to react.

  

One remedy that comes to mind is to erect sea walls by using sand from sea floor. China is using similar techniques in Shrilanka and in South China Sea.

The sea wall has to be designed in a scientific way so that there will be minimal impact on marine environment. It requires careful mapping of the sea surface dynamics. This can be a major decade long sea floor modification project. It will give a moral boost to Indian Science and Technology.

  

The ocean giveth to those who seeketh!
