Namaskaram Kashyap Ji,

 I know the following sources for Sanskrit learning.

1.[The Madras Sanskrit College](https://digital.madrassanskritcollege.edu.in/site/home)They have courses for beginners as well as for intermediatelevel learners.

2.[Learn Sanskrit Online : vyoma-samskrta-pathasala (sanskritfromhome.org)](https://learn.sanskritfromhome.org/myaccount/#/classes)They have a variety of courses to explore and learn. Course materials are also provided to refer and practice.

3.[Correspondence Courses \| Samskrita Bharati](https://www.samskritabharati.in/correspondence_courses). Samskrita Bharati also offers course for beginners through different modes.

  

  

  

With best regards  
Suresh
