Namaste,

  

My friend who is retired wants to learn sanskrit. He is from Chennai. Somehow he has managed not to learn sanskrit for a long time. Very well versed in Tamil.

  

Can you please suggest some beginner classes and a series that can give him steady progress? I think he is willing to give time for this.
