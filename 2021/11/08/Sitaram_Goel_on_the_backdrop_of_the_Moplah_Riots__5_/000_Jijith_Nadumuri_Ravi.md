Namaste  

  

Here is my talk: Sitaram Goel: On the Backdrop of the Moplah Riots

<https://youtu.be/I0JeBUGUQ3M>  

  

The 1 hour talk includes a report on the global and local events that lead to the Moplah Riots of Malabar Kerala, the significance of SRG's scholarship and how it will help to avoid similar situations in the future and the scholarship of Amr-Athtar Yunajjam who has done a deep study of Arabian polytheism. The talk additionally focuses on the possible solutions to the threat posed by the Abrahamic monotheism. It also traces the source of the origins of the Abrahamic monotheism, which leads to certain ideas of Zoroastrianism.

  

The Q&A section includes a heated debate initiated by March Joris.
