Congratulations, Sri Krishnamurti garu! This is a great topic in which you have done research. I hope you will make use of your knowledge to create a commercial entity, make a successful business out of it and show everyone how one can gain aishwarya through Indian knowledge systems. That will amply illustrate to people why ancient India was the most prosperous country in the world. I wish you success in all your future endeavors.

  

Best Regards,

  

Krishna Kumar Pillalamarri
