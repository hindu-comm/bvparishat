Namaste to all vidwans,

  

1\. Have the prapanchasAra and the sAradAtilaka been translated into English?

  

I have seen the John Woodroffe English introduction to the prapanchasAra tantra (to the Sanskrit text) he published in his Tantra series but I don't think he or any of his colleagues ever translated the text proper. I an unaware if any scholar or indological publisher later took up the task.

  

One publisher (Sri Satguru publ) seems to have made an English-only translation of the sAradAtilaka tantra but the effort is inferior - the translation leaves much to be desired. I am not sure if anyone else has attempted a translation of this text.

  

2\. If the texts proper are not available in English, by any chance are there any translations into English of any of their several commentaries? Or any paper-length treatments?

  

I would much appreciate any guidance you could provide on this matter.  

  

with thanks

G Kashyap
