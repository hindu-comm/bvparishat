Namaste to everyone.

  

I am teaching a course in Vedanta at the HUA.

  

Many students have tough time trying to understand sanskrit terms used in philosophy (vedanta) like

maya, avidya, karma, jnana, moksha, paapa, mulavidya, and so many such terms

  

is there a list of sanskrit terms and their english meanings somewhere.

  

This will be of great use for so many students.

  

Probablyif such a dictionary has terms related to vedanta in general it will be great.
