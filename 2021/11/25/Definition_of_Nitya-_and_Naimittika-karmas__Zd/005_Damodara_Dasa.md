Hare Krishna.  
  
Also, just a reminder not to distract our attention from the  
discussion on the definition of nitya, naimittika, and kamya karmas.  
Ekadasi was given just as an example of a nitya duty which is not a  
daily duty.  
  
Regarding Ekadasi is nitya or not we can discuss in another thread  
meant for that purpose.  
  
In this thread, what we can learn from the quotations supplied is that  
the consideration of Ekadasi being nitya is primarily based on its  
being compulsory and having pratyavaya, not on its frequency of  
appearance.  
  
One of the quotations from Dharma-sindhu that Vishwas ji provided (he  
got it from a vidvan named Venkatesvaran) gives a decent definition of  
nitya, naimittika, and kamya karmas:  
  
नित्यं नैमित्तिकं काम्यं चेति ।  
नियतनिमित्ते विहितं नित्यं यथा दर्शादि।  
अनियतनिमित्ते विहितं नैमित्तिकं यथा पुत्रजन्मादिषु ।  
फलकामनोपाधिकं काम्यं यथा स्वर्गादिकामनायां कृत्तिकादिनक्षत्रे च ।  
  
However, although this looks good, it still needs to pass through the  
test of what the sistas used to follow; thus we need to also discuss  
how different samskaras have been followed by sistas as nitya,  
naimittika, or kamya and see if the practice of sistas fit this  
definition.
