Hare Krishna.

Respected Subrahmanian ji and other vidvaj-janas,

Thank you for your answers.

Vishwas ji has elaborately replied to many of your points but somehow, it seems that he has forgotten to involve bvparishat in the replies. I request if he can share those replies on this list also.



Regarding Ekadasi’s being kamya or nitya, he has shared some insights from P V Kane. Over and above that I would like to share conclusions of its Nityata as discussed by ancient scholars on the subject matter of dharma. For this email, I will limit myself to evidence from Hari Bhakti Vilasa (by Sanatana Gosvami).

In the Hari Bhakti Vilasa, Vilasa (chapter) 12, Ekadasi has been thoroughly established as nitya-karma for all people at all times. Many of the opposing arguments are discussed and answered with pramanas. Please read this link:

Hope this helps to clarify some conceptions about the Ekadasi’s being nitya or kamya-karma

Thank you,

Hari Guru Vaisnava das,

damodara das
