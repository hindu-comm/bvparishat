Hare Krishna.  
  
Respected Vidvaj-janas,  
Pranams.  
  
Nitya-karmas are often identified by saying that not following them  
there is pratyavaya. Another idea is that nitya karmas are performed  
not for any reward but only as a duty. Another idea is that  
nitya-karmas are daily activities.  
  
Naimittika karmas are those karmas that are to be performed when  
certain nimitta is produced. Another idea is that naimittika-karmas  
are those works that are not performed daily but occasionally; like  
every week, or every 15 days, or once in a lifetime, or not regularly.  
  
I wanted to get some wholesome idea of definitions of nitya and  
naimittika karmas that covers all these and any other considerations.  
Is there any Sanskrit work that specifically discusses this matter in  
detail (not in bits)?  
  
Can duties that are not daily duties be nitya-karmas just because  
there is pratyavaya mentioned for not performing them? For instance,  
is Ekadasi nitya karma or naimittika karma? Are samskaras (according  
to one's varna) nitya- or naimittika-karmas?  
  
Thank you,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
