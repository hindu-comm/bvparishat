Namaskar,

  

These two songs of Tagore, translated from the original Bangla by Sreejit Datta, have captured the eternal pulsation -- the 'cosmic dance' -- of the primordial and source vitality of all creation like few other literaryworks have:

  
1.*Bipulo tarongo re*  
2.*Danrao mono anonto brohmando majhe*
