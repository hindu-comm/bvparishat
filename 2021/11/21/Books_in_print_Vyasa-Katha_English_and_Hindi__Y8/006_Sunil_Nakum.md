Heartiest Congratulations Nityanand ji,

  

Muchneeded efforts in the direction of trustable children literature.

  

Needless to flog a dead horse but we all must have come across various versions of Panchatantra stories where authors have focused only on artistic pictures and taken the liberty of freedom of expression.

Eagerly waiting for the print.

  

Regards,

Sunil
