Dear Sri Nityanand Mishra,

  

I read with extreme interest the excerpts from your book Vyasa Katha. This is a very needed book for these times, and will be helpful to families everywhere. I also noted that the stories are faithful to the original, and hence of extreme interest to me. I will be sure to buy a few copies to distribute to my children and grandchildren..

  

Best Regards,  
  
Krishna
