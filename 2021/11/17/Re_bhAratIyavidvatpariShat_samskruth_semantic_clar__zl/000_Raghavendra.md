Greetings of the day,

  

"Every sound" is an epithet of the ultimate ontological principle विष्णु, and they denote and connote विष्णु primarily and pre-eminently, according to श्रीमन्-मध्वाचार्य.

  

He, thus, provides 'spiritual orientation' to words of common usage. For example, he provides the following shades of etymology of the term अहम् which is spiritually distinct,

  

◆अहेयत्वात् 'अहं नाम' भगवान् हरिरव्ययः"।

  

◆'हं नाम' हन्यमानत्वात् जीवस्य समुदाहृतः। जीवादन्यो यतो विष्णुर् 'अहं नामा' ततः स्मृतः ।

  

◆'अहं नामा' जीवगतो नित्याहेयत्व हेतुतः।

  

◆'अहमेषो' ह्यहेयत्वात् जीवेन सहभावतः।

  

This is for your information.

  

Thank you & Best regards,

Subject: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} samskruth semantic clarification for 'aham'  
  

Namaste



Two connected questions seeking samskruth-semantic expression clarity
from Vedanta and Vyakarana scholars.

The simplistic translation of ‘aham’= ‘I’ is unsatisfactory in many instances. So what would be transaltion of ‘kevaloham’ ? – Only I, Residual I,….. ??

What might be acharyas intention in these expressions? 



*Question*

**

a) What is the difference between 'aham' and ' kevaloham' \[aham with the adjective - 'kevala'\] ?



b) Does the term 'aham' as ' (sarvanaama- asmat- prathama-ekavachana' carry a different significance compared to the usage of ' aham' as a 'avyaya (vibhatki-prati-rupaka) ?



*Reference*:

For first question:

Two compositions - Nirvana-Dashakam and Nirvana-Shatka attributed to Acharya Shankara.

Nirvana Dashakam uses the expression -' tadekovashishatah- shivah- kevaloham'.

Nirvana Shatkam uses the expression -' shivo'ham'



For Second question:

Samskruth vyakarana commentaries.





Thanks in advance for the help.



Regards
