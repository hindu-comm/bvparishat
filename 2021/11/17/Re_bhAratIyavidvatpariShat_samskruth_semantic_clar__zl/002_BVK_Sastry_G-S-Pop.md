Namaste Patauri ji



Can you please further elaborate the ‘kevaloham’ expression in the total context reading

 ‘tadekovashishtah, shivah kevaloham’-



where ‘aham’ seems to be qualified by ‘tat (aham)- ekah(aham)-
avashishtah(aham)- shivah (aham) ,

as rest of the sloka clears what out ‘what I am not’ ( tat)- na- (aham).



My hunch opinion is : Each of the phrases is an answer to the basic
upanishadic question : ‘Koham’ ? Who am I ?



Look forward for more clarity.



Regards

BVK Sastry
