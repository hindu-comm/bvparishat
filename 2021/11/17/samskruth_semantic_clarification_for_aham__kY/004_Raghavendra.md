Question was about शास्त्र-दृष्टि.Is it सर्वात्मकत्वम् or अन्तर्यामित्वम् for Sri. Shankara?

  

अन्तर्यामित्वम् is also theशास्त्र-दृष्टि for Sri. Shankara is argued below. While doing so, the following points have been made, (paragraph reference is to the english texts)

  

◆ Jivas' अन्तर्यामि is jiva himself, (Para 1)

◆अन्तर्यामि is आत्मा, (Para 3)

◆अन्तर्यामि is Brahman, (Para 4)

◆ प्रत्यगात्मान् isअन्तर्यामि (Para 8)

  

कठोपनिषद् quoted has used a significant term viz., अन्तरात्मन्, the corroborative statement for this expression is - यस्यात्मा शरीरम् found in Br.Up.

  

When jiva isअन्तर्यामि of jiva, then, what is meant byअन्तरात्मन् and/orयस्यात्मा शरीरम्?. It becomes clear that these texts (=अन्तरात्मन् and/orयस्यात्मा शरीरम्) have direct reference \*परमात्मा\* not प्रत्यगात्मा.

  

I eagerly await expert response to my original questions from respected Prof. SK ji.

  

Thank you & Best regards,
