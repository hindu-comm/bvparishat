There is the Brihadaranyaka mantra 4.4.12 -

  

आत्मानं चेद्विजानीयादयमस्मीतिपूरुषः। किमिच्छन्कस्य कामाय शरीरमनुसञ्ज्वरेत् ॥ १२ ॥  

  

which says: if one realizes the Atman as 'I am this', there is no more samsara for him.

  

Here, the term 'Atman' has to necessarily refer to the Supreme Brahman since the fruit of realization is moksha. This is in tune with the first Brahma sutra 'athato brahma jijnasa' where the logical conclusion is: knowledge of Brahman is sought by the mumukshu with a view to transcend bondage. If Brahman-knowledge should free him from 'his' samsara, necessarily 'he' has to be non-different from Brahman.

  

From the Bh.Gita 13th chapter:

  

पुरुषः प्रकृतिस्थो हि भुङ्क्तेप्रकृतिजान्गुणान् । कारणं गुणसङ्गोऽस्य सदसद्योनिजन्मसु ॥ २१ ॥  

  

The Atman, owing to the identification with prakruti, experiences as its own, the attributes of prakruti, anAtma. This is the cause of repeated birth in various forms.

  

Thus, the cause of bondage is stated as: not knowing one's true self as distinct from prakruti.

  

The Brihadaranyaka mantra stated above thus means the realization 'This Atman is me' is necessarily the knowledge of Brahman as oneself, as per the opening Brahma sutra.

  

So, even though the word 'aham' is not there in that mantra, the word 'asmi' present there has the आकाङ्क्षा which is fulfilled by supplying the word 'aham'. This is in exact correspondence with the Brihadaranyaka 1.4.10 mantra 'aham brahmasmi' where there is noआकाङ्क्षा-‘तदात्मानमेवावेदहंब्रह्मास्मीति, तस्मात्तत्सर्वमभवत्’ where Brahman realized itself as 'I am Brahman' and as a result transcended its incidental paricchinna bhaava. The word 'Atma' (आमानं) in the other mantra above is stated as 'Brahma' in this mantra. Thus, the aham present in 1.4.10 is absent in 4.4.12, only leading us in reading the mantraआत्मानं चेद्विजानीयादयमहमस्मीतिपूरुषः।..

  

Here we get a clear meaning of 'aham' as used in the Vedantic sense, as not the bound jiva but Brahman, the antaryami, the Supreme. Atma too is not the jivAtma in the bound state but the ever-liberated Brahman.
