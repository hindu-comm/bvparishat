Please be requested to read the trail mail for the connection.

  

To the question, whether 'Aham' has a different significance, I quoted the view of Sri. Madhva. For Sri. Madhva, the term 'Aham' is the "content of Brahman himself' (‡§Ö‡§π‡•á‡§Ø‡§§‡•ç‡§µ-‡§ó‡•Å‡§£) and it is not to be taken in the sense of the grammatical "I" when the said term is applied to Brahman. To substantiate, I quoted shruti-texts :‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã‡§™‡§®‡§ø‡§∑‡§¶‡•ç "‡§Ö‡§π‡§∞‡•ç" ‡§á‡§§‡§ø and ‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã‡§™‡§®‡§ø‡§∑‡§¶‡•ç "‡§Ö‡§π‡§Æ‡•ç" ‡§á‡§§‡§ø.

  

Connected matter was indeed discussed. Reveared Prof. SK ji shared copious materials from the source texts. I asked him two queries on the observation he had made, one), relating to the view of the grammarians who hold 'Aham' as the 'indweller", two), relating to what "different significance" does the term "Aham" carries (asked by Vid. Shri. BVK Ji)

  

Given this background, I fail to understand the comment "not directly connected with the topic". ü§î
