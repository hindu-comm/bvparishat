Namaste



So the summary wisdom seems to be the following.

Is this ‘common agreeable acceptable semantic ‘(padartha- nirukti- taatparya- nirnaya)’ – for ‘aham’- \[Technically ‘pada’ in Vyakarana – by ‘sup-ting-antam- padam’. \] ? for ‘ all six- darshana- shaastras’ ? \[ kaanaadam paanineeyam sarva-shaastropakaarakam \].



\< we get the following significations of the term 'Aham' from the perspective of Darshana and grammar schools of thought,

-   Brahman, -   Pratyagaatman, -   Antaryaamin (?) -   Secret Nameof Brahman (rahasya naama), -   Jeevaatman (by way of upachaara / manner of speech at the second
    stage)

If the term 'Aham' carries the significance viz., 'Secret Name of Brahman' / 'rahasya naama', then, the term 'Aham' as the 'content of Brahman' is also not wrong. \>
