Namaste



Two connected questions seeking samskruth-semantic expression clarity
from Vedanta and Vyakarana scholars.

The simplistic translation of ‘aham’= ‘I’ is unsatisfactory in many instances. So what would be transaltion of ‘kevaloham’ ? – Only I, Residual I,….. ??

What might be acharyas intention in these expressions? 



*Question*

**

a) What is the difference between 'aham' and ' kevaloham' \[aham with the adjective - 'kevala'\] ?



b) Does the term 'aham' as ' (sarvanaama- asmat- prathama-ekavachana' carry a different significance compared to the usage of ' aham' as a 'avyaya (vibhatki-prati-rupaka) ?



*Reference*:

For first question:

Two compositions - Nirvana-Dashakam and Nirvana-Shatka attributed to Acharya Shankara.

Nirvana Dashakam uses the expression -' tadekovashishatah- shivah- kevaloham'.

Nirvana Shatkam uses the expression -' shivo'ham'



For Second question:

Samskruth vyakarana commentaries.





Thanks in advance for the help.
