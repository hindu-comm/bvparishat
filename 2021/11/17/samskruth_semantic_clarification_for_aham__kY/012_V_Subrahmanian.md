Namaste

  

While someone well versed in Vyakarana could explain that part, the Vedanta approach is to take the lakshyartha when the vachyartha is not fitting in the context. 'Aham' would primarily mean the person, a body-mind complex. But this cannot be the entity, Brahman, denoted by the word 'ayam'. So, the aham here is the pancha kosha vilakshana shuddha chaitanyam. This is taught for nididhyasanam and the resultant realization.
