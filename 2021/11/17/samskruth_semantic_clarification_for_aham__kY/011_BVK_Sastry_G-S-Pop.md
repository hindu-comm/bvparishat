Namaste



On \< Here … आत्मानं चेद्विजानीयादयमहमस्मीतिपूरुषः …… we get a clear meaning of 'aham' as used in the Vedantic sense, as not the bound jiva but Brahman, the antaryami, the Supreme. Atma too is not the jivAtma in the bound state but the ever-liberated Brahman. > :



*Request clarification*: Is this guidance to understand the shruti –passage



***From*** vyakarana- padartha nirukti-nirnaya - approach- using
praatipadikartha model- meaning of ‘ aham’ (derived from sarvanama: asmad / or vibhakti-pratiroopaka-avyaya) ? and pushing it to rest of sarvanamas ‘ayam’, idam, sarvam, tat … ( where sarvanama- pratipadika- base is different with a different meaning – pointer - :: asmad is different pointer from adas, sarva, yushmat, tat …).

**Or**

Vedanta-paribhashaa- upadesha approach for upaasanaa ? please.
