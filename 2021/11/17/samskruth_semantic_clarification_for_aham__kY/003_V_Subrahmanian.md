Actually there is no variance with the Antaryami as jiva. In the Antaryami Brahmana of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 3.7.3, the discourse starts with specifying the Antaryami Chaitanya as the impeller of the body-mind complex of all jivas:

  

यः पृथिव्यां तिष्ठन्पृथिव्या अन्तरो यं पृथिवी न वेद यस्य पृथिवी शरीरं यः पृथिवीमन्तरो यमयत्येष त आत्मान्तर्याम्यमृतः ॥ ३ ॥  

  

That Consciousness,Immortal Antaryami,which impels the body-mind-organs of the Prithvi devata (a jiva) by remaining within it but which the Prithvi devata does not know, is 'your' Atma,

  

A long list of various entities for whom this Antaryami is the Atma is stated in this section. Therefore, the Upanishad itself teaches that 'Antaryami is the Atma' of everyone.

  

The section ends with this declaration:

  

यो रेतसि तिष्ठन्रेतसोऽन्तरो यं रेतो न वेद यस्य रेतः शरीरं यो रेतोऽन्तरो यमयत्येष त आत्मान्तर्याम्यमृतोऽदृष्टो द्रष्टाश्रुतः श्रोतामतो मन्ताविज्ञातो विज्ञाता नान्योऽतोऽस्ति द्रष्टा नान्योऽतोऽस्ति श्रोता नान्योऽतोऽस्ति मन्ता नान्योऽतोऽस्ति विज्ञातैष त आत्मान्तर्याम्यमृतोऽतोऽन्यदार्तं ततो होद्दालक आरुणिरुपरराम ॥ २३ ॥  

  

This Antaryami is the unseen seer, unheard hearer, unknown knower, etc. And there is no knower, seer, hearer, etc. other than this Antaryami.
Shankara holds this to be a teaching of the identity of the jiva and Brahman (Antaryami). This is because, all of us experience 'I see, hear, know, etc.' and not 'someone else sees, hears, knows, etc.' The Upanishad clarifies that the one seeing, hearing, etc. in a body is none other than this Antaryami, who has been taught as 'your' Atma.

  

If the jiva is not the Atma, then it has to be anatma, which is not a desirable proposition. Since anatma is necessarily jada as taught in the Kshetradhyaya of the Bh.Gita 13th ch: Kshetram, observed, is the body-mind, thoughts, the outside world of sound, etc. and the Kshetrajna, the observer, एतद् यो वेत्ति, is the one that illumines the kshetram. If the jiva is not the illuminingconsciousness, kshetrajna, then it will have to fall in the illumined, observed, insentient lot.

  

The Antaryami brahmana is teaching that the illumining, impelling, consciousness, the Antaryami, is the Atma of everyone. And also that there is no seer, hearer, in everyone other than this Antaryami.

  

Also, the term pratyagatma is interesting. The Kathopanishat2.4.1 says:

  

पराञ्चि खानि व्यतृणत्स्वयम्भूस्तस्मात्पराङ् पश्यति नान्तरात्मन् । कश्चिद्धीरःप्रत्यगात्मानमैक्षदावृत्तचक्षुरमृतत्वमिच्छन् ॥ १ ॥  

  

The mumukshu, aiming at amrutatvam, immortality, restraining his sense organs, etc. engages in the sadhana and realizes the Pratyagatma.

  

The Brihadaranyaka uses the adjective amrutam for the Antaryami and teaches that Antaryami as the Atma. AntaH = inner/inside = Pratyak. Amrutatvam of the Kathopanishat can be ralized only if that Pratyagatma is Amrutam. So, the pratyagatma is the Antaryami, the Atman.

  

The Mandukyopanishad 7th mantra says:नान्तःप्रज्ञं नबहिःप्रज्ञं नोभयतःप्रज्ञं नप्रज्ञानघनं नप्रज्ञं नाप्रज्ञम् । अदृश्यमव्यवहार्यमग्राह्यमलक्षणमचिन्त्यमव्यपदेश्यमेकात्मप्रत्ययसारं प्रपञ्चोपशमंशान्तं *शिवमद्वैतं चतुर्थं मन्यन्ते स आत्मा स विज्ञेयः* ॥ ७ ॥The Turiya, called chaturtham here, which is shivam, advaitam, Atma, is to be realized (for mukti).

  

Thus, that one to be realized is taught as the Atma.

  

The शिवः केवलोऽहम् / शिवोऽहम् etc. in the compositions cited in the first post, are in tune with the above Upanishadic statements. (The 'Shiva' here is not Parvatipati but that which is auspicious, mangala/ananda svarupa, as in the Mandukya mantra above.)

  

Here is a verse cited by the commentary to the Svarajyasiddhi:

  

शिव इत्यहमित्युभौ न भिन्नौ शिव एवाहं अहं शिवः स एव ।  
यदि नैवं अनात्मता शिवस्य प्रसरेत् अशिवत्वमात्मनोऽपि ॥  
  
\~ स्वराज्यसिद्धि टीका ३.३९  
  
" The two, Shiva and I, are never different. I am Siva Himself and Siva is I myself. Otherwise, अनात्मता / जड़त्व will pervade Siva and अशिवत्व (inauspiciousness), the Atman. "  

  

Om Tat Sat
