Namaste. We need not look beyond Shankaracharya's preamble to the Brahmasutra Bhashyam, the document on Adhyasa for a precise answer to your question: Viveka that cures aviveka. The modalities involved in the actual practice is 'dosha darshanam' or perception of the faults with regard to the body and all the troubles the identification with the body throws up. In other words it is vairagya. Works of Shankara such as the Vivekachudamani, Aparokshanubhuti, Atmabodha, etc, have much material on the specific topic of body identification.
