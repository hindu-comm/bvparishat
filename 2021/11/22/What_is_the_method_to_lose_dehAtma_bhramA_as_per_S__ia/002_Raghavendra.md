Greetings of the day,

  

From the following examples enlisted in the preamble to the BSB about superimposition of what is 'not-self' on the 'self', (अभेदाध्यास between self and not-self), it appears that सर्वश्री-शङ्कर had in full viewअभेदाध्यास as मिथ्या-प्रत्यय-रूप.

  

◆अहमेव विकलः सकलो वा इति बाह्य धर्मान् आत्मनि अध्यस्यति,

  

◆तथा देहधर्मान् स्थूलोऽहं कृशोऽहं गौरोऽहं तिष्ठामि गच्छामि लङ्घयामि च इति \| तथा इन्द्रियधर्मान् मूकः काणः क्लीब: बधिर: अन्धोऽहम् इति \| तथा अन्तःकरण धर्मान् काम संकल्प विचिकित्सा अध्यवसायादीन् ,

  

◆एवम् अहंप्रत्ययिनम् अशेषस्वप्रचारसाक्षिणि प्रत्यगात्मनि अध्यस्य तं च प्रत्यगात्मानं सर्वसाक्षिणं तद्विपर्ययेण अन्तःकरणादिषु अध्यस्यति,

  

What logically follows from the above is that the 'self' is NOT 'not-self' and thus they are different, thereby the भेद between 'self' and 'not-self' is प्रत्यय-रूप.

  

Please clarify,

  

Thank you & Best regards,

Subject: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} What is the method to lose "dehAtma bhramA" as per Sri Shankara BhAshya?  
  

"The way to truth lies through the destruction of the false. To destroy the false, you must question your most inveterate beliefs. *Of these the idea that you are the body is the worst. With the body comes the world, with the world - God, *who is supposed to have created the world and thus it starts - fears, religions, prayers, sacrifices, all sorts of systems - all to protect and support the child-man, *frightened out of his wits by monsters of his own making*. Realize that what you are cannot be born nor die and with the fear gone, all suffering ends." \~ Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj .  

  

What is the method to lose "dehAtma bhramA" as per Sri Shankara BhAshya?  

  

Is there a clear and answer in a nutshell based as per Shankara Bhashya on "prasthAna traya" or any of the main prakarana granthas?
