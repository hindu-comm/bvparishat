"The way to truth lies through the destruction of the false. To destroy the false, you must question your most inveterate beliefs. *Of these the idea that you are the body is the worst. With the body comes the world, with the world - God, *who is supposed to have created the world and thus it starts - fears, religions, prayers, sacrifices, all sorts of systems - all to protect and support the child-man, *frightened out of his wits by monsters of his own making*. Realize that what you are cannot be born nor die and with the fear gone, all suffering ends." \~ Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj .  

  

What is the method to lose "dehAtma bhramA" as per Sri Shankara BhAshya?  

  

Is there a clear and answer in a nutshell based as per Shankara Bhashya on "prasthAna traya" or any of the main prakarana granthas?
