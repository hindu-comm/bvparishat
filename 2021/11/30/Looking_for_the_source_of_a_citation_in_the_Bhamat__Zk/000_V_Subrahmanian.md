In the Bhamati, at the beginning, there is this line cited by the author:  

  

बाह्या अप्याहुः - “शास्त्रचिन्तकाः खल्वेवं विवेचयन्ति न प्रतिपत्तारः” इति।  

  

Since he says 'outsiders', the explanation given by teachers is that it could be from a Bauddha text.

  

Any help in tracing the quote to its source is welcome.

  

Thanks.
