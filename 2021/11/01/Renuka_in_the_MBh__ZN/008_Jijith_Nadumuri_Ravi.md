True.

  

Additionally, there is a vew that Renuka represent Tantrik tradition like Kaula Tantra. If true, then the severing of the head of Renuka is a symbolism of certain Tantrik practices.

  

Even otherwise, the narrative made it amply clear that the head of Renuka was soon restored and all memory of the cutting of Renuka's head, erased with immediate effect.

  

Thus, the whole narrative seems to be symbolic.
