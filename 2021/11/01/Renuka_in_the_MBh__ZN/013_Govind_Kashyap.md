Namaste Jijith ji

  

May I request you to consider elucidating further on the link between the blessed mother of Parasurama and the tantras. Is there any tradition, source or sampradaya extant in this regard? I am only aware of Sri (Vasistha) Ganapati Muni, associate of Sri Ramana Maharshi, who is said to have practised renuka or vidyut shakti sadhana (leading to the awakening of his kundalini) in recent times.

  

In my understanding, per Vaidic tradition, Rudra is said to represent the essential devata of the atmosphere and is propitiated in the form of lightning (vidyut). (In the Yajur-veda, Rudra is identified with Hiranyagarbha or Prajapati or Brahman itself, of course). Could there be any (symbolic) link between Rudra as a diety, Rudra as Brahman and Renuka in the form of one of the 10 maha vidya-s in the tantras? Sri S Sankaranarayanan had made a strong (preliminary) effort in this matter, of course.
