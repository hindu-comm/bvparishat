Dear Nagaraj ji

  

If you are asking me.

  

I don't endorse the word 'Bhruguization' of the Mahabharata. If the word 'True' in my previous email gave that impression, then please take this email as my clarification. I used it in general affirmation to say that 'yes, it is indeed one of the main Bhrgu narratives foundin the Mahabharata'.

  

The Bhrgus were one of the opposing clans in the Dasarajna Battle along with the Druyus, aligned against the Trtsu king Sudas Paijavana. Bhargava Shukaracharya functioned as the Asura Guru, as per the Puranas. Yet the Bhrigus like Jamadagni and Rama Jaamadagnya contributed several great hymns to Rgveda, especially in the late Rgvedic Mandalas. Thus Bhrgus are an integral part of our Vedic tradition. Hence they are integral to Mahabharata too.

  

This is my view.

  

Regards

Jijith
