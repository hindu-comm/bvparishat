The content in the links shared has several factual errors, misunderstandings, misinterpretations and distortions.

  

The folk version of RanukaDevi / Renuka Mata is Ellamma. That is right.

  

My piece on Ellamma is here:

  

<https://www.academia.edu/8612760/_Ellamma_in_South_Asian_Folklore_an_Encyclopaedia_Routledge_175_176_Margaret_Mills_et_al_ed_New_York_2003>  

  

The article in the link<http://enfolding.org/wikis-4/tantra-wikiwikis-4tantra-wiki/deities/yellamma/>

  

ties the Ellamma tradition to Devadasi tradition and mentions jogin , jogthi jogappa as part of Devadasi tradition.

  

It is not totally wrong to view jogin tradition as a kind of Devadasi tradition. But it is too simplistic and reductionist towards a highly intricate tradition that needs an equally nuanced understanding. Maatangi, Basivi etc. are traditions related to Jogin tradition.

  

The Devadasi tradition is , as is usual with the contemporary modernist urbanist uprooted misunderstanding of the tradition, represented as one of sexual exploitation.

  

This PhD work on Devadasi tradition

  

<https://www.academia.edu/25304347/NITYASUMANGALI_towards_the_semiosis_of_the_devadasi_tradition_of_South_India_May_18_1984_PhD_Dissertation_University_of_Utrecht_The_Netherlands>  

  

does not have any remote indication of sexual exploitation.

  

Irrespective of such a research work, all the evidences point to the tradition not having a sexual exploitation aspect at its roots.

  

Same is the case with Jogin /Jogthi, Matangi, Basivi traditions.

  

The article reflects a confusion of Jagappas, the transvestite Jogins for 'Homosexuals' . This misunderstanding of sexual orientation aspect which is absent in and is in contradiction to the Jogappa tradition is rooted in the understanding of Jogin tradition along with the Devadasi tradition itself as a sex-related tradition.

  

Be that as it may,

  

Ellamma is the family deity and community deity for several families and communities that have no connection with Jogin or Jogappa tradition apart from the families and communities that have connection with Jogin or Jogappa tradition.

  

So sex, sex-orientation or gender change related aspects are not the essential or foundational features of the Devi/ Amman/Ammavaaru.

  

The articles in the links do not mention Tamil Nadu among the regions of prevalence of Ellamma worship.
