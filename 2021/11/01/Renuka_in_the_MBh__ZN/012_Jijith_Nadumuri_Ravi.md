Dear Shri Nagaraj ji

  

I fully concur with you on this.

  

The Bhṛgus are bringers of Agni and Soma for the Bharatas. The 2nd Mandala hymnsof Ṛgveda are mostly authored by Rshi Grtsamada who was adopted into the Bhargava family. Somahuti Bhargava, Jamadagni Bhargava, Rama Jamadagnya (Parasu Rama), Krtnu Bhargava, Nema Bhargava, Prayoga Bhargava, Kavi Bhargava, Vena Bhargava, Cyavana Bhargava Syumarasmi Bhargava , Ita Bhargava - numeroussuch Bhargavas has contributed hymns to the Rgveda as per the Rgvedic Anukramani. Parasu Rama is mentioned both in Ramayana and Mahabharata in prominent roles. In Ramayana he comes as an opponent of Dasarathi Rama and then appreciates him and leaves. In the Mahabharata he appears as the guru of many like Bhīṣma and Karna.

  

Mahabharata is structured in such a way that in its outer frame-tale Ugrasrava Sauti narrates it to Shanuaka Bhargava. Vyasa's discipleVaisampayana too is a Bhargava. They are thus one of the preservers of the Mahabharata. Valmiki's ancestry can be traced to the Bhargava family according to some. The only recension of the Ṛgveda that is available today is the Bhṛgu recension (SAkala). One of the two extent recensions of Atharva Veda is of the Bhṛgus(Saunaka). One of the three importantrecensions of the SAma Veda (Jaiminiya) is Bhṛgu recension. One of the four more important rencesnions of the Krishna Yajur Veda (Taittiriya) is again Bhṛgu recension.

  

YAska the author of Niruktha, in my understandingis a Bhṛgu. Panini the author of Ashtadhyayi is Bhṛgu. RgvidAna, Brihaddevata and most versions of Anukramanis are authored by Shaunaka Bhargavas. The available PadapAthais also of SAkalya. Jaimini Bhargava founded the system of Purva Mimansa.

  

**Krishna in Geeta says, महर्षीणां भृगुरहं (BG 10.25):- among the great Rishis I am Bhrgu.**
