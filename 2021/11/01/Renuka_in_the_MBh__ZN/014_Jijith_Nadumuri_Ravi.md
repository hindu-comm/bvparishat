Namaste Sri GK ji  
  
This is not my core expertise, but I have heard a lot about these in various forums. Below are some links that describe the folklore traditions in this direction, most of them developed in the post Vedic, post Aitihāsic periods.

  

Just sharing, so that it may help in this case. I am however not endorsing everything that is mentioned in these links.
