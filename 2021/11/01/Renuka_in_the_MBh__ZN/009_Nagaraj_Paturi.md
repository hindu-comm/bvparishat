Can I get some guidance regarding Bhrugisation of Mahabharata.

  

I know the significance with which the Bhrigu lineage is mentioned in parts of Mahabharata.

  

But why such a significance is called Bhriguisation is what I am trying to learn.

  

This thread is about the mention of severing of Renuka's head by Parashurama .

  

I am also trying to learn how the mention of that particular event /portion of the narrative is essential for or tied to this 'Bhriguisation' .
