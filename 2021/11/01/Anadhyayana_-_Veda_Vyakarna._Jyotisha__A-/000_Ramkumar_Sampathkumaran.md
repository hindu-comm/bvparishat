From Many smriti 4.113 / 4.114 - we have the details of Veda Anadhyayana on Amavasya, Poonima, 2 Chaturdasi, 2 Ashtami, 2 Pratipada and surya sankranti.

  

I recently came to know that for vyakarna we follow anadhyayana on pratipada and ashtami - I would like to know any references for that.

  

And also is there anything similar for jyotisha as a vedanga too?

  

regards,

Ram
