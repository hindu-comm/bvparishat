A friend of mine who retired as sanskrit teacher of a secondary school mentions

1.  The word कन्यादानं can be split as कन्या + दानं (gifting of the
    kanya) &

कन्या + आदानं (acceptance of a kanya)

2.  In South Indian marriage invitations, the bride's family alone
    employs the word कन्यादानं thus perhaps as per कन्या + दानं.
    splitting.(The groom's party uses a different word फाणिग्रहणं)

3.  If the groom's family (who does आदनं of the कन्या) employ the word
    कन्यादानं in their invitation, and the bride's party does not use
    it, then the concerns of Dr. A. Srinivasan like, will be taken care
    of.

4.  But for generations we are used to the splitting कन्या + दानं and
    will be difficult to change
