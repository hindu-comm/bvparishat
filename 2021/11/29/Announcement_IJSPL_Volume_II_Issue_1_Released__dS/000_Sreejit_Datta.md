Namaskar,

  
I am pleased to inform you that the International Journal of Studies in Public Leadership (or IJSPL), a biannual peer-reviewed online journal published by Rashtram School of Public Leadership, Rishihood University, has just released its latest issue (Volume II, Issue 1). This is the third issue of IJSPL to have come out since the journal started its journey back in November 2020. The latest issue consists of five research articles and a book review. Read it here:

I'd like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the Editor-in-Chief, members of the editorial advisory and review boards, Rashtram in-house editor, IJSPL journal manager, and the authors whose articles have been featured in this issue. The Call for Papers of the forthcoming issue will be released soon. 

  

Thanks and regards,
