Respected list members,

  

I tried to locate the source for the Ekavimshati mahadoshas commonly used in deciding muhurthas for marriages, but could not find any. I only could get references to Sri B. V. Raman's works but no traditional references.

  

Kindly let me know if you have come across any traditional text which refers to it.

  

Thank you.

Pradyumna
