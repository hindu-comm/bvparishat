Om,

I'm using LaTeX to typeset all notes/books.

I know that PDF created by XeLaTeX doesn't allow proper search/copy-pasting of devanagari and similar fonts. From the generated PDF of महावीरी, it is evident that searching becomes normal. But, copy-pasting is still broken.  

I'll like to understand the usage of Harfbuzz renderer. How does it work ?

Should I create an issue on Github for the same, or answering here is possible?
