Om,

From your simple example, I now understand the procedure to use this renderer with LaTeX.

The text pdf works for searching a single word and multiple adjacent words. In mahAvIrI, it didn't work for multiple words for some reasons.

I'm using Skim PDF reader in macOS. I didn't check on other platform.

Here is copy paste from the test pdf-  

प्रसन्नतां या न गताऽ��षेकतस्तथा न मम्लौ वनवासदुःखतः।

It has some undesired characters. But, at least search works.

I'll try to contact Shreevatsa R. on other forum for help.

Thanks.
