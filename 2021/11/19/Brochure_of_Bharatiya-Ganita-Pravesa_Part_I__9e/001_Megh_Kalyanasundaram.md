Namaskaaram Professor M.D. Srinivas ji,

  

Thank you so very much for this note, rich and ripe with insights. I found the combination of the breadth of your presentation, in terms of the disciplines covered, and its depth, in terms of how far back in time youhave gone, to be unique and insightful.

  

Amongst several other things, I am so glad you shone the light prominently on language sciences. You said:

So these > sounds were classified on the basis of the origin of these sounds, > where the sound is produced." (Transcribed as heard from > <https://youtu.be/ICzT7Q7LXgc?t=22046>; almost verbatim if not wholly > so)

While you have then cited Staal (2003) before proceeding to a chart of the वर्णसमाम्नाय, University Press publications (in this case Chicago Press), even in publications as late as 2019, such as the book*Battle in the Mind Fields*{Laks, Bernard & Goldsmith, John A., The University of Chicago Press, Chicago/London} credit William Diwght Whitney—whom they call "the first great American linguist" (Laks and Goldsmith 2019:100)—with, amongst other things, the introduction of "...the various parts of the articulatory apparatus..." (ibid.:104).

  

Best,

Megh

  

Incidentally (and in a paper presented in 2017 and as part of contributing to a*Pūrva Pakśa of (IE) linguistics*), Manogna Sastry and I had flagged some of Laks and Goldsmith's attributions to Whitney, by comparing those attributions to portions from James Ballantyne's*The Laghu Kaumudi: A Sanskrit Grammar by Varadaraja with an English Version, Commentary, and References,*published first in 1849, a year that was well before the years when Whitney's works*Language and the Study of Language*and*A Sanskrit Grammar*were first published. Our analysis was, as we had said so in the paper itself, a small addition to many more comparative examples found in the book *[Theories of Language: Oriental and Occidental](https://www.amazon.in/Theories-Language-Occidental-Korada-Subrahmanyam/dp/812460455X)*byमहामहोपाध्याय Korada Subrahmanyam ji.
