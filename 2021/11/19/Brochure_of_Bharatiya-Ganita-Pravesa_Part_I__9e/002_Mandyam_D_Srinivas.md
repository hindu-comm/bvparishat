dear megh,

  

Thanks for taking the trouble to go through the lecture and the comments. It is appallingthat even current books credit Whitneywith the discovery of the Indian principle of classifying sounds by the place of articulation and effort. Of course, there have been many scholars such as Allen and Kiparsky who have noted the contribution of Indian science of languages to the development of modern Linguisticsin the last two centuries.

  

Whitney deserves to be better known for his disparaging comments on the grammar of Panini and for the misleading and highly prejudiced notes that he added to Burgess' translation of the Surya-siddhanta.

  

best regards

  

M D Srinivas
