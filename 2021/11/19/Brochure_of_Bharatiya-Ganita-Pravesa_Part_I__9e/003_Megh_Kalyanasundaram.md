While I hear what you say about Allen and Kiparsky, in Margaret Thomas'*[Fifty Key Thinkers on Language and Linguistics](https://www.routledge.com/Fifty-Key-Thinkers-on-Language-and-Linguistics/Thomas/p/book/9780415373036)*, Pāṇini, while featuring in her list, does not make it to the top 3 (those she considers to be with “unquestionable influence and importance” (Thomas 2011:xv)), in which she has included Plato, Saussure and Chomsky. Both Saussure and Chomsky come under examination in महामहोपाध्याय Korada Subrahmanyam ji's book[Theories of Language: Oriental and Occidental](https://www.amazon.in/Theories-Language-Occidental-Korada-Subrahmanyam/dp/812460455X).

  

Best,

Megh
