Learned people,

  

Serendipity/chance works in mysterious ways, and so here is a link to Swami Padmanabha'stalks and articles, who, Krishna knows why, for I have no adhikaarain these matters, contacted me asking if I would write a brief blurb for his book that is soon going to be published.

  

<https://sabdabrahman.com/featured-lectures_files/padma.php>  

  

He seems to be either from Spain or from Argentina, and he offers a peep into the world of Western/ and/or non-Indian Krishna bhaktas and their work and pursuits. If anyone in this august list wants to contact him or do a review of his book, please let me know asap, and I will connect him with you.

  

Meanwhile, you will see under my signature, a thumbnail pic of my book on intercultural communication that is going to be released next week, courtesy of Indic Academy.

  

Regards,

  

Ramesh Rao
