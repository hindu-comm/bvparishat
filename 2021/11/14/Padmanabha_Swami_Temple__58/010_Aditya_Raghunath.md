There were in total 11 Azhwars and Nammazhvar is considered as the chief among all the Azhwars. As stated by Srinivas/Radhakrishanji, the word means Namma(our) -Azhwar. He was the one who imparted the knowledge of all the 4000 divyaprabhandham composed by him and other Azhwars to Sri Nathamuni who codified them and ensured they are not lost again.  

  

Another meaning of Azhwar is one who is completely absorbed in the divine attributes of Bhagavan(Naarayana).
