There is now scholarly consensus that the term 'आऴवार' (āḻvār, ஆழ்வார்), written familiarly as Azhwar, is a medieval hypercorrection for 'आळवार' (āḷvār, ஆள்வார்). See, for example, Palaniappan, S. 2004. *Āḻvār or Nāyanār* in Chevillard, Jean-Luc and Wilden, Eva (eds), *South Indian Horizons*, IFP Pondicherry, Pondicherry. 64-84.

  

The term means 'master' and in that sense matches with the colloquial Hindi term 'महाराज' used for both temporal as well as spiritual master. The Tamil term, in its widest usage, matches the Bengali term 'ṭhākura' which not only means spiritual or temporal master, but stands for god as well as for his image in the temple.  

  

Therefore this term is to be understood as a Tamil term with parallels in other Indian languages.  

  

Nammāḻvār merely means 'our āḻvār'.  

  

Hope this helps,
