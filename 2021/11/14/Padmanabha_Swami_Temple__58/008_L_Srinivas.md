\> The poet of the famous ‘Mukund Mala’ stotram was Shri Rajasekhar. Was he a king or Alwar?

  

The Mukundamala is attributed to Kulasekara Azhwar. I don't know who this 'Rajasekhar' is.  

  

You may want to read a general work on the Tamil Vaishnava saints. Try 'Early History of Vaishnavism in South India' by S Krishnaswamy Aiyangar. I think it may be available in archive. There could be other more recent works available in the market.
