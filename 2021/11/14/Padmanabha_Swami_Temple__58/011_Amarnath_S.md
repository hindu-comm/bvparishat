Namaste to all,

  

 The life stories of the Alwars is really fascinating, and we get to know the depths of Bhakti which they dived into, and had a direct experience of Shriman Narayana.

  

 For those who know Kannada, there is a beautiful account of the lives of the Alwars by the famous Kannada writer, late Sri GP Rajarathnam, called Alwar Kathegalu, ಆಳ್ವಾರ್ ಕಥೆಗಳು. In this small book he gives a short account of their lives, and also an introduction to the Naalaayira Divya Prabandham which they have graced us with.

  

Thanks andregards

\- amar
