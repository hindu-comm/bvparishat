Have you explored their library. You can become a member and read

[Search Home (borilib.com)](https://borilib.com/repository)

I have a high resolution scan of a work printed in 1880, who will pay (even a Non Profit needs ways to be self sufficient right) publisher doesn't, reader will not, libraries who have rare books will not. One can clean things easily that not an issue but who will support for years is the issue.

  

That why on multiple threads I insist digitize the right way, from the start itself so that one doesn't keep digitizing what's already done. Digitizing is not ah hobby, do it with some flatbed scanner lying at home or think one can do with a cell phone. There are several valuable Sanskrit books done in a low non readable resolution. Many don't understand compression of images how digitizing should be done
