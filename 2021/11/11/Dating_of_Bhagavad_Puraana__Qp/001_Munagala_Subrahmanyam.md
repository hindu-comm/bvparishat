Respected sir ,

  

    Bhagavatam is of 10-11th century may be of historical aspects . I don't know about it . And I personally feel not to mix date and time of ancient scriptures . Instead of discussing on date and time going through the book helps. That's a better one which improves the bhakti jnana and vairagya.

  

In bhagavatam it's told that the buddha will born in future . कीकटेषु भविष्यति by that we may say it's written before buddha and another example shows some other time by which scholars themselves can't predict exact date and time . So I personally leave these date and time issues of scriptures .

  

Adi shankara mentioned vishnupurana shloka as mangala sloka of his gita bhashya. May be because of that people may have interest towards vishnupuranam. Secondly there are so many similarities exists between bhagavatam and alwars prabandhas.

  

I too wait for scholars responses on this because -

  

In the story of Ramanujacharya there exists a debate in a shala regarding the Rasa Panchadhyayi. It means the bhagavatam is definitely known to the persons of that time .
