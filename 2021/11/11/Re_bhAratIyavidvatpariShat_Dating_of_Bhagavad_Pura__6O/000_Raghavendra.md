Mahamahopadhyaya Dr. B N K Sharma has written a illuminating research article on the date of Bhagavata. I will share it with you later.

  

Thank you and Best regards,

Subject: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Dating of Bhagavad Puraana  
  
Dear Vidvaans,

I am curious to know the timelines for Bhagavata Puraana. Traditional accounts mention it to be written thousands of years ago,, however Google also says, that according to scholars(it doesn't mention, who are these scholars) its dated somewhere around 10th-11th century.A Sri Vaishvanava scholar told me that as per traditions, the Azhwars and SriVaishnava Acharyas used Vishnu Puraana as reference and not Bhagavatam. I've few questions and would be glad if vidwaans here can help to clarify.

  

1\. On what basis scholars come up with such a recent date of Bhagavatam

2\. Why would SriVaishnava Acharyas not use Bhagavada Puraana as reference

  

Pranaams

Aditya
