Namaste,

  

If a language has to become popular, the songs and movies of that language play a role.

  

With the advent of OTT platforms, movies and songs of many languages are becoming excessively popular.

  

It is in this context, we at S.A.T.T.V.A. - Samskritam Academy for Teacher's Training and Value Addition has attempted to enter people's playlist with a few Samskritam songs which has filmy tunes.

  

This is first song in the series. Kindly help this cause by spreading a word about the same
