Dear Sri Swaroop ji,

  

I did share this with several hundred people in various groups I am part of. I got some excellent comments so far, with people promising me that they have made the song part of their play list, too. Please keep up thegood work of producing more such inspiring songs. Songs with such values will enable us to play them freely around various people, and will help us propagate SamskRutam as widely as possible. I applaud SATTVA effort at such songs production.

  

Best Regards,  
  
Krishna
