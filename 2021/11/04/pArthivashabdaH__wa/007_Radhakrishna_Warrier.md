Takara (തകര) pronounced tagara is the Malayalam word for a shrub whose leaves are said to be eaten during famine conditions as during the monsoon season from June to August. “Tāḷum takarayum” (താളും തകരയും) is a phrase literally meaning tāḷ (a kind of wild taro) and Takara, and is used figuratively for low quality food eaten during famines. 

*Śabdatārāvali *gives the meaning of Takara in English as “Oval Leaved Cassia”. Some of the Sanskrit paryāya provided in *Śabdatārāvali* for Takara are dadrughnam, cakramarddakam, and uraṇyākham.
