Thanks for the proposals!  
  
दुर्वाचकयोगः in Kamasutra is not the term for a "tongue-twister"?

\[30\] употребление труднопроизносимы слов in Russian translation

Speaking in language that others don't understand - is a mistranslation itself, I believe.  
  

बद्ध is not apt. कुञ्च् goes by twist- but not the idea as in English.

कुञ्च् also (कोचति, कुञ्चति कुञ्चित) 1 To make crooked, bend or curve. -2 To move or go crookedly. -3 To make small, lessen. -4 To shrink, contract. -5 To go to or towards.

Direction--

1\. Tongue - रसना, रसनं, जिह्वा

2\. Difficult - असुकर, दुश्चर, कठिन, दुष्कर, दुःसाध्य, कष्ट. 2 गहन, विषम,

3\. pronunciation - उदीरणं speech- वाक्, वचः

  

So from combining them in different formats- we can have a set of words from which the easiest to say can be chosen.

  

Words suggested--

रसना-असुगमम् - (असुगमं will ensure that it is not about taste aspect of the tongue but pronunciation aspect)

जिह्वा-दुष्करम्

रसन-दुःसाध्यम् or विषमं etc.

  

Caution - Avoid रसना for the deergha might be misleading through the negation of the whole idea.

Suggestions---

We can add the pronunciation/speech if required at the end like-

रसना-असुगमवाक् -

जिह्वा-दुष्कर-वचनम्

रसन-दुष्करोदीरणम्"
