Respected list members,

  

How did calendars belonging to different places and religions around the world agree on what day of week is currently prevailing, without there being any astronomical basis for it?

  

Kindly let me know if you have come across any discussion on the same.

  

Thank you.

  

Regards

Pradyumna
