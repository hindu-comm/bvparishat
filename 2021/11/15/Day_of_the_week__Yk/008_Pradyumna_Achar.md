Another interesting point is that just as सूर्यसिद्धान्त sets रविवासरः to the beginning of सृष्टि, a Christian work also says the same - "But Sunday is the day on which we all hold our common assembly, because it is the first day on which God, having wrought a change in the darkness and matter, made the world" ( <https://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.ii.lxvii.html> )
