Thanks for the pointers, Dr. Saranathan Madam.

  

In the Janamejaya grants that you had referred to in dating of the Mahabharata, there are references to the day of week.  
स्वस्ति श्री जयाभ्युदये युधिष्ठिरशके प्लवङ्गाख्ये एकोननवतिवत्सरे
सहस्यमासीय अमावस्याम् **सौम्यवासरे** श्रीमन्महाराजाधिराजराजपरमेश्वरो
वीरप्रतापशाली कुरुकुलोद्भवो वैयाघ्रपादगोत्रजः श्रीजनमेजयभूपः …

However, that was the only part which was not matching with the date of Nov. 2 -3013 for this grant in your analysis, which you had attributed to scribal error. Could it be that सौम्यवासरः is indeed correct, as it was before the synchronization with the Western week day names? If that is true, it may be prudent to correct it back because vaara is very important for देशकालसङ्कीर्तन during daily aacharana ("वारादायुष्यवर्धनं"), in performance/non-preformance of activities such as क्षौर, for vratas such as मङ्गलगौरीव्रत etc.

  

Another problem is that even if it indeed a scribal error and we ignore that plate for the purpose of the weekday, how come the Beluru and Kuppagade grants of Jan 10, -3014 (भौमदिने) and Feb 20, -3014 (सोमदिने) match the Western names of weekdays of Tuesday and Monday when in 3014 BC there was no Western civilization?

  

On another point, if Sumerian/Babylonian influence led to the influence of the seventh day, which was that day, because all days have references in puranas much older than 2000 BC when they existed.

  

I will continue to try to find answers to these.

  

Regards

Pradyumna
