Dear Pradyumna ji,

  

Hope you have read my article on Hora - weekdayconnection given in my previous mail.

The determinationof the week day is done on the basis of the hora lord at the time of sunrise.

The Table I had given in that link shows howthe seven horas run continuouslyin a day - a view written by Valimiki in his Tamil verse found in the Sangam corpus of Purananuru - and how the hora at sunrise lending the name of the day can happen in places where there is equal day and night. This decisively reveals that this conceptwas developed by a peoplewho lived near the equator. The early reference appears in the Sangam works only.

  

Another inference of the hora-weekday concept is that it must have been developed only after all the planets were discovered. I have devoted two minor chapters in my recent book on the discovery of Saturn deduced from the story of Martanda and of Mercury from the Tara- Brihaspati- Soma story. The discovery happenedduring the Younger Dryas and the concepts were developedat the beginning of Holocene, 11,000 years ago. The usage / application was found only in the Vedic society. Lot of calendricelements have gone to the ancient Occident - such as the 60 times the 60 year cycle, 3600 year- Era matching with the phase of the oscillatory equinox and the seven planet conjunction followed by a deluge (Kali Yuga begin date) (Pages 62-63 in my book). Likewise, the weekday concept also must havegone over there. So, there is no scopefor "synchronization with the western week names" and usage of "Western names of week days" by us.

  

In the Janamejaya grant, the year number, year name, month and the eclipse have tallied. The year number, month, tithi and the weekday can match only once in every 420 years (LCM of 60, 12, 30, 7). The Kali year number (89th year) cannot repeat at all. So, the date is certain, and the only deviation was the Saumya vasara which was found to be Shukra vasara. This correction was not done on the basis of any western system, but by checking how the other calendric factors have tallied. We come across such errors in quite a few inscriptions of different time periods and judge the reliability of the dates by the way the other features have tallied.

  

I have used only the Indic calendardates for all the decipherment including those of Begur and Kuppagade inscriptions and given the corresponding date in the astronomical Gregorian calendarwhere zero year is added. Perhaps that caused an impression that I have used western calendar. In fact I have suggested that we must revert to expressing time in our system and I have used it in my book for the date of publication and under my signature.

  

Hope this clarifies.

Jayasree
