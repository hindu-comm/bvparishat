1. Can someone please explain how days of the week are calculated (including at what time exactly the day of the week changes, etc. along with examples) with reference to the following sloka?

वारप्रवृत्तिः प्राग्देशी क्षपार्थेभ्यधिके भवेत् \|

तद्देशान्तरनाडीभिः पश्चादूने विनिर्दिशेत् \|\| (Surya Siddhanta 1-66)

I looked in some of the English translations of Surya Siddanta books available in [archive.org](http://archive.org) and the explanation given in there was not clear (bit confusing) to me.



2. Other than the above sloka, are there any other sources in our shastras explaining the concept of ‘days of the week (वार)’ and how they are calculated?



3. Are there any references to ‘days of the week (वार)’ in our Puranas and Itihasas?
