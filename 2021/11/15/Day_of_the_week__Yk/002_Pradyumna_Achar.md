Thank you, Dr. Roy ji.

Though that article is somewhat related, my question is about how do we determine that today, i.e. 16th November 2021 is Tuesday?

  

Today is Tuesday, only because yesterday, 15th November was Monday. And how is 15th November a Monday? Because 14th is a Sunday, and so on. If we extrapolate this backwards, where do we get that "anchor" date where someone decided that let today be a "Wednesday" (for example)?

  

If someone in Europe came up with this anchor date, and similarly someone in India also came up with an anchor date independently, it's highly unlikely that they would match (given that as per the European anchor, it was a Sunday on the day-before-yesterday, the probability that the Indian anchor results in a भानुवासरः for the day-before-yesterday is 1/7).

  

So there are these possibilities:

1\. There was only one anchor date, the Indian one, which spread to the rest of the world somehow, before which they didn't have the concept of week days

2\. There was only one anchor date, a non-Indian one, which came to India somehow, before which we didn't have this concept of week days

3\. There were independent anchor dates throughout the world, and after invasions, the days were adjusted and skipped to match the invader's anchor by matching similarly sounding names.

4\. The unlikely event (of probability 1/7) actually happened, across the world, which makes it exponentially unlikely (1/7 for india-europe \* 1/7 for indians and jews \* 1/7 for europeans-chinese etc).
