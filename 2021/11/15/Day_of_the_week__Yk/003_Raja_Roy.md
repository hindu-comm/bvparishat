Dear Pradyumna ji,

Your questions are worthy of further investigation. It seems to me that the seven day weeks originated outside India. Vedic texts have six day weeks called "shadaaha" instead of saptaaha.

Sumerians and Babylonians used a 7 day week.

So atsomepoint in post-Vedic period 7 day week wasincorporated in the panchanga.

Synchronization of weekdays could have happened as late as British rule. I am not sure.

Regards,

Raja
