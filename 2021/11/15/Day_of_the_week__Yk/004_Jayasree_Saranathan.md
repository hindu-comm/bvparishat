The hora at sunrise determines the week day. The methodology is possible only near the equator where there is equal day and night. So the conceptmust have emerged at SE Asia / submerged olden lands of 1st Tamil Sangam which I propose as ancestral to the Vedic society. Explained the probable routes from that location in the discussion board of my Cosmic- hit paper in [academia.edu](http://academia.edu) in which Pradyumna ji also participated. Request him to check the discussion. Specific skills and concepts such as hora / week day must have spread through those routes to Eurasia at the beginning of Holocene.

  

Explained here also: here<https://jayasreesaranathan.blogspot.com/2013/05/is-vedic-astrology-derived-from-greek_13.html>

Jayasree
