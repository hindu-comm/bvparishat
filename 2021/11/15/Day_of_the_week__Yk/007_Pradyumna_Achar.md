Minor update on this topic:

  

I found an insightful paper - "Ahargana and Weekdays as per Modern Suryasiddhanta" by Sri. A. K. Bag in Indian Journal of History of Science, 36.1-2 (2001) pp 55-63, available at
<http://insa.nic.in/writereaddata/UpLoadedFiles/IJHS/Vol04_1And2_14_SPBhattacharyya.pdf>

  

The epoch date (which I was referring to as "anchor date" in this thread due to not knowing the proper term) is set to the beginning of सृष्टि (at 1,955,880,000 years before the beginning of Kali yuga). This epoch date is by axiom to be a रविवासरः, from which the other days follow sequentially. It is very interesting that it coincides with the non-Indian weekday known as Sunday.

  

Regards

Pradyumna
