At MIT School of Vedic Sciences Pune, we have been experimenting teaching Bharatiya shaastric concepts of aesthetics to non-Sanskrit audience in an intuitive and appealing way - for budding creative professionals (design, architecture, fine arts etc) - following the footsteps of Maanya Dr. Nagaraj Paturi gaaru, a master in this style.  

  

Dr. Anupama Ryali has evolved a teaching style that inspired numerous young students over the last couple of years. She is offering a week-long online workshop for teachers based on her experience.

  

Here is the program. We'd like to invite junior teachers of Saahitya to this workshop.

The details are below.

We request senior aacharyas to bless our fledgling efforts at re-contextualizing Indic scientific knowledge.  

  

Regards,
