"on the theory (and practice) of composing Indian music (Classical - Carnatic)"  

Would like to bring your attention to a work by Maharaja Swathitirunal,

which is seldom referred to.

The work is ***Muhana prAsa anthya prAsa vyavastha***

Availability of which is to be confirmed.

But the work is exactly on the principles to be followedby a composer of classical kritis.

*Prof. Sivakumar*
