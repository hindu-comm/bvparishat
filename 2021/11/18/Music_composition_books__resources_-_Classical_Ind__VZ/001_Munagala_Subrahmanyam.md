Yes sir. There are traditional resources for musical compositions . I don't know about the source of Hindustani but in Carnatic its there . SANGEETA RATNAKARAM , BHARATA MUNI NATYA SASTRA , SARANGADHRA SAMHITA ,etc . Were there . Some musicians in tamilnadu still teaching some parts i feel .

Please consult any chennai music scholar for that traditional resources . That might be helpful for you sir .

  
Even in our group there is madam namely Mrudula Ashwin . She is a Sanskrit cum music scholar . I hope her opinion gives more topic oriented points than me .

  

Thank you sir.
