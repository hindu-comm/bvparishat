There are humongous number of books that way.

  

But if you are interested in music pedagogical literature for teaching music, the Carnatic music pedagogy , that is attributed to Purandara Dasa is available in the form of contemporary Carnatic course books, whichis a documentation of an oral paramparaa.

  

But that is for learning to sing or play carnatic music from the scratch.

  

The shaastra granthas like Sangeetaratnakara which are very rich in number and content analyse the art of Sangeeta , vocal and instrumental.
