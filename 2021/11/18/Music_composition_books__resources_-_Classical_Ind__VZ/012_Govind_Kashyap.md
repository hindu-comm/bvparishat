Mridula garu, thank you for responding with your thoughts and insights.

  

*"In our system of training, a music student is trained and taught to perfect his vocal rendition (or instrument), the rudiments of classical music (sruthi/swaras/laya etc.,), the various ragas, and compositions in those ragas. The focus is on imbibing the sruthi-raga-taala (not to mention the sAhityabhAva - be it Bhakti/ShRngAra/or any other) aspects even when learning hundreds of compositions, but not on how to compose. "*

*"It is more to do with years of engaging with the art-form (sAdhanA), and the multiple disciplines associated with it (vastvantarajnAna), and/or due to pratibhA (accrued from pUrvajanma), or in some cases, by divine intervention."*

  

Your point appears to be that in the Indian approach to music, composition is not treated of separately, and composition is learnt by a process of absorption or a kind of osmosis. You learn and immerse yourself in rAga-s, tAla-s , your practice, etc, and your compositional intuition or sense (or mental muscles) get an indirect workout and before you know (that you know) you know (composition, among other things - never alone or independently - that seems to be the hallmark of our approach). Let's call this as the "integral" or "circular" approach.

  

The Western approach, on the other hand, is more "linear", "piecemeal" - you start with notations, "reading" music (notes etc) and then progress to the other parts, when it comes to composing. Integration with the other aspects of music happens "off-classroom", as it were, "deliberately". This is the sense I get, at least.

  

I rather think the Indian approach makes musical performers of (wo)men, while the western approach makes musical professionals of them. The success of the Indian approach is to be found in the several celebrated doyens of the gharana-s in the North and the venerated saints-composers-singers in the South, who cared not for anything but their music, finding the Ultimate - God - in it. The success of the West is exemplified more in the popular scene over the past few decades and, as one example, in the recent rise of the Swedish musicians.

  

The Western approach seems to more in tune with the needs and realities of life, and hence seems to be dominant today. It is the core of the professional circles and is a big part of the popular scene in India as well, imo. In fact, I'd make so bold as to include the two major contemporary composers of India, Ilayaraja and Rahman, in the Western scheme of things, despite there being a heavy (Tamil) folk influence in Ilayaraja's compositions alongwith the outright Carnatic, while in Rahman we find the eclectic and the catholic mixing with his western compositional spine. He has never never forsaken his western core.
