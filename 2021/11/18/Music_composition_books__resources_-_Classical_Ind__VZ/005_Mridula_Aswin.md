Namaste,

Kashyap ji, you have raised an interesting question, one which does not find much room for discussion in the Indian classical music scenario, as much as it gets in the West. Thank you for bringing it up here.  

  

I feel that it primarily has to do with the nature of classical music in the West, where the possibility for improvisation is explored until the composition is created by the musician. Then it is presented by the musical ensemble. Whereas, in Indian classical music, as far as mainstream performances are concerned, compositions already composed by Vaaggeyakaaras, (others or self) like Bandish, Khayal, Krithi, Varnam etc, are not just presented as they are, but are also embellished further with impromptu improvisation by way of Alapana, Taan, Neraval, Swarakalpana and so on. In our system of training, a music student is trained and taught to perfect his vocal rendition (or instrument), the rudiments of classical music (sruthi/swaras/laya etc.,), the various ragas, and compositions in those ragas. The focus is on imbibing the sruthi-raga-taala (not to mention the sAhityabhAva - be it Bhakti/ShRngAra/or any other) aspects even when learning hundreds of compositions, but not on how to compose. Notwithstanding this, there are many contemporary musicians who are ace composers too. I am saying this from how it is in practice.  

  

Coming to shAstra granthas on music, some of which have been mentioned earlier by Sri MVS Prasad garu, a lot of discussion has gone into what are the guNa-doShas of a composition, which of them can be classified as uttama/madhyama/adhama, and what are the types of compositions, their characteristics and so on.  

  

However, as is the case with many other fields of art in the BhAratIya paddhati, whether the vaaggeyakaara actually did a course on the 'Art of Music Composition' before composing (on a lighter note) , is really not so tough a question. It is more to do with years of engaging with the art-form (sAdhanA), and the multiple disciplines associated with it (vastvantarajnAna), and/or due to pratibhA (accrued from pUrvajanma), or in some cases, by divine intervention.

  

Looking forward to any further insights that can be shared by the venerable scholars in this group.

  

  

Warm Regards,
