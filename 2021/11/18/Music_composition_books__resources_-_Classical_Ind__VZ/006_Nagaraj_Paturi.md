There is no place for new composition in Indian classical music, a vaaggeyakaaracan not compose his new composition.

  

A vaaggeyakaarais also a musician like other musicians albeita great one, of course.

  

New swarakalpana to a text of a kriti/song keeps getting done by Indian classical musicians even today.

  

Some like Dr Balamuralikrishna did swarakalpana to their own texts. He did his own swarakalpana to some kritis for which swarakalpana was not available earlier.

  

Why, entire kritis of Annamacharya had to be given new swarakalpana because tradition of their singing became extinct by the time the copper plates on which the kritis were preserved were discovered. TTD initiated a very big project that included swarakalpana to the kritis.

  

The impression that performers sing only the already composed songs with only some amount of manodharma here and there comes because of the traditionally well established compositions.

  

This is not unique to Indian classical music. Even in western pop(ular) music, a song that becomes popular with a particular composing remains with that composition almost for ever. The audience too are able to join the singer on the stage when that song is sung only because the composing in it is so well settled.

  

That is the nature of the art of music in general. Not a unique feature of Indian classical music.

  

Because of some misunderstanding, some youngsters are thinking that Indian classical music is all about learning and singing the same old compositions again and again for ever.

  

After switching to film music singing and western music singing, they realize that there too they have to sing only a composition that is already composed by others.
