Thank you Nagaraj garu.

  

*"There is no place for new composition in Indian classical music, a vaaggeyakaaracan not compose his new composition. "*

*

*"That is the nature of the art of music in general. Not a unique feature of Indian classical music. "*  

  

Composition is mostly regurgitation, then. Inspired regurgitation, but regurgitation nonetheless. Old wine in new bottle. And I am inclined to agree with your assessment. There is nothing new under the Sun.

  

However, something interesting, from Sun Tzu's*The Art of War* -
*"There are not more than five primary colors (blue, yellow, red, white, and black), yet in combination they produce more hues than can ever been seen. There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard."*
