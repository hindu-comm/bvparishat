Thank you Sri Nagaraj garu

  

Let me try to explain what I need help with. I want to learn the fundamentals and principles of composing music - in both the Carnatic and Hindustani streams, which I consider to be basically one tradition, despite some differences. That I imagine would no doubt require pedagogical materials, pertaining to both traditions, to begin with at least. Such pedagogical material may take the form of books or other instructive resources -

  

\(a\) modern, a la/similar to the various books etc available on western music theory, art of composition etc,

\(b\) traditional, like the texts Sri Munagala Subrahmanyam and yourself mentioned  

  

I suppose such books and resources would take the form of course books, instructive and/or compilational material on the foundations of Indian music - rAga, tAla etc, and the principles and practices of compositions using these foundations.

  

I am sure the traditional way of going about this is not via self-study but through an instructor. Then there is the option of going for a formal degree in music at one of the universities also.

  

But since I already have acquaintance with Indian classical music, being formally qualified in playing an instrument, I think I can at least begin my music composition studies independently to start with, and seek help from instructors in due course. Now I may be wrong in assuming so, and handing oneself over to an instructor may perhaps be easier, if slower. But I think self-paced self-study could be given a shot here, as my interest is fairly sharp and not broad - I am looking not to learn to sing or play an instrument, but to compose music. My interest is theoretical and fundamental, and I think if I can get the reqd resources, I can understand faster on my own.
