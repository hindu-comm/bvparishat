Namaste to all,

  

I am looking for books and other resources on the theory (and practice) of composing Indian music (Classical - Carnatic & Hindustani).

  

In my searches, all I am getting are Western classical resources. There is a singular lack of books etc on Indian music composition theory to my knowledge.

  

I request members to consider recommending me books (primarily) in this regard. Also, may I ask if there are there any formal courses also reg Indian music composition in colleges, conservatories or universities.

  

(I have found AR Rahman, Shankar Mahadevan to be running their own institutions. The Madras Academy of Music is there, as also a conservatory in Bengaluru. Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai have western music conservatories.)

  

I am particularly interested in learning about the fundamentals and principles of composing music in both the Carnatic and Hindustani traditions. (May I also mention here that I have a diploma in Hindustani tabla from the Prayag Sangeet Samiti.)

  

Any guidance would be gratefully received.

  

with thanks

G Kashyap
