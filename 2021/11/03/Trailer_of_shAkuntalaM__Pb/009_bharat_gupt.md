Thankyou for your email response. The Sanskrit scholars and departments as you rightly observe , treat classical Indian plays as just readable book form material. Also all over India they teach and treat these plays just as the English departments teach Shakespeare.

Eng Dept exam question:

"Write a note on the character of Ophelia in Hamlet."

Sanskrit Dept :

."...........on Shakuntala in Abhijnanashakuntalam"

  

As I was often exam question paper moderator at DU, I saw this for umpteen years.

Now of course they often inject a feminist perspective. But sadly so all language departments in India are the English department.
