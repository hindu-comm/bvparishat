Dear Friends,

I am eagerly awaiting to see this film. But from all the advertisements made by the film makers it seems that this film is perpetuating certain distortions about ancient Indian theatre which was initiated by Europeans in the 19th century and which our Sanskrit scholars are repeating although they are all knowledgeable enough and know the truth.

  

Please tell me if you disagree:

  

1\. Ancient plays were a mixture of Sanskrit and Prakrit dialogues and Songs. Only about 25 per cent Sanskrit and the rest was Prakrit.

  

2\. All Dhruva songs (not written by Kavi but inserted by producers) were in Prakrit. In the total performance of each play there were more songs in Prakrit than the pathya or dialogues.

  

3\. Europeans like Keith and Levi overlooked all this and called the plays SANSKRIT DRAMA.

( please quote if any Indian writer called it so before 19th century).

  

4\. Resurgent Indian Nationalism and our great Sanskrit scholars and savants like (ok, I won't name them) never revealed the truth. Ah !! how to say there was no 'Sanskrit drama' if others had Greek drama, English drama and so forth.

  

5\. Ancient Indian drama was a rare in the world multilingual drama like the Indian society which we converted into Sanskrit drama.

  

6\. While the real performing art forms like Kathakali Bailalata Svanga continued to be multilingual, the pundits revived it as Sanskrit drama. This film has made some small inclusions of Telugu and Avadhi songs but nothing more. It falls in line with the interests of Sanskrit academies and departments as against the interests of the ancient art of Natya based on Natya as lokanukriti and lokasankirtana.

  

Why can dialogues of an ancient play not be in modern Indian Prakrits or languages? Is that against the dramaturgy given in Natyashastra?

  

May be I am possessed of too many idiosyncrasies !!!

  

With regards,

BG
