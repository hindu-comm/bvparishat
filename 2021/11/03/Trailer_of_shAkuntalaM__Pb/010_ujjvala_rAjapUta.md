का॒व्यान्यप्यु॑च्चारयित॒व्या॑न्ये॒व स॑न्ति। तथा॒ वेदा॒ अपि॑। न च॑ भा॒ष्या॑णि॒ कृती॑ना॒म् मुख्य॑म् आ॒स्वाद॑नं॒ सङ्ग॑न्तुय्ँ युज्यन्ते। तानि॑ दी॒र्घम् अर्था॒न् रक्षि॑तुञ्चा॒स्वाद॑नायान्यद्वस्तु॒त्वेन॑ च कल्प्यन्ते। तान्यपि॑ प्रा॒येणा॑श्राव्यन्त॒ पूर्वे॒ इति॑ मन्ये॒ऽ॒न्यस्त्व१॒॑यव्ँ वि॑ष॒यः।  

  

Kāvya, especially the older ones are meant to be performed (sang aloud), too. So are the Vedas. Commentaries are not meant to accompany the primary consumption of texts, but are created (1) to preserve the understood meanings over long periods of time; and (2) to serve as another layer of composition to be enjoyed. I imagine that in traditional settings even commentaries would have most often been listened to rather than read individually, but that's a different matter altogether.
