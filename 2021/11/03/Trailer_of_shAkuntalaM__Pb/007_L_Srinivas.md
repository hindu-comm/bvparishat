Well said, Prof Gupt. As always, there are many points to ponder in your brief message.

  

One thing also which I've found is Sanskrit plays are considered texts meant to be \*read\* and are taught as such. Since these are in the Sanskrit curriculum, multilingual aspects get ignored. Whether it's Kale or the traditional commentator whom he paraphrases, there's not a huge amount of distinction made between a kavya commentary and a natya commentary. The commentaries are learned and therefore prolix, so they interfere at times with the reader's understanding of what is essentially a performing art. Certainly, some aspects of what ails our understanding of Sanskrit drama seem to have predated European influence too.
