ET Now Swadesh, a newly launched business TV channel in Hindi, interviewed me and Eika Chaturvedi Banerjee onLakṣmīDevī. The programme was aired on ET Now Swadesh today evening at 5 pm. The entire programme (in Hindi) is now available on YouTube. Please watch and leave your comments.

Unfortunately, around half of what I spoke, with several citations from Sanskrit texts, was edited out as the final time slot was 30 minutes. I am trying to get the full unedited footage from the channel and will share if I get it.

  

Thanks, Nityānanda
