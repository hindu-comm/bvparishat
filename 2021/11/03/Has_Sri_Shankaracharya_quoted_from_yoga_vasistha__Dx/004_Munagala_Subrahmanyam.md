Sir ,

   I feel it as unnecessary . There is no rule that every book can be quoted. People say about shankara as SHRUTI,SMRUTI , PURANA NAM AALAYAM ....... etc.

  

Even there are so many shakhas of Vedas not even 2-3 sentences from every sakha was quoted by shankara .

He took the suitable one as pramanam and quoted it .

Same like purana and smruti vakyas in bhashya grandhas .

  

Some similarities between yoga vasista and shankara writings will be definitely there .

Like

माता नास्ति पिता नास्ति बन्धु सहोदराः ।  

यमस्य करुणा नास्ति तस्मातज्जाग्रत जाग्रत ।। yoga vasista

  

का ते कांता कस्ते पुत्रः संसारोयमतीव विचित्रः ।

कस्यत्वं कः कुत आयातः तत्त्वं चिन्तय तदिह भ्रातः ।। Bhajagovindam .

  

Like some similarities exists between them.

  

  

The respect towards RAMAYANAM AND BHAGAVATAM also exists . The respect is different of the relevance of bhashyas .

In brahmasutras purana ideology will be rejected yet the respect towards puranam exists.

  

Even vedam also rejected by shankara at utmost part of advaita . Which is available in the madhaveeya shankara vijaya BHATTA BHASKARA - SHANKARA SAMVADA sarga . It doesn't mean that vedas were opposed by shankara.

  

After having a study of both yoga vasista and shankara granthas you will understand the similarities definitely.

  

Sorry for inconvenience if any.

  

Thank you.
