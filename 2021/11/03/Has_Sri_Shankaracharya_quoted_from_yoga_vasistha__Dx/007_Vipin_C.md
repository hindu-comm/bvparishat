NamasteKrishna Ji,

  

As Sri Raghavendra pointed out--this question is a bit out of place knowing what Sri Krishna or Sri Bhagawanuvacha in the 10th chapter of Srimad-Bhagavad Gita: Sapta Rishis, including Vashistha appeared from the "manasha' or "mind"महर्षय: सप्त पूर्वे चत्वारो मनवस्तथा \|

मद्भावा मानसा जाता येषां लोक इमा: प्रजा: \|\| 6\|\|.

Do we really need to compare what Sri Bhagawan is saying vs.Rishis. In different contexts both ought to be respected. But for knowing the ultimate reality I personally will follow what Sri Krishna says in BG 15.15--"Sarvasya chaahamhrudi..." At the same time one of our great Acharyas, like Sri Shankaracharya we as Hindus owe everythingas who brought back the Sanatana Dharma and who is an incarnation of Shiva as we know. Our great acharyas come at different times with different purposes in mind and speak or quote different aspects from shrutis-smritis-puranas depending upon the contexts. One "saadhu" once pointed out to me that these days "aadhyaatma" has become like a buffet and we take whatever food we like based upon our taste and not caring about whether it is good or not or what has been prescribed. As far as which is ancient etc are concerned ----in BG., Sri Krishna says, that I have spoken this earlier to Vivaswaan -the Sun God.
