<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga_Vasistha#Chronology>  

Atreya in 1935 suggested that the text must have preceded[Gaudapada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaudapada "Gaudapada")and[Adi Shankara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Shankara "Adi Shankara"), because it does not use their terminology, but does mention many Buddhist terms.^([\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga_Vasistha#cite_note-chappleixf-6))Dasgupta, a contemporary of Atreya, states that the text includes verses of earlier text, such as its III.16.50 is identical to one found in Kalidasa's Kumarasambhava, thus the text must be placed after the 5th-century.^([\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga_Vasistha#cite_note-chappleixf-6))Dasgupta adds that the philosophy and ideas presented in Yoga Vasistha mirror those of found in[Advaita Vedanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta "Advaita Vedanta")of Adi Shankara, but neither mention the other, which probably means that the author(s) of Yoga Vasistha were scholars who lived in the same century as Shankara, placing the text in about 7th- to early 8th-century.^([\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga_Vasistha#cite_note-chappleixf-6))
