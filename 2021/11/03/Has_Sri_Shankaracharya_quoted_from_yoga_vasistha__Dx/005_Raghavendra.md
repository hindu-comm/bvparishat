Greetings of the day,

  

Curious to know how respectability of a body of text is decided.

  

If I were to use an example,

  

The ^Special Theory of Relativity^ was written in the year 1905 by Sir Albert Einstein,

  

The ^Principia Mathematica^ was written in the year 1687 by Sir Isaac Newton,

  

Is it good to adjudge that,

  

^The Principia Mathematica^ is "more respectable" than ^The Special Theory of Relativity^because the former was written much earlier in times to the latter.

  

Srimad-Bhagavadgeetaa and Brahma Meemaamsaa Shaastra is less respectable is highly disturbing and unnerving,

  

May I humbly request avoid use of such demeaning and disparaging words on a platform like BVP which trying it's best to ensure pristine glory of our ancient learning as a whole.

  
Thank you and Best regards,
