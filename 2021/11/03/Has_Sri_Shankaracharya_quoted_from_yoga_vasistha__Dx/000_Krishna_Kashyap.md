Has Sri Shankaracharya quoted from yoga vasistha?  

  

Where was it mentioned? Please give some reference from prasthAna traya bhashya or prakarana granthas.

  

My friend told me YogavAsistha is ancient (from rAmaAvatara times).

Hence it follows that it is more respectable than Gita / bramha sutras.

  

If that is true, Sri Shankaracharya would not have missed the opportunity to quote from a source text.
