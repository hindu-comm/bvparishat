This passage from मैत्रायणीयारण्यकं declares the Sun as the origin of time -

अथान्यत्राप्युक्तम् अन्नं वा अस्य सर्वस्य योनिः, कालश्चान्नस्य, सूर्यो योनिः कालस्य । तस्यैतद्रूपं, यन्निमेषादिकालात् सम्भृतं द्वादशात्मकं वत्सरम् एतस्याग्नेयम् अर्धम्, अर्धं वारुणम् । MA (6.14)  

  

\> Any pointers for the division of time measurements in earlyVedic literature wouldalso be helpful.

  

I would like to share this recent paper on ancient time measurement, accessible at[Indian Journal of History of Science](https://bit.ly/2XGFE2W)\|\|[Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348501311_Aksara_the_Basic_Unit_of_Time_Measure_in_Ancient_India)\|\|[Academia](https://www.academia.edu/44909499/Ak%E1%B9%A3ara_the_Basic_Unit_of_Time_Measure_in_Ancient_India)

Abstract

In this paper after a brief review of ancient Indian time units, the ingenious method of Indian astronomers for calibrating the small time unit of*vighaṭikā*(24 seconds) phonetically by the recitation of a Sanskrit verse in the*līlākhelā*meter with sixty*gurvakṣara*s, is experimentally verified by sixty independent sample recitations. This is followed by exploring the concept of congruence of*akṣara*count and time periods such as the month and the year in Vedic texts. This leads to the symbolic equivalence of the*bṛhatī*meter of 36 syllables to the Year and several other numerical synchronies between phenomenal time and*akṣara*. The 1000*bṛhatī*verses of the*prātaranuvāka*nocturnal performance in the*atirātra*ritual is the traceable most ancient origin and inspiration for gauging and estimating lapse of time by recognizing audible syllable as a time measure. To verify this, apart from text based theoretical estimates, real time information from a famous*śrauta*expert on his*prātaranuvāka*performance is presented. It is further demonstrated empirically that the rate of 3600*gurvakṣara*per*ghaṭikā*of*siddhānta*astronomy is closely correlated with the speed of present day traditional chanting of the*Ṛgveda*, the fidelity of which has remained stable over millennia.
