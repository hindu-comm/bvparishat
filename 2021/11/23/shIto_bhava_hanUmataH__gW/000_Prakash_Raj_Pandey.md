Pranam to all learned scholars,  
  
When Sita is told that Hanuman's tail has been set ablaze and he is being taken round the city of Lanka, Sita prays to Agni--

  

यद्यस्ति पतिशुश्रूषा यद्यस्ति चरितं तपः ।

यदि वा त्वेकपत्नीत्वंशीतोभव हनूमतः ॥  
  
After reading this -- I wondered in which विभक्ति is हनूमतः -- पञ्चमी or षष्ठी ? Here त्वं हनूमतः शीतो भव -- may be translated as -- Please be cool to Hanuman.

  

Now I am more or less certain that hereहनूमतः is in षष्ठी, and we can construct sentences similar to -- त्वं हनूमतः शीतो भव

  
Am I right?  
  
Best regards  
प्रकाशः
