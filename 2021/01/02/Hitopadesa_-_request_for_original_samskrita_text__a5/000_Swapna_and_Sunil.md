Hari OM dear teachers,

  

I had a quick question - would anyone of you have the original samskrita text of the Hitopadesa? The scans I found on archive were not of a good quality and I did not find the original text on the sanskrit documents site.

  

Any leads most appreciated.

  

Respectfully,

  

Sunil
