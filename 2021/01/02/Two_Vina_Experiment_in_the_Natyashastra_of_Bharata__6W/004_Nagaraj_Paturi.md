Dear Prof. Nagaraj,

  

Thanks for the communication.

  

I request Shree Bharat ji Gupt to have close reading of my monograph on shrutis. The monograph provides explanation to all the issues raised. I am aware about Acharya Brihaspati ji's work. I also referred to it in my research. After thorough review of existing literature on shrutis I decided that one needs to conduct the Shruti-Nidarshanam experiment and empirically verify the facts. Therefore, I designed and made a Veena by myself (and named it Bharat Veena) and conducted the experiment. The result is that the Shruti-Nidarshanam experiment is successful only if the shrutis are equal. It fails with unequal shrutis. Existence of 22 shrutis in a Grama is possible if and only if they are equal in temperament. If you perform the experiment with unequal shrutis then the number of shrutis involved/generated in the experiment is always more than 22. Depending on the unequal ratios- sometimes it is 26 or 28 or even 31. The number 22 is sacrosanct in the Natyashastra. Thus to remain true to the description from the Natyashastra we need to accept the existence of equal shrutis.

  

I discussed this with many experts. They agree with my results but still they get perplexed because the contemporary practices still believein unequal shrutis (though there is no conclusive scientific or scriptural evidence for unequal shrutis).
