The two vina experiment (shruti निदर्शन) clearly shows that 22 Shruti are NOT EQUAL BUT OF THREE DIFFERENT MEASURES.

Shree Vinod Vidwans presumed that they are equal, without giving any pramana from Natyashastra. Similarly, he is not

sure how to establish the basic septette or saptak for a vina. He does not demonstrate how to do it. For him Shrutis make svaras. They are original sounds. All this is without any shastra pramana as well as common sense musicology. Svaras are the original sounds. Natural consonances. They are divided into micro tones not the other way around.



Mr. Iyengar created a needless confusion about aadhaar shruti.

There was no drone in ancient music. It is a medieval phenomenon. How can you have a drone when the tonic is shifted with every different melody?

No instrument can provide drone from sa to ni.

  

Nearly all modern people do not understand that there was no danda vina in ancient times from Egypt to China, but ONLY HARPS with strings made of guts not capable of much tightening or loosening. Hence there was no fixed string for a note. The same string was designated as the first note of a chosen murcchanaa or a chosen seven note sequence. Hence any of the seven note became tonic.

  

For a detail understanding please see my translation of chapter 28. of NS.
