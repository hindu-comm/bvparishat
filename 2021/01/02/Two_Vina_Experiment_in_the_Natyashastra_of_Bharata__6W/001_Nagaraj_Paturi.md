Dear Prof. Nagaraj,

  

Thanks for the reference. I am aware of Mr. Bernard Bell's work. However, as you know, my monograph- The Doctrine of Shruti in Indian Music, addresses all the outstandingissues related to shrutis. My website at



<http://computationalmusic.com/22-Shruti-music.php>

  

has the above mentioned monograph and two other relevant articles for download. They can download and refer to these documents. However, I am also attaching the monograph and these articles with this email for reference.

  

I agree with Prof. R. N. Iyengar's views about *Aadharashruti*. In the *Natyashastra* the *Shadja swara* is treated as a base or tonic as well as a variable especially in the context of *Moorchchhanas*. Renderingof such a variable *Shadja* or *Bhinna Shadja* is very difficult without the reference *shruti* or *Aadharashruti,*though we do not have any explicit reference of drone instruments in *Natyashastra*, like we use Tambura or Tanapura today.

  

  

With Warm Regards

  

Vinod Vidwans
