Dear Colleague,

Dr. Bernard Bel(Aix-Marseille University, France) has an interesting article on the subject line.

<https://bolprocessor.org/two-vina-experiment/>

His perspective is likely to be of interest to persons working on the history of Indian Music in relation to Mathematics in India.

However, his statement that the drone ( ādhāraśruti ) was not known in ancient times is factually incorrect, even though it is difficult to say  

when this became the basis of Rāgaof classical music. After my preprint (Academia.edu) on "Concept of Probability...," I have revised the paper and traced some links between Vedic sāmagāna and later music. In particular,

"...The concept of the *ādhāraśruti* can be traced to the one or more supporting singers (*upagāyaka)* who would be holding continuously the *mandrasvara* (low pitch) *Om-kāra* as support to the *sāmagāna* in Vedic sacrifices. The main singer started the *sāmagāna* at three *śruti* levelabove this basic note.
