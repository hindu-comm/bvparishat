Indic Book Club is being incubated by Indic Academy as a platform for book lovers ([www.indicbookclub.com](http://www.indicbookclub.com)).

IBC is building a community of readers interested in our civilisational history and knowledge and promoting authors who intellectually and emotionally belong to our civilisation. Apart from being a platform for readers to add, review, share books and engage with other members, IBC has been actively promoting Indic Authors and books through its give away program. Since its launch in 2015, IBC has given away over 9000 books.

IBC is now pleased launch a ‘Buy me a Book’ scheme to encourage research in the areas of Shastras, Indology and Indic Knowledge Systems. Most academic books in these domains published overseas are expensive and remain out of reach for an independent scholar, public intellectual or a research student, not having access to an institutional library or support.

In order to support such research endeavours, IBC is pleased to launch a ‘Buy me a Book’ scheme.Under this scheme, any scholar, student or committed public intellectual can write to us with the name of the academic book they wish to read or refer for their research. After a quick review of the request by our curator Abhinav Agarwal, IBC will buy the same and have it delivered them as a loan. Once the research is done the same may be returned to IBC for usage by others.

Those interested may please write to us along with their profile and a brief note on the need for a particular book for their area of research at [bo...@indica.org.in]()
