"Thus, it may be valid to say that there can be a Brahmanical Hinduism but not to say that Hinduism is Brahmanical as this statement misrepresents Hinduism. The situation in this case is not very different from the one we encounter in the case of other religions. It seems valid to say that there is a jihadist Islam, but if one were to describe Islam itself as jihadist one would be overstating the case. One could identify what one might call Christian imperialism, but to identify Christianity with imperialism would be misleading."
