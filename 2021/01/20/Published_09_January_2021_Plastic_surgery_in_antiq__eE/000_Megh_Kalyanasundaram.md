**Abstract**: "Though the industrial era (1750 to 1914 AD) and the world wars (1914 to 1945 AD) were the catalysts for the establishment of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery as a specialty in its own right, a careful examination of ancient texts and literature reveals that those conditions generally attributed to the craft were recognised and treated as early as 3000 BC. This article examines the remarkable medical documents of ancient civilisations as they pertain to our specialty and their legacies in the modern world. A comprehensive review of medical, medical humanities, and history databases (PubMed; MEDLINE; Web of Knowledge; Anthropology; Encyclopedia of ancient history) and non-digital printed texts was conducted using multiple search terms and filters including Reconstruction; Plastic Surgery; Ancient Surgery; Burns; Flaps; Sutures; and Dressings. The search was restricted to publications that focused on the period between 3100 BC and 476 AD. Additional information was sought from an eminent scholar of the Vedic period as well as the chief librarian of the Kaiser Library to aid in the identification of provenance. Five ancient periods and associated manuscripts were identified. Our specialty draws its earliest roots from antiquity. Reconstructive procedures used today were described in ancient eras indicating that the practice of plastic surgery is as old as surgery itself."
