अलङ्कारशास्त्रविदो बहवस्तारका इव ।

रसवर्षाक्षमस्त्वेको यथा रविस्तथा कविः ॥”

\[There are many who might know the theory of poetry, just as there are many stars. But just as the sun is the only one who can cause a shower of rasa (water), likewise the poet is the only one who can cause a shower of rasa (aesthetic enjoyment).\]
