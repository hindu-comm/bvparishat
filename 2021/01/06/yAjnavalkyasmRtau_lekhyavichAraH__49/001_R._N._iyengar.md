Dear Dr.Jagannatha,

I was wondering about Law Courts in ancient India when I was editing the NAradashilpa, which devotes one chapter on the layout plan of NItishAlA (Ch 64). Your article clarified a few points on why separate rooms were needed for writing and registering documents. Your comment is quite apt.

Your conclusion on PanjIkaraNa= Registration/Fixing if official would require some public/civic infrastructure.

I have not come across any text other than NAradashilpa that gives the details of the positions for the Jury, plaintiff and officials and the High Seat of Dharma for the King or his representative. Based on the description I was able to prepare a probable layout plan for the NItiShAlA in the main palace complex.

I have not yet matched textual statements from the NAradasmrtiand the YAjnavalkya.

Regards

RN Iyengar
