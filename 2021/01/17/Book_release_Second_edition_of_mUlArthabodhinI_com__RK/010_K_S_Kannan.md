Thank you Mr. Gasūns, for your kind words.

Sri Shreevatsa's brilliance is original. His mathematical abilities are way above average.

(Yes, he was my student too, at college.)  

Prof. Amba Kulkarni (also from mathematics) has high words of appreciation for his bright mind.

  

Mine is a different strain. I am but an apt example for  

Jack of all trades, master of none.

  

My creed proceeds on different lines. Luckily, somebody has composed a verse,  

taking pity on persons like me :  

श्रद्धा-यत्नौ यदि स्यातां

मेधया किं प्रयोजनम्? \|  

तावेव यदि न स्यातां

मेधया किं प्रयोजनम्? \|\|

Regards

KSKannan
