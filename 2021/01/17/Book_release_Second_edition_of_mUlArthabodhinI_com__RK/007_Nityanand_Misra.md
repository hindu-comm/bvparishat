Many thanks to to Prof. Madhav Deshpande, Dr. Vipin K. Chaturvedi, Sh. Megh Kalyanasundaram, Prof. K. S. Kannan, and Dr. B. V. K Sastry for their kind comments.

  

Dear Prof. Kannan,

  

I was not aware that Sh. R. Shreevatsa is your nephew. He has suggested many useful changes for addressing the issue in displaying certain Devanagari glyphs in PDFs correctly on Academia.edu and for accurate copy-pasting of Unicode text from PDFs produced by LaTeX. I am a great admirer of his work on Sanskrit metre recognition (<http://1e.sanskritmetres.appspot.com/> and <https://www.sanskritlibrary.org/pub/csdh-Rajagopalan-Meter.pdf>). He is a brilliant polymath indeed. With distinguished people like yourself, Dr. Meera, and R. Shreevatsa (and probably several more), it appears talent runs in your family.

  

With best regards, Nityananda
