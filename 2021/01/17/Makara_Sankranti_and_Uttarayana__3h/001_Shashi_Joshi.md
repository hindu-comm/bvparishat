Very nicely written article, both the flow and the language, keeping it simple.

  

This caught by eye:

> 
> > "The tradition of celebrating Makara Samkrānti as the start of > Uttarāyana **is thus the result of a kind of ‘freeze’ in our > traditions,** as we stopped updating our festival calendars by making > it shift freely along with the precession of the equinox and the slow > shift of seasons. >
> 
> >   
> Are there any side effects for this freeze?  
> Primarily, this will make our tradition at variance with science. > Contrary to popular belief, our Dhārmic tradition is not anti-science > and it always went along with science and with truth (Satya/Ŗta)."

  

Three questions come to mind:

1\. Why did this freeze happen? Why did they choose to stop calculating any further? When all lunar calendar based festivals are still being calculated every year, and have different solar calendar dates, and we are okay with that. This freeze happened way before foreign cultures ruled over Bharat, so what caused this freeze so early on?

  

2\. Even as late as the 8th century, when *House Of Wisdom* was being formed and astronomer Kanka was invited, Surya Siddhanta etc were in use and were understood. So why did society stop updating the festival date? DId the theorists (those who would do the calculations) and practicalist (celebrating on the streets and society) lose connection somehow?

  

3\. If the freeze happened, but everyone knew that 14 Jan is not the actual uttarayana or makara sankranti, why did they keep saying so? I mean, they could celebrate the festival whenever they want, but why keep calling it uttarayana and sankranti? Even when it is known by different names around India (Bhogi, Lohri etc), it is still said that Sun goes uttarayana? That is, do people say that Bhogi is celebrated when the sun goes uttarayana?

  

Seeking some input from the vidvan-s here!

  

  

Thanks,
