Shri Venkatesh Murthyji,

Jai Shri Ram!

Many thanks for your response!

\< I am not going to argue.>

Kindly rest assured there is absolutely no argument!

You are expressing your views which may not be in agreement with mine!
And in fact, it is through such dissensions that I have been able to check and recheck my views and, if necessary, even modify them and then keep them before scholars like you!

Hence such a long delay in replying to your mail!

Here I am reminded of an anecdote that I had read several decades back in the "Readers' Digest" magazine!

A Professor of Physics (let us call him Prof A) in an American University had had a following type of discussion with one of his colleagues (say Prof. B) :

Prof. A: Today a strange thing happened! I explained the 'Theory of Special Relativity' to my class in the same manner as I was doing over the last fifteen years! But one of the students expressed that he had not understood it and wanted it to be explained again!!

Prof B: Then what did you do?

Prof. A: I explained it in a different manner. But the student expressed that he had still not followed it.

Prof. B: What did you do then?

Prof. A: I explained it in an entirely different manner! And a very strange thing happened!

Prof. B: What?

Prof. A: *I understood it myself!*

Thus you can see that someone who had been teaching and explaining the Special Theory of Relativity "for the last fifteen years" had not followed it himself but did so only when he explained it in an entirely different manner to his students!

Honestly, it is a similar case with me! The more I explain the niraadhar niraayana versus Vedic seasonal calendar to others the more I understand its nuances myself since I have to do a lot of research to find out as to what the reality is!

Thus you have raised a very important questions on which I had been pondering myself for quite sometimei.e.

\< But if you follow Sayana method a time will come when Krishna Janmasthami will be celebrated under Uttara Bhadrapada Nakshatra or Purva Bhadra Nakshatra instead of Rohini.>  

The million dollar question is as to whether we are celebrating Janashtami really as per the canons of scriptures!

And thanks to your above prompting, I have already written a detailed article about the same in Hindi, "When to celebrate Janmashtami" attached herewith.

 It has appeared in "Shri Mohan Krity Patrak" of the current year!
  

***What is the "date of birth" of Bhagwan Krishna?***

Before commenting on the same, we have to put the records straight as to what is the actual date and time of birth of Bhagwan Krishna!

As on date the only "confirmed" date of Incarnation of Bhagwan Krishna is 00 hrs LMT, of Mathura on July 19, 3228 BCE. It is based on the horoscope of Bhagwan Krishna prepared by none other than the redoubtable Dr B V Raman, who was known as "The Greatest Vedic Astrologer" of his times--- as per his "Notable Horoscopes"!

Let me summarize the main points in English:

1\. Dr. Raman had got the horoscope prepared by an Irish astronomer, Cyril Fagan, (famous for Bradley-Fagan Ayanamsha) in 1954 using his own special RamanAyanamsha.

2\. Dr. Raman had based His date of Incarnation on the premise that Bhagwan Krishna had been on this planet earth for about 125 years when He had left for His "Goloka".

3\. And Kaliyuga started the day when Bhagwan Krishna left for His Goloka.

4\. As Kaliyuga started on February 17/18, 3102 BCE, thus Bhagwan Krishna must have Incarnated 126 years earlier i.e. in 3128 BCE.

5\. For arriving at the exact date Dr. Ramana has taken recourse to Srimad Bhagavata, Shri Vishnu Purana, Harivamsha Purana, etc. etc.

***Kali-Era is niraadhaar!***

The catch here is that the starting date of Kaliyuga as presumed by Dr. Raman etc. is really niraadhaar, as will be clear from the attachment "Kali-era-is-fictitious-CRC". The CRC has minced no words in declaring that it was just back calculated by Aryabhata in 499 AD.

Then while considering the horoscope of Bhagwan Krishna, we find that it was really impossible, I repeat really impossible, to have prepared a correct horoscope for 3228 BCE before the advent of the latest astronomical data like DE431 from JPL/NASA, which has been harnessed by Shri Dieter Koch at Swiss Ephemeris in a very sophisticated and constructive manner!

This will be clear from the attached half a dozen horoscopes of Bhagwan Krishna from different "software" including the ones based on the Surya Siddhanta. You will find that none agrees with the other!

***Equal division nakshatras are subsumed in the tropical Rashis of Srimad Bhagawata etc.***

It is also worthwhile to note that as per the Srimad Bhagavata etc. works, Ashvini, Bharni etc. nakshatras----equal divisions ----were subsumed in the (so called) Sayana Rashichakra of the same purana besides that of Vamana Purana etc.

We must also take into account that as on July 19, 3228 BCE, the (sayana) sun was 87°, which means it was the month of Shuchih, also known as (solar) Jyeshtha, the secondmonth of Greeshma Ritu as against the details of Vishnu Purana5/1/78

प्रावृट् काले च नभसि कृष्णाष्टंयामहं निशि उत्पत्स्यामि नवम्यां तु प्रसूतिं त्वमवाप्स्यसि \|\|

Here Bhagwan Krishna has Himself declared that He would Incarnate on Krishnashtami in the month of Nabhas of Varsha Ritu---(Mukhyamaana Shravana) whereas Yogamaya would be born on (the next day) i.e. Navmi!

Obviously, Bhagwan Krishna had incarnated on Krishnashtami of Nabhas and it was the same Nabhas that was known as Shravana as per the same Vishnu Purana!

So, in a nutshell, we must celebrate Shri Krishna Janmashtami on the Krishna Paksha Ashtami of Nabhas viz. the month of (Mukhya-mana) Shrvana and not pine for Rohini nakshatra on that day!

That is what the Shastras have advised!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!
