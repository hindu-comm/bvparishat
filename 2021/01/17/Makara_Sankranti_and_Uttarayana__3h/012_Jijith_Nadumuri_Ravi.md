Dear Respected members.

  

Thanks for your comments about my article onMakara Samkranti and Uttarayana.  
  
Regarding the question on how the freeze happened, my single line answer would be this:- The astrologers / astronomers in the medieval period chose to go with the Nirayana system instead of the age old Sayana system.

  

This broke the link of our astronomy / astrology traditions with the precession of the equinoxes. Here, I agree with Shri AK Kaul ji, who has been trying for many years to stress this fact in front of the astrology / astronomy community. The subsequent attempts to fix the calendar/ jyotisha calculations, by medieval astronomers/ astrologers only worsened the breakage.  
  
The equinoxes and solstices shift slowly in the sky of earth at the rate 1 degree in 71 to 72 years. Thus it takes around 25560 to 25920 years to complete one revolution of the precession of the equinoxes. Current scientific value 25,772 years. Both the numbers 71 and 72 as well as the related numbers like 360, 720 etc are preserved in our tradition, by symbolically encoding them into the Rgveda and the Mahabharata (manvantara with 71 chatur-yugas; 1200 year long Markandeya Chatur Yuga multiplied by 360 to make it 4320000 year long AryabhatiyanChatur Yuga etc).

  

The knowledge of the slow precession of the equinoxes is a precious knowledge that our ancient astronomers have discovered and preserved since the period of Rgveda. This was possible, because they had a sedentary civilization that existed in a region between the Yamuna and Saraswati rivers. This ancient region is known varyingly in the Rgveda and Mahabharata as Ilayas-pada,Vara-ā-Prthvya, Brhmavarta, Brahma Vedi, Uttaravedi, Devabhumi, Dharmakshetra, Kurukshetra etc due to its sheer ancientness. Since it is the most ancient region of our tradition it was treated as the most important and the most sacred region. This is also correctlythe oldest part of the Sindhu-Sarasvati Civilization (SSC or the IVC or the Harappan Civilization) viz. this same Yamuna - Saraswati region exemplifiedby the settlements like Bhirrana (starting from 8000 BCE) and Rakhigarhi (starting from 6000 BCE). These ancient settlements are situated along the Drshadvatiand the Apayatributaries of Saraswati in the same region. Bhirrana is only 50 km away from Sarasvati at Sirsa and only 160 km away from the current Kurukshetra city . Rakhigarhi is only 130 km away from Sarasvati at Sirsa and 140 km away from the current Kurukshetra city. Going by the chronology suggested by Shrikant Talageri, the Rgvedic period is between 4200 BCE to 1800 BCE. By 2000 BCE the sky watchers of Bhirrana will be getting 6000 years and those in Rakhigarhi will be getting 4000 years to observethe sky and it is enough to discover slow moving cyclic phenomenalike the precession of the equinoxes.

  

The youngest part of Rgveda like the 10th Mandala, dated to around 2000 BCE to 1800 BCE contains information about the division of the sky into 12. This is the basis of what later became the 12 divisions of the zodiac. Though the zodiac is not yet evolved like it is known today with the names of 12 rashis, and the 27 nakshatras as it is known today with its name are not enumerated, many stars like Tisya (Sirius) and constellationslike rksha(Ursa Major / Saptarshi) and Krttika(Pleiades) and eclipses involvingSwarbhanu (Rahu) are all mentioned in the younger Mandalas like 1, 5 and 10. datable to around 2200 BCE to 1800 BCE. It also divided the sky into 360 divisions. This is related to the solar year calendar. In yet another scheme, the sky is divided into 720 parts by conceiving a Kalachakra (sky-clock with sun as the moving time-measurement handle) with 360 spokes, 720 sub spokes and the three modes of time-reckoning using Kalachakra.

  

For the interest of Sanatana Dharma, we need to switch back to the Sayana tradition and rectify our festival calendar by celebrating the calanderin alignment with the seasons and the movement of the sun (Uttarayana / Dakshinayana) with the precession related corrections.  
  
Most importantly, the Uttarayana needs to be celebrated at the current Winter Solstice on December 21st when the sun starts moving northwards after reaching itssouthern maxima point and giving us the longest night and shortest day. It needs to be delinked from the Makara Samkranti. Currently Uttarayana / Winter Solstice is not happening at Makara Samkranti. Both the Makara Samkranti and Uttarayana ( / Winter Solstice) coincided in around 2100 years ago (approx. in 1st century BCE +/- 100 years). Hence, the tradition of Makara Samkrantias the start of Uttarayana originated at this time. It got recorded in our Puranas and various astronomical works during this period. We are carryingforward this tradition blindly, since then, for more than 2000 years now without making the necessary corrections. This is unlike our astronomers of Rgvedic period and Mahabharata period, who did modify the calendars after the elapse of many centuries, by understanding that the calendars become useless after the elapse of many centuries due to the precession of equinox. The evidence for the calandercorrection is the myths like the change of Dhruva nakshatra (pole star change due to precession of equinox) , the breaking of the chariot of Ushas, the stealing away the wheel (Kalachakra) of sun (implying calendar breakage), the waiting of Revati for 1000 years at Brahma loka etc explained in my article itself.

  

Even the transit of the sun into the Makara Rashi boundary is not currently happening on the date we today celebrate Makara Samkrantiat around 14th / 15th January. Makara Samkranti(the transit of the sun from Dhanu to Makara by crossing the Makara-Dhanu boundary, coincidedwith dates like 14th/15th Jan only 500 years ago. This is the period whenNilakantha Somayaji, a famous astronomer from Kerala. He might be theone who fixed it like this. Hence, we are following this date blindly for the last 500 years. This is another problem to be sorted out.

  
Not fixing them makes our tradition unscientific. It makes us unworthy to follow the legacy of those who lived during the Rgvedic period and the Mahabharata period, who did have the knowledge of precession and did change their calendars accordingly to make it correct.
