Shri Venkatesh Murthyji,

Jai Shri Ram!

\< There have been many discussionson this subject here. Summary is this. There are two methods - Nirayana and Sayana to calculate the positions of Sun, Moon, and the planets. If you use Nirayana the position is calculated giving importance to the stars constellations in the background sky. If you use Sayana the position is calculated giving importance to the Precession of Equinoxes and correct seasons.>

Pl. rest assured that there is no nirayana----which means nirayana is really niraadhaar!

The nakshtarsin the Vedasare entirely different "entities" from the ones that we are taking as 27 imaginary equal divisions like Ashvini, Bharni etc. which are being subsumed further into 12 imaginary divisions named (Lahiri) Mesha, Vrisha etc. Pl. note even these imaginary divisions have several "qualities"---Ramana Rashichakra is different from Lahiri Rashichakra, Grahalaghava Rashichakra is different from both, Rmana and Lahiri---Raiavata Rashichakra is different from all of them and so on!

These are all creations of "Vedic astrologers"---and nothing else!

Now if it is a must that we must somehow or the other club Ashivini, Bharni etc. 27 imaginary equal divisions with Mesha, Vrsiha etc. twelve imaginary Mesha, Vrisha etc. divisions, we have to go by our shastras like the Srimad Bhagavata or the Vamana Purana etc.

As far as our scriptureslike Srimad Bhagavata or Vishnu Purana or Vamana Puranaor Narada Puranaetc. are concerned there is nothing like sayana versus or even vis-a-vis nirayana!

They have alleitherclubbed nakshatras starting with Ashvini division with Mesha Samkranti/Rashi which is another name of Vernal Equinoxor are just silent about nakshatras vis-a-vis Rashis.

This nirayana versus (and not even Vis-a-Vis)Sayanacame into vogue after Makaranda and Grahalaghava "astronomical" handbooks came into existence----in about 17th/18th century.  

And it was accentuated by "imported Vamadevas" who claimed that since there were references to nakshatras in the Vedas hence Vedic astrology was "sidereal" deliberately ignoring our shastra like Srimad Bhagavata, Vishnu Purana, Narada Purana and even Vamana Purana!

Astronomically, whether it is the Surya Siddhanta of early centuries of CE or Aryabhatawhowas 23 years old in 499 ADas per Aryabhatiyaor Varahamihira of 505 CEwho has referred to Aryabhata in his Panchasiddhantikaor Bhaskaracharya of 12th century CE, for all of them MakarSankranti was the starting day of Uttarayana, and therefore the shortest day of the year---and so onas will be clear from the below attachments:

A)SSMakara-Karkata-Samkranti-----Surya Siddhanta, an astronomical work of early centuries of CE says Mesha Samkranti is Vernal Equinox and so on, and Sudhakar-Dwivedi, a 20th century well known scholar of Varanasi, confirms the same through his commentary.

B)BS-RKBhat-BS: Varahamihira of 6th centuryas per*Adityachara*of his Brihat Sanhita expects and wants Uttarayan to coincide always------I repeat ALWAYS----with Makar Sankranti and Dakshinayan with Karkata Sankranti.

He has clubbed Punarvasu-Nakshatra with Dakshinayana -cum-Karkata -Samkranti in Panchasiddhantika III/21

आश्लेशार्धादासीद् यदा निवृत्तिः किलोष्णकिरणस्य \| युक्तमयनं तदासीत्**सांप्रतमयनं पुनर्वसुतः**\|\|

It is exactly the same thing that has been done in the Vamana Purana!

And none of the translators/commentators whether Bhatotpala ofShaka 888 or Subramaniam Swamy or R K Bhatof 20th century have objected to the same.  

C) Vateshwara---Vateshwara Siddhanta of 10th century says Mesha Samkranti is Vernal Equinox and so on.

D\) Siddhanta-Shekhar-Rashis. Sripati was a famous astrologer-cum-astronomer who is believed to have introduced "Sripati-Paddhati" house division besides having written astrologicalbooks. Even he clubbed Makar and Kumbha with Shishira Ritu, Mina and Mesha with Vasanta Ritu and so on!

He has talked about sayana rashis in his astronomical works.

E\) Bhaskara-II: He was the last siddhantic astronomer of India worth the name. As late as 12th century, he has talked about a Sayana Rashichakra!

D) CRC-nakshatra-stars.Astronomically, the nakshatra divisions of13.33333 degrees each are non-existent whether Sayana or nirayana---much less their further subdivisions like nakshatra-padas and so on.

The relevant stars of the namesake divisions are quite pell-mell as will be clear from the attachmentCRC-nakshatra-stars. The Saha Calendar Reform Committee has analyzed the issue thoroughly and arrived at the conclusion

Quote

In fact, no arrangement at any time appears to have been satisfactory enough for all the yogataras to fall within their respective divisions.

Unquote

If Ashvini star is 10 degreesaway from the starting pointof Ashvini division,Bharanistar is just in the middle and so on whereas as many as 8 stars are just outside their namesake divisions.

***There was no nirayana astronomical work, therefore no nirayana astrology in India!:***

Thus an irrefutable conclusion from the above incontrovertibleproofs is that in India there was absolutely no astronomical work which could calculate any so called nirayana longitudes of planets! And it is but natural to realize that if there was no nirayana astronomical work, how could nirayana panchangas be prepared and how could nirayana horoscopes from the same be calculated!

That means that whether it was Varahamihira or Sripati or any other astrologer, they followed a tropical rashichakra within which Ashvini, Bharni etc. nakshatras were subsumed!

***All the Samskrit dictionaries club Uttarayana with Makar Rashi and Madhu with Chaitra:***

****

Whther it is Amar Kosha of early centuries of CE or Shabada-Kalpadruma of 19th century CE----all have clubbed Makar Samkranti with Uttaryana and Chaitra with seasonal Madhu! (AttachmentAmarkosha months)

***Even astrologicdal nadi works are Sayana!:***  

ShriMadhivanan, the well known astrologer, who is also a member of this august forum, has done a thorough study of Saptarshi Nadi and he has arrived at the conclusion that those Nadis were tropical, in which Ashvini, Bharni etc. nakshatras also were subsumed----from which Dasha-bhukti was calculated---- exactly like Vamana Purana, Srimad Bhagavata etc. This will be clear from

[https://madhivanan.in/saptarishis-used-tropical-zodiac/](https://madhivanan.in/saptarishis-used-tropical-zodiac/)  

***Reputed Hindu/Indian astrologers advised Sayana astrology:***  
One of the most reputed astrologers/astronomers from Varanasi, viz. Sudhakar Dwivedi of 20th century, has advised that we must follow Sayana Rashichakra, as was followed by our ancestors!

This he has explained in the attachment Sudhakar-Dwivedi-Sayana-astrology. This page is from the biography of the famous Hindi writer, "Bharatendu Harishchandra" wherein Sudhakar Dwivedi has clarified as to how our ancestors practiced astrology based on sayana Rashichakra!

***Munjal, a tenth century astronomer rectified the calendar:***

Alberuni, the well known "traveller" who was in India in eleventh century, has highly appreciated the efforts of Munjal, who in 937 CE had advised to add one arc-minute per year to the mean longitudes of the SS/Aryabhatiya etc. from Shaka 444 to make them tally with the actual longitudes.

Alberuni has explained as to how the Mesha etc. Samkrantis were behind by about six days from the "Vishuva" ---Vernal Equinox and how Munjal had advised to rectify the same through his "Laghumanasa".

Alberuni is all praise for Munjal and Utpala (Bhatotpala) etc. for having rectified the calculated calendar vis-a-vis the actual dates.(Attachment Alberuni-Munjal)

*But unfortunately, during this twenty-first century, our "Vedic astrologers" advise us to "rectify" (actually make it defective!) the actual phenomena by subtracting (exactly opposite to what Munjal advised and Alberuni appreciated!) "Ayanamahsa"-*

*Can there be anything more ironical than the same!*

***Taittiriya Samhita and Acharya Sayana are all for seasonalmonths and years---which means tropical rashis!***

The attachmedntTS-Madhu=Chaitra are some mantras from the Taittiriya Samhita, which have clubbed Madhu, Madhava with Vasanta Ritu and so on, thus correlating all the twelve seasonal solar months with the seasonal i.e. tropical year.

To crown it all, the one and only Acharya Sayana, the famous Samskrit scholar of Vijay Nagar, South India, who was the only scholar to have written commentaries on all the four Vedas in 14th century CE has equated in unequivocal terms Madhu with Chaitra, Madhava with Vaishakha---both being the months of Vasanta Ritu and so on thus clubbing all the twelve solar as well as lunar months with respective seasons!

This should leave nodbody in doubt that there was nothing like nirayana mayhem prevailing at the time of Acharya Saya of 14h century CE!

Tragically, our "Vedic astrologers"today, including the "imported Vamadeva" are doing exactly opposite to what Acharya Sayana had advised---we are delinking Chaitra from Madhu and clubbing it with some Lahiri Chitra and so on.

I hope the above clarifications have answered all your questions!  

***Nirayana is literally Adharma:***

The parting shot is that we are following adharma in letter and spirit, that too deliberately by following nirayana panchangas! (Attachment CRC-Nirayna-Adharma!)--thanks to "imported Vamadevas"and "Vedic astrologers"!!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!
