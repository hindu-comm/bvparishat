I have written and published on this topic and hence will be brief:

1\. Rainfall is seasonal and depends on sun’s position. Wrong sun-nakshatras lead farmers and others to doubt, dislike and eventually shun dhārmic traditions.

2\. Vaikuṇṭha ekādaśī as observed in ancient South Indian Viṣṇu temples is to open the Uttarāyaṇa-door .Due to mismatch between lunar and solar calendars this drifts but comes together on 21 December once in 18-19 years, even now. Some modern temples name the special inner sanctum door as Vaikuntha-vaasal, having forgotten the original symbolism. The 21 day stationary position of Sun is observed as the Raa-pattu and Pahal-pattu (night-10 and morning-10) festival on either side of the Vaikuṇṭha ekādaśī.

3\. In the Indictoday article, RV 1.164 has been taken to indicate 3-types of motions. The first daily (E-W) and second annual (E-W among nakshatras) are straightforward. The third one (precession and its rate) is problematic since there are references in Vedic texts to the sun's lateral (N-S) motion meaning, southernmost (visible) point to northernmost (visible) point and back. Sāyaṇabhāṣya does not discuss any of the above! Perhaps for the yājñika tradition it is sufficient to take the three centers of Sun’s wheel to mean morning, mid-day and evening positions.

4\. Felt effects of precession and conscious knowledge of precession are two different phenomena. The first is a certainty whereas the second is of low probability but not an impossibility.For the first, if interested, see (<https://www.academia.edu/39950940/Archaeo_astronomy_and_Ancient_Indian_Chronology>). For the second reference to the work of D.W.Johnson (<https://westgatehouse.com/cycles.html>) would be very appropriate. I am mentioning this in passing. The IT longread article is well written.
