Namaste Sri Kaulji  

  

I am not going to argue. But if you follow Sayana method a time will come when Krishna Janmasthami will be celebrated under Uttara Bhadrapada Nakshatra or Purva Bhadra Nakshatra instead of Rohini. Rama Navami will be celebrated in Revati or earlier Nakshatra instead of Punarvasu. Many traditional festivals like Sarasvati Poojain Navaratri have Nakshatra base and they will be disrupted. What is the result? People will be confused and filled with doubt. Adharma will increase.
