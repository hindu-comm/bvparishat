Dear Radha-Krishnaji,

Radha-Krishnaya Namah!

\<A section of ancient astronomers and their followers wanted to continue celebrating the beginning of Uttarāyaṇa on the day the Sun enters Makara. Their astronomical calculations do not account for precession (called ayanāṃśa in Sanskrit.) Hence their reckoning is called nirayaṇa, meaning “without precession”. Another section of ancient astronomers and their followers chose to observe Uttarāyaṇa when it actually begins, i.e., on the day of the Winter Solstice. Their calculations take into account precession; hence their reckoning is called “sāyana” meaning “with precession”.\>

Since more than 90 per cent of our festivals----including Makar, Mesha etc. Smakrantis--- are based on the criteria fixed by the Puranas, days/dates of which are decided as per siddhantic astronomy, I have not been able to find even a single shloka-----**-I repeat even a single Shloka-**----from any Purana that has notsaid that Makar Samkranti is the shortest day of the year, Mesha Samkranti the day of Vernal Equinox, Karkata Samkranti the longest day of the year and Tula Samkranti the day of Vernal Equinox!

For ready reference, kindly just peruse the article at

https://[pragyata.com/when-should-pongal-makar-samkranti-be-celebrated-and-why/](http://pragyata.com/when-should-pongal-makar-samkranti-be-celebrated-and-why/)

What is to be borne in mind specially is that all the commentators of Srimad Bhagavata----including the most respected Vaishanavascholar Sreedhara Swamin, have advised to celebrate Makar Samkranti on the shortest day of the year (Attachment Sreedhara Swamin Uttarayana).

Now coming to the siddhantas, there is no siddhanta---**-I repeat there is no siddhanta**----right from the Surya Siddhanta to the Siddhanta Shiromani of Bhaskaracharya that has not clubbed Makar Samkranti with the shortest day of the year and so on! This also can be verified from the above article.

In fact, as late as the eighteenth century, one of the most authoritative works, viz. the Shaba-Kalpadruma has advised ----quopting none other than the Surya Siddhanta!---that Makar Samkranti is nothing but a synonym of Uttarayana viz. the shortest day of the year! (Attachment Shabda-kalpadruma-Uttarayana!)!

Thus whichever way we look at it, ***we are making a mockery of our dharmashastras as well as siddhantas by celebrating Makar Samkranti on any other day than the shortest day of the year***---since Makar Samkranti has no existence of its own unless clubbed with the Uttarayana!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
