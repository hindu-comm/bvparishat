Very relevant questions, Shri Shashi Joshi. Hope the author, Shri Jijith Nadumuri Ravi, can provide answers to your questions.

  

Here is my recent Facebook post on Makara Sankranti. It doesn't really answer your questions though.

  

Facebook post of January 13th follows.

Happy Makara Saṅkrānti to everyone!

  

The Sun will enter the constellation of Makara tonight at 6:33 PM, Pacific Time.

  

If this occasion is being celebrated as the beginning of the Sun’s “journey north” (Uttarāyaṇa), then that journey actually began 24 days ago on the day of Winter Solstice on December 20th.

  

Why do many people celebrate Makara Saṅkrānti and the start of Uttarāyaṇa on the same day although there is a gap of 24 days between the two?

  

As viewed from the Earth, the Sun appears to move 6 months north and then 6 months south every year. At the end of one trip, the Sun takes an infinitesimal moment of “rest” then turns direction and starts travelling in the opposite direction. That infinitesimal moment of rest is the Solstice, and it happens twice a year, one in the winter and the other in the summer. In addition to this north-south movement, the Sun also appears to transit from one constellation of stars to another in the “star studded celestial sphere”, making a complete round of the “starry background” in a year plus approximately 20 minutes. The extra 20 minutes is due to the precession of the equinoxes (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession>). This means that the passage into Makara constellation gets delayed about 20 minutes every year. About 1750 years ago, the Winter Solstice and Makara Saṅkrānti must have coincided. Over the years, the 20 minutes-per-year delay accumulated to 24 days and hence the entry into Makara now happens 24 days after the Solstice. During the 500 years from 0 CE to 500 CE, which was the time of the great mathematicians and astronomers of ancient India, Saṅkrānti and Solstice must have occurred within a gap of ±3.5 days.

  

A section of ancient astronomers and their followers wanted to continue celebrating the beginning of Uttarāyaṇa on the day the Sun enters Makara. Their astronomical calculations do not account for precession (called ayanāṃśa in Sanskrit.) Hence their reckoning is called nirayaṇa, meaning “without precession”. Another section of ancient astronomers and their followers chose to observe Uttarāyaṇa when it actually begins, i.e., on the day of the Winter Solstice. Their calculations take into account precession; hence their reckoning is called “sāyana” meaning “with precession”.
