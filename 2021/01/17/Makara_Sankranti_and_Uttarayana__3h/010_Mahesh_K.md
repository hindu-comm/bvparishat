Dear scholars,

प्रणामाः।

  

Here is my input to the discussion on *nirayaṇa* and *sayana* system.

  

Bhāskara talks about converting *nirayaṇa* longitude to *sāyana* and vice versa, clearly in his *Siddhāntaśiromaṇi* where he lays out the procedure to determine*lagna.* There, as the final step of the procedure, he precisely says*(tripraśnādhikāra, ver.4)*

.... तनुः स्यात् अयनांशहीनम् ....

  

Here indeed, the subtraction of *ayanāṃśa* is suggested in order to get the *nirayaṇa lagna*.

  

Also, while delineating the same method in the auto-commentary (*Vāsanābhāṣya*), he precisely instructs to change the (*nirayaṇa*) longitude of the Sun into *sāyana* to begin the computation.

यस्मिन् काले लग्नं ज्ञेयं तस्मिन् काले तात्कालिकोऽर्कः **सायनांशः** कार्यः। ...

*Add the ayanāṃśa to the longitude of the instantaneous Sun, at the point of time when it is required to find the lagna.*

  

It is followed by the computations involving the subtraction of rising time of successive rāśis from the elapsed time since sunrise. Thereafter, at the end of the procedure, he prescribes:  

.... अयनांशैर्हीनं लग्नं स्यात्।

*.... \[that\] diminished by the degrees of precession, wouldbe the lagna.  
*

  

Had the *Nirayaṇa* system was not in practice (either in *pañcāṅga* or horoscope), Bhāskara would not have instructed to add or subtract *ayanāṃśa* (before and after computations).
