Namaste  

  

There have been many discussionson this subject here. Summary is this. There are two methods - Nirayana and Sayana to calculate the positions of Sun, Moon, and the planets. If you use Nirayana the position is calculated giving importance to the stars constellations in the background sky. If you use Sayana the position is calculated giving importance to the Precession of Equinoxes and correct seasons.

  

It is a choice you have to make. What is more important? Stars or Seasons? The Ancient Hindu Astrologers have made Stars more important. The modern peopleusing Sayana are saying Seasons are important and we have to celebrate festivals in the correct Season.

  

In Vedas we find prayers and Yajnas to Nakshatras. Therefore it is not right to neglect the Star constellation importance.

  

But still we see some moderners are pushing for Season based celebrations of festivals.

  

You cannot have both. If you follow Stars you will leave Seasons behind. If you follow Seasons you will leave Stars behind.
