Another question to your list is - When was this error introduced in the Indian calendars?

  

From inscriptions and architectural evidences from different parts of India, we see that the उत्तरायणं was celebrated on the correct date until about 2 centuries ago. While a detailed study is yet to be done, it appears that unlike today, there was great regional diversity in the actual date used. You may find this study useful by Dr. BS Shylaja et al, on the Gavi Gangadhareshwara temple of Bangalore, which is now famous for its सूर्यमज्जनं on the **14th January**, when the Sun light falls on the Shiva linga. She points to this effect was due to a recent brick work on the windows, opening the possibility that it was perhaps aligned to the real उत्तरायणं earlier.
