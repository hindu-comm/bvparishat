Respected Shri Jijith Nadumuri Ravi,  

I read your article, and i agree that Uttarayana should be recognized as happening when it actually does, on the Winter solstice day (21/22, December). Also, that is the day of Makara Samkranthi too (tropical), but that is for another debate.

The reason I write here is I would like to bring to your attention the imperfection in your following statement:

  

" Thus after 72 years, the four corners of the sky shift by 1 day in the calendar, and in 720 years they will shift by 10 days. In other words, the Winter Solstice which occurs today on 21st December will shift to 11th December 720 years from now in around 2740 CE, in our future."

  

This statement is factually not true. The Gregorian calendar we follow now is a tropical calendar, which means it is aligned to the movement of the earth around the Sun rather than to the stars. Yes, it is true that after 72 years, the four corners of the sky will shift by 1°, but *with respect to the stars*. But the Gregorian calendar is not aligned to the stars, and therefore the winter solstice will not shift, as mentioned, 720 years later to 11th December, 2740 CE. In fact, when I checked with Jagannatha Hora, winter solstice occurs on December 22, 2740 CE.

  

If you find my argument is true, then appropriate changes may be made to the article.

  

Regards,

Dr. Madhivanan MBBS
