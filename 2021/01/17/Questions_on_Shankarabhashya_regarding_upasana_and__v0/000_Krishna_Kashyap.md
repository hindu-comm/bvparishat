Namsakara,

couple of questions on Shankara Bhashya regarding upasana and yoga (kundalini)  

  

Please suggest me in what book or paper I can find this information:

  

1\) What does Sri Shankaracharya say about upasana or dhyana? jnanatmokshameans, this jnana has to occur like an immediate realization. Who should be doing upasana? is it the one who does not have immediate realization of samskaras to get immediate realization? further, is avritti same as upasana. I thought avritti is kind of a japa of mahavakyas.

  

2\) In tantra school and books like "serpent power" or shat chakra nirnaya they talk about kundalini. This term kundalini is sort of not used in vaishnava texts but they use gayathri and some similar terms to represent the same concept. What is the view of Sri Shankaracharya regarding yoga which involves the traditional gayathri meditation or the tantric kundalini concept? Does yoga taravali deal with this subject? or does some other yoga upanishads, if explained by Sri Shankaracharya may have some information. Upanishad Bramhendra swamyhas written explanations on yoga upanishads but does he follow an earlier commentary by Shankaracharya or some post shankaracharya writer?

  

Thanks.

  

I have a:
