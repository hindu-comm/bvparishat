Does anyone have digital copies of these two catalogues?

  

1\. National Archive has two collections of Sanskrit manuscripts: (1) Maharaja Hari Singh's private library (Jammu) and 2. Archaeological department, Srinagar. Of the first collection, there was a [descriptive catalogue by Ramachandra Kak and Harabhatta Shastri](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.367316/mode/1up) prepared in 1927. Mr Chetan Pandey informed me that these two collections were moved to Delhi in 1948. There is a carelessly prepared [handlist](http://www.nationalarchives.nic.in/content/list-sanskrit-manuscripts) of these two collections available on the National Archives' website. It seems that Dr Lokesh Chandra prepared a descriptive catalogue of these manuscripts that was published in [2011](https://www.worldcat.org/title/descriptive-catalogue-of-sanskrit-manuscripts-in-the-private-library-of-his-highness-shri-rajarajeshwar-maharajadhiraj-maharaja-shri-harisinghji-bahadur-kcie-kcvo-of-jammu-and-kashmir-mahacinacara-kaksaputa-and-tararahasya/oclc/753561852&referer=brief_results) and probably a reprint in [2019](https://www.worldcat.org/title/descriptive-catalogue-of-sanskrit-manuscripts-in-the-private-library-of-his-highness-shri-rajarajeshwar-maharajadhiraj-maharaja-shri-harisinghji-bahadur-kcie-kcvo-of-jammu-and-kashmir-2-mahacinacara-kaksaputa-and-tararahasya/oclc/1096295920&referer=brief_results).

  

2\. A [descriptive catalogue](https://www.worldcat.org/title/manuscripts-from-indian-collections-descriptive-catalogue/oclc/935600289&referer=brief_results) of about 152 manuscripts (59 Sanskrit manuscripts) from National Museum, Delhi was published in 1964. These manuscripts were displayed during 26th International Congress of Orientalists held in 1964 in New Delhi.

  

I'd be very grateful if anyone can help me to find these catalogues. I'm in the middle of writing my PhD proposal and our library is not bringing any physical material due to COVID.
