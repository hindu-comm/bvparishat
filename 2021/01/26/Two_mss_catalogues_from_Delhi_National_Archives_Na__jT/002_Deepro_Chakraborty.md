Shankara ji,

  

Thank you so much for sharing this with me. You have been always helping me to find books. I'm very grateful to you.

  

By any chance, do you also have this [Kashmir University catalogue](https://www.worldcat.org/title/hand-list-of-the-sanskrit-manuscripts-in-the-sanskrit-manuscript-library-research-publications-department-hazratbal-srinagar/oclc/34043247)?

  

Sincerely,

Deepro
