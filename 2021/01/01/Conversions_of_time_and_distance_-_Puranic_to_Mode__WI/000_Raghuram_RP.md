Abhivadaye Scholars,

  

This year our school theme for utsava was Ramayana where the whole school studied Ramayana and presented many facets of it. In this process few issues rose about conversionof Purnaic measurements to metric systems. For example:-

-   Conversion of Yojanas into miles or kilometers
-   Conversion of muhurta or nimeesha into seconds/minutes etc..

Who came up with these conversions, what is the basis for these conversions. For example there is a clear definition of what is Yojana in Vishnu Purana (Chapter 6) and similarly there is a clear definitionof 1m as per SI system and also conversionto MKS system

How and when can we convert from one system toanother?

I think this forum has experts from all fields and if we can come up with a standard conversion process whichcan be internationallyaccepted. We can also make this method as the standard way of measurements

Raghuram
