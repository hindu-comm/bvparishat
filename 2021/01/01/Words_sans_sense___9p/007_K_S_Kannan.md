Indeed! One can only wonder how Rau could have  

swallowed this surfeit of fulsome flattery.

What a complex has the White man's complexion imposed/imparted on the coloured!

Is everything fair with the fair-skinned?

And even if asked just to bend, do our own masters of the "divine tongue" choose to crawl?

Have we lost a sense of proportion, and more particularly, the sense of dignity?

Wherefrom springs this meanness of mien, shorn of all candour and destitute of decorum?

  

For those who did not take the trouble of reading/comprehending the original:

Rau is praised here as having mastered the 18 *vidyā*-s, and earned expertise in the 64 *kalā*-s

(One wonders whether Rau can just reel out even the names of these *kalā*-s!)

He has conquered all the 6 Foes! All scholars have bowed down to his lotus-feet!

(means perhaps Peri is the only scholar?). ...He is a *śrotriya* who has mastered ALL the *śāstra*-s!

... He is saluted by hosts of *brahmarṣi*-s (they have no better job)... All troops of gods are busy praising  

the bunches of his virtues...He is a master of *all* scripts and *all* languages...

  

And this Peri did PhD under him, and hails from a *paṇḍita-vaṁśa* (where else?),  

and so his own poems are gems..

  

And this Peri is very sure that  

Brahma, Viṣṇu, and Śiva are in a row  

 doing *puṣpa-vr̥ṣṭi* upon this Rau  

\- now that he has completed 65.  

  

Squandering speech like this, Peri will surely be born as a *pheru*

in his next birth (Cf. the *gomāyu* episode in *Mahābhārata*),

unless Rau has already granted him *kaivalya*,

or the post of a *brahmarṣi* as a bonus.

  

Well, Peri isn't alone: Wasn't Victoria hailed as Vikaṭesvarī by some of our Pandits,

Max Muller as Mokṣa mūlara (with a gift parcelled of the sacred thread),

and George the Fifth, hailed as *jana-gaṇa-mana-adhināyaka*,

(and glorified in school Sanskrit books as **jāra-jaḥ pañcamaḥ** !  

\- and was the pun/fun indeed unintended)?

  

God grant (common) sense to these masters of our "*gīrvāṇa-vāṇī*"!

  

After all who are the *deva*-s? :  

The fair-skinned who came and settled here who looked bright

(from root *div*, to shine)  

\- *ityuvāca* MRKale

in p.1 of his *Higher Sanskrit Grammar*.

  

And for SCBasu, the translator of *Aṣṭādhyāyī* and *Siddhānta Kaumudī*,

"after the advent of the British, peace and prosperity followed in its train...".

  

Kale and Basu of a century ago could be condoned;  

but today's Peri?

Has nobody composed yet paeans and panegyrics of Pollock and 0Flaherty ?  

God save the country from such giant pygmies!
