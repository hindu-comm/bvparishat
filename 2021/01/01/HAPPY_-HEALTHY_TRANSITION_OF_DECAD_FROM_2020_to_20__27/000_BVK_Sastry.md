Namaste



**HAPPY -HEALTHY TRANSITION OF DECADE FROM 2020 to 2021. **



***Some Thoughts on TIME referring to Untranslatable Samskruth Term : Kaa-la : What is Kaala ? ***

**What do we celebrate? Why ? MOMENT OF TIME**(क्षण- kshana) **or MOVEMENT OF KAA-LA**(काल -kaala ) **! EVERY MOMENT-MOVEMENT IS HAPPY HEALTHY DIVINE **

Kaala is a Vedic Samskruth Term with several yogic meanings !

Yajurveda speaks of Rudra as ‘ kaala- Mahaakaala’. कालाय नमः कल-विकरणाय च नमः 

Gita speaks of Yogeswara Krishna as ‘ Kaala’. कालोऽस्मि

Sri Rama is worshipped as ‘ Essence of Time’ कालात्मक -परमेश्वर राम

Kaala is and has a ‘ Conscious inner essence’. कालः कला- काष्ठादि रूपेण, ऋतु-अयन- संवत्सरादि युगान्तं प्रलायान्तं विभावितः अपि अखण्डः अनन्तः अनादिः

Kaala is a moving dynamic wheel . काल-चक्र भवचक्र - भाव -अनुभव-अनुभाव- विभाव संयोग जनित- रस-भाव -चक्र

Every one born has an integral unity and connectivity with Kaala : in terms of Ayush, Jaataka. आयुर्योग - जातक-चक्र

**What is 2021 : A number for a TIME ? a numeric identity of TIME -TRANSITION in Gregorian calendar,** also called New Style Calendar, solar dating system, proclaimed in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII as a reform of the Julian calendar. The Vedanga Jyotisha Surya -Siddhanta is NOT the same as solar dating system or solar calendar ( surya-panchanga) system of country-community specific time-reckoning publications in vogue!



2021 has three numeric values - 0,1 and 2 with a binary digital significance. The digital TIME -MACHINE reckoning is anchored to ISO 8601- the international standard for date and time representation in the web and officially, by country. And it has a year 0. The standard of the most of the world’s population. Gregorian calendar has neither a year 0 nor a year 1. We are currently living in the fifth century of the Gregorian calendar, a century that began in the 1980s.

**Let us celebrate the current Yogic moment of 2021 as a global celebrations without losing the ' Bharateeya sampradaya' of ' Nootana varsha'** coming up after a few months of Makara Sankranti (Pongal) and 'Maha-shivaratri'. Let the vision and practice of celebrating Shivaratri as ' TIME -Manifestation of Shiva' and ' Janma- Jayanti' as a connection to Sri Krishna, Sri Rama and Acharyas have the same
enthusiasm.

Dear friends,

For us abroad, India is a distant land. We are the lost tribes

that crossed the Himalayas. Then we look for our roots for

ourselves and for our children.



After sufficient analysis, I have settled down to map India's

intellectual contribution through ten thought leaders. This is

an effort to create an integrated thought picture that our

children may carry analytically through academic material.

After creating the broader map, we plan to analyze each

contribution in more detail for historical reference.

I hope you would bless this effort in this distant land.



Happy New year.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
