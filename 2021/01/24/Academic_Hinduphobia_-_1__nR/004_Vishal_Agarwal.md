Namaskar! My next talk is on 27th February and it will cover Emory University (Atlanta). I will remember to state right in the beginning why our children must not take classes on Hindu Dharma in college.

  

As for naming the larger lobbies, I do not always have proof of the linkages. If and where I do, I will bare them. For example, in a slide I exposed how Courtright had his response to us ghost-written by Wendy Doniger, an aspect I will detail further in February. It is easier to expose the nefarious linkages in the case of India's Marxist historians and some of their collaborators/enablers are right here on this list. They will be named in future sessions.

  

Regards,

Vishal Agarwal
