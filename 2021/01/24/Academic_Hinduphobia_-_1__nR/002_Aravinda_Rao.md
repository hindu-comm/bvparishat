A wonderful talk by Sri Vishal Agarwal. It was a soft-spoken, balanced and firm presentation.

The final words, that the Hindu parents should not register their kids in Hinduism courses, are very pertinent and they could have been told in the beginning itself, keeping in mind those who would leave in the middle. You have rightly ended on a positive note, because the internet lays all these people bare as more Hindu students in India and abroad study their books in original and see the grandeur.

We see several serious students/techies who are taking the M.A courses in Sanskrit in the Hindu University of America, which seems to be giving very authentic course content.

We have a proverbin Telugu. If we have to make a line short, we have to draw a bigger line. You have rightly said that more of our people

have to know Sanskrit and know our books.

I am only wondering why we are not naming the actual forces behind all this phobia, the religious lobbies, for whom all these left-labelled persons are proxies.
