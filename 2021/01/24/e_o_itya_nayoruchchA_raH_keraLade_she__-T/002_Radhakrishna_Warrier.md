Just to add, this deviant pronunciation in Thiruvananthapuram happens only when the vowels are preceded by a consonant. When the vowels are at the beginning of a word, they are pronounced properly, except in the case of one word. The question word ƒìt≈≠ (which?) is pronounced like yat≈≠ where the 'a' is like the 'a' in English hat.

  

An interesting tidbit. In the very olden days, maids used to call the mistress of the house as "koccamma" meaning aunt. Nowadays the Trivandrum maids call the house lady as "cyaacci" (cƒìcci, older sister).

  

Because many northerners have settled in Trivandrum and also because of elite emulation, the Trivandrum dialect is slowly on its way out, at least in the city. It is still strongly entrenched in the adjoining villages though.

  

My family is from central Travancore region, but I grew up in Trivandrum and thus became "bilingual" in both standard Malayalam (the central Travancore dialect) and the Trivandrum dialect. I didn't have much chance to use the Trivandrum dialect after I entered Engineering college at the age of 17. But half a century later, I think I may be able to manage the Trivandrum dialect if the need arises üôÇ.
