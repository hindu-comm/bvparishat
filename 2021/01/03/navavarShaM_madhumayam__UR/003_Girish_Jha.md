Dear colleagues

Different friends expressed different views

on the new year.I Also agree this is not actually the New Year eve in Indian tradition.But hearing greetingz from many people my joy knew no bounds and being co mpelled I too sent Nes Year wishes to our colleagues.Sometime back a great Indologist (late)Prof. Shri Narayan Mishra told me if we could express best wishes every day ,the whole year could be auspitious and happy.Thank you for relishing my poem.

Regards

Girish K.Jha
