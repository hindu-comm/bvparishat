Pranam to all learned scholars

  

A वलय, in its most common sense, is a bracelet, solid and circular in shape.  
  
Bhagavat speaks of भूवलय in V-21 -1 and 19 and नभोवलय in V-22-5.  
  
The circumference of the भूवलय is given to be 95.1 million yojans (लक्षोत्तरं सार्धनवकोटियोजनपरिमण्डलम्), this is the distance sun travels in one year. This gives the distance between that of the sun and the earth to be approximately 15.1 million yojans  
  
Now, a google search tells us that earth travels 940 million kilometers in a year round the sun, the distance between the sun and earth being 149.6 million kilometers.  
  
The circumference of नभोवलय is not given in the Bhagavat.  
  
This topic must have received attention of academicians, and I am eager to find out what they have said.
