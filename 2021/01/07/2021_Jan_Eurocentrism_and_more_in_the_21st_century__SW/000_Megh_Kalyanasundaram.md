['*Eurocentrism and more in the 21st century: the case of 'Suum cuique tribuere (Ancient Rome, c.1000 BC–AD 565)' and 'A New History of Dharmaśāstra*](https://www.academia.edu/44852987/Eurocentrism_and_more_in_the_21st_century_the_case_of_Suum_cuique_tribuere_Ancient_Rome_c_1000_BC_AD_565_and_A_New_History_of_Dharma%C5%9B%C4%81stra)['](https://www.academia.edu/44852987/Eurocentrism_and_more_in_the_21st_century_the_case_of_Suum_cuique_tribuere_Ancient_Rome_c_1000_BC_AD_565_and_A_New_History_of_Dharma%C5%9B%C4%81stra)  

  

***Abstract***: Was Roman law *without doubt* the *most sophisticated* legal system from Antiquity? Do the roots of *vyavahārapadas* lie outside the *dharma* tradition? Is it the case that the earliest explicitly legal use of the term *vyavahāra* was attested outside *dharma* literature? In this paper, *statements* found in two influential 21st century publications that appear to be answers in the affirmative to the above questions are foregrounded, critically analyzed and responded to. Thereafter, some aspects of a three elements of Roman law are compared with their chronological peers (or predecessors) from a system of knowledge indigenous to the Indian subcontinent: the भारतीय अष्टादशविद्या (*Bhāratīya* *Aṣṭādaśavidyā*). In doing the above, and in the interest of a more inclusive global history (or histories) of law and jurisprudence, the ethical need for more open, comprehensive, rigorous yet sensitive engagement, sans eurocentrism (and more), is stressed, particularly when radical changes to any aspect of chronology of non-European, non-Mediterranean, non-Abrahamic traditions are posited.
