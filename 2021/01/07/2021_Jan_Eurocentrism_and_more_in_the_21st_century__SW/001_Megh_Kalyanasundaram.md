Namaste,

  

Since I received a request for a pdf and another request for an access option that does not require logging in to Academia, I share this link {in case anyone else too either faced an issue downloading it from Academia or would not prefer to accessit from Academia}:*[Eurocentrism and more in the 21st century: the case of ‘Suum cuique tribuere (Ancient Rome, c.1000 BC–AD 565)’ and ‘A New History of Dharmaśāstra’](https://meghk.wordpress.com/2021/01/10/eurocentrism-and-more-in-the-21st-century-the-case-of-suum-cuique-tribuere-ancient-rome-c-1000-bc-ad-565-and-a-new-history-of-dharmasastra/)*
