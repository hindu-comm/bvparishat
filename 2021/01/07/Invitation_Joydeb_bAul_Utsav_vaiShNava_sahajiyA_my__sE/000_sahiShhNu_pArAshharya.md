**pariṣade namaḥ pāriṣadbhyonamaḥ**

  

*praṇamya sarve—*  

  

I am posting this announcement on behalf of **Sahaje Swadhin**, which is an initiative for theBāultradition of Bengal by the **Dara Shikoh Foundation for the Arts**based in Srinaga and headed by the illustrious **Dr Jyotsna Singh** (granddaughter of the late Maharaja Hari Singh of Jammu and Kashmir), to promote and preserve the heritage of the Bāultraditions, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, since the Bāuls survive on bhikṣā and dāna as part of their ascetic practices which have been impacted severely.

  

The**Bāuls**are a vaiṣṇava sahajiyāvairāgī sampradāya (combining older Bauddhavajrayāna/sahajayāna philosophy and practices from Bengal, as well as later vaiṣṇava bhakti currents ofVidyāpati, Caṇḍīdāsa and otherGosāins) who are renowned for their mystical songs and philosophy. The **Sahaje Swadhin** initiative has organized an **online Zoom event** to be aired on the occasion of **Joydeb Baul Utsav** (during Makarasaṃkrānti) named after the famed author of theGītagovinda.

  

While the songs are in rural dialects of Bengali, English subtitles have been meticulously prepared (I am one of the translators myself) for easier comprehension. On behalf of the curator and organizer**Mr Pronoy Chakraborty (Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda)**, I invite all of you to register for this event. *All financial contributions (from ticket sales and charitable donations) fully go towards supporting the Bāul sanyāsīs featured in the event.*

With your kindness, support, and continued patronage, we look forward to hosting more of such events in the near future. One of our ambitious plans ahead would be to bring together the music of the Fakirs and the Bauls, whom we have had the honour of supporting since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Yours in warmth and friendship,
