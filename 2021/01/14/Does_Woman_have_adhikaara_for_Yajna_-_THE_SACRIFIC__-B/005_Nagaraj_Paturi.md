Jan C Heesterman's conclusion is that

  

"Like her husband, then the patnii holds an ownership right (svaamitva) in sacrifice."

  

Here at last the discussion approaches the firm ground of realities. The patnï joins her husband in all religious acts, her being required for their validity. It is this participation that defines as the patnï (in contradistinction to other terms for "wife", bhäryä or jäyä). Conversely, the sacrificer must be joined by his wife for his sacrifice to be valid.10 Jaimini, startingJaimini, from the assumption that the patnii ,like her husband ,owns property, emphasizes that the spouses together perform sacrifices and share the benefit. Like her husband, then, the patnii holds an ownership right (svaamitva) in sacrifice. As Stephanie Jamison aptly puts it, the wife, "is simply the female 'Master' of the rites.  

  

Such observations need attention in view of the current attributions of 'patriarchy' to the Vedic culture.
