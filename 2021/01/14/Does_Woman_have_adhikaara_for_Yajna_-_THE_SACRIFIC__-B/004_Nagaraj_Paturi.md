Dear Sri Nithin,

  

Prof. Jan C Heesterman is an Indologist in his own right. BTW, It is Francis X Clooney and not George Cloony.

  

Prof. Heesterman does cite Francis X Clooney, but his essay is not BASED on Francis X Clooney's book.

  

At places he differs with Clooney rather than basing on his book

  

fn 15 :

Clooney thinks that the last two sütras signal a "retreat" from a more liberal view that concédés both ownership and the right to perform sacrifice. As I shall argue further on, they rather specify and consolidate the ritual and jurai position of the patnï. Her position is différent from that of her husband but not necessarily inferior. As Sabara explains (ad sütra 24) the unequal standing means that the prescripts for the wife are différent from those for the sacrificer (atulyatväd asamänavidhänä patnï yajamänena bhavitum arhati

  

fn 43:

The rendering of sütras 2 and 3 differs considerably from that of Jha and Clooney, who take the act (karman) as the subject of sütra 2; but this breaks the continuity of the argument between sütras 2 and 3 (guaranteed by ca in sütra 3). If such a break is intended, one has to read va instead of ca in sütra 3, as indeed K.A. Sarasvati's édition does. At any rate these sütras establish the primacy of the act of sacrifice, and to that end the terms of sütra 3 refer back to those of sütra 1, viz. (abhi)samyoga, abhisambandha.

  

fn 49:

  

Sütras 30 and 31: vaigunyän neti cet (30), "If \[it is argued that the südra is\] not \[entitled to sacrifice\] because of his deficiency\[, what then?\]"; na kämyatvät (31), "No\[, the argument is invalid\], because \[the purpose of sacri fice\] is wished for \[also by the südra\]". Clooney (op. cit. \[η. 2\], p. 191), follow ing Jha, takes sütra 31 to mean that the "desire" (kämyatvät) refers to a wish to remedy the deficiency.  

  

fn 2 :

  

1976, p. 19 and 156f. 2 On the term adhikära see F.X. Clooney, Thinking Ritually. Vienna 1990, p. 179-187; the term is also used to qualify acts and materials. Clooney suggests "domain of compétence" as a paraphrase. As last member of an ad jectival Compound it can be rendered as "applicable to ..." (e.g. sarvädhikära, "applicable to ail", as in Mïmâmsâsûtra \[ed. K.V. Abhyankar and G.A. Joshi, ASS 17\] 6.1.4 \[see below n. 44\] and 27
