Dear Sirs,



Namaskaram.



I am yet to hear from The De Nibili Research Library regarding payment for the copy ordered on their website.



You may like to find out an alternate source for purchasing the copy.



Best regards,

V Srinivas

Namaskaram Sirs.



Thank you very much for your guidance.



I placed the order by providing address, pin & mobile number of Prof. Sri Pandurangi and entered my email id for communication and making payment.



I immediately received following mail from them, but it did not take me to payment page for completing the order.

I believe, I should wait to hear from them for further steps to proceed on payment.
