It took some time, but a very nice person named Jan Korbelik from the De Nobili library responded a couple of days back to me and I have ordered Prof. Clooney's book. I had been thinking about getting this book for some time now, so I ended up ordering it. So they do have some of the old publications still available forsale. Of course the postage ended being the same as the cost of the book - so there's that :-).

  

If you have access to JSTOR, there are a couple of papers whichhe wrote on this topic available. I had downloaded these when I was working for a company which had paid access to JSTOR. I am not sure I should be posting them on a public forum.

  

NOTE: you can create a free account on JSTOR and get access to a few papers at a time for online reading.
