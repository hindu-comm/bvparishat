The thread initiator was not looking for reviews. He seems to be looking for rebuttals.

  

If no rejoinders exist, he wants to encourage one or some.

  

Earlier reviews are not from traditional Sanskrit shaastra scholars.

  

Sri Shyam Akella is looking /asking for reviews from traditional Sanskrit shaastra scholars.

  

A review from Prof. Pandurangi will certainly fill that gap.

  

Prof. Pandurangi or any other traditional or tradition-side scholar may make use of the "Buy me a Book" scheme of Indic Academy to procure the book.

  

Indic Today is Indic Academy's platform where such reviews are readily welcomed.
