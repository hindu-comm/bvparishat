The gap is perhaps a bit difficult to fill:

Traditional pundits have little exposure to these writings

(in addition to having no special need/zeal for mastering English);

and Western/modern scholars have seldom betrayed any ability

to express themselves in Sanskrit. And there is also a

conspicuous absence of interfaces/bridgebuilders.

  

Ultimately, the infrastructure Westerners have provided themselves figures as key here;

Traditional pundits struggle even to survive, after all, thanks to the inimical governments,

by and large, for well over a thousand years, and the worse sequel post-Independence.
