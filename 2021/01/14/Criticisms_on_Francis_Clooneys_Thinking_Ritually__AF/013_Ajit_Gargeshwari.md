Sure yes, Prof Pandurangi asked for 3 copies of a book printed in 1990. A review by an authority on that subject is done for a new book. Citicism and rebuttals can be done any time. Buy me a book scheme is a great initiative by India Academy. I too welcome all criticism and reviews done for books even after 30 or 40 years. Is not all our philosophy continuous review and rebuttals for thousand years or more for instance on Brahma Sutra without any conclusion.
