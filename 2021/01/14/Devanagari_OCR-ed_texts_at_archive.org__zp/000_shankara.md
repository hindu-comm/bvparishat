Namaskar to all,

  

I noticed today that [archive.org](http://archive.org) has started ocr-ing the texts of books in Devanagari script. The text in Devanagari (of course not proof-read) can be downloaded separately or in some cases it is available in the form of text_pdf files.

  

OCR-ed text available in txt format only.

OCR-ed text available in both txt and pdf formats.

GOOGLE BOOKS has beeing providing this facility for more than a year. Here is link to Kathasaritsagara MLBD edition with ocr-ed text.
