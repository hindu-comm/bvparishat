When a *prāḍvivāka* (judge) has to decide whether a particular conduct is right or wrong,

how is he to go about? In other words, how is one to decide what is *dharma* and what is not?

  

This is not a simple question, and the answer cannot be simple either.

Go by *śruti* is the primary rule.

What if there is no *śruti* on the issue?

Go by *smr̥ti* is the next rule.

(Questions that can arise here are: What if there is a conflict between/amongst *śruti*-s themselves?

And so among *smr̥ti*-s themselves? And, again, between *śruti*-s and *smr̥ti*-s? We will not deal

with these here.)

The question again is, what if there is no *smr̥ti* that has a bearing on the issue?

After all, which *smr̥ti* can be exhaustive? There will always be newer and newer situations

and issues. (Thus, *dharma* has to be dynamic. Which is why we do not have any set of

Ten Commandments uniformly applicable for all.)

The answer is - look into *śiṣṭācāra*, the conduct of those who have imbibed  

what dharma is in essence, and live it : didn't the sage say: *rāmo vigrahavān dharmaḥ*?

(That is also what is indicated in the Taittirīya cited by Subrahmanian-ji).

  

But else than this is the conduct of a particular group of people who have been

observing certain norms of conduct, different from ours, from time immemorial.  

(This is their *rūḍhi*). Shall we adjudge their conduct by our yardstics (the *śāstra*)?  

That would be unfair to them.

  

So then, when it is a situation of conflict among themselves, apply their own norms to them.

Do not impose your own rules upon them.

  

This is the exact opposite of Muslims who dream of enforcing the Shariah throughout the world.

Or Christians, theirs. (This is what the Britishers tried to do in the beginning. And it then dawned  

upon them that that would be a strong provocation of people against them. It is then that  

they began to study Manu, and sought to dispense justice as per his ordinances.)

  

One can see the fairness of the principle of equity of our traditional judicial system in ancient times.

Can there be a fairer way of inclusiveness? The current demands of inclusiveness is based on

the essential "principle" (euphemism for suspicion that every man (of course, include "woman"  

here by all means) is a dirty politician, and works in the interests of/to the advantage of  

his own clan/group.  

  

Fairness was the hallmark of our judicial system of yore,

well exemplified in the maxim : *śāstrād rūḍhir balīyasī.*

(Hope my explanation is clear. And for constraints of time,  

I cannot go any further into this please).
