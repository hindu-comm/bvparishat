Dear Sudip Halder ji,

  

It seems to be a modified version of a verse composed by *Vidvan* N Ranganatha Sharma. Please see page 53 of *Ranganatha-lekha-manujusha.*(<https://vidwannrs.in/listing/toc/112>)

  

Sharma ji's original verse is:

  

हरिहरयोरिह भेदं कलयति मूढो न वै विद्वान्।

प्रकृतिस्तयोरभिन्ना प्रत्ययभेदाद् द्विधा भवति।।

  

Only a fool--and not a scholar--discrimantes between Hari and Hara. \[The reason:\] Their intrinsic nature (*prakrti*, verbal base) is one; they appear differently because of varying faiths (*pratyaya*, affix).

  

Evidently, the verse has a beautiful grammatical pun. And fittingly enough, *Vidvan* Ranganatha Sharma was a colossus of Sanskrit grammar.

  

Best regards,
