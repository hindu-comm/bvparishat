Hare Krishna.  

  
\>\> The maxim शास्त्राद् रूढिर् बलीयसी is missed both by Jacob and Bhuvaneśa.  
\>\> But I have countenanced the same in the vyavahāra portion of some dharma-śāstra texts.  
  

Respected Kannan ji,  
If you could elaborate on the above statement, it will be helpful for  
me; the statement in interesting, but obviously needs some vicAra in  
its application.  
  
Also if you can remember in vyavahara portion of which probable  
sastras you came across this maxim, it will be helpful.  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
