Dear Prof. Kannan,

  

I am not sure when he composed the verse. I know he quoted it while speaking at a *Sarva-dharma-sammelana* convened at Dharmasthala. Dr. Ganesh has narrated the incident in*Vani-vahana*, a book on the life and works of Sharma-ji. The date of the *Sammelana* is unknown.

  

Best regards,

Shashi Kiran
