Dear Sri Damodara Das-ji,

I read it some twenty years ago, and can't immediately recall.

  

The gist is this:

The dharma-śāstra-s enunciate broad and general principles of regulation of conduct

at the individual and societal levels. But if a particular group/community of people

have been following a certain rule from time immemorial, they should not be  

compelled to follow what the mainstream follows. Particular *deśācāra* and *kulācāra* rules  

can sometimes overrule a general rule meant for the major followers of dharma.

  

Our judges were thus sensitive to practices among, for example, the tribals,

who had been following a particular code among themselves, and the issue

being examined is also among themselves. As another example,  

those following matriarchy for centuries must not be denied  

the legitimacy of their practice.  

  

This has been stupidly misinterpreted by some as the absence of a universal standard.

This can be a serious issue with the West (and those whose thinking is molded after theirs)

who may insist on just samenesses: a veritable confusion by way of equating  

equity and equality, and uniformity and unity.
