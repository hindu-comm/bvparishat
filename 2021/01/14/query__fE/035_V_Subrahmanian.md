The very Vedic basis for this is enshrined in the Taittiriya Upanishad, शीक्षावल्लिः:अथ यदि ते कर्मविचिकित्सावा वृत्तविचिकित्सावा स्यात् ॥ ३ ॥

ये तत्र ब्राह्मणाः संमर्शिनः। युक्ता आयुक्ताः। अलूक्षा धर्मकामाः स्युः। *यथा ते तत्र वर्तेरन्। तथा तत्र वर्तेथाः।* अथाभ्याख्यातेषु। ये तत्र ब्राह्मणाः संमर्शिनः। युक्ता आयुक्ताः। अलूक्षा धर्मकामाः स्युः। यथा ते तेषु वर्तेरन्। तथा तेषु वर्तेथाः। एष आदेशः। एष उपदेशः। एषा वेदोपनिषत्। एतदनुशासनम्। एवमुपासितव्यम्। एवमु चैतदुपास्यम् ॥ ४ ॥

  

The practitioners are pramaaNa rather than the books, as one would see this valuable instruction to the graduate.
