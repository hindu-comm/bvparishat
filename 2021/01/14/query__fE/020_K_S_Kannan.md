Pāṇini (P) 1.2.56 is quite vocal. Nothing to controvert the same.  

  

Yet Sanskrit poets, poeticians and even grammarians have consistently reminded us  

of the key role of the *pratyaya* over that of *prakr̥ti*.

One can suspect that P's very wordings possibly have inspired them.

P says *pratyayaḥ* and *paraśca*.

The *paratva* of the *pratyaya* is suggestive, in a way, of the corollorial *aparatva*,  

so to say, of *prakr̥ti*. The masculinity and femininity of the two words have also

proved very handy in the hands of poets.

  

Kālidāsa, the best among poets, has himself used the two technical terms

as the standards of comparison for the *vara* and the *vadhū* respectively:

*Raghuvaṁśa* 10.56  

सोऽभव**द्वर-वधू**समागमः  

**प्रत्यय-प्रकृति**-योगसन्निभः \|  

  

*Bhāravi* 13.19 also has employed the two words as the standards of comparison

for Śiva and Arjuna.

  

Jagannātha Paṇḍita has dealt with the former alone in his praise of Brahman:

गुण-वृद्धी परे यस्मिन्नैव स्तः **प्रत्यया**त्मके ।

बुधेषु सदिति ख्यातं तद्ब्रह्म समुपास्महे ॥

  

This metaphysical strain is seen equally well in Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita's *Prauḍha-manoramā* :

उदितवति परस्मिन् **प्रत्यये** शास्त्रयोनौ

 गतवति विलयं च **प्राकृते**ऽपि प्रपञ्चे ।

सपदि पदमुदीतं केवलः **प्रत्ययो** यत्

 तदियदिति मिमीते को हृदा पण्डितोऽपि ? ॥
