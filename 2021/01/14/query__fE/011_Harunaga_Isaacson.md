Shankara referred to theUdbhaṭa-Sāgara edition he linked to as a 1929 one. The 1851 date

is indeed, I think,Śaka. According to the Library of Congress catalogue (the only source I could

find right now) , the first edition of this anthology was published in 1917, and the author

Pūrṇacandra De's dates are 1857-1946.
