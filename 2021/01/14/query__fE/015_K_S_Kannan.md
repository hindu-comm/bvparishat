Great Shankar Rajaraman!

You are close enough.

For vaiyākaraṇa-s, it is *pratyayārtha* that is important

प्रकृति-प्रत्ययौ सहार्थं ब्रूतः,  

तयोः **प्रत्ययार्थः प्रधानम्**

**-** इति वैयाकरण-नयः ।

: in which case, the essential point sought to be made out in the verse

is itself lost!

It can be fine in the mouth of an avaiyākaraṇa.

Cf. the verse cited in *Prauḍha-manoramā* in the context of *iyat.*
