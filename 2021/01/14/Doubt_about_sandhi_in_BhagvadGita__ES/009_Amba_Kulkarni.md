Thank you, Prof. Madhav Deshpande.

  

Right now we were stuck up with the sandhi.

  

However, as you have pointed out, these are special constructions with the verbal root शक्, etc.

I just glanced through the paper. I think our current implementation of such usages is in agreement with the analysis you have discussed.

But what I found interesting was the similarity of such constructions with the 'auxiliary verb' constructions of Hindi as सकता है.

  

I'll read it and get back to you on this if I have any further doubts.

  

Best regards,

Amba
