Dear Amba,

  

  There is a usage in the Mahābhāṣya: शक्यं चानेन श्वमांसादिभिरपि क्षुद् उपहन्तुम्, and there is some useful discussion in Kaiyaṭa's Pradīpa on this passage. There is also some detailed discussion about these usages in my 1980 book: Evolution of Syntactic Theory in Sanskrit Grammar : The Syntax of the Sanskrit Infinitive -tumun. I am attaching the relevant pages from that book. Best wishes,
