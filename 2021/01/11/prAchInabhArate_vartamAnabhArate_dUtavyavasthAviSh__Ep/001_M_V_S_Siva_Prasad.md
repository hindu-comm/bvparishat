There is a possibility to say Anjaneya as the first ambassador.

  

There are many examples like that in both puranam and Mahabharata and kavyas.

  

Kitaraarjuneeya starts with example the secret services in foreign territories who is a spy informing Yudhisthara.

  

The possibility of saying that NARADA MAHARSHI played a duty of an ambassador .

  

There are SCHOLARS here like KANNAN sir , and as well as civil servants like ARAVINDA RAO sir etc.

I feel their opinion is a better one and opens the concepts of the foreign relations in ancient scripts .

  

Thank you sir. Sorry for inconvenience if any.
