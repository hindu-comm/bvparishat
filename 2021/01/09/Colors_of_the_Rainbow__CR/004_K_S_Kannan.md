What I tried to emphasise was the eagerness of some people  

to somehow see "science" in everything; and by "science" they mean

what modern science has discovered (or has not yet disproved).

  

This squarely springs from what is essentially an inferiority complex

\- an eagerness to somehow prove that we match up to \[at least some of the\]

the recent Western achievements, and therefore are not inferior.  

  

The idea that our sages were essentially concerned with a different, indeed much superior, science

never even crosses their mind. Nor can they conjure such a possibility in their mind.

What they are more or less confident is  

\- that there can be no science superior to what the West has achieved today; and  

\- that our sages could not have been proficient in any such science for that matter.

So somehow or the other prove that they knew this very science,

and claim they were "scientific" - in the modern sense, that is.  

  

While it is not the case that some aspects of current science were not understood,

(as in astronomy/mathematics/medicine/consciousness studies) it must be grasped that  

their entire orientation was different, hence their approach, and areas of focus, were too.

  

While Eurocentrism denies them even their legitimate credit,

an inferiority-driven compensatory patriotism sees science  

even where it need not/should not.

  

A good deal of confusion also issues from the layman's inability to differentiate between  

science and technology on the one hand, and the facile equation - of what is convenient today

(= some technology-driven tools), with what is indeed good for us. The current military superiority

and economic superiority of the West also adds to the confusion.

  

I hope my views are balanced.
