Yes, Sri Warrier. The closest I can come to the way the colors in Sunlight are described is in the Gayatri moola mantram, with Mukta, Vidruma, Hema, Neela, Dhavala as the colors of the five faces of Devi Gayatri.

  

I had seen arguments about VIBGYOR as the division of light colors, specially on Indigo. Similarly, Red and Orange seen as separate colors seems fanciful as well.
