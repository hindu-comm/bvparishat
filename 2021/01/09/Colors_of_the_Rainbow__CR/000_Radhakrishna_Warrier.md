Do any of our ancient works, in Sanskrit, Prakrit or other ancient languages, mention by name the colors of the rainbow? Do they mention that the rainbow has seven colors or that the Sun’s rays are composed of seven colors?

I know that many ancient works describe the Sun as travelling in a chariot drawn by seven horses. But I don’t think that this number seven has anything to do with the seven “VIBGYOR” colors. This is because there is nothing fundamental about the number seven in this case. The visible light is a continuous spectrum of electromagnetic waves that range from violet at one end to red at the other. We can choose to divide this spectrum into any number of shades, not necessarily only seven. I think it is Newton who came up with this number seven to match with the seven notes of music. Just that our language should have enough color-names to name all those segments into which we choose to divide the spectrum of the visible light. I say this because I have heard and read people remarking that our ancients “knew” that light is composed of seven colors and hence the allegory of the seven horses of the Sun’s chariot. As if this number seven had some fundamental quality and was of some great significance in the case of light. If at all our ancients divided the visible light into different colors, I think they would have chosen some number like 6 (the number of seasons in ancient reckoning) or 12 (the number of months in ancient calendar) or some such number and need not necessarily seven. Any number is valid, not just seven.

We have splendid poetry, brilliant philosophy, and well researched science in our ancient works. But the tendency to seek science where science was not intended appears comic.
