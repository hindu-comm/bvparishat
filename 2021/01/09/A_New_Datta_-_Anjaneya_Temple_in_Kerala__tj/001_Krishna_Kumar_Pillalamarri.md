Sir, I can't thank you enough for sharing the news about this beautiful, splendid aalayam. I have not seen such architecture and attention to detail in new temples lately. The artwork is so good, that one needs to spend time looking at the details. Most interestingly, the Keerti Mukhams in this temple offer a slight change from the traditional ones, though not in any substantive way to change the meaning of the original concept. I have made a wish for myself to go see this temple on my visit to India. Since I could not read Malayalam, can you please share where exactly is this temple? Thanks once again.

  

Regards,

  

Krishna Kumar Pillalamarri
