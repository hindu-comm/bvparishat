Namaste Kalyanasundaram Ji.

  

Thanks for sharing this with us. I have experienced a similar situation with respect to the Indian culture and traditions in several humanities forums as well over the last 3 decades at top universities here (Harvard, Caltech and UCSD). Unfortunately in many cases when I confronted, it became clear that funding sources as well as ignorance both contribute to a selectivenarrative or biased presentation of ourheritage. Collectively lots to be done to educate, fund, and correct these narratives in India and abroad because it would help bring all humanitytogether based upon the universal basis of the Vedic culture and philosophy.  

  
Best Regards,
