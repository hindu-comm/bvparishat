# [*Western Foundations of the Caste System*](https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9783319387604)

"This book argues that the dominant descriptions of the ‘caste system’ are rooted in the Western Christian experience of India. Thus, caste studies tell us more about the West than about India. It further demonstrates the imperative to move beyond this scholarship in order to generate descriptions of Indian social reality."
