De Simini, F. (2020). Navigating the Ocean of Dharma: The Composition of Sanskrit Scriptural Digests in the Dharmaśāstra and Śaiva Siddhānta Traditions,*Journal of Abbasid Studies*,*7*(2), 264-287. doi:<https://doi.org/10.1163/22142371-12340058>

**Abstract**: "Scholars of Sanskrit literature in the second millenniumCEhad to deal with sizeable collections of sources claiming authority on different branches of knowledge and human experience. The need for ordering such sources went hand in hand with the establishment of “canons” of authoritative texts. This article will explore the topic of the composition of digests in two main traditions — the Dharmaśāstra and the Śaiva Siddhānta — to illustrate the breadth of this phenomenon, both in terms of its popularity and of its chronological range."
