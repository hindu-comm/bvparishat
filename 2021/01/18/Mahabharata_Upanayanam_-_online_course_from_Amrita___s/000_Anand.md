Namah Shivaya All,

Amrita University is launching an online course on Mahabharata, ‘Mahabharata Upanayanam’. As the name suggests it is intended as an initiation into Mahabharata, for people who want to explore theitihasa, but don’t really know where to begin. This course is an introduction to the multidimensionality of thisitihasa, with its textual traditions, complex characters, profound stories, insightful conversations etc.

More importantly this course will equip participants to tap the perennial source of wisdom that is Mahabharata, and enable them to apply it in their life.
