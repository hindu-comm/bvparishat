Does anyone have the Paribhasha Sangraha Commentary on Vedantana Paribhasha? It is by Panchanana Bhattacharya as given in the preface.

  

I did find another useful resource online which is Notes of Cochin King on this text. I have Arthadipika and Maniprabha with me. If there are any other useful commentaries please share.
