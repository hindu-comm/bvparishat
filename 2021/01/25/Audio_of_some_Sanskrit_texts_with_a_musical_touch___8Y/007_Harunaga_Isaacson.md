Dear Prof. Kannan,

  

Many thanks indeed to you and Dr. Meera for releasing this movingly beautiful recording.

(Regarding the Romanized Sanskrit text, a few queries below. Some may have to do with

my not having yet understood the principles used in transliteration.)

  

With thanks and appreciation again,

  

Harunaga Isaacson
