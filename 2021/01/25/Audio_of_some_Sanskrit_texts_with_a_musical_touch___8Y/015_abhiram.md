Yes sir,

The verse is from Aitareya Brahmana:

कलिः शयानो भवति संजिहानस्तु द्वापरः ।

उत्तिष्ठंस्त्रेता भवति कृतं संपद्यते चरंश्चरैवेति ॥

  

I would consider this to be a more symbolic and practical approach to the idea of yugas. But in Puranic perspective, I believe they are conceived as quite fundamental in the framework of the universe. Is this not correct?

  

Regards,

Abhiram
