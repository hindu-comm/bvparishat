Very heartfelt and beautiful singing by Dr. Meera.

  

Dr. Kannan, I have one question. One verse says that the Yugas only happen in Bharatavarsha. Any reason given for this? I thought the Yugas are just universal attributes of time. So yugas would be valid anywhere in the world.

  

Regards,

Abhiram
