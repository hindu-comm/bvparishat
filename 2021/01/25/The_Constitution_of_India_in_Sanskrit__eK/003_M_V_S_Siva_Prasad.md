Respected scholars ,

  

I am presenting some personal opinions of mine. If any person's sentiment hurts please pardon me for that.

  

1\. It's a 1985 edition . Even i haven't born when it was written.

2\. No updation of it .

3\. Sanskrit speaking People get anger when they hear the word Sanskrit is a dead language but I my self don't hesitate to say that Sanskrit is in Coma by seeing the non-updation of constitution since 1985/1986.

4\. Out of all the classical languages only Sanskrit don't have updation of constitution.

5\. No institution in India including all the Sanskrit universities has a subject of constitution in Sanskrit language.

6\. I haven't saw any person speaking / teaching about the Constitution in Sanskrit .

7\. Not having any prestigious exams like SHALAKA exam for constitution.

8\. Every year some Sanskrit scholars gets president awards but no one had taken the initiative to update the Constitution as I know.

9\. You are very proud there is a Sanskrit translation for constitution but iam very sorrowful to say that the best language in the world and the most suitable language even for computers , Deva bhasha , having great vyakarana scholars don't have any interest to update the Constitution.

10\. Proud to have the Constitution in Sanskrit is fair but the candidates studying constitution either for civil services or for law don't show any interest in the version of 1985.

11.Even if you want to purchase the book of Constitution of India in Sanskrit language . It's not available.

Neither reprint nor revised editions available.

12\. As far as I know my brother the last purchaser of that book who bought nearly 4 or 5 copies some years ago after that when I contacted for another that's not available from the seller only one copy left which is saved for the reprint or revised edition.

  

Here is a group of sanskrit scholars and some institution heads including IAS /IPS officers working for Sanskrit and culture .

  

I request all of them to please consider my opinion for the updating constitution in Sanskrit language .

  

University faculties and other government officials are requested to take an initiative to teach the updated Constitution in Sanskrit language as a compulsory subject for PRAK -SASTRY /SASTRY/ACHARYA courses and I request to promote VIDYAVARIDHI i.e. p.hd in constitution in Sanskrit language in Central Sanskrit universities .

  

Other Sanskrit promoters like SAMSKRITA BHARATHI are requested to take initiatives like SHALAKA in constitution in Sanskrit language in their yearly shalaka .

  

Please imagine once that when a Sanskrit students come in front of mic and tells the provisions of the Constitution in Sanskrit language without seeing any book.

  

The world only see the Sanskrit language as an ancient one.

Only scientific people feel that Sanskrit is even modern although it's an ancient language.

But by the initiative like SHALAKA in constitution in Sanskrit languages makes the common people to understand that the Sanskrit is still having it's potential for the social structures .

  

As I know Sanskrit scholars respects smruties which are dharma sastras.

If constitution in Sanskrit is promoted they will give the same respect to the Constitution also.

  

Hence I request all the scholars and govt. officials to think on the requests i made and please act so that in future the Sanskrit language which is in coma condition will revive from it .

  

Sorry for inconvenience if any .

  

Thank you.
