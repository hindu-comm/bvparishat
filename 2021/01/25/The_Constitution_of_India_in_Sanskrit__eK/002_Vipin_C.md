Namaste Kalyanasundaram Ji.

  

What a pleasure to see this---thanks for sharing. It is so nice to see at the outset that the word used is "sampradaya nirpekchha" and not "dharma nirpekchha"---hope this really is addressed at some time points to bring back "Dharma" in our constitution and consciousness.  

  
Best Regards,
