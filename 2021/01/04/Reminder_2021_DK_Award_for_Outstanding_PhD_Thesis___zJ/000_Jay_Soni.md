Dear Colleagues,  
In wishing you a most happy and safe New Year 2021, allow me to remind  
you that further applications for the Award are still welcome, by 31  
January 2021.  
  
As already pointed out, the IASS has decided to keep to the original  
proposed date of the World Sanskrit Conference in January 2021 (and  
not the now postponed date of January 2022). The Award has otherwise  
always been coupled with a WSC.  
  
The DK Award for an outstanding doctoral thesis on Sanskrit and  
related studies was inaugurated in 2006 by the International  
Association of Sanskrit Studies at the World Sanskrit Conference in  
Edinburgh, in collaboration with DK Agencies, Delhi. The IASS thanks  
Mr Ramesh Mittal of DK Agencies personally and DK Agencies as a firm  
for supporting Sanskrit scholarship in a generous way: One Thousand  
USD worth of books from DK Agencies.  
  
Please see the details of the DK Award here:

NOTE: The website will not be changed to say that the 2021 DK Award  
this time is NOT coupled with a WSC.  
  
With best wishes and apologies for cross-postings,  
yours sincerely,  
Jayandra Soni
