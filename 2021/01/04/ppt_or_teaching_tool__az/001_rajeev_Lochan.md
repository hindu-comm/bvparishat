Hello,

My guruji has published an app. A free and an ad-free app as well.

All Krishna Yajur Veda mantras are planned to be added to this.

The upanishad and some sooktas are added right now. Aranyakas are in the process of being added.

The methodology is similar to guru shishya parampara where the teacher teaches para patha first, then club, and finally chant together.

Try it out and kindly let me know if it helps.

  

Regards,

Rajeev
