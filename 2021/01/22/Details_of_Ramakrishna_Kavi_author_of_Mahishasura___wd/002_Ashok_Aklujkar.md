Dear Prof. Paturi,

  

A few years ago, I tried to collect information about the personal life of Pt. Ramakrishna Kavi. I will publish it when my other writing commitments allow me to do so. However, I should clarify that I did not
succeed in any truly satisfactory way.

  

Similarly, to the best of my recollection, i did not translate any part of the amazing Mahishasura-mardinā-stotra. At the most, I might have orally explained a verse or a pāda to an inquisitive bystander.I am glad to gather from your email that my learned and multi-talented friend Prof. M.M. Deshpande has translated the whole stotra.

  

Best wishes.

  

a.a.
