Many thanks, Ajitji, for the information and the clarification - I am grateful. M. Witzel had told me to look up T. Mahadevan's article in HOS Opera Minora 9 - I believe he was referring to this Vedic Sakhas volume, but yes, it is different from the opera maiora series. I will try to find the individual articles on Academia.edu.
