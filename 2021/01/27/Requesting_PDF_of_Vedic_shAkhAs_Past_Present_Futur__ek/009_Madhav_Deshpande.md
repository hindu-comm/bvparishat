Dear Ajit Ji,

  

  Thanks for sharing this article. The title reminds me of the Vedic affiliation of my own family. We used to say: आश्वलायनसूत्र-शाकलशाखाधयायी. So our Sūtra was the Āśvalāyanasūtra, but our Vedic Saṃhitā was the Śākala Saṃhitā. The Āśvalāyana-Saṃhitā of the R̥gveda was until recently considered to be lost, and was found in a few villages in North India and recently published. So, I assume that by following the Āśvalāyana-Sūtra and having the Śākala-Saṃhitā, my ancestors were making some sort of accommodation. There was no Āśvalāyana-Saṃhitā available, and there was no Śākala-Sūtra available.
So these two were traditionally put together to make a functional connection.
