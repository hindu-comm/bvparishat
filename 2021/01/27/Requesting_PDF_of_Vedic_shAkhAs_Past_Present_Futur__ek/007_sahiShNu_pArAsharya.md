He didn't give me a title. I had asked Prof Witzel a question about the migration of the Taittiriyas to the south and in what century this may have occurred historically. He gave me an estimate and asked me to look up Mahadevan's article in HOS Op Min 9. So, I'm guessing it was the paper on the Kausitaki school, maybe there are some details in it he wanted me to look at. (I found the ToC on Academia, and there are quite a few other papers I wanted to read too, so I was looking for the entire volume's PDF.)

  

But for now, this one:The Kauṣītaki school of the Rgveda: A Veda caraṇa without a saṁhitā – Thennilapuram Mahadevan. I would be grateful if you can share it. :)

  

many thanks,

Sahishnu
