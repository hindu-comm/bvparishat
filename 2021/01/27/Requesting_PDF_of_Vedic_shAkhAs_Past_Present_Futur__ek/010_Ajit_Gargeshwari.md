Probably due to this reason in the pravara I was thought and which I recite there is no distinctionof which shakaha of rig Veda we learnt in the past

  

Chatussagara Paryantam Go Brahmanebhyah Shubham Bhavatu ,Angirasa, Bharhaspatya, Bhardavaja Traya rishayaha Pravaranvita

Bhardavaja Gotrah, Ashwalayana Sutrah, Rikshakha Adhyayi Sri.... Aham Bho Abhivadaye

  

Here there is no distinctionof which shakaha of rig Veda we learn
