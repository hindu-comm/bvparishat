The Caravan and The Wire are notorious for their (rabid socialist) bias - they will systematically present half-evidence, pose slanted questions, and employ strategic silence on certain issues to get their propaganda across, based on overt or covert Marxist-Leninist ideology. No matter the issue, no matter the argument - the conclusion is always predetermined. I have observed the latter publication for a while: they do this remarkably and with great consistency. In fact, I also noticed that nearly all authors of articles of The Wire are somehow connected to JNU - either they have a degree from there, or they taught there at some point, but it's always a closed network which pushes its agenda. From internal sources, I am told that it is run by the JNU coterie around Rahul Gandhi. And this is borne out by the evidence, since I have never seen them criticize Rahul Gandhi, not once.

  

Two examples: (a) In the aftermath of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, an article at The Wire actually said that it was not Rahul Gandhi who did not deserve to govern; rather, it was India, and the Indian electorate, who do not deserve a leader like Rahul Gandhi. (b) One article argued shortly after the Article 370 abrogation that Muslims have a greater right to India because Hindus cremate their dead, whereas Muslims bury their dead in the ground and have been doing so for centuries (and have become part of the Indian land mass), they have a greater claim to the lands of India.

  

The sheer argumentative prowess! It puts the logicians of the world to shame!
