I submitted the following comment on the article page of Caravan magazine .:

  

> 
> > Time for upper castes to apply for privileges under the Constitution > as a religious minority. Non-upper caste Hindus too do not belong to a > single majority religion. They too should apply for minority > privileges as different communities belonging to different minority > religions. There will be no majority religion left in the country. Or, > will the present minority religions turn into majority religions and > lose all the privileges under the Constitution ? Or should they, the > new majority declare a theocratic state of that newly realized > majority religion ? >
