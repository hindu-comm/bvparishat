"The article I am writing for the CSDS actually talks about these issues and holds these examples up": good; appreciate that and thank you.

  

"my work isn't in Indology per se": I ask this out of academic interest: to which domain (or whichever word you prefer) do you see your work belonging to? (feel free to respond in private if that is preferred)

  

"This is the kind of prejudice that I am talking about. None of the authors seem to have read the publications edited by Prof Kannan, and yet they are all passing judgment on how this is all about the Hindu Right (caste, communalism, Hindutva, etc.). :-/": amongst other things, I am mildly curious to know which framework they used to conclude left and right. Was it Nolan's chart?

  

"On the delineation issue, I am inclined to disagree slightly. In most cases, these are never specified (which is precisely what makes it harder to detect unless you know exactly what to look for) - but the caveat is that the argument ceases to be in the discipline of Indology, it shifts to the fields of philosophy, sociology and politics. So, in critiquing the theory and the method, the work won't be in Indology at all, but nonetheless, it is something that has to be done - at some point or the other, by someone or the other.": I sense substantive agreement actually when you say this. The caveat, in particular, is appreciated. I have some thoughts about "...know what exactly to look for" but we can perhaps spare the group :) and exchange notes individually, if necessary.

  

Thanks for the pdfs and also for confirming it was you who sent that message on Academia.

  

I really do look forward to reading the two papers youhave alluded to: one with which this thread commenced and the one you mentioned you are writing for CSDS. Good luck.

  

Best,

Megh
