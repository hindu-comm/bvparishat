I came across this article today by coincidence while looking for something else entirely. The Gaya reference and mention of shraddha traditions caught the karmakandin's suspicious eye.

  

In this article, Tomoka Mushiga employs a variant of the Marxist historian and theorist Eric Hobsbawms's concept of 'invented traditions' to argue that since the extant practices of the sampurna-gaya-sraddha is not found in the puranas and the colonial administrator played a role in regularizing it, it is an 'invented tradition'. Nonetheless she says (p. 56) that her approach is different from Hobsbawm, but in the same paragraph, she writes 'the concept of invented tradition and its features, which Hobsbawm submitted, help the analysis of this article'.

  

She documents (what she considers) the sastrika and vidhivat shraddha based on the puranic evidence and the prayog manuals, and having interviewed and observed the practiced rituals, she concludes that the pandits 'take shortcuts' and do not maintain do the full procedure (apparently, she does not understand the concept of 'anukalpa'!). She furthermore cites that a certain standardization (among which lists of tirthas could be visited and at what fee) was made by a British tax collector Mr Thomas Law, thus it was a recent (and a colonial) development, and a mid-twentieth century priest Mukut Bihari Gautam composed the expanded paddhati which is used everywhere. Based on these, she concludes confidently that sampurna-gaya-shraddha as adhered to in Gaya today is asastrika and an invented tradition without any continuity with (what she thinks are) the sastras, and argues that this is how sastras were historically created, that they are a 'factitious continuity between the past and the present'.

  

I looked closely at the evidence presented and the arguments made. She has cited a representative set of the relevant puranas, nibandhas and paddhatis, but her analysis and conclusion are completely mistaken, because she uses the wrong frame to interpret it. (1) What she misses (and remains oblivious to) is that karmakanda isn't so literal and text-based. (2) She appears to have seen the puranas and nibandas are some sort of biblical Ur-sastra, from which all extant regional practices are deviations or corruptions. (3) She appears to have - god knows why - presumed that the sastric process somehow stopped at the nibandhas, and later contributions by priests are not part of that sastra.

  

I am considering writing a rejoinder to the journal to point these out.

  

\[For those unfamiliar with Marxist theory, the 'invented tradition' theory says that while traditions may claim to be old, they may be recent transformations which then claim to be old, in order to legitimize current cultural practices. Following Hobsbawm, this theory was previously used by other Marxists like Benedict Anderson to argue than the concept of the 'nation' was but an 'imagined community' which legitimized the Marxist anathema against 'nationalism' of any kind, and of course, our own Romila Thapar who confidently took a cue and argued that 'Hinduism' was an 'imagined community' too.\]
