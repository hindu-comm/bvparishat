To take a direct example, an earlier post in BVP drew attention to an article published in Contributions to Indian Sociology by Axel Michaels, where he argues in favor of an ethno-sociology of India, in the sense that any sociology of India must be informed by Indological and other considerations - and yet he throws in the casual remark about how 'unfortunate' the Swadeshi Indology is (as a chauvinist reactionary project that has risks for reductionism and essentialism, and thus liable for easy dismissal). Also attached is the comments by various authors and Michaels's reply.

  

This is the kind of prejudice that I am talking about. None of the authors seem to have read the publications edited by Prof Kannan, and yet they are all passing judgment on how this is all about the Hindu Right (caste, communalism, Hindutva, etc.). :-/

  

The article I am writing for the CSDS actually talks about these issues and holds these examples up; my work isn't in Indology per se, but the intellectual equipment (theories and methods) we employ, and the importance of intellectual transparency and honesty.
