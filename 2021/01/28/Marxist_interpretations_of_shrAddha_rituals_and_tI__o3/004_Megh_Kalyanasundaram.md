Namaste Sahishnu-ji,

  

Glad you might find use for the resource shared. Thanks for the tip about Dr. Vajpeyi'sbook.

If I am not mistaken, it was you who left a message vide Academia messaging on Nov 29th.

Everything I say in this note is an independent view and not written as a representative of any organisation or group:

Again, look forward to reading your engagement on this specific topic. Good luck and best wishes.
