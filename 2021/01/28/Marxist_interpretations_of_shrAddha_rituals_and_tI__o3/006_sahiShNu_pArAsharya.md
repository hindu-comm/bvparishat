Yes, that is a seminal paper - I have read it and my inspiration is from their works as well!

  

Yes, that was me on Academia.

  

On #4, yes, that is what I meant: both the specific and the generic must be done. On the delineation issue, I am inclined to disagree slightly. In most cases, these are never specified (which is precisely what makes it harder to detect unless you know exactly what to look for) - but the caveat is that the argument ceases to be in the discipline of Indology, it shifts to the fields of philosophy, sociology and politics. So, in critiquing the theory and the method, the work won't be in Indology at all, but nonetheless, it is something that has to be done - at some point or the other, by someone or the other. (I am in no way diminishing the existing work of SI, but merely saying it has its work cut out ahead.)

  

Warmly,

Sahishnu
