Look forward to reading your rejoinder, Sahiṣṇu Pārāśarya-ji.  

  

In case not seen, at least the following sections of Dr. Dilip Chakrabarti's recently released book*Nationalism in the Study of Ancient Indian History*might be of academic interest and perhaps of some resonance.

  

> 
> > 5.III*Communists in control of Ancient Indian Historical Research: > the case of the ICHR and other issues* (pp. 293-300) >
> 
> > 
> > 5.IV*The Notion of Early Mediaeval India*(pp. 300-1) >
> 
> > 
> > 5.V *Other variants of Communist approach to Ancient India* (pp. > 301-8) >
