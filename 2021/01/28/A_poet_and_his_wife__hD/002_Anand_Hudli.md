Namamsi,

  

What happens when the wife writes a poem? Will the husband throw it away? He dare not!

Here is my verse:

  

कवयित्री लिखत्यद्धि काव्यं तस्याः पतिः सदा ।

भार्याभीतेः पठित्वा तं स्तौति तां स रसज्ञवत्॥

Whatever poem a wife writes, the husband, out of fear , reads it and praises her, as if he were a knower of the Rasas.

  

Anand
