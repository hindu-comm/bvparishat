Malayalam “nagaram” (നഗരം), Kannada “nagara” (ನಗರ) and Telugu “nagaramu” (నగరము) are all ancient tatsama-s of Sanskrit “nagara” meaning city.
The word final “m” or “mu”, or the lack of either is as per the loaning tradition of each of these languages. Besides these forms, each of these languages has a very modern loan from north India in the form “nagar” (example the modern “Maṇipravāḷa” placename “Ampalanagar” in which “Amplalam” is a pure Malayalam word meaning temple and “nagar” is a modern tatsama from Hindi meaning city.) 

Tamil also has these two forms “nagaram” (written “nakaram”, நகரம்) and “nagar” (written “nakar”, நகர்). Contrary to our expectation, the form “nagar” in Tamil is not a modern import from the north. It seems to be quite ancient, from the time when north Indian languages had not yet lost the word final “a” (i.e., when it was “nagara” in north Indian languages and had not yet become “nagar”). 

The question is, from where did this “nagar” come into Tamil in the ancient days?
