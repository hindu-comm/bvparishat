We are launching a political petition and we would like to add a Sanskrit version of it if someone can help us translate this. Humble request, would be much obliged. We plan to launch the petition on the 25th.

thx,

Background:  
India needs a strong opposition to be a successful democracy. Only a successful democracy can guarantee individual rights and freedoms.  
  
In the Lok Sabha, the Congress party is the largest opposition party but it has only 52 seats. With 303 seats the BJP has nearly six times the number of seats of the Congress! This is not a good sign for India’s democratic future.  
  
Why still the Congress?  
It is the only opposition party that has a national presence. In both the 2014 & 2019 elections, they won more than 19% of the votes. The next closest party was just over 4%. This is about one-fifth of what the Congress got.

  
What needs to be done?  
Congress needs to reconnect with the people, especially the youth. However, it is seen more as a family-driven party and not as a party where people can grow based on talent and merit. In July 2019, even Rahul Gandhi wisely asked for a non-Gandhi president to be elected.  
  
Our demands are simple:  
1. Have free and fair elections starting for key posts especially the Congress Working Committee and President.  
2. A term limit of two on a president will allow fresh talent to come up in the party.  
3. No immediate family members should hold key posts at the same time.  
  
We believe that these are the first steps to revive Congress.   
  
Urgency:  
We believe the time is very short for the Congress. The past few election results are a serious wake-up call. We urge the Congress leadership to do this and more by August 15th, 2021.  
  
If these minimal actions are not taken by our 75th Independence day, then we the people may be forced to look at other options. And that may over time lead to shutting down the party. That will be a sad day and we hope that won’t come to be.
