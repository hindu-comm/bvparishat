Unless a technical term, pAribhAShika shabda, domain specific word, we should respect whatever language we use and use it without mixing with other. Applies to folks using just a few Hindi words in English and thinking they are Hindi speakers (I have only seen this mostly in Hindi, not sure if other speakers have the problem as well)

  

Using Sanskrit in English applies only to discussion of Sanskrit works. Where there are indeed words that if translated will need a paragraph to follow and might as well use the Sanskrit word.

  

Else, all English words can be translated into Sanskrit, so slowly we should speak Sanskrit and not English. :)  
  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
