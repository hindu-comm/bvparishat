**Who do English language belongs to, anyway?**

-   Does English belong to UK? Does it belong to USA and Australia too?
    How about South Africa, Singapore, … Is this list limited? Does
    India too belong to this list? Yes, it does. Worldwide, many
    organizations have given recognition to Indian English. You might
    have noticed this in Microsoft products, etc. -   Oxford English Dictionary (OED) World English Editor said that
    Indian speech etiquette features a complex system of kinship terms
    and terms of address, in which age, gender, status, and family
    relationships are marked by a highly specific vocabulary with no
    direct equivalents in English. Here is a sample list of Indian words
    from Telugu, Urdu, Tamil, Hindi and Gujarati languages added to OED
    during 2019.

      B - bachcha, bada din, bada, bapu, bas, bhindi, blank call, bhelpuri, bhavan, badmash

      E - ek dum,  
      F - funda,  
      G - gosht, gulab jamun, gully, ghee, ganja,

      T - tappa, timepass,  
      U - udyog,  
      V - vada,  
      Y - yaar   

-   English was originally brought to what is now called Britain by
    Anglo-Saxon settlers from northwest Germany, West Denmark and the
    Netherlands. But the language that we nowadays call English has been
    changed almost out of recognition by the passing of time, and even
    more influentially, the impact of other languages. It is estimated
    that words borrowed from other languages make up around 80% of the
    English language. As the author James D. Nicoll has noted: ‘We don't
    just borrow words; on occasion, English has pursued other languages
    down alleyways to beat them unconscious and rifle their pockets for
    new vocabulary.” One of the reasons why English has such a huge
    vocabulary- estimated to be more than two million words, though not
    all are in current use- is that English has borrowed words from up
    to 350 other languages. Some of the biggest contributions come from
    Latin and Greek, and French- via the Norman invasion of 1066.

“**Unless a technical term, pAribhAShika shabda, domain specific word, we should respect whatever language we use and use it without mixing with other**”. Had people followed this unwritten rule in toto, imagine where English language would have been today?  

English language as such is open for change and ready to embrace new words from all languages including Sanskrit. Only required thing is, people like us should shun our inhibitions and enrich English language with more Sanskrit words.
