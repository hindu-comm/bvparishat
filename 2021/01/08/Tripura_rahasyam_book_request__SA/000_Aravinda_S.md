Dear Members,

  

I need to read Tripura rahasyam (both Jnana Khandam and Mahtmya Khandam). Can anyone please specify where can I get the Sanskrit copy of Tripura rahasyam.

  

The soft copy available in the net is from Ramanashram but it doesn't contain the original sanskrit text. I need the book with Sanskrit text either with meaning in Kannada or English or without meaning is also fine. But I need it in Devanagari lipi. The one available in the net is the copy edited by Gopinath Kaviraj and its very old. Difficult to read. Actually I want hard copy of the book.

  

Any suggestions please...?

  

I am living in Chennai. I can even go to Bengalore if the book is available.

  

Sincerely

Aravinda
