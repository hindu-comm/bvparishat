Dear BVK,

Anyway, you have ended it all - with the significant saying

("That's good"!) i.e.  

तत् सत् !

So why worry then?!

All's well that ends well!

  

BTW, given the high standing you have in Hindu religious circles,

somebody will copy your verses presented on a holy day,  

and repeat them at the end of some *śānti* at home!

And sure, the *puṇya* will all accrues to your account!
