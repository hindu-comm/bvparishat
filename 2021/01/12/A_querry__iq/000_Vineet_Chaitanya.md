Respected Scolars,

  

 What exactly is the status of the following mantra which occurs in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, chapter five as a first mantra?  

QUOTE

  

1\. purāṇam adaḥ, pῡrṇam idam, pῡrṇāt pῡrṇam udacyate  
pῡrṇasya pῡrṇam ādāya pῡrṇam evāvaśiṣyate.

  

UNQUOTE

  

 According to Shankar bhashya it occurs in "khila kanda of the upanishad.

  

In particular I want to know:  

  

 Will it be counted as a shruti?

 Is its status lower than other shruti mantras?

  

Do different schools of Vedanta agree on that?

Is there any discussion between various schools of Vedant which is available on the web?

  

Regards
