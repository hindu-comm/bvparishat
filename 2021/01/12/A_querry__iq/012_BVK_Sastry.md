Namaste Prof. KSK



( Please take the response in a lighter vein for a hearty laugh; It is pointing to the looming threat of automated digital correction- auto correlations- that will flow in to the design of Artificial intelligence, Dictionaries and Machine Translations through the logical- program gates of computational linguistics, that will be delivered over social media and web repositories. The last line of sanskrit text below ( a parody crafted by me) was ‘ human corrected’ by me to please the machine ! ).



1. I agree on the threat reading \< These days, there is the looming fear of autocorrection

in mobiles and laptops.>, for which the ' auto-correction / auto-correlation feature' in smart devices and applications holds the full responsibility, under the authority of ' Techno-linguist' .



2. On \< (Sadists teachers really are - for they so grudge giving marks liberally to students!)> Would machines be intentionally sadist or
designed for ' mindless - perfection enforcement ? \> would be an issue for future deliberation !



यदक्ष्रर- पद - भ्रष्टं, मात्रा-हीनं च यद्भवेत्

तत्सर्वं क्षम्यतां देव , गणकेश नमोऽस्तु ते । 



विसर्ग -बिन्दु-मात्राणि, पद-पादाक्षराणि च ।

न्यूननि चातिरिक्तनि क्षमस्व गणकेश्वर॥



अपराध सहस्राणि टङ्कने क्रियन्ते मया ।

दासोऽयमिति मां मत्वा क्षमस्व गणकाच्युत ॥



अन्यथा ऽऽ चरणं नस्ति त्वमेव करणं मम ।

तस्मत् कारुण्य- भावेन टङ्कितं रक्ष दोषतः ॥
