For me there are additional complications because of "old age" COVID fear etc.

I know some of the keys on my keyboard are not working properly, but I want to

minimize interaction with others, so I am just postponing registering request for its repair.

  

By the way, I found your narration of the "autocorrelation incident" that I have made a separate note of it.

  

Regards and thanks.
