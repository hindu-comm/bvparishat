Thank you very much Prof. Kannan ji.

I am glad to know that the mantra in *Atharva Veda* 10.8.29

is very close to the mantra under discussion.

  

S WAMI K RISHNANANDA, The Divine Life Society Sivananda treats 5.1.1 also as shanti path.

I am also not clear about the status of shanti paths.  

  

I would appreciate comments on the status of shanti paths.

  

Regards
