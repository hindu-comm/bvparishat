Respected Chaitanya-ji,

  

I was sure you won't feel offended by my pointing out

the typos. These days, there is the looming fear of autocorrection

in mobiles and laptops.

  

I had to struggle a bit in fact to send you this mail,

because when I wanted to show the wrong spelling,

it would autocorrect it, and put the correct spelling in its place

without my knowledge!

  

I tend to be a bit overly cautious in respect of spelling, syntax etc.;

and it was for this very reason that I committed not-too-small a blunder once!

I had set a question paper for a final exam, and when I went to the Press for proof-correction,

he gave the pages of the QPaper in a bit of a scrambled sequence: p.4, p.1, p.3, p.2 etc.

And I was aghast that even in the 2nd proof I had left several words uncorrected:

there were so many wrong Sanskrit sentences right in the beginning of the page!  

How could I be *this* careless?!:I began to make the corrections meticulously.  

  

It was when I put the pages in the proper order that I realised the cause of the "blunder":

They were all sentences given *for correction of errors*, and the heading viz.

"Correct the errors in the following sentences" was the last line in the *previous* page!

Now I had to "re-correct" my "corrections", and restore the wrong forms!  

  

Thus, it is sometimes wrong to be right (and right to be wrong)!!

  

And if I had indeed corrected all those errors, I would have been in error!

That would be something a teacher can curse himself very much for,

for he will have to *give free marks to students* (for the fault of asking a wrong question)!

(Sadists teachers really are - for they so grudge giving marks liberally to students!)

  

Indeed, *sahasā vidadhīta na kriyām !!*
