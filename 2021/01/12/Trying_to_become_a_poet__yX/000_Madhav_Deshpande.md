Trying to become a poet

  

सर्वे कोशा मयाधीता अष्टाध्यायी मुखोद्गता ।

वन्दे सरस्वतीं नित्यं प्रतीक्षे कवितामहम् ।।

  

I have studied all dictionaries. I have memorized the eight chapters of Panini’s grammar. I always offer obeisance to Sarasvati, the goddess of speech. Now I am waiting to become a poet.
