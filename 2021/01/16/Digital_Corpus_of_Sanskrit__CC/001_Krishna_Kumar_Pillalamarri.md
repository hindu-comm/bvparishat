Dear Sri Kashyap,

  

I tried this web site, and got some Latvian words and quotes. I quickly got out of it. Before that, I tried a few words, and did not get any response for the dictionary meaning as well. It does not appear to be created by Indians, does it? Or am Imissing something?

  

Regards,

  

Krishna Kumar Pillalamarri
