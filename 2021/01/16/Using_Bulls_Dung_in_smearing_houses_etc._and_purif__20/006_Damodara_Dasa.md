Hare Krishna.  
  
Yes, Subrahmanyam ji. I accept that.  
  
So you want to say that in achara of shishtas (in your lineage and  
many others) both practice is found -- using cow dung as well as using  
bull dung to smear houses, for cooking, and for homas (based on what  
is desired and what is practical) correct?  
  
If so then my question is answered.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
