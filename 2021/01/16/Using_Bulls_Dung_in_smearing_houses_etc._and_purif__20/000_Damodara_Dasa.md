Hare Krishna.  
  
Respected vidvaj-janas,  
  
This has been a practical question in our small villages (where we  
live in houses with mud floors) and also use some cowdung for cooking.  
Whenever it is said "gomaya" in sastras for smearing floor in order to  
purify it, will it also include dung of bull?  
  
Recently I came across the below quoted verse in a section from  
Mahabharata, wherein is indicates that it does include bull dung also.  
Please see below.  
  
However, I would also like to know the practice of "shistas" from  
different places in this regard, before implementing this. In this  
case, if you can also kindly tell me what "shista" in case of cooking  
fuel and also in homams (whether bull dung was used).  
  
Currently we use only cow-dung to be on the safer side.  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
