In sri shankarabhashyaon Gita, jnani and ajnaniis defined as one who thinks he is the doer is an ajnaniand one who thinks he is not the doer is a jnani.

  

Are there other definitions of these 2 terms in works of shankaracharya?

  

further in his own words what is the definition of "ishwara"? across a few granthas.
