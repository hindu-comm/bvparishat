The general theme of jnani and ajnani is what is stated above. Here is one from the Taittiriya Upanishad bhashya, a unique one:भयाभयहेतुत्वाद्विद्वदविदुषोरस्ति तद्ब्रह्म । For ajnani, Brahman is Bhaya hetu, that is, repeated birth and death and thus samsara is what he gets from Brahman (since Brahman is the jagat niyantaa, Ishwara, saguna Brahman.) For the Jnani, Brahman is abhaya hetu, that is, by knowing Brahman, he attains to the Fearless, there being no source of fear any longer for him.

In Advaita, the term 'Ishwara/Parameshwara' is used to mean either Nirguna or Saguna Brahman, contextually. For example in this Mandukya Upanishatmantra:एषसर्वेश्वरएष सर्वज्ञ एषोऽन्तर्याम्येष योनिः सर्वस्य प्रभवाप्ययौ हि भूतानाम् ॥ ६ ॥ It is saguna Brahman, endowed with the attributes of sarveshvaratva, sarvajnatva, antaryamitva, jagadyoni. All these are attributes accruing to Nirguna Brahman through the agency of Maya. And therefore are not absolutely real. Without these is Nirguna Brahman, also sometimes called Ishwara/Parameshwara. So, while reading the bhashyas one will have to carefully determine which Brahman is being meant there.
