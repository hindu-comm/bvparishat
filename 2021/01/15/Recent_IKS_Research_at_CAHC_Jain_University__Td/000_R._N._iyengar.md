***Akṣara the Basic Unit of Time Measure in Ancient India***  

IJHS \| VOL 55.3 \| SEPTEMBER 2020 (R. N. Iyengar, H. S. Sudarshan, Anand Viswanathan)  

Abstract  

In this paper after a brief review of ancient Indian time units, the ingenious method of Indian astronomers  
for calibrating the small time unit of *vighaṭikā* (24 seconds) phonetically by the recitation of a Sanskrit  
verse in the *līlākhelā* meter with sixty *gurvakṣara*s, is experimentally verified by sixty independent sample  
recitations. This is followed by exploring the concept of congruence of akṣara count and time periods such  
as the month and the year in Vedic texts. This leads to the symbolic equivalence of the *bṛhatī* meter of  
36 syllables to the Year and several other numerical synchronies between phenomenal time and *akṣara*.  
The 1000 *bṛhatī* verses of the *prātaranuvāka* nocturnal performance in the *atirātra* ritual is the traceable  
most ancient origin and inspiration for gauging and estimating the lapse of time by recognizing audible  
syllables as a time measure. To verify this, apart from text based theoretical estimates, real time information  
from a famous *śrauta* expert on his *prātaranuvāka* performance is presented. It is further demonstrated  
empirically that the rate of 3600 *gurvakṣara* per *ghaṭikā* of siddhānta astronomy is closely correlated with  
the speed of present day traditional chanting of the Ṛgveda, the fidelity of which has remained stable over  
millennia.
