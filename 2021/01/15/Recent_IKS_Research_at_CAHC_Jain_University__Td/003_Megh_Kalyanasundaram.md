Namaskaaram Prof. Iyengar,

  

What a start to 2021!

Thank you for sharing this fascinating paper (which I have only fully read once but one to which I foresee returning at least a few more times)!

In the first reading (itself), I found it to be highly informative (got introduced to, and learnt, much more than just a thing or two: thank you all!) and thought-provoking.

Do accept my congratulations. Many congratulations also to Sudarshan and Anand.

  

Sincerely,

Megh
