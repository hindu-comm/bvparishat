*Namaskar to everyone.*

*  
*

*I am teaching an overview of Sri Shankara bhashya on Gita in my class now. Some fundamental ideas are being discussed.*

*  
*

*One issue came up:*

*vAkhyArthajnAnAtmoksha: tatvam asi etc.*

*  
*

*in verse 2.21:*

*

When I looked into SacchidAnandendraSwami explanations footnote 3 below at the end of this page. it says: Sri Shankaracharya did not agree with the people who believed that once the maha vakyas are understood (vAkyArtha jnAna), they have to still do "dhyana" etc. Meaning: it is sufficient to understand the meanings of the mahAvAkyas.

  

see below. I am trying to find a clear analysis of what Advaita (Sri Shankaracharya and post Shankara teachers) says aboutthis topic of vAkyArtha jnAnAtmoksha.

  

The Clear view I have got from my teachers is: The heart of all the 3 major matha traya sthApaka acharyas were one . Their languages and methods differ
