Namaste



1.   Very rightly said. \< The Clear view I have got from my teachers
    is: The heart of all the 3 major matha traya sthApaka acharyas were
    one . Their languages and methods differ>. 



2.  The \< language difference> yields to instruction methods for
    meditation practice \< upaasanaa – uapdesha -bhinnataa\> by end
    goal posited through the siddhanta. When ‘Yoga’ part of
    ‘Yoga-Vedanta’ is disconnected, the outcome is ‘Vedanta as a
    cerebral exercise, lacking the practice-feet’. Mere practice without
    knowledge is ‘ blind walking with a lamp and without a cane’.



3.  Siddhanta referencing leads to ‘interpreted’ construction of
    ‘(veda)Vakya-( Darshana -Shruti- vakya)’ for Vyakhyaana/ Vaada-
    Jijnyasa.



4.  Siddhanta analytics leads to Jijnyasa – Meemaamsaa of \< tattva-
    artha – taatparya – uddesha - darshana\> for \<Sadhaka- upadesha\>.



5.  Samanvaya is for consolidation of thought. It is not necessarily for
    steam rolling a single point of view to the exclusion of other.



6.  The purpose of ‘Samanvaya’ ( harmonized critical construction) is
    for ‘Samucchaya’ ( Balanced Healthy growth and spiritual progress).





7.  *Example-1*: *vAkhyArthajnAnAtmoksha *-- Steps involved in
    ‘Vakyaarthajnana’ before yielding the end goal of ‘ Moksha’ \[ from
    What ? The ‘bounded nature, *saantataa*)



1.   ‘Vakya’ (= Mantra, Veda) is manifestation of ‘ Vak- Darshana’. 2.   ‘Vak-Darshana’ is a result of Vak-yoga -abhyasa/ siddhi’. 3.  ‘Vakya’ – used for upaasanaa’ is received through ‘upadesha’ and
    practiced through ‘yoga-sadhanaa’ . 4.  When the practice matures, ‘Vakya’ unveils its ‘ Vak-svaroopa’/
    Vak-atma’: See Rig- mantra: uta tvah pashyan, na dadarsha vacham,
    uta tvah shrunvan na shrunotyenam, uto tvasmai tanvam visasre,
    jaayeva patya ushatee suvaasaah’. Also see Bhartruhari :
    Shabda-brahmani nishnaatah, param-brahma adhigacchati; Vedah
    Shivah – Shivo Vedah. 5.  When ‘vakya’ through practice, yields to ‘Vak-darshana’, the purpose
    (Artha/ meaning/ modus operandi and serving as a means to moksha),
    the phase of ‘Vakyaartha’ will be over. 6.  Post ‘Vakyaartha’, the further transcendence ( yato vacho
    nivartante…. Seeking the Vak-moola), the saadhaka experientially
    realizes/ experiences ( = Jnaa- avabodhane) the moksha – the total
    freedom from the ‘ Naama-roopa-prakriyaa’ bandhana.



With this, ‘Vakyaartha-jnaana’ ends in ‘ moksha’, from where there is no return (ज्ञानिनो न निवर्तन्ते ). Because that is the transcendence of ‘Veda-Vak/ Veda-Vakya/ Mantra Vakya’ to its ‘ Sarva-Moola -sva-roopa’. This is the high claim of the final frontier of Veda. ( इति वेदांतडिंडिम ) .



8.  *Example-2*: *tatvam asi* – One more way to understand : Each
    acahrya picks one or more aspects by context.



1.  Tat -asi : That is ( existential reality and experienceable,
    expression amenable = sat, anubhava gochara,
    naama-roopa-vachaneeya) 2.  Tvam-asi : You are ( existential reality, self-experienceable,
    self-identified with a universal expression = sat, sva-samvedya
    -anubhava gochara, svaabhijna- asmat/ yushmat -pratyaya
    -sarva-naama-nirdeshya /bodhya )



3.  Tattvam -asi : You are the essential principle ( Knowledge
    experienceable, expression amenable = Jnanam, Prajnanam, Jnaatmaa)



4.  Tvam -tat -asi : You are that (existential essential identity, in
    duality, experienceable = sat, satyam, abhinnam, yuktah,
    sampruktah )



5.  Tat- tvam-asi: That is /was/ will be You. ( The real eternality and
    eternal connection of That to ‘This/ You / I’ – tasmat sarvagatam
    Brahma, Satyam, Jnanam, Anantam ).
