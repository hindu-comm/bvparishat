10 years ago I first wanted to know where this piece of the verse came from  

  

and you can read here:  

  

<https://prabhupadabooks.com/bg/1/14>  

  

*Jayas tu pāṇḍu-putrāṇāṁ yeṣāṁ pakṣe janārdanaḥ*  

*  
*

*The sounding of the transcendental conchshells indicated that there was no hope of victory for the other side because[Kṛṣṇa](https://prabhupadabooks.com/d/krsna)was on the side of the Pāṇḍavas.Jayas[tu](https://prabhupadabooks.com/d/tu)[pāṇḍu](https://prabhupadabooks.com/d/pandu)-[putrāṇāṁ](https://prabhupadabooks.com/d/putranam)[yeṣāṁ](https://prabhupadabooks.com/d/yesam)[pakṣe](https://prabhupadabooks.com/d/pakse)[janārdanaḥ](https://prabhupadabooks.com/d/janardanah).Victory is always with persons like the sons of[Pāṇḍu](https://prabhupadabooks.com/d/pandu)because Lord[Kṛṣṇa](https://prabhupadabooks.com/d/krsna)is associated with them.
