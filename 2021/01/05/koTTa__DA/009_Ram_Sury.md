Dravidian origins are theoretically possible although not plausible where an early attestation is not in evidence, but how does a word have ultimately origins in Prakrit if Prakrit, across the board - itself originates in Old-Indic (Sanskrit).

  

To that extent the definition seems circular and thus non-convincing.

  

Thanks,

Ramakrishnan Suryanarayanan.
