Koṭṭa

  

When I read more about the inscription in the Gwalior Chaturbhuj temple (thanks to the links provided by Ujjwal ji) I found that the word koṭṭapāla is used in the Sanskrit inscription (I am not differentiating dīrgha ō and hrasva o when transcribing Indo-Aryan words. Will differentiate only when transcribing words from Dravidian languages.)

  

I was under the impression that “kōṭṭa” meaning fort is a word belonging to the languages of the Dravidian family. Kōṭṭa (Malayalam), kōṭa (Telugu), kōṭe (Kannada) and kōṭṭai (Tamil) (കോട്ട కోట ಕೋಟೆ கோட்டை) all mean a fort. The change that the word undergoes across the four languages is as expected for native Dravidian words especially the double ṭṭ turning to single ṭ in Kannada and Telugu. This change normally does not happen for Sanskrit tatsama words.

  

Is Sanskrit koṭṭa borrowed from Prakrit or Dravidian languages? I haven’t seen any words in Sanskrit with a double retroflex ṭṭ after an o. If it is genuinely Sanskrit, does in occur in Vedic?
