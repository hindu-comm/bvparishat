Well, Ojas-ji,

It can happen to anybody.

Sometimes the auto-corrector rushes to "help" us,

and we will feel greatly "obliged" like this.

  

Sometimes we write hurriedly, and something unintended happens.

When I was in middle school, which was when I got introduced to English alphabets  

for the first time, I was fond of writing the names of my note books in English.

While writing my name followed by the name of the subject (Kannada),

I had written "K.S.Kannada" mixing up the two!

(Now I can interpret the same, saying, I had after all hit upon the *pratyāhāra* scheme  

\- unwittingly though!)
