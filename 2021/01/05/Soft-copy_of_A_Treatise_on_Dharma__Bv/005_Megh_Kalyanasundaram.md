For clarity and to clarify my request vide<https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/BveyKVm-S7g/m/z897j4SQBQAJ>

  

I am looking for a lead to purchase a soft-copy of the book Ojas had requested

(in maroon below) a soft-copy for {and of which I have a paperback}.

  

Mārcis's share (the one in yellowbelow) might be of use for those who don't have the book he has shared (in print or otherwise).
