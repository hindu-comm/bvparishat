Namaste,  

  

@Mārcis Gasūnsji - You have shared the book " Dharma - Studies in its Semantic, Cultural and Religious History", which is different from what I want but it seems useful for the work I have undertaken.  

  

@Megh Kalyanasundaramji - If I find the e-copy I will surely intimidate you. Till then let's see if anyone has the e-copy or not.  

  

Yours Sincerely,

Ojas Mainkar
