Pranaams to all,

  

I am writing to impress upon all of you the importance of this new launched PPP scheme.

  

Patreon and other such platforms have emerged as an important source of funding for several media/digital platforms making them almost selfsufficient.

  

We believe it is now time for individual IKS scholars to take advantage of this platform and build a community of global supporters for their research/teaching work.

  

We encourage scholars to open accounts and share with us their details and we will make the initialappeal on their behalf. Once you start receivingsupport from enthusiasts, we will match the contributions received up to a sum of Rs 5000 pm for a period of one year.

  

Looking forward to the success of the PPP scheme and seeing several scholars on Patreon.

  

Togetherlets ensure that no scholar is prevented from his or her work for want of resources.

  

Regards

  

Hari ...

Founder Indic Academy
