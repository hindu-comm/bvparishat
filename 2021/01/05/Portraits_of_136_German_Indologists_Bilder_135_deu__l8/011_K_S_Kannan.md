My allusion was, first, to collections of writings.

Evaluation follows, naturally.

Even though there can be a variety of opinions,

one can come to mark trends country-wise, more or less.

  

The stamp of envy shows itself in the writings of much of the West in respect of Indology.

At a time Western countries were yet in their infantile stage, of more or less mere mutual robbery,  

India was busy, as ever, in probing into some of the deepest issues of life, producing,

in Pollock's words "millions and millions of books" - unparalleled in history.

  

How can the West not be expected to besmirch them and undervalue them?

If you cannot rise to the other man's level,

do everything to pull him down and bulldoze.

  

As they say, if you cannot dazzle with brilliance,  

baffle them with bullshit.

  

Exceptions apart, how steady and consistent they have been in their mission!:

अशक्तो गृहनिर्माणे शक्तोऽहं गृहभञ्जने !
