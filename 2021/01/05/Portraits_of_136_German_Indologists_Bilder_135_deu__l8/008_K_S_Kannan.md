Dear Gasūns,

A *Russian Indologists* book would be a good collection.

  

Have you seen this book?:

  

Bongard-Levin G and Vigasin A 1984

*The Image of India* 272 pp.  

Moscow: progress publishers  

  

In fact, such countrywise collection of Indological contributions

should be welcome additions.
