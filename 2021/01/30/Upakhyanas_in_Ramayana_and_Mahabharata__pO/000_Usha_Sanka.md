Hariom

I was looking for an exhaustive list of all Upakhyanas inRamayana and Mahabharata.

Is there any exhaustive list of them in any place on net or in personal collectionsof scholars here?

(If this has been discussed before, please let me have the link)

What I tried already is put here.

1. There is a list of all contents of Mahabharata in the Sanskrit Documents  

(TOC) Table of Contents for Mahabharata -<https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_z_misc_major_works/mahalist.html>

I tried to pick the ones with "Upakhyana" word, but it seems that others with some other names sometimes might be an Upakhyana. Eg.Samvada..? I don't feel somehow that this is an exhaustive list.

But no luck yet for Ramayana.

2\. I tried the Geeta Press index for Mahabharata, but it hasanuparvas in bold, not Upakhyanas. TheTOC is too detailed to spot exact Upakhyanas.

3\. <http://www.mahabharata-resources.org/> - I checked here as well.  

4\. Nilanathiya Vyakhya has a good index in first two sargas with some clarity- but it is not followed in later parvas  

  

Am I missing any technique to spot the exact Upakhyanas? Are there any clues or pointers to spot them without missing them? Did any edition give them?

If nothing is available ready-made, I thought let me make one and share.  

Please guide.

Thanks to everyone in advance. :)
