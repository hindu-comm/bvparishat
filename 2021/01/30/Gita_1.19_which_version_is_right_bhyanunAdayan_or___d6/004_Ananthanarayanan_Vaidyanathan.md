this slokam is not a really material one in the text of Gita.. It is not commented by Shankara.. The description of the preliminaries to the war does not really add much to the substance of Gita in any way. A detailed analysis about vya or bhya on this rather relatively insignificant couplet . is it worth discussion at all ?
