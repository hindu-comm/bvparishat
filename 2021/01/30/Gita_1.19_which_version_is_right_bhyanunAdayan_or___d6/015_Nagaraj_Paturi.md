Critical Edition and Southern Recension separately.

  

It has the statement :

  

In 1998, we made the e-text of the sanskrit epic Mahabharata (Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute BORI Critical Edition typed by Prof. Tokunaga) available for the first time on the world wide web in devanagari script. The files were converted using ITRANS and the web pages were in xdvng font .  

  

In 2013, the site has been updated to include both the critical edition and the southern recension of Mahabharata in unicode devanagari (utf-8 encoding) along with the ITRANS versions.

Please see the linked pages for the e-text, source and processing details of the[BORI Critical Edition](https://sanskritdocuments.org/mirrors/mahabharata/mahabharata-bori.html)and[Southern Recension Kumbhaghonam Edition](https://sanskritdocuments.org/mirrors/mahabharata/mahabharata-sarit.html)of the Mahabharara. You need to enable javascript for the accordion menu navigation to work. Since the files are large, we recommend that you download the files to your computer and access them locally.

If you would like the files in another regional script please write to[sans...@cheerful.com]().
