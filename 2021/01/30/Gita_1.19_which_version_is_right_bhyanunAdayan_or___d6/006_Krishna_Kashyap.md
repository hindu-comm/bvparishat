This is not for the purpose of whetheracharyas have commented on this verse or not.

while reciting how one should recite based on correct grammaticalusage of the terms vyanunadayan and bhyanunadayan?. that's all.

  

We are conducting a chanting class on Gita and people want to know how to chant properly.
