if you try to go with etymology and give some leverage to grammatic usage etc , both the versions may fit in reasonably well.. Many such variants can be seen in texts which come to us over many thousands of years.. If some local recension follow bha instead of va, it should be okay. In fact many va karams elsewhere in India go by bhakaram or bakaram in the eastern provinces like Bengal, Orissa etc.. Vishnu elsewhere become Bishnu, Bishnoy etc in the eastern states..
