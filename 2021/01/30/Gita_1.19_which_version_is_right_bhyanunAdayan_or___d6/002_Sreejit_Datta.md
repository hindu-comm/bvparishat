Namaste,

  

Prefixing of upasarga vi- to anunAdyan has a clear meaning, whereas there is no such upasarga as bhi-. I've never come across an edition that gives "bhyanunAdayan" so far (I have 6-7 different editions in my personal collection).

  

Could you please indicate which edition(s) gives bhi- ? 

  

Warm regards,
