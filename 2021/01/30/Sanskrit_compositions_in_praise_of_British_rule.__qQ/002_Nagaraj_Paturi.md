I am aware of such eulogies of the British written in Telugu by poets such as Kandukuri Vireshalingam Pantulu and Gurajada Appa Rao.

  

Kandukuri Vireshalingam Pantulu was a Bramho, a leader of BramhoSamaj,
a reformationist.  

  

Gurajada Appa Rao was for modernity and believed that all the British were modern, rational and scientific. He was a sympathizer of the reformation movement, though he was critical of its pro-Hindu traits and some other aspects that from his view were not enough modern.

  

 Both were against the national / independence movement and were intensely fascinated by the British and their rule and were totally were the continuance of the British rule.

  

Both wrote poetry eulogizing King George, Queen Victoria etc.
