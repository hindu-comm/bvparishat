The point in this thread is related to the point in the other thread on Dr Audrey Truschke and he thesis on Sanskrit during Mughals.

  

During the Mughal rule too, there were some Sanskrit scholarswho did not mind writing eulogies to the Mughals.

  

Dr Truschke uses such instances to make sweeping generalizations and create a thesis that

# "Hindu religion or culture was never under attack during Muslim rule in India: Book"

Just as these eulogies of the British lived beside a huge swell against the British rule , the Sanskrit poets who wrote in favour of the Mughals lived beside the anti-Mughal activities, battles and writings.
