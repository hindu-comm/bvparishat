Thanks Prof. Iyengar, for sharing these pagesrelated to an interesting and important Sanskrit Kavya of the colonial/ modern times.

  

1\. Prof. Sheldon Piollockdoes not seem to be knowing such works as he theorizes that Sanskrit ceased to respond to living thought by the time of the British rule. He says, "Sanskrit literature could hardly be said to be alive if it had ceased to functionas the vehicle for living thought, thought that supplemented and not simply duplicatedreality. " He particularly points out the genre of Kaavya and says, " If ka¯vya was important to the imaginative life of society and even the self-understanding of polity, as it demonstrably was, then its history must tell us something important about the life of the larger cultural formation it indexed." But this Kaavya as is found from the accounts in the 'select' 'opinions' in the shared pdf seems to have responded to and incorporated the contemporary spirit of 'history', history of a foreign country , England , a spirit of empathy for the perspectives of that foreign country, a new perspective of his own country informed by that perspective borrowed from the ruler / coloniser society etc. Though people like me can at no cost agree with the submission to the colonizing foreign ruler as 'our most beloved queen -empress " by most of the Indian Pandits giving opinions in the portion shared here , a dispassionate assessment of the book reveals, as documented by quite a few opinion givers, a response to, articulation of and incorporation of a new thought coming from the colonizers and their rule, disproving Prof. Pollock's thesis.

  

2\. Such Sanskrit works and the expressions from such a big number of Sanskrit scholars will certainly be used by some future Audrey Truschke focusing on the British rule like she focuses on the Mughal rule, that there was no independence movement, Indians did not fight against the British rule, the British did not cause any harm to India, its culture etc., because the Sanskrit books of this kind praised the British rulers, their rule and the benefits to India from its rule, it is only the Hindutva elements that are baselessly talking about independence movement, Indian fight against the British rule, the British caused
harm to India, its culture etc.
