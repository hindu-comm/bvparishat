Regarding Truschke'sbook, there is a review of the book in LiveMint by Arshia Sattar (Truschke and Sattar are both graduates of the University of Chicago).

  

I would be happy to publish in India Facts a careful rebuttal of Sattar's review:

I find that our scholars are rather shy or diffident about taking on such issues, whereas scholars from the "other side" are happy to pummel us. Why this diffidence? Do we not have facts/evidence to rebut these claims or do we not want to be seen as or considered a "Hindutvavadi" for challenging these kinds of theses and these kinds of reviews?
