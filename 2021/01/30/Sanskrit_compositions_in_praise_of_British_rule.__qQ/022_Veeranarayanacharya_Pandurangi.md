We can not forget Balakrishna Mishra a great naiyayika of kashi, blessed British, upon honored with the title of mahamahopadhyaya in 1930's.

There is also Madhusudan ojha who went to England with Ramsingh and praised English king. He said that king of jaipur, hailing from suryavansha has come to greet or pay respect to a king where sun never sets down.

I think it is because of such blessings by learned Brahmanas, raj survived long here.

But thale fact is Samskrit pandits will praise anybody who patrons them, or even without such patronage. Whom else Nehru and Indira patronized? But they were praised by our people, because they had no other work.

I wonder why nobody is writing Sonia vijaya or Rahula champu or even Narendra Modi sahasram. We are fools.
