Adibhatla Narayana Dasu'spatron, the Maharaja of Vizianagaram was loyal to the Nizam and the British.

  

Gurajada Appa Rao (1862-1915) that I was mentioning as a eulogiser and uncritical admirer of the British as scientific and progressive people and rulers was a contemporary of Ajjada Adibhatla Narayana Dasu (1864 -1945).

  

This 'progressive' writer in the prefatorypart of his reformationist humorous play Kanyasulkamusigns as the one who is the most loyal to the king of Vizianagaram who is loyal to the Nizam of Hyderabad prefixing both the names of his king and the Nizam with all the 'royal' titles.

  

In his lyrical poem "Mutyala Saralu", he praises the British as those who can see the reality of things that is not visible to the eyes, probably to indicate their 'scientific' knowledge. In his short story Devullara Mee Peremiti he has British characters who remove the Hindu religious misunderstandings of sculpturesthrough scientific historical understanding and correct an idol-stealing Hindu character because of his ethical nature.
