Ajjada Adibhatla Narayanadasu, known as हरिकथापितामहः, composeda vyakarana sastra kavyam namely'Tarakam' in five cantos in 1910 A.D. In 4th and 5th cantos, the poet praises British rule. Sanskrit Academy published it with English translation.I am going to deliver a talk on this composition on 2nd February 2021 on the occasion of 76th death anniversary of the scholar.
