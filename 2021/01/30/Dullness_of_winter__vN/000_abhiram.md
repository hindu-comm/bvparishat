मन्दारुणार्कः किरणैः सुमन्दैर्

मां प्रातरुत्थापयतीषदीषत् ।

मन्दाश्च तापे शिशिरर्तुघस्राः

सर्वं सुमन्दं धिषणापि मन्दा ॥

"The dull rising sun with his dull rays wakes me up very slowly, little by little, in the morning. The winter days are very low in warmth too. Everything is really slow and dull, hence my intelligence is also dull. (Or everything is dull because my intelligence is dull)."
