This is just to thank the creators / maintainers of Advaita Sharada.

It is a good research tool.

  

I was trying to find: how Sri Shankaracharya uses the term "jnani" in the prasthana traya bhashyas. (ie. that context and intended meanings).

  

Thanksto Sri V. Subramanian ji, I was able to findexcellent answers to my query.
