A grammarian and his wife

  

वैयाकरणवरो मे वरोऽनिशं भाषते वच: किञ्चित् ।

खफछठथेति न जाने हयवरवद् भाषणं तस्य ।।

  

A lady says: “My husband is a great grammarian and he always keeps on saying “kha pha cha ṭha tha.” I don’t understand his speech which is like that of a great horse.”

  

\[Pāṇini’s grammar begins with the (Śivasūtras) sound lists like “hayavaraṭ and khaphachaṭhacaṭatav”\].
