Namaste





This question seems to have eternally the Samskruth enthusiasts and grammarians. The emergent wisdom and practice seems to have accepted a ground reality :



1.  Practical Speakers do what they consider as ‘ Easiest first’ (
    **प्रथमं सुलभं कुर्यात्**) ; ‘ Import any word as ‘ samjnaa’ by
    ‘ saamya’. Similarity of form is used to ‘accommodate .

And if that fails, ‘ Find a complicated rule operation modality for
justification using obscure grammar rules and usages’ to defend. **(व्याकरणसूत्रेषु विपुलावकाशाः सन्ति छ्लेन साधयितुं - यं कमपि रूपं,
यं कमपि अर्थं निर्देष्टुं )**



2.  Perfectionist grammar defenders ( **शास्त्र-पाश-बद्धाः
    पाणिनीयाः) **hold on to the forte that it does not matter how
    complicated- complex pre-processing has been made on the ‘ as -given
    ‘prakruti’, the grammar rules operate perfectly and out put unique
    form ( **प्रकृति-शब्द-क्षेत्रे विवदन्ति ।) **It may not be easy to
    generate and use the generated form ! But it does exist and is
    doable. Grammarians blame the ‘ ignorance and laziness ( **( त्वरित-
    वक्तृत्व-कामना, सुकुमारता **) of learners. ****

****

So the choice rests between the above two extremes of ‘ Simple Practicality’ and ‘Extreme Perfectionism’, that helps to communicate the ‘ vivakshitaartha through vakya-prayoga’.
