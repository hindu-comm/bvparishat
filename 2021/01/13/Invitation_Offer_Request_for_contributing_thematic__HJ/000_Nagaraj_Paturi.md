**Focus & Frame**:The concept of Indian Urban Landscape refers to a complex cultural mosaic and network of spatiality of time, temporality of space, sacrality of nature and overall, the encompassing manifestation of transcendence of human-actions that since time immemorial is making a strong bridge between conscious mind and superconscious Nature.This way the interplay has been part of constant and continuous evolutionary drama between earthly Human being and cosmic Nature—resultantly turning into various built-structures, heritage sites and three typological frames (‘tangible-intangible-transitory’) that maintained frame of “succession-sustenance-sustainability”*vis-à-vis*
“continuity-maintenance-transformation”; of course, always keeping the essence of the past that processed and get transferred from one generation to another – represented in the best form in urban cultural landscapes and heritage sites. This anthology is an attempt on the line of critical appraisal of structural history of**I**ndian**U**rban**C**ultural**L**andscape, and its selected manifested representations at different levels, divided into FOUR SECTIONS:(**i**)**National/ symbolic/ cosmic**/archetypal/ textual-epical/literary/mythmaking,(**ii**)**Regional/ cultural**or linguistic regions and their characteristics,(**iii**)**Locality and interlinkages**– locality vs universality, and(**iv**)**Case studies of IUCLs**, characteristics, and SDGs for future. This book will bethe representative and first of its kind projecting the IKS:**I**ndian**K**nowledge**S**ystem, and Cultural Urban Heritage landscapes of India.**Focused Abstract/s are cordially invited on any of the 04 Sections (only in Standard British English)**.

IGU Commission C16.25 “Landscape Analysis and Landscape Planning”, and C16.7 “Cultural Approach in Geography”, supported the ACLA (Asian Cultural Landscape Association), to organise this project, with collaboration of the members of ICOMOS-India;****from where derived most of the papers.
