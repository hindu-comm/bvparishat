**Abstract:**  
Digital Heritage is bridging culture/heritage with technology.  

  

Tangible cultural heritage components - like monuments, temples, a group of buildings where these are 2D documented, studied & analysed, and the missing parts of the buildings - are reconstructed and brought back virtually to the physical world via 3D modelling , 3D reconstructions, and walkthroughs. There can also be augmented reality-based presentations of the recreated models with color and texture of the surfaces of intangible cultural heritage components like festivals, rituals, bazaar activities and social life.  

  

This involves not only capturing the data on the digital media but also preservation of the knowledge and processes involved in it. The digital representation of the intangible heritage provides a unique opportunity to present the heritage in appropriately contextual fashion through 3D models walkthroughs in virtual, spatial and intellectual spaces.

  
This will be an attempt to bring back the glory of the Vijayanagara empire to the present day.
