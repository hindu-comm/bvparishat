Also I dont get this.. What's the issue with considering Buddha as an avatara of Vishnu? Are we being accused of making Buddha a part of Sanatana dharma? Then I may say that it is not an accusation, but a fact... Buddha did belong to Sanatana dharma... Else what other dharma existed in this part of the world before Buddha??
