Dear All,

In response to the Viṣṇupurāṇa passage (set to music),

an enlightened reader has responded in the words that follow.

Any response for this?

  

Regards

KSKannan  

  

Bhārata should be handed over to the Jains as the name comes from Bharata, son of the 1^(st) Tirthankara, Rishibha. The appropriation of Bharata as Bhārata has been an imperious act, as also with Ashoka, and Buddha as one of the avatāras of Viṣṇu. Now it is painted in saffron, not even the original ochre, colour of sannyasa; notice how the white in the national flag is missing in the saffron flags that are flying all over the place, even on Republic Day.



By contrast, the Aboriginal people in Australia refuge to recognise the same 26^(th) January as Australia Day, for the simple reason that it was the dasyus and Dravidic nigandhas from south India who discovered the continent later came to be known as terra australis (then in 1901 as Australia), and not by Captain Book or Bligh or Sir Phillip, Darwin et al; and they were a republic many times over in their 60,000 years on this land, which today’s Australia is not. So the day Emperor Ashoka was enthroned should be celebrated as Republic Day in India, not some date linked with the British Empire and its erasure. India had many republics and was a republic many times over; all we have today on this national holiday is a public display of lethal nuclear arsenals/rockets which will never deter India’s nuclear neighbours : mere phataakas/fire-crackers in their eyes…..
