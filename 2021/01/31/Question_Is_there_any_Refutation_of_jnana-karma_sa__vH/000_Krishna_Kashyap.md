Namaskara to everyone,

  

I have a question. I am working on understanding in depth the refutation of jnana karma samucchayavadaby Sri Shankaracharya.

  

Is there any refutation of jnana karma samucchayavadaby pre-shankara advaitins or by prior Buddhists (of any kind mahayana or whatever type)?

  

Did Buddhists (of any kind) believe that jnana is superior and karma is inferior?. If so I would like to get some details of who held that view? vijnana vadins? and some references.

  

*Best Regards,*
