Namaskara,

  

I am a beginner, with very little knowledge of yoga-vasistha.

I was reading an intro given by : Vasudeva Laxmana Sharma Pansikarin his book

### [ The Yogavasistha of Valmiki with commentary](https://www.wisdomlib.org/shop/books/hinduism/the-yogavasistha-of-valmiki-with-commentary)

author: Vasudeva Laxmana Sharma Pansikar  
edition: 2008, Motilal Banarsidass Publishers  
pages: 1610  
ISBN-13: 9788120831476  
Topic:[Hinduism](https://www.wisdomlib.org/shop/books/hinduism)

  

I thought of sharing this information regarding Yogavasistha:

  

****The popular belief that the[Advaita](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/advaita#hinduism "show Advaita definitions")in[Yoga-Vasistha](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/yoga-vasishtha#hinduism "show Yoga-Vasistha definitions")and in[Sankara](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/shankara#purana "show Sankara definitions")is the same is not correct.**** Sankara does not admit the extreme idealism of Buddhist Vijnanavada, while[Yoga](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/yoga#purana "show Yoga definitions")-[Vasistha](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/vasishtha#purana "show Vasistha definitions")advocates it and denies the reality, nay the very existence of the phenomenal world, Sankara regards the relation between[Brahman](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/brahman#purana "show Brahman definitions")and[Maya](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/maya#purana "show Maya definitions")as indescribable (anirvacaniya), while Yoga-Vasistha holds that the manifold appearances come into being due to Spanda and Brahman and Spanda are more really and directly connected (an obvious influence of[Trika](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/trika#purana "show Trika definitions")[Saivism](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/shaivism#hinduism "show Saivism definitions")). Sankara insists on[Nivrtti](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/nivritti#purana "show Nivrtti definitions")and[Sannyasa](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/samnyasa#purana "show Sannyasa definitions"), while Yoga-Vasistha emphasizes synthesis of[jnana](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/jnana#purana "show jnana definitions")and[karma](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/karma#purana "show karma definitions")(jnana-karma-[samuccaya](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/samuccaya#hinduism "show samuccaya definitions")) and[Vrtti](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/vritti#purana "show Vrtti definitions")-sannyasa. of the 80 Type.

As these are differences of a fundamental nature, the philosophical concepts of Yoga-Vasistha should be understood in their proper context.
