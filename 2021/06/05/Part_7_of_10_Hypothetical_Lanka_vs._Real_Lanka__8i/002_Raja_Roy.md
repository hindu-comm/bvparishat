Dear Mr. Agarwal,

You have entirely missed the points I am raising in my refutation of Oak's dating of Ramayana to 12209 BCE. This has nothing to do with Vedic Science or belief in God. This is about Research Ethics and Research Integrity. Here is what I wrote in anearlier email to which Oak has not responded.

Mr. Oak,

Instead of bombarding the readers with your videos, please provide following information:

1. You claim that seasons and months were off by 2 months from standard configuration during Mahabharata times. Provide a single direct evidence of this assertion. Direct evidence means that seasons and months must be specified by name.

2.You claim that seasons and months were off by 6 months from standard configuration during Ramayan times. Provide a single direct evidence of this assertion. Direct evidence means that seasons and months must be specified by name.

3. You claim more than 225+ corroborations of seasons from Ramayana (The Historic Rama, page 229). The table on this page has only 15 rows. Row 1 says Bala 22.22-33. Is that 12 corroborations in your count? Row 6 says Kishkindha 1.1-10. Is that 10 corroborations in your count?Row 9 says Kishkindha 30.1-63. Is that 63 corroborations in your count? Even counting all rows, the data does not sum up to 225+. Where is the rest of the data? Since you proclaim these corroborations all the time, research transparency demands that this data be made public. So kindly tell me where researchers can find this data so that your claim can be scrutinized.



Regards,

Dr. Raja Roy

I had continued in another email:

"Do you see the magnitude of the problem? Oak does not have a singledirectproof of his hypothesis of decoupling of months and seasons from either Ramayana or Mahabharata. Still, he claims hundreds of corroborationsand he has not made this data public for scrutiny. All his work on Ramayana and Mahabharata rests on bogus unverified assertions.?"

  

**This is the problem.**

  

Best regards,

Raja
