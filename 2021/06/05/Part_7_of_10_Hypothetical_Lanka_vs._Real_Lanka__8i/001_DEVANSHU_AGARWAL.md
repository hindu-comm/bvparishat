Respected sir,  
I read your article above and I came to the conclusion that you are 100% using the mindset provided by the "Macaulay system of education". I think Nilesh Oak sir has said that he is putting those facts only which are written in Valmiki Ramayan. And this evidence of current Lanka connected to India is always been supporting evidence for that date which comes out from Valmiki Ramayan.  
I think you do not understand Valmiki Ramayan at all. Only if you believe in "Bhagwan" or to say in the modern concept "more advance civilization" than what we are today. Then you have read that Lanka is City made by Vishwamitr and one more building made by Vishwamitr is"Agastya Rishi’s hermitage" and that is 1 yojan by 10 yojans high mountain-like structure. for today one can say we could have the technology to build such a huge building more than 10 times the size of Kingdom Tower. But as you are trying to say "we don't have that technology today to build a city 10 yojan by 10 yojans in the ocean and so older civilizations also do not have that technology" is utterly foolish to think.

  

you have 2 options either go with Vedic science and admit we have lost our knowledge or go with Western Science and be arrogant which can be seen as the only truth.

  

Best Regards,  
Devanshu
