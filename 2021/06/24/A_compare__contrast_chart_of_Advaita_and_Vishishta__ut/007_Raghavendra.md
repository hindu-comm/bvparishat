Āchārya Madhva has given the following definition of the technical term "śāstram" in his braḥmasūtra-bhāshya based on the evidence of skānda vachana,  


"R^igyajuHsAmAtharvAshcha bhArataM paNcharAtrakam.h \|

mUlarAmAyaNaM chaiva ***shAstramityabhidhIyate*** \|\|

***yachchAnukUlametasya tachcha shAstraM prakIrtitam***.h \|

ato.anyo granthavistAro naiva shAstraM kuvartma tat.h \|\|"



**shAstraM yoniH pramANAsyeti shAstrayoni** \|\|  
  
Āchārya Madhva has the above definitionin mind even while interpretingशास्त्रविधिमुत्सृज्य****in the context of the Gītā. उत्सृज्य according to Āchārya Madhva means not giving up the Vedas because they are invalid which the phrase शास्त्रविधिमुत्सृज्य****superficially appears to lend such a meaning, but it means, according to him, disowning the Vedas by eligible ones despite having the capacity to learn and assimilate them **(****सानूनबुद्धीन्).**

  
Āchārya Madhva is consistent across his writings with the above meaning of the technical term śāstram.  
  
Hope this information helps,  
  
Thank you and best regards,
