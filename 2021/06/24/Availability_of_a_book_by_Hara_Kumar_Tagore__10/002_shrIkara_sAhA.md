I cannot find a reference except in this article on him<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hara_Kumar_Tagore>  
  
\>Further, the noted texts -*Haratattva-didhiti*(1881),*Purashcharana-bodhini*(1895) and*Shila-chakrarthabodhini*were composed by him. The last text deals with various types of stones, which are worshiped as symbol of[Narayana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narayana "Narayana")  
  
shilA-chakrArtha-bodhinI is widely famous and available even today,it is the second work,purashcharaNa-bodhinII am asking about.
