Sahishnu-ji

  

Interesting catch, Is this the only place you have noticed some extra Rk-s? They are reciting the khila 13 along with the actual sUktam. Please see[Die Apokryphen des Ṛgveda: (Khilāni) : Scheftelowitz, Isidor (1875-1934) : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/apokryphen-des-rgveda/page/129/mode/2up)(page 130).Most of it is the same as in Apastamba mantra prashna 1-13. 10.184 itself is the beginning of mantra-prashna 1-13.

  

Since this is part of the marriage mantras (for the Apastambins at any rate and likely for Rgvedins as well), perhaps they learn the extra mantra-s along with the actual sUktamssince they don't have it nicely collected like the Apastambins. I don't know.

  

The way of reciting regular (i.e., not dIrgha) svarita-s is different between the two traditions Tamil vs Sringeri). The Gokharna tradition is also essentially the same as the Tamil method. There are also other variations even within the Karnataka sampradaya-s. I am writing a paper on this topic. I'll share it with you when I'm done.
