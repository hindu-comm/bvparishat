My pranam to all,

  

Please could someone help me identify which recension of the RV this recitation is?

  

<https://archive.org/details/RigVedaSamhita/Rig+Veda+Samhita/>  

  

It's the final samjnana-sukta that confuses me. It's not the Sakala recension, nor is it the Asvalayana. Is it the Baskala recension?

  

Svastih,

  

Sahishnu
