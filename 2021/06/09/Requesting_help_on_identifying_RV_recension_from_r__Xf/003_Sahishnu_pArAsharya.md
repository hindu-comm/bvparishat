Thank you, Ramakrishnan-ji, for this clarification.

  

Please could you tell me a bit more about this Kannada Sringeri style, and why does it differ? Is it just the parampara there? For instance, the RV 10.184 at 34:42 ("visnuryonim kalpayatu..") sukta also has extra verses. I consulted the Asvalayana text published by the IGNCA (ed. B. B. Choubey, 2009) and I found the full text there. Did you mean to say that the Sringeri tradition's reception of the Sakala-samhita has traditionally included those verses as well?

  

Pranam,

Sahishnu
