Looks like they are chanting the rAtri-sUktam khila bhAga along with the actual sUktam as well. See mp3 #64 \~13:00 for sUktam 10.127 followed by the khila at[Die Apokryphen des Ṛgveda: (Khilāni) : Scheftelowitz, Isidor (1875-1934) : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/apokryphen-des-rgveda/page/109/mode/2up)(A ratri - page 110). So it looks like they may be chatingrelevant khila portions along with the sUktams form a dataset of size 2 :-).
