Thank you, Ramakrishnan-ji, your answers have helped me a lot. :)

  

As for the extra Rk-s, I'm downloading the full set, with the intention of studying it (while listening to it). So I'll keep my eyes out if there are any differences, although I can only recognize the text itself. The subtle difference between the siksa-styles, I won't be able to detect because of a lack of adequate training. So, I look eagerly forward to your paper. It sounds very interesting and I hope to learn more!

  

Thank you again and my pranam to you!

Sahishnu

  

P. S. Whoever uploaded this recitation mp3 files should have specified who were reciting and where it was recorded. They neglected to preserve that information.
