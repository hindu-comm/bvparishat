· Where Itihāsa research differs from Science research

· Methodology for dating.

· Primary evidence for the date of Mahābhārata

· Importance of inscriptions as primary evidence for dating

· Are there secondary sources of evidence to Mahābhārata?

· Is the Epoch of Arundhati a source of evidence?

· Status of Dvaraka submergence, a primary or secondary evidence?

· Other evidence.

· Methods of dating research

· A note on Pancāṅga elements

· Compilation of the data

· Verification of the data and the date through simulators.

Looking forward to your valuable feedback.
