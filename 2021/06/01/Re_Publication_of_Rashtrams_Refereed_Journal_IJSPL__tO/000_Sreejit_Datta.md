Namaskar,

  

**Link to the current issue:**[Home - IJSPL (rashtram.org)](https://journal.rashtram.org/)

  

Hope this email finds you well. It gives me great pleasure in announcing that Vol I, Issue 2 of Rashtram's biannual refereed journal IJSPL has now been published. It features reviews and papers on both purely theoretical and praxis-based approaches to leadership, as well as topics concerning larger issues of assimilating different knowledge systems, free speech/FoE, educational administration, and civilisation.

  

We believe in the principle of open access for the widest possible proliferation of the latest research and production of knowledge. I humbly request you to make good use of the material available here - please feel free to cite them in your own research and recommend the journal to your colleagues, students, and friends. Very soon the Call for Papers for Vol II, Issue 1 (the upcoming November issue) will be released on the journal website and shared with you.

  

Thanks and regards,
