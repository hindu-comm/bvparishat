Reading through the lives of Jain monks of recent times, I have been struck by the intellectual achievements many of them registered subsequent to their initiation and after long periods of restrained behaviour, even though they did not come from a highly educated family, did not belong to the Brāhmana varna or evince a particular attachment to pursuit of knowledge in pre-initiation days. I admit I cannot prove it to everyone's satisfaction, but I do suspect a correlation between their paṇḍitic perforinance and their acceptance of a mode of living that at least partially resembles the one recommended for a Brahmin paṇḍit.
