(b) One day my teacher Professor S.D. Joshi was telling me about his teachers. When he came to mentioning Shankarshastri Marulkar, he suddenly choked up with tears. For several minutes he could not speak. The reason was that he suddenly remembered Marulkar's last days and could not control his grief. Through Vasudevshastri Abhyankar, Ramshastri Godbole, Bhaskarshastri Abhyankar, Nilakanthashastri Thatte and Vaidyanath Paygunde, paṇḍit Marulkar belonged to the vidyāvamsa of the great Nägeśabhatta (cf. Abhyankar 1954:101, 1960:Preface pp. 6-7). He was versatile to the extent of being entrusted with the responsibility of editing several texts for the Anandāśrama Sanskrit Series. He was a dedicated and skilled teacher. Yet during the last few years of his life he had nothing but two small pots left in his possession, which he used to cook rice and dal. What occurred to Joshi as he thought of Marulkar was that one day even these pots were stolen and Marulkar had no means left even to prepare his food.

 - In Varanasi, I have heard the story of a paṇḍit who was so frustrated with the devaluation his great learning had suffered that on his death bed he told his wife to make his funeral pyre out of the manuscripts he had inherited and collected. It is probable that this disturbing directive was at least partially carried out as it expressed one of his last wishes.  

 - Stories according to which manuscripts are offered to Gangā on the death anniversaries of scholars may also owe their origin, in part, to such feeling of rejection felt by the paṇḍits.
