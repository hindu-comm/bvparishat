My teacher Mr. N.N. Bhide was fond of telling the story of Bhaṭṭajī-sastrī Ghāṭe (also spelled "Bhatji Shastri Ghate"), a paṇḍit in Nagpur (who, I guess, lived in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries). Ghāṭe's area of expertise was Papinian grammar. If someone asked him a question relating to grammar, Ghāṭe would almost always simply point to the books and handwritten copies stacked on wooden planks fixed to the walls of his agnihotra area and advise the inquirer to take down a particular volume and look up a particular part or page for the answer he (the inquirer) was sceking. He would not feel the need to consult the volumes before formulating his answer. If questions pertaining to śāstras other than grammar were put to him, Ghāṭe would most of the time modestly say, "I know only grammar." Yet, when he was cajoled into writing a commentary on Bhavabhūti's Uttararāmacarita, he wrote it without opening any book and by citing several authorities outside the grammatical literature. Ghāṭe's commentary Bhāvabhūtārtha-bodhikā has been published as a commentary by Jayakr̥ṣṇa (probably Ghāṭe's personal name), together with an English translation of the Uttararămacarita, notes and introduction by Vinayak Sadashiv Patvardhan. The Catalogue of the India Office Library, vol. II, part I (revised edition, 1957), p. 2831, lists the second edition under the call number 21.D.19 as published by the Induprakāśa Press of Bombay in 1909.
