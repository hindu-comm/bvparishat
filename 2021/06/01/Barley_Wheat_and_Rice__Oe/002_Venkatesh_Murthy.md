Namaste  

  

In the North they still use barley with black Til or Sesame in Sraddha ceremonies. In the South it is always rice and black Til. But the Pinda offering to the Pitrus is made with rice balls in the North and South also. This is for Brahmins. For Kshatriyas and others I have seen in the North they use wheat flour balls for Kshatriyas and others in Gaya and other places.

  

Barley is becoming popular nowadays in the Southern cities also and it is easily available. Once I tried to use barley at home for Sraddha but the Purohit said it is not our custom and he used rice only. The Sraddha books all clearly say 'Yava'' but in the South they always use rice.
