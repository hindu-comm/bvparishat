Dear Radhakrishna Ji,

  

  There are numerous articles relating to this subject by the archaeo-botanist Dr. Dorian Fuller considering archaeobotanical findings and their possible connections to migrations and historical linguistics. Some of these articles may be available on Google search. If you don't find anything, I can forward a few to you. With bestregards,
