Dear Radhakrishnaji,

  

I offer my pranam to you and to those who have offered the answers above. I would like to add some details here.

  

Your question gave me occasion to re-consult my library, specifically the grhyasutras (sabhasya) and the Nirnayasindhu, and collate them with my own experience in paurohitya. It seems that the implication was to use the same substance for both offering to the devas and the pitrs, i.e. the material used to make the purodasa. That is also supposed to be used for making the pindas. The principle being that one must offer whatever one eats: one *shares* one's food with the gods and the ancestors. As for the til and barley, those references (I double-checked this) are for the grains that are to be sprinkled and mixed. Barley flour is *not* what is meant here, even though in modern times (as Venkateshji said) ground barley is used.

  

In the late Vedic period (grhyasutras), there is even mention of mamsacaru in the context of offering pindas to the pitrs. But it is to be noted that all medieval commentators disavow, disapprove of, or ignore this vikalpa (probably because of the prevalent sociocultural ethos of medieval India). But again, notably, the Kauthumi Samavedins of Bengal still religiously insist on the mamsapinda during their ekoddista sraddhas (they use a roasted piece of fish). The Yajurvedins of Bengal (like us) tend to frown on it a bit (also because it smells horrible!).

  

For the parvana, ekoddista, and sapindikarana sraddhas, the pinda is to be mixed with tila. For the nandisraddha (as a happy occasion), yava (grains!) is substituted. As far as I know in practice, boiled rice is mixed with barley grains, bananas, fruits, dadhi, madhu, etc for the nandisraddha. But I should also note that in Bengal atleast, this practice is almost extinct. The older generation of purohits (my granduncle) told me that while they study the ritual prayoga, they can't remember the last time they performed it. Most yajamanas just want a shortcut version - so most just do the sankalpika version and offer raw rice-grains as brahman-bhojya. I performed an upanayana in 2019 and there too, my yajamana was unwilling to do the pindadana for the nandisraddha. There appears to be a cultural fear over the association of 'pinda' with 'funerals'. It's too dark a metaphor.

  

But another KEY point must be noted, as Venkateshji mentioned, which is the varna issue. For brahmans, the offered rice must be cooked (as a pakayajna category). For non-brahman yajamanas (both in theory and in my observed experience), raw rice-grains are used. Even at cremations, I have seen the funerary purohits make brahman yajamanas cook the rice on a laukika fire (Kamalakarabhatta allows that the pretapinda may be cooked on a laukika fire), while all others use raw rice-grains or barley-flour (depending on the region). The north uses barley flour because it is more available; Bengal uses raw rice-grains. (Also, the Bengali term for yava is also yava, pronounced "job", referring to the grains and not the flour).

  

But I must also note that this is not due to ethnic discrimination. The importance derives from the fire on which it is cooked. Only the ahitagni (including the avasthyagnika) is eligible to offer cooked rice to the pitrs. Nowadays, the brahman is synonymous to that term. That is the distinction that has remained since the Vedic times. Only that food that has been cooked over a consecrated fire is fit to be offered, otherwise it is to be offered raw.

  

I contacted my purohit friends in Ujjain to ask about the tradition among the MP ritualists. He confirmed it is the same for them. The brahmans use cooked rice, while others use barley flour. As for Gaya - since the traffic is quite heavy - I have seen that they simply make everyone use barley flour. It is possible that for a more generous yajamana, the Gayawal may switch to the cooked rice version. I texted my Gaya contact, but he hasn't replied yet.

  

To return nonetheless to your original question (the diet of our forefathers), I believe you must direct your attention to the purodasa itself also. That would yield more effective clues. The grhyasutras too have interesting snippets of information on that.

  

Pranam,

Sahishnu Parasharya
