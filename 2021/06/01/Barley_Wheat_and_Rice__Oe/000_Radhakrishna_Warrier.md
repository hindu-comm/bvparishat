Do the piṇḍa-s offered to the pitṛ during śrāddha give any clue to the diet of our forefathers?  In my community, the piṇḍa consists mainly of cooked rice, ghee, and a little sesame. Cooked rice seems to have been the staple diet of our forefathers as far back as collective memory goes. Also, from the start of grain cultivation in Kerala during the prehistoric times, rice appears to have been the most cultivated grain.
In the northwest of India, barley seems to have been the staple grain of consumption in the ancient times as the Vedas mention barley (yava) predominantly. Do the people of Punjab and northwest India offer barley in the piṇḍa for śrāddha?

  

When was it that barley was replaced by wheat in the north and northwest? I believe rice was never the staple in the north and northwest. However, rice seems to have been the staple of eastern India (present day Bengal, Bihar, Odisha, eastern UP, Assam, Nepal, etc.) even during the prehistoric times. In the south, rice appears to have been the staple grain from the dawn of grain cultivation. South Indian languages do not have a local word for barley except the Sanskrit tatsama yava, whereas Indo Aryan has words cognate with Sanskrit yava (जौ ਜੌ જવ; not sure about Bengali, Odiya, Assamese etc.)  Even the Persian word for barley is jo (جو) obviously a cognate of Indo Aryan words for barley.   

  

When I was young, my mother used to give me barley kanji whenever I had fever or was otherwise sick. She believed barley was easy to digest and nutritious.
