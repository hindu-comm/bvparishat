Thanksa lot,Prof. Deshpande ji. I Googled and downloaded a few articles that seemed interesting. If it is not inconvenient for you, I would be grateful if you could send me the articles of Dr. Dorian Fuller that you have.

  

And thanksShri Venkatesh ji, Shri Ujjwal ji and Shri Sahishnu ji for your inputs. The article that Shri Ujjwal ji forwarded is interesting.
I noticed that the author places Suśruta in the CE while the modern consensus seems to be that the "elder" Suśruta lived in the BCE.
