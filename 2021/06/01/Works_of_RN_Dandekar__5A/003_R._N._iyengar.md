Dear Professor Deshpande,

Thank you for your kind response. I had collected some information about Prof. Dandekar's publications from your EJVS article of 2001.

I will try to get hold of the Ajanta Publications. Some extracts from this collection are available online but difficult to read on the screen.

His paper on Vishnu I collected from the PV.Kane Felicitation volume. Varuna is available in ABORI. He prefers an objective approach to

associate relative importance of the RV deities, based on the number of hymns devoted to the particular devataa.

At least for Vishnu that is one of his observations. I am wondering how he reconciles the

numerical characters associated with some of the RV deities, (for example Maruts) even though the number of hymns devoted to them may be less.

Regards
