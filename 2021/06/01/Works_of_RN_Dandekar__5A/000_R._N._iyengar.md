Dear scholars,

Is there any "Collected Works of Dandekar" available? In particular I am looking for his papers on the Vedas. I have read with interest his papers *Vishnu in the Veda*s and

*Asura Varuna.* Not allthe old ABORI volumes are available on Archives. A famous Indologist like Dandekar must have published outside ABORI also. His approach is that of a scholar fully interior to the culture, but analysing the texts in the light of the paradigms of IE mythology. In such an approach interesting new insights show up.

Any pointers or information on his researches on Vedic deities (or gods) would be helpful.

Thanks in advance

  

RN Iyengar
