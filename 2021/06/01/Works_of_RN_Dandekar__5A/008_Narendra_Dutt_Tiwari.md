Dear Prof. R.N. Iyengar

I am very much grateful to you that you inquire about Prof. R. N. Dandekar's work. I am also a student of Veda and working as Associate Professor in 'Nava Nalanda Mahavihar, Deemed University', Nalanda, Bihar. If it ispossible, please share the soft copies of Prof. Dandekar's work with us.

With regards

Narendra Dutt Tiwari
