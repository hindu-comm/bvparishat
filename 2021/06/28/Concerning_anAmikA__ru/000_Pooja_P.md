namo vidvadbhyaH,

  

The paada "कनिष्ठिकाधिष्ठितकालिदासा" of the famous poem led me on the search to the origin of the word anAmikA being used for the the ring finger.

  

It seems that since shiva nipped off brahma's fifth head with this finger, aprashastAt anAmikA is what the koshas state.

  

But I'm curious about this story - as to which purANa states this and why did shiva use the ring finger, the logic behind it - if any.

  

Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.

  

With Regards,

Pooja
