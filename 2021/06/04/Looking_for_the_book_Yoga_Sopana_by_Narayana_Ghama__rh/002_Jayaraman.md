Namaste Shankara ji  

  

Thank you very much for the link. I also looked at archive but could not find it. I see that the title is spelt in a different way in the archive file - Yogasopaan Puura\~va Chatushhk.  

  

How do you locate such content? Pls share trade secrets :-) (just joking!)  

  

regards

Jayaraman
