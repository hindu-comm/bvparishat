Dear Prof Kannan,  

Accurate listings should go in tandem with digitization. There are several hundreds of Indological Journal. What purpose does listing serve if the contents cannot be made accessible on open platforms where any one who is interested should be able to download articles or the journals. Its important to first locate such Journals complete sets get permission to digitize and then digitize and make their contents available on a perpetual basis. If you can can help with the first two steps one journal series at time I can take care of further needed steps.

Regards
