What is required to **improve upon thi**s is a rearrangement in columns

  

1 Place of publication  

2 Year of commencement of publication  

3 Periodicity (quarterly/half-yearly, etc.)  

4 Language(s) commonly allowed/accommodated

5 Standard abbreviation for the Journal name, if any

6 Full name of the Journal

7 Usual/preferred themes/issues/domains

8 *Whether peer-reviewed*

9 *Whether included in Scopus* etc.

10 Current Editor (indicating the year/tenure of editorship if any).

11 Remarks (such as break in continuity/combined volumes/cessation of publication/re-nomenclature etc.)

 & additional info if any  

  

Can **Indic Academy** attempt on these/better lines  

so that the journals become more user-friendly  

for scholars - students/researchers/librarians/documentors

and help in data-mining etc.?

  

Plus a repository of Contents Pages of each issue of each journal

and a combined Index (=merging of Author Index & Title Index  

\- so that there is a single-stroke search;  

authors' names in italics, say, to differentiate the two ).

  

I know I am too greedy and too ambitious, and too idealistic.

But won't it help so many people ?

This could be a small (yeah, not too small) project

(if there are takers).
