Dear all,

  

I am happy to share about the publication of my new book**'Īśopaniṣad: An English Commentary'**. It has been published by Subbu Publications, Hubli.

  

Īśopaniṣad is one of the short Upanishads with only 18 mantras but which captures the entire gamut of Hindu philosophy and worldview. This commentary, which is divided into two parts, aims to not only provide a word-by-word explanation on each of the verses but also provide an exposition of the vision of the Upanishad going beyond its text.
