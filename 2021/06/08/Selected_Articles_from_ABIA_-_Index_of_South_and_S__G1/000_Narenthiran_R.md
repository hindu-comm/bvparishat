Dea All,  

  

Please see attachment contains a list of bibliographical references of the "Selected Articles from ABIA - Index of South and Southeast Asian Art and Archaeology". Compiled from the portal of Brill online database.

As it is a commercial database, entries are displayed very limited
(maximum 3 references) under different subject headings.

Here i have used the keyword "Tamil Nadu" for the period 2010-2020

  

Thanks

Narenthiran
