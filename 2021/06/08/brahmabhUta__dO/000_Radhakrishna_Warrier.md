I was recently reading the paper "*The meaning of the phrase 'to become brahman-' in Vedic and Sutta Piṭaka sources*" by Chiara Neri and Tiziana Pontillo. This post is not about the subject matter of the paper but something else that caught my eyes. In this paper the authors discuss the term *brahmabhūta*that appears in the Pāli Sutta Piṭaka. They have quoted many instances of this phrase in the Sutta Piṭaka. Here is a sample quote:

  

"Brahmabhūto atitulo mārasenappamaddano

Sabbāmitte vasīkatvā, modāmi akutobhayo"

  

What attracted my attention in all the many Pali quotes in this paper is that while all other words in the quotes conform to Pali phonology, the term "brahmabhūta" alone remains without any changes to its Sanskrit form. The "r" of Brahma is not lost and the "hma" is not simplified to any other form. This looked strange to me.
