Dear Radhakrishna Ji,

  

  The words brāhmaṇa, brahmā are anomaly in Pāli phonology, and some scholars have suggested that there is some partial Sanskritization of the originally vernacular texts. Among the Ashokan edicts, only the northwestern edicts preserve the combination -br-, and the Gandhari Prakrit also preserves this combination. Curiously, while Pāli preserves \[or Sanskritizes\] the words brāhmaṇa and brahma, it has the more normal khattiya and sudda. Partial Sanskritization of Prakrits does happen occasionally, as is the case of old Marathi seen in the works of Jñāneśvara, where Sanskrit and Prakrit words sit next to each other. With best regards,
