Respected members,

  

I am pleased to share Part 9 of 10 of my blog refuting Nilesh Oak's dating of Ramayana to 12209 BCE.[](https://rajarammohanroy.medium.com/refutation-of-nilesh-oaks-astronomical-dating-of-the-ramayana-to-12209-bce-bae2c9788d9c)From the explicit mentions of seasons and months, it is clear that they conform to the standard configuration from the earliest times till now.
