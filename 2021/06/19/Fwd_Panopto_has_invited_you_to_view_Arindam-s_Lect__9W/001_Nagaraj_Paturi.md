This seems to be tenure /contract saving for these panditammanyas.

  

He does that towards the end of the video too while talking about stavapriya of Vishnusahasranama.

  

Vedic (Meemaamsaa) way of understanding stuti is as descrptionand not as adoration or flattery in human interpersonal communication.

  

Stuuyate is used in the sense of explained or described in Vedic discourses.

  

Devataa is the entity described.

  

When a description is apt , the described entity is rightly **captured**(this is metaphorically said to be mantrabaddha), figuratively , any described entity is **hurt** by a wrong description.
and poetically, a described entity **likes** to be described correctly ,

  

It is this **liking** to be described correctly that is there in stavapriyatva.

  

Arasikas !!!

  

Shall we say numskulls ? !
