Dear friends,

  

India Discovery Center is featuring a young scholar musician from Delhi in a set of two lectures to help us analyze the origin of the Chhandas.
The first lecture will deal with  

the saamagaaana and will set the parameters for the musical production of the early

compositions. We will set up the empirical reasoning to formulate the notes through  

vocal rendering. This lecture is scheduled for Saturday, June 26, 201 at 7:00 PM

India time (9:30 AM US East Coast Time).  

The follow up lecture on the use of the chhandas in classical literature is scheduled  

the next day, Sunday June 27, 2021 at 7:00PM India time (9:30AM US East Coast Time).

  

The speaker is Dr Rishiraj Pathak, a saamagaana researcher and practitioner currently

in the Faculty at Delhi University. The lectures will be supplemented with demonstrations of the techniques through vocal rendering. The bio of the speaker and the abstracts for the lectures are given in  

<https://www.indiadiscoverycenter.org/voice-rendering-and-literature/>

  

The registration for the lectures is through <https://www.indiadiscoverycenter.org/>

There is a small registration fee $10 for each lecture, $15 for the pair. Please feel free  

to write to me privately to waive the fees if you need. Please feel free to suggest names of individual musicologists who may like complimentary admissions to the lectures.  

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
