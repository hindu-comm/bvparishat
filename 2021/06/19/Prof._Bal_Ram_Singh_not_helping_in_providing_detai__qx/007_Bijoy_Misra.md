Dear Sri Venkat,

Arbitrary is a word best used when some readings in a text are preferred over others to advance a personal narrative.  

  

That is exactly how the the dating research has started more than a hundred years ago,  

  

Regarding software, I would reserve my comments.   

Calibrate them and you would discover.

  

Best regards,

BM
