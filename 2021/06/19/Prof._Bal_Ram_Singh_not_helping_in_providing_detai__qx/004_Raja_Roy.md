Dear Prof. Nagaraj,

  

Prof. Bal Ram Singh has the duty to investigate matters of research ethics as the Director of the Institute.



The question still is why is Oak not making it public even after reading all these correspondences. He has made the claim hundredsof times. It should be in a file ready to upload.

  

Do you see that he is making people believe that Lord Rama was born in Sharad season without a single piece of evidence? Did you read my article Part 8? He has just made up thatChaitra Shuddha Navami occurred on 17 December, 12209 BCE. I challenge him to prove it. Then he has made up a whole calendar of Ramayana without any basis.

  

We have a serious problem here that needs to be addressed.

  

Best regards,

Raja
