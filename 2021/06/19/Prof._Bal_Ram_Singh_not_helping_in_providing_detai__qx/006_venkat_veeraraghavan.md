Dear Dr. Mishra

  

How is a reading arbitrary if it is all sourced from the same text?

Consistent is the word i would use.

Arbitrary is a word best used when some readings in a text are preferred over others to advance a personal narrative.

  

Why this objection to sw?

The sw attempts to model the night sky for dates in the past.

While it may not be suitable for irregular events its a good model to replicate motion of satellites....which are mostly regular.

  

There is an element of error given current understanding of axial tilt and its history but dont you think it gives something to work with and hopefully improve?

  

Regards

  

V
