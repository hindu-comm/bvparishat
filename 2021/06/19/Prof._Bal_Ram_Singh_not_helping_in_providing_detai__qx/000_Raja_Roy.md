Respected members,

  

I had sought help of Prof. Bal Ram Singh, Director of Institute of Advanced Sciences. It is a private institute that has given Adjunct Professorship to Oak. I asked Prof. Bal Ram Singh to make public the exact details of 575+ corroborations that Oak claims from the Rāmāyaṇa. Oak has not made the list public even after multiple requests. I expected Prof. Bal Ram Singh to address this issue as manufacturing of data is a serious research ethics violation. My interactions with Prof. Bal Ram Singh show that he is not interested in making the exact details of 575+ corroborations public or confirming that Oak’s claims are fake. He just wants the issue to go away.
