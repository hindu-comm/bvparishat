Dear Prof. Nagaraj,

I beg to differ. Prof. Bal Ram Singhis bound to investigate the matter and make it public as the Director of the Institute. This is not a conference issue. It is a research integrity issue. Oak has been making this statement for years. You tell me why he is not putting the exact details of 575+ corroborations in the publicdomain?

BestRegards,

Raja
