Dear Prof Paturi,

[Bibliography of Hindu Law \| A Cooperative Project of Scholars and Students (utexas.edu)](https://sites.utexas.edu/hindulaw/)

  

This is the type of subject wise database that's needed This is an answer to Prof Kannan suggestion made on another thread.

this database is easy to create and one can use resources of zotero. Input can be done by a community of scholars. Scholars themselves can input data from their domain of expertise. It can be managed by an administrator to ensure uniformity This process will be simple straight forward, easy to use and will benefit all. Selfless work and ten minutes devotion by scholars everyday or periodically is what is needed. One can start systematically documenting books available at [archives.org](http://archives.org) initially and then expand

Regards

Ajit Gargeshwari
