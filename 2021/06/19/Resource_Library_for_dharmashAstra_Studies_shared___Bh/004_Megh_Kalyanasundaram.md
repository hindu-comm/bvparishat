"During the pandemic, Patrick Olivelle has been hard at work transcribing several important texts..."

"Please join me in a public expression of thanks to Patrick for his typically tireless scholarly efforts to make these texts available."

  

For transcribing and making them accessible for review and use—especially if he has actually manually transcribed all of this (not that it would be any less commendable if Dr Olivelle had partal help from others in the process)—I take this opportunity to thank Dr Olivelle for these specific actions: thank you.

  

Thank you Patruri-ji, for sharing Dr Davis' email.

  

Thank youDamodara-ji, for your effort to increase ease of download(which I am yet to do but have bookmarked).

  

I also take this opportunity to thank volunteers at sites such as (but not limited to)<https://sanskritdocuments.org/>(amongst others):🙏

  

Best,

Megh
