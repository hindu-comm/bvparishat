**Great plans, high hopes.**

**Making all this available to the scholarly world here has been a persistent dream for me.**

**Young researchers can get some excellent resources and models for research here.**

  

(Addressing the problem more generally, Indian academics has accomplished far less than it easily could,

owing, among varied reasons, largely to the reservation policy even at higher levels. And its genesis? :  

regular and continuous Christian/Communist exaggeration and propaganda for over two centuries  

has besmirched the entire Hindu tradition of millennia. (We can also see how easily, contrastingly,  

the Romans/Greeks would stand exonerated by these two cliques, for their horrendous sins  

of slavery and genocide - nothing comparable to which was ever practised in India).  

  

Nothing could be more unfair, after all, than assessments of the past using criteria fashioned after  

present-day trends and patterns, and norms and parameters, which can only spell grave injustice  

(to any civilisation for that matter). This matter had to be raised here as the erstwhile ruling party  

threw academics to the dogs by exposing it to all perils of corruption, degeneration, and exploitation  

\- and to recover from which is a veritable uphill task.)

  

Going by the commendable standard of Indian/Indological scholars in the 40's and 50's (and even 60's)

of the last century, India would by now have been a country of extraordinary high academic output  

(in quality as well as quantity). That our own rulers of the past seven decades dealt a deathblow  

to traditional education is an unforgettable and unforgivable fact. Anyway, it is this that has  

lowered the standards in our academics all around, and lifting it out of the present mire is  

quite a Herculean task indeed.)

  

The need of the hour, anyway, is good academic models - whether from the East or the West

(but *sans*, needless to say, of the prejudices of the White Supremacists (born racists as they after all are),  

and the ever incorrigible, irresponsible, and intolerant Leftists - masters *par excellence* all, of  

Doublespeak unadulterated).

  

Our creed ever was, be it emphasised:  

*prajñā vivekam labhate bhinnair āgama-darśanaiḥ* \|

  

The apt caution provided by Prof. Paturi must indeed be borne in the mind - viz.  

the numerous texts produced in our own traditions (differing on smaller or bigger counts  

from texts previously produced, nevertheless building upon them), unmistakably and unquestionably constitute

high quality research - Research Indian Brand : our own millennia-old heritage has borne out  

steady and stupendous vitality and interdisciplinarity (much more than do the current patterns of  

research envisaged in the West, no more than but a few centuries old, after all as they are).

  

The West (and especially its Indological unit) would indeed stand to benefit both itself and true research,  

by shedding its limitless belligerence and bias - also in view of the fact that India is now  

a rising economic and military power. Apart from these *vaiśya* and *kṣātra* factors,  

the *brāhma* factor (the knowledge sector) too is all set now to forge ahead even if at its own pace.  

The current power crisis and labour crisis looming large in China and elsewhere (including Europe),  

also point to the steady forging of the formidable and valuable *śaudra* factor too in our country.  

The four forces ever in cooperation and coordination produced a majestic civilisation in the past,

and there is no reason why they cannot or would not today.  

  

(I may please be excused for my prolixity involving but an apparent *excursus*: I had to account, ineluctably,

for the present-day academic degeneration, its prognosis and diagnosis, and aimed at a hopeful/sensible solution).
