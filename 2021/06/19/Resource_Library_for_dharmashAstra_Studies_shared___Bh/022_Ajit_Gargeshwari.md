I just mentioned as Indian academia was drawn in and there is a lot of discussion here on BVP in various threads on websites and postings done by other scholars on several threads in the name of discussion or giving information or why should such a view on another mailing list on another website not be discussed . Anyway anything and everythingcan be discussed but many time views gets confused between personal views and view expressed by the same person in another role

  

**I am in total agreement with** "In fact, this understanding helps scholars trained in Veda and shaastra gurukulas not to get intimidatedby the so called Research Methodology as something that only modern education can give them , to realize that they inherit a training that already includes research skills or in other words what is behind their pratibhaa in their shaastric thinking is research itself.

That they inherit the tradition of Badarayana, Gaudapada, Shankara, Madhva, Ramanuja, Vallabha, Nimbarka etc. in Vedanta, Jaimini, Sabara, Kumarila, Prabhakara etc. in Meemaamsaa , Gautama, Udayana, Gadadhara etc. in Nyaya, Bharata, Bhamaha, Bhattanayaka, Abhinavagupta, Rajasekhara etc. in Alankara , many many more such path breakers in these and other shaastras, gives them the confidence that they don't need any separate training in the so called Research Methodology unless they are interested in doing a study from a modern university approach.
