I just said an aspiration which may or may not be achieved for any bibliographicproject but is possible if the entire community of scholars who are both within and outside the list can participate and are encouraged to do so. Collaborationthan refutation will help

Indian academics is notwhat you say true in all areas and is not related to funding. If one is funded not even enough to cover salaries what research can be done.. This is not my remark, great scholars do say the same. To get more funding one needsto have quality researchers and quality researchers will work if there is money and independence. In humanities one is threatened and removed for views held then how fearless and independent research can be conducted. any way i end
