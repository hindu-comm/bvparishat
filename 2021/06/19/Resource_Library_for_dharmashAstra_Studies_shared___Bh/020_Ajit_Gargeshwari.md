Views held by researchers have the needed depth and the common man holds certain views but so called researchers who are primarilytrained as doctors, engineers, financial experts businessmen have become scholars on the web and outside.... get materials published (Many not reviewed by experts but by a single editor and funded by organisationshaving their own agenda who influence editors) and make themselves too visible too often by media and list postings,Concentrating too much on their agendas is the cause for many unwanted discussions. Many pretend they are learners or seekers but often they are not. Though nothing is perfect there are great scholars and a good amount of high quality research are being conducted and will be conducted. The future is bright and there is immense hope.
