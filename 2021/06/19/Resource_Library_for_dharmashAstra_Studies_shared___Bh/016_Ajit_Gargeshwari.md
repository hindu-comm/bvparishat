This group has severalmemberswell versed in database and databasemanagement. They can suggest an interface that can be hosted on an Indian server as a contribution towards 'Make in india'. One can look into zoteroand create a similarinterface. a well funded private organisation can host and maintain such a database on a perpetual basis. If one wants to be comprehensive to include a million book and and millions of articles a well funded and well thoughtout plan is needed else one will end up something like this which will not be so useful
