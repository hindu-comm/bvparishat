It is so wonderful that this scholar has published his effort openly and freely under CC BY-SA license. Another leukospheric scholar,McComas Taylor completed his versified translation of the Viṣṇupurāṇa and published it open access at <https://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/n8264/pdf/book.pdf> !  
  

It is something Indian scholars and universities should learn from. I have sought digitized searchable versions of smRti-nibandha-s for my studies and practice (I know they exist in private collections of some Indian scholars) - the best I managed to get was "talk to the hand" or "it will be published one day, be patient" or "use my app" type response. Even where it is published, there is no guarantee that it will stay on the net (like that infamous tirupati corpus from last decade). Some (otherwise venerable) organizations are so stupid as to use outdated fonts and computer setups just to thwart data copying! No idea what is accomplished by such poverty/ scarcity mindset - but this is clearly inferior to the open access approach. Barring exceptions it is striking that western scholars contribute such text editions far in excess of their numbers.  
  
  
For my studies (and potentially others), I've saved devanAgarI versions at<https://vishvasa.github.io/kalpAntaram/smRti-chandrikA/> ,<https://vishvasa.github.io/kalpAntaram/smRtiH/yAjJNavalkyaH/> and<https://vishvasa.github.io/kalpAntaram/smRtiH/manuH/medhAtithiH/> . You can get the content in various other scripts and get to/ edit the source using the buttons shown in the pic <https://i.imgur.com/ar0lQdv.png> . Feel free to use, correct and copy.
