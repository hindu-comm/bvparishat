To put things in perspective, I must hasten to add that this is (relatively speaking) but a small drawback on the part of the hindu scholars (for the most part they are not against hindu interests asthe McComas Taylor types are - <https://groups.google.com/g/meta-indology/c/5iUkoGSbBFk> , and they don't turn the sacred myths of the Gods into sick porn ). Of course, that should not stop us from admiring and reflecting upon some of their fine qualities and deeds (- just as one might admire particular qualities of other lowly beings such as rAvaNa or some jihAdi ) .
