es(cc-ing Mr Patrick in case he might clarify)

  

I am curious as to what might motivate western scholars to undertake such taxing efforts! What do they get out of it? It is not like their quotidian AchAra/ vyavahAra/ prAyashcitta is affected by what some old Indian savant thought (that being my motivation for dharmashAstra study). And I presume that western scholarship would've long exhausted it's curiosity about intricate details of early Indo-Aryan behavior prescriptions. Plus they would've long since gained more than enough arsenalto go at the backward patriarchal oppressive heathens. I can only suppose that they like parsing sanskrit just like some people like Sudoku - but I am not sure if there are other factors involved.
