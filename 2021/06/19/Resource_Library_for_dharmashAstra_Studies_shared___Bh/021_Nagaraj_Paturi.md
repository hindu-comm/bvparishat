Dear Sri Ajit-ji,

  

I don't know why this whole 'primarily trained as doctors, engineers, financial experts' is being brought here. What was the trigger for this in the thread for this?

  

If you are responding to Prof. Kannan's post, there was no context in that post for this. He was talking about a totally different issue. The issue is whether the process behind novel ideas expressed in ancient Indian, particularly Sanskrit texts can be viewed as research or not.

  

In fact, this understanding helps scholars trained in Veda and shaastra gurukulas not to get intimidatedby the so called Research Methodology as something that only modern education can give them , to realize that they inherit a training that already includes research skills or in other words what is behind their pratibhaa in their shaastric thinking is research itself.

  

That they inherit the tradition of Badarayana, Gaudapada, Shankara, Madhva, Ramanuja, Vallabha, Nimbarka etc. in Vedanta, Jaimini, Sabara, Kumarila, Prabhakara etc. in Meemaamsaa , Gautama, Udayana, Gadadhara etc. in Nyaya, Bharata, Bhamaha, Bhattanayaka, Abhinavagupta, Rajasekhara etc. in Alankara , many many more such path breakers in these and other shaastras, gives them the confidence that they don't need any separate training in the so called Research Methodology unless they are interested in doing a study from a modern university approach.
