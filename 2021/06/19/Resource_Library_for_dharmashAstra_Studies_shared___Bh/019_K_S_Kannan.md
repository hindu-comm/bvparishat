I agree with what Ajit-ji says.

Much can be achieved by a collaborative approach.

  

Caution should be exercised, though, where things do not come without strings.

Ajit-ji rightly notes how humanities is rife with strife and groupism of all sorts.

  

(Apparently, the realms of science and technology are not (as yet) as vitiated  

as humanities and social sciences are, by intolerant cliques and coteries.

Already, *Lancet*, a premier medical journal, is betraying all marks of the malices  

of the Leftist mafia, and thus presenting distortions, capitulating to the political agenda/pressure thereof).

  

The list provided by Ajit-ji is extremely useful.

  

An important milestone will be achieved when these two things happen in our country:

\(a\) (**info**:) Annual Bibliographies of Indological Research are made regularly and routinely available; and

\(b\) (**access**:) the counterpart of Jstor for Indian Indological journals, past and present, is well established;

\[and of course (c) the two are made easily available and are properly and fully utilised\].
