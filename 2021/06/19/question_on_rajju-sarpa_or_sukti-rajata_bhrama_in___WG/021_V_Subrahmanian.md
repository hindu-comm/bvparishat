That an object can and is looked at differently in different situations is well within our day to day experience. A man buys for his wife, during several occasions, ornaments such as bangles, chain, necklaces, etc. made of gold. On a certain occasion, when the family is in need of funding a landed property purchase, for instance, the *total weight and money value* of the gold at hand and *not the number and design of bangles, chains, etc.* matters*. *What was purchased and used as bangles, chains, etc. is now viewed and transacted as simply some grams of gold.

  

As part of the Shiva linga abhishekam there is a 'suvarna abhishekam'.
At that juncture, anyone from the participants would give their ring or bangle or chain for the purpose. Any of these would serve the need then since what is required is gold and not a chain or ring.

  

In all such instances there is invariably a two-level viewing of the entity at hand. Either level gains prominence/precedence at a given situation while the other level goes into the background. The idea of vyavaharika-paramarthika reality is exactly this.

The below verses from TirumUlar's work Tirumandiram echo the idea:  
  
மரத்தை மறைத்தது மாமத யானை  
மரத்தில் மறைந்தது மாமத யானை  
பரத்தை மறைத்தது பார்முதல் பூதம்  
பரத்தில் மறைந்தது பார்முதல் பூதம்  
  
transliterated:  
marattai maRaittadu mAmada yAnai.  
marattil maRaindadu mAmada yAnai.  
parattai maRaittadu pArmudal bhUtam.  
parattil maRaindadu pArmudal bhUtam.  
  
Meaning: when the beautifully carved elephant is seen, one doesn't pay  
attention to the wood with which it is made.When the woodis perceived, the elephant disappears (no longer holds us in thrall).  
  
Similarly, the world made of five elements such as earth, is perceived,  
hides the Supreme. When the Supreme is perceived in the world, the world  
disappears (loses it's significance). The purpose of the teaching of vairagyam by all schools/systems is exactly with this in view.  
  
Just like the elephant and the wood are not  
different, the world and paramAtma are not different. To a child, the wood  
is not seen, only the elephant is. To an adult however, the wood that makes  
the elephant is visible.
