Thank you, what I gather from the following is this,

  

When words (the word 'satya' in the present discussion) in suitable oblique cases are juxtaposed or stand in apposition with the nominative case termination of the same word then the words in oblique cases refer to 'relative'.

  

When words ('satyasya' in the present discussion) stand alone be it in oblique cases then it has reference to pAramArthika (Brahman), so in ''satyasApihitam mukham'' the oblique case word 'satyasya' has reference to Brahman.

  

Question - When Brahman is 'independent' (swatantra as you have mentioned \<\<The case of the dependents such as the world is of the same nature as they have to depend on the Swatantra for their very fundamental existence>\>) then the import of all case and verb terminations should point to 'Brahman' not to the relative even when those words belonging to oblique cases are juxtaposed or stand in apposition with nominative words (because HE is Swatantra).

  
Thank you and Best regards,

The matter is very simple: 'satya' shabda, when used twice in the same passage, in different vibhaktis, as here, calls for giving two different levels of meaning. Hence, one is of dependent reality and the other not. Also, in the Taittiriya: satyam jnanam anantam brahma, there is no way satyam is anything other than paramarthika.

What is called vyaaharika and anirvachaniya is exactly the case with something that has a dependent reality. As in the rope-snake analogy, the snake, as long as the rope knowledge has not arisen, is accorded a reality. But is it un-negatable, abaadhita? No, and is it absolutely asat like gagana kusuma? No, because it is experienced. Hence alone it is called sadasad vilakshana, anirvachaniya. The case of the dependents such as the world is of the same nature as they have to depend on the Swatantra for their very fundamental existence.
