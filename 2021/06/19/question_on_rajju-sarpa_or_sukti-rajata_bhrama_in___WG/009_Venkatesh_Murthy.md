Namaste Sri Krishna Kashyapji  

  

If you see the immediately previoustext it is*vācārambhaṇam nāmadheyam[vikāraḥ](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/vikara#hinduism "show vikāraḥ definitions")*, all changes are mere words, in name only. Whenever we say something or someoneis in name only we actually mean it is not real but only in name. Example, some Prime Minister in the recent past was PM in name only. He was controlled by another person through his two terms. We say he was PM in name only but not really and the other person was the real PM. Similarly when we see a pot of clay the transformation is a name we give. Thereforethe transformation is not real but in name only. What is real? The clay alone is real. The transformation and the effect are both not real. Only the cause Clay is real. No transformation has really taken place. No pot is really there. It is Clay only.

  

What has happened is the above example may not be easyto understand and another much clearer example has taken its place in the literature. This exampleis of the rope snake or rajju sarpa. Everybody can easily understand this example of the illusory snakeand real rope. Another example is of the shell silver or Sukti Rajata. We will find these examples more and more in the source texts because they are easier to understand.
