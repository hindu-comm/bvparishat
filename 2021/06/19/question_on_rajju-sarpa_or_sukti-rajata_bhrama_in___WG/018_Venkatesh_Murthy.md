Namaste Prof Kannanji

  

You are right. In Advaita we consider Satya to be Traikalika-abadhitatva. The objects we see in waking are not there in dreams and the objects in the dream are not present in waking. Both waking and dream objects are not there in deep sleep. Reasoning along these lines we say the waking and dream objects are not real. They are not Satya but Mithya. But Mithyatva is not Traikalika Badhitatva. If it is Traikalika Badhitatva it will be the same as Sasha Sringa or Hare's Horn. That is asat. Mithyatva is defined as sad-asad-vilakshanatva. That means it is neither Satya nor pure Asat or Tuccha like a hare's horn. It is seen like the rajju sarpa but it is not really there. The hare's horn is not even seen anywhere.

  

But other belief systemsmay consider temporary objects with a finite life tobe Satya also. They may accept any temporary object seen to be Satya when it is not asat like a hare's horn and at the same time not an illusion like rajjusarpa. When Advaita says Satya it means something different in these systems. The word Satya in Advaita is not translated as Traikalika abadhitatva in the other system. Therefore two people from two different systems are talking about different things when they are arguing about what is Satya and what is not Satya.

  

One way to clear the confusion is to accept the temporary objects with finite life as Vyavaharika Satya. This is exactly done in Advaita. There is no argument the pot and Clay are Vyavaharika Satya. The Rajjusarpais PratibhasikaSatya. The Traikalika abadhitatvais now called Paramarthika Satya or Brahman. Therefore we now have Satta Traividhya of Paramarthika at the highest level and having Traikalika abadhitatva followed by Vyaharika Satya and PratibhasikaSatya. But Vyavaharika Pratibhasika Satya do not have Traikalika abadhitatva. Therefore they are called Mithya. When Advaita proclaims Brahma Satyam Jagan Mithya it means only this. It does not mean the world is a asator Tuccha vastu like a hare's horn.
