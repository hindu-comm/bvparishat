Namaste

  

I was trying to find out when and where the "rajju sarpa" analogy came to the philosophical literature.

  

I think it is in mahayana buddhism.

it is not in the upanishads (dasha)

  

rope snake illusion was mentioned in work of aryadeva 200 CE roughly.  
  
However, the type of illusion, definition etc. varied a lot. Shades of realism to shades of mAyA theory – in mahAyAna buddhism.  
Cittavisuddhiprakarana by Aryadeva, disciple of Nagarjuna (\~200-300 CE states:  
  
sarpabuddhiryathā rajjau rajjudṛṣṭau nivartate\|  
sarpabuddhiḥ punastatra naiva syādiha janmani\|\|68\|\|

Of course Advaita and Buddhism take this analogy in a different way.

for Buddhism there is no true basis such as Brahman. For mahayana buddhism the rope is also illusory eventually due to mutual dependence.  
  

**I have aquestion on rajju-sarpa or sukti-rajata bhrama in vishaya vakyas of Brahmasutra Shankara bhashya**

  

As far as I know in the vishaya vakyas of brahma sutras (vishaya vakyas are upanishad vakyas taken as the main reference to the sutras) mentioned in the Brahma-sutra-Shankara-Bhashya (BSB) , the rajjussarpa bhrama or sukti-rajata bhramais not mentioned in any major upanishads ( 10 or 13 upanishads). Rope-Snake illusion analogy did exist in Upanishads: tejobindu, nirvana Upanishad. (not in dashopanishad).

  

**I found this link. but don't know if the content is correct:**  

<https://vedapurana.org/single.php?s=1872&word=Rajjusarpa%20Nyaya%3E&secure>  

  

I would like to get some additional information regarding this.

The reason for my question is: The analogies in upanishads indicate more towards **parinama** rather than **"rajju sarpa"** kind regarding universe and Brahman. **I may be wrong. I want to find out. There may be references in some rare upanishads. Bhagavatha does talk about rajju sarpa analogy. However, in the major upanishads which are related to brahmasutras, I did not find such analogies.**
