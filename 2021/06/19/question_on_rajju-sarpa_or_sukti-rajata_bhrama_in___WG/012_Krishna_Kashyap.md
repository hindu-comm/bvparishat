In this sentence: : "Yatha, saumya, ekena mrt-pindena sarvam mrnmayam vijnatam syat vacarambhanam vikaro nama-dheyam, mrttika**iti eva** satyam"

the meaning goes as far as: by the knowledge of the lump of clay all its effects are known. here it means that: names and forms facilitates transactions (like vacarambhanam: such as "bring a pot full of water etc."), however all the names and forms are essentially mrittika. Here since it is said "mrittika iti eva satyam" all it means is that those forms and names (namely say a pot or bowl or whatever) are all essentially mrittika. here *satyam* word refers to *iti*. that means the fact that essentially all those names and forms are mud only. that does not mean the forms and names are unreal and mud is real.

why do you say no transformation has really taken place? a lump of clay is made into the shape of a pot by the potter. transformation is definitely there. this new transformed entity is called "pot". pot has some new uses such as being capable of holding water etc. you have stated "no pot is there". of course it is there and it is known by the name "pot" initially the same mud was known as lump of clay and now it is known as "pot". you cannot say the pot is unreal. pot is the nomenclature given to one of the effects of lump of clay. change of form of clay is the transformation. if such a transformation does not take place, pot will not have any use such as holding water. However, this new effect pot is nothing but made of mud. mrinmayam ghataha or mrit atmako ghataha.

  

In case of the PM example, all I can say is this person does not have the powers of PM or is useless as PM. However, he is not unreal. he is unfit as a PM. this "name only" concept does not fit well regarding clay-mud analogy since a pot is probably more useful than a lump of clay.

which source texts are we talking about?. These are all NON-Vedic sources or may be in some obscure upanishads outside the main upanishads referred to in the brahmasutras

  

my whole point is if the Upanishad's intention was to drive home the point of "reality and unreality", "rope snake analogy" or " sukti rajata analogy" would be stated right there in the text. the Upanishad uses the analogy of iron and its effects like nakha krintana or nail cutter, gold and its effects (ornaments) etc. but in no analogy the question of reality and unreality pops up.

  

If we just focus on Chandogya sadvidya alone for now, such a meaning of reality-unreality is definitely super imposed on the text and cannot be derived from the text of the upanishad. Knowing that the rope snake analogy and sukti rajata analogy is not cited anywhere in the vishaya vakyas of bramhasutras, we have to conclude that such a meaning was borrowed from the Buddhist views and super imposed on the text of Chandogya.

  

We can talk about other upanishads later. we should definitely state that Chandogya sadvidya does not talk about the reality-unreality of cause and effect respectively.
