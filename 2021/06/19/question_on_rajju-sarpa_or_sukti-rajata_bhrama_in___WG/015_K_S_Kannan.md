The problem reduces to the question of definitions.

Define the following:

1\. Identity

2\. Difference

3\. Appearance

4\. Reality

  

State the answers in this format of conditionals (or better ones) :

1\. A is the same as B if .... (conditions 1, 2, 3 etc. with connectives like &, or, etc.)  

2\. A is different from B if ...

3\. A can be said to be an appearance of B if ...

4\. A can be said to be a mere appearance if ...

5\. A can be said to be real if ...

6\. If A and B have the same Surface Structure, then ... (But define first SS and DS)  

7\. If A and B have the same Deep Structure, then ..

  

If there are *differences in the very definitions* insisted upon by different parties,

one may say "We just beg to differ in this issue". There is hardly much to argue.  

If the conditions are the same for the various parties involved,

there can be some comparison/assessment wrt the conditions conformed to or otherwise.
