Thank you Sir,

  

I have a short question on the following (my focus is on simultaneity),

  

\<In the case of jagat - brahman relationship, time is in its no length phase , there is no sequentiality , brahman and jagat exist \*simultaneously\* as forms of each other>  
  

'Simultaneity' (काल) is अविद्यत्मक because it is the receptacle of everything (सर्वाधार). Jagat belongs to this receptacle of time.

  

Brahman cannot belong to the receptacle of time.

  

How 'simultaneity' possible between Brahman and Jagat?

  

Thanks and regards,

pariNaama presupposes /requires sequential existence of vikaarya and vikaara.

  

sequential existence requires a certain length of time between the existence of vikaarya as vikaarya and the existence of the same as vikaara.

  

if length of time itself is a vikaara of a vikaarya form of time without length, in the vikaarya phase, i.e., no length phase of time, there is no sequentiality between events.

  

Events are simultaneous.

  

In the case of jagat - brahman relationship, time is in its no length phase , there is no sequentiality , brahman and jagat exist simultaneously as forms of each other.

  

It is this simultaneity that is called a vivarta relationship.
