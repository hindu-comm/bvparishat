I remember to have raised the issue with the scholar-giant NSRamanuja Tatacharya,

some 30 years ago, asking him to provide Vedic and Upanishadic sources (or even rough parallels thereof) of  

*rajju-sarpa-nyāya*. He had said he had not come across any. While this sacred literature

is by no means lacking in analogies (*upamā*-s and *dr̥ṣṭānta*-s), this analogy somehow  

seems to have no easy parallel.

  

Of course, *vācyārtha* is not the only recourse.
