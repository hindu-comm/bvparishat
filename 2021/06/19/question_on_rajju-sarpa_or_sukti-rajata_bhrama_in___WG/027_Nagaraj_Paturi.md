pariNaama presupposes /requires sequential existence of vikaarya and vikaara.

  

sequential existence requires a certain length of time between the existence of vikaarya as vikaarya and the existence of the same as vikaara.

  

if length of time itself is a vikaara of a vikaarya form of time without length, in the vikaarya phase, i.e., no length phase of time, there is no sequentiality between events.

  

Events are simultaneous.

  

In the case of jagat - brahman relationship, time is in its no length phase , there is no sequentiality , brahman and jagat exist simultaneously as forms of each other.

  

It is this simultaneity that is called a vivarta relationship.
