Good day to all,  

  

Found the following interesting.

  

\<\<Satyasya satyam: Paramarthika and vyavaharikam – Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2.1.20: सत्यस्य सत्यमिति (प्राणा वै सत्यंतेषामेषसत्यम्) ॥ २० ॥ \[The first satyam in the mantra (in shashThI vibhakti) is vyavaharika and the second satyam (in prathamaa vibhakti) is paramarthika. Same case with what is there within brackets too. \>\>  
  
The phrase "सत्यस्य सत्यम्" is understood by Sri.Shankara as : परस्यैव ब्रह्मणः 'सत्यस्य सत्यं' नाम उपनिषत्परा and over the next two sets Brahmana texts the commentary expands meaning of the phrase"सत्यस्य सत्यम्" elaborately.

  

If the term 'सत्यस्य' expressed in sixth case is 'relative' (व्यावहारिक) then how does on understand the same term 'सत्यस्य' referred to as ब्रह्मन् in the भाष्य to the the mantra viz., हिरण्मयेन पात्रेण \*सत्यस्यापिहितं मुखम् । Commentary thereon : "सत्यस्यैव आदित्यमण्डलस्थस्य ब्रह्मणः" The term'सत्यस्य' found the mantra is understood as 'तद्यत्तत् सत्यमसौ स आदित्य' इति but not as'relative' (व्यावहारिक)

  

If one of two 'Satya'termsstand for 'relative' (व्यावहारिक) then how does one understand the pervading aspect of ब्रह्मन् also called by that term in "अग्निर्होता कविक्रतुः \*सत्यश्चित्रश्रवस्तमः । देवो देविभिरागमत् ।।RV 1.1.5।। and such an aspect is beautifully put elsewhere as "देवस्य पश्य काव्यम्" ।।RV 1055.5।।. The श्रुतिमाता adds to 'दृश्यकाव्य' the other beautiful aspect of श्रव्यकाव्य when it says : अस्मा इत् काव्यं वच उक्थमिन्द्राय शंस्यम् । तस्मा उ ब्रह्मवाहसे गिरो वर्धन्त्यत्रयो गिरः शुम्भन्त्यत्रयः ।। RV 5.39.5।। He is the 'main purport' ofश्रव्यकाव्य and He is 'controller' ofदृश्यकाव्य (the whole universe) is behind these utterances and thus they are 'satya'.

  

श्रुतिमाता goes further stating thatदृश्यकाव्य (universe) is 'satya' because it's 'prop & support' is 'satya' and beauty ofश्रुतिमाता is unmatched when it says,  

  

सत्येनोत्तभिता भूमिः सूर्येणोत्तभिता च द्यौः। ऋतेनादित्यास्तिष्टन्ति दिवि सोमो अधिश्रितः (AV 14.1.1)

  

The ऐतरेयब्राह्मण brings out the सद्वरूप-परवर्तकत्व aspect of Brahman in terms of 'satya' when it etymologizes that very term as under,

  

(सत्य =) \*सदिति प्राणा अस्तीत्यन्नं \*यदित्यसौ आदित्यः (२.१.५ ६)

  

From the above, the term "सत्य" in all its declensional forms has "primary reference" to "Brahman" and the 'others' get that name because of Him. Nowhere in the above instances one gets the sense that the 'other' than Brahman also called by the term सत्य in all its declensional forms as 'relative'.

  

\<\<One can see that the 'satyam' that is vyavaharika is having no svatantra satyatvam; it has to depend for its existence (sattaa) on the Satyam that is Brahman, and hence is paratantra, dependent reality. This is akin to the analogy in the rope-snake where the adhyasta sarpa has no reality of its own; it is said to exist (by the one under bhrama)only on the basis of the rope's existence. He has transferred the rope-existence to the snake that he has superposed in that locus. \>\>  

  

In the thought Sri.Shankara, the व्यावहरिका is indescribable, and to call it as 'paratantra' or 'dependent reality' will amount to a 'definite description' of it, which is not desirable.

  

In the backdrop of clear cut position of Sri. Shankara which is stated in his commentary on the भगवती श्रुति under"सत्यस्य सत्यम्" it is but difficult to even to name the 'other' as'paratantra' or 'dependent reality',leave alone describing it, as the 'other is not there at all' : परब्रह्मव्यतिरेकेण 'संसारी नाम नान्यत्' वस्त्वन्तरमस्ति,

  

Thank you and Best regards,

Three states of Reality in the Taittiriya Upanishad:  

>   
> The mantra सत्यं च अनृतं च सत्यमभवत् ”satyam cha anRtam cha Satyam > abhavat’ (Taittiriya Up. II.6) Sri Shankaracharya says: satyam = > vyavaharavishayam, since this is being mentioned in the context of > ‘sRishti’ of the world. He adds: this is not paramArthasatyam > (absolute reality) since Brahman alone indeed is paramArtha satyam. > This vyavaharavishayam satyam is only Apekshikam, relative, empirical.



He explains: when compared to the water in a mirage, the water (that we actually use for drinking, etc.) is real. This is what is meant by ‘vyavaharika satyam’.

  
That which is not thus real is anRtam, unreal.

  
सत्यं च व्यवहारविषयम्,अधिकारात्,न परमार्थसत्यम्; एकमेव हि परमार्थसत्यं ब्रह्म । इह पुनः व्यवहारविषयमापेक्षिकं मृगतृष्णिकाद्यनृतापेक्षया उदकादि सत्यमित्युच्यते । अनृतं च तद्विपरीतम् । किं पुनरेतत् सर्वं सत्यमभवत् परमार्थसत्यम् ।

//satyam cha vyavahaaraviShayam, adhikArAt, na paramaarthasatyam; ekameva hi paramaarthasatyam Brahma. iha punaH vyavahaaraviShayamaapekShikam mRgatRShNikAdyanRtaapekShayA udakAdi satyamucyate. anRutam cha tadvipareetam. kim punaretat sarvam satyamabhavat paramArthasatyam…//

The above bhashyam brings to the fore that three types of ‘reality’ are admitted  
in the Shruti. Commonly these are known as: 1.PAramArthika Satyam which is  
Brahman alone, 2. vyAvahArika satyam which constitutes the common world  
experience of samsara and 3. prAtibhAsika satyam which is a seeming reality,  
actually within the samsaaric experience. This seeming reality of say, the  
mirage-water or rope-snake, is corrected in the vyavahara itself and does not  
require Brahma jnanam for this. The vyvahaarika satyam, of course, gets  
corrected upon the rise of Brahma jnAnam. The Shruti vakyams for this are:  
Ekameva adviteeyam, neha naanaa asti kinchana, sarvam khalu idam brahma, etc.  
  

Satyasya satyam: Paramarthika and vyavaharikam – Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2.1.20: सत्यस्य सत्यमिति (प्राणा वै सत्यंतेषामेषसत्यम्) ॥ २० ॥ \[The first satyam in the mantra (in shashThI vibhakti) is vyavaharika and the second satyam (in prathamaa vibhakti) is paramarthika. Same case with what is there within brackets too.  

One can see that the 'satyam' that is vyavaharika is having no svatantra satyatvam; it has to depend for its existence (sattaa) on the Satyam that is Brahman, and hence is paratantra, dependent reality. This is akin to the analogy in the rope-snake where the adhyasta sarpa has no reality of its own; it is said to exist (by the one under bhrama)only on the basis of the rope's existence. He has transferred the rope-existence to the snake that he has superposed in that locus.
