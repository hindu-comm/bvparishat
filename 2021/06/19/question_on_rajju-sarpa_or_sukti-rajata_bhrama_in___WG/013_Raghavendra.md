Greetings of the day,

  
Pointers to श्रुति status of Kārikās coming from Srī Śankara himself,



"मायामात्रमिदं द्वैतमद्वैतं परमार्थतः" /

इति ब्रूते \*श्रुतिः\* साक्षात्सुषुप्तावनुभूयते //

//विवेक-चूडामणिः//४०५//

(This verse is numbered as 406 in few editions)



The above verse captures half hemistich ofGK (17b) and it is referred to as श्रुति. The comment below is from the pen of प्रातःस्मरणीय श्री श्री चन्द्रशेखरभारति स्वामिजि

While introducing the वैतथ्य-प्रकरण, Srī Śankara quotes a part of GK-18b (ज्ञाते द्वैतं न विद्यते) and calls it as आगममात्रं तत्

Srī Ānandagiri Āchārya uses significant expressions viz., आगम-प्रधान and उपपत्ति-प्रधान. The previous प्रकरण isआगम-प्रधान and the one (वैतथ्य-प्रकरण) that is going to be discussed isउपपत्ति-प्रधान.Srī Ānandagiri Āchārya brings texts such as \*ज्ञाते द्वैतं न विद्यते\* and \*यत्र हि द्वैतमिह भवति\* and \*एकमेवाद्वितीयम्\* on the \*same pedestal\* which unmistakably points to theश्रुति status of Kārikās.

Srī Śankara \*repeats\* a similar sense while introducing the अद्वैत-प्रकरण like the way he did while introducing theवैतथ्य-प्रकरण. What is interesting is, Srī Śankara brings the text of the भगवती श्रुती viz., \*प्रपञ्चोपशमः शिवोऽद्वैत\* (prose part of माण्डूकोपनिषद्-१२) andज्ञाते द्वैतं न विद्यते(GK-17b) on the same pedestal by "इति च" remark.

From the above, it becomes clear that Srī Madhva was never alone in treating the 29 verses as part of the श्रुति itself.

  
  
\<\<The Mandukya Upanishad (for Madhva) and Karika for Shankara and Rangaramanuja (who has not commented on all those verses considered as Karikas by Shankara) has this verse: (Vidyaranya and Appayya Dikshitar have considered this section as Upanishad, though):>\>  
  

"It is a matter of great satisfaction to the connoisseurs of उपनिषत्-प्रस्थान that the three आचार्याः are on the same side in looking at those 29 verses as श्रुति. भगवद्रामानुजा treats आप्तकाम text (which is part of those 29 verses) asश्रुति is known".  
  
Thank you and Best regards,
