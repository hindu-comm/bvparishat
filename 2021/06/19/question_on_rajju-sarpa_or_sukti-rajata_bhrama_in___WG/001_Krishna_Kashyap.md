I am almost sure that since Advaita accepts that there is only one entity namely Nirguna Brahman, the system has to posit something like a "rajju sarpa" or sukti-rajata analogy. There is no way around this.

Hence abheda sruti statements such as:

  

sat eva somya idam agra asit ekam eva advitiyam....etc.

  

force the system into accepting such analogies as very valuable in explaining the status of the universe.
