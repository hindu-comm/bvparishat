There are statements such as:

  

sat eva somya idam agra asit ekam eva advitiyam....etc.

  

in the main Upanishads is what you yourself admit.

  

Advaita takes its vivartavaadaas instructed by these Vaakyas.

  

The analogies are used to explain that instruction that they take.

  

If others take it as abhedastutivaakyaand don't use these analogies, that is another position.

  

Those taking such position may think the use of the analogies by the Advaiti side as out of being forced by the Advaiti's position .

  

Similarly, Advaitis may think that not using those analogies by those who considerthem as mere abhedastuti and not as vivartatvopades'ais because of their inability to see the vivartatvopades'ain the shruti as clear as daylight.
