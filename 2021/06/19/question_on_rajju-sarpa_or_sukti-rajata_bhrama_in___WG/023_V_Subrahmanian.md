Three states of Reality in the Taittiriya Upanishad:  

>   
> The mantra सत्यं च अनृतं च सत्यमभवत् ”satyam cha anRtam cha Satyam > abhavat’ (Taittiriya Up. II.6) Sri Shankaracharya says: satyam = > vyavaharavishayam, since this is being mentioned in the context of > ‘sRishti’ of the world. He adds: this is not paramArthasatyam > (absolute reality) since Brahman alone indeed is paramArtha satyam. > This vyavaharavishayam satyam is only Apekshikam, relative, empirical.



He explains: when compared to the water in a mirage, the water (that we actually use for drinking, etc.) is real. This is what is meant by ‘vyavaharika satyam’.

  
That which is not thus real is anRtam, unreal.

  
सत्यं च व्यवहारविषयम्,अधिकारात्,न परमार्थसत्यम्; एकमेव हि परमार्थसत्यं ब्रह्म । इह पुनः व्यवहारविषयमापेक्षिकं मृगतृष्णिकाद्यनृतापेक्षया उदकादि सत्यमित्युच्यते । अनृतं च तद्विपरीतम् । किं पुनरेतत् सर्वं सत्यमभवत् परमार्थसत्यम् ।

//satyam cha vyavahaaraviShayam, adhikArAt, na paramaarthasatyam; ekameva hi paramaarthasatyam Brahma. iha punaH vyavahaaraviShayamaapekShikam mRgatRShNikAdyanRtaapekShayA udakAdi satyamucyate. anRutam cha tadvipareetam. kim punaretat sarvam satyamabhavat paramArthasatyam…//

The above bhashyam brings to the fore that three types of ‘reality’ are admitted  
in the Shruti. Commonly these are known as: 1.PAramArthika Satyam which is  
Brahman alone, 2. vyAvahArika satyam which constitutes the common world  
experience of samsara and 3. prAtibhAsika satyam which is a seeming reality,  
actually within the samsaaric experience. This seeming reality of say, the  
mirage-water or rope-snake, is corrected in the vyavahara itself and does not  
require Brahma jnanam for this. The vyvahaarika satyam, of course, gets  
corrected upon the rise of Brahma jnAnam. The Shruti vakyams for this are:  
Ekameva adviteeyam, neha naanaa asti kinchana, sarvam khalu idam brahma, etc.  
  

Satyasya satyam: Paramarthika and vyavaharikam – Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 2.1.20: सत्यस्य सत्यमिति (प्राणा वै सत्यंतेषामेषसत्यम्) ॥ २० ॥ \[The first satyam in the mantra (in shashThI vibhakti) is vyavaharika and the second satyam (in prathamaa vibhakti) is paramarthika. Same case with what is there within brackets too.  

One can see that the 'satyam' that is vyavaharika is having no svatantra satyatvam; it has to depend for its existence (sattaa) on the Satyam that is Brahman, and hence is paratantra, dependent reality. This is akin to the analogy in the rope-snake where the adhyasta sarpa has no reality of its own; it is said to exist (by the one under bhrama)only on the basis of the rope's existence. He has transferred the rope-existence to the snake that he has superposed in that locus.
