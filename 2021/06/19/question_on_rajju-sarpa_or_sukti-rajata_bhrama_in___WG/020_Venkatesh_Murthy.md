Namaste Krishnaji

  

I think your argument for reality of the pot made from clay is based on Transactions and Utility Value. You do activities like carrying water in the pot and the pot is useful. I don't deny that. I wrote about Vyavaharika Satya and Pratibhasika Satya earlier in this thread. The pot is useful and has Vyavaharika Satya only. This is Relative Truth but not Absolute Truth. Why?

  

Take a person from another culture to visit you. He has not seen any pot before because in his culture they do not use pots. When he sees your pot he will see it is made of clay. Because he will not know its use he will say 'This is Clay only with a form and name'. What has happened? Your pot is viewed as having no reality other than clay. What happened to the transactions you do with pot and its utility? They are Relative Truths because when you change the environment they lose all meaning. They are real only in a particular environment of time and place. Therefore they are Relative Reality or Vyavaharika only.

  

The Upanishad does not explain Rajjusarpafor pot because the Rajjusarpa is PratibhasikaSatya and the pot is Vyavaharika Satya. I have explained this earlier. The main point I want to make is both Vyavaharika and Pratibhasika Satya are not Absolute Reality. The only Absolute Reality is Brahman and everything other than Brahman is not Absolutely real.

  

The Madhvas may have got this idea of Svatantra and Paratantra Satya from this differentiation of Reality. Hari is Svatantra. Everything other than Hari is Paratantra.
