Namaskar Sri Paturi Ji.

  

Please note the context in the upanishad where both the mahavakya and the analogies are stated:

  

\*\*\*this is taken out of Swami Krishnananda'sexplanation: \*\*

  

4.  "Yatha, saumya, ekena mrt-pindena sarvam mrnmayam vijnatam syat
    vacarambhanam vikaro nama-dheyam, mrttikety eva satyam.

"If you know what earth is made of, you also know at the same time what anything that is made of earth also is made of, because all the articles that are manufactured out of earth are constituted of earth essentially. So, I give you an example of how many things can be known by the knowledge of one thing. Pot, tumbler, plate, etc., and various articles****of this kind manufactured out of clay are clay only, in reality. So, if you know what clay is, you know what a clay tumbler is, a clay plate is, a clay glass is, etc. Do you understand what I say? Yes! Because they are only shapes taken by that substance called clay. And, what you mean by an earthen pot is only a name that you have given to a shape taken by the earth.""

*end quoted information.*

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

All it means is:

  

Whatever is the form of the lump of clay, which could be of the form of a pot or "sharava" or any other form (such as a brick or statue), essentially is mud only. *This does not mean that mud is real and pot is unreal.*

It is important to delve deeper into this concept of viva*rta* / parinAma in order to explain how this universe consisting of mud and rocks can be a product of Brahman who is pure consciousness”. During those times, when Buddhist Pundits were a dominant force, Sri SankarAchArya started describing his views pe*rta*ining to creation / causation of the universe, using the phrase “viva*rta*” instead of the term “parinAma”. Viva*rta* means “viruddhatayA va*rta*nam” ie. “The effect exists in an opposing form or in a very different form from the original cause. As said earlier In the sadvidya portion of Chandogya upanishad this classic analogy of a lump of clay is given to explain the material causality of Brahman.

In this analogy, the cause, namely the clay is visible in the effect, namely pot. *Here, the theory of illusion does not fit in. The effect is not any illusory appearance of lump of clay, but it is a particular form of the cause, which is named as pot, due to its shape.*

The instance of clay is just an analogy to Brahman being the material cause of the universe. However, Brahman, who transforms himself into this universe of sentient and insentient, is not visible in this universe, to ordinary people(ajnanis), unlike in the case of the analogy, since clay is visible in the pot. Hence instead of the word parinama, it makes sense to use the term viva*rta*, which means that the effect has attributes that are very different from the cause, namely Brahman. It is also true that the term viva*rta* can be used to denote: parinAma or transformation which is vividha : different in number ie. Or having various forms or variety, or vilakshana : very different, or vichitra : surprisingly different. Actually these two terms viva*rta* and parinAma mean the same thing. As stated earlier, If a cause transforms itself into an effect, which is starkly different, then the term viva*rta* is used. Hence viva*rta* means extreme transformation or extreme parinAma (transformation).

It should be noted that SarvajnAtma muni in his Samkshepa sArIraka (2-61) states - “vyavasthitE asmin parinAmavAdesvayam samAyAti viva*rta* vAdah”, which means, “Once parinAma vAdA is established, automatically the viva*rta*vAda will follow” (indicating that they are not opposing concepts).

It should be noted that Sri Sankaracharya in his commentary on Brahmasutra 2-2-1 (racanAnupattEsca nAnumAnam), states “trigunam pradhAnam svabhAvEnaiva vicitrEna vikAratmanA *vivartate*” in which he uses the word *vivarta*, in the place of the word parinAma. This statement means: “The original causal matter with three gunas (satva, rajas and tamas), by its own nature, transforms itself into different forms”. Here in this section, which is dedicated to the Samkhya theory, primordial matter, which is the cause, transforms into the effect. Here the term parinama is a natural fit, since it is not an extreme transformation. There is no allusion to "illusion".

If it is stated that, Brahman transforms into the universe, then it is a case of extreme transformation, since Brahman is of the form of pure consciousness and the universe does not seem to be made of pure consciousness to the ordinary people. Even here in this section (sutra 2-2-1) per*ta*ining to Samkhya theory, Sri Shankaracharya uses the word viva*rta* to describe it. Hence, these terms are definitely interchangeable. Even vAchaspati mishra agrees with this understanding of this statement. The great literary genius Bhartrhari has used the terms viva*rta* and parinama interchangeably many times in places such as: “eko rasah karuna eva nimitta bhedAt bhinnaha prithak prithak iva Asrayate vivartAn Ava*rta* budbuda taranga mayAn vikAran (uttara rAma charitam - 3-47). This means, “one emotion “mercy” itself due to different reasons takes different forms (vivartAn) like how an ocean transforms itself into its variegated forms such as bubbles and waves”.

*It is enough to state emphatically that, due the fact that it has been used by legendary Sanskrit scholars in their writings, it is clear that the term “vivarta” is a form of “vikara” or “parinama”, which means “transformation”.*

However, the popular meaning ascribed to this term “viva*rta*” by recent writers of advaita philosophy is “appearance of something which does not exist or it is an illusory appearance”. This meaning does not seem to be appropriate and was probably derived by the philosophical writings of post Shankara-Advaitic writers, who were influenced by the Buddhist doctrines of mAdhyamaka school.

Having said this, the strategy of Sri SankarAchArya by using the term *vivarta* instead of parinama, successfully confused the Buddhists since it seemed that Sri SankarAchArya’s views were very close to their philosophy and was agreeable to them, though he firmly upheld the *vEdas*. If the portions of the samanvaya –adhikarana of Sri rAmanuja Bhasya which deal with the “nishprapancIkarana niyOga vAda, dhyAna niyOga vAda and vAkyArthajnAna vAdas are carefully examined, it becomes clear. However, it should be noted that for Ramanujacharya, parinAma vAda is same as vivartvAda according to the rule in “na vilakshanatva adhikarana” of Brahmasutras. In the sutras such as “Atmakrteh”, “parinAmAt”, the term parinAma explained in the *vEdas* seems to be the one which is in accordance with the view of Badarayana, the author of Brahmasutras.

I can provide you with some references which go much deeper into this subject.

the bottomline is: the "sukti rajata bhrama or rajju sarpa bhrama" dont seem to connect will with this section of chandogya where the "tat tvam asi" mahavakya is stated.
