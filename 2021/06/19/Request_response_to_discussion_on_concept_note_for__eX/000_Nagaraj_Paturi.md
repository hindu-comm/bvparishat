I shared the CFP for the conference with a concept note some time ago.

  

<https://www.indicacademy.org/conference-on-hindu-aesthetics-call-for-papers-2/>  

  

I thought some important points were made in that and was waiting for the comments of the learned scholars, enthusiastic students and different members of the forum.

  

May I request the scholars to express their views,

  

come forward to participate in the conference

  

share the CFP among suitable relevant circles

  

and encourage people to send paper proposals for the conference ?
