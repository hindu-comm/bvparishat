Dear friends,

  

From the Indian perspective, time is a continuum. The present contains the past and the future. Thus the Mahabharata and Ramayana are contemporary. In the West History is considered to be discrete. Western history starts from the time man left behind written records.

  

Trying to date the epics itself is allowing the West to dabble with our philosophy of history.

  

I hope Indian Historians look at history more pragmatically rather than treating it like a dead dog.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
