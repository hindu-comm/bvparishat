Respected members,

  

I am pleased to share the concluding part of my blog refuting Nilesh Oak's dating of Ramayana to 12209 BCE. In the last article I showed that there is no evidence in support ofVartak-Oakhypothesis.In this article I explain why itis so.

[Refutation of Nilesh Oakâ€™s Astronomical Dating of the Ramayana to 12209 BCE \| by Dr. Raja Ram Mohan Roy \| Jun, 2021 \| Medium](https://rajarammohanroy.medium.com/refutation-of-nilesh-oaks-astronomical-dating-of-the-ramayana-to-12209-bce-c01364d43c23)  

  

In the series it has been shown that all astronomy poison pills are based on manipulated/manufactured evidence. Further, there is ZERO evidence in Ramayana in support of 12209 BCE. Oak has been asked to make public the exact details of his supposed 575+ corroborations multiple times, but he has failed to provide it. This is against the spirit of scientific inquiry.

  

Best regards,

Raja
