# An interesting TeDex video:

# Unanswered - Mysteries from the Mahabharata \| Christopher Charles Doyle \|



<https://youtu.be/F-nNTGK0wFw> \[ About 18 minutes- Year : 2017 \].



The talk itself is not directly about ‘Mahabharata ! Some may not like the Pyramid connections in this talk, as response comments show.



But any talk of ‘Mahabharata Date’ needs to accommodate some where the ‘engineering feats’ and ‘astronomical calculations’ . Engineering is more solid than ‘Astronomy- Astrology’.

The dots need to be connected across the global civilizations.



**If ‘Engineering’ evidence gets ‘dated firmly’, then the ‘ dates of
‘language and civilization’ who used such ‘engineering feats can be explored.**



And about ‘ Fake verses’… in Mahabharata- Mausala Parva.. something to think deeply in connection with ‘Critical Edition’ and Text-portions/ editions leaning to ‘Spiritual Interpretative Traditions’.
