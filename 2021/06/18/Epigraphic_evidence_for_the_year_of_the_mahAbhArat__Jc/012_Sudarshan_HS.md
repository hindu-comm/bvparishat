नमो विद्वद्भ्यः ।

  

I am looking at these 2 books - the second of which Jayashree ji has mentioned in her article.

  Rice, B. Lewis, (1901)*Epigraphia Carnatica Vol. VII- Inscriptions in the Shimoga District, Part I- Mysore Archaeological Series*

  Rice, B. Lewis, (1902)*Epigraphia Carnatica Vol. VIII- Inscriptions in the Shimoga District, Part II- Mysore Archaeological Series*

  

Interestingly, the above books list **three**copper-plate grants supposedly of Pandava Janamejaya. They are-

1.  Part 1, #45, pp96, Gauja agrahara, Belandur Hobli, Shimoga Dist  
2.  Part 2, #183, pp63, Kuppagadde agrahara, Shimoga Dist 3.  Part 2, #157, pp349, Bhimanakatte Mutt, Shimoga Dist

Jayashree jihas alreadyincluded the screenshot of the **third one** in her article. So I have attached here screenshots of the **first** and **second**.

  

Looking at the content, a few points stand out against expectations:

1.  Lipi îs Nagari & Devanagari! 2.  There is mention of Weekdays in all, Vyatipata in 2nd! 3.  The language switchesfromSamskrtam to Kannada midway in the 2nd
    one!

I therefore looked up what the author had to say about them [in his introduction](https://archive.org/details/dli.granth.93137/page/n16/mode/1up). Screenshot attached.He assigns dates 1192 CE, 1193 CE and 1367 CE respectively to them amidst the "purported date of 3102 BCE".About the 3rd one shown by Jayashree ji, he says -

  

"..It is in देवनागरी characters, but contains the signature "श्री वारह" in comparatively modern Kannada letters ... A comparison with many of the Vijayanagar grants from the same quarter shows so palpably that it is copied from them that no lengthy discussion of the matter is needed.."

  

Adding to the intrigue, I also found that there was a Chalukya king Janamejaya Raya, Son of Parikshita Raya, in the 12th century whose copper plate grants have been found in Karnataka (Chennagiri, Shimoga) and Maharashtra (Chikurde, Sangli) in Nandinagari lipis. The dates and titles need to be compared with this to see if there are any relationship between them & the above supposed Pandava Janamejaya.

  

Thus sharing what I found.
