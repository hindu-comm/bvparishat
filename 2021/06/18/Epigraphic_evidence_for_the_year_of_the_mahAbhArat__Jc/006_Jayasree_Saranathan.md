Sir,

  

For the n-th time I find the same stuff sent to me - now through your name.

  

What does Mr.PVR say?  

  

Read the 'bottomline' - you can use only Drik for 'now', and not those Siddhantas.

But you use Drik and the present lahiri ayanamsa for Mahabharata time!!

It's an approximated value according to him.

  

What is your justification to use it for Mahabharata of 5000 years ago?

  

Is it because the maker of the software said so?

  

Did he say you can use it for Mahabharata that happened 5000 years ago?

  

Even after I pointed out the absurdity it causes, in my previous mail you are writing this. Haven't you read my mail?

  

I request you and the 3067 backers to first learn why ayanamsa is important in determining the planetary longitudes, and how to zero in on a particular siddhanta - ayanamsa for dating a text like Mahabharatha and whether the same Siddhantha - ayanamsa is relevant to date Ramayana. Then only you will be to justify why you use a particular siddhanta-ayanamsa instead of saying Mr. PVR said so.

  

I request you to study and then ask.

  

More than anything else, you have to answer me for the attached pic I sent in my previous mail. If you still want to support 3067 bce, how is it possible that Krishna left in 3102 BCE as stated in that plaque - long before your year Mahabharatha war?

Can't you see the absurdity it causes to your date?

  

Is that plaque at Veraval wrong? Are the Puranas wrong in having said that Kali Yuga started when Krishna left?

  

Think before blindly backing a wrong date and asking me the same stuff I have been writing in the public domain. Let me hope that you don't come up next with 'praaptam Kaliyugam' verse to 'justify' that Kali Yuga started when Duryodhana was killed.

  

Regards,

Jayasree
