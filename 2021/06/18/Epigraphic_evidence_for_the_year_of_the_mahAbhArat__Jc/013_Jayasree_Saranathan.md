Dear Sir,

  

Hope you had read my entire article starting from how grants are re- copied from time to time due to various reasons and how the writing style and the language changes for that reason. As an example if you had gone through the Nadi scripts talking about a time 1000 years ago, the lipi appears as recent as 300 years ago. This is because of regular replacement of palm leaves whose life don't exceed 300 years.

  

Similarly the copper plates have been re-written due to wear and tear and changing boundaries granted by the Daana Patras. But they cannot be done arbitrarily, but under the authority of a king and an assigned officer.

  

The Bhimanakatte grant had existed due to continuous possession. It was checked by Rob. Cole, the superintendent of Inaam settlement. If something was wrong in it he would have confiscated the property.

  

For the other three Daana Patras compared with Vira Nolamba's ( by Lewis Rice) I had shown how the time period of Vira Nolamba can be exactly simulated. It was 445 CE.

  

I suggested that the three Janamejaya grants could have been re-written under the authority of Vira Nolamba to re-affirm the boundaries. If they were issued by Vira Nolamba why should he retain the prasasti of Janamejaya and the reference that they were given by him?

  

Moreover Vira Nolamba's name does not appear anywhere in the grant. Only the officer's name appears at the end pleading for the upkeep of the grant by future kings. This implies that there was a tradition of future kings ratifying the old grants to safe guard the property as and when the need had risen.

  

With the 3 grants exactly getting simulated matching with 3014 BCE where is the scope to assume that they were given Janamejaya of the 12th century?

  

Regards,

Jayasree
