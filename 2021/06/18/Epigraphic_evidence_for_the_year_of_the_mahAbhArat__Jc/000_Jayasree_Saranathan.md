Respected Members,

In continuation of my previous article in the 2-part series on dating Mahabharata War, I am glad to share the link to the 2^(nd) part on “Epigraphic evidence for the year of the Mahābhārata war”

<https://jayasree-saranathan.medium.com/epigraphic-evidence-for-the-year-of-the-mah%C4%81bh%C4%81rata-war-ee00d087cf55>

The 1^(st) part, “Methodology of Research for dating Mahābhārata” can be accessed here <https://jayasree-saranathan.medium.com/the-methodology-of-research-for-dating-mah%C4%81bh%C4%81rata-4844936f4584>

About the 2^(nd) part, inscriptions are the primary sources of evidence in dating the past. The year of the Mahābhārata war can be deduced from the inscriptions of Janamejaya in whose presence Mahābhārata was recited for the first time. Vyāsa, the author also being present at that time, makes the decrees of Janamejaya the first rate primary evidence for dating.

Four copper plate grants issued by Janamejaya found in the district of Shivamogga in Karnataka are seen with time elements such as Śaka year, year name, month, tithi, star and weekday that help us in finding out the date of the grants. Two were given on solar eclipse days. Three of them were given to Brahmins of Shivamogga on the occasion of Sarpa-yāga done by Janamejaya.

One was given to a mutt at Bhimanakatte, presently following Madhvācārya’s philosophy. The donated land was occupied by the Pandavas during their exile. The boundaries of this grant are traceable to R.Thunga in the east, R.Varahi (Pāṣāṇa in the grant) in the west and R.Bhima in the north, now lost. Agastyasrama in the south is no longer seen.

This grant given on a day of eclipse contains the Śaka year (89^(th) Yudhishthira Śaka), the year name (Plavanga) and the Pancāṅga details. They match with each other for the date Nov 2, 3013 BCE in Surya Siddhanta settings of Jhora astrology software and not for any other setting.

This date exactly matches with the beginning of Kali Yuga at Pramathi when Parikshit ascended the throne following the abdication of the throne by the Pandavas upon the departure of Krishna from this world. Though Kali Yuga date is confirmed in many other inscriptions and continues to be followed in India, this grant of Janamejaya comes as a primary evidence for the year of Mahābhārata 35 years before that.

On the same date Janamejaya had issued a grant to Usha Mutt in Kedarnath. He must have handed over that personally when he visited Kedarnath. Both Bhimanakatte and Kedarnath are connected with Bhima. Bhima was said to have built a dam at Thunga, by which the place got the name Vrikodara-Kshetra (inscription), now known as Bhimanakatte.

Closer analysis reveals that the Pandavas had visited the places related to Ramayana in Karnataka and they were identified by Janamejaya who made arrangements for the upkeep of those places. Krishkindha seems to be the seat of Vaali-guhe (Balligavi). From there Bhimnanakatte is only 320 km.

The other three inscriptions found at Begur, Kuppagede and Gauj in Shivamogga district, reveal that the sarpa-yāga was done in the 88^(th) Kali year (Parābhava). Janamejaya gave these grants to the recipients in the 89^(th) Kali year, while on a Dik-vijaya to this region. The dates exactly match with the Kali Era beginning in the year Pramathi in 3101 BCE.

Surprise element is that Begur and Kuppagede (Pushpagade in the grant) were given in Caitra maasa – both Adhika and Nija following each other. This can be simulated only in Surya Siddhanta settings and not in any other settings. This confirms the 7200y cycle of equinoxes and not 26ky of the western astronomy.

The Bhimanakatte grant with the year name (Plavanga) and the Śaka year (89^(th) in Y. Śaka) confirms that Parikshit ascended the throne in 3101 BCE following the departure of Pandavas and Krishna. 35 years before that Mahabharata war was fought, i.e. in 3136 BCE in the year Krodhi.

Looking forward to your valuable feedback.

Regards,

Jayasree Saranathan
