Now I understand where you are coming from Smt Jayasree-ji.

  

A small correction: Pandita Kota Venkatachalam Pakayaji garu is 1885-1959( <http://mahabharatascience.blogspot.com/p/kota-venkatachalam.html>.) Not a recent author of 1991.

  

I have been a teacher and a great fan of modern classicist colossal Telugu poet and author late KavisamratViswanatha Satyanarayana garu, who as a nationalist historian himself and a nationalist historical novelist was a follower of Pandita Kota Venkatachalam garu. Introduced to him by our Viswanatha varu, we too read Kota garu passionately.

  

Thats a small digression.

  

Please carry on with your discussion.
