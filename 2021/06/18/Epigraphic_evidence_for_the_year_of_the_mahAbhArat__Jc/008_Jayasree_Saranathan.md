Dear Sir,

  

I don't know when that plaque was installed, but the date is the basis for the time scale used in our country till date.

Hope you have read my recent article Iposted here that gives an overall view of this time scale.

<https://jayasree-saranathan.medium.com/epigraphic-evidence-for-the-year-of-the-mah%C4%81bh%C4%81rata-war-ee00d087cf55>

  

In fact 3101 BCE is the actual date forming the basis for the time computation used by Hindus.

3102 BCE was given by Burgess using the Julian days of the US Nautical Almanac Office and converting them into the Julian date in the calendar.The Julian day is not of the same length as the Sidereal day used for calculating the lengthof the year in the Indic system. So the discrepancy arises.

  

Traditionallywe have been calculating the sidereal days which gives the correspondingdate in the Gregorian calendar as 3101 BCE.

You may be aware that this calculation is part of astrology and Pancanga making. The formula traces time from the beginning of Kali Yuga that was 3179 years before Shalivahana Shaka. That year is 3101 BCE. The continuity of this date is such that even if it is altered by a day, today cannot be what it is, i.e. Sunday (weekday)

  

This year (3101 BCE) is repeatedly establishedby several inscriptions.

Even though the British introduced the Gregorian calendar in India, Indians were using this olden Kali-Shaka calendar for all purposes.

Only after the Indian Independence this was gradually lost, but continuesto be used in all temples, mutts, by religious and traditional people.

Even as recently as 1991, Pandit Kota Venktachelam used this time scale to give the date of his book "Age of the Mahabharata War '' (see attachment). This time scale must be brought into regularuse by all of us.  

  

By-passing this year 3101 BCE, Mahbaharatacannot be dated.

  

On seeing the questioner (Mr V) not equipped with this knowledgeessential for dating, and not having read my article in which I had established the date (3101 BCE) by epigraphic evidence, I cited the plaque to show him how this date upsets the year he supports for the Mahabharata war.

  

That plaque should be corrected to 3101 BCE.

Hope that happens soon.

  

Regards,

Jayasree
