Dear Sir,

  

Glad to know your passion for the works of the great scholar, Pandit Kota Venkarachelam. We are in the same boat :)

  

Showed the date part from his book, a later edition.

  

Really good the later publishers had stuck to the traditional time.

Most books in Tamil published till 1950 carried the traditional date only.

  

GOI follows Shaka date and not kali date. There is no Shalivahana Shaka without Kali Yuga.

Hope Kali date also is included in GOI calender.

  

It's my fervent hope this esteemed group takes up this time scale as one of its goals for the revival of the traditional date scheme.

  

Forgetting of this date is the cause for different dates of Mahabharatha.

  

Regards,

Jayasree
