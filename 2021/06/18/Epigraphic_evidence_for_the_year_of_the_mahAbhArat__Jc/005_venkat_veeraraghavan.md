Madam,

  

Thank you for your response.

  

I post below what Narasimha wrote about SS:

  

(<https://www.facebook.com/710143283/posts/10157293261003284/?d=n>)  
Though Maharshi Parasara recommended to compute planetary positions based on observation (Drik siddhanta), some astrologers compute them based on formulas given in Surya Siddhanta. Please note that there are MANY siddhantas and they give DIFFERENT formulas. Examples are Surya Siddhanta, Soma Siddhanta, Brahma Siddhanta, Vasishtha Siddhanta, Maha Siddhanta etc. If one of them is \*perfect\*, why did sages care to provide others???  
Though this TRUTH may offend blind followers of a various siddhantas, the bottomline is that there is nothing sacrosanct about the formulas given in any of these texts. They are all APPROXIMATIONS of observations made at their times.  
Instead of making observations everytime we need planetary positions, it is useful to make a few observations and then find a formulaic representation that is close enough.  
However, the formula may be a decent approximation in a particular time period and the error in the formula may increase with time. To address that issue, one can also give a formula that has parameters (beejas) instead of all fixed values. One can make fresh observations from time to time and adjust the parameters for better accuracy.  
For example, see the formula in the illustration. The values of a, b, c and d are 3, 2, 4 and 1. After 1,000 years, perhaps 3 1/16, 1 3/4, 4 1/8 and 1 1/32 may work better! One can determine those based on fresh observations.  
Unfortunately, some astrologers use ancient formulas as is and that gives too much error. Some adjust the beejas based on a predetermined time-based formula (instead of using fresh observations) and that is not good enough either.  
This is the bottomline: When we have accurate measurements from telescopes and computing power of modern computers to perform sophisticated extrapolations, old siddhantas are of no relevance. One is really better off using Drik siddhanta (i.e. calculations based on observations). Just to reiterate, that is what Maharshi Parasara explicitly recommended!  
PS: Though my free Jyotish software "Jagannatha Hora" provides an option to use Surya Siddhanta instead of Drik siddhanta, it is just for those who want to experiment and play around. I strongly discourage everyone from using it for actual astrological analysis. I have tried it for 2 years and realized that it is only an approximation. Please don't waste time on it.
