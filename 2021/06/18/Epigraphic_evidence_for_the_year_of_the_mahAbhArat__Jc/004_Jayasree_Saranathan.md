Dear Sir,

  

I am not sure whetherthis is the platform to discuss this.

Since you have asked, I am replying here.

  

First thing first - even a school student knows that if a date doesn't match with the well established date, it is rejected outright. The date that you stick on to does not match with the departure of Krishna in 3101 BCE (or 3102 BCE). Even if one has no religiousknowledge, as a visitor to Veraval, one can see the plaque informing when Krishna left. (see the attached pic). If you still want to stick to your date (3067 BCE), firstdisprove the date of departure of Krishna in 3101 BCE when the Kali Yuga started - supported by numerous inscriptions. Disprove the information linking Krishna's departure to the beginning of Kali yuga given in Hari Vamsam, Srimad Bhagavatam, Vishnu Purana, Brahma Purana and Matsya Purana.

  

Coming to your comments,

# For the choice of a particular ayanamsa, the researcher should give thejustification - and I have given; that is not the job of the creator of Jhora. In an irony of sorts 3067 backers justify Lahiri ayanamsa for the Mahabharata date because the creator of the simulator had said so!!! Even after I have shown how Lahiri ayanamsa is showing Adhika masa in theimpossible location ofperihelion (Magha month) youcontinue to use it. (Read here: <https://jayasreesaranathan.blogspot.com/2021/03/limitations-of-astronomy-simulators-for.html> ) No one in theknowofthingswould care to even look at these derivations!

  

# The proof of the pudding is in eating. The proof of Surya Siddhanta (SS) ayanasmais in the perfect simulationof Kali Yuga, Mahabharata year and all the planetary combinationsof the year and additionally the inscriptions of Janamejaya that I have established. The SS works perfectly for zero degree ayanamsa. To understand this one must know the concept of ayansma and its application. I have written extensively on it, and even publisheda 5-part paper in The Astrological Magazine founded by Dr.B.V.Raman and vetted by a team of astrologers. (Here: <https://www.academia.edu/47853142/Siddhantic_Concept_of_Precession_of_Equinoxes_New_Revelations> ) You have not read them. Without those basics on ayanamsa one cannot even attempt to locate the planetary positions 5000 years ago. These are all the basic qualifiers for research.

  

# Jhora SS might show amavasya for your date onthe 14th day. I got it right. Check here: <https://jayasreesaranathan.blogspot.com/2021/01/a-mimicked-solar-eclipse-on-14th-day.html>

I even got the Solar eclipse on the 19th day of the war, but 3067 backers didn't even know that the mace fight took place on the 19th day, not on the 18th day.

  

# I have validated the traditionaldate of Mahabharata in the 12th chapter of my 2019 ebook refuting Mr Oak's date. Now I have made it free. You can download it here toread my rebuttals to Mr Oak's book on Mahabharata dating:<https://www.academia.edu/44757153/Myth_of_The_Epoch_of_Arundhati_of_Nilesh_Nilkanth_Oak>

  

Or you can start reading my updated version with a supplementary series on ayanamsa, Kali Yuga etc., and the justification for the Early Harappan as the post Mahabharat settlement of Satyaki-s on the banks of the river Saraswati. Kritavarma at Mehrgarhwhile the Saindhavas continued in the vast Sindhu region. Maybe you can start here and go forward or backward by clicking the links to read the entire series: <https://jayasreesaranathan.blogspot.com/2021/01/from-mehrgarh-to-saraswati-dwarka.html>

  

Dating of Mahabharata is not a simulator-play or an entertainmentjudged by TRP ratings. It requires basic foundational knowledge to even understand the inputs for dating and to get clarity. This would run into 100s of pages and cannot be just 'talked out' in shows. Let people get this basic understanding.

  

Regards,

Jayasree
