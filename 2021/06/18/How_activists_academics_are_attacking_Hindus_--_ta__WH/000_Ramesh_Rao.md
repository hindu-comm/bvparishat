Learned folks,

  

We at India Facts have organized a talk and a Q & A session with Suhag Shukla, Executive Director, Hindu American Foundation on June 26th -- at a convenient time for Indian, European, and American audiences (though people on the West Coast may find it a little early for a Saturday morning engagement).

  

Please join us. Registration details are here:
