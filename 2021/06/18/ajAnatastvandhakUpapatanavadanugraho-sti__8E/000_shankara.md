Namo vidvadbhyah!

  

Haradattacharya in his commentary on Gautama Dharmasutra 12.14, gives the example of a man unknowingly falling into a well - अजानतस्त्वन्धकूपपतनवदनुग्रहोऽस्ति. I am unable to understand how can falling into a well be considered a blessing, whether one falls into the well knowingly or not.  

  

Request scholars to kindly resolve my doubt.

regards  
shankara
