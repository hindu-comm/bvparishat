As a contemporary note, one may observe how the "uneducated condition, poverty etc."  

of Muslims are as a rule invoked in the context of their involvement in terrorism  

\- all in order to stir our noble instincts, so we could be expected to show pity and mercy

upon the poor fellas (and even lend a helping hand via donations etc for their "upliftment");  

the reality quite to the contrary being that Bin Laden himself was an engineer,

and the son of a millionare. Hundreds of "educated" and affluent guys among them are involved;

and in fact, the more educated they are the more sophisticated is their *al-taqiyya*.
