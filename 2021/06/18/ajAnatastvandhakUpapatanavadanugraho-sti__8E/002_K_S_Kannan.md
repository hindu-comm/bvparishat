The word *anugraha* here is no "blessing".

It only means leniency, concession, and commiseration.

  

Ignorance is fully excused in extreme cases. It envisages cases perhaps like this:

An ignorant person committing a blunder sometimes suffers in the course of the action,

like say, falling down, and is pained by it. That is punishment enough, in a way  

(or even more than what he deserved). Condonation, coupled with a warning  

(right then, or better, in course of time), say, is enough there.

  

The word *anugraha* in such contexts ought to be taken to mean

condonation/concession/commiseration.

  

(Maskarin in his commentary on the *sūtra* says that  

the *sūtra* applies to stealing alone (and not any *sāhasa* in general)).  

  

This is my understanding. Hope this helps a bit.
