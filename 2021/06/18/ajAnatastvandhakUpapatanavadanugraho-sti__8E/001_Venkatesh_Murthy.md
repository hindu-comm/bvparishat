Namaste  

  

It means the punishment for a man with knowledge of the sin is greater. If a man does not have knowledge of the sin and commits it he will not be punished so much. Because his fault is less. Like a man without knowing there is a well and falls into it will be rescued by someone.

  

Take an educated person and an illiterate person. If the educated person reads a sign to not dump trash and still dumps it his fault will be more. The illiterate man can say he did not know the prohibition.
