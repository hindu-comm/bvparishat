*anugraha* here is margin/consideration/even help.

  

*anugraha* in its milder sense can be taken as "absence of *nigraha*",

and in its stronger sense as "positive help offered voluntarily/generously (even profusely)"

\- as in the case of a child running behind a ball and getting run over by a vehicle

where the driver was not at all at fault, as he just could just not expect the child,  

and indeed did his best to avoid the child; in fact, even strangers rush to *help the child*,  

and even go out of their way to do so investing their precious time/money/energy/effort:  

a veritable *anugraha* - and for one at fault! People around do try to rescue the blind man falling into a well,

and lend him a helping hand. (The analogy comes handy in the famous verse:

*andhasya me... mama dehi karāvalambam*).  

  

The Legal Maxim expresses its helplessness when it says:

***Ignorantia juris neminem excusat***

or

***Ignorantia legis neminem excusat:***

"Ignorance of law is no excuse".

Also Cf. ***nemo censetur ignorare legem***  

(nobody is thought to be ignorant of the law)  

or  

***ignorantia iuris nocet***  

(not knowing the law is harmful).  

  

There are further expatiations which say:

"While ignorance of facts may be excused, ignorance of law cannot be.";

and further that, "While even lawyers (and sometimes even the police)  

may not be expected to be conversant with *every* law in force,

this maxim is essentially to act as a deterrent to those who commit offenses wilfully,

pretending/claiming ignorance of the law".

  

It is said that "Ignorance of the law is no excuse," first shows up in the Bible in Leviticus 5:17:  

"If a person sins and does what is forbidden in any of the Lord's commands,  

*even though he does not know it,* he is guilty and will be held responsible."  

The genesis of the cruelty and ruthlessness of the Abrahamic faiths obtains here.  

  

The greater sensibility and humanity (humanitarian consideration) in the *dharma-śāstra*-s  

(as against the Bible) becomes evident in this (and such) context :

Justice must be tempered by mercy - *where licit and where due* - after all.  

  

Combine this now also with the dictum of Manu in his definition of *bāla*:

"*ajño bhavati vai bālaḥ*" - "the ignorant is \[practically to be treated\] as a child".

  

The burden of *Kaṭhopaniṣad* is ultimately contrasting the *bāla* and the *dhīra*

(or what is the same, *bāla* and *paṇḍita*) at a spiritual level, though:

*"parācaḥ kāmān anuyanti **bālāḥ**" *&*  
*

*"kaścid **dhīrah** pratyagātmānam aikṣat".  
*

*  
*

The Gītā provides a contrast where Arjuna had to be chastised for his

*asthāna-sneha-kāruṇya*- etc. - misplaced compassion and comradery.  

Kr̥ṣṇa had to admonish Arjuna to stop first pretending that he is knowledgeable:  

*prajñāvādaṁśca bhāṣase*;  

*nānuśocanti paṇḍitāḥ* etc.

  

Sorry for the prolixity.
