**Anyway I am not a scholar and I just stated from my lifelong experience and observation.**

**My arena is law and taxation. Not religious practices**

  

\>\>\>Dear Shri Ananthanarayanan

  

Thank you for your clarification which should have been thefirst and only sentence in your reply.

  

The gentleman you are arguing with is a subject matter expert in these areas apart from having done full adhyayana.

He has clearly written that what he has said is APADH-DHARMA.

  

Which part of this is hard to understand?

  

What you or I have been doing ALL THESE YEARS is irrelevant given the current context of corona lockdowns and social segregation.

  

Please understand that what is happening now has not happened in either of our lifetimes and needs to be treated as such - AN EXCEPTION.

  

Regards,

  

V
