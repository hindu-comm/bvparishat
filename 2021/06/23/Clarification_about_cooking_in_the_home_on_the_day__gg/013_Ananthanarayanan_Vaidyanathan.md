You are asking for pramanams etc for shistacharam. The question was regarding cooking food at the deceased premise and not about taking food.

I know there is a practice in my own sect that cooking is not done in the house in the day when the body lies or is taken for cremation and either relatives who are not covered by ashaucham or not close mourners supply cooked food.

There is no rule that the relative should fast or starve even in the presence of the dead body.

And I know it is just meaningless tointeract with vidvans especially who are too sure about themselves and think what they state amount to pramanam.

You stated yourself that one cannot ask for texts for local practices and now you ask for pramanam on this.

This seems to be group where you can assert anything and others have to accept it as pramanam. This world is too big, far bigger than this Google group.

I rest my argument here.

I regret that I tried to clarify.

तत्र एव वकव्यं यत्रोक्तं सफलं भवेत्

Anyway I am not a scholar and I just stated from my lifelong experience and observation.

My arena is law and taxation. Not religious practices
