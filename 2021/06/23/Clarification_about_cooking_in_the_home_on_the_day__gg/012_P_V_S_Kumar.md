For pramanam / shaastra evidence, you may refer to धर्मसिन्धुः (available in Archive.org). There various conditions - based on the relationship with the deceased, age of the deceased, varna of the family, etc. have been dealt with in detail.

  

In towns and villages, relatives or people in the neighborhood provide food during the अशौच days. But in cities it may not be happening. Vid Korada ji has already provided the workarounds that are being followed where other options are not available. We can consider them as local sampradayas in the current days.
