Dear Sri Ananthanarayanan Vaidyanathan,

  

On an earlier occasion also you sent a message accusing the entire group.

  

I rejected the message for that reason.

  

Again , you are doing the same in this message.

  

I allowed to show your attitude to the group while holding mirror to you.

  

You are not forced to continue in the group against which you make such accusations. You are free to unsubscribe.

  

If your attitude continues to be the same and are not able to unsubscribe, I will help you by removing you from the group.
