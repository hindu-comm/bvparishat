One has the option of surviving on fruits ofcourse.

In these times try using an electric cooker and/or convection stove if you have one.

  

With fruits and these options one should be able to manage.

I am no scholar or expert in this but based on previous experience in my household, depending on the diseased'srelationship to oneself asoucha kala (1 day 3 days ....etc) is determined.

  

So firstly you will have to clarify the relationship of the diseased to determine how long and for whom the asoucha holds. The other issues can be decided downstream from there.

  

Sincere advisego by whatever your kula-pandit/purohitaadvises.
