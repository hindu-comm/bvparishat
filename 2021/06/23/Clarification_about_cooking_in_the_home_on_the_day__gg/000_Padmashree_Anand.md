Namaste

I humbly request the esteemed scholars in this group to kindly clarify the doubt.

If cremation is over by 1 pm, can food be cooked on that day in the house? Is this applicable even today? Is this just a sampradaaya or shaastra evidence is available? What should one do if there is no one else to bring and give food?

Thanks and regards

Padmashree Anand
