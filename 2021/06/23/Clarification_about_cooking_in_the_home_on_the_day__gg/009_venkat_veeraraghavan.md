Dear Shri Korada Garu,

  

 *If no one else is there -- after cremation by अपराह्ण ,* the कर्ता
would return , light a lamp , cook the food and consume ( if anyone is there he/she would light the lamp and the कर्ता would look at the दीप and then only would have the food) . This क्रिया , lighting the lamp (looking at it ) and having the food to be performed everyday for twelve days (ब्राह्मणाः ) .  

  

\>\>Am I right in assuming that this is the aapad-dharma you suggest for this context and not a general rule?

  

Many thanks for your explicit instructions.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
