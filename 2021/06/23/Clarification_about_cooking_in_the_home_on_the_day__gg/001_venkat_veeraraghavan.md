Interesting question and very pertinent in these times.

  

My limited understanding is asfollows: agni karya/lamps of any sort/ cooking fire etc. are avoided during the period of asoucha because it is believed that the astral body of the diseased isattracted to the flame and this prevents the onward progress of the soul encased in the astral sheath.

  

In olden days the cooking fire was lit from the tretaagni, but with gas and convection stoves being used nowadays, I am not sure how this translates in application.

As usual there is likely to be some aapad-dharma for times like these.
