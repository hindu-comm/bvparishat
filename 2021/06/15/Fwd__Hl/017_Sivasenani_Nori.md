I do have one question. What is the basis for deciding that the word मौढ्ये in the varttika is a later addition? I mean I understand the reasoning offered, but do we have textual evidence to support this theory?

  

If we suppose that the word was not an addition everything is still explicable. There are exceptions and counter-exceptions seen elsewhere amongst varttikas and Patanjali does not comment on every varttika. Also there is a near continuous usage to the effect that the word means mUrkha, apart from the general principle that lack of sup-lopa indicates censure. It does seem that reasoning started with a conclusion that Ashoka is right and that everything else needs to be explained away.
