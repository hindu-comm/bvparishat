Yes, this indeed is very reasonable. That is why it requires to be 'explained'. Let us let that be for now and examine the other side.

  

1\. We have Katyayana, Patanjali, Sabara, Sankara, Abhinavagupta, Mammata, Kaiyyata, Ramachandra, Bhattoji Dikshita, Nagesa etc. asserting that it means mUrkha. These are venerated scholars spanning a couple of millenia.

2\. The sanatanis reaction to non-sanatanis was not of ridicule or bad-mouthing: they simply ignored them. So, why only in the case of Ashoka would they start ridiculing him? Also, even if we got the dates of Ashoka and Patanjali right, most likely those from Sabara onwards are not even aware of Ashoka. The Ashokan pillars were called the pillars established by Pandavas till some 200 years ago - so completely erased from the Indian memory was Ashoka.

3\. These authors were great scholars, the very best and masters of Sabda. They definitely had the intelligence to discern a sarcastic usage from a non-sarcastic usage. Otherwise we would not be studying them centuries later. At one time (and even now there are places where) there was (is) a fashion, and one could make one's career by denigrating traditional scholars. This could be borne out of a superiority complex of being white-skinned, or from the admiration of such persons. Hopefully times have changed and we can evaluate evidence objectively and make reasonable speculation unlike, say, Johannes Bronkhorst, who speculates that Punyaraja (commentator of Vakyapadiya) was not familiar with Sankhya and the tanmatras of Sankhya!

4\. With an unbiased examination, or at any rate an equally plausible alternative would be that, the things that would be 'explained' away are Ashoka's usage, Patanjali's inclusion of term in the bhavadAdi gaNa, bANa's usage of the term and YaSomitra's assertion to both shades of meaning.

  

I do not have a ready answer to the issues raised in 4 above, but I do see some possibilities, in the case of Ashoka. As to others, we can think of some explanations without borrowing from the toolkit of tradition-denigrators (inclusion in bhavadAdi gaNa was a mistake, if not a clever ploy, of Kielhorn, who even portrayed Patanjali as being opposed to Katyayana etc.).

  

First, Ashoka's act of engraving his edicts on rocks and pillars was a radical departure from the then fashion. It is a bit like emitting radio signals into outer space for aliens in our times. We really do not know how good their grammar is. Learned people are distant from such radical activities. I can imagine a conversation, where Devadatta is telling Yajnadatta: "We have effortlessly committed to memory the Veda, Vedangas, Itihasas etc. running into lakhs of granthas and here the king is committing to stone a few granthas as if they cannot be memorized. Kings!"

  

Secondly, power and prestige do not mean that language is used correctly. We have seen Presidents Bush and Trump maul English. Recently another celebrity Serena Williams declared '[I am thick](https://www.business-standard.com/article/sports/serena-williams-says-dealing-with-media-scrutiny-made-her-stronger-121060100208_1.html)' (which means 'I am stupid') when she meant to say 'I am thick-skinned'. In AP / Telangana famous cinema stars, with stature rivalling that of Chief Ministers, mis-spell their names as वेंकटे**ष्,** महे**ष्** etc. Basically these powerful people do not care enough and those who do know language well do not want to point out the error to their face and earn their ire.

  

Thirdly, Ashoka's language does not conform to classical usages. From his edicts, we have at least two other examples: पाषण्डः (he meant a learned person, whereas other known usages mean a heretic, when charitable and a knave, otherwise) and ब्राह्मणश्रमणाः (it ought to be ब्राह्मणश्रमणम्). A closer examination of his Pali and Greek might yield more specimens. AT the least, this does point towards a certain divergence. So would it be possible that Ashoka might have taken a fancy to this name as a youngster and then drunk with power refused to be corrected?

  

At this stage, I would rather treat it as an open question, and till a strong plausible explanation is available go with the tradition of Sabara, Sankara, Abhinavagupta, Mammata, Kaiyyata, Bhattojidikshita and Nagesa.
