नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

The photo of ब्रह्मश्री दण्डिभट्ल विश्वनाथशास्त्रि , a Vedic scholar
from Rajamahendravaram ( Andhra Pradesh , South India) is seen hanging
on the wall of the University of Frankfurt , Germany .

  

Adolf Hitler and others believed that there is good (Missile) Technology embedded in Vedic Literature . The Secretservice (SS?) was pressed into action and they traced शास्त्रि (and others) . He was taken to Germany

for Rs 300/- per month . After his death his wife was receiving Rs 70/- - she was made to infer her husband'sdeath by the reduced amount .

शास्त्रि was taught German and the Nazis got the यजुर्वेद translated into their language and certainly used in building Missiles etc. ..

Some fifty years ago I used to hear some discussions regarding some
Vedic scholars who were taken by Germans and none of them returned but even during the war their wives were receiving money from Germany .

  

The letters on the link read -- the Telugu Pandit who gave Missile Technology to Germany and the narration is also in Telugu .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
