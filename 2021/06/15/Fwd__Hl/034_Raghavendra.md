Greetings of the day,  
  
देवानांप्रियः is an example of अलुक्-समास which may have originally meant as "beloved of gods",  
  
Have heard that the termदेवानांप्रियः as an epithet was given to "Emperor Ashoka" and it appears to have been inscribed in the monuments,  
  
Orthodox section of the society then started using it in the sense of a 'fool' out of jealousy,  
  
Is this true? Historians on the group are requested to throw light on it,  
  
Thank you and Best regards,

Namaste



May be an amended statement on the following helps to be more clear:



***Given***: No tradition is hurt by accepting that the word was originally used in good faith and later, due to some reasons, was overcome by negative sense. Surely we know many Sanskrit words whose meanings changed with time.



***Suggested Amendment***: Samskruth- Language-Tradition is hurt by accepting that the ‘word’ which was originally used in a ‘ specific meaning’ using a standard processing and in good faith; and later, due to ‘ obvious reasons’ was overcome by interpreted senses , which could yield negative sense. Surely we know many Sanskrit words whose meanings have changed with time and ‘ conscious purposive newer constructions and meaning overloads with time.
