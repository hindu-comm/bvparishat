Dear Shri Korada Garu,

  

Thank you for the account from the long and still simmering past.

  

I also was sent that link by Shri Ken who seems very actively helpful behind the scenes on BVP.

  

I do not know what to think. It is possible that vedic scholars were taken there etc.

Until we gain access to the exact copper plates that were transported to Germany it is hard to conclude that the pulse jet engine designs were copied from here.

  

Itis also extremely synchronistic that Leibnitz and Newton both "discovered" calculus around the same time.

Was this synchronicity or a race between two colonial thieves (with missionaries as front)

who transported palm leaf manuscripts from Kerala we will probably never know for sure.

  

There is a history of thievery in anglo-saxon scientific and mathematical endeavour since Newton took credit for Raphsons's results.

So extending the same successful "process" is not unimaginable.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
