If that were the only conclusion, it is indeed acceptable,and that is what ismeant by saying the questionis open ('due to some reasons'). Following are what are not acceptable:  
  
a) Based on our speculation we conclude that there was an amendment in the varttika, carried out by an ancient scholar (that is why I was asking for evidence for the same)

b\) Traditional scholars did not appreciate that a particular usage was sarcastic and therefore very naively started attributing a negative sense to the word

  

and others of such nature, which explain the divergence by attributing motives, or uncharitable or naive acts to Hindu tradition.
