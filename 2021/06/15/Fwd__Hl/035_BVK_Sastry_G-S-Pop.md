Namaste



The responses across different posts are somehow not getting a convergent consistent communication on ‘ Meaning firming and Fixation of Word- Meaning (claimed to belong to Language Class: Samskrutham).



We seem to have a clear identified need to bridge to build, keeping focus on ‘Samskruth word- Morphology and Semantics in Shaastra – works’.
My earlier request for help on the issue remains answered partially.

***I resubmit the original request***: Do we have an all ‘acharya- common concurrent definitional understanding’ of the term ‘**शास्त्रं’
in the deliberation of ‘**शास्त्रैक्यम्’ ?



**Why ‘ resubmit the question’ ? -the points for further detailing**: 



Traditional Scholars prefer ‘Vyakarana-Sampradaya (word Morphology/ word –form generation) preferred pedagogy to get ‘ One-ness, Common-ness, Convergence’ conclusions. Does this satisfy the delight of criterion of
\< एवं प्रमाणतर्काभिमतैरेव "स्व-पर-पक्ष-साधनोपालम्भाभ्यां" वादे निर्णयपर्यन्तं तत्वनिर्णयाय प्रयतेरन् \> constricted to \< एवं "स्व-पक्ष-साधनोपालम्भाभ्यां" वादे निर्णयपर्यन्तं प्रयतेरन् \> ?



If there has been a common concurrent definitional convergence, how is it that ‘ word- meanings keep giving pluri-valent, context constrained interpretation ? Be it the Samskruth term : दे॒वा॒ना॒म्प्रि॒य or **शास्त्र ? **. Is there a second instance of tolerating a historic
emperor status personality smeared with ‘foolishness’ and still be a National Icon whose inscriptions are history anchors ? and history re-narration in present period ?



*What is the help -request for ? *: (1) Why Nirukta ( semantics) perspective of ‘Vedanga – Vak-Yoga - Paddhati’ and ‘Paribhshaa’ technicality of Vyakarana pushed back in these explanations ? (2) Why is there a preference to embrace a ‘colonial line of pedagogy’ and a welcome embrace of ‘Social Language dynamics’ to explain text- terms- tradition of Spiritual orientation?



Resource I have used to raise the questions \[ posts on BVP\]:

A) Discussion thread related to दे॒वा॒ना॒म्प्रि॒य : \[दे॒वा॒ना॒म्प्रि॒य इत्य॒स्य पू॒र्व्यः प्राकृ॒तोऽर्थः॑ शोभ॒नस्तत॑श्च॒ कैश्चि॒द्योगै॑रर्थान्त॒रेणाक्रा॑न्तो॒ऽ॒यं शब्द॒ इत्य॒स्य व॑च॒नस्या॑नु॒मोद॑नेन॒ न कोऽपि॑ सम्प्रदा॒यो दू॑ष्यते। न खल्व॑नार॒म्भं सर्वं॑ संस्कृतशब्दार्थजा॒तमिति॑ विदि॒तमे॒वास्माक॑म्। -No tradition is hurt by accepting that the word was originally used in good faith and later, due to some reasons, was overcome by negative sense. Surely we know many Sanskrit words whose meanings changed with time. \] Why was ‘Emperor Ashoka’ to be socially presented from the original intended ‘प्राकृ॒तोऽर्थः॑ शोभ॒न: ‘ to the new social meaning of ‘तत॑श्च॒
कैश्चि॒द्योगै॑रर्थान्त॒रेणाक्रा॑न्तो॒ऽ॒यं शब्द॒: ‘ ? Did Samskrutham suffer the same cycles of ‘ Social Language Usage Meaning Degeneration-shifts in tradition?



B) Discussion thread related to **‘**शास्त्रैक्यम्’ : \< Āchārya Madhva has given the following definition of the technical term "śāstram" in his braḥmasūtra-bhāshya based on the evidence of skānda vachana, - "R^igyajuHsAmAtharvAshcha bhArataM paNcharAtrakam.h \|mUlarAmAyaNaM chaiva **shAstramityabhidhIyate** \|\| **yachchAnukUlametasya tachcha shAstraM prakIrtitam.h** \| ato.anyo granthavistAro naiva shAstraM kuvartma tat.h \|\|" ---- **shAstraM yoniH pramANAsyeti shAstrayoni **\|\| ---- Āchārya Madhva has the above definitionin mind ***even while interpreting******शास्त्रविधिमुत्सृज्य**in the context of the Gītā***. उत्सृज्य according to Āchārya Madhva means not giving up the Vedas because they are invalid which the phrase शास्त्रविधिमुत्सृज्य****superficially appears to lend such a meaning, but it means, according to him, disowning the Vedas by eligible ones despite having the capacity to learn and assimilate them **(सानूनबुद्धीन्).** Āchārya Madhva is consistent across his writings with the above meaning of the technical term śāstram.> .



*I am placing one more word in this context to point out the seriousness of the issue.*

 The term is ‘कुरु ‘ . Known traditional meaning is a historical land in Bharath, a community –identifier like madra, panchala, a verb-form in grammar.

Illustration for meaning analysis is from Vakyapadiya (3-7-4) -
बुद्ध्या समीहितैकत्वान् पञ्चालान् कुरुभिर् यदा - पुनर् विभजते वक्ता तदापायः प्रतीयते ॥वाक्य\_3, 7.4.

The commentators context has an allusion to ‘ Mahabharata text’ of viewing the 105 members of Kuru family as \[ One\] or \[ 100 Kauravas and 5 Pandavas\].

The new meaning of ‘कुरु ‘ is ‘Disease’ : [Kuru (disease) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuru_(disease))-
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuru_(disease)>

**Kuru**is a rare,[incurable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incurable "Incurable")and fatal[neurodegenerative disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder)that was formerly common among the[Fore people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fore_people "Fore people")of[Papua New Guinea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea "Papua New Guinea"). Kuru is a form of[transmissible spongiform encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmissible_spongiform_encephalopathy "Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease")(TSE) caused by the transmission of abnormally folded proteins ([prions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prion "Prion")), which leads to symptoms such as tremors and loss of coordination from[neurodegeneration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration)..



The ingenuity and academic freedom to interpret the term meaning in a new context –flavour cannot be avoided. In kannada \[ local Indian Language\], ‘kuru’ means a ‘boil’ read to burst out, pointing to a health condition.



Thanks in advance for the help.
