नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

The following facts are from an आर्य / श्रोत्रिय and almost all of them are as per शब्दप्रमाणम् --

  

1\. During 1938 or so some वेदशास्त्रपण्डिताः were lured , by offering large amount of money , by Adolf Hitler's agents , from the District of East Godavari , Andhra Pradesh , South India and got the Vedic Texts translated into

Deutsch / German , after teaching them the target language . It is believed that such scholars either died a natural death or were thrown into the waters of high seas after picking them up on the pretext of dropping home .

I learnt this from elderly people of Modekurru , a village in the same district , where I learnt व्याकरणम् (कीर्तिशेषः कोंपेल्ल सुब्बरायशास्त्री ) and वेदान्त (कीर्तिशेषः राणी नरसिंहशास्त्री ) .

  

2\. Two things , viz स्वस्तिका (पस्पशाह्निकम्) and आर्य (न्) (पृषोदरादीनि यथोपदिष्टम् , पा सू 6-3-109 ) are borrowed from Mahabhashyam of Patanjali by Nazis .

  

In fact there is no any word like आर्यन् in Sanskrit and the entry in Oxford Dictionary which says it is a Sanskrit word is wrong . ऋ = गतौ , ’ ऋहलोर्ण्यत् ’ पा 3-1-124 -- आर्यः ।

आर्याः follow अहिंसा परमो धर्मः -- Aryans follow हिंसा परमो धर्मः ।

  

3\. A man of German origin , disguised as a queen , camping at Kakinada (capital of East Godavari District ) collected valuble Sanskrit
Talapatras / books from people and transported to his Fatherland .around 1938 .

May be available in Berlin Library - now difficult even to access .

  

4.In 1986 (reported in The Hindu newspaper ) six young German ladies were sent to Ladakh /Kashmir to get impregnated for expanding Aryan Jati .

  

5\. Last year some forty Germans (with a Translator ) attended a Workshop by Ayush in New Delhi to have first hand knowledge of Ayurveda .
