Dear Shri Korada Garu,

  

I have come across the information that you shared and saw the video.

  

I saw this or some information similar to this 2 years back in a different forum (/media) and asked a friend of mine who is a PhD in Physics in Germany to check with the University of Frankfurt. I was informed by him that his colleagues in Frankfurt are not aware of this.

While it is possible that many things were hidden to prevent sharing of knowledge, it is also hard not to discount the possibility of something different.

The problem these days is there is a lot of fake information floating around. It is hard to know which is true and which is false and there is a necessity to examine claims.

Do you have independent sources (like the relatives of widows etc who drew pension from Germany) to corroborate this?

Is there some other place where the same information has been shared with more details?

  

While it is true that many divisions of the Nazi apparatus were interested in Oriental knowledge systems and artefacts to gain a psychological and technological edge, it has become essential to sift fact from fiction to ensure we have an unvarnished view of history as it unfolded.

  

Many thanks,

  

Venkat
