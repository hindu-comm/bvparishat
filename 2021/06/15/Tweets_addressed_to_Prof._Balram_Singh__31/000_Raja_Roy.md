Respected members,  

  

Here are two tweets I sent addressed to Prof. Balram Singh (Director of INADS that has given Adjunct Professorship to Oak) on Sunday. He has not responded yet. Oak is refusing to provide info after multiple requests here. Refusal to share exact details means that the data has been manufactured.
