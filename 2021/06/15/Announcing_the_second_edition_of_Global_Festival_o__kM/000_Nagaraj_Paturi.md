Dear all,

  

Namaste! Trust you are safe and doing well.

  

We, at Indica Yoga, are happy to share that we will be launching the second edition of the Global Festival of Yoga 2021, from June 21st to July, 18th, 2021.

  

We will be announcing the event across all our social media platforms and website soon but just wanted to share with our internal organization first. This year's theme is Healing \| Well-Being \| Wisdom and we will be focusing on yoga, ayurveda, nutrition and the wisdom of the scriptures. This year we have a special focus on the plant-based food movement, among otherthings.

  

We are also pleased to share that we would be partnering with our Center for Soft Power (CSP) and other organisations for global outreach.

  

Furthermore, sharing the logo with all of you. Our logo for this year is based on the auspicious Shiva Yantra which signifies the destruction of diseases, removal of influence of bad planets, and encouragement of overall well-being. Our new team member Ms Sophia Ann French has contributed towards conceptualizing and designing the logo.

  

  

  

May Shiva bless us and destroy all that plagues us.

  

We look forward to your blessings, participation and support.

  

Warm regards

  

On behalf of Team Indica Yoga
