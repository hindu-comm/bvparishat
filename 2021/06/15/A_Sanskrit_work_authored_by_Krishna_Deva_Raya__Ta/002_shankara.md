Namaste,

  

Giving below relevant entry and snippet of the relevant page from New Catalogus Catalogorum vol 18, available online at <https://vmlt.in/ncc/18?page=56>. It seems 'Madalasa-Charitam' was published in the Sanskrit journal 'Sahridaya' vol 4 (may be in 1904). But, I could not find it online.  

  

Madālasācarita, prose. by Kṛṣṇadevarāya. Mentioned by the a. himself in his own Telugu work Āmuktamālyada. See for details, *Vij. Sex. Cent.* p.. 207-12, 231 ff. 313; also M. Krishnamachariar, *HCSL.* Sn. 501.
