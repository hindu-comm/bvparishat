Dr. Ujjval-ji's statement needs no addition or emendation.

  

The *avagraha* mark here is a mere, regular, **writing convention**  

as current in Sanskrit for centuries perhaps (if not more)  

and has nothing to do with singing.  

Hence I have invented nothing new.

(One doesn't have to mix up notations from music if any, even if similar in looks).

  

In देवाऽधिपाऽऽहार-हारिन् in the same Daṇḍaka,

the help provided by the *avagraha* is in showing that  

when you split *devādhipa*, you must split it as *deva + **a**dhipa* only;

 whereas in *adhipāhāra*, it is *adhipa + **ā**hāra* only.

In the former case, the *single* *avagraha* indicates that the 2nd word begins with *short ***a*.***

In the latter case, the *double* *avagraha* indicates that the 2nd word begins with *long ***ā*.***

**

Hope this helps.
