The *avagraha* mark, single (ऽ) or double (ऽऽ),

has a defined role in Sanskrit Sandhi.

It is not any musical notation.

In Roman transliteration,  

a single quotation mark and a double quotation mark  

assume that role respectively.  

  

Appearing in the context of *Savarṇa-dīrgha-sandhi,*

a single *avagraha* indicates that, upon splitting the words,

the latter word begins with a *hrasva*; a double *avaagraha* that

it begins with a *dīrgha* letter.

  

Thus *ahi +ina + antaka* will yield *ahī'na'ntaka*
