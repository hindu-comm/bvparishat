*Avagraha* is an aid for clarity, ultimately, a means to access the meaning more easily.

Using it on every possible occasion goes to enhance the user-friendliness of the text presented,

which is a premium requirement today in making the reader as independent as possible.

  

In the texts we are presenting, they function as semantic aids (and not musical aids).  

  

Was there some discussion on its antiquity in BVP earlier too?
