That words are "humanly formed" than "eternal" is a basic dichotomy.

The word dissection was prevented by the Church and there is no

analysis in the west. The words are assumed as labels. We do a  

small effort of universality by using Paninian syllable theory.
Syllables

are possibly "eternal," built into human biology. Their expressive capacity

can also be assumed to be "eternal" as a product of biology. Then comes  

the neural grammar and the compounding of syllables to cognitively define a वस्तु.

  

I will stop here. I will share the documents in the course of time.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
