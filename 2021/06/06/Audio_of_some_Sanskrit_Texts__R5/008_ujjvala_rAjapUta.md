मैवम्। अ॒व॒ग्र॒हः केव॑लं पदच्छे॒दं सु॒लभं॒ कर्तुं॒ प्रयु॑ज्यते विक॒ल्पेन॑। न तूच्यमा॑नस्य॒ किमपि॑ बोधयति। दी॒र्घो दी॒र्घ ए॒व ति॑ष्ठति।

  

It's not like that. Avagraha is just an optional mark used to make it easier for the reader to analyse the words in order to understand. It does not make any difference to the pronunciation. A dīrgha vowel remains dīrgha, with or without the avagraha symbol.
