I thought it is a recitation symbol that the mAtrA would be distorted.

We automatically avoid such constructs in speech by setting up words

differently. The question would be the pronunciation of the vowel

in such conditions.

  

It would only come when a vowel is the lead letter of a word.  

In such a situation, it is not a वस्तु, a physical object. The cognition of  

the first-letter vowel words in speech is what i am trying to understand.

  

I don't wish to drag this discussion into the biology of phonetics.

We may end discussion when we like.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
