Namaste



1. Not all these words for water might have been used in ordinary informal conversation.

***(On 1- BVK Sastry )***: Not all these words for ‘water’ have the same ‘morphology’ (Pada-Vyutpatti) ; Because base (Prakruti) is NOT the same. In Samskruth, the precise term needs to be used to fit the context.

Only ‘Kavya- usage of Bhashaa-Sanskrit words’ are allowed this ‘ poets license-freedom’. 
This freedom cannot be /should not be extended to other disciplines.



2. Which is the word that was used in Sanskrit for water in ordinary, informal conversation?

***(On 2- BVK Sastry )***: Practical Informal Conversation for ‘Sanskrit’ needs a back-derivation from ‘Prakrit’ local historical usage listing.

Ask the question differently : ‘Which is the word that was used in **Prakrits derived from Sanskrit** for water in ordinary, informal conversation? Mahaveer and Buddha historical context.



3. Since Sanskrit ceased to be a naturally spoken language a long time ago, how do we determine which word was the one that was used in natural conversational mode?



***(On 3- BVK Sastry )***: See response -2. The pre-drawn conclusion \< Sanskrit Ceased to be a spoken language long time ago> kills rest of the initiative ! Why ? Because there is a lack of clarity in imagining ‘Samskruth-Sambhashanam in long-ago time line, like Vedic PIE usage (Earlier to Ramayana) Ramayana (6000 BCE ?) Mahabharata/ Gita (3100 BCE Earlier), Patanjali ( circa 200 BCE earlier), ….. . Each team has its own song.



The haunting question remains : Who were the ‘Samskruth Speakers’ who maintained the ‘Standards of Pronunciation, Morphology and Semantics’ over millennia in land-history of Bharath, beyond the ‘Vedics’ ??

Why ?? What motive ?? Was it a conspiracy theory by one section to dominate?? What broke this tradition? What caused the ‘ glorious traditions of ‘ head –pride’ to lose its spine, arms and legs’ ?

Why do we need ‘past’ recreated ‘today’ for a future imagined beneficiaries’ unless we become clear of todays and tomorrow’s needs ?



The offshoots of this question: (a) Which team of Grammarians took upon their shoulders to retain the ‘ Purity- Standards in Spoken mode’ (b) What was the social compulsion for ‘ ONE –UNCHANGING- Samskrutham to be living as a vibrant language in society alongside MANY –MULTIPLE- LANGUAGES (–Prakruths, Apabhramshas, Mlecchas, Siddha-Guhya-Dramida Bhashaas ) and their own Grammars ? Who were the patrons and beneficiaries ?



Have We today got any clarity on this ‘ HISTORIC FOOTPRINT and CULTURAL CONTINUITY’ of Panini-Language ? Call it disciplines of Swadesi / Videsi - Anthropology, Indology, History of Classics ?
