I watched a recent video of Shri Nityanand Miśra-ji in which he mentioned the following doha:

  

काबुल गए मुगल बन आए, बोले मुगली बानी

"आब, आब" कर मर गए, रखा सिरहाने पानी

  

(Went to Kabul, and returned as a Mughal, speaking the language of the Mughals.

Died crying “āb, āb” while water was kept by the pillow (sirhānā)). 

  

Āb is water in Persian, but the dying person could not get it as nobody understood what the person was saying.

  

An interesting doha and applicable to many in present day India who do not necessarily go to the country of the English but internalize English right in India. When they “come down” to their mother tongues occasionally, they pepper it profusely with English as to make it unrecognizable. A similar thing might have happened during the Mughal / Muslim rule when the elite peppered their mother tongues profusely with Farsi and Arabic words which led to the birth of Urdu.

  

The focus of this post is not the above, but a different subject matter.

  

Sanskrit “ap” and Persian āb are obviously cognate. But Sanskrit has many other words for water, for example jalam and salilam; and perhaps “pānīyam” (literally drinkable or beverage) since many north Indian languages have pānī for water. Not all these words for water might have been used in ordinary informal conversation. Which is the word that was used in Sanskrit for water in ordinary, informal conversation?

  

This is applicable to words for many other things. Sanskrit has many words, more than most languages, that stand for a single thing. When we learn Malayalam in school, we learn paryāyam (words with same meaning) for Sanskrit tatsama words, and the paryāya list is often very long.
Some of these words in the paryāyalist could be artificially created ones, especially by poets to meet the requirements of meter, alliteration, simile etc. Since Sanskrit ceased to be a naturally spoken language a long time ago, how do we determine which word was the one that was used in natural conversational mode? If we want to revive Sanskrit as a spoken link language, wouldn’t it be helpful to identify which of the paryāya words were actually used in informal conversation?
