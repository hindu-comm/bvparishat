आप॒ इत्य॒यं शब्दो॑ मू॒लतो॑ जलाश॒येषु॒ प्रयु॑क्तः। उ॒द॒कम् इत्य॒यं ज॒ले।

*Āpaḥ* was originally used for water bodies. *Udakam*for water.

  

(उदक—कोंकणी)

  

ततो॑ ज॒लम् इत्य॒यम् ए॒व प्रायु॑ज्यत प्रा॒येण॑।

Then, later, *jalam*was primarily used for water.

  

तथापि॑ देश-काल-जन-यदृच्छा-प्रभा॒वो व॑र्तत॒ इत्यत्र॒ न सं॑श॒यः।

But then effect of time, country, person and choice should always be accepted.

ब॒हूनां॑ संस्कृतग्र॒न्थानां॒ पठ॑नाद् अ॒न्यो न कोऽप्यु॑पा॒यः प्रति॑भाति मे।

Can't see any way other than reading a lot of Sanskrit literature.
