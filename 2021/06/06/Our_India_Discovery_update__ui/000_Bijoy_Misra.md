Friends,

  

Her in our work through India Discovery Center our goal is to create

concise knowledge based essays that can be studied by secondary  

school children around the world. The potential audience are the secondary

school teachers who may prepare special modules to teach in their classes.

We will host teachers' workshops in the US later in the year and continue  

next year. We plan to extend to other countries gradually.

  

The following is our latest essay - "Geography and People in Golden Period of

India 200BCE-500CE". The essay is authored by Dr Hemendra Acharya, a  

geophysicist, whose father served as an escort to Mahatma Gandhi.

  

The essays are produced through Facebook, there is a continuity of essays

there. We will compile a book at the end of the year.
