Your booklist is useful.

  

What it lacks is an indication of two things : the **year** of publication and  

the number of **pages** in each book.  

  

In fact, **all** decent/serious/academic **publishers** would do well to necessarily provide  

these two bits of info reg. every publication of theirs. Else, one will not know  

whether it is just a pamphlet or a massive tome  

(and whether its price is commensurate or not).  

  

Also, one clarification required in respect of every book on **Vedic** interpretation is :  

does the author go by the traditional interpretation

or that of Swami Dayananda Sarasvati ?
