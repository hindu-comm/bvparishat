Ashish ji

  

You make a good point but there is something else at work here.

Parashara smrti says in kali yuga it is best for the yajamana himself to do the japa if he is adhikari. If the son can do it is better. Next is someone who has genuine affection for the yajamana.

Doing through the medium of others is last option at best.

  

Now the actual effectiveness of the mantra is a direct function of yama niyama and tapasshakti.....and the power of prarabdha.

A varuna japa in Tamilnadu did not have effect because the ppl who did mantra karma ate food with salt. Salt is nishedha for this kAmyakarma.

  

So as you see there are many variables in this equation.
