Respected Scholars,

  

**ॐ त्र्यम्बकं यजामहे सुगन्धिं पुष्टिवर्धनम् उर्वारुकमिव बन्धनान् मृत्योर्मुक्षीय मामृतात्**  

  

In these days of global calamity, the above vedic mantra has become very popular among all classes of believers, some knowing the meaning and a great majority without it. There is a variety of meanings/interpretations available with very fine and in some cases very contrary purports.

In view of this, with I all humility, I request the scholars to provide the correct literary; and if possible the esoteric meaning of the mantra.

  

Please provide the other forms of conjugation of the kriya "mukSIya"

  

Sincerely,

  

Ramchander Deekonda
