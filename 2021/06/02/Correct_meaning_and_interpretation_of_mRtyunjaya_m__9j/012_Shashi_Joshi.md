Sayana says urvArukam = karkaTiphalam = kakaDi in Hindi.

There are varieties of Indian traditional kakadi (before english cucumber came to market)

Below are some pics that I can recognise from my grandparent's farm I would visit in summer vacations.

  

These karkaTi, when on the vine, and not yet ripe, are **very difficult** to pull off the vine. You can pull and pull as much as you want, and it won't come off. You need a knife.

But when it is ripe, a flick of the finger on the stalk separates it from the vine. Effortless.

I can vouch for these as personal experience.

  

In my opinion/understanding - The mantra prays to the shiva, the auspicious, the one unseen but spread/felt like the fragrance (fragrance from a single source is felt all over in the room), the nourisher, may he make my separation as painless as that of a karkaTi/urvArukam (when ripe, so may I also a ripe life and painless death), but no separate from deathlessness.

  

Also, since every mortal body must perish in its form, I think the meaning/prayer/wish here is to conquer the fear of death, not mortal death itself. It is the fear of death that is painful.
