Dear All

After reading the explanations given by all experts, I'm sharing one of my experience related to this mantra.

I have noticed specially in North India that when a person is critically I'll and chances of survival is very tough, family usually try to go for chanting of maha mrityunjay mantra through pundits. Usually, I noticed that person is unable to survive and leave the body.

  

However, when I discussed this in south India, there they shared that usually they prescribe this mantra much before the native is severely sick and most of the times, native comes out from any risk.

  

May be you have other experience. Hence, if you have any other input to give then please share.

  

Regards

ashish sharma
