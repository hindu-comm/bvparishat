I thank Shriman Vishnu Namboodiri for the scholarly explanation provided by him. I also thank Shriman AB for the video of Swamy Chinmayananda ji.

  

In this connection as a non-specialist learner, I, now understand the literal meaning of the mantra, in the light of the meanings provided as:  

  

"*I worship Siva, who has three eyes, and who is fragrance and who is the nourisher. Just as a (ripe) cucumber gets released from its stalk, may I get freedom from death - not from deathlessness."*

  

As Swami Chinmayananda ji explained, cucumber never ever gets separated from its stalk, even when fully ripe, until it is cut by external agency, the farmer. Thus, the "saadhaka" is desiring to enjoy full life until he is released from the body (by the Siva). In other words, he does not want to die unripe, premature or untimely. And, after his release from the material body, he wants to join the realm of death deathlessness.

Please correct me if found wrong.

  

Sincerely,

Ramchander Deekonda
