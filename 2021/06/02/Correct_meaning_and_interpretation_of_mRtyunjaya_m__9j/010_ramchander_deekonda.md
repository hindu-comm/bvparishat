Respected scholars,

  

From the interpretation of Sayanacharya, provided by Vidvan Subramania Chidambaran, it is clear that the fruit, cucumber, (urvArukam) falls on its own when ripe - स्वयमेव मुच्यन्ते ; whereas Swami Chinmayananda emphatically declares that cucumber is the only fruit that never falls pff or separates from the stalk on its own even when fully ripe; and it needs to be cut with a knife. It is really confusing. I am neither a horticulturist, nor I have any experience of growing cucumbers. Will anybody please bring a reconciliation between these two empirical observations.

  

Regards,

Ramchander Deekonda
