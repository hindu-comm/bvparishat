As far as I understand, urvarukam is not a cucumber but a kind of pumpkin called 'suraikkay' in Tamil. Generally it spreads on earth. When ripe it neither falls nor is it cut. It separates from the plant without causing any harm to both itself and to the mother plant. By the grace of the Lord, a devotee gets separated from the bondages easily, effortlessly, without any pain or suffering. This could be the meaning.

Ramaratnam
