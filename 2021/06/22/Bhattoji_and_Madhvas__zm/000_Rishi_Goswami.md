Namaste

  

Would like to know about Bhattoji and his grammatical criticism on Madhva as well as the possible solutions/refutation provided by Madhvas.

  

Someone also informed me about Prakriya Kaumudi, where Bhattoji learnt it from Sheshakrishnacharya and reframed it as Siddhanta Kaumudi. How true is this.

  

Also found a link to Madhav Deshpandi ji's article on Appayya Dikshita's connection to Bhattoji but cannot find any downloadable link.

  

Please share sources/views to know more on this topic.

  

Namami
