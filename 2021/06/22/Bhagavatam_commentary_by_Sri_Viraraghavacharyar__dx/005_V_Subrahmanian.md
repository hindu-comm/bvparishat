Namaste

  

Actually the entire set, with multiple commentaries, including Viraraghaviya, is already available, with me as well, in pdf format.
What I am looking for is an edition with just Viraraghaviya, or perhaps with Sridhari and Vijayadhwaja. The purpose is to have a document that is not very unwieldy, and serves one's particular purpose of reading just the desired commentary. 

  

regards
