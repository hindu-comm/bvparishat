नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

‘महादेव‘ as samasa of Dhatu and Subanta’ ?  

  

What do you mean ? I did not get ---

  

महान् is a सुबन्त - देव is -- महादेवः is a समास -- upon that स्त्रीप्रत्यय in पुंयोग -- महादेवी । Where is the question of धातु+ सुबन्त ?

  

  

And then ‘stree –pratyaya’? Sometimes a debated issue in grammar - ‘ Dhatu-garbha –samaasa/ Dhatu-poorva-pada samasa with a subanta’?

The reference does provide a ‘ artha-nirukti’ for ‘महादेव’.

  

Give an example . क्रियया क्रिया समस्यते -- पचतभृज्जत , खादतमोदत।

  

धन्यो’स्मि
