Respected members,

  

I am pleased to share Part 8 of 10 of my blog refuting Nilesh Oak's dating of Ramayana to 12209 BCE.Oak claims more than 575 corroborations for the 12209 BCE date of the Rāmāyaṇa.In this article I show that there is none.

In the appendix of Part 8, I go through each of 71"Error Elimination – Experiments" in the book, The Historic Rama, and show that they are mere diary entries fitted to the pre-supposed date of Rama-Ravana yuddha.
