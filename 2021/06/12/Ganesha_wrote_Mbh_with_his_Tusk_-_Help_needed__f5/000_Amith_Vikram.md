Namaste,

  

I have heard that in earlier recensions of Mbh, it is mentioned that Ganesha wrote the Mahabharata by breaking his tusk because his quill broke.

  

However, I couldn't find the verse mentioning about this in any of the extant versions of the Mbh.

  

I request the members of the forum to shed some light on this topic.

  

Thanks
