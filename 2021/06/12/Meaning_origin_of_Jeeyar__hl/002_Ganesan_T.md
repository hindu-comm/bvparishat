It appears that there was a Jeeyar Santanam (ஜீயர் சந்தானம்) --a lineage of Acharya-s belonging to Saiva Tradition. Dr. Racamanikkanar who had done research on the Historical Development of Saivism in the Tamil country based mainly on inscriptions mentions about a Saiva Acharya by name Aghoradeva who belonged to the Jeeyar Santanam (ஜீயர் சந்தானம்) . He was patronised by Pandya kings of the 12- 13th CE. . Dr. Racamanikkanar cites the inscriptional evidence in the Annual Report of Epigraphy for the year 1916 as evidence. But we do not hear anymore about this lineage of Saiva Acharyas in the later period.  

  

Most probably the Vaishnava Matha-s have taken this name for their own lineage from the 14-15 CE.
