Respected scholars,

  

 In which transliteration scheme following discussion is taking place?

QUOTE  
  
A. \_\_"apaH" does not coordinate with "parihAryam"\_\_  
  
I think mallinAtha's word order is supposed to make  
  
relationships between words clear. By the word order  
  
that greatly separates "apaH" from "parihAryam",  
  
mallinAtha makes it clear that when it comes to  
  
case-number (vibhakti-vachana) agreement "parihAryam"  
  
applies only to "Ushharam" and NOT "apaH".  
  
UNQUOTE

  

Regards and thanks.
