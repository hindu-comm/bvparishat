Regarding the words of Prof. Pollock in the first video clip:

  

1\. Spoken Sanskrit movement is not happening in the place of or to replace the creative use of Sanskrit. We have been showing to the world how the creativity in Sanskrit did not stop from 1800 as observed by him in his Death of Sanskrit piece. We have been showing how creativity in Sanskrit continued during the from 1800 as before if not in more ways than before, till date. Spoken Sanskrit movement did not and does not obstruct that incessant continuation. It can , if at all , add to it, by bringing more people with more variegated contemporary and modern backgrounds into Sanskrit creativity. That is showing up today.

  

One of his arguments in his Death of Sanskrit piece is that modernity did not get articulated through Sanskrit. Ordering Chai in Sanskrit on Bengaluru street is part of articulation of an entire contemporary Indian life through Sanskrit. He must have the scholarly ability to understand the change that language of his focus is undergoing through such a colossal movement. How it results in new literary artefacts for him to study is what he has to look for and apply his scholarship to.

  

 Regarding his words in the second video clip:  

  

2\. What a ridiculous argument !

  

'which you did not create' is the most hurting part of it, hurting not only to Indians but all the global communities participating in the preservation and continuance of the cultural and knowledge heritage whether in the form of oral, written and other forms of texts or in the form of memory, inherited from their ancestors.

  

Even from a common legal understanding, did we all create the properties that we inherit from our ancestors and own with all the rights ?

  

Apart from a community cultural heritage as a right of the inheritor, do the libraries that restrict access to their collections and holdings only to those having membership on the basis of certain criteria also are wrong in doing so ?
