Per his words in this video snippet: <https://twitter.com/pvaal2/status/1301890398407856128>  

  

  

Also interesting are his views at <https://twitter.com/pvaal2/status/1301913079563812866> :

"Inheritors of a past that they did not create themselves have an obligation to share it ... "

  

The premise is wrong, of course. I find it very striking that one does not see oneself as an extension of one's forefathers (sagely or otherwise). Perhaps this comes from not feeling gratitude towards and revering them (via tarpaNa type rituals). Quite ahistorical an attitude for one so obsessed with it.
