Shri Paturi garu

  

Hurt ensues where expectations are broken.

It is high time desi vidvans started having an appreciation for themselves instead of always asking what does pollock or maybe as Vishvas has more appropriately put it bollocks thinks.

  

I find it ridiculous that vidvans of bvp many of whom pollock is not fit be a shoeshine boy for should care what some white skinned supremacist thinks.

  

Please appreciate yourself and your heritage more and stop giving these agenda driven cretins legitimacy.

  

Regards
