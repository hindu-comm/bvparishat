Please help me with how to get aDevanagari QWERTY keyboard for Windows 10. The keyboards that Windows installs for Marathi and Sanskrit and not QWERTY keyboards. Previously I had theDevanagari QWERTY keyboard prepared by the University of British Columbia on my machine, but now Windows 10 will not allow installing that keyboard. Any helpwould be appreciated. With best regards,
