Among the names of the weekdays in Malayalam and Tamil, some days have Drāviḍa names, and the rest have Sanskrit tatsama / tadbhava names. In all other languages of India (except Urdu) all the names are tatsama / tadbhava of Sanskrit. Even Telugu and Kannada do not have any Drāviḍa names for weekdays.

  

Here are the Malayalam / Tamil names of weekdays:

1.  Ñāyaṟ / Ñāyiṟu – Sun. Drāviḍa word 2.  Tiṅkaḷ / Tiṅkaḷ (pronounced tiṅgaḷ in both Malayalam and Tamil) –
    Moon. Drāviḍa word 
3.  Covva / Cevvāy – Red, and hence also planet Mars. Drāviḍa word 4.  Budhaṉ / Putaṉ - Mercury. Malayalam word is tatsama of Sanskrit
    Budha with masculine singular suffix ṉ and Tamil is tadbhava of the
    same Sanskrit word with the same masculine singular suffix ṉ 5.  Vyāẓam / Viyāẓam – Jupiter. Appears to be a tadbhava of a Sanskrit
    word but unclear as to which Sanskrit word it is 6.  Veḷḷi / Veḷḷi – Bright, white, and hence also Venus. Drāviḍa word
    
7.  Śaṉi / Caṉi (Tamil word can be pronounced as Śaṉi, Saṉi, or Caṉi)
    – Saturn. Malayalam word is tatsama of Sanskrit Śaṉi and Tamil is
    tadbhava of the same Sanskrit word

Are any of these names of weekdays mentioned in ancient Tamil literature?

Are the Sanskrit weekday names such as Somavāra, Maṅgalavāra etc., mentioned in the Vedas?
