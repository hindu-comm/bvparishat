namaskar.

  

I don'tknow if I am doing something wrong. the link inside the image is not "clickable nor is it copyable"

Is there a way to always send links without putting it in an image?

*I guess I have never seen links hidden inside images in my entire life!. Nowadays, I see on bvparishat a number of people embedding URL links inside images making it very inconvenient for people.*

  

Hope I am not hurting anyone. This is just a suggestion for a change.

  

  

*Best Regards,*
