Dear Professor Wakankar,

  

Thank you for your appreciation.

  

I agree with your suggestion. The usage ofगिरिशः would clarify the meaning. To maintain the meter, I would use महेशः. However, the Koshas have also equatedगिरीशः with Shiva:

  

भूतेशः खण्डपरशुर्गिरीशो गिरिशो मृडः - इत्यमरः

  

गिरेः कैलासस्य ईशः शिवः - इति वाचस्पत्यम्  

  

But it clearly also means Himalaya.

  

I believe in this case we will have to go by the frequency of past usage.  

  

Best,

Kushagra
