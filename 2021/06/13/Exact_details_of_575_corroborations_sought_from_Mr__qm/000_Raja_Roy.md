Dear Mr. Oak,

Transparency is crucial for research integrity. I want access to the full table of 225+ season references (The Historic Rama, p. 229) for scrutiny. Also, + signs in 575+ claims are misleading. I want to know the exact figures for each claim with complete references for scrutiny. Please make this information available.

  

Dear Ms. Bhaty,

I believe in one of your talks you have claimed to have checked each claim made by Mr. Oak independently. Please let us know if this is true or not. If yes, please provide the methodology you have used to crosscheck Mr. Oak's claims.

  

Best regards,

Dr. Raja Roy
