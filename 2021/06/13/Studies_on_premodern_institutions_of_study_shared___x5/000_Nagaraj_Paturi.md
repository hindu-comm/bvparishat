There are a number of important reports on such institutions in the nineteenth century, the best known being Adam's reports on Bengal (discussed by DiBona and by Baber) and Leitner for the Panjab and Parulekar for Bombay. There are important reports too by Campbell, Thornton, Parulekar, Hunter and others. Ward talks about Benares. I found Whitehead a good overview

This was in response to the following post by Prof. Mathew Kapstein :

Dear friends,

  

Might any of you be able to point me to good sociological or anthropological studies - or sound personal testimonies - of programs of study in traditional mathas and pathasalas? Or other institutionalized settings in which Sanskrit learning was cultivated?

  

I am not interested in work on renunciate communities that does not engage rather precisely with the question of formal education.

  

with thanks in advance,

Matthew
