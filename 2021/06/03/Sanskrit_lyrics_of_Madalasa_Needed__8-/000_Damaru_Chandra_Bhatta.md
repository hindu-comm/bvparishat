Dear Scholars,

Greetings!

  

I need the whole Sanskrit lyrics of the teaching of Madalasa (of Markendyea Puran) that goes like this:

शुद्धोसि बुद्धोसि निरंजनोsसि.... विपत्समुद्राज्जन- मुद्धरेथा: ।

  

I found the lyrics on the internet but they are not wholly correct, I think so.

I would be obliged to your kind help if you could send them to me.

  

Regards,

Damaru Chandra Bhatta
