Very aptly said, Prof. Paturi.

  

In fact the *varga-pañcama-anunāsika* is what gets pronounced automatically and very naturally.

*Anusvāra* in its place sounds unnatural, artificial, and extraneous.

From what I have observed - excepting those who have not learnt an Indian language naturally,

(i.e. as either their own mother tongue, or from neighbours/friends who are native speakers of the tongue),

\- the pronunciation of a native speaker betrays the *natural vargānunāsika*.

  

No native speaker says "paṁḍita".  

 All naturally say "paṇḍita"
