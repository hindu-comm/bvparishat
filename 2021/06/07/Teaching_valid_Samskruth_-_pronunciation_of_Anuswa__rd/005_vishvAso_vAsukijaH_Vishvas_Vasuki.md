Though right about ण ङ म न, both shrI KSK and NP are wrong in saying/ implying that ञकार is naturally produced in words like पंच - just ask someone to say पंच and पंथा a few times - you wontnotice a difference in the n. नकार oft gets used.

  

This is because people are habituated to producing cha-varga with the tip of their tongue (rather than a more backward part) touching the palate.

  

More generally, many people go about thinking they have excellent pronunciation - blissfully unaware of their flaws. Common examples: अ, ज्ञ.
