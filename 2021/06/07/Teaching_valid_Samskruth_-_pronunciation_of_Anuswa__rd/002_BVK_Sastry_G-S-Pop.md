Namaste



A curiosity question in connection with \< प्रायेण विद्वांसोऽपि ञकारं न वदन्ति "पञ्च, पञ्चतन्त्रम्, पञ्जाब्" इत्यादिषु शब्देषु - नकार एव श्रूयते।>



What Should be the Linguistic classification of such pronunciation? And related expressions ? - Options being :



A\) Tolerably Regional Compliant Expression to ‘Bhashaa- standards of Sanskrit

B) Not Compatible to Standard / ‘Bhashaa- standards of Sanskrit

C\) Prakrit Variation of Bhashaa-Sanskrit

D\) None of the above : A new ‘dialect - breed of ‘Bhashaa’ -Sanskrit



Thanks in advance for schoalrs response.

Regards

BVK Sastry
