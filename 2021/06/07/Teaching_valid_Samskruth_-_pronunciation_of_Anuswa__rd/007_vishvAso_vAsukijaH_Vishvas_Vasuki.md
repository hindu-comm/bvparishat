This articulation leads to the inability to produce sufficiently distinct sounds when saying पञ्च vs पन्च . Hence, it is wrong - the contact with the hard palate should be further back. I have seen a highly learned traditional scholar go to the extant of placing it between kaNTha and mUrdhA (क च ट त प thereby forming a logical progression of positions ). Though I don't agree with it to that extant - I agree with him that the currently popular point of contact is too forward (And I am not talking about telugu tsa, but the above).
