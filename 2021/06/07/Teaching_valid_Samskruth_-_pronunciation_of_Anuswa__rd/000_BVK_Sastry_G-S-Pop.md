Namaste



One more video on challenging issues of teaching valid
Samskruth - pronunciation of ‘ Anuswara’ and ‘Anun-Naasika’ in early schooling in a multilingual environment. A bold statement on faulty school teaching system on Langauges.



<https://youtu.be/nAeUf8oeX3k> \[ run time about 20 minutes\]. \[2018- 867,049 views \] - Panchamakshar Anuswar Chandra bindu \| पंचमाक्षर अनुस्वार चन्द्रबिन्दु





Issue to contemplate: (a) Samskruth Speech Standards and Scripting Challenges in multiple scripts. (b) Writing systems of Varnaksharas across Indian Languages (c ) Challenge of Romanization and Reverse-Romanization for Indian languages.

 (b) Samskruth Scholar Watch on School-Language Learning and Scholarly Publications.



So what is our view on Panini rules : Shiva sutra ञ -म -ङ-ण-न-म्
and related sutra as मोऽनुस्वारः ? Was the rule meant to guide ‘Alternate Pronunciation’ Or Bridge ‘Samskruth- Prakruth Language Simpliifcation gap’ ?
