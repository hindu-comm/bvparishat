Going by Sri Vishvas' idea - that it is precisely because *cakāra* (or even *cavarga*)  

is not being pronounced properly that *ñ* is not pronounced properly -  

can we think of a different way of confirming/solving the issue?

  

Assuming that the human ear has lost some sensitivity to the pronunciation of *ñ*,

\- primarily perhaps because we do not have many (traditional/other) scholars who have maintained

an authentic pronunciation that can be imparted to others (or could sensitise others to the same) -  

do we (or don't we) have instruments (some kinds of "sonographs") that mark and match  

features such as the wavelength of "close" sounds such as *\[pa\]**n**\[ca\]/\[pa\]**ñ**\[ca\],* (and many other pairs/groups)

(for there were discussions earlier here wrt complexities in correct/plausible pronunciations of  

*rr̥/rlr̥/lr̥* (as vowel, & as consonant+vowel)/*llr̥* etc.)?

  

If there are discrepancies/differences in human estimates wrt authenticity/accuracy of pronunciation,

can this mechanical way not help us? (It could well be comparable to the difference in temperature

as assessed by a touch of the hand, and as reported by a thermometre). After all, there are/should be

instruments that can be quite sensitive - much more than the human ear can be - in such situations.

  

Has anybody tried this out wrt the pronunciation of Indian languages in general,

and Sanskrit in particular? Won't this put an end to the endless confusions/disputes?

Has the *sthāna-prayatna-viveka* been mechanically represented/analysed/articulated?

  

Those in the field of phonetics and engg. may have something to contribute.
