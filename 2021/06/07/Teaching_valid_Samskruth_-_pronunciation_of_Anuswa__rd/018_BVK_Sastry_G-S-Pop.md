Namaste Patrui garu



1. Thanks for the suggested resolution of ‘ regional language pronunciation of Samskruth and scripting –historicity’. I look forward for your helpful clarification on other points in the post, on Panini-sutra understanding.



2. The observation \< happens because of convenience of pronunciation, \> is a human language phenomenon. The primary debated issue in the thread is ‘Samskruth Pronunciation’ and ‘scripting- reading the script’ comes later as a part of acquired learning.



3. The Samskruth-Speech-Programmers have been enforcing a machine program to simulate human- model of language; imposing a ‘IPA-Romanized Sanskrit pronunciation’ and calling it ‘ Panini- implementation’ . In this process, there has been a tremendous misrepresentation and
malignant interpretation of ‘Panini –Guidance’. 

Panini –Yaska – Regional Language grammarians guidance is for ‘ Derivation of Words used in Meaningful sentences for purposive application using ‘Human Varna-akshara Pronunciation standards’ as provided for for ‘ Vaidika-Laukika-shabdas in Shikhsaa and PRatishaakhya tradition.



Meddling with Panini using ‘anglicised language model is called a hermeneutic error : analysing oranges using Apple model.



The ‘ Machine- Masters’ are not appropriate authority to ‘meddle with Panini-area, until they cross the ‘Shikshaa-Gate of human pronunciation’ and till such time a ‘ Humanized Machine- Model’ is designed. It is a long haul.



3. The ‘Techno-Linguistic Programmer’s intervention and misrepresentation of Standards of a Sacred language and making audacious claims with arrogance can be seen in the public reference placed below: The portion highlighted is identifying ‘BVP’ as a
better ‘venue’ for ‘ irrelevant posts’. The snippet is from url:
[](https://groups.google.com/g/sanskrit-programmers)\< <https://groups.google.com/g/sanskrit-programmers> \>



I believe that BVP has a reason and responsibility to respond to this public statement and outbursts that have erupted in this regard.

4. As a senior member and moderator, if you and all others think BVP is a ‘better venue for irrelevant posts’ as ‘ opined by the
‘Sanskrit-Programmer’ group cross responding here, you may make your response.

I rest here.
