There ARE dental *versions* of pronunciations of च and ज .

  

Grammars of classical Telugu give recognition to these versions naming them as dantya च and dantya ज.

  

There were script symbols used for these versions with the Telugu digit for 2 being written on the top of the Telugu script symbols for च and ज , i.e., on the top ofచ and జ.

  

Pronunciation of dantyaచ ( च) is close to 'ts' . That is why Telugu words heard by the British with this pronunciation were spelt in Roman with ts. For example, sign board a place called चुंडूरुచుండూరుstands as Tsunduru.

  

Ancient Telugu inscriptions too have such representations of datya చ ( च) as त्स .

  

Dantya ज has pronunciation close to that of z in English words written with z. Zebra, Zoo.

  

But these are not the widely prevalent pronunciations of च and ज in Sanskrit and /or other Indian languages.

  

They are clearly taalavya / palatal in pronunciation. They are pronouncedby raising the blade, or front, of the tongue toward or against the hard palate just behind the alveolar ridge (the gums).
