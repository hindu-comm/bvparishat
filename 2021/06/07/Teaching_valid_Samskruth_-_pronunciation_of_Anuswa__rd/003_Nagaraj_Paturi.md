Dear Dr BVK Sastry avare,

  

Pronunciation of the anunaasikaimmediately preceding a kanthya spars'a varna as kanthya anunaasika, (anunaasikaimmediately preceding a taalavyaspars'a varna as taalavyaanunaasika,anunaasikaimmediately preceding a muurdhanyaspars'a varna as muurdhanyaanunaasika,

anunaasikaimmediately preceding a dantyaspars'a varna as dantyaanunaasika,anunaasikaimmediately preceding a oshthyaspars'a varna as oshthyaanunaasika) 

  

happens because of convenience of pronunciation, under the influence of the immediately following consonant, because it is easy to do the uccaarana prayatna of the same vocal muscles for two different consonants pronounced one immediately after the other,

  

not because of a prescription from any rule book.

  

This is a kind of partial assimilation, an anticipatorypartial assimilation, an intra-word anticipatory partial assimilation in most words, sometimes an inter-morpheme (sanshi-caused) (hence a kind of intra-word only) or inter-word sandhi-caused anticipatory partial assimilation.

  

In the ancient Telugu inscriptions, before anusvaara script symbol was borrowed into Telugu script, clusters, samyuktavarnas,were written with the symbol of the vargaanunaasika preceding the script symbol of vargaspars'a.

  

It must have happened because of the scribe who was usually a non-scholaralystone-cutting/stone-inscribing professional, writing close to his pronunciation .
