I agree with Ujjwal Ji that this प्रयोग didn’t seem grammatically sound. Even I was thinking of the examples of सपत्नीकः and सभार्यः when creating these compounds.

  

However, I realized that similar प्रयोग-s had been done by poets of the past. Besides the examples provided by Dr. Rajaraman, I seem to recall one such प्रयोग describing the Devi (though can’t reproduce the verse now). I thought that those poets might be justifying their usage somehow and hence it might be acceptable to follow them.

  

Best,

Kushagra
