Subbuji,

  

This verse is from Markandeya Purana 37.23.  

Also occurs in Garuda Purana 2.49.56 with some changes.

तस्मात्सङ्गः सदा त्याज्यः स चेत्त्यक्तुं न शक्यते । महद्भिः सह कर्तव्यः सन्तः सङ्गस्य भेषजम् ॥

  

Last quarter is quoted by Anandagiri in his tika on Bhagavadgita 13.10.  

  

regards  
shankara
