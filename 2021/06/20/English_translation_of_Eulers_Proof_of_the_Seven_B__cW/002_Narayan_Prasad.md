Namaste sir.

  

\<\<I am not sure if this is a verbatim translation, however Kent University has the following PDF.>\>

  

I saw this earlier. But it is not the translation of Euler's proof. The first page (i.e. p.128) of his paper in the given link supplied by me in my first message is attached herewith.
