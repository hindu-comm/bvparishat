Namaste,

If you want to know about thecontributions of Sri KSV, watch this video. There were about 100 participants. Several dozens of students spoke in fluent Sanskrit about Sri KSV Swamin. Students from all over India and Nepal talked in this video.

  

Main speakers include:

  

Sondha Svarnavalli Samsthana Jagadguru Shankaracharya  

Sri B.V Ramapriya

Sri M.A Alwar

So many great speakers from different parts of India and Nepal (please excuse me. I don't know their names. The names are listed in this video).

  

  

  

**Please forward this to anyone who may be interested.**
