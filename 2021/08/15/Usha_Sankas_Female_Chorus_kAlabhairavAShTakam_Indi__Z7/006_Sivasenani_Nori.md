While I was checking these videos, YouTube suggested the stotra by S. P. Balasubrahmanyam (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9S_IRXsNJjQ>). I could not resist. The lyrics in Roman letters displayed in that video were so different from what I was used to, that it took me a while to realize that there has been no mistake. One knew that Tamil orthography is different, but this was most unusual, in that the Roman letters stayed true to the way the stotra would be written in Tamil, rather than the way it is pronounced.

  

Very nice rendering in both the videos shared. Prof. Paturi's point about the depiction of bhayaanaka-rasais so valid. It seems to be a super-imposition of the general image on the particular text, as an inherent property of the vastu. To be sure, those elements are also present in the stotra, for the descriptions include: दिगम्बरः, श्यामकायः, भीमविक्रमः, उग्रशासनः, कपालमालिकाधरः and भूतसङ्घनायकः, but in general the author Sankaracharya focuses on the non-bhayaanakaaspects like Kalabhairava being भवाब्धितारकः, भुक्तिमुक्तिदायकः, सुशर्मदायकः etc., which is the true tattva of Kalabhairavaand the key point of the stotra.
