Yes, Dr Sevasenani garu.

  

The traditional categories for the two forms of the deities are ugra and prasanna. Several Hindu deities have both versions, ugramuurti and prasanna muurti.

  

Kaala bhairava too potentially can have both muurtis.

  

But the point is that this particular stotra has overwhelming prasanna descriptions with occasional , one or two, ugra descriptions.
