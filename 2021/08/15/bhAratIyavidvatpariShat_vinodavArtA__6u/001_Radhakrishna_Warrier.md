üòÉ. This is interesting.  

  

But not all south Indians say Prasadam. Kannadigas say Prasada.
Sanskrit words are loaned in dvitiya vibhakti only by Malayalis, Tamilians and Telugus. And the Telugus make it Prasadamu, adding a u to the dvitiya.

  

I have always wondered why only Malayalam, Tamil and Telugu do this and not the north Indian languages and Kannada. If I remember right, I asked this question once in this forum. The answer I got, again if I remember right, was that in some text it is said so, or some grammarian said so, or something similar. But that didn't really answer my question. The grammarian, or whoever that was, was just describing a fact. My question was the why of the fact - the reason for the south Indian languages borrowing the Sanskrit dvitiya form while north Indian languages didn't do so.
