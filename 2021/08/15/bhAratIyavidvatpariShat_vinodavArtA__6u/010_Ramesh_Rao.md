The an sound appearing in Kannada is also sandhi issue, I think. There are other linguistic matters over which I have no qualifications to write about. For example, it is naanu/nanage, avanu/avanige, avaru/avarige, avalu/avalige, and Raama/Raamanige. For Raama, it would be difficult to say "Raamage" and therefore the an sound is used, making it "Raamanige".

  

Nagaraj ji can throw more light on these matters. Also. Halaygannada -- Old Kannada (the sandhi here is interesting here, with ka becoming ga) -- used sounds in conjunction with words no longer used in the Kannada we speak now, I believe. Halaygannada made life difficult for a lot of school children, if I remember right, though, studying in English medium schools, I did not have to learn it.
