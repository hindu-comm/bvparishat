Dr Ramesh Rao avare,

  

Kannada too has similar Kannadaizing suffixes at the end of its Sanskrit borrowings.

  

rāmah = rāmas is Sanskrit. rāma+ s in Sanskrit.

  

rāma is the stem, prātipadikā . rāma+ an in Tamil. rāma+ anu in Kannada. rāma+(an) ḍu in Telugu. Dravidianists derive all the three from the reconstructed proto-Dravidian form \* -an.

  

Similarly, Kannada has -vu ending forms as optional forms for these words like prasāda . prasādavu is the optional form. This -vu is found in the native Kannada words like hāvu, bēvu .

  

rāma banda(nu), rāmanu banda(nu) are optional to each other.  

  

prasāda sigitu prasādavu sigitu are mutually optional.
