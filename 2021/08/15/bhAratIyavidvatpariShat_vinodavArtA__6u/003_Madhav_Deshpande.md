This reminds me of a friend of mine who did not know any Sanskrit, but took upon himself to perform a Puja by reciting the Sanskrit instructions from a printed book. I noticed that he was randomly adding -am and -aḥ to words, resulting in a barrage of expressions like "astuḥ" and "tavam kushalam bhavatuh." I asked him what he was doing. His response was that every Sanskrit word should end in -aḥ or -am. When people imitate Sanskrit in Marathi, they do the same thing. The name of a comic play in Marathi is "वयं मोठं खोटं".
