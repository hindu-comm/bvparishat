I don't remember when this question was asked in the forum earlier.

  

In any case, answer to this question is as follows :

  

The -m /mu found in Dravidian Sanskrit borrowings is not the dviteeyavibhakti pratyaya of Sanskrit.

  

It is the non-human gender marking suffix , which is considered to be native prathamaa vibhakti suffix by the traditional grammars , e.g., of Telugu.

  

Telugu traditional grammars list - ḍu , -mu, -vu, -lu to be the prathamaa vibhakti suffixes.

  

Among these - ḍu is masculine human gender marker. -mu and -vu are non-human gender marker. -luis a plural marker.

  

- ḍu is derived from the Dravidian \* -an . -mu is derived from the Dravidian \* -mp -vu is derived from the native Telugu word making suffix -u.  

  

- ḍu is found in native Telugu words like tammuḍu, alluḍu, vāḍu etc. and is added to the noun stems of Sanskrit borrowings for Teluguizing them as referring to masculine human entities. For example, rāmuḍu, vīruḍu, kumāruḍu etc.,

  

Similarly, -mu is found in native Telugu words like pāmu (pāmpu in Tamil)

  

It is added to the noun stems of Sanskrit borrowings for Teluguizing them as referring to non-human entities.

  

For example, vrikshamu, , sarpamu, dharmamu, dhanamu.

  

-vu is found in native Telugu words such as āvu, pūvu . It is ā+ u and pū+u respectively.

  

It is added to the -u ending noun stems of Sanskrit borrowings irrespective of gender. For example, śambhuvu, dhēnuvu, vadhuvu, dharmuvu.
