I would like to hear from Sri Suresh Kolichala regarding this. I am aware that he has a different position with regard to reconstruction of Proto-Dravidian forms. I do not know if he would derive the masculine human suffixes of Telugu, Tamil /Malayalam and Kannada from a suffix different from \*-an.

  

The 'hidden' suffix that you seem to talk about is different from -nu , the masculine human nominal suffix.

  

In halagannada or old Kannada the 'hidden' was in the form of '-m' . They call that drutamu in Telugu, literally, the molten/liquified or the meltable/liquifiable. It was/is there in classical Telugu. No longer in modern Kannada or modern Telugu.
