On Mr. Radhakrishna Warrier's question, one can find a simplistic answer that North Indian languages are either directly or indirectly derived from Sanskrit while South Indian languages are not. (This is a well known fact). Of course they have borrowed a lot of words from Sanskrit. At the same time, North Indian languages also make their own changes in Sanskrit words. The dropping of the final vowel in words like prasada in the pronunciation is no better than prasadam in Tamil.

with regards,

ramaratnam
