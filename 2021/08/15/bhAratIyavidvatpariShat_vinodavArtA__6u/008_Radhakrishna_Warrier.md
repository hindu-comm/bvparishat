ThanksShri Nagaraj ji. That was a good and helpful explanation.

  

Regarding the masculine "an" and "du" suffixes, I remember that Suresh Kolichala (he is a memberof this group) derived it from an older proto-Dravidian word (not "an") from which both the Malayalam / Tamil "an" and Telugu "du" can be derived. I vaguely remember that it is -aṉḏ, or a similar word (bothṉ and ḏ being alveolar sounds) from which both "an" and "du" are derived.

  

Regarding Kannada, I once read in another forum of the "hidden" an suffix. In Kannada, they say Rama, not Raman. But when they say "for Rama", the hidden "an" surfaces as "Ramanige" (ರಾಮನಿಗೆ).

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
