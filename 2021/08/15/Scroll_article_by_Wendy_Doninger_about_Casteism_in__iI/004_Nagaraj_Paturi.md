First demonize a system like varna or caste system. Then show every application of it as demonical. That is the game here.

  

Neither the varna nor the caste system are exclusionist, discriminatory or hierarchical. They are as much taxonomical and group forming as any contemporary social taxonomical systems or social grouping systems.

  

Hierarchical way of viewing social groups or their members exists in contemporary social groups too.

  

Certain social groups whether in ancient India or in the contemporary world are essentially hierarchical. Group of Sainyaadhyakshas and group of Sainikas are hierarchically formed groups.

  

Vernas and castes are not like that.

  

But repeated talk of these systems as bad makes the audience see their application to other entities too as bad.
