Dear Sri Gargeshwari:

  

You say that Sanskrit scholars need not be Hindus. What you are saying is passable if you feel Sanskrit is just a generic language which anyone can use; forexample to use to order a cup of tea. But in reality, Sanskrit embodies sanatana dharmic culture, its sub-sects and all the pedagogy that goes with it. It carries the entire Hindu sanskriti with it. While I can visualize Buddhist and Jain writings being written in Sanskrit even today, I cannot at all visualize Muslim and Christian writings in Sanskrit. Their concepts do not fit into Sanskrit just as English does not fit Hindu concepts into it. Indian people use the words 'spirituality', 'sin', 'God', etc., without thinking about the origin of these words. (it seems we have lost our critical analytical skills long ago). What I am pointing out is: not linking Sanskrit to Hindu (or related isms like Jainism and Buddhism) is not going to do any good to either the list members or others who might be interested in our scholarship.

  

Best Regards,  
  
Krishna
