Namaste!

  

I am a beginning student of Samskrutham, and a rasika of Indian aesthetics, culture and traditions. I am a Srividya Upasaka.

  

This is an important discussion about what BVP stands for. 

My opinion, which I offer in all humility because I know the level of scholarship here is that we must be as inclusive as possible. Cast a wide tent.

  

It seems to me that the main difference is whether we choose a *religious identity* (include the word Hindu is the description), or a *geographical/political identity* (the question about what Bharatiya means).

My view is that the most inclusive way to solve this is by anchoring it to a *linguistic identity* (Sanskrit).

  

Each of us has many layers, some of them contradictory. To slot us would be difficult. 

  

To me, Samskrutham as an anchor for this group seems to be the most inclusive.

  

With namaskarams to all,

Shoba
