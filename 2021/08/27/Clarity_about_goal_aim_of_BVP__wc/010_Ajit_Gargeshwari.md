To be a Sanskrit lover and or a full time researcher does not mean one has to to be a Hindu by faith that's all I said. Allegiance to any particular community or religion or religious group is not prerequisite to be a Sanskrit scholar a Language or Dharma expert or an expert in Shastras. Does any of your work documents, unless you are working for religions organization say one should allegiance to Hinduism and its values.
