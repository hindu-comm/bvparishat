This "Republic of India" part is ridiculous, of course - since it excludes "bhAratIya-s" who are Nepalis, Bangladeshis, Balinese, Fijians, Americans etc..

Nebulous "bhAratIya" is not satisfactory at all. Even "Indo" in Indology refers to exactly theabove, as does "South Asian"studies. They think hindutva-s are cancerous and evil,thatgangA-jamni tehzIb is the real "Indianness".

  

As long as this remains unclear, there will be confusion and conflict in this group on that account (besides plentiful other reasons).

You've already admitted that "from India" part is incorrect when responding to Krishna Kumar.

Indologists do a lot of excellent "preservation" LOL. They might even claim to enrich it with their attitude.

Correct, but too broad.

  

I don't get the hesitation: Aligning with interests of "bhAratIyas" necessarily implies aligning with Hindu interests. If this simple fact is not clear, what to say?

  

There is nothing the list gets by hiding it's hinduness. People already know who "you" (=the list) are and how you think, even if you are not self-conscious or assertive of the fact. Anti-hindutvasalready stay away (by not subscribing or participating in a limited way) no matter how much you appease them - as I said, they know what to expect (plenty of examples). Buddhists like those occasional posters who seek this or that reference will continue to use it - only because this list serves their practical needs - not because the pariShat refuses to be unapologetic aboutits identity (which is well known to them).
