Ram Ram,

  

Ajit,  

  

Allegiance of this list is implicitly to Hindus, Bharata, Deva and Dharma.  

There should be no hesitation in declaring outright explicit allegiance.  

  

Without Hindus, there is no Sanskrit. Hindu people are the ones who have preserved it in original form and made sure it continues to exist despite numerous perils.  

Watering down everything Hindu as 'Indian' may not bode well for our viz Hindu future.  

  

List can continue to do what it does; it is just the goal or allegiance that has to be very crisp and clear. That is my opinion.

  

Ram Ram,

Swapnil
