(Not sure when my post will appear on the group since I've been put under moderation apparently fearful about how I will respond to that separate accusatory post by nityAnanda - hence cc-ing a couple of people. )

Not to other people, apparently. Because, they understand that bhAratIya could mean:  

  

\- Connected with bhArata in any way (even in enmity)

\- Arising from bhArata

  

And, bhArata itself could refer to:

  

\- A geographical entity

\- A collection of ethnicities

\- Ideals espoused by bharata (who itself could be the sage or the emperor) classically held in high regard

\- Ideals espoused by people opposed to and rebelling against the above

Not to worry - Hindus are broad-minded and inclusive also - albeit not suicidal enough to allow poison pills such as opposition to hindutva.
