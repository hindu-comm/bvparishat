Sorry - I cannot grant that wish of yours. I will definitely respond to your messages when I see fit - generally in order to expose the faults therein - if not for your benefit, for the benefit of other readers and participants (my main concern).

I don't have any "maDi" when it comes to learning - I will gladly learn from anyone including you (though despite all the years, I am yet to do so).
