"One can not be as broadminded as to accept narrowmindedness towards oneself from outside as part of one's broad outlook."

  

One of the best quotes by Sri Nagaraj Paturi on the subject! Similarly, Prof. Kannan's quotes have been brilliant. Shri Gargeshwari, nothing personal in all this; but when you talk of including everything as a lofty goal, you also have to remember that if a part of the body is diseased, we excise it and save the rest. Similarly, as Prof. Kannan noted eloquently, outside forces are using our quotable quotes against us to put us on defensive, and then pouncing on us. The result of endlessly repeating these lofty statements such as 'vasudaikakutumbakam' without context and underlying framework seems to be to fool unthinking and uncritical Indians only. Forces inimical to even Sanskrit as a language use this phrase; e.g., Sheldon Pollock when he wrote that Sanskrit is a tool for oppression of the masses. As scholars, perhaps we should be even more careful than others in ensuring the dangers lurking are recognized and taken care of? Clearly, these external forces do not agree with 'vasudaika kutumbakam', else why religious conversions?
