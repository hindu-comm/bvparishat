This list is not your classroomVishasvasji neither do I ever intend to be your student. I never wished to write on anything you say on any thread but habits die hard isn'tit. Whatever I write or any memberswriteyou want to pounce upon. I don'tunderstand what your intentions are. I do notwish to know either. I do wish you would not respond to my posts at all. I wish to be guided by scholars as I have been guided by Prof. Kannan, Prof Paturi and others on this thread and
others respected members on this thread or any other thread.

  

This verse occursin Hitopadesha. Does it notoccur in the text. The context also occursin the Maha Upanishad am I wrong. The upanishad was a revelationto rishi and Panchatantra and Hitopadesh are ancient texts for learners
