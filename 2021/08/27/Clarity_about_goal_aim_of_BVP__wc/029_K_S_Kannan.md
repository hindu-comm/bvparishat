The intentions of Sri Ajit Gargeswari may be fine;

but the intentions of the abusers of the quote - so rampant -

are undoubtedly questionable.

  

After all, the present age is one of disinformation and misinformation,

as too of misinterpretation and misrepresentation.

  

The creed of today is best captured in the words of the typical lawyer:

"Get the facts first,  

we can twist them later."

  

Devils hoodwink others

by quoting the Scriptures to the very adorers of the same!

  

No amount of caveat and due diligence suffices

when you are surrounded by hypocritical foes:

*baiḍālika-vratin*-s who are *gomukha-vyāghra*-s.

  

\[*tān*\] *vāṅmātreṇapi nārcayet* !
