Ram Ram,  
  
I joined this group to discuss Hindu dharmashastra and learn from practicing Hindu sanskrit vidvaan.  
  
I see that the goal of BVP is a bit wishy washy, meandering and without any focus. One specific word is missing from it: हिंदू.  
  

In my humble opinion: BVP goal should state clearly it is Hindu centric group and group aim should be changed to following or something similar : *Group dedicated to service of देश धर्म देव. Primary area of discussion is संस्कृत सेवा. We also discuss various topics concerningभारत, हिंदूविद्वान & विद्यार्थी.*  
  
Clearly identifying the group goal will help focus on revival of Hindu society. It will help Hindu intellectuals and students who frequent this list and Hindu societyas a whole.  

  

Ram Ram,

Swapnil
