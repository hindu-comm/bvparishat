The Purpose of the group is given no where the word allegiance is mentioned what's not mentioned I always assume its not there. There is nothing to make hair splitting analysis

  

These are the definitions of allegiance from[Allegiance \| Definition of Allegiance by Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/allegiance)

1a: the obligation of a feudal vassal to his liege lord

b(1): the fidelity owed by a subject or citizen to a sovereign or government

I pledge allegiance to my country.

(2): the obligation of an alien to the government under which the alien resides

2: devotion or loyalty to a person, group, or cause

allegiance to a political party

  

I have read Buddhist , Jain etc works in Sanskrit. Sanskrit works are translated to Urdu and millions have read them. Many communities or religious groups learn to read, write communicate in Sanskrit The Objective of group need not indicate any allegiance The group explicitly has allegiance to Bharatiya (India Indianness its cultural diversity and ethos) hence to group is called 'Bharatiya Vidvat Parishad' This is my understanding and my understanding is crystal clear to my mind.

  

Whatever may be ones intention our Shastras have room for diverse and inclusive thoughts and is not restricted to any one community, religion, caste ,creed, gender.
