According to the author of Hitopadesha,Narayana, the main purpose of creating the Hitopadesha is to instruct young minds the philosophy of life in an easy way so that they are able to grow into responsible adults.

It is almost similar to the Panchatantra. The whole philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam is an integral part of the Hindu Philosophy.

  

Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam is a philosophy that inculcates an understanding that the whole world is one family.

It is a philosophy that tries to foster an understanding that the whole of humanity is one family. Iiis a social philosophy emanating from a spiritual understanding that the whole of humanity is made of one life energy. If the Parmatma is one how then an Atma can be different? If Atma is different how then can it ultimately be dissolved in the Parmatma? If the whole ocean is one how then a drop of the ocean is different from the ocean? If the drop is different from the ocean how then can it ultimately be dissolved in the ocean? It is a Sanskrit phrase meaning that the whole earth is one family. The first word is made up of three Sanskrit words - Vasudha, Eva and Kutumbakam. Vasudha means the earth, Eva means emphasizing and Kutumbakam means a family.

  

It means that the whole earth is just one family

  

"The phrase 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' is from a beautiful Sanskrit verse from the Maha Upanishad.

The meaning is basically that petty-minded people discriminate between a person who is a relative and a person who is not; but for the magnanimous ones,the whole world is one family
