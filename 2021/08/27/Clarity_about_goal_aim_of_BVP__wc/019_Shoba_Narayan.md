To clarify, I am not suggesting that we change the name of the group.

BVP has a hoary history and changing the basic name is unnecessary in my view.

I am merely suggesting that the "subtext" or the caption description of the group can be fiddled with. I suggested anchoring it on Samskrutham rather than Hindu or India, that's all.

It already seems to lean that way anyway.
