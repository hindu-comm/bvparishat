अयं निजः परो वेति गणना लघुचेतसाम्।

उदारचरितानां तु वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम्॥

  

I am not saying this about Sri Ajit-ji at all.

  

I observedthat this shloka is being invoked frequently, more frequently now than earlier, to give sermons to community from which this shloka got produced,whenever that community as a victim ofmisrepresentation anddemonizationprotests misrepresentation to make the protester feel that he is of laghuchetasif he protests, making the victim the(feel about oneself or look to others to be)culprit.

  

Predatory imperialist and expansionist NATIONs used and are using this tactic of 'there are no nations, nations are just imaginary' with their prey nations, for preying on them. . Those scholars who work for NATIONAL universities outside India use this shloka to tell Bhaarateeyas that to assert their Bhaarateeyatvais laghuchetas. Those scholars who are funded by national defence programs of nations outside India instruct Indians that to talk on the basis of Indian nation, nationalism etc. is laghuchetas.

  

Soviet Union marketed its imperialism, a world government run by it , using the slogan 'proletariat has no nation'. Many 'post-modern' academic looking politicalthought-models which clearly belong to the lineage or geneology' to use a term used by these thoughtmodels, of Marxism, are the ones which are spreading the idea of 'nations are imaginary'. 'national identities are narrow mindedness' etc.

  

This shloka has to be understood from a reference framebased understanding. You can not use the inside the train reference frame to deal with the trees and poles outside the train.

  

One can not be as broadminded as to accept narrowmindedness towards oneself from outside as part of one's broad outlook.
