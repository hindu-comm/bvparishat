With these comments i move on unless something specific on interesting is posted

Bharata of, relating to, or characteristic of India, its inhabitants, or any of their languages

Bharatiya Means a native, citizen, or inhabitant of the Republic of India  

  

You are rightThe group explicitly has allegiance to Bharatiya (India Indianness its cultural diversity and ethos) should be corrected

  

The below sentenceas on the home page is correct  

  

'भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्'is a mailing list for Sanskrit researchers working from India. The objective of the list is to understand, preserve and enrich the Indian intellectual heritage. To be explicit, this mailing list acts as a platform to share ideas and research papers in the areas of Sanskrit Research, Researches related to India, Indian Philosophy, Sanskrit Literature, Grammar, Science etc  

  

The word allegianceshould be there and is not there

  

Not to worry - Hindus are broad-minded and inclusive also - albeit not suicidal enough to allow poison pills such as opposition to hindutva.

  

I have no comments to make for the above sentence that one way of thinking
