I fully endorse the stand taken by Prof. Paturi.

  

In this warfare with words also,  

some of our own utterances of wisdom are twisted and directed right against us  

\- merely to dilute and weaken our stand against the predatory and intolerant forces

with their shibboleths of Peace & Mercy & Freedom,

and verily the three perpetual enemies of humanity.

  

To be tolerant of the intolerance of the intolerant

is the right royal road to suicide.
