Respected members,

  

I have been searching for a text titledprakaṭārthadīpikā

written by Kerala astronomerGovindasvāmin in the 9th

century CE, which is the only surviving commentary on the

bṛhat parāśara horā śāstra. I was able to find a few manuscripts

of the text from SML Tanjore, French Institute ofPodicherry

Library and Mysore ORI but all of them were incomplete, missing

most except for the bhashya on few of the 20 adhyayas of the

uttarakhaṇḍa(the full text has 100 chapters). Has anyone studied

or seen the complete text?

  

Best regards,

Saurabh Sharma
