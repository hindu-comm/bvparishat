Namaskaram ji,  
  
I am Sibi Raj working on the Illustrated Encyclopedia of Indian History Project. It's about bringing Indic knowledge systems such as mathematics, astronomy city building etc (22 topics - 450 pages ) in 1500+ colourful oil painting illustrations.  
  
I am registering an NGO to manage the funds for the same.   
  
Therefore I have been looking for a nice sanskrit name that reflects the core essence of Indian civilization.  
  
It would be great, if you could give me some beautiful sanskrit names that I can verify for the availability during registration. I thought of Anubhuti or Subhodini, but am also thinking of other suggestions. Thanks a lot.üôèüôè  
  
Here is the link to the project:

Pranam.
