Dear Nityanand ji,

My daughter's name is धृता. She was born some five months after her elder मौसी's daughter, who was named माया. After a week or so when we took her to the hospital, nurses and helpers asked her name. When we told them her name they were apparently lost and one of them quickly said, why didn't you choose a *simple*name like छाया, माया's sister.

Best regards,

Hemant
