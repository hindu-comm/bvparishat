On this #Sanskritday #संस्कृतदिनम्, we are happy to announce the completion of the #Sanskrit #Panchatantra video series project. Here is the website dedicated for #पञ्चतन्त्रम् #कथाकथनम्  
  
<https://www.panchatantra-sanskrit.com/>  
  
What started two years back as a fun project to introduce kids to the original #Sanskrit #Panchatantra , now has 7.5hrs worth of videos that includes all the thread stories of all the 5 tantras and sub-stories in them.  
  
Narrated mostly by kids, each video has #Devanagari script with English translation. The perfect Sanskrit pronunciation and diction by the students of #Samskritam is really worth listening to.  
  
The intention behind this project is to popularize the original #Sanskrit #Panchatantra, as we felt that most of the Panchatantra story books have lost the essence and don't really retain the structure or the contents from the original.  
  
More about the intention of this project can be seen in this introductory video in Samskritam:

We humbly request you to watch/listen to these stories and share this effort on this occasion of #WorldSanskritDay
