Respected members,

  

I was going through a Sanskrit text where I found the following verse which probably gives the date of composition of the work -

  

षष्ठिं करकरगुणिं व्यपगतसंवत्सरेण सम्मिश्रं नवगगनाब्दिसमेतं शकनृपकालं विजानीयात्  

  

Though I understood that it gives the Saka year, the rest I got only in bits - षष्ठिं : (sixty / sixth?),करकरगुणिं (2, 2, 3 (?) in bhutasamkya), नवगगनाब्दि (9, 0, 4 (?) again in bhutasamkya). Can someone guide me on how to interpret it?Any help would be appreciated!

(PS - the text is south Indian, most likely from coastal Andhra)

  

Best regards,

Saurabh Sharma
