The text in question is Tithicakra authored by Narasimha (in the 19th century, as the corrected verse suggests,

also mentioned in David Pingree's Census Of The Exact Sciences In Sanskrit - Volume A3).

The following is original verse in Telugu, the errors might have been due to the transliteration to Devanagari :

  

షష్ఠిం కరకరగుణిం వ్యపగతసంవత్సరేణ సమ్మిశ్రం నవగగనాబ్దిసమేతం శకనృపకాలం విజానీయాత్  

  

Thank you for for the reference and correction.
