On Sanskrit Day, some observations regarding regional differences in speech:

  

भाषावैविध्यपञ्चकम्  

  

दाक्षिणात्याः प्रियक्लीवा महादीर्घास्तु मागधाः।  
कर्णाटेकर्णटङ्कारः सर्वमौष्ठ्यं तु वङ्गके॥१  
  
"The Southerners like words in the neuter gender. The Magadhas use elongated vowels. In Karnataka, the sound of "twang" (of a bow) falls in one's ears. In Bengal, everything is uttered by compressing one's lips (औष्ठ्य)."  

  

उच्चैर् घोषः कुरुक्षेत्रे विदेहा मन्दभाषिणः।  
पञ्चसिन्धौ महावेगः पर्वते सर्वगीतकम्॥२  
  
"In Haryana, people speak loudly while in Mithila, they speak very softly (or slowly). In Punjab, speech is very fast while in the mountains, everything is sing-song!”  

  

मरौ न सहयोर्भेदस् तेषामाशीर् भयङ्करा।  
गुर्जरे वाक्यकार्पण्यं तद्बुद्धिर् व्यवसायिनी॥३  
  
"In Rajasthan, there is no difference between स/श and ह. Thus, their blessing is to be feared (शतायुः स्यात् --> हतायुः स्यात्) . In Gujarat, there is thrift in speech because their minds are business-like."  

  

मध्यदेशे वचोहास्यं नेपाले शसदिग्भ्रमः।  
महाराष्ट्रे ळसर्वस्वं दीर्घमात्रारुचिस्तथा॥४  
  
"In Madhya Bharata, there is always laughter in speech. In Nepal, there is confusion between श and स. In Maharashtra, everything has ळ and there is fondness for long मात्रा-s."  

  

ऋकारोच्चारणे नूनं कवयोऽप्यत्र मोहिताः।  
ज्ञकारोच्चारणे सर्वे प्राकृताः संस्कृता जनाः॥५  
  
"On the question of the pronunciation of ऋ, even the poets are deluded. And while pronouncing ज्ञ, all refined men are but Prakritas (today’s ज्ञ pronunciation-styles are derived from the Prakritas)."  

  

कस्य शुद्धास्ति वाणीह कश्च शुद्धिं विधास्यति।  
तत्रानिकेतसूक्तिर्यद् बन्धो मे पठ संस्कृतम्॥६  
  
Whose speech is completely pure here? And who can determine the criteria for purity. Therefore, the poet Aniket has summarized it well: “My friend! Learn Sanskrit!”  

  

Best,

Kushagra
