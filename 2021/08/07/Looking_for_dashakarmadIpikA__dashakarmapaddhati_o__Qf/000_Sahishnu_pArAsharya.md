I am looking for the text / scan of theDaśakarmadīpikā / Daśakarmapaddhati of Paśupati (a Yajurvediya paddhati). It appears as "Daśakarmapaddhati. Yv. by Paśupati. L. 1528. NW. 96. Sūcīpattra. 77." inAufrecht’s.

  

I'm not sure if it has been published; if so, is a scan available of the manuscript anywhere?

  

Bhavadeva's Samavediya paddhati seems to have received more attention, but I can't seem to be able to find Pasupati's work, even though they are numerous references to it.

  

Any help is greatly appreciated.
