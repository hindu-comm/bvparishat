Moonlit Night of Onam ![üôÇ](https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/SXSP9C5yXkz2FFB4TRg4vyBoYfBGh0mSCoEJ9RIUIEgz978PChDtuwmxkkj41MCpbGI8lRa_kR0W-KrfPDggqC-aNDVs6Om5-8v1OIsZbsNSxBZf98Pv=s0-d-e1-ft#https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/ta5/1.5/16/1f642.png)

----------------------------

Onam is just two weeks away, on August 20 in Seattle. 

Onam is associated with its beautiful moonlit night dear to poets, and also to non-poets like this humble self . Can we expect Onam nights to be beautifully moonlit, year after year? If yes, why?

Let us dig a little into astronomy (not astrology) to find out why. In astronomy we have an imaginary ‚Äúcelestial sphere‚Äù which is the sky that surrounds us here on earth. As viewed from the earth, there is on this sphere a great circle called ‚Äúecliptic‚Äù which is the apparent path the sun traces annually against the background of the starry firmament. Over the ecliptic is a ‚Äúbelt‚Äù approximately 16¬∞ wide called the circle of zodiac in English and RƒÅ≈õi Chakra in Sanskrit. See the highly simplified figure below that I drew for this post. Also, here is more information on celestial sphere and the ecliptic [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_sphere?fbclid=IwAR1XPsit0SqeAumV44pAxhnV9m3mflCPfsWO5989NTJBbrVL3EKxz9FEOe0)and here is more on zodiac [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac?fbclid=IwAR2k-r6Y5a_1lZI7rD-YhNVtbkjlbvQL9gmfPIVuCZ-4gm9nkcHz4okMF2c).

We know that in both ancient Indian astronomy and ancient Greek astronomy, the zodiac was divided into 12 segments of 30¬∞ each (360¬∞/12 = 30¬∞). These segments are defined by constellations of stars called RƒÅ≈õi in Sanskrit. In addition to this, in Indian astronomy, the zodiac was divided also into 27 segments (of approximately 360¬∞/27 = 13¬∞20‚Äô each) called nak·π£hatra and each of these nakshatras was named after a prominent star in or near to it. In English, the nakshatras are called ‚Äúasterisms‚Äù, or denoted by a more picturesque term ‚Äúlunar mansions‚Äù.

One of the 27 nakshatras is ≈örava·πáa (‚Äú≈å·πáam‚Äù in Malayalam). It is in the zodiacal constellation of Makara which is roughly equivalent to the Capricorn of Western Astronomy. The festive day of Onam arrives when the moon is in ≈örava·πáa in the month of Chingam. The month of Chingam is so named because in that month the sun transits the zodiacal constellation of ‚ÄúSimha‚Äù. "Chingam‚Äù = Sanskrit ‚ÄúSimha‚Äù = English ‚ÄúLion‚Äù; Simha RƒÅ≈õi is roughly equivalent to the constellation of Leo in Western Astronomy.
On the day of Onam in any year, the angle between the sun and the moon, as viewed from earth, (angle SEM) will be between 130¬∞ (angle CED) and 173¬∞ (angle AEB) as shown in the figure below. Full moon occurs when the sun is opposite the moon. In other words, it is a full moon when the angular separation between the sun and the moon is near 180¬∞. With an angular separation between 130¬∞ and 173¬∞, it might not be a full moon but just one to four days before it. This means that the Onam night will be beautifully moonlit in any year provided the sky is not overcast. In Kerala, the monsoon retreats for a while during the Onam season before making a thunderous reappearance in October ‚Äì November.
So, the skies are mostly clear during the Onam season. Let me expect clear skies and a beautiful moonlit night on the day of Onam here in the Pacific Northwest of US, as in Kerala ![üôÇ](https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/SXSP9C5yXkz2FFB4TRg4vyBoYfBGh0mSCoEJ9RIUIEgz978PChDtuwmxkkj41MCpbGI8lRa_kR0W-KrfPDggqC-aNDVs6Om5-8v1OIsZbsNSxBZf98Pv=s0-d-e1-ft#https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/ta5/1.5/16/1f642.png).

Tailpiece

----------

It appears that the logic behind reckoning festival days based on nakshatra and the solar month is to ensure a fairly consistent phase of the moon for the festive day, year after year. This method of reckoning is fine but if the correction required for the precession of equinoxes ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAxial_precession%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2sDYJ5VV0_-EJmmAo_sdKYHOzP8ryod6ZFYdrORIqgA_rtH1m8Ajti9Pg&h=AT3EKAYq3toD9zsDFnB1INMFitA7XGUqEL_2oxEuHOiGf2NHrIQr3K_WJ03oR4TNykzHJfnQkj9iDZoQEJPHiBI5pJc453HhspcLUiyzAsnes5k5aTBE9jswTni-dc9YmI1lxIASjyzjpUReUw&__tn__=-UK-R&c%5B0%5D=AT3pQrAfBn7Dhs4l6J99RVjEIM3luj0_rfgnRF4tbUMV2Ozw-6HcAotxLGF_tygNT9Mh_GE_ZH5KeY7cacCSdWAfCUplp1Y8hURz69QnM4cr-r8dOpecZr8HSDUlYFK4us3gfcjtuE5E83zmMaOf_NjBtUA)) is not done, the festive days will move in the seasons. We know that Makara Sa·πÖkrƒÅnti (Sun‚Äôs entry into Makara constellation) and the start of UttarƒÅya·πáa (sun‚Äôs movement towards north) coincided about 1800 years ago but now have moved apart by about 25 days because the correction was not applied. If we do the correction, the festivals will be in season but will slowly lose their alignment with the stars to which they are aligned now. You are damned either way ![üôÇ](https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/SXSP9C5yXkz2FFB4TRg4vyBoYfBGh0mSCoEJ9RIUIEgz978PChDtuwmxkkj41MCpbGI8lRa_kR0W-KrfPDggqC-aNDVs6Om5-8v1OIsZbsNSxBZf98Pv=s0-d-e1-ft#https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/ta5/1.5/16/1f642.png).

Another event going to happen soon is a "Blue Moon" . Immediately following this year‚Äôs Onam is a ‚Äúblue moon‚Äù on August 22. What is a blue moon? It is the third of four full moons in a season. Four full moons in a season of 3 months is rare and happens roughly once in three years. Hence the expression "once in a blue moon."
