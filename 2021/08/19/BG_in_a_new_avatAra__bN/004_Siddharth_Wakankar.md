I remember a very important experience.

  

We were staying in the Guest House of the Devaswom in Cochin in 2007.

  

We were surprised early in the morning because we heard recorded Marathi bhajanas in the Temple. I asked my friend, Dr.Bhat,the Director of the Sukritindra Research Institute,about it and he said, though we don't understand Marathi,these are traditionally sung by all the followers and they even printed these Marathi bhajanas in Malayalam.He further said that due to persecution,they left Maharashtra and settled in Kerala,but,did not abandon or forget their roots.

  

The only other stotra sung or played there is the Mahishasuramardinistotra.

  

A very pleasant surprise to us.
