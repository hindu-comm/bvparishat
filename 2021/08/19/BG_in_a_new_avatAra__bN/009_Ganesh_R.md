Namaskaara,

  

Apartfrom Naagarasa, perhaps the first translator of the Geetaa in Kannada, many have rendered it in verse. But except Sri. Kadava Shambhu Sharma, a great scholar, all others have employed simple maatraa-jaati varieties for their translations. Sharma has rendered the Geetaa in vRtta-s. He has assiduously followed the original metres and has employed dignified classical Kannada. His fidelity to the import of the text is also remarkable. It is rather unfortunate that nit many know people, including the scholars know this unique work. Apartfrom this, Sri. P.T. Narasimhacharya's (well known by his pen name Pu. Ti. Na) verse-rendition is lucid and poetic.

  

With warm regards

  

  

Ganesh
