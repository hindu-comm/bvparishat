Namaste  

  

There is a similar Gita in Kannada Keertanas by the late Sank Keshavdas. Its name is Keertanaroopini Gita.

  

It is the same Sant Keshavadas who built the Vishwa Shanti Ashrama in Bengaluru. The famous temple of Vishwa Rupa Darshana has all the 700 Gita shlokas carved inside the temple. Very nice and peaceful place to visit.
