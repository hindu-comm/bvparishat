Dear friends,

  

ऐ and औ in spoken colloquial Hindi are pronounced as अँ and ऑ as in apple and ox in English. The point is why did these vowel sounds not become a part of Sanskrit language when they are so common in world languages.

  

What forbids their usage in Sanskrit?

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
