What was the ancient pronunciation of ai (ऐ) and au (औ) in Sanskrit? 

In modern south Indian languages and modern Indo Aryan languages like Marathi and Gujarati, the pronunciation is a+I and a+u respectively.
However, in standard Hindi and Punjabi, it is different. Ai is pronounced somewhat like ae and au is pronounced almost like ‘o’ but with a small variation.

I have a vague memory of my high school Malayalam teacher saying that ai is actually a conjunct of a and e but pronounced like the conjunct of a and i. I believe the standard Hindi and Punjabi pronunciation came from Persian pronunciation through Urdu. I suspect that diphthongs ai and au vanished from Indo Aryan a long time ago as they became e and o in Prakrits and later Apabhramshas. Ai and au re-entered modern Indo Aryan through Sanskrit tatsamas. I have also heard Biharis and people from eastern UP pronouncing the Hindi wordकैसे as kaise and not as the standard Hindi kaese.
