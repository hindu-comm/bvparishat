Dear list members

  

Some online Bangla dictionaries list a wordঐন্দ্রিলা (aindrilā) and give the meaning asবৃত্রাসুরের কন্যা (“daughter of Vṛtrāsura”). An example is here:

  

[www.ovidhan.org/b2b/ঐন্দ্রিলা](http://www.ovidhan.org/b2b/%E0%A6%90%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%A6%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BE)  

  

1\) Is this true? Does the word mean that in Bangla?

2\) I do not think this word comes from Sanskrit. Does anybody know a reference to this word (or a character named Aindrilā) in Sanskrit texts?

  

Thanks, Nityananda
