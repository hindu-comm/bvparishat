Very good work, and thanks to Sh. Neelesh. You have done a phenomenal job. I use your websitevery frequently to look up commentaries on the Ashtadhyayi.

  

I have a request (had the same request for sanskrit.today website). Can you please also includeSanskrit-German dictionaries in your database. I believe you have the data from the Universität zu Köln website. They have multiple Sanskrit-German dictionaries[here](https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/).

  

1.  Böhtlingk and Roth Grosses Petersburger Wörterbuch 2.  Grassmann Wörterbuch zum Rig Veda 3.  Böhtlingk Sanskrit-Wörterbuch in kürzerer Fassung 4.  Cappeller Sanskrit Wörterbuch 5.  Schmidt Nachträge zum Sanskrit-Wörterbuch

  

The advantage? Often we need the original*koṣa* citations which modern dictionaries rely on. Böhtlingk and Roth Grosses Petersburger Wörterbuch is quite useful and often gives many citations not present in other dictionaries. As an example, look at entries for*kiraṇa*right now under<https://kosha.sanskrit.today/word/sa/kiraNa>or [https://ashtadhyayi.com/kosha/#word=किरण](https://ashtadhyayi.com/kosha/#word=किरण). Multiple dictionaries (Apte, Wilson, Shabda-Sagar, Monier-Wiliams) include "the sun" as a meaning, but none of them gives a precise citation. Monier-Williams just says L (for Lexicographers), a vague reference which is not helpful. Now look at the entry in Böhtlingk and Roth Grosses Petersburger Wörterbuch:<https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/PWGScan/2020/web/webtc2/index.php>. It states "3) *Sonne* H. 95." (die Sonne = the sun in German). The H reference is to Hemacandra's *Abhidhānacintāmaṇi* and with the exact verse number 95, and so we know where we can trace the masculine word*kiraṇa*as a synonym of the sun in the original*koṣa*s. Indeed, the reference is in the*Abhidhānacintāmaṇi* and in verse 95:

  

आदित्यः सवितार्यमा खरसहस्रोष्णांशुरंशू रविर्मार्तण्डस्तरणिर्गभस्तिररुणो भानुर्नभोऽहर्मणिः।

सूर्योऽर्कः **किरणो** भगो ग्रहपुषः पूषा पतङ्गः खगो मार्ताण्डो यमुनाकृतान्तजनकः प्रद्योतनस्तापनः॥ ९५ ॥

  

So I believe adding Sanskrit-German dictionaries on sanskrit.today or [ashtadhyayi.com](http://ashtadhyayi.com) would help a lot.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
