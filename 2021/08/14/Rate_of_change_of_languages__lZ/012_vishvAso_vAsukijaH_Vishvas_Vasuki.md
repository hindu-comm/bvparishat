I see - so the disagreement was about the mahAprANa घ . Fine (though I'd think that ancient tamiL dvija elite would've used mahAprANa appropriately). What is the basis of admitting the possibility thatचङ्गम् was ancient tam pronunciation? Occam's razor would causes us to forgo unnecessary assumptions.  
  
That apart, my main point in disagreeing with "“Caṅkam” in Tamil, transliterated often as Sangam" still stands:Perhaps you meant to write: “Caṅkam” in Tamil script (Vaṭṭeḻuttŭ to be precise), transliterated often as Sangam.
