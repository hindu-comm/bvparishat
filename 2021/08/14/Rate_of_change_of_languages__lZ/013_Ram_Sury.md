Namaste Radhakrishna Warrier ji,

  

I must differ from your apparently linear approach moving from Vedic to Classical Sanskrit to Prakrit to Apabhramsa to modern vernaculars (and thereby attempting tocompare their perceived rates of change). That is not an apples-to-apples comparison.  
  
This straight line approach does not really work because we do not have any evidence that Prakrit '**evolved steadily/gradually & naturally'**from any kind of Old-Indic (either Vedic or classical sanskrit).

  

There is no evidence (but there has been plenty of unsubstantiated academic speculation) that the language was gradually getting prakritized all through the vedic period - which in fact is not at all in evidence (when we look at all the literature between the Rgveda Samhita and Panini, neither is the language of the texts themselves getting more and more systematically prakritized gradually, nor is there even any explicit or implicit claim made by any of the authors of those texts that the common language was evolving in such a direction) and therefore, that is a hypothesis I reject in-toto.  
  
There was clear awareness for Yaska, Sakalya, Panini etc that the Vedic samhita & brahmana language were earlier stages of the language compared to laukika bhasha (classical sanskrit) of their own time. If Prakrit follows sanskrit/vedic in such a gradual evolutionary paradigm, Patanjali or other grammarians would have known and mentioned such an evolution of Old-Indic into Middle-Indic (and there is no reason to believe that he wouldn't have understood that such a gradual evolution from Old-Indic to middle-Indic was happening or had happened).

  

The reality however is that there is clear and conclusive evidence that Classical Sanskrit is following on in the same linguistic tradition of late-Vedic; late vedic frommiddle-Vedic; and middle-vedic from early-vedic - as per all available evidence (and there is no gradual prakritization evident throughout the vedic period from the literary and other evidence) - therefore the early-Prakrit (as evident in the Ashokan edicts) does not represent an evolutionary stage from Old-Indo-Aryan.  
  
How then did early-Prakrit arise apparently as a distinct linguistic Indo-Aryan register **contemporaneous** to late-vedic/classical sanskrit - and what can we make of this **evolutionary discontinuity** that is clearly evident between Vedic/Sanskrit & Prakrit (without relying on evidence that doesn't exist)?  
  
In my understanding late-Vedic**/**classical-sanskrit) and early-prakrit (for eg. Ashokan epigraphy in Kharosthi & Brahmi, Buddhist Tripitaka originally written in Kharosthi & Brahmi) are not two different chronological or even linguistic stages of Indo-Aryan (although they might appear to be so when seen superficially). They are exactly the same language - the former being the spoken language; the other the written language -- of the same people at the sameperiod of time.

  
What we call 'Early-Prakrit' is evident only from the point when writing was introduced in Kharosthi and Brahmi i.e. just before or during the start of the Mauryan era (there was also some Persian linguistic superstrate influence on early Prakrit as writing was introduced from Persia during the Achaemenid rule of Gandhara).  
  
*The practical limitations/difficulties of the early Kharosthi & Brahmi scripts forced the scribes to avoid long vowels (in Kharosthi), avoid complex-syllables (in Brahmi) etc. These are purely orthographic/written phenomena*.The spoken language of the Mauryan era was still late-Vedic/Sanskrit -- which appears as early-Prakrit when put down in popular writing/edicts due to the above orthographic conventions. This is why we do not find Sanskrit/Vedic writings in the Mauryan era - not because Sanskrit was not written but because we misinterpret its written form(s) to be early-Prakrit (i.e. a different language). We are misled by the orthographic simplifications introduced in the early centuries of writing - and we assume those orthographic simplifications to constitute linguistic evolution.  
  
Classical sanskrit and early prakrit are from the same period, and their literaturerefer to the same culture and sometimes even the same people (apparently speaking the same language). In later centuries (after Mauryan & Sunga periods), there was no need for any Sanskrit revival because Sanskrit prevailed as the spoken language all through the last 5 centuries of the 1st millenium BCE.

  
However due to the influence of the artificial orthographic conventions used in the written language, people had started mispronouncing the words in actual speech. This led to the orthographic innovations getting linguistic legitimacy (and prakrits arose as full-fledged languages mainly in the 1st millenium of the common era). Hence प्रकृतिः संस्कृतम् । तत्र भवं ततः आगतं वा प्राकृतम्। (Sanskrit is the prakṛti i.e. natural language/source language. Prākṛt is so called because it is created with prakṛti/Sanskrit as its base). Prakrits were predominantly literary languages, not ethnic dialects. The actual spoken ethnic dialects of the common era that succeeded late-Vedic/Sanskrit were to a certain extent influenced by prakrits but were not prakrits themselves.  
  
In the Ramayana, Hanumān does not speak to Sītā in prakrit nor does she speak to him in Prakrit. The saṃskṛtāṃ vācam that he wants to avoid speak to Sītā is a variety of sanskrit (with vedic svaras) that was commonly used only by the dvijātis. So he speaks to her in plain unaccented sanskrit which is the same language she speaks to him in. So the Rāmāyaṇa does not imply the existence of Prakrit as a separate language, when it was composed.  
  
So Sanskrit/Vedic to early-Prakrit was not separated by a time period and does not have a measurable rate of change during that period.  
  
Regards,

Ramakrishnan Suryanarayanan
