ThanksProf. Deshpande ji. The use of large linguistic databases and their analysis is quite interesting. Hope they are able to add to their databases and come up with more probable results. This remindsme of Lord Kelvin's quote “When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it..."

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna
