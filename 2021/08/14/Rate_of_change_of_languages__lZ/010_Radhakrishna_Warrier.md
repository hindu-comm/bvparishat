"Are you saying that tamiLs say सङ्घम् or सङ्गम् instead of "चङ्कम्" ? And that ancient tamils were the reverse?"

  

No, I did not say that. I was just responding to your following statement:

“IIUC it **is indeed Saṅgham in tamiL language**.”

What I said was that **Saṅgham is *not* a word of Tamil language**.

The following is what I said:

*"Caṅkam" is the Tamil tadbhava of Sanskrit " Saṅgham". The Sanskrit word underwent phonological changes to be accepted in Tamil language. **But the original word " Saṅgham" is not Tamil anymore.** Tamil does not have the voiced aspirate "gh" and a large majority of Tamilians are unable to correctly pronounce the sound…”*

I didn’t say anything about the ancient pronunciation of the word. Just said that the word is Caṅkam and that in Tamil, “c” and “s” are allophones as are “k” and “g”. They are not different phonemes. The modern pronunciation (by Tamils) is predominantly as Saṅgam.

Since you asked about pronunciation without recourse to the Tamil script, here is the little I know about ancient and modern Tamil.

Tamil, ancient or modern, does not have the aspirated consonants (called mahāprāṇa in Sanskrit) ख, घ, छ, झ, ठ, ढ, थ, ध, फ, and भ. So, the gh of **Saṅgham** cannot be part of Tamil. 

The sounds श, स, and ज are allophones of च in Tamil. In intervocalic position, च becomes either श or स. In geminate form, it remains च्च . In word initial positions, as far as I know, in ancient Tamil the pronunciation was most probably च (though श and स cannot be ruled out) but in modern Tamil it can be either श or स (someone more knowledgeable in Tamil can correct me.) ग and ह are allophones of क. In word-initial position, it is always क. Intervocalic, it can be either ग or ह. In a conjunct letter after a nasal (such as ङ) it becomes ग. In other words, ङ्क is pronounced asङ्ग.

With this as background, the ancient Tamil pronunciation of Caṅkam could have been one of these three: चङ्गम्, शङ्गम्, or सङ्गम्, but not सङ्घम्.
There is a good probability that it was चङ्गम् but the other two cannot be ruled out. Modern Tamil pronunciation is either सङ्गम् or शङ्गम्.

So, my original reply to you was just to say that you were not correct in saying that “it **is indeed Saṅgham in tamiL language.”**
