"*IIUC it is indeed Saṅgham in tamiL **language**. Perhaps you meant to write:“Caṅkam” in Tamil **script**, transliterated often as Sangam.*"

  

IIUC - "if I understand correctly". Yes, your understanding is partly correct. "Caṅkam" is the Tamil tadbhava of Sanskrit " Saṅgham". The Sanskrit word underwent phonological changes to be accepted in Tamil language. But the original word " Saṅgham" is not Tamil anymore. Tamil does not have the voiced aspirate "gh" and a large majority of Tamilians are unable to correctly pronounce the sound. "C" and "s" are allophones in Tamil and are not different phonemes. So are "k" and "g". Hence, the Tamil word is Caṅkam which is nowadays pronounced as Saṅgam and hence transliterated in English as Sangam.
