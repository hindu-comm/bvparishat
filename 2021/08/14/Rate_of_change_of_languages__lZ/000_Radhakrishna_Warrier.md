The rate of change of languages seems to be very different for different languages and in different time periods.

Vedic Sanskrit and Paninian Sanskrit are separated perhaps by two millennia. Yet the change that the Vedic language underwent to become the Paninian language is not vast. Perhaps less than what Hindi has changed from the time of Tulsidas to now. 

Also, the difference between Sanskrit and the different Prakrits are really not much. It is more of phonological simplification than change in grammar or sentence structure. A person knowledgeable in Sanskrit would be able to follow the different varieties of Prakrit without much difficulty. But the difference between Prakrits and modern Indo-Aryan languages is substantial. More than phonology, it is sentence structure and grammar that has changed significantly.

Tamil is another example. The same name “Tamil” is applied to the different varieties of spoken languages in modern Tamil Nadu and the language of the literature of the period of Saṅgham (“Caṅkam” in Tamil, transliterated often as Sangam), but they differ much more than say Vedic Sanskrit and Prakrit. A native speaker of modern varieties of Tamil has to learn the Tamil of Sangam literature as if it were a different language. Without learning, it would not be intelligible to him/her. The time that separates Vedic Sanskrit and Prakrit could perhaps be more than that which separates Sangam Tamil from modern spoken varieties of Tamil.
