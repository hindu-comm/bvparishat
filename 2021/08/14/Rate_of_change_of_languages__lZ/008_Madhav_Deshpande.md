Thanks, Radhakrishna Ji. I guessed that is what you meant. There is a recent development in the work of some linguists like Don Ringe of the University of Pennsylvania and his colleagues who use massive linguistic databasesto calculate historical connections between languages, or branchings of the members of a linguistic family. Interestingly, some of their results come close to the traditionally understood branchings of a family like the Indo-European language family. However, the quality and the quantity of the linguistic data available for ancient languages varies considerably, and hence the results of such calculations always remain probable rather than certain. However, it is better to have probable results, than have no results at all. With best regards,
