Dear Radhakrishna Ji,

  

What statistics or data have you used to calculate this rate of change?

  

"Vedic Sanskrit and Paninian Sanskrit are separated perhaps by two millennia. Yet the change that the Vedic language underwent to become the Paninian language is not vast.Perhaps less than what Hindi has changed from the time of Tulsidas to now."
