Dear Sastryji,

  

You say that everything is not articulate. Had it been so would it have been possible for a treatise like the Ashtadhyayi to have ever been compiled?

  

Corrupt languages are a product of misplaced articulation and so one can say that they stand on shaky ground. However that is not the case with Sanskrit moresoever of Paninian Sanskrit.

  

Secondly once the pratyayas are changed the word form itself undergoes corruption. This probably is the main reason for changing languages.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
