Namaste Karve ji



Every thing is not articulate and expanded ! From the pointers provided one needs to build practical systems.



Patanjali: दुष्टः शब्दः, स्वरतो **वर्णतो** वा .. ; Aparadha kshamaa : विसर्ग-बिन्दु-मात्राणि, पद-पाद-**अक्षराणि** च ..... ; **यदक्षर-पद-भ्रष्टं** , मात्रा-**हीनं** च - यद्भवेत् । **तत्सर्वं** क्षम्यतां .......



When ‘visarga- bindu’ are technically not independent ‘aksharas ( svara or vyanjana)’ - why are they inclusively considered in the ‘list of corruptions’ in prarthana –mantra- viniyogas’ asking ‘ kshamaa’ ?



And why such care has survived for few millennia ? And why did ‘ special community people’ considered ‘ Panini/ shikshaa Code: Samskruth’ so important ?
