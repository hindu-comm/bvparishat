Dear Prof. Deshpande ji, I did not actually do any statistical analysis. This is more of a general observation. Although I can speak, read, and understand modern Hindi to a good extent, I am not able to understand the dohas of Tulsidas (in fact, most Hindi dohas irrespective of the author) unless someone explains to me the meaning. So, the difference in language is significant. What I find (not my personal experience, because I never learnt Sanskrit) is that those who have learnt Classical Sanskrit quite well, but have not learnt Vedic specifically, are able to understand the Vedic language although nuances might escape them. These people are also able to understand to a good extent Prakrits as found in Sanskrit dramas. This was the basis of my statement in the original post.

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna
