Namo namah.

Very nice to see One Narasimhastakam brought by you.

There is another Narasimhastakam written in 13th Century by Saumyajamatrmuni. I think you might have heard.

I have translated it into Telugu and published in the magazine Nrisimhapriya of Ahobila Muth, Hyderabad.

With Regards

Prof. Sampathkumaracharya

National Sanskrit University, Tirupati.
