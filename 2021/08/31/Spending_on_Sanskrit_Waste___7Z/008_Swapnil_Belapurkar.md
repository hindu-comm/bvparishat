Ram Ram,

  

Current state of Sanskrit in TN is predictor of future of Sanskrit in Bharata.

  

In 93 an affidavit was submitted by then govt to Supreme Court putting Sanskrit alongside real dead languages such as lepcha.

  

In 2004-14 decade, Sanskrit was systematically removed from schools all across Bharata and various syllabus. Schools now offer foreign languages completely irrelevant to Hindu kids but not Sanskrit.

  

A dedicated central college offering advanced courses in sanskrit (run exclusively by Hindus) would have really helped. But it hasn't happened in last 7 years.

  

Certain ideologies (imported from abroad) are extremely hostile to Sanskrit. They are leading De-Sanskritization effort in various states. This is an extension of AIT garbage that seeks to de-legitimize Sanskrit in Bharata while promoting it elsewhere where it has no relation at all.

  

We Hindus can only do what we can i.e. learn it ourselves to the best extent and teach to kids. Rest will be bhagvad iccha.

  

I truly believe though that even if fools are choking funds to Sanskrit studies hoping to kill it, Sanskrit will remain and if such time comes will be again be revealed to a worthy Hindu rishi.

  

Ram Ram,

Swapnil
