Friends,

This is not a criticism, but an observation.  

This list itself is gradually degrading from a study group to an opinionated social group in a span of five years.

It may not be obvious to you if you are in close proximity or are totally new. The participation by members has  

thinned out and the respect for discussion has waned.  

My personal view is that Sanskrit revival is a function of reviving the analytic inquiry that the medium championed

and established as a foundation of scholarship.. Sectarianism or sloppy assumptions in the name of upholding  

the tradition are not helping the cause of Sanskrit.  Possibly a revival would be engineered by widespread  

encouragement to appreciate literature, which may take its own time.

We must admire the individuals who are applying the language for creative expressions and continue to appreciate

the precision of expression as a property of the use of language as a tool of human expression. Reducing the

creative mapping in Sanskrit to phonetic expressions in other human languages has been a possible willful  

disservice that refuses to appreciate the creative aspect of human speech.

This is a personal view of a scientist who believes that Sanskrit phonetics belongs in human neurology.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
