Namonamaḥ,

  

Perhaps this is the program under reference (Streamed live on 30 Aug 2021):  
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m0vk9IFpVc>  
  
In general, programs like these are fairly frequent inTamil Nadu TV Channels - and usually involve lots of bilious rants (these rants cannot be countered by logic) - however there is also plenty of genuine cluelessness about Sanskrit and its relevance to India and to Tamil Nadu.  
  
We do need to have genuine reasoned answers at least to reduce the general cluelessness.  
  
Perhaps someone can compile the points being discussed and suggest appropriate responses.  
  
Thanks,

Ramakrishnan Suryanarayanan
