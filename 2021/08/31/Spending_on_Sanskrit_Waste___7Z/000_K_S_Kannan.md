I was told that there was a fierce debate today in some Tamil channel,

charging that the Central Govt was spending a great deal on Sanskrit,

all wasted on a useless language.  

  

The fellow representing the Sanskrit side, presumably one from BJP, apparently cut a sorry figure, saying it was useful to look into the past, and did not impress the participants/the audience.  

  

Has anybody in the List watched it? Can someone raise here the questions that were asked there? Answers from members the List may be pooled and supplied to the fellow (or even others) who want to argue for Sanskrit..
