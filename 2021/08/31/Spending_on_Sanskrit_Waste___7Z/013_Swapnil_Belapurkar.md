Dear Sri Bijoy Misra,  
As one of the least scholarly members on bvp I constantly look forward to your posts which act like pillars of solid bone for me to hold onto in the midst of a raging plasma of grey matter.

You truly belong and enrich this space as Peeves does Hogwarts. Expeditions to india discovery have frequently been derailed by the likes of columbusmama and Vascodagama.  
I am however sure that under your able stewardship the India Discovery center of Harvard will successfully dock in kumari kandam and we will all be the richer for the experience.  
  
Sincerely  
A big fan  
Swapnil
