This reminds me of something told to me, it is not directly linked to this thread, but a relevant question nevertheless.

  

"When it comes to shastras like yoga or vedanta or ayurveda, faithful translations exist in some modern Indian languages today such that one need not access the original at all for serious studies in the same".

  

How true is this statement and to what degree ?

  

Isn't it possible that someone well versed in vedanta rather than yoga could interpret the yoga texts from a vedantic perspective/bias knowingly or unknowingly and translate accordingly ?

  

If this merits a separate thread, the moderator may do so along with adding an appropriate subject line, or tell me to do the needful.
