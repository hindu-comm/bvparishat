Dear Prof. Misra,

  

I already expressed my realization that the youngster's Harry Potter lingo was not understood by me. I apologized for allowing that.

  

Vidwan Sri Vishwas should have sent an individual mail to Sri Ujjwal if he wanted to take a view that that post was not wrong.

  

The only way a moderator can reduce the burden of repeated requirement of employing controlling mechanisms is by going to the next step of controlling.

  

Sorry for the pain 'this long rope' approach has caused to you.

  

Soon steps will be taken to avoid this.
