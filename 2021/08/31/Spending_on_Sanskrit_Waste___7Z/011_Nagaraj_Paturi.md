Dear Prof. Bijoy Misra,

  

As I already noted in a note that I shared in response to a misrepresentation of BVP on another list, these lists are primarily formed and are used mostly as a co-operative society for collecting necessary book sources and references.

  

Discussions are not the primary function of these email lists.

  

Particularly generating new research of any kind can not happen from here.

  

Your neurology research focusing on language is such a niche area that you may hardly get audience , leave alone co -researchers that can discuss the topics with you. Not just BVP , I am not able to imagine any other mailing list that can provide the companyyou are looking for. But we can provide lay man's cheers to you when you share your neurology research though we don't frequently see that.

  

Your India discovery center activities, your multi language poetry conclaves, your Ramayana articles, your updates on where you and your group are in reading Ramayana etc. which are beyond neurology of language are being well received by the list.

  

Similar to you, many other members use the forumfor reaching out to the interested people withtheir articles, book publications, Sanskrit and Indian culture related events, video and audio productions etc.

  

Guidance on day to Hinduism practices with references from authentic sources are sought and authoritative scholars provide that guidance on this list.

  

There was a time when vyaakarana, particularly of the prakriyaaside, was dominating on the list in terms of discussions. Yes, we are missing it badly nowadays.

  

But on the positive side, nowadays, there is a diversification into a few other shaastras including astronomy, chronolgy, astronomical chronology, music, Natya etc.

  

Governmental policies and societal developments affecting Sanskrit and its study are a very much legitimate topic for this group of Sanskrit scholars. It touches anerveor two of the members because it affects their lives and livelihoods.

  

Other lists are also busy nowadays discussing closing down of the Sanskrit departments and studies in different countries outside India.

  

Those who are not affected by the developments can at least empathise with the pain shared by the discussants.
