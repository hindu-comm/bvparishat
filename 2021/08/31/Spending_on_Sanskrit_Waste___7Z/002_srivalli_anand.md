Respected Kannan Sir and other elders in this group,

  

It has been a long standing sad state of affairs for Sanskrit studies in Tamilnadu.

  

In the year 1998, the then government decided to close the B.A sanskrit dept in Queen Mary's College Chennai, which was then and even now the only college for girls that offers U.G. studies in Sanskrit Literature in Chennai. The course was reinstated and the G.O was revoked after a case was filed against the action. The dept continues till date..

  

Currently, the Post graduate and research Dept of Sanskrit in Madras University faces a severe crunch of staff. There is currently only one staff member for the Dept that offers both P.G and research in Sanskrit.

Same is the case in Queen Mary's College and Presidency college as well.

  

The other pitiable situation is that, schools now offer only the state language as second language. In CBSE schools Hindi is offered as an option and is taken up either as 2nd or 3rd lang. With an exception of a few handful of schools, majority of Schools have not been offering Sanskrit as a option at all since the last 5 years because then the students will need to study 3 languages apart from English. Already existing sanskrit teachers are handling only classes 8,9, and 10 and once these students pass out of schools, they don't have any more batches to teach. They are made to teach Hindi for 1st and 2nd std children.

This being the case, even the Arts and science colleges that offer Sanskrit as an option don't have feeder depts in schools to offer them students. So the plight of those teachers are also at stake.

  

The neglected state of Sanskrit in Tamil Nadu is something of a pattern. As long as job opportunities and research opportunities with good fellowships are not there, even willing and capable candidates are dissuaded and discouraged from taking up higher studies. So we mainly see older people, who take up the m.a. courses more out of interest rather than academic pursuit.

  

I dont know if this rambling of mine does have relevance to the thread started, but this needs a proper forum to discuss and deliberate on.

  

And knowing the media, they would have chosen only a passive candidate to speak for the side of Sanskrit. Their prejudice is very apparent.
So much so that, in Tamilnadu, officially, Sanskrit is only referred to as vada mozhi - வட மொழி - meaning the northern language. That is the sense of disconnect they impose on the language.

  

Regards

Srivalli Anand
