The best way to kill a ‘ (Samskruth) Tree’ is make it produce ‘seeds’
which cannot regenerate themselves to their highest standards and expressions.

This is the continuing impact of not addressing and implementing solutions for the key issue: Why –How - study Samskrutham and make it useful for National prosperity and global leadership – socially, economically, technologically and spiritually. The ‘concerned people’ are locked up in connecting ‘ glory of Samskruth to past -culture’ and blocking the ‘path way to open roads for ‘utility –application (yoga- prayoga- viniyoga) of Samskrutham for ‘global leadership’. 

The previous actions have been like efforts to implement a wish : we need ‘Rama and Sita of Ramayana ( for old generation satisfaction) ’; but we want them in ‘ best designer brand jeans ( to make them appeal to the younger generation)’. 

\[A traditional expression for this is : aphalaa- apushpaa ; another anglicised expression is ‘barren nature, monsanto seeds model of next generation scholarship’.\] 

Indian education investment on ‘Sanskrit Education across different states’ has demonstrated three key features in making ‘Samskruth studies to go ‘ monsanto way’. The collated study of several education reports prior to current NEP -2020 can show this.



(i) Paying high tributes to Sanskrit ( oriental model), cut the roots of ‘Gurukul studies \[ Disconnect between policy makers and implementers\]



(ii) Social dilution of Spiritual standards set for ‘Samskruth document Studies’ in the name of Openness of education, Popularizing and catching up with colonial frae work \[ Distortion in core understanding of ‘ Purushatha framework of tradition from Vyasa and Chankaya\].



(iii) Disconnecting every other socially, economically, professionally, science and technology wise useful stream of Samskruth language based disciplines from main stream education right from early schooling to employment skills and professional practices. \[The glorious Samskruth slogans remain on walls and seals of National Executive and Judiciary, as a face mark of ‘Bharateeyataa’; Rest of action is guided by local regional language –local game plays for power and pelf. This is the convenience of legislature and executive working together in subverting the glorious proclamations and protections from Judiciary.\]



Therefore, please come out with support model and a resource-plan answering : Why Samskruth at India for 2030? How ? NEP-2020 has some very useful pointers on this.’ Tasmat yudhyasva’ for it is ‘ Bhagavad- aadesha’ and path shown. If the future jobs and skilled professions are NOT IN THE TEMPLES’, why so much fuzz is being made on ‘holding to Temple-Sanskrit in social education’? Why Science –Technology- Maths
education is not being introduced ? Let us look forward and drive to ‘action beyond argument’ for Sanskrit !
