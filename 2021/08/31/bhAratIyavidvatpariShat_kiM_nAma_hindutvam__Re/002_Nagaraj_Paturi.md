Something that everyone agrees with is not possible in such cases.

  

There are three strands here :

  

1\. Those who go by etymology and see Hindutva as a synonym for Hinduism

  

2\. Those who treat the word Hindutva as different from Hinduism and analyse it historically starting fromV. D. Savarkar’s book **Hindutva: Who is Hindu?** (1923)

  

3.Those who treat the word Hindutva as different from Hinduism and analyse it from the perspective of current usage.

  

It is here that the whole game of semantic manipulation is found.

  

All the Hinduphobic groups consciously demonize the word and its users never allowing a general audience to see the amicable explanation from those who consider their usage of the word not containing anything that the semantic manipulator is coloring it to be.

  

In this situation you can not have something 'which people agree on'
