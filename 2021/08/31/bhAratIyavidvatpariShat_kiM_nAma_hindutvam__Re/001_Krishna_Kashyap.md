Thanks Sri Kushagra Aniket Ji,

  

However, I am looking for somethingmore than a formal definition (of Hindutva) that has some more details. More like a formal paper on Hindutva, which people agree on.

Is there one? Someone asked me this question. I wanted to give them a paper that is well written and reviewed by some people.
