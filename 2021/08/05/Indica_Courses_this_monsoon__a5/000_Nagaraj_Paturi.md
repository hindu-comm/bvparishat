[Dharmic Minds for Mediatized Times](https://indica.courses/enroll/dr-charu-uppal/dharmic-minds-for-mediatized-times/)



This course is taught by Dr. Charu Uppal, a media researcher, based in Sweden, who has taught at universities in United States, Fiji, and Sweden. Her research interests are interdisciplinary with a focus on the use of media for expressing cultural and political identity.

Media function in a context. Media are consumed in a context. The context of creation aims to widen its audience, to generate profits. The context of consumption is often dominated with the idea of entertainment, collective family viewing, and sometimes education and/ or information.What happens when the two contexts interact? Is the result always for our best interests?Can we become a more discerning, critical consumer of media content? How can we use the understanding of Purusharthas to regulate our media consumption?

This Indica Course brings together media theories and a basic understanding of Purusharthas (four goals or strivings of human life) to critically analyze media messages, media consumption and its impact on our life-choices.

The Indian sub-continent has a vast and varied corpus of dancing traditions, birthed, in the context of the temples, courts and popular presentations in temple courtyards or streets. Some of these traditions took their genesis as female centric solo traditions called the ‘Nattuva Melam’ and some, as male centric, theatrical traditions called the ‘Natya Melam’.

The modern construct of Classical Dance form owes its content and repertoire to the above mentioned contexts, in which the dance traditions of India flourished.

This Indica Course will trace this journey in an interesting and comprehensible manner.
