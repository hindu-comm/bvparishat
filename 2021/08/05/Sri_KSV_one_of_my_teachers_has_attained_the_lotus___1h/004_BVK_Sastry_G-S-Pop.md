Namaste



Sad to know the news of one more vaidika satvika yogi samskrutha shaastra -vidwan fading away in to the ‘kaala- purusha-garbha’. Womb of Time.



KSV as he was referred with all respects and without need to mention of
honour titles was like HSV ( those who know him from earlier times : Sri Rangapriya deshika swamy of Asthtanga Yoga Mandira). KSV had deep respect for HSV’s teachings and views.



I got connected to HSV through Krishna Kashyap on discussions around the
themes hovering around ‘Darshana schools use of Samskruth words for concepts’.



I did have the privilege of having long hours of personal discussion and clarification on intricate issues in ‘sampradaya and shaastra’.

I am ever grateful for his guidance provided , which help to cut across the narrow dividers that break people than bind them in to sampradaya.



I hope his writings and lectures available through Krishna Kashyap will help researchers and traditionalists in coming days to guide.



With Pranams
