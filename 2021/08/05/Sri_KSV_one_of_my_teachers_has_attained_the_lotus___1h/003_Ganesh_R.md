It is saddening to know the demise of Sri. K. S. V. He was a great soul and I had the good fortune of interacting with him on several occasions. Apart from his vast knowledge in many shaastras, he was simple, humble, and magnanimous. I was deeply impressed by his exceptional generosity in explaining and understanding various systems of philosophies and religious practices.

  

May the Lord Sri mannaaraayaNa bless him with saayujya.

  

  

  

With utmost regards

  

  

Ganesh
