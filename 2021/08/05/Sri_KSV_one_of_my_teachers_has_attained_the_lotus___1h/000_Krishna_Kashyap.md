Following is an excerpt from the introduction to the author written by Sri S. N. SrirAma dEsikAchArya, one of his classmates at the Tirupati University.

  

Sri varadAchar was born in the year 1922 C.E in Kothimangalam (Tamil Nadu). He got his pancha samskAram under his father and under him he studied *kAvya*, *nAtakas* etc. Then he studied Vedas under *nAvalpAkam sOmayAjI Sri nArAyana tAta dEsikan* right in his village. Then he studied in Chennai at *kAkumAnI AdikEsavulu SrEsti samskrita pAtasAla* and at *Tirupati SrivEnkatEsvara SamskritakalAsAla*, where he completed *nyAya* *sAstra* at *sirOmani* level. Then he performed *prapatti* at the feet of *Kothimangalam vAtsya sri vIrarAghava mahAdEsikan.*  
  
It gives me immense pleasure to remember that he was my classmate in Tirupati. Then Sri varadAchar went to study under the world famous Srimad Abhinava Ranganatha Bramha tantra parakAla swami, and his great disciple, AtmakUr dIkshAchAr for ten years covering advanced *granthas* pert*a*ining to *PrAchIna nyAya, navya nyAya sAstra, vedAnta* and other systems of philosophy (*darsana granthas*). Thus he became an *ubhaya vedAnta mahA pandita* as well as a *dArsanika*. Sri varadAchar wrote a commentary on an advanced *nyAya* text known as "*nyAya* *manjari*" and thus proved his mastery in *nyAya* *sAstra*. The government of Karnataka recognized this work and presented him with an award.  
  
The paramAchArya of kanchi, after having direct knowledge of his multi-faceted mastery in various sAstras, awarded him a title of "Pandita Ratnam", etched in a gold plate, in 1953, when Sri varadAchar was just about 31 years old. In the year 2002, he got the President's award. In 2003, the RashtrIya Samskita VidyApIta of Tirupati gave the title of "*mahAmahOpAdhyAya*" to him. Sri varadAchar, though averse to fame, wealth or praise, was given awards such as *sAstra ratnAkara, sarva sAstra kalAnidhi* etc. even by pundits belonging to other systems of thought. Rare are the people who are pundits in different sAstras. Rare are the people among them who can analyze different sAstras and write commentaries on them. Among such pundits, rare are the people who can teach them. The fact that all these three qualities exist in Sri varadAchar reminds us of the great TrivEni sangama.
