Very informative lecture.

  

I was very surprised by the paurANika acknowledgement of small movement of Thuban during their time.

  

Besides the ekAgnikANDa dhruva-darshana mantra quotedtowards the end, vaishvadevamantras also include some identical/ very similar words:  
**ध्रु॒वाय॑ भू॒माय॑ स्वाहा॑।ध्रु॒व॒-क्षित॑ये॒ स्वाहा॑।अ॒च्यु॒त॒क्षित॑ये॒ स्वाहा॑।** These 3 (out of 6) mantra-s are made slightly less obscure by the connection - though I am not clear on अच्युतक्षितये.**If someone has some astronomically+ sentimentally sensible interpretation**, pleaselet me know - very valuable for practicing ritualists.  

  

That apart, it is a tragedy that the present-day dhruva-darshana ritual during marriage has become sickcomedy (daytime "darshana"), and sighting the saptarShimaNDala+ arundhati+ kRttika-s (implicit in the very next mantra) is entirely skipped.
