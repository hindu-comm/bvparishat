Respected Scholars,

  

Kindly suggest a good English translation of Ramayan and Mahabharat.

  

Just short stories are not enough, neithera direct clockwise translation which will be difficult toapprehend.

  

But if every Adhyaya's prose can be there it would be great!

  

This is for 15-17 age youngster, fond of reading large English books.

  

Thanks in Advance!

  

Regards,

Vikram
