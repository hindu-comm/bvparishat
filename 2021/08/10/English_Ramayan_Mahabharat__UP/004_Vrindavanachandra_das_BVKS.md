Dear Vikram,

  

This might help your requirement for Ramayana. Both works are by authors who are not just scholars but living the tradition in daily life.

  

Abridgedwith Adhyaya's prose:

<https://www.amazon.in/Ramayana-Bhakti-Vikas-Swami/dp/8190233203>  

  

Unabridged edition with Sanskrit slokas, word-to-word meaning, and commentaries:

<https://www.amazon.in/Sri-Valmiki-Ramayana-Canto-Volumes/dp/B07R8KJR2C/>  

<https://www.amazon.in/Sri-Valmiki-Ramayana-Canto-Volumes/dp/B08GFNQZL5/>  
  
More cantos are in the works.

  

Hope that helps.  
  
Thank you, Hare Krishna.  
  
Yours in the service of Lord Rama,  
Vrindavana Chandra Das
