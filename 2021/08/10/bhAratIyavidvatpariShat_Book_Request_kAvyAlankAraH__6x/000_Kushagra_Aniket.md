सर्वेभ्यो नमः।  

  

Dear Scholars,

  

I am looking for the following book (reference received from an online portal). I searched for it on archive but couldn't find it. Perhaps I am not searching in the right way. I would have preferred to purchase this book but since I am located abroad, I have to settle for a PDF now. Any help would be much appreciated!

  

Kāvyālamṃkāra of Bhāmaha. Ed. Batuk Nāth Śarmā and Baldev Upādhyāya. Kāśī Sanskrit Series 61, 1928. Reprinted, Varanasi: Chaukhambha Sanskrit Sansthan, 1981.  

  

Sincerely,

Kushagra
