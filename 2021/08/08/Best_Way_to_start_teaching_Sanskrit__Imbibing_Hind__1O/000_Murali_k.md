Hi All,

  

I am a parent to a 18 month old Daughter. I want her to pick up sansritand Dharmic culture over the next few years.

  

  

  

My knowledge of Samskrutam is nil and maybe, I have to learn it myself in order to teach her. In that case, Can the members here suggest the best way to learn spoken samskrutam online so that I can then teach my daughter.

  

I have looked at anki flash cards and Youtube course from an IIT ianto self teach the language.

  

I might not be able to spend more than 30 minutes on learning, unfortunately. Due to job constraints.

  

  

Thanks,

Murali
