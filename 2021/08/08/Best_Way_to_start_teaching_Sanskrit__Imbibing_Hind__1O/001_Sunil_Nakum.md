Dear Murliji,

  

Well, I'm not in position to guide you by myself but responding as I've travelled this journey and still not settled for it. Here are few tips,

  

\- Try to speak at least a few Sanskrit words or at least in your mother tongue. This means a lot, most of us have got this habit of mixing up any regional language with English. For example, use "karyalaya" instead of "office", "sandesh" vs "message" etc. This will ease their journey to learn Sanskrit.

\- I believe teaching/learning Sanskrit should not be done in isolation, meaning that we ourselves are conversing in english mix languages at home and expecting our child to pick-up Sanskrit

\- In fantasy of teaching Sanskrit, a child should not miss the golden opportunity of learning his/her mother tongue (I mean in pure form). Once he/she has the in-depth knowledge of one language (mother tongue>MT), she can correlate (translate) it in other languages. I took this route ofgetting thorough in the regional language because I could not find a better way to give the same exposure/experience for Sanskrit language. If you could get that opportunity, please go ahead without a second thought. I'm sharing it based on my parenting experiences. I've seen many kids asking the regional meaningfor as simple number as twenty "20", because they have started with english at home and schools. What to speak of fractional numbers in MT/regional language?

\- Although, there is no limit to the online contents, still suggesting one on-going session organized by Sampoorna Swadesi, worth giving a try,
