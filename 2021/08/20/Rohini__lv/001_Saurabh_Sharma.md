The name Rohini has been used for both Jyestha and the Rohini nakshatra in the Taittiriya Samhita (TS IV.4.10.1 - रोहिणी नक्षत्रं प्रजापतिर्देवता, 10.2 - रोहिणी नक्षत्रमिन्द्रो देवता), perhaps because of the similar reddish colour of the prominent star in each of them (Aldebaran in Rohini and Antares in Jyestha) and due to them being exactly opposite to each other. Not sure if there are any more nakshatras associated with it.
