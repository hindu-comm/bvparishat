Respected Scholars,  
  
Namo Namah.  
  
One of my brahmachari friends is looking for a book(s) on traditional  
recipes, in particular, those ancient recipes that were offered to  
Lord Vishnu in all major Vishnu temples in India  
(north/south/east/west) such as Badarinath, Shri Rangam, Udupi,  
Jagannatha Puri, Dvarika etc.  
  
I would be very grateful to find any such authentic book(s).  
  
Thanks in advance.
