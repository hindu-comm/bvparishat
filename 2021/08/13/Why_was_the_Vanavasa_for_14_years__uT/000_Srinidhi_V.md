Respected Scholars,

  

Is there any specific reason for sending Sri Rama to Vanavasa for 14 years? I am aware of Manthara's reasoning provided in Valmiki Ramayana. However, it doesn't explain why it can't be a year less or more.

  

I have heard that there are some Dharmashastra (?) regulations that mention the significance of 14 years (such as prohibiting the eligibility of a prince or considering him to have died, etc.). Is that true? If yes, can you please point me to a reliable reference?

  

\[Also, is there a similar explanation for Pandavas' Vanavasa (+ Ajnatavasa) ?\]

  

Regards,

Srinidhi
