Who said Sanskritized Hindi is not musical? No need for guttural Arabic and hard Persian sounds. Sanskritized Hindi is mellifluous and poetic.

  

Sanskritized Hindi sounds quite natural while Hindi chock-full of Arabic and Persian words sound quite artificial.  

  

Just heard these songs from an old movie Saaz.

  

बादल घुमड़ बढ़ आए …

  

रवि उज्ज्वल प्रज्ज्वलित गगन में

कनकालंकृत भोर ...
