Namaste

  

Namo Namah!

  

Sanskrit Club IITR, in collaboration with Dramatics Section IITR, is organising a drama - 'कर्णभारम् : a different narrative about the last day of Karna's life' .

  

'KARNABHARAM' or 'The Anguish of Kunti-putra Karna' is a Sanskrit play beautifully crafted by one of the most illustrious and earliest dramatist of Indian subcontinent, Mahakavi Bhasa.

  

Mahakavi Bhasa portrays in his classic work 'Karnabharam', the downfall of the mighty epic hero 'Karna', projecting the inner conflict that develops in him when he enters Kurukshethra to wage a crucial battle with the Pandavas. It helps the spectators realise the true generous and righteous nature of Karna as he ride out towards the battle-ground, where his death under heart-wrenching circumstances is certain.

  

Dr Prasad Bhide will present this play through अभिवाचन. He will recite and enact the text and explain the connotations in hindi. Do join us to witness the retelling of a heartfelt episode of the Indian epic 'Mahabharata' but from a different eye.
