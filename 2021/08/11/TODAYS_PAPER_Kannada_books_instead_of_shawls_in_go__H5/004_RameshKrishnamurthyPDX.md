From personal experience (about shawls). Each state will not give shawls from other states - local artisan and business support. Most of the time, it is becomes a collection of similar or same shade/design/size etc. Sourced from the same contractor maybe? Shawl collections usually not usable - there are one or two that are good and liked and get used all the time. most others are gifted away again, or just stay in a cupboard for a while.
