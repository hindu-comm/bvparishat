Some years ago too I had observed that many scholars shared the experience: Their cupboards are overflowing with mementos such as shawls, artificial garlands of various shapes and designs, the Mysore Peta, and what not. After a period these are of nuisance value. They collect dust and are only thrown away. It is better if books or as is a new practice, a Tuasi or some other flowering plant is given to the dignitaries on the dias. The case of the Mysore Peta is pathetic in the sense that after it is once placed on the scholar's head on the dias, never is it again used by him later in his lifetime. These are not the days of the earlier centuries where turbans were worn by many people to the office daily, like Sir C.V.Raman or Sir M.Vishveshvaraiah. So, it is better these practices are replaced considering wiser choices.
