With duerespect I prefer to stick to traditional shawls. They can be from different parts of country. Books may not be of a scholar's area of interest or already in his library. One has to look for a proper user.

Shawls are good for wives, daughters, sons and sons in law or shishyas. Tradition is not for nothing.
