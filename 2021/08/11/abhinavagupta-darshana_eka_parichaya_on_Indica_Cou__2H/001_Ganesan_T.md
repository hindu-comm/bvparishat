Congratulations for including Abhinavagupta Darshan as a subject to be taught in the Indica- Courses.

  

In the same way, Saivasiddhanta -Darshan, another very important Saiva system with a well developed philosophical system and which predates Abhinavagupta, can also be included in the पाठ्यक्रम.  

  

The earliest Saivasiddhanta preceptor who had composed quite a number of texts for standardising the fundamental philosophical concepts of the Saivasiddhanta and whose many works have come down to us with elaborate commentaries, is, **Sadyojyot**i (circa 7th century CE). He and some of his followers such as Narayanakantha, Ramakantha, Srikantha-- were residents of Kashmir and all of them were *earlier* to Abhinavagupta. In fact Abhinavagupta refers to some them by name and refers to some of their concepts also in his Tantraloka.  

  

So my suggestion is Indica can very well offer a course under the name Kashmir Saivasiddhanta Darshan or Sadyojyoti Saivasiddhanta Darshan so that scholars/students are introduced to such an ancient and important Saiva religio-philosophical system  

  

This course will also help in removing the misconception that Saivasiddhanta is basically a south indian system originated only in Tamilnadu (and therefore a later school) and whose texts are only in Tamil language, which misconception prevails among scholars and lay persons now.

  

I hasten to add that the Saivasiddhanta has been enriched in Tamilnadu and even now flourishes there with full vigour. There is an enormous amount of Saivasiddhanta texts in Tamil language (and also in Sanskrit composed in Tamilnadu) beginning from the 11th century CE.  

Best

Ganesan
