Dear Dr Ganesan,

  

Thanks for your observations.

  

Please think of some course on pre- AbhinavaguptaKashmir Shaivism and /or sources of Abhinavagupta's philosophy and design a course curriculum and please consider you yourself a teaching that course or please suggest a suitable teacher for the same. Indic Academy will have that course taught on Indica Courses platform.

  

Similarly, you may think of designing a course on Tamil Shaivism also. I think there are some courses on that from some universities. So you may think of a course on aspects that are not covered by the existing ones.

  

You and other scholars on the list are welcome to propose any course(s) . Smt Dimple -ji leading the Indica Courses platform will coordinatewith you to take it forward.

  

Regards,

  

Nagaraj
