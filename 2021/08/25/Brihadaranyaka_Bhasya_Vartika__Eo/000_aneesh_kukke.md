Namaste,

I am trying to find a soft copy of Brihadaranyaka Bhasya Vartika published by Mahesh Research Institute. I already have found the soft copies for Sambandha Vartika and Brihadaranyaka Bhasya Vartika Vol I.

<https://archive.org/details/dli.ernet.383628/page/n9/mode/1up>  

If anyone has access to the second volume. Please share it with me.

With Regards

Aneesh Kukke
