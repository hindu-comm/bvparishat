I would answer questions that do not deserve my time. That is how I can save myself from getting undulytired. I don't remember any member pressurising Prof. Deshpande to answer any question.

  

The following words quoted by Sri Nityanand-ji

are from the thread titled " A new dawn"

It was an old thread started with a verse by Prof. Madhav Deshpande on 8th November, 2020.

  

The verse outwardly has no reference to any political event. But in the ensuing discussion, Prof. Deshpande in the post at

<https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/wDlPYRQXh0M/m/XRBt24jfAQAJ>

  

appears to have admitted that there was a political suggestion in it.
He appears to have indicated that it was about the US elections in response to a post<https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/wDlPYRQXh0M/m/XRBt24jfAQAJ>

  

In the ensuing discussion Prof. Deshpande was amply encouraged to continue posting verses.

  

The thread was revived through Sri Megh -ji's post<https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/wDlPYRQXh0M/m/UwnSpKxfAgAJ>

  

in which he said 

  

I am not sure verses might help India protect her interests in dealing with these weapons.

  

citing a twitter post :

This happened because the same topic of US elections is back into discussions in the wake of Afghan developments. People started wondering if there was really'a new dawn'.

  

It was as part of this fresh discussion that Prof. Deshpande said what is quoted by Sri Nityanand-ji.

  

Anyone who follows this thread understands that the first post by Prof. Deshpande itself took BVP into US politics /elections or brought US elections /politics into BVP.  

  

I think members saying that what was thought to be a new dawn is not really so , it is any ad hominem comment.
