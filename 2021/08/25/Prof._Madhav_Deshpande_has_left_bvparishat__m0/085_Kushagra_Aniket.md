Dear Scholars,

  

I agree that the standards of civil discourse in this list have been compromised by certain members. One can see it in the flurry of impulsive, unedited, and unfiltered comments in recent emails.

  

BVP has always given me appreciation and encouragement. I have also learnt a lot from the scholars present here. It would be unfortunate if the quality of discussion is lowered.

  

I represent nobody but myself. But I must comment that this kind of bickering and name calling does not help in attracting young people to the cause of Sanskrit and Samskriti.

  

Best,

Kushagra
