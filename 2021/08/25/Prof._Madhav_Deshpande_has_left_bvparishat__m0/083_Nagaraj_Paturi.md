I did not see any personal attack on Prof. Deshpande. It was a threadabouta conference in which as per the thread initiator, those who indulge in representing Hinduism in bad light are involved. Pointing out that tendency in the academic writings or popular writings in academic topics of certain academicians is not a personal attack on them. One member added Prof. Deshpande to the list that was being pointed out in the thread. He saw a contradiction between what he wanted to show evidence for , misrepresenting Hinduism, by Prof. Deshpande and his writing of Krishna Bhakti verses. Both these are academic activities of the professor. There was no personal aspect being covered in the post.

  

It was not intended to be against his writing Krishna Bhakti verses or the content in them.

  

So there was no personal attack on him.



So much for that question.

  

Yes, people being too picky about any distant reference to their mother tongue Tamil, Hindi, Telugu or Marathi and any academic discussion pointing out the flaws in some linguistic or caste supremacism etc. is academically not a healthy tendency. But if those expressions are characterized as hate, many in the list can be pointed out for those.  

  

We can only request to get over these tendencies.

  

  

Let us close the thread.
