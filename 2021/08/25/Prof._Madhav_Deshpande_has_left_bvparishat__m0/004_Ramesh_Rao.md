Words spoken, arrows released cannot be recalled...

  

Broken vases cannot be put together...  

  

Much harm was done to the Hindu cause in the CA textbook case by the Witzel, Wujastyk commandeered Hinduphobes...

  

Krishna leela it is.

  

The wise shall smile.

  

It is for humans to rue and regret.

  

Everything has consequences.

  

The world turns/burns in the blink of an eye.

  

We shall be born again to fulfill our samskaras.

  

May Sri Hari's grace protect those who are going to lie awake, spending sleepless nights...

  

So be it.

  

Ramesh
