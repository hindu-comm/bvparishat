Sorry to know this. I am neither a senior member nor a sanskrit scholar.

  

Everyday I look forward to read Professor Deshpande ji's poems on Shri Krishna. I am sure his verses bring much joy in our lives and we all learn a lot from his posts.

  

In Professor Deshpande ji's poems where everyone search for Krishna are so enchanting and endearing. But, it is very sad to see that the poetic lines have become a reality.

  

This group is a source of invaluable knowledge where I learn something new every single day and the posts here have made invaluable contribution in my life. I consider myself very fortunate to be a member of this group.It would be extremely unfortunate if there is discord amongst list members.  

  

A humble request and a sincere appeal to Professor Deshpande ji to be back in this group.

  

Many thanks and regards

Rucha Kelkar
