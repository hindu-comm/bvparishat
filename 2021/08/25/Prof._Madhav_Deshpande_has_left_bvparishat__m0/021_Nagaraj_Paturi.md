\>His ingratitude to BVP, which gave himso much scope and for so long, is reprehensible to say the least.

  

--- Regarding BVP giving him so much for so long and gratitude or ingratitude , I want to share my observation as I noted.

  

This is pertaining to the Sanskrit verses shared by Prof. Deshpande on this list.

  

Prof. Deshpande was sharing his Krishna verses on Indology list and on on BVP simultaneously in the beginning, uto a very few shlokas.

  

After a few shlokas, his sharing shlokas on the Indology list stopped. Reasons are not known.

  

But it continued on BVP list for more than a thousand and a few hundred verses. Only a few in the beginning expressed boredom from this. Many expressed their admiration to him. Some were as regular as his shloka postingsin their admiration. This was not possible from the other list as he stopped sharing there.

  

He shared his shlokas on many other topics. BVP members showed their sahridayataa again.

  

He shared a few on Indology list again on non-Krishna topics joining some wonderful young scholars from the west composing and sharing some beautiful shlokas. This shloka sharing by him and others was opposed and stopped on that list for the reasons of the tragic environment around due to COVID.

  

But he was welcomed for the sharing of the same shlokas and more and more of them on BVP.

  

If I were he, I would have certainly acknowledged the platform, encouragement, admiration , bhaavuka and rasika company and discussion provided this way by BVP.
