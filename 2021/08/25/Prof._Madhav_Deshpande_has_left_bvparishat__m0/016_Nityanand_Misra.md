Yes, it is true. Prof. Deshpande himself told me me. If I suspected it or did no have complete information, I would have said it. I do not make uncorroborated claims (like S L Bhyrappa mastering the entire Laghusiddhantakaumudi in four weeks) unlike some others.

Not necessarily in the recent past. But over time, there have been many questions and ad-hominem attacks on him as part of the cancel culture of which some people in this list are, knowingly or unknowingly, flagbearers. Anyway, this is my opinion and if you do not agree, it is fine.

You did not search well enough. The quote is right there in this [message](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/wDlPYRQXh0M/m/u1tfZb17AgAJ)(in fact I copy-pasted it). As I said, I am not in the habit of making uncorroborated claims unlike some self-proclaimed sons of soil on this list.

Again, I cannot help if you could not observe this tendencies which Prof. Madhav Deshpande did.

Agreed, there are multiple sides to a story, but there is only one (and ugly) side of cancel culture which infects the right as much as the left in my humble opinion.

  

I will not be responding further to you on this thread. Not that I do not want to, but I simply do not have the time for another debate with you.
