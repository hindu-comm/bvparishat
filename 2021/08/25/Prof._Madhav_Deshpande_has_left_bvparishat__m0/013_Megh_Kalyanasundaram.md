Namaste Nagaraj ji,

  

Thank you for taking time to write the post you did.

  

Namaste all,

  

Since my name has come up in this thread (but not for just that reason), I feel obliged to respond. This post of mine is not intended as a response to any preceding post.

  

'A new dawn' is a thread that I too see, unless anyone can point to what I might be missing, as having been initiated by Dr Deshpande on Nov 8 2020:<https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/wDlPYRQXh0M/m/lAqTahzIAQAJ>

  

Insofar as I can see, none of my posts in that thread actually includes any question\* to anyone.

  

Immediately below is Dr Deshpande's last post in the same thread, the body of which ends with "Best wishes" and which makes the context of his original post, in his own words, again, very clear, which I again appreciate now and which I had also [thanked him for back then](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/wDlPYRQXh0M/m/XGQLuKV-AgAJ).

Anyone who has followed the thread fully would know that the above post of Dr Deshpande, was, in part, a correction to his post just prior, to which I had [responded with specifics](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/wDlPYRQXh0M/m/lhcuQfl8AgAJ):

In the same thread, I had written a post (included below) where I had reasoned that just as Dr Deshpande had chosen to express, in BVP, his worry about US elections and its outcomes for people living in USA, I had similarly expressed my worry about the same election and its outcomes for me in India, given recent developments courtesy some of the decisions of the leader elected through the same election:

In the same thread, Dr Deshpande had expressed "how any of this connects to my Krishna verses is beyond my comprehension," which too was immediately responded to (see image below), since he himself invoked his "Krishna verses," which I certainly did not invoke or even remotely allude to:

Best,  

Megh

  

\* Not that including questions is by itself a crime but I certainly neither intended nor included a question in any of my posts in this thread.
