None of the posts that Prof Deshpande posted on the list calls for his expulsion. When members like Prof Kannan or Vishalji and Visvasji mince no words many a times on different controversial threads use
'language' even when it means the there no concluding evidences to prove most of what they say They continue to post as they like. Can you show me any one post of Prof Deshpande on the list where he uses such language. All views are just views and no one view is the last or concluding view or argument. I am neither a supporter or Prof Deshapande or know him personally or know what he does or think in US. Neither do I know what or Vishvasji or Vishalji do in the US. I will always respect
them as good and sound scholars. They know what they are writing about May be I don't know. I don't wish to know The list if I may suggest should focus only on matters pertaining to Sanskrit and Indic studies in a way that suits an academic forum. That would be best way out. I will not be posting further or will be discussing further on this topic
