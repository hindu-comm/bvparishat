I was not able to respond in detail except allowing and /or disallowing messages to the list and give short replies earlier than this as I was travelling.

  

Aadaraniya Sri Ntyanand -ji suggested a more active moderation of the list. I already shared the modus operandi of the moderation of the list. If Sri Nityanand-ji has any recommendation for changes in that process , we will certainly consider making all such changes in the moderating process of the list.

  

On 30th July, 2021, addressing Sri Nityanand-ji I said as follows :
