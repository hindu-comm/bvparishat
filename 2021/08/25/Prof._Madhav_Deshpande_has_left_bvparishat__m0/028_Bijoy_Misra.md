Nagrajji,  

I wrote in AMT and OIT context.

Madhavji appears to be sympathetic to AMT.

AMT has little basis, but a scientific analysis of vedic Sanskrit is required

to understand the origin of Sanskrit language. We are trying, ever so slow.  

So is my opinion. I am sorry if I digressed.  

Hope Madhavji may reconsider joining back.

Best regards,

Bijoy
