Forgot to mention: While I don't recall the specifics of the "S L Bhyrappa mastering the entire Laghusiddhantakaumudi in four weeks" claim, it appears that you refer to some old FB post by me. Well, if someone like R Ganesh says such a thing, I don't see a need to corroborate. On theother hand, if some northie makes up examples about schwa deletion in kannaDa/ SI languages - I'd definitely verify,given the high likelihood of error.
