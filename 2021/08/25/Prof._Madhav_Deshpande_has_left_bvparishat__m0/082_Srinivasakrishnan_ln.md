Wasn’t it personal when Prof Deshpande was being attacked?

  

Is ‘hate’ a wrong word to be used while criticizing a persistent pattern of behavior where people spew hate without using the word?

  

Is it wrong to point out unacceptable behavior now when this should have been caught ages back?

  

Shocked,
