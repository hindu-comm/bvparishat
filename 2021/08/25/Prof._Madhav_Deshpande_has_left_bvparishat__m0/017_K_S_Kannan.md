*If what Vishal Agarwal states is true*, Prof. Madhav Deshpande  

should long ago have been expelled from BVP.  

  

Our history and heritage has long been witness to  

acts of saboteurs as moles and sepoys.  

*"nahi tsaravyeṇa dāruṇā vinā paraśur vr̥kṣa-cchedanāya sampadyate."*

नहि त्सरव्येण दारुणा विना परशुर् वृक्षच्छेदनाय सम्पद्यते** ।*

As Upton Sinclair said so well: "A man cannot be made to understand a thing

when his salary depends upon his not understanding it."  

Making a living out of Western patronage, ंMD cannot be expected  

to be any better than being true to his salt there.  

  

Rather than an honourable exit, if the learned professor is quitting BVP  

hurling his vile and undeserved imprecations, he is only to be deemed  

a good riddance, after all. The only puzzle is why he had to  

linger and meander in such a "hostile" environment  

deep into years of his old age.  

  

His ingratitude to BVP, which gave him  

so much scope and for so long, is reprehensible to say the least.
