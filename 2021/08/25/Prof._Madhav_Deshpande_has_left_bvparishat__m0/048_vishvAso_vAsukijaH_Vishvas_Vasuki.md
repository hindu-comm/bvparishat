namaste,

  

Some disagreement with what shrI ajit and others have said with regards to politics in this thread -

  

Eg. "list if I may suggest should focus only on matters pertaining to Sanskrit and Indic studies in a way that suits an academic forum."

  

\- Political and geo-political thought is very much part of bhAratIya vidvattA since ancient days.

\- There can be serious scholarship when it comes to politics and geopolitics. Example, take a look at<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwrXq1EzWio> , which I (indirectly) quoted in my post <https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/wDlPYRQXh0M/m/hdXgGDhzAwAJ> .

-Sanskrit and Indic studies does not mean regurgitating vyAsa and kauTilya endlessly. It may involve critically examining and selectively imbibing new things from other cultures (eg. Dutch studies in Japan) and theories (including Marxism). This is the spirit with which the likes of BG Tilak worked.

\- Scholarship is a tool in politics - this should be recognized and countered when necessary.
