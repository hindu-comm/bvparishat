Dear Vishal Ji

  

I hope you are familiar with Godwin's law of Nazi analogies. The moment somebody brings in Nazis/Hitler/Taliban (or even Ravana in some contexts), the argument is no longer sound.

How different is this from some left-liberals in India canceling Sachin Tendulkar some time ago for not raising his voice against casteism, atrocities, etc (as they claimed, not me).

Our? Who all are you speaking for? Are you speaking as an individual or as a self-appointed representative?

Minor point: Why bring in somebody's Guru (or father or brother or family) into any of this. Anyway, it is gross understatement to say that RJB was a a cause dear to his heart. He fought actively for it including deposing in Allahabad High Court. RJB is a cause dear to my heart also. But how is that relevant to Prof. Deshpande quitting this group?

Thanks for the charge-sheet, Vishal Ji. But that is what is it, a charge-sheet. I see many assumptions and leaps of imagination. But I will not argue. I will only say that even though Prof. Deshpande and I may be diametrically opposite when it comes to ideology or political leanings, but so what? What do you say of the late Charudeva Shastri, whose Arya Samaji position on Bhagavata Purana and many other issues was quite iconoclastic (and would be found highly objectionable by many Sanatanis) to say the least? What if he was a member of this list today? Would we come up with a similar charge-sheet and hound him over years? Is this Bharatiya-Vidvat-Parishad or Bharatiya-Dharma-Samsad?

I fail to see your point. But anyway, I will stop here for lack of time. My last post on this thread.
