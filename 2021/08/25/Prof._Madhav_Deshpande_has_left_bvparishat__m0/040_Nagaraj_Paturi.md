Yes, Sri Ajit-ji. You were right in trying to know the intentions of the poet. In fact, that is how we came to know that US elections were being responded to by that verse.

  

I didn't see any mud slinging even later in the entire thread.

  

The same US election results that are responded to by the verse got discussed in the thread.

  

As Prof. Kannan's post mentioning expulsion, he is not part of the BVP management. His statement can not be taken as BVP management's. His if clause statement seems to be his emotional response to the information shared by Sri Vishal. That response and his emotions in it are completely his.
