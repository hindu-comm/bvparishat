Dr. Mishra,

  

This is my last post to this list on this topic as well. I will respond to others privately, if needed. Others too can write to me privately.

  

To keep quiet and play the game along with Hinduphobic Indologists is one thing. To actually work with them actively to create a Hinduphobic system is a totally different thing. Most of the people defending him or giving him the benefit of doubt are simply not aware of his numerous antics during his active professional life. He who complains about hostility here might well remember his own karma in the past. He too created a hostile environment deliberately for dissenters in the past. Krishna taught us that even those who condone and keep quiet are on the side of Adharma. Here, we are speaking of someone who was like Karna or Vikarna, egging on Duryodhana further in misdeeds.

  

Bharatiya Vidvaans cannot work indefinitely in a bubble because there are other political scholars constantly creating a hostile environment and collaborating with, promoting, endorsing the very people are belittling the vidvaans. People like Thapars, Jhas, R S Sharmas, MDs, Witzels are killing the ecosystem in which our Vidvaans can fluorish.

  

If you worked for the British sarkar, and were asked to fire at your own countrymen, you could either resign (and become unemployed) or just follow orders to shoot. Dr Mishra is defending someone who has done the latter.

  

You have collaborated with Witzel a lot. Doesn't he say, "There is politics everywhere, in every walk of life?" Giving interviews to belittle Hindu parents (and implying that we are ignorant about our own faith) asking for improvements in school textbooks was not simply politics, it was Hindumisia. I lived in California at that time. My child was a potential victim and so were children of many of my friends there.

  

Just recently, the PEW survey had 90% Hindus respond that our faith believes in One Divine Power (even if the majority added that the Power might manifest in many ways). Per this scholar's interview to WSJ, all these 90% respondents are ignorant or are Hindu Nationalists. If he decided to enter the kitchen, he should be willing to take the heat. Did he ever quit any Indology list for blatant racism there?

  

End of my comments on this topic on this list.

  

Regards,

  

Vishal
