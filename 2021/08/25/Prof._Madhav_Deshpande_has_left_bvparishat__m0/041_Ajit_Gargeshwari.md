I too get emotional always and especiallyduring pandemic and post pandemic times. But I refrain from using language against any one. I may ask an uncomfortable question but that doesn't give the right for othersto use language and make claims which can neither be proven or disproved. The memberto whom a question was asked responded and there the matteri ended. What happens in The US happens there. What happens in India happens here. This mailing list is designedto promote knowledge specifically on matters related to Sanskrit studies and support academia. We are not the voice of Hindus nor do we claim we are. Those who are determined to promote and propagate their own agendas are welcometo make their decisions. This group is meant for all lovers of Sanskrit and those who do serious studies in different areas of Sanskrit research. Poetry is considered as the best formof speech.
