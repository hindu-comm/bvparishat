\> I disagree when you say Chelan of certain scholars In fact Prof . and Prof witzel including their students are welcome to join BVP and post here.

  

-- Let me repeat, in spite of some like Sri Vishal Agarwal bringing us to our notice that some senior respected scholars on the BVP list are part of the group that includes the names that you mention, BVP always treated those senior scholars with great respect. Requested them to come back, to continue posting verses etc. repeatedly.
