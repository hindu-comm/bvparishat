As Prof. Paturi (NP) has rightly pointed out, my response was a *conditional*

starting with "If". Even though I have not personally been able to verify

all the claims of Vishal Agarwal-ji (VA), he is not known to have made any irresponsible statement

that he cannot support with evidence. In fact, he already has produced some of it.

And apparently he has much more stock than he has released already

as he has been keeping track of things for over two decades, as per his own claim.

  

The case I was making for was one of my personal assessment,

as rightly pointed out by Prof. Paturi, again; the only difference being that

it was not emotional.  

  

And why should I/anybody sit in judgement? I can suggest what I think is right;

what I think BVP deserves. BVP can also assess others' assessments.

And who is infallible ?  

  

If a member of BVP has, in his academic capacity and role (in his *vidvat*, that is), done something

which is to the detriment of *Bharatiya* heritage and its dignity, a member of *Bharatiya Vidvat* Parishat

has every reason to point to the same and suggest some action. In the past also, many have sought

moderation of posts even when there were mild violations. My personal assessment in the present  

context is, as of VA, that the violation is gross, deserving some stern action. That is only

a suggestion, not a demand. Actually, it is not even a suggestion for some action now; it is one

that could have been appropriate right in the past.

  

An abettor is also a partaker of crime too.

  

सभा वा न प्रवेष्टव्या, वक्तव्यं वा समञ्जसम् ।

अब्रुवन् विब्रुवन् वापि नरो भवति किल्बिषी ॥

is an injunction from premier Bharatiya texts.  

  

There may be members who may want to invite the chelas of Trushke and Pollock into BVP.

There will surely be members who could suggest to the contrary, bearing in mind  

the essential interests of BVP. My assessment is that those who have no intention

to act aright even when they have had an easy opportunity and occasion to,

and on the contrary collude with those who malign our heritage on account of  

their racism and supremacism, should be considered despicable. In this,

I agree with VA.

  

Knowledge of Sanskrit grammar and ability to compose verses by themselves  

do not count for a very great merit. If that alone suffices, why would

Ajit-ji say why US politics here? And why would NP concur? (But all the same,  

if the same should impinge on the immediate/distant goals and values cherished by BVP,  

they deserve to be discussed too - as for example the politics behind the re-nomenclature  

of India as South Asia, bowing down to the pressures of US Dept. of Defence (or whatever)).

  

The pointers provided by VA could well indicate an academic felony by the scholar wrt Bharatiya heritage:

imagine the plight of Indian students in US (and even India) who are constantly mocked and jeered at  

by teachers/peers stereotyping India/Hinduism, which has even become *a part of the curriculum!*  

Surely, the Indian who with glee maligns our heritage colluding with the White Supremacists,

must, howsoever great a scholar he be, be shown the gate at the earliest - is what I meant.

And I see nothing wrong with that : मणिना भूषितस्स्सर्पः किमसौ न भयङ्करः?

  

The anticlimax of the whole drama was the parting shot of the quitter,

the vituperative words that deserve to be rebuked even formally.

Nothing matches the ingratitude of a person who was hosted

almost unconditionally - nay, re-re-re-invited to be a part of the List.

  

It was not the unwise who asserted: कृतघ्ने नास्ति निष्कृतिः ! ।

  

Sorry for the long mail.
