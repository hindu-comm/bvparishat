NamaskaaraH,

  

This is just a clarification: I have nowhere said/written that Dr. S. L. Bhairappa has MASTERED laghusiddhaantakaumudi, let alone in a short span of four weeks. As for my knowledge goes, not even he himself has made any such claims. But it is a fact that he took lessons on Sanskrit grammar and lexicon based on laghukaumudi and amarakosha along with a study of upanishads under Sri. H. V. Nagaraja Rao, an eminent Sanskrit scholar, speciallyknown for his prowess in grammar and poetics.

  

  

With warm regards

  

  

Ganesh
