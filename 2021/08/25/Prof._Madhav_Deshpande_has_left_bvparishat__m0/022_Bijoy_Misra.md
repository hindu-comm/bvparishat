Prof Kannan,

We should not hold scholars to political litmus tests.

There is a vested interest in the west to bring foreigners

to india. But the origin of Sanskrit language itself

remains unsolved. It appears indigenous, but we don't

have concrete scientific investigations yet on the topic.

To target Prof Deshpande on this score is unfortunate

In any case a scholar should have entry in any forum  

of scholarship.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
