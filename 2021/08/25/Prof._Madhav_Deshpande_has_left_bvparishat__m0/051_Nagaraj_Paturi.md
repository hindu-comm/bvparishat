You said it, Sri Ajit-ji.

  

I was pained when colossal scholars like Prof. Rani Sadasiva Murthy , Prof. Kapil Kapur left (though I was not moderating when Prof. Kapil Kapur left, I didn't see any attempts of requesting him to come back too) )because of the mocking or harsh language used here.

  

Members are witness to my repeated requests for respectful differing and debating. There are many members here who were brought from 'allowed' to 'moderated' by me on account of bad etiquette. The whole list is witness to my clear and categorical stand and repeated request for polite communication
