Dear Vishal,

Michael Witzel and I are colleagues in the University.

I like his sustained scholarship, bit disapprove of his  

unscientific theories. My view is that any scholar should not

be tasked for his social opinions. All kinds of opinionated

people walk on the Cambridge streets,  My view could be  

wrong, I have only very limited observation in this area..

I do keep away from topics where I am not qualified.

Letely, I concentrate in our work with teaching India to High

school students via India Discovery Center.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra  

Best regards,
