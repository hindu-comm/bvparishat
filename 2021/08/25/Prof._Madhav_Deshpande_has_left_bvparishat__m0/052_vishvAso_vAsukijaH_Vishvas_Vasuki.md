I am curious to know what happened in the above cases.

I am all for polite communication with a couple of caveats:

  

\- If someone crosses the line, one should not be blamed for responding in the same manner. ("No first strike" principle.)

\- One should be free to harshly and clearly criticize bad ideas - without getting tothe person proposing them. (There is no shortage of almost spam-level nonsensical posts by certain people where credibility is attached to the said idea merely by not being clearly opposed here.)
