Sri Ajit-ji,

  

Let us not use words that don't apply to the present situation.

  

No expulsionhappened in the present case.

  

There are earlier occasions too when Prof. Deshpande expressed his intention to leave the group. He was brought back through requests from the owners of the list.

  

It may be remembered that when the Sri Vishal-ji brought the California text bookissue of 2005, in the thread

  

<https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/PtCz9JhPZYY/m/XnVmkX31DAAJ>,  

  

I immediately took the same action that we take in such circumstances through my immediate response in

  

<https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/PtCz9JhPZYY/m/bPpWFqn1DAAJ>  

  

I used sternest words possible in that post as follows

I showed how US politics were brought into BVP by the thread " a new dawn"

  

You may remember that you were the first one to point out that in your post at

  

<https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/wDlPYRQXh0M/m/80xfl0HZAQAJ>

  

You said

Can anyone show any example where only one side of the argument was allowed on this group and the other side disallowed ?

  

The only reason for disallowing a post was irrelevance to the thread or impoliteness in the expression.

  

I even posted a thread on " how to respectfully differ "

  

But when someone repeatedly leaves or expresses desire to leave the group, the group may feel at some point that we need not pressurise the member too much against his will and wish.
