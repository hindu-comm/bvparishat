As per taking positions, there were series of posts counter arguing with Sri Nilesh Oak's position with regard to chronology. Prof. R N Iyengar too participated in the discussion in support of one of the sides. Prof. Ramesh Rao who started the thread on the conference in US on Dismantling Global Hindutva himself repeatedly brought to the notice of the list how Sri Nilesh is not responding on the list and is mocking at the list members on social media. We would have allowed Sri Nilesh's posts if he posted on the list. He chose not to. When he used impolite words on the list, he was given stern warning. He apologised immediately. He is continuing to choose not to respond on the list. That is his choice. But rejoinders to his position have never been disallowed on the list.
