First of all, is this true? Can a list owner check?

Agree with the above. Being a scholar, I am sure he learned a thing or two as well.

Whence this appearance? Only such "question" I saw incidentally was a comment by Megh about Biden - to which he responded amicably - <https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/wDlPYRQXh0M/m/Bcs37LJIAAAJ> . Definitely not a frequent occurance.

  

There was another instance concerning Vishal, pointed out by RNI at<https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/3Ri47d9I_Ss/m/CUZEDA-gAwAJ> , which might have triggered his exeunt. But that still is not a question.

Couldn't find this comment upon searching. I have not observed this "tendency" at all. The couple of instances of Vishal needling him hardly forms a "tendency". Even there, we can't necessarilysay "unrelatedly", without knowing past events (which even I don't know well).

  

My main point here is that there isn't only one side to a story; and we should not necessarily begrudge peoples' preference to leave rather than acknowledge or explain (let alone regret) past actions. On the one hand, this may entail - in our own selfish interest as students - pretending not to remember the past. On the other, it may mean coming to terms with paying the price in terms of lost knowledge, given the importance of having consequences for certain types of activism.
