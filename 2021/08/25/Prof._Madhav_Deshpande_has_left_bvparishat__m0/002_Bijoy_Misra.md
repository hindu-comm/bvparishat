Dear List members,  

Vishal had a complaint that Madhavji had participated in a petition that was put together to oppose

the Hindu parents in California text book case some fifteen years ago.
It is a question of an artificial

academic view versus a rational political view. American textbooks are badly written and much of  

the material on India does carry a bias.

There is a tendency by some to convert bvparishat to a social group by using unrestrained foul  

language. I as a learner and with my scientific discipline get pained to observe the degradation.  

The question comes to observe how people of Indian origin argue and solve their differences.  

I observe this with our mission here to teach Indian culture to high school students.

It is likely that Madhavji would not return to the list. A list has no representative to apologize.

The concerned individuals may try to heal any hurt by reaching out. It is a pure function of

experimenting how spiritual we are in our core beliefs of human behavior. Madhavji was well  

respected in the list and I am begging him to reconsider joining back in the list.

I am copying Madhavji for his consideration.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra  

.
