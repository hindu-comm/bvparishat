Namaste



I fully agree with Prof. Bijoy Misras position. It does not matter if opinions of two scholars do not see eye to eye.

But the etiquette of respecting another scholar cannot be replaced with the norms of ‘demeaning – denigrating -disrespecting another scholar’. 

The history of Indian academia has enough proofs on lopsided scholarship and people.

Prof Kannan,



**We should not hold scholars to political litmus tests**. There is a vested interest in the west to bring foreigners to india. But the origin of Sanskrit language itself

remains unsolved. It appears indigenous, but we don't have concrete scientific investigations yet on the topic. **To target Prof Deshpande on this score is unfortunate**

**In any case a scholar should have entry in any forum of scholarship**.

It is left to the wisdom, vision and powers that ink their signature for money movement and money growth using ‘Religion-Language – Faith Belief Identity models’ to build a futuristic institution with fully backed HEI (Higher Education Institution) with adequate proactive private investments to harvest political-and polity based ideology to help the global communities, where **scholars warming the named chair will work for pleasing the ‘ Board of Investors steering the policy’ who set up the political –polity- profit –pride litmus tests. **Talk sans Action is travesty of ‘ Karma-yoga’.



How the rest of the world sees at this and responds reacts with what language is matters of no concern in such endeavours, exercising ‘ Freedom to practice a profession of education enterprise for profit’.
Such a model does not justify million dollar chairs crafted out to save a leaf under a large tree. **The roots of tree does not selectively
feed and support the individual leaf on the preferred branch** .’
