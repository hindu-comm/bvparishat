Dear Vishal,

I love your passion and respect your diligence in studying and interpreting  

the scriptures. We have to understand that to navigate through academia  

in a western system is a balancing act. Sometimes survival instincts do

win over the internal beliefs. I do see it every day, people get tortured for  

survival in their middle age.

Many scholars of western origin face artificial walls in order to be "tamed".  

I think Madhavji loves India as much as you and me, but apparently has done

activities which do not appear right. You can show better sense by understanding  

and condoning. Ignorance in the west can only be removed through our  

scholarship and not through isolation.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
