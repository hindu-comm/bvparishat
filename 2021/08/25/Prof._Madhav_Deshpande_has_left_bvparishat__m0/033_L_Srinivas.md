I'm very disappointed that Prof Deshpande has left the list. During his time in the list, people engaged very little with him on his primary area of expertise i.e., Paninian Studies and not at all on his secondary area of expertise i.e., socio-linguistics. He's also extremely knowledgeable on the educational and intellectual atmosphere of 19th century Pune. He doesnt talk about stuff he knows unless he is drawn out. He's also rather tech savvy having designed two nice looking Sanskrit/Vedic fonts way back in the early 90s. I'm sure most people in the group did not know this.  

  

A scholar needs to be looked up to for his scholarship alone. Be that as it may.  

  

The people who are attacking Prof Deshpande, with the exception of one whose posts I have seen for 20 years now, are ignoring a large part of his contributions to this group. I don"t know what they profess except a nebulous Hindu-ness who hate all kinds of Hindus except their own kind. One set hates Hindus who live in America, another set hates Tamil Hindus, another set hates 'northies' etc etc.. The list is endless. These people just remind me of the destructiveness of the likes of CPI ML (Charu Mazumdar) whose biggest enemies have always been CPI ML (Kanu Sanyal) or some such faction and never the 'class enemy'!!

  

Perhaps this group never deserved Prof Deshpande in the first place.
