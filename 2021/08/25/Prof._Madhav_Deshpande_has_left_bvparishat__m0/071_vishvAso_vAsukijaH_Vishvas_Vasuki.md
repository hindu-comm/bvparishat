This is a good description of the list in actual practice, just as something similar would be a good description of India in reality. However, it is as if this happens by accident, and not by design. Just like the Indian state not having Hinduism as the state religion (rather the reverse) comes with a chronic erosive cost, so it is in the case of the list. Making it explicit and conscious will have the benefit of having some common consensus (even vigor) and avoiding "Truschke, Pollock etc.. are all welcome", "Is this dharma pariShat or vidvat pariShat" kind of discord.
