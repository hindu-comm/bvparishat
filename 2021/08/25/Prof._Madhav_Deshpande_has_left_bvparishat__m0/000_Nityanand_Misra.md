Dear list members

  

I came to know that Prof. Madhav Deshpande has left this mailing list. For many years, we learned from his scholarly posts and enjoyed his poetic verses. Needless to say, it is a great loss for bvparishat.

  

It appears Prof. Deshpande was tired of answering questions which clearly did not deserve his time. I recall him writing “But this list has a tendency to drag me into unrelated disputes from time to time” in one of the threads recently.

  

I request the list owners and senior members to please make a formal request to him to join the group again.

  

I also request for a more active moderation of the list so that we do not lose other scholars like him. Scholarly posts (and even scholarly criticism) should be welcome, but irrelevant posts and/or ad-hominem criticism should be disallowed. 

  

Thanks, Nityananda
