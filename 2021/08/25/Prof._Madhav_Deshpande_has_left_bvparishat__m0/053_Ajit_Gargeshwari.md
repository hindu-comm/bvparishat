Dear Prof Paturi ji

  

I am at pained to read posts like this. In fact members like me are great full when profound and great scholars take time to write on this list. I request them to continue to write. I hope this will be last of your such posts on this list and members will write posts in polite and considerate manner. Hate the sin not the sinner and write hate or disagreement s in a way it should be written so that scholars who have diffetent view too can write.
