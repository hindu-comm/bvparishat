Let me now share here publicly on the list. The same Prof. Bijoy Misra did request Prof. Deshpande in a mail copied to the BVP admin members and others to join back BVP. Prof. Deshpande made it clear that that was his final decision and he was not going to come back.

  

The same Prof. Misra expressed his displeasure with the Indology list etc. at<https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/3Ri47d9I_Ss/m/nCM8zOubAQAJ>

  

It appears that he is trying some neutral role while being posted in his position. But it didn't work.

  

Repeated pacification, particularly when it is to be done for expressions with no justifiable reason, has an elastic limit.
