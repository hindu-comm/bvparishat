Surely we must not judge Ravana from his Shivastotras, Hitler from his paintings or the Taliban through their press conferences. Perhaps some list members have judged the persona of someone hated by a section of his own local Indian/Hindu American community because he has consistently not just refused to raise his voice against racism and Hinduphobia but has actually been an active party to this reprehensible behavior by his colleagues and politician cum historians. Today's Truschke's stand on shoulders of people like him, whose vyakarana and chhanda proficiency not-withstanding, they do not have our well being in their heart.

  

1\. In an interview given to his college magazine, he emphasized how westernized he was that he could visit India only as a tourist.

2\. For a while, he was on the governing body of that un-named racist list where 20/21 expelled members were of Indian origin. On that list, he was consistently on the side of the lynch mob who harangued anyone that said anything in favor of RJB (a cause dear to your Guru as well) and against AMT.

3\. His intro to Indian history syllabus in his college had prominent sections on supporting AMT and condemning Hindutva.

4\. He collaborated with R Thapar on a volume that had only 4 authors.

5\. He would triumphantly announce works of R S Sharma, R Kocchar etc on Indology list as 'the best that have come out of India in recent years' (implying that Indian scholarship is shoddy per se).

6\. He worked against the interests of our children by being a prominent spokesperson opposing edits for improving presentation of India and Hindu Dharma in CA textbooks. For instance, other than Witzel, he was the only other academic cited against us in a WSJ article by Dan Golden. Likewise, I have copies of other news articles where he aligned with the likes of Wujastyk, Doniger and J Kripal.

7\. He co-signed political petitions (masquerading as academic petitions) against our interests with the likes of D N Jha, Thapar, Witzel and so on.

  

I could go on and on. But so much in 5 minutes, as someone who has followed him for 25 years. Are we so bygones, as a community of 1.1 billion (or even 1.4 billion) who should feel upset that haters indulging in vyakarana and chhanda have left our list? Did he EVER clarify his hateful behavior? Did he EVER raise his voice against injustices done towards us by his colleagues? He is not apolitical. He is VERY political. There is no evidence that he regrets what he has done to harm our children.

  

Let me leave it at that.
