Dear Sri Ajit ,

  

If your reference is to Sri Vishvas Vasuki , he has been brought under moderation several times during my role as a moderator of this list.

  

Any action more severe than this like banning from posting and banning from the list can not be taken just by a moderator instantly.

  

It needs to be taken collectively by the admin committee in its meeting.
