Prof. Misra,

  

I liked it when you said, "

I do keep away from topics where I am not qualified."

  

I appreciate all the good work you are doing for youngsters.

  

Sri Vishal-ji is talking about a 2005 development related to school children only.

  

He seems to be qualified with regard to that topic.

  

Let us leave it to him.
