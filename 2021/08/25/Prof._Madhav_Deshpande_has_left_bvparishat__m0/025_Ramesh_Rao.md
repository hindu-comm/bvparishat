There is not much more to add to this discussion except maybe a few precautions we can take, and a few observations we can make:

  

Precautions:

  

1\. In social media, including in emails, we tend to rush to judgement and/or to harsh speech. Hitavaachana and priyavaachanawill help. Soochanaa and parushaare seductive and should be avoided as much as possible.

  

2\. Disagreements, if personal, should be taken up back-channel so that we do not threaten each other's face in public/in front of others.

  

Observations:

  

1\. I have been in American academe for 35 years, and while I understand the pressure, especially in R1 universities, to cater to powerful movements/interests/groups, I have also seen that Hindu-centric/supportive faculty rarely speak up, let alone stick their necks out, whereas Hinduphobic folks have no qualms about publicizing their political and ideological affiliations, likes and dislikes, and sign on to a variety of petitions, speak to the media, etc.

  

2\. Vishal Agarwal keeps closer tabs on these matters, but what is disheartening was the unwillingness of most Hindu-centric scholars to have their voices heard during the California textbook debate. By keeping silent they acquiesced to the agenda of the Hinduphobicscholars and activists. Similarly, now that there is a "Dismantling Hindutva" conference scheduled for Sept 10-12 (Ganesha/Gauri pooja time), and some 40 universities/departments are said to be supporting this blatant attack on Hindus/Hinduism in the guise of targeting Hindutva, there is not a pip from those who should be making their voices heard. They seem to care more for their promotion/tenure/awards than to true scholarship.

  

3\. If senior academics/scholars like Prof. Deshpande not only refuse to come to the aid of Hindu students/Hindus/Hinduism but actively encourage the Hinduphobic scholars then we get what we now see in the Western study of Hindus/Hinduism -- a no-holds-barred program of demonizing us.

  

4\. Disagreements about interpreting a text one way or another is not the same as the Hindu demonizing project now in full force that combines the enormous power and clout of monopolist, supremacist, ideological, and violent forces.

  

Regards,

  

Ramesh
