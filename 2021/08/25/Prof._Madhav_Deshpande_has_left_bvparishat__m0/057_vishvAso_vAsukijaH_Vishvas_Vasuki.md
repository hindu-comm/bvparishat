This is a valuable point, which partly answers nityAnanda's "Is this Bharatiya-Vidvat-Parishad or Bharatiya-Dharma-Samsad?"

  

There is absolutely no harm in declaring that BVP's goal is to support scholarship which is pro-Hindu and pro-Hindu-interests. Make it clear that BVP welcomes those who profess to further Hindu interests (including Hindu dominance in India), whatever their views. Even people who are neutral towards these may join- and the only people barred should be those who are against these goals. That is crystal clear filter. Adapt it - don't be like secular India with its perpetual state of confusion. There can be fertile (and polite) exchange of ideas even (or especially) with this clarity.

  

I strongly suggest putting it on the front page where that over-long description (which mostly no one reads) now resides - "'भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्' is a mailing list for Sanskrit researchers working from India (\<-- replace this - it seems to confuse folks like Ajit)."
