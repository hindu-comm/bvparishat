Dear Shri Paturi Garu,

  

Moderation if converted into dictatorship would stifle the free speech that many in this group claim to stand for. I was not aware of the background of this case until I read some of the back and forth and discrepancies in the words of some scholars. Ad-hominem is a very western construct that ignores the fact that if the pAtra is impure so are its contents. Next comes the issue of "politeneness"...I fail to see when calling a spade a spade became impolite.

If anyone has doubts in this regard all they have to do is revisit the episode of Rama giving a tongue lashing to rShi Jabali. The truth should not twisted for good or bad. Are we really so advanced that we consider ourselves better than Rama? I for certain think not.

I think the scholar in question should be given the opportunity to explain himself so that some of this infamy (if such it is) may go away for good and not revisit like a persistent nightmare.

  

Yes. A scholar is very valuable. But at the cost of dharma/truth/fairness? I think not.

Better to be a Vikarna and die on the battlefield with one's honor intact than be a superannuated Bhishma pitamaha and watch the chirharan of Draupadi (dharma) while having the power to destroy the problem at source.

  

The Mahabharata has taught many things the most important of which is this:

\*\*\* The patience of great men (Yudhisthira/The long suffering dharmic Hindu) has disastrous consequences. It is better to call a spade a spade than tap dance around inequity and wait for the momentum to build up and become a flood that brings the ocean to the mountain-tops.

  

My fullest respect to Vishal Agarwal .

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
