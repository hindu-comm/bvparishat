I said I will not respond to this thread, but I have to say L. Srinivas Ji is correct. There have been many personal and ad-hominem attacks on Prof. Deshpande on this list over the years. If my memory serves me right, he was called गुरुण्डोच्छिष्टभोजी on this very list by Vishal Agarwal once. The list owners did not censor the word. They did not intervene. This despite Prof. Deshpande being on the Advisory Board of BVP. And this despite Prof. Deshpande always being civil and nice in his exchanges including his exchanges with Vishal Agarwal on this list.

  

Even as of now, this is what bvparishat description reads

**Advisory Board**

**Prof. Ashok Aklujkar, Prof. Dipak Bhattacharya, Prof. Madhav Deshpande, Prof. Amba Kulkarni, Prof. K.S. Kannan and Prof. R.N. Iyengar**

  

So it is nothing but ridiculous if BVP does not even have problems with Prof. Deshpande, a member (or a former member in case the description is outdated) of it advisory board being called names by people who are self-appointed guardians of *dharma* \[as they understand it\].

  

I am also glad to read messages from Prof. R. N. Iyengar and Sh. Ajit Gargeshwari.
