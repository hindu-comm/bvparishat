Hawley, N. S. (2021). Literature in Layers: An Early Theory of Retelling the Sanskrit Epics,*Journal of South Asian Intellectual History*,*3*(1), 1-33. doi:<https://doi.org/10.1163/25425552-12340021>

"This essay reconstructs an early chapter in the history of theorizing the diverse*Rāmāyaṇa*and*Mahābhārata*literature of South Asia. Drawing upon the tenth-century literary theorist Kuntaka’s discussions of the*Udāttarāghava, Uttararāmacarita, Veṇīsaṃhāra, Kirātārjunīya*, and*Abhijñānaśākuntala*—all Sanskrit poetic (*kāvya*) compositions that depict stories from the*Rāmāyaṇa*or the*Mahābhārata*—I show how, in Kuntaka’s understanding, these works repair certain narrative inconsistencies and ethical ambiguities in the epics themselves. Building on the foundation laid by his predecessor, Ānandavardhana, Kuntaka illuminates the various layers of meaning that a work of literature can encompass. He shows that the epics’ different narrative layers send conflicting messages about proper conduct. He suggests, moreover, that an audience experiences a*kāvya*retelling of an epic story as a layered entity—a layer of epic narrative beneath a layer of*kāvya*—and argues that an awareness of these layers can contribute to the audience’s ethical self-cultivation. Kuntaka’s theory of retelling (truly*re*-telling: telling again, purposefully, and differently from a previous accepted telling) represents an important theoretical account of the relationships between South Asia’s many*Rāmāyaṇa*s and many*Mahābhārata*s."
