Folks interested in learning about Deobandi movement (of which tAlibAn is a part), might listen to these presentations <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia_puSJRxlI> and <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfNprH9xZAU> . Though focused on tablighi jamAt (a deobandi offshoot), it goes into a good deal of pre-deobandis who are highly venerated by deobandis including tablighis (starting from shAh waliullah who invited abdAli and tried to get muslim kings to ban public hindu rituals, syed ahmed barelvi who died in a jihAd against the sikhs in balAkoT, shariatullah of bengal, TiTumIr who died doing a jihAd against the brits) and even the flopped jihAd of Mahmud Hasan, aka Shaykh al-Hind. It also goes into how Indian muslims (materially, ideologically, etc..) have for long contributed to the global "ummah".
