Just for the record, for people who do not know Kannada.

a translation of the words of HH Swarnavalli Mutt Swamiji:

  

“The passing of the scholar Pandit Kothimanagalam Sudarshana Varadacharya has cause great sorrow for me.

The scholar is of such experience that an entire day proves to be insufficient when one tries to talk about him. The pearls of wisdom that we have learned from him are so priceless that every time that we try to perform Japa dhyana or puja, we are reminded of him, any day that we try to read a book, he comes to our mind at least twice or thrice. When we experience the passages taught by him, we are reminded of him. Having illuminated the world for a very long life of nearly a century, there is no doubt that this sun of a scholar shall continue to shine with his influence and talent for millennia to come.

I pray to the Almighty to rest his holy soul whilst being certain of it. I also beseech the worshipful Lord to grant solace to the family of Sri KSV and the entire fraternity of Sanskrit scholars for their irreplaceable loss”

- Sondha Svarnavalli MahaSamsthAna – Srimad GangAdharEndra Sarasvathi Mahaswami –Srimad Jagad-guru Shankaracharya
