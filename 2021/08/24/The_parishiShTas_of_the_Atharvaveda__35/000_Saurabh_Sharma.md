Respected Members,

  

I found the Volume I - Part 2 of the the Pariśiṣṭas of the Atharvaveda edited by George Bolling and Julius Negelein on this archive link -<https://archive.org/details/Bolling19093> , which deal with the Pariśiṣṭas no. 37 - 72. I was unable to find Part 1 of the text on [archive.org](http://archive.org) or anywhere else. Does anyone have a pdf of it?

  

Best regards,

Saurabh Sharma
