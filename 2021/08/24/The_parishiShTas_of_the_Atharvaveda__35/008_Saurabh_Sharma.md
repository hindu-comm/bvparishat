Atharvaveda Parishishtas are really fascinating, especially in the context of the evolving omen and astrological traditions

of vedic culture in the last centuries BCE. It draws heavily from the Garga samhita / Gargiya-jyotisha for it's omen and astral

materials, a text which is currently being edited and studied by various scholars. Another important text associated with the

atharvaveda is the shanti kalpa and is one of the five atharvanic kalpas. Part I of the text has portions on astral worship and

ritual countermeasures. Can the vedic scholars on the group suggest further reading on the shantikalpa, and provide a rough

dating of the text (Pingree suggests babylonian influence on related texts like Kaushika sutra placing them post 500 BCE).
