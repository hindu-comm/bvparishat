I think I downloaded a PDF of vol. 1 part 1 from the Internet Archive, years ago. But right now I cannot find it there; possibly it has been removed

for some reason. In any case you can download the PDF I have from this [wetransfer.com](http://wetransfer.com) link, which should be valid for a week:

With all good wishes,
