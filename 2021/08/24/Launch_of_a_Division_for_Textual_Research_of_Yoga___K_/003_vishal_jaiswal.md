Wonderful initiative !

And yet texts remain mere indices to what can only be learnt under a genuine yogi as far as practical yoga is concerned - I refer to hathayoga and rajayoga.

Hopefully this practical yoga is preserved for posterity in the hands of such yogis in remote corners of the country.
