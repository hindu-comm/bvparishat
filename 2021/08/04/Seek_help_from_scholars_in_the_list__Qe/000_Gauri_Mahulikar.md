Hari Om!

Dear list of scholars,

I am forwarding below an email from Swami Swatmanandaji of Chinmaya Mission, Mumbai

I solicithelp in this regard from the scholarly world.

  

*Hari om. Namaskaar. *

*  
*

*Hope you are doing well. Chinmaya Yuva Kendra Mumbai is working on a theatrical play on Swami Vidyaranyaji. We wanted your help to reach out to any scholars who may be well-versed with the works of Swami Vidyaranyaji. Especially the following works:*

*  
*

*1. Kaalamaadhava or Kaalnirnaya: about determining time for festivals, rituals etc.*

*2. Sarvadarshana Sangraha: about various schools of philosophy*

*3. Jaiminiya Nyayamaalaavistaara: about Rituals.*

*4. Paraashara Smriti vyakhyaa and the Vyavahaarakanda that he added to it and how Paraashara Smriti is used even now in South India for Hindu law*

*5. Veda bhashya that he contributed to, along with his brother Sayanacharya*

*6. Puraana-saar*

*7.Sangeeta-Saar: It expounds the principles of South Indian classical music. The treatise is not available presently it seems. But, in Tanjore King Naresh Raghunath's Sangeeta-Sudha, mention is made of Madhavacharya's knowledge about music and the 2nd chapter of this work mentions that Sangeeta Saar is a composition of Madhavacharya*

*  
*

*Panchadashi, Jivanmukti Viveka, Drgdrshya Viveka & Shankara Digvijaya also we are planning to cover.*

*  
*

*We want to depict the essence or some inspiring facts from the above works for the youth in a way that they understand the glory of Swami Vidyaranyaâ€™s spiritual contribution, apart from the establishment of Vijayanagara empire. Your ideas & suggestions for these are also most welcome. Thank you. *

*  
*

*Hari Om.*

*Swami Swatmananda*
