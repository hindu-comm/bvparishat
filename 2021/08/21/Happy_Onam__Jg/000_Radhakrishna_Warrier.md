Wish a happy Onam to all members of the BV Parishat.

  

The day of Onam starts with offering Ada (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(food)>) as naivedyam to

Gaṇapati and Tṛkkākkara Appan (തൃക്കാക്കര അപ്പൻ). The pyramidal shapes made of mud represent Tṛkkākkara Appan. Usually these are decorated with flowers, especially the hibiscus. Tṛkkākkara Appan is supposed to be Vāmana of the Tṛkkākkara temple. The major ingredient of the Onam day breakfast is also Ada. The other ingredients are steamed ripe plantain and plantain chips. Puṭṭŭ, Dōśa or iḏḏali are optional. The lunch is the famous ōṇam Sadya (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadhya>) .
