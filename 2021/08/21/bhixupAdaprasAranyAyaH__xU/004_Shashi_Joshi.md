There is a very popular saying in Hindi (lokokti)

\- उंगली पकड़ कर पाउंचा पकड़ना

which is about, when you are showing the way to someone, they hold your finger, and soon they grab your wrist and (mis)lead you, or force you to go elsewhere..

  

Imagine a kid holding your finger while crossing the road.  

  

So, someone starts out innocent, and seeking help, but quickly they take over and hold you hostage.

  

This 'भिक्षुपादप्रसारन्यायः' is like that, also called 'squatting'.

  

The comedy movie 'HouseSitter' elaborates it humorously.
