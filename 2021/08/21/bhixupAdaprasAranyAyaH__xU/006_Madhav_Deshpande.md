There is a Marathi proverb that exactly picks the meaning of भिक्षुपादप्रसारण. It says: भटाला दिली ओसरी, भट हातपाय पसरी. "You give the porch to the priest, and then he spreads his legs". This suggests that you give a little bit of access to someone, and then he takes over more. भट in Marathi, like the word भटजी refers to a Brahmin priest, but the other Marathi word meaning the same is भिक्षुक.
