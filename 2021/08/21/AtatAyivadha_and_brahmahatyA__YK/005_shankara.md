Kushagra ji,

  

I had seen this, before posting the query. The purpose of my query was to resolve the apparent contradiction between theory and practice. Though dharmasastras verses like those quoted in your post declare that there is no sin in killing an Atatayi Brahmana, we find that Indra and Sri Rama performed prayaschitta for brahmahatya after the killing of Vritra and Ravana.  

  

regards  
shankara
