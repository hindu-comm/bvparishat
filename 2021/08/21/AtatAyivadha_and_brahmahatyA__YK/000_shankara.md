Pranams!

  

Dharmasastras say that there is no sin in killing a desperado (Atatayi) even if he is a srotriya-brahmana (Manusmriti 8.350-351)

  

गुरुं वा बालवृद्धौ वा ब्राह्मणं वा बहुश्रुतम् ।  
आततायिनमायान्तं हन्यादेवाविचारयन् ॥ ८.३५०॥  
नाततायिवधे दोषो हन्तुर्भवति कश्चन ।  
प्रकाशं वाऽप्रकाशं वा मन्युस्तं मन्युमृच्छति ॥ ८.३५१॥

  

But, we also find in Srimad Bhagavata Skandha 6 chapters 11-13, that Indra was affected by the sin of Brahmahatya after the vadha of Visvarupa as well as Vritra.  

  

एवं सञ्चोदितो विप्रैर्मरुत्वानहनद्रिपुम्।  
ब्रह्महत्या हते तस्मिन्नाससाद वृषाकपिम्॥ Bhagavata 6.13.10  

  

As per Skanda Purana 3.1.47.37-45, Sri Rama incurred the sin of Brahmahatya after killing Ravana and his brothers who were brahmanas, after which Sri Rama installed a Sivalinga at Ramesvaram to expiate this sin.

If there is no sin in killing an Atatayin, how did Brahmahatya sin affect Indra and Sri Rama? Kindly explain.
