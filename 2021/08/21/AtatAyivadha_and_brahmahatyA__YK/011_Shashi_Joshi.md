Is it possible that the expression of dharma changes with time (local dharma), and hence the differences in dharmashastra is (or should be) there.

Like amendments to constitutions from time to time.

  

We confuse between janmanA-varNa and karmaNA-varNa.

A karmaNA shrotriya-brAhmaNa will not act in AtatAyI fashion.

If he does, his shrotriya part is only hasti-snAna.

  

AtatAyI is not one who kills, or does violence.

AtatAyI is one who does violence for no fault of the receiver,to instill fear.

Self-defense makes anything permissible, because if no self, then no dharma, no jagat - all gone back to mAyA.

  

We must not be so wrapped up in theory, that we forget practice.

  

Our stories are always to give a message, and as times and values change, stories and their elaboration also change.

The times of purANa-s, many of them, is after the real AtatAyinsstarted pouring in!

  

And to give the example of shrotriya-brAhmaNa is to give the superlative that - *even if*such a respected person does karma that is not respectable, then don't hesitate.

  

The pApa of killing an AtatAyinis fractional of the puNya of maintained the dharma. And it will less than the unavoidable himsA done in daily chores. AtatAyin disturbs the dharma/balance of society, and is like a wound. What is the pApa for healing a wound, and killing the desperado cells :) :)

  

At the end, life is killing life. So who is at fault - the one who started? or the one who defended?

  

The real AtatAyI who came looking for bounty, had no shrotriya-brAhmaNa at all!
