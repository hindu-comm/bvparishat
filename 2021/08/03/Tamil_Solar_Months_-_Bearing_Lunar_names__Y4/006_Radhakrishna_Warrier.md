In Kerala, festival days, birthdays etc. are reckoned based on nakshatra and the solar month.

  

The moonlight of Ōṇam (Ōṇa nilāvŭ) is a favorite of the Malayalam poets.
Do we always have moonlit nights during the time of the Ōṇam festival? If so, why?

  

The Śravaṇa (Ōṇam) nakṣatra is in the Makara Rāśi that spans roughly a 30° segment of the sky on the ecliptic (sun’s apparent path along the celestial sphere). The festival day of Tiruvōṇam occurs when the moon is near Śravaṇa (Ōṇam) in the month Chingam (Ciṅṅam ചിങ്ങം). The month of Chingam is so named because in that month the sun is in the Simha Rāśi. The beginning of Simha Rāśi which also spans roughly a 30° segment of the sky on the ecliptic is about 150° away from the beginning of Makara. In this situation there will be an angular distance of 120° to 180° between the sun and the moon. Full moon occurs when the angular distance between the sun and the moon is approximately 180°. With an angular separation between the sun and the moon of 120° to 180°, we can expect a beautiful moonlit night if the sky is not overcast.

  

This I think is the logic of reckoning festival days based on nakṣatra and the solar month. This way, we can expect fairly consistent phase of the moon for the festival day. Those knowledgeable in astronomy (not astrology) may please correct me if I am wrong.
