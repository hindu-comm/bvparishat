Dear Murthy Sir,

Thank you for your response. Yes, The trend of following solar months, as you have pointed out in the case of Udupi region for कृष्णाष्टमी, is seen in some regions. I can cite another case. Brahmins belonging to some particularAgrahara-s of Palghat (the present name is Palakkad), perform Yajurupaakarman on the पूर्णिमा day of सिंहमास . This, of course, has the approval of some Smrti-s.

However my point is about the tamil tradition having Lunar names for Solar months. How much antiquity has this tradition got?Is there another set of names for solar months (or lunar months) in Old tamil literature? Has oral tradition got to say anything about this? Is there anydocument/study/discussion/ deliberation dealing with this issue?

Certainly this issue might have been noticed and discussed by scholars. I would like to get sources of such discussions and studies.

Thanks and regards,

nks
