Namaste Sir  

  

There are some coastal regions in Karnataka also following solar methods. Last year in 2020 Krishna Janmashtami in Udupi was in Bhadrapada Krishna Paksha and not in Sravana Krishna Paksha. Why? Because they believe Surya should be in Simha Rashi for Krishna Janmashtami. Last year Sravana Krishna Ashtami the Sun was in Karkataka and not Simha. When this happens they skip one month and go to Bhadrapada Krishna Ashtami.

  

But non coastal areas do not follow this rule. The inland people believe in Lunar calendar here. Some scholars have shown the Lunar calendar is more ancient and in tune with Vedic and Puranic sources. The Solar calendar is more recent.
