Dear Sri Rajagopalan,

Thanks.

Yes, what you say is right. The solar month Mesha (when Sun traverses the Mesha part of the zodiac) corresponds to the lunar month Chitra ( time taken for the moon to complete one cycle of waxing and waning - usually named basing on the asterism in which Moon happens to be on the full moon day) and so on. And the fact that the names of Tamil months can be derived from (or are tadbhava-s of) Sanskrit names Chitra etc. is also well-known.

But in the process of forming a Luni-solar calendar why the names of months are retained in the Tamil region, even as the new concept of a solar month was accepted? (In the other regions the months have always been reckoned on lunar basis) That's the question. Another point I would like to raise is this: Is there anther set of months, be solar or lunar, which was in vogue in any period of time in the Tamil tradition?
