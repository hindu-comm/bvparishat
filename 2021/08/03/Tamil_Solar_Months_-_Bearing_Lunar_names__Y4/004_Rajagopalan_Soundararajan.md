Dear Sri NKS,

The months are named using solar positions in the Zodiac, for example: Mesha, Rishabha etc. The months are also named after the position of the Moon i..e when the Full Moon occurs in the nakshatra chart. In the month of Mesha, the Full Moon generally occurs in the start Chittirai and hence the month is named Chittirai. Similarly, Vaikasi (Visaka), Ani (Jyeshta), Adi (Ashada), Avani/Shravanam (Thiruvonam), Purattasi (Purattadi), Aippasi (Revati), Kartigai (Kruttigai), Margazi (mrugashirsham), Thai/Pushyam (Poosam), Maasi (Makam), Panguni (Uttiram-Uttara palguni).

The Tamil names of months are a mix of both conventions; Chittirai, Vaikasi, Kartigai etc follow the Full Moon convention. It also appears some names like Margazi, Masi, Panguni etc are variations over time from the Sanskrit originals such as Mrigashirsham, Makam, Uttara palguni etc. Even Adi seems to have been derived from Ashada. Of course Avani is a variation of Shravanam.

  

Thanks
