The Indian sub-continent has a vast and varied corpus of dancing traditions, birthed, in the context of the temples, courts and popular presentations in temple courtyards or streets. Some of these traditions took their genesis as female centric solo traditions called the ‘Nattuva Melam’ and some, as male centric, theatrical traditions called the ‘Natya Melam’.
