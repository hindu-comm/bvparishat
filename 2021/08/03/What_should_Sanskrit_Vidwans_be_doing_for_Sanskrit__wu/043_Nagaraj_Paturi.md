Sanskrit is one of the languages under 8th schedule.

  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Schedule_to_the_Constitution_of_India>  
  
The**Eighth Schedule**to the[Constitution of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India "Constitution of India")lists the official[languages of the Republic of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_India). At the time when the Constitution was enacted, inclusion in this list meant that the language was entitled to representation on the[Official Languages Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Languages_Commission "Official Languages Commission"),^([\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Schedule_to_the_Constitution_of_India#cite_note-1))

  

and that the language, here **Sanskrit**, would be one of the bases that would be drawn upon to enrich Hindi and English, the[official languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_languages "Official languages")of the Union.^([\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Schedule_to_the_Constitution_of_India#cite_note-2))

  

The list has since, however, acquired further significance.

  

The Government of India is now under an obligation to take measures for the development of these languages,here**Sanskrit,**such that "they,here**Sanskrit,**grow(s) rapidly in richness and become effective means of communicating modern knowledge."^([\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Schedule_to_the_Constitution_of_India#cite_note-3))

  

In addition, a candidate appearing in an examination conducted for public service is entitled to use any of these languages,here**Sanskrit,**as the medium in which he or she answers the paper.^([\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Schedule_to_the_Constitution_of_India#cite_note-4))
