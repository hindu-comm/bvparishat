Namaste



On \< mAtrA-flexibility is not a feature of kannaDa barring such exception (and the north KA dialect mentioned by ujjvala) AFAIK>



mAtrA-flexibility is also observed and a feature of kannaDa haidasa sahitya and sharana sahitya/ janapada sahitya.

Voiced documents reflect it. The illustrations can be noticed in several compositions of ‘dasa’s, sharanas and local singers’.

Listening discerning audience make ‘human alignment and dynamic adjustment for capturing ‘intent, and word-pointers’ in the composition.
