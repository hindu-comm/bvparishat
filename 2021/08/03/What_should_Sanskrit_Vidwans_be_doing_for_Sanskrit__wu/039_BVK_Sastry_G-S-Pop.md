Namaste



A Care –point that may have to be contemplated on \< can read, write and speak Sanskrit \> may be contemplated on following lines.



 \[ ***Note***: Before proceeding further, I acknowledge whole heartedly all the work done by many for keeping up the Samskruth Social awareness and Spread movements for the monumental great work at India and globally for keeping ‘samskruth interest: socially and technologically alive in secular india’ and ‘ beyond India. It
deserves all appreciation. In fact, I have been a part and parcel of
this movement and a beneficiary. \]



a) **Read /Write factor**: Ability to read – write ‘devanagari script’ used generally for Sanskrit ( in school education and business / governance at large does not give a clear marker for statistics.
Devanagari script is used by many other indian languages. Sanskrit is read-written in non-devanagari scripts.



b) **Speak factor : **Ability to ‘recite- chant’ is not any equivalent of ‘scale used in census/ schooling / training for social usage-speak factor in society and community ’ for other languages.

Main comparison mode and model, using unarticulated standard to build a public opinion is English / indic regional language/mother tongue (Home/school/ conversational) versus Sanskrit ( bending Bhashaa where the real target is ‘chandas’). This issue remains ‘ unaddressed and not remedied’. 



The above comparison choice is set by, sustained and continued in the past several decades by:

· by design as a trap in ‘language-pooling and mix up of social and classical languages,

· by default to appeal to lay-people and tap sentiments and emotions dormant from colonial roots,

· by preference with hand-in glove work of politicized language interest in academia,

· by perpetuation of mistakes in capturing the essence and essentials of ‘Paninian-Samskrutham-Standards’,

· by opportunity-choice to tap program resource support from the elite who prefer to save the head even when ‘feet is hurt/ cut’.



 ( Analysis of Current state of Samskruth and post-mortem root-cause –analysis may be a luxury for Samskruth at this point ! when technology is capturing the grounds to emerge as ‘Human- Language –Standards- Enforcer’ ; thanks to efforts of ‘computational linguists, AI and MT teams).Good and bad as given reality and outcome is relative and contextual; as a mid-game position in chess or cards!



*What could be / seems to be the remedy measure and resource needs to address for improving Sanskrit- Census-Score* :

*and connected issue* : How to restore Guru-kul-Bhashaa standards in Social and School Literacy ( class room and digital) through NEP ?

Which alone can build and contribute to ‘numbers needed to be reflected in Census report as
*Sanskrit- Census-Score* ’. 



This is still a open question connected to the speed and mode of NEP 2020 implementation modalities and speed.

Look forward for views from learned leaders and implementers.
