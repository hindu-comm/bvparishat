Namaste



Digital Technologies have demanded a new thinking process on
identifying the \<need and difference between language as spoken and written>.

In the human mode, Language- regulation was direct and contained in ‘ human standard frame’.



With the advent of digital smart devices the ‘ visual of voice =
lipi-roopa of varna-akshara’ – has attracted intervention of techno-linguists in this process.

The ‘font- logic’ placed in ‘system-memory’ and ‘ logic of display rendering on screen’ contributes to how language –digital documents get proliferated in studies.



I share one document addressing ‘FONTS’ in which ‘Samskruth/Devanagari/ Brahmi scripts…’ .

This may be of importance and interest for action in addressing the theme: ‘What should Sanskrit Vidwans be doing for Sanskrit’ to keep ‘Human language standard in devices’ .

And how keying errors do not augmented and enhanced by
‘techno-linguistic’ interventions pl ? like the split of sandhi’s, white space and the like ?

\< तत्र ह्रस्वदीर्घभेदं स्पष्टं दृश्यते - ह्रस्वंदीर्घवन् न वदन्ति - अपि तु दीर्घीकृत्य लब्धं मराठीशब्दं **सुद्धम्** एव वदन्तीति भाति।

किं नामात्रोच्यते ऽच्युतादिभिर् ह्रस्वदीर्घविवेकाभावे तर्हि?

Dear friends,



I am a student of music. What is the difference in speech while it is spoken and written. We speak in madhya laya. However when we write the laya or tempo is reduced to 1/4th of that when we speak. If a person is not sensitive enough he starts writing with the help of memory of script forms of words.



In short the written word cannot be taken as a standard for deciphering how a word was uttered or spoken. No wonder that people use convention for writing words. The rules for suddha lekhan are precisely meant for that purpose.



With regards,

Achyut Karve.
