I did say: (Albeit just to fit the meter, some poets rarely changed vowel length - eg. kumAravyAsa used नारयण instead of नारायण )

  

Perhaps I should have said "meter and rhythm" and "poets and song-writers" to be more comprehensive. mAtrA-flexibility is not a feature of kannaDa barring such exception (and the north KA dialect mentioned by ujjvala) AFAIK.
