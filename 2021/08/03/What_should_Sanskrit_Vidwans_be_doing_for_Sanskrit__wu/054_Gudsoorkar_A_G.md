Thank you very much Dr Nagaraj for sharing this link.

  

The above seems to be very effective for primary school children. However, there are some PGs in Sanskrit like me, who can not converse in Sanskrit. There’s plethora of Institutions/Agencies advertising for the purpose. But, I am unable to decipher which one will really serve.

  

I request you to suggest some Institution(s) with Online Courses with our Objective to help aspirants like us. Regards.
