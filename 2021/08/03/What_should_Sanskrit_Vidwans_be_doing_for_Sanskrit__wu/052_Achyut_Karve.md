If one observes keenly very few children passing out from 10th Std speak English in spite of having been instructed in English for over ten years. However when these same children enter the work force one finds that a big chunk of them start conversing in English. Why so?

  

Speaking a language which is not one's mother tongue even after it being one's medium of instruction is a difficult proposition.

  

One needs to appreciate that a majority in the population are uniligual, some are bilingual and only a few are multi lingual. How many countries in the world follow a three language formula?

  

If Sanskrit is introduced at the first level itself it Wii improve the percentage of bilingual and multi lingual population which is very important for s country like India.

  

In short sanskrit offers great flexibility of the tongue to an individual .

  

With regards,

Achyut karve .
