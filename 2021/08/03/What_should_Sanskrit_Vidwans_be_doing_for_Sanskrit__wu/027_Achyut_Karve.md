My father who as a doctor worked in a missionary hospital in Bangalore in the 1930's used to describe the missionary attitude thus -

  

'Give me a child till the age of 10 and then take him away. He will thereafter ever remain mine.'

  

We start introducing Sanskrit in Schools when the child is 11 years or 13 years. In what way will this help in taking the mission of Sanskrit ahead because by that time the child's (lingual) tongue has already got stabilized.

  

If anything needs to be done for Sanskrit it is necessary that Sanskrit needs to be introduced at least at the age of 6. It is during the period that language skills develop the fastest. Have adult literacy programmes ever succeeded?

  

For this to happen a big army of Sanskrit primary teachers has to assembled.

  

From my experience Sanskrit montessories or primary schools need not do it at the cost of English or other vernacular languages. At the age of 11 the child or it's guardian can decide whether the child wants to continue formal education in Sanskrit or in any other language.

  

Chammu Shastri's work is in that direction. It is no wonder therefore that he has diplomatically criticised the work that has been taken up through government aided institutions.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
