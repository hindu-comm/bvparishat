Dear Vishvas Ji,

  

  To specify more details, the variation of vowel length in Marathi poetry occurs primarily in इ/ई and उ/ऊ. The अ/आ variation often happens when followed by a consonant cluster, e.g. तत्काळ/तात्काळ, where the metrical value of the syllable still remains Guru. The word-final इ is now almost always a long ई in modern Marathi pronunciation, and this has now been admitted in the latest official writing reform. So Sanskrit रवि is now written as रवी in Marathi, and so is the other Marathi word रवी referring to a wooden tool used to churn buttermilk. The Sanskrit word कवि is now written in Marathi with long ई as in the word देवी. The stress in Marathi falls on the last syllable making it phonetically somewhat longer.
