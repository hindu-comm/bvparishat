Today many scholars through their institutions as well as at individual level are engaged in improving the literacy of Sanskrit. My question is can we make an effort to streamline this effort?

  

Recently, I conducted classes for children aged 11 years to 14 years using Satavalekar's 'Swayam Shikshak'. The classes were aimed to make the children conversant in reading Sanskrit giving special attention of short and long vowels. To my surprise over a three month period not only did the children show improved skills in reading Sanskrit but it also helped them to read formal languages be it Marathi, Hindi or English better.

  

There is no dearth of study material to learn Sanskrit. The problem is of personalized instruction which is difficult to get in the days of mass education. Is the Guru shishya parampara becoming a bottle-neck for the advancement of Sanskrit studies. Is there a way out?
