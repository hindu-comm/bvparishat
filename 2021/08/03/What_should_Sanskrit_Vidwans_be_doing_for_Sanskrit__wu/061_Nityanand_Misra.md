Namaste, h. Achyut Karve Ji

  

I was not doubting your credentials in my email. I was merely asking for two things to back your claim (1) a sound recording of Maheshvara Sutras in your voice (2) a list of specific errors you have noticed in pronunciation of Maheshvara Sutras. If (1) is too much for you to arrange, you may please provide (2) for now.

अदर्शनं लोपः, not आदर्शनं लोपः.

As the rootदृश् means both“to see” and “to perceive, to know”, the word दर्शनम् can have multiple meanings, and so canअदर्शनम्. This being the context of shabda-shastra, it clearly does not have to do anything with “seeing” (just like the sense of दृश् in सा निशा पश्यतो मुनेः, BG 2.69). So अदर्शनम् here would mean “non-perception” or more specifically “non-audibility”, (taking दर्शनम् = दृश्+ ल्युट्), and “non-experssion” or more specifically “non-articulation” (taking दर्शनम् =दृश्+ णिच् + ल्युट्). You may refer Kashika, Nyasa, Siddhantakaumudi, etc. on this, or the English translation of Ashtadhyayi by Rama Nath Sharma. I am not sure if this is the answer you seek, but I answered anyway.

  

Now can you please answer my questions?

  

Thanks, Nityananda
