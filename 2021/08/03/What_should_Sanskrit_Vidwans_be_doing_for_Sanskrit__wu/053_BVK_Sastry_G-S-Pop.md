Namaste



On \< What is श्रेयस्कर so that Sanskrit gets its due is my question? … starting a primary school with Sanskrit as the medium of instruction is the only remedy .. If Chamu Shastri's dream is to materialize…… \> :



***My thoughts shared ( and why the issue is intricate and important. ) ***: Karve ji, You have raised multi-layered, important, relevant, intrinsically intertwined and intricate issues for implementation in ‘given – current- Indian society’, using a referential ‘ past –peak of glory’ and ‘ sprinkle of praise from global appreciators’. All nice and pleasing. But Forward driving needs working vehicle with fuel and driver who can ‘look forward, drive on given reality of road and ‘deliver safely. Use rear view and side mirrors has value and benefits for a course correction in audit. But clear looking forward through a clean glass is critical. One cannot hope to drive forward looking in rear view mirror and efficient use of reverse gear ! History is not future !



Path of Progress as \< श्रेयस्कर : abhyudaya- nishreayas\> is not
designing actions for recreating history by dismantling current structure. One is free for their choice of path and actions.



The ground reality of ‘Panini- rule regulated language – education- implementation’ needed to understand- practice- benefit from ‘ Gita embedded Maha-Bharath’ – conversation model ( sambhashana-samvaada) has changed in ‘ Bharat that has become India ( Postcolonial/ Post NEP – policy marker. There are new issues some being colonial legacy and some are techno-linguistic/ techno-commercial legacy. 



Todays ‘Sanskrit- teaching: Education –pedagogy model ’ for ‘ NEP 2020 - policy provided Education Implementation Model’ within the ‘ polity- vision ( not political reality / party- preferential agenda) for tomorrows benefits/ beneficiaries needs to be derived out of the essence of tradition ( rasa- atmaa) which needs to have a ‘ new physical reality body, dress and overcoat’ to walk the global terrain of ‘ Languages: Human and Programming’. For this, the two ends are ‘ Universities ( of Languages and Technologies) at higher end) and
Schools (State and Central regulated) at other end.



The proposed primary school needs to emerge as a First Entry - Primary entry point where the early learner ( at 1^(st) standard) gets hands on Brahmi-Devanagari- Samskruth based - Edu-Tech.

The syllabus design should connect Sanskrit to all Indian regional mother tongue (human/ social/ cultural / arts / humanities / science and prayer) language families, using ‘Brahmi Varna-akshara’ voice model, where ‘ Maheswara –sutra / Barakhadi training needs to be an integral part. This is where restoring the Paninian language model by
three key words: ‘ Vedanga, Vak-Yoga, Brahmi’ become bench markers in syllabus and teaching methodology design and delivery through the smart devices. This would make India as a nation which uses a technology that connects all the languages of nation using the root-design of ‘ Bharateeya – Bhashaa: Bhaarati – Sarasvati’. Here we need to design and deliver a fusion of Samskruth Language – Jnana with Tantra-jnanan for \< Jeevikaa – vyavahara> as Edu-Tech system’ implementation. This is the wish. Market and Beneficiaries: See NEP for details.



***The given reality***: ‘Panini language (Voice Primary and Supreme) is delivered using ‘ ‘romanized representation in spelling –primary anglicised mode which need a precondition of ‘software –app enabled- smart techno-device’ to get trained on a syllabus delivering a hybrid perspective of ‘what Samskruth was’ – colonial from back and Vedic from further backwards view point. 

The regulators are not the ‘acharyas’ ( no bheeshma-drona –tataa ! any talk of this is a lip sympathy). The ‘kuru-kshetra’ reality emerges from implementation agencies guarding the spine, heart and brain of constitution through departments, budget allocations and ‘Technology funding’. Show the market and changes get aligned. And Education market size and the prize of this war: See NEP for charts for details. The
real time line to reach the goal is 2025, for India to take care of \< modalities to get श्रेयस्कर output from Samskrutham: The Paninin language, short represented in colonial model as Sanskrit !
