Dear Friends,

  

More importantly Sanskrit studies need to be revived for establishing 'Dharma' and this can only be achieved if children are initiated into Sanskrit at an early age.

  

Secondly, teaching a language without recourse to another language can only happen early in the child's life. As the child grows the child's ability to inculcate a new language independently greatly diminishes.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.

  

With regards,

Achyut
