What does the video show? It shows that Sanskrit is an endangered language. Do we not hear that a particular speicies of a bird, animal or fish was spotted in a remote corner of the forest or ocean which was believed to have become extinct?

  

This is what the video tells. Where there should have been lakhs of such children communicating in Sanskrit there are but a few.

  

Government sponsored institutions dedicated to the preservation , protection and promotion of Sanskrit need to be spending on children rather than on scholars.

  

This might be what Chammu Shastra wanted to convey.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
