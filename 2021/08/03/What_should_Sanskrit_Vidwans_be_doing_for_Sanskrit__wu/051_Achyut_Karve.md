What is श्रेयस्कर so that Sanskrit gets its due is my question?

  

To my mind starting a primary school with Sanskrit as the medium of instruction is the only remedy so that in the days to come Sanskrit will stand shoulder to shoulder with other languages if not an inch taller.

  

The next question is what benefit will accrue?

  

To my understanding the lack of different academic abilities seen in children at different levels are as a matter of fact not on account of the incapacity of the child but are reflected in the child on account of the language of instruction. If Sanskrit becomes the language of instruction these inabilities will not surface and the development of the child will go unimpeded.

  

Why could Sanskrit not become a language of instruction?

  

The problem with teaching a child Sanskrit is in the inability of the teacher to teach the child to phonate Sanskrit words correctly. This problem can be addressed through teaching the recitation of the Maheshwar Sutras together with the Barakhadi Sutras. Patanjali in his Mahabhashya has said that the Maheshwar Sutras have also been compiled so that Sanskrit speakers become capable of speaking correctly or chastly.

  

I have through the past 20 odd years taught many 4th to 5th Std students to read and write. These children could not learn to read and write mainly because of the faulty barakhadi in vogue. The moment they were taught the Maheshwar Sutras their ability to discern lingual sounds became astute and in time learnt to read and write. 

  

Thus from my point of view as well as from experience the moment we switch to Sanskrit children will not only learn to read, write and speak Sanskrit but they will also learn to read, write and speak other languages efficiently.

  

I have worked with primary children of vernacular language and have found that children speaking dialects of the formal language tend to suffer the most as their dialect does not allow them to pronounce all the letters in the respective formal languages and thus remain incapable of reading and writing. We also see that in spiteof the widespread proliferation of formal languages throughthe educationsystem the dialects still hold ground in the majority of the population thus leading to the deterioration in the standard of education at each level.

  

If Sanskrit is introduced at the primary level itself it will bring in meaningfulness into the curriculum as it will improve the standard of understanding of vernacular languages as well as of English. It will also lead to an improvement in diction of the children.

  

Finally, Sanskrit will cease to be the language of a chosen few without any religious or caste riders.

  

If Chamu Shastri's dream is to materialize there is no way out but to introduce Sanskrit into the education system at the primary level itself i.e., 1st Std.

  

I would love to initiate and experiment on such an idea but for my age and resources.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
