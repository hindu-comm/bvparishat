Has Sanskrit ever been a Mother tongue of any community in India? To know to read write or speak a language does not necessarily mean that it ought to be an individuals mother tongue.  

  

Is the 2021 census going to enumerate literacy of individuals in various languages as languages have different scripts in India?

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
