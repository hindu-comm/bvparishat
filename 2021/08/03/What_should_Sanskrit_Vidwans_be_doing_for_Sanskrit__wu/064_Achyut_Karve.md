Dear Nityanandji,

  

I hope you have seen the video on YouTube.

  

If you have seen it I would like to hear your comments on the same.

  

अदर्शनं लोपः Not seeing what, was my question. The answer I was seeking was that since an akshara is a sound it is a subject of the ear.
However as much as we can see outside we should also be in a position to see inside the mouth and so we should be in a position to see the place of articulation of each and every letter in the mouth. Similarly we should be in a position to see the place of articulation of every letter in a word while phonating it. The reason why people cannot see the place of articulation of every letter in a word is that they suffer from प्रयत्न दोष as well as because the word is not correctly formulated.

  

I saw your video. The word योग is imcomplete as the visarga has been dropped or it has been uttered without a pratyaya. Hence there arises doubt regarding whether the अ of ग has been uttered or not. It being so all the letters in the word योग get corrupted and so it becomes impossible to determine the place of articulation of each and every letter in the word and obviously therefore people rely on what they hear and so have doubts.

  

In short each and every letter in Sanskrit words (सूप् तिङन्तम् पदम्) are objects of darshan (their place of articulation can be seen).

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
