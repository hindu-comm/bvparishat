Dear Sri Achyut-ji,

  

Yes, that is the reality. It is realistic to start there. 'Not satisfied' is not the expected response when you see something you look for.

  

You said, Sanskrit learning should start at an early age.

  

I thought, when you see the video, you would say, 'yes, this is how it should be, but in larger numbers', not that you crib, 'this is showing Sanskrit as endangered language, etc., etc., '
