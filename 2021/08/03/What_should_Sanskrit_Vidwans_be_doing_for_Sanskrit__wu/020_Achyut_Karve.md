Dear friends,

  

I am a student of music. What is the difference in speech while it is spoken and written. We speak in madhya laya. However when we write the laya or tempo is reduced to 1/4th of that when we speak. If a person is not sensitive enough he starts writing with the help of memory of script forms of words.

  

In short the written word cannot be taken as a standard for deciphering how a word was uttered or spoken. No wonder that people use convention for writing words. The rules for suddha lekhan are precisely meant for that purpose.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
