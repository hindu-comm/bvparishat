Ujjwal Rajput has already given the link to the youtube video. For the rest here is a pdf of the book 'Revealing the Atlantis of Sanskrit Phonology' in English and a translation (not word to word) of the same book in Marathi titled 'संस्कृत व मराठी उच्चार शास्त्र'. I would like scholars to critically read the book. I am open to criticism.

  

The book is a product of my tryst with the Maheshwar Sutras and the Damaru and itsfallout.

  

At the cost of repetition here is the link for the youtube video.

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
