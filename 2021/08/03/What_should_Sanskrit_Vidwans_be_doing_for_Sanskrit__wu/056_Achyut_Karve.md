One might be wondering why I am presenting the subject this way..

  

For the information of all since 1995 I am working on why there is so much disparity between students whose score is high and those whose score is low. My question was why so much disparity?

  

I started working on students of 5th to 10th grade who had low to very low scores. Through the years I noticed that these children had poor lingual abilities. After working for 10 years I concluded that children who were weak in the language of instruction showed poor prognosis for making good lost ground. Therefore I needed to switch to guide children from 1st grade whereI could get time to develop theirlanguage skills.
However, teaching 6 year olds is a difficult proposition. I therefore started living with goats and cows and learnt to befriend them.
Thereafter I learnt the trick of befriending children and started working with them. What learned people (Scholars) lack is empathy and patience towards their clients (students). This I even noticed with music Guru's like Ahmedjan Thirakwa and Pandit Gajananrao Joshi. While working with grade 1 to grade 4 studentsI learned to have empathy and patience towards students. It was here that I tested the efficacy of the Maheshwar Sutras. To my great surprise the children learnt to read and write vernacular languages as well as English better and faster via the Maheshwara Sutras as compared to teaching the devanagari script letters.

  

Let all on this list know that instructing the Maheshwar Sutras to primary students is easier than the Devanagari script letters with the rider that the teacher has learnt to recite the Maheshwar Sutras correctly. Through all these 15 years of my study of the Maheshwara Sutras I have not come across a single Sanskrit literate scholar or teacher who can recite the Maheshwara Sutras correctly. For example one can listen to otheryoutubevideos on the Maheshwara Sutras. I was teased and ridiculed about my findings when I joined this forum. For the information of those on the list, I went to present the first copy of my book 'The Atlantis of Sanskrit Phonology' to Saroja Bhate in Pune. She too thought the same way. At the first go itself I noticed theapathy of Sanskrit scholars towards the Shiksha. The reason why Sanskrit Scholars can do nothing for Sanskrit is because they cannot teach beginners which is very important given the fact that Sanskrit today is not a spoken language. Sanskrit scholars fail to appreciate the aesthetic of the Sanskrit language.

  

In olden days the Guru used to teach students right from the beginning to the end i.e. from K.G to Post Graduation. There was a time when a Vedic scholar was tested for recitation by a group of 10 to 12 Pandits before he waspassed. On the other hand, today a student becomes a qualified scholar by writing an examination. The reduction of Sanskrit from a spoken language to a written one like Latin or Greek is the root cause for the malady facing Sanskrit. A mere knowledge of the Devanagari script letters is not sufficient to learn Sanskrit much less to learn to speak Sanskrit.

  

We do not make a tree bear fruit. We only provide the tree with the right niche i.e. provide it with water, fertilizer and keep it exposed to sunlight. The tree starts bearing fruit. Similar is the case with students learning Sanskrit. Here the Shiksha is the Sun. We cannot afford to neglect it or take it for granted.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
