Dear Sh. Achyut Karve Ji

  

You are making bold claims without any evidence whatsoever. I request you to please help us with at least the following

  

1\) a sound recording in your voice of the Maheshvara-Sutras so that others learn what you you have in mind when you say **correct pronunciation**

  

2\) a brief summary of errors you have noticed in pronunciation of vowels or consonants by Sanskrit literate scholars/teachers in the Mahehvara Sutras. Please be specific: which sutras are pronounced incorrectly as per you, and which syllables in those sutras.

  

Without this, I am afraid, your views are not likely to be taken seriously.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
