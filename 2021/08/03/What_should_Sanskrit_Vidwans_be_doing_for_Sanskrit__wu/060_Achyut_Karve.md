I thank Nityanandjifor his post. It made me think how I can or should address his doubts about my credentials. The following is the answer.

  

What does the sutra आदर्शनं लोपः mean? Does it mean what is not heard is dropped or does it mean what is not seen is dropped? Scholars need to answer the question: how is a word or letter seen? What is that which can be seen in an akshara? I am not answering this question because scholars will again allege that I have copied it from somewhere? If I get the answer which I seek I will be ever more thankful to the individual who provides the correct answer either as a reference or as his own.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
