नमो विद्वद्भ्यः।  

  

The **Centre for Avadhanam**, a joint initiative of **Chinmaya Vishwavidyapeeth** and **Indic Academy,** is going to conduct **Sanskrit Poetry Competitions** in three categories - **Samasyāpūrti, dattapadī** and **nyastākṣarī,** as part of the Sanskrit Month celebrations of Chinmaya Vishwavidyapeeth. The idea is to identify and encourage talented poets in Sanskrit language as art flourishes only through artists. Hence there is **no age bar**, and **registration is free**.  

  

-   **Last date for Registration –14 August 2021** -   The challenges in each category will be sent to the registered
    participants by email on 16 August 2021 -   Last date for submitting entries - 26 August 2021
