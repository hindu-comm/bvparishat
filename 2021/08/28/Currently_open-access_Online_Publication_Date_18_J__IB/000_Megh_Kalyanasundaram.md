Abstract: "One of the most widespread and natural ways of conceiving of the human mind in European culture is the image of the mind as a container for thoughts, images, memories, reasonings, etc. In this article, we explore the evidence of this metaphor in the Ancient Greek epic poems, Homer’s*Iliad*and*Odyssey*as well as Hesiod’s*Theogony*and*Works and Days*, and, for comparative purposes, the evidence of the analogous metaphor in the Ancient Indian epics, the*Mahābhārata*and the*Rāmāyaṇa*. We examine how the metaphor is used, what its functions are and what it implies for the conception of mind in both ancient traditions. Additionally, we offer a brief comparison with the image of the mind-container that emerges from the use of this metaphor in modern English."
