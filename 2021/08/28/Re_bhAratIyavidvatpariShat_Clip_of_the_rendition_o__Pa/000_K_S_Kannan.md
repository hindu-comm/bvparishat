The verse composed by the revered Swamiji

would be open to *siddha-sādhana-doṣa*  

(=accomplishing what is already accomplished,

or proving what is already clear/reputed)

if it is considered a message to Indians (=Hindus, to wit).

Hindus have never waged wars over others  

(on grounds of faith etc.)  

  

It is an apt message to the West,

or more aptly, to the Abrahamic faiths:

to shed their feline and vulpine mentality.

It is enough if they rise to human levels.

  

An apt message at UNO - to the West essentially.

It is not there is/was no evil here.

But killing millions and such large-scale cultural genocide

with such megalomania was never a part of Hindu history.  

  

And just see in contrast today's dispatch:
