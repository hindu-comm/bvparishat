Why is the deletion of word-final (sometimes within word too) hrasva ‘a’ in Hindi and most other north Indian languages called “schwa deletion”?
In my understanding, a schwa is a vowel shorter than the regular hrasva ‘a’. In Malayalam and Tamil there is word final schwa. It is actually the result of shortening of the regular hrasva ‘u’. In Malayalam it is called saṃvṛta ukāram.  In Tamil it is called kuṯṯiyal ukaram. An example is the word nāḍŭ (written nāṭŭ, നാടു്) meaning country. The last ŭ is the saṃvṛta ukāram. In the Kodagu language also it is there. They have also the within-word schwa. Malayalam also has the within-word schwa but it is not shown in writing. It is the result of shortening of a hrasva ‘u’ or a hrasva ‘i’.

  

It would be interesting to know when the deletion of hrasva ‘a’ (and also hrasva ‘i’ and hrasva ‘u’) occurred in Indo Aryan. I think the word-final hrasva ‘a’ was very much there in the different Prakrits.
Perhaps it was there in the Apabhramśa-s too. The deletion might have happened in the process of the Apabhramśa-s evolving into modern north Indian languages.
