I do not know who the conspiracy theorists are. I certainly am not one.

  

I have no complaints against [archive.org](http://archive.org), or the many uploaders to the same.

I am not denying the rights of the uploaders to withdraw what they have uploaded.

Uploaders like Ajit-ji are indeed doing a great service, which has also not been denied.

  

I do not know how many more categorical denials need to be made by me/others.  

  

Take the case of a 100-year old book, where there are apparently no copyright-infringements.

Even such books vanish all of a sudden. And that can cause a problem or a panic to many:

one is not sure which book will survive till when.

  

I guess it is like the publication of books. There are both governmental and private publishers.

Sometimes there is a collaboration (and sometimes even competition) between them.

It would be best in the interests of the common man that they work variously in tandem.

It is easy to blame the government, but that should not always be branded as springing  

necessarily from a censorious attitude. Where problems are, people tend to express or share it  

on some platform or the other.  

  

The ideal solution lies perhaps in a sort of a healthy competition between

the governmental and private institutions carrying out the same tasks;

and as in many sectors, the government should come forward to recognise

the services of those who digitise, honour them, and more importantly,

encourage them and even generously/reasonably fund them regularly etc.  

Those who are providing good service here, as anywhere else,  

should not be forced to fend for themselves.

  

This can then be considered as important a service as the hospital/transport sector.

There can be private bodies alongside the governmental ones. The analogy of

patronage to classical music, or even libraries may also be reasonable. The government  

must take it up as one of its duties, but then, there should, alongside, be patronage  

from private individuals/bodies.  

  

There is nothing wrong if the government spends a small percentage at least of its funds  

for this service. A good many governmental jobs get done shoddily, inevitably perhaps.  

But if the government takes the help/assistance/guidance of knowledgeable and passionate  

book digitisers - such as Ajit-ji perhaps - more viable/reasonable/sensible solutions can be found.

  

While a perfect solution may never be attained (as in any other field/sector),

more and more reasonable solutions can/should be aimed at.  

  

The day the government(s) consider digitisation of books as indeed a great service to humanity,

and encourage those that maintain good standards (by way also of developing a healthy competition  

among them perhaps), and also deem the utilisation of temple funds for such acts as  

the modern equivalent of employing āsthāna-vidvāns - will be a great day for our heritage.

  

I cannot do better than recall Abhinavagupta who said that preservation/renovation of the great  

accomplishments of the past is to be deemed equivalent to doing them originally itself! :

***pūrva-pratiṣṭhapita-yojanāsu***

***mūla-pratiṣṭhā-phalam āmananti\|***
