I am not sure why there are some conspiracytheories about [archive.org](http://archive.org) on this mailing list every once in a while. I am not connected with [archive.org](http://archive.org), but the bottomline is it's a free service and depends on volunteers to upload or delete their uploads. This is not a centralized mechanism and therein lies the power. So if someone uploads and later deletes that's not [archive.org](http://archive.org)'s problem or their decision,it's not a bug to complain about,it's a feature which makes [archive.org](http://archive.org) useful and nimble,you can't make it cheap and nimble and also demand a huge paper trail. They are conflicting requirements. It's not in theirbudget to keep track of these details,they would probably have to employ a large number of people fordoing things like that. In flagrant copyright violations, they may take action, especially upon complaints.

You can actually find an article about [archive.org](http://archive.org) within [archive.org](http://archive.org) itself, addressing some of these points.

Bottomline is that you can't look a gift horse in the mouth. Archive.org also provides a service where you can borrow some books for sometime, These are for books for which copyrights still exist.
