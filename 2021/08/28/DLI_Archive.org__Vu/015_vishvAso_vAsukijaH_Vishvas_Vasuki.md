Regarding places to upload, Sci Hub (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub> ) and Library Genesis (currently at <https://libgen.is/> , but might shift periodically) are an attractive location. They definitely reject notions of copyright - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_Genesis> . It's founder[Alexandra Elbakyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_Elbakyan "Alexandra Elbakyan")is one of the most admired people in science - I am glad she is faring better than the tragic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz> .

  

I hope that uploaders additionally upload their scans to these services.
