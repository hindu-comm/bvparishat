I've honestly never heard of such people. Everyone I've encountered knows exactly what Libgen is.

This is false information (but I'm open to corrections given that laws may have changed or caught up). With torrents, the problem is not that you download items made available despite "copyright restrictions" - the problem is that **you share** whatever portions you've already downloaded to others in violation of"copyright restrictions". With libgen, you can directly download an item from their site without sharing from your computer as in the case of torrents. Hence, there is no violation of laws.

I've read high res scans of books from libgen.
