Gargeswari-ji is right.  

  

Archive.org asks for donations, it does not demand sums,  

or allows conditional downloading.

The only tragedy, perhaps irreparable, is that it removes books

on no transparent grounds; and they may have their reasons, valid or invalid.

  

What I would stress is that we have our own alternative,

possibly with governmental patronage/subsidy/whatever.

  

Rather than siphon off TTD funds which come as donations from devotees for secular purposes,

it must *all* be utilised for the legitimate goals : securing temples, improving facilities,

printing of heritage literature, supporting traditional arts, patronising and

improving the quality/standards of DLI/any similar indigenous body etc.

  

The sweepers of "heritage temples" draw more salary than most of the archaka-s.

When do we put an end to such ironies and tragedies?
