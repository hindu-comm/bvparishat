Bogus complaints and threats are indeed a source of problem. I've heard that has happened due to sheer envy and ill will (eg. uploader A does not like uploader B etc..).

  

There exist people and institutions, for analogy, who type and publish exactly whatever they see in a 100 year old book, and then claim copyright on them/ harass those who copy online for their own purposes. Though their legal claims are invalid, countering them is a big hassle and time-sink - leading to folks just giving up. In this sense,<https://sarit.indology.info/> is a golden example. Besides technologicallysimple distribution, all their files are available under the <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/> license.
