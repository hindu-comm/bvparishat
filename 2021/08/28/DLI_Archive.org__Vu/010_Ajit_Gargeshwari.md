I have tried to answer this question earlier. If the lawful copyrightholder says its infringementthe work is removed, An uploader can remove any work they upload. It is the will of the uploader to decide An uploader can decide how long what he has digitised can be made available for free and on which site.No condition is imposed on the uploaderby archives except an acceptance that the uploaderhas the right to upload.

"Siphon off TTD funds"the question needs to be addressed by making a petion. This question is best addressed by TTD and their representatives

Please ask if copyright isa boon or tragedy. are the publishers or authors greedy or fair. The archakas ill-treated and exploited the sweepers for centuries perhaps on a different thread.
