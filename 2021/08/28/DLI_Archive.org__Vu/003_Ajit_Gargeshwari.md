Let me further add I have met several scholars who say the need PDF of books if I give it to them they simply say thank you your very kind you're doing a great job but when comes voluntarily paying they want to give one thousand rupees or two thousand for one 5 years. for 5,000 books printed prior to 19040 that I have. Hence most of them them those who scan including me upload them to [archives.org](http://archives.org) as they don't charge the uploader for uploading and down loading is free. Simply typing hyper accurate spellings don't make a Sanskrit pdfs accessible. One has to intuitively learn to search as well.
