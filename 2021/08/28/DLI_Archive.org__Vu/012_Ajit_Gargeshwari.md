Let me say this for those who raise conspiracy theories against [archives.org](http://archives.org) They neither use [archives.org](http://archives.org) nor have they even digitized ten books that they wish to share. sharing and digital preservation is not their interest. relentless criticism is their cup of tea. They are ill-informed about what it takes to make available extraordinary rare books available to all interested readers, at their convenience right on their computer anytime any where without having to visit one dozen library and even if they visit libraries all over India they will not be able to read as the books will be in fragile or torn condition They do not care about making resources available to differently abled people mean. The conspirators theorists believe that either rare and important books pertaining to Sanskrit should get disintegrated in libraries or in their own personal collection but should not be preserved digitally. They don't believe in knowledge preservation through digitization. They say the Government should do that work, spend thousands of crores on infrastructure for perpetual preservation and easy accessibility and then they will read, not just read will criticize the government pointing drawbacks and hatch further conspiracy theories. The
conspiracy theorists kept endlessly criticizing DLI. When DLI said they are closing down the conspiracy theorists made no efforts to retain their data in a accessible form within India but allowed that data to be hosted elsewhere. When DLI data was hosted elsewhere they again saw a conspiracy. Such is the way and will of the conspiracy theorists. Since this list is open to all who wants to make claims for which they need not demonstrate any reasonable justification or evidence they feel they have the right to write and all should either read silently or accept their views else they will make so much noise that threads will have to be closed by the list moderator.
