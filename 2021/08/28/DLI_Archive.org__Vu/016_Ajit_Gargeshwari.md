This mail is for the benefitof membersand not a reply to the members post.<https://libgen.is/> and zlibrary or its various avatars are illegal.

Please read:[Is Libgen Safe? – Book Cave (mybookcave.com)](https://mybookcave.com/is-libgen-safe/)

Some people mistakenly believe that Libgen isn’t like other torrenting sites and that they acquired their material legally since they have the option to download directly. This, however, is not true. Libgen did not acquire their books legally. This is evident in the many lawsuits they have faced. Therefore, downloading books from Libgen is no safer than downloading from other illegal book sharing sites and torrents. More importantly, it is not legal to download books from Libgen.

  

  

Even if one can prove the site is legal in a court of law they will not allow high resolution scans. They mask their true IP address and so on
