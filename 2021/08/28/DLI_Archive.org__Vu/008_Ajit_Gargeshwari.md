I am sorry [archives.org](http://archives.org) never asks a user to pay money for downloading any material that one can download. I am writing
this with a disclaimer that I am not a representative of [archive.org](http://archive.org) neither am I in anyway associated with them or their affiliates except that I like anyone use their free services. Archives.org just as any non profit organization is dependent on donations to sustain and maintain their needs one needs to know a difference between fund raising and operating as a commercial
business entity. Prof. Kanna has not said that [archive.org](http://archive.org) is a commercial entity.

Regards

Ajit Gargeshwari
