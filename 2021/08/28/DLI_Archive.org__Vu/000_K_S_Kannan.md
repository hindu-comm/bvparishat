A good many Sanskrit works are being rather arbitrarily removed from Archives.org stating a vague reason that an item can be removed  

for various reasons. It looks almost whimsical, and many good/important/key books disappear in a matter of hours: I had earmarked it for download last night, and this morning it has just vanished!  

  

The irregularities and misspellings etc of DLI figure there as well,

even though many items listed in DLI are missing there. When the whole lot of DLI books have been donated/borrowed wholesale to Archive.org, why does this happen? How is all this to be figured out/manipulated/restored/regularised/made transparent?  

  

Should not India have its own counterpart of Archives.org  

which can be fully under its own control ?  

Or, are there already such source/s that I may not know?

If none exists, should not India, or some key organisation here, start one?
