Dear Prof Kannan,

  

I had promised not write for another 10 years on BVP list but decided to write after seeing your mail

  

All Books scanned by DLI the back ups are available elsewhere the complete 30 plus TB of Data. An uploader of an item can remove their own upload. I have removed what I have uploaded a few times.

  

If you can get the will of the government and remove copywrite act for publication or make all publications published without copywrite them a permanent repository can be created. A copywrite for any work exits 60 years to the death of the author and then passes on to the copywrite holders legal heirs if they decide to renew the copywrite.

  

A good many works are considered orphaned works or whose copywrite is doubtful. Say such a work is uploaded. Then the copyright holder asks [archives.org](http://archives.org) or me if I am hosting the work on my website to get the worked removed in a casual way to avoid legal consequences' one just apologies and remove the concerned material.

  

It cost several crores hundreds' of crores rupees to host high quality scans. even to create something close to [archives.org](http://archives.org) to host 1 petabyte of data on a perpetual basis would cost nothing less that 300 crore a year. Over the past 8 to 9 years i have requested for individuals or organisation to donate toward digital preservation but hardly anyone is interested in such a proposal. A few kind individuals do patronize but not a scale required

  

Please note all DLI scanned then were not out of copywrite works hence DLI website closed down

I have made a complete clean up of Sanskrit related out of copywrite books scanned by DLI and have rescanned most of them which DLI had scanned i lower resolution in higher resolution As I have id do share them with any one who needs and who can support my digitizing goals

  

You often write about easily accessible and searchable bibliography of all published books and articles published pertaining to all aspects of India studies published in all languages. Millions of books and articles have been published since the time books were printed India. I can get such work done if there sponsorship to expected scales. A sum of Rs .25,000 one time or one cannot get an operator who enters error free dat at Rs 7,000 a month who know about book cataloging and who is familiar with different scripts

  

Regards

Ajit Gargeshwari
