Namaste



1. Ajit : I fully agree with your observation, concern and contention : \< Simply typing hyper accurate spellings don't make a Sanskrit pdfs accessible. One has to intuitively learn to search as well. \> .



2. Prof. KSK : I appreciate your concern on available digital archives and proposal for action. We are willing to extend our cooperation.



 \< Should not India have its own counterpart of Archives.org which can be fully under its own control ?

Or, are there already such source/s that I may not know? If none exists, should not India, or some key organisation here, start one? \> :



Your expectation should match a call for action on the scale of work- vision – teaming- investment and final beneficiaries aligned to Nations vision for ‘ Panini Language (Sanskrit): for Digital Citizens of 2030 onwards. The details on early starters of digital achieve initiatives can be viewed at : [HathiTrust - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HathiTrust); [Million Book Project - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million_Book_Project) .



HathiTrust was founded in October 2008 by the twelve universities of the[Committee on Institutional Cooperation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_on_Institutional_Cooperation "Committee on Institutional Cooperation")and the eleven libraries of the[University of California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California "University of California").[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HathiTrust#cite_note-5)The partnership includes over 60 research libraries[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HathiTrust#cite_note-6)across the United States, Canada, and Europe, and is based on a[shared governance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_governance "Shared governance")structure. Costs are shared by the participating libraries and library consortia.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HathiTrust#cite_note-7)The repository is administered by the[University of Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan "University of Michigan").[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HathiTrust#cite_note-8)The Executive Director of HathiTrust is Mike Furlough.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HathiTrust#cite_note-9)The HathiTrust Shared Print Program is a distributed[collective collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_collections "Collective collections")whose participating libraries have committed to retaining almost 18 million monograph volumes for 25 years, representing three-quarters of HathiTrust digital book holdings.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HathiTrust#cite_note-10)



 There are some notable Indian Indology organizations which have addressed this issue, for benefit of in-house scholars , with private and public funds. 



 In terms of scale and contribution, DLI has been a good effort. The work to be done / work done’ by ‘teams beyond India in the past four to five decades with clear interest in accessing knowledge documented in language: Sanskrit ( - should I qualify it as bharateeya / Hindu or just another ancient language in terms of recent posts on the forum ??) is of Himalayan scale and rocket speed. The ‘capture –seizure ’ is first phase before deliberation on ‘Quality- Quantity- Accessibility- Usability – Costs- priority – Continuity Of digitalization of manuscripts’ .



**The DLI is a ‘gifted horse’**. So, in using it, the best thing is to take the wisdom of adage: ‘ DON’T LOOK A GIFT HORSE IN THE MOUTH, using the logic horse’s age and utility can be determined by inspecting its teeth. Basically, the longer the teeth, the older the horse. A gift horse could be so old that the person gifting it don’t even want it.



** A gift horse, by definition** is an apparent gift, that has substantial associated costs or drawbacks, especially a gift that does not fit perfectly with the recipient’s wants or needs. The phrase appears in print in English in 1546, as “don’t look a given horse in the mouth”, in John Heywood’s A Dialogue 'No man ought to look a given horse in the mouth.' Does it remind us of the wisdom from Katha Upanishad, **substituting 'cow to horse' ?** :

ॐ उशन् ह वै वाजश्रवसः सर्ववेदसं ददौ । तस्य ह नचिकेता नाम पुत्र आस ॥ १॥

तँ ह कुमारँ सन्तं दक्षिणासु नीयमानासु श्रद्धाविवेश सोऽमन्यत ॥ २॥

पीतोदका जग्धतृणा दुग्धदोहा निरिन्द्रियाः । अनन्दा नाम ते लोकास्तान् स गच्छति ता ददत् ॥ ३॥

स होवाच पितरं तत कस्मै मां दास्यसीति । द्वितीयं तृतीयं तँ होवाच मृत्यवे त्वा ददामीति ॥ ४॥



So, what would you project as priority and pitch for a National funding project? – Use what is available ? Clean up what is messed up ? New initiatives ? Invest in right technology ? Invest in scholars grooming for next hundred years ?? Maintain ‘ manuscript museums’?
What would it be which was not covered in the scope of National Manuscript mission , IGNCA and many such initiatives and deliberated in conferences - [MILLION BOOK UNIVERSAL DIGITAL LIBRARY PROJECTS: INDIA - E-LIS repository (rclis.org)](http://eprints.rclis.org/22792/) ; <http://eprints.rclis.org/22792/7/Million%20Book%20Universal%20Digital%20Library%20Projects%20India.pdf> ; ?
