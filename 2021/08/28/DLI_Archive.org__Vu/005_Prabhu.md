Sri Ajit Gargeshwari ji,

  

Amazing work by you.

I do appreciate your sharing with me, last year(?), upon my request, a document from the repository you curate. Thank you!

  

Your work speaks for itself.

Still, among a few on this august forum, who if they did take a mauna-varta it would help,... you are not one.

  

Regards

Prabhu
