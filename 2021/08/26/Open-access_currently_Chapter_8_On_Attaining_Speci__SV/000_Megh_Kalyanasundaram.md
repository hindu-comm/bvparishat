"In his pioneering book,*Asceticism and Healing in Ancient India*, Kenneth Zysk argued that the early medical works display “empirico-rational” and “magico-religious” elements that reflect the different cultural milieus in which medicine was developed. According to Zysk, the empirical and rational theories of medicine (especially humoral theory) originated in ascetic milieus, while the magico-religious elements were part of a “brahmanic veneer” applied while adapting medical theory and practice to brahmanic culture. The division between “empirico-rational” (as indicative of modern ideas of science) and “magico-religious” was critiqued by Engler on the grounds that “Ayurveda did not manifest standard criteria of “science” (e.g., materialism, empirical observation, experimentation, falsification, quantification, or a developed conception of proof) and that Vedic aspects of the classical texts are too central to be considered inauthentic or marginal.”[78](https://brill.com/view/book/edcoll/9789004438224/BP000010.xml#FN000325)More recently, Slouber (2016) has shown how certain religious and magical elements found in the texts follow a systematic logic and should therefore not be categorized as irrational. Nevertheless, the difference in approaches in the medical texts is fairly clear and indeed is explicitly referenced in the source texts themselves. For example, the*Carakasaṃhitā*divides therapy into three categories: 1. that which depends on the sacred (*daivavyapāśraya*); 2. that which depends on reasoning (*yuktivyapāśraya*); and 3. that which triumphs through good character (*sattvāvajaya*). The first category includes “the use of mantras, herbs, jewels, good-luck ceremonies, food offerings to the gods, presents to the gods, fire oblations, pledges, penances, fasts, benedictions, prostrations, and pilgrimage.”[79](https://brill.com/view/book/edcoll/9789004438224/BP000010.xml#FN000326)The second employs diet and medicines. For the third, the mind is turned away from detrimental thought.[80](https://brill.com/view/book/edcoll/9789004438224/BP000010.xml#FN000327)*Rasāyana*encompasses all three approaches."
