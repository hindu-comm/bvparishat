Dear Scholars,

  

I am delighted to inform you that Indica USA will be hosting a Sanskrit poetry reading panel on Saturday, August 28 at 10.30 AM CT/9 PM IST. I am the organizer of this event that promises to be one of its kind in celebrating Sanskrit poetry by poets across the globe. The theme has been aptly chosen asजगत्सर्वं सुसंस्कृतम्.

  

Dr. Nagaraj Paturi has kindly consented to deliver the opening remarks. Prof. Madhav Deshpande will chair the session. We will have special guests from two organizations working across the world: Samskrita Bharati represented by Dr. Prem Rallabandi and Samskara Foundation led by Mr. Sarvesh Tiwari. Poets from eminent academic institutions will also join the conference.

  

Please see the poster attached for full information regarding this conference. I request scholars from BVP to attend the conference and make it a success. Please register for the event at the link below to get the zoom link in your email:
