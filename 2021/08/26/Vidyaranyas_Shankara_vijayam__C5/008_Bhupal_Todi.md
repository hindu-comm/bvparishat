Aware of the Original book link in [archive.org](http://archive.org). Since an English translation was required, sent the link corresponding to English commentary. There seems to be a **hard copy** of the book.  

  

  

\[[1](https://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp/sankara-vijayam.html#1)\] Two commentaries have been written to the *mAdhavIya*, one titled *DiNDimA*, by dhanapati sUrI (composed in 1798 CE), and another titled *advaitarAjyalakshmI* by acyutarAya (composed in 1824 CE). There are a ***couple of good English translations*** of the *mAdhavIya*, one by swAmI tapasyAnanda of the Ramakrishna Math, \[[2](https://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp/sankara-vijayam.html#2)\] and another by K. Padmanabhan.
