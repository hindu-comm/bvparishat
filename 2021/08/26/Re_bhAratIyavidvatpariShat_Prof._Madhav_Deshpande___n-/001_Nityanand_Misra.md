Dear Prof. Paturi

  

It is strange. You declared, rather arbitrarily, at 4:56 pm: “Let us close the thread.” Some members, including me, continued to post. However, you yourself posted a response to Ajit Ji at 10:13 pm on the same thread that you had declared as closed in the afternoon. Then Ajit Ji responded. Then you complained at 10:32 pm that members are violating rules. My question is, was that post at 10:13 pm IST by you not a violation of your own announcement? You could have locked the thread at 10:13 pm rather than continue the discussion.

  

I have two questions. Please feel free not to answer.

  

1\) I agree that posting on a thread you announced as closed is a violation, but is that a grave violation? Compared to throwing slang/offensive ethnic terms like *northie/southie*and making personal attacks, posting on a thread that has been announced as closed is hardly anything.  

  

2\) Why was the thread closed \[and why is it locked now\]? Is it because everything that had to be said has been said? Is it because it was getting heated or offensive? Or was it because the questions being asked were too uncomfortable for the moderator and owners of the list?

  

PS: If my posting this message is considered a violation, then I am guilty as charged. You may take any action that you like.
