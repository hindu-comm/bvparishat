Dear Paturiji,

  

Most of my questions are yes or no questions. For eg. the question 'Does Panini allow nasalization of vowels? The answer would be either yes or no. If yes I would like to know the sutra.

  

Why are these questions relevant to me? The reason is that in the Paniniya Shiksha the 18 अ, इ, and उ's have been derived by nasalization of vowels. How far is this derivation Paninian is what I want to know.


  

Further from my own study of the Maheshwar Sutras I find that nasalization takes place on account of either incorrect effort or weak effort. While phonating non-anunasikas it is necessary that the passage of the air through the nose is blocked while articulating such letters. Based on my study of the Maheshwar Sutras I am trying to find out the inconsistencies (w.r.t. Panini) that have crept in the tradition.

  

I have no intention of irritating scholars.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
