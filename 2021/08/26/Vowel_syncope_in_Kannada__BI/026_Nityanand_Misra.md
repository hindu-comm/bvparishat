I may be wrong here, but I think Vishvas Vasuki's mother tongue is Tamil. I read somewhere that he speaks the Iyengar Tamil/Hebbar Tamil dialect of Tamil. He can best confirm this and I am happy to correct myself.

To clarify, Prof. Paturi, I am not *trying to rely* on professional published material, rather *I am relying* on published material. And the reliance is not blind, the published material confirms my own observations based on my exposure to spoken/colloquial Kannada. Yes, I would not have had the confidence without the published material.
