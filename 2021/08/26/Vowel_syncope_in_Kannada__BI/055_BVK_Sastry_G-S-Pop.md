Namaste



On \<* अ अ to be interpreted as vivruta अ becomes samvruta self defeating* \> : 



1. Can we explore this statement in a short-focus , setting the boundary condition – logic :

\< **IF** vivruta is the opposite direction of samvruta (as involution in pronunciation), **AND **vivruta ‘*अ*’ has known clear 18 varieties,

**THEN** what will be the voiced / unvoiced samvrutha *अ* images of the clear listed 18- ‘*अ* - clusters?:



Note: There cannot be a physiological ‘anunasika’ option in ‘samvrutha’ pronunciation !



2. If \< saṃvṛta ukāram in Malayalam and kuṯṯiyal (written kuṟṟiyal) ukaram in Tamil. … .. In Tamil, the kuṯṯiyal ukaram is not shown in modern writing... ..understand that Kodagu (the language of Kodagu area, or Coorg) has these two kinds of schwas, the word final saṃvṛta ukāram and the schwa within words.> :

Here is a fit case demanding explanation for review of CURRENT
MODEL OF TEACHING ‘Svara- Vyanjana- cluster of SAMSKRUTHAM ( leaving out Maheswara Sutra/ and starting with local/ regional/ anglicised Varna-akshara – proximate words’.



‘Panini-Maheswara Sutras provided ‘bhashaa –shikshaa ’ as primary standard for All Brahmi language families: Daivee and Manushee .

This is the basis of expanded ‘varna-akshara-maalaa’ sets by ‘Voice’ as taught in usage across languages of Brahmi origin at Bharath ( and largesse of South East Asia) and critical part of foundational learning. Without this line of argument, it would be difficult to explain why many south Asian languages teach one *अ* with variant scripts and articulation for semantics as specific language feature. In the context of India, one Phonemic sound has found its expression in several visual formats and by context, the articulation is firmed up. Check Newari for this by voice and scripts. Script is not a limiting consideration; certainly not the IPA convention or transliteration or current scripting models.



***Logic:*** The languages of the same land , where speakers use the ‘SAME set and logic of varna-Akshara pronunciation (Shikshaa Codecs) ’
need to be taken as belonging to same ‘proto-stock’, which in this case is primarily ‘Maanushee - Bhashaa’ part of Brahmi- Paninian Language /– Samskrutham. This anchor is ‘ Voice-Character –set = Varna-akshara- maalaa’. Historicty goes back to Pre-Panini, through a few millennia of time line and dot-points connecting ‘ Mahaveera- Gautama Buddha , all the way up to Vyasa- Valmiki ( if Veda is not a preferred reference for some academicians ! )



The movement of language speaking community does not change the ‘ primary Varna-akshara- maalaa’ and ‘grammar’ of language. Vocabulary addition and osmosis from other languages as loan words, new words, corruptions in usage still stand by basic feature of language.



The osmosis of sounds from ‘Daivee – Chandas ’ part of Brahmi- Paninian Language /– Samskrutham (where codecs come from Praitshakhyas , mainly) is a social phenomenon. That mix up does not impact the language stanards.



***Question***: What was the need –constraint- advantage for ‘Tamil, Malayalam …. Kodava…’ languages to adapt and live with a mixed bag of
phonemes related to \< *अ -as vivruta and samvruta \> ? *Why these variations need to be explained as ‘defects / deviations’ taking out the Panini-and Prakrut grammar provisions which explains it natively ? Why
these variations are language wise significant as ‘ tonal’ variations impacting semantics ? Why was a script symbol left out in tradition, when the ‘Brahmi-Chandas –teams devised elaborate symbols for sama-veda and music tonals?



**Last but not the least,** What would be current anchor to assert ‘ Proper pronunciation of Maheswarasutras’ in Bhashaa and Chandas variety, without ‘ Prakritization, regionalization and Anglicization ?



This is where Panini \< अ अ\> sutra leads to Aha! Oho! Ah ! -
Expressions in relation to studies of ‘ Maheswara Sutra’.
