Dear Sri Achyut-ji,

  

\> What is wrong if I question?

  

You mean to say , what is wrong if I try to know/learn ?

  

I am not arguing with you. There is no arguable position that you took nor am I into any conversation with you about the topics ? that you brought into the conversation between two other members.

  

Your spellings like आगम् themselves show that you need to be obedient while trying to talk scholars who studiedPatanjali for life.

  

Just in a lighter vein,

  

Let me try to fake a Tabla question,

  

Why should there be only Dhin , Naa, Na, Tin be played at Chat ?

  

Perplexing ?

  

Please try to empathise with Vyakarana scholars regarding what happens to them from your use of technical terms.
