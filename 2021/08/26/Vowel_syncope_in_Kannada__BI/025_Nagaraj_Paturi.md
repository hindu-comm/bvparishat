Interesting thing about study of languages and cultures is that native speaker might not have paid attention to some of the features of his language / culture. When observed and pointed out by an analyst, native or outsider, he may get surprised that he did not notice that earlier in his own language/culture which is in fact a part of him. I think it was Robert A Hall, a descriptive linguist who compared native speaker's observation of his language to one's observation of one's breath. It does not usually happen unless intentionally and attentively done.

  

In Kannada, dropping of the vowel in the middle of a word does happen.

  

When we say dropping, we are keeping an original 'norm' in mind. Only if there is a vowel as original, we can talk of a dropping.

  

malugu=to sleep in Kannada has a form malgu too.Which is 'right', which is 'wrong' here ? Neither. But Which is 'original' ? malugu. Only because malugu is original, there is dropping being inferred in malgu.

  

This is a synchronic study.

  

A diachronic/historical analyst might say that 'u' in the middle itself was not there in the 'original' proto-Dravidian, (of course, reconstructed) root.

  

But the diachronic analyst can not decide the 'right' or 'wrong' on this basis. His/her reconstructed form has only an analytical value.

  

Same is the situation with regard to the difference between the classical and colloquial versions of a language.

  

aṭula = that way, is found in classical Telugu.

  

aṭla, aṭlā, gaṭla etc. are found in colloquial dialects.

  

For a colloquial speaker, aṭula is 'wrong' asādhu .

  

For a classical Telugu writer, aṭla, aṭlā, gaṭla are 'wrong'. He /she calls them grāmya, lakṣaṇaviruddha and asādhu.

  

Languages like Telugu and Kannada, in their actual usage predominantly have ajanta words. As such, syllabic cut for these languages is done as
vowel ending. All syllables in a word are cut as ending in vowels.

  

In Kannada, even in malgu , the syllabic cut is done as ma-lgu. In Telugu, even in aṭla, aṭlā, gaṭla syllabic cut is done as a-ṭla, a-ṭlā, ga-ṭla.  

  

As such, vowel 'dropped' forms are considered to be 'wrong' compared to the vowel containing forms. But such vowel 'dropping' is found across the dialects synchronically and diachronically, not as a general rule applying to all the words of the language, but as 'exceptions' applicable to some specific cases.

  

That is probably the reason why for a native speaker of these languages , 'vowel dropping' in their languages comes as news.
