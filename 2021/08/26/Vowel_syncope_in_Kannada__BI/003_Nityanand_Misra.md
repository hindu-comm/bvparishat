Dear Vishvas

You may think it is not offensive, but many others do not. Here is one example from an online dictionary: <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/southie>

**southie**(*plural***[southies](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/southies#English)**)

I do not know if it is offensive or not, but it is a slang word nevertheless.

It was for a long time a neutral term. The great Hindi poet Suryakant Tripathi Nirala used it in a book in 1930s to refer to a Tamil visitor at the Prayaga Kumbha Mela.Many Hindi books used the word with no pejorative or negative undertone till second half of twentieth century. Over time, it acquired negative overtones andis is today seen as an offensive slur.

  

A minor diversion: Bollywood movies have caricatured many communities: South Indians, Sindhis, Parsis, Gujaratis, Sikhs, and even pure Hindi speakers. The irony is that sometimes South Indians themselves have been involved in movies caricaturing South Indians, for example Chennai Express which was directed by Rohit Shetty (of Tulu descent) and written by K. Subash (a Tamilian). I may also point that beyond caricature is villainization, for example the character of the village Bania named Sukhilala in Mehboob Khan’s Mother India (1957). So, Hindi-speaking Hindu upper castes have not been spared either. Anyway, I would like to read reliable academic sources to see the history of the word and to know from when and due to what reasons the term

As an ethnic North Indian, I see it as offensive. And that is it. Rest assured, I have no intention of getting any admin to act against you. And if you think Ajit, Shrinivas, and Kushagra all mirror my *desperation*, then we are just thinking conspiracies.

I would say that it is a misinterpretation of my position again. Please quote my exact words which made you conclude this. I did not say or imply this is typical usage. My words are**कहीं-कहीं** दक्षिण भारत में भी ये schwa-syncope दिखता है, और नामों में तो विशेषतः दिखता है ... जो नामों में दिखता है यह संभव है उत्तर भारत की भाषीय प्रकृति का प्रभाव है.**कहीं-कहीं = at some places, sometimes**, not typical.Also, I specifically said दक्षिण भारत, not Kannada or Dravidian languages (which is different from South Indian languages: I do not need to tell you that Konkani spoken in Mangalore and Dhivehi spoken in Lakshadweep are South Indian languages). In addition, I have limited myself specifically to names in the discussion. Having researched names all over India for three years now, I can tell you with fair conviction (and can back it with statistics also) that terminal schwa deletion while spelling Sanskrit names in Karnataka (whether in Kannada or English) is no longer a fashionable trend but a norm. Furthermore I have clearly mentioned it as a Sanskrit name.

  

You are right, I have not heard the song you cited, but songs are very different from spoken/colloquial language. In many musical contexts, schwa deletion does not take place even in Hindi. The rendition of Hanuman-Chalisa by Hari Om Sharan is case in point. However, I would say that I have seen the attached poster from 1954 (more than 65 years ago) of the Kannada movie ಬೇಡರ ಕಣ್ಣಪ್ಪ. Note how in this poster,the “new find” name is written in Kannada as ರಾಜಕುಮಾರ್ (not ರಾಜಕುಮಾರ which would be expected). Later, his name would be mostly written as ರಾಜ್‌ಕುಮಾರ್. I mostly saw ಡಾ. ರಾಜ್‌ಕುಮಾರ್ or ಡಾ. ರಾಜ್‌ on his busts and in Kannada newspapers in Bengaluru during 2004 to 2009 and rarely or never ರಾಜಕುಮಾರ. Even the Wikipedia article on the thespian uses ರಾಜ್‌ಕುಮಾರ್. Are we to say that ರಾಜ್‌ಕುಮಾರ್was a “fashionablyHindified modern name” way back in 1954?

  

You are right, I have not read Kannada books, but I have referenced Kannada books (e.g. N Ranganatha Sharma's translation of VR). I have read Kannada newspapers, watched several Kannada movies (Mungaru Male was the first), watched Kannada news, and heard a lot of colloquial Kannada. So my exposure has mostly been to spoken/colloquial Kannada (SK) and not literary Kannada (LK). I did notice vowel/schwa deletion in some examples in spoken Kannada:often I heard *hesrenu* (and not*hesarenu*). I had not read the theory behind it. But now I have read some. The eleven references I shared state the patterns clearly.

I think the onus is on you to corroborate your claim. Shatavadhani Galu has already said he did not make such statements.

What is wrong in asking for a corroboration for something which sounds incredible? For all you know, I may use the corroboration to write about this incredible *sadhana*of S L Bhyrappa in an article or a chapter in a book. If you do not have a corroboration, it is great. If you do not, no problem.

I am not interested in a corroboration for this now. I may have been then.

  

Enough of digression. Now a question for you on the subject of the thread. If you have gone through the eleven references I shared, what is your position on vowel deletion in spoken/colloquial Kannada? Do you concur with the observations made by the authors or not? And if you do not, do you have a reliable source which contradicts them?
