Nagaraj avare,

  

Thanks for the wonderful theoretical framework for explaining the usages -- formal, colloquial, regional, etc.

  

For example, "summaniru Subbu," has become "sumkirsubbu" -- in some of the Kannada film dialogues, etc.

  

The influence of Urdu/Persian has also changed Kannada, I believe, and "jatka-ssabi Kannada" (a kind of Pidgin-Kannada, you may say) was well-known in the days when I was growing up in Bengaluru and Mysuru.

  

Ramesh
