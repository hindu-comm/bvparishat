Sri Achyut-ji,

  

If you think you know the answer to your question , you make it clear while questioning itself, by saying, 'I know the answer, but I am asking you to know your view.'

  

If you do not know, you make that clear by saying, 'I want to know/learn from the Panini-experts of the group because I do not know.

  

I am asking this to know/learn this because if I know/learn this , it will benefit me in the following way'.  

  

If you think you are guiding your correspondents or members of the list to a certain understanding through your questions, please give up that path.

  

Both traditional vyakarana scholars and modern linguists get irked by these kind of questions.
