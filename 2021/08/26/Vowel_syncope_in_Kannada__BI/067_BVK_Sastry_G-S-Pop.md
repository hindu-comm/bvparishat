Namaste



On \< Wrt "physiologically **articulation**", अँ is as saMvRta as अ is in saMskRta - same mouth cavity configuration. \> :



***Clarification Needed*** : Is there any difference of opinion in this statement- position made below before proceeding further ? 





*In other words*,



 if logic is ‘yes’, then both are ‘articulation/ ucchaarana’- then each mode has its physiological attributes, actions and identities.



if logic is ‘no’, then each is different, unique- as travellers in opposite directions, with unique physiological attributes, actions and identities.



In ‘no- case, there is the entire validation to be revisited and explored as ‘ vak-yoga’ practice instructions, anchored to upanishadic statement: ‘yato vacho nivartante..’- which is explored in neuro-science as ‘brain signal phase of thought-articualtion’: the phonological prime memory of sounds with universal grammar in operation ; and /or traditional tantra as layers pushing ‘ mantra-moola to manas through ‘ naada’.



There are allied disciplines of samgeeta, vaadya \[ music and instruments; damaru being one of them \] which corroborate the ‘no-logic’ line.



Therefore, in ‘bhashaa’ usage, what needs to be the guidance to stand by ‘Shishta-prayoga/ Panineeya-pratijnaa’ ? Popular usage? Or Shaastra?



‘Samvruta and Vivruta’- both are ‘ucchaarana’ in Panini Sutra by instruction as (*अ अ* ) - with different physiological modes of articulation.

The reckoning is by ‘hearing the sound’. The context is ‘Vyakarana is guidance to generate an articulate, processed word to communicate an intended meaning ( vivakshitaartha –vachakah shabdah).

‘Vyakarana- sutra -prakriyaa for ‘pada-nirmiti’ - sambhashana use is different from ‘Vedanta –Prakriyaa- upaasanaa-sutra needed for ‘(tat-)pada-moola - gati’. Due to this, ‘samvruta and vivruta’ - anushaasana needs to be understood in the right context.
