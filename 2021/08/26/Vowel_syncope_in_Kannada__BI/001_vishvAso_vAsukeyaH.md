"Southie" is not an offensive word. Neither is "mallu" for malayALis. "madrAsI" is an evil term because of it being used in bollywood films (avoiding "brothelwood" with effort) to negatively caricature south Indians (verifiable with Gems of Bollywood account on Twitter). I contend that "northie" is not offensive either - and that nityAnanda is just using as a tool to get at me - in his desperation (mirrored in Ajit, Shrinivas and possibly Kushagra) to convince admins to take action against me.

Kindly obseve the video quoted in <https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/03HggX7gCuI/m/MKRhky3oAAAJ> , where nityAnanda uses the example of the kannaDa actor popularly called "rAjkumar", to imply that the elision of a in the word rAjakumAra is typical usage (recall that this was in the context of yog vs yoga and Nag punch me vs nAgapanchamI). Beyond fashionably hindified modern names, the gentleman has not heard this song -<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWh5cvW4xFg> apparently, not read kannaDa books or exposed to kannada usage involving the term "rAjakumAra" (meaning prince).

This is false. shrI R Ganesh gave a talk about SL Bhairappa in Gokhale Institute, where he mentioned something about his remarkable vyAkaraNa studies. As I mentioned - I don't recall the specifics of that claim (the concerned FB account being long deleted). One can purchase a recording of the talk from Gokhale Institute and verify for oneself the details - I wouldn't be surprised if it contains a detail even R Ganesh himself does not recall.



Further, I recall R Ganesh mentioning SL Bhyrappa frequenting the cemetary in Delhi. I recall Nityananda asking for corroboration there too. What should I do - search for sattellite photos LOL?

  

And yes (recalling another FB post from the same time), my friend visited PoK in the 90s and did all the deeds (I recall) you don't believe - nityAnanda - I am not going to scour the country for evidence to convince you.
