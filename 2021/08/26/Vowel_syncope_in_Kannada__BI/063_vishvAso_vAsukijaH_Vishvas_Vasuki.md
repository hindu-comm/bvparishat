Plenty of veda-specific (eg <https://ashtadhyayi.github.io/suutra/8.3/8.3.1/> ) and grammar-instruction-specific examples. Non pANinian grammars (prAtishAkhya-s) allow more. Restricting oneself to laukika bhASha, a couple of sUtra-s as examples -<https://ashtadhyayi.github.io/suutra/8.3/8.3.7/> <https://ashtadhyayi.github.io/suutra/8.4/8.4.57/> .
