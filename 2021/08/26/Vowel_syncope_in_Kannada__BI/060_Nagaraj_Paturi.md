Dear Sri Achyut-ji,

  

There are scholars who spent years in the study of Vyakarana Shaastra fortified with the study of other shaastras that are essential for that study, on this list.

  

You would do better to your limitations in that field and obediently seek guidance from those who are professionals in that.

  

That saves a lot of reinventing the wheel for you and avoids perplexed responses from both the learned and lay audience.

  

Thanks for your understanding.
