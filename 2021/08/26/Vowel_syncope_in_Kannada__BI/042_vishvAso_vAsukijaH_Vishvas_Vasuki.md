<https://deejayvaidya.tumblr.com/post/42275194921/sanskrit-pronunciation-podcast-1-introduction> by shrI dhananjaya is valuable here (esp the comparison accross languages towards the end, though it does not include what I call the tamiL saMvRta a). For practical purposes prayatna-s can only be understood by such comparison.  

  

Fact of the matter is thatspace near the ghoSha-tantrI is not independent of space in the mouth cavity.
