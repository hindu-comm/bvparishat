You can look up Arvind Iyengar's studies on Hebbar Tamil. There was an earlier study by Ramanujan that he cites. You can also search for 'Hebbar Tamil' on the Internet. You can hear no end of "vand koṇḍ" "pōy koṇḍ" "iṭ koṇḍ" etc.  

  

Last but not least, I have a good ear and I have been hearing this for the last 50 years 😀
