Not sure how much that holds. Rather - in cases of linguistic diglossia, when some outsider refers to one's language, the native speaker automatically assumes that he's referring to the "standard form" (the written form in kannaDa), rather than one or many of the many spoken dialects. So, "यर्वाण" and "तर्वाण" would not even come to mind in place of "यद् वा न" or "तद् वा न".
