Prof Nagaraj,

  

The thread can continue, the problem is bigger than confined to Kannada.

but it needs scholarly handling and analysis.

I have requested this before. Many just drop sentences (some grammar check would help).

Respecting spellings in languages is a sign of scholarship.

  

You are the moderator, possibly you represent the general voice.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
