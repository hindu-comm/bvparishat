Dear Prof. Misra,

  

You have the option of not reading the thread, once you look at the title, you know that that is not something that you want to peep in.

  

As a trained linguist, and a cultural anthropologist , I see an interesting aspect in this thread.

  

Strength of one of the correspondents is that the language being discussed is his mother tongue.

  

Strength of the other correspondent is that he is trying to rely on professional published material on the language that is not his mother tongue.

  

These two strengths give both of them their respective sources of confidence.

  

I am happy to see that currently the impoliteness that made several members write to me expressing their disgust is not found in the thread.

  

All members need not be interested in all the topics /threads. Ignoring some threads after looking at their titles may save you from your inconvenience.
