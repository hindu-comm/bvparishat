I have seen niggardliness wrt vowels in Karnataka Iyengars' Tamil speech too. While speaking Tamil, they would say 'for how would I know',
*namkēn teriyum*? which is strictly neither Kannada nor Tamil but it does sycopate the medial and last vowel in *namkēn* after the Kannada fashion. I remember being asked in the morning 'Seenivaasa, unkēn abhyāsa, coffee-ya tea-ya'?. The word 'abhyāsa' is not used in Tamil conversationally in such contexts. The most confusing aspect of these sentences for a Tamil speaker is that the word 'ēnu' meaning 'what' in Kannada is syncopated to 'ēn' conversationally but 'ēn' in Tamil means 'why', not 'what.  

  

I have heard these syncopations in Tamil in Kolar, Hassan, Mysore and Mandya. It's clearly Kannada-influenced.  

  

Hope this helps,

  
Srini
