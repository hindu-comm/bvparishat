If all vowel corruptions are together called संवृत corruptions is not allowing the sutra अ अ to be interpreted as vivruta अ becomes samvruta self defeating, further allowing other corruptions to enter in?

  

While discussing the sutra अअ in the Mahabhashya Patanjali says that it could mean change in swaras (udata anudata too?).

  

Later grammarians need to explain why the sutra must be interpreted as change from vivruta to samvruta to the exclusion of other possibilities.

  

Further from my point of view that प्रयत्न which changes when letters change is बाह्य प्रयत्न and that which does not change when letters change is अभ्यंतर प्रयत्न. Ghosh yantra surely is बाह्य प्रयत्न while samvruta and vivruta are अभ्यंतर प्रयत्न.

  

When a person speaks how is it that he can selectively phonate अ samvruta and not the other vowels?

  

A letter (vowel) by itself cannot be samvruta or vivruta. It depends on with what अभ्यंतर प्रयत्न he or she is phonating.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
