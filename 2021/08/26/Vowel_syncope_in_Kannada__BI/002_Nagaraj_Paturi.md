I did not notice earlier that there was a question addressed to me by Sri Nityanand-ji in that post by him .

  

Now I noticed it while going through this post.

  

Now let me answer that question,

  

"Question to list owner/Prof. Paturi: do you approve the use of the word*northie*for an ethnic North Indian like me on this list?"

  

-- NO. I don't approve. We as learned people should not resort to such slang words as far as possible. My observation is that such expressions are used by juvenile youngsters out of their adolescent fancy for such newly learnt, what they think, 'fun' words. In fact, in their oqwn circles of the same age group, it may not lead to big problems too as the whole group is fun -loving and take such usages towards themselves by others easy. They easily take it because they give the same too.

  

But they too gradually learn that world at large does not take such usages easily and may land them in trouble in public discourse. That happens as part of their growing up.
