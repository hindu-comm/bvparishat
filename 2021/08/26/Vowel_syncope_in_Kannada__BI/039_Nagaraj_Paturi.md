Someone was proposing for some weekend humour on BVP to relax. Sri Prabhu-ji's brought that much needed comic relief.

  

However,

  

\> "summaniru Subbu," has become "sumkirsubbu" -- in some of the Kannada film dialogues, etc.

  

---- sumkirSubbu is not a transformation of summaniru Subbu. sumkirSubbu seems to be from Summage/summake+ir(u). summage/summake is found in some dialects like Raichur dialect.

  

Using dialects for paatrochita sambhaashaNa(I would call it linguistic realism) advised by Bharata is fine. But film people quite often do it for humour. That stereotypescertain dialects and the regions and communities that speak it. Nowadays some regions and communities are protesting such stereotyping.

  

During the movement for a separate Telangana, stereotypingTelangana dialect in films was also cited as one of the reasons for discontentment with the united Andhra Pradesh.
