“*If all vowel corruptions are together called* *संवृत corruptions is not allowing the sutra अ अ to be interpreted as vivruta अ becomes samvruta self defeating, further allowing other corruptions to enter in*?“

I don’t think that saṃvṛta pronunciation is a corruption. It is standard pronunciation in Malayalam and Tamil.

The final /ŭ/ in the word nāḍŭ (written nāṭŭ – നാടു് = country) is called by grammarians as saṃvṛta ukāram in Malayalam and kuṯṯiyal (written kuṟṟiyal) ukaram in Tamil. This is a schwa that has evolved from the hrasva (short) /u/. The candrakkala, the halant symbol that looks like a crescent moon, is written over the hrasva ‘u’ ligature to show that the hrasva ‘u’ has become a saṃvṛta ukāram (ടു്). In Tamil, the kuṯṯiyal ukaram is not shown in modern writing.

In the word nāṭṭukāran (നാട്ടുകാരൻ = fellow countryman) the u within the word is pronounced as a schwa, not as a full hrasva u. But this is not shown in writing. The pronunciation of this schwa is different from the word-final saṃvṛta ukāram such as in nāḍŭ. I understand that Kodagu (the language of Kodagu area, or Coorg) has these two kinds of schwas, the word final saṃvṛta ukāram and the schwa within words.
