Respected list members,

  

Is there any manuscript of the Bhavishyottara Purana available for public to view (i.e., a person like me, with no relevant academic qualifications). I am interested in the Venkatesha-Mahatmyam portion of it.

  

The TTD E-Books library has a typeset and published book here \[1\] which has it, but I would also like to refer to any manuscript, or an older publication of the same by some other publisher, if available.

  

Thank you.

  

Pradyumna
