The fears you mentioned could be based on the sentence :

  

"However, there will be a greater flexibility in the three-language formula, and *no language will be imposed on any State*."  

  

in the paragraph cited.

  

Hindi teachers might be fearing that the anti-Hindi states might use this to remove Hindi.
