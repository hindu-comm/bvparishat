Yes I tried to send an email on the address

mentioned there - mspblr\[at\]yahoo\[dot\]com

but I get an error saying address not found.

They have a digital copy of the original manuscript

available at the Sringeri Sharada Peetham library..

looks like I'll have to reach out to them directly

(any leads will be appreciated for the same!)
