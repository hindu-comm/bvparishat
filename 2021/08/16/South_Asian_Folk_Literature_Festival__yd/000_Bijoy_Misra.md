Friends,

We are hosting a South Asian Folk Literature Festival, coming Sunday, Aug 22

by Zoom. Indian time will be 7:30 PM.

We have about twenty entries including Sanskrit. We still need Malayalam, Telugu,  

Urdu and Nepali. Please contact me privately if you have interest.  

The following protocol applies:

Festival protocol:

1. We select a representative composition from the area that we come from or are familiar with.

2. We introduce ourselves and introduce the poem with a five-slide introduction.

The slides are:
