Respected list members,

  

Is there any work done on dating of the Venkatesha Kalyana (the Gregorian date corresponding to the marriage of Sri Venkateshwara with Padmavati devi)?

  

The [tirumala.org](http://tirumala.org) website mentions an approximate "5000 years ago", which could be somewhere around 3000BC, but is there a more precise date?

  

Thank you

Pradyumna
