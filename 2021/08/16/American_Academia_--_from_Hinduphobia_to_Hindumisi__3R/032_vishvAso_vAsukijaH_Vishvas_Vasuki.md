Part of <https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1429466848374902789.html> posted by Megh addresses this as well. "If you doubt this point, ask yourself whether academics would so casually sponsor a conference on "Dismantling Wahabbism" or "Dismantling the CCP." The answer is no, because there would be actual consequences. The BJP/RSS lack the $ & competence to play this game." Fact is that they don't even have the conviction.

- <https://twitter.com/rAma_jAmadagnya/status/1421168347199131652> - "MB refers to his previous statement in Delhi about "Hindutva being incomplete without Muslims" that did raise eyebrows in the Hindu society. But says, these is the ideology of the Sangh since the beginning, can be found in "Bunch of Thoughts" as well." (contradicting guruji's words of vigilance in that very book <https://hindutva.github.io/books/golvAlkar/bunch_of_thoughts_golwalkar/03_Part_Two_The_Nation_and_Its_Problems/08_XVI_Internal_Threats/> )

-"Mohan Bhagwat quite categorically clarifies that this is the age of democracy and we do not fight for Hindu supremacy. Neither should anyone fight for Muslim supremacy."<https://twitter.com/rAma_jAmadagnya/status/1421180681313427456>
