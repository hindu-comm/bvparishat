Many Indians, each pay huge amounts of their hard earned money for getting a degree from the universities mentioned in the flyer and other universities all over the US.

  

Granted, most of the students enter other departments than the ones organizing this event, still...

It is not inconceivable that the Indian international students' fees,**indirectly**, help these universities sustain the academic programs and faculty thriving with this type of prejudice and agenda, as evident in the flyer.

  

A rough estimate is that there are about 200,000 Indian international students in the US.

On an average the tuition fee for an international student is about $30000/pa.

(International student fee is probably the highest in the fee structure)

Even with a back of the envelope calculation, one can ballpark the huge amount of $$$ Indian students bring into the US university system.

  

Money talks!

There must be a way to leverage those $$$, such that these universities moderate and reform their narrow minded and biased academic programs and faculty, for their own good.

Prabhu
