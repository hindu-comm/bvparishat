Among the Indologists who are not in their hearts anti-hindutva - I gather that among them it is not good for one's career to be pro-hindutva. They may even have to periodically drop an "anti-hindutva" word here and there to signal their compliant status. Even after becoming Associate Professor, there is the greed to be Professor, named professor etc.. Besides, by the time they get "tenure", they are so conditioned to being thralls of "the system" that their "boldness" becomes only constrained to unearthing a few counter-traditional insights.
