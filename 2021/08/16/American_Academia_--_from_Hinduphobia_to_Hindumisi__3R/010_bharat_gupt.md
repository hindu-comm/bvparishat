I have signed, so shall many of us. But this is not sufficient.

  

I was seeing this coming noticing the aggressive posts of

Truschke on Risa list. As you all know the power houses behind such Hinduism hatred and dismantling are Islamists and Christian proselytisers.

And it is NOT onetime.

Hindus have to counter not merely in a defensivemanner but with all offence, highlighting the damage that Islam and Christianity have done to civilizations, arts and culture throughout history.

  

Pointing out the creation of Arts and Culture by Hindus and all other Iconophiles including the so called tribal and forest dwellers on one hand and the destructive of the same by Christians and Muslims on the other hand, hurts the Leftists most and gains the sympathy of average Americans and European.

  

The Biden Blunder in Afghanistan and the inevitable horrors conducted by Talibanis will only strengthen our arguments.

  

For that we need to plan many things.

  

1\. A Conference six months later

which focuses not on just countering Left academic jargon but on Iconoclastic Abrahmism and it's ravages in history.

  

A major theme should be real learned papers on plunder of Americas its Aztecs and Mayans. Also the decultruralisation of African people. Hinduism should be presented as the major player among Iconophiles/ Muurtipujakas/ Saguna pujakas of the world who have been and are still being targeted by Abrahamics and and their intellectual heirs the Marxists.

  

2\. Alert GOI about the links of several academics with proselytisers and who I am sure are part of this anti Hindu conference.

  

3\. Alert Ms Meenakshi Lekhi as to how a long term counter is needed to be planned in many forums and how all Indian missions should know about this dismantling Hinduism conference and its participants.

  

Best regards

Bharat Gupt.
