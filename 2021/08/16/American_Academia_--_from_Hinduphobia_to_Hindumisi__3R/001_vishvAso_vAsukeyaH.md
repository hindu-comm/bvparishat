One of their claims is that Hinduphobia is bogus.  
  
Of interest is a quote from 'Hindutva Harrassment Field Manual,' by South Asia Scholar Activist Collective (SASAC) of Audrey Truschke (famous Awrangzeb scholar and Hindu baiter), recently promoted byDominik Wujastyk on their Indology mailing list:  
  
First -- "Anti-Hindu bias, \[unlike Islamophobia and anti-Semitism\], \*cannot be easily linked\* to casualties on such horrific scales." Source: 'Hindutva Harrassment Field Manual,' South Asia Scholar Activist Collective (SASAC).  
  
and part of a response <https://rattibha.com/thread/1427307516657119233?lang=en> fromParth Parihar -  
  

"Nothing is more clear, or \*more easily documented\*, than the systematic campaign of terror – and its genocidal consequences – launched by the Pakistani army on the night of March 25th..." Source: Ted Kennedy, U.S. Senate Judiciary Comte. "Crisis in South Asia."

Kennedy continued, "Hardest hit have been members of the Hindu community who have been robbed of their lands and shops, systematically slaughtered and, in some places, painted with yellow patches marked ‘H.' America’s heavy support of Islamabad is nothing short of complicity."

To repeat the contrast for emphasis, First -- "cannot be easily linked to casualties on horrific scales." (SASAC, 2021) Second -- "Nothing is more clear, or more easily documented... campaign of terror... genocidal consequences... Hindu community." (Sen. Kennedy, 1971)
