Just a possible clarification of a sentence that could be read more than one way, from a post on Aug. 16:

  

"Of interest is a quote from 'Hindutva Harrassment Field Manual,' by South Asia Scholar Activist Collective (SASAC) of Audrey Truschke (famous Awrangzeb scholar and Hindu baiter), recently promoted byDominik Wujastyk on their Indology mailing list:"

  

An announcement of the 'Hindutva Harrassment Field Manual' was posted by Dominik Wujastyk on the Indology mailing list. Audrey Truschke, who could possibly be read as the subject of the sentence, was not promoted there. Rather, the subject of the sentence intended by the writer, I believe, is the manual. As an added note, Audrey resigned from the Indology list some time ago, due to her dissatisfaction with the Indology Committee that she used to be a member of.
