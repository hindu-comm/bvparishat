I would urge list members to avoid the Hindutva Harassment website Manual promoted by the likes of Dominic Wujastyk and FrAudery T(u)ruschke because some people are reporting that their are computer attacks from that website to steal their passwords etc. See an image. These Hinduphobes/Hindumisics are totally full of hate and can really stop very low. See the image below.

  

As of now, 5 Universities have already written back denying (or retracting) the claims of 'sponsorship' to their Hindu Hatefest.

  

Haters like Wujastyk and Trushke's flourish because of their Indian origin Gungadin enablers including some on this very list who are now writing Krishna Bhakti shlokas.
