Dear friends,  

There are many in this list who silently observe Dominik Wujastyk.  

Hopefully they will take up the matter with him and protest.

He conveniently would not allow me to enter the list claiming that

he "owns" the list. A lot of garbage is "officially" sponsored through the list.

It is time people think on behalf of the country and not personal convenience.

To label all material from India as Hindutva is ignorant and non-sense.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
