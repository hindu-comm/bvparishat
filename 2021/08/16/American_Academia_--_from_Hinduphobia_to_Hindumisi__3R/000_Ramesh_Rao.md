Learned folks,

  

Few can say as clearly, thoughtfully, and powerfully as R. Jagannathan (Jaggi) can, and this commentary of his needs to be translated into different languages, shared, discussed, and become part of a conference/some conferences. We are close to a tipping point here, and our children and grandchildren can easily become prey or become part of the Hindumisic gangs...

  

This commentary is about the variety of academics, collaborating with forty plus universities in the US, organizing a conference on "Dismantling Hindutva".

With regards,

  

Ramesh Rao
