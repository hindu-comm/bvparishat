Indeed so - although I still suspect Dominik Wujastyk and certain other leading lights of Western Indology of having actively promoted Audrey's campaigns and career; and that making her part of <https://indology.info/committee-members/> was part of it (besides being a "signalling" mechanism). I don't have proof, of course, but it fits the profile.
