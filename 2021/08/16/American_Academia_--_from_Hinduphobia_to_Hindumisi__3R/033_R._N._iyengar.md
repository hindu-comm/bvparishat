Dear Members:

Here is my two paise about the unfortunate statement:-

  

Haters like Wujastyk and Trushke's flourish because of their Indian origin Gungadin enablers including some on this very list who are now writing Krishna Bhakti shlokas.

  

This is a totally uncalled for comment. Please don't beat below the belt. What has Krishna Bhakti to do with problems about academics organizing conferences? We all know who writes on Krishna Bhakti. If one has the scholarship to criticize his 1000 verses on traditional lines he can do so. But passing sarcastic and hateful judgements on the person is not Hindu Dharma. This calls for a proper apology on the part of Sri Vishal Agarwal. I know Vishal through correspondences and his devotion to Hinduism and Dharma is extraordinary. But I am saddened by the tone of his comment. Let us take the good points and leave aside the bad points and not bad mouth Sanskrit Scholars and Pundits. I feel this would be the real *Sadasadvastuviveka,* badly needed by NRI's and Swadeshis to nurture true Bharatiyavidvat.

  

Cheers

RN Iyengar
