Megh Kalyanasundaram-ji,Thank you for sharing the infographics!

  

Based on the infographics, nearly Rs50,000Crores went into universities(economy around it),...

Many of those universities have departments, academic programs and faculty espousing biased, stereotypical ideas in the name of academic pursuits as evident in the flyer.

The universities could be ranked based on a score representing the degree to which their "departments, academic programs and faculty espouse such biased, stereotypical ideas".

Such a ranking would inform and to some extent influence, the Indian students when they decide on which universities they apply to...

  

Prabhu
