Yes, another term of signalling is the adjective "Hindu Nationalist" added before a historian or scholar. This viSeshaNa truly does its job of differentiation. For instance Romila Thapar is just a historian, but Sitaram Goel would become a Hindu Nationalist historian.

  

May be, we should start using the term Hinduphobic Indologist, or Anti-Vedic Indologist for such people. We can maintain the list of anti-Hindu and anti-Vedic stances of these haters, so that 'fact checkers' can easily verify the same.
