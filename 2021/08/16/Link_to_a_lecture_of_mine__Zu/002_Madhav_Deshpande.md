Dear Ajit Ji,

  

  I agree with you. It was somewhat disconcerting even to me as I was giving this lecture. But they could have handled this just by switching to the speaker's window as the only window on the screen. Anyway, it looks like they did not realize this in time. Thanks for sharing your comments regarding this aspect. Best wishes,
