We can drop the expectations of finding or wanting readers, and focus our attention on sharing what is meaningful to us.

  

In this era of plenty(?) , ensuring that the work can/will be found easily by interested readers is the challenge.  

  

That's probably one reason why Dr Kannan writes about the need for catalogues, etc
