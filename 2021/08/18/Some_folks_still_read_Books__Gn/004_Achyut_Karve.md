Dear Yadi Moharirji,

  

'Perception is not reality, hence not the truth'.

  

This quote reminds me of Ahmed jan Thirakwa who while teaching used to say 'अबे अंधे हो, बहिरे हो, दिखाई नाही देता, सुनाई नाही देता'. In the samevein Patanjali in his Mahbhashya says, some are blind in spite of having eyes and deaf inspire of having ears.

  

To get the right perception there is no way other than Yoga.

  

The quote should have been 'Mere perception .......  not the truth.'.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
