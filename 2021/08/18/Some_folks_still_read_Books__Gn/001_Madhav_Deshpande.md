Finding readers for books is not so easy. After I worked for 20 years to edit and publish the edition of the Śaunakīya Caturādhyāyika, A Pratiśākhya of the Atharvaveda, my daughters used to tease me that there will be at the most five readers of this book per century. I would be happy to count those five brave readers.
