BVP would do well to encourage authors and publishers  

to regularly intimate their new publications

\- in fact as soon as they are published/released.  

  

It may even be desirable to request them to send alongside their  

Cover Page, Technical Page (Copyright Page), & Contents Page.

(Also, List of Contributors (if there are multiple papers/chapters  

from different pens) and their brief bio as a bonus.)

  

BVP may also request all important publishers of Indological books to regularly send  

soft copies of their Catalogues of Publication as and when they are published/updated;

and the same may be furnished to the members in the List. The support and cooperation of all  

Indological organisations may also be enlisted for this. List-members may also be welcomed to

contribute to this information store which can be built into a database in course of time.

  

Many journals indicate "Books received", or show "Books reviewed".

Subscribers/users of the journals may also supply those bits of information to BVP.

  

The responses in the beginning may be nil to disenthusing in the beginning,

but things will gather momentum by and by.
