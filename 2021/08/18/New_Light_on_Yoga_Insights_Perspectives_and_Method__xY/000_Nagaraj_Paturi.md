Over the last three decades, Modern Yoga Studies has established itself as a vibrant and multifaceted field of research that fruitfully combines approaches from the disciplines of Indology and South Asian studies, religious studies, philosophy and anthropology. Through this multidisciplinary effort, the perception of Yoga in the academic world has fundamentally changed. These significant improvements in the state of research need to be communicated, discussed, and shared within the circle of specialists and the broader public with a sustained interest in the history of Yoga theory and practice. With this thought in mind, Yoga Vidya e.V. organizes an international academic conference in co-operation with the Universities of Leipzig and Hamburg, where some of the world-leading specialists in Modern Yoga Studies will gather to highlight their recent discoveries, insights and innovative methodological approaches in comprehensive and comprehensible live-on-stage and online presentations, each of which will be concluded with a public discussion.
