अर्काद् विनिसृतः प्राचीं यद्यात्यहरहः शशी।

तच्चान्द्रमानमंशैस्तु ज्ञेया द्वादशभिस्तिथिः॥

            - सूर्यसिद्धांतः १४/१२

   As mentioned in Surya Siddhanta, a tithi consists of 12° of separation and in it's multiples of the speedy planet Moon from the planet Sun.

  

   A tithi ends at same time and begins at same time all over the globe as the planetary longitudes are geo-centric. But, that differs from place to place as per their local times which can be traced out from their standard zones of time.

  

    The simple formula is - find out the time difference in Sun rise and reverse the correction to find out tithi timings. I give you an example.

  

If Sun rises at 5:45 am at 82°30\` E , I can find out the sun rise at any place in India doing LMT correction from IST.

  

For Tirupati, the correction is +12 min to get the sunrise, i.e. sun rise is at 5:57 am.

  

Reverse this for tithi end timings.

i.e. -12 , so if a tithi ends at 11:52 am at IST, the same tithi ends at 11:40 at Tirupati.
