Pranam to all learned scholars,  
  
Our lunar calendar is based on tithi, when the angular distance between sun and moon is zero, it is amavasya, and when it is 180 degrees, it is purnima.  
  
Does a certain tithi begin at the same time in all the locations? Or are there some simple formulae to calculate the same,if a certain tithi begins at different times at differentlocations?  

  
Thanks,  
Prakash Raj Pandey
