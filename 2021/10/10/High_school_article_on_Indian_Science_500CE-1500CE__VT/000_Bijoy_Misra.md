Friends,

We have been talking about PhD topics. I am sharing an article I just

published on Indian Science and Technology 500CE-1500CE.

You can see how the essay is loaded with topics that need further  

examination and research. Our goal here is to help create motivation

in the high school student to new areas of research. We will experiment

on this next year spring.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra

There are six tracks (i) Geography and People (ii) Art and Culture (iii) Language and Literature (iv) Philosophy and Religion (v) Science and Technology and (vi) Economy and Politics

  

We divide the chronology to seven periods upto 1947 CE. This division is

arbitrary, but the possibility of new research content in each period is rich.

Well grounded students with analytic minds can create the next generation

of fundamental research through the material. We need motivated high

school teachers world-wide. We will gradually look for them. Young PhD students can join the research through their institutions. The goal is to

create interdisciplinary contributions for world-wide circulation.
