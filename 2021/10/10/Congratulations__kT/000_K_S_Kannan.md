Like Sri Anand Viswanathan who has been given  

the **INSA Young Historian of Science** Award for 2021,

Dr. Sriram, M\[ayasandra\] S\[ubrahmanya\]  

Professor KV Sarma Research Foundation, Chennai,

has also been elected as a **Fellow of INSA** in the category of   

History and Philosophy of Science.

  

Professor Sriram worked in Dept. of Theoretical Physics, University of Madras for about 30 years,  

getting interested in History of Science in the latter part of his tenure. Through a large number of scholarly volumes  

which serve as source of crucial, scientific information on the early development of Astronomy and Mathematics in India  

and various other publications in journals as well as invited articles in encyclopedias, Prof. Sriram has been able to bring to light,  

in an authentic manner, without an iota of hyperbole, some of the remarkable *contributions made by Indians to Astronomy and Mathematics,*  

which had remained only partially known, or totally unknown for long and for this reason he is highly suited for election under this special category.

  

Prof. Sriram stays on IIT-M Campus.

  

Earlier, I had forwarded to BVP a number of articles authored by him  

on ancient Indian achievements in science, and serialised in the *New Indian Express.*

***Hearty congratulations to both !***
