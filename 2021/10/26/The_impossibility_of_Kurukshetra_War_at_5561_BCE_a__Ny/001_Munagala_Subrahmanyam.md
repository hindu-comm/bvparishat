Respected sir ,

 

I have some doubts please clear them .

  

 1. As i heard Raja Tarangini tells the lineage of the kings from the starting of kaliyuga. Have you completely gone through the sanskrit edition of it ?

  

2\. Citing Raja Rama Mohan Roy with similar opinion won't be suitable in the present era due to technological advancements. His opinion may be suitable for that era . We accept his scholarships and his contributions but it doesn't mean that we accept everything what he said. He himself against such a blind following .

  

3\. What about the application of Radio Carbon Dating technique on Ramasetu or dwaraka ?? It gives a better result than historical opinions . Is it done by anyone ??? May i know it please .

  

4.Imagination of that time with the present time won't be suitable. We cant take the age limit of a generation as 25 years like ours. Because we have 300 years lived person namely Trailinga swamy in kashi. His identity has historical records also.

  

5\. We had already a great historian who told that Yudhistira was inspired by Buddha .

  

Please don't spread those types of stories. And please don't indulge yourself into finding evidences for such things.

  

There is a need to re - search the history along with scientific technologies . Mere opinions differs from individual to individual.

  

Thank you

  

Sorry for inconvenience if any.
