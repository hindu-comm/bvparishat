Namaste all,

  

I am extremely happy to share that Starting November 10, I will be conducting a course on "**Hindu Ethics: An introduction to Samanya Dharma**" on the Indica Courses Platform.

  
The Hindu worldview is built around the principle of Dharma. As the name “Sanatana Dharma” itself denotes, Hindu philosophy and practice is essentially a perpetual striving for the actualization of the eternal principles of Dharma, which are understood as governing the life of the entire universe and all the beings who inhabit it. These principles often called Samanya Dharma constitute the core of Hindu Ethics.

  
Many of you might be familiar with my book on Samanya Dharma (<https://www.amazon.in/SAMANYA-DHARMA-NITHIN-SRIDHAR/dp/8194282608/>). This course will explore deeper into the contents of the book and go beyond into larger aspects of Hindu Ethics.

  
This is an important course, relevant for all practicing Hindus, most importantly to those who speak, write or work in Hindu Sphere.

  
Here is a short write-up on Samanya Dharma-<https://indica.courses/hindu-ethics-a-primer/>  

  
**Details of the course:**  
10 November 2021 - 12 January 2022

5-6:30 PM IST, Every Wednesday
