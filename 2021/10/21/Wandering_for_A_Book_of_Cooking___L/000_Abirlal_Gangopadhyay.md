Respected Members,

  

I am looking for a cooking book in Sanskrit, ***Pākarājeśvara***. Over the internet, I found that the book is in [British Library](https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/pakrajeshwar). Would you please help me to find out a pdf copy of that book? It was publishedin Bengali script.

  

I shall really appreciate any help you can provide.

  

Bestwishes,
