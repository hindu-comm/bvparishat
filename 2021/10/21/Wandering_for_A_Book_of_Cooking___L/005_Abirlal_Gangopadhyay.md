Dear Sunilji,

  

Yes, you are right. At first, from some preview images, I thought it was in Sanskrit with Bengali script, which is incorrect. There are Sanskritverses with Bengalimeaning and passages in Bengali which providesvarious recipes; mostof them are non-veg. Still, there are many interestingverses in Sanskrit at the beginningand the end ofthe book.

  

Another reason that I thought the book is entirelyin Sanskrit as Ifound a reference to the same in *Kalpadruma*.

  

Best regards,

Abir
