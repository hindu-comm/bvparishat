Paturi Sir, both Kshemakutuhalam and Bhojanakutuhalam were translated by me into English when I was working in FRLHT. I wouldn't rate them as great translations but the fact remains I translated them. You would however not find my name printed prominenly anywhere in those books. It is relegated to some corner, may be before the typesetter's name.

Regards

Shankar Rajaraman.
