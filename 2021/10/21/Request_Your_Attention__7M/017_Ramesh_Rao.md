Thanks for sharing this article by Sahishnu-ji, Nagaraj avare.

  

Very important for those who are concerned about methods, methodology. It has been the nature of "modern" social science/humanities endeavors where the methods/theory tails have been wagging the content dog.

  

Thanks, once again.  

  

Ramesh
