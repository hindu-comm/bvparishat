Namaste,

  
I read this article in NPR, sent by my daughter who stays in the USA. It merely shows ignorance of the Indian traditions and mere overenthusiasm about women conducting the ritual.

While we should not have any objection to women conducting the marriage ceremony (in fact, we have to welcome it), we may note the following.

One point to be noted is that in all cases of daanam, the donor says na mama, which means not mine. For instance, when a cow is donated to a Brahmin the donor says, ‘tubhyam aham daasyaami, na mama’ (I give this to you, it is not mine). The ownership is transferred. Kanyaadaan is one in which the words ‘na mama’ are not told. The father continues to have his love and affection for the daughter, even after sending her to the in-laws’ place.

Another point to be noted is that as per the tradition ‘ashta-varshaa bhavet kanyaa’, ‘an eight-year-old girl is called a kanyaa’ a virgin, presuming that she would attain puberty at that age. It is the duty of the father to perform her marriage as early as possible, as otherwise, he would go to hell, according to Manu. The parents were fairly sure that the daughter was a kanya at the time of marriage. In the article in NPR, the woman is thirty-five years old and well established in a job. I cannot venture to say about her virginity, which of course, has become a matter of ridicule now.

Again, the vow of loyalty, ‘dharme ca arthe ca kaame ca naati charaami’, (in all matters of dharma, artha and kaama, I will not go beyond you), is uttered both by the bride and the bridegroom. It is not only the bride who swears loyalty. In the matter of moksha, which is an independent pursuit of self-knowledge, it is natural that the vow of loyalty cannot cover it.
