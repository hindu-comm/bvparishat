Much noise has been made about these 'feminist' rituals with ritual angas omitted by fiat and augmented with Rabindrasangeet, including by now a Bengali film (Brahma Janen Gopon Kommoti) made to promote them and a Kolkata-based Durgapuja to their credit this year. The NPR article quotes the priestess Professor Nandini Bhowmick as saying:

\>\> QUOTE \>\> "You have to be confident, you have to study hard," says Nandini, a*Shubhamastu*priestess who recently started using only one name to avoid revealing her caste. "But you can become priests by profession. Why not?" On hiatus from her job as a professor of Sanskrit at Kolkata's Jadavpur University, Nandini, 60, claims as much right to interpret — or reinterpret — Hindu scripture as any other priest. "I have just omitted those portions \[of Hindu wedding liturgy\] which are regressive to women. Like*kanyadaan*, the donation of the daughter to the husband and in-laws," she explains. "How can I keep that, when women of today are so enlightened? They are empowered! Most of them are working." \<\< QUOTE \<\<

A number of scholars above have posted various (arguably modern) perspectives in defense of the kanyadana. I would like to highlight a passage from Hariharacharya's bhasya on the Paraskaragrhya (the bhasya dating to the 13th to 14th century) which as part of the shastra makes a conclusive remark on the issue. This is the traditional defense of the kanyadana. As a priest, I have in the past received many questions about the kanyadana and I have taken recourse to this passage to assuage doubts about the traditional view. I attach the photo (please excuse my scribbles in the margins).

The citation is: *Tripathi, Brahmanand (ed.). (2015). Grhyasutra of Paraskara (with two commentaries of Harihar and Gadadhar). Varanasi: Chaukhamba Surbharati Prakashan, pp. 77.*

In short, as early as the 13th century (long before Europe ever heard of feminism), the term "dana" is interpreted as having a gauna sense in the case of the kanyadana, and not a mukhya sense. Why? Hariharacharya says quite poignantly that one cannot alienate one's own daughter or truly make another's daughter one's own. Even after the vivaha, the daughter still remains one's own daughter and not someone else's. He further cites that the smritis also speak of a putradana, which too is to be taken in the gauna sense.

I often take a modern example to illustrate this to my yajamans who are not familiar with the shastras. Imagine an anchor on stage introducing a famous singer, saying "I give you so-and-so". That "give" is not a literal giving; it is not quite even a metaphor. It has the sense of being a 'formal presentment', which kanyadana really is. A groom is formally received and the bride is presented before him. The groom does not stride into the house of his own accord and march off into the bride's bedchamber. The formal 'dana' is the sistachara which the shastras preserve. Just as when guests come, the lord of the household formally introduces his family members, saying, "may I present my son/wife/daughter?", the word "present" doesn't actually mean that the guest is going to have ownership rights over the said family member.

The new brand of 'stage' feminist priests of elite circles in Kolkata astonishes me, because despite their credentials (of being Sanskritic scholars), their actions demonstrate an incredibly poor understanding of kalpashastra/karmakanda. If they were novices or enthusiasts with no claim to specialist knowledge, one could overlook their actions as kind sentiments and gestures. However, the claim by Professor Nandini Bhowmick is that as a professor of Sanskrit at Jadavpur, she has 'as much as right to interpret - or reinterpret - Hindu scripture as any other priest'. To this claim, the counter-argument is that karmakanda is a shastra in its own right, and as a specialist body of knowledge, requires specialist expertise. To the best of my knowledge, Jadavpur's Sanskrit dept does not have a Karmakanda group. An expert in sahitya or puranetihasa may be ill-equipped to interpret karmakanda. But a scholar of a Karmakanda department is certainly within his or her rights to reinterpret older smritis, regardless of caste or gender, provided the interpretation is grounded and well-argued. A simple shibboleth against "regressive" patriarchy is not going to fly. The text that I cited above is part of the syllabus of Karmakanda courses at undergraduate and postgraduate levels at the Sanskrit universities (atleast Varanasi, as far as memory serves). Anyone with a rudimentary understanding of Purva Mimamsa would be able to follow Hariharacharya's logic. A shastrajna pandit may well be expected to elucidate that shastrartha to the general public, instead of imposed etic concepts and lenses. It would appear therefore that Professor Bhowmick's praxis fails to live up to her own standards: namely, that of studying hard. It is unacceptable that Professor Bhowmick characterizes 'kanyadana' as a 'donation to the in-laws'. Have scholarship, knowledge, humility and shraddha all been rendered into bhasma by the Rabindrasangeet-infused vivaha-agni?

The NPR article does not forget to do some brahman-bashing. After all, how can Rama-prasamsa ever be complete without a bit of Ravana-ninda? Nothing new ever comes onstage without criticizing the old, for without the inadequacy of the old, the new has no raison d'etre. The degradation of vaidika karmakanda in Bengal over the decades (for many reasons) is no secret. If the contention is that the Hindu priesthood has been restricted to male brahmans, that may certainly be debated. It is easy for those of a reformist zeal to dismiss the discrimination (almost proletarianizing the new 'modern woman' priest), but what is not easy to dismiss is the shraddha and nistha that is inculcated and ingrained when generation after generation (of 'male brahmans') dedicates and commits to the study of karmakanda. That kind of knowledge is not essentially bound by caste and gender; it can certainly be learnt and cultivated. But without shraddha, there can be no learning. As the NPR article further lets slip, the collective is more of an event management company with some 'progressive' rituals thrown in as part of the upholstery. This new phenomenon may be aptly called the "Insta-purohits", who perform to the screen and to the audience for instantaneous effect and fame, not to serve the society and the cause of knowledge at large, but to pander to the limelight and indulge in self-promotion.

I conclude with a note on the importance of shraddha (extolled everywhere in Hinduism) in this passage from the Devipurana:

श्रद्धा धर्मः परः सूक्ष्मः श्रद्धा ज्ञानं हुतं तपः।  
श्रद्धा स्वर्गश्च मोक्षश्च श्रद्धा सर्वमिदं जगत्॥  
सर्वस्वं जीवितञ्चापि दद्यादश्रद्धया यदि।  
नाप्नुयात् स फलं किञ्चित् श्रद्दधानस्ततो भवेत्॥  

Shubhamastu,
