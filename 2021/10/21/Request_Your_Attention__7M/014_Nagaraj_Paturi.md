while we are all in this admiration of this well substantiated article by Sri Sahishnu-ji,

  

let me share a wonderful article of him that he shared with me last year.

  

Remember Prof. Bronkhorst'spitching tradition against history and attacking tradition from his religious faith in history and in his religious commitment for his enlightenment forefathers ?

  

This paper by Sri Sahishnu-ji is in support of tradition pitching it against what he calls 'western episteme'.
