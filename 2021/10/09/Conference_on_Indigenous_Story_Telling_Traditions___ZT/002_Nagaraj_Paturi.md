Dear Sri Bijoy-ji,

  

This is not a pseudonym.

  

There are issues with display names and actual email ids.

  

Please be assured. The moderator is able to check those issues and take care of them.

  

The present id is from a scholar.

  

But I explained several times how BVP is not limited to scholars, particularly Sanskrit scholars.

  

Those who are by career working in the area of Physics are members here though they may not have formal qualifications in Sanskrit or related fields.

  

Those who publish Sanskrit and Indian language/culture related materials, those who work in several different forms for Sanskrit, Indian languages, Indian culture, Indic culture etc. are all here.

  

Those who are just seekers of guidance from Sanskrit and shaastra scholars are also here.

  

You may take the help of the moderator(s) when you have difficulty with any display name or id.

  

Thanks and regards,

  

Nagaraj
