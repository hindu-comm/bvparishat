Nagarajji,

We should follow a common protocol.

Any institutional mail can be distributed by the Moderator..

The list would enhance its value with one to one communications.

I love what Indica is doing, but let a scholar name be valued more for reference (posterity).

Only individuals are members in the list in their personal capacity.  

This is my suggestion.  

BVP management may consider its merit.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
