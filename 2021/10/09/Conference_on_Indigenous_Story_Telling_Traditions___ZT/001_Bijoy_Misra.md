Some time ago, we had agreed not to use pseudonyms while posting in BVP

to keep the list as a peer driven list. While I admire what Indica.org is doing,

I request to kindly honor this protocol if we can.  

My request to maintain BVP as a Scholars' forum with our own abilities

and not reduce it to a social group.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
