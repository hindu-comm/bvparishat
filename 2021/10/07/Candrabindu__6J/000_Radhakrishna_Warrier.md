This is about candrabindu or ardha candrabindu (अँ) of Devanāgari script. Plenty of Hindi words use candrabindu, for example हाँ (yes) and चाँद (moon).

  

Is candrabindu essential in writing Sanskrit in Devanāgari? 

  

Plenty of Sanskrit text has been written in Malayalam script. Malayalam script has no candrabindu. Malayalam has only anusvāra. So, it looks like candrabindu is not really required in writing Sanskrit. 

  

I haven’t come across candrabindu in Kannada, and I believe it is no longer used in Telugu although Telugu script has candrabindu (అఁ).
Gujarati has candrabindu but I haven’t seen it used as extensively as in Hindi. Where there is candrabindu in Hindi, Gujarati uses just anusvāra for its Gujarati tatsama. ચાંદ and ચાંદી are examples where the Hindi equivalents have candrabindu (चाँद, चाँदी).
