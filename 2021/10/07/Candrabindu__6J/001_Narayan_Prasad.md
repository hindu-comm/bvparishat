\<\< Is candrabindu essential in writing Sanskrit in Devanāgari?
..... So, it looks like candrabindu is not really required in writing Sanskrit.>\>

  

Candrabinduis very much used in Sanskrit, see, for example, in the very beginning of ऋग्वेद, "स देवाँ एह वक्षति". It is also prescribed by Panini.

It is found in the Bhagvadgita etc.
