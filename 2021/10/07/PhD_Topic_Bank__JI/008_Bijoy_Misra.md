Dear Aravindaji,

It is not useful to waste time in contesting people's calculated political views.

We give it validation by reacting. one can write a review refuting it.

The authors rarely read the text in full.  

The world is waiting for the Indian scholarship to teach them philosophy.  

India has to prepare students who are well grounded and well skilled in

oratory and public speaking. We don't need to react, we have to create new  

world class material and present it world platforms (including Indian platforms.)

A new scholar's vow has to be only to study original text and create new translation.

It may take time, but a little originality would go a long way. The world respects!

On Devi and Markandeya purana, the feminine content of human psychology

need analysis through texts, the vedas and the literature. It would be
a massive

new contribution (a thousand PhDs are waiting.)

So is my opinion.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
