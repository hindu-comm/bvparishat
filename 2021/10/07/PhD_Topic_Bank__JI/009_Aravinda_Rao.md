Dear Sir,

I agree that we need not give much importance and thus validate the arguments of the critics. In fact, I believe in the policy, 'if we want to make a line short,

draw a bigger line'. There is such a proverb in Telugu. However, our youngsters are getting affected by crafty and accusative statements of the

critics. Taking care of our young seems to be an issue now. For that the parents have to have knowledge of the fundamentals, and for this the scholars should

have the knowledge base prepared.

Regards,

Aravinda Rao
