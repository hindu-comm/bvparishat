Thanks for bringing this topic of Ph.D. Topic Bank.

  

My personal view on this is:

  

A simple rule is: " Choose a topic on which you are thoroughly motivated to do work" as if your life is worthless if you do not work on such a topic.

  

The reason I say this is: there is a similar analogy in the world of startups. Many people get attracted to start a company to make a lot of money. They see others doing it. Even though the success rate is :1 in 100 startups succeed, they just do it and choose some new idea to work on to start a company.

  

However, experienced people advise that:do a life plan first. that is what is the most valuable thing you want to achieve? and you will do this no matter anyone advises you not to. One more thing is to take care and make sure that a start-up life will not affect your family life or something which can be detrimental. Make sure you have the capability to work on this startup.

  

I think this advice applies for Research topics also.

  

Research is not a one-day or one-month affair. One needs a lot of perseverance to do a good job.
