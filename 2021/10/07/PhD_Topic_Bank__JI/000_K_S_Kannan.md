Choice of research topics is not always easy in the context of formal research.

It often depends upon the areas of focus and the propensities of the Guide

and the matching abilities and proclivities of the Research Scholar.

It also depends upon the awareness/familiarity on the part of both  

of the currently available literature, &/or current trends etc.

  

Generation of topics for research, even apart from the above context,

is not easily/always a matter of curiosity. It is often dictated by needs.

There often are situations when a scholar says to himself:

how I wish someone had researched on this !

Also, it is a desirable feature of a typical thesis to have at the end

an indication of what could not be covered within this research work,

and what related themes may be looked into for further development of the field etc.

  

Else than this, many scholars may often get ideas about

what research themes need to be worth pursuing - perhaps by someone else

as there are limits for one's own pursuits - by factors of time,  

competent assistants, or other resources.

  

All such issues which can be considered inportant/useful

as themes for research (or even writing books, and especially reference works)

should find a place in a Topic Bank, so that someone or the other may take it up,

pursue the matter and give it a fair trial.

  

One can also think of generating topics for research by means of

copying certain formats. A typical format has been  

" A Cultural Study of \<X>",

where X stands for a particular text worthy of study.

There will surely be scores of such formats which if pursued

can themselves give rise to many useful issues and themes fit for research.

  

If this enterprise can be useful, scholars may contribute their ideas to this thread.
