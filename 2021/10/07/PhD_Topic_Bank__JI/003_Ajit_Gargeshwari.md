I agree scholars and researchers need not be spoon fed. They should be given independence and freedom. Freedom to work with less of idea baggage from others and more ideas from their own own thinking, reading analysis and interpretation. Training on research and its methodologies
takes place during the doctorate course and subsequent tenure.

For independent researchers they are independent always
