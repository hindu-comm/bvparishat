Professors picking topics is that the way? Its the student who works with a professor who have mutual interest in a topic. Seeing a university or research institutions web site will usually give information about the faculty who work and what their areas of interests are. Of course if a student has an acceptable hypothesis a professor guides to the latest research and asks the student to consider.

  

One doesn't do research using google scholar or google but find supplementary information. Google scholar is primarily useful as a citation tool. One doesn't join a university to do research seeing a 'topic bank' but goes to university for which a candidate feels that university is good and scholars of that university work in areas that he or she has interest.
