Just to illustrate, I may suggest:

"A Study of the two works of Rama Sharana Shastri

viz. *Kaumudī-kathā-kallolinī* and *Vyākr̥ti-vatsarāja*

from the point of view of grammar".

  

Both are interesting works of a contemporary scholar,

and show his mastery of Sanskrit grammar and composition on the one hand,

and narrative abilities on the other.
