Namaskars,

One subject comes to my mind immediately.

For quite some time I have been requesting Sanskrit scholars to study the Sanskrit commentaries on the Devi Bhagavatam (Chandi paath)

and write on the symbolism of the differentstories therein. Speakers have been giving their own versions without reference to any commentator.

This topic is important because the detractors of Hinduism keep propagating that the Hindu gods and goddesses suck blood and kill

people. For instance, the story of Raktabija is symbolic. Raktabija symbolizes the latent vasanas in the mind of a sadhaka, which on finding a suitable ground,

sprout up again with full vigor like the demon in the story. The very word rakta, is from raaga, attachment. The whole story refers to vaasanaa-kshaya, which is needed by a seeker. I hope someone will do some authoritative study on this. Some background of Vedanta is essential for this.
