A few weeks ago, I saw a thread on this very forum with the title ‘NAMAMI manuscripts: BVP's collective representation?’ and starting with these lines …

*    “As with all sarkaari projects the NAMAMI has been sluggish in uploading digitised manuscripts under its care.*  

*   Can we as a group please reach a collective decision to remind the NAMAMI authorities to make the scholastic heirloom of this rāṣṭra collected by them    available to us all. After all that was the promise with which the manuscripts were procured from common people.*

*    I request the group moderators to please suggest a plan of action. I am ready to do anything for this as instructed by the moderators.”*  

  

Subsequently some discussion has happened on this proposal. But I am picking just one point of view from that discussion and presenting my view on the current proposal to institute a ‘PhD topic bank’.  

*   “Digitizing Manuscripts as a preservation strategy is different from making the assets in the form manuscripts which are held by various custodiansin public and private domain to be made available for a free downlead”. Why will anyone agree and why should anyone agree to such a preposition and one should not agree to such a preposition either. It will serve very limited purpose and who will bear the cost ?” - Ajit Gargeshwari*



Thousands of institutions will come forward to bear the cost for the purposes of creating and maintaining ‘PhD topic bank’. There is no issue for cost. But my question is, who will bear the possible damage? 

By damage, I mean the following …

· Expression of the topic may not always be precise when some one puts his thoughts on paper in few lines; it could be understood differently by the reader and interpret it differently from what the original idea was. It is always better the PhD student generates his own idea; or the student discusses the idea with the original idea creator for better understanding.

· Some not-so-matured authors may prowl on this ‘topic bank’ and create some misguiding, wrongly interpreted material on the topics in the bank. This act not only may divert the attention of the students, but also the topics lose their freshness/originality for further research.

· Originality in thinking by the researchers will be marred if this ready to pick ‘topic bank’ made available publicly.

· Scholar to scholar networking (idea exchange) gets dented by establishing this scholar to ‘topic bank’ channel.

· Who is going to be custodian of this ‘topic bank’? We keep hearing that some of the rare manuscripts are getting missed from public manuscript libraries across the country. God knows where those missing valuable manuscripts are landing and what is happening with them. What is the guaranty that top ideas in the ‘topic bank’ also would not have the same destiny?



According to me, the bottom line is …

In the field of mathematics, topic banks called ‘open problems’ are available. These open problems are quite challenging and unsolved problems for even centuries. They carry huge prize money also for solving them. **Iff**, we are talking about such topics, then the proposed ‘PhD topic bank’ is very much welcome.
