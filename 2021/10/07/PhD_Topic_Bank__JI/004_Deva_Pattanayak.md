Acharyas or professors have a list of topics which they pass on to their students. Some of these topics are important and the master already is very confident that further work will lead to important results worthy of a Ph.D. degree and equally important to newer topics of research. Another class of topics is one for which even the professor do not know how to proceed or even formulate. These topics are generally not picked by students who are not willing to spend their time on.

The issue with a topic bank is in its compilation which requires prodding through google scholar to find in which areas further research will lead to a good Ph.D. thesis. The benefit of such a topic bank for a student is to provide some help in finding the right university/research group to join.
