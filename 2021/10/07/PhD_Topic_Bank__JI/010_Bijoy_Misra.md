Dear Aravindaji,  

The new researchers get into the reactive argumentation mode . Some extremely sincere understanding/education mode

must happen at the senior levels to create the new cadre. It is the older people who may understand the material

well should go on public lecture tours that we abroad must sponsor. I am eagerly looking for some those

scholars who can create general public lectures on topics of worldwide interest.  We have initiated India Discovery  

Center Outreach lectures and are looking for scholars who can prepare classroom material that we can

distribute worldwide. You can contact me privately if you or somebody you know can prepare a good  

lecture for the international audience..We will support the scholar in preparing the slides if we agree on the

lecture..Polished skill of delivery/teaching style is also important.

What I see is a lot of disorganized monotonic lectures delivered to the sympathizers. We have to prepare  

the teaching material assuming that the audience does not know, but is eager to know. The audience is our  

own children. You can experiment in India by visiting High Schools.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
