By prodding through google scholar I meant actually going over the papers of interest. I wish it was there when I was a student.

The student may find another new topic as he/she gains further insight.

A Ph.D. Topic Bank is hard to find and good research topics are kept under cover until advances are made and submitted for publications and patents as appropriate.
