Dear Aravinda,

I understood the intention of Prof. Kanon. I am a Physicist turn engineer turn academic back to engineering executive and now back to basic science.

Throughout I felt it is very challenging to select a topic to work. While evaluating our projects the Vice President of GECorporate Research and development will ask us if we will invest in our proposed research. Later on I realized that unless we work on good topics of research we will fall behind our competitors and loose our market share.

A good set of topics for research is important. The outcome of research has to be important enough to spend tax payers money.

Regards

Deva
