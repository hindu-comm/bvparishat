Looks like KSRI, Chennai, subscribes to over a hundred academic periodicals.

  

If Indic Academy can enter into some agreement with them,

Contents Pages of these can be regularly posted on BVP as and when they appear,  

and documented in some permanent repository by IA.

  

If all back issues are covered, that will be a magnificent treasurehouse.
