I did see the database.

  

The point also is the ease of searchability etc.

Many authors/titles in the repository could not be accessed via

author's name, book name etc. Not a few problems requiring  

attention/amelioration. Misspelt words frustrate if not wreak havoc.

What is missing is sound and professional academic guidance/supervision.

  

It can always be argued that something is better than nothing.
