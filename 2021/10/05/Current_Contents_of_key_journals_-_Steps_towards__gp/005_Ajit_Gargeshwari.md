You are right the cost becomes astronomical to maintain a databaselike[WorldCat.org: The World's Largest Library Catalog](https://www.worldcat.org/)even if it means on a lower scale for all Sanskrit, Prakrit regionallanguages. All books and journals, conference proceedings and articles pertaining to India studies ever printed. It can never be achievedby scholars themselvescontributing to the database as i have already mentioned in my previous mail on differentthread. If we want to go further interested should discuss off line
