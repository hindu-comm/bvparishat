Please be requested to clarify the following point you have made, viz.,  
  
"The linga sharira will dissolve here itself in its mula karanam, the pancha bhutas/ para brahmanअत्रैवसमवनीयन्तेBr.up.3.2.11".  
  

The सूक्ष्म शरीर / लिङ्ग शरीर in its अपञ्चीकृत state is परलोक निर्वाहक and it is मोक्षपर्यन्त स्थायि It is said to be born or manifest due to the acquisition of 17 sheaths (सप्तदशावयवोपेत = 5+5+5+2), I recall here चित्रदीप of पञ्चदशी.   
  
Whenसूक्ष्म शरीर / लिङ्ग शरीर isपरलोक निर्वाहक andमोक्षपर्यन्त स्थायि how can it get "dissolved here itself"?

  
  
One more point - The स्थूल-शरीर is mere भोगावच्छेदक only. Whereas theसूक्ष्म शरीर / लिङ्ग शरीर is अनुभव-विषेशात्मक-भोग-साधन, On this count also,सूक्ष्म शरीर / लिङ्ग शरीर getting "dissolved here itself" appears not correct. Please clarify.  
  

Please also clarify #2 - There are two types ofसूक्ष्म शरीर / लिङ्ग शरीर - 1. हिरण्यगर्भ लिङ्गशरीरम् (महत्व) and 2. अस्मदादिलिङ्गशरीरम् (अहङ्कार). Which of the two will attain or remain asब्रह्मैव सन्ब्रह्माप्येति? I think it is the former, am I right?  
  

Thank you in advance for your clarification,  
  
Best regards,  
==========

For Advaitins, on the authority of this Brihadaranyaka mantra:



योऽकामो निष्काम आप्तकाम आत्मकामो*न तस्य प्राणा उत्क्रामन्ति**ब्रह्मैव सन्ब्रह्माप्येति* ॥ ६ ॥ 4.4.6



The jiva, sukshma/linga sharira, of the aparoksha jnani, upon the death of the body, will not leave the body to any other loka for acquiring another sthula sharira as there is no karma remaining for that jiva.
The linga sharira will dissolve here itself in its mula karanam, the pancha bhutas/ para brahman अत्रैवसमवनीयन्ते Br.up.3.2.11. Since the aparoksha jnanam has given him the realization that he is brahman, he remains as brahmanब्रह्मैव सन्ब्रह्माप्येति. This is videha kaivalyam.
