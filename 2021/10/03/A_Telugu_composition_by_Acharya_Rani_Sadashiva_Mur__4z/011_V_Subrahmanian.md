Namaste

  

What you have stated is correct and is applicable to jiva-s who have not acquired the aparokSha Jnana of their svarupa. They are samsarins and will transmigrate to other lokas and acquire bodies as per their karma.
But the question we are discussing is about an aparoksha jnani. In this case the sukshma sharira will no longer leave the body (utkranti) and transmigrate (gati) to another loka. The apaoksha jnana will destroy all his sanchita karma, the aagaami karma will not attach to him and only the prarabdha karma will be there which he will exhaust by bhoga.
After this bhoga, the body will die. It is here the shruti I cited applies: the sukhsma/ linga sharira will dissolve here itself (atraiva) in its mula karana. It has no purpose to serve any longer.

It is the latter that realizes its native Brahman nature and remains as Brahman. The Hiranyagarbha linga sharira will not dissolve or realize Brahman because that jiva, who is the head of the Hiranyagarbha/Brahma/Satya loka will remain there and only at the time of Mahapralaya when that loka too is resolved, he will also attain mukti along with those who are aparoksha jnanis in that loka, never to return to samsara. We are discussing the case of the second type above. The Brahman inब्रह्मैव सन्ब्रह्माप्येति is not chaturmukha/hiranyagarbha brahmaa but the Para Brahman.
