Namaste,

  

I would add Mysore Vedantam Shivarama Sastry who wrote Tattvapadas, as they are known in Kannada. His videha mukti was in 1910 at the age of about 48. There are many among the peasant folks who even today continue to carry on singing his songs and observing Sri Shankara Jayanti and his, Vedantam Shivarama Sastry's, aradhana. Great musician Dr. M Balamuralikrishna has rendered some of his songs and they are available here:<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaHOGyz9ML4>

  

regards..........yoga
