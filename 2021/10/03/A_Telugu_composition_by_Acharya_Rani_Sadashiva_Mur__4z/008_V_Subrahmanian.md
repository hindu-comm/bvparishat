For Advaitins, on the authority of this Brihadaranyaka mantra:

  

योऽकामो निष्काम आप्तकाम आत्मकामो*न तस्य प्राणा उत्क्रामन्ति**ब्रह्मैव सन्ब्रह्माप्येति* ॥ ६ ॥ 4.4.6

  

The jiva, sukshma/linga sharira, of the aparoksha jnani, upon the death of the body, will not leave the body to any other loka for acquiring another sthula sharira as there is no karma remaining for that jiva.
The linga sharira will dissolve here itself in its mula karanam, the pancha bhutas/ para brahman अत्रैवसमवनीयन्ते Br.up.3.2.11. Since the aparoksha jnanam has given him the realization that he is brahman, he remains as brahmanब्रह्मैव सन्ब्रह्माप्येति. This is videha kaivalyam.
