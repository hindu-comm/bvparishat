Thanks for sharing, Sri Subrahmanian -ji.

  

This genre of songs is called తత్త్వాలు , tattvaalu. Tattvam singular, tattvam plural.

  

Usually these songs are found sung by nonscholarly bairagi sadhus and rural Yoga and bhajan groups.

  

Most of these are Yoga sadhana related.

  

Mostly these are composed by Yogi-mystics.

  

"Bhakti movement" is well recognized in academics.

  

But "Yoga movement" needs recognition and discussion.

  

Most of these Yogi-mystics favour niraakara and talk against saakaara, favour jnaana and talk against karma, favour inward yoga saadhanaand talk against murti puja. Vairaagyais a significant theme and tunes used are intended to secure the mood of vairaagya.

  

But in course of time, a mixed tradition of Bhakti and Yoga movements developed.

  

Prof. Rani Sadasivamurtihas this mixed approach in it.

  

Such a colossal scholar taking up the composition of songs of a genre that is considered to be rustic is amazing.

  

The same Bhakti-Yoga mixed genre was enriched by such a great siddha as Sashivabrahmendrain Sanskrit.

  

The combination of scholarly rigor and bhaavukatva and poetic skill found in the kritis of Sadashivabrahmendra Swamiis reminded by this.
