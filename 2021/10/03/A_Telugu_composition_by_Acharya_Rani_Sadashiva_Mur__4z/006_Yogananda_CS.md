Namaste,

  

He was a realised soul by all accounts, testified by his deep works. The circumstances of his release from this world are as follows. He went to one of his peasant devotee's house, asked for curd rice, ate and told the devotees who were there that his time is over, went inside a room and closed the door. After a couple of hours when they went inside, he had taken off his upavita, clothes and had cast off his body. That made me use that phrase.

  

Regards. . . . Yoga
