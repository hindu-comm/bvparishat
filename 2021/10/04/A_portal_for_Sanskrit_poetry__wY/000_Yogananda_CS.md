Namaste,

  

I am happy to announce a portal for Samskrita poetry - [kavisamaya.org](http://kavisamaya.org).

  

Noticing numerous, high-quality poetry contributions on BVP mails and twitter, and many other SM platforms, Sriranga Digital created a portal Kavisamaya.org as a reservoirto such outpourings about a month ago. I had some initial discussions with Sri Kushagra ji and a couple of my friends in the beginning to put up a portal and test it out. I was extremely delighted to see contributions by Sri GSS Murthy who heard about it and registered, and that was the signal I was waiting to make an announcement.

  

I invite you all to visit, register if you would like to contributeyour poetry, and enjoy the offerings there. Suggestions are welcome.

  

regards.. . . . .yoga
