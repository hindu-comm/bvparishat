Namaste to everyone.

  

I havea few fundamental questions on language:

  

1\) Is there any research availablewhich links the 2 languages Tamil and Sanskrit?

  

2\) Did one borrow from the other, if so how much and what?

  

3\) When did jnana or knowledge take on the form of spoken language and written lipi and if we analyze lipi of Sanskrit (including earlier lipis from which Sanskrit came), Is there a way to connect these 2 languages.

  

4\) How can 2 languages Tamil and Sanskrit, both being so closely connected to Indian geography, have totally un-connected origin/nature/grammar, etc.?

  

5\) Which one seems to be earlier based on research?

6\) Did one originate from the other?

  

I have to be honest. I have less than zero knowledge of linguistics.

  

If these are too low-level questions, please suggest some simple papers or books which can help me understand and become familiar with this topic.
