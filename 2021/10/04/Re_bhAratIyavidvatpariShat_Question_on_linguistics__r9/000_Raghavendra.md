Please look at the "placental connection" between Tamil and Sanskrit,

  

अल्पाक्षरं असंदिग्धं सारवत्‌ विश्वतोमुखम्‌।

अस्तोभं अनवद्यं च सूत्रं सूत्रविदो विदुः॥

  

तोल्काप्पियं सूत्तीरम्,

  

शिल्वगै एलुत्तिन् शेयुट्टागि नुण्मैयोडु पुणर्न्द ओण्मैट्टागि

  

This Tamil verse is a perfect echo of the सूत्र-लक्षण given in the allied literature (पुराण) of the Vedas.

  

I am not a tamilian by tongue. If I have made a mistake transliterating the verse of Tolkaappiam, scholars well versed in Tamil are requested to correct it.

Greetings of the day,

  

Dr. B N K Sharma has written about the affinity that exist between Sanskrit and Tamil.

  

He has shown with copious examples how Tamil belonging to "sangam literature" is amenable to the grammatical rules of maharshi Panini.

  

I am at work now, I will send the PDF of it later,  
  
Thank you and Best regards,

Namaste to everyone.

  

I havea few fundamental questions on language:

  

1\) Is there any research availablewhich links the 2 languages Tamil and Sanskrit?

  

2\) Did one borrow from the other, if so how much and what?

  

3\) When did jnana or knowledge take on the form of spoken language and written lipi and if we analyze lipi of Sanskrit (including earlier lipis from which Sanskrit came), Is there a way to connect these 2 languages.

  

4\) How can 2 languages Tamil and Sanskrit, both being so closely connected to Indian geography, have totally un-connected origin/nature/grammar, etc.?

  

5\) Which one seems to be earlier based on research?

6\) Did one originate from the other?

  

I have to be honest. I have less than zero knowledge of linguistics.

  

If these are too low-level questions, please suggest some simple papers or books which can help me understand and become familiar with this topic.
