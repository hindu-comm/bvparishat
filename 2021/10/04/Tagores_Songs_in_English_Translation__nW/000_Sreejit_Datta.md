Namaskar,

  

In the seventh issue of this series, I translate two Bangla songs of Rabindranath that are closely associated with the processes of Sadhana: their inner and outward modes of practice, and the descriptions of the progressive stages of spiritual discovery with the help of deeply evocative poeticimagery. You can find them here: [Two Songs of Tagore â€“ VII - Swatantra Mag](https://swatantramag.com/two-songs-of-tagore-vii/)
