Respected list members,

  

Among the traditional Indian philosophies (Charvaka/Jaina/Bauddha/Tarkika/Advaita/Vishistadwaita/Dwaita), which one accepts/does-not-acceptइन्द्रियार्थसन्निकर्ष ?

  

(The reason I am interested to know this is that when we look at distant objects, if the Chakshurindriya has to travel to the object to know it, it contradicts the current scientific consensus that nothing can travel faster than light.)

  

Regards

Pradyumna
