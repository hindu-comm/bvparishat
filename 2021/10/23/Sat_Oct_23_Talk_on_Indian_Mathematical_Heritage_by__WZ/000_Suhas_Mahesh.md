This talk being hosted by the London Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan may be of interest to some of you. There will also be another talk by the same speaker on October 30, and its link will be circulated closer to the date.

  

**Title**: Indian Mathematical Heritage: A Broad Overview  

**When:** 7:30pm Sat 23 Oct 2021****

**About the Speaker**:

Dr K. Ramasubramanian is the Institute Chair Professor at the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Bombay. He holds a doctorate in theoretical physics, and is the world’s pre-eminent expert on India’s mathematical and astronomical heritage. His books and articles have brought to light the non-trivial mathematics produced by the Kerala school of mathematics in texts such as Ganita-Yukti-Bhasha, Karana-paddhati and Tantra-sangraha.

He is a recipient of the prestigious presidential award Maharshi Badarayan Vyas Samman (2008), and more recently, has been invited to give a distinguished lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians (2022) which, for mathematicians, is said to be equivalent to “induction to a hall of fame.”

The Shankaracharya of the Sringeri Sharada Peetham has also recognised his scholarship in Advaita Vedanta with the title “Vidvat Pravara.”
