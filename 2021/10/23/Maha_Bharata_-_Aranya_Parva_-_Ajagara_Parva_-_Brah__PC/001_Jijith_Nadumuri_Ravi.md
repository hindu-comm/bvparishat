Nāga Praṡna

  

Mahābhārata Vana Parva has several passages where Yudhiṣthira engages in conversations with various scholars. Among this his conversation with a Yakṣa (poetically rendered as Yama Dharma) is very famous but his conversation with a Nāga (poetically rendered as Nahuṣa, an ancestor of Yudhiṣthira) is not so famous.

  

Both Yakṣas and Nāgas followed divergent beliefs, cultures and traditions and keenly observed the dominant Vaidika Dharma with its evolving Cātur Varṇya. Hence, these conversations are extremely important in the study of our Dharma Samskṛtī which is a blend of diverse streams of philosophies.

  

In the later Purānic traditions the Buddhist and Jain thinkers are often depicted as Nāgas and Yakṣas. Hence if one speculate that these dialogs represent some of the ancient conversations between the three strands of Dharma in their proto state, it cannot be easily dismissed.

  

The Nāga who questioned Yudhiṣthira is portrayed as the ancestral king Nahuṣa, once the most powerful king of the pre Vedic ancient era, ancient even to the oldest Maṇḍalas of Ṛgveda. He dominated the then known world (which was then the region between Sarasvatī and Yamuna). Hence he was given the title of Indra then.

  

He was later dismissed as a mere Nāga because his prosperity blinded him and he insulted a Brāhmaṇa (Agastya).

  

Here Agastya is a Vedic Ṛṣi and hence the ‘Brāhmaṇa’ here denote profession as an intellectual and since Cāturvarṇya arose in the later Ṛgveda in 10th Maṇḍala.

  

Nāga’s first question to Yudhiṣthira is about Brāhmaṇa:-

  

“Who is a Brāhmaṇa?”

ब्राह्मणः को भवेद्?

  

Yudhiṣthira replied:-

  

“Truthfulness, charity, forgiveness, good conduct, lack of cruelty, self-control and compassion – in whom these can be seen, he O Nāga is a Brāhmaṇa, this is the Smṛti.

  

सत्यं दानं क्षमा शीलम् आनृशंस्यं दमो घृणा

दृश्यन्ते यत्र नागेन्द्र स ब्राह्मण इति स्मृतः

  

O Sarpa! He obtains knowledge of the supreme Brahman, which is beyond happiness and unhappiness, and on attaining which, there is no sorrow. What else will you say?”

  

वेद्यं सर्प परं ब्रह्म निर्दुःखम् असुखं च यत्

यत्र गत्वा न शोचन्ति भवतः किं विवक्षितम्?

  

Nāga asked again:-

  

“Truthfulness and knowledge of the Brahman can be found in all the four Varṇas. O Yudhiṣthira! Truthfulness, charity, lack of anger, lack of cruelty, non-violence and compassion can also be found among Ṡūdras too.

  

You have said that the object of knowledge is beyond happiness and unhappiness. But there is nothing that is free from either. I do not think such a thing exists.”

  

\[Note: There are two tracks here. In one track, the question of Varṇa based on birth vs Varṇa based on Guṇa-Karma is discussed. Yudhiṣthira and Kṛṣṇa are both on the side that Varṇa is based on Guṇa-Karma and not based on birth. The Nāga (representing the ancient proto Buddhist / Jain thought) too is on the side of Yudhiṣthira and Kṛṣṇa on this matter.

  

But the Nāga (Buddhist & Jain thought too) is not on the side of Yudhiṣthira and Kṛṣṇa on the concept of Brahman.\]

  

Yudhiṣthira replied:-

  

“If these traits, not even found in a Brāhmaṇa, are seen in a Ṡūdra, he is not a Ṡūdra A Brāhmaṇa in whom a Brāhmaṇa’s traits are not found, is a Ṡūdra. O Sarpa! It is said that one in whom these traits are found is a Brāhmaṇa. O Sarpa! One in whom these traits are not found, is marked as a Ṡūdra.

  

Then again, you have said that the object of knowledge does not exist, because there is nothing that is free from both those sentiments.

  

O Sarpa! It is your view that nothing can exist without those two. There is a state between cold and heat that is neither cold nor heat. Like that, there is something in between that is neither happiness, nor unhappiness. That is my view. O Sarpa! What do you think?"

  

Nāga replied:-

  

“If you assert that a Brāhmaṇa is known by his conduct, then birth has no meaning, as long as those characteristics can be seen."

  

Yudhiṣthira replied:-

  

"O Sarpa! I think that among men, birth is difficult to determine, because of mixed birth among all the Varṇas (संकरात् सर्ववर्णानां). Men always beget children on women from all Varṇas. All men are equal in speech, intercourse, birth and death (मैथुनम् अथो जन्म मरणं च समं).

  

The proof of this can be found in the words of the learned Ṛṣis (इदम् आर्षं प्रमाणं), who have said \`We sacrifice' (ये यजामह) and so on, basing this entirely on conduct. Conduct (ṡīlam) is thus more important (pradhāna) as per the learned (vidur) and those who see the Tatvas (tatvadarṣi).

  

The birth rituals of a man are performed even before the navel chord has been severed. At that time, the mother is Sāvitri and the father is Ācārya. Before initiation into knowledge of the Vedas, everyone is a Ṡūdra by conduct. When there is a difference of opinion on this, Svāyambhuva Manu has categorically stated the following:-

  

Manu’s Words: ‘Doing prescribed actions determines the Varṇa. If conduct cannot be seen, then the Saṃkara (the mixed Varṇas) are the strongest’.

  

‘कृतकृत्याः पुनर् वर्णा, यदि वृत्तं न विद्यते संकरस् तत्र बलवान् प्रसमीक्षितः '

  

I have earlier defined as a Brāhmaṇa one in whom the principles of good conduct are seen."

  

Yudhisthira’s reply points towards an older version of Manu Smṛti which has categorically defined the importance of conduct (Guṇa and Karma) in determining Varṇa and in the insignificance of birth in determining Varṇa.

  

This was the strong view expressed by both Yudhiṣthira and Kṛṣṇa regarding Dharma (though they both had divergent views on how to put Dharma into action in the fight against Adharma).

  

The Nāga (representing the proto Buddhist / Jain thought) finally agrees to Yudhiṣthira. This is poetically rendered as the Ṡāpa Mokṣha of the Nāga Nahuṣa and his freeing of Yudhiṣthira’s brother Bhīmasena.

  

The Nāga is satisfied by Yudhiṣthira’s position regarding Varṇa as not based on birth but only based on conduct, which is in agreement with the Buddhist / Jain thoughts which only opposed Varṇa based on birth.

  

But on the other thread of the conversation regarding Brahman, the Nāga has made no conclusion.

  

This is because the Buddhist / Jain thoughts are Nāstika Darṡanas and do not fully acknowledge the existence of Brahman. They believe everything emerged from emptiness.

  

But emptiness too is made of information, about which I talked in a different post.

  

Hence though seemingly divergent the Vedic, Bauddha and Jaina Dharmas have good convergence.
