In his article *Govindarāja*(Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute

Vol. 23, No. 1/4, 1942, pp. 30-54), K. V. Rangaswami Aiyangar writes: “Govindarāja’s *bhāṣya* has had a vogue which is not confined to readers of his own communion. His erudition, critical power, enabling to detect interpolations or wrong readings and unceremoniously reject them (as he has done with many chapters in the *Uttarakāṇḍa*), and mastery of previous commentaries have made him the *Rāmāyaṇa* commentator *par excellence* in South India.”

Is there a list of all chapters that are rejected by Govindarāja? I know he has said that *sarga*s 2 to 4 of the *Bālakāṇda* may have been composed by a disciple of Vālmīki in the name of Vālmīki (यद्वा सर्गत्रयमिदं केनचिद्वाल्मीकीशिष्येण रामायणनिवृत्त्यन्तरं निर्माय वैभवप्रकटनाय सङ्गमितम्, start of commentary of *sarga* 5) and he has categorically said that five *sarga*s in *Kiṣkindhākāṇḍa* to be interpolations (ततस्तदमृतास्वादमित्यारभ्य पञ्च सर्गाः प्रक्षिप्ताः सर्वकोषेष्वदर्शनात्तान् विनापि कथासंघट्टनात्पूर्वोक्तार्थविरोधस्फोरकत्वाच्च, तथापि ते व्याख्यास्यन्ते). I am looking for the list, if such a list has been compiled, of *sarga*s in the*Uttarakāṇḍa* that he has considered as interpolations.
