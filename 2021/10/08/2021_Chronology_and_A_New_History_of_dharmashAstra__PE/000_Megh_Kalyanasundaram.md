*Chronology and ‘A New History of Dharmaśāstra’: an analysis of the case of “rules for written contracts”*

  

**Abstract**: "Sixth in a series of recent papers that have engaged with one or the other aspect of various chronological postulations found in books that Indologist Patrick Olivelle has either himself written or has edited, this paper presents a pointed critical engagement with some of the contestable views related to the chronology of “rules for written contracts” in Gregory Schopen’s essay '*A Buddhist Monastic Code as a Source for Indian Law*', which is an essay included in the recent book '*Hindu Law: A New History of Dharmaśāstra*' published by Oxford University Press and edited by Olivelle and Donald R. Davis. Jr.."
