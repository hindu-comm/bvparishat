Namaste

  

This very popular verse is seen in a very wide variety of texts like puja vidhi, dhaana vidhi, etc. The oldest occurrence I could locate is the Agni Puranam, link below. Is there any other ancient authentic text where this verse occurs?  

  

हिरण्यगर्भगर्भस्थं हेमबीजं विभावसोः । 22ab 

अनन्तपुण्यफलदमतः शान्तिं प्रयच्छ मे ॥ 22cd
