Namaste to all scholars

  

I am looking for Sri Vedanta Desika's (1268â€“1369) recommendations on consumption of proper food.

  

"Taking cues from the Vedic scriptures, Vedanta Desika has provided a detailed catalogue of food which should be consumed to maintain a healthy mind and a disease-free life." (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedanta_Desika#Food_science>)  

  

As I don't know Tamil, I would be grateful if I could be directed to any English sources in this regard or if any information in English could be provided.

  

I would be thankful for any guidance or help in this matter.
