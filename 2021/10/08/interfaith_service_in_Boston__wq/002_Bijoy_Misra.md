Thank you, Aravindaji.

I had to integrate it as a part of the lecture for the world-wide christian telecast.

Good that you liked it.

We need more resources abroad.

My initial entry into Sanskrit was to help create Sanskrit recitation at Harvard commencement, still a dream!

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra
