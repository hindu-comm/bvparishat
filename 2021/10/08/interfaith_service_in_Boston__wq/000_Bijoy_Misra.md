Dear friends,

This may have some relevance for scholars here about how faith enters

public life abroad. Old South Church is an English church.
Christianity has many denominations, here they call Episcopal, somewhat liberal. Located in the heart of Boston, Old South Church is an iconic 18th century church

Once or twice a year they host interfaith service inviting other faiths for a  

cause-oriented worship service. Being deputed by Swami Sarvagatananda

of Ramakrishna Vedanta Society, I have been participating in these

since 1995. Last Sunday they hosted a service on Climate. I selected six stanzas from Atharva Veda भूमिसूक्त and offered them as a prayer along with  

my translation.

The video of the service is here

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
