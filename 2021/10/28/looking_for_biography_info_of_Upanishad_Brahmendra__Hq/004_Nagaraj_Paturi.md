He was born as Sivarama in 1747 to Sadasivam and Lakshmi who lived in the village of Brahmapuram situated on the banks of Palar river . For some time, he lived in Thanjavur . He was also an ardent devotee of Lord Ram and his speeches and music had impressed the young Thyagaraja who was around 10-12 years at that time.

He later settled down in Kanchipuram and established this Mutt at this place known as Agastya Ashrama. He is also supposed to have been visited by saint Thyagaraja in 1839 in this Mutt. The other great musician Sri Muthuswami Dikshitar is supposed to have visited this place in 1809 and it was during this time Sri Upanishad Brahman composed his Rama Ashtapathi.
