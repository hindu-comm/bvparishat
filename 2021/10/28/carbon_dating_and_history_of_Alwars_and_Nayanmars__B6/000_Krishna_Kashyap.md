Namaste,

  

is there any information of dating of Alwars and Nayanmars using carbon dating.

for example a friend suggested, what if one does carbon dating of the tamarind tree in Alwar tirunagari. They may find some information of date, which could relate to Nammalwar

  

Since the of Thirujnana sambandhar and Thirumanghai Alwar is accepted to be related, there may be a firm way of determining some chronology.
