What if the tree was already 500 years old when the saint was born? Also what is the solid evidence he sat under a tree or that it was the same tree? The bhakti saints are more or less known only thru poetry. I am not aware that poetry can be carbon dated!!!  

  

Thirumangai however has left a handful of references to contemporary episodes in his poetry, so he is datable. He lived during the time of the Pallava king Nandivarman II Pallavamallan. He i.e., Thirumangai, was definitely alive during or around the time of the consecration of the Vaikuntha Perumal temple in Kanchipuram, ca 770 CE thereabouts. You might want to look up the decad by Thirumangai dedicated to the *Parameccura viṇṇakaram* i.e., the Vaikuntha Perumal temple. It starts with 'collu vaṉcoṛporuḷ' etc. There are also two inscriptions of this time period which seem to refer to Thirumangai, one directly and the other indirectly.  

  

Hope this helps,
