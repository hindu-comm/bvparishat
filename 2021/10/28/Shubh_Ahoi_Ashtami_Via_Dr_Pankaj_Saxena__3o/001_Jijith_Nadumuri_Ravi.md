Many thanks for your email about **Ahoi Ashtami.**I fully concur with Dr Pankaj on this.  
This is what I wrote in his FB post 4 days ago on October 24th.  
  

Festivals celebrate seasons. What are seasons? Rtu. What is Rtu?. That which comes again and again taking turns - that is Rtu. Thus it derives from Rta - the cosmic order, also called Satya, the truth. Dharma too is derived from Rta the Cosmic Order. Thus Rtu and Rtu Utsava (Dharmic festivals ) are inseparably connected to Sanatana Dharma.

This Vedic wisdom is today lost!

This is also the reason why when we celebrate Uttarayana which happens today during December 21st is celebrated with an offseton January 14th / 15th it creates a **disharmony** and the **principle of Rta is violated**.

  

**All the festivals are connected to seasons (Rtu) and hence to Rta**. The seasons shift when the Vernal Equinox point shifts with a speed of around 1 degree in every 72 years. In our tradition at some period in our history, in the 1st millennium CE we got disconnected from this seasonal celebration of our festival when our calendarsno longer followed the slow shifting precession of equinoxes and solstices. Starting with the 1st millennium CE our ancient civilization lost its luster by coming under the control of invaders.

  

**Correcting this slippage** will help us to **reconnect with Rtu and Rta** and make Sanatana Dharma great again.
