I got these two Sanskrit teekas online

  

  

1.<https://archive.org/details/sri-sukta>

  

2.<https://archive.org/details/srisuktabhashyaofsriranganathamuni1937ocr>

  

I hope others may help in locating sayana bhashyam. In Rig-Veda sayana bhashya we may get it but seperate sayana bhashya i failed to locate it .

  

Sorry for inconvenience.
