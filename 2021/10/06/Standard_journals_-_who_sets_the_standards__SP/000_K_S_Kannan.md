**What journals are listed under** this set of publication platforms entitled :

Research Journals included in  

 **\*Scopus Index,  
**

** \*UGC Care List,  
**

** \*International or National Journals of High Impact Factor,**

(and which ones, as a corollary, are excluded)?

  

And is the list a standard/fixed one,  

or is it dynamic, and so can keep changing?

  

Is there a heavy/significant Western bias in regard to the source/origin/place of these journals?

Which is to say, is it the case that most of them (how many? what percentage)

issue from foreign lands, and hence can betray a covert or overt Western bias?

  

Are our young scholars being constrained by somehow catering to/abiding by  

the "tastes"/biases/blinkers of largely West-based journals (via even their "peer reviewers")?

  

The problem may not be felt as acute in respect of the fields of science and technology,

but may be scary/embarrassing in the case of arts/humanities/social sciences/allied fields.

  

Can somebody answer this?
