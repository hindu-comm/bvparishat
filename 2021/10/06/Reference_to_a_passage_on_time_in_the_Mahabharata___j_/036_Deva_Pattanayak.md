Any text that we read today is written by some one and as such contains concepts and ideas of others.

You are right to think that people such as the luminaries trio who wrote an authoritative book on gravitation have read the Mahabharata. Physicists like Einstein,Schrodinger and many others were influenced by these texts. It is only lately these texts of the yore like the Vedas, Upanishads, were given ‘dharmic’ tints and many extraneous elements were added.

I strongly believe that properly abbreviated texts books for school children should be written jointly by experts in this August body and scientists elsewhere.

It is important that these text books be free from religious fervour.

The concept that God has no form and shape as mentioned in Koran is very clearly mentioned in the Vedas and Upanishads. The complex concepts of the origin of the cosmos has been described clearly. The cyclic nature of the different states of the universe is very clearly mentioned. Today the greatest living mathematician and Physicist Dr. Penrose is developing a theory which goes by the name of conformal cyclic cosmology. According to this theory universe had no beginning and no end.

I am not suggesting that many in India are unaware of the ancient texts, but I am advocating for open scientific discussions of many still unknown topics such as how my mind is typing these alphabets. Clearly I have to admit a connection between my mind and the finer elements my body is made of.

It is time somebody writes new editions without the inclusion of many religious elements which were added later on to gain supremacy by few over many

I applaud his highness Dalai Lama when he says that he believes in science and will reject notions that are proved unscientific.
