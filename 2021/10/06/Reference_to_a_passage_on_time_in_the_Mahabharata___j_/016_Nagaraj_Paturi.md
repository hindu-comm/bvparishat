Dear Dr Steiner ,

  

Dr Sivasenani Nori (of course like Prof. Kannan and other learned scholars on thelist , some of whom have a long standing experience in textual research including manuscript research) is learned enough to know such basics as the mention of पाठांतर in the critical edition as part of the versions in the other sources considered while preparing the edition.

  

In his older posts on BVP, he expressed his considered and argued difference of opinion with the authenticity accorded to critical edition as the 'original version' of the original author of the text, from the perspective of a tradition-insider.

  

His present post is also a continuation of his expression of that approach.
