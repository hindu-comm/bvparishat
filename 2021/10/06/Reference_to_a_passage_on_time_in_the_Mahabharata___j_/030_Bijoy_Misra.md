Ajitji,

Lately I am writing my father's bio for Sahitya Academy in Delhi.

Some people track him backwards from his association with Subhash

Bose in 1939. Home sources give lunar dates.

I will possibly choose a "most likely" calendar date and not leave it vague.

So it will go in history, but इतिहास is the story of his life.

It is events versus dates.

Best regards,

BM

  

PS. My father Manmohan Misra was a poet and part of the freedom

struggle.
