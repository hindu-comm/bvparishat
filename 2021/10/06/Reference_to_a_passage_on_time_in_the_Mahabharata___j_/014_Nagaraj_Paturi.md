" Time is awake when all things sleep

कालः सुप्तेषु जागर्ति  

Time stands straight when all things fall

Time shuts in all and will not be shut

Is, was and shall be are Time's children

O Reasoning, be witness, be stable"

  

Only the first line in the quote is matching.

  

The translator from whom the author of the science book seems to have picked up the quote seems to have found some other Sanskrit verse in the पाठ of Mahabharata he /she translated.
