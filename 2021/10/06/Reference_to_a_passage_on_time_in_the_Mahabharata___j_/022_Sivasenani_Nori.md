First, let me pay my respects and express my gratitude to Prof. Paturi garu.

  

Second, to answer the questions of Sri Ajit Gargeshwari.

  

The purpose of any work is best explained by the author, which they have.

  

I can explain what I look for. For me, Mahabharata is not an impersonal historical work of curiosity, like say the Epic of Gilgamesh and the clay tablets on which it was written or the script in which it was written (I am hugely fascinated by these, no doubt). To me, Mahabharata is a Smriti and is a guide to my actions, taken together with other texts. In one word, it teaches Dharma.

  

After examining the critical edition, I came to the conclusion that the critical edition cannot be relied upon when this is the objective. The decisions to include or exclude a certain verse or reading were made on many bases, but Dharma was not one of them. In contradistinction, when a group of traditional scholars evaluate pAThabhedas in any grantha (say in Vakyapadiyam by Br. Sri Raghunath Sharma), conformity with Dharma and Sastra is always the primary basis. In fact if we look at the various parishads and sanghas of yore, this was the process (Pratisakhyas and all Sutra works record the final positions - siddhantas - of such interactions, along with opinions of dissent).

  

In the case of the critical edition of Mahabharata, a worthy parishad was assembled but the parishad's leader and the guiding spirit were not based on Dharma. Therefore their work cannot be accepted as Sistavyavahara,

  

The best single work which is an acceptable reference is the edition which Nilakantha commented. Sure, we can differ from the commentator (as was the case earlier in BVP with reference to the view of Bhima that samvatsara means a day in Sastra and therefore Pandavas' vanavasa can be done in 13 days), but it is a much better starting point than the critical edition. The Gita Press edition and the version translated by K M Ganguli also follow more or less the same edition.

  

That apart, if any respected person, say Madhvacharya in his Tatparyanirnaya, cites a text as being from Mahabharata, it is to be accepted as such.

  

Does Mahabharata need another critical edition? Yes and No. "Yes", because McCaulay's intellectual children have robbed many generations of Viveka. However this should be done by religious leaders, like say a Parishad of heads of various mutts suported by traditional scholars. Otherwise it will be like the National Calendar, used by none. "No", because we must teach a man to fish and not give him fish.

  

Dharma is very sukshma. It cannot be all laid out in black and white. All our Sastras exhort us to know the right course of action by observing the respected people, Sistas (यत्र कर्मविचिकित्सा वा वृत्तविचिकित्सा वा स्यात्... तैत्तिरीयम्, यद्यदाचरति श्रेष्ठः... गीता, पृषोदरादीनि यथोपदिष्टम्, पाणिनीयम्).

  

We need that education, the ability to discern right from wrong, rather than more un'critical' editions (for ignoring the fundamental purpose of a text makes an edition uncritical).

  

The one purpose that the critical edition serves very well is as a repository of pAThbhedas of any given verse, chapter etc.

  

Regards

Senani
