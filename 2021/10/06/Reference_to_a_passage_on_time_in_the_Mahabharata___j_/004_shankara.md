Namaste,

  

This is from Adiparva 1st chapter.

  

कालः सुप्तेषु जागर्ति कालो हि दुरतिक्रमः।  
कालः सर्वेषु भूतेषु चरत्यविधतः समः॥  
अतीतानागता भावा ये च वर्तन्ति सांप्रतम्।  
तान्कालनिर्मितान्बुद्ध्वा न संज्ञां हातुमर्हसि ॥ Mahabharata Kumbhakonam edn 1.1.275-6

  

regards  
shankara

It is interesting for me to find this reference to Vyasa , the Mahabharata, 400A.D. in a book on Gravitation by Misner,Thorne and Wheeler, 1973.  
I will be very grateful if one of the members of this group will be able to find the exact corresponding sloka in the Sanskrit Mahabharata.  
Thank you. With regards  
Deva
