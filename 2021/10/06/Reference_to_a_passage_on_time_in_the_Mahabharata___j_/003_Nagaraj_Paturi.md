The quote from Mahabharata is

  

" Time is awake when all things sleep

Time stands straight when all things fall

Time shuts in all and will not be shut

Is, was and shall be are Time's children

O Reasoning, be witness, be stable"

  

Under the quote, it is mentioned,

  

Vyasa, the Mahabharata (ca. AD 400)

  

Though the date mentioned can be disputed, the quote is very interesting.

  

Will check.
