Thank you for informing about your new book. A rough date doesn't mean incorrect traditions don't lie. The emphasis are different. I am not saying anything new here all I have written is well documented in printed books and articles lunar dates are not inaccurate if you have correct lunar dates it can be reconciled with Georgian dates or with Solar calender. Many puranas there are information about actual events and give factual information Your father date of birth have nothing got to do with what I have written.
