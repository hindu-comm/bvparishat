The word Itihaasa being used as a regional Indian language equivalent for history is a modern time development.

  

This is one of the reasons why some modern time Indian scholars treated as ancient Sanskrit texts treated as itihaasa as texts providing history.

  

Another source of confusion is the view towards certain narratives as accounts of actual past events.

  

Both itihaasasand puranas are viewed as accounts actual past events by the devout Hindus.

  

But history is a modern discipline with enlightenment age spirit which includes questioning the faith of the faithful. There is an active thread on BVP where Prof. Bronkhorst'spitching history against tradition as part of his upholding of enlightenment spirit is being discussed among other things.

  

No historian who considers himself/herself professional in the field agrees any entire itihaasa to be a book providing history. He/she considers that itihaasa may contain a few events that can have some elements of historical factuality, i.e., events or theirelements that can be proved as facts as per the method of the discipline of history.

  

If we can have a category called ' views towards events as events of the past' , 'history' and 'itihaasa' can form sub-categories of it. i.e., 'history' and 'itihaasa' are two totally different views towards
events as events of the past.
