A text that has been published with an editor's extensive annotations,commenting on variations between different versions of the text (manuscripts, drafts, editions),and that provides an understanding of the text based on other sources.Critical editions require collation of the different manuscript witnesses, and the construction of a reading text out of the results of that collation. Most critical editions use abase manuscript, whose readings they accept except where there is reason not to do so, but some are more eclectic than others. Critical editions encourage readers to think about the work, more than about its specific manuscript presentation, and may well be more informative on such topics as the work's sources, historical context, form, style, and other literary matters.

  

"any literal analysis is meaningless, one has to soak in the gist and the teachings

as much one can. Epics teach values, they don't represent history."

  

All literary analysis has its usefulness. Epics do representhistory atleast in some parts if historycan be defined; they are not mere moral stories. The focus of epics is to propound dharma as vedas are not easily accessibleto all and is more difficult to understandwithout training

Who says it's only young researchers who create their "historical" discoveries. Many parts and sections of all epics are historical. Even old and vetranresearchers see history in mahabharata and epics. Puranas are called Ithihasika Granthas
