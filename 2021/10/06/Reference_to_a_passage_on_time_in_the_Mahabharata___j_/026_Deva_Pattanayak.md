Together, these five lines makes sense. Will be interesting their renderings in Sanskrit.

As you know time and space are used to explain gravitation. Presence of mass changes the curvature of space and time and the analogy is that massive objects simply following the curved path giving the perception of fall. So the second line may be describing motion of earth, moon and sun.

I am using google to search. Is there a searchable text of the Mahabharata?

Deva
