Ajitji,

We do differ how to interpret a calendar date. In our India Discovery Center work, we do state that all dates without physical records  

are approximate. We don't research why and how a date is "printed." I hosted a lecture by Professor Ashok Aklujkar five years ago

where he showed evidence why the "accepted date" for King Ashoka's edicts could be wrong. Physical trail and better carbon-dating  

may help resolve some of these.  

We are digressing from the epics. This is my last mail in this thread.

Regards,

BM
