"In his older posts on BVP, he expressed his considered and argued difference of opinion with the authenticity accorded to critical edition as the 'original version' of the original author of the text, from the perspective of a tradition-insider. "

  

To whom is the critical edition for. Is it for tradition-insider or tradition-outsider if there is a difference.

Can you please elaborate and explain for my befit the relevance, utility need worth and acceptable emendation if when how can it be arrived at for a critical edition. Does Mahabharata need another critical edition? Dr. Sukthankar has given his methodology is his methodology questioned or the judgment of the editor is disputed or judgement to accept or reject manuscripts questioned.
