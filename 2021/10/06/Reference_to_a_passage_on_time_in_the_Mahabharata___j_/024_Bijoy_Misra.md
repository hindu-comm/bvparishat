I have spent considerable time myself in debating this issue.

There is one extra point I want to add to Prof Paturi's list.

  

9. The critical edition assumes that the text has one author and was created at a particular instant in time.

 This is how the scholars reconstitute Bible and other historical texts. This assumption forgets that the

  most of the compositions could be oral and retained only orally for a long time. Prof Paturi does allude  

 this in his #4.

  

The danger is that the texts get translated and young researchers jump into these translations to create  

their "historical" discoveries.

  

I had seen a Ramayana text that gave variations in all recensions together. This is more appropriate, I think.  

Then as Prof Nori says, any literal analysis is meaningless, one has to soak in the gist and the teachings

as much one can. Epics teach values, they don't represent history.
