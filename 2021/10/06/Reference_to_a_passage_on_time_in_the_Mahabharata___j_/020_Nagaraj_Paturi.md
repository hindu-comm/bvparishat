Dear Sri Ajit-ji,

  

Since you asked me to help you for your benefit :

  

1\. The stand taken is against the preparation of critical editions.

  

2\. The field of preparation of critical editions is part of a broader field of history, a sub-field of that namely history of the manuscript - proliferation of a text for which multiple manuscripts are found at the time of research. It aims at reconstructing the earliest documented version of the text from which the later and later 'copies' of the text are created. It has an underlying assumption that portions of the text get added, removed or modified during the later and later 'copyings' from the previous ' copies'. If the text does not have multiple manuscripts, or if the multiple manuscripts do not have differences in any portion, there is no need for a critical edition.

  

3\. The assumption that the version so reconstructed is the 'authentic version' and all the other versions outside this reconstructed one are interpolations is what is being debated here.

  

4\. One of the methodological weaknesses behind such an assumption of 'authentic original version of thetext' is not takinginto account the oral transmission of the whole or parts of the original text. The possibility of later manuscripts committing the orally transmitted versions of the whole or portions of the text is not taken into account.

  

5\. The specific point that Dr Sivasenani Nori was focusing on was the impact this view has on the attitude of authenticity or lack of it that is shown towards the version chosen for commenting by a premodern commentator of the work. If the version or portion chosen for commenting by the commentator is not found in the critical edition, it leads to an impression that the commentator is commenting on unauthentic versions or portions of the text.

  

6\. Here comes another significant aspect that brings in the question of tradition-insider's perspective. For the tradition insider, significance should be given to the original spirit of the original text, not to the assumed original letters of the original of the written form proliferations. For the tradition insider, the authority that can decide the original spirit and through that the authentic original text includes the commentators belonging to the tradition to which the text belongs.

7\. For such a tradition-insider , the Critical Edition is just an interesting reconstruction of the earliest possible version of the written text that can possibly be reached through the methods of the history of written version proliferation of a text, not the authentic original version of the text.

8\. That is why, when a spirit-wise significant portion or version of a text is shown as the alternate version in the Critical Edition, the tradition-insider attributes the problem to the philosophy of taking the Critical Edition as the authentic original.
