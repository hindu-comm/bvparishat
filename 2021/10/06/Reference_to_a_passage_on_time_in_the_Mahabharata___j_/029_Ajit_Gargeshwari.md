Thank you Bijoy Ji for this information.इतिहास;as used in Sanskrit Hindi or Kannada is not history or events in history. Then what is history? Maybe I should go back to a dictionary to search for a suitable English word as used in common parlance.

  

इतिहासवह शास्त्र, जिसमें इतिहास की घटनाओं आदि का अध्ययन किया जाता है

  

इतिहास; itihāsa are traditional accounts of past events usually refers to the collection of written descriptions of important events .तिहआस, which means "so indeed it was".



Historians discuss "several lineages of the early tradition" with archaeological evidence (e.g., with Painted Grey Ware or Chalcolithic Black and Red Ware), understanding the Puranic genealogies as "Records of a general pattern of settlements and migrations", rather than "factual information on history and chronology".

  

Recent scholarship has with success, use the Puranas for historical information in combination with independent corroborating evidence, such as "epigraphy, archaeology,



Ancient Indian historical tradition written by Pargiter according to which A story is considered to be itihasa only when the author of the story has himself witnessed or is part of the story. Vyasa, who wrote the Mahabharata, is himself a character in the story. Similarly, Valmiki, who wrote the Ramayana, was also a character in the story.

  

Time is cyclic and not linear is clear fromइतिहास;. ( to answertimestamps)

  

Puranic literature is encyclopedic in nature and includes itihasa and does includes elements of scientific literature
