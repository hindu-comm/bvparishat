Dear Mr. Jijith,

  

Thanks for the clarification.

Since I am busy with my manuscript, I am not able to write in detail.

Whatever I have writtenin this thread is given in detail in my blogs - the links given earlier.

The 13th tithi amavasya heralded the concept of Bodhayana amavasya. That is expressed in a storyform for ages and found in the Jyothisha texts in Tamil (attached). Written in my book and in my blog also.

Tithi is different from a day.

The moon's recovery went on for sometime. Mahabharata gives evidence for anomalous movement till the 69th day after the crash. After that we have no textual record.

Only scientistslike Dr. Seifert will elaborate on it, based on the proxies as was done for the Canterbury event.

This is not the first time such an event hadhappened.

25 such events on the earth with a few on themoon too, have happened so far in the Holocene.

I go with the view of the experts on meteor studies.

The bottom-line is the crash has happened.

  

My papergenerated a lot of responses from [academia.edu](http://academia.edu) on the probable sites in Europe that match with the Biblical Flood date given by Dr. Hales.

You will read them in my book.

  

For the rest of the topics, epigraphy and the continuing use of Kali Yuga by the Hindus cannot be set aside in any dating work on the Indic past.

  

PS. Even the Ketu-sthala in Keezha Perum Pallamis a meteor-hit site. How many people know of this?

The probable date of the crash is 7th century CE which was recorded in a Chinese chronicle.

The temple was built in the 10th century.

Since I could not find textual evidence from thelocalarea, they have just kept it at bay. This is like looking for primary evidence inthe concerned site.

I am saying this to convey that the meteor experts follow a protocol for identifying a meteor crash.

Foremost is the historical mention or documentation in some form.

Mahabharataoffers an excellent documentation and even authenticates some of the derivations made from other crashes.



Regards,

Jayasree
