The Hastinapura Meteor Event is really intriguing, and if it did happen and gave the Earth a jolt, then so much of the data about aberrant sightings would have a powerful explanation.

  

Where else can one one find corroborationfor a meteorstrike in that period, because a Google search gives statistical probabilities but not specific dates.
