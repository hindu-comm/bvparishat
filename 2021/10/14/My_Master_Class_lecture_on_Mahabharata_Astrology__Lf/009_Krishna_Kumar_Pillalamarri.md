Dear Dr. Jayasree Saranathan,

  

Thank you for a patient reply. I agree I am not as knowledgeable as you, but the difference in the year count of 35 years by you and 36 by Pandit Kota Venkatachelambetween Krodhi and Pramati years is perhaps due to the fact that in Indian counting systems we use 1 as the starting point instead of 0 as westerners do. I am not saying you are wrong; on the contrary. I am trying to explain to myself with other logic on why there would be a difference at all between you and Sri Venkatachelam, and wondered perhaps this is one aspect that might be considered. When people mention their age in Indian terms, they may say 45, whereas in the western system of the same person counting his age, he might say 44. The mapping to Gregorian calendar might have introduced an additional year's error, I agree.

  

Best Regards,  
  
Krishna
