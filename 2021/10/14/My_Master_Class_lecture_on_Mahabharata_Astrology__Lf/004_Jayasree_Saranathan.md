Thanks Mr. Krishna for the congratulatory message.

  

Pandit Kota Venkatachelam's contribution to the decipherment of the year of the Mahabharata war is immense and laudable.

  

However the year of the Mahabharata war was not 3138 BCE but 3136 BCE.

Thedifferenceof 2 years is due to thefollowing:

1\. He assumes that there was a 36 year gap betweenthe war and the year of Krishna's departure. It was 35 only as per the Mahabharata text. There are four verses referring to Krishna's exit in the 36th year, by which we understand that the gap was 35 years. It was Krodhi, 35 years before Pramathi, when the Kali Yuga began.

2\. He has quoted the Julian date for Kali Yuga in his works which turns out to be 3102 BCE. Since Kali Yuga began 3179 yearsbefore the
Shalivahana Shaka, the year was 3101 BCE, which we use as the base year in deciphering inscriptions. This is the year in the Gregorian calendar too, that we use today. I am suggesting this correctionas one amonga few rectifications to be done, in my upcoming book validating 3136 BCE as the year of the Mahabharata war.

  

Regards,

Jayasree
