Namaste Dr. RameshRao,

  

There is more data in supportof the -3136 event. These are available in GISP2 graphs that people have been working on. Maybe it will take time for someone to enter them in the wiki article. The graph I have shown is based on many inputs including the data on 14-C and 10-Be spikes in that year. This particular Hastinapura event is going to be given in his upcoming paper, which is likelyto be his 8th paper in a serieson climatepatterns in the Holocene. You can read his 7th paper here where he has worked on the Canterbury event that caused a disturbance to the earth-moon systemand how the earth regained its position.[(PDF) CLIMATE PATTERN RECOGNITION IN THE LATE-TO-END HOLOCENE (550 AD TO 1650 AD, PART 7) (researchgate.net)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317956442_CLIMATE_PATTERN_RECOGNITION_IN_THE_LATE-TO-END_HOLOCENE_550_AD_TO_1650_AD_PART_7)

  

His 3rd paper quoted by me in my paper to the Academia Letters can be read here: [(PDF) Climate Pattern Recognition in the Mid-Holocene (4800 BC to 2800 BC, Part 3). (researchgate.net)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277589054_Climate_Pattern_Recognition_in_the_Mid-Holocene_4800_BC_to_2800_BC_Part_3). The scientific markers point to 3136 BCE and now the Mahabharata events offer the historical evidence for thatevent.

  

We may be close to identifying that comet, going by this NASA article published recently on the parent comet of ATLAS that was supposed to have broken into pieces during its previous sojourn around the sun 5000 years ago.[Comet Atlas May Have Been a Blast From the Past \| NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/comet-atlas-may-have-been-a-blast-from-the-past). When I contacted Dr. Quanzhi Ye, the corresponding author of the paper, he confirmed that the parent comet had broken near the orbit of Mercury but left the solar system. His paper here:[Disintegration of Long-period Comet C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS). I. Hubble Space Telescope Observations - IOPscience](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/abfec3)

  

It is plausible that the broken parts had headed towards the earth and the moon and rained on them over 13 days, starting from the day Krishna left Upaplavya on a peace mission. I am producing more evidence in my upcoming book, though some of it is already written here:[Jayasree Saranathan: Evidence of the comet-hit of 3136 BCE from Sindhu kingdom (Mohenjo-Daro) to the Alps. (Part 15: Mahabharata date)](https://jayasreesaranathan.blogspot.com/2021/01/evidence-of-comet-hit-of-3136-bce-from.html)

On the first day, a major hit was taken by the Lower Town of Mohenjo-daro. Attached a pic from Hemphil's paper, to show theoddity of the four sites falling in the same line. More in my book.

  

Regards,

Jayasree
