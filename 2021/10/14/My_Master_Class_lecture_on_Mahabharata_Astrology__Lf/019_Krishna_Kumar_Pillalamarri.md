Dear Sri Nagabhushana Rao garu,

  

There is an obvious variation in the dating of the Mahabharata war between Sri Nadimpalli Jagannatha Rao and Smt Jayasree Saranathan and Sri Kota Venkatachalam. What I mean is that he is at variance from these two. And such details are what I would like to resolve, if not for others, for myself. So please do share the Telugu versions of Sri Kota Venkatachalam Gary’s books. From what I read, I am even more concerned that there is no agreement among scholars on how to deal with zero year (or year 1).

  

Regards,

  

Krishna Kumar Pillalamarri
