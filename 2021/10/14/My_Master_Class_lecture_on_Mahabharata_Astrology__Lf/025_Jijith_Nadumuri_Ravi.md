Dear Dr Jayasree ji

  

I go by your wordthat you have independently developed the idea of atmospheric aberrationsto explain Arundhati-Vasistha etc.

In my searches so far, I got a trail of communicating this to Dr Manish Pandit ji but not to you.

  

But you mentioned Dr Koeanraad Elst. Since yourcommentscreate confusion among the readers of this group, I need to clarify my stand.

  

My support and opposition to every individualresearcher including Nilesh is not personal, only issue based support or opposition. Thus, I may support a particularidea of a researcher, all the while opposing another idea of the same researcher. I don't extrapolate any opposition to just one of the ideas of a researcher, into rejecting the researcher as a whole, or into rejecting all of his / her good ideas which are reasonableor endorsable. I also don't do the reverse:- because one idea of a researcher is good, I don't automatically assume all of his / her ideas are good or reasonable or endorsable.

  

In my searches, I encountered the email you mentioned regarding Dr Koeanraad Elst.

**  
**

**The subject of that email was not at all Sri Rama**.

  

My previous email to you in this thread itselfmakes it amply clear that **I consider Rama as a historic personality**.

  

Of Course I don't accept those dates, which in my view, are the exaggerated dates of Rama such as those placeRama at 12008 BCE or 5114 BCE. But, that is based on solid data that i described in my previous mail (Rama Jataka rejected by Valmiki Ramayana Critical edition by observing that it is later addition, the presence of Rama in 10th Mandala Rgvedaalong with Samtanu as contemporaries, the generation gap between Samtanu and Parikshit which is around 120 years and so many other reasons).

  

Dr Elst was one of the most vocal researchers who **argued with solid evidence for the Sri Rama temple at Ayodhya.** When the entire leftist ecosystem with all the Indian newspapers aligned on the opposite side, by saying that there is no evidence for Sri Rama temple at Ayodhya and that whatever evidence got from Ayodhya was planted by the Sangh Parivar / Karsevaks, he was one oftheresearchers who stood againstthat collective lie!!  
  
Here are the two strong books Dr Elst has authored in support of Sri Rama's Temple at Ayodhya:-

  

1

**AYODHYA:The Case Against the Temple.** 2002. -Koenraad Elst,Voice of India, New Delhi  

<http://voiceofdharma.org/books/acat/>  
In this book he collects all evidences for the Ram Temple at Ayodhya and criticizeshistorians like Irfan Habib and the newspapers for falsifying evidence

  

2

**Ayodhya And After: Issues Before Hindu Society, Koenraad Elst. 1991**  

<http://voiceofdharma.org/books/ayodhya/>

Some extracts from the forward of this book:-

The Ayodhya movement, which wants to reintegrate the sacred place of Ram Janmabhoomi into the living Hindu tradition by building a Mandir on it, is at the same time an invitation to the Muslim Indians to reintegrate themselves into the society and the culture from which their ancestors were cut off by fanatical rulers and their thought police, the theologians. It is thus an exercise in national integration.While Islamic resurgence may pose a physical threat to Hindu society, the deeper challenge and the sharpest disdain are coming from the Left-leaning westernized (short : Nehruvian) establishment... [read on](http://voiceofdharma.org/books/acat/for.htm)  
  
An early writing of Dr Elst arguing for Ram Janmabhumi, whose link i can't find in quick search is mentioned below:-  

**Ram Janmabhoomi vs Babri Masjid, a Case Study in Hindu-Muslim Conflict. Dr Elst, Koenraad. 1990**

I don't know how a person who wrote all this can deny the historical existence of Rama?

Leaving this aside, when I look at your **Asteroidimpact basedEarth-Moon disturbance theory (1)** and your older**simpleatmospheric disturbance theory (2)** (which I too independently developed in my writings since 2017), I prefer to go with (2) atmosphericdisturbance theory. But you seem to have abandonedtheory 2 and are leaning more on theory 1.

  

Even if **theory 1** is true, it will be difficult to convince the global research community to accept it because it involves huge investigations into the after-effects of such an impact in 3136 BCE. You are also not clear if the impact occurred on the Moon or Earth. If yes, do specify. If it occurred on the moon, which is the correspondingimpact crater on the Moon? If it was on Earth, which is the correspondingimpact crater on the Earth? This event will not just make the moon lose a tithi and have its half-orbit reduced to 13 days, but it will cause many geological, seismic, climatological and tidal activities on Earth and will affect the normal life of people,even death due to the fury of nature. Terrible loss of life due to geological shocks cannot be ruled out. Did any of that happen in 3136 BCE whichis youryear for the 18 day war?

  

Mahabharata does not mention any Tsunami or huge loss of life due to Earthquake during the 18 days of the War. But interestingly, huge loss of life occurred in the 18 War itself! But Mahabharata does mention Tsunami-like events in Dwaraka, but it is in the 36th / 35th years after the 18 day war. Finally, how did the moon magically regain its original orbital period? Ideally if the moon's half orbit period is reduced to 13 days due to impacts, it ought to continue like this for years unless another equal and opposite impact miraculously corrects it, or it get corrected when the Earth-Moon system re-established another equilibrium in which the Moon's orbit period magically regained the the precise original state. These are my genuine concerns about this theory 1 and I am not getting a clear answer for this.

  

If there is a shift in the orientation of Earth we will see all the stars, planets in the celestialsky shifted, like how when an airplane changes its orientation we see everything seen through its window shifting orientation. Change in the orientation of Earth is a global event affecting the terrestrial sky as a whole. How can it affect few local stars like Arundhati-Vasistha?

  

If you are talking about the parallax effect, the distance from Earth to Arundhati (Alcor) and Vasitha (Mizar) is 80 light years. Their angular gap is 12' (12 minutes). The distance between them is around 17800 AU. Diameter of Earth is 12742 km. The length of Earth's orbital ellipse (major-axis) is 2 AU = 29,91,95,741.4 km. Compared to the distance from Earth to Arundhati-Vasistha (80 LY), their separation (17800 AU) is miniscule. Both the diameter of Earth (12742 km)and the length (major-axis) (2 AU) of its orbit is negligible compared to the distance from Earth to Arundhati-Vasistha (80 LY). Hence the parallax effects on Arundhati Vasistha due to anything happening on Earth-Moon system or solar system is negligible, not good enough to shift the relative position of Arundhati with respect to Vasistha.

**Theory 2** can be caused by **small, normal meteors** entering into Earth's atmosphere causing **atmospheric refractive index aberrations**, red glows etc. In fact it can explain almost every anomaly that Vyasa lists out to Dhritarashtra. Since this is a mere small sized meteor event (a dozen or dozens of shooting stars for example) it will not require to challenge the entire global scientific community to convince that such meteor showers did occur close to the 18 day Kurukshetra War (whenever it occurred, of course).

  

Here I remember an advice I gave to Dr Vedaveer Arya ji when he come up with the **Chronology Revision**which proposed to modify the date of Buddha Nirvana advancing it from 483 BCE to 1865 BCE, thereby advancingthe date of Mahapadma Nanda and Chandragupta Mourya into the past so as to support his Kurukshetra War date of 3162 BCE. This shift is required because the **gap between Parikshit and Mahapadma Nanda is only 1015 years as per Vishnu Purana** (1050 year as per Vayu Purana) and 1500 as per one version of Matsya Purana). His objective was noble. But when he mentioned to me that this will also require the revision of the entire world chronology - the chronology of the Greeks, all European chronologies, the revision of the date of Jesus and Muhammad, the Chinese and Mongolian chronologies etc, I said the same thing to him:- this is an uphill task and even if his chronology revision theory is true, the matter will not be settled by the world wide chronologist researchers even in a decade. 

  

Science demands that whenever two explanationsare possible to solve a scientific puzzle, you need to **select the simplest one**, not the complex one.

  

I am nobody to criticize you and I have no interest in opposing your developing theory. But, this is my final word to you as a well wisher.

Jijith
