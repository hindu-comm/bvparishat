Congratulations Jayasree ji for the new findings.

  

However I draw your attention to JHora Creator PVR Narasimha Rao who said using Surya Siddhanta for Mahabharata Dates is not very sound. Kindly also check the paper of Dr Ashok Bhatnagar. He has studied the Equinox Solstice position with respect to the Nakshatras during the period of Kurukshetra War. Based on this he has produced upper and lower limit dates for the occurrenceof Kurukshetra War which is very interesting.

I am also interested to know how many scientists agree that there is no continuousprecession for the planet Earth? Every planet does precession due to the acquired angular momentum when they coalescefrom gas clouds that spin like whirlpools in the water turning into planets. How can they give up this precession?

  

Even if some pendular swing motion due to the motions of the sun around the galaxy is superimposed onto the precisionmotion of the planet (in this case Planet Earth) the precession component still has to be there. What has your collaborator scientist has to say about it?

  

I am also interested to know about this Hastinapura event. Is it recorded in geological or meteorological records which I can examine?

  

Regards

Jijith
