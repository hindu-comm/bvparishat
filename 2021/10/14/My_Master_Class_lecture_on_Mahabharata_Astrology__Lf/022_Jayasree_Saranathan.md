Dear Mr. Jijith,

  

Thanks for takingtime to watch my lecture.

  

At the outset I would like to state that there is far more scientificresearch taking place in too many fields than what we deal within our circle.

  

# This earth- moon systemdisturbance has already been detected in other events. In Hastinapura, the earth regained its orientationin 2 days, in the Burckel event in 2 weeks - all these are deduced on the basis of paleo-climatic proxies by scientists.

  

# For what happened withthemoon, we have to go by what is stated in the Mahabharata. If you have read my 2019 book, or my blogs of 2020 Dec- 2021 Jan, you would know where that is traceable.

  

# Not the first time we come across a disturbance to the moon in the Hindu- Vedic texts. In Raivata manvantara, the fall of Revati by the kick of the sage Rtavak and the subsequent return to the original path by the moon is suggestiveof a simultaneous cosmic hit on the earth-moon in a distant past, by which we cometo know that the early society had noticed a change in the path of the moon and a return to the path in course of time. I did a video in my series on Indic Past.

# I want to clarify that we have not done any talk or programme together and I was the first one to have talked about the atmospheric refraction theory fordescribing Arundhati observation in my 2019 ebook critiquing Mr. Oak's Mahabharata. Can be read here:

[(1) (PDF) Myth of 'The Epoch of Arundhati' of Nilesh Nilkanth Oak \| Dr. Jayasree Saranathan - Academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/44757153/Myth_of_The_Epoch_of_Arundhati_of_Nilesh_Nilkanth_Oak)  

  

That theory is based on the after-effect of the meteor crash.

That refraction theory was based on the negative refraction which is IMPOSSIBLE in Nature.

I reasoned out that the plasma trail or the extreme heat conditions at the time of crash of the extra-terrestrial object caused a momentary deviation in the refractive index at which time the anomalousappearanceswere seen.

I produced maps with the help of my son in his simulator. For a quick go-through, you can check this[Jayasree Saranathan: Arundhati (Alcor) shifted position, so did Dhruva (Polaris) (Part 14: Mahabharata date)](https://jayasreesaranathan.blogspot.com/2021/01/arundhati-alcor-shifted-position-so-did.html)

  

Now after my interaction with Dr. Seifert, I came to know that momentary rocking of the earth can cause such appearances of thecelestial sphere momentarily. The canterbury event was one such instance which he had described in his paper here: Page 5 and 6[(PDF) CLIMATE PATTERN RECOGNITION IN THE LATE-TO-END HOLOCENE (550 AD TO 1650 AD, PART 7) (researchgate.net)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317956442_CLIMATE_PATTERN_RECOGNITION_IN_THE_LATE-TO-END_HOLOCENE_550_AD_TO_1650_AD_PART_7)

If you interact with meteor-experts you will know more.  

  

# After my discussion with him on the nature of 75+ nimittas given by Vyasa to Dritharashtra and 20+ by Karna to Krishna, I could get scientificreason for each and every one of them - all related to the entry of a space object through the atmosphere and crash- landing-
which you will read my upcoming book on validating the year of Mahabharata (3136 BCE). You are welcome to critique it.

  

# On the Yuga issue, the 5 year yuga calendar is decipherableand done by me in my 2019 book and also posted in my blog[Jayasree Saranathan: Deducing the beginning of the 5-year Yuga period in Mahabharata. (Part 3: Mahabharata date)](https://jayasreesaranathan.blogspot.com/2020/12/deducing-beginning-of-5-year-yuga.html)

  

To understand yuga, we have to start from the basics, so it is notpossible to write here. I have a 50 page chapter in my upcoming book, for clarifying all the issues around the Yugas. For now, you can start reading my series. One of the topicsof Yuga yoked byDharma and adharma:[Jayasree Saranathan: Sandhya, Sandhyamsa and the entry of Kali in Dharma Yuga scale. (Supplement to Mahabharata date series - 7)](https://jayasreesaranathan.blogspot.com/2021/03/sandhya-sandhyamsa-and-entry-of-kali-in.html)

The current scale of yuga in vogue, that started with the arrival of monsoon:[Jayasree Saranathan: Arrival of Indian monsoon signaled the start of Treta Yuga in Dharma scale (Supplement to Mahabharata date series: 8)](https://jayasreesaranathan.blogspot.com/2021/03/arrival-of-indian-monsoon-signaled.html)

  

Kali Maha Yuga computation is used by us even now, and epigraphically proven too, so can't be ignored in dating Mahabharata.

  

# Earth doesn't behave like a spin top, but a gyroscope in zero gravity space whose orientation can never change. There is an experiment in the Space station showing that.

I have given evidence for the absence of axial precession of the earth from archao-astronomy.

How to justify the continuing alignment of the equinoxes?[(DOC) No axial precession of the earth proven by Archaeoastronomy of ancient monuments \| Dr. Jayasree Saranathan - Academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/44178992/No_axial_precession_of_the_earth_proven_by_Archaeoastronomy_of_ancient_monuments)

  

We seem to get stuck with what is taught in textbooks, and not keep in tune with the ever evolving surprisesin science. Some of them were listed out by me in the 4th chapter of my 5 part paper published last year. Can be read here 

[(PDF) Siddhantic Concept of Precession of Equinoxes -New Revelations \| Dr. Jayasree Saranathan - Academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/47853142/Siddhantic_Concept_of_Precession_of_Equinoxes_New_Revelations)

  

One important phenomenon is happening now on the earth that is explainable in the Vedic oscillatory model. The last time it happened, the sages had written it as the Fall of Nahusha. Now again Nahusha is pushing Agastya, sarpa, sarpa, and he is going to fall down soon. I didn't have time to explain that part in the lecture, but will do a short video on that after I publish my book next month.

  

The present rate of movement of Nahusha'spalanquin is 15 mt per year, It was 38 mt, 130 years ago when the journey started. Only in the last 20 years, some people have started watching this movement. The day thespeed gets reduced, the scientific community will wake up and work on it which would lead to the re-discovery of Vedic concept of oscillatory equinox. Only after that we, the Indians will wake up and say we already said so.

  

With regards,

Jayasree
