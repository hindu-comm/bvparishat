Dear Sri Nagabhushana Rao,

  

I have the English version books. In order to study the difference of two years between Dr Jayasree’s 3136 BC and Sri Venkatachalam’s 3138, I wanted the Telugu versions. I would be grateful if you could share the Telugu version with me.

  

Regards,

  

Krishna Kumar Pillalamarri
