Dear Shri Krishna Kumar,

I am not in a position to resolve thisissue. I can only offer some information that may help in better understanding.

1\. I read about the date being Feb. 18, 3102 BCE as the start of Kaliyuga, but I don't know how it was derived. I would love to read the first paper on it, where the connection between Indian text details were made with the European calendar. I checked pages 44-45 of the book by Shri Kota Venkatachelam, but he seems to have assumed this date. There is no calculation verifying this date.

2\. The use of Gregorian vs. Julian calendar should not result in an extra year as the difference between them is only 26 days in 3101 BCE or 3102 BCE.

Stellarium also provides Julian Days akin to Ahargana calculations. Here they are for these two years.

Please note that -3100 means 3101 BCE and -3101 means 3102 BCE. This is due to the fact that there was no zero AD/BC and 1 BC (BCE) was followed by 1 AD (CE), while astronomysoftware usezero year.

  

3\. I checked the verses referred by Dr. Saranathan, and could locate these in Gita Press edition:

Now, how do we interpret 36th year? We are in 2021 now. What is 36th year from now? Is it 2056 or 2057?

Look forward to the opinion of other scholars in this forum.

  

Best regards,

Raja
