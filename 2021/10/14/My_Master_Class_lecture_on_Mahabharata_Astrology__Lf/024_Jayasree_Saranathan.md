Dear Mr. Jijith,

  

Please check your mails. We have not interacted anytime on Mr. Oak's book or atmospheric refraction. The last time we exchanged mails was when you wanted me to refrain from questioning Mr. Elst for his claim that Rama was not a reality. That was way back in 2012 or so when Mr. Koch and Mr. Elst claimed that the Indians borrowed 'rashi' concept from the Greeks.

  

On atmospheric refraction: You may have talked about it for long, even I did, but I made a specific observation in my 2019 book about the right-ward shift of Dhruva, Mars and Arundhati- Vasishtha (A-V) alignment which can not happen under the normal rule of atmospheric refraction. In normal course the celestial object will appear to shift to the left, towards the zenith. Only in the case of negative refractive index - which is impossible in Nature- the shift towards right, to the horizon can happen. The negative atmospheric refractive value can happen under extreme heat and rarity of atmosphere near the ground. Possible for a few moments when an extra terrestrial object hits the ground.

  

# point 1:

Vedanga Jyothisha offers the framework of rules to construct the 5 year Yuga. Based on that we can create for the current time too. I created for the Mahabharata time. The basic requisite is the knowledge of tropical position of the sun. That's were ayanamsa comes into picture. Kali Yuga starting at zero ayanamsa gives us the location of the tropical sun during Kali yuga / Mahabharatha, based on which I constructed the 5 year yuga of Mahabharata time.

  

# Dating Mahabharatha requires a 3- discipline approach- history, epigraphy and astrology. Year name and year number are crucial for zeroing on a particular year. One should know the Kali year for dates of Kali yuga of 5122 years now. Mahabharata coming 35 years before Kali Yuga gives the year. That was Krodhi.

  

Now we should know in which of the 5 years of the 5 year yuga, Krodhi was running. I deduced it in my book and posted in my blog link given in my previous mail. The ayanamsa of that time being zero, it needed no correction. I have shown how all the planetary references fall in place for the year Krodhi, for zero ayanamsa of vedic ayanamsa.

  

# point 2 and 3:

I go by the version and findings of experts in meteor- hit field. Those information form a separate chapter in my upcoming book.

  

# point 4:

  

How could someone see a shift in the entire sky?

It was palpable in the case of a few such as the tilt A-V, not in the entire constellation of Saptarishis (Ursa Major) which is too huge and which is seen changing direction within hours. And one must have been watching the sky at that moment.

  

A-V and Dhruva are always watched as a sequence (Arundhati Darshana nyaya). Vyasa had taken a look at them when he found something wrong around him. The sound of thunder in cloudless sky ( sonic boom) must must alerted him to look at the sky. It is also very much likely he was doing evening twilight oblations to the Saptarishis. The crash happened at sunset time. In the same conversation he says the Saptarishis were obscured by the glowing red crown of 2 planets.

  

This solves the issue. Mars and Venus were low in west horizon on that month of Karthika. Direction of Scorpio sinking in the west is easily palpable (I am a regular sky watcher right from my 8th year). So the tilt of Mars was palpable.

  

The red crown of the planets is NOx that is abundantly produced in the case of an object's entry from outer space. In the dark surrounding at that time, the reddish hue was palpable on the two shining objects - Venus and Mars on his left ( west) after he looked at north. The crash kicked off atmospheric turbulence immediately which blurred the saptarishi constellation right in front of his eyes.

  

Every description of Vyasa was discussed with the meteor expert who confirmed the crash. That appears in the GISP2 data /graphs. 3136 bce was the only event among the four of Piora oscillation, that was not historically documented until I brought to the attention of the world.

  
Regards,

Jayasree
