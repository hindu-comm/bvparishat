Thanks a lot Dr. Raja Roy.

  

The softwareissue is too serious to be ignored.

The equations can be framed in any way to give different results.

To give an example, the Mesha Sankramana of current times canoccuron different days depending on the ayanamsaused.

If it is 14th April as per Lahiri ayanamsa, it is 13th April if we use Pushyapakshaayanamsa.

What we call ayanamsa is precession in astronomy, which I showed, differed by 2 degrees 400 years ago.

  

Regards,

Jayasree
