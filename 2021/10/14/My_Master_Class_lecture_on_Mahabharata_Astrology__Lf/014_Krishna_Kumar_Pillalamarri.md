Dr. Raja Roy,

  

*"Now, how do we interpret 36th year? We are in 2021 now. What is 36th year from now? Is it 2056 or 2057? "*

  

That is exactly the question I was asking. The reason I was trying to resolve this in my mind, for my own benefit is that the two year difference between Dr. Jayasree Saranathan'sdate of 3136 BC and Kota Venkatachelam's3138 BC may be explained by omitting zero in conversions to Gregorian calendar. May be more research is needed if similar error was spotted in any other dating for other phenomenon. Dr. Jayasree'sexplanations in her presentation seem to hold their own without any other dependencies, ( I will wait for comments from other, more qualified people than me) so we must look for these type of answers. I will also read 'The Plot in Indian Chronology' in detail once again. If I can get hold of the original in Telugu, it may explain this difference. Unfortunately I only have the translation. If any scholar on the forum has a copy of the original, I request them to shareit with me. Thanks in advance.

  

  

Best Regards,  
  
Krishna
