Dear Dr Jayasree ji

  

You mentioned the following:-

# I want to clarify that we have not done any talk or programme together and I was the first one to have talked about the atmospheric refraction theory fordescribing Arundhati observation in my **2019** ebook critiquing Mr. Oak's Mahabharata. Can be read here:

[(1) (PDF) Myth of 'The Epoch of Arundhati' of Nilesh Nilkanth Oak \| Dr. Jayasree Saranathan - Academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/44757153/Myth_of_The_Epoch_of_Arundhati_of_Nilesh_Nilkanth_Oak)  

  

**I did not say we did a talk or programme together**. I am only mentioning the email exchanges. If my memory iscorrect, you first contacted me based on my writings in the website AncientVoice, which I established in November 2010. I don't remember when exactly our interaction started but I can search my emails and AncientVoice Forum logs to find out when it started and how itproceeded and what all topics we have discussed.

  

But regarding your 2019 eBook claim, I wish to draw your attention to two of my online interactions with Nilesh in **2017**.

I mentions about atmospheric effects as the cause of Arundhati-Vasistha relative positionshift and the shift in the mark on the moon as early as **1/12/2017**

I have mentioned the same in an **FB Debate with Nilesh organized by Indic Academy 30/7/2017**, 4 months earlier too.

If i search my emails in Indic Academy I can get me mentioning the same atmospheric effects as the cause of Arundhati-Vasistha relative position shift and the mark on the moon shift even earlier too. In fact, I am telling this **since the first time I met Nilesh in 2016 July during Neera Misra ji's Indraprastha conference at Delhi** where both myself, Nilesh and Dr Ashok Bhatnager presented our research papers.

  

Now since you are denying that I have not told you about these atmospheric effects I am having doubt whether I did tell (i.e. emailed) you this. You may be true. I will search my email records to check this. But the fact remains that I am telling this since **2016** and more prominently since **2017** and **certainly earlier than 2019**.

  

In your response I noted the following:-

1.  You are not revealing your **date for Vedanga Jyotisha**. It is an
    important piece of the puzzle and I humbly submit that you please
    provide it or arrive at a date for it by your own unique way of
    dating texts. 2.  You mentioned Earth will retain its orientation even if there is an
    impact. That is scientifically impossible in mylimited knowledge of
    planetary science. Any disturbance will upset the Earth-Moon system
    from its existing equilibrium. New equilibrium will certainly be
    achieved. But there is 0.0000000000001% chance that this
    new-equilibrium will be the same as the older equilibrium. There
    will certainly be some permanent change - like an fraction of a
    degree change in the spin axis, precession axis etc 3.  The restoration of new equilibrium certainly take time depending on
    the intensity of the disturbance 4.  You did not give a counter argument when I mentioned that change in
    the orientation of earth will causeshifts in the entire sky with
    **all its stars** as a whole in contrast to changes in the location
    of a few local stars. I am eager to hear your counter argument
    regarding that.

Jijith
