Dear Dr Jayasree ji

  

**Once again thanks for the illuminating talk on the Mahabharata Astrology.**  
  
Below are my observations after watching your full one and half hour presentation.

  

A **momentum disturbance** in the Earth-Moon system usually continues without any correction. Sure, it is possible to have the Earth-Moon system to attain a new equilibrium, but it will take a very long period. It will be a totally new equilibrium different from that which existed before the momentum-disturbance in the Earth-Moon system caused due to some meteor impact,like the one you are propsosing. If this occurred in around 3000-3100 BCE period, that means only 5000 years has elapsed and I don't think it is sufficient time to recover from the kind of impact you are proposing, which caused the shortening of the lunar half-period to 13 days from 14 days.  

  
Such an impact will certainly cause many 13 day lunar-half periods in the subsequent months or years or centuries. But none of that is hinted at in the Mahabharata. Certainly the Earth-Moon system hit by an impact and momentum-disturbance cannot recover and regain its original state in such a short period as 30 months or 30 years or 300 years.  
  
The shift on the mark of the moon can also be due to **atmospheric disturbances**. Atmospheric disturbances can cause **change in the refractive-index** in the local regions of the earth's atmosphere. If our line of sight passes through this local area where the refractive index is different, than the other regions of the sksy, then it can cause the particular stars to change their apparent positions. I have already told you this a few years ago, while we were jointly refuting Nilesh's far fetched date of Mahabharata at 5561 BCE.  
  
Thus, if our line of sight towards Arundhati-Vasistha is passing through such an atmospheric disturbance in the sky where the refractive index is shifted from the other adjacent regions of the sky, then it can cause the shifts in the relative position of Arundhati vs Vasitha. It can also cause an apparent shift in the mark of the moon.  
  
Thus, none of the observations in the Mahabharata require any huge meteorite impact.The kind of meteor impact which can disturb the Earth-Moon system strong enough to reduce the half-period of the moon to 13 days, will certainly also cause devastating impacts on earth like Tsunamis and terrible loss of life all over the world. Moreover, it will cause a global shift in the apparent positions of all the constellations and stars of earth, and not just the Pole star and Arundhati-Vasistha alone. Because, if earth changes its orientation / spin axis vector due to any impact and the resultant momentum transfer, everyone on Earthwill be seeing thesky in adifferent shifted up-vector, and it will cause **ALL thestars in the sky of earth to shift**, not just one or two local stars.

  

If shifts happen to just one or to stars, it has to be atmospheric disturbances and not any shift in Earth's orientation.  
  
However small meteor entry to Earth atmosphere, which burns out on entry before hitting earth can cause similar atmospheric disturbances. The meteor descriptions in Mahabharata are closer to such a scenario.  
  
Again, a tilt in the earth's orientation (due to impact and momentum-exchange) cannot cause any relative change in the position of Arundhati vs Vasistha due to parallax effects. Because the diameter of earth is extremely small in comparison to the distance towards these
stars from earth or solar-system. Any tilt in the earth's orientation will only cause a shift in the position of **both Arundhati and Vasistha along with ALL other stars in the sky of Earth**. Thus, any apparent momentary change in the relative position of Arundhati vs Vasistha has to be due to atmospheric disturbances, which can also cause the mark on the moon to apparently shift.  
  
Hence the amplitude of the impact that your co-researcher scientist (Joachim Seifert) mentioned as occurring in 3136 BCE needs to be examined. Many low level impacts do occur every now and then. But none of them were big enough to cause any big disturbances in the Earth-Moon system so as to cause a shortening of the Moon's half period to 13 years or to cause the earth's orientation to wobble.  
  
You also know that the prevalent**Yuga** of Mahabharata is **just 5 year long. Panchvarshiya Yuga**. The total duration of the Chatur Yugas were redefined to be bigger and bigger, as we see it within Mahabharata itself as 12000 years (Markandeya-Samvada, Vana Parva). Later this 12000 years was multiplied by 360 to give rise to 43,20,000 year long Yuga (Shanti Parva). These large Yugas (like 43,20,000 years long) have no relevance in Bharatiya pre-History, in my view and have to be taken as a mathematical construct to compute theoretically recurring planetaryalignments only.  
  
Hence, dating of Kurukshetra War and Rama's birth based on the later expanded Chatur Yuga definition has no relevance,in myview. Even otherwise, t**he verses describing** **the Jataka of Rama are found to be later additions** and hence removed from the critical edition of Ramayana. Rama is mentioned in the 10th Mandala of Rgveda. Samtanu too is mentioned as contemporary in the 10th Mandala of Rgveda. Hence both are more or less contemporary to the 10th Mandala of Rgveda. Between Samtanu to Parikshit is only 5 generations or 125 years. Parikshit was born a year after the Kurukshetra War. Hence Samtanuand Rama can be dated to around 125 years older to Kurukshetra War. Even otherwise Vasistha was the priest of Rama. Vasistha's son Shakthi, his son Parasara. Parasara's son Vyasa is a contemporary of Vichitravirya and Bhishma and like a grandfather to the Pandavas. Thus in both ways Rama cannot be dated far away in 5000 BCE or 5114 BCE.  
  

The more important question here is the **dating of the Vedang Jyotisha**. The late AK Kaul has dated it to 1400 BCE using internal evidence of Vedanga Jyotisha itself.

  

If we go by 1400 BCE, then the Kurukshetra War period has to be a few centuries earlier to 1400 BCE since it exhibits some basic features of a developing Vedanga Jotisha. In this case Kurukshetra war period has to be around **1504 BCE** (like that done by Krishna Kumar R) or **1793 BCE** (like that done by Dr Ashok Bhatnagar). The dates beyond 3000 BCE are then far away from the 1400 BCE date of Vedanga Jyotisha. But of course, if there is an older date for Vedanga Jyotisha based on its own internal references or by some other means, a rethink is possible here. Hence I need to know what is your date of Vedanga Jyotisha?

  

The **oscillatorytheory of precession is interesting**. That is what I can say at the current moment.  
  
However I don't see wide acceptance of an **oscillatory precision** in scientific parlance as against the **cyclic precession** taking around **25,772 years** to make one cycle. Most of the scientists with whom I discussed after seeing your talk, said that the case of a cyclic precession of earth is a more-or-less settled matter.

  

The same thing I said in my previous email toyou on14thOctober.

  

**Earth is basically a spin-top**. Like anything that spins, it has to exhibit a cyclic precession by its very basic nature. There may be other pendular / oscillatory movements caused by the sun's movement around the Milky Way Galaxy. I am not ruling that out. But such **pendular motions cannot nullify the precession movement of earth.** Not only Earth, but **anyplanet which spins, has to preccess**due to its angular momentum and the forces acting on it due to the Earth-Moon system tug forces and due to other minor external forces like the tiny forces exerted on it by other planets and planet configurations. Hence, any pendular / oscillatory movement due to the sun has to be superimposed on the precession movement of Earth to understand the sky configuration or the Kalachakra.  
  
The former cannot cancel out or conceal the latter.

Jijith
