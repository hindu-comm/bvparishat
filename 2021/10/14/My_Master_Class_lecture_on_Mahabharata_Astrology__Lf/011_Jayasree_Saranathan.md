Dear Mr Jijith,

  

Thanks for your congratulations.

  

For your information, there is no newfinding done by me. The date of Kali Yuga is followedby us for all these millennia and is used in dating inscriptions and from that I deducedthe year of Mahabharata date as per the 35 year gap givenin the text. All that I did was validation of the year through primary sources of evidence. I didn't discovera year.

  

Secondly, the cosmic impact is understandablefrom theoral traditionthat continues to exist in Tamil, ofKrishna doing tarpan well before thearrival of Amavasya. If you have seen the Tamil movie "Karnan" then also you would have known. I only explained by my hand gestures how Trayodaśī Amavasya is impossible to happen, and if it all it happens, under what circumstances it can happen. The events that unfold since the beginning of Krishna leaving Upaplavya describe these circumstances.

  

Your questions and doubts make me understand that you have not listened to my lecture.

All your questions are answered there.

  

Anyway quick replies:

  

# On PVNR's version of rejecting Surya Siddhanta and sticking to Drik :

Lahiri ayanamsa worksfor now and Vedic / Surya Siddhanta works for zero ayanamsa. Check by yourself with any date and with all the ayanamsa to see this. I explained in the lecture why only at two points of time - now and zero ayanamsa.

Drik works for the time under consideration. Parasara's Drikcan not be used for now. What is Drik today is not valideven a century later. Whatis Drik in Mahabharata time must be used for decipheringthat date. Zero ayanamsa of Surya Siddhanta / Vedic astronomywas the Drik of Kali yuga / Mahabharata time. That is why it comes into picture to decipher the date. I deciphered all theevents as per traditionaland calendric dates using this. Did anyone get the date right for Kali Yuga by the models they use? Kali Yuga date and the calendric cycles that started then are the tests of reliability for the model one uses. Only Surya Siddhanta / Vedic model passes the test. Explained with graphs.

  

# On Mr. Ashok Bhatanagar's version on equinox and solstices: Is the equinox - solstice of the 5-year Yuga same as those simulated on astronomy software? I explained this part also. Did he or any one construct the 5-year Yuga of the Mahabharata period? For that you need to know the equinoctial position at that time. More importantly one needs to know that its is not western tropical.

  

# On what scientists say about precession:

If you want to reject Vedic version, no one stops you, but the fact of the matter is that the Mahabharatadate cannot be simulatedin the current model of precession. Another fact is that only a society that had lived for more than 3600 years could have known that the equinox does not always precess. The Vedic societyhad lived for so long, and longer than that, but westernscience has only 100 years of data on precession. Explained all these and more in the lecture.

  
# More importantly, why do we use ayanamsa for our horoscopes even today? If you find out the answer for this, you will know that Vedic sages had known something that modern science had not yet known. Explained these also.

  

# I raised a question, that we use ayanamsa for everything - finds it ingrained in month- seasons such that they don't change - but use a model for dating the Mahabharata that doesn't incorporate ayanamsa. Why?

  

# No comments on your 3rd and 4th paragraph as there is a huge gap between us on what we are talking about precession.

  

# What does the collaborator scientist say?

Precession is not his cup of tea, but my son is an astronomer who has taught precession to undergraduates and continuesto usethe precession theory for his satellite projects. He agrees in principle with the Vedic model of equinoxes, because he concedes that science is continually evolving and not static. He is aware of the anomalies, giving rise to doubts on the current model of precession. He knows its application for current / Drik because it is the solution for space probes, satellitepositioning and more BUT not meant for extrapolating to the past. The n-body problem comes in that context. Do you know the current orientation of the earth? It is not precessing, it is moving forward since 2000. The causes are internal to the earth - which violates the luni-solar pull of the precession theory. Couple of evidence I cited in the lecture, which if grasped, will make one understand that a new branch of Physics is waiting to be discovered. Already people have started working on it. I wanted my son to work on it, but with his current commitments, he has shared Vedic insights with his friends who work on precession. The race for a Nobel has started.

  

# You want to know about the geological and the meteorologicalrecords for the Hastinapura event. I suggest you first gather the evidence for the event from the text of the Mahabharata as I did. Then you will understand the question you asked.

  

Hope I clarified.

  

Regards,

Jayasree
