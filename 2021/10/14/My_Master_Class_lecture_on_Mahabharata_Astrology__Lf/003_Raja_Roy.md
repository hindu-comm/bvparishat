Congratulations Dr. Saranathan. A very illuminating talk. As you rightly point out, there are serious issues in using astronomy software for dating as people using them do not realize the margins of errors involved as one goes further back in antiquity. The points about validation of eclipses are also very intriguing. Things are not as simple as looking into NASA catalogues. As Prof. Ramesh Rao pointed out, the comet impact also needs further investigation. Congratulations again.

  

Best regards,

Raja
