Congratulations to Ms. Jayasree Saranathan. Her proposed date of Mahabharata war, 3136 B.C., aligns closely with the date of 3138 B.C., claimed by Pandit Kota Venkatachalam, in his 1940s work, " The plot in Indian Chronology ", page no. 45., published by Kota VenkatachelamHistorical Research Institute (KVHRI). He has laid out very precise arguments on how he arrived at his conclusions. Books are available from the publisher. I have a copy.

  

Best Regards,  
  
Krishna
