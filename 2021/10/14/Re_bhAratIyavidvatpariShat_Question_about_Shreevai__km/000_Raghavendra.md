Season's greetings,

  

The idea-of-ब्रह्मन् according to सर्वश्री-रामानुजाचार्य is,

  

ब्रह्मशब्देन स्वभावतः निरस्तनिखिलदोषः अनवधिकातिशयासङ्ख्येयकल्याणगुणगण: पुरुषोत्तमोऽभिधीयते।

  

All names are epithets ofब्रह्मन् who is conceived as above. So, according to   
सर्वश्री-रामानुजाचार्य, the names viz., शिव, शङ्कर, इन्द्र and others in their etymological sense speak ofब्रह्मन् who is स्वभावतः निरस्तनिखिलदोषः and अनवधिकातिशयासङ्ख्येयकल्याणगुणगण: and पुरुषोत्तमः

  

The philosophical idea behind the above conception is - "ब्रह्मन् is वाच्य", meaning ब्रह्मन् is directly expressible by words (all words belonging to the domain of लौकिक & वैदिक)

  

Coming to your \*core questions\* of how Shiva is to be worshipped in that sampradaya and why followers of that sampradaya do not visit Shiva temples, I am afraid, I am not competent to answer,

  

The text quoted above may hold an answer, but I defer it to experts belonging to the sampradaya.  

  

Thank you and Best regards,

Subject: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Question about Shreevaishnva sampradaya  
  
Respected list members,

  

I would like to know the svaroopa of Shiva and how his pooja/Aradhana should be done (or not done) as per the Shreevaishnava sampradaya.

  

As a casual observer, I have seen that the followers of Shreevaishnava sampradaya do not visit temples of Shiva and do not worship him. But I notice that in the Vekatesha Suprabhata composed by a Shreevaishnava and recited in Tirupati, there is the word विधिशङ्करेन्द्रवनिताभिरर्चिते.

  

Hence the doubt.

  

Thank you.

  

Regards

Pradyumna
