Namaste

  

I have learnt from my Srivaishnava friends that for them the Bhakti to Vishnu takes the form of 'Paramaikaantikatva', that is, it is centered **only** on Vishnu without deviating to any other god. Devotion to Vishnu and His consort Mahalakshmi is supreme for them. Hence they do not worship Shiva or any other parivara of Shiva. There is a story related to Ramanuja: He refused to enter a Shiva temple on the wayside even in the face of battering rain saying'a chaste woman would not seek another man'. I have also read a Srivaishnava article that they should desist from learning music and dance since these would open occasions to sing/contemplate/perform the glories of gods other than Vishnu. Their devotion to Vishnu is to such an extent that they would never even name children after other gods.

  

Yet there are instances such as an Azhwar appreciating a Nayanmaar (devotee of Shiva). There is also this paasuram of PeyAzhwar:

 Vishnu took the form of Shiva and Vishnu in the same body..
