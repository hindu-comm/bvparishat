Here is a reference: <https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m02/m02013.htm>
//Yudhishthira always said,--Give unto each what is due to each,--and the only sounds that he could hear were,--*Blessed be Dharma! Blessed be Dharma!*Yudhishthira! conducting himself thus and giving paternal assurance to everybody, there was none in the kingdom who entertained any hostile feelings towards him. He therefore came to be called Ajatasatru (one with no enemy at all). //

  

The URL corresponds to the Adiparvan and here is the BORI Sanskrit text of that parvan:<https://bombay.indology.info/mahabharata/text/UD/MBh02.txt>

#### This verse is about Yudhishthira:

``` 02012008a एवं गते ततस्तस्मिन्पितरीवाश्वसञ्जनाः 02012008c न तस्य विद्यते द्वेष्टा ततोऽस्याजातशत्रुता 
```
