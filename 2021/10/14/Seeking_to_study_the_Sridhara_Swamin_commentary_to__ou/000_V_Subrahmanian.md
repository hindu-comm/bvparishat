Namaste  

  

A friend in Karnataka is desirous of studying the Srimad Bhagavata Purana with Sridhara Swamin's commentary. If there is anyone who could teach him, even online, in Hindi / Sanskrit/ English, please give contact details. He is most comfortable with Kannada though. There will be a reasonable Guru Dakshina. Thanks.
