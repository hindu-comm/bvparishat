Respected list members,

  

I would like to know the svaroopa of Shiva and how his pooja/aradhana should be done (or not done) as per the Shreevaishnava sampradaya.

  

As a casual observer, I have seen that the followers of Shreevaishnava sampradaya do not visit temples of Shiva and do not worship him. But I notice that in the Vekatesha Suprabhata composed by a Shreevaishnava and recited in Tirupati, there is the word विधिशङ्करेन्द्रवनिताभिरर्चिते.

  

Hence the doubt.

  

Thank you.

  

Regards

Pradyumna
