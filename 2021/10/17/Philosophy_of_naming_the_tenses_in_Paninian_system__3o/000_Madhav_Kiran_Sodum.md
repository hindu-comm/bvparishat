Respected Vidvans,

Pranams to all,  

  

Could you please tell if there is any common feature between all the ṭ-ending lakāras (laṭ, liṭ, luṭ, lṛṭ, leṭ and loṭ) or between all the ṅ-ending lakāras (laṅ, liṅ, luṅ, lṛṅ) due to which the tenses were named as such by Panini? Or is the naming arbitrary?  

  

  

Thanking you in advance.
