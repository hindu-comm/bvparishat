Madhavji,

  

I know very little and here I put down a few words, in case it helps.  
  
Panini names the suffixes so that the name of the suffix itself tells how to apply the suffix. In general, suffixes don't just join with the dhaatu but they modify the dhaatu too. How to modify the dhaatu is encoded in the name of the suffix.  
  
All the lakaara names ending in ṭhave something in common in how they modify the dhaatu and similarly lakaara names ending in ṅ. In many instances the eighteen suffixes, which attach to dhaatus, themselves get changed depending on if they are in the ṭ group or the ṅ group.  
  
In short, naming them thus makes for the shortest derivation from the dhaatu to its final form.  
  
To get a complete answer you may have to devote time learning the Paninian system of derivation.  
  
I have given a response, as a beginner like me would know. I am sorry if you knew this and you were looking for a higher philosophical answer.

  

Thanks.

  

Himanshu
