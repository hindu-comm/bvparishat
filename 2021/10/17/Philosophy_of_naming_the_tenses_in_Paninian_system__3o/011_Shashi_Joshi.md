Korada Acharya,

I am interested to know the source of the shloka you mentioned in the last reply:

  

आचार्यात् पादमादत्ते पादं शिष्यः स्वमेधया ।

पादं सब्रह्मचारिभ्यः पादं कालक्रमेण च ॥**याज्ञवल्क्यशिक्षा**

  

I am unable to find in the aforementioned work as available here
-<https://archive.org/details/shikshasamgraha>

  

Do you, by any chance, have the shloka number reference for it?

  

DhanyavadaH,  
Shashi
