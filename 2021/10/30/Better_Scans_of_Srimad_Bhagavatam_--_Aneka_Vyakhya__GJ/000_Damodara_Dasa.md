Hare Krishna.  
  
Adaraniya vidvaj-janas,  
  
Recently I purchased Bhagavatam : Aneka-vyakhya-samalankrtam, from  
Sola Vidyapeeth. I am reading from that now. I already had the pdf  
scans of this downloaded from [archive.org](http://archive.org).  
  
I am finding that the font resolution quality of the pdf scans is  
better than the current printed edition, especially the volumes that  
are recently re-printed. I checked it by getting some of the pdf scans  
printed and comparing them with the book edition I have.  
  
However, I also see that only the scanned pdf edition that is  
available online from [archive.org](http://archive.org) is not legibly good; it has a lot of  
black spots (small and big) and in one of the volumes the text is out  
of focus. In some of the volumes, the text from the back-side page is  
partly visible which makes the legibility of the real text very bad.  
  
So I was thinking if there is any other scanned edition that is  
available in good quality. If not, then, if possible, someone in this  
field can get on his list of getting SB-aneka-vyakhya-samalankrtam  
freshly newly scanned. Now the technology has improved and maybe we  
can get good scans.  
  
Thank you,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava Das,  
damodara das
