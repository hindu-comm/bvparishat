Dear all  

Is there any paper or writings, for inferring the date, which describes the contexts (giving references from Harsha Charita and references from Biography of Chinese traveler Hieun Tsang) and which makes us believe that the same Harsha was referred to by both Hieun Tsang and Bana? I highly appreciate your help.

Thanks

Krishna Prasad
