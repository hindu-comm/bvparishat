**Abstract:**

Almost no performance of Indian dance, but even more particularly of Bharatanāṭyam, can be expected to commence without a homage to Naṭarāja, the "King of Dancers". Lord Śiva's Sandhyā-tāṇḍava dance is referred to in the Meghadūta of Kālidāsa (1st century BCE) in his famed description of the Mahākāla temple at Ujjain.  
  
The Dance of Śiva Naṭarāja holds an enduring fascinating in the minds not only of lovers of art but also those who are oriented towards religion and philosophy - thanks to the great efforts of Dr. Ananda K Coomaraswamy (1877-1947), and even science (as subsequently followed up and elaborated by Fritjof Capra (1939- ) also. Still there remain some problems that are not fully solved, as for example, of the trampling of Apasmāra, which looks rather like an act of cruelty on the part of the divinity presenting the very Dance of Bliss, Ānanda-tāṇḍava. How is this to be resolved? A solution based on key yogic sources is presented in this talk.
