Respected Members,  
  
Greetings of the day!  
  
I have been working on a topic: **A Study on Therapeutic Effect of Indian Classical Music: A *Svara* Based Approach to Mental Health**. This research work is going on under the supervision of Prof. J.S.R. Prasad, Department of Sanskrit Studies and the co-supervision of Prof. B. R. Shamanna, School of Medical Sciences, University of Hyderabad. I have planned for a practical component as part of my work. This is a kind request to you to spare some of your valuable time to participate in this experimental survey.  
  
'Abhivarṇikā Siddhi' is an online survey consisting selected pre-recorded music clips played through the wonderful Indian musical instrument - Rudra Vīṇā. The whole process will take a maximum of 45 minutes of your time.  
  
1. Online link to the survey is - [tstbl.co/789-514](http://tstbl.co/789-514)  
2. You need not fill in any of your personal details, except details on age, gender, education, and nationality for statistical purposes
