Dear Scholar friends,

  

Good morning. I am sharing a video of an International Folk Literature  

Festival we hosted here last month . The idea was to hear what other

communities sample as folk literature. We selected nine poets from  

other countries - US, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, France, Italy (2), Hungary

and Cambodia and mixed them with six Indian poets - Hindi, Tamil, Kannada,  

Bengali, Kashmiri and Sanskrit. We called it New England Folk Literature

and Oral Poetry Festival. This was the first of its kind to bring the world

together in literature on a common platform. I wrote a screen play for

a boat ride around the world. A local poet acted as the Captain.

It is a ninety minute video. We think it is educational. You may sample

at your convenience. Please try to hear each recitation if you can.

We will try to expand it to include more countries in a two-day event

next year.

There is a huge file of slides that goes into the video. You can write  

to me in case specially interested.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
