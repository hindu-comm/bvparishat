Namaste



In some major and influential research contributions under circulation, ancient Bharath / India is described as ‘sparchbund’ land.

Misunderstanding and mis-mapped translation of terms kill research and civilizational identity anchored to such ‘ lexicographers errors’ \[[Lexicographic error - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_error) \].

Please take a look at the link below and help me to get some clarity on the following question/s pl. 

***Question/s***: How right and acceptable is it for tradition to characterize ‘Bharatham of IVC time line’ as ‘sparchbund land’- prior to a reference time line like 700 BCE ( for Buddha / Mahaveer/ Panini) ?


Does the term carry deep down ‘ sleeping cells from IE- linguistics originating from ‘Tower of Bable’ and flowing to ‘ indology’ with a potential to destroy the traditional framework of
‘Bharatham, as the land where Brahmi language –families flourished ? ; The term Brahmi ( as sarva-bhashaa- mayee) covers Samskrutham ,Prakruths’ Tamils, Apabhramshas and Meluhas. 



This could be helpful to many like me, to understand the ‘forking point inside home-team –Indology approach understanding and core traditional thinking ( anchored to srimad Bhagavad-Gita) aiming to set the
‘time-line build up using Vedanga Jyotish- arithmetic /time cycle conception, as an effort to fix the ‘ date of Mahabharata war, the event and birth day of connected people’. It is also a deep introspective question to think : have we adapted the term ‘sparchbund’ in its partial meaning, to describe ‘Bhartam- Janam / Bharatiya- Bhashaa- itihaasa’ \[ India as a nation carved out on the basis of ‘language –demography’ , describes itself officially as ‘ language- Union’.\] The key understanding I am looking for the validation of ‘ genetic relation of
Bharatha-Brahmi- Languages of pre-paninan period.

*Meaning of Sparchbund*: \[ <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprachbund>
- see highlighted RED \].

Sprachbund : \[ Not to be confused with the sociolinguistic term sprechbund, or with sprachraum, an area defined by a language.\] A sprachbund (German: lit. "language federation"), also known as a linguistic area, area of linguistic convergence, diffusion area or language crossroads, is a group of languages that share areal features resulting from geographical proximity and language contact. **The languages may be genetically unrelated, or only distantly related, but the sprachbund characteristics might give a false appearance of relatedness**.



A grouping of languages that share features can only be defined as a **sprachbund if the features are shared for some reason other than the genetic history of the languages.** Because of this, **attempts to classify some language families without knowledge about the history of the languages can lead to misclassification as sprachbunds** and similarly **some sprachbunds are incorrectly classified as language families**.



*Sparchbund concept formation for Indian subcontinent : *

In a classic 1956 paper titled "India as a Linguistic Area", Murray Emeneau laid the groundwork for the general acceptance of the concept of a sprachbund. In the paper, Emeneau observed that the subcontinent's Dravidian and Indo-Aryan languages shared a number of features that were not inherited from a common source, but were areal features, the result of diffusion during sustained contact. These include retroflex consonants, echo words, subject–object–verb word order, discourse markers, and the quotative. Emeneau specified the tools to establish that language and culture had fused for centuries on the Indian soil to produce an integrated mosaic of structural convergence of four distinct language families: Indo-Aryan, Dravidian, Munda and Tibeto-Burman. This concept provided scholarly substance for explaining the underlying Indian-ness of apparently divergent cultural and linguistic patterns. With his further contributions, this area has now become a major field of research in language contact and convergence.

*Sparchbund : Term History : *

In a 1904 paper, Jan Baudouin de Courtenay emphasised the need to distinguish between language similarities arising from a genetic relationship (rodstvo) and those arising from convergence due to language contact (srodstvo). Nikolai Trubetzkoy introduced the Russian term (yazykovoy soyuz; "language union") in a 1923 article. In a paper presented to the first International Congress of Linguists in 1928, he used a German calque ( calque =translation) of this term, Sprachbund, defining it as a group of languages with similarities in syntax, morphological structure, cultural vocabulary and sound systems, but without systematic sound correspondences, shared basic morphology or shared basic vocabulary.

Later workers, starting with Trubetzkoy's colleague Roman Jakobson, have relaxed the requirement of similarities in all four of the areas stipulated by Trubetzkoy.

Standard Average European (SAE) is a concept introduced in 1939 by Benjamin Whorf to group the modern Indo-European languages of Europe which shared common features. Whorf argued that these languages were characterized by a number of similarities including syntax and grammar, vocabulary and its use as well as the relationship between contrasting words and their origins, idioms and word order which all made them stand out from many other language groups around the world which do not share these similarities; in essence creating a continental sprachbund. His point was to argue that the disproportionate degree of knowledge of SAE languages biased linguists towards considering grammatical forms to be highly natural or even universal, when in fact they were only peculiar to the SAE language group.

Whorf likely considered Romance and West Germanic to form the core of the SAE, i.e. the literary languages of Europe which have seen substantial cultural influence from Latin during the medieval period. The North Germanic and Balto-Slavic languages tend to be more peripheral members. Alexander Gode, who was instrumental in the development of Interlingua, characterized it as "Standard Average European".The Romance, Germanic, and Slavic control languages of Interlingua are reflective of the language groups most often included in the SAE Sprachbund.
