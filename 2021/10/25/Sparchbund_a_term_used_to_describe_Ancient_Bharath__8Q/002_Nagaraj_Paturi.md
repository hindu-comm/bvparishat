There are two sides here:

  

1\. All the languages that were / are spoken in the Indic sub-continent have the same origin, originate from the same language.

  

2\. Different languages spoken in the Indic sub-continent have different origins, differentgroups of languages in this sub-continent originate from different languages.

  

Sprachbund / Linguistic Area theory presupposes #2 above.

  

#1 above can not go with Sprachbund / Linguistic Area theory.

  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Humongous intricate similarities found among languages spoken in the Indic subcontinent usually push people toward accepting #1 above.

  

Those who go with #2 above explain Humongous intricate similarities found among languages spoken in the Indic subcontinent on the basis of Sprachbund / Linguistic Area theory.

  

Sprachbund / Linguistic Area theory in essence is mutual influence among languages belonging to different language families leading to similarities / 'convergence' among them.
