On \< Brahmi language इत्य॒स्याप्युप॑युक्ताम् परिभा॒षाङ् क॑थयतु॒, येन॒ भव॑ता॒म् अन॑ल्पाना॒ल्ँ लेखा॑नाम् अव॒गम॑ने कृ॒च्छ्रो॑ऽपची॒येत॑ नः।\> :



1. Brahmi languages are language families which trace the ‘ language –tree’ from traditional perspective of ‘ Vedas speaking about Vak- devi, Sarasvati’:: Brahmi- bharati.

 It covers all human langauges, at least to a fair extent, obliterates the artificial divide called ‘ Indo-Aryan-Dravidian’.

In other terms the ‘maanava- bhashaa’ :: the languages which are spoken by ‘ lineage of Manu ( or Kashyapa) in the ‘ saptadveepaa – vasumati – trayo lokah’ – model

of universe/ flat earth with sky above is a broader description of ‘ Brahmi- Languages’. In short, it is much more than a ‘ religion Book-anectodal narrative on why 

languages splintered out following the community movement’.
