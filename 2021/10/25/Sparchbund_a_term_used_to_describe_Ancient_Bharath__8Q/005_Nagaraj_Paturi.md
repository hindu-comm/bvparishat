The significance of sprachbund/ Linguistic Area theory , particularly in the case of ' IVC' discussions as follows:

  

The decipherment of the 'IVC' / Saraswati Civilization script , on which the language spoken by 'IVC' / Saraswati Civilization people is anchored has two schools :

  

I.Thescript is linguistic

  

II\. The script is non-linguistic

  

Within # I above,

  

there are two schools :

  

1\. the language represented by the script is IE related

  

2. the language represented by the script isDravidian related.

  

The sprachbund/ Linguistic Area theory takes a middle ground within this.
