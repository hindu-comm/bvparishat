It isn't just prestige or strength.

  

Specific mantras in Sanskrit recited correctly and in the proper place and context are literally like lighting an explosive fire. You don't even have to understand what you are reciting... The correct vocal
production of that sound arrangement itself is both the fire spark and the catalyst to arrange the environmental energy and matter around you for the purpose specific to the mantra.

  

Grossly and utterly underestimated.
