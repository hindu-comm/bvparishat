Namaste. In general, sutras like यञञोश्च 2.4.64 and यञश्च 4.1.16 distinguish between यञ् and ञ्य. Also, प्राचां ष्फ तद्धितः 4.1.17 causesष्फ pratyay on the top of यञ् , but not on the top of ञ्य.
Therefore, specifically for द्वीप, We may have द्वीपे भवा द्वैप्यायनी । (द्वीप+ यञ्+ष्फ + ङीष् ) । This is according to the eastern grammarians, for others it would be द्वैप्या. However, I don'tthink this form exists in the usage, and SKA explicitly uses ञ्य to indicate that.  

  

Thanks
