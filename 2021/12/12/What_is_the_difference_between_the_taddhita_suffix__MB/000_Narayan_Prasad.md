Dear Scholars,  

    Namaste.

  

   What is the difference between the taddhita suffixes यञ् and ञ्य?

  

   Correspondingto Panini sutraद्वीपादनुसमुद्रं यञ् (पा॰4.3.10),

    we have,

   द्वीपादनुसमुद्राञ् ञ्यः (चां॰ 3.3.65)

   द्वीपादनुसमुद्रं ञ्यः (स॰कं॰ 4.3.96)

  

    In both these latter systems of Skt grammar also, both यञ् and ञ्य suffixes have been used.

  

    Hopefully, there must be some different grammatical operations expected in these two different suffixes, as, for example, in case of theकृत् suffixes शानच् and चानश्.

  

    Regards

    Narayan Prasad
