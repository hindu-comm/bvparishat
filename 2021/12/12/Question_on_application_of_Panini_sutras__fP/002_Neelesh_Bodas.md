य् is actually in अट्, so that explanation is not correct.

  

In क्रियन्ते, the णत्व is prohibited by the clever placement of the अनुस्वार-णत्व-परसवर्ण sequence within tripadi

1\) First the न् becomes अनुस्वार by नश्चापदान्तस्य झलि 8.3.24 giving क्रियंते

2\) Then there is no scope for णत्व by रषाभ्यां...8.4.1

3\) Then अनुस्वार Is converted back to न using अनुस्वारस्य ययि परसवर्णः 8.4.58. This is asiddha towards रषाभ्यां...8.4.1 and therefore not eligible for णत्व.

  

Exactly same with वृन्द ।

  

Thanks

Neelesh
