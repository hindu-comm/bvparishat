"**This section of the project is focused on articles relating to the full breadth of Hindu religious thought. The Encyclopaedia particularly emphasizes approaches which link the practices of religion to the concepts of theology.** Thus, an article such as ‘Sacrifice’ would explore sacrificial practices in relation to philosophical and theological ideas from within the Hindu tradition. In the Encyclopaedia’s understanding, Hindu theology is inquiry into the nature of divine or ultimate things, grounded in the metaphysical, epistemological, and normative commitments of Hindu traditions or practices.



The project began with Christian theology in 2018. In August 2021, it began expansion to Islam and Judaism. In addition to the present role in Hinduism, another in Buddhism is being offered.



Successful applicants will be part of a growing team of academic colleagues contributing to the commissioning and editing of several hundred articles across the faiths, working collaboratively with our senior editorial team in identifying areas of expansion for the Encyclopaedia, and engaging in a range of technical and support tasks appropriate to their skills.



Ideal candidates will have both a terminal degree in Hindu theology (in the broad definition above) or an equivalent area, connections to academic and non-academic Hinduism around the world or the ability to form such connections, and proven experience building research networks at any level.



Further information and informal enquiries may be directed to Sterling Yates (Project Manager), email:[s...@st-andrews.ac.uk](), or to Dorothy Campbell (Project Administrator), email:[dc...@st-andrews.ac.uk.]()



\*Appointment at grade 6 (salary £34,304 - £40,927 per annum) will be considered for candidates with less experience/knowledge of the area with the job description to be amended accordingly." \[Emphasis added\]

Best,

PS: No affiliation. Someone I know shared it with me and I am passing it on in the hope that it reaches a person who is commensurately sensitive and committed to a fair, balanced, non-reductive, and ethical representation of 'Hinduism'.
