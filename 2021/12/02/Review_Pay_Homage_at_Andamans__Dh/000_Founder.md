After a series of highly successful books launches across the country, Vikram will pay homage to Savarkar in Andamans in January 2022. This will be the culmination of a journey that began several years ago.  

  

INDICA earlier had the privilege to support Vikram during the research phase and is now pleased to collaborate with him for the final event.

  

We now invite public intellectuals to write a 750 word review of either or both hisbooks on Savarkar. 5 best reviews will be selected by Vikram and the reviewers will be hosted by INDICA to attend the shradhanjali .

  

Do write to us with your review at [nam...@indica.org.in]() by 31st December.
