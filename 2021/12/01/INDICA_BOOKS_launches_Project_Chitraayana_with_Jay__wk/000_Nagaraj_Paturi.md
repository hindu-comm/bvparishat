The vision of this ambitious initiative is to assemble a passionate and knowledgeable set of scholars and photographers, each one a storyteller and aYaatri, to document and share India’s rich cultural heritage through a series of coffee table books. Captured in vivid visuals and words crafting stories told through the experiential eye of the insider who lives and breathes this culture, these works shall inspire readers to walk in the footsteps of ancestors, to discover common meaning, to connect culture and history with current context, and to protect, preserve, and pass on the legacy of a “felt community” to future generations.
