Namaskar,

  

In these two hitherto untranslated but sublime songs of Tagore, translated into English verse from the original Bangla by Sreejit Datta, the poet sings paeans to the Divine Being who is ever awake within the recesses of our innermost core. The motif of the all-seeing, ever-awake Eye binds the two songs together.

Thanks and regards,
