Respected Sirs,  

This is regarding a kannada article on [Manusmriti](https://kn.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%B2%AE%E0%B2%A8%E0%B3%81%E0%B2%B8%E0%B3%8D%E0%B2%AE%E0%B3%83%E0%B2%A4%E0%B2%BF).  

Please click the link and read the article.

It is very apparent that this article has been written with the malicious intent  

of slandering Manusmriti and consequently slandering sanatana dharma.  

  

The hoards of "librandu"s are making a propaganda that this is an

authentic article on Manu Smriti. They are claiming that statements

such as this:

ಬ್ರಾಹ್ಮಣನಿಗೆ ಶುಭ ಸೂಚಕವಾದ, ಕ್ಷತ್ರಿಯನಿಗೆ ಶಕ್ತಿ ಸೂಚಕವಾದ, ವೈಶ್ಯನಿಗೆ ಧನ ಸೂಚಕವಾದ ಹಾಗು ಶೂದ್ರನಿಗೆ ಅಸಹ್ಯ ಸೂಚಕವಾದ ಹೆಸರುಗಳನ್ನು ಇಡಬೇಕು.  

  

have been made in Manu Smriti, based on this article.  

  

When I tried to edit this article, Wiki says that the article is locked for editing.

Apparently, somebody by name "Dr. K. Soubhagyavati" has written most part  

of this article.  

  

I request the attention of both Veera Narayana Pandurangi Sir, and Shrinivasa Varakhedi Sir on this matter.  

  

Kannada Wikipedia has been hijacked by librandus (fake liberals).

Urgent action is necessary.

  

Yours faithfully,

Srinivas
