Respected Sirs,

  

I have happy news.  

  

After writing to you, I also brought this matter to the attention of one Mr. U. B. PAVANAJA.  

  

I understand he has the sufficient authority to modify even locked pages. So, he gracefully deleted  

  

most of the objectionable content. What little is still left in that page is quite harmless.

  

Those who visit the page now can not possibly guess the damage that the author of that page had done,

  

which has now been undone by Shri PAVANAJA.  

  

Many thanks to him.

  

Many thanks to you all.

  

Regards,

Srinivasa
