Dear Dr Yadu

  

Karma isn't that complicated based on what I am reliably told. While some karma is individual, much of it comes from interaction with others and the environment. So there are typically counter parties.

  

The particular passage from the Vishnu Sahasranamam tells of a solution through grace from actions that can provide that possibility.

  

The best known book on karma recommended by very advanced yogis is called

  

Karma Rahasya

By

Sudarshan Singh Chakra

  

However, the book is in Hindi. Perhaps one of you in the group will find it interesting to translate it in English. I will undertake to get the translation whetted by advanced yogis for proper context.
