I forgot to add that the original PDF which was 10 GB in size contained images of collectively adding to 1 GB sizes and when compresses it's size decreased to 91 MB only. Not to mention that I didn't delete any blank page.

Although, the program which extracts images and the program which compresses the PDF, both reported error with the 10 GB PDF file. So, I think that conversion at end-user end is not very fruitful. If KKSU or eGangotri have all images, they can use some simple scripts to decrease the image size and then combine them in a suitably compressed PDF for sharing.
