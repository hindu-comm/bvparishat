Thanks for uploading great resources.

  

I've seen that about 29 PDF of this collection are greater than 10 GB in size, ranging from 10 GB to 41 GB. Other 14 range from 8 to 9 GB. Other 13 from 6 to 7.6 GB.

The quality of these PDF is good, no doubt. But normally these files are heavy on any consumer grade hardware and not suitable for viweing, etc.

When I extracted images from a 10 GB PDF, I found that individual pages have size of about 13 MB each and total 100 pages of PDF, many of which were blank pages created by some software, collectively took only 1 GB space.

It appears that a bad scripting is cause of these huge PDF. Automation not done correctly is bad for the hosting server, [archive.org](http://archive.org), which provides server space to save and share without any charges.

It is similarly unusable by scholars who have consumer grade hardware and hence these PDF doesn't serve their purpose.

  

I've written an email reporting the huge size of PDF to eGangotri. I didn't get any response.

  

I hope they will take care of this problem.

  

If not, then I offer to convert all PDF to a smaller size and share/upload, if eGangotri and KKSU don't have any problem.
