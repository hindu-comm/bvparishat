Dear All.

  

The Enlightened Management of Kavikulguru Kalidas University, Ramtek has most graciously allowed eGangotri Trust to upload there entire NMM Digitzed Scans on [archive.org](http://archive.org).

  

The following is the Upload Location.

We have recieved 5 Hard drives of around 20 TB Data.

  

Manuscripts are being uploaded through an automated script that converts the tiffs to PDFs which is a process surprisingly heavy on my ryzen-5 /16 gb ram /ssd laptop.

  

And the time consumption is why we are only able to do 50+ only in a day.

  

The texts are a combination of old printed books and hand written manuscripts.

  

This is the official Catalog:

At the rate we are going, it could be may be 1 month bfore all these data is 100% in the Public Domain.

  

I will like to take this opportunity to request any one in this Group who are heading Institutions with any Digital Data - to seek our free and voluntary help in digitally uploading them for the wider dissemination of Knowledge.

  

Thanks and regards.

PS. in order to promote Host Institutions and highlight there important role in preservation and post-upload digital dissemination, we have started including a special banner and intro in every pdf as in the attachment below.

  

This will it is hoped simulate a online availibility culture. and healthy competition for achieving this.
