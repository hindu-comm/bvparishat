Hello,

Indian Food - A historical companion by KT Achaya might give you some pointers. Though it was available in [archive.org](http://archive.org), i'm unable to find it anymore. Attachingthe chapter of Aryas from my local copy.

  

Talageri'sbook has a small ref to the argument of Rice and Wheat pp 96-97

<https://archive.org/details/the-rigveda-and-the-avesta-the-final-evidence/page/97/mode/2up>  

  

Two articles by Pvaal in indica are also very good reads on this topic

<https://www.indica.today/long-reads/wheat-and-witzel-sanskrit-indology-cowsmoke-i/>  

<https://www.indica.today/long-reads/wheat-and-witzel-sanskrit-indology-cowsmoke-ii/>  

  

In short Rig veda samhita does not mention Rice (Vrihi) or Wheat (Godhuma).

  

Regards,

Rajeev
