I read somewhere, but don’t remember where, that the Vedas mention rice and barley significantly a greater number of times than wheat. And between barley and rice, it is barley that is mentioned more than rice.

The Punjab and the Northwest, where the Vedas are supposed to have been composed, do not provide a natural habitat for rice. Although rice cultivation is now prevalent in the Punjab, it is through modern artificial means that it is sustained, which include artificial irrigation and chemical fertilizers. The Gangetic plains to the east, and parts of southern India provide a more natural and better environment for rice cultivation.

My questions are:

Is the first statement (the relative frequencies of the mention of barley, rice, and wheat in the Vedas) true?

What are the names used in the Vedas for these grains? Are they yava, vrīhi and godhūma for barley, rice, and wheat?

Was the staple diet of the Vedic people based primarily on barley?

When did wheat become the staple?

How did rice, which was difficult to cultivate in the Punjab and Northwest in the olden times enter the diet of the Vedic people?
