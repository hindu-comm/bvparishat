Hello.

  

I would like to know specific scriptural references from our granthas regarding Vamachara/Vamamarga, which directly mention against using the left-hand path and also detail its negative consequences.

  

It'd be great if someone can share such mentions in the Bhashyas of Sri Madhwacharya and Dvaita tradition specifically, or from any of the great Acharyas from other Sampradayas as well.

  

I'm guessing it might be mentioned in the Dharma Sutras also, but despite research on the internet, I haven't been able to find the exact quotations from original sources.  

  

Please kindly share relevant references if they are available.  

Thank you for your time.
