Namaste 🙏🏻

  

Dear members,

  

I'm elated to share with you our **3rd song** in the series - <https://youtu.be/v6fDu_JRRDA>

  

This journey, to present Samskritam Songs and get them integrated into common man's playlist, has been a sincere effort, to revive Samskritam and make it a mainstream language.

  

Samskritam a container of wisdom is largely untapped. The sooner it becomes acceptable to common man, faster it becomes a source of a quality life.

  

Kindly strengthen S.A.T.T.V.A. in its endeavours towards popularising Samskritam.

  

Share this song with everyone you know 😃😄😀
