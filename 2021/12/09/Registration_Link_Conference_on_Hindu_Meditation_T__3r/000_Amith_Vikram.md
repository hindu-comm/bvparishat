Namaste All,

  

INDICA is pleased to invite you to the final conference of the calendar year 2021 on Hindu Meditation Traditions & Techniques

At this conference, we shall explore meditation across multiple streams of Hindu tradition such as - In Yajnas, Agamas, Upanishads & other Indic traditions. This confluence of different streams will give a holistic vision on the practice of Dhyana as envisioned in our tradition.

  

Over the course of 2 days, you will get to listen to 40 speakers on various aspects of Dhyana.

  

On both the days, the conference will begin with a guided meditation session by Akanksha Damini Joshi.

  

Join us and be part of a practical spiritual experience.
