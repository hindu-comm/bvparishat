Namaskāra

  

I read a verse cited in Saṃskāraratnamālā of Bhaṭṭa Gopīnātha Dīkṣita as well as Śūdradharmatattva of Kamalākara Bhaṭṭa. The source is said to be some Vārtika. The verse is as follows:

  

तानेव वैदिकान्मन्त्रान् भारतादिनिवेशितान्।

विहाय मन्त्रनियमं लोकबुद्ध्या प्रयुञ्जते॥

  

I'd be grateful if you could kindly let me know about the name of the text from which this verse has been cited.

  

Sādaram
