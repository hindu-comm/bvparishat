Dear Scholars,

This is to share with you that my book "Mahabharata 3136 BCE: Validation of the Traditional Date" was presented to the Vice President of India, Sri. Venkaiah Naidu on 27th December 2021.

Soon after publishing my book, I sent a copy of my book to the VPI for his reading with a covering letter explaining why my book should be read. I requested time to meet him in person to present the book and explain the salient features. The Vice president kindly consented to my request and granted me time to meet him at the Chennai Raj Bhavan on 27^(th)December during his Chennai visit.

During this meeting I presenteda Letter of Request based on the findings given in my book. The VPI promised to forward my request letter to the concerned people. Details of the meeting and the contentsof the Letter can be read in my blog here:[https://jayasreesaranathan.blogspot.com/2021/12/presented-my-book-mahabharata-3136-bce.html](https://jayasreesaranathan.blogspot.com/2021/12/presented-my-book-mahabharata-3136-bce.html)

I also utilized the occasion to present him the first copy of my two other new books.

The following links have the details about these books.

[Myth of "The Epoch of Arundhati" of Nilesh Nilkanth Oak](https://jayasreesaranathan.blogspot.com/2021/12/myth-of-epoch-of-arundhati-of-nilesh.html)

And

[When was the First Vedic Homa done?](https://jayasreesaranathan.blogspot.com/2021/12/my-book-when-was-first-vedic-homa-done.html)

In a parallel development, the Secretary of the Bhimanakatte Matha contacted me through my blog in Medium.com regarding the justification I have given in the book for the authenticity of the Janamejaya grant in their possession (pages 148 to 158 in my book). I sent a copy of the book to the Matha and received the blessings of the Swamiji who wants to highlight the findings in my book to the State and the Central Government. The Matha officials have started reaching out to important leaders to recognise the grant and the antiquity of the Matha. I am assisting them in all possible ways in this venture.

Yours sincerely,

Jayasree Saranathan
