I have listed the original sources and they are compiled in this book by Sri Yukteshwar available in the link below.

Disconnect from astronomy and world events makes the yuga cycles and durations ridiculous.

  

The Bhagavatam, which I know inside out and is an outstanding book and is also a book of yoga, has a specific reference to the Buddha too (Gita Press edition). Did Veda Vyasa, in whose line I too come from, write that too?

  

All Indic scripture is experiential both in and beyond the gross body, with experience repeatable by anyone who follows the scientific processes and methods (as listed in the Bhagavat Gita recorded by Veda Vyasa) complied by those who recorded them from experience. It is not for arm chair academics, or what is the difference between Audrey, Wendy, Witzel and us?
