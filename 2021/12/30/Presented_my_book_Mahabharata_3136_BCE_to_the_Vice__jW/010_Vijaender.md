Good luck for what?

  

None of this is light hearted banter.

  

The blind can't lead the blind.

  

The yuga theory is a critical link to the environment for life and progress on this planet in relation to astronomical events in the solar systemand galaxy we are in. The Manvantara for example has a direct relationship with the circumbulatory duration of our sun around the galactic center or Vishnu Nabhi. All the 14 lokas are measured based on their distance from the galactic center. Time and space are nil at the galactic center, closest to which is the Satya Loka from where the duration of the universe's cycle is declared to a day and a night of Brahma. Read the story if Balarama's wife and her father in the Bhagavat.

  

Of what use is putting out just a beginning date and duration of Kali without the broader context? And too an erroneous one.

  

Kali yuga is over. Rising Dwapara yuga is beginning. If the mind is stuck in Kali and its laments as an explanation for everything one sees wrong in this world today, it is your prerogative, BUT NOT fact. But preaching lament and ignorance to OTHERS even after someone like the Sage Sri Yukteshwar has taken the trouble to show the light with evidence of scriptural, astronomical, and world events, can have consequences.

  

Happy New Year!
