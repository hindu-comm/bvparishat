Not sure what you mean by "Ganesha moments" .

  

The issue isn't the date of the Mahabharata... Which has been triangulated independently in many ways. Your dating of that seems fine.

  

The issue is the start date of kali yuga which the internal reference in the Bhagavat and perhaps the Mahabharat are likely in error... Also, the error apparently extends in the Bhagavat calling its dating as the onset of Kali when it was more likely then coming onset of the descending Dwapara.

  

The references to Kali yuga date without a basis in astronomy and triangulation with other independent texts like the Manu Smriti and the Satapata Brahmana may not be valid and certainly does not make intuitive sense based on world and Indian historical events either. Merely using the likely erroneous internal reference of the Bhagavat isn't acceptable, at least to the likes of Sri Yukteshwar consideredfar more credible worldwide.

  

The Kali yuga start estimated by Sri Yukteshwar is around the time of the Buddha. It has a descending Kali of 1000 years followed by an ascending Kali of 1000 with sandhi or confluence periods of 100 for Kali + 200 years each with the descending Dwapara prior and the ascending Dwapara after. Kali according to Sri Yukteshwar is coincident with the Sun in sync with the constellation Pisces or the Piscean Age, which is about to get over.

  

Dwapara has a span of 2000 years each on the descent and ascent with a sandhi or confluence period of 200 years on either side with Treta.
200+2000+100+1000+100+100+1000+100+200= 4,800 years + allowance for some period prior gets you the circa 3000BC for thr Mahabharata.

  

The entire solar cycle with the sun's dual star (tentatively identified in 2017) and in relation to the galactic center or Vishnu Nabhi is 24,000 years, in which we have 4,000 years of ascending and descending Sat, 3000 years each of Treta, 2000 each of Dwapara and 1000 each of Kali plus the confluence period in between. This dating also is pretty accurate for Ramayana and also the appearance of Mahadeva prior. The dating also coincides well the the cyclical greening of the Thar and Sahara deserts, with the Thar cycle significantly impacting the Saraswati River civilization and Vedic age in general. Everything lines up quite well per Sri Yukteshwar's calculations.

  

Sri Yukteshwar called the age we are entering the ascending Dwapara the Acquarian age when the sun begins its sync with the constellation Aquarius. He predicted in 1894 that the age will see the advent of harnessing of electricity, long distance communication, and magnetism starting from 1799 or so gradually getting back to telepathy in a thousand years.

  

Much of what he said has come true even in the short term. Plus, he was dead right about the circumstances of Kali on India for the 2400 year period from around the time of the Buddha. With the bottom of the Kali around the time of the rise of Islam.

  

There is no evidence at all that the cycles suddenly move from the end of the Kali directly to the beginning of Sat, as if that was the Abrahmic Day of Judgement. That would be bizzare as cycles go too.

  

PS

  

If you add the duration of the Kali in all the cycles within a Manvantara, you will get to precisely the gargantuan number for the duration of the Kail mentioned in the Bhagavatam - another indicator of the internal mathematical error in that document. 432,000 years. Divide that by 1200 years for either the descending or ascending Kali period according to Sri Yukteshwar and you get the number 360 divine years. The math for solar and divine years must match. It's all the same number times 360 for the solar equivalent of divine years. Sri Yukteshwar says the Satapata Brahmana and Manu Smriti give you all the details.

  

12,000 solar years of the four ages in ascent or descent x 360 divine years x 71 cycles of divine years = 306,720,000 solar years or one Manvantara. The number and calculations will be slightly off if you use 365 days for a solar year instead of 360 but that's a small margin for error unlike the Bhagavat's.

  

Further, if you check the Mesopotamian and Sumerian math on this.
Exactly the same numbers.
