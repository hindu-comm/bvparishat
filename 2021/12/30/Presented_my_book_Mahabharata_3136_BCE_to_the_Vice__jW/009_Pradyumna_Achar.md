\> The Bhagavatam, which I know inside out and is an outstanding book and is also a book of yoga, has a specific reference to the Buddha too (Gita Press edition). Did Veda Vyasa, in whose line I too come from, write that too?

Yes  

  

\> It is not for arm chair academics

On a lighter note, I'm not an academic and I don't have an armchair :)

  

Good luck.

  

Regards

Pradyumna
