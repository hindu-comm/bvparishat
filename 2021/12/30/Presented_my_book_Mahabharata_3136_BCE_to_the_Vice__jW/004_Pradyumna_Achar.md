Respected Sri Vijayender ji,

  

\> the young rishis who conducted Parikshit's yagna leading to the Srimad Bhagavatam made a calculation error

Do you imply that Maharshi Vedavyasa was not the composer of Srimad Bhagavatam?

  

\> Dwapara has a span of 2000 years each on the descent and ascent with a sandhi or confluence period of 200 years on either side with Treta.

According to which source is this true?

  

Regards

Pradyumna
