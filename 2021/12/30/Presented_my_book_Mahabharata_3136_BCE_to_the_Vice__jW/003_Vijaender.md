With regard to the dating and duration of Kali Yuga, suggest you read Sri Yukteshwar's Holy Science written in 1894. He was a great astrologer too in addition to of course, being Paramahamsa Yogananda's guru.

  

He says the young rishis who conducted Parikshit's yagna leading to the Srimad Bhagavatam made a calculation error by aggregating all the kali yugas in the different cycles within the Manvantara into a one long one. He says the error likely happened because all the seniors had retired to the Himalayas by the time of the yagna and weren't available to correct.

  

Further, he says the Yuga calculation method in the Satapata Brahmana and the Manu Smriti is accurate. Of course, the turn of events in India based on his calculations are very predictable. No one can disagree with that.
