Who is being Honored?

  

 To the best of my understanding the honor is being bestowed on Akahara Bharati.

 This gives rise to the question Who is Akahara Bharati ?

 Honestly speaking, Akahara Bharati is an aspect of समष्टि! which is working towards making our Shastra relevant to ordinary persons!

 So any person who shares the dream of making our Shastra relevant to ordinary person is a member of Akahara Bharati!

 Initially the dream started with a small group and the group expanded for a while but then it became dormant!

 Some of the members of the group came up with a strategy to revive it!

 Apparently, I being the most aged person in the group, has been chosen as an ICON!

 (Just as most of us worship an image or मूर्ति as a representative of ईश्वर!)

 So I request all the readers of the mail to come together to make the above dream concrete!

 Truly very few of us will be prepared to dedicate ourselves fully for the task because of various reasons but I do hope that most of the readers can devote some time to this activity.

 It is a huge task and needs a very large number of volunteers.

 I believe each of us can contribute some-thing or the other towards making the dream concrete.

 The first step could be raising questions to understand what I have tried to express in a crude manner!

  

Regards
