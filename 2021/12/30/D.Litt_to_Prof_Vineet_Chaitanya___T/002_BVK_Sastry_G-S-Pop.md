Namaste



All appreciations to highly respected Prof. Vineet Chaitanya ji who was one of the pioneers decades ago to connect ‘ Indian Language with Computer –Science –Analytics and bring focus on ‘ Panini- Samskrutham for technical reference and ‘Hindi’ for practical outreach’.

His ardent devotion to study and spread message of Gita to young techno-turks on campus, is an effort that needs greater emulation at many other institutions.
