Respected Dr. Shri Vineet Chaitanyaji!

Fantastic!

A true karma-yogi!

I have also been inspired by your vision and dedication; for over three decades trying to do some bit for Vedic knowledge.

The humility and stating great truths in a matter-of-fact manner signifies ensuing true success, for even a dream like yours.

  

Deep regards
