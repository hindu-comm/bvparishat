According to this article, a temple engraving mentions that the chief architect of the Brihadīśvara temple of Tanjavur is “Peruntaccan”:

[Dakshina Meru : The Brihadeswara Temple \| INDIAN CULTURE](https://indianculture.gov.in/stories/dakshina-meru-brihadeswara-temple)

“*Situated near the banks of Kaveri, the Brihadeswara Temple dominates the then capital of the Cholas, Tanjavur. Standing on the highest point in the area, this architectural marvel was built without the use of mortar or any other adhesive. The inscriptions record that the chief architect who executed the plan envisaged by the ruler was Raja Raja Perunthachan (perum meaning big and thachan meaning carpenter). He is said to have built some of the greatest temples of the time which shows that Rajaraja employed the best architects, artisans and sculptors to create this great temple*.”

There is a legendary Peruntaccan (പെരുന്തച്ചൻ பெருந்தச்சன் पेरुन्तच्चन्), a master craftsman who is the hero of many folktales of Kerala (perum = great, taccan = carpenter, sculptur, architect etc., from Sanskrit takṣaka). Included in the *Aitihyamāla* are a few of these stories of Peruntaccan. 

Could it be that the Kerala legends are woven around the real Peruntaccan, the chief architect of the Brihadīśvara temple of Tañjāvūr?


There is an interesting story of Pāṅkuḷam, a temple pond built by Peruntaccan. This pond appears as a square, an octagon, and a circle depending on where the pond is viewed from. This video presents a virtual reality of the pond: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO1ERUbTdws> .

Here are a few stories about Peruntaccan:
