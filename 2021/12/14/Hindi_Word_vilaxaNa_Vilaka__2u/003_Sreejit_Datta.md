Namaste,

  

This capacious word is present in Bangla vocabulary as well, pronounced "Bi-lok-khon". The connotations vary based on the specific context of usage in Bangla sentences:  
  
1. Extraordinary ("*Mahapurusher chinho dekhilo bilokkhon*")  
2. Extremely desirable ("*Bilokkhon bor mago*" - ask for the boon that you desire the most)

3\. Divine, superlative

4\. Unmistakable  
5. Extra  
6. Attractive ("*Bilokkhon beshe jabo*" - I'll go there in an attractive attire)

7\. distorted, different from the usual

8\. Intense ("*Bilokkhon sougandho*" - intense aroma)

9\. More than what one hoped for  
10. Strange ("*Tumi toh bilokkhon lok dekhchhi*!")

  

Ref. *Bongiyo Shabdokosh*, Haricharan Bandyopadhyay, Sahitya Akademi  
   
Thanks and regards,
