I am hearing a Hindi commentator of the Kashi function using the word vilakṣaṇ (विलक्षण) quite frequently as in vilakṣaṇ kṣaṇ. I know he is using the word in a positive sense, perhaps to mean unprecedented, unusual, or magnificent. In Malyalam, vilakṣaṇam (വിലക്ഷണം विलक्षणम् ) is used in a negative sense to mean inauspicious, ugly, grammatically wrong, or that which is not lakṣaṇa yukta.
