Friends,

I will be talking again on "Ten Thought Leaders from India" in a public lecture arranged by the VHP group in Washington DC.

It is Sunday afternoon at 4 PM, an odd time for the scholars in India. People in the US and Europe may be able to join.  

The details are below.  

I learn that a video will be available.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
