वन्दे परमं सत्यम्

I eagerly want to know that what was the ideas were there in ancient India about the conservation of Natural life and most importantly the traces of Environment awareness in the Indic civilization and society.

If you can prescribe some of the books/ Papers/Materials/ Video lecturesregarding that topic, it can be helpful for an insightful study for me.
