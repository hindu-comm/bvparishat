Here is the Editorial of Vol.6 of the  

Swadeshi Indology Conference Series.

  

This Volume is a monograph entitled  

***A Parīkṣā of Three–Dimensional Philology*** (182 pp.)  

written by my dear student Dr. T. M. Narendran (TMN),

examining the new thesis of Prof. Sheldon Pollock (SP)  

on the vital issue of the very foundations of interpretation.

  

For a nice change, TMN has examined the thesis of SP

adopting purely Nyāya procedures : *Lakṣaṇa* and *Parīkṣā,*

*Pañcāvayava* syllogism etc. with very practical applications,

and very interesting and valuable results.

  

None has so far examined a Western(er's) thesis  

on purely Indian-tradition lines : a practical illustration thus of

examining an alien's propositions *through a Hindu lens.*

And the brazenness of the fallacious logic of "the Last Pundit"(!)

has very well been laid bare here by this young and brilliant scholar.  

  

The Editorial gives a foretaste as it were of the book  

which is shortly to be made available to the public.
