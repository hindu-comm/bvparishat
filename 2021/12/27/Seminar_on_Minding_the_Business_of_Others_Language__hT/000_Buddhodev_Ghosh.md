Date: 5 January 2022 (Wednesday, 3:30 PM IST)  
  
*Title: Minding the Business of Others: Language as Parārthānumāna in Mahimabhaṭṭa  
*  
**Abstract:  
**  
If you take the stand, as Mahimabhaṭṭa and the great majority of Indian poeticians do, that literature is a form of communication rather than a mode of self expression, your philosophy becomes inexorably bound with the problem of ‘Other minds’. Henceforth the institution of letters becomes a message transmitted by the addresser to the addressee. Mahimabhaṭṭa argues that all literature is like any other form of linguistic communication and all communication is intended to influence others. The aim of linguistic communication is to create certain behavioural effects in the addressee. According to Mahimabhaṭṭa an addresser can influence an intelligent addressee only through logic and not through the force of oratory. When the addressee is convinced of the logic of the argument, he accepts the proposition and decides to act accordingly. All language thus becomes argumentative in function and inevitably takes the form of a syllogism. The corollary of this view is that without the assumption of ‘other minds’ at the receiving end (no pun intended), it is meaningless to speak about literature and other forms of language. But unfortunately, we know next to nothing about the ontological status of other people and their minds in Mahimabhaṭṭa’s scheme, especially as his extant Vyaktiviveka is silent about the problem and the ‘śāstra’ called Tattvoktikośa written by him which could have discussed the topic is not available to us except in a sole quotation. However, there is not an iota of evidence to assume that the other minds were conceived as projections or extensions of the subject in his scheme. On the other hand, a plurality of selves is implicit in such a scheme. Mahimabhaṭṭa conceives of other minds as rational entities, which can follow logical steps inherent in a syllogism. Inference, especially the one for others, presupposes certain axiomatic knowledge on the part of the language user who is the addresser about the mindset of the addressee. The speaker assumes that the addressee on the basis of which invariable concomitance is demonstrated as plausible. In other words, our self and the selves of others can be linked through language which always appeals to a universal realm of logical relations.
