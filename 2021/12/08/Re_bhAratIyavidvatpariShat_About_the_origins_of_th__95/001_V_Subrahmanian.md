Thanks for your response. On the above point, I think that the theory of error is closely related to the position the respective school holds about the reality of the world. It could be in this context that the khyAti is developed in each school. As we see from the five theories, the two Buddhistic theories are related to the unreality(asat) of the world, at least definitely in the Vijnanavada, in those two schools. As regards the AkhyAti of the Prabhakara mimamsa (which is accepted by the Ramanuja school), and the anyathAkhyAti of the Nyaya, the bhrama vishayaka vastu is real (in nyAya, it is the object seen in some other place that is perceived in the locus now). Both these schools hold the world to be real. Only in the Advaitic theory the bhramavastu is anirvachaniya, sadasad vilakshana and so too the world. I am inclined to think so only after deliberating on the question. Hence it would be interesting to trace the origin of the khyAti concept.

  

Has any ancient school, prior to Shankara, refuted the anirvachaniya khyati? If the mimamsa school has refuted this khyAti, then it follows that this khyAti was in vogue prior to Shankara who is admitted to be post-Kumarila Bhatta. More textual evidencewould be helpful in tracing the origins of these khyAti-s.

  

warm regards
