Good day to all,

  

A short conspectus of the theory of error or ख्याति-वाद.

  

There are in all 14 theories around ख्याति-वाद in our दर्शन-शास्त्र famously called as चतुर्दश-ख्याति-वाद. Out of these 14 different standpoints on the nature and functioning of error / bhrama there are about 6 of them which are widely discussed in the scholastic circles.
These 6 theories fall into two broad groups viz., those who deny erroneous knowledge and those who accept erroneous knowledge.

  

The technical term ख्याति is formed from the धातु or verbal root ख्या which has the root sense प्रकथने and it means \*to tell or to proclaim\*. But the term ख्याति in the दर्शन-शास्त्र has come to mean भ्रम or विभ्रम, like the way shell-silver appearance is. Such erroneous experiences are many and varied as attested by consolidated human experience.

  

Analysis of error like shell-silver involves - perception (बोध), the perception leading to some activity (प्रवृत्ति) and subsequent negation (बाध).

  

आत्म-ख्यातिः (or ज्ञान-ख्याति)

विज्ञान-वाद, सौत्रान्तिक, and वैभाषिक belonging to the persuasion of Buddha propound आत्मा-ख्याति or Subjective erroneous cognition. The word आत्म is understood as ज्ञान here.

  

Silver-shell cognition is merely an inward idea, according to them. If it is so, then, the experience of बोध, प्रवृत्ति and बाध should not have been experienced at all, which only goes to prove that there are external things and we cognize them. Hence, the आत्म-ख्यातिः (or ज्ञान-ख्याति) cannot account for the error satisfactorily.

  

असत्-ख्यातिः

The school of thought called the माध्यमीक-वाद or शून्य-वाद belonging to the persuasion of Buddha propounds असत्-ख्याति or non-existent erroneous cognition.

  

Error or illusion is non-existent like the way a hare's horn is. This is illogical. The erroneous perception of silver is not like a hare’s horn, because hare’s horn is a mere use of words only, with no reference to objects outside of our mind. The perception (बोध) viz., इदं रजतम् has reference to an existing substratum (साधिष्टान) and its cancellation (बाध) has a definite time period (सावधिक) and therefore असत्-ख्याति fails to account for error.

  

अख्यातिः

This view is called by two other names and they are विवेकाख्यातिः or विवेकाग्रहख्यातिः This theory of error is propounded by प्राभाकर-मीमांसक. Their non-apprehension of error as all cognitions are valid according to him. प्राभाकर is of the view that in the conginition, this is silver (इदं रजतम्), there are two conginitions, one is thisness and the other is silverness. The cognition of thisness alone will not lead to activity, similarly, the cognition of silverness alone cannot lead to activity. The correct cognition, this is not silver, definitely points to something that is not present before our eyes. Unqualified cognition thisness and the unqualified coginiton silverness cannot account for the error and thus the argument अख्यातिः or विवेकाख्यातिः or विवेकाग्रहख्यातिः fails.

  

अन्यथाख्यातिः

This view is propounded by the school of logic or न्याय-वैशेषिक-नय. Erroneous cognition here relates to misapprehension. In a qualified cognition such as this is silver, there is the relation between the substantive and attribute.

  

अनिर्वचनीय-ख्यातिः

This view is propounded by the school of मायावाद. Erroneous cognition relating to the indefinable.

  

There others are,

  

यथार्थख्यातिः

  

सदसदख्यातिः

  

अपूर्णख्यातिरूपाख्यातिः

  

अभिनव-अन्यथाख्यातिः

  

सत्ख्यातिः

  

प्रसिद्धर्ख्यातिः

  

अलौकिकार्थख्यातिः

  

स्मृतिप्रभोष ख्यातिः

  

निर्विशेष ख्यातिः

  

^^What was the prasakti, occasion/need, for the various dArshanika-s to specify/develop a khyAti for their darshana?^^

  

Any philosophical thought is incomplete if it didn't address the issue of error and hence every school of thought have forwarded their 'theiry of error'.

  

^^Do the Bauddha and Jaina ancient books talk about these/their khyAti?^^

  

Yes, they do.

  

^^In the verse we find that of the five, excepting the last one, the rest are all of the Bauddha, Mimamsa and Nyaya darshanas. Was it that Advaita was the only Vedanta darshana during those times?^^  

  

If we take the date of श्री-शङ्कर as 1233 years ago, then, 200 years later श्री-रामानुज came, 200 years later toश्री रामानुज, श्री-पूर्णप्रज्ञcame, so, from the historical chronology, the school ofश्री शङ्करcame first, but there were other vedantic persuasions beforeश्री-शङ्कर is attested byश्री-शङ्कर himself in his BSB. (Bhagavan Upavarsha and Bhagavan Bodhagaya and others)

  

If we take the date of Sri. Shankara as 505 BCE as suggested by some scholars, then the historical gap between Sri. Shankara and Sri. Ramanuja is more.

  

Coming to the verse in question, and as you have noted, it is found everywhere and oft-quoted, it's original source I am not sure, defer it to historians on the group to help us,

  

Thank you & Best regards

Subject: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} About the origins of the verse on 'khyatipanchakam'  
  

Namaste

  

I would like to know the earliest occurrence of this popular verse on the five khyati-s:

  

आत्मख्यातिरसत्ख्यातिरख्यातिःख्यातिरन्यथा।

तथा’निर्वचनख्यातिरित्येतत् ख्यातिपञ्चकम् ॥

  

What was the prasakti, occasion/need, for the various dArshanika-s to specify/develop a khyAti for their darshana?

  

Since the khyAti is all about the views on 'bhrama', what relation did this have to their fundamental philosophy?

  

Do the Bauddha and Jaina ancient books talk about these/their khyAti?

  

In the verse we find that of the five, excepting the last one, the rest are all of the Bauddha, Mimamsa and Nyaya darshanas. Was it that Advaita was the only Vedanta darshana during those times?

  

There is an implicit reference to the various khyatis in the Adhyasa bhashya of Shankaracharya. The commentators make the names explicit.

  

Any pointers to the earliest occurrence of the verse or names of the khyatis in any texts is welcome.

  

Thanks and regards
