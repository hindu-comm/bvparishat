In his speech, Indian Prime Minister Modi ji occasionally speaks in a dialect of Hindi which reminded me of the language of some of the Hindi dohas learnt during high school Hindi classes. What is the name of this dialect? Is it the current Hindi dialect of the Kashi region? Or is it an older dialect of Hindi that is no longer an everyday spoken language?
