Good news. It is the need of the hour.



The name sounds like it will emphasize the Indian knowledge systems, which is very important. My humble suggestion, if there is someone from the establishment present, is that it has to aim at credibility and undeniability, not merely for us but for the academics around the world.



The word *rishi* denotes a person who sees truth. Our ancients had the motto 'आ नो भद्राः क्रतवो यन्तु विश्वतः' and interacted with the then intellectuals of the west, and also treated them as *rishi*-s. It seems the Greek astronomers were regarded as *rishi*-s, as seen from the *sloka* -

म्लेच्छा हि यवनास्तेषु सम्यक् शास्त्रमिदं स्थितम्।  

ऋषिवत् तेऽपि पूज्यन्ते किंपुनर्वेदविद्-द्विजः॥

It is said to have been quoted by Varahamihira.

  

My suggestion would be that the new university may have courses on ancient Greek, classical Latin, Persian etc., so that our scholarswould be equally well

informed of the western intellectual traditions and heritage. At present we witness some amount of disdain or ridiculing of Indianwritings by the western writers who claim to have knowledge of several classicallanguages whereas only a handful of Indian scholars seem to have knowledge of those traditions.
