 Namaste All,

  

We have often discussed the lack of higher education institutions in India that authentically represent our Indic thought.[Rishihood University](https://rishihood.edu.in/), coming up near Delhi, is an attempt to build a university thatchanges this. There are other institutions like Chanakya University coming up in Bengaluru and we already have HUA and VaYU in the USA. Building high-quality institutions is a long and arduous journey. Rishihood University will be formally inaugurated on Saturday, 18th Dec in New Delhi.

  

Request yourkind presence and blessings. Please have a look at the email below for details.

  

शुभं भूयात्,
