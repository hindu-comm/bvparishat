Namaste Ravi Ji,

  

Thank you for pointing out this lapse. My old Sanskrit grammar book (संस्कृतसहचरः) lists सप्तविंशतिः/सप्तविंशः as alternate forms. But विंश is clearly पूरणप्रत्ययान्त. Interestingly, the book does not list विंशतिः/विंशः as alternates. I believe that you are right but I have also referred this matter to a grammar scholar for advice. I will edit that word accordingly.  
  

Thanks,

Kushagra
