Dear Kushagra,

We did project your Narmada recitation on the big screen at Cambridge Public Library

on Saturday. It was a lovely and proud moment. Long years ago, I had moved to

enable Sanskrit recitation in University events. Though still some way to go, you are

showing the path. I admire your pioneering effort.

Congratulations..

Bijoy Misra
