In vaidika philosophy they talk about 3 levels of understanding. adhyatmika, adhibhautika, adhidaivika.

  

The definitions of these 3 terms vary a little depending on the granthas.

  

Beyond the devatas is the concept of Brahman or Atman of the Upanishads. So if we just remove the devata aspect of these 2 groups of works of nayanmars and azhwars, is it possible to arrive at a unified philosophy? this is my question. It is said the devatas are medium to achieve atma-jnana. You can find more information in indra-pranadhikarana when indra advises pratardana : ma'am upasva. Hence Brahman or Atman is a higher level antaryami level concept beyond the devatas.

  

Some of my teachers have told me that, the type of devotional statements are very similar in these two sets of works.

So if you ignore the deities shiva and Vishnu, are the experiences of these saints very similar or different?

  

This is my question.
