*The Veda in Kashmir*presents a detailed history and the current state of Veda tradition in Kashmir. It traces the vicissitudes of Vedic texts and rituals and their survival during some 400 years of Muslim rule. The peculiarities of the*Śākalya Ṛgveda*,*Kaṭha Yajurveda*, and*Paippalāda Atharvaveda*texts are discussed in great detail. The rituals from birth to death of the Pandits, the Kashmiri Brahmins, are depicted and explained, including current interpretation.

This two-volume work includes a DVD that contains additional texts, rituals, sound recordings, and films taken in 1973 and 1979.
