Dear Dr Yadu-ji,

  

The book is just out. It may take some time for the tradition-insider response to such studying from outside kind of accounts.

  

There were many insider responses Prof. Witzel's works. One that comes to my mind is the one by Sri Vishal Agarwal to "Ein Fremdling im Rgveda" by Prof. Witzel.

  

Sharing the same.
