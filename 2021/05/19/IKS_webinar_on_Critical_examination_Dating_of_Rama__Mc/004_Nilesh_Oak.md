Thank you professor R N Iyengar Ji for posting an article by Dr. Dieter Koch Ji on my dating of the MB war.  
  
1. This was a discussion that took place a while ago and if I recall you were very much the part of the email chain.  
--  
All

  
2. I encourage all of you to read the article by Dr. Dieter Koch to comprehend the level of academic/scholarly discussion in the MB dating research space.  
3. When I offered to discuss all the astronomy evidence of MB text, including 5+ descriptions of Saturn, 4+ descriptions of Jupiter, 8+ descriptions of Mars, 5+ description of Venus, 4+ descriptions of Mercury, AV observation, Bhishma Nirvana evidence, phases, and positions of the moon through 18 days of the War, Dr. Deieter Koch ran away (with tail between the legs). If he is part of this he may respond with either agreeing with my description or denying it.  
4. I offered him to have an open debate (uncut, unedited, on camera). He never responded.  
5. I wrote 10 part series (based on his and my interaction via email -witnessed by many Indic researchers). I am posting the link to Part 1 of 10 below. Do read all 10 parts.
