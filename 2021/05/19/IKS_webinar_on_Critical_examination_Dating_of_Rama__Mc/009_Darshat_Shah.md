Hello Shri Nilesh,

Could you kindly provide some more information about the "Institute for Advanced Sciences" where you are adjunct faculty? I cannot seem to find a proper website for it.

  

Shri Sanjeev Panchalji,

Do you really represent govt of India or is this "Indian Knowledge System" a private institution? I second the comments earlier that the website is amateurish, as if hastily put up with no information at all. Please provide some context about your management, who established it, work done so far, etc. so we may better verify how govt of India is sponsoring all this (with my tax payer money).

  

Regards,

Darshat
