That appears to be the case. This inads does not appear to be part of any university - just happens to be in a town called Dartmouth. There is an outgoing link to Center for Indic Studies at UMass but not the other way round. Google street view of the address shows some kind biz park. Many of the "faculty" listed appear to have day jobs in India while others are into Biochemistry, no courses being taught, so all in all it appears to be a pretty odd institution.
