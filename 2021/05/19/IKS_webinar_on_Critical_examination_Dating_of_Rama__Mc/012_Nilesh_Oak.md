Dear Darshat Shah Ji

  

1\. When I posted the website address for INADS.org, my virus protection program declares it as a suspicious site. You may try INADS.org. I could visit it just fine. I o not know the reason behind it. I have experienced this one site administered through India. Only FYI.

2\. While on the subject, would you tell me more about yourself and your interest in INADS? I will be happy to connect you with the appropriate individual if any specific area of INADS has sparked your interest.  
  
Warm regards  
Nilesh Oak
