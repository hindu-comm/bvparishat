It is interesting that an income tax commissioner is the chief guest at this talk. Taxing our credulity about this flawed foray into India's past beyond the last glacial phase? Is this what happens when higher education projects are parceled out by the Ministry of Human Resource Development?

  

By the way, is there an Indian knowledge "system" or are there systems? The website --<https://iksindia.org/>-- is amateurish, offering the visitor no clue about who are the people and institutions behind it, supporting it, or shepherding the project/institution.

  

And, as if to contradict themselves, they list "systems".

  

A haphazard use of lower case and upper case letters in their project details is indicative of the lack of professionalism, whoever the babus and bhaktas behind it.

  

It is yet another indication of how much this present government has to learn about putting the right people in charge of energizing and redirecting Indian higher education.

  

Regards,  

  

Ramesh Rao
