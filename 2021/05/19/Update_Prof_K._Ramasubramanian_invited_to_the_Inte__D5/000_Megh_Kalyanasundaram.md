Namaste,

  

I recently learnt thatProf K. Ramasubramanian has been invited to deliver a Distinguished Lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) 2022.

  

ICM, as some may know, is amongst the most prestigious events, if not THE most prestigious event (held once in four years), in the domain of Math, during which the Fields medal, the Nevanlinna prize, the Gauss prize and the Chern Medal is conferred.

  

Hearty congratulations to Prof. Ram!

  

Sincerely,

Megh
