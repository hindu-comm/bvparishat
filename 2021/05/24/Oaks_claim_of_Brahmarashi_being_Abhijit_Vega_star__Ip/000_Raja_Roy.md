Dear respected members,

I had requested "Astronomical Society of India" on Twitter to verify the claim made by Oak of Brahmarashi being Abhijit (Vega) star. This is the reply by Dr. Aniket Sule (Ph.D. in Astrophysics and current curator ofPublic Outreach and Education Committee of the Astronomical Society of India, Twitter@asipoec).
