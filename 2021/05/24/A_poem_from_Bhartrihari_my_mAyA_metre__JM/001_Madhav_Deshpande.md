Dear Marcis,

  

  This verse is in the mixed meter called Upajāti, which is a mixture of Indravarjā and Upendravajrā. The first three pādas of the verse you cited are in the Upendravajrā meter, while the last line is in Indravajrā. The difference between these two is simply that the first syllable of Indravajrā is guru, while the first syllable of Upandravajrā is laghu. Otherwise, the rest of the syllables are identical. Best wishes,
