Namaste,

  

As already pointed out by Prof. Deshpande and Prof. Steiner, this meter is generally known as उपजाति (that is, one of the hybrid class of meters produced by combinations of इन्द्रवज्रा and उपेन्द्रवज्रा पाद-s).  

  

प्राकृत पिङ्गल सूत्राणि (2.122) enumerates specific names for each of the 14 different उपजाति combinations that are possible, and there, माया is the name given to this particular combination (the first 3 पाद-s as उपेन्द्रवज्रा and the 4th पाद as इन्द्रवज्रा). So, if you saw this meter referred as माया somewhere, that source is not 'wrong'. However, I think it would be better to say that, this meter is an उपजाति, more specifically, the particular उपजाति variant called माया. Most people would not care which particular variety (out of the 14 possible) of उपजाति it is.

  

As Prof. Steiner has already mentioned, प्राकृत पिङ्गल सूत्राणि (in su# 2.159 in my copy of the Kavyamala edition of the PPS) also defines a particular kind of 14-वर्ण समचतुष्पदी समवृत्त meter as माया (also called पदमत्तमयूर). Obviously, that 14-वर्ण समवृत्त माया is *not* to be confused with the माया variant of उपजाति mentioned above.
