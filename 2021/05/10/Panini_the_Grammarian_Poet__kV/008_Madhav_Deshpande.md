Dear Sridatta Ji,

  

  Thanks for giving the link to the Kannada article by Shri Shatavadhani Ganesh Ji on Pāṇini's poetry. I don't read Kannada, but will see if Google can translate it for me. I have attached the pdf of an 1891 article by Professor Peter Peterson that collects citations of Pāṇini's verses. With best wishes,
