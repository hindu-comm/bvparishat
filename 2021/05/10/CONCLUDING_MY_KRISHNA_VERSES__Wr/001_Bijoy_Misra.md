Well done!

  

Congratulations.

  

Bijoy Misra  

  

PS. You can read a selection of the verses in our Harvard poetry meet coming Sunday.

We are tight in schedule, about ten nature-related verses could be OK.

But the timing may not suit you. We start 10 AM US East Coast Time to accommodate our participants in India.  

We have four Sanskrit submissions including our own Kushagra Aniket from BVP.

Let me know privately
