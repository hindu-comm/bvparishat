Dear Prof Madhav Deshpande,

Warm Regards.

All good things also come to an end; this also has now.

  

I have indeed no words to express my gratitude. The Krishna Verses (since 2 yrs) have made substantial contribution to my life. My day started with your verse.

  

However, I will not miss even now as, by God’s Grace, senses prevailed upon me to write down about 500 verses as my daily ‘लिखित जप’ and I can recite the same (one each day) filling one year. Every verse is प्रासादिक with माधुर्य, delighting not only yourself but also others.

  

Whether I am right or wrong, I conclude that you are an evolved person and will continue to be beneficent to persons like me.

  

With Best Wishes for future Contributions.
