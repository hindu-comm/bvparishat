Namaste



Need more help in understanding the statement \< This is where all bhashykaras failed to understand Vedas. \> :



 Who are the ‘ bhashyakaaras covered in this sweeping statement please? What have they missed ? hidden OR kept the ‘silence’? explained somewhere else ? as the key missing issue ?

 The Vedic mantra with the term \< पथिकृत्) \> is in
live usage in ‘Pitur-Karma’ and some major Samskaras even to this date. 



Regards
