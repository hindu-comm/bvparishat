Namaskar to all.

  

I have no issues with people who accept these vedabhashyas as pramana. I respect their beliefs.

  

But the fact is different.

  

The situation would have been totally different if our bhashykaras paid atleast ten percent attention to the purport and meaning of Vedas.

But mostly their attention is on forms.

  

While Western commentaries have progressed a little, still I can say the same thing to them also. No fear of condemnation, ridicule. I am now free to announce it. Sometimes back we had discussed वाक्येन वाकं etc.

  

I am sorry to say that bhashykaras have failed in their mission. I can add only one word "mostly" because of some exception. they might have shown a path to others by paving the way to others to go on. It is not to demean their efforts. But we have to accept the fact.

  

It is same in shastra area also.

We have failed in our mission.

We could have done something very best philosophy had we opened our eyes. But mostly people are dogmatic.

  

I can not simply put it here dingmantra. I will actually write a new bhashya based on facts.

I am writing it.

I have already written detailed commentary on purusha sukta, four Vishnu suktas, and first two suktas of rgveda. This process is continuous. It needs full attention that is only possible in lockdown time.

  

I request all the scholars here to help us in our mission to build up new commentarial tradition of Vedas that is based on indian way or rather shastric way.

  

I request help in the form of prepublication review, financial support or whatever way you can do.

  

**I will send my commentary if any of you are interested to thoroughly review if before publishing.**

  

Some of my friends have helped me in this regard. Thus I am going on to write a full commentary on first mandala of rgveda.

  

It is a totally new beginning.

Help us.
