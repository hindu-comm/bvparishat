My humble opinion is a summary disposal of all *bhāṣyakāra*-s

as having failed in understanding the Veda-s may not reflect the truth.

And Dr. Ramanujachar is a "*veda-vāridhi*" not merely by title.

  

Guruji Golwalkar was once requested by a student abroad to tell him about Yoga

when the student was accosted with some questions. Golwalkar famously asked:

Can I give a postal coaching on *prāṇāyāma*?

Of a class with it is Dr. Ramanujan's retort:

Can I teach the Veda on line? :

Very Natural.

  

One needs to include the wisdom of :

"*anvaicchan devās tapasā śrameṇa*":

that imparts us with a new capacity, a new faculty.  

(After all, was it not said even of understanding poetry:

"*śabdārtha-śāsana-jñāna-mātrṇaiva na vedyate*" ?)

  

Ultimately, it is the "*padavit*"

that can become a "*pathikr̥t*".

It is the knowledge of *this* path, essentially:

"*tayordhvam āyann amr̥tatvam eti*".

Geniuses can sometimes devise newer paths:

"*prayogair yukti-kalpitaiḥ*".

  

All I can give is some pointers.
