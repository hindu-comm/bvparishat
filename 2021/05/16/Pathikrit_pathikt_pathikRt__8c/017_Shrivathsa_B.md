हरिः ॐ,

  

"ten percent attention to the purport and meaning of Vedas.

But mostly their attention is on forms."

  

All this is unnecessary hand waving. How are you sure it is not 1% or 9.9% or 0.01%?

  

"I can add only one word "mostly" because of some exception."

E.gs?

  

"I can not simply put it here dingmantra. I will actually write a new bhashya based on facts."

No bhāṣyakāra forbade any future bhāṣyakāra. We welcome your efforts.

  

"But mostly people are dogmatic."

Who and what dogmas? How are you going to avoid dogmas in your approach?

  

"I have already written detailed commentary on purusha sukta, four Vishnu suktas, and first two suktas of rgveda."

Pl share so that we can all benefit and weigh it per your standards.

  

  

"I request all the scholars here to help us in our mission to build up new commentarial tradition of Vedas that is based on indian way or rather shastric way."

Request based on yet unsubstantiated assumptions. It is my view that almost all ancient and many modern commentators have followed the śāstrīya way only.

  

स्वस्ति,

    भवानीभारती विजयतेतमाम्,

                     श्रीवत्सः ॥
