Dear Prof Pandurangi,

I admire. Lately we have a RgVeda reading group, we meet every Friday for three hours.  

We hardly cover two suktas in a session. Our goal is to see how the words are formed,

check geography and sky conditions. We do see where the interpreters are carried away.  

It is a massive piece of archaic text, it does need scholarly overhaul and first principle  

interpretation. Some words may need to be set contextually in time. It certainly needs  

strong cultural familiarity. You and your students may just fit the requirement.  

We would love to read your material when ready.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
