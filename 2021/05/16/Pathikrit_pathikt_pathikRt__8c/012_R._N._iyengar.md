Dear Prof.Pandurangi,

Namaste.

Your work marks the beginning of a new direction in Vedic studies. Please include "adhidaiva" interpretations also in your commentary wherever appropriate.

Numbers, that appear in the Vedas could not have been arbitrary. This aspect also needs attention.

  

Regards

RN Iyengar
