Namaste



1. Sri VP has taken courage to clearly articulate our ‘current helpless- hapless- confused state’ in ‘ understanding and benefitting from ‘vedas as given, taught, practiced’.

It is a bold step and an insider voice that must be respected and attended to. I admire his courage to have articulated and taken one more step to defend his view.



 I, and many others sail in the same boat; and conveniently use to find exit-excuses –shelters under Gita ‘ (2-42): veda-vaada-rataah’. 



 Pushing doubts below the rug is not a healthy way of solving the case. **The question of VEDA-VINIYOGA** ( as addressed by Shaunka, Yaska; and repeated by Dr. Yadu in many posts) needs to be clear. 



2. I am open to understand the approach of Sri VP, as a path breaking effort of insider to revisit Veda-artha-jijnyasa. If world has taken Harvard as authority to ‘ translate- interpret- align and correct- Vedas’, and traditional teams have lived with such outcomes for three centuries plus, what is the difficulty now ? The position stands ‘ I/we have unsolved puzzles in learning-using- getting benefits claimed for ‘Veda-abhyasa’. If history centric approach solves it, or ‘ mystic centric approach delivers the benefit’ ? Only an honest exploration can say.



Like Sri VP, I too have worked out my ‘working analytical tools’ of ‘Vak-Yoga’ and making small inroads. Restoring ‘Vedanga –Sampradaya of learning using Samskrutham Language-tools is one of them. The semantics of Veda may probably need much more than ‘adhi-diava’ approach; that is only one of the several layers to unpack the ‘ Veda-sukta’ before getting further to the point of ‘Veda-Darshana’.

Sri Aurobindo studies also needs a revisit in light of Sri Kapali Shastry’s writing in Samskruth.



I do recall ‘ a wonderful program at Udupi, which addressed the theme ‘ anantaartha vai vedah’ , where in ‘anarthaka vai vedah’ was also debated in the divine presence of Gitacharya.



3. Leaving apart that, stepping back a little: May I be helped to get a clarity on our expectation from ‘Vedic studies- Practice- Protection-propagation’ ? 

Why Veda? If we have not understood what is ‘Veda’ ? How Veda ?




 **Probably this pushes up a debate on ‘ Non-Translatable Sanskrit’ to a different zone of ‘ Deliverables from Vak-Yoga-Samskrutham: The language and method used by Gods to Vision
Vedas’.**

**वेदाभ्यास- वेदरक्षा- वैदिकयज्ञ- कर्म-संस्कारैः - वेदान्तप्रवचनदिभिः वा, किमस्माभिः (ब्राहमणैः इति वा / हिन्दुभिः / धार्मिकैः इति वा) अपेक्षितम् ? **

**यथा पतञ्जलिना स्थापितम् ? अथ वेदानुशासनस्य प्रयोजनानि कानि ? केन प्रयोजनेन वयं वेद-पुरुष उपासनां कुर्वन्तः स्म? **



With respects, no hurt or malice intended for any one ( faith does not need support of logic)
