Pāṇini and his wife, an imagined conversation

  

पाणिनिराह - “अयि कान्ते कुपिता त्वं निपातनं मा कुरुष्व भाण्डानाम्” ।

भार्या प्राह - “भ्रान्त इव कान्त कुरुषे निपातनं त्वमपि शब्दानाम्” ।।

  

Pāṇini says to his wife: “O dear, you are angry. Please do not throw down pots and pans.”

The wife replied: “O dear, as if confused, you also throw around your words.”

  

\[Occasional listing of words without derivations is called निपातन by the commentators.\]
