Respected members,

  

I had sent the following email to Prof. Saini, IEEE Pune Chapter. Since the email has been released to public on Twitter by Mr. Nilesh Oak, I am sharing it here. I have done nothing wrong in trying to save the reputation of a reputed engineering society. I have made specific allegation against Mr. Oak's work in this email and I have made them in full sincerity.

  

Best regards,

Raja
