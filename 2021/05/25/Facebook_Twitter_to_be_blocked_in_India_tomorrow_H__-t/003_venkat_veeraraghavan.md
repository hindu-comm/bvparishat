Dear Dr. Kannan,

  

On a side note is*asthigata-prāṇa*mentioned in any shastras apart from Srimad Bhagavatam (the part where Brahma appears before Hiranyakashipu) and parAshara smriti? Is it possible to have a full (more complete) list from your wide readings?

  

Thanks.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
