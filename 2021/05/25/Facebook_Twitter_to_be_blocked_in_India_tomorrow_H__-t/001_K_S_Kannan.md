From the stage of being *asthigata-prāṇa,*

humans are said to have become *annagata-prāṇa*.

Now they have "progressed" to being *mobile-gata-prāṇa*

or, in particular, *twitter-gata-prāṇa.* If these are removed,

many may become *insta(nt)-gata-prāṇa!  
*

  

Śakuntalā was Kaṇva's *bahiścarāḥ prāṇāḥ.*

And now, Facebook is *bahiścarāḥ prāṇāḥ* for so many!

  

The unscrupulous can enslave so many beings

\- nay, entire nations !

Or perhaps, only Singapore and China are not spineless.

We will shortly know where we stand.
