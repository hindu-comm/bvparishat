Namonamah,

  

In Tamil Nadu one would find mārī-ammā (or ambāḷ) deified in almost every town and village, Mārī is viewed as a mainstream śākta traditional deity (at least in TN-Hinduism) and is not a fringe deity.

  

Corona-mahāmārī api tasyāḥ rūpameva.  
  
Regards,

Ramakrishnan Suryanarayanan
