Webinar on Case Reports for Ayush Clinicians

\*26 May 2021 (3.00 â€“ 5.00 pm)\*

  

The COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed the Indian health care system. Ayurveda clinicians are contributing and treating many cases of COVID-19. The clinical learning has to be documented systematically in form of Case Reports. Considering the need, a Case Report Workshop is being organized to encourage and help AYUSH clinicians to prepare Case Reports for publication in peer-reviewed and indexed research journals.
