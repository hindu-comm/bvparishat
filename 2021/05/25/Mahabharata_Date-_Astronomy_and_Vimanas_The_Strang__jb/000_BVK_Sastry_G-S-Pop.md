Namaste 



One more Youtube link: The world telling us with more evidence from outside of India, to look back at our own language and heritage-history.




 Title: **The Strangest Historical Events, Megalithic Structures and Archeological Discoveries** - 221,439 views•



 **Premiered May 12, 2021**- <https://youtu.be/KGqkY6d2WJg> - Almost a 170 minutes watch time,
**Connected with Stanford Research Institute Initiative**.



 Connected with Stanford Research Institute on Classical antiquates, with textual references, Science touching QM ! UFO,

Archeology, Astronomy, Planetary Positions and Stellar alignment, Bronze evidence, Language, Telepathy, Remote sensing, Brain to Brain direct communication……..



**Ancient Secret Discoveries** - Erich von Däniken takes us beyond the myths and legends which have shaped our view of history, to present an alternate view of historical events, megalithic structures and archeological discoveries.



**Carefully watch and listen: 2.35.27 to 2.45 where reference is made to Mahabharata and Mayans, the Vimana-Technology, The ‘Coded language-documents of Yoga-Sciences/ Samskruth’, the difference between Temples and Pyramid (tombs), The error filled Translations based on which ‘ Hindu-History of India’ is maintained ! **

****

# **If this interests, continue watching to <https://youtu.be/xWVA6TeUKYU> - ( another 120 minutes watch) **The Antikythera Mechanism: A Shocking Discovery from Ancient Greece.

May be of interest to those working on ‘Date of Mahabharata’ and ‘ Veda- Translation and Interpretation’ and help them to take stock of ‘Yoga-Samskrutham’ from a different perspective.

‘Panini holds key to our understanding the ancient Samskruth resources – for Science and Spirituality’, Jnana and Vijnana.

‘Postcolonial study of Panini is way off from the standards set for Samskruth study for Science and Spirituality benefits.
