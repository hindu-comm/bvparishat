Dear Gauriji,

I just heard your marvellous talk.

Let me compliment you to have continued the great tradition of teaching in India.

Not many analyze, people use new words to cover the previous word.

You continued the Shankara tradition with clarity and patience.

Hope many more students would emerge.  

Congratulations.
