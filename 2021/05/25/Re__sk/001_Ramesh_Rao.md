Dear Dr. Panchal,

  

You say that "we are studying the views and the data collected by various Authors/Research Scholars, etc".

  

Who are the scholars included in the "we" because IKS website does not list any of the scholars or experts who are affiliated with IKS.

  

You also say, "We are listening and studying the facts in detail and whatever data we collect shall be examined to see whether it contains verifiable and logical data."

  

Again, there is no indication as to who the "we" are, and why are "we" here at BVP asked to buy into your claims that some anonymous group of scholars, whose credentials and bona fides we do not know are weighing "logical and verifiable data".

  

This opacity on the part of IKS is baffling, troubling, and to put it mildly, suspicious.

  

Next, you claim that "Such data shall be accepted, rest all will be rejected. However, we shall not stop here and that particular research paper, containing verifiable and logical data to various historians and all the IITs for further examination and validation". Really, I wonder what kind of protocol this is for scientific and scholarly inquiry. No other country in the world, unless it is some authoritarian or totalitarian entity, will have this weird mix of the loose, lax, complicated, and tangled web of peer review. God save us!

  

IKS, as part of the Ministry of Education, is indicative of this government's amateurish forays into higher education and scholarly inquiry.

  

Would you please convey this to whichever bureaucrat who heads the IKS initiative, please?

  

Ramesh Rao
