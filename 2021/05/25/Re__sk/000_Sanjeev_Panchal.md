Namaste

  

Indian Knowledge System has been conducting various webinars that promote Ancient Indian Wisdom. For that, we are studying the views and the data collected by various Authors/Research Scholars, etc. We are listening and studying the facts in detail and whatever data we collect shall be examined to see whether it contains verifiable and logical data. Such data shall be accepted, rest all will be rejected. However, we shall not stop here and that particular research paper, containing verifiable and logical data to various historians and all the IITs for further examination and validation. After the due validation and corrections done by them, we shall compile and publish the paper. Therefore, hearing the thoughts of Nilesh oak, should not be taken as an endorsement of his views.   
 In case you happen to know some scholars working in this field, you can notify us. We shall look into the data provided by them and thereafter interact with them. After we have interacted with all the Scholars only one paper found containing logical and verifiable data will be accepted.  
 Therefore you are once again requested to forward the names of all the scholars, who you think for doing authentic research in this field.  
Thank you.  

  

  

Regards,

Respected Sir,

  

With deep regret and dismay this mail is being written regarding your decision to host a webinar on Critical examination : Dating of ramayana and Mahabharata by Sh. Nilesh Nilakanth Oak on 19 May 2021 as i am afraid that this decision from your end has not been taken after proper background research about Sh. Nilesh Oak and his research. Shree Nilesh Oak also organised a webinar in IEEE Pune where he addresses many young students with all his distorted theories and jargons on our ancient scientific and spiritual scriptures.

  

I am presenting some scientific facts based on logical and factual grounds and theories which can be verified as they are available in public forums. Also I have shared several screenshots for your reference.

  

1\. His work is rooted in intellectual dishonesty as he claims 600 confirmations, when they are either dependent on each other or are analogies. He has not shown any claim about the list of 600 corroborations from Ramayana and 200 corroborations from Mahabharata and also didn't show that these claims are independent, which they need to be in order to dismiss the clear evidence of Ramayana and Mahabharata.

  

2\. He dismisses direct evidence of Ramayana and Mahabharata and in his several videos he presented our Rishis and scientists in a condescending manner by saying that they are not genuine. In his recent video at Sattology he claimed that all Puranas are unreliable and only his theory is scientific. Link given below.

3\. He attacks other scholars, researchers, scientific history enthusiasts with severe condescending and rhetorical words and sentences. Often those rhetorics become abuses and slang, in open public forums. Kindly see the attachments

IMG 1 - abusing respected scholar Dr. Manish Pandit,

IMG 2 - calling every other researcher as 'folks' and with no logical acumen and also threatening others to block and remove if they don't agree with his views.

IMG 3 - claiming himself as lion and other respected scholars as 'folks'

IMG 4 - abusing Dr. Ram Mohon Roy, very respected PHD research scholar,

IMG 7 - disrespecting Dr. Jayasre Saranathan, PHD scholar.

The list is long and this is just the tip of the iceberg.

  

4\. He has been refuted by several scholars and at present he was invited by many scholars to come for open discussion but he never accepts the challenge and instead abuses and trolls them either through fake profiles or through paid troll accounts.

  

5\. Here are fews critically acclaimed links of refutations to Nilesh Oak's jargons and distortions. Several other such books and blogs are available in public forums where all the deliberate fallacies and distortions were pointed and called out.

This book has exposed all agendas of Shree Nilesh Oak but till date he hasn't refuted this book or accepted any open debate to defend his claims.

Your institute is a reputed academic and scientific organization and represents the education system of India.Kindly take due diligence urgently before hosting an intellectually dishonest researcher who is hell bent to credit his own theory to such an extent that he discrediot our Shastra and all the evidences and ideas given in them by our ancient rishis. This kind of distortion will lead to corruption of young minds.

  

  

There are more than 50 scholars and researchers who have done or are still doing excellent research in the field of Ramayana and Mahabharata. Many scholars are also researching under several prestigious religious organisations and all agree with our ancient rishis and their wisdom and traditional date of Kali Yuga beginning and Mahabharata war which is around 3101 BCE and 3136 to 3138 BCE. But Shree Oak forcefully used wrong methods of western astronomy to fit his theory solely to get recognition, name fame and maybe national awards. He wants to corrupt young minds by promoting his jargons by introducing them into mainstream curriculum. He has also managed to somehow brainwash Prachyam to make documentary on his dates only thereby completely discarding hard works of other present day scholars and scientists and our ancient rishis.

  

Kindly rethink the above plea of mine so that you don't end up promoting another modern Romilla Thappar and William Jones.

  

Sincerely,

Shivoham

a truth seeker
