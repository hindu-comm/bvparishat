Namaste



On \< an *ab ultimo* dictionary \> : Who are the willing partners pl, to pitch in support for this project ? KSK’s note has pointers to multiple dimensions of this project.



Years ago, on this august forum, I had pitched my voice for a similar exercise.



The call was for ‘Review- Upgrade and Revision of Existing Sanskrit dictionaries for text-context –references’ to bring an alignment with tradition of morphology and Semantics per Vedanga tradition.



Suggested starting being ‘Monier Williams’ – which has yielded many popular Indian Sanskrit Dictionaries’ .
