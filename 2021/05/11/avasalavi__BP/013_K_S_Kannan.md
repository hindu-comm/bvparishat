Thank you for your kind words, dear Sastry.

  

As to a further etymological/grammatical exploration,

what could be of help here is an *ab ultimo* dictionary

which can present us all words ending in *-vi*,  

(especially adverbial in nature/function if any)  

that can aid an understanding of any possible  

commonality of sense issuing therefrom.
