Dear Vishvas Ji,

  

  Thank you for such detailed documentation. Your passages make it clear that अपसलवि/प्रसलवि form a pair. What is linguistically interesting to me is now the form प्रसलवि. It contains the change of सर्>सल्, indicating a likely eastern variant, similar to सरिर/सलिल in the Atharvaveda, but the prefix प्र retains the र. Some indications of dialect mixtures in ancient north India. In any case, these forms now raise the next question. Is the ending -वि found in any other forms? With best regards,
