The physical action is one thing, where we do no more than turn a limb or some accoutrement  

this way or that. The real focus may be on directions to conduce to *prāṇa-gati*  

which may have to be different each for *deva-kārya, pitr̥-kārya (*and *laukika-śuddhi/aśuddhi* etc. too, similarly):  

*prasaraṇa/apasaraṇa* etc.may have reference more to that than to the mere physical activity.

The physical activity may have a faint reflection of the internal *gati*, but sufficient to induce that *gati*.  

The difference between Western gymnastics and Indian, or rather the Hindu, yoga may lie here.

Just a surmise.

  

All technical terms need a great deal of *adhyāhāra*, known essentially to the actual

knowledgeable practitioner in the field, even though others, and especially the lay,

may have their own, often somewhat crude, understanding of the same -  

which is often their undoing in respect of doing justice to the proper word signification:

they feel they know, yet they do not in fact, and it gets difficult to convince them.

  

Very simple terms like *vivāha, upanayana,* and *purohita* could be easy examples.  

The knowledge of the *dhātu*-s and *upasarga*-s helps no doubt, but it is only when the same is informed by  

the essential purpose, that the forms and functions get correlated with terminology  

in fuller significance.  

  

Speaking more mundanely or simplistically, *to compute* and *to calculate* might have meant  

the same thing more or less - at some point in history, or in some register; but the words  

*computer* and *calculator* mean quite different things, not necessarily known to or derivable by  

a mere grammarian. Technical word-formation is quite a discipline by itself.  

  

The impulse or tendency to see and interpret as per current notions of sociology/anthropology/

psychology/history or allied fields (which are all in no wise unvitiated by modern ideological politics,

and keep mutating - quite like the viruses), really ultimately takes us nowhere, or rather, can very well  

land us in profound confusion.  

  

We must rather try to catch the *r̥ṣi-hr̥daya,* in the context of Vedic *ācāra*-s, which can by no means quite easy.

All the external accoutrements such as grammar and lexicon, geography and history, can and do help no doubt  

to some extent, but they cannot determine everything: it is the nothing-morism that poses a problem.  

  

Sorry for the prolixity. Took the occasion to digress on what I felt was a more important/related issue.
