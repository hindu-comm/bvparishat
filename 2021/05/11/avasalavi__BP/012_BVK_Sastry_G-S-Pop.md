Namaste KSK



Good post, Good points raised to highlight course corrections needed
for Samskruth-Research . 



You are right in spelling out what is ‘ VINIYOGA’ as Dr. Yadu keeps highlighting in many posts. Your observation points to this in
Samskruth Social Usage : \< Very simple terms like *vivāha, upanayana,* and *purohita* could be easy examples. The knowledge of the *dhātu*-s and *upasarga*-s helps no doubt, **but it is only when the same is informed by the essential purpose, that the forms and functions get correlated with terminology in fuller significance.** \>.



Good summation :



1. \< We must rather try to catch the r̥ṣi-hr̥daya, in the context of Vedic ācāra-s, which can by no means quite easy. All the external accoutrements such as grammar and lexicon, geography and history, can and do help no doubt to some extent, but they cannot determine everything: it is the nothing-morism that poses a problem. \>



2. \< The real focus may be on directions to conduce to *prā**ṇa-gati*
which may have to be different each for *deva-kārya, pitr**̥-kārya (*and *laukika-śuddhi/aśuddhi* etc. too, similarly):
*prasara**ṇa/apasaraṇa* etc.may have reference more to that than to the mere physical activity. The physical activity may have a faint reflection of the internal *gati*, but sufficient to induce that *gati*. \>.
