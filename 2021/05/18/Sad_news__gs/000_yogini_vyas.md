Respected all,

  

This is very painful that Dr.Shantikumar Pandya, a great scholar of Sanskrit ( retired professor from St.Xavier's College

  

(Autonomous) passed away yesterday due to Covid.

  

Dr Santikumar Pandya was a recipient of a prestigious " Sahitya Gaurav Puraskar" of Gujarat Sahitya Academy and very good

  

speaker of 'Mahabharat.'It is irreparable loss for Gujarat.

  

Om Shanti.

  

Yogini Vyas
