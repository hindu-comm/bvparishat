The sad news string is unfortunately continuing...

My prayers and sincere condolences to his family members and all his friends and well-wishers. I have read many of his emails on this group. He was kind and patient to correct my thoughts on one occasion. He was very gracious to respond to the email that I had sent regarding one query. He was an ardent devotee of Shri Ram.

  

May his soul rest in peace.
