Oh my God! what has come upon us. Every day we hear such sad news. I am still reconciling from the passing away of Prof.Lakshmi Tatachar.

Pt. A K Kaul was a staunch Vedic Hindu steeped in the intellectual and cultural traditions of this country.

We had so many correspondences with each other on ancient Indian astronomy.

Shantih shantih shantih.

Dear Sir

Let us pray to bring eternal bliss to his Atman.

Kindly intimate your group/known members.
