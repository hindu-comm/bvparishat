Where, in the Samhita parts of the Vedas, do we find mention of the concept of rebirth? Or words like punarjanmam? And where do we find mention of the concepts of karma and karmaphala? Is there a mention of the word Brahman (ब्रह्मन्) in the Samhitas? Also, does the concept of a formless, qualityless Brahaman, beyond the confines of kāla, deśa and nimitta (time, space, and causality) come only in Vedanta, not in the Veda Samhita?
