GRETIL Rigveda page is here:

  

<http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/corpustei/transformations/html/sa_Rgveda-edAufrecht.htm>  

  

It is searchable.

  

May check for 'brahma'.

  

It may give samaasas and taddhita rupas derived from brahma also.

  

The meaning in each of those words may be different.

  

But brahma being at the root should be interesting.

  

Some of the forms and meanings are certainly connected to / the same as the Upanishadic 'brahman' .
