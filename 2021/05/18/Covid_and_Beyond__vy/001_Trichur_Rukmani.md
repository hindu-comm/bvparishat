Kannanji has raised a very pertinent social phenomenon i.e. the plight of the purohitas. I also read somewhere that purohitaseven find difficultyin finding brides as they are rated very low in socialcircles.Some serious thought need to be given to this urgent situation. The seminaries in otherreligions train their religious priests thoroughly not only in their own texts but also teachthem the other religious traditionsas well. So let us come together and come up with some constructive way in which we can raise the self esteem and social status of our hardworking purohitaswho are paid a pittance for their services.
