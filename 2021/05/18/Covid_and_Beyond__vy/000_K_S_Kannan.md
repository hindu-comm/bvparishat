Very disheartening to hear of the deaths of so many

\- especially many Sanskritists - and poignantly,

some of them quite scholarly though quite young!

  

What makes no news at all, as somebody was grieving on another platform,

is the death also of so many *purohita*-s - who too are veritable corona-warriors -  

making bold to perform the *apara-karman*-s of so many  

despite the constant threat \["hanging like the Damocles' sword" as they say\].

They are, too, in their own right, protectors of our heritage:

uninsured unsung unrecorded heroes (in an ungrateful society?) though they are.

  

Even in normal times, is there any Quality Improvement Program for them?

Don't they need workshops that aid and assist them in upgrading their knowledge -  

knowledge of Sanskrit (to say the least),  

knowledge of the Veda-s,

meaning of the *mantra*-s they employ,  

symbolism they abound in,

comparative study of (practices in) different Vedic *śākhā*-s,  

and of different sects and subsects (among the various *varṇa*-s),  

authentic editions of texts needed by them,

certain specialisations under expert guidance,  

benefits of academic journals and conferencing,

yogic training/practices conducive to their health and profession  

etc. etc. ? :  

all these are, indeed, conspicuously absent.  

  

Owing to many such systemic lapses too, no wonder many are not

giving the best of service to society. The day should come when many  

among the educated love to serve in this field, doing great work in a key arena.  

  

Aren't there full-fledged theological colleges wrt other religions  

where these are properly trained etc. ?  

  

Indic Academy cannot take up everything, no doubt. Already,

a very onerous task is being handled by the organisation.

It can, perhaps, inspire people/organisations to attempt to serve this field too  

(if such work is not already being done systematically that I know not of).
