 There is an excellent book in English on Ornitology and an impressive, but not so huge list of Flora in India in German. About Fauna in India there is only a book I'm aware about dogs. Advice wanted.

 You better do not trust most of the dictionaries, because they say, that पुष्कर «blue lotus», क्रौञ्च «the curlew or snipe» и एणी «female antelope» - and that is not really so. For that reason I would love to hear some stories around some mistakes in the dictionaries regarding the taxonomy and some stories how to get around them with trustable sources:

  

1\) Flora

Renate Syed: Die Flora Altindiens in Literatur und Kunst, Dissertation, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München 1990

2.1) Ornitology

Birds-in-Sanskrit-Literature.pdf

<https://yadi.sk/i/n0_UxdyO3PDTKk>

  

2.2) Fauna

Bollée_Gone to the dogs

<https://yadi.sk/i/rSWR_NnclCTXFQ>

  

I've have found <https://www.biodiversityofindia.org/>, but it does not contain far too many of the 1750 Latin plant names I was able to extract from Monier-Williams (<https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/simple/>). What other good reference works online or scanned books would you recommend, please. Some major (not only Indian related DB would be of interest as well).
