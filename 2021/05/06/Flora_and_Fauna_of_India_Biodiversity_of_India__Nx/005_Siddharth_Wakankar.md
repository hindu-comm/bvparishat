Sir,

  

Dr.Sundara Rajan's [D.Litt.is](http://D.Litt.is) a very veritable source book.I had the privilege of evaluating it as an External Expert.

  

Umaswati or Umaswami,the Jain scholar of the first century A.D.,is supposed to be the first scholar in Sanskrit to give a botanical classification in his Tattvarthadhigamasutra.

  

The other papers of Dr.S.Rajan are already enumerated by Prof.Nagaraj Paturi.

  

Best of luch in your search and research.

  

Prof.Siddharth Y.Wakankar
