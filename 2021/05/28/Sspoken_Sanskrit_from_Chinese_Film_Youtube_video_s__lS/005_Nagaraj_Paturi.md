Several contemporary popular traditions also exist regarding Bodhidharma's origins. An Indian tradition regards Bodhidharma to be the third son of a[Pallava king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallava_dynasty "Pallava dynasty")from[Kanchipuram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanchipuram "Kanchipuram").^([\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhidharma#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKambe2012-14)[\[note 3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhidharma#cite_note-Dravidian-16))This is consistent with the Southeast Asian traditions which also describe Bodhidharma as a former[South Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India "South India")Tamil prince who had awakened his[kundalini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalini "Kundalini")and renounced royal life to become a monk.^([\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhidharma#cite_note-Krishna-17))The Tibetan version similarly characterises him as a dark-skinned[siddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhar "Siddhar")from South India.^([\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhidharma#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEdou1996-18))Conversely, the Japanese tradition generally regards Bodhidharma as[Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_people "Persian people").^([\[web 1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhidharma#cite_note-Tojo-19))
