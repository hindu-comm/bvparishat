Dear Nagaraj Ji,

  

  Yesterday, I watched this entire 2 hour film, and liked it very much. I had read the account of Xuan Zang's travels in translation, but this film makes his journey and experiences so visually vivid. Like his travels from China to India, numerous Indian Buddhist teachers traveled to China, Tibet and some evidently as far as Japan. However, we do not have any descriptions of their travels available to us. I am wondering if there are any examples from pre-modern India of Indians traveling abroad and writing down their travel experiences.
