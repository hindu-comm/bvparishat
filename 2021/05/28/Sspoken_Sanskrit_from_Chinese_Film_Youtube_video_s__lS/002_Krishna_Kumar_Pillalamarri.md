Thank you sir, for sharing this video. It is even more stark now as to how badly Bollywood, media and general public have slipped in representing the real view of our classical educational institutions, and have misled people. It also shows a happy intermingling of chinese and Indians. Makes me nostalgic.

  

Best Regards,  
  
Krishna
