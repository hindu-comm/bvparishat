au contraire...

  

The Ramayana of Valmiki is one such documents Rama, Sita and Lakshmana travel to different lands, there is mention of Sugreeva'speregrinations to avoid Vali.

The Mahabharata has brief accounts of Arjuna's wars of conquest all the way to the borders of the legendary lands of Shambhala.

A lot of these accounts are very brief in treatment, sparse of details that delight the annalist's heart.

  

And then there is Bhogar's accounts of his travels to China.

and thePallava prince's travel to Shaolin....the one who was called Bodhi dharma...

  

I am sure there are many many more such accounts.
