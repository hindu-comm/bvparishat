Conference Dates: October 28-29, 2021.

  

The Center for Global Polytheist & Indigenous Traditions is pleased to announce a call for papers for its first online conference “Polytheisms Today and Tomorrow” to be held on October 28-29, 2021.

“Polytheism” is a sometimes contentious term for traditions with an apparent multiplicity of objects of religious regard, but much of the contentiousness around it arises from the prejudice monotheist hegemony has imposed upon that multiplicity of the divine which ancient civilizations celebrated. Traditions falling under this contested rubric today face many common challenges, having survived racism, colonialism, religious bias and missionary pressures. Other traditions of this character were sundered, but are being revived, demonstrating that conversion is not the end of their story.

The Center seeks abstracts for an online conference dedicated to the preservation and promotion of polytheistic traditions both continuous and revived from anywhere in the world. In addition, this year’s conference will feature a special panel focusing on African Traditional Religions curated by Prof. Tapiwa Praise Mapuranga of the University of Zimbabwe.

The sections of the conference will include:

-   Polytheism in the study of religions: theoretical and methodological
    issues -   Practical issues facing polytheistic traditions in the contemporary
    world -   Revival of sundered traditions and renewal of continuous ones -   Regional focus: African Traditional Religions

Papers should aim for a reading length of about 20 minutes. Please send abstracts of approximately 500 words to Dr. Edward P. Butler, Director, CGPIT ([epb...@gmail.com]()) for sections 1-3. For the section on African Traditional Religions, inquire with Prof. Mapuranga ([mapsp...@yahoo.com]()).
