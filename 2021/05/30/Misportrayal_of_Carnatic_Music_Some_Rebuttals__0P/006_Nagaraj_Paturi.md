Asserting the Hinduness of the aesthetics of carnatic music and mixing it with any other textual content or visual representation as sacrilege protects carnatic music from appropriation by non-Hindu cultures and traditions.

  

Similarly declaring obscene visual representation or mix of Hindu Bhakti, Yoga and other spiritual music or its lyrics as an offence against the Hinduism under constitutionof India may provide a legal protection.

  

One of the objectives behind Indic Academy's conference on Hindu Aesthetics

  
<https://www.indicacademy.org/>conference-on-hindu-aesthetics-call-for-papers/  

  

is such an assertion for all Hindu arts and aesthetics.

  

Please go through the detailed concept note and I request the members to share their response to the ideas in the note maybe in a in a separate thread or here as suitable.
