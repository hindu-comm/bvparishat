Dear Scholars,  

   Namaste.

  I downloaded QB64 for 64 bit to be used on Windows 8.1:

   <https://www.qb64.org/portal/>

  

  But I am unable to use the step by step execution available earlier with F8 command.

  Similarly F9 is also not displayed.

  The concerned developers of the 64 bit version of QuickBasic may please take notice of this.

  Thanks and regards

   Narayan Prasad
