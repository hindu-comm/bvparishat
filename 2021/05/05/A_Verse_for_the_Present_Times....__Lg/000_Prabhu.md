Sharing a verse I composed... relavent for the present difficult times:

  

योऽरक्षत्‌ कृपया प्लवाश्रित-चरान्‌ पाशेन कल्पान्तरे\*

ह्यावर्तै-र्बृहदूर्मिभिश्च सहिते क्षुब्धाम्बुधौ दुस्तरे ।

काले संप्रति विप्लवेऽ-तिविषमे प्रान्तेषु सर्वेषु नः

संकष्टोदधि-तारणो स हि भवेत्‌ मत्स्यावतारो हरिः ॥

  

ITRANS:

yo.arakShat kRRipayA plavAshrita-charAn pAshena kalpAntare\*

hyAvartair-bRRihad-Urmibhishcha sahite kShubdhA-mbudhau dustare \|

kAle saMprati viplave.-ativiShame prAnteShu sarveShu naH

saMkaShTodadhi-tAraNo sa hi bhavet matsyAvatAro hariH \|\|

  

Who protected with (his) kRupApAsha, during the kalpAntara, the jIvA-s sheltered in a "plava" which was in the tumultuous and unnavigable ocean with gigantic waves and rip currents, may he, hari of matsyAvatAra, become our rescue-ship in the ocean of difficulties during the present viplava and ativiShama times in all the regions.

  

\*kalpAntare can be changed to manvantare since the matsyAvatAra occurred between the previous (ie., chAkShuSha) and the present (ie., vaivasvata) manvantara-s.

  

\*Many thanks to Prof Kannan-varya and vidvAn Ujjwala mahodaya for their offline comments and suggestions.

  

Regards

Prabhu
