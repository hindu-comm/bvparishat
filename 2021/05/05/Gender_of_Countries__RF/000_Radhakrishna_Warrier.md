In Indian literature in general, countries are personified in the feminine. India is personified as Bhāratāmba, as Mother India. We say Vande Mātaram. However, in most Indo-Aryan languages, a country is treated grammatically in masculine or neuter gender.

  

In Hindi:

भारत जीतेगा not भारत जीतेगी

मेरा भारत महान not मेरी भारत महान

  

In Gujarati, I think countries are treated as neuter gender grammatically.

  

પાકિસ્તાન હારી ગયું (Pakistan lost – neuter gender) not પાકિસ્તાન હારી ગઈ (lost – feminine) or પાકિસ્તાન હારી ગયો (lost – masculine).

  

I think this is applicable for most Indo-Aryan languages –- countries are personified as feminine but grammatically treated as masculine or neuter. This is quite interesting, especially for persons like me in whose mother tongue the verbs do not undergo any person, number, or gender changes.
