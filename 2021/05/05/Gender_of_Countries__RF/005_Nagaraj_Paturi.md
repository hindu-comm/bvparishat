Though this has been discussed in this list earlier too it does not hurt bring up once again.

  

It is not correct to conflate the feature of grammatical gender (form of the word deciding the gender) of Sanskrit with the feature of
semi-semantic semi-grammatical (meaning of the word deciding the gender in some words and form of the word deciding the gender in some other) of the present north-Indian languages and the feature of semantic gender (meaning of the word deciding the gender) of the south Indian languages.

  

The idea of Bhaarata maataahas nothing to do with these linguistic features of Indian languages including Sanskrit.

  

The idea is culturally rooted.

  

Viewing human settlements like villages and forest localities as a village goddess /forest goddess has been a millennia old widespread pan-Indian (probably/suspectably global) practice.

  

As Prof. Kannan pointed out , ideas of the Earth as goddess (Bhudevi, Bhumata) have Vedic roots.

  

Modern ideas of Bharata maataa can be traced culturally to these ideas.

  

Semantic gender of most Indian languages facilitates expressing this cultural idea conveniently.

  

Sanskrit has the facility through its feminine forms connoting the earth, to communicate this modern idea.
