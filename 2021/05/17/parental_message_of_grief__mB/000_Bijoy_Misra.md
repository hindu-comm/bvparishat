Dear Sri Ashish,

First I admire that you could hold tears and acknowledge your daughter's

passing away. I do recall the messages from her and her sensitivity and

humility. As a father of a daughter in professional age, I fully share your

grief and pain. Daughters are special to the fathers. We all grieve at your

loss. Do hold courage and wade through this difficult period. Do write  

privately or through messages to share life. We are a family.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra

in US.
