Namaste,

My Sanskrit teacher gave another Explanation to the below last shloka of तोटकाष्टकम्

............................................

विदिता न मया विशदैककला ।

न च किञ्चनकाञ्चनमस्ति गुरो ॥

..............................................

हे गुरो ! मया विशदा एककळा न विदिता । एवं नकिञ्चन काञ्चनम् अस्ति (मया न विदिता)

O Sankara ! The Pure Un-relational Consciousness is not known by me ; and am unaware that there is nothing valuable than that consciousness.

The above meaning is another dimension contrary to the the Known meaning that "I don't know a single branch of knowledge and neither do I possess any money as dakshina to offer".

Regards,

PV Sriram
