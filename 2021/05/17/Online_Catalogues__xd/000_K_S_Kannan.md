\[Very\] slowly, some of our libraries have been waking up to publishing on-line catalogues.  

  

Has anybody compiled as yet a repository of the library catalogues of various Indological institutions - in India (and all over the world)?

  

Should not there be a standardised cataloguing system (giving the fullest possible details of each book) so that the time and efforts of a researching scholar are saved to the maximum extent?  

  

Can Indic Academy make some attempt in this direction? It is not an individual, after all, but only an institution that can keep a constant vigil and keep updating and upgrading things from time to time.
