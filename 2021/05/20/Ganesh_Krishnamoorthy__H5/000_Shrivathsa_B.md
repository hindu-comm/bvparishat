राम राम,

  

 A great vidvaan and a great friend shrii Ganesh Krishnamoorthy has passed away today due to Covid.

  

 He was an expert in a range of subjects and his collection of books is a vidvaan's delight. He was a practitioner of shriividyaa and was an anuShThaana-shuura. He had done adhyayana kf Yajurveda and used to travel about 400 Km every weekend (before covid) to learn the jaiminiiya saamaveda.

  

 Heart breaking to see so many young vidvaans pass away in quick succession.

  

स्वस्ति,

   भवानीभारती विजयतेतमाम्,

                   श्रीवत्सः ॥
