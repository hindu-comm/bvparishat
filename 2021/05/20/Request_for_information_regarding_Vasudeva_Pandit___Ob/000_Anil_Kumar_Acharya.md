Respected Scholars

Namaste

Could any one in this group enlighten me on the identity of the author Vasudeva Pandit and his text mentioned in the following verse. It would be of immensehelp to me.

इति श्रीजानकीजानेरद्वैतब्रह्मपण्डितस्यात्मजेन

शतघंटावधानकृत्वा वासुदेवपरब्रह्मपण्डितेन

विरचितं जगन्मोहनवृत्तशतकं सम्पूर्णम्॥

(The Jaganmohanavrittashatakam written with attentiveness for hundred hours by Vasudeva-pandit, the son of the Advaita scholar Sri-Janakijani (Sri-Ramachandra?), comes to an end.)

With regards
