Dear Prof. Sundareswaran,

Quite a famous verse.

I only wonder how you missed its sense.

  

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  

The idea of the poet cannot be caught in words.

But it only flashes via some "green"/"juicy"/"pregnant" words.

Connoisseurs however capture it, and thrilled at the lofty idea,  

they experience horripilation.

Overwhelmed, they remain but silent.

  

And rare are such high-class sahr̥daya-s,

and I salute them with folded hands.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  

  

Hope this gives the gist.

Anvaya now should be a simple business.

  

(You are welcome if you have a better explanation,

or some questions reg. my own understanding.)

  

Namāṁsi

KSKannan
