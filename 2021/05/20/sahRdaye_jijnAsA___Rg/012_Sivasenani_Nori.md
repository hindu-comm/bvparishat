It may be that the poet wants to emphasise the non-verbal component of communication, which is said to be as high as 93% of total communication in day-to-day settings by those who study it.

  

What are examples of non-Sabda-based communication? A pat on the back, warm hand-shake, a hug, a touch on the elbow, an aprastuta prasaMSa, an unusual remark in the context such as 'svasti te' by Maarica to Ravana (in the poem given below - may be it is more than viparItalakshaNA), kaaku, an approving look, a smile, casting down of one's eyes etc.

  

किं नु शक्यं मया कर्तुमेवं त्वयि दुरात्मनि।  
एष गच्छाम्यहं तात स्वस्ति तेऽस्तु निशाचर।।3.42.4।।
