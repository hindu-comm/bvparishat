Namaste



Please help and explain what is this ‘stylistics’ : \[
PARENTHESIS-STRUCTURE – (SAMSKRUTH –WORD –LAYOUT )- of SAMSKRUTHA
SLOKA \] ; 

What is ungrammatical split disrupting the language-convention of
Samskrutham- for ‘pada-vibhaaga-anvaya’ : like spelling based analysis using ‘ end of character’ markers ??

Why and How ‘accent marking’, for what intention on a classical sloka ?

Is the marker a suggested way to ‘recite the sloka’ like ‘ veda’ ??
Or does it carry special semantic analytical (undisclosed ?!) significance ?? for Samskruth analytics ??



Thanks in advance for the help.



Regards

BVK Sastry
