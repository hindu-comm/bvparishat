vidvadbhyo namaH

  

I was reading about rice and sugarcane fields in raghuvamsha and about the shAligopyaH who used to protect the fields (and sung raghu's prowess).

  

Searched a lot regarding scarecrows but couldn't find much info online. Hence this query.

  

Were there other kinds of gopAs ? How were crops protected from pests/birds/animals in ancient India?

  

Any pointers for the same is greatly appreciated.
