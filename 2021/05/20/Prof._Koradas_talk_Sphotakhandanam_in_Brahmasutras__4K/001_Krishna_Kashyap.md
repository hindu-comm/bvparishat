Namaskar Sri Nagaraj Paturi Ji,

  

Are these different talks arranged by Advaita Academy published on youtube?

  

If so kindly send the links. I missed a few talks. I could attend a few live lectures.

  

I am referringto all the talks including the ones by Sri Korada Subrahmanyam Ji.

  

*Best Regards,*
