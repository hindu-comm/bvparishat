Dear Chinmaya Vidyapeetha,

  

  

What you are doing is the following

1\. Introduce a Christian term / meme / idiom to someone who may have never heard or even be opposed to that meme.

2\. Retrofit our practice into that term / meme / idiom.

  

Is our language / idiom so barren?

And why will the reader tuned to christian idioms ever come to take 2? You are doing free propaganda of Christian memes. Why not go the whole hog and call Veda as Pslams?

  

It is an utter lack of rootedness and an urge to appear more christian than christians that makes you do this. You have a good image as a Hindu organization. Please don't jeopardize it.

  

स्वस्ति,

   भवानीभारती विजयतेतमाम्,

                   श्रीवत्सः ॥
