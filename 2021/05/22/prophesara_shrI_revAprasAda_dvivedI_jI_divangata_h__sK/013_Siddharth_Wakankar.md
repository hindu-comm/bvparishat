Dear Dr.Soma,

  

How are you.  

  

Pandit was published since long from Varanasi and was edited by Pt Revaprasadji.Now,it seems to be defunct.

  

Some years ago,i think,Prof.Ashok Aklujkar wrote a ling article about it.

  

You may directly contact him.He is on this list also.He may be in a better position to help you in this regard.

  

We used to get this journal in exchange of our Journal of the Oriental Institute, Baroda.

I do not know it's present status.

  

Warm regards and thanks.

  

Prof.Siddharth Y.Wakankar

Vadodara.9427339942.
