namaste.

  

Also, Shri Siva Senani-ji , as you may already be in the know, 

in the Editor's Note section of his critical edition of Kalidasa's works, "Kalidas Granthavali",

MM ShrI Dvidedi-ji discusses several issues with Mallinatha's commentaries of Kalidasa's works.

  

I have attached a clipping of the Foreword to "Kalidas Granthavali" by the late Prime Minister Shri P. V. Narasimha Rao.

  

Deep condolences! May bhagavAn bestow sadgati upon him.  

  
Reagards

Prabhu
