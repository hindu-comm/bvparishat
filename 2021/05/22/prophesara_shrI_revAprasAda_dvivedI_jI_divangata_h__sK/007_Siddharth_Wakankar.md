I had the privilege to help him in procuring copies of rare manuscripts of Shringaraprakasha and help him in collating the original [mss.in](http://mss.in) our Oriental Institute.

  

As a token of appreciation, he presented a copy of the two volume set of that to me and acknowledged my help therein.

  

He had invited me for a dinner at his residence and showed the huge library of books on almost all the subjects.

  

We had a very cordial relationship.

  

He was a genuine scholar gentleman, very rare to find now a days.

  

I send my pranam and pray the Almighty to grant him sadgati.
