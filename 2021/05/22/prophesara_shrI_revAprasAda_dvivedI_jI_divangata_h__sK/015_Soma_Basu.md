Respected Prof. Wakankar ji,

Sorry for the late reply.

Thankyou so much for your prompt mail.

I am fine.

I believe you are in fine health.

Yes I came to know about 'Pandit' from Prof. Samiran Chandra Chakrabarti many years back.

I know it does not exist today.

How can I get the article by Prof . Aklujkar ?

Best regards,

Soma Basu
