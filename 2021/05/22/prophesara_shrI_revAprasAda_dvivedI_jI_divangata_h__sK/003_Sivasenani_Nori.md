Prof. Dwivedi in his commentary on the Dhvanyaloka said that Acharya Abhinava Gupta super-imposedhis own views on Anandavardhana about what Dhvani is and showed the instances. Abhinavaguptacharya is a colossus in Indian philosophy and poetics, and differingwith him cannot be done lightly. Such was the confidence and scholarship of Prof. Dwivedi that he did so - and to my knowledge, this has not been refuted. Mm Pullela Sriramachandrudu, in fact, followed the same line in his translation of Dhvanyaloka and Locana.

  

I pay my homage to the great scholar.
