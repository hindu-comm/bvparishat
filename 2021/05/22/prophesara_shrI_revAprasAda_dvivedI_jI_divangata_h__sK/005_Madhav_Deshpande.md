This is the saddest news so far. As a university student from Pune, I met Professor Reva Prasad Dwivedi twice at the Kālidāsa festival in Ujjain and I was most impressed. After that I wrote to him a few times and he promptly responded. Later my wife and I visited him at his home in Banaras. Dwivedi Ji represented the best of the Sanskrit tradition along with a critical eye in editing and interpreting Sanskrit Kāvya and Kāvyaśāstra works. A luminary indeed is now lost. Feel very sad.
