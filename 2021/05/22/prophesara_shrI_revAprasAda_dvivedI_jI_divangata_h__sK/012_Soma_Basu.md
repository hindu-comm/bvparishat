Namaste!

  

I had heard about a journal named ‘Pandita ‘ (I may be corrected if I am wrong ) which used to be edited by Mahamahopadhyaya Shri Revaprasad Dwivediji long back. I shall be much obliged if respected members could throw any light on this matter .

My deep condolences to the great soul !

  

Best regards,

Soma Basu
