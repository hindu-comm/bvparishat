Respected Scholars,  
  
Namo Namah. Hare Krishna to all.  
  
A friend of mine who has a background of Sri Vaishnava sampradaya,  
shared with me that in his knowledge of traditional practices,  
reciting (Bhagavad-Gita or any) slokas in a standard rigid fashion (as  
it is practiced in any traditional Gurukulas wherein one has to  
pronounce the syllables with considerable force) has been discouraged  
for ladies in general. They can recite them in a singing pattern, but  
are discouraged to do so in a forceful manner.  
  
I am eager to know the validity \[ and if possible, the possible  
reason(s)\] of the said practice(s) regarding Sloka-recitation (not  
Mantra recitation). Kindly help me to get clarification on this matter  
as I am supposed to provide answer to my own community of Vaishnavas.  
Apart from the query, if any thing else is also necessary and useful  
in this regard, please feel kind enough to share it with me.  
  
Thanks in advance,  
--
