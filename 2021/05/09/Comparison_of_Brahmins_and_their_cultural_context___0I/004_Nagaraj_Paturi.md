Dr Finnian M M Gerety in his recently published "BETWEEN SOUND AND SILENCE IN EARLYYOGA: MEDITATIONON “OM” AT DEATH", announcement of which I shared in this list, brings out the link between the the Greater Magadha thesis of Prof. Bronkhorst and his thesis that “the Brāhmaṇical contribution to the origins of Yoga is nil!” Sri Finnian argues , " if meditation on om—a mantra-based practice—is integral to ouroldest sources for yoga, then Brahmans must have played a significant role inshaping early yoga." Talking about this link between these two these of Prof. Bronkhorst, he says,

  

> "According to Bronkhorst, non-Brahmanical ascetics in the northeast of > the Indian -subcontinent, forming part of the civilization he calls > “Greater Magadha,”developed the physical austerities and > contemplative practices we now think ofas yoga, albeit using > different terminology. While conceding that Brahmanswere the first to > use the Sanskrit term yoga as a label,Bronkhorst denies that > theyplayed any role in the formation of early yoga beyond naming and > appropriation.Nor does he mince his words, asserting that “the > Brāhmaṇical contribution to the origins of Yoga is nil!” and that “the > Brāhmaṇical direction was not Yogic in itsorigins and did not become > Yogic later on.” For Bronkhorst, early yoga > wouldseemtobeacasestudyin“howtheBrahminswon”17—howBrahmans > shapedthecultural landscape of ancient India by co-opting religious > ideas. Although less polemical,recent work by Geoffrey Samuel reaches > a similar conclusion about thenon-Brahmanical origins of yoga."
