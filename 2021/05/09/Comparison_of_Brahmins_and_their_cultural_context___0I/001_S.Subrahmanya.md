Dr. Houben,

Thank you very much for bringing this to the attention of the larger group of scholars.

  

I wonder what kind of "theoretical model / comparison" would allow this ?

It is appalling and alarming that that the Canadian taxpayer is sponsoring this kind of bigotry.

The Canadian - Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council & the Kule Institute at UofAlberta must be ashamed of this.

  

regards,

S.Subrahmanya
