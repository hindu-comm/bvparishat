Yes, Subrahmanya garu.

  

Not only on this occasion Prof. Houben has been bold to call a spade a spade and stand by the truth.

  

He does not belong to the category of Indologists who hate the texts, their language and culture that is the focus of their academic discipline.

  

He has been academically rigorous questioning those who resort to academic politics or political academics in the name of Indology.
