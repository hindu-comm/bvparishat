Dear Caley,

In your reactions I think you have put the finger where it hurts, where the comparison is indeed entirely fraught.  

I especially like your remarks:

\(1\) ... the middle (even late) Vedic situation ... derives directly from a real pastoral/horticultural mode of subsistence in which pasturage/fields are not part of self-idealization but actually the basis of food production.  
(2) ... the focus is really on the poetic-priestly tradition and these patrons as the audience.

\(3\) ... we would speak of Vedic "ceremony-networks".

It is remarkable how arguments about ancient India often try to move around on the map monolithic and mono-linguistic communities, without inner differentiation and inner (social, sociolinguistic) dynamics.

Your work is an exception, as is the work of Heesterman and a few others.

All best,

Jan
