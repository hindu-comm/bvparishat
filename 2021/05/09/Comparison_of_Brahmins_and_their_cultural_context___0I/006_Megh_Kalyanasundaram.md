Greetings Dr. Houben,

  

Allow me to join a few others, to thank you, for sharing the threads you have recently shared, in BVP.

  

Since the center-piece of the series is Dr. Bronkhorst's scholarship, it might perhaps not be too out of place to place here, this [BVPdiscussion-thread](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/N1hSyzwsfm0/m/D413w8aGCAAJ)with 2 related papers ([2020/07](https://www.academia.edu/44767596/A_case_for_a_place_for_Y%C4%81ska_s_Nirukta_in_inclusive_global_histories_of_Technology_Science_Gender_Equality_in_Inheritance_and_an_argument_of_consequence_to_the_chronology_of_some_Sm%E1%B9%9Bti_texts), [2020/12](https://www.academia.edu/44767596/A_case_for_a_place_for_Y%C4%81ska_s_Nirukta_in_inclusive_global_histories_of_Technology_Science_Gender_Equality_in_Inheritance_and_an_argument_of_consequence_to_the_chronology_of_some_Sm%E1%B9%9Bti_texts)), that include, amongst other things, a critical engagement with Dr. Bronkhorst'stheorization regarding the chronology ofYāska *Nirukta*. Insofar as I have seen, I have not found any published critical engagement with Dr. Bronkhorst's (now critiqued) arguments, vis-a-vis the epoch of Yāska's *Nirukta*, prior to the above papers.

  

Regards,

Megh
