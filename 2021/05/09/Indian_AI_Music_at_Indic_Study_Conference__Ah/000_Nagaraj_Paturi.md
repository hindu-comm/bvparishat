Message from Prof. Vinod Vidwans

Dear All,



Advances in computer technology have opened up new avenues for creating music compositions. The inherent structure of Indian Classical Music makes it suitable for AI research, this has the potential for spawning a new field i.e. Indian AI Music and Musicology.



As an effort in this direction, Artificially Intelligent Creative Expert Systems namely ‘AI Raga’ and ‘AI Tala’ have been designed and developed. These AI Systems possess the knowledge of an expert in the domain of Indian music. The rules, aesthetic principles, concepts and conventional knowledge-base of Indian music from the*Natyashastra*and other treatises have been encoded in these systems. They generate Raga and Tala Compositions i.e.*Gat/Bandish*on their own without any human assistance or database. These AI Systems are tested with a number of Ragas and Talas.



I will be sharing my research about the above-mentioned AI Systems in a presentation at 2:00 pm on Wednesday, 12thMay in a virtual conference titled ‘New Directions in Indic Studies’ that has been organized by Indian Institute of Advanced Study, Shimla and FLAME University Pune from 12thMay to 13thMay 2021.



I will be honored by your presence in the conference.
