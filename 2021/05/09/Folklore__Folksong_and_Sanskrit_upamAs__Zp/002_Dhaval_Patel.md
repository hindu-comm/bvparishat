I know of the same simily being used in Vasantavilasafagu (वसन्तविलासफागु), a medieval Gujarati poem.

  

Following signs of beauty are mentioned in this verse.

  

1\. Nose like flower of sesame.

2\. Waist so slender that it can be accomodated in a fist,

3\. Palm that is as soft as a kisalaya / fresh shoot and as red as manjishtha.

  

  

  

``` तिलकुसुमोपम नाकु रे लांकु रे लीजइ मूंठि । किशलयकोमल पाणि रे जाणि रे चोलमजीठ ॥ ६३ ॥ 
```
