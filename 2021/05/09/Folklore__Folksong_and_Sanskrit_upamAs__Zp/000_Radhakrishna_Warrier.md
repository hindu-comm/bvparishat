In Malayalam folklore and folksongs, a nose like the flower of the sesame is considered beautiful. Beautiful women are described as having nose like that of the flower of sesame: eḷḷiṉ pū pōlatte mūkkŭ (എള്ളിൻ പൂ പോലത്തെ മൂക്കു്). 

  

Similarly, in Malayalam folklore and folksongs, beautiful complexion is often compared to the color of cut turmeric of Wayanad (vayaṉāṭaṉ maññaļ muricca pole വയനാടൻ മഞ്ഞൾ മുറിച്ച പോലെ). At the same time, black complexion is also considered beautiful, saying black hasēẓaẓakŭ, meaning seven \[=high\] beauty.

  

Are similar upamās used in Sanskrit literature, i.e., is a beautiful nose compared to the flower of the sesame and beautiful complexion compared to cut turmeric?
