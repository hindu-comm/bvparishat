yes, from Valmiki Ramayanam.. and language is not a crossword
puzzle or jigsaw. Many words and usages assume their meaning and sense only with reference to the context. Therefore a demand for translation without referring to the text looks highbrow.. of course this is a vidvat parishat it is claimed. Perhaps some scholars herein are so great that they can create grammar, and lexicon.   
Languageis just a vehicle for communication.. Too much of rumination is just like adding paint or upholstery to a car. The engine and the fuel and perhaps the air in the wheel are more significant.
