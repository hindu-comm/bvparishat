The 17th अध्याय (दृष्टिगतरोगप्रतिषेध) of सुश्रुतसंहिताs उत्तरतन्त्र discusses ophthalmological diseases in detail including surgery for लिङ्गनाश. Not just आचार्यशङ्कर, even बाणभट्ट, मङ्ख, and several other poets have used तिमिर as an anology. However, their knowledge of the disease - its nomenclature, symptoms, treatment etc. is an outcome of their acquaintance with आयुर्वेद. It's doubtful if they contribute any new knowledge to the discipline.
