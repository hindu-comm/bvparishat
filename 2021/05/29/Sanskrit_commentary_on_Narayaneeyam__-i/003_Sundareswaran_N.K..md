Apart from the भक्तप्रिया commentary by Desamangalam Rudra variyar, there are two other Sanskrit commentaries, though incomplete. These are बालबोधिनी commentary by Konattu Krishna Variyar (said to be completed later on by another Variyar, Konattu Sankara Variyar) and the रसिकप्रिया commentaryby Shri K. Rama Pisharoti.

It is a matter of immense pleasure to state that, last year, an extensive new commentary in Sanskrit has been written. It is the कृष्णप्रिया commentary authored by an excellent वैयाकरण, Prof. Krishnakumar. Prof. Krishnakumar has been a regular participant in the Ganapati Shastrartha Sadas being organised by Shri Sharada Peetham of Sringeri.The book will soon come in the market for sale. It is being published by CIF Shadha Sansthan, Veliyanadu.
