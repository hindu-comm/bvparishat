Sundareswaran ji,

  

It is said in the introduction of Balabodhini by Panditaraja Achyutapotuval that Krishna Variyar wrote the commentary up to 7th verse in the 89th dasakam. Remaining part of the commentary was written by Kattukulathu Achyuta Variyar. The commentary was published by Sankara Variyar.

shankara
