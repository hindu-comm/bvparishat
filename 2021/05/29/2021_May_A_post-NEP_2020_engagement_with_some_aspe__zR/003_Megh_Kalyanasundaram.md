This paper comprises findings from an engagement with two recent publications in Leadership and Ethics—1) *‘The Mind of the Leader*’ (2018) and 2) ‘*Virtue Ethics Between East and West*’ (2019)—to identify and foreground some conceptual connections with aspects of an Indic Knowledge System (IKS) अष्टादशविद्या (Aṣṭādaśavidyā). One part of this engagement situates itself within some areas of future research specified in Virtue Ethics Between East and West, and, in that context, precipitate Indic insights of relevance, an undertaking which, at the very least, serves the purpose of initiating an inclusion of IKS into what appears to be intended as a global conversation on Virtue ethics, with a significant civilisational accent no less, and yet seemingly limited currently only to Greek and Chinese sources thus far. In another part of the engagement, an excellent listing (published in 2006) of Indic virtues—I call it The Bina Gupta listing of virtues from śrīmadbhagavadgītā—is updated to include one more virtue (also from the gītā) which, I reason, is related to one key component of mindfulness as posited in The Mind of the Leader, and hence draws at least commensurate significance. To avoid being totally limited only to isolated theoretical discussions, the recently-approved National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 is invoked as an appropriate policy touch-point, for a reality-check, to assess the current level of conceptual integration of some of the above theoretical considerations.
