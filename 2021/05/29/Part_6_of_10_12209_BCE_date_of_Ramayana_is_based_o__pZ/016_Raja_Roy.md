Thanks Prof. Rao. Since I started refuting Oak's claims, Oak has not refuted a single point raised by me. Instead he has abused me on Twitter. Here are some examples:

He has not provided any proof that a comet's trajectory and magnitude can be predicted for 14000 years back,which I have asked. Hence, 12209 BCE date of Ramayana is debunked.

  

As learned members will recall, I had asked Oak to provide following information in this forum:

![image.png](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/8c294dcc83194/image.png?part=0.6&view=1)  

Oak has not responded. Do you see the magnitude of the problem? Oak does not have a singledirectproof of his hypothesis of decoupling of months and seasons from either Ramayana or Mahabharata. Still, he claims hundreds of corroborationsand he has not made this data public for scrutiny. All his work on Ramayana and Mahabharata rests on bogus unverified assertions. What is this learned forum going to do about this?

What is AICTE going to do about it which has given him validation by hosting him?

  

Best regards,

Raja
