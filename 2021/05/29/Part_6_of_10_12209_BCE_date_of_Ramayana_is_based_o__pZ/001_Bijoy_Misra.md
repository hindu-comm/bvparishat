Dr Raja,

I admire your efforts.

But I think it is not necessary. The false stories have their natural death.

Sri Oak is neither a student of astronomy nor of literature.

Touting arbitrary "findings" in social media is no research.

You should probably dig in more tangible research like dating Valmiki,

or dating Sri Krishna or help out to remove some of the controversies

still going on in dating the Buddha.  Each of these would be useful if

comprehensively done.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
