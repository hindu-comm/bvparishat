Friends,  

Software calculation with inbuilt database is the most fallacious work in the modern  

amateur work. Some such dating of the vedas was attempted here at Harvard thirty  

years ago by some who were fascinated with computer software. It took efforts to  

convince people that such "detection" is bogus, Software "discovers" what had been

fed in. Astrology may work, since one does not determine but wants to make guesses.  

People must escape the software fallacy of "prediction.". Let India develop more analysis

and first principle grounded research.

Regards,

Bijoy Misra
