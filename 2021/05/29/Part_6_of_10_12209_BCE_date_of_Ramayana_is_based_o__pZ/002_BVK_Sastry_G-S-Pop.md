Namaste



May be areas that need strategic attention (seriously ! sincerely!! ) for ‘future / remote / imagined beneficiaries’ are:



 1) Misra ji: Who- How to REVIEW-AUDIT- FUND RESEARCH for \< dig in more tangible research or help out to remove some of the controversies still going on …... Each of these would be useful if comprehensively done.>



 2) Raja ji : How to address \< software generated illusions. It has no basis in reality\>. Too much dependency on use of ‘Given- Free – Tools ’ without caring for the deep defects in-built.
