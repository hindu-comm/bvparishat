Dear Prof. Misra,

Coming back to your earlier comment, I beg to differ from your assessment. It is not going to go away on its own. I have not seen anyone do so much damage to our intellectual traditions in so little time. Left unchecked, the damage will become permanent. Already, so many people believe that Lord Rama was born in Sharad, in 12209 BCE, MB happened in 5561 BCE, Rama Setu is not the one made by Lord Rama. He has coinedanother date for Gita Jayanti, another date for Bhishma Nirvana. The list goes on. All of this is based on manipulated/manufactured evidence.

BVP needs to take this seriously. My efforts are very well needed and I will continue.

  

Best regards,

Raja
