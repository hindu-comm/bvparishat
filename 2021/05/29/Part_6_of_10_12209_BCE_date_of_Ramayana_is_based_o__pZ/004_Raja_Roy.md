Dear Sastry ji,

  

This problem is very serious. I was taught to do due diligencebefore using any tool during my Ph.D. I was told that I will have to defend what I write. Software maker is not going to come to my defence. I was taught to verify every reference myself. Somebody quoting it will not come to my defence. These are importantlessons that come only by getting rigorous training.

  

Best regards,

Raja
