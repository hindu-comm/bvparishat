Dear BVK and friends,  

  

To create "research" papers to satisfy dogma is a western creation.

It has been called theological research, hence dates come into play.

India discovered the phrase "I donot know". There has been never

an effort to create a closure. India also discovered that man is

capable of knowing his/her own limitations. So we acknowledge

and doi not pretend. Pretension is a facade to manipulate with a

motive to fool. Imperialism was built in with the manipulation of

knowledge or suppression of it. It continues in many parts of the

world and occasionally goes in the guise of "books".  

  

First principle research is slow and isnot well funded since it may not

have immediate political gain. But it goes in the direction of building

the nation and creating new original thinkers. World science is filled  

with long gaps in knowledge and India itself has its own Knowledge  

System.  While exposing and narrating the System is helpful, setting

up challenges to the youth would engage them. Challenges would only

come when we avoid complacency and refuse to declare closure.

Taking an analytic approach to all problems would bring freshness and  

engage the youth.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
