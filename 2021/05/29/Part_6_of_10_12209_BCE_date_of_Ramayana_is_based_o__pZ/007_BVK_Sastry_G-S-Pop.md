Namaste



1. Raja ji: Heed to Misra ji’s advise and words of wisdom and experience, reading: \< People must escape the software fallacy of "prediction.". Let India develop more analysis and first principle grounded research.>.



Now the question is who and where are the INVESTORS and RESEARCHERS of HOME TEAM ? to take the poorvapaksha: Software fallacy and ‘SI Team’ to ‘ Decode What is Vednaga Jyotirganita- Vedanga Jyotisha’ as a part of ‘Consciousness studies’- Cognitive Linguistics: The Vak-yoga-vijnana of Panini-Patanjali tradition ??

These studies are NOT ‘ ROI ( Return on Investment Motivated studies/ projects). But failure to do the right kind of INVESTMENT- RESEARCH can permanently damage and derail the ‘ IDENTITY’, And at Worst, the SI Team will just end up in cacophonies for having failed to keep up the clarity on source text-exposition. Yes, it is a difficult issue, if any one cares for it beyond the ‘ Identity by Citizen ship of Nation’ issues and Tax shelter-benefits.. Sorry if that hurts any one.



2. Misra Ji: Thank you for vocing a sane and timely advise.



Regards

BVK Sastry
