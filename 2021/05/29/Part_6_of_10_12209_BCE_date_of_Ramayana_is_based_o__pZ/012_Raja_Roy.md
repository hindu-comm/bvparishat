Respected Pradyumna ji,

  

My problem with Oak's date is about methodology. He has created the so-called "Astronomy Poison Pills" by misinterpreting the Ramayana texts. Then he has claimed a unique date, which is again based on misinterpretation. Further he claims 600 corroborations, which are either mere assertions or counting analogies/poetic expressions as astronomy observations.

  

Regards,

Raja
