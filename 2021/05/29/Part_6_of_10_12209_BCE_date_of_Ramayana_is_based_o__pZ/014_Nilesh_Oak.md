या॒न्त्रि॒क॒स॒ङ्ग॒ण॒नं न खल्वा॒त्मना॑ दु॒ष्टम्। न च॒ तस्य॑ श॒क्त्या व्याकृ॑ष्टो॒ जनो॑ निन्द॒नीयः॑।

Software calculation is not fallacious by itself. Also, there is nothing wrong in being fascinated by the power of computing using a machine.

  

Software "discovers" what had been fed in.

  

न केव॑लं॒ यन् निवि॑ष्टम्। यन् मानु॑षो॒ जनो॑ स्वप्रति॒भया॑ वर्षसह॒स्रैरपि॒ न प्रति॑पत्तुं श॒क्नोति॒, तद् यन्त्रे॑ण स॒द्यः प्रति॑पादयितुं शक्यते।

Of course it discovers more than what had been fed in. What man can't know by his own mental capacity in thousands of years can be known using a machine in an instant.

  

कुत्र॒ तर्हि॑ स्खलन्ति? यद् यन्त्रं॑ प्रयुञ्जा॒नैः प्रति॑पादितं॒ तत् स॒त्यम् इत्य॑व॒धार॑णे। तथै॒व ब॒हूनां॑ म॒तिर् ग॑णितोपकर॒णानि॒ प्रत्यपि॑ वर्तते। वि॒ज्ञा॒नो॒प॒क॒र॒णानि॒ प्रत्यपि॑।  

Where, then, do people err? In assuming that whatever has been obtained using software must be true. A similar mindset is seen in people towards mathematical tools, too. Towards scientific tools, too.
