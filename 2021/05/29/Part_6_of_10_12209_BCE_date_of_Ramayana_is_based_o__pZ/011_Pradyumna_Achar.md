Respected Sri Roy,

  

From your articles, I understand that Sri. Oak has theorised a date of around 12209 BCE and that it can't be earlier than 10,000 BCE.

You suggest that during that time, the sea levels would be about a 100m lower because of which such date does not corroborate with other evidence such as the need for Rama Setu.

However, since Ramayana happened at the end of Treta, which is almost 9 lakh years ago according to the same historical accounts from which the astronomical observations and events are being used to calculate the date of the Ramayana, there seems to be a svavachanavirodha.

  

Regards

Pradyumna
