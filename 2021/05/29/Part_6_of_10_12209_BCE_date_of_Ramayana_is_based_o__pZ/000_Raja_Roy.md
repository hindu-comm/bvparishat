Respected members,

  

I am pleased to share Part 6 of 10 of my blog refuting Nilesh Oak's dating of Ramayana to 12209 BCE. In this article I show that the trajectory and brightness of comets cannot be predicted even for 100 years, forget about 14000 years. Oak's 12209 BCE date of Ramayana is based on software generated illusion. It has no basis in reality.

Best regards,
