Learned Folks,

  

Nilesh Oak does not have the temperament of a scholar as he has mocked, jeered, and cast aspersions on Dr. Roy and me in response to my posting on Facebook the sixth part of Dr. Roy's ten-part series of articles.

  

He refers to Dr. Roy as my "mentee"! I am not a scholar in these matters to mentor anyone, let alone a scientist and an engineer of the caliber like Dr. Roy.

  

Nilesh could have done something that is expected of any scholar: respond to the criticismof his work with necessary evidence, show where hiscritichasread his work wrong, or offer additional evidence to buttress his argument. He has not posted one specific, careful response to Dr. Roy's articles dissecting his thesis about the dating of the Ramayana. Instead he has simply posted links to his videos, offered vagueasides, called his critics names, invoked Dr. Popper, mentioned sundry others as if name-dropping and name-calling constitutes scholarship! Alas, he has built a "following" who will march to his beat and respond like members of a cult.

  

After posting a jeering response on Facebook he has both deleted his response and unfriended me.

  

So much for the pursuit of knowledge!

  

Why am I bringing this to your notice here? Simply because without holding his feet to the fire, he will continue to beguile and fool readers, and as Dr. Roy argues, do major harm to the pursuit of careful, scholarly, and scientific inquiry into these matters of our past.

  

With regards,

  

Ramesh Rao
