"*Unalome*, a sak yant Buddhist art, captures the tale of life with its many twists and hurdles; these difficulties, the endless dissatisfaction - a product of our wants, fears, ignorance and indecisiveness, imparts wisdom and clarity, thus tuning us onto the path of enlightenment. The Unalome represents the path to self-fulfilment - the spiral, the bents and curves are a constant reminder that life might be fraught with miseries and the path is rarely straightforward, but only in living and learning through these, the path uncoils to enlightenment. The journey of my life composed of twists and hurdles has taught that only a wise who has learnt to be brave will withstand all the hardships and successfully attain self-fulfilment."
