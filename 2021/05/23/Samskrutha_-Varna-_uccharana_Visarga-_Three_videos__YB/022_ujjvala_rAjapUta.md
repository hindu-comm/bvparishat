Geniuses like Pāṇini are rare—in the past and present. But surely he did not create his *śāstra* for computing. Rather, by use of phrases like *prācām, udīcām, bhāṣāyām, vyatyayo bahulam,* etc., and by pointing out of irregularities in the form of exceptions, it is clearly indicated that he viewed the language as any other living language of the masses that is significant due to historical reasons and not due to some intrinsic property that makes it stand apart. Indeed, no one who doesn't get this can create such an outstanding work.
