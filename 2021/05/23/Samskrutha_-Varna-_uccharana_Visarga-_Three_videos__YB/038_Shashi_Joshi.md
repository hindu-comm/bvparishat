Aah!

I presumed you would know all about Google and its products, to find about King Julian :) :)

  

It is entertainingto see you get animated! Like the movie from which I gave the reference.

  

This is a public forum.

There was a discussion going on.

It went a bit too far, too off-track.

A visarga pronunciation thread has Lemurian reference.

So, maybe you can have the lively conversation in a private email :) :)

  

By the way, it is entertaining, indeed!

  
  

Thanks,
