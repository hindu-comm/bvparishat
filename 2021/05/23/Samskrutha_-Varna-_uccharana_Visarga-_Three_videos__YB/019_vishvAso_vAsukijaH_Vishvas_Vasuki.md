Sure, I'll reflect on myself.  
  
That said, I can't help but laugh at your throwing so much dung to hide yourinability / unwillingness to clarify what tradition you refer to in association "Standard Pronunciation of Samskrutha Varna-akshara –Svaras ... technically called ... ‘ Shuddha-Paatha- Upa-Desha’ ? 
‘UccaharaNa- AnoocchaaraNa’ ".What a golden example of "How well the individual speaker, for himself, articulates the thought in a ‘refined unified mode’" - LOL.  
  
Not to mention, you claimed my abhiprAya of how visarga should be pronounced falls short of "Panini-Shikshaa sampradaya, ‘ Maatrukaa- Paddhati- Analysis, Shiva-sutra Phoneme-analysis, Vaidika-Shikshaa-sampradaya, ’ and also ‘ the frontiers being explored in ‘Consciousness –studies, Brain-Mind interface studies’" without being able to demonstrate anything solid beyond throwing in such buzzwords. And you still wonder why the issue of your courage and forthrightness (or lack of it) is pertinent.

Sorry, I don't feel like spending 10$ on it. If there were a free copy, I would take a look at it and see if there is indeed anything non-trivial/ non-banal and worthwhile in it.  
  
If your emails are anything to go by: it will all still be description of shasha-shRnga articulated in‘refined unified mode’.You can write on cold fusion while at it! :-D

Hey - I note that you have been caught lying about "lead institutes" and unable to counter the below.

  

Voice-signature security protocol or anything close to it does not use pANini-sanskrit studies. I challenge you to demonstrate any such research by "any lead institute". By claiming such links, you are actively propagating nonsense, and doing great disservice to the gravitas of what you call "Panini language –tradition" and its genuine votaries.

Just because I don't buy into your fraudulent claims, it is wrong to conclude that Ihave blinkered vision about "Panini-Language". Whatever the personal benefit you derive from such (I don't know how much you've earned or will earn with such hollow claims), I am pretty confident that you will not achieve anything worthwhile in "Neural network sciences, Cognitive Sciences, Computational linguistic sciences, HMI, A.I" using sphoTa theory and pANini magic even by 2040 (or should we wait till 3000 CE LOL).
