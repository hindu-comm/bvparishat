Thank you Dr. Sivasenani.

  

This should hopefully put a lid on this urban legend (atleast for a while).

  

Dr. BVKS --> Kindly Kindly listen to vidvans who have expertise in both computers and Samskrta. It will save you and the rest of us a lot of angst and time which can be better used in japa/ homa etc. in these tough times.

  

Please also consider using traditional names in your writings (instead of made up names like "intention-speech protocol") so that newbies like me can learn the terms and literature you have sourced them from.

Being unfamiliar with both traditional usage and your modern coining, its akin to a person floundering in sight oftheshore being airlifted to deep sea and being dropped in the midst of a school of sharks....without a parachute.

  

As a regular reader of ALL your posts, please consider this as an honest feedback from a friend.
