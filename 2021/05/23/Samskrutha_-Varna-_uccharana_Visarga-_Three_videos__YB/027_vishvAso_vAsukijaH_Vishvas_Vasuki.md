Nothing to do with sanskrit in particular.

Boring to repeat myself. Interested may read <https://groups.google.com/g/sanskrit-programmers/c/j8oZrKI32O4/m/BPZ1UdLVAAAJ> . I find the level of milage this paper gets shocking - anyone with a modicum of sanskrit knowledge who has cared to read that article would find such errors.

**To summarize, there is a lot AI and NLP can do for sanskrit. On the other hand, there's not much sanskrit can offer AI or NLP.**
