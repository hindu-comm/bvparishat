I am under no impression that people write to keep me entertained. But the funny thing is, some do entertain. Some, after some time do start to stink, for their lack of focus.

  

Why do you presume my 'expiry date' remark was due to my lack of knowledge about gmail? Even though we have other contact-spheres from which you may guess my background, you chose a very lame sarcasm about the possibility of my ignorance about gmail! You should have come up with betterones to counter whatever you think you are countering. Is belittling others the only way you know of making a point?

  

You do have some good points in your arguments, but do tend to lose it in the flow.

  

When a discussion about how to pronounce visarga starts talking about Lemur and other wildlife -isms, it indeed betrays the lack of focus on the part of the participants, and reminds me of king Julian of 'move-it' fame.

  

Shri Vishvas, may I add that you are not the only one to have wit, satire, knowledge or freedom of speech :) Your short tolerancelevel indeed belittles the vastness of your knowledge.

  

Why am I not allowed to share my views about the discussion publicly, as publicly as everyone else is doing? And why should I send private messages to the admin? I am not complaining. I am giving hints to the participants that the content is not new or entertaining or adding value to the topic.

  

PS: I have no intentions to reply to anything point by point, so please don't labor to reply. Sometimes, read just to understand.

  

All in good intentionand spirit! :)  
  

Thanks,
