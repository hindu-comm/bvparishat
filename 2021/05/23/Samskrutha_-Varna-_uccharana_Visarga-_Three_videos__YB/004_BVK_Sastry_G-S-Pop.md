Namaste Vishvas Vasuki



On \< purported invariance of vaidika pronunciation acrossgenerations
\> :



***Question***: What is your view on ‘Standard Pronunciation of Samskrutha Varna-akshara –Svaras’ ? which are also technically called ‘ Shuddha-Paatha- Upa-Desha’ ? ‘UccaharaNa- AnoocchaaraNa’ ?



 How would you suggest a protocol for ‘Validation of a Standard Phoneme’ - a key issue in ‘Voice-Signature-Security programs?



Experience shows that just one word ‘ It is me’ over telephone gives confirmation on Speakers Identity. How does Mind manage this ?



Regards

BVK Sastry
