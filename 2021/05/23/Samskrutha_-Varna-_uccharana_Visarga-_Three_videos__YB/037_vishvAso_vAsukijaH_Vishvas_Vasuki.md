Look man, let us cut to the point. I presume that you don't go to a conference, observe a group of people talking animatedly about something, listen in and interject for a while and then declare "this is getting stale", "you should move on" etc.. A sane person will just excuse himself and go elsewhere. It is rude to intrude and tell others to stop conducting their conversation in public. Comprende? If you do that, better be prepared to be told your boundaries.

I have no idea who this King Julian is.Your pop culture references are abstruse to me (and it is probably good that it is so).
