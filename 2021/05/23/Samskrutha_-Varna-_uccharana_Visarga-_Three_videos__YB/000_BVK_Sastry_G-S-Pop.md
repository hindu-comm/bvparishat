Namaste



The three videos link below (Feb 2021 workshop) , from Poorna-Prajna-Samshodhana Mandiram / Pejawara Swamy ji could help to clarify the current understanding of Samskrutham Varna-Shikshaa.



The video is in Kannada; but it should not pose any difficulty in capturing the essence of the ‘Shikshaa’ pronunciation part.

***Why is this important*** ? The user-seeker does not get the
‘Yoga: Traditional Meaning, Usage guidance, Purpose and Benefit’ of Distorted Samskruth –Word’.

The
errors from all these streams cumulatively flows in to ‘ Sanskrit-TECHNOLOGY ADAPTATION/MODELING/ANALYSIS.

The outcome of Panini-Language - document suffers. This also has a deep
bearing on ‘How Samskruth is Taught and Used in applications.

This DISTORTION of SAMSKRUTH WORD comes in several modes ! and is prevalent widely in several academic discussions.

The distortion modes, especially when it relates to Meemaamsaa works related usage, occur through the following:

(i) By careless pronunciation (ii) regionalization (iii) reading through ‘alien script-representation’ (iv) preferred adjustments to align to a different word

(v) insensitive substitutions (vi) individual specific fine tuning of pronunciation , marked as ‘ patha- paathaka –bhedas’.



Scholars may have difference of opinion. Techno linguists have their own models to align Samskruth related Text to Speech and Speech to Text transformations, by Machine standards.



The above videos now provide a traditional reference to discuss further.
