Namaste Vishvas Vasuki Mahodaya



( I am responding in English, point wise, for the convenience of forum readers ; It is not that I cannot respond to you on Samskrutham. ).



1. I appreciate your enthusiasm and young –energy to pursue Panini studies, albeit the path you have chosen seems to be ‘ Personal Opinion driven and overriding the Living-Tradition and Texts of Tradition’.
It may take some time to figure out your own study bearings and
‘inbuilt-pitfalls and poison –pills’ in your approach.



I will let you discover these things by ‘self-experience’ and ‘ over a period of time’. I am not your teacher and you are not my student. No ill feelings, No hurt.

If you want to explore together on the areas pointed below, you are welcome.

2**. On** \< सदुपयोगनिर्देश इत्य् उक्तम्। के नामैते सदुपयोक्तारः? अह-इहि-उहु-वाचिनो वा अह्-इह्-उह्-वाचिनो वा? अस्मिन् प्रश्नभाग अस्पष्टायां सतायां मदभिप्रायकथनं कुतो नाम सम्भवेत्। > :

**Response**: **Tradition has answered this in the technicality of the terms: \< **शिष्टाः, आर्याभिधान-काक्षिणः सत्य-वाक्य- प्रयोक्तारः , मन्त्रकृतः, मन्त्र-प्रयोक्तारः - संग्रहेण : संस्कृत-वाचिनः**\> . There is no \<** प्रश्नभाग अस्पष्टायां सतायां** \> . **

3. **On** \< अयम् उद्धारो महाभाष्यान्न - अपि तु तस्य कस्याश्चिट् टीकाया इति भाति। …सोऽयम् अक्षर-समाम्नायो वाक्य-समाम्नायः पुष्पितः फलितश् चन्द्र-तारक-वत् प्रति-मण्डितो वेदितव्यो ब्रह्म-राशिः। सर्व-वेद-पुण्य-फलावाप्तिश् चास्य ज्ञाने भवति। मातापितरौ चास्य स्वर्गे लोके महीयेते । प्रकृतम् अनुसृत्य - परम्परया ज्ञेयो ऽक्षरसमाम्नाय इति चेद् अस्तु - परम्पराणाम् एकरूपता नास्तीति, कालक्रमेण परम्परासु दोषा प्रवेष्टुम् अर्हन्तीति च स्मर्तव्यम्। अन्यथा कथं नाम क्वचिद् अह-इहि-उह्व् इति क्वचिन्न? क्वचित् साधुसंवृताकारः, क्वचिद् विवृतः? नाम परम्परास्पष्टीकरणं विना, ‘Standard Pronunciation of Samskrutha Varna-akshara –Svaras’" = सुद्धपाठोपदेश इति न स्पष्टम् भवति। \> :

**Response**: **The intent is explained in source, amplified and explained in commentary, put to practice in teaching –practicing tradition. The impurities that get added on in teaching tradition are called ‘ human defects’. The texts help to get back to the ‘ fruit-yielding pronunciation and practice’ with vigilant audit and corrections. If that has not happened, has not been adapted, defective pronunciation imposed and practiced as ‘ popular-deliverable’, the source cannot be blamed or held responsible for it. **

****

**The sad part noticed and endorsed by the respected swamy ji in the video is widespread presence of ‘such human defects’ masquerading as ‘ tradition and authentic’. Just as ‘knowledge tradition’ continues, the ‘ osmosis of human defects also continue in every period and community. The scholar has a choice to make and support the side one wants to.**

4. **On** \< **I have enquired many people** about aha-ihi-uhu pronunciation and more. Why should I assume that I am a lazy bum who mouths off without undertaking reasonable effort? …… I remain mystified as to what this has to do with Voice-Signature-Security protocol etc.. You can disagree with and challenge my opinions, but throwing in hollow buzzwords and putting crooked (rather than straightforward) questions don't seem to be a good way to go about it. \> :



**Response**: a) ‘**Samskrutham’ is not about what ‘others do –say’. Samskrutham is ‘How well the individual speaker, for himself, articulates the thought in a ‘refined unified mode’ ( a standard of spoken expression set by Hanuman, appreciated by Sri Rama, and articulated in Ramayana). It is freedom from technicality of ‘अपभाषित‘.
So the directive is to make self-effort for ‘ generating -articulating refined speech –expression, technically called ‘सूक्ति.’ Samskrutham is NOT statistically significant model of language ! It is Process-output standards. **

****

**Response**:**b) If you don’t know what is pointed to by the terms
\< Voice-Signature-Security protocol, ….> studies in relation to ‘ Panini-Sanskrit studies’, and think that these are \< hollow buzz words and putting c rooked ? !>, please update your information on Samskruth-Panini-Related research going on globally at lead institutes ; where ‘ content is drawn from Panini language –tradition –usage / the translation is made stripping out all references to source / problem generalized / reported back as a High Tech-High Profile Language-Technology project for Non-english-like languages of India , demanding ‘ Indian Language technology solutions’. **

****

**Perhaps this is far too much outside of the domain of projects focused on ‘ putting and searching devanagari language characters on screen and devices’. Project to build digital systems and methods for
‘processing ‘Devanagari Varna-maalaa’ on its own merits with right modelling of Panini-Language is work in progress. **

5. **On** \< If you want me to justify and defend my abhiprAya, you could have skipped the silly games and strightforwardly stated your objections and solicited my response...... If this is what you intend to show, you should do a better job. If it violates pANinIya shixA you may note the appropriate shloka and show that the stated "abhiprAya" runs counter to it. Just declaring "It violates Shiva-sutra Phoneme-analys is yo" is about as useful as "I don't like Ice Cream" in that there can be no useful response to it. \> :



**Response**: **Perhaps, I was under the incorrect impression that you had the tradition schooling to get the delineated clarity on the Pahininiya Shiksha –sutra, references below : **

****

** आत्मा बुद्ध्या समेत्यार्थान्मनोयुङ्क्ते विवक्षया । मनः कायाग्निमाहन्ति सः प्रेरयति मारुतम् ॥ ६॥ **

**मारुस्तूरसिचरन्मन्द्रं जनयति स्वरम् । ….** **सोदीर्णो मूर्ध्न्यभिहतोवक्रमापद्य मारुतः ।**

**
…….वर्णाञ्जनयतेतेषां विभागः पञ्चधा स्मृतः ॥ ९ \|\|**



**Your \<swaabhipraaya \> is locked to a narrow segment of the text reading \< … मारुतः । and jumping to वर्णाञ्जनयतेतेषां….
Leaving out the intermediary processes ; that too superimposing an
inaccurate academic understanding. **

****

**Your \< objection> is touching in the areas where Current
researchers in Linguistics, Neural network sciences, Cognitive Sciences, Computational linguistic sciences, HMI, A.I, Consciousness studies … are investigating and have not raised from ‘ physical air movement- glottis shape and the like’ to the technicality of ‘ मारुत - कायाग्नि - इन्द्रिय- मनस् - आत्मा ‘- traditional postulates.
**

****

**I hope this helps to say what ‘Ice cream’ in ‘Panini’ is. **
