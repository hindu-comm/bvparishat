Namaste

  

I want to add certain pointers about "language models" used in NLP. Broadly there are two approaches to NLP:

  

a\) A linguistics-based approach where parts of speech are tagged, morphology is defined, relation between entities is expected to follow a set pattern (say between verb and noun - the six Karakas) etc.

  

b\) A statistics-based approach which may or may not correspond to the underlying linguistic entities. Another name, more popular definitely, for this is Machine Learning. In most cases what the Machine learns is not known to us. The end product is that tokens (or whatever unit we take such as bi-grams, n-grams, phrases or sentences or documents) are represented by a set of numbers (vectors, tensors etc.). The Statistical approach is the anti-thesis of the Linguistic approach.

  

This division is not water-tight, but it is fairly representative when it comes to the fundamental structure of models used in each approach.

  

In the last decade or so, the Statistical approach has been shown to work ao well that it almost completely displaced the Linguistic approach. For instance all the ten models mentioned in the link (c) above are machine learning models, which have absolutely no relation to Panini, Sanskrit or Linguistics.

  

It is not that I don't have respect for Panini (actually I worship him). My concern is that we belittle the great Rishi by attributing credit falsely to him.
