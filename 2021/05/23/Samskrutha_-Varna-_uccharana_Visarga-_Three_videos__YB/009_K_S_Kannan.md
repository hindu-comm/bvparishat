Dear BVKS,

  

Please don't underestimate the scale and spell of the marvels

(euphemism for mortifications ensuing) modern technology efffects:

You are empowered to "alter" the *mantra* as  

*yajamā**nān** hinasti !  
*

  

Had it not been said:

*ekas tu kurute pāpaṁ*

*phalaṁ bhuṅkte mahājanaḥ*  

\- even in olden times?

  

The modern proverb says:

To err may be human;

but to really foul things up, it requires a computer!

  

Natural Fooolishness is not even in the race  

to compete with Artificial Intelligence!
