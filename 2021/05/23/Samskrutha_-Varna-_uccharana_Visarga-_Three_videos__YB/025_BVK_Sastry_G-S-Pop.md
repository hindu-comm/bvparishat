Namaste



1. Dr. Briggs Paper is invoked once more with an observation \< Unlike Sanskrit, 40 years is like ages in a field like Artificial Intelligence. \> . I agree. May be Samskruth-Computer enthusiasts may start a separate thread to discuss this isuse.



2. On \< Sphota or kAraka is NOT the cutting edge of AI research.>. You are free to stand by your opinion. Here is something that may be of interest in regard to A.I and NLP –Samskrutham, as a logically perfect language: A logically perfect language has rules of syntax which pre\[1\]vent nonsense, and has single symbols which always have a definite and unique meaning. Mr Wittgenstein is concerned with the conditions for a logically perfect language—not that any language is logically perfect, or that we believe ourselves capable, here and now, of constructing a logically perfect language, but that the whole function of language is to have meaning, and it only fulfils this function in proportion as it approaches to the ideal language which we postulate.

3. On \< understand that there exist computers today which (when provided similar large-scale context) are able to match and beat humans in natural language understanding (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_(computer)#Jeopardy>! ) without taking resort to the use of shAstrik sanskrit or some other natural language for that matter. >



May be the links below help to give the panorama ahead in A.I related ! and where ‘Panini- Designs’ are being used, albeit some resources shy away not mentioning the ‘ names’ .



I do understand the fear, sensitivity, Samskruth-phobia, anglophobia, shyness and shame of many in taking recourse to ‘Samskruth –Source and Terms, document acknowledgement’, especially in A.I / NLP related research ! 



Such source acknowledgement is considered a Taboo and cause of falling an outcaste! Another model of this is ‘Samskruth –bashing and negativity using incongruous, inappropriate references’ on Samskruth-Language-Model potential to deliver cutting edge technology solutions. !
