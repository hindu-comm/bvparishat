Namaste Vishvas Vasuki Mahodaya

Thanks for the response. I am happy to note that I have to respond only to select points. 



You have clarified your temperament for the purpose of this dialogue very clearly ! as \< my nature is to refuse to cooperate and act as a foil for grandiose nonsense. \>



1. On \< अतो भवदभिप्राये के शिष्टा इति ऋजु वक्तुं भवतो धैर्यं नास्ति चेत्, भवदभिप्रायं वेत्तुं, विदित्वा प्रतिवक्तुं कथं वा कश्चिद् दूरस्थः शक्नुयात्? भीरुताम् अपाकृत्य स्पष्ट-स्वाभिप्रायकथने प्रयत्नं करोतु। \>
: Why are you drifting the issue to personal courage ? I have not asked for your judgement on the ‘ speaker in the video’. I have answered about the ‘Standards’ point clearly in my post. : Learning-Using Samskrutham / saMskRta ( which you prefer) .

Please contemplate on the earlier response reading : **'Samskrutham’
is not about what ‘others do –say’. Samskrutham is ‘How well the individual speaker, for himself, articulates the thought in a ‘refined unified mode’.** Do you meet this standard ? Do you have any difficulty with this ‘ऋजु -धैर्यं ‘ for self-assessment ? ? Aim for self-assessment before judging and going after others. The ‘शिष्ट’ are recognized. They are not judged !



2. On \< I am sorry to use such a strong word, but this is entirely bullshit... voice-signature security protocol or anything close to it does not use pANini-sanskrit studies.. I challenge you to demonstrate any such research by "any lead institute". By claiming such links, you are actively propagating nonsense, and doing great disservice to the gravitas of what you call "Panini language –tradition" and its genuine votaries. .. I am sorry to use such a strong word, but this is entirely bullshit. I am reminded of this thread in another mailing list - <https://groups.google.com/g/sanskrit-programmers/c/j8oZrKI32O4> . voice-signature security protocol or anything close to it does not use pANini-sanskrit studies... I know of such efforts, but you seem to be talking about your own work (with which I am not familiar) - Is this progress visible somewhere? Or is just vapour? \>



I let you live in your 'realm of happiness' and dream world ! This shows very clearly that you have no understanding/ nay different understanding
of 'Panini-Language Modelling' treating it as one more language like 'English' , as taught by colonials ! The ‘Samskruth-Computer /Panini-Machine’ work is very much in progress, real and live. All ongoing research is not thrown open to satisfy curios people. In case you want to read more pl. feel free to explore my published work:
[https://www.amazon.com/SANSKRIT-COMPUTERS-revisit-2020-VENKATAKRISHNA-SASTRY/dp/B089CSNGG2](https://www.amazon.com/SANSKRIT-COMPUTERS-revisit-2020-VENKATAKRISHNA-SASTRY/dp/B089CSNGG2)
\[ Please understand - I am not promoting the book, through this opportunity and platform. \].

3. On \<Let me go forth and say - I am quite certain that for all the bluster above, no one (specially including you) is not going to revolutionize Neural network sciences, Cognitive Sciences, Computational linguistic sciences, HMI, A.I by applying "pANinIya shixA" or "sphoTa theory" or whatever. People are welcome to keep trying or pretending that they're doing something great without anything to show for it - but the world won't be fooled and will mostly see through such प्रतारण. \> :



Good to see that you want to have yourself excluded in a global emerging area of ‘Cognitive Linguistic –Sciences’ by passing short-sighted, biased and definitive judgement-sentences ! Even before understanding the ongoing work, development and powers driving the work. May be you need the ‘ teertham’ from a specific ‘ conch’ of your liking. I hope someday you will be free from your blinker-blocked vision towards Panini-Language to see the reality and power.



Till then, Keep Peace.
