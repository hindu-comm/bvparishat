They're Close, not Consistent. e.g.,

"Pajeetan Kumar" being a Christu in reality but a Hindu in name & records. Inconsistent.

"Burqa" preaching "Bindi" the nuances of woman liberation. Inconsistent.

"Lemur" speaking (they speak aa?) to the native & the English audiences about the same thing but in different modes. Inconsistent.
