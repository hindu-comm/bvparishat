I think both of you have shown your true colors, making the rainbow shy.

  

While it is entertaining to follow this match of wits, maybe it can be shifted to personal emails, since the story is not moving forward, from point of view of suspense, plot twist, etc.

  

Even in the Kuru sabha, the elders kept silent, and a 'mahakavya iti-hasa'. Let us not cheer a haraNa here.

  

TRP decline is unavoidable after some time.

Thanks,  
Shashi
