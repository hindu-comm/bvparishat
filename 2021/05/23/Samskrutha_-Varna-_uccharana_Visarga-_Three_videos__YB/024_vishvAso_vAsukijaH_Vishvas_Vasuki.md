A response to the below, whichwas sent 3 days ago was rejected by the moderator (shrI nAgarAja) per a notification received today, with no pointed listing of objections (other than some template mentioning general criteria like "appropriateness" and "offensive expressions"). Since it is difficult to gauge what facts and objectively true statements pass his filter ofinoffensiveness, I omit most of my point-wise response (and just lay blame on "degeneration" of thread to utterly incoherent citations pertaining to both Computer Science and Sanskrit faced with my expectations of probity and clarity) and resend just the most salient part of it (pertaining to the famous Rick Briggs paper, an old source/ tool of befuddlement).

Rick Briggs' original paper is available here:<http://www.aistudy.co.kr/paper/aaai_journal/AIMag06-01-003.pdf>

  
The crux of the paper, in the author's own words:  
  
"Among the accomplishments of the grammarians can be reckoned a method for paraphrasing Sanskrit in a manner that is identical not only in essence but in form with current work in Artificial Intelligence. This article demonstrates that a natural language can serve as an artificial  
language also, and that much work in AI has been reinventing a wheel millenia old ."

  

Important to note that he was NOT saying -

  

\- that Sanskrit in general (with arbit sandhis, samAsa-s) is ideal for AI (nAgesha's shAstric sanskrit or even the recently proposed Simple Standard Sanskrit is a limited subset/ dialect of Sanskrit; just as limited subsets of other languages can be similarly useful),

\- or that Sanskrit is**uniquely**suited for knowledge representation (look up Conlangs),

\- or that, given the "reinvention of the wheel" which had taken place by 1984, computational knowledge representation systems have anything further to gain from Sanskrit tradition .



  

Let me say this clearly for the benefit of sanskrit scholars whodon't grok Computer Science:

  

\- NASA is NOT doing Sanskrit-based AI research.

\- Unlike Sanskrit, 40 years is like ages in a field like Artificial Intelligence. Sphota or kAraka is NOT the cutting edge of AI research.

\- Please understand that there exist computers today which (when provided similar large-scale context) are able to match and beat humans in natural language understanding (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_(computer)#Jeopardy>! ) without taking resort to the use of shAstrik sanskrit or some other natural language for that matter.
