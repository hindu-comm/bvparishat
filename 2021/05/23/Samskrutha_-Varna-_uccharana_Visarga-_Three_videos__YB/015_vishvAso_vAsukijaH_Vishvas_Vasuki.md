सदुपयोगनिर्देश इत्य् उक्तम्। के नामैते सदुपयोक्तारः? अह-इहि-उहु-वाचिनो वा अह्-इह्-उह्-वाचिनो वा? अस्मिन् प्रश्नभाग अस्पष्टायां सतायां मदभिप्रायकथनं कुतो नाम सम्भवेत्।

अयम् उद्धारो महाभाष्यान्न - अपि तु तस्य कस्याश्चिट् टीकाया इति भाति। यतो म एतावद् एव दृश्यते -  
  
सोऽयम् अक्षर-समाम्नायो वाक्य-समाम्नायः पुष्पितः फलितश् चन्द्र-तारक-वत् प्रति-मण्डितो वेदितव्यो ब्रह्म-राशिः। सर्व-वेद-पुण्य-फलावाप्तिश् चास्य ज्ञाने भवति। मातापितरौ चास्य स्वर्गे लोके महीयेते ।

  

प्रकृतम् अनुसृत्य - परम्परया ज्ञेयो ऽक्षरसमाम्नाय इति चेद् अस्तु - परम्पराणाम् एकरूपता नास्तीति, कालक्रमेण परम्परासु दोषा प्रवेष्टुम् अर्हन्तीति च स्मर्तव्यम्। अन्यथा कथं नाम क्वचिद् अह-इहि-उह्व् इति क्वचिन्न? क्वचित् साधुसंवृताकारः, क्वचिद् विवृतः?

  

नाम परम्परास्पष्टीकरणं विना, ‘Standard Pronunciation of Samskrutha Varna-akshara –Svaras’" = सुद्धपाठोपदेश इति न स्पष्टम् भवति।

:-) I have enquired many people about aha-ihi-uhu pronunciation and more. Why should I assume that I am a lazy bum who mouths off without undertaking reasonable effort?

  

I remain mystified as to what this has to do withVoice-Signature-Security protocol etc.. You can disagree with and challenge my opinions, but throwing in hollow buzzwords and putting crooked (rather than straightforward) questions don't seem to be a good way to go about it.

You don't need to be driven berserk based on a simple analogy. In any labeling problem, features of the input (shape of the ear or amplitude of various frequencies) determine the label assigned ("this is rAma", "that is brahma"). Rather than throwing in subject names (as if that's what being insightful means) maybe you should actually teach yourself some programming and solve some real world problems (be it identification of faces or voices). There are freely available datasets as well as open-source implementations of pertinent machine learning algorithms.

If you want me to justify and defend my abhiprAya, you could have skipped the silly games and strightforwardly stated your objections and solicited my response.

If this is what you intend to show, you should do a better job. If it violates pANinIya shixA you may note the appropriate shloka and show that the stated "abhiprAya" runs counter to it. Just declaring "It violates Shiva-sutra Phoneme-analysis yo" is about as useful as "I don't like Ice Cream" in that there can be no useful response to it.
