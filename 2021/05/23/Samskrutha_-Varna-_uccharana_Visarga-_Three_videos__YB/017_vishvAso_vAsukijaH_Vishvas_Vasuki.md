Thanks for the response. For my part, I have no performance-based agenda, and will respond in any language convenient.

Your analysis is totally incorrect. Texts of tradition and living tradition are often at odds in many vedAnga-s (including jyotiSha andshixA) - I find myself more at odds with the latter than the former. That some privilege the latter is no less their "personal opinion".

Ditto to those who blindly follow current tradition (or should I say current fashion).

Same here. Albeit, I am happy to learn what I can from anybody - be it a child or a fool who mostly sends निःसार posts or a learned pedant like a member or two here. That said, my nature is to refuse to cooperate and act as a foil for grandiose nonsense.

Good - I am in agreement with the above.

Indeed. Very much agree.

Sure - there are multiple meanings one can ascribe to saMskRta (for example, I find the unrefined spelling "Samskrutham" so yucky that I can't get myself to use it.). Nodisagreement so far.

I am sorry to usesuch a strongword, but this is entirely bullshit. I am reminded of this thread in another mailing list -<https://groups.google.com/g/sanskrit-programmers/c/j8oZrKI32O4> . voice-signature security protocol or anything close to it does not use pANini-sanskrit studies. I challenge you to demonstrate any such research by "any lead institute". By claiming such links, you are actively propagating nonsense, and doing great disservice to the gravitas of what you call "Panini language –tradition" and its genuine votaries.

I know of such efforts, but you seem to be talking about your own work (with which I am not familiar) - Is this progress visible somewhere? Or is just vapour?

Oho - where exactly ismy abhiprAya saying anything about how vivaxA motivates prANa to produce three types of svaras? Is this the standard of "proof" and "analysis" you adhere to?

Let me go forth and say - I am quite certain that for all the bluster above, no one (specially including you) is not going to revolutionizeNeural network sciences, Cognitive Sciences, Computational linguistic sciences, HMI, A.I by applying "pANinIya shixA" or "sphoTa theory" or whatever. People are welcome to keep trying or pretending that they're doing something great without anything to show for it - but the world won't be fooled and will mostly see through such प्रतारण.
