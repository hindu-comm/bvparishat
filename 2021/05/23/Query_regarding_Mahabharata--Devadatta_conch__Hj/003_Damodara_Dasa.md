Hare Krishna.  
  
Respected Vidvaj-janas,  
  
Nice to hear some explanations about the Devadatta conch's being  
received twice by Arjuna -- one from Maya Danava and another from  
Indra.  
  
However, I am also curious to know if there still is some explanation  
which is based on literatures like Puranas, itihasas or their  
commentaries or in some literatures written by traditional acharyas  
like Shankaracarya, Madhvacarya, etc.  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
