Respected Scholars,

  

Namo Namah.

  

Mahabharata describes Maya Danava giving the Devadatta conch, which belonged to Varuna, to Arjuna afterthe burning of the Khandava forest \[Ref:Mahabharata, Gitapress edition, Sabha-parva, chapter 3, verse 8 and 12\].

  

Later, MB describes Lord Indra giving it toArjuna when Arjuna visited Svarga.\[Ref:Mahabharata, Gitapress edition, Vana-parva, chapter 174, verse 5\]

  

How is this possible?Any answers with Shastra-Pramana will be highly appreciated.

  

Thanks in advance,



das,

Jaya Nityananda Dasa
