Dear Sri Venkat Veeraraghavan ji,

  

Namo Namah.

  

Thanks for spending time and sharing your valuable reflections on the issue. I very much appreciatethe reasoning of Your good self, that is very much in line with the traditional reasoning,and I hope I will continue to be benefited by such thoughtful comments in future.

  

By reading your comments, one more possibility comes to my mind that I would like to share here for everyone's consideration . It doesn't have any shastric support, however, I leave it up to the respected members of this forum for comment/correction.

  

Arjuna's receiving divine weapons or Devadatta conch two times in Mahabharata is not necessary a confusion.

  

In the case of divine weapons, even if they are sentient beings and have the same nomenclature due to particular function they are called for (e.g. any Agneyastra is meant for producing fire), and thus, **have their own individuality different than the other divine weapons of the same nomenclature**, they are different in terms of their penetrating power. i.e. the penetrating power of Agneyastra, which Arjuna received from Guru Dronacharya must be of lower rank than the Agneyastra, which he received from demigods. I take it as analogous to purchasing a steel chair of average quality from a local company and purchasing the same from the Salem steel plant (I am not marketing here, I am a monk). Both are still called steel chairs, however, the quality is different.

  

In the case of Devadatta conch, the one which Arjuna received from Maya Danava was originally belong to demigod Varuna, whereas the other one with the same nomenclature, which he received from the king of demigods, Lord Indra, was the personal conch of Lord Indra. My guess is that Arjuna had two conchs of the same nomenclature, and it should not be considered a sin to posses two conchs of the same name by any one let alone Arjuna, the son of Lord Indra.

  

I will be blessed to receive corrections for both the possibilities,



das,

Jaya Nityananda Dasa
