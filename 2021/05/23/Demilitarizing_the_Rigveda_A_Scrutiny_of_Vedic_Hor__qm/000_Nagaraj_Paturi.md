Dear All,

I shared last year a preprint of this paper; this is the final revised version, as published after some revision. (Contrary to the journalâ€™s date, the issue was published late last year.)

I believe the paper provides fresh evidence to show that the invasionist reading of Rigveda, apart from doing grave injustice to the text (even after the racial framework has been more or less removed), misinterprets, when it does not invent, the presence of horses, spoked wheels and war chariots in the hymns. The supposed praise of battle and warfare, barring a couple of possible exceptions, is a colonial misreading that wilfully overlooks the many hints and clues the hymns offer us.

Best regards,

Michel
