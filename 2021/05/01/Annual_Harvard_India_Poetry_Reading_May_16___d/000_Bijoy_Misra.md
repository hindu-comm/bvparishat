Friends,

Our Annual Harvard India Poetry Reading will be held on May 16, through Zoom.

It is a multi-lingual event. The topic this year is प्रकृतिमाता \> New poems in any  

language is invited. They should reach me by May 8.

Thank you.

Bijoy Misra

  

PS. I am hearing the shocking Corona news from India. Please stay very careful.

We have to pass on these difficult times.
