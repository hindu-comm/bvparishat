Good folks,

  

Sewa International has raised about seven million dollars in seven days and has already sent 2,500 oxygen concentrators to India.

  

You can donate to Sewa International here --

or here --

I advise Sewa International on media matters (press releases, newsletters, etc), and we have been inundated this week with requests for information from all over.

  

Sewa International is a volunteer-run organization, and none of the leadership takes a dime as salary. Our administrative expenses are four percent. Sure, you could donate to UNICEF or the Red Cross, but their bureaucrats are paid in the hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual salaries.

  

Sewa International has earned the topmost 4-star rating for transparency and financial accountability from Charity Navigator for the past four years.

  

This is a time where India is indeed facing a crisis, and while we may bemoan the state of affairs -- corruption, inefficiency, etc. -- we cannot but step in to help.

  

We have one major donor sending 5,000 oxygen concentrators (worth about 2.5 million dollars) through Sewa.

  

Your help and support will be appreciated.

  

With regards,

  

Ramesh Rao
