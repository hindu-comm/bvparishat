Dear Narayan Prasad Ji,

  

  Thanks for this reference. I think one drawback of these books on Marathi grammar is that they do not take into account the variation of usage across the various dialects of Marathi. In my Puneri Marathi, it is proper to say मी तिथे गेले, but among several of my Marathi acquaintances, I routinely hear मी तिथे गेली. The Deccan College published brief descriptions of the various dialects of Marathi, but the typical grammar books for Marathi do not take any notice of these dialects and simply discuss whether a given usage is or is not included in the "standard" Marathi. Such a discussion of course overlooks the fact that the so-called "standard" Marathi is just one dialect raised to the status of "standard" due to its sociolinguistic prestige. This dialect is said to be the Puneri dialect of the Chitpavan Brahmins that gained in prestige since the political/administrative ascendancy of the Chitpavan Brahmins during the rule of the Peshwas.
