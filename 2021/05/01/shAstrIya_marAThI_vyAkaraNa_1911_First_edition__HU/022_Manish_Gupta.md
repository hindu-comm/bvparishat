I wonder does such doha has still meaning/ or relevant in today's life in India when people are dying due to corona pandemic and lack of oxygen at mass scale. So many people who were true Krishna "Bhakt" has died so badly and mercilessly due to lack of oxygen even though he/she was trying his best to remember Shri Krishna on the death bed.

  

त्यजन्तु बान्धवाः सर्वे निन्दन्तु गुरवो जनाःI  
तदापि परमानन्दो गोविन्दो मम जीवनम्II  
let all my relatives abandon me, let the great people insult me, still I am in supreme bliss since my life is GOVINDA alone.  

  

I wonder does this mantra was created by today's sanskrit scholars or created by Rishi/Muni during vedic era.

  

Thanks,

Manish Gupta
