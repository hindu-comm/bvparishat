Sir,

 Namaste.

  

\<\<The thread initiator says,

invitation of a certain Soma Yaga, probably meaning as part of an invitation card inviting to a Soma Yaaga.  

So the title should be fine.  

You may have a reason to think that the posts are to a wrong thread. What is your reason, sir ? \>\>  

  

Actually I received Shri Krishnan S's message directly in my inbox under the subject "शास्त्रीय मराठी व्याकरण (1911), First edition".

Please see under:<https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/HUO3TXiQC6Q>

 and scroll down a bit.

It's a puzzle for me.

  

Generally you get a message in your inbox, if you respond to any initiator's message (or to any other's message in response to his message on the website). This might have been set as a default.

One could get each message as individual email in one's inbox, if the setting is done like that.

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
