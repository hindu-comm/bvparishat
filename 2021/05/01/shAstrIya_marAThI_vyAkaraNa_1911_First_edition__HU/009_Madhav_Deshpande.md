Dear Narayan Prasad Ji,

  

  As you note, such constructions घेतलीस/घेतली are optional in Marathi, and in my observation they go back to old Marathi. In pre-modern Marathi, we find forms like हे काय केलेसी, while this survives in modern Marathi as हे काय केलेस/केले. My colleague Peter Hook, \[I just now called him up\], says that while such constructions are optional in Marathi, in some languages like Kashmiri they are obligatory. The सि/स in Marathi are probably traces of old aorist forms like अगमासि in old Prakrits like Pali. That is my guess. But a full historical tracing of such constructions would need deeper research in MIA Prakrits and Apabhramsha varieties. I don't know of any existing research on this topic. With best regards,
