Namaste Madam.

  

Thanks for your reply to my query.

  

\<\<This is the 3rd edition, and it is the same as the 2nd edition. But this editionhas a supplement with 12 essays on various subjects written by contemporary professors/researchers.\>\>

  

Unfortunately I do not have access to this 3rd edition. At BORI, this edition is not available.

  

\<\<It also has a short biography of मोरो केशव दामलेwritten by his son द मो दामले\>\>

  

I hope that biography has been updated under the following reference:

    \[Arjunwadkar K S\] व्याकरणकार-मोरो-केशव-दामले-व्यक्ती-आणी-कार्य-2005 (79 pp.)

   

    It is available here:<https://rmvs.marathi.gov.in/495>

   

    Under references, it mentions "सरस्वतीचे लाडके पुत्र" (दत्तात्रेय मोरेश्वर दामिले, सोलापूर १९६६)

   

    Hopefully it might be that itself.

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
