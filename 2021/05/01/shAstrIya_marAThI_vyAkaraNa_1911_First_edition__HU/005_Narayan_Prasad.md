Sir,

  Namaste.  

  Thanks for your reply. I have not seen the 1970 edition. But it must be available in the BORI library. I got a xerox copy of the 1925 edition long ago. I think, on Prof. Arjunwadkar'ssuggestions, I consulted this book in the early 1990s regardingसंकर प्रयोग in Marathi. Doubt arose in about 1981 or so regarding theसंकर प्रयोग "घेतलीस" in "कशी परीक्षा घेतलीस तू?" That time I asked many people about such verb-form that conforms simultaneously to the subject and object. But I did not get any satisfactory reply from anybody.

  

In my comments to the link provided in myprevious email, I have mentioned the missing/ duplicate/ partly cut-off pages. Hope, the site owner will make these pages available later.

  

  Regards

  Narayan Prasad
