\<\<My colleague Peter Hook, \[I just now called him up\], says that while such constructions are optional in Marathi, in some languages like Kashmiri they are obligatory.>\>  

  

Thank you sir for this remark.

I would like to know examples in Kashmiri. I was not aware of this.

  

In "Indo-Aryan Languages" (2003), edited by Cardona and Jain, under Magahi, section 8.1, Sheela Verma remarks (p.512):

\<QUOTE>

Magahi has simultaneous subject and object agreement with the verb in the sentence (see Verma 199la for details).This is a feature not very commonly found in the languages of the world either, with some such exceptions as the Bantu languages of East Central Africa (e.g. Swahili), and the Mayan languages of Central America (e.g. Mam).  

\<UNQUOTE>

  

But seeing theसंकर प्रयोग in Marathi, I remarked in my article "Standardization of Magahi Verb-Forms and the Magahi of Biharsharif":

"Marathi has some stray cases of simultaneous subject and object agreement with the verb, usually found in the case of second person (Damle, 1925:778-779)."
