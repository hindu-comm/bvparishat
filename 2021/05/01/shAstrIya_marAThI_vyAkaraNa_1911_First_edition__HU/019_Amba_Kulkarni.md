Yes, I also saw this (I have a 1965 edition with me), and I know these are very much in use in different parts of Maharashtra.

But when we were taught the 'standard' Marathi in school (during 1970-75), we were told that these are not good usages. This is what I remember from my memory.

So always such usages are jarring to my ear, and I tend to correct the other person or transform it into "correct" usage myself internally before I understand it, when I hear such usages.

  

With kind regards,  
Amba
