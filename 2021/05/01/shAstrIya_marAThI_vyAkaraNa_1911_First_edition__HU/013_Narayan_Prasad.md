\<\<In my Puneri Marathi, it is proper to say मी तिथे गेले, but among several of my Marathi acquaintances, I routinely hear मी तिथे गेली.>\>  

  

Thanks sir for this information.

  

If I apply the usual standard Marathi grammar rule, "मी तिथे गेले" will mean the statement by some female,"गेलो" by a male.

In serials, I frequently hear from female characters verb-forms generally used in case of males -"करतो", "जातो" instead of "करते", "जाते". Sometimes the case is just reverse, i.e. a male character says "मी काय म्हणते ...".

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
