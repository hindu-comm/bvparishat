\<\< 2. Shri. Naryan Prasad:: Sorry sir that the thread reached you with a wrong 'caption' (subject) If the mistake is from my end, please excuse me.>\>

  

Sir,

  It is none of your fault, because the thread initiated by you have a proper subject. But if your message got mixed with other subject on the group website itself, it appears to be a technical problem. I have not experienced such problem earlier.

  The thread initiated by you may be continued, if required.

 Regards

 Narayan Prasad
