This is the 3rd edition, and it is the same as the 2nd edition. But this editionhas a supplement with 12 essays on various subjects written by contemporary professors/researchers.

It also has a short biography of मोरो केशव दामलेwritten by his son द मो दामले, who was a superintendentat Saraswati Mandir at Solapur(where I had my education up to 7th class).

  

कामताप्रसाद गुरु, who wrote the Hindi grammar was influenced by this Marathi grammar book of Damale.

  

His wife's brother was नीळकंठ दांडेकर who was the father of गो नी दांडेकर.

कवी केशवसुत was his elder brother.

  

With kind regards,

Amba
