Dear Sir,

  

Please contact Shri Manish Yashodhar Modi of Hindi Granth Karyalaya, publisher of outstanding books on Jainism in Hindi, Gujarati and English.

  

You may give my reference and contact him on:

  

[Hindipr...@gmail.com]()

  

[gommat...@gmail.com]()

  

He is the best person to guide you in this regard.He is a good scholar of Jainism and their Sanstha is more than a hundred year old.

  

I knew his grandfather and father too,as I hail from Bombay/Mumbai and was a regular visitor to his shop.

  

Best of luck in your search and research.

  

Prof.Siddharth Y.Wakankar
