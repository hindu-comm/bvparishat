This message was shared in KSU mitra mandali group:

  

Professor Pandit M A Lakshmi Tatachar Melkote is NO MORE.

  

Dr.M.A. Lakshmi Tatachar was a rare combination of traditional scholarship with modern research acumen.

He was Prof. of Sanskrit in the Bangalore University. Later he founded the academy of Sanskrit Research in Melkote and nurtured it so well that it has become an international centre for Sanskrit studies.

He has published many books and also research articles.

He was mainly instrumental in collecting numerous manuscripts and preserving them in Melkote.He held many prestigious positions like the Chairman, Centre for literary Research, Indian Institute of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine (IIAIM). He was an embodiment of traditional knowledge and wisdom with a great vision for utility of IKS in current age.

  

His contributions are incredible. Om Shantih. 🙏🙏🙏
