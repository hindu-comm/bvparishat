Prof. Tatachar ji was always seen with a smiling face assuring his knowledge that could be imparted to any one with quest. A geat human being.

  

He was one of the committee members who had recommended to start a Department in Sanskrit at UoH, with an agenda. We'd couple of interactions with him, even later. Great loss to Sanskrit scholarship.

  

Sadgati praptirastu🙏
