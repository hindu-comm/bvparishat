Pāṇini, the Grammarian

  

मुखात् सिंहस्य सूत्राणि मुने: श्रुत्वापि कानने ।

“सन्ति भूतानि भूतेषु” प्रोक्तं साङ्ख्यैरिदं वच: ।।

  

Even after hearing the rules of Pāṇini coming from the mouth of the lion in the forest, the scholars of the Sāṃkhya philosophy said: “The elements of matter are simply resting in other elements of matter.”
