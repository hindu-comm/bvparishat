Pāṇini, the Grammarian

  

व्याघ्रोऽब्रूताहमेवैनं मुनिं खादितवान् वने ।

प्रवादमात्रमेवैतन्मुनि: सिंहेन खादित: ।।

अपण्डिता न जानन्ति मुने: शब्दान् मया श्रुतान् ।

व्याघ्रो व्याजिघ्रतीत्येवं खाद्यमानोऽब्रवीन्मुनि: ।।

  

A tiger said: “It was I who ate the sage in the forest. It is just hearsay that a lion finished him off. The unlearned do not know the words of the sage that I heard. As I was eating him up, the sage gave an etymology of the word “tiger”: “a tiger is one who sniffs.”
