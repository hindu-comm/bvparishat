Pāṇini, the Grammarian

  

मुखात् सिंहस्य सूत्राणि श्रुत्वा कात्यायनोऽब्रवीत् ।

“उक्तानुक्तदुरुक्तानि शोधयिष्यामि वार्त्तिकै:” ।।

  

Having heard the rules of Pāṇini coming from the mouth of the lion, Kātyāyana said: “I will clarify what you said, did not say and your not so well formed rules with my supplemental comments.”
