This poem by the kavi-pandita Prof. Deshpande might be a good starting point for a discussion of Ajivikas, who are usually not much discussed. Though they are classified as Atheists by those use English, the label daishTika (fatalists) may be more suited for them. The sutra of Panini अस्ति नास्ति दिष्टं मतिः। clearly shows that in ancient India, there was a three-fold classification of darSanas, not a two-fold classification. Who were the other daishTikas?

  

I will post links to works about Ajivikas later in this thread.

Senani

  

PS; This new series by Prof Deshpande seems to draw inspiration from Bhartrihari who accomodates all systems of thought in his exposition of Sabdabrahman and the legendary Naiyayika (and critic of Bhartrihari) Jayanta Bhatta who harmonized all the systems in his play AgamaaDambara. Or, may be, one sees in a work, what one thinks about at that moment in time. At least, this series at this stage reminds me of those two works.
