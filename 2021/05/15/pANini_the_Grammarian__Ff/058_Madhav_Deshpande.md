Pāṇini, the Grammarian

  

अक्षराणामकारोऽस्मीत्युक्तिं मनसि चिन्तयन् ।

द्विवारं मुनिरुच्चार्य तं हरिं शरणं ययौ ।।

  

Pondering the statement of Krishna in the Bhagavad-Gita, “I am the letter “a” in the alphabet,” Pāṇini uttered the letter “a” twice \[at the end of his grammar\] and sought refuge in Lord Hari. \[Hari = Lion OR Lord Vishnu\]

  

\[The last rule of Pāṇini’s grammar is “a a.”\]
