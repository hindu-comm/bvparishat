Pāṇini, the Grammarian

  

शिष्टंमन्यैरशिष्टैश्च वाणी विप्लाव्यतेऽनिशम् ।

कमन्यं शरणं यामि सूत्रकारो गतिर्मम ।।

  

Language is always defiled by those who falsely think of themselves to be proper speakers and by those who do not know the proper usage. Who else can I rely on? The grammarian Pāṇini is my final recourse.
