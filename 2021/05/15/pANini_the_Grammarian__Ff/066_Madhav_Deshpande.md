Thank you, Ujjval Ji, for providing a link to my article. It is not widely known among general Sanskritists that Buddhist philosophers like Nāgārjuna, Vasubandhu, Candrakīrti were thoroughly familiar with Pāṇini's grammar and quote his rules while discussing the interpretations of Sanskrit words. The one extensive discussion that comes to my mind is on the interpretation of the term *pratītya-samutpāda*. I remember seeing a Ph.D. dissertation dealing with this topic. So, yes, the Buddhists were very much among the followers of the Pāṇinian tradition. We have well known names like Jinendrabuddhiand Dharmakīrti who wrote grammatical works. As Bhartr̥hari mentions, it was Candrācārya who recovered the almost lost Mahābhāṣya and promulgated its study. This Candrācārya is in all likelihood the same as Candragomin who wrote his own Cāndra-Vyākaraṇa. That Vyākaraṇa shows his deep familiarity with the Mahābhāṣya.
