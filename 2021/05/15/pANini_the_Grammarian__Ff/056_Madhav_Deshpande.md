Pāṇini, the Grammarian

  

प्रायेण शिथिलायन्ते वृद्धानां सर्वसन्धय: ।

वृद्धत्वान्मोक्तुमात्मानं विवेशास्यं हरेर्मुनि: ।।

  

All joints become loose for the aging folks. Knowing this, to free himself from the old age, Pāṇini the sage entered the jaws of a lion.

  

\[sandhi = joints between words / body parts\]
