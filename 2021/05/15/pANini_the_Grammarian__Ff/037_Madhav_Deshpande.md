Dear Senani Ji,

  

The two comprehensive works on the आजीविक sects are:

  

<https://www.amazon.com/History-Doctrines-Ajivikas-Vanished-Religion/dp/8120812042/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Ajivika&qid=1623161553&s=books&sr=1-1>

  

and

  

<https://www.amazon.com/Ajivikas-Beni-Madhab-Barua/dp/1296872521/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=Ajivika&qid=1623161688&s=books&sr=1-2>

  

and a recent article by Johannes Bronkhorst

  

<https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263846727_Ajivika_doctrine_reconsidered>

  

The Ājīvika sects were active during the same period as the rise of Jainism and Buddhism, and the successor of Ashoka donated a cave to the Ājīvikas. Here is a link to the Barabar caves:
