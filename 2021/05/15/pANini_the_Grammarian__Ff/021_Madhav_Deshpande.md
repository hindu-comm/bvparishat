Pāṇini, the Grammarian

  

मुखात् सिंहस्य सूत्राणि मुने: श्रुत्वापि कानने ।

प्रमाणं वक्ति चार्वाको ध्वनिमात्रस्य केवलम् ।।

  

Even after hearing the rules of Pāṇini coming from the mouth of the lion in the forest, the Materialist Cārvāka says that there is proof only for the existence of the sound.
