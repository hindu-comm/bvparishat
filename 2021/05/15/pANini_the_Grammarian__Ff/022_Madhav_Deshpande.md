Pāṇini, the Grammarian

  

मुखात् सिंहस्य सूत्राणि मुने: श्रुत्वापि कानने ।

गीतातत्त्वविद: प्राहु: “नायं हन्ति न हन्यते” ।।

  

Even after hearing the rules of Pāṇini coming from the mouth of the lion in the forest, the scholars of the Bhagavad Gita said: “He does not kill, nor can He be killed.”
