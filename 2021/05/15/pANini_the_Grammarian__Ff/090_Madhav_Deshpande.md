Pāṇini, the Grammarian

  

प्रयुज्य लाघवं केन गौरवं प्राप्यते भुवि ।

लाघवाद्गुरुतां प्राप्तं नान्यं जानामि पाणिने: ।।

  

By using smallness \[=brevity\], who can attain greatness? I don’t know anyone other than Pāṇini who attained greatness by using smallness \[ = maximum brevity in the formulation of his grammatical rules.\]
