Pāṇini, the Grammarian

  

वृद्धिर्न वृद्धिसूत्रेण गुणसूत्रेण वा गुण: ।

वद किं लौकिका: कुर्युस्तव शास्त्रेण पाणिने ।।

  

O Pāṇini, since there is no prosperity from your rule defining prosperity nor any virtue from your rule defining virtue, tell us what can the common folks gain from your grammar?

  

\[The terms Vr̥ddhi “prosperity” and Guṇa “virtue” have been given technical meanings by Pāṇini, and don’t denote their normal meanings.\]
