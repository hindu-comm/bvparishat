Pāṇini, the Grammarian

  

मुखात् सिंहस्य सूत्राणि मुने: श्रुत्वैव कानने ।

शैव: प्राह शिवस्यैव प्रसादाज्जीवितो मुनि: ।।

  

Just after hearing the rules of Pāṇini coming from the mouth of the lion in the forest, the follower of the Lord Śiva said: “The sage is still alive because of the grace of the Lord Śiva.”
