Thank you, Sir.

  

For those interested, both books are available on [www.archive.org](http://www.archive.org) as well. B. M. Barua;<https://archive.org/details/ajivikas00barurich/mode/2u>p and Basham:<https://archive.org/details/in.gov.ignca.2179/mode/2up>

  

There is a new book by Piotr Balcerowicz
(<https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781315726977/early-asceticism-india-piotr-balcerowicz>, also <https://pdf.zlibcdn.com/dtoken/8f7bf6e657c392d8f4278b986c52c936/Early_Asceticism_in_India_%C4%80j%C4%ABvikism_and_Jainism_b_3400009_(z-lib.org).pdf> ) which is seen as a successor to Basham's work. This examines Jaina sources more closely.

  

It may be noted that Ajivikas are mentioned in both Manimekhalai and Silappadikaram, either as not distinguishable from Jainas or as a branch of Jainas. So old South Indian texts might throw some more light.

  

Additionally, the Tattvopaplavasimha by Jayarasi Bhatta (<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.277488/page/n1/mode/2u>p, English translation by Esther Solomon: <https://archive.org/details/TattvaUpaplavaSimhaOfJayarsasiEstherSolomanSchuchitaMehtaParimalaPublications/mode/2up>) could be useful, as it is the only ancient source which presents the viewpoint of the 'Other' sympathetically. Though it is seen mainly as representing the Carvaka school, others have argued using textual evidence that he is not a Carvaka.

  

All the above sources clearly describe the Ajivikas as fatalists; yet, we persist in calling them nAstikas. They should be properly referred to as daishTikas, I think. And the other question remains: who were the other daishTikas?

  

Regards

Senani
