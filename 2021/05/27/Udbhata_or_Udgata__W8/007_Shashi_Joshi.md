Link to the 1930 TR Krishnachary version.

  

What is 124 on the website is 127 in TRK's printed edition.

Some shloka differences are there, but this one shloka is again missing.

And there are also a lot of differences in the shloka words between the website and the printed version.

  

So, some more homework needed to reach any conclusion on this shloka.

Hope it gets resolved either way.  

  
  

Thanks,
