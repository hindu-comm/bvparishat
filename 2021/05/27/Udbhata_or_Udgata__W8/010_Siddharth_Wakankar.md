Dear Sir,

  

I understand your agony,but,the Critical Edition ( prepared by the Oriental Institute,Baroda,where I served for more than 32 years) is based on available written documents in the form of manuscripts etc.

  

We do give weightage to local traditions etc.That is the reason why Manuscripts from the Southern region were given preference in Ramayana and Northern Mss.were given preference while critically editing Mahabharata.

  

Just remember one important thing.

  

Critical Editions are generally meant for the study by scholars,that is for a class and they may not be liked by the general masses.

Even the Lakshmanarekha and Shabari offering berries is not in C.E.and they can't change the perception of the masses who have learnt it through generations by oral tradition,which may not be written in black and white.

  

Hope,this answers your question.

  

Congrats for showing such a keen interest.

  

Thanks and regards.
