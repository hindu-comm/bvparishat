If the scholars here discount that sloka about jananee janmabhumishcha etc just for the reason that it is not found in any printed edition of Valmikiramayanam, is that fair. Of course, if it is only academic discussion with no evaluation on the validity of the idea and the popular belief about it being part of a speech made by Rama, it is okay.. Academics may find it difficult to accept what is not printed in black and white or in the web or using the keyboard.  
But Ramayanam is the fountainheadof faith for millions in India..
and for people, and there are millions around, who are beyondthe
academic circles, the expositions and commentaries by Pauranikas through oral traditions is as authentic as any printed material.  
And when was this critical edition printed ? And how many millenniums ago was Valmiki Ramayanam composed first, and sure, it has passed through many oral traditions over many centuries.  Many centuries
where it might not have been reduced to writing.  
And many slokams could have been added and interpolations would have
happened in the course of about thirty centuries.  
If the thread was merely to state that this slokam is found missing in some editions that is understandable.  
But some wordings, and some thoughts betray the idea that citing this slokam is a very inferior activity if you are an academicscholar  
That implication is dangerous. That requires rethinking.  
Scholarship is there just to enhance the horizons of knowledge.
Surely it should not be a tool for finding fault, or showing something in a darker shade.
