Parameshwar ji,

You have put the screenshot of the website.

I am familiar with the website.

I am asking if there is any print copy of this shloka anywhere.

And if it is part of Ramayana, then why other editions have not printed it.

This shloka (jananI janmabhUmishcha ...) is very famous, and is said to be spoken by Rama to Lakshmana when they first see Lanka. I have tried to find its source, and never been successful either.

  

Also, do you have weblink to the first screenshot of rashtriya sanskrit sansthana that you shared?  

  
  

Thanks,  

\~ Shashi
