Lakshmana-Rekha is in Tulasidas's Manas, but not in Valmiki Ramayana.

  

We also should differentiate between Valmiki Ramayana editions and other versions of other Rama stories.

First one can be only one, other tellings are allowed and accepted but can't be forced onto Valmiki's work.  

  
  

Thanks,
