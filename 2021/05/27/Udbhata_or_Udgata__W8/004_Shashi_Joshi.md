Gita Press Ramayana does not have this shloka, not even the one-liner (as compared to the full 'api svarNamayI lankA na me lakShamaNa rochate\| jananI janmabhUmIshcha ...'

  

<https://archive.org/details/HindiBookValmikiRamayanPartIIByGitaPress/page/n595/mode/1up>

  

I have not found the jannaI janmabhUmishcha shloka anywhere in print.

Not in the GRETL version either.

The Critical Edition ends at 6:116, doesn't even go till 124

  

Would love to have the reference to it.  

  
  

Thanks,
