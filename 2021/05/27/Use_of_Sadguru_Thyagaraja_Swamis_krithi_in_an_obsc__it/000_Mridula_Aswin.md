Dear Scholars!

Namaste.  

The Carnatic Music fraternity seeks to denounce the use of a beautiful krithi, 'entha muddo entha sogaso' of the Vaaggeyakaara, Sadguru Sri Tyagaraja Swami, in the most inappropriate manner, in a recently released Telugu movie, 'Ek mini katha'. This amounts to sheer disregard to the composer and our music heritage.

Similar such atrocious usage of our revered saints' compositions have happened, in an unacceptable way, but this time it has broken all limits of decency. Humbly request the support of all of you to put an end to this sort of blasphemy.  

  

Regards,

Dr Mridula Aswin,
