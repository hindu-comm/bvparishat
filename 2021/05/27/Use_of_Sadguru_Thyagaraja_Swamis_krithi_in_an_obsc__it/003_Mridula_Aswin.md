Namaste Venkat Ji

The intent is not to publicize a movie whose story-line is, to say the least, base. We carry a responsibility to preserve our musical heritage, handed down through generations with a certain sanctity. The Telugu Film industry has handled the sacred compositions of various Vaaggeyakaaras with scant respect since many years, either by borrowing lines from the krithis, sometimes even appropriating them, changing the rAga to which the composition was originally set, or using a krithi steeped in bhakti to eulogize the hero/heroine of the film.  

Every time it happens, there is a brouhaha for sometime, and then the issue is left unattended, unheeded by the industry.  

This time, we do not wish to ignore the issue. They are answerable.  

Also, the common public who watch the movie, may be getting to listen to the beautiful krithi of Tyagaraja Swami, for the very first time, but in such a disgraceful setting. They are prone to misunderstanding the very meaning of the composition. Should that be allowed? Not at all.  

Hence this effort.

There's good news. The film team is working on changing the song as soon as possible.

  

Regards,

Dr Mridula Aswin.
