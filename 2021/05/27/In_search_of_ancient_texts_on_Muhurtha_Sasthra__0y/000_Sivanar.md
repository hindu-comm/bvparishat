SAdara praNAm,

A recent reading from The Hindu is attached.

While perusing it is noted that once auspiciousmoments were named like the Jayanthi.

In the commonly available works in Kerala on muhurtha no such mention is observed.

Hence Honoured knowledgeable scholars may please be kind enough to shed light on the subject.

Namaste.

*Prof. Sivakumar*
