Namaskar Sri Krishna Kadiri Ji, Sri V. Subrahmanian Ji,

Thanks for sending information in this area.

  

I am trying to understand the real physics behind those views. I have seen the blanket statements of Hans-Peter Deurr and R.C Henry. However, I wanted to talk to real scientists who have understood such phenomenon well. Since I could not find an in-depth paper from these two scientist, These two blanket statements looks more like a magazine advertisement rather than a deep paper on physics. I want to see real deeper papers which talk things in depth.

  

There are several articles like :

<https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-many-interpretations-of-quantum-mechanics/> (hidden in the paper sent by Sri Krishna Kadiri Ji)  

<https://bigthink.com/13-8/quantum-mechanics-buddhism> (sent by Sri Krishna Kadiri Ji)  

<https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/what-does-quantum-theory-actually-tell-us-about-reality/> (the one I sent earlier)  

  

These articles are useful since they go one step further. However, I want to talk to someone who has worked in this area so that I can ask questions to get to some deeper understanding.

  

I have a friend who works in MIT Lincoln lab in the high energy physics area. I will check with him soon.
