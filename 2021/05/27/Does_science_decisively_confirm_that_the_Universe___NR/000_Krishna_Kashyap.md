**Does science decisively confirm that the "Universe is a mental construction" ? (loosely translated as "dristi sristi vada" of Vedanta)

**

**Some people have stated openly:**

**However, This is an overstatement of what science currently tells us**. **Quantum physics tells us that the observer affects reality**. read this blog below from a reputable publication: **Scientific American:** for details.:

***the conclusion states:***

  

*"If nothing else, these experiments are showing that we cannot yet make any claims about the nature of reality, even if the claims are well-motivated mathematically or philosophically. And given that neuroscientists and philosophers of mind donâ€™t agree on the nature of consciousness, claims that it collapses wave functions are premature at best and misleading and wrong at worst."

I have not done extensive research on this topic. Please send me up to date information, so that we can understand physics as it is understood by Scientists.
