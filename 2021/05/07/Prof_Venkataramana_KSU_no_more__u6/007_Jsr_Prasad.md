I was dumbstruck as it is heard from my colleague, Prof. Amba ji. We would have benefited a lot in Sanskrit academia if he were not abruptly withdrawn by the almighty. An irreparable loss to us.

  

Still I couldn't digest this great young scholar sending us an email on 4th May and today he is no more. We pray for his Sadgatis.
