very sad indeed. and today we lost prof. Tatacharya too. he too supported BVP and came to Udupi conference.

but it is a warning to all of us to be extremely carefull about Covid.
Neglecting it in the early stage will lead to the fatality. I request you all to take precautionery measures.

  

I miss Venkataramana. we worked in Jaipur and bengaluru. he was a rare scholar well versed in Nyaya and Vyakarana. I plan to write a detailed note on Venkat soon.

  

it may not be out of place to post here that founding message of BVP was posted by Prof. B V Venkataramana on 14.1.2009.

Dear scholars,

 My pranams to all. On behalf of sri pandurangiji,i am very much glad to inform you that today,on this auspicious makara sankranti day, Bharatirya vidvat parishat group isofficially launched.. Though we tried to get some message of our Vice chancellor to launch this parishat, but unfortunately we were unable to get that and we will try to get it on another day. As it is officially launched now,i request you to send on your messages regarding ur projects, articles, publications etc, so that everyone can share the knowledge.

 Starting with me, at present i am working on a commentary, tattva chintamani aloka of Paksha dhara mishra.For this sakemanuscriptscollected from different places are being studied and later i hope to bring outa publication of that commentary. Soirequest all of the scholars to help me by passing the information regarding manuscripts, if u can.



Thanking you,

B.V.Venkataramana,

Asst.Prof, Dept ofDarshana,

Rajasthansanskrit University,
