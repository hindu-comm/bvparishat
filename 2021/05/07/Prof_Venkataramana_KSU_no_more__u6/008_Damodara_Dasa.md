Praying for his Krishna Conscious journey and destination. I pray that  
he gets a good next body which is conducive (anukula) for moving  
forward towards dharmic life with parama dharma -- Krishna Bhakti (SB  
1.2.6) which can only take one beyond liberation (moksha).  
  
Just a few months back we learnt Basic of Nyaya course from him  
online, and his teaching skills were uncomparable (very similar to  
Adaraniya Mani Dravid Sastrigal). I benefited a lot from learning  
nyaya under him. I contacted him to see if he can learn and teach us  
Tattva-sandarbha, to which he replied affirmatively saying that first  
he needs to take time and read the grantha. His humility despite  
scholarship is remarkable; something rare in today's age.  
  
Besides this, he had good sentiment towards Lord Krishna -- he started  
his classes with "Sri Krsnaya Namah" and a verse from Dhruva (SB  
4.9.6):  
  
dhruva uvāca  
yo ‘ntaḥ praviśya mama vācam imāṁ prasuptāṁ  
sañjīvayaty akhila-śakti-dharaḥ sva-dhāmnā  
anyāṁś ca hasta-caraṇa-śravaṇa-tvag-ādīn  
prāṇān namo bhagavate puruṣāya tubhyam  
  
TRANSLATION  
  
Dhruva Mahārāja said: "My dear Lord, You are all-powerful. After  
entering within me, You have enlivened all my sleeping senses—my  
hands, legs, ears, touch sensation, life force and especially my power  
of speech. Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto You."  
  
May he get blessings of Dhruva Maharaja.  
  
  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,
