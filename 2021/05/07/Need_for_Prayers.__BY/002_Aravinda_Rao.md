Sri Ramachander ji,

All our prayers are with him.

Confidence is one of the best medicines for covid. Please advise him not to be afraid.

Incidentally, my wife and I are also on covid medicines for the last four days,due to what I think is a mild attack. Recovered well, I hope, in home isolation.

Aravinda Rao
