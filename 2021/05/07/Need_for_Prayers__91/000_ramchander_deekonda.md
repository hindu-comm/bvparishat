Respected Scholars,

  

My brother, Dr. D. Narasinga Rao, a senior sanskrit teacher, who has been teaching the language on various national and international fora for four decades, has been suffering from Covid-19. He is on ventilator. He needs prayers of all his friends and well-wishers.
Please pray for him.

  

Regards,

Ramchander Deekonda
