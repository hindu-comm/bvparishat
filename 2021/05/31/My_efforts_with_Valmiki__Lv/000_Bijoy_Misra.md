Friends,

Good morning.

I have another episode from Valmiki. I am doing these to channel the story with

my interpretation of the poetic interest of the poet. My thinking is that each of the

episodes may be played out as pieces of dance or drama, or even musically

rendered.

  

The English article is at

The Hindi translation was released today I am attaching below.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
