The context of Sri Pradip Bhattarji's remarks comes in the context of an author trying to challengea perceptionwhich many scholars believe to be true thatSri Ganguli did translate the Mahabharatahimself.

The same question can be asked about all writingswritten during the colonial era by foreign rulers and visa versa.

Though it may be unpatriotic for an American to say many Americans believein the theory that NASA did not send men to the moon.
