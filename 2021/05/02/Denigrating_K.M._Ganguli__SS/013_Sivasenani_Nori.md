What I can say is that on the numerous occasions that I did check K. M. Ganguli's translation, there were no issues with it: it stays close to the original, is accurate and very readable. The long quote of Sri Debroy is from one document which - unlike a judgement - need not be taken as the final position of the administration of that time, on that matter. Even if Sri Debroy and Sri Bhattacharya are avoiding the *res*, we can, and should, look at that. Any examples of where K. M. Ganguli's work is deficient may be brought forth, if such are found. Such discussions are more fruitful.
