A rather disturbing paper that seeks to denigrate the unparalleled achievement of K.M. Ganguli. It is like Lytton Strachey's "Eminent Victorians" debunking great names to gain publicity. No one has noticed that M.N.Dutt who also translated the Mahabharata, plagiarised the entire Shanti and Anushasana Parvas from Ganguli. His sole contribution was to distribute Ganguli's prose sloka-wise.
