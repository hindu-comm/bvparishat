Ngarajji,

What is interesting is Sri Bibek Debroy does not comment on the scholarship of the work,

he is concerned about the authorship and the personality of Sri Ganguli. A critical evaluation

of the "first translation" would have been more valuable. I agree we are non-experts on historical

details (like I learned lately that Mt Everest was measured by an Indian cartographer who  

worked for the British officer.) These examples are rampant during the British period. it

is quite possible that Mr Ganguli did not do the work but got it published in his name.

Such activities continue in the present time also in various forms.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra .
