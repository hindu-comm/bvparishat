The article of Sri Bibek-ji in OPEN is for the most part quotes from differentsources.

  

He is almost making the long references speak for themselves.

  

We here are no experts on the topic.

  

We need not take sides.

  

Sri Pradip Bhattacharya who definitely is a greater expert on the topic than us definitely deserves to respond.

  

But Sri Bibek-ji is also an expert on the topic.

  

We can only watch the discussion as non-expert readers on the topic.
