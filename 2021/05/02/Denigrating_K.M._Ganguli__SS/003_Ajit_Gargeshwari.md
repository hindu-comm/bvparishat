Misraji Namaste,

  

Those are the views Of Pradip Bhattacharya with reference to blog. Pradip Bhattacharya is profound scholar of Mahabharata and has several books to his credit. He perhaps can justify his allegations.

[Pradip Bhattacharya – Indologist, Mahabharata scholar](https://pradipbhattacharya.com/)

One can read his reviews of several books at [Rethinking the Mahabharata by Pradip Bhattacharya (boloji.com)](https://www.boloji.com/articles/3676/rethinking-the-mahabharata)
