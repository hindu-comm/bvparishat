The rhythm has three mis'ragati (3 + 4 maatraas) ganas followed by a khandagati (5 matras ) gana.

  

LLLGLL- LLLGLL- LLLGLL- GLG  

3+4      3+4     3+ 4     5

  

There is one very popular Sanskrit borrowed Telugu meter Mattakokila

  

with similar rhythm

  

but with

  

GLGLLGLGLLGLGLLGLG pattern

  

 GLGLL- GLGLL - GLGLL - GLG

  3+4    3+4    3+4   5

  

But it is presented as

  

Ra- Sa- Ja- Ja- Bha- Ra

  

GLG- LLG- LGL- LGL- GLL- GLG 

Ra-   Sa- Ja-  Ja-  Bha- Ra 

  

Similarly the one on hand would be

  

LLL -GLL- LLL-GLL- LLL-GLL- GLG  

  

Na Bha Na Bha NaBha Ra
