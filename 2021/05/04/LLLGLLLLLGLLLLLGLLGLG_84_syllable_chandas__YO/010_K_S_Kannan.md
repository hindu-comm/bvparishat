There are many beautiful metres which show rhythmical patterns

not transparent in the *gaṇa*-wise scansion. Such merits deserve a special study.

So too many *akṣara-vr̥tta*-s which happen to be *mātrāvrtta*-s too alongside,

though their rhythms are obscured by the *gaṇa*-wise scanning.

I gave a glimpse of these in a workshop at IIT-M.

  

Newer gaṇa-formations taking 4 syllables at a time or even 5 etc.,

can lead to discovery of newer patterns and structures.
