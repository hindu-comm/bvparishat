Thanks, Sushil Sharma-ji. It is very useful to know that it is called madanasaayaka in at least one reference and that there is another pattern also given the same name in some other reference.

  

छन्दोरचना (in Marathi) by Madhav Julian (Madhav T. Patwardhan) seems to be a useful and interesting work. Is there a pdf version available ?
