Namaste,

  

This (LLLGLLLLLGLLLLLGLLGLG, or 'नभनभनभर' in गण notation) appears to be a relatively rare वर्णवृत्त, not listed in most of the well-known reference works on Sanskrit prosody.

  

The verse cited ( जय निरामय... जय त्रिजगत्पते) is verse# 38 in the 15th स्तोत्र of स्तुतिकुसुमाञ्जलि by the 14th century Kashmirian poet जगद्धर भट्ट.  

  

In his छन्दोरचना (in Marathi), Madhav Julian (Madhav T. Patwardhan) lists this meter as मदनसायक. He cites the सद्वृत्तमुक्तावलि (Shaka 1630) by निरञ्जन माधव for calling it मदनसायक, but also remarks that निरञ्जन माधव has not provided the basis/references or background details for his naming of this and some other rare meters. Madhav Julian also writes: "*In Sanskrit, the 32nd stotra (the शरणागतोद्धरण स्तोत्र) of जगद्धरकृत
स्तुतिकुसुमाञ्जलि is in this मदनसायक meter. Several verses of stotra-s15th and 31st (of the same *स्तुतिकुसुमाञ्जलि* ) are also in this meter.*"  

  

However, it gets complicated when we note that both Velankar (in Jayadaman) and the Appendix II of the Revised and Enlarged Edition of VS Apte's The Practical Sanskrit English Dictionary list some other meter (different from the one we are talking about here) as मदनसायक. According to these, मदनसायक would be (LLLGLLLGLGLLLGLGLLLGLG , or 'नभजभजभजग' in गण notation.

  

Regards,
