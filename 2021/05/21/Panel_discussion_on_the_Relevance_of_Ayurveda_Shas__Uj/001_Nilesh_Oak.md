Great initiative.  
  
I had the pleasure of facilitating the discussion on Ayurveda at the 2020/21 WAVES International conference. I am closely working with them in conducting DOEs for the last 2+ years and since then have added 6+ Ayurvedacharya to this small research/DOE group. The covid pandemic has distracted these efforts to some extent. On the other hand, it has also provided an opportunity to study some specific aspects of Ayurveda via Datamining.
