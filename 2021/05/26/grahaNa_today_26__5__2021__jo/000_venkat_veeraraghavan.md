Dear Vidvans,

  

The attached documents from Veda Dharma Paripalana Sabha propose an ammendment to existing panchangas for certain parts of India.

  

There is a chandra grahaNa in certain parts of India today (26/5/2021).

  

If you are situated there or know people there please forward as appropriate.

  

Kind regards,

  

Venkat
