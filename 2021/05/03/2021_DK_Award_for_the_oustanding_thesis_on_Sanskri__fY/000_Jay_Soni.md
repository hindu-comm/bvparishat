Dear Colleagues,  
It is my pleasure to announce the winner of the 2021 DK Award for the  
outstanding thesis on Sanskrit and related fields. In a unanimous  
decision the panel of adjudicators have selected the following thesis  
out of eight as the winner:  
Andrea Lorene Gutiérrez, Faculty of the Graduate School of The  
University of Texas at Austin: “A Genre of its Own: A History of  
Pākaśāstra and Other Culinary Writing of Early India.”  
  
On behalf of the Adjudicators and the IASS I congratulate Dr Gutiérrez  
on this fine achievement.  
  
Usually the Award is coupled with the World Sanskrit conference, which  
unfortunately had to be postponed because of the Corona pandemic.  
Further details about the eight theses and the adjudicators will be  
announced at the Canberra WSC in 2022, in whatever form it takes.  
  
The next DK Award for the outstanding thesis on Sanskrit and related  
studies will be in 2024.  
  
See the IASS website for details about the conditions and also the  
previous winners of the DK Award inaugurated in 2006:

With congratulations to Dr Gutiérrez and best wishes,
