नमस्ते श्री कौल महोदय!

  

  

\<\<If youare comfortable with VB6, you could use VSOP87,which is not as up to date as Swiss Ephemeris but then it does serve the purpose of dating the events from 10000 BCE up to 10000 CE!\>\>

  

BTW, do you mean VSOP87 is available for the public along with its complete code?

I did have a few programs (e.g. calculations ofअधिकमास and क्षयमास), originally written by me in QuickBasic, but later converted to VB6 by a friend of mine. But I could not transfer them on the later version of PC.

  

Whatever QuickBasic program you have got, I would like to get it as a text file. At least I will be able to see. I can convert that to Fortran77, which is supported on Windows 8.1.

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
