Namaste  

  

Kindly use this download link for Peter Duffet Smith book

  

[Astronomy with your Personal Computer \[PDF\] (pdfroom.com)](https://pdfroom.com/books/astronomy-with-your-personal-computer/8Pe5xrORgnN/download)  

  

But you will not find how to calculate Rahu and Ketu true positions in this book.
