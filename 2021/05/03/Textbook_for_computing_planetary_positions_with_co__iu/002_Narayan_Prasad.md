Thank you very much sir for the pdf file of the book "Astronomical Algorithms". I purchased the same book in October 2002.

But it does not give the derivation of the final formulae.

  

I have been trying since long to catch hold of any such book. I even visited IUCCA. But to no avail. The only book that gives detailed derivation of the formula used for computing Moon's position (and general equations for other planets) is in Marathi ("ग्रह-गति-सिद्धान्त" by शिवराम गणपतराव पवार, published in 1968), but which does not use any single mathematical symbol in English. Six sample pages (414-419) are attached as .jpeg files.

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
