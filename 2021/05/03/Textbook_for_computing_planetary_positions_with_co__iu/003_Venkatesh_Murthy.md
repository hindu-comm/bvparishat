Namaste

  

The book I sent has all the details. On page 413 the Appendix III it gives the periodic terms for every planet. Chapter 32 has explained how the heliocentric positions can be found with the help of Appendix III periodic terms. Chapter 33 has explained how the geocentric positions can be found from the heliocentric positions. Everything is there and explained nicely.
