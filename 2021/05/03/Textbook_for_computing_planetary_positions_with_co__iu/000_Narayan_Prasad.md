Dear Scholars,  

   Namaste.

   I would like to know the publication details of some textbook for computing planetary positions with complete derivationalhistory of the final formulae used.

   I have read Spherical Astronomy by W.M. Smart. It gives derivations for some basic equations related to planetary motion, but nothing about how to compute planetary positions.

   Regards

   Narayan Prasad
