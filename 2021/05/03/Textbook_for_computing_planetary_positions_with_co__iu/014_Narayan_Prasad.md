Thank you so muchश्री उज्ज्वल महोदय for this link.

I have successfully downloaded it and try to open the QuickBasic program written by me more than 20 years ago.

It does open it successfully, but the program which was running earlier, now gives error at certain line number.

Earlier this program was running without problem and giving correct results.

  

Of course, in 32bit PC, I had to use double precision for certain variables. But in 64 bit, it may not be necessary.

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
