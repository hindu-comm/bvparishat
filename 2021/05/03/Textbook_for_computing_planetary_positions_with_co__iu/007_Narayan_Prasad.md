Shri A K Kaul Mahoday,

  Namaste.

  

\<\<Once you get the book, pl. let me know so that I could send you the computer programs>\>

  

Thanks to Venkatesh ji, I have successfully downloaded it.

  

\<\<( In Basic/Qbasic,/Quick Basic) on-line or off-line so that you do not have to do the keyboarding---an arduous chore!>\>

  

I am used to QuickBasic, but such programs are not supported by Windows 8.1. I was able to run some programs written by me on Windows 7.

Do you know how to run QuickBasic programs on Windows 8.1?

I would like to get the offline version. Link of the online version could also be supplied.

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
