Shri Kaul ji,  

  Namaste.

  

  \<\<I am afraid I will not be able to convert DOS based programs to text format since there is nothing like copy-paste outside of Qbasic etc>\>

  

  No, you are not supposed to do copy/paste. The QBasic has the facility to save either as .BAS or as .TXT. Open the file and then save it as .TXT. Then send it as attached file, or whichever way is convenient to you.

  I have the software "qb45". This has that facility.

  

  \<\<Since Shri Vishwas Vasuki has given a pointer to Quick Basic in 64 bit version, I think you should first try the same for Win8.2.>\>

  

 Does this version accept the DOS version of QBasic codes?

 Have to write to Shri Vishwas Vasuki, or do you have the link where to get that 64bit version of QBasic?

  

 Regards

 Narayan Prasad
