Shri Narayan Prasadji,

Narayanaya Namah!

Since Shri Vishwas Vasuki has given a pointer to Quick Basic in 64 bit version, I think you should first try the same for Win8.2.

I am afraid I will not be able to convert DOS based programs to text format since there is nothing like copy-paste outside of Qbasic etc.

All I can do is send you a couple of programs to start with which you which you can try in Qbasic64 bit version.

Regarding VSOP87, it was sent to me by a friend from West Germany quite sometime back.

It contains the entire data and generates the details in a set format. It is without lunar elements but you can integrate them in the same from some other source.

If you so desire or if some other members are interested I can share it on [mediafire.com](http://mediafire.com).

I have been playing around with it and I enjoyed it much!

With regards and Narayanaya Namah!

A K Kaulo
