Shri Narayan Prasad ji,

Narayanaya Namah!

The best and easiest book available as on date is:

Peter Different Smith: Astronomy With your Personl Computer.---Cambrige University Press, 1985.

It must be available in pdf also but I have not been able tofind it.

In any case it is available with Amazon.

Once you get the book, pl. let me know so that I could send you the computer programs

( In Basic/Qbasic,/Quick Basic) on-line or off-line so that you do not have to do the keyboarding---an arduous chore!

If you somehow find the pdf version kindly do share it with the forum so that other members could also benefit from the same!

With regards and Narayanaya Namah!

A K Kaul
