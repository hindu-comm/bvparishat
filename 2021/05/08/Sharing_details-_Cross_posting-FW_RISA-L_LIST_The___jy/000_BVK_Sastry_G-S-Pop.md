Namaste



1. Sharing the details of **37th Annual Sanskrit Tradition in the Modern World Symposium - **Friday 28 May 2021- which will be held online, hosted by the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies.

Sanskrit Traditions in the Modern World (STIMW) is a forum for the discussion of the Sanskrit traditions of South Asia, and the texts and cultures that have risen out of them. It brings together established and rising academics for the focused examination of research pertaining to various aspects of South Asia’s rich Sanskrit religious and intellectual culture. It thereby seeks to sustain and build upon the long history of scholarship in this important area of study.



2. **Anyone willing to review ‘Ayodhya Verdict related Dharma Shaastra influence on Legal deliberation’ can share their views. **

****‘BVP’- Thinking – Practice on these matters may not be to the liking of International academia. (Irrespective, the stand can be voiced).



3. The key concept to deliberate would be 



 3a**) What is ‘Devasvam’ ?** ( including the pachyderm, cows and horses beyond valuables)

Property ownership /Management rights of ‘Devalaya’ as an institution vested for management with ‘ Archaka’, ‘ Temple Trustee’, Worshipping Community, State, Successive generations ?



 3b) **What should be the terms of honouring property marked as
‘Daana (datti – in kannada) ? ‘ **

Honouring the will of the donor ; Living with the threats of ‘ encroaching Temple Property’, challenges of non-legal/ non-corporate ‘ Devataa’ as guardian entity, preventing all other human

intervention ? Fear of ‘Paapa’ ? Greed for ‘Punya’ ? Religion-Economy- Nexus of ‘ Head of Institution and transfer of Tradition in a value compliant mode.



 3c**) Nature of ‘ (Hindu-)Mandir’ as a ‘legal institution’ under ‘Tax law’ and ‘ legal jurisprudence’**.

( May be Relevant for Save Temples /Recover devataa- kshetra’s – Private Worship places as ‘ Hindu Mandirs’.)



Note: Hon. ( Late) Justice Rama Jois was a great scholar on this topic; and established a ‘ Law school’ at Karnataka for deliberation on these matters pursuing ‘ Yajnavalkya’s guidelines’ forming basis of Indian Constitution. The legal legacy goes to the writings of MM P.V.Kane.
