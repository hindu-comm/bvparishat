To the best of my knowledge the jayanti utsavam of Sri Ramnuja acharya is based on Solar calandar. His jayanthi is on (Souramana) Chittirai Mragashirsha Nakshetram, which falls on Apr 18th 2021.

  

Sri Sankara Jayanti is based upon lunar calendar. (Chandramana) Vaikaasa Sukla Panchami, which falls on May 17 this year
