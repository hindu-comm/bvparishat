Prof. Sastry-ji,

  

Can you kindly explain how is this related to Sanskrit ? You mention Sanskrit in the title of the thread. This group is focused on Sanskrit and related Bharatiya stuff.

  

You definitely might have some relation in mind. But your post did not communicate that so far.

  

Thanks and regards,

  

Nagaraj
