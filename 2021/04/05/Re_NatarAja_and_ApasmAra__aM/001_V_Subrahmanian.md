Thanks for the article. It has always occurred to me that the idea conveyed by Apasmara under the trampling feet of Shiva is: Ignorance subdued by Knowledge. This idea is admitted in the article, at the end://At the ethereal level that Nataraja trampling the demon epitomises the ability of knowledge to dispel wisdom.//    I think the word 'wisdom' is by mistake; it aught to be ignorance.
