I salute the saattvic nature of Prof. Kannan who ignored the slight and explained his policy of using the avagraha.

  

The short message of Sri Krishnaprasad might not have been intended to offend, but it does so.

  

The tone is jarring, as if a beginner is being advised. Surely, a learner or master of Sanskrit should be capable of better expression.

  

Secondly, it is improper that the the very definition of a good scholar is asked to consult a good scholar. For starters, if one goes by upaadhi, Prof. Kannan's titles are mentioned in the email, a Doctor of Philosophy, a Doctor of Literature and a Professor at a prestigious institution. If one goes by vyutpatti, anyone who has even a fleeting familiarity with BVP knows the knowledge of Prof. Kannan. What is especially insouciant is that Prof. Kannan sets and expects high standards in avoiding mistakes. There have been long debates of the optional doubling of consonants. One ought to pause and think for a while before dishing out advice on orthography to such a person.

  

Finally, familiarity with Sanskrit literature would expose anyone to the fact that Avagraha is used differently across works. For the record, I prefer a limited use, but there is nothing sacrosanct about using it to indicate lopa of 'a' only after 'e' and 'o'. One can argue that in Savarnadeergha-sandhi, there is not lopa but aadeSa and that if we cannot always indicate that change, say, in surendra, ans therefore it is better to limit avagraha to indicate lopa. Constructive discussion is beneficial and enjoyable and so is welcome, irrespective of age and accomplishment of the participants. The very shortness of the comment is a dosha here. All the indifference and offensiveness would still be worth ignoring, if there were *res,* but that is also absent.

  

BVP would benefit if we conduct discussions in a dignified manner, showing some restraint. विद्वान सर्वत्र पूज्यते, it is said. Let us do so.
