Thank you Krishnaprasad-ji for your input.

  

As far the *avagraha*, the policy here is clear:

It has been used to indicate *pūrvarūpa-sandhi* as usual,

and in addition, for *savarṇa-dīrgha* (all types feasible) also

\- immaterial of whether it is a simple *sandhi* situation

or a *samāsa* situation.

This has been adhered to fairly uniformly

(exempt rare typos).

The double *avagraha* indicates the commencement of  

the latter word with a *dīrgha* letter.

  

Others might have used *avagraha* to cover  

only some of the above aspects. But I have tried  

to be more user-friendly.

  

Thank you for your concern.

Regards
