For the benefit of others I am writing this. But the concept of avagraha is modern there is no hard and fast rules(see Bhaimi for more details. Hence no question of dispute). As prof said he has made is own conventions which is not at all a problem. and the below rules I am writing here is accepted widely.  

the examples and counterexamples are here:

  

**1.examples avagraha (ऽ) representing hrasva a(अ)**

रामोऽवदत् = रामः अवदत्

तेऽत्र= ते अत्र

**2.examples avagraha (ऽ) representing deergha a (आ)**  

रामो वाऽत्ति= रामो वा अत्ति

यथाऽऽगच्छति= यथा अगच्छति

  

**The below exs; are wrong**.

सूत्राऽर्थः

रामाऽऽलयः

because these are compound words.
