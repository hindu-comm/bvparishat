Dear Siva Senani Ji,

  

  Thank you so much for this inscriptional evidence for the use of Avagraha sign in its new context. Yes, it is some 1200 years old, and yet in the available manuscripts it does not become commonplace. As this sign is introduced in this new context, it already represents a particular interpretation of older texts, and often such interpretations are contested in the commentaries on texts like the Bhagavadgita. In any case, it is good to know the beginning of its use in writing. With best regards,
