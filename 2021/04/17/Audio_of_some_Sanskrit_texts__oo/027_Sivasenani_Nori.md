Below are instances of avagrahas in inscriptions, along with images of the inscriptions, the earliest one being around 800 AD. So, we can say usage of the sign has been occurring for at least 1,200 years.

  

I found one instance of avagraha being used around 800 AD, the 32nd regnal year of Dharmapala, in the Khalimpur Copper Plate inscription.



In his report on the plates, Kielhorn states: "The sign of avagraha is employed three times, in grāmo ఽsya, 1 31, tato ఽsmābhis, 1 52, and yathā ఽsmābhir, 1 49” ([Epigraphia Indica, Vol 4](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.70026/page/n293/mode/1up), p. 244). Though image of a plate is included, it is too small to really see the avagraha. He adds an interesting footnote: “The sign of avagraha occurs once (in line 8) in the Kotā inscription of Devadatta of Vikrama Samvat 847 (?) and once (in line 5) in the Gwalior inscription of Bhojadeva of Kannauj of Vikrama Samvat 933, *Ep Ind* Vol 1 p 159. In the Ghosrāwā inscription it is used no less than seven times, but in the Badāl pillar inscription only twice.



I looked up the references given.





In the Koṭa inscription, the context is



येषां भूतिरियं परेति न परैरालोक्यतेऽर्थार्थिभिर्येषाम्मुद्विभवः परः (Hultzsch, E. “A Buddhistic Sanskrit Inscription from Koṭâ.”*Zeitschrift Der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft*, vol. 38, no. 3/4, 1884, pp. 546–552.*JSTOR*, [www.jstor.org/stable/43361692. Accessed 20 Apr. 2021](http://www.jstor.org/stable/43361692.%20Accessed%2020%20Apr.%202021)). The date is given as Samvat 841 and could be 919/20 AD, or some other date as the era is unknown. No image of the avagraha could be found by me.





In the ‘second’ Gwalior inscription of Bhojadeva (<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.69993/page/n186/mode/1up>), avagraha is used in the following context: तथाऽनेनैव स्थानेनास्मिन्नेव सम्वत्सरे

The particular letters have been highlighted in the figure above. It may be noticed that avagraha is not used between ‘sthānena’ and ‘asmin’, while being used between ‘tathā’ and ‘anena’. Eugen Hultzsch, who transcribed and translated this inscription, describes the inscription as written in incorrect Sanskrit, and gives the date as 876 AD (933 Vikrama Samvat).



Though Kielhorn mentions that there are no less than seven occurrences of the avagraha in the Ghosrāvā inscription available at <https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.530439/page/n339/mode/1up>, I could not locate them, yet.



In the Badāl pillar inscription ([inscription image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Badal_Pillar_Inscription.jpg), [text and translation](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.70004/page/n190/mode/1up)), which is dated just after 900 AD, avagraha occurs in the following occasions:



तस्य पत्नी वव्वाभिधाऽभवत्। (line 17) and धर्मावतारोऽवदत् (line 21). Both instances are highlighted in the inscription below:

Another instance of the avagraha is in the copper plates of Vākpatirājā of Dhāra, dated 974 AD. The image is reproduced below (from [The Indian Antiquary, Vol IV, p52](https://archive.org/details/TheIndianAntiquaryVolVI/page/n75/mode/1up)) with the line where the avagraha occurs being highlighted:





![image.png](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/2c4c13f26db9e/image.png?part=0.4&view=1)  

The particular line (line 25, when numbering starts from the first 7 in the plate reproduced above), line reads:

लं बुद्ध्वाऽस्मद्वंशजैरन्यैरपिभाविभोक्तृभिरस्मत्प्रदत्तधर्म्मादायोयमनुमन्तव्यः पालनीयश्च उक्तं

It would be noticed that in the same line an expected avagraha between dharmmādāyo and anumantavyaḥ is missing.

PS: The charming image of Garuda holding a snake in the last figureis etched on a copper plate.
