Namaste



Here is an additional input on ‘avagraha’ as ‘ masking of अ’ coming from None other than Patanjali, taking the interpretation challenge deeper in to grammarians tradition. This in a way settles the antiquity
and authenticity of usage also \[ at least in voice, if not the script\].

 \[ I am not diverging to masked अ in mahavakya context triggering vedantacharya debates pl.\]. 



**Reference**: Paspashanika



**Context:** vyakarana adhyayana - prayojana : 



**Key term to focus**: Patanjali’s Explanation of ‘Vak-Yoga’ in two ways , explicitly; **without need for scripted ‘avagraha’**.
