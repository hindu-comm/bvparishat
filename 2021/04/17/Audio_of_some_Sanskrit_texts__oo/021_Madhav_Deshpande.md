  On Avagraha. In 1972-73, I was reading with a student at Michigan W.D. Whitney's edition and translation of the Śaunakīya Caturādhyāyikā alias Atharvaveda Prātiśākhya. There was a rule *vivr̥taṃ \[karaṇam\] svarāṇāṃ* and the next rule was given as *eke spr̥ṣṭam*. The first rule was rendered as "the *karaṇa* for vowels was open," and the second as "According to some it was in contact." Whitney thought that the second rule proposed an alternative that did not make any sense whatsoever. At that time, I made a note to myself that the second rule actually must read *eke 'spr̥ṣṭam*\[= *eke aspr̥ṣṭam*\], and the two alternative descriptions were simply "open" versus "without contact."

  Later on I took it upon myself to produce a critical edition of this text with the help of some 20+ manuscripts, and among those manuscripts most did not use the avagraha at any place, but one or two manuscripts that did use the avagraha had the reading एकेऽस्पृष्टम् as I had suspected.

  The moral of the story is that the use of an avagraha in such cases is a rather late development, and therefore, while reading older texts with older manuscripts, we have to be careful. On this particular issue, different commentaries on the Bhagavadgitaread नासतो विद्यते भाव: or नासतो विद्यतेऽभाव:.

  With best regards,
