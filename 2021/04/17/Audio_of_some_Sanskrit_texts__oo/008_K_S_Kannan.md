I am thankful to Professors Sivasenani Nori and Ujjval for their generosity.

  

I have admiration for the work of Krishnaprasad-ji, especially his creation of new fonts

and creating searchable versions of many texts, which is no small service..  

He has anyhow made amends for what must have happened somewhat inadvertently.

  

I am fortunate to be a member of this Parishat which has many *guṇa-grāhin*-s.

Though I endeavour not to err, mistakes can happen, and the many *sahr̥daya*-s here

are always keen to lend a helping hand, for which I am grateful.
