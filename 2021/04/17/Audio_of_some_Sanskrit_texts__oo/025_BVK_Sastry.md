Namaste Nori and Ramakrishnan ji



1. I agree with you that \< shift in the usage and meaning associations with the term ‘avagraha’ needs to be investigated. 



 ***Summary Point***: When ‘ Vedic documents / resources are
subject to Scholars -Academic study and interpretative freedom,
allowing violation of ‘ Language -Tools- rules provided by Vedanga-

resources’, and a ‘ Documented living ( Healthy or otherwise) tradition, we can continue to amuse ourselves about the intent of text as ‘ Jnana’ - or- ‘a-jnana’ upadesha.



2. Here is another case that may be of interest for analysis for ‘Print use of avagraha’.



 **Resource** : Bharatiya Vidya series No.12 \[ Vikrama Samvit 2003/ A.C.1947\] - Vedabhashya sara of Bhattoji Dikshita - Edited by Pandit R.N.Patankar - Page 11.



** Point for analysis** : Grammarian Bhattoji Dikshita is providing a 'Vedanga -Nirukta - Guidance Handbook' .

The teaching is on how Veda should be studied-taught according to Vedanga tradition, combining Vyakarana and Nirukta'.

The primary resource he is drawing upon is Sayana Madhava Veda Bhashya. The rig-veda -mantra is given in the snap shot.

The focus is on the analysis of the term 'dive-dive' and its print-presentation with 'avagraha' in pada-patha.



**Careful reading of 'original commentary' shows 'dive-dive' is ONE WORD, without ' intervening अ ' . The repetition is due to 'veepasaa'. **

**In Pada-patha, the display of 's-mark -avagraha is shown. **

**This ‘ unwarranted symbol here, could lead to the interpretation-confusion in splitting the vedic term ending up in unintended contrary meaning'. A simple ‘dash (-) could have been better.**



The print typography composition is the result of having lost the technicality of 'avagraha' as a ' word-separator' and pointing to the new meaning of ' invisible अ '

A letter which can be freely introduced by scholars fancy ! When later teaching schools live by the ‘ errors of scribing’ at the cost of ignoring the source tradition, the disaster can be inferred.

Select excerpt from the mail below for reference : 



 1A) related to symbol ‘s’ (unicode 093D) used as a marker to indicate ‘ masked अ (Unicode 0905). 

 1B) Technical term not related to ‘ अ’ - as \< तस्य पूर्वपदमवग्रहः। ….. the element 'deva' is called avagraha. \> 



 1C) Panini referred technicality in (8-4-26:
छन्दस्यृदवग्रहात्। 8.4.26 ॥ - **छन्दसि **ऋत् अवग्रहात् इति पदच्छेदः।
**ऋकारान्तात् अवग्रहात् पूर्वपदात्** उत्तरस्य णकारेदेशो भवति छन्दसि विषये। नृमणाः। इति काशिका।ऽ

 **अवगृह्यते विच्छिद्य पठ्यते इत्यवग्रहः **ऋच्चासाववग्रहश्चेति ऋदवग्रहः। इति न्यासः, पदमञ्जरी च। वार्तिकम् - महो वा छन्दस्यानङोऽव**ग्रहदर्शनात्।** (Under 4.2.36 - पितृव्यमातुलमातामहपितामहाः।) महाभाष्यम् - महो वा पुनरेष भविष्यति 

**छन्दस्यानङोऽवग्रहदर्शनात्। छन्दस्यानङोऽवग्रहो दृश्यते - पिता-मह** इति। प्रदीपः - **तेन पदसंज्ञायां सत्यां**** पितेत्यवग्रहो भवति**।





As noted in this exchange on ‘avagraha’, there seem to be different technicalities related to ‘avagraha’ ; The ‘Paninian -Vedanga’ Technicality of ‘Avagraha’ was not limited to ‘ अ’. ; Paniian technicality of ‘avagraha’ was more connected with ‘ Chandas’ ( it is only one sutra where Panini has referred exclusively to ‘avagraha’. ).
