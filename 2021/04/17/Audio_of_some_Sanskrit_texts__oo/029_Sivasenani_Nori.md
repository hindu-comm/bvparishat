नमो विद्वद्भ्यः।

  

My sense is that there are not too many technicalities.

  

1\. For more than a couple of thousand years, if not more, avagraha means and continues to mean the first element in a separable word. In other words the definition of Nyaasaअवगृह्यते विच्छिद्य पठ्यते इत्यवग्रहः remains a valid definition\[1\]

2. The symbolऽ is used afteran avagraha, in padapATha. Due to this association that symbol itself came to be called avagraha.

3\. This usage of separating a component in saMhitA using this symbol was extended to laukika works also.

4\. Over a period of time, a settled practice evolved - from at least 1,200 years ago - to use the symbolऽin the case of a missing a or aa.

  

Point. no. 4 is in addition to the first three and does not replace the first three. It is an Agama, not an AdeSa, to use grammatical terms.

\[1\].I say continues to mean because when Vikriti pAThas of Veda are taught, even today, this terminology of avagraha and इङ्ग्यम् is used. For instance the rules for making vikriti (say 1 2 2 1 1 2 3 3 2 1 1 2 3 , 2 3 3 2 2 3 4 4 3 2 2 3 4, ... for ghana) is valid onlyfor what are called saamaanya padas; these rules change for a) upasargas, b) ingya, c) saamaanya pragraha and d) ingya pragraha. We think that the rule for vikriti pAThas is always the same, but that is not so. For instance, there is what is called sapta-pada-ghana (2 3 3 2 2 3 3) which occurs for samaana padas or tulya padas (where every syllable and svara is similar like नमः नमः in namakam).
