Sir

  

Namaste. In the words underlined by you, भूयांसोऽपशब्दाः, बहवोऽपभ्रंशाः योऽवाग्योगवित् are all valid examples of the usage of the sign avagraha, but not परत्र वाग्योगविद्। I am sure that you did not mean to include परत्र वाग्योगविद् as an example of the sign avagraha, and highlighted it only because the entire discussion revolves around Vāgyogavit. I am taking the liberty to add a few lines of explanation, mainly to avoid confusion for those who might not have studied Paspaṣāhnika thoroughly.

  

The two interpretations of the latter half of the verse (सोऽनन्तमाप्नोति जयं परत्र वाग्योगविद्दुष्यति चापशब्दैः) are not on account of a missing अ. Rather, it is about which noun and verb should be taken together as forming one sentence. The pUrvapaksha view is thus:

Siddhanti: कः (दुष्यति चापशब्दैः)?

Purvapkashin: वाग्योगविदेव।

Siddhantin: कुत एतत्?

Purvapakshin: The sloka should be parsed as follows: यः तु कुशलः विशेषे व्यवहारकाले शब्दान् यथावत् प्रयुङ्क्ते सः परत्र अनन्तं जयं आप्नोति। वाग्योगवित् च अपभब्दैः दुष्यति। Therefore, it is the Vāgyogavit who is burdened with the sin of Apaṣabdas whereas the one who uses Sabdas correctly attains endless victory in heaven (paratra, a place beyond here - i.e. stays in heaven for a very long time).



The Siddhantin dismisses this absurd view and presents the correct interpretation: यः वाग्योगवित् तु कुशलः विशेषे व्यवहारकाले शब्दान् यथावत् प्रयुङ्क्ते सः अनन्तम् आप्नोति जयं परत्र च। अपभब्दैः दुष्यति। (Vāgyogavit attains heaven and also liberation – anantam, the endless eternal state of Brahman. Cf. ब्रह्मविदाप्नोति परम्। तै. उ. आनन्दवल्ली॥ As Prof BVK Sastry garu himself mentions so many times, this Vāgyogais a Brahmavidyā. If it is asked how two mutually incompatible results are possible, here is the resolution: paratra jayam is the sādhāraṇa phala available to one who practices, the viseshaphala of anantam is available to the one who attains perfection of Vāgyoga - because usage of correct Sabdas is both a means to accruing dharma and a means to liberation)\[1\].



Now, the question again arises कः अपशब्दैः दुष्यति?

The answer is that the subject of this second sentence is not supplied in the Sloka and so, that it should be taken as someone else, अन्यः aअवाग्योगवित्।

  

While this is clear from the context, we have additional clarifications from Kaiyaṭa and Nageśa.

Kaiyaṭa in Pradīpa (gloss on the Mahābhāṣya) says: प्रकरणात्सामर्थ्यं बलीय इत्याह – अवाग्योगविदिति।

Prakaraṇa (context) and Sāmarthya (fitness) are two technical terms of both Mīmāṃsā \[2\] and also Vyākaraṇa \[3\], both used to determine the meaning of a sentence. The usage of Prakaraṇa here does not straight away meet the Mīmāṃsā definition of उभयाकाङ्क्षा प्रकरणम् (Prakaraṇa is that where there is mutual expectancy) and Vyākaraṇa does not do balābalanirṇaya of the two terms, that is seen in Mīmāṃsā.

Therefore, Nāgeṣa in his gloss on Pradīpa called Uddyota, clarifies:प्रकरणादिति। संनिधेरित्यर्थः। Prakaraṇa here should be taken as proximity.

  

Then, the explanation is that though the words "Vāgyogavit" and "duṣyati" are close to each other (proximity), on account of fitness (सामर्थ्यम्), Vāgyogavit should be read as the subject of the verb āpnoti, and not duṣyati, because fitness prevails over proximity.

\[1\] The interpretation of this Sloka is mine, not found in any text to my knowledge, but the sense is consistent with the overall teaching of Munitrayam and Bhartrihari.

\[2\] Śruti, Liṅga, Vākya, Prakaraṇa, Sthāna and Samākhya are six pramāṇas, in decreasing order of preference listed in Mīmāṃsā to decide the correct interpretation of a text (एतस्य (विनियोग)विधेः सहकारिभूतानि षट्प्रमाणानि श्रुतिलिङ्गवाक्यप्रकरणस्थानसमाख्यारूपाणि। - अर्थसङ्ग्रहः।).

\[3\] Bhartṛhari enumerates 14 hetus for fixing the meaning of a Sabda (which can mean word, sentence or discourse amongst others) in the Vākyakāṇḍa of Vākyapadīyam.

वाक्यात् प्रकरणादर्थादौचित्याद् देशकालतः। शब्दार्थाः प्रविभज्यन्ते न रूपादेव केवलात् ॥ 2.314॥

संसर्गो विप्रयोगश्च साहचर्यं विरोधिता। अर्थः प्रकरणं लिङ्गं शब्दस्यान्यस्य सन्निधिः॥ 2.315॥

सामर्थ्यमौचिती देशः कालो व्यक्तिः स्वारादयः। शब्दार्थस्यानवच्छेदे विशेषस्मृतिहेतवः॥2.316॥

The last two verses are often quoted by Ālaṅkārikas as well.
