I would like to echo the appreciative comments that many other more illustrious members of this list have expressed. Thank you Sri Sivasenaniji.

  

An interesting note perhaps is that the oldest available printed edition of the Taittiriiya pada pATha from the now defunct Vaidikavardhini Press in Kumbhakonam uses the - symbol after the “real” avagraha and uses the S like symbol or SS symbol for the loss of the akAra or AkAra.

  

If the S like symbol has been described, then it should mean that at least the pada pATha was written long time back.

  

Ramakrishnan
