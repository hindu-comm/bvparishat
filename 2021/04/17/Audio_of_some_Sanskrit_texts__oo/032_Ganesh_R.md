Dear Sri. Nori Sivasenani garu,

  

I am very happy and grateful to you. I also join with Prof. Kannan in admiring and thanking your multifaceted erudition. Yes, nowadays such honest and dispassionate scholarship that is rooted in truth, flowering as innumerable aspects of learning and bearing delicious fruits of educating the needy is becoming a rarity. I remembered your illustrious grand father's writings that are replete with such interdisciplinary learning.

  

  

With utmost respectful regards

  

Ganesh
