गद्य here is not 'prose' at all the way we understand it in English.

  

Yes, you are right when you say,

  

"However, judging from the rhythm, alliteration, onomatopoeia, etc. of these गद्य pieces, they were probably meant for dramatic public readings or even singing in the आलापstyle."

  

The most well known and popular गद्य that people are familiar with through regular hearing from All India Radio at least, is Sri Venkateswara Gadya.
