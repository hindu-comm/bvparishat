Thank you, Professor Kannan, for rendering this service to both Sanskrit and classical music.

  

Few recordings of Sanskrit prose compositionsin the classical genre are available. However, judging from the rhythm, alliteration, onomatopoeia, etc. of these गद्य pieces, they were probably meant for dramatic public readings or even singing in th आलापstyle. In this regard, the renditions of सीताविवाहचूर्णिका and श्रीरङ्गगद्यम् are valuable to the Sanskrit and music community.

  

If I may, I would also request you to attempt a rendition of the श्यामलादण्डकम् and other दण्डककाव्य-s. Few recordings of theश्यामलादण्डकम् are available, and in my opinion, only one of them is satisfactory. Numerous otherदण्डककाव्य-s lie hidden from the broader public.

  

May I hope that Sanskrit writers of the past and present may find greater recognition through these compositions, just as Dickens achieved his greatest fame through the public readings of his novels.
