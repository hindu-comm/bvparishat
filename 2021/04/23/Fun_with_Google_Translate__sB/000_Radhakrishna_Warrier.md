I had learnt a little Mandarin more than seven yearsago and tried today to remember a few question words in that language. I couldn't remember any. So tried Google translation of the words "What?", "Why?",
"When?", "How?", "Which?", and "Who?". Google translated all the words into Mandarin except "who?". Tried Hindi, but again Google did not translate "who". Tried a few other Indian languages and got the same result. Google did not translate "who?".

  

See the attached document for the details.

  

Finally, I tried a language totally unfamiliar to me, namely Tajik. But I knew that Tajik is very close to Persian, only it is written in the Cyrillic script common with Russian and a few other languages. One word in Tajik gave me the clue to why Google was not translating "who". Or rather what Google thought the word "who" to be.

  

Can any of you say what Google thinks "who" is? ðŸ™‚
