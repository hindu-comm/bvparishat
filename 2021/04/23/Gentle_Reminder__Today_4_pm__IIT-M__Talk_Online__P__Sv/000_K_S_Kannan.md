**Abstract**:

  
The talk focuses on how ancient Indic, particularly Vedic thought/philosophy, can be and has been understood towards the grappling with and solving social issues such as domination, exploitation etc., in ways contrasting with the contemporary critical theory. On the one hand, past attempts to try to understand Indian thought through the lenses of materialist-idealist dichotomy are reviewed; and on the other hand, materialist and other philosophies employed to develop various approaches in critical theory are contrasted with the ideas in Indian philosophy that deal with some of the social issues focused on by critical theory. Similarities and differences between critical theory and the portions of Indian thought are taken up for discussion in emphasizing their action-orientation while being explanatory and normative.
