Just for your information:

The very modern word "Adivasi" (supposedly introduced by Christian missionaries operating in the North East) is loosely defined, and has caused dangerous misunderstandings in society. Like in traditional literature, calling them "forest jaatis", "forest dwellers" or "forest tribes" would be more accurate.
