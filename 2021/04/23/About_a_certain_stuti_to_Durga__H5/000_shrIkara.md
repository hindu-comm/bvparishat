I noticed a stotra on [sanskritdocuments.org](http://sanskritdocuments.org) ([link](https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_devii/durgAstuti.html)) which gives the essence of the durgA saptashati. Could anyone point me to the source of that stotra, if possible? Was it from any purANa/tantra/kalpa or was it composed by any Kavi, I would be interested in knowing.
