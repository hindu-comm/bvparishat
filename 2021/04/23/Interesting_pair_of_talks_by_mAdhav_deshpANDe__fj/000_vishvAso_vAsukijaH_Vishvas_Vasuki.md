Overall good and informative. Some minor disagreements I could recall off-hand (as I type this half sleepy).

  

\- The meaning of pratyabhivAdana. It is not abhivAdana ( "देवदत्तोऽहमभिवादये") as MD consistently says, but the response to it ("चिरञ्जीव देवदत्त") - the latter being pluta for ashUdra-s/ astrI-s.

\- "brAhmins complained to the buddha that the non-brAhmins are spoiling his words". No. The exact words of the brAhmaNa-origin bhikkus - एकम् अन्तं निसिन्ना खो ते भिक्खू भगवन्तं एतदवोचुं – ‘‘एतरहि, भन्ते, भिक्खू नानानामा नानागोत्ता नानाजच्चा नानाकुला पब्बजिता। ते सकाय(=स्वकीयया) निरुत्ति(क्त्)या बुद्धवचनं दूसेन्ति। हन्द मयं, भन्ते, बुद्धवचनं छन्दसो आरोपेमा’’ति। Should have said "non-elites" instead of non-brAhmins.  

\- "pANini can be said to be an ancient pAkistAni, and we can be proud of it." Eek. The concept of pAkistan (not just the शब्द, but the अर्थ) is of recent vulgar origin - and has no connection to pANini (beyond accidentally squatting on the same piece of land after grinding "jAhil" memories to the dust). It is foolish, when not malicious as in case of other\[?\] "South Asianists", to spread that nonsense (as in the case of labeling museum Hindu artifacts "South Eastern South Asia").
