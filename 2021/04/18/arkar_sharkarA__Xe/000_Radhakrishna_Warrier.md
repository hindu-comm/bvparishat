I like preparations that use jaggery or sugar, so let us discuss this sweet topic today. 😊.

  

I believe the oldest word for sugar is the Sanskrit Śarkarā (शर्करा) probably because of the similarity of candied or crystalline sugar to gravel.

  

The word for either jaggery or sugar is derived from Sanskrit Śarkarā in most of the modern Indian languages.

  

In Malayalam, Śarkara is jaggery. Sugar is Pañcasāra. Less commonly, sugarcane jaggery and Palm jaggery are called by a tadbhava word cakkara. Cakkara is more used as a term of endearment equivalent to English “Sweetie”.

  

For sugar, Tamil has carkkarai, Kannada has Sakkare and Telugu cakkera (also pañcadāra) all tadbhavas of the Sanskrit Śarkarā. But the word for jaggery in these languages are Vellam, Bella and Bellam respectively. (Besides Śarkara, Malayalam uses Vellam too for jaggery.)

  

In Hindi sugar is Śakkar (tadbhava of Śarkarā) and jaggery is Guḍ (गुड़).

  

In Gujarati sugar is Khāṇḍ (ખાંડ) and jaggery is Goļ (ગોળ)

  

In Punjabi, sugar is Khaṇḍ (ਖੰਡ) and jaggery is Guḍ (ਗੁਡ਼)

  

Wonder from where the Guḍ (गुड़)/ Goļ (ગોળ) and khaṇḍ/khāṇḍ came. So also, the source of Vellam/Bella/Bellam. And where did MalayalamPañcasāra / TeluguPañcadāra come from?
