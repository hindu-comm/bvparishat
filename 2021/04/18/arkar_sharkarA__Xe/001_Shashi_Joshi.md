In Hindi, there are three words:

chini - refined white sugar

shakkar - small yellow balls of sugar cane sugar almost looking like small ball bearings.

guD = the lump of sugar cane extract before refining too much.

  

guDaH is Sanskrit for molasses, from which the guD of tadbhava are coming

  

khANDa is also used in Hindi as well. comes from Sanskrit khaNDa, khaNDaka

khANDavaH is sugar candy, also name of the forest.

  

Apte lists bahala as a kind of sugarcane. That 'may' be for Bella/Vellam
