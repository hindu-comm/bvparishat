Dear Mr. Kushagra,

  

Wonderful Rachana \_/\|\_

This sketch is amazing! Did you make it by hand, or did you use computer graphics?

  

The reason I am asking is that I have a whole chapter from Shukraniti where the Nitikar has outlined the proportions of idols of different deities and for several years now I have been looking for someone who could be interested in rendering drawings of the deities based on the description.

Do you think you would be interested in a project like that?

  

Best wishes,

margie
