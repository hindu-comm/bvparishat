Dear Nilesh,

  

You say the following...

  

2. RRMY(sic) has already created a strawman (rather Strawmen) with every single claim of mine or my co-researchers he is claiming to refute. He has created a strawman fallacy and that is enough reason for rebuke. Yet, since very few comprehend Nyayadarshan and still fewer dare to point out, this may be lost of many.

  
3. I read his above blog on Sushruta and supposedlyrefutation of my claim. I assert it is not a refutation of my claim and I could not find anything that closely resembles scientific acumen, logical reasoning, or common sense.  

  

  

...but you do not offer any contradictory evidence or a carefulargument to show how RRMR (not RRMY) has built a strawman and destroyed it or that he is bereft of logical reasoning and common sense! Gosh, go easy, sir...

  

You say your work on Susruthais available elsewhere in your talks, but you do not refute what RRMR cites in his article about what you claim about the antiquity/dates of Susrutha.

  

You also assumethat "few" people on this list are able to "comprehend Nyayadarshan". Dare I say that this is an "interesting assumption", uncalled for, unless you have read all our horoscopes and decided that we were born retards :-)

  

Are we talking past each other here?

  

I think this issue could be really interesting if investigators carefully unpack evidence, highlight contradictions/conflicting data, and offer new ways of interpreting the data. Yes, you may believe that you have offered clarification elsewhere, evidence somewhere else, and countered a similar argument in yet another place. But those clarifications and refutations are not made available here, or you have not summarized them here. I remember Michael Witzel using similar red herring fallacies on another discussion list, some two decades and more ago, and people telling him to stop dropping citations but get to the simple data or piece of evidence to refute the argument that he was seeking to counter.

  

When you say -- "I could not find anything that closely resembles scientific acumen, logical reasoning, or common sense" -- it is nothing more than abuse, and this cannot and should not be the language or the tactics used for discussions on this scholarly list.

  

We need to get past ad hominems, non sequiturs, red herrings, and grandiose assertions if we are interested in pursuing the truth, and therefore if anyone points out weaknesses in your methodology or in your collection and analyses of data s/he should be welcomed as adding to the good pursuit of the truth, or whatever comes closest to it, or s/he should be refuted carefully, thoroughly, and not dismissed with abuse.

  

Be invested in the process, sir, not the outcome, as you, who keep asserting about your scientific rigor, scientific temper, and scientific methodology, should very well know.

  

Best wishes,

  

Ramesh Rao
