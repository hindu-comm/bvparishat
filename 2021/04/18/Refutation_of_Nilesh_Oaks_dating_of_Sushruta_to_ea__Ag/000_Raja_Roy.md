Respected members,

  

I am pleased to share my next blog refuting Nilesh Oak's dating of Sushruta to earlier than 5,561 BCE.

[Sushruta Sanhita was NOT written over 7,500 years ago \| by Dr. Raja Ram Mohan Roy \| Apr, 2021 \| Medium](https://rajarammohanroy.medium.com/sushruta-sanhita-was-not-written-over-7-500-years-ago-649b40391fdd)  

  

Next Saturday 24 April, 2021:**Refutation of Nilesh Oakâ€™s astronomical dating of Ramayana to 12,209 BCE: Part 1 of 10 - Understanding Vartak-Oak hypothesis**

  

Best regards,

Raja
