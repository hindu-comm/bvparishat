Dear Nityananda Ji  
  

As you stated correctly, everyone's time is precious, let me repeat the title of his blog:  

  

# Sushruta Sanhita was NOT written over 7,500 years ago

# Sushruta Sanhita was NOT written over 7,500 years ago

**\[Sushruta Samhita was NOT written over 7500 years ago  
Refutation of Nilesh Oak's dating of Sushruta to earlier than 5,561 BCE\]  
--  
Why these are strawmen?**

# Sushruta Sanhita was NOT written over 7,500 years ago

# Sushruta Sanhita was NOT written over 7,500 years ago

# Sushruta Sanhita was NOT written over 7,500 years ago

## 1. I have *nowhere* claimed that the timing of Sushruta Samhita (*based on internal evidence of Sushruta Samhita or otherwise*) is over 7500 years ago. *thus RRMR claiming he is refuting such a claim is a Strawman.*  2. I have indeed asserted that *based on the triangulation of genealogy evidence* from *Sushruta Samhita, Garuda Purana, and Mahabharata*, *the timing of Sushruta* indeed goes back to before the Mahabharata times (5561 BCE).  This evidence does not require any astronomy/seasons/months evidence from Sushruta Samhita.  Yet what RRMR is discussing is evidence of seasons/months/lunar months from Sushruta Samhita,ad nauseam.  This has no relevance to my inference of Sushruta before 5561 BCE based on genealogy evidence of Sushruta Samhita, Garuda Purana, and Mahabharata.  *Hence Strawman, again. * Your comments?  Warm regards, Nilesh Oak
