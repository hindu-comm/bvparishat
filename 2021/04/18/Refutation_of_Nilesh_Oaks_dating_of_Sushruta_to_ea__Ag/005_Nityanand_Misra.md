I think it is not sufficient to merely say that somebody has created a strawman fallacy. It is also important to show why you think it is a strawman fallacy. So coming to Dr. Raja Ram Mohan Roy's well-written article, could you please show with context why you think it is a strawman fallacy? I did not know you were a scholar of Nyāyadarśana (are you?). If you are, it would be great if you could answer some specific questions I have on Śābdabodha by Naiyāyikas and some interpretations in the *Padakṛtya* commentary by Candraja Siṃha on the *Tarka-saṅgraha*. Please let me know.

On the contrary, I find that he has argued well. To be fair to Dr. Roy, it is fairly scientific and logical: specific points are raised and addressed. In contrast, I did not find any specific contradiction or counter-argument to the points he has raised in your email.

  

Dr. Roy has shown exactly where two different lists of seasons and their corresponding month-pairs occur in the same chapter of the same text. Anybody would agree that this needs to be addressed if we are dating a text on the basis of one of these. The way Dr. Roy addresses it is to argue that the second mapping is a later insertion/interpolation and cites Tilak in his support: again a fairly scientific and logical approach. If one reads the Ayurveda-Rahasya-Dipika commentary, it discusses this differently including the possibility of geographical differences and also that the first mapping is in the *adhikāra* of *rasa-bala* while the second is in the*adhikāra* of*saṃśodhana*. This is also a possibility, but Āyurveda scholars are best qualified to comment here. From a linguistic perspective, the words‘iha tu’ introducing the second mapping need to be explained. The word‘tu’ often connotes a difference of opinion/context or contradiction with what has been said/cited earlier. Why does the text give one set of seasons and their mappings earlier and a second later which begins with ‘iha tu’? Does ‘iha’ specify the location in time (at this time) or place (in this place) or context (in this *śāstra*****or***adhikāra*)? What are your views on this?

I am happy to discuss, but since this is originally a debate/disagreement between Dr. Roy and you, I think it is only fair if you invite him to the discussion first. I will be happy to join and moderate. A three-way discussion would be even more educational, though I would first like to see your specific counter-views to the point that is raised by Dr. Roy. If you ever visit Mumbai, you are welcome to meet me and we can do this vide face-to-face (even more educational).

Since not everybody has the time and patience to go through all the talks to search for a specific counter-view, can you please answer the following

(1) have you addressed the issue raised by Dr. Roy of two different lists of seasons and

\(2\) if you have, can you please point out where

  

Thanks, Nityananda
