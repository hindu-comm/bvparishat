I don't know what happened and why the title of the blog got posted multiple times. My apologies.  
  
The entire blog is about refuting my claim of Sushruta before 5561 BCE and strawman claim of Sushruta Samhita before 7500 years ago! If you re-read the blog, you will see my name in the title, too, assuming you don't deny sub-title is part of the title. (see attached)  
  
This is a strawman fallacy.  
  
Why just title, the entire content of the blog is the prerogative of the author. The point is it is a misrepresentation of my position/assertion. Many ranters and emotional creatures don't go beyond the title anyways. They would rather rant than read/watch the stuff (both sides), in the original.  
  
In addition, nowhere RRMR clearly states what is his assertion/claim for the timing of Sushruta and/or Sushruta Samhita. Nyaya speak, that is Vitanda. I don't need to explain this to a knowledgeable individual like you. For the benefit of others, e.g. Nyayadarshana 1:2:3. Folks may also refer to Charaka Vimanasthan 8.  
  
You have avoided the issue of Strawman. I will wait for your response.

One may watch the entire presentation but specifically from 13:34 min through 16:43 min.

This explores the possible timing of these seasons/lunar month references, internal to Sushruta Samhita (SS), and possible timing of their updates and insertions. Introduction of Pravrutta and removal of Shishir throws a curveball and hence my sensitivity analysis. Notice, SS or Charak Samhita (CS) commentators have shown compulsion to carry out such sensitivity analysis (your attachments) precisely for this reason. It has confused many and this includes commentaries you quoted (individual trying to reconcile/comprehend and make sense of seasons and corresponding lunar months or solar months and thus the timing of the updates).  
  
Thank you for quoting Sharangadhar's list of seasons and corresponding Zodiac. I wonder if you have truly comprehended the plausible implications of the Sharangdhar list in the context of astronomy. This may explain the confusion of all SS (or even Charaka Samhita) commentators and/or may provide plausible timing that would make folks fall from their chairs.I will leave this to you as your homework!

My claim for the timing of Sushruta has to do with genealogy, consistency of genealogy, and triangulation of it via Sushruta Samhita, Garuda Purana, and Mahabharata and nothing (Nada) to do with any internal months/season references of Sushruta Samhita.  
  
Most of the confusion in this question/comment \[SS around 4000 BCE, 5000 BCE, 3000 BCE, 2000 BCE down to our times\] is due to confusion between my claim vs Strawman + poor understanding of astronomy on the part of RRMR.  
  
Any elementary student of Indian astronomy and modern astronomy ought to know the shift of the lunar month of about one month, with respect to the season, every \~2000 years.  
  
Yet, RRMR calls it, in his words:  
  
**"I am going to call this hypothesis as “Vartak-Oak hypothesis”. According toVartak-Oak hypothesis, seasons consist of different pairs of luni-solar months as time changes."  
**  
Even here, he creates another '*Strawman'* viz. Luni-solar months. The reality is that the shift in the season with respect to the month every 2000 years (due to the precession of the Earth's axis, of course) is with respect to lunar months and not the solar months (unless of course the solar months are identified with zodiac names rather than season names based on cardinal points and tropical year...as opposed to sidereal solar year)  
  
And in case you think he is simply acknowledging this trivially true, albeit with insertion of his strawman and confusing the matter further, yet very important and significant phenomenon, especially for Indian antiquity research and maybe praising Vartak and Oak for educating him on it, think again.  
  
He concludes his blog, with the following words:  
  
**"I have referred to Oak’s scheme of things in this article and named it “Vartak-Oak hypothesis”. What is it? What is its basis? What is its validity? Is there evidence for it? Are Oak’s highly touted astronomy poison pills really poison pills? I will answer all these questions and refute each astronomy poison pill pertaining to Rāmāyaṇa in my next series of articles on the refutation of Nilesh Oak’s astronomical dating of Rāmāyaṇa to 12,209 BCE."  
**  
I have asked RRMR to add refutation of my assertion of Mahabharata in 5561 BCE to his list of refutations.  
  
If an individual exhibits such poor knowledge of astronomy, yet remains cocky, does he deserve a detailed response?
