Dear Mr. Oak,

  

If you have not used the evidence of seasons/months, then what is the discussion ofSuśruta Saṃhitā 1.6.10 about in

1. Fascinating Validation Of Sushruta Samhita \| Nilesh Oak \| #SangamTalks. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIuKuYZ-bd8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIuKuYZ-bd8).

2. Sushruta & his Samhita - P9 - Sushruta graced Bharat 7500 years ago!. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvHqPKyfLyg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvHqPKyfLyg).

3. Sushruta and his Saṃhitā — Part 9— Sushruta graced Bharat atleast 5561 BCE!. [https://medium.com/@mitra/sushruta-before-5561bce-34b7155a93bb](https://medium.com/@mitra/sushruta-before-5561bce-34b7155a93bb).  

  

You should listen to what you have said in Sangam Talks at 15:50. Why did you do that knowing fully well that Suśruta Saṃhitā 1.6.10 contains conflicting information?

  

Further, you say the following in a medium article:

"Per this arrangement, the timing of Sushruta Samhita can be considered to be that of our times or may be about 2000 years ago. This then remains the limitation of dating effort based on internal evidence of Sushruta Samhita."  

But this limitation is because you did not quoteSuśruta Saṃhitā 1.6.6-7, which gives the standard list of seasons and months. Thecombination took place according to your own scheme of things between 1500 BCE to 500 CE.

This invalidates your dating of Sushruta in your own scheme of things, which I have stated. I have made no misrepresentation.

  

Raja
