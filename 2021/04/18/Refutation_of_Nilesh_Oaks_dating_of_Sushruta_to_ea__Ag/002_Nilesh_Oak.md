Namaskar Shri Nityanand JI  
  
A brief note.  
  
1. I am glad this Manthan is happening.  
2. RRMY has already created a strawman (rather Strawmen) with every single claim of mine or my co-researchers he is claiming to refute. He has created a strawman fallacy and that is enough reason for rebuke.
Yet, since very few comprehend Nyayadarshan and still fewer dare to point out, this may be lost of many.  
3. I read his above blog on Sushruta and supposedlyrefutation of my claim. I assert it is not a refutation of my claim and I could not find anything that closely resembles scientific acumen, logical reasoning, or common sense.  
4. I am glad that you found his writing 'COGENT and CONVINCING'. This is 180 degrees opposite of what I have said. Thus you and me discussing can be very educational for both of us and those who would get to listen to this. If you are a game, we can discuss this via forums such as Sangam Talks, Jaipur Dialogues, Sattology, or on my own YouTube channel.  
5. My works on Sushruta and specific claims (and correspondingevidence) are available via Sangam Talks+ 10 part series in Marathi and English atTejomayabharatYouTube channel.  
  
Warm regards,  
Nilesh Oak
