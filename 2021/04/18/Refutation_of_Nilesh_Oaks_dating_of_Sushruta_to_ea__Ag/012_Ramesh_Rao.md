Dear Nilesh,

  

These responses from you, despite Nityanand ji'scareful attempts to engage you, are not only giving us observers no insight, information, or leads but feel more like authoritarian commands to us to go down with you into a rabbit hole. These flailings, this casting of aspersions, the lack of rigor in your responses, thedisrespect you are showing those who seek to engage you, is really unfortunate.

  

If indeed you do not care to respond to criticism of your work, then maybe we should all worry about the consequences of your work, similar to the work by a namesake of yours.

  

Nityanand ji graciously offered to moderate the discussion between you and RRMR. Instead of accepting it as a great opportunity to validate your work, you have turned on him now.

  

I look forward to reading RRMR's promised series of articles refuting your other claims.

  

Regards,

  

Ramesh Rao
