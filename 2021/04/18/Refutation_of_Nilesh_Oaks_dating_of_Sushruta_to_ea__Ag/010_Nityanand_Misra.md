Dear Nilesh Ji  
  
Firstly, your response has is high on ad-hominem, hot air, and unwarranted comments which do not add any value to the discussion and are not suited for a scholarly list like this. Let us savour some examples: “ranters”, “emotional creatures”, “rant”, “it has confused many”, “I wonder if you have truly comprehended”, “confusion of all commentators”, “will make folks fall from chair”, “I will leave this to you as your homework”, “confusing the matter”, “educating him”,“poor knowledge of astronomy”, “remains cocky”. May I know what purpose do such expressions and comments serve on a scholarly list? Somebody can bring up your “poor knowledge of Sanskrit” (quoting your own words on this list that your “Sanskrit knowledge is, at best, rudimentary”) and leave some basic Sanskrit learning “as your homework”. Would that add anything of value? So let us avoid ad-hominem comments, unwarranted remarks, and have a civil discussion.

I stated in my previous response “I think what Dr. Roy has assumed (I may be corrected here) that it was Sushruta indeed who composed the \[initial version of\] SS.” If one assumes/believes that it was Sushruta himself who composed the first version of Sushruta-Samhita, then there is no strawman fallacy; for then the date of Sushruta-Samhita would have to match the date of Sushruta. If oneassumes/believesthat Sushruta had nothing to do with the current available text of Sushruta-Samhita, then it is a different matter. You may clarify your assumptions/beliefs and the reasons for them and Dr. Roy may clarify his.

You have not even mentioned, let alone addressed, the first (original?) list of seasons and season-month mapping in SS 1.6.6-7 either in your video from 13:34 to 16:43 or in your below response. So this is certainly not a specific response. Your video only mentions SS 1.6.10 where we have a second and different list of seasons and a second and different season-month mapping. That is precisely the objection raised by Dr. Roy which you have still not addressed on this thread.

Please that is is not *pravṛtta* but *prāvṛṭ*. Once again, the details of your sensitivity analysis are missing from your response. I am interested in knowing how you went from an initial range of 4,000–3,000 BCE to a post-sensitivity-analysis range of 5,000–2,000 BCE. If you could please share the precise math of his analysis, please do. Being fairly well-versed in Simplex Method, Statistics, Optimization, etc. I have used sensitivity analysis many a time myself, hence my interest in your precise technique and approach.

In spite of all that you say, you still have not given any answer to the two lists of seasons and season-month mappings. In any way, rather than speaking in riddles, why do you not list all the plausible implications yourself and show how that explains confusion of all commentators (a tall claim) and make people fall from chairs (another tall claim).

Actually, not. As I gather from your presentation, your claim is **solely** based your date of 5561 BCE for theMahābhārata war. You yourself say Garuḍa Purāṇa is not dated in your presentation. You yourself claim a date for Suśruta-Saṃhitā whic his much later than your date for Mahābhāratain your presentation. So why do you even need Garuḍa Purāṇa or Suśruta-Saṃhitā to **date** (as opposed to confirming/establishing the genealogy of) Suśruta? In the presentation, the **only date** you use to date Suśruta to much earlier than 5561 BCE is **your own date** of the Mahābhārata war.

  

How about some of your favourite sensitivity analysis here? Let us ask a question: What would be your date for Suśruta if you did not use the information from Garuḍa Purāṇa or Suśruta-Saṃhitā that you did? Would it be any different from your current date of much earlier than 5561 BCE? If so, how and why? If not, then you actually do not need the other two texts for your date for Suśruta.

Dr. Roy says something about*luni-solar months* and you contradict him saying something does not apply to*solar months*. I do not think Dr. Roy means the solar months when he says *luni-solar months*. Several publications and books refer to months of Hindu calendar as luni-solar months. Anyway, I will leave it to him to clarify what he meant by the term*luni-solar months*.

This above sentence, Nilesh Ji, speaks more about you than about Dr. Roy in my opinion.

  

Thanks, Nityānanda
