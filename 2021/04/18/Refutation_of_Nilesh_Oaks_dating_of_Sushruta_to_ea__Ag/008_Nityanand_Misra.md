Dear Nilesh Ji

  

Is there an issue with the title of the article (I am not sure why you wrote it six times in your email)? If so, then we may just ignore the title. The title or any part of it is not ascribed to you. Anyway, the title is the prerogative of the author.

  

As I see there are two different issues

  

1\) Dating of Sushruta-Samhita (SS): In your talk, you firstdate the SS between 4,000 BCE and 3,000 BCE based on SS 1.6.10 and using the logic that lunar months shift by one with respect to seasons every 2,00 years. A slide in your talk then shows the range as 5,000 BCE to 2,000 BCE (which apparently is due to some *sensitivity analysis*whose details I did not find in the linked talks and articles). Dr. Roy argues that this date range of 4,000 BCE to 3,000 BCE for the Samhita cannot be reached if we use the same logic on the passage SS 1.6.6-7 which has a different list of seasons and season-month mapping. What if SS 1.6.10 was indeed a later interpolation as Tilak suggests (even you have proposed an update for SS around 2,000 BCE [here](https://nileshoak.wordpress.com/2016/09/19/ancient-indian-history-chronology/)). I think this objection by Dr. Roy need to be addressed. If you have addressed it somewhere, I would like to read it.

  

2\) Dating of Sushruta himself: You place Sushruta much before 5561 BCE (as you do in the talk) and Sushruta-Samhita to around 4,000 BCE (as you have done [here](https://nileshoak.wordpress.com/2016/09/19/ancient-indian-history-chronology/)). I think what Dr. Roy has assumed (I may be corrected here) that it was Sushruta indeed who composed the \[initial version of\] SS. Your dating of SS,MBh, and Sushruta himself implies a time gap of at least (in fact many more than) 1,500 years between Sushruta and SS. If we use SS 1.6.6-7 and arrive at a much later date for SS than 4,000 BCE, that would imply even a larger time gap between Sushruta and the text famous in his name. This does seem like an issue. Could you please address this?

  

Look forward to your specific responses.
