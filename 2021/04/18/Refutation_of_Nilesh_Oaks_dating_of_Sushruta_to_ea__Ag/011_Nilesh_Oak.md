Dear Nityananda Ji  
  
What you are doing is rhetoricalGIGO. I presume this term is consideredacceptable on this scholarly list (since no one objected to it last time it was stated by someone in response to my write-up, even though it was enumerated with clear and crisp logic).  
  
If you are convinced of RRMR work, good for you. You mentioned my name and since I respect your work I decided to respond. Otherwise, unless specifically asked by someone, I do not feel the need to respond to criticismof my work by the likes of RRMR or Jayasree Saranathan. They have their motivations and I consider it a good part of Manthan.  
  
Best wishes.  
  
Nilesh Oak
