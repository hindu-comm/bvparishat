A well-written article, Dr. Raja Ram Mohan Roy. It is cogent and convincing. While I have not had the time to check the Suśruta-Saṃhitā passages, the citation from Tilak’s work strongly supports your view.

  

Somewhat besides the point: I believe no scientific dating of a passage/text (or an event) can be done purely on astronomical grounds and that too based on select verses.Archaeological, climatological, linguistic factors, to speak of a few, are extremely important. When it comes to belief, we can believe anything. But when it comes to scientific dating, we have to keep in mind the language of Suśruta-Saṃhitā (Laukika and not Vedic) also.

  

Nevertheless, I would like to hear the views/counter-views of Pandit Kaul and Sh Oak on your article.
