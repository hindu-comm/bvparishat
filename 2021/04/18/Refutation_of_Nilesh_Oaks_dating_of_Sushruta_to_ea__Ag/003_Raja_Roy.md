Dear Nityanand ji,

  

Thanks for your comments. As you have rightly observed astronomical dating needs to be used in conjunction with other pieces of information. From my research, I have not found any astronomical observation in any Indian text that goes beyond 4th millennium BCE. The ones that supposedly go beyond that date are based on interpretation of words in the evidence, and are subjective. So I have the opinion that astronomical dating can be reconciled with archaeological, climatological, linguistic and other pieces of evidence. Thanks again for carefully reading my article.

  

Best regards,

Raja
