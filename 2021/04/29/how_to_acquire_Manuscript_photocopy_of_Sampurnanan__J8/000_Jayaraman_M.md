Namaste  

  

I require a manuscript photocopy from the Sampurnananda University Manuscript collection.  

  

I tried calling the phone number given on the university website. It says the phone number itself does not exist.  

  

In these Covid times, travel might not be possible. Can someone guide regarding the way in which photocopies can be acquired?  

  

Or have the university manuscripts been digitized, which is accessible from some online platform?  

  

regards

Jayaraman
