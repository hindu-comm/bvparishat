A growing number of Sanskrit texts are being made searchable on different platforms  

by enthusiastic/dedicated individuals/institutions. It would be desirable as a source of great help  

to students/researchers/scholars to have all pertinent information about these  

in a single repository as a sort of a database. A monthly updating could be good enough.  

  

If no such repository has as yet been developed, can Indic Academy try to do this?  

Tasks like this indeed require institutional coordination - and knowledgeable hands,  

particularly, of which there seems to be quite some shortage.
