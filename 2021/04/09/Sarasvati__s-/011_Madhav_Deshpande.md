Sarasvati

  

वाग्देवि तेऽक्षमालाकिरणाभाभासितानि सुमनांसि ।

विकसन्ति काव्यरचनारसनाकुशलानि लोकेऽस्मिन् ।।

  

O goddess of speech, Sarasvati, minds like beautiful flowers illuminated by the brilliance of the light emitted by your garland of precious beads bloom in this world with skills in composing and relishing poetry.
