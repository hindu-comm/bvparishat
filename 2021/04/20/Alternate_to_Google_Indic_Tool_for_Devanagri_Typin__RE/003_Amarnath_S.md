Namaste to all,

  

  Sometime back, I had written a web-based tool similar to Baraha, but not as perfect, for typing in some Indian languages. This is hosted on Github at

  

<https://amarnaths0005.github.io/Translitera/>

  

 This enables you to type in English, and transliterate to your desired language. As mentioned, it is far from perfect, but, I feel, is reasonably OK for most Devanagari words. Works on any browser, including Chrome, Edge, Safari, etc. I hope and believe that this is intuitive to use, and does not need much help. This is open source, and the source is at<https://github.com/amarnaths0005/Translitera> (You are free to fork the code and modify the source code)

  

  Please try to use this, and give me your suggestions. Standard disclaimer - no legal liabilities on me by the users of this tool.

  

Thanks and Regards

\- amar
