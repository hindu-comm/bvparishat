Respected Scholars,

  

For typing Sanskrit, I used to have google indic tool on my laptop. Since it is discontinued by Google, I need your help on a good alternative. I did not like the onlyChrome-based solution.

  

I want a universal keyboard on my laptop so I can type it in Word or browser.

  

Also it should be like Google indic, where I type in english and it gives the Sanskrit

one. Why asking this because the Microsoftkeyboards are not like that.

  

Thanks in advance.

  

Regards,

Vikram
