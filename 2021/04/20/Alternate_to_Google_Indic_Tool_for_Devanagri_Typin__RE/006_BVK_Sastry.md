Namaste



**Reg. A Indian Language Native Keyboard for 11 different scripts of India** which

- (a) works directly with standard office suites like Word, Power point, Excel, E-mail, including Note pad. Works well with regular browsers. Is easy to edit multilingual text, including HTML.

- (b) generates direct Unicode input to the applications without need for ‘Google Transliteration/ Copy-Paste’

- (c) Does not need a finger-memory mapping of Brahmi Svara-Vyanjana to QWERTY layout.

You may explore the hardware product ‘ Ka-Naada’ - USB plugged \[ Details at [www.ka-naada.com](http://www.ka-naada.com) \] . Needs a simple driver installation for Windows. For Linux/ Mac, ask for support.

The product works with Android phones, Tabs and desktops also.



As a hardware option, the advantage is it does not need periodic upgrades associated with licensing and cost factors.



The is LANGUAGE-USERS Keyboard at its present state. Our Team is working to elevate this keyboard to the level of a ‘ PROGRAMMERS KEYBOARD’ to develop ‘ Samskruth: A Programming Language’.

The Brahmi-phonetic typing transliteration to Russian or other language script is a layout design and driver issue.



**Usage Method**: The typing is done by Brahmi Language Logic of Svara-Vyanjana sequenced joining without recourse to ‘spelling / proximate spelling / overlay approach of key mapping.

The beginning learners of Indic language digital typing have found the product easy and fast for direct use in doing school home work. The finger-memory mapping was easy for them.

For the Seasoned QWERTY / Overlay approach users , the finger- memory retraining may need about 30 minutes practice time to recall the native natural varna- samyoga approach in forming the

likhita-akshara tamkanam. **Different Keyboards for Roman script and Non-Roman Script works good**.



Our current usage for this hardware is in ‘ Digital Samskruth
Teaching ( and other Indian Languages (without clutter of English)/ On-line and off line , School Texts and teaching content preparation,

Teacher training for Online Language- classes, Manuscript Editing and proofing for Publication, HTML page editing and Proof reading.



Some publication software’s ( used by many Indian Desktop publishers) need upgrade to port Unicode data and accommodate another keyboard for text editing. 

This is not a constraint, as standard Office suites ( Proprietary or Open source provide basic editing tools for first level draft preparation with all needed formatting).





**Here below is a sample of direct typing from Ka-Naada hardware keyboard in several scripts in this E-mail**, with an easy switch option to English /QWERTY layout.

लक्ष्मी- લક્ષ્મી-লক্ষ্মী-లక్ష్మమీ- Lakshmi -ਲਕ੍ੲਮੀ-ଲକ୍ଷ୍ମୀ-ലക്ഷ്മീ-ಲಕ್ಷ್ಮೀ-

The keystroke sequence is same for all Indian languages following Svara-Vanjana sequence logic. Display script changes by language selection from keyboard option or Tray-icon. 

Works with all Unicode compliant fonts . \[ I have tried with Tunga, Adishila and many others. The application works in NOTE PAD ( primary editor) also without need for ‘Font-selection’. Most useful for ‘Copy-Paste operation’. The OS used by me is Win-10. Works in Word- right down to -XP version. \[ some tweaking needed to set the drivers\].
