Namaste.

I use my own keyboard layout for 11 different scripts (9 Indic and English, Russian). But it is cut and paste type editor which allows to type only in text mode in any script out of eleven.

Formatting is to be done after copying the typed materials in MS Word.

You can make your own keyboard layout for any script (read as an input file by the editor). At present I have selected semi-phonetic type keys for Indic scripts and also for Russian.

Regards

Narayan Prasad
