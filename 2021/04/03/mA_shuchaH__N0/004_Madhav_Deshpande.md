Dear Nityanand Ji,

  

  The form *aśucat* occurs in the R̥gveda \[7.9.4\]:ई॒ळेन्यो॑ वो॒ मनु॑षो यु॒गेषु॑ समन॒गा अ॑शुचज्जा॒तवे॑दाः। सु॒सं॒दृशा॑ भा॒नुना॒ यो वि॒भाति॒ प्रति॒ गावः॑ समिधा॒नं बु॑धन्त ॥४॥. However, it is used in the sense of shining, and not in the sense of grieving. It appears that in the larger spectrum of Sanskrit usage in the epics and Puranas, this type of form was also used in the sense of grieving, as is seen from the wide usage of मा शुच:. The Sundarakāṇḍa of Rāmāyaṇa also has the usage *mā śuca*. This could be a textual variantfor *mā śucaḥ*.

The usage *mā śuca* is also attested in the Agnipurana:

These may be *apāṇinīya* from the traditional perspective, but in the totality of attested Sanskrit usage, they seem to be normal.
