Prof. Madhav Deshpande just posted on Indology list :

  

 Dear Dominik,

  

  I entirely agree with you. In some quarters there is a tendency to consider everything "western" to be a Pūrvapakṣa, with an implication that a Siddhānta can come only from what can be labeled "Indian." This "Indian" does not include "westernized Indian" but often includes "Indianized westerners." Such labels already distance a reader from the content of a given argument, and they have to first take sides based on the labels attached to arguments. Such is the sociopolitical reality of academics.

  

This was part of a thread initiated by Prof. Pandurangi with his post enquiring on Rigveda reverse word index that he shared on this list too.

  

In course of that thread, Prof. Pandurangi posted the following :

  

Thanks.

It is good they are moving ahead with this commentary, which was available partly few years ago.

  

Still many mantras are left out for being too clear? for example 1.2.4-6 are left.

I hope they will cover whole rgveda.  

  

This will help us to understand the western perspective which I want to note in my new commentary on first mandala.

  

Any other suggestions?

  

To this Prof. Dominik Wujastyk responded as follows :

  

Is there such a thing as a western perspective on the RV? What might be the demarcation criteria for such a taxonomy? And if such a category could be delineated, would it be desirable or fruitful to do so? In my view, the category "western" or "the West" is best avoided because it is so deeply flawed, conceptually, that whatever you say it is, there are ten counter-examples. The most obvious of which being that Japan, where much Vedic research is conducted, is east of India.  

  

I prefer to proceed on the basis that all serious scholars are united in their pursuit of truth, wherever their desks may happen to be located.  

  

Prof. Madhav Deshpande's just posted response comes in response to this post by Prof. Wujastyk.
