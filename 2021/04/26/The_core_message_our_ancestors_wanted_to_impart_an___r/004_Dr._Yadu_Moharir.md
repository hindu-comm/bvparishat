Thank you BVK for sharing your thoughts.

  

Simply speaking, if "***YOU***" do not know the "***USE***" of something then "***IT***" (text, object or a Tool) becomes useless as far as you are concerned. I would certainly stand corrected if anyone can disprove this statement.  

  

Rgds,

Subject: Re: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} The core message our ancestors wanted to  
impart and for us to assimilate -from- Re: Refutation of 12209 BCE Dating of  
Ramayana  
  
  
  

Your core question as I understand it , is what is the need for dating of  
Ramayana and Mahabharata ?  
  

^^^^^^^^^^^^  
  
BVK Sastry ( 1 ) : The core of the question is about the Utility  
-Application ( सनातन-उपयोग- विनियोग ) independent of the antiquity (  
पुरातन ) - Social ground reality (ऐतिहासिक ).  
  
  
  
--------------------------------------  
  
  
  
  
  

Today there are many who are discussing whether these are Mythology or  
Itihaas.  
  

^^^^^^^^^^^^  
  
BVK Sastry (2 ) : What is missing is the traditional natural position  
which is ‘वेद-मूलता ‘ ; This loss is made further worse by the forced  
imposition of western religion-theology- history- model for
language-  
text- time –scale and imposition of inversed construction of ‘ Human  
evolution’ shoved in as ‘ Science of evolution’. The amusing part is ‘  
Science of Consciousness’ is being investigated by the same western teams  
using the ‘ Indian resources’ which are subject to ‘ different academic  
construction’ !  
  
  
  
--------------------------------------  
  
  
  
  
  

We know it is history and dating goes a long way towards proving it to be  
so.  
  

^^^^^^^^^^^^  
  
BVK Sastry ( 3 ) : Proving History is demonstrating land – archaeology  
evidence. Proving Utility-Application benefit is Technology of Tradition  
for human welfare.  
  
Each is independent. ‘How water can be turned to wine’ is answered in two  
ways, using different logic and text construction : By faith teams , By  
Science Teams.  
  
  
  
Jesus turned water into wine to prove that He's the source of life.  
Changing the water to wine offered a symbol of the new spiritual life Jesus  
brings from the old mortal in conversion. As Paul said in 2 Corinthians  
5:17, "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has  
gone, the new has come!" -  
<https://www.allaboutjesuschrist.org/water-to-wine-faq.htm#> - Water to Wine  
([allaboutjesuschrist.org](http://allaboutjesuschrist.org))  
\<<https://www.allaboutjesuschrist.org/water-to-wine-faq.htm>\>  
  
  
  
--------------------------------------  
  
  
  
  
  

Many of the descriptions in these epics border on unbelievable, but when we  
are able to date these , the unbelievable also has to be accepted as being  
fact. That fact from there onwards can be investigated further. This study  
would bring in many many breakthroughs in science , technology , study of  
space , and so on.  
  

^^^^^^^^^^^^  
  
BVK Sastry ( 4 ) : History will not resolve ‘ Mystery of Divine’.  
  
  
  
--------------------------------------  
  
  
  
  
  

Some people say that Valmiki had fertile imagination and created all these  
celestial descriptions through his imagination. There are so many celestial  
events and occurrences exactly described that these cannot come through  
imagination alone , but out of observation or out of detail calculation. If  
it is coming out of calculation , you have to accept that our ancestors had  
recourse to such advanced calculation and methods in those times and that  
can be researched further.  
  

^^^^^^^^^^^^  
  
BVK Sastry (5 ) : Why ‘have to accept’ - ??  
  
  
  
--------------------------------------  
  
  
  
  
  

Thus dating proves to be the milestone in Indic research and unveiling of  
ancient wisdom.  
  

^^^^^^^^^^^^  
  
BVK Sastry ( 6 ) : Academic research may help in unravelling the ancient  
wisdom; but it will not help to translate it to ‘deliverable utility  
–applications’ by the simple claim of antiquity. Ancient wisdom is not a  
‘Collectors items’ for trade-bids.

Please post your responses here to the post from Dr Yadu Moharir:  
  
  
  
Dear List:  
  
  
  
Can some one help me understand the significance of trying to Date:  
"RaamaayaNa / Mahaabhaarata / Shushruta Samhitaa ....... Etc."  
  

^^^^^^^^^^^^  
  
BVK Sastry ( 7 ) : ‘trying to’- helps them to engage with the text.
No  
assurance on understanding the value of the same.  
  
  
  
--------------------------------------  
  
  
  
  
  

IMHO: How old the text is not important but the core message our ancestors  
wanted to impart and for us to assimilate !?  
  

^^^^^^^^^^^^  
  
BVK Sastry ( 8 ) : Why did the ancestors wrap the ‘Veda-ancient wisdom’  
in the garb of a story and social narrative (काव्य-कथा-इतिवृत्त  ) and  
tagged it to faith and philosophy leading to mysticism ?  
  
The entire packaging and delivery technique is unique to Indian tradition  
as ‘शास्त्र  ‘; west called this as ‘Mythology(जनपद-उदन्त) ’.  
  
  
  
--------------------------------------  
  
  
  
  
  

What instruments Shrushruta invented, why & how he refined them; How did he  
evaluate his students, what was his criteria for that evaluation; How was it  
beneficial to society at large !?  
  

^^^^^^^^^^^^  
  
BVK Sastry (9 ) : like new technologies that get invented, new diseases  
also haunt the community. The investigation model is universal; the measure-  
implementation models are customization.  
  
  
  
--------------------------------------  
  
  
  
  
  

How does it really matter when it (events) happened or got documented, the  
critical issue should be to try and understand the "Take Home Message" from  
those events ? That got classified as veda or upa-veda ...... etc. !?  
  
  
  
In what way does the academic research help preserve the core essence  
(puruShaa) from ancient wisdom based on their observations, except for  
bragging rights, as feather in the cap to stake a claim that entitles them  
that they are doing important research in a scientific manner.  
  

^^^^^^^^^^^^  
  
BVK Sastry ( 10 ) : There is a beautiful technical traditional word for  
this concept: फल-श्रुति.  
  
  
  
--------------------------------------  
  
  
  
  
  

Thank everyone in advance for sharing their opinion and thoughts.

Having said this, it is extremely important for me because I am in the  
process of creating an for Endowment for samskR^ita studies.  
  

^^^^^^^^^^^^  
  
BVK Sastry ( 11 ) : Good initiative to think on ‘ Viniyoga- Upayoga’ of  
‘Artha’.
