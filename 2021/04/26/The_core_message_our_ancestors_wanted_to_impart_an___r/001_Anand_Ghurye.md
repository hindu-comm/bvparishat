Your core question as I understand it , is what is the need for dating of Ramayana and Mahabharata ?

  

Today there are many who are discussing whether these are Mythology or Itihaas.

  

We know it is history and dating goes a long way towards proving it to be so.

  

Many of the descriptions in these epics border on unbelievable, but when we are able to date these , the unbelievable also has to be accepted as being fact. That fact from there onwards can be investigated further. This study would bring in many many breakthroughs in science , technology , study of space , and so on.

  

Some people say that Valmiki had fertile imagination and created all these celestial descriptions through his imagination. There are so many celestial events and occurrences exactly described that these cannot come through imagination alone , but out of observation or out of detail calculation. If it is coming out of calculation , you have to accept that our ancestors had recourse to such advanced calculation and methods in those times and that can be researched further.

  

Thus dating proves to be the milestone in Indic research and unveiling of ancient wisdom.

  

Fair Winds ,
