Please post your responses here to the post from Dr Yadu Moharir:

  

Dear List:

  

Can some one help me understand the significance of trying to Date:*"RaamaayaNa / Mahaabhaarata / Shushruta Samhitaa ....... Etc."*

  

IMHO: How old the text is not important but the core message our ancestors wanted to impart and for us to assimilate !?

  

What instruments Shrushruta invented, why & how he refined them; How did he evaluate his students, what was his criteria for that evaluation; How was it beneficial to society at large !?  

  

How does it really matter when it (events) happened or got documented, the critical issue should be to try and understand the "Take Home Message" from those events ? That got classified as veda or upa-veda ...... etc. !?  

  

In what way does the academic research help preserve the core essence (puruShaa) from ancient wisdom based on their observations, except for bragging rights, as feather in the cap to stake a claim that entitles them that they are doing important research in a scientific manner.  

  

Thank everyone in advance for sharing their opinion and thoughts.

  

Please feel free to share your comments privately rather than the public forum.

  

Having said this, it is extremely important for me because I am in the process of creating an for Endowment for samskR^ita studies.  

  

Rgds
