Namaste  
  
  
  
When times change- technologies change , teaching instructions and  
pedagogies also change.  
  
  
  
In 2021, the goals are still the same for ‘ Vidyaa’ which needs to lead to  
‘ Artha’ \[ multiply translated as ‘ money, wealth, purpose, means of skills  
for good living….\].  
  
  
  
The seniors of 1894- 1911 were seriously concerned over the ‘Contextual  
measures’ to arrest the ‘decline in standards of traditional education’;  
their challenge was finding a suitable ‘ uttaradhikaari/ a successor’. ;  
  
  
  
Social ‘ livelihood profession learning- models were not their main focus !  
Not then ! Not even now !!  
  
  
  
When ‘Gurukul-graduate (snaataka/ smashrayana/ sudha-mangala …… call  
whatever name is there in tradition) is not qualifying the person to be  
secularly employed in a ‘State-System of Jobs and professional services’  
beyond the ‘Faith centric activities’, the immediate need becomes the best  
use of acquired education to earn-lead a respectable life ( responsibility  
goes to back burner).  
  
  
  
This ‘Guru-Kul’ population is less than 1% of the ‘ National Population;  
and they carry the burden of 99% treasure-resource access to Heritage  
traditions- languages’. So what kind of a ‘ Educational Institution and  
Pedagogy’ would one need for making traditional knowledge transfer -  
efficiently, distortion free, socially and spiritually useful – is the  
focus. The role of Technology and cost of access brings in additional  
challenges.  
  
  
  
May I seek the forward looking guidance in 2021 which would meet the  
approval of Acharyas as well as Education- Entrepreneurs ? Which in other  
words is seeking guidance on worth of ‘Education-Tradition- Investments on  
Heritage related ’ : One end is Market and another end is Moksha. Pedagogy  
is a fall out on this choice.  
  
  
  
If it ends up as ‘ One guru’, it becomes Guru-Kul. If the numbers become  
thousands, it becomes a ‘ University’ (?) .  
  
  
  
Many seniors who deliberated deeply on this issue and advised, coolly  
passed on the ‘ responsibility to one above, taking a siesta, on the great  
serpent of TIME’ ; and said social reformation is NOT their call ! Personal  
Moksha is their single point agenda.  
  
  
  
All this has left me wondering on what is the call of ‘ Loka samgraham’ in  
Gita, resonating in ‘Sarve bhavantu sukhinah……’.
