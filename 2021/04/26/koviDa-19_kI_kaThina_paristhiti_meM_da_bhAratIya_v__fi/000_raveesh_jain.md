What to do to keep yourself and others safe from COVID-19

-   **Maintain at least a 1-metre distance between yourself and
    others**to reduce your risk of infection when they cough, sneeze or
    speak. Maintain an even greater distance between yourself and others
    when indoors. The further away, the better. -   **Make wearing a mask a normal part of being around other
    people.The appropriate use, storage and cleaning or disposal are
    essential to make masks as effective as possible.**

Here are the basics of[how to wear a mask](https://youtu.be/ciUniZGD4tY):

-   Clean your hands before you put your mask on, as well as before and
    after you take it off, and after you touch it at any time. -   Make sure it covers both your nose, mouth and chin. -   When you take off a mask, store it in a clean plastic bag, and every
    day either wash it if it’s a fabric mask, or dispose of a medical
    mask in a trash bin. -   Don’t use masks with valves.

  

  

-   *For specific advice for decision makers, see[WHO’s technical
    guidance](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak).*

  



How to make your environment safer

**Avoid the 3Cs: spaces that areclosed,crowded or involveclose contact.**

-   Outbreaks have been reported in restaurants, choir practices,
    fitness classes, nightclubs, offices and places of worship where
    people have gathered, often in crowded indoor settings where they
    talk loudly, shout, breathe heavily or sing. -   The risks of getting COVID-19 are higher in crowded and inadequately
    ventilated spaces where infected people spend long periods of time
    together in close proximity. These environments are where the virus
    appears to spread by respiratory droplets or aerosols more
    efficiently, so taking precautions is even more important.

**Meet people outside.**Outdoor gatherings are safer than indoor ones, particularly if indoor spaces are small and without outdoor air coming in.

-   *For more information on how to hold events like family gatherings,
    children’s football games and family occasions, read our*[*Q&A on
    small public
    gatherings*](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-small-public-gatherings-and-covid-19)*.*

**Avoid crowded or indoor settings**but if you can’t, then take precautions:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

-   **Open a window.***Increase the amount of*‘natural ventilation’
    when indoors. -   *WHO has published Q&As on ventilation and air conditioningfor both
    the*[*general
    public*](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-ventilation-and-air-conditioning-and-covid-19)*and*[*people
    who manage public spaces and
    buildings*](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-ventilation-and-air-conditioning-in-public-spaces-and-buildings-and-covid-19)*.* -   **Wear a mask**(see above for more details).



Don’t forget the basics of good hygiene

-   **Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based
    hand rub or wash them with soap and water.**This eliminates germs
    including viruses that may be on your hands. -   **Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.**Hands touch many
    surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can
    transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the
    virus can enter your body and infect you. -   **Cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you
    cough or sneeze**. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately into
    a closed bin and wash your hands. By following good ‘respiratory
    hygiene’, you protect the people around you from viruses, which
    cause colds, flu and COVID-19**.** -   **Clean and disinfect surfaces frequently especially those which are
    regularly touched,**such as****door handles, faucets and phone
    screens.



What to do if you feel unwell

-   **Know the full range of symptoms of COVID-19.**The most common
    symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. Other
    symptoms that are less common and may affect some patients include
    loss of taste or smell, aches and pains, headache, sore throat,
    nasal congestion, red eyes, diarrhoea, or a skin rash. -   **Stay home and self-isolate even if you have minor symptoms such as
    cough, headache, mild fever**, until you recover. Call your health
    care provider or hotline for advice. Have someone bring you
    supplies. If you need to leave your house or have someone near you,
    wear a medical mask to avoid infecting others. -   **If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical
    attention immediately. Call by telephone first, if you can**and
    follow the directions of your local health authority. -   **Keep up to date on the latest information from trusted sources,
    such as WHO or your local and national health authorities.**Local
    and national authorities and public health units are best placed to
    advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect
    themselves. -
