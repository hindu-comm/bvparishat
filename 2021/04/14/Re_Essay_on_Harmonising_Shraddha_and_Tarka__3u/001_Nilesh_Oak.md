Dear Sreejit  
  
Enjoyed your article very much. I agree with much of the thesis and your POV. You have included, at least indirectly, the Jijnasa aspect in this discussion of Shraddha and Tarka, however, addingexplicitlymay give the special status it deserves.  
  
I discuss this subject via triangulation of Shraddha-Samshay-Jijnasa.

Question  
  
You suggest that effective synthesis of these is found during Epics (but not before?) If so, what specific texts or period you havein mind when you think it was not as evolved as it is in the epics?  
  
Thanks  
  
Warm regards  
Nilesh Oak
