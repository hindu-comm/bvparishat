Respected scholars ,  

 In both the telugu states of India there exists a habit of performing sitarama kalyana on the event of srirama navami.  

One of my friend who is a vedic scholar needs Sita Rama Kalyana Vidhi in devanagari script.  

I failed to locate the book.  

So please help me in locating the e.book.  

  

Thank you.
