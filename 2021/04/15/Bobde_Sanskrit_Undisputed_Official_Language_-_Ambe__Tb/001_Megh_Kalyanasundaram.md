In addition to the point about Dr. Ambedkar and Sanskrit, the article also includes a point about jurisprudence.

  

*Eurocentrism and more in the 21st century: the case of 'Suum cuique tribuere (Ancient Rome, c.1000 BC–AD 565)' and 'A New History of Dharmaśāstra'*

***Abstract***:Was Roman law without doubt the most sophisticated legal system from Antiquity? Do the roots of vyavahārapadas lie outside the dharma tradition? Is it the case that the earliest explicitly legal use of the term vyavahāra was attested outside dharma literature? In this paper, statements found in two influential 21st century publications that appear to be answers in the affirmative to the above questions are foregrounded, critically analyzed and responded to. Thereafter, some aspects of three elements of Roman law are compared with their chronological peers (or predecessors) from a system of knowledge indigenous to the Indian subcontinent: the भारतीय अष्टादशविद्या (Bhāratīya Aṣṭādaśavidyā). In doing the above, and in the interest of a more inclusive global history (or histories) of law and jurisprudence, the ethical need for more open, comprehensive, rigorous yet sensitive engagement, sans eurocentrism (and more), is stressed, particularly when radical changes to any aspect of chronology of non-European, non-Mediterranean, non-Abrahamic traditions are posited.

***Abstract***: This paper presents an empirical case for inclusions of evidence from Indian Knowledge Systems into those history narratives of constitutional law that aspire to be inclusively global in their academic concern for, amongst other legal concepts, the early history of Separation of Powers. The aforementioned foregrounding of evidence is undertaken alongside a reading of (and in response to aspects of) '*The Crown and the Courts : Separation of Powers in the Early Jewish Imagination*' published recently by Harvard University Press in 2020 and '*The First Constitution: Rethinking the Origins of Rule of Law and Separation of Powers in Light of Deuteronomy*' published in 2006.
