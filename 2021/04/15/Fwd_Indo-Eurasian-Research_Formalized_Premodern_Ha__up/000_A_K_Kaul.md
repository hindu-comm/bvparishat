Hello Steve,

  

In Frits Staal's 'Agni' -- there is a nice discussion on Rg Vedic 'mudras' (hand gestures) used by the ritualists in Kerala. Volume 2, page 359 with elaborate photos. He attributed the discussion in Agni to a translated (from Malayalam) article written in 1967 by Paramesvara Bhaaratikal.

  

The Namboodiris of the Kerala in the Agnicayana rituals use Rg Vedic mudras ("which represent sound") as opposed to Sama Veda mudras ("which represent meaning"). The Rg Vedic mudras represent the "ends of words" in order to help the reciter disambiguate phrases. This is particularly useful for young children who memorize word for word and may not know where 'sandhis' occur.

  

A nice audio-photo montage of a Veda pathashala in Thrissur district in Kerala where we can see these mudras: <https://vimeo.com/40614647>

  

And Staal writes:

"The first scholar who studied Rgvedic mudras of Nambudiris was Arnold Blake." with a reference to Brough, J. (1964) "Obituary: Arnold Adriaan Bake." Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, 27: 246-264.

  

The Samaveda mudras are documented in Wayne Howard's 'Samavedic Chant' (1977), Yale University Press.

  

Perhaps this might be of interest to some of you,

  

Keerthik
