Dear Scholars,  
As part of IIT Gandhinagarâ€™s History of Mathematicsin India (HoMI) project, we are glad to announce a Young Scholars' Conference this Saturday 17th and Sunday 18th (forenoon only on both days). The schedule is attached.

In India, as you know, history of science has almost no institutional base and support; hence our wish to encourage young scholars by offering them a platform.

Our eight speakers will deal with a variety of topics related to the history of mathematics and allied fields (such as astronomy). Do encourage them by attending some of their presentations and taking part in the discussions.

To join the Zoom meeting:

Best regards,

Michel
