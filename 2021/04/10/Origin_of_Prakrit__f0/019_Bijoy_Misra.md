Friends,

My scientific view has been that the early language is object-based and syllable-based. Objects existed before the language. Object variations

and relationships are achieved by variations in accent and tone along with the addition of suffixes. Vocabulary is limited. I wish to classify this  

class of languages as Prakrit (natural) in the modern terminology. This is a neurological view. Grammarian S'akaṭāyana (sphoṭa theory) carries

this view before Panini. The nouns get used as verbs with suffixes.
The object name defines its existence. There is no भू concept. It is a static  

object space. Jains maintain such a cosmology. Apparently S'akaṭāyana had created a grammar, but not seen yet.  

The situation changes when we add transformation of objects and add concepts of evolution. This necessitates verbs and action definitions.  

Parts of Rgveda (i have come upto sukta 49 first Mandala) are object dominated but the 9th and tenth Mandala seem as action-dominated.

While sphoṭa is purely based on individual units of speech (syllables), new words get created which need not be existing objects. Thoughts  

like time can come in and morphology of words can develop. This is where Panini comes in and creates the structural grammar. We call it Sanskrit

following Vālmīki. देवभाषा and मनुष्यभाषा can be alluded.  

This is a broad reconstruction in my mind. I continue to look into various parts of it and create a quantitative model. Don't wait for me.
We are slow.  

Thank you for raising the issues and continued discussion.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
