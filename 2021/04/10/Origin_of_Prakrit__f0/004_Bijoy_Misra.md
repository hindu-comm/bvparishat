Dear Dr Nori,

What we are observing is that the brain always economizes. Most of the context goes into accent and tone and not in the letter.

The original primitive language may only have a limited set of nouns evolved through the properties. The brain cognizes objects.

The verbs came from the nouns. So in our view, the process has been more of evolution from the primitives in time.

As you can observe, the same concept is expressed in lss words orally than written. A single word in Sanskrit can take

half a page in English. It has to do with the acoustic response of the brain to speech.

We are still studying. It is complex.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
