Dear Sri Ramakrishnan Suryanarayanan,

  

1\. To base totally on what is reflected in texts for knowing what existed during the time of that text is a methodological flaw that can be called 'textualism'. It has a component of denying the existence of anything that is not reflected in the text.

  

2\. We could be talking of two different things while we may think that we are talking of the same thing.

  

3\. "Standard" in words like "Standard Language" , "Standard Dialect " terms used in Linguistics , do not have a value connotation. Regional and social spoken variations of a given language are called its dialects and as such regional and social variegatedness and faster pace of change with time (pravaahineedesyaa) are the features of dialects. In societies where people have a life needing communication across the regions and social groups that use dialects, a form/dialect of that language that serves the purpose of that cross-regional and cross-communal communication evolves. This form / dialect is given the name 'standard language' or 'standard dialect' , without any value connotation. As such , this form has low to no variegatedness across regions and communities of the language area/people and slow to no change with time.

  

The word 'standard' here does not even imply that it is a form chosen as a yard / measuring rod to study the variations in the other spoken forms.

  

4\. Standardization like many processes of language (like culture and other human social phenomena) happen naturally without the effort of an individual or organized body and can also be effected by the effort of an individual or organized body to an extent. Resources like grammars and dictionaries may participate in this process of standardization, give a direction to it, but are not essential for the process of evolution and sustenance of a standard form. The only driving force and essential agency for the evolution and sustenance of a standard form of language is a life needing communication across the regions and social groups that use dialects.

  

5\. Dialects do exist for any language spoken by people with social variations and spread beyond a geographical area of a certain size. Languages that are localized to an extremely small area and without social variations in the speaking community can theoretically be understood to be not having dialects.

  

6\. If you agree that Samskrutham /Sanskrit also had a similar spoken reality and had related regional and social dialects but you contend that those dialects need not or should not be called Prakrutam /Prakrit, the name Prakrutam /Prakritshould be reserved to a certain form of language or a certain language only , that is fine. But if your point is that Samskrutham /Sanskrit did not have a spoken reality of having related regional and social dialects, then that is what I say is unrealistic. That is why I said that there does exist a view that the
dialects related to Samskrutam/Sanskrit need not or should not be called Prakrutam /Prakrit, the name Prakrutam /Prakritshould be reserved to a certain form of language or a certain language only. I said that there also exists a view that the Sanskrit-related regional and social dialects should be called as Prakrutam(s) /Prakrit(s). Unless you make it clear whether you agree that Samskrutham /Sanskrit had a spoken reality of having related regional and social dialects, there is a chance of you being misunderstood and we going round and round around the same point. If your point is that the name Prakrutam /Prakritshould be reserved to a certain form of language or a certain language only and you are saying that language 'originated' at a certain period of history, that is a different arguable and debatable point.

  

7\. But if you do not agree that Samskrutham /Sanskrit also had a similar spoken reality and had related regional and social dialects, and you base yourself on the nonavailability of such a description of
Samskrutham /Sanskrit having a spoken reality of having related regional and social dialects, then that argument of you has a methodological flaw that can be called textualism.

  

8\. For some, not you, Samskrutham /Sanskrit was never a spoken language, hence can not have related regional and social dialects. It was a language artificially created for liturgical purposes. Prakrutham/ Prakrit is a language artificially created for writing Sanskrit 'dramas'. Those like me who believe that Samskrutam/Sanskrit was and continues in some sections of society to be a spoken language and that the two forms of language used in Sanskrit plays reflects the reality of Samskrutham /Sanskrit having a spoken reality of having related regional and social dialects , disagree with such people.
