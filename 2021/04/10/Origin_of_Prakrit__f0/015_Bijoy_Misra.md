Another well-thought out post by Prof Paturi..

  

Dear Sri Suryanarayana,

I don't know your training and past research. You have the right intention, but you have to

pose the problem in an analytic way from the first principles. Please look from the ground up

than top down. The latter has unfortunately been the approach by the modern researchers,

the claim being nothing is known. Nothing is known through the available written text, but  

that does not limit people's life and living. Please try to go for fieldwork in the interior of the  

country and hear the verbal sounds.. If you have time, a good study of वाक्यपदीय would be  

beneficial.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
