1\. The perspective of looking at Prakrit as the name of a language or as a name for a group of languages with several different names is different from the perspective of looking at Prakrit as the name for the dialect or dialects spoken by the common public. From the second perspective, the relation between Sanskrit and Prakrit can be viewed as the relation between Standard Language/StadanrdDialect and (the other spoken) dialects.

  

2\. From the second perspective, to imagine a stage/period of history when only the Standard Language/StadanrdDialect existed without (the other spoken) dialects is unrealistic. Since Prakrit is the name given to these ( other spoken) dialects, to imagine a stage/period of history when only Sanskrit existed without Prakrit(s) is unrealistic.

  

3\. From the perspective that the language of the Vedas is the language that was spoken by the composers (spoken by those who considered themselves or considered by others to be impersonal media) of Vedas , to imagine that the language of the Vedas had no other spoken dialects is unrealistic. If the language of the Vedas is considered to have a historical continuity of evolutionary relationship with Sanskrit, i.e., just as an older form of Sanskrit, the other spoken forms that existed alongside the language spoken by the composers (spoken by those who considered themselves or considered by others to be impersonal media) of Vedas can be called older forms of Prakrit(s).

  

4\. Documentation of the name of a language is different from the documentation of that language. In general, it is very much possible that the documentation of the name of a language occurs at a later stage than the documentation of that language.

  

5\. Number of written languages is miniscule compared to the number of languages that exist(ed) in a spoken form without being written. To deny the existence of a language that is not written is against common sense. Existence of languages / dialects that are not written can be inferred based on the existence of their other dialects or their older and later forms, evidence for the existence of a group of human beings etc. To imagine that a group of human beings for whose existence evidence exists did not have a language/dialect is unrealistic.

  

6\. Most major languages of the world have a very very longpre-historic (before written documentation) history and that history is what is studied through the rigorous methods of historical linguistics like comparative and reconstruction methods. Most such reconstructed languages /dialects do not have their names mentioned anywhere.
