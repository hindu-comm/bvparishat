Dear Dr. Paturi,

  
  

Thanks for sharing your thoughts.  
  
You're right that there is currently an alternative view of Prakrit (which defines Prakrit as being various Spoken dialects that diverge from Standard Sanskrit, and Sanskrit as being ipso-facto an unvarying standard to measure the extent of that variance of the spoken dialects) but this is a modern Western view, and it is both simplistic & incorrect in many ways as I shall point out below.  
  
The old-Indic dialects in the time of Patañjali were of 4 types (as per the Mahābhāṣya):

1.  The Old-Indic dialects directly attested in the Vedic texts. 2.  The Standardized Classical Sanskrit that fits the rules laid down in
    the Aṣṭādhyāyī (used by some Śiṣṭas even though they had not learnt
    the Aṣṭādhyāyī themselves). 3.  The language spoken by Śiṣṭas (kaśyāś-cid-vidyāyāḥ pāragāḥ - living
    in the region of Āryāvarta and following the way of life generally
    prevalent in that region) that occasionally diverged from the rules
    of Pāṇini but was still considered valid Sanskrit (i.e. Ārṣa
    prayogas & Śiṣṭa-prayogas) which may have included surviving Vedic
    usages/archaisms (both attested and unattested in the Vedic corpus -
    but which usage was capable of being justified by a scholar/Śiṣṭa). 4.  The vernacular Sanskrit dialects spoken by both Śiṣṭas & commoners
    that was practically identical with the language of the Śiṣṭas
    (point 3 above) except that this language also had some errors
    (apaśabdas) that differed from individual to individual. He gives
    five examples of such incorrect usages:

-   The case of yarvāṇas-tarvāṇaḥ is mentioned as the case of some Ṛṣis
    (individuals, not entire communities) who sometimes mispronounced
    some Sanskrit words (yad vā naḥ as yarvāṇas, and tad vā naḥ as
    tarvāṇaḥ) when speaking colloquially (*even though they knew and
    used correct pronunciation* during yājña-karmas). It appears that
    these mispronunciationswere so rare as to be noted and those śiṣṭas
    were apparently known thereafter by those nicknames (alluding to
    their mispronunciation) which means that this case was an exception
    rather than the rule. -   The case of a girl using the plural forms for her eyes and feet is
    also mentioned by him while commenting on A1.4.21 ("akṣīṇi me
    darśanīyāni , pādā me sukumārā iti") but this is mentioned as an
    example of her personal misunderstanding (or occasional incorrect
    grammatical usage, where the girl otherwise speaks correct language)
    and not as an example of widespread dialectal variation. -   The third case is mentioned of an individual brāhmaṇī woman who due
    to some personal incapacity pronounces ṛtakaḥ as ḷtakaḥ and a young
    girl (kumārī) in imitation of the brāhmaṇī's mispronunciation also
    says ḷtakaḥ. Here the case is not just personal ignorance of the
    kumārī but also imitating the iñcorrect usage of others as in the
    case of children imitating parents. Here too it is an individual's
    incorrect usage rather than dialects spoken by communities. -   He also mentions some artificially-invented-feminine-variants of the
    masculine word gauḥ - like gāvī, goṇi, gotā, gopotālikā which he
    gives as examples of apaśabdas - but does not consider them
    normative/dialectal usage.

So Patañjali makes no mention of any community's usage (or wholesale dialects) as being incorrect - all the examples he mentions of the incorrect usages are individual's errors (and are exceptional not normative) and incorrect on an occasional word-basis rather than whole dialects, except in one case:  

-   He suggests that one of the aims of studying the grammar is to
    ensure that Āryas do not become like mlecchas (foreigners), for it
    is the characteristic of the mlecchas to habitually mispronounce
    Sanskrit i.e. habitually use corrupt language (apaśabdas). He thus
    defines habitually speaking apaśabdas as the characteristic not of
    the natives of Āryāvarta, but principally of foreigners.He also
    mentions the case of the Asuras saying helayo helayaḥ ( te_asurā
    helayo helaya iti kurvantaḥ parābabhūvuḥ । tasmād brāhmaṇena na
    mlecchitavai na_apabhāṣitavai । mleccho ha vā eṣa yad apaśabdaḥ ।
    mlecchā mā bhūma_ity adhyeyaṃ vyākaraṇam ।)

Therefore those who habitually/normally/extensively mispronounce Sanskrit are Iranic (Asuric) speakers and foreigners, and these were explicitly recognized by him as āsuric foreigners,not the natives of Āryāvarta. The use of 'helayo helayaḥ' is originally from the śatapatha brāhmaṇam (where it is 'helavo helavaḥ' with a va instead of the ya in Mahābhāṣya, or 'hailo hailo' as in another rescension) which actually shows many characteristic sound shifts of prakrit as the ra>la; ya>va; the loss of the visarga etc.). Hence it is clear that those who speak prakritized language are Iranic people from the north-west India that was under Śakyan (Hakhā-manish or Achae-menid) rule for about 175 years until the start of the Mauryan empire. That is where prakrit sound shifts (and the right-to-left kharoṣṭhi script which was originally not suitable for orthographically depicting Old-Indic with full phonetical accuracy) originated from.  
  
Which ancient Sanskrit or Prākṛt grammarian has defined Old-Indic (Vedic or Pāṇinian-era bhāṣā) as being comprised of both Sanskrit and Prākṛt, or as Middle-Indic being similarly comprised of both Sanskrit and Prākṛt? It appears to be an ahistorical imagined notion that has only been prevalent among some modern scholars today. As far as most of the old Indian grammarians are concerned, Prākṛtam is called so as it is derived from its Prakṛtiḥ - which is Saṃskṛtam (i.e. all Old-Indic, not just the Pāṇinian-standard alone). Also the prākṛts are themselves treated by the grammarians as codified literary registers (i.e. artificial languages found only in specific types of literature) not the evolving natural spoken dialects of the common man.

In short - there may have been plenty of old-Indic spoken dialects (spoken variants of standard Sanskrit - as the existence of the Pāṇinian standard ipso facto means it was a standardization of pre-existing Spoken Sanskrit dialects) --- but those old-Indic dialects were part of a living Sanskrit language, prakrit was originally something entirely different. Prakrit(s) were originally foreign (Iranic, or Persianized-Sanskrit) dialects according to Patañjali which appeared similar to corrupted-sanskrit, and which due to Asuric (Zoroastrian/Buddhist) literary influence gradually grew in usage but could not entirely displace Sanskrit due to the efforts of the śiṣṭas. Therefore we should be looking at Prakrit in the same way as we look at Urdu today (i.e. Persianized Hindustani) as history seems to have repeated in this case.
