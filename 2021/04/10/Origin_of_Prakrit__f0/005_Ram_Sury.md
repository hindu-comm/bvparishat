Dear Dr. Miśra,  
  
Thanks for your comments. Please can you call me Mr., as I am not a Dr.  
  
The "distorted form of Sanskrit" is also the way early Sanskrit grammarians have principally viewed proto-Prākṛt - before that single proto-prākṛt register multiplied later into many named-prākṛts in the early centuries of the common era (Śauraseni, Māgadhī, Mahārāṣtrī etc).  
  
The original proto-prākṛt however (which was later on, in the common era, called Paiśāci - was originally called Pāścātya (western) - it got corrupted/prakritized into 'Pesacca' and reimported into Sanskrit as paiśācī) used to exist originally in NorthWestern India - today in Western academia it is known as Gāndharī. Thus the hypothesis that Prakrit arose first in Eastern India is not in sync with the hard evidence - Prākṛt was originally introduced from the North-West during the period of Achaemenid (Śākya) rule of Gandhāra from the 5th century BCE onwards. This is why grammarians like Patañjali associate the prākṛtisms with Asuric speech, and with mlecchas (foreigners) - both of which would suit the Iranic speakers of the Achaemenid era and Mauryan era living in Gandhara (NW-India). Patañjali was therefore not associating any Indo-Aryans with Asuras or mlecchas.  
  
Is there any historical literary or other evidence for what you say - that Prākṛt was not the label of a language but a class of Indian communication languages that have existed throughout history?As far as I know there is no indication or literary evidence of the existence of such a class of Prakrit languages in the Vedic era. Prakrit as a whole is a purely classical-sanskrit-era phenomenon i.e. its origin, growth and demise have all happened in the post-Vedic period.  
  
Extrapolating it to the Vedic period without any literary or manuscript evidence - is what I am trying to argue against. There is evidence to the contrary which indicates that the earliest Prakrit was only a single North-Western literary register in the pre-Mauryan era which gets spread all across India through Mauryan inscriptions (and due spread of Buddhism, again primarily from north Western India) and in the course of the next half a millenium splits into multiple separate registers (still these dont appear to be dialects but were purely literary registers).  
  
Vedic is not a prakrit (no part of Old-Indo-Aryan can be called a prakrit). Pāṇini does not regard Vedic as a form of Prakrit, if he did he would have included prakrit in his grammar. Prakrit did not exist in any form until the end of the Vedic period.Panini treats Vedic & Classical Sanskrit as simply two stages of Sanskrit and does not say that there is any third stage of Indo-Aryan that we might consider equivalent to Prakrit or middle-Indic. Patañjali however mentions individuals speaking defective Sanskrit (and foreigners speaking Asuric dialects, which he viewed as a corrupted form of Sanskrit which is in reality Iranic-influenced-corruptions in Sanskrit, which we consider prākrit today)
