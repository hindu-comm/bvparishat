Nagarajji,

Very well put. The scientific hypothesis is that the basic unit of expression of a human being in a syllable

that originates anatomically. This is where the transformation happens from an analog thought to a discrete

acoustic expressible signal. The latter can be represented by a Paninain set which can be extended in case  

other independent expressible units are discovered elsewhere in the world. There is possibly a natural grammar

of expression regulated by biology, on which we add cultural grammar.
We bring the role of communication

and phonetics in the cultural grammar, through which speech becomes a language. All natural speech would

consist of nouns (objects) and the relation would be expressed in accent and intonation, which would be subjective.  

This is our primary thinking so far (after ten years)..

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
