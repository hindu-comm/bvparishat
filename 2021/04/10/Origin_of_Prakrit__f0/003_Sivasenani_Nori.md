If we look at the evidence, we see relentless simplification at work: from Vedic to classical Sanskrit to Prakrits to Apabhramsas to modern languages. And this is found not just in the case of Sanskrit or in India. For instance, in spoken Telugu, the dative and accusative cases are fast disappearing. Singlish (Singapore English) used to be derided as pidgin English three decades back, now there are classes offered to teach Singlish! That languages evolve through simplification is a well-accepted principle in linguistics.

  

Yet, this directionality is supposed to have reversed at some point, when it comes to Sanskrit. Doesn't sound right.
