\> Modern western-academia is full of those who claim that only the Pāṇinian classical standard is sanskrit (and that Sanskrit was only spoken by the śiṣṭas) - and that all the commonly spoken dialects of the people were not Sanskrit - and that they were prakrit(s). This is historically completely incorrect.  

  

------ Yes, there is a strand of breaking India forces that try to create and use Sanskrit-Prakrit schism in support of their attempts.

  

I completely agree with you in your disagreeing with the view that 'all the commonly spoken dialects of the people were not Sanskrit'. My view is that all the commonly spoken dialects of the people were also Sanskrit.

  

But those among western and westernized Indian academics who deal with Prakrit(s) as a separate entity than Sanskrit too do not deny the relation between Prakrit(s) and Sanskrit. The only point of contention for some of them is whether the Prakrit(s) that they are studying under a separate department of the university are commonly spoken dialects of Sanskrit or not. Or in other words, whether to treat Sanskrit and Prakrit(s) together as a single language or not. Not to treat them as a single language suits their requirement of having a separate department of the university. For those involved in breaking India efforts, this helps in creating Hinduism-Buddhism and Hinduism-Jainism wedge and using it. For them this is useful to create and continue the argument that Sanskrit was the privilegedpreserve of the Brahmins and all other Indians were denied that preserve out of social discrimination. The picture that in all the geographical areas where Sanskrit was spoken , common people spoke its dialects and there was need for them to learn Sanskrit (or for Sanskrit speakers to learn the dialects) , in the areas where Sanskrit was not spoken, common people did not need to communicate with any Sanskrit speakers, so there was need for common people to learn Sanskrit - does not suit their breaking India agenda.

  

Fact is that Vedic works use Prakrit(s) too and Buddhist and Jain works use Sanskrit too. But to project Pali (and other Prakrit(s)) as the languages exclusive for Buddhist and Jain works and Sanskrit as not the language of works of Buddhism and Jainism and Sanskrit as the single language for Vedic works, no Prakrit(s) in them helps their language-based schism politics.

  

There definitely was a dialect ofSanskrit language of the North-West that was influenced by specifically Iranic 'apaśabda'usage(all non-standard is naturally'apaśabda' for the standard and vice-versa) . Your emphasis seems to be on the point that what came to be called as Prakrit(s) is just this dialect of Sanskrit not any other. Others may argue with you that the label Prakrit(s) was and is used in reference to dialects of Sanskrit other than the one north-western dialect that was influenced by Iranic'apaśabda'usage too.

  

So now the discussion is around this point : whetherwhat came to be called as Prakrit is just this dialect of Sanskrit of theNorth-West that was influenced by specifically Iranic 'apaśabda'usagenot any other

  

or

  

the label Prakrit(s) was and is used in reference to dialects of Sanskrit other than that dialect too.
