Sarvebhyo Namaḥ,

  

These are my original findings (in brief) of how, when and where Prākṛtam originates. I have not published them but would like to invite comments and thoughts.

  

Prākṛtam does not, as many western scholars have thus far claimed, originally represent a sociolectal or dialectal/vernacular form as opposed to Sanskrit, nor can all the innovations that are today commonly grouped under the umbrella term Prākrit be traced far back into the Vedic period as being the vernacular speech of the people.

  

The evidences from Pāṇini, Patañjali, Yāska etc have been misinterpreted mainly by scholars based in the West (I'll explain these misinterpretations in detail later) in such a way as to substantiate their conclusions that these grammarians recognized other Indo-Aryan languages outside Vedic and Sanskrit but no such fact is however actually evidenced in their texts.

  

For example the girl described in the Mahābhāṣya as using plural forms once in error (instead of dual for her eyes and feet) is misinterpreted by some scholars to mean that this represents a form of regional dialect/sociolect where everybody spoke plural in every situation where a dual was expected by Sanskrit. No such claim is made by Patañjali however that the girl was not speaking Sanskrit or that her mistakes were made by all commoners. Other evidences are similarly misinterpreted by modern scholars to take Prakrit back to a unknown hoary antiquity without proper evidences. There are in fact no explicit references to middle-Indic being used by common people long before the Mauryan era in any textual source.

  

The references to Asuric speech mentioned by Patañjali should be taken as Prākṛtic innovations originating from Iranic dialectal/orthographic sources from the North-West, rather than assuming that such explicitly mleccha (foreign) usages were used by all Indian commoners. It makes no sense to say that Patanjali was calling almost all his own countrymen mlecchas (Asuric speech community) or "demons" as some scholars mistranslate Asura as, when it would simply have meant Zoroastrian/Iranic.

  

My contention is that Prākṛta innovations (for the most part except where they are directly and explicitly inherited as-is from Vedic) originated substantially only in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE and not before that.

In 5th century BCE Northern India, all speech was in vernacular Old-Indic (i.e. late-Vedic) and writing was not in use yet. Writing was introduced in India using a new script called Kharoṣṭhī (which had been newly defined as a variant of from the imperial Aramaic script used by the Achaemenid Empire that had invaded North-Western India in the early 5th century BCE).

Doubtless the use of early Kharoṣṭhī for Old-Indic (though not phonetically very accurate for old-Indic phonemic inventory) was to keep it comprehensible with old-Iranic as these Indo-Iranian languages were both used, along with the Aramaic language itself, in different regions of the Śakyan (Hakhāmanah or Achaemenid) empire.

(Late-)Vedic was an accented Old-Indic language (having at least 3–4 major dialects) spoken all across northern and central India at that time. Doubtless some of the etymological clarity in Old-Indic word forms, was lost when writing was introduced in Sanskrit in the early 4th c. BCE - as orthography couldn't/didn't represent the older accented dialects (and Old-Indic as a whole) with full phonetic accuracy - and the ensuing variance between speech and writing led to a gradual loss of accents in speech too during the last few centuries BCE.

There was also significant linguistic confusion due to the large-scale mixing of old-Iranic dialects in Gandhāra in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE with Old-Indic due to the Śākyan (Achaemenid) invasion of NW India - leading to many phonetic, grammatical and orthographic innovations originating in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE that are grouped under the umbrella term "Prākṛta", heralding middle-Indic.

There is no Śākyan empire known in the mid first millenium BCE Indic textual sources except the Achaemenids who invaded NW India and introduced the prākṛtic innovations from the north-west (and which innovations were continued in the Mauryan era and later thus giving rise to Middle-Indic.

Please share your thoughts.

Thanks,

Ramakrishnan Suryanarayanan
