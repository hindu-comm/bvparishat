Dear Dr. Paturi,

  

Thanks again for elaborating.  
  
You have said "If you agree that Samskrutham /Sanskrit also had a similar spoken reality and had related regional and social dialects but you contend that those dialects need not or should not be called Prakrutam /Prakrit, the name Prakrutam /Prakritshould be reserved to a certain form of language or a certain language only, that is fine."

  

-- Yes this is what I'm saying. Sanskrit (or Old-Indic) definitely had multiple vernacular dialects even in Patañjali's time. Those vernacular dialects of Sanskrit were observed and their common/standardized features were described by Pāṇini. That does not mean the vernacular dialects are not sanskrit and that only the Pāṇinian standard is sanskrit.  
  
Modern western-academia is full of those who claim that only the Pāṇinian classical standard is sanskrit (and that Sanskrit was only spoken by the śiṣṭas) - and that all the commonly spoken dialects of the people were not Sanskrit - and that they were prakrit(s). This is historically completely incorrect.

  
The idea that common spoken dialects of the common people of Āryāvarta were prakrit - is not found in any of the ancient literature tomyknowledge. None of the old grammarians (as far as I am aware) have said that dialectal/vernacular/spoken Old-Indic is Prakrit or that all apaśabdas are ipso facto widespread dialectal usage.  
  
So the modern idea that all the commonly spoken old-Indic dialects can be called prakrit does not fit historical reality - it conflicts with the definition of prakrit (as the name of an originally āsuric/mleccha dialect) as used by the respected grammarians like Patañjali.  
  
I quote from the Pātañjala Mahābhāṣya specifically to highlight his observations. If Patañjali says the people of Āryāvarta were speaking sanskrit in his own time (sometimes with grammatical mistakes, while śiṣṭas usually spoke it without any mistakes) - which modern scholar can overrule those observations of Patañjali today (by claiming that the common people of his time were not speaking sanskrit) and on what basis?

-   yarvāṇas tarvāṇaḥ - is mispronounced sanskrit, but does not look
    anywhere close to prākṛt, as prakrit does not have any visarga -   pronouncing ṛtakaḥ as ḷtakaḥ cannot have happened in prākṛt as the
    use of ṛ is wholly absent in prākṛt so there would have been no
    choice in the matter.  
-   akṣīṇi me darśanīyāni , pādā me sukumārā - this is a grammatical
    error, but the sentence is fully in sanskrit, not in prakrit. -   gāvī, goṇi, gotā, gopotālikā - could be fictitious words in Sanskrit
    or prakrit - there is no claim that these were widespread dialectal
    variants.  

All the examples he gives of apaśabdas by people living in Āryāvarta are individual/personal errors (not widespread dialectal apaśabda usages) made by commoners and śiṣṭas who otherwise speak valid Sanskrit - those apaśabdas were not normative/dialectal in nature.

  

The only dialectal/normative use of apaśabdas that he mentions is the āsuric speech of the mlecchas (Iranic people who may have migrated into Gandhāra during the rule of the Sakya (Achaemenid) empire's rule of Gandhara in the 5th & 4th centuries BCE.  
  
The Sanskrit language of the North-West that was influenced by specifically Iranic apaśabda usage is what later becomes known as prākṛtam. Sanskrit however was not wholly superceded/replaced by Prākrit as the Śiṣṭas of Āryāvarta didn't adopt the mleccha (prakrit) usages - they put all their efforts to preserving Sanskrit which alone they identified as their traditional language. Prākṛtam was not viewed as an integral part of Indic/vedic tradition of Āryāvarta at all by the śiṣṭas as they knew it was affected by mleccha (foreigner's) usages.  
  

The Sanskrit plays are not from the vedic period, but from the last 2000 years - when those plays were written, there probably were multiple prakrits but even those dramatic prakrits were artificial literary languages (their linguistic characteristics were fixed by literary convention) they were not the continuously natural evolving speech of the people.

  

If the prakrit represented a more widely understood natural language, the prakrit parts of the drama would not have needed a sanskrit chāya, rather the sanskrit parts should have had a prakrit chāya.

Ramakrishnan Suryanarayanan
