Namaste



1. I agree with Prof. Bijoy Misras line of thinking. : { Prakrit is a Co-Located language with Samskrutham in history of Bharath. Users have preferred Samskruth- Prakruth per their needs to document their teaching and propagate. }



2. I agree with Prof. Bijoy Misra;s proposition : \< To me, the whole
proto-indo-European is an artificial unscientific construct and is stuck in some quarters forhistoricalreasons.> .



There is a critical need to revisit the ‘ Samskruth-Prakruth- Relations : Socailly, Linguistically from a native perspective’ by coming out of ‘ IE artificality locked to ‘Tower of Babel/Darwinism’.

The study needs to shift gears from ‘ Non-Translatable’ to ‘ Deliverables’. This is where Prof. Misras work on linking language to neuro-science / consciousness studies is of significance.



3. Just as studying ‘Samskrutham using lens of Prakrtuh’ is faulty, study of ‘ Samskruth-Prakruth-relations’ using ‘ Desi – Apabhramsha- Mleccha- ’ lens is also faulty.



Studying ‘apple’ using the category-rules of ‘oranges- grapes, strawberries ( using logic of ‘Apple and Orange/grapes/strawberries
are all fruits; therefore same rules apply for all fruits for analysis), is faulty. It is called ‘Hermeneutic error / Categorization Error’.
