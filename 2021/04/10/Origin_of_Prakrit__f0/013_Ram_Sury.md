Dear Śrī Rajeev Lochan,

  

Thanks for bringing this paper to my attention.  
  
She appears to be ignoring contrary evidence (i.e. cherry pickingher evidence), so her argument appears very much like circular logic.  
  
For example see the end of page 11 where she says that tanū ("body") is used as a reflexive pronoun "oneself" while in Sanskrit it is the noun ātman "spirit" which is used.  
  
In Pāli it is usually āttan (ātman) that is in most common use as the reflexive pronoun (see "attā hi attano natho" from dhammapada for example), and the same is the case for the so-called Gāndhārī language - which she does not mention for obvious reasons. Cherry-pickingparticular usages does not prove any systematic relation.  
  
Also see - pages 6 & 7 (Introduction) of Pali: A Grammar of the Language of the Theravada Tipitaka'by Prof. Thomas Oberlies where he lists down some non-Indic sound-shifts in Pāli that are not found in any dialect of Old-Indic but are traceable to Iranic (specifically Avestan).  

  

Regards,  
Ramakrishnan Suryanarayanan
