Dear Dr. Suryanaryanan,

There is a distinct school that advocates that Prakrit as a language is a distorted form of Sanskrit.

I disagree with such inference. To me, Prakrit is not a label of a languagebut the classof indian

communication languages thathad developed throughout history. Valmiki uses प्राकृत as a label

on people who would be hill-based and not gone through the Vedic schooling, (generally called

आर्य ). The basis vocabulary of such languages would be similar to the Vedic Sanskrit that

eventuallyPanini lumps asसज्ञा in Book Vi. In such thinking, the Vedic Sanskrit would be an

offshootfrom thesePrakrit family languages. The analytic work is not done. To me, the whole

proto-indo-European is an artificial unscientific construct and is stuck in some quarters for

historicalreasons.

Best regards,

Bijoy.Misra
