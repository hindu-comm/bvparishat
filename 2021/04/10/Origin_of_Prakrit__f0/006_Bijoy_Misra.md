Sri Suryanaryana,

Don't get stuck with what has been said. Try to be analytic and find your own track.

What I am saying is that प्राकृत is a generic term used by Valmiki.

In the context, it would mean people who are non-vedic in their conduct.

Track that back in jaina literature and in older indigenous oral literature.

Follow the syllable theory of Bhatrhari and reject the phonetic theory.  

it may not be simple or cursory, but dig in and you would discover more.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
