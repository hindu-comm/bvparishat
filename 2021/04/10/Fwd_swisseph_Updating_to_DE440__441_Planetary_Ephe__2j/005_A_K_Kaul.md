Dear Prof Misra,

Jai Shri Ram!

Really glad to note that you liked my response to the query about various dates of the Mbh and VR events etc.

Do kindly give me feedback regarding the"exposition" after going through the attachments.

Yes, Bharatiya Panchangas have got derailed and unfortunately, most of us appear to be reluctant to take the bull by the horns!

It will be a boon for the entire Hindu community if your Observatory takes the lead in setting it right!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul

  

PS

I was elated to see you addressing me as "Dear Pandit Kaul" since in Kashmir every Hindu is a Pandit---and that is why the first Prime Minister of Independent India was called as Pundit/Pandit Nehru!

And he enjoyed it in spite of being "secular"!

AKK
