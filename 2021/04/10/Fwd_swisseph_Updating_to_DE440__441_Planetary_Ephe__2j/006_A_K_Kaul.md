Dear Shri Raja Rammohan Roy,

Jai Shri Ram!

\< Like Prof. Misra, I really admire your write up. I would say that I had a similar journey as you describe.I would say that I had a similar journey as you describe>

It is for the first time that I get such a heartening response from scholars like you and Prof. Misra to a very ticklish---nay even "controversial" issue!

Many thanks to both of you for the same.

\<Have you taken a look at Jain astronomy texts (Surya Prajnapti, Jambudwipa Prajnapti and others) and Buddhist astronomy text Shardulakaranavadana (part of Ashokavadana)? I believe that these texts bridge the gap between Vedanga Jyotisha and siddhanta texts. Astronomy in Jain texts is similar to Vedanga Jyotisha even in the 2nd-4th century BCE. \>  

No, I have not read the Jain astronomy texts directly but have gone through some blogs and articles about them. And they confirm whatyou have said in a nutshell, "Astronomy in Jain texts is similar to Vedanga Jyotisha even in the 2nd-4th century BCE".

In the Panchasiddhantika (of 505 CE) of Varahamihira, we find that Pitamaha Siddhanta more or less towed to a great extent the same line as that of the VJ whereas Vasishtha siddhanta is a bit different though!

Paulsiha and Romaka are Greek siddhantas as their names indicate which singles out the Surya Siddhanta as the only "स्पष्टतरः" siddhanta, especially since we find Mesha etc. Rashis for the first time in that Siddhanta out of all the five siddhantas!

There were no Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis prior to that siddhanta in any astronomical work, which confirms the stand that these Rashis came to India much later---maybe early centuries of CE---much after the VJ or the Atharva Jyotisha or even Atharva-Veda Parishshishta etc.

Regarding "Buddhist astronomy" someone had suggested a book titled "Dasharatha Jatakam" which I found obnoxious, to say the least! It was also quite off-putting about Buddhist astronomy!

Kindly do continue giving your feedback!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
