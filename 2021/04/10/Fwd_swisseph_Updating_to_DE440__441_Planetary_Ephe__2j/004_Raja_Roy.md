Dear Shri Kaul,

  

Like Prof. Misra, I really admire your write up. I would say that I had a similar journey as you describe. Have you taken a look at Jain astronomy texts (Surya Prajnapti, Jambudwipa Prajnapti and others) and Buddhist astronomy text Shardulakaranavadana(part of Ashokavadana)? I believe that these texts bridge the gap between Vedanga Jyotisha and siddhanta texts. Astronomy in Jain texts is similar to Vedanga Jyotisha even in the 2nd-4th century BCE.

  

Best regards,

Raja
