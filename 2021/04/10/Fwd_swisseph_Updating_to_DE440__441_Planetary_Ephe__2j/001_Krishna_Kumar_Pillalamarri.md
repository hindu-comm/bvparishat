Dear Shri AK Kaul,

  

This note is informative. I want to link this to the earlier correspondence we had regarding the dating of Ramayana and Mahabharata by Shri Nilesh Oak and Ms. Rupa Bhaty. Specifically Ms. Rupa vigorously defended her research and findings, and you 'seemingly' were disputing the results because they were basing their research on DE430/DE431. You have now been gracious to give the details of the publication of DE440/DE441. In all this, the big unanswered question for me is: what exactly is your objection to JPL's DE430/431, and by extension the new DE440/DE441? I tried to follow your logiccarefully, yet theanswer missed me. I don't deny my ignorance in the matter, but objectively stating, the disdain should be matched by a specific instance of invalidation, isn't it? Mind you, I 'get' that the source of the astronomical data on which Shri Oak's and Ms. Bhaty's research is based on foreign sources. What is the alternative?

  

Best Regards,  
  
Krishna
