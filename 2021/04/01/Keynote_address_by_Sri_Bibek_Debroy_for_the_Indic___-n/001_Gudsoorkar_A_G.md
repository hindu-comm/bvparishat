Dear Dr Nagaraja Paturi,

Thank you very much for sharing this video of Key Note address. It certainly gives an overview of the contents and importance of Puranas.

  

If there were talks from other speakers dedicated to each Purana viz Garud, Vishnu, Matsya, Padma and others, I request you to pl share.

  

The talks by Ms Maitri Goswami and Dr M. Jayaraman were also very informative and educative.

Many Thanks.

-Ashok Gudsoorkar
