In Indo Aryan languages, question words usually begin with “k”. Example Sanskrit kim, Hindi kyoṃ etc. This is so in Gujarati too, except for the word “what”. “What” is Śuṃ (શું) in Gujarati. Is there a related word in Sanskrit, the various Prakrits and Apabhramshas, or even outside of Indo Aryan in other Indo-European languages?
