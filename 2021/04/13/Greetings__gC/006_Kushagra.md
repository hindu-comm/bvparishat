The names of the Samvatsara differ according to the convention. In the North, those following the Vikram Samvat calendar just concluded the Pramadi Samvatsara. Thereafter, Ananda should sequentially follow but according to some, there has been a लोप of Ananda. So, the Rakshasa Samvatsara has arrived.

  

However, in the South, Sharvari has been followed by Plava.

  

The sequence of names is the same in both.
