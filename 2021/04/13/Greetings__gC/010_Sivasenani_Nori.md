In North India Baarhaspatyamaana is followed for the sake of naming the year. It is Chaandramaana in the South. Hence the difference in names.

  

The sixty year cycle itself is based on Jupiter. Yuga is five years. Each Jupiter year is equal to roughly 12 Earth years. Hence one Yuga or cycle becomes 60 Earth years. The difference in reconciling these 12 Eath years with 1 Jupiter year is the reason for missing years etc.

  

The book Indian Calendar by Balakrishna Dikshit and Robert Sewell is a very good starting point.<https://archive.org/details/IndianCalendarSewelDikshit>
