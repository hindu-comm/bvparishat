-जयरामेण प्रणीतम्-  
**॥प्लव-वत्सर-पञ्चकम्॥

A Pentad of verses on Plava year by Jayaraman  
(The word Plava means to leap, jump, float)  
  
पुप्लुवे सागरं दीर्घं मारुतिः पारगस्तथा।     
दुस्थितेः पारगत्वं स्यात् शुभे नः प्लवहायने॥१॥  
In ancient times Maruti leapt accross the great ocean and reached the other shores. Similarly in this year of plava(leap), let us also leap accross our sufferings and attain safer shores.  
   
उडुपः प्लवते नद्यां तरणे करणं हि सः।  
सत्कार्ये करणं स्याम प्रार्थ्यते प्लवहायने॥२॥      
A small boat floats (plavate) in the river. It is instrumental in crossing (the river). It is prayed that - let us also be instruments in some good work in this year of Plava(leap/float).   
  
प्लवगस्य शिशुर्यद्वत् संश्लिष्येद् मातरं दृढम्।  
दृढभक्ता तथा चेशे स्यामास्मिन् प्लवहायने॥३॥  
The kid of a monkey(plava-ga) holds to its mother firmly. It is prayed that - Similarly let our devotion to the divinity also be firm in this year of Plava.   
  
प्लवगौ कपिभेकौ तावुरुविक्रमणः कपिः(हरिः)।  
तथोरुक्रमणाः स्याम शुभेऽस्मिन् प्लवहायने॥४॥  
Both monkey and frog are called as plavaga (as both leap/jump). But the stride/leap of the monkey (hari/monkey) is wider (Hari also means lord Narayana who in three steps covered the entire universe). Similary let us make wide strides (of progress) in this year of Plava.   
  
अप्सु संप्लवते पद्मपत्रं तन्नार्द्रतां व्रजेत्।    
तथा निस्पृहता नः स्यात् प्रार्थ्यते प्लवहायने॥५॥   
The lotus leaf floats (plavate) on the water but it does not get wet. It is prayed that - In the same manner let us develop the quality of overcoming attachments in this year of Plava.
