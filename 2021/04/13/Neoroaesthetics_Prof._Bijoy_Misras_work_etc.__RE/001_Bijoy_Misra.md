Prof Paturi,

This would be useful. Prof Ramachandran originally hinted on the phenomenology

in aesthetics. In our view, human aesthetics is biologically driven with a limited

expression, but plays the major role in thought segmentation.

Thanks for the pointers. We will study. We are applying for funding this summer.

Our goal is to create a quantitative model.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
