I came across the MA dissertation by one Logan R Beitman that I am sharing here

  

It is called

  

"Neuroscience and Hindu Aesthetics: A Critical Analysis of V.S. Ramachandran’s “Science of Art”"

  

What I immediately remembered is our own BVP family member Prof. Bijoy Misra's interest and work in the area and his paper for WSC etc.
