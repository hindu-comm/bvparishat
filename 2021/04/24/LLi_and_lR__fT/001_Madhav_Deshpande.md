Dear Radhakrishna Ji,

  

  I agree with you that ऌ in कॢप्त has no र sound in it, and Patanjali says clearly that this is the only place where ऌ actually occurs in Sanskrit usage. The form is derived by Panini by positing a root कृप् and then proposing the substitution of r>l \[कृपो रो ल:\].
While a phonetic combination of ल्+ऋ is theoretically possible, this combination does not occur anywhere in Sanskrit usage. The pronunciation of कॢ as *klri*or *klru*is obviously mistaken, though it is quite rampant. With best wishes,
