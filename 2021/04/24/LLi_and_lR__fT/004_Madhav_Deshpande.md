Dear Professor Kannan,

  

  As far as I understand, the ऌ in गमॢ etc. is not ल्+ऋ, but the vowel ऌ. An indication of this may be seen in the rule पुषादिद्युताद्यॢदित: परस्मैपदेषु P. 3.1.55. The expression ऌदित: here begins with the vowel ऌ, and not the consonant ल्, and therefore the combination द्युतादि+ऌदित: undergoes sandhi by इको यणचि. Secondly, the expression ऌदित् refers to verb roots like गमॢ and शकॢ, as is clear from the examples in the Kashikavritti. If ऌ were to be understood as ल्+ऋ in these cases, the rules that apply to ऋदित् items will now apply to ऌदित् as well. This has been my understanding of Panini. With best regards.
