Is there some way of differentiating the two *in transliteration*?  

\- is what I intended to drive at.

lr̥ as V, and

lr̥ as CV .

  

Has anyone discussed the question as to how to pronounce differently,  

if at all possible - speaking of the combination as theoretically possible :  

l followed by r̥

l followed by lr̥

r followed by r̥ &

r followed by lr̥

\- immaterial of whether they actually occur in words/are just conceivable ?

  

Sonographs capable of graphically differentiating between *kr* and *kr̥*

alone can perhaps tell whether a person is pronouncing the two properly.
