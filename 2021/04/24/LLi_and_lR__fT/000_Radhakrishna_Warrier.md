Just heard a person who is supposed to be knowledgeable in Sanskrit pronounce the letter ऌ with an ‘r’ sound (as lṛ). The same person pronounced the word कॢप्त (meaning limited) as klripta, again with an r sound.  

In my view both these pronunciations are wrong. 

I believe that there should be no ‘r’ sound in ऌ. This letter is part of the series अ, आ, इ, ई, उ, ऊ, ऋ, ॠ, ऌ, ॡ, ... and should be pronounced without the ‘r’ sound, almost like the “le” in the American (not British or Indian) pronunciation of the English word able. 

However, the letter लृ in the series ल, ला, लि, ली, लु, लू, लृ,… should be pronounced with an ‘r’ sound as lṛ.

In short ऌ and लृ are two different letters; the first one should **not** be pronounced with an ‘r’ sound while the second should be pronounced with an ‘r’ sound.

If the very short vowel that comes after the ‘r’ sound in कृष्ण (kṛṣṇa) be represented by ‘@’, ऋ will be r@ and ऌ will be l@.
