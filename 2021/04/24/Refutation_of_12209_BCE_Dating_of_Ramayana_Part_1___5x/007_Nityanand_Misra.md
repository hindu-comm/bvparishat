This was also part 1 of 10, so I think we have to be fair to Dr. Roy and read all the parts before jumping to conclusions.

Astronomy is a very broad field, and I doubt if anybody on this forum is a master of all subfields of Astronomy. What specific aspects/fields/concepts of astronomy are you referring to?I wonder if the astronomy involved in your work or that of Sh. Oak is really that difficult to comprehend.
