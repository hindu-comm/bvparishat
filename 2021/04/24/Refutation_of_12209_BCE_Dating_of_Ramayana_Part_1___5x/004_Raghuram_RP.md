May be a naive question , about Ram Setu (as written in the article)

How do we account for 100 yojanas distance from Rameshwaramto present Lanka, Of course there is no direct conversion between yojanas and miles or kilometers

Is it generally accepted that the modern Lanka is same as the Lanka of Ramayana times
