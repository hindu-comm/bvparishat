Respected Dr Yadu,

  

The mind likes to have whatever can be comprehendedby the intellect. Today the mind is focused on one thing and tomorrow it may want another thing. Today someone is interested in just the message tomorrow they may insist on getting the dates. No one can tell.

  

Thus scholars should try to lay bare everything that the intellect can comprehend.

  

True, the message is the key but human mind being what it is, it may at times refuse to get the message unless told about other things as well. It is not uncommon for people to hear a good quote and then go looking for who said, where, etc.

  

The teachings, technology, techniques in our Scriptures are the most important things but other matters like who wrote, when, where, etc., may add to the appeal of the Scriptures.

  

Thanks.
