Dear Shri Tuvij ji,

  

Thanks for your note. But I feel it is taking my point too lightly. 'The whole of Dvapara Yuga cannot be just about 8,500 years old, if Nilesh'stimelines are accepted. What we know of Mahabharata war timing will ensure Ramayana will have to be much more than 12K BCE. I agree with your observation that the whole context of a sloka needs to be taken, and not just the literal meaning of a word. Yet the reason I am interested in pursuing this thought is that it may finally clarify our concept of Yuga, Mahayuga, and Kalpa. These concepts have been explained by several scholars, yet we are still arguing that Ramayana is dated at 12K BCE. I personally talked to Shri Samavedam Shanmukha Sarma garu, a great exponent of shastras. He explained Ramayana is not from this mahayugam.

  

Best Regards,  
  
Krishna
