Respected Shri Kaul,

  

The points you raise need a convincing response. I am not an expert but like most people I have some views about it based on what I have read.

  

Most of these Scriptures have an original core and then content like Ram ruled for 100,000 years, which may be a later insertion. Because of this we cannot reject the core that might yet be of great value. Perhaps we need to separate the core from the Scriptures first and then base our research on that core.

  

The use of star positions and other such information to get a deeper understanding of the Scriptures may be based on this idea of a core plus insertions. All scholarly work, done with dispassion, will help us to get more out of the teachings in these Scriptures.

  

Thanks.

  

Himanshu
