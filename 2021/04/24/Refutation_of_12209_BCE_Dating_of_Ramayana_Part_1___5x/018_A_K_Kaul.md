Sushri Rupa Bhaty Ji,

Jai Shri Ram!

The "speakers" of my monitor/system are having some problem.

Because of "lockdown" I have no idea when they will be replaced, if at all!

Even otherwise also, I would prefer a "written" discussion point by point on the issues involved in my mail.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
