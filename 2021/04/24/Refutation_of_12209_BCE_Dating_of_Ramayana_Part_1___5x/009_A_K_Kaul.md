Sushri Rupa Bhatyji,

Jai Shri Ram!

\< And that's all. It appears to me that there is no need for any responses since one cannot inculcate astronomy sciences in every individual here.>

IMHO, fixing the date of Incarnation of Bhagwan Ram or Rama-Ravana-Yuddha etc. is like the famous story of कीलोत्पाटी वानरः !

And there is no need of involving any astronomy in the same!

I have scrupulously tried to avoid any discussion about it but now that it is already going on, I have just a couple of questions to all the scholars, including you, who have "fixed" the dates of Incarnation of Bhagwan Ram or of Rama-Ravana Yuddha etc. whether about 4000 BCE or about 7000 BCE or even about 12200 BCE!

As per the Valmiki Ramayana

1\. King Dasharatha is supposed to have ruled for 60000 years before he was blessed with a son. (Attachment Dasharatha 600000-years'wait)!
What are yourviews about the same especially since he claimed that his ''natal moon was besieged by malefic planets like Sun, Mars and Rahu etc? (Ayodhya-Kanda-4/8-19). When was king Dasharatha born?

2. Bhagwan Ram is supposed to have ruled for eleven thousand years.
What is all the more surprising, is that the epic Mahabharata itself has confirmed that Bhagwan Ram did rule for 11000 years! (Attachment Rama-Rajya 11000 years)

3\. My simple question is that if He had Incarnated in around 12000 BCE and is supposed to have ruled for 11000 years, how could the Mahabharata war have taken place in 5561 BCE or even 3102 BCE or even in about 1000 BCE since till then it was Rama-Rajya!

4\. As per those scholars, who claim that Bhagwan Ram had Incarnated in about 4000 BCE, Rama Rajya will last till at least 8000 AD, and as per those scholars who claim that He had Incarnated in about 7000 BCE, Rama-Rajya will last till about 5000 AD!

5\. Did Mahabharata war take place during Rama-Rajya or was Kuru-vamsha really the ruler then?

In fact it just makes a mockery of all our Puranas etc. which claim that Kaliyuga started in 1431 or 1531 BCE! (Attachment Pauranic-Kaliyuga)

6\. Aryabhatiya or SS Kaliyuga has already been declared as ''imaginary" by none other than the Calendar Reform Committee itself!

(Attachment CRC-Kaliyuga-imaginary!)

7\. There are quite a few references in theVR to much later events of"Kaliyuga" like Janmejaya, Dundhumar, Shakas and Yavanas, and (Gautama the) Buddha-----who has been likened to a thief (for having condemned the Vedas).

8\. That means there have been quite a few additions to theoriginal VR if it was really "compiled" about 12000 years back! What are your views about the same?

It is not a reflection on anybody's scholarship, but it looks like that we are washing our dirty linen in public unknowingly under the impression of ''proving our scholarship"!!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
