Dear Nityananda ji,

  

I see that you have startedmoderating very sensitiveissues of Astronomy claims. I had already posted the link to Mr. Roy's refutation of my claim of 10,000 BCE of Uttara Phalguniepoch. To begin with, that was the simplest effort to bring forth the truth of samvatsara in Brahmanas which are extensionsof Vedas. When I asked Mr. Roy to refute the refutation done by me he had said he doesn't bother and further warned me to be ready for another refutation. That is not good in favor of science.

  

I carefully chaffed out both the uttaraphalguni phrases of different Brahmanas and showed that we will have to goby internal evidence of the text in question and have shown them in yet another blog.

  

<https://rupabhaty.home.blog/2021/03/28/epoch-of-uttaraphalguni-10000-bce-no-ifs-no-buts/>  

[https://rupabhaty.home.blog/2021/03/29/heliacal-rising-in-tai-brah-to-ascertain-the-nakṣatra-in-vernal-equinox/](https://rupabhaty.home.blog/2021/03/29/heliacal-rising-in-tai-brah-to-ascertain-the-nak%E1%B9%A3atra-in-vernal-equinox/)  

  

That was the simplest way of presentation by me ( without alpha, beta , theta star names and degrees at vernal etc) yet everyone here kept silent on this issue. It brought to my thought that probably many among us are not comprehending since astronomy must be complicated to some.

  

Other than that I would request to not go by Laukika and Chandobhaashaa here, for Kennedy has said that if stone implements were made in trading size at one place then language was necessarilythere. Of course we all have the mindset that Rg veda was written in 1900 BCE and so Brahmana must be more neo to us and that keeps us away from the evidence.

  

I will be happy to take the QA for my refutation to Mr. Roy's refutation of my claim of 10,000 BCE for Uttara phalguni epoch.

  

Kindly also ignore my problems of Dyslexia in my blog. I am thus very hesitant about writing.

  

Regards

  

Rupa
