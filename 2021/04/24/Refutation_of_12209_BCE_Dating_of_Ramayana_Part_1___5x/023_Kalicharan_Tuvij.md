Namaste.

  

Why is dating Ramayana/Mahabharata important?

Because among other things it makes us recover the basic principles on which Panchanga, or the time measurement framework, rests.

  

That's exactly where Oak-Bhaty get it right when they inculcate precession into Panchanga system thus giving basic credit to the intellect and experience of the Rsi-s. From here onwards it is indeed difficult to err much.

  

In my understanding they've erred by \~2000 years on both counts: Ramayana and Mahabharata datings.

But since Ramayana is along bigger time scales, the error is acceptable, and the dating is able to correctly convey the time scale of Ramayana (the historical event, not the text; att. Mr Kaul).

  

Any said errors would also be removed, if some more understanding is gained regarding the principles of Panchanga due to which Nakshatra-s also undergo some changes yuga-to-yuga (i.e. bigger time-scales).

  

In the meanwhile, Oak-Bhaty work should be appreciated and understood in a proper light (not in black or white).
