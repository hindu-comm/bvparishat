*"**Indian civilization is grounded in intellectual inquiry and we have survived numerous assaults on our civilization simply because of the strength of our knowledge systems**. However, at present, I observe that many intellectuals have fallen prey to bogus claims. As I write these articles, Prachyam is involved in the production of ten documentaries that intend to correct the historical inaccuracies of currently accepted Indian history \[1\]. Three of these episodes seem to be based on Oak’s claims, one of them being the claim that the Rāmāyaṇa can be dated back to 12209 BCE. **Without the careful vetting of these claims by outside observers,** the fallout from such documentaries can be dire — both to the viewers and the producers, and even* **more so to the Indian intellectual tradition***."*

  

Dr. Roy, You have said it all. Indirectly this is what I was pointing out in my BVP posts of 17th, 19th ...... 25th March

Your observation applies equally well to several others who do not consider that rational and scientific means are important in Indic historical chronology studies.  

Keep up your good work. All the best...
