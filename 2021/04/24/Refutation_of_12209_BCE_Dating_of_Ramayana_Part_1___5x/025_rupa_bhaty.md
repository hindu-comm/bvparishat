Dear Nityanand ji,

  

Although your kindself is not moderating, but with all due respect it is still a request to please read my two blogs on addressing the problems of vasanta and hemanta-shishir's identification with Samvatsara in the case of both Uttaraphalguni epoch, which are just five min read. Brahmanas are sanskrit texts and based on that I have tried to decode. You have great command of the sanskritlanguage and I know it will take a fraction of seconds for you to understand what I have discussed there. I have read these texts keeping aside any preconceivednotions (initiallyI used to see only Winter Solstice everywhere). After coming across the **Agni and Soma** concept of Samvatsara, I tried to understand the heat insolation ( gharma) of the northern and southern hemisphere w.r.t Sun rising in the Northernand Southern Hemisphere (simple observations), i.e. VE to AE and AE to VE observations. Then I gathered ethnographic information to understand better if we are missing something greater in all the indic texts. It appears that Indian calendar system was accurate till 500 CE and consistent with the Spring equinox,thus the names Viṣu,Bihu etc, which are cognates of Viṣuva.

  

Few of the texts that I gathered in regard of Gharma, Agni, Samvatsara, ShiraH, Deva, Madhu connection from TaitiriyaAraNyaka is given as under for your perusal.

  

आ **घर्मो अग्निमृतयन्नसादीत्** ८ अनाधृष्या पुरस्तात् । **अग्नेराधिपत्ये** । आयुर्मे दाः । पुत्रवती दक्षिणतः । इन्द्र स्याधिपत्ये । प्रजां मे दाः । सुषदा पश्चात् । **देवस्य सवितुराधिपत्ये** । प्राणं मे दाः ।

  

देव **घर्म** देवान्पाहि ८, ४।७।८  

**घर्मं****पात****वसवो**यजता वट् १५ स्वाहा त्वा सूर्यस्य रश्मये वृष्टिवनये जुहोमि १६**मधु हविरसि**१७४।८। १५,१६,१७

**घर्मः शिरस्तदयमग्निः ।**४।१७।१

अनुवाक ११, **घर्म या ते दिवि** शुक् । या **गायत्रे** छन्दसि ।४।११।११**  
**

अनुवाक १९-**अग्निरसि वैश्वानरोऽसि** । संवत्सरोऽसि परिवत्सरोऽसि । इदावत्सरोऽसीदुवत्सरोऽसि । इद्वत्सरोऽसि वत्सरोऽसि । **तस्य ते वसन्तः शिरः** । ....। **ऋतवस्ते कल्पन्ताम् । संवत्सरस्ते कल्पन्ताम् । अहोरात्राणि ते कल्पन्ताम्** । एति प्रेति वीति समित्युदिति । **प्रजापतिस्त्वा सादयतु** । तया देवतयाऽङ्गिरस्वद्ध्रुवः सीद..४।१९।१ (devas are from VE to AE, stated in Sūryasiddhāntaas well, Angirasas/later Asuras are from AE till VE, I read it in Aitereya, unable to locate instantly from my hardcopy)  

Uttaraphalguni epoch phrase..."वसन्ताग्निमाधत्तेमुख्यएव भवति / यदुत्तरे फल्गुनि **मुख्य एव**संवत्सरस्याग्निमाधायवसियान् भवति।"मुख्य (head) here attests**घर्मः शिरस्तदयमग्निः ।**४।१७।१

Now for the FAQ that "vasanta never starts with the cardinal point Vernal equinox and thus new year cannot be ascertained and Indians didn't know how to observesaṃvatsara in Brāhmaṇas" we have arescue in the word "Agni" here in the pics attached from AitereyaBrāhmaṇathat Vishuva is the day that begetssaṃvatsara.

``` सम्वत्सरः- एषोऽग्निः।[ (शतपथ ब्राह्मण ६/२/२/१८)सम्वत्सरहीअग्निहै जो ऋतुओं को धारण करता है- सम्वत्सरः- एषोऽग्निः। स ऋतव्याभिः संहितः। सम्वत्सरमेवैतत्-ऋतुभिः-सन्तनोति, सन्दधाति॥। ```

``` संवत्सरो विषूवर्णैः । (१।१२) अनुवाक १२, तैत्तिरीयारण्यकम् प्रपाठकः १ ```

It appears to me that Gujarata and Coptics had trade relations and thus for the sake of similar tax calendarthey maintained similar year beginnings, especially must have appeared during Neolithic period. My Theory is- **All the Indian texts are consistent with the year beginning from Vasant Vishuva- Spring Equinox**. Once we understand this simple arithmetic of year beginning then we can move forward to dating of our scripture and where the problems began in understanding of Vedāñga Jyotiṣa. I always wondered that Gujaratis celebrate Uttarāyaṇain humongous way but yet their Bestu baras is near fall equinox, why? Why not from Uttarāyaṇa? Similar is the case of Lohri during Makarsankrānti but new year begins in Baisakhi. I had been very inquisitive and discussed with many at twitter who know Sanskrit. I am raising these questions for discussion-reg ofVedāñga Jyotiṣa.

  

Thanks in advance and Regards

  

Rupa
