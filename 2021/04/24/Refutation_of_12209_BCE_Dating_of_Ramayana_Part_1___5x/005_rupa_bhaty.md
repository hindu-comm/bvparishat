Namaste Raghuram ji,

  

It's not a naive question at all. It's a valid question since 100 yojana was not used as an approximation "**upamāna**" for the huge distance but Rāmāyaṇa has given the width in yojana also.

  

We cannot account for 100 yojana distance from Rameshwaram to today's Sri Lanka which is just 125 km away that too in the South East direction. 

  

One can say that it is now generally accepted for Sri Lanka to be Rāmāyaṇa's Lanka. But as per the description of Rāmāyaṇa Lanka lay south of the Indian peninsula.

  

regards

  

Rupa
