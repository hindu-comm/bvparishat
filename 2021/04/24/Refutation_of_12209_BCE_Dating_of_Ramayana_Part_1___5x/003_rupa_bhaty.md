Dear all,

  

Whatever was good in this refutation was the compile-ups of screenshots of Nilesh Oak's works in the blog.

  

And that's all. It appears to me that there is no need for any responses since one cannot inculcate astronomy sciences in every individual here.

  

Best wishes for scientific comprehension.

  

And best regards.

  

Rupa
