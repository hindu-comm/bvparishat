The holistic but difficult "here-and-now", or viniyoga, should indeed be the approach to undertaking such tasks where warring viewpoints have to be accounted for (including sceptic, agnostic ones), where the indecisive "moving in circles" or the decisive "panchAyati verdict of the day" comes all too easy.

KKP ji,



Sanskrit is the key here. Not as a language but as a theory of language. In past (in this forum) I had replied to the same question using a so called "परिमाण-rule" for correct reading of Sanskrit texts.

  

But here let me answer this with example (no claim to authority made here).

  

"For specifically a purANa-itihAsa text e.g. Ramayana, the correct meaning of a word is dependent on a few lines (say 5 either side) surrounding that word."

  

e.g. when Dasharatha speaks of "SaSTiH varSa sahasraaNi jaatasya mama kaushika", here "jaatasya mama" would mean his own birth if we go by immediate context, but could mean "his race/lineage" (secondary meaning of jaata) if the whole context is accounted for.

  

Similarly, 11000 years could mean "the whole of subsequent dvApara yuga", with the understanding that an avatAra at the junction of a yuga is the default ruler/deity of the ensuing yuga.

  

Yet again, the purANa-itihAsa evidence, even when read correctly, cannot be expected to be accurate upto say minutes and seconds (though altogether calling "figurative" is also better avoided),e.g. 11,275.8643 years kind of figures; simply not the scope of such texts.
