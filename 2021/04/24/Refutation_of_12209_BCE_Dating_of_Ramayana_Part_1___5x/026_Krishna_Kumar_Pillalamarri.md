Mr. Tuvij and others on the list:

  

I have a curious question which has been bugging me for some time now. Since the issue of dating of Ramayana and Mahabharata is a heated one now, allow me to write a disclaimer first: I have no real knowledge of astronomy, am not a scholar in this field, nor am I fully qualified to pit myself against anyone in this discussion. Yet, I know some sanskrit, and am keenly following the archaeo-astronomy discussion started by Shri Nilesh Oak and responded to by Shri Roy and enjoined by Ms. Rupa Bhaty. In the interest of academic interest, all ideas must be allowed to surface.

  

Mr. Tuvij wrote that Ramayana the historical event is approximately correct according to Shri Oak,+/- 2,000 years. This raised a question in my mind, keeping in mind Ramayana happened in Treta Yugam. Even if I discard the yuga calculations for the time being, there is another issue.

  

Valmiki is a writer of Ramayanam and also a part of the story of Ramayanam. Sita actually lives at his ashramam, gives birth to Lava and Kusha and Valmiki was their teacher till they meet Rama and defeat him (?) after which Rama attains kaivalyam again. Ramayana does say Rama and Sita have spent a long time after they return from Lanka, and then Rama sends Sita to the forest again based on the suspicions all people of the land carry (not just the rajaka alone). This means Rama ruled for 11,000 years and then begat Lava and Kusha, and before they were born (Ramayana is silent on if he knew Sita was pregnant, isn't it?) sent Sita to the forest. If in Nilesh speak Ramayana occurred in 12 century BCE/13 century BCE, then Rama was living till atleast1 century BCE, which seems untenable. So (a) we have to accept Nilesh Oak's understanding that the 11,000 years of his rule are not real years as we know, and have to accept Rama lived for 125 years, or (b) that the whole Ramayana happened in another Mahayuga (24th Mahayuga, current one is 28th) hence the timelines we are drawing are not relevant anyway.

  

Which of the ones you and others in the list accept as the possibility? and Why?
