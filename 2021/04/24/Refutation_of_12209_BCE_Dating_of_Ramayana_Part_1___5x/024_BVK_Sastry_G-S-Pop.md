Namaste



Some points to contemplate deeply on the observation :

\< … dating Ramayana/Mahabharata … among other things
makes us recover the basic principles on which Panchanga, or the time measurement framework, rests \> .



This is also answering ‘What is the utility- benefit- intended application ( upa-yoga VINIYOGA) of Ramayana –Mahabahrata studies raised earlier by Dr. Yadu Moharir .



If we don’t understand ‘why date ramayana- Mahabharata through legit approach , we may as well forget about the ‘ 64 Shakti-peethas, 12 Jyotirlinga- places, 108 Divya-kshetra’ related ‘land-divine-heritage connection. And ‘traditional ‘dasha-avataras’ would end up as ‘ Hollywood Avtar’s’! 



Faith cannot be modified by ‘History’ ; Faith does not need ‘Historical evidence’. Faith needs Experiential guidance and Utility Application Practice Road map.

Tradition schools calls this as ‘Guru-shaastra-Yoga-Samskrutha- Samskara – Samskruti- Sampradaya’. This framework also defines ‘How to LEARN-USE-Samskrutham’.



Acharya Madhwa’s classification of ‘Moola-Ramayana, Bharata’ as ‘Shaastra’ on par with ‘ Four Vedas’ is something to contemplate
deeply. 



***What is NOT to be Ramayana Mahabharata related date studies ***



A. Ramayana related debates are not about Scholars fixing any ‘historical human ( intentional or deliberated or overlooked- introduction of numeric error in ‘Panchanga’ by providing anchors to
(precession- recession- ahargana- ayanmasha…..) using ‘ ganita’ ! 

B. The study of ‘Ramayana- Mahabharata’ as ‘Shaastra’ is not for ‘ historic land- identification using archaeo- evidence’ and ‘ satellite provided geo-coordinates’ to get a confirmation of where and when, how - ‘ some historical Rama put his foot print, Hanuman was born and raised, sita took a bath, …’. If this line is to be explored, one needs to be specific which of the Jain ramayana marked ‘ Rama out of some hundreds of Ramas’ is going to be anchored in the investigation.
See ‘Rama in Jain tradiiton’ related studies ! Are we even sure that we are talking of same ‘rama’ and ‘ramayana’ ? Because Ramayana has ‘ shata-koti-pravistram’ versions !? 

C. We, as ‘ Faith and Culture: Identity community simply accept the given ‘Sampradaya’ as a good starting point for Yoga-practice progress, which is much more realistic, relevant than satisfying a curios of ‘ historic Rama’ ! If ‘history – historicity- historic Jesus has not been a limitation for other religion, why should it be a limitation for Rama and Krishna, Siddhas, Yogi’s, Buddha’s, Bodhisatvas and Teerthankaras who go way back in Time line ? 

D. ‘Ramayana’- (Adi Kavi Valmiki Version, as accepted today ; Jain Ramayana’s, Buddhist versions included ) recognize different TIME LINES even when using the ‘BASIC FRAMEWORK OF PANCHANGA/ JYOTISHA / ’.
Modern translations could use several pointing words like Sky mapping, Stellar positions, Eclipse –Memory recollection and retrace as a sky-phenomenon, Confusions between ‘Graha – Ketu- Dhoomaketu- Ulkaa ( and many mid and upper heaven phenomenon described).



***What COULD BE Ramayana Mahabharata related date studies for ( A suggestion for further deliberation) ?***

2. Dating of ‘Ramayana’ is important to give a ‘ Human Heritage Connection’ to the current community and recognize the sanctity-divinity of land and eco system. The essential message of Gita (Vishwaroopa darshana yoga). Rushi’s/ Shaastra-kaaras align this heritage traditional wisdom to the Veda-Yoga-Samskrutham documents using technicalities of
‘Veda- Bhashaa’ to ‘Deva-Bhashaa’ as Cosmic /Aakashic Language and Words, connecting ‘Avatar’ of Supreme Divine giving a discourse- dialogue. 



2a. ( काल-देश -सूत्र – शास्त्र ) A ‘Date’ helps Faith- Pride- Connection to people of land that their present living land is integrally connected to the Divine as ‘Rama-Kshetra, Dharma-Kshetra- Kurukshetra – Punya kshetra, Aryavarta, Yoga-kshetra) 



2b. ( वैदिक- श्रद्धा -सूत्र - शास्त्र) The ‘Samskruth Document’ helps the community to have a re-assurance by Rushi’s-Yogi’s-Devataa authority about the Continued Stability of Universe in its ‘Pada (Vedic word) – Artha (purpose)- Padartha ( Matter)– Kshetra-Kshetrajna- Dharma (Methods- systems-properties of Beings in the Universe = Jeeva Raashi’
guna-karma-varna-swabhaava ) .



\[Rushi’s are the Human achievers –Yogi’s – Sage-Scientists- Discoverers –Formulators –Refiners –Visionaries \] who used Yoga’s to engage

and explore the Cosmos in all its Material and Manifestation modalities as ‘ Brahma / Parama-Purusha / Purushottama Vasudeva/ The

Supreme Divine Consciousness \]



2c. (योग-सूत्र- शास्त्र ) Affirmation that every human being is intrinsically made of same ‘ Prakruti- Purusha’ essence :: Matter- Consciousness –Combine giving each one a ‘ Vishistataa ( uniqueness) and Saadhaaranataa ( Universality). None is barred from entry to the portals of Parama-Purusha and unfold their true inner potential . The essential tune of ‘Shivoham, Soham, Tvamevaham, soham-bhaavena poojayet, deho devalayah proktah..\]. 



2d. (यज्ञ-सूत्र – शास्त्र ) Provide user friendly Yoga- Exploration roadmap from Highest level ‘Veda’ to Socially accessible ‘ Kavya- itihasa- Kathaa’ avatarana using the ‘Shaastra-Sampradaya sadaachaara paddhati. The ‘Veda-Darshana’ becomes ‘ Devataa Vachana’ and Rushi-prokta’ in Ramayana and Mahabharata. 



2e. (संकल्प-संस्कार- संस्कृति -सूत्र -- शास्त्र ) Yoga-Science affirmation presented through Yoga-Rushi-Darshana for community that Divine Intervention takes care of TIME-ORDER-Housekeeping of COSMOS (Gita: 14-27: brahmano hi pratisthaham amrtasyavyayasyacasasvatasyacadharmasyasukhasyaikantikasya ca) in our geo-temporal context marked in samkalpa as \< this ‘Planet-Earth / Manu’s Land Rule and Time ( Manvantara - Jamboo Dweepa- Kali yuga…..
my location of ‘ Rama-Kshetra/ Dandakaranya/ Godaavaryaaha dakshine teere….. where I am performing this action). 



2f. (ब्रह्म-सूत्र – शास्त्र ) A road map to explore Yoga-Science of Consciousness and train skills for Applied yoga –professions of ‘ Puro-Hita ‘ : whose duty and dignity is given as ‘वयं राष्ट्रे जागृयाम - पुरोहिताः ‘ One who serves as a vigilant guard and visionary-guide for
the Welfare of the Nation. In current period, due to maligned ways of ‘Dating Ramayana – Mahabharata’, the duty and dignity of ‘purohita’ is constricted to the level of a ‘ Hindu Priest- Poor Brahmana’.
