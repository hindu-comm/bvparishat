Harim Namami

Vidvadbhyo Namah

  

I am searching for an Acharya who can teach me Advaita Vedanta, I have started with Vedanta Paribhasha myself, but for Panchadashi and Upanishads I require an Acharya.

  

My prior qualifications are = Completed Siddhanta Kaumudi, Tarkasangraha Nyayabodhini, Arthasangraha and Nyayamuktavali (ongoing).

  

I live in Mumbai, but nowadays teaching Online/On normal call, has become a norm, I urge that the Acharyas please respond to my request. I wish to learn even Brahmasutras, Khandana-khanda-khadya and Advaita Siddhi in future. My contact details = 07666932951
