Namaste,

  

 Where to find physical books ofBommala, including Ramayana?

Scans of books in higher quality than at [archive.org](http://archive.org) badly needed, but the only way to do it is to make new, 600 dpi scans of the original, old books. NowadaysBommala comes in color, but I need black and white.
