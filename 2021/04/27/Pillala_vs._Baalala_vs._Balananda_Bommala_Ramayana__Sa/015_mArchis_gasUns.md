Namaste,

  

I'm still looking for the original pictures. A friend of mine scanned a newer book, but the stylistics is not what I was looking for, the faces are non-friendly. Has anyone got BW children books at home? Or even in this covid era access to a children library? Books sold in book stores have lost the fell and touch of the old days I want to retain.Nagaraj Paturi, are you there to help me? I'm totally lost.
