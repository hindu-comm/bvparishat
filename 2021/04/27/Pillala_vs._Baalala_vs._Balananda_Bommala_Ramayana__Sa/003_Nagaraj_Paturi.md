What I call older versions are the ones which we read as children in the 60s and 70s.

  

Publishers I remember are Gollapudi Verraswami etc.

  

They might have been preserved / archived in some libraries physically.

  

Might or might not have been digitized.

  

I am looking for digitized versions.

  

Color drawings/paintings are the new developments.

  

The style of pencil / black line drawings too changed from the older to the newer versions.
