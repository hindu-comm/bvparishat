\> But you do not have sample of books, right?  

  

The sample is right here :

  

The actual scanned pages start from the 6th page in the uploaded file:

  

<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nAzjmyFYb1Ags9BxMmODsU2H6QuDzX7B/view>

  

This is from that 60s 70s period. From Gollapudi Veeraswami people only.

  

Leave the first five colored pages.
