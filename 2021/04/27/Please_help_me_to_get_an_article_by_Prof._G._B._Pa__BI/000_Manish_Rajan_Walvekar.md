नमः सभायै!

  

Please help me to get a soft copy of an article contributed by Prof. G. B. Palsule. The details of the requested article are as follows-

  

Palsule, G. B. 1991. “Panini and the Vedic Verbal System with Special Reference to the Modal Forms.” In*Panels of the VIIth World Sanskrit Conference,*Vol. V: Pāṇini and the Veda edited by Deshpande M. M. Leiden: Brill. pp. 55–64.  

  

I am unable to visit any library due to the current pandemic situation in Maharashtra, India.

  

Thanks in advance.
