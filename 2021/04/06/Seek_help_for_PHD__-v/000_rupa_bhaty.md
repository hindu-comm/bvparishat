Dear Mr. Bijoy Misra ji,

  

Mr. Deepankar Pathak wrote to me onmy blog, "Namaskar Ma'am, I came to know about you and your blog through,--. I am doing research in the early history of the solar system and formation of rocky planets, and the origin of volatiles like water in them. Recently I came across an article in Indiadivine.org website that in our scriptures, the process of formation of Earth and Moon is mentioned in details and also the origin of water. I found it very fascinating, and if I can find the right source, I would like to cite them in my PhD thesis. Can you provide me any help, as to where I can find the source of that information? Dhanyawad, Dipankar Pathak".

  

I thought your goodself could be helpful in guiding Mr. Pathak in this regard. His email id is[dipankar...@gmail.com]()

  

Thank you in advance for the help.

  

Rupa
