### नेतोजी-शुद्धिः #३४५  
  
Event occured on 1676-06-29 (gregorian).(AShADha k4) - Netaji pAlkar ghar-vApasI.  
  
Julian date was converted to Gregorian in this reckoning. After Shivaji's escape from Agra, Aurangzeb, as a revenge, ordered Jai Singh to arrest Netaji Palkar. Netaji Palkar was then converted to Islam. His wives were thereafter brought to Delhi and also converted for him to remarry them in the Islamic way. Taking up the name of Muhammed Kuli Khan, Netaji Palkar was appointed as garrison commander of the Kandahar fort in Afghanistan. He tried to escape but was traced and trapped at Lahore. Thereafter on the battlefields of Kandhar and Kabul, he fought for the Mughals against rebel Pathans. Thus he gained the good faith of Aurangzeb and was sent to the Deccan along with Commander Diler Khan to conquer Shivaji's territory. Here, after 8 years, Netaji joined Shivaji's troops and went to Raigad. He peformed the prAyashchitta-s and made hindu again.
