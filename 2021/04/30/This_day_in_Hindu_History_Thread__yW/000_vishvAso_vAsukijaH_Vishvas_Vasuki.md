With the view of:

-   informing  
-   as well as inviting corrections and contributions to the pertinent
    public repository of events at the xatra-later repository (
    <https://github.com/jyotisham/adyatithi/tree/master/mahApuruSha/xatra-later>
    ) of the [jyotisham
    /adyatithi](https://github.com/jyotisham/adyatithi/)

  

I start this thread of significant events in Hindu History (as I get notified about them by a panchAnga bot on telegram). May the awesome one who played with thunder and bolts magnificently yesterday night and in whose asterism the moon now resides be pleased!
