Hari Om!

Thank you Vishwasji for a note on Hammira.

I have read Nayachandra Suri's work and had presented it a few years back.

When I visited Ranathambore, the history came live through the oral tradition.

There are ballads on his bravery. He fought 17 battles in his reign of 12 years and won 13 of those.

सिंह सवन सत्पुरूष वचन, कदली फलत इक बार।  
तिरया तेल हम्मीर हठ, चढ़े न दूजी बार  

  

  

warm regards
