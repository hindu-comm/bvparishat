Event occured on 1730-09-22 (gregorian). Julian date was converted to Gregorian in this reckoning.

On roughly this day, several biShnoi-s died protecting khejri trees from the king’s men. The king came, apologized and turned the village into a sanctuary.

A royal party led by giridhar bhaNDArI, a minister of the maharajah of Marwar, arrived at Jalnadi village (later known as khejralI) with the intention of felling some Khejri trees that were sacred to the villagers. The trees were to be burned to produce lime for fort (some say palace) construction. A local woman called Amrita Devi protested against the tree-felling because such acts were prohibited by the vishnoi’s religion. The royal party said that they would only cease if she paid them a bribe, which she refused. She said that she would rather give away her life to save the trees. She and her three daughters (Asu, Ratni and Bhagu) were then killed by the party.

News of the deaths spread and summons to a meeting were sent to 84 Bishnoi villages. The meeting determined that one Bishnoi volunteer would sacrifice their life for every tree that was cut down. Older people began hugging the trees that were intended to be cut and many were killed. They said: ‘A chopped head is cheaper than a felled tree’ (“सिर साटै रूँख रहे - तो भी सस्तो जाँण”). Bhandari claimed that the Bishnois were sacrificing ageing people whom they no longer saw as useful to society. In response to this, young men, women and children began to follow the example of the old. 363 Bishnois (294 men & 69 women) died in the incident.

#### Aftermath

The shocked tree-felling party left for Jodhpur with their mission unfulfilled. When the Maharaja Abhai Singh of Marwar heard about this, he was filled with remorse and came to the village to personally apologize to the people. He promised them that they would never again be asked to provide timber to the ruler, no khejri tree would ever be cut, and hunting would be banned near the Bishnoi villages. The proclamation, in a tAmra-patra, is displayed in a memorial.

Later, memorials were erected in memory of the martyrs - including a cenotaph, Khejarli Shahid Sthal, Jambheshwar sathari, aka amrita Devi vishnoismariti vatika. Every year fair is take place on bhAdrapada-shukla-dashamI. To remember their sacrifice, the government declared September 11 as National Forest Martyrs’ Day.

The Khejarli story inspired another environmental movement—the Chipko Andolan (1973) in the Tehri-Garhwal Himalaya. This, in turn, spawned the Jungle Bachao Andolan (1982) in Bihar and Jharkhand, the Appiko Chaluvali (1983) in the Western Ghats of Karnataka, and other similar protests. The ‘tree-hugging’ tactic of the Chipko Andolan and its messages gained popularity in many countries beyond India’s borders, leading to protests in Switzerland, Japan, Malaysia, The Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand.
