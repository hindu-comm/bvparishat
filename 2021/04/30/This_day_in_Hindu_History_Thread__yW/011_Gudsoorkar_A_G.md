I am extremely thankful to you Shri Vishwasji for providing authentic information on “Hindu History”. Many important incidents which we even do not know are being revealed to us. Many Thanks indeed.

  

If possible, pl give me a brief chronology of the Maratha history starting from ShahajiRaje to Fall of Peshawas in 1818.
