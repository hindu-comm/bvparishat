Event occured on 1948-09-12 (gregorian).

On this day, Radha Binod Pal, a Judge from India at the Tokyo war crime trials, declared the defendants not guilty - dissenting from other judges from around the world. Thus, he earned heartfelt gratitude of Japanese people, expressed in various honors (roads named after him, statues at the shrine and court, the highest civilian honor of the country, ‘Kokko Kunsao’ from the Emperor Hirohito).

With is 1232 page note to the rest of the jurists he convinsingly argued that the Allies, (winners of WWII) also violated the principles of restraint and neutrality. In addition to ignoring Japan’s surrender hints, they killed two hundred thousand innocent people using nuclear bombardment. The judges were forced to drop many of the accused from Class-A to B.
