### शिवराजो रामसिंहेन रक्षितः #३५५

Up↑

Event occured on 1666-05-24 (gregorian). Julian date was converted to Gregorian in this reckoning. Those like begam jahAn-ara, javar khAn and jaswant singh kept egging awrangzeb after shivAjI had angrily left awrangzeb’s darbaar. Awrangzeb ordered siddi fulAd to take shivAjI to Rad-andaz Khan’s mansion. rAmasiMha, son of jayasiMha, heard of it. He at once rushed to Muhammad Amin Khan’s house and interceded with him saying: “The Emperor is thinking of killing Shivaji. But he has come here under a solemn assurance of safe conduct (kaul). So it is proper that the Emperor should first kill me, summon my son and kill him and only then kill Shivaji.” So Muhammad Amin Khan went to the Emperor and reported Ram Singh’s words. Whereupon the Emperor said: “Tell Ram Singh to stand surety for Shivaji. If Shivaji escapes or does any mischief Ram Singh will be responsible. Let Ram Singh give a security bond in writing.” When Muhammad Amin Khan returned and narrated this to Ram Singh, he agreed to give a security bond.

He returned to his camp and briefed Shivaji in the night of 14th May 1666. Shivaji came to Ram Singh the following morning, performed worship (puja) of Shiva there and gave his solemn assurance. Then Ram Singh wrote the security bond and gave it to Muhammad Amin Khan that afternoon in the antechamber ghuslkhana). When the Khan reported this to the Emperor he took the bond and ordered: “Tell Ram Singh to take Shivaji to Kabul. Find an auspicious day to begin the journey.” Luckily, shivAjI visited and bribed Javar khAn to get pardoned for his “offences” and get that order cancelled.
