### कर्णपुर-जयः #१६४  
  
Event occured on 1857-06-25 (gregorian). As the British forces surrendered on 25 June 1857, Nana was declared Peshwa in late June.  
  
On June 27, the british making their way on gangA at Satichaura Ghat were killed or captured (it's unclear who fired teh first shot). Around 120 women and children were taken prisoner and eventually moved to Bibighar; later more were added.  
  
Using them for bargaining failed - and eventually, they were massacred on July 15 despite protestations (including hunger strike) of nAnA-saheb's family, and hesitency / refusal of the soldiers -partly in anger at reports of violence by British against villagers. Finally, owner of the place, begum hussaini khAnum, a harlot, hired butchers to finish them off with cleavers. The British extracted their terrible vengence later.  

  

### मणि-राम-मारणम् #२८३  
  
Event occured on 1738-06-25 (gregorian). Julian date was converted to Gregorian in this reckoning. maNi-rAm, aka bhAi maNi singh, a fine scholar and warrior, shiShya of the last 4 sikh gurus + bandA vairAgI, aged 94, was dismembered limb by limb.  
  
Reason: Governor of Lahore, Zakaria Khan, expected Rs 5k in return for permission to celebrate divAlI at harmandir. But, knowing that he intended a slaughter (in collusion with divAn lakhpat rAi), the sikhs did not turn up - so maNi could not pay the money.
