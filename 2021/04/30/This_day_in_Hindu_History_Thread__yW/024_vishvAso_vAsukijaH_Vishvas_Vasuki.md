Lieutenant Manoj Kumar Pandey, a young officer of the 1/11 Gorkha Rifles, died conquering Jubar Top from pAkistAni jihAdists on this day.

  
On the night of 2/3 July 1999, 'B' Company of 1/11 Gorkha Rifles approached Jubar top along a narrow ridge. He surged ahead of his troops and charged at the enemy with a full-throated battle cry (जय महाकाली! आयो गारखाली!) through a hail of bullets. Fearlessly assaulting the first enemy position, he killed two enemy personnel and destroyed the second position by killing two more. Although wounded in the shoulder and leg, he pressed on his solitary charge with grim determination, until he closed in on the first bunker. He continued to lead the assault on the fourth position urging his men and destroyed the same with a grenade, even as he got a fatal Medium Machine Gun burst on his forehead.  
  
Entries in Pandey's personal diary:  
  
- "If death strikes before I prove my blood, I promise (swear), I will kill death!"  
- "Some goals are so worthy, it's glorious even to fail!"
