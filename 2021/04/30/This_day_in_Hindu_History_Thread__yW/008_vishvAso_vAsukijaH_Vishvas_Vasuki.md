### मुरार्-बाजी-वीर-गतिः #३५६

  

Event occured on 1665-05-26 (gregorian). Julian date was converted to Gregorian in this reckoning. Mogols under Jai Singh, assisted by the paThAn Dilir Khan (with nephews Ghairat and Muzaffar), had beseiged closely situated purandara and rudramal forts. H mansabdArs of mogols like kirAta-simha, haribhAn kunwar, udaybhAn, chaturbhuj chauhAN, mitrasen, indraman bundela assisted. Daud Khan and Qutb ud Din khAn had also joined. With huge cannons named ‘Abdulla Khan’, ‘Fath Lashkar’ and ‘havelI’ taken up opposite summits, the beseigers had downed rudramal. Mogols mined and bombarded safed-burj and kAlA burj - the undermining of which would lead to capture of the lower fort.

Taking 700 select men murAr bAjI prabhu sallied out in a desperate melee and attacked dilIr khAn. 500 paThAns died as did 300 marAThas. murAr and few desperados dashed right up to dilIr khAn’s position. Refusing generous surrender promises, he ran up to dilIr khAn sword in hand. dilIr downed him with an arrow. The rest ran back to the fort. (sabhAsad chronicle.)
