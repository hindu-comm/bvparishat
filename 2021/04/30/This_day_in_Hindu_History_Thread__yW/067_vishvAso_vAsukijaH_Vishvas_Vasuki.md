### अक्षरधाम-हत्या #१९

Up↑

  
  

Event occured on 2002-09-24 (gregorian).

On 24 September 2002 (4:45 pm), Murtaza Hafiz Yasin and Ashraf Ali Mohammad Farooq attacked the Swaminarayan Akshardham complex at Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India. They killed 30 people and injured more than 80. This was shortly after the Godhra burning of Hindu pilgrims and the subsequent riots. A priest recalled “a mother begging for the lives of her children-later identified as Priya and Bhailu Chauhan, aged three and four. The woman, Sumitra, had been running with her little boy and girl when she was felled by a bullet in the leg. The killer nodded to her pleas, then turned his gun towards the children and, to the horror of the mother, mowed them down.”

At 4:48 pm, three minutes after the attack began, Vishwavihari Swami, at the Akshardham Temple Complex, made an SOS call to Chief Minister Narendra Modi’s office and informed them about the attack. By 5:15 pm, Chief Minister of Gujarat Narendra Modi called the Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani in Delhi and asked for the National Security Guards (NSG). At 10:10 pm, two buses of NSG commandos and one bus filled with NSG equipment arrived at Akshardham. By approximately 11:30 pm, after reviewing multiple strategies, 35 Black Cat commandos positioned themselves throughout the Akshardham Temple Complex in an effort to find the terrorists. At approximately 6:45 am, the 14-hour-long ordeal ended with the Black Cat Commandos shooting the two terrorists hiding in the bushes. During this overnight search for the attackers, one state police officer and one commando lost their lives. Another commando, Surjan Singh Bhandari, was seriously injured and died in May 2004, after being in coma for two years.

#### Aftermath

The head of BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha which manages the temple, Pramukh Swami Maharaj, successfully appealed to maintain peace. Gujarat police later arrested several people, who were sentenced in 2006, but were acquitted in the Supreme Court in 2014.
