A friend of mine today asked me what the English and Hindi equivalents are of the Malayalam expression “aṟam paṯṯi” (അറം പറ്റി அறம் பற்றி) meaning “aṟam happened”. Here the expression means one’s words boomeranged as a curse on oneself. Let us say a guy said jokingly that if he died that day, he would go to heaven because he did a good deed by loaning some money to his friend. That same day the guy dies in an accident. Then people say “aṟam paṯṯi”. His joking words of himself dying came back as a curse for himself.

  

There may not be an apt and concise English translation but somehow, I feel that there should be Sanskrit and other Indian language expressions equivalent to this Malayalam expression.
