Dear all,

  

This is my latest research work on a less trodden topic. The paper not only examines 'Kāma' as a Purushartha, but argues that Kāma is the Primary as well as the Parama (highest) Purushartha. Towards this end, the paper draws upon texts like Kamasutra, Mahabharata, etc., as well as informed opinions of Pandava Bhima, Raja Bhoja, and Madhusudana Saraswati, among others.

  

Abstract:

Kāma is counted among the four puruṣārthas or goals of life conceived in Hindu philosophy. Literally Kāma means ‘desire’ or ‘wish’. Though, Kāma is an extremely well-researched topic, especially in the context of Kāmasūtra, there has been little attention paid towards understanding Kāma as a puruṣārtha. This paper seeks to investigate this –how Kāma as a Puruṣārtha has been conceptualized in Hindu philosophy.

  

Do read and share your feedback.
