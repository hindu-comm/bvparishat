Namaskars,

Is there any compilation of the Vedic rishi-s, the persons who aresaid to be the

मन्त्र-द्रष्टारः of various mantra-s in the Vedas?

My idea is to see how many of them are also the composers of the dharma shastra-s. We have around forty dharma-shastra-s composed by various sages at various points of time at various places.
