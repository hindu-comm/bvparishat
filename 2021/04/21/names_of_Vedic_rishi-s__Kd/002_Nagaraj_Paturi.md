This page gives a list of 161 names and says,

  

"Above are the Ancient Vedic Rishis who composed or scripted the Rg-Veda mantra. The names of other**Rishis & Rishikas**, though not necessarily the composers of Rg Vedic scripts are given in alphabetically given[**in this page.**](https://www.trsiyengar.com/id282.shtml) (It is still possible that some more names might be there in the Puranas and still there can be some omissions. If anyone brings the names of other Rishis too, I shall gladly add it to this list)"
