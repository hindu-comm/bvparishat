*'Gṛhastha' in 'A New History of Dharmaśāstra': A critical analysis in view of its newly professed significance for the early chronology of the Dharmaśāstra-s*  

  

<https://www.academia.edu/45684996/G%E1%B9%9Bhastha_in_A_New_History_of_Dharma%C5%9B%C4%81stra_A_critical_analysis_in_view_of_its_newly_professed_significance_for_the_early_chronology_of_the_Dharma%C5%9B%C4%81stra_s>  

  

**Abstract**: Does the earliest attestation of the term गृहस्थ (*gṛhastha*), in Sanskrit, date back only to around the third century BCE? Is it the case that the term *gṛhastha* is absent, in Sanskrit, prior to the earliest धर्मसूत्र (*dharmasūtra*)? How sound is the hypothesis that *gṛhastha* was a neologism in Sanskrit and that it underpinned the very necessity for the creation of the *Dharmaśāstric* genre of literature? Near-affirmative answers to all the above questions, with hence profound revisionist implications for the early chronology of *Dharmasūtra*-s and *Dharmaśāstra*-s, are found in recent essays by Patrick Olivelle and Stephanie Jamison in the books *Hindu Law: A New History of Dharmaśāstra* (2018) and *Gṛhastha: The HouseHolder in Ancient Indian Religious Culture* (2019), both published by Oxford University Press. In this paper, I foreground some of those statements, from these books, that constitute answers to the questions above, engage critically with them, and in doing so, put forth evidence that problematizes the revisionist implications of those statements vis-a-vis the early chronology of *Dharmasūtra*-s and *Dharmaśāstra*-s.
