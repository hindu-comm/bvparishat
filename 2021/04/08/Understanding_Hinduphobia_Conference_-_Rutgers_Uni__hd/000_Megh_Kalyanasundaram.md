"Understanding Hinduphobia is a first-of-its-kind virtual gathering that brings Hindu scholars and thoughtful community activists into conversation with students, educators, administrators, and allies to learn about and unpack the history, patterns, manifestations, and impact of Hinduphobia today. The conference aims to introduce participants to critical aspects of global and historical Hinduphobia; to understand the definition of Hinduphobia; and finally, to suggest how institutions can uphold this definition and what happens when they don't. Organized by the Rutgers chapter of the Hindu Students Council with co-sponsorship from the Rutgers University Student Assembly--- the University's undergraduate student government, the conference will include interactive webinars, panels, and discussion groups, along with a multimedia web gallery of resources."
