Exploring the Bhagavad Gita: Philosophy, Structure, and Meaning

  

Abstract: The Bhagavad Gita is a unique literary creation but deciphering its meaning and philosophy is not easy or straightforward. This careful study of the Bhagavad Gita approaches the ancient text with a modern mind and offers a unifying structure of universal relevance. Combining the philosophical-theoretical with the ethical-practical, Ithamar Theodor locates his study within comparative theology and identifies the various layers of meaning. The Bhagavad Gita's full text is presented in a new translation, divided into sections, and accompanied by an in-depth commentary. This book makes the Bhagavad Gita accessible to a wide variety of readers, helping to make sense of this tremendous spiritual classic, which is one of the most important texts of religious Hinduism.

  

Bio: Ithamar Theodor is Associate Professor of Hindu studies at Zefat Academic College, Safed, Israel, a graduate of the Theology Faculty, University of Oxford, and a Life Member of Clare Hall, University of Cambridge. His publications include Exploring the Bhagavad Gıta: Philosophy, Structure, and Meaning (2010), Brahman and Dao: Comparative Studies in Indian and Chinese Philosophy and Religion (2014), The Fifth Veda in Hinduism: Philosophy, Poetry, and Devotion in the Bhagavata Purana (2016), Dharma and Halacha: Comparative Studies in Hindu and Jewish Philosophy and Religion (2018) and The Bhagavad-gita: A Critical Introduction (2021).
