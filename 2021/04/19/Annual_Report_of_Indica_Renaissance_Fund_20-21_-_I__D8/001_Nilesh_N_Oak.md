Thank you, HKV Ji. Thank you for everything you do, every day.  
  
The annual report states:  
  
"If we are unable to make a meaningful contribution to a particular cause, we try and make sure that at least some part of the funds needed is provided as a seed contribution, for the grantee to then showcase our contribution and raise the money required from other donors. We have noticed that an imprimatur of our involvement often acts as the necessary credibility check and facilitates the grantees in raising money from others."  
--  
This is indeed the key and the crux of this effort. I and my co-researchers and co-Dharma warriors have immensely benefitted from this specific scheme and allied aspects mentioned above. To the extent,
in one such project, the contributions came pouring in and the collection went above our desired amount; and I had to make specific efforts conveying to individual contributors to stop from making additional contributions.  
  
If folks see and sense the sincerity, Tapasya, and integrity, they do come forward.  
  
The next exciting front a few of us are working on is along the lines of Vishwa-Vidyalaya, along the lines of Ekala-Vidyalaya.  
  
Thank you again.  
  
Shivoham! Shivoham!
