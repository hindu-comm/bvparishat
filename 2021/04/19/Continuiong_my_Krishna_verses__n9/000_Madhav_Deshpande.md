Continuing my Krishna verses

  

त्वंपूर्वेषामपि गुरु: कृष्ण पार्थोपदेशकृत् ।

त्वं कालेनानवच्छेदाद्गुरूणां परमो गुरु: ।।१४४१।।

\[Cf. Yogasūtra: स पूर्वेषामपि गुरु: कालेनानवच्छेदात्\]

  

Krishna, the advisor of Arjuna, you are the teacher of allprevious teachers. Since you have no limitation of time, you are the ultimate teacher of teachers.
