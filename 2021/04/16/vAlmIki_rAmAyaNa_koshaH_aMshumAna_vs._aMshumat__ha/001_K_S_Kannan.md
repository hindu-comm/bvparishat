The problem is simple.

  

Indians are used to making use of the Nominative Singular form regularly

in the context of speaking in Indian languages.  

(And the same gets carried over to English also : too few Indians  

would say Hanu(ū)mat (the base), in place of Hanu(ū)mān (Nom. Sing. form)

while narrating the *Rāmāyaṇa* in English).  

  

Western scholars consistently use the Base (=*Prātipadika*) form.

  

Hope this helps.
