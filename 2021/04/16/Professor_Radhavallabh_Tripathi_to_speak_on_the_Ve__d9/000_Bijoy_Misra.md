Dear friends,

  

On behalf of India Discovery Center we initiated an Outreach Lecture series

to present technical knowledge material to the professional international  

audience. I gave the first lecture in February. Professor Radhavallabh  

Tripathi from Bhopal is scheduled to offer Lecture II and III on Indian Music

next week Saturday and Sunday, April 24 and 25. The lectures are virtual.

A link will be provided on April 22. The formal public announcement went  

out today.

We prepare a set of slides to be distributed worldwide to Universities,

Schools, Libraries and Museums.. Gradually we will go to theater, dance,  

architecture, literature, Languages design, pottery, textiles etc. We plan  

to schedule every two months.  

  

We have set a registration fee of $10 ($15 for both) to raise a small  

honorarium for the speaker. You can write to me privately if you have  

deep interest and wish that the fees be waived. We will try to accommodate.  

The registration link is in the article above.  

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
