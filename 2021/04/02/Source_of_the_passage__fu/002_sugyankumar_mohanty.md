Thank you Acharya Shankara ji, for your kind attention towards my query and a prompt resolution along with the link also. I shall remain ever grateful to you and also one of my best friend Mr. Meghakalyanasundaram who had also suggested me the answer earlier today personally.

  

Once again I express my sincere gratitude to both of you.

  

Regards,

Sugyan Kumar Mahanty
