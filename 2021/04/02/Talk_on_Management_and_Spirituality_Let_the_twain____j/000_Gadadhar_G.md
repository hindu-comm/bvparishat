Spirituality and ethics are core values that have shaped human life from time immemorial. However, as societies and their institutions progress and go through ebbs and flows, so does the relevance of such core values. Currently business entities are going through challenging times.  
  

Management and Spirituality are never considered related in anyways, as per our current thinking. The question that begs some attention is “How valid is this assumption?”. The motivation for exploring the role of spirituality in business is the repeated occurrence of events in recent business history that challenges the moral and ethical fabrics of leadership. Moreover, unprecedented events such as the post-pandemic challenges that we are currentlygoing through also has brought this issue to limelight. This talk will provide a bird’s eye view of the interconnectedness between spirituality and management and provide alternative perspectives on these issues from the Indian spiritual tradition.
