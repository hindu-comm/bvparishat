Friends,

I am back on the Ramayana project. Today I saw Valmiki's description of the equatorial areas (southern oceans). सर्ग 23 in युद्धकाण्ड (Gita press edition). I could guess his botany earlier possibly through his own travels or Sushruta's literature. But southern oceans are different.  

Do people know of any other reference to southern oceans: heat, haloes, wind among them?

I appreciate help or any pointer.

Regards,

Bijoy Misra
