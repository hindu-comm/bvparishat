I had posted this verse earlier, but here it is with a translation

  

आधाय वर्णान् धनुषिस्वकीये

क्षिपन् मुदा नन्दनवाटिकासु ।

दिवीन्द्रराज: सहित: स्वपत्न्या

करोति केलिं खलु होलिकायाम् ।।

  

Indra, the king of gods, places colors on his bow and throws them happily in the groves of the garden of bliss, and with his wife he engages in the play of Holi in heaven.
