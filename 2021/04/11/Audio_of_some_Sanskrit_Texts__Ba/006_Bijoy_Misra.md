Kannansaheb,  

Excellent. Loved it. I was not exposed to the Ramanuja literature till twenty years ago when  

a whole lot of IT professionals brought Ramanuja to the Temple. They were a cult, operated

as a cult. I heard the sonorous Raghuviragadya for the first time and was mesmerized.

Gradually i am reinforcing the view that the whole poetic composition appears as a melody  

in the mind and words flow through the melody. How the melody appears in the brain is  

a good question. Melody forms deeper in the brain and takes time to engage the local memory.  

This is for creative composition. Modern poets try to create word play with the known theme  

and that operates in the local memory. I was in the Temple yesterday and the Ramanuja group  

showed up. With family as tails the scene was different. The children alo seem to have been

inducted! India - the wonder land of culture..
