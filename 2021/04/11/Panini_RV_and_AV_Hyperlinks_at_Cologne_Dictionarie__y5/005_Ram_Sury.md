Dear Marcis,

  

I was looking at the Apte Dictionary at <https://sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/simple/> for the entry मौर्यः and it contains मौर्यौर्हिरण्यार्थिभिरर्चाः प्रकल्पिताः which should rather be मौर्यैः rather than मौर्यौः - seems to be an OCR error.

  

Thanks,  
Ramakrishnan Suryanarayanan
