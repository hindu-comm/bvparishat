Shri Krishna Kumar Pillalamarriji,

Shri Krishnaya Namah!

\<It would be great idea to see you argue with Shri Nilesh Oak and Miss Rupa Bhaty on the archaeo-astronomy discussion that is currently taking place here.>

Thank you for your suggestion.

But then I just don't know as to what is there to be argued about!

***Mahabharata war:***

Almost every scholar is "proving" or "has already proved" the "most exact" date of the Mahabharata war right from about 5561 BCE to 900 BCE!

And all of them are "arguing" on the basis of JPL/NASA DE431 and so on either directly or indirectly!

Obviously, not all these dates of the "mother of all battles" can be correct though all of them may be wrong!

So what have I to argue about and with whom!

As an alternative, since it is "impossible" that all these scholars can be wrong, there is every possibility that all of them are right!

That means there has been a "Mahabharata war" every few centuries and all of them have been discussed in detail by Krishna Dvaipayana Vedavyasa in his "*Shata-saahasriya-Samhitaa''*!

That again means that there is nothing to be argued about by me!

***Rama-Ravana Yuddha:***

Similarly, there is another "fierce battle" going on about the date of Rama-Ravana-Yuddha!

It is supposed to have taken place anywhere between 12200 BCE and 4000 BCE---though Aadi Kavi Valmiki has claimed in the beginning and the end of the VR that Bhagwan Ram had ruled for 11000 years and later it was confirmed by Krishnadwaipayana Veda-vyasa in his "Mahabharata"!

Obviously, again. that"confirmation" in the Mbh too must have happened after about 900000 years of the Valmiki Ramayana and even after the Rama-Ravana-Yuddha was over!! (Three attachmentsRamarajya-VRI, VRII and the Mbh-Kum)!!

So just possible that all those scholars are wrong or again, as an alternative, may be all of them are right!

That means there is nothing for me toargueabout in that case as well!

But then a redoubtable scholar Shri Vinay Jha says that the "Ram-Ravana" war had really taken place in the fag end of Treta-yuga.

And Shri Jha has "proved" it in his book "Itihas ka Upahas" that Tretayug was really around 900000 years back!

(Anybody can download that book from[इतिहास का उपहास](http://vedicastrology.wdfiles.com/local--files/mockery-of-history%3Ahoroscope-of-lord-ram/Itihas%20ka%20Upahas.pdf))

That could also mean that Ram-Ravana-Yuddha has been taking place every few thousand years!

Again, thus, there is nothing for me to argue about the same either!

***Surya Siddhanta updation etc. etc.:***

Same is the case about the Surya Siddhanta!

It claims in the very first chapter to be a work of the fag end of Krita Yuga which was around about two million years back as per the same "divine" work!

After all, Maya-Mahasura, the father-in-law of the world-famous Rakshasa king Ravana, who is the "narrator" of such a great work, viz. theSS
could not tell a lie, especially since his son-in-law Ravana is supposed to have compiled a "masterpiece" of "Vedic astrology" viz. Ravana Samhita!

If some scholars claimthat theSS was "updated" every few thousand years and the last but one updating was done in 12000 BCE and then 2900 BCE how can a small fry like me argue about all these "ultimate truths"!

So, in a nutshell, for me there is nothing to argue about the SS either!

***The tail piece!***

The tail piece, however, is that an out and out Agnostic----maybe even an "Atheist" like the well known Cosmologist Stephen Hawking, who does not have any soft corner for the Biblical dictum that "god created the world in 4004 bce" either, cried from housetops "Homo Sapiens
originated in sub-Saharan Africa around 200000 BC."

He also claims in the same breath, "Written language dates back only to about 7000 BC, the productof societies centred around the cultivation of grain."

Stephen Hawking has said further, in a very serious note!, "(Some of the oldest written inscriptions concern the daily ration of beer allowed to each citizen)". ----Even the brackets of this statement are by Setephen Hawking himself and not mine! (Attachment -the age of Homo-Sapiens--Hawking" which is a page from Hawking's last work "The Grand Design".i

***The most ironical part of this entire mail!***

The most ironical part is that I cannot argue about even such "hard to digest" but unassailable "cosmological" or "geographical" facts either!  

And, in spite of all the above "arguments",

With regards and Shri Krishnaya Namah!

A K Kaul
