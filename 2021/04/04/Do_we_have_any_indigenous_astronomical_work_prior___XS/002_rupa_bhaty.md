Thank you Krishna Kumar ji,

  

I am aware of Shri Kaul's works.

  

1\. I can only argue if I am presented with the particular words **uttarāyaṇa** and **dakṣiṇayana**, since I know when they came into being and that itself is a long thread. Both these words are clearly absent In Rg and Yajur VJ. **Uddagatau anddakṣiṇeti** primarily means **north and south of equator. (see attachments)**

2\. What is concluded by gharmavṛddhī? In Bangla we say **Ghaam for sweat. Can this be experiencedon WS day? No, it can only be experiencedwhen the sun has reached northern hemisphere.**

3\. Why Maaghashuklaprapannasya- paushakrishnasampinaH verse comes **in between Vishuva verses**, and why there are no verses with solstices which calculate the days. The base argument will remain of Naadi yantra, but that can work for both, i.e., equinox to equinox or solstice to solstice, for any 6 months,**but only if** **Solstices are present in VJ, then only they will work for solstices to solstices**.

4\. VJ is a text of Vedas itself. Therefore, Samvatsara (samvatsara vai agni-vaishvanara T. Br), and (Samvatsara vai prajaapati, all Brahmanas) Prajaapati are related to Agni-Gharma-Vasanta.

  

If I have to argue on each verse then that will culminate into a book. Right now I am already engaged in writing two books and blogs with every day new discoveries. Please deem this as the last mail.

  

So I will leave it to all here at this parishad to have **manthan**. Again I will request **not to read any commentaries or english translations.**(I am very specific with words and their meanings)

  

Best wishes and regards to all.

  

Rupa
