Respected members of Bharatiya Vidvat Parishad,

Jai Shri Ram!

I have been trying for quite some time now----for the last at least thirty years!----to "locate" an indigenous astronomical work through which we are supposed to have calculated planetary positions at least vis-a-vis nakshatras---since it is common knowledge now that Mesha etc. Rashis are not of Indian origin but came from "outside" in the early centuries of CE!

Even those Rashis were tropical but "after making an Ayanamsha Samskara" they were converted to nirayana---that too very late in the day --maybe in around sixteenth century with the advent of Graha Laghava and Makaranda---and that too much against the injunctions of all the Puranas and siddhantas!

But then that is an entirely different story!

***VJ gives only mean longitudes of the sun and the moon!***

As far as the VJ goes, it is undoubtedly a work of about 15th century BCE---since the Winter Solstice was then in the beginning of "Dhanishtha"---Alpha/Beta Delphini---division and the Summer Solstice in the "midst" of "Ashlesha" ---Epsilon Hydrae/Alpha Cancri---division which visia-vis the "Fixed stars" of these nakshatras as per the Surya Siddhanta!

Such "conjunctions" were possible only when the nakshatra division as per the same VJ started from Krittika---Alcyone division--, most probably since the "Vernal Equinox" was in that division then! (Attachment VJ stars).

The VJ give yields the mean longitudes of the sun and the moon and tells us just the methodology of calculating mean thithi, mean nakshatra of the moon and the sun, the lunar months, seasons, Ayanas, solar years and thereby five-year yugas.

The results of those calculations do not compare at all favourably even with the mean longitudes of the sun and the moon as per modern astronomy, which means they cannot at all yield even true much less apparent longitudes or tithi, nakshatra etc.

***VJ appears to be unaware of Mangal, Shani etc. planets***

The VJ does not touch the topic of any other planets like Mercury or Venus, much less the much dreaded Mangal, Shani and the most dreaded "Kalasarpa-karaka" mathematical points viz. Rahu and Kethu---even by a long pole---most probably because they were unknown in India then!

***The VJ is no mean achievement!***

I must put on record here that according to me it was really a Herculean job--even to calculate the mean tithi etc. on the banks of "Maha-Padmasar" (Wular Lake) more than 3500 years back in extremely hostile climate when about a meter long icicles hang from trees during the Winter season there!

It was thus really no mean achievement!

***The astronomy of the epics and Puranas vis-a-vis the VJ***

Why I am asking these questions is because I have gone through both the epics and almost all the Puranas from cover to cover.

The Mahabharata talks about a lot of planetary combinations vis-a-vis nakshatras, about eclipses of thirteen days, about adhika-masa vis-a-vis the *Ajnyata vasa* अज्ञात वासof the Pandavas and so on!

Similarly, the Valmiki Ramayana has given almost all the planetary details about the horoscope of Bhagwan Ram, Who is supposed to have ruled for at least 11000 years, and also adverse planetary transits to the "birth nakshatra" of king Dasharatha who is supposed to have ruled for sixty-four thousand years.

When compared to all this information in the epics, the VJ was unable to calculate even the day of Winter Solstice properly, as otherwise it would not have given the duration of a seasonal year from WS to WS as 366 days instead of about 365.25 days.

***There is a vacuum for at least 1500 years in indigenous astronomy even after the VJ***

I do not find any rosy picture even after the VJ since there is no "indigenous" astronomical work worth the name till the advent of the Surya Siddhanta! And that work also leaves much to be desired since it claims to be a work of a couple of million years old but is actually of early centuries of the CE!

To crown it all, though we are supposed to get tropical longitudes of the planets from the same, but the results it yields are neither tropical nor sidereal---but just absolutely wrong, which some people call "nirayana" whereas I find them to be *niraadhaar!* (Attachment SS-Kali-zero-planets)

I must clarify here it further that it is absolutely no reflection on any work or anybody, but just an expression of my unease since I have been searching for an indigenous "astronomical masterpiece" which would compare favourably with the DE431 of JPL/NASA since while trying to "calculate" the dates of the Mahabharata war or Rama -Ravana Yuddha, most of the scholars arrive at their desired dates only though that ephemeris---the latest one from JPL/NASA!

For ready reference, a copy of the VJ with the commentary by Dr. K V Sarma is attached.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!
