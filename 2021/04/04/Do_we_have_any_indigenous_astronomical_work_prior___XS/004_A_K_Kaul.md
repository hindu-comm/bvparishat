Sushri Rupa Bhaty ji,  

Jai Shri Ram!

\<**uttarāyaṇa** and **dakṣiṇayana**, since I know when they came into being and that itself is a long thread. Both these words are clearly absent In Rg and Yajur VJ. **Uddagatau anddakṣiṇeti** primarily means **north and south of equator. (see attachments)>**

 The actual mantra is घर्म वृद्धिरपां प्रस्थः क्षपा ह्रास उदग्गतौ \|\| दक्षिनेतौ विपर्यस्तौ षन्मुहुर्त्यय्नेन् तु **  
**

उदग्गतौ has been defined as "half year from the Winter to the Summer Solstice and "दक्षिणेति as दक्षिणायन as the sun's progress through south of equator" in the attachment that you enclosed. Thus the words ''Uttarayana and Dakshinayana" are very much there in the Rik and Yajusha Jyotisham even if in the form of Udag-gatau and Dakshineti!

For further ready reference, a few pages from *Yajusha-Jyotisham,* together with a Sanskrti commentary by Somakar---with a gloss by Sudhakar Dwivedi, the well known Samskrit scholar from Varanasi, are attached. Both Somakar and Dwivedi have translated Udagayanam as Uttarayanam and Dakshineti as Dakshinaayana.  

*" षडुद*ङ्ङ्ेति "***means six months of Uttarayana as per the Vedic lore also!***

The attachment "Chhandogya Upanishad-udanneti" are excerpts from the Chhandogya Upanishad, where "udag-eti" has been referred to as the Uttarayana. The well known Aadi Shankara has specifically indicated it as उत्तराम् दिशमेति सविता ...उत्तरायण देवतां

\<**Ghaam for sweat. Can this be experiencedon WS day? No, it can only be experiencedwhen the sun has reached northern hemisphere.>**

As per the attachment "VJ-gharma=day-kshapa=night" Both Somakar and Sudhakar Dwivedi have translated"gharmavriddhir" as "घर्म इति अहर्नाम" and "क्षपा इति शर्वरी ". It has been clarified further that तदा प्रभृति दिनानि वर्धन्ते रात्रिश्चापचीयते which means Winter Solstice being the shortest day of the year, the day goes on increasing from there and nights decreasing!

Yes, the days really start increasing from the day of WS (in spite of your reservations!) even if just by a second of time (which would mean two and a half pal पल in olden days).

This will be clear from the two attachments "sunrise-sunset-dinmaan-for-Delhi" and "sunrise-sunset-dinmaan-for-Greenwich" that whether it was on the WS day of 2020 or whether it is going to be the WS day of 2021, the day did and will increase even if by just a second of time for Delhi but 4 seconds for Greenwich on that date! So Acharya Lagadha was very right when he had said घर्म वृद्धिः .

Similarly, his statement दक्षिनेतौ विपर्यस्तौ is also correct as will be clear from the same attachments that from June 21, 2020, the "dinmaan" did decrease by 2 seconds in Delhi and by about five seconds for Greenwich!

\<3. Why Maaghashuklaprapannasya- paushakrishnasampinaH verse comes **in between Vishuva verses**, and why there are no verses with solstices which calculate the days. The base argument will remain of Naadi yantra, but that can work for both, i.e., equinox to equinox or solstice to solstice, for any 6 months,**but only if** **Solstices are present in VJ, then only they will work for solstices to solstices**.>

As clarified above, both the Solstices are very much present in the VJ and in fact, the five year Yuga of the VJ starts from the Winter Solstice and ends at fifth Winter Solstice. Similarly, each solar year of the VJ ranges from one Winter Solstice to another, as will be clear from the attachment "VJ-year-WS-to WS" calculated by the one and only S B Dikshit in his Bharatiya Jyotisha Shastra! (Though the attachment is in English, and since you have reservations for any commentary in that language, even if it was by none other than Dr K V Sarma, the famous astronomer of South India, I may mention here that Dikshit had originally written his magnum opus in Marathi, which was later translated in to English!) Thus the two equinoxes fall in between the two Solstices. That is what exactly the Panchasiddhantika also has said.

उदगयनं मकरादावृतवः शिशिरादयः. (Pl. see the attachment "PSUdagayana".)
Similarly, at another place the same PS has said मेष तुलादौ विषुवं and since the VJ year ranges from WS to WS, naturally, the two equinoxes have to be between them!

While discussing the gamut of "udagayana" vis-a-vis Makara Sankranti, K V Sarma (in the PS) has referred to the VJ and rued the present-day situation that we are going against the Injunctions of the Vedas and the VJ by opting for niraayna months and reciting even our "samkalpa" against the Vedic injunctions!!

\<Why Maaghashuklaprapannasya- paushakrishnasampinaH verse comes **in between Vishuva verses**, and why there are no verses with solstices which calculate the days. The base argument will remain of Naadi yantra, but that can work for both, i.e., equinox to equinox or solstice to solstice, for any 6 months,**but only if** **Solstices are present in VJ, then only they will work for solstices to solstices**.

4\. VJ is a text of Vedas itself. Therefore, Samvatsara (samvatsara vai agni-vaishvanara T. Br), and (Samvatsara vai prajaapati, all Brahmanas) Prajaapati are related to Agni-Gharma-Vasanta.\>

The below pasting from "JPL Horizons" is very eloquent! The exact timing of the WS in 2020 was December 21, 10-3-28 TDT.

``` The declination of the sun went on increasing from -23° 26' 13".66887  at 10-00-00 hrs (UTC) when the longitude of the sun was 269°.9983315 degrees to 
```

``` -23° 16' 13".66895 and as soon as the solar longitude crossed 270.00 degrees at 10-04-00 (UTC) the declination of the sun came down to 23° 26' 13".66894! ```

``` Thus it was maximum southern Declination of the sun at the time of the exact timing of the WS   and therefrom it started coming down even if by a fraction 
```

``` of an arcsecond.  It means in no uncertain terms that the declination had started "turning North" which in Samskrit means Uttarayana. ```

``` So what other  ''Uttarayana" are you expecting at the time of Winter solstice? ```

``` It will be quite opposite to the same if we check the position of declination of the sun vis-a-vis its longitude at the time of "Dakshinayana" from the same ```

``` ''Horizons''. ```

``` Thus the VJ is talking sense in terms of the two Solstices, and the two Vishuvas! ```

``` ```

``` < VJ is a text of Vedas itself. Therefore, Samvatsara (samvatsara vai agni-vaishvanara T. Br), and (Samvatsara vai prajaapati, all Brahmanas) Prajaapati are related to Agni-Gharma-Vasanta.> ```

``` VJ is surely a text of the Vedas and that is why its Samvatsara ranges form one WS to another because at several places, in the Vedas, the definition of year has been given as two Ayanas! Pl. see the attachment by Sammod-Acharya! ```

I am really glad that you have raised all these points about the VJ so that I could give a detailed clarification about the same.

I have uploaded Samskrit commentary by Somakar and Sudhakar Dwivedi to mediafire and can be downloaded from the following link

<https://www.mediafire.com/file/x5rc1dblbvz4x9s/YajushaJyotisham-SudhakarDwivedi1908.pdf/file>  

***VJ predates the Mahabharata as per Sudhakar Dwivedi and S B Dikshit***

As per the attachment "VJ-predates-Mahabharata", Sudhakar Dwivedi has expressed his view that since the Mahabharatat has followed a seasonal and annual system of the five year yuga of the VJ, it is clear that the VJ ppedates Mahabharata! In other words, Mahabharata war cold have taken place after the VJ had been "compiled"!  

 ***\<So I will leave it to all here at this parishad to have manthan. Again I will request not to read any commentaries or english translations.(I am very specific with words and their meanings)> **  
***

There is a really comprehensive Sanskrit commentary of the Vedanga Jyotisha by Shivraj Acharya Kaundinyana of Nepal available in printed version and it has been published by Chaukhamba Vidyabhavan, Varanasi.

Some pages from the same are attached for perusal and they contain really caustic comments about the Surya Siddhanta and the entire Hindu fraternity has been chided by hims for treating the SS as a shastra since it is actually a work by some ''outsider''!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!
