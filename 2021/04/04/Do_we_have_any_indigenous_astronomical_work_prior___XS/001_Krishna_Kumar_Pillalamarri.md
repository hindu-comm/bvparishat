Sir,

It would be great idea to see you argue with Shri Nilesh Oak and Miss Rupa Bhaty on the archaeo-astronomy discussion that is currently taking place here. Your question might be either answered or you would have refuted their argument depending on the outcome. I am keen to read the discussion, though, without prejudice to either side.

  

Best Regards,  
  
Krishna
