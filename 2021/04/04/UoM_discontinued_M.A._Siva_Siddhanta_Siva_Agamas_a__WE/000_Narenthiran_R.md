Dear All,

Very sad to inform you, University of Madras has suspended the programmes of M.A. Siva Siddhanta, Siva Agamas and Panniru Thirumurai classics. The decisions were announced at the annual meeting of the UoM senate on Saturday. Reason cited as the less interestshown by the students, Shortage of funds and teacher vacancy.

  

Thanks

Narenthiran
