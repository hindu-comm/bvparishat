Dear Dr. Raj,

It is currently classified. It would be public eventually.

Basically it is an auto-navigator run by laser detection.  

It detects the surface and the environment and determines

the direction and speed of movement. There are other

parameters. You can contact me privately if you have  

scientific interest.

Regards,

Bijoy Misra
