Please also note- Vishuva( vernal equinox) to vishuvant(autumnal equinox) and then vishuvant( autumnal equinox) to vishuva( vernal equinox) were two pakshas of the year. Therefore, Vishuvant- i.e., central Sattra day. I will be bringing evidence soon and few evidence from Aitereya Brahmana too in my coming blogs.
