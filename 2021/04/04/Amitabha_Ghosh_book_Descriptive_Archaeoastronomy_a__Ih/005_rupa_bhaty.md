Dear Subramanya ji,

  

I have already posted a gist from my seminal peer reviewed paper presented in Vedanta conference JNU in one of my blogs refuting one of the allegations on identifying Samvatsara with Vasanta. And I have already posted the link in Bhartiyavidparishad.

  

I am reposting my blog link here which has rectified the hundred+ year old problem of western authors like Haug and Whitney which has still keptblindfoldedus Indianswith wrong translations and interpretations till tothisdate. For that matter they had subdued even Tilak on his assertion that Vishuvant also means equinox( see the pic attached).**I have proved with all the internal evidence that Samvatsara began from Vasanta-Vishuva. I believe that this was a deliberate attempt to wrongly translate vishuvanta so as to downsizeall the dates below biblical 4004 BC.** And I will try to prove that too.

  

I will be posting the seminal paper in my Academia.edu site soon,but the blogs have also explainedthem well.

  

Kindly see the gist here.
