Dear Subramaniam Ji,

  

Thanks for sharing this video. Recently I went through the gist of the accessible pages of the same book.

The book appears to have dealt with astronomy parts as scholarly writing well but again the same dilemmas and misinterpretation of the Vernal equinox with Wintersolsticehas continued thechaos on the datingof Indic texts.

  

**We need to see the texts in original** and date them accordingly. Already, Haug, Whitney etc, during the late 19th century, (by subduing the meaning of Vishuvant presented by great sanskritist Tilak, which now appear to me as a deliberate attempt to downsize the dates under Biblical 4004 BC), has created chaos in Indian understanding of **Samvatsaras**. It is high time that we rectify them and make an effort to present the deep antiquity of Indian civilization.

  

Thanks and regards

  

Rupa
