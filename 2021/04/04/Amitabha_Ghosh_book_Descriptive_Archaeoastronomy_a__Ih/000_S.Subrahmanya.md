Prof Amitabha Ghosh has a book out on using Archeoastronomy and
Indian  

chronology. He

  

1\. Descriptive Archaeoastronomy and Ancient Indian Chronology  

<https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789811569029>

His book is very valuable and his suggested dates based on

archeoastronomy is given in his talk below.

It would be wonderful if the Archeoastronomy work of Prof. Ghosh & Prof. RN.Iyengar  

along with the excellent work that Sri. Shrikant Talageri has proposed,

are explored together to see if there is alignment in the details.

  

This would be a very important breakthrough for the chronology of India.
