Until Raman discovered Raman effect, the blue of the ocean was connected to the blue of the sky as reflection.

Aristotle had a knack of creating correlations. India lived on it in creating local astrology. The islam substantiated

through the birthrate of white elephants in Thailand. We have to restrain ourselves when Mars is not an angry planet any more!

By the way, an instrument designed by me is moving in Mars right now!
