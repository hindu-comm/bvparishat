Iyengar Sir,

  

As an unrelated outsider to NSU, I can only imagine that they have yet to migrate the mahAbharata section to the new site. <https://www.archive.org>'s Wayback Machine has archived snapshots of it, but it works only for static content,*not* search and other dynamically generated content.

  

Nevertheless, for what it's worth, the latest snapshot, dated January 28th, 2020, is accessible at<https://web.archive.org/web/20200128054613/http://www.rsvidyapeetha.ac.in/mahabharatha/menu.html>

  

Gowtham-ji, I hope the archived snapshot helps.

  

Best Regards,

Sreedhar
