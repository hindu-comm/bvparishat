Thank you, Prabhu-ji and Paturi-ji.

Prof. Paturi has more or less answered the question(s) raised by Prabhu-ji.

  

Broadly speaking, certain *vr̥tta*-s predispose themselves to certain *tāla*-s more naturally.

On the other hand, certain metres are more suitable for certain *bhāva*-s too.

Metres thus can serve as a bridge sometimes between *bhāva* and *tāla*:

*Pañcacāmara*, for example, suits best for the *tāṇḍava-varṇana*.

  

And further, it is through certain *rāga*-s that certain *bhāva*-s  

articulate themselves more naturally.

  

The dozen metres Prabhu-ji has listed are indeed some of the most popular *vr̥tta*-s,

especially in our *stotra*-literature.
