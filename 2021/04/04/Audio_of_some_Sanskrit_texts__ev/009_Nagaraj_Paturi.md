Guru-laghu pattern in different vrittas/ Sanskrit meters may determine a certain taala / rhythm or (at leastapparent) no taala / no rhythm.

  

It is the idea and emotion in the verse, not the meter that demands a raaga.

  

Bhujangaprayaata, the meter in the present case, is one of the rhythmic Sanskrit meters.

  

The Raaga Sindhubhairavi used has been well employed by her to bring out the Bhakti in the stotra.

  

Though there can be and in fact, there are, correlations between emotions and raagas listed in ancient and contemporary works, creative music composers can always go beyond such listed correlations.
