Prof Kannan-ji and Dr Meera-ji

  

Beautiful presentation! May more such audios come out your efforts!

  

I have a related question (addressed to all...)

Are there any well known (and possibly documented) associations between various vRRitta-s and classical rAga(s) that befiting thosevRRitta-s?

  

We come across many of stotra-s each in a variety of chandas/vRRitta-s but are mostly recited in a monotonic and drab way. It would be good if there are well known chandas/vRRitta --> rAga associations which can be followed in the absence of anything better. May be who well versed in gamakakalA could weigh in...

  

From top of my head.. some of the stotra-s, that I know and hear often are in vRRitta-s like:

\- shloka / anuShTup

\- indravajra / upendravajra

\- vasantatilakA

\- shikhariNI

\- bhujangapratyaya

\- mAlinI

\- mandAkrAnta

\- shArdUlavikrIDita

\- sragdharA

\- ashvadhATI

  

Regards

Prabhu
