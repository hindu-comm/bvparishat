Dear Suryanarayanji,

I'm reading the thread with interest. I'm neither a scholar nor a professional historian so do take my opinion FWIW. My reference comes from reading BC Law's voluminous compendiums - Tribes of Ancient India and Historical Geography of Ancient India (both on [archive.org](http://archive.org))

  

Wrt what you mention, let us consider separately Magadha at time of Buddha/Bimbisara/Ajatsatru and Magadha of Asoka (in case there was later shift)  
  
Magadha during Buddhist times - my rebuttal to your arguments.

1\) Sravathi is pretty far to north of Rajgriha/Pataliputra. So it is not at all inconceivable that it is referred to as being in the North.

2\) Relics of Buddha are actually pretty concentrated in Bihar-Nepal region. Consider all the stupas and places like Gaya, Pava, Kusinara, Vaishali, Piprawa, Jetvana that are associated with his lifetime and death. Each of this is described in detail in BC Law's books.

3\) You claim Veranjya was in northwest near Taxila and hence proceed to argue it is closer to Girnar. As per BC Law's references this city is near Mathura, and Buddha did venture into the Vedic heartland at least once.

"was a place near Mathura was visited by the Buddha at the invitation of some Veranjya Brahmana....The Master spent the rainy season at Veranjya. At the and of the rainy season he left It And reached Banaras " . We would need comprehensive evidence to refute this

4\) Further regarding distances and travel possibilities to Sravathi - Sravathi was known to well connected via highway to Kousambi linking it down further south. So travel between Rajgriha and Sravathi is not as difficult as you point out.

  

Magadha wrt Asoka:

As far as Ashoka's conquest goes, it appears Kalinga is not very near to Magadha, and he may have been directed westwards because traditional rivalries between Magadha were to the west. By the time of Asoka, Kosala, Vatsa and Avanti were already under the Mauryan empire. So it is not inconceivable that he proceeded further west first, before going south. It does not seem to make a compelling argument for Magadha to be in Gujarat.

Finally the edict issue. I find it more logical that if Pataliputra is not well known it \*would be\* mentioned far and wide to make it well known! Still your reading of it is curious and I admit I cannot explain very well the difference though I disagree with the interpretation. Is that the only difference in all sentences between all the edicts?  
  

Also refer to comprehensive writeup of Magadha in BC Law's Tribes of Ancient India and cross references to it in Historical Geography of Ancient India. Its an amazing wealth of data with very rich cross referencing.

For example, in Ramayana Sugriva sent search parties for Sita beyond his boundaries. Here Magadha is mentioned as country to the east. <https://archive.org/details/dli.ernet.238086/page/194/mode/2up?q=magadha>
