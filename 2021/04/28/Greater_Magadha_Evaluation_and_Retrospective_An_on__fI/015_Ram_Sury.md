I wanted to mention one more point from the Arthaśāstra (but hit 'send' too soon in my last email).  
  
The Arthaśāstra (2.30.29) classifies horses based on the places in the western border regions from which they are imported as follows:

prayogyānām uttamāḥ kāmboja.saindhava.āraṭṭa.vanāyujāḥ

madhyamā bāhlīka.pāpeyaka.sauvīraka.taitalāḥ

śeṣāḥ pratyavarāḥ  

-   Best horses are from : Kāmboja (realm of Cambyses i.e. Persian),
    Sindhu, Āraṭṭa and Vanāyu (i.e. Arabia) -   Middle-quality are from: Bahlika (Bactria), Pāpā, Sauvīra & Titala  
-   Rest are poor quality.  

Almost all of these are either other countries to the west & north-west - like Persia, Arabia, Bactria etc - or western & northwestern janapadas. Sindhu & sauvīra were located next to each other, and are usually mentioned together as Sindhu-sauvīra.  
  

What interested me is that apart from some locations outside India proper, like Kāmboja, Vanāyu & Bahlika, there are some relatively rare places like Pāpā that are mentioned in the Arthaśāstra. Pāpā of the Arthaśāstra is Pāvā of the Pali canon, the capital of one of the two Malla janapadas, Kusināra being the capital of the other Malla janapada.

  

As I pointed out from the Alexander accounts earlier, he found the Malloi/Malli (Malla-janapada) between the Hydaspes (Vitastā/Jhelum) and Acesines (Asikni/Chenab) - and found them fierce and warlike. Their neighbours the Oxidraci (i.e. Kṣudraka, about which in Pāṇini's opinion sūtra 5.3.114, they are āyudhajīvis i.e. professional warriors) joined with the Mallas to oppose Alexander. The Kṣudrakāḥ are named khuddakā in the pāli canon but not very frequently). We dontknow which Mallas these are who are located between the Vitastā and Asikno - the Pāpa mallas or the Kuśinagara mallas. But it gives further evidence of the Mallas also being a north-western janapada.  
  
As an aside, the usual sanskritnameof wrestlers is 'Malla' and wrestling is commonly called malla-yuddha.
