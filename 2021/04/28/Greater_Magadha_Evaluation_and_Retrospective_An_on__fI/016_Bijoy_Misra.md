Dear Sri Suryanarayanan,

While I have not not analyzed the details, I do notice that you have a contrary view to a two-thousand year old

record. Not that the record must be true, but many serious historians have worked on it in the past. I would  

suggest that you write up your observation as a full document such that one can deal with it in a single dedicated

session. Since you seem to be confident in your convictions, it may not be a large effort. With such a documented

story, it could be an addition to the historical literature. You should also take into account of the literary references

from Bhasa and the Jaina Agamas.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
