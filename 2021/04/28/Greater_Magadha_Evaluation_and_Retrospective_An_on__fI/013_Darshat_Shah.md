Namaste Ramakrishnan ji,

Couple of questions:  
Why is your vegetarian map limited to current day India boundaries? What conclusions could you draw if you extend the vegetarian map to present day locations in north Pakistan which as per you might be much more Buddhist than Bihar?

Also do read up translations of Huein Tsang's travel. Which way did he go in search of Buddhism's origin, and where did he report seeing ruins of Asoka's palace?

  

Great to see your confidence in inference capability, but I'm afraid you have provided so far is very tenous and hand waving e.g. Lahore could be Sravati then where is Jetvana and what do you find wrong with current archeological evidence for places on the Buddhist circuit? Do provide concrete data and definitive mapping of each of locations in Buddha's lifetime, if Magadha were to be located in Gujarat. That could make it more credible.

  

Thanks,

Darshat
