Dear Dr. Mishra,  
  

As far as the Kalinga war is concerned, if Magadha was headquartered in Bihar then Kalinga was already right next to it - we dontfind any mention of it as bordering or close to Magadha in any literary source,nor do we even hear of theMagadhan/Mauryans attacking or seeking to annex it anytime before Ashoka, and even for Ashoka it was perhaps his last war (after which he had nothing left to invade in Northern India) - so Kaliṅga must have been located far from his initial base in Western India in my understanding. Also we dontfind any reference to Buddha's visit to Kalinga (or even the name of the Janapada mentioned in the Buddhist canon) even though he spent a great deal of time in Magadha \[and a few times even visited far off Vairantī/Vairantya (Pāli Verañja) in the extreme northwest which lay on the uttarāpātha and bordered the region of uttarakuru near the HinduKush\]. In fact the Alexander accounts even mention Alexander's visit to Mount Meros (Meru) in the extreme North-Western India close to the Cophen river i.e. Kubha/Kabul river (in the region of Nysa i.e. Niṣadha janapada) before reaching Peucelaotis (Pushkalāvatī/Peshawar). Meru/Sumeru is very prominent in the Early Buddhist literature (Pali canon etc) - this would not be the case if Early Buddhism wasbased in Bihar.  
  
Also there are several references in the Pāli canon to trade and business visits of Brahmins and others arriving from Vairantya/Verañja to Śrāvasti/Sāvatthī (one such example<https://suttacentral.net/mn42/pli/ms>) which makes more sense if we assume that Śrāvasti and Vairantyawere 350 kms away from one another and not 1500 kilometres away from each other (i.e. if we assume Śrāvasti was in the Punjab and not in Eastern UP). If we take another example,<https://suttacentral.net/mn140/pli/ms>the Buddha once stays with a Kumbhakāra named Bhārgava in Rājagṛha (Girivraja) and one of his disciples say to him "atthāvuso, uttaresu janapadesu sāvatthi nāma nagaraṁ" (asti āyuṣmān uttareṣu janapadeṣu śrāvastī nāma nagaram) - so to a person of Girivraja, they counted themselves as a southern janapada of Āryāvarta and considered Śrāvastī as a northern janapada - which makes sense as Āryāvarta's southern boundary was the vindhya range (pāriyātra/pāripātra mountains) so Girivraja (Girnar was at the southern end) while Śrāvasti (in/near Punjab) was close to the northern mountains (please see map below). It would not make sense if we consider the current Bihari Rajgir and UP Shravasti - as Rajgir is relatively not really much south of this UP Shravasti.

Besides, most of the excavated personal relics of the Buddha until date are from sites in the Gandhara region between Taxila and Peshawar, not from UP.  
  
If we consider Girnar as the earlier capital of Magadha, it explains why Pali (as a western-Indo-Aryan language close to the language of the Girnar Ashokan edicts) is described by the Theravadins as being based on Magadhabhāṣa.  
  
Coming back to the information we can gather from other Ashokan edicts, at Dhauli (Orissa) he made two separate edicts which are not found outside the Kalinga region. In one of these edicts he makes a promise to the people of Kalinga that he will send out periodically his officers from Ujjayini and from Takshashila - to Kalinga to check about the people's welfare. This is very important - **why are these Mauryan royal officers despatched by Aśoka from the Western Janapadas i.e. Ujjayini (Avanti) and Takṣaśila rather than coming to Kalinga from Patna or Rajgir if the Mauryans ruled from Bihar**? It would rather make sense if his royal base was mainly in the Western part of the country.  
  

\[\[The relevant text from the edict:**Ujenite pi** cu kumāle etāye va aṭhāye nikhāmayisa . . . . . . hedisameva vagaṃ no ca atikāmayisati tiṃni vasāni hemeva **Takhasilāte** **pi**adā ......\]\]
