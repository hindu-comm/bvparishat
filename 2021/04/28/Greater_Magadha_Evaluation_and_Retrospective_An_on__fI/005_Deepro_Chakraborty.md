This is so weird. We know from the inscriptions themselves that Girnar was called 'Girinagara' and not 'Girivraja'. On the other hand, you are saying Girivraja is also known as 'Rājagṛha'. And we do know that we have ancient remnants of Rājagṛha in Rajgir.

  

Moreover, Śrāvastī is not located on the bank of Airāvatī (Ravi) as you mentioned. It is on the bank of Acirāvatī (Rapti) which is in Eastern UP.
