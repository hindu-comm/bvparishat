Namaste,  

  
Thanks for your opinions. There is nothing specifically found in Rajgir or Patna that is more certainly associated with Magadha or Mauryans than the Girivraja-Pataliputra-Maurya-Magadha connection we see at Girnar. The **only** unambiguous refereñce to Pāṭaliputra by Ashoka is in the Girnar edicts (specifically the Major Rock Edict 5), nowhere else. Why does the Girinagara topographymatch the descriptive name of Girivraja?  
  
That Rājagṛha and Girivraja are both used for the name of the early capital of Magadha is well known and accepted from both the early Buddhist and Hindu literature (and is not my finding - I just mentioned it as a passing remark). You may have a look at Rājagaha & Giribbaja in the pāli canon and allied literature.  
  
Also as I mentioned Girnar is close to (and is itself the site of) a number of early Buddhist and Jain holy sites/caves even from Ashoka's times until now. No such luck for Rajgir. As I said Pali is conclusively a western language and has been for quite some time compared with the language of the edicts at Girnar.  
  
Mauryas are called மோரியர் (Moriyar) or its lexical variant ஓரியர் (Oriyar) in early Tamil literature and they have the epithet சக்கரவாள சக்கரவர்த்திகள் (cakravāla cakravartin-s) - the cakravāla of course referring to their rule from the circular mountains at Girivraja (Girnar) which functioned as their natural fortress. \[In later literature, the name cakravāla is mythologized as the name of a similar circular cosmic mountain range that surrounds the entire world but originally the Mauryans are specifically associated with the cakravāla/girivraja mountains that are naturally shaped round like a chakra\]  
  
We know for a matter of fact that Girnar was a major political center for Ashoka, he has left the best preserved copy of all his major rock edicts there, the language looks very stable and clear here and seems to be the first recorded site of those edicts (as Pataliputra has been removed at the other sites and replaced with hidha/idha(=iha). As I mentioned also, Pataliputra was a new city/capital established in Mauryan times, it would not have been well known in the other janapadas except in Magadha during the Mauryan era. So it makes sense to leave the name of the new city Pataliputra where it would be recognized easily, whereas in the **later** copies of the same edicts (located at other places across the subcontinent, the name has been removed). Is this all not common-sensical enough?  
  
Pāli Aciravatī (mentioned as river on whose banks stood Śrāvastī, the capital of Kośala janapada as per the Pāli canon) isSanskritAjiravatī (mentioned by Pāṇini - A6.3.119, as the name of a north-western river), I am not equating it with the name of Ravi Irāvati (although it may be possible that they were the same river), I am simply saying that Ajiravatī was a north-western (Punjab) river and not anywhere close to eastern-UP. You may already know that there is a belief associated with Lahore and Kasur in Punjab (i.e. Śrāvastī and Kuśavatī) being considered the capitals of Lava & Kuśa. Lahore (if it was indeedŚrāvastī)is indeed located on the banks of the Ravi (Ajiravatī) - so Kosala in/near the Punjab is not so far-fetched an idea as it may appear. As I also mentioned, the name of this north-western river is preserved as Hydraotes in greek accounts of Alexander's visit of North-western India. It is easy to mispronounce (or mishear) ajira as hydra so I am pretty sure the river that Alexander saw is the same as the Ajiravatī of Pāṇini & the Pali canon. Vitastā similarly gets recorded as Hydaspes, and Asiknī is mentioned asAcesines, Vipāś is named Hyphasis. Moreover there is a king named Ambhi or Ambisares ruling in Punjab in the Alexander accounts which reminds of a similarly named earlier king Bimbisāra (the patron of Buddhism in the Pali canon). Alexander after crossing the Hydraotes and advancing east came across the Malloi/Mallians which can be interpreted as the Malla janapada who are described as fierce warriors. The Alexander records also mention Sisicottus, ruler of the Assaceniin North-West India who met Alexander - and I believe this was perhaps Śaśigupta (a variant name for Chandragupta) and perhaps he was already a ruler/governor commanding the Aśvakas/Aśvakāyanas in the time of Alexander (around 325 BCE).
