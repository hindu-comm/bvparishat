Dear Shri Darshat ji,

  
I do not claim omniscience, please take my arguments if you find them logical, and point outmy mistakes if Igo wrong.  
  

I just gave a map that I found on the internet - besides we do not have a demographic and cultural continuity with regards to Pakistan and hence pointing to modern eating habits of Pakistanis may not be a reliable indicator of what themajority of them used to eat even a few hundred years ago. In Akbar's time most of Pakistan was still a Hindu majority area. As late as the 1881 census, the Muslim population of the subcontinent is estimated at 20% in the census - now it is 35% of the subcontinent's population. Eating habits change with a change of culture,more so with foreign influence.  
  
Yes I have read some of Xuanzang's writings (in translation). But the problem is his visit was about a 1000 years after the Buddha's death, and while he may (or may not) have faithfully described the situations in his time, we can't use much of it (or at least I don't find all of it useful) as evidence for the political and social situation of a 1000 years before him. In my understanding, he entered India through the north-west from Afghanistan (where he reports seeing a community of monks following the Hinayana (i.e. Sautrāntika) Buddhism, perhaps the Sarvāstivādins or Dharmaguptakas - and also the Bamiyan Buddhas that the Taliban demolished). Anyways I am reluctant to use this as evidence that this was always the case even in the Buddha's own time, so while it is interesting to consider what India may have looked like in his own time, I am talking of a different period - the period starting with the Vedic Brāhmaṇa period... such as the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (which mentions Ajātaśatru and his son Bhadrasena Ājātaśatrava by name and to that extent we can be sure that they are the same people as Ajātasattu and his son Udāyī-bhadda in the Pali canon) - and Aśoka/Patañjali at the lower end i.e. about 2nd century BCE. The more we move to the works of more recent authors (Xuanzang, Bhartṛhari, Bāṇabhaṭṭa, Kumārila, Abhinavagupta etc), the more is the risk we may be relying on changed situations to prove something about early Buddhist period.  
  
With the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa and the Pāli canon, we are on much firmer ground for comparison, and they appear to be located in the same Kāśi-Kosala-Videha territory and pertain to the same periods of time. So we can use the ŚB to independently validate what is said in the Pāli canon (as both are very voluminous works and have some level of overlap). But neither the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa nor the Pāli canon consider Magadha to be an immediate neighbour of Kosala, or that Kosala was located immediately west of Magadha - so the idea of eastern-UP and Bihar located (side by side) being the locations of Kosala and Magadha is very unlikely as them neighbouring each other has no historical/literary evidence.  
  
I do not consider everything in the Pali canon to be identifiable now. For example you ask about where Jetavana (the woods/parkland where the Buddha used to reside as mentioned in the Pali canon) is now located. Jetavana may not be the proper name of any place, it may have been something like Sankrit \*jaitra-vana (where jaitra or its Pāli form 'jeta', means something like the victor/winner - and may be an early epithet used to the Buddha himself i.e. the woodland that the jaitra used to usually spend time in). So we will not (if my understanding is right) find a place named "jetavana" anywhere in a map asitis sort of an adjective. The later theravādins claimed that the Jeta (victor) being referred to in this word was a prince (rājakumāra) named jeta but very suspiciously he doesnt appear at all anywhere else in the Pali canon nor in any other literature, so searching for prince Jeta in history may end up as a wild goose chase.  
  
You might even ask where is Isipatana Migadaya located and claim that it could be nowhere other than at Sarnath which is where it is currently identified to be. Prof. Collette Caillat has convincingly argued (a translation of her french paper is available at [Isipatana Migadaya](https://www.academia.edu/22721043/Isipatana_Migadaya_Translation)) that the Theravāda tradition has understood the name of this place name all wrong from ancient times. For example the Theravāda commentator Buddhaghoṣa (5th/6th century CE) explains that it is called Isipatana because Ṛṣis (i.e pratyekabuddhas in his language) used to fall/descend from the sky there (ākāsena āgantvā nipatanti). So it apparently functioned as some sort of an airport for them. However what Prof. Caillat has explained is that Isipatana was not the name of a place but a common noun i.e. it corresponds to Ṛśya-vṛjana (and therefore means the same as the other word Mṛga-dāva with which it is always found together). It means that Isipatana (or isipadana, isipaṭana, isipaṭṭana, isivadana as found in some manuscripts) was not the proper name of a place, and no wonder such a name is not found in any other non-buddhist literature except the Pali canon - i.e. not even in Ashokan edicts. So we should not expect to find any town or name of a location called Isipatana or jetavana on the map.

  

Similar to the Pali tradition getting the above names all misunderstood, they (the authors of the Pali canon) even call the old king Ikṣvāku as Okkāka - how could this be? Could he have been called Okṣavāka (>Okkāka) by some people in the Buddha's time and Ikṣvāku by others? Kharoṣṭhi script (and specifically Prof. Harry Falk's excellent documentation of the early inscriptions at <http://www.indoskript.org/>) came to my rescue.  
  

इ is written like this in Kharoṣṭhī:  
![image.png](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/70521cad3f625/image.png?part=0.1&view=1)

This is the vowel ओ in the same script:

![image.png](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/70521cad3f625/image.png?part=0.2&view=1)  
Also this is ku  
![image.png](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/70521cad3f625/image.png?part=0.3&view=1)  
and this is ka

![image.png](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/70521cad3f625/image.png?part=0.4&view=1)  

So that shows the Pali canon's authors would have been reading a name starting with i and ending with ku (\*ikṣvāku)from a pre-existing Buddhist text written in early Kharoṣṭhī as a name ending in o and ending in ka (okkāka).

It also in my understanding points to something else - that the authors of the Pali canon were most probably relying on pre-existing early Gandhari texts as their sources of authentic Buddhism - because the north-west was where the earliest forms of Buddhism originated - which fits my impression of a North-western Śrāvastī and a South-western Girivraja.

  

You have also asked what I find wrong with the current archaeological evidence of the places in the Buddhist circuit. I find they are not based on sound evidence. I think Alexander Cunningham's (the victorian era chief of the ASI) identification of these sites in eastern India as being the sites of the old janapadas to be a shoddy piece of work. We have since then not challenged his suggestions much, and are continuing to mislead ourselves by pretending that the sites he identified as being Kosalan and Magadhan cities are nothing more than fantasy.

  

Coming back to BC Law - He has said in Tribes of Ancient India, pg 161 "The distance and direction of Kausambl from Sarnath as given by Fa-Hien may be taken as fairly correct." - so you can see he takes Sarnath as Isipatana Migadaya (which Prof. Caillat has convincingly later proved as being based on a misunderstanding of the word Isipatana) - this is one example where BC Law makes unsubstantiated claims, and he put his own misunderstanding in the mouth of Fa-Hsien/Faxian.
