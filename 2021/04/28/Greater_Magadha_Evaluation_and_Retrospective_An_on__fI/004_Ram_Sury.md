Namas Sarvebhyaḥ,

  

Prof. Bronkhorst's theory of Greater Magadha is a rather baseless theory - it relies on the stale Victorian era presumption (which is still being thrown around as some kind of incontrovertible fact) that Magadha itself was located somewhere in Bihar with its headquarters at Patna - and Greater Magadha (according to Prof. Bronkhorst) was the region in and around Magadha conquered and dominated by a society that had very less to do with the Vedic Brahmins (who he thinks,were living west of his fictional Greater Magadha region).  
  
So he postulates in his book that Greater Magadha in the north-eastern part of India was the home of prakrit, Buddhism, Jainism, Ajivikism, and other non-Brahmanical religions opposed to Vedic Brahmins, and they had their royal patrons (like the Mauryans, Ajatashatru, Bimbisara etc who were also similarly opposed to Vedic brahmins) etc.  
  
It can be proved beyond doubt that much of modern-Western Indology is in caught in hopelessnet of paradoxes due to these kinds of wild Western hypotheses ruling the roost (and this theory of Prof. Bronkhorst will do nothing to alleviate the confusion, it merely adds to it). It has been a decade since the book was published and I have not seen anyone pointing out the obvious absurdity of his theory convincingly. So here let me point out one fact that I think will debunk his hypothesis. It is about the location of Girivraja - the capital of Magadha.  
  
It has already been conclusively proved that Pali is a western-Indo-Aryan language (not an Eastern-Indo-Aryan language) very close to (and seems to be modelled on) the language of the Girnar edicts of Ashoka. We also know for a fact that before Pataliputra became the capital of the Mauryans, the capital of the Magadha janapada was Girivraja (also called Rājagṛha). As the name Girivraja itself indicates, it was a location encircled by mountains (and was unique enough to get that name and therefore could not be confused with any other hilly location in the area). As we can see on the Google Terrain Map of Girnar ( <https://www.google.com/maps/@21.5227483,70.5575434,12z/data=!5m1!1e4> ), it clearly shows a place that is encircled by hills, and since we know for sure that is an important place is associated with Ashoka as he has left his 14 major rock edicts at this location. Also the king
Rudradāman I(ruled 130–150 CE)has mentioned in his inscription at Girnar right next to Ashoka's inscriptions that this place was associated with Chandragupta Maurya as well. So Girnar has a history that is pre-Ashokan and clearly fits the name of Girivraja. Its current name Girnar (\<Girinagara) is also close to Girivraja.  
  
Also in Girnar Major Rock Edict 5 - Ashoka says in one of the lines:**Pāṭalipute** ca bāhiresu ca nagaresu  
The same line of the same RE5 in Kalsi, Uttarakhand reads: **hid\[ā\]** bā\[h\]ilesu cā naga\[l\]esu  
The same line of the same RE5 in Shahbazgarhi (near Peshwar) reads: **ia** bhahireśu ca nagareśu  
The same line of the same RE5 in Mansehra (near Abbotabad& Muzaffarabad, Kashmir) reads:**hida** bahireṣu ca nagareṣ\[u\]  
The same line of the same RE5 in Dhauli (in Odisha) reads:**hida** ca bāhilesu ca nagalesu  
  
So we see that only at Girnar is the name Pataliputra mentioned (in all other places of the subcontinent, it is replaced by hida i.e. iha) - which certainly means that only the people around Girnar were expected to know the location of Pāṭaliputra (as it was close to that location). At the other places where the name Pāṭaliputra would not be recognized (as it was a new city built in the Mauryan era) unlike Girivraja, the edicts did not mention the name. But the people of Magadha living at Girivraja were expected to recognize and know Pataliputra.

  
So Magadha was somewhere in Gujarat, not near Patna or Bihar. This one single fact is enough to dump much of modern Western Indology into the trash and restart looking afresh at the location of Magadha being located in South-Western Āryāvarta (in or around Girnar).  
  
Add to this the fact that the Jains have always been thickly concentrated in Western India (particularly, Gujarat, Rajasthan & Western Maharashtra), and Girnar itself is a very important Jain pilgrimage site, while they are nowhere to be found in Patna - the ostensible capital of the Mauryans. Thus Magadha is located in and around Gujarat, not anywhere near Bihar.

So Buddhism is not a religion of the eastern-India but originally a religion of Western-India - and Prakrit first arose in the Western India after the Achaemenid (Sakyan) empire had invaded the Indus valley in the 5th century BCE.  
  
There is also evidence that the janapadas of Kāśi, Videha & specifically Kosala (and its capital Śrāvasti which is described as being on the banks of Ajiravatī) was located closer to Punjab and not in Eastern UP. Ajiravatī is called Hydraotes in Greek records in the accounts of Alexander, and is also mentioned by Panini as a north-western river. Further Patañjali mentions in the 2nd century BCE that the Yavanas had attacked Sāketa in his time, which could have been the invasion of[Demetrius II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demetrius_II_of_India)(as Sāketa was located somewhere close to Punjab in his time) and Demetrius never ruled eastern UP as per available evidence. All Indo-Greek kingdoms were based only in the North-West.
