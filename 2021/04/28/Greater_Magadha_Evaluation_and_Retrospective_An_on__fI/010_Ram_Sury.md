Namaste Sudarshan ji,  
  
Similar to the two river names in Sanskrit अजि**र**वती (not अजि**रा**वती**)**& इ**रा**वती - in greek also two names are recorded Ὑδραώτης (romanized asὙthraotes, appearing to correspond to ajiravatī)andὙαρῶτις (romanized asὙarῶtis, and appearing to correspond to irāvatī). Both these names are associated with accounts of Alexander's invasion, but could have perhaps meant different parts of the same river,or perhaps it was known by both names.  
  
As I mentioned earlier Pāṇini is specifically aware of this river name (as it flows in his region) and Ashtadhyayi 6.3.119 specifically names this river to highlight an exception to the general rule where the final syllable is short when followed by matup pratyaya (matau bahvacaḥ anajirādīnām), hence ajiravatī not ajirāvatī. As we know rivers flow fastest near their hilly origin and the current slows as they flow further away towards the sea, so the name ajiravatī(meaning fast-flowing)may have been used to refer to the same river in its northernmost parts as it flows down from the Himalayas towards Lahore.  

  
Regards,

Ramakrishnan Suryanarayanan
