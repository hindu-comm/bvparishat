Namaste!

  

Thanks to Sri Kushagra Ji for your example and thanks to Prof. Deshpande Ji for the obvious question. In Yājñavalkya-śīkṣā (Yś), **Praṇavaṃ tu plutaṃ kuryāt** (Yś., 15a), the statement states the plutatva of praṇava, but is that applicable in every aspect? Such aquestion is also there because the **ekamātrikatā**of **vyāhṛtis** (*vyāhṛtīr-mātrikā viduḥ*, Yś, 15b)****is also stated in the same verse! It seems that the statement is an apavāda. However, if the verse carries **vidyāt**instead of**kuryāt** that might be a generalstatement for the plutatva of praṇava.

  

Let me accept the plutatva of praṇava as a rule, then in this part of gītā,**vedyaṃ pavitramoṃkāra** (Śrīmad-bhagavad-gītā, 9.17), the rule of chandas is violating (in case of verses which start with praṇava or have praṇava in such position which has no impact on anuṣṭup are not adequate). And this would be more problematic in the case of other systematicmetres like upendravajrā, indravajrā, etc.  
  

dhanyo'smi,

Abir
