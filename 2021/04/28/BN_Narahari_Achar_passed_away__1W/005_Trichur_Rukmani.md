What a shock. I first met him when he visited Concordia University and gave a lecture on his pet topic "Planetarium Software and the date of the Mahabharata". This was at the Mahabharata conference at Concordia. That lecture is included in the edited volume of the conference papers titled "The Mahabharata: What is not here is nowhere else"

My deepest sympathies to the family members and pray that they have the strength to bear this loss.

Om

rukmani
