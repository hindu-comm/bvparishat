I was aware that he was experiencing up and down in his health for the last few years. My recent interaction with him was in January 2020 where both of us were part of the panel discussion at the WAVES 2020 conference.  
  
I became aware of the work of Prof. Narahari Achari around 2005. It was he who made me aware of the discussion about the dating of Mahabharata by Bharat-Rathna P V Kane in his 'History of Dharmashastra'. This work of P V Kane provided me a good start in my Purva-paksha of Mahabharata dating research. Prof. Achar and I had many other interesting discussions about non-dating aspects of the epics, e.g. Bhima as a Soup-Karta (Ballava), metallurgy in ancient India, etc.  
  
We exchanged notes via email since then and had an opportunity to meet him on few occasions during conferences and we were part of the multiple panel discussions and conference sessions. We exchanged notes in private and we had arguments/debates/discussions in public.  
  
Om Shanti.
