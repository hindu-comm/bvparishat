Feel sad. He was a prolific writer on matters concerning India's past. This is how I first got attracted to his paper on Shatapatha Brahmana in IJHS.

We met twice one in Bangalore and once in Hyderabad during a conference. He was a nice person to talk to, of course in Kannada, even though I could not accept his interpretation of some verses in the Mahabharata.

  

Om Shanti
