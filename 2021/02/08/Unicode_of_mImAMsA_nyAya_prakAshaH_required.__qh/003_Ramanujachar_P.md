I had hosted the e-contents I had created at CDAC in bhoomi server of IISc when I was offering a course there.

Later, it could not be maintained.

Now all those \[and many more!\] are in our Trust website, post-retirement

<https://parankusan.cloudapp.net>, .

Proof-reading, a very time-consuming process, and requiring domain expertise, is holding back hosting many such

important works.
