This should be a treat! Thank you for sharing this, Michel.

  

IKS series curated at IIT Gandhinagar has been, as I see it atleast, unique in its conception, panaromic in its scope and substantive vis-a-vis insights. I thank you, and everyone else, who has made this series possible, over the years. I will miss today's session live but plan to attend the 2nd part live (and the recording of the 1st part when it becomes available).

  

Sincerely,

Megh
