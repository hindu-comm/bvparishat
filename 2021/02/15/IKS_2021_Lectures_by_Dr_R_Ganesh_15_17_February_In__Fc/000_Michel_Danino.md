Dear scholars,

 Our IKS course will host this coming week a distinguished and encyclopaedic scholar, Dr R. Ganesh, better known as **Shatavadhani R. Ganesh** in view of his extraordinary accomplishment of having performed over 1,200*[ashtāvadhānams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avadhanam)* and five *shatāvadhānams*in Kannada, Sanskrit, Telugu and Prakrit.

 On Monday (today) and Wednesday, Dr Ganesh will speak on **Indian poetics**, its foundations and resulting aesthetic experience, cutting across regions and languages. Thursday's session will be an interactive one.
