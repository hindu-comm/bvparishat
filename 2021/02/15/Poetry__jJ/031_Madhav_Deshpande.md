Poetry

  

सरस्वत्या: प्रसादेन सिसृक्षा जायते कवे: ।

न सिसृक्षां विना काव्यं न काव्यं रसनां विना ।।

  

By the grace of Sarasvati, the Goddess of Speech, a poet has a desire to compose a poem. Without such a desire there cannot be a poem, and it does not become a poem unless it is aesthetically delightful.
