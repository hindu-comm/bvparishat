While I congratulate Dr. Jayaraman, I also note the vibrant scholarship in languages as expressed in newspaper items posted by Dr Paturi.

Hope other scholars would post items of activity in other regions of the country. It is delightful to hear of glowing literary activities.

Dr Jayaraman is a scholar of words. I have admired his expressive poetry. A well-deserved recognition..
