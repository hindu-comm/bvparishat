About the speaker:

***Śatāvadhānī *Dr. R Ganesh **(b. 1962, Bengaluru) is one of India’s foremost Sanskrit poets and scholars. He writes and lectures extensively on various subjects pertaining to India and Indian cultural heritage. He is a master of the ancient art of *Avadhānam*, where he faces a group of eight (in *A**ṣṭāvadhānam*) or hundred (in *Śatāvadhānam*) questioners and in response to their many queries, composes extempore poems set to metre, solves poetic challenges, solves a magic square, keeps track of the count of a randomly rung bell, and so forth. Ganesh performs *Avadhānam* primarily in Kannada, Sanskrit, and Telugu. (He is credited with reviving the art in Kannada.) He has performed more than 1,200 *A**ṣṭāvadhānam*s and five *Śatāvadhānam*s thus far. He is fluent in several languages including Sanskrit, Pali, Prakrit, Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Hindi, Greek, Latin, and Italian. He is well versed in the *Veda*s, *Vedā**ṅga*s, *Upani**ṣads*, *Dharma-śāstra* literature, various classical texts on the arts like the *Nā**ṭya-śāstra*, and literature in classical Sanskrit. Ganesh holds a bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering and master’s degree in Metallurgy as well as in Sanskrit. *Hampi University* awarded him a D. Litt. for his thesis, ‘The Art of *Avadhānam* in Kannada.’ *Tumkur University* awarded him an honorary doctorate (D. Litt.) He is recipient of several awards and recognitions including the *Badarayana-Vyasa Puraskar* from the President of India for his contribution to the Sanskrit language.
