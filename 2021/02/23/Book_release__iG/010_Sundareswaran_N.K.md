Thank you Shri Balasubramanian Ramakrishnan for the links provided.

Thank you Nagaraj Paturi ji.

Yes. Kaivalyanavanītam is a metrical *prakaraņa* work on Advaita Vedānta. The Sanskrit work authored by Śańkukavi is the translation of the original Tamil work, bearing same (Sanskrit) name, authored by Tāņdavarāya Svāmikaļ of 16th century.

  

Svāmikaļ was a native of Nannilam (village near Thanjavur of Tamil Nadu).

The work has been very popular in Tamil Nadu. Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi was very fond of this work. Whenever he chose to talk, which happened not often, he used to cite this work.

The work has been translated into many languages such as Malayalam, Telugu, Sanskrit, English and German.

The Sanskrit translation (authored by Śańkukavi) has got five previous editions.

The latest of these (2018), carried out by Dr. Janakisharan Acharya, is reported to this forum by the editor himself.

In my detailed introduction (in English), I have discussed these and the related aspects. My प्रास्ताविकम्‌ (file attached to the originating post) contains a gist of these details.

  

Thanking one and all once again,

nks
