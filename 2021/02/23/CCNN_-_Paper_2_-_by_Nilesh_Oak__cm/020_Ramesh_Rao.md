Throwing down gauntlets and aggressively and off-puttingly so should not become the modus operandi for discussions and debates.

  

Research, especially in these matters where astronomy, linguistic analysis, authenticity of historical narratives all coalesce researchers, I believe (having no training or skill in any of these areas but having done research in the social sciences for thirty years), need to triangulate both data and methods carefully.

  

In this context, here is the link to a new blog by my friend Dr. Raja Ram Mohan Roy which might engage the attention of researchers pursuing the dating of the epics and the events mentioned in our epics:
