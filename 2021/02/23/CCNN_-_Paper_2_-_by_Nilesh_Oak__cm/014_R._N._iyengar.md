 No discussion is taking place on the Ramayana verse, other than some tangential postings by the writer of the Chapter"Astronomy and Epic Chronology''. Hence, I like to take the thread further as the matter is not trivial to be pushed under the rug. When I read the interpretation of the verse I was disappointed to put it mildly. The grammatical construction is quite simple and I could not convincemyself that the poet meant to say *Saptarshisare circumambulating**Brahmarashias the Pole Star.*Nonetheless,I liked to know other interpretations, if any, since thework has come with the editorial stamp of two Sanskrit scholars. I would appreciate it if the editors of the volume respond with their translation or interpretation of the verse under discussion.
