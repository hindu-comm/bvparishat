Sri Nilesh,  

It is not that. You seem to be going away from poetic and grammar rules.

In that stanza the adjectives are toभार्गवः as Prof Korada explained.

In case that is your only assertion, it would be erroneous.

This is my opinion, I am not arguing your interpretation.

Further I wish to point out that dating has to be more comprehensive than a signal

to have historical significance.  

Thank you.

PS. I do astronomical detection for a living.
