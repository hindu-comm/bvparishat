I agree with Prof. R N Iyengar that the matter related to Yuddha 4:48 is not at all trivial. In addition to the translations posted by me, there are numerous other epic researchers who have translated this verse in additional ways.  
  
Any input and critique of these various commentaries by other knowledgeablefolks here is much appreciated.
