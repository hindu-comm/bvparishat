Misraji says:

  

The two Sanskrit commentaries that you yourself cited clearly supply the ellipsis as**आवर्तमाना इति शेषः**, just after explaining प्रदक्षिणम्. It is clear that both commentaries suggest that the word**आवर्तमाना** is to be understood in the verse (by अध्याहार). So with this, the *anvaya* problem that you raised is resolved: सर्वे शुद्धाः परमर्षयः अर्चिष्मन्तः ध्रुवम् प्रदक्षिणम् \[आवर्तमानाः\] प्रकाशन्ते seems to be the *anvaya* as per the commentaries.

What is आवर्तमानाः, as the commentaries say, if not“revolving around”? Monier-Williams explains आवर्तमान as “going round, revolving” and also “advancing, proceeding”. If you argue for the latter meaning, how does one explain the commentary which says **प्रदक्षिणं यथा तथा आवर्तमाना इति शेषः**.

  

My question is simple:

The commentator(s) use the word ***śeṣa**ḥ* \<आवर्तमाना इति शेषः*\>*

(reg. ध्रुवम् प्रदक्षिणम् \[आवर्तमानाः\] प्रकाशन्ते)/ प्रदक्षिणं यथा तथा आवर्तमाना इति शेषः.

but Misraji paraphrases it as ***adhyāhāra***.

  

Are not these two words different in sense in the context of ellipsis  

as per Mīmāṁsā terminology/approach?
