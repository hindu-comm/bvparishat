Without having a strong*opinion*on this ....

if we consider the verse, the anvaya could be

विशुद्धः ब्रह्म-राशि: - clear brahmaraashi

शुद्धाः परम-ऋषयः च - clear paramarishayah also

सर्वे अर्चिष्मन्तः च - and all are bright

ध्रुवम् - dhruvam

प्रदक्षिणम् प्रकाशन्ते - pradakshiNam shining

  

The saptarishis go in a pradakshiNa around (whichever) polestar in a year anyway. There is nothing special about this.  

Since 'pradakishiNam' is mentioned, the parama-rishayah could be presumed to be to the right-side of Dhruva (i.e. will be seen to the left of -whichever- Dhruva from here on earth)

If the sapta-rishi is seen from earth to be to the left of the whichever-pole-star, then it could indicate some seasonal time.

We have to keep in mind, precession would have influenced intensity and time of seasons also...  

  

I guess the question would be about what "brahma-raashi" means - in this case, imho, it indicates just the entire 'night sky'/i.e. the celestial sphere is bright and clear.

The verses before and after also paint a clear sky, weather with good nimittani.
