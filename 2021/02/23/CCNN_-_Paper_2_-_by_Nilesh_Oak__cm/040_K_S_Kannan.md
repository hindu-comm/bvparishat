Dear Prof. David Reigle,

  

I think "*encircle*" in the translation is inadequate for what an important commentary explains as

*pradakṣiṇam *āvartamānāḥ**

which would mean "*revolving around* in a *pradakṣiṇa* manner"

\- the underlined word being taken as "*śeṣa*"  

(what is required for completion of sense but left unstated).

  

Why has this explanation in the commentary,  

which is quite helpful in understanding, been left out/just ignored then,

in the Discussion? (Of course, not all senses can figure in the Translation part)  

  

Is it possible then to claim that the key ideas of the commentaries  

have all been taken into account and considered ?
