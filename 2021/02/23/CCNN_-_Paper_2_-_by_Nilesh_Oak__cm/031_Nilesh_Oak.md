Thank you Shri Nityananda Mishra Ji. Thank you all.  
  
I took Brahmarashias the pole star for the followingreasons.  
  
1. 500+ specific pieces of astronomy evidence, when put together as a jigsaw puzzle (planets, comets, eclipses, phases, and positions of the moons, positions of the Sun, chronology details, seasons, Tithi, Nakshatra) from Valmiki Ramayana leads to 13th millennium BCE as the timing of Ramayana and specifically 12209 BCE as the year of Rama-Ravana Yuddha.  
  
2. Evidence from Mahabharata, Ramayana, and Parashara Tantra, coupled with Nakshatra and Naishatra deities evidence from ancient Indian narrativeslead to the identification of Brahmarashi with nakshatra/Star Abhijit = Vega.  
  
3. Brahmarashi= Abhijit= Vega was indeed the pole star during the 13th millennium BCE  
  
4. At least one translator of Valmiki Ramayana has identified Brahmarashi as = Very bright pole star. \[ conflict of interest disclaimer - this translator has neither attempted dating of Ramayana and his translation existed before my dating determination of Ramayana to 13th millennium BCE\]  
  
5. Mahabharatadescriptions of Mars aligned along with the position of Brahmarashi(Abhijit), next to Shravana nakshatra has been corroborated for 16 October 5561 BCE. 8+ specific descriptions of Mars are corroboratedfor year 5561 BCE and the only year 5561 BCE in the last 15,000+ years.  
  
6. Variant readings of Mahabharata text for 'Brahamarashi' reads 'Bramhyanakshatra', thus additionally corroborating identification of Brahamrashi with Abhijit (Nakshatra Devata - Brahma.  
  
7. All of the above led me to take Brahmarashi= Abhijit= Vega as referring to Pole star in Valmiki Ramayana.  
  
Additional notes are equally pertinent.  
  
8. The evidence of Brahmarashiverse corroborates the dating of the 13th millennium BCE for the timing of Ramayana, however, all evidence SANS Brahmarashileads to the same conclusion. \[Stating this to clarify that the fallacy of 'circular reasoning' is not in the play.\]  
  
9. The choice of AV observation and Bramhamrashias TWO POISON PILLS was because of the ease associated with their objective testing, demonstration to the participants at the conference and the common background causal phenomenon of 'the precession of the equinoxes as the basis for both observations separated in time by about 7000+ years (i.e. when the observations were made by Indian astronomers, i.e in 12209 BCE and 5561 BCE).  
  
10. This observation of Brahmarashi as pole star is furthercorroborated by two-pole star references in Surya Siddhanta (Chapter 12) and an impressive triangulation of additional references from Surya Siddhanta (peak of Grishma, Peak of Hemanta, and the Shighra and manda motions of the Sun) along with the 24-degree obliquity of the earth's axis leading to the specific time of \~12000 BCE.  
  
This work was presented at the Oxford conference and a summary is published at Indiafacts.org  
  
11. The Surya Siddhanta triangulation in turn corroborated by visibility (location, timing, context) of Brahmarashi/Abhijit/Vega and Agastya/Canopus references from Valmiki Ramayana descriptions.  
  
All of the above works are presented either through books, blogs and presentations (YouTube or otherwise).  
  
Many more corroborations can be added (e.g. seasonsand lunar months coordinations, about 225+ season references from Valmiki Ramayana. But the above points are more than enough to make my point. This is discussed in my book - The HIstoric Rama (amazon) aka 12209 BCE (Subbu Publications).

  
  
Thank you all for your inputs.  
  

Warm regards,  
Nilesh Oak
