Thank you Prof. Kannan Ji and Shri NItyananda Misra Ji  
  
Would you point me to additional reading on the following....

  
  
*"There is also a dispute, of course, between Naiyāyika-s and Mīmāṁsaka-s*

*in this context - as to the propriety of acceptingśabdādhyāhāraandarthādhyāhāra."*  
  

I have heard about it from many Sanskrit experts when I seek their help with translations. However, if a written work(s) exist on this topic
(preferably English) I would like to read it. This is because while I can not compartmentalize my research methodology into any one bucket (in a reductionist fashion), I am told on multiple occasions, "Oh, that is how Nyayayikawould think or interpret" etc..  
  
Appreciate your help,  
Nilesh Oak
