I am certainly not ready to discourage any effort to understand our heritage. We need thousands of people to study these scriptures.

  

I would like to study the works of Nilesh ji. Requested Subrahmanya publisher to send me copies.

  

I don't claim any scholarship in astro things.

  

But This means to me

६.००४.०४२ उशना च प्रसन्नार्चिरनु त्वां भार्गवो गतः  
६.००४.०४३ ब्रह्मराशिर्विशुद्धश्च शुद्धाश्च परमर्षयः  
६.००४.०४३ अर्चिष्मन्तः प्रकाशन्ते ध्रुवं सर्वे प्रदक्षिणम्  

Ushana is pleasantly shining. Bhargava is following you(I don't know whom). Brahmarashi is clearly shining. clear Saparshis are shining brightly, **they are left to the Dhruva.** There is no verb to mean that Saptarshis are doing pradakshina of Dhruva. Sentence ends with प्रकाशन्ते. Then ध्रुवं  प्रदक्षिणम्  means left to dhruva.

  

Or it may mean saparshis are shining around dhruva. There is a chance.
