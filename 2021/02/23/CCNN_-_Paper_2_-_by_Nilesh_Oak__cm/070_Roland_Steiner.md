\> संतान is commonly taken in the  
\> sense of being 'continuous'. However MW gives "a particular mythical  
\> weapon" as a meaning in the Ramayana. In the Kumbakonam edition I could not  
\> find this. Scholars may like to comment.  
  

As usual, the entry in MW is obviously based on the corresponding  
entry in the dictionary of Böhtlingk/Roth (PW = "Petersburger  
Wörterbuch" = "Petersburg dictionary"):  
  
संतान \[...\] m. n. \[...\] — 9) n. eine best. mythische Waffe \[= "a  
particular mythical weapon"\] Mbh. 5, 3491.  
  
This corresponds to Mahābhārata 5.94.38 according to the numbering of  
the critical edition:  
  
tasmād yāvad dhanuḥśreṣṭhe gāṇḍīve 'straṃ na yujyate  
tāvat tvaṃ mānam utsṛjya gaccha rājan dhanaṃjayam (5.94.37)  
kākudīkaṃ śukaṃ nākam akṣisaṃtarjanaṃ tathā  
saṃtānaṃ nartanaṃ ghoram āsyamodakam aṣṭamam (5.94.38)  
etair viddhāḥ sarva eva maraṇaṃ yānti mānavāḥ  
unmattāś ca viceṣṭante naṣṭasaṃjñā vicetasaḥ (5.94.39)  
  
MW's reference to "R\[āmāyaṇa\]" is presumably nothing more than a simple error.  
  
Best regards,
