Some points of the translation of Ramayan (<https://www.valmikiramayan.net/utf8/yuddha/sarga4/yuddha_4_frame.htm>)
need further consideration.  
  
On Vijaya muhurt translated as moment of success --  
  
Muhurta-chintamani, and other books of similar nature give names of the muhurtas. (Such books are available in print and in internet.). The day and night eachare divided into 15 muhurtas, If daylength of a particular day is 12 hours, a muhurta would be of 48 minutes.  
  
Abhijit is the midday muhurta, and is regarded as auspicious for every type of activity.

  

दिनमध्यगते सूर्यो मुहूर्तेऽभिजिति प्रभुः ।  
चक्रमादाय गोविन्द सर्वान् दोषान् निकृन्तति ॥

  

(I do not know the source of this shloka,)

  
The context makes it clear that Ram wants to start his campaignat the midday muhurta -- Vijaya muhurta.  

  
अस्मिन् मुहूर्ते सुग्रीव प्रयाणमभिरोचये \|  
युक्तो मुहूर्तो विजयः प्राप्तो मध्यं दिवाकरः \|\|  

  

It follows that Vijaya muhurt is the another name for Abhijit muhurta.

  
On Uttara-phalguni being translated as the northern planet of Phalguni, and on conjunctionof Uttara phalguni with Hasta --  
  
उत्तराफल्गुनी ह्यद्य श्वस्तु हस्तेन योक्ष्यतेis translated as -- This northern planet of Phalguni will be in conjunction with the Hasta star tomorrow.

  
Falguni is not a planet (Graha), but a Nakshatra (asterism). Three
Nakshatras -- Ashadha, Bhadrapada, and Falguni have two parts -- Purva and Uttara. Purva should be understood as the first half, and Uttara as the second half, and not as eastern and northern parts of the star.  
  
The Nakshatra of a day is the Nakshatra the moon is in. If today's Nakshatra is Uttara-phalguni, it means that the moon is near Uttara-phalguni Nakshatra, In the list of 27 Nakshatras, Hasta comes after Uttara-phalguni. So next day, the moon would be near Hasta. All three Uttaras (Uttara-phalguni, Uttara-ashada, and Uttara-bhadrapada) are regarded as auspicious Nakshtras.  
  
I am not sure if Hasta is regarded auspicious for mounting a campaign.  
  

On identification of Brahma as Abhijit -- (<https://nileshoak.wordpress.com/2016/10/07/on-the-identification-of-brahmarashi-with-nakshatra-abhijit> )  
  
Whenever Brahma mentioned as a Nakshatra, it is taken to be Rohini. Abhijit Nakshatra is supposed to somewhere between Uttara-ashada and Shravana.

  

According to Muhurta-chinatamani, Rohini is a group of 5 stars, Uttara-phalguni of 2 stars, Hasta of 5 stars, and Abhijit that of 3 stars.
