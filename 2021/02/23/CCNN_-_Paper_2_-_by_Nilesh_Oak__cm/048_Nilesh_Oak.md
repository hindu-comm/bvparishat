Dear David Reigle Ji  
  
Your quoting of Golman's notes was most useful for me, personally.  
--  
As a matterof fact, when I saw Yuddha 4:48, to me the connection of Brahmarashi as Dhruva was instantaneous.....not because of the Sanskrit meaning of the Shloka (I have, at best, a rudimentary knowledge of Sanskrit) but because of my 30+ years of research work on Mahabharata and Ramayana, and astronomy.  
  
I had encountered Brahamrashi (and Abhijit) twice during my revolutionary dating research on Mahabharata (5561 BCE) and Brahamarashireference of Mahabharata was impressively corroborated by me for 16 October 5561 BCE.  
  
I was shocked and surprised when I ran into Brahamarashireference, again, in Valmiki Ramayana. Thus my journey was experiencing/conviction first and then interpretation/translation. Thank you again.  
  
Warm regards  
Nilesh Oak
