Thank you Prof. Bijoy Misra Ji.  
  
Your advice is right on the money. I agree that western researchers and their lackeys in India have distortedstudies of Indic traditions beyond recognition. But then we should also be careful to not fall into this western vs Eastern dichotomy.  There are many great researchers in the west and the east and many lousy ones (compromised or incompetent) in the west and the east.  
  
Indian tradition is indeed very analytic. I do not understand what you mean by it is 'fundamental.' Via Shraddha, I am rooted in the Bhagavad Gita tradition and thus I consider this a journeyof many lifetimes.
Thus, I am in no hurry.  
  
Warmregards
