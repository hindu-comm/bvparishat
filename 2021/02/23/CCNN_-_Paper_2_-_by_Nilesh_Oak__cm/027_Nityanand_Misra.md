Dear Prof. Iyengar

  

The two Sanskrit commentaries that you yourself cited clearly supply the ellipsis as**आवर्तमाना इति शेषः**, just after explaining प्रदक्षिणम्. It is clear that both commentaries suggest that the word**आवर्तमाना** is to be understood in the verse (by अध्याहार). So with this, the *anvaya* problem that you raised is resolved: सर्वे शुद्धाः परमर्षयः अर्चिष्मन्तः ध्रुवम् प्रदक्षिणम् \[आवर्तमानाः\] प्रकाशन्ते seems to be the *anvaya* as per the commentaries.

  

What is आवर्तमानाः, as the commentaries say, if not“revolving around”? Monier-Williams explains आवर्तमान as “going round, revolving” and also “advancing, proceeding”. If you argue for the latter meaning, how does one explain the commentary which says **प्रदक्षिणं यथा तथा आवर्तमाना इति शेषः**.

  

So while the original verse does not have a word with the sense of circumambulation, at least multiple Sanskrit commentaries seem to strongly suggest that circumambulation/moving is implied, in addition to multiple translations which have taken the sense of circumambulation clearly.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
