Since I am interested in Ancient Indian history, the title of the book made me curious about what is neo-orientalism as per SI doctrines in chronology and how it is negated in the book. I read through

"Astronomy and Epic Chronology" to find that as per the author there are "two poison pills" discovered by him. The first is from MBh the second is from the Ramayana, the latter being more potent than the former. We know how Shiva drank poison and stoppedit in his neck to save the world to become Neelakantha. His name sake writer has absorbed the poison pills, digested tospread it around. Now, sample the second pill first \[for chronological priority if you like!\].

I could not make *'anvaya'*of the above verse to arrive at the "Gist '' published in the above book, even after going through the commentaries Govindaraajaiiya and Tilaka. Iam attaching the original sloka and vyakhyana for quick reference. I request scholars of BVP to help me understand how the above "Gist" can be derived from the above verse, with a grammatically acceptable anvaya.
