Dear Shri Bijoy Mishra Ji  
  
I fail to comprehend the logic behind your argument. AFAIK, Brahamrashi appears once in Mahabharata and once in Ramayana. It also appears at least once in Parashara Tantra (Prof. R N Iyengar Ji may know of additional occurrences, if any, in Parashar Tantra. He also states that it is referred to by Vriddha Garga).  
--  
You are not alone who is facing difficulty in accepting my contextual inference of linkingBrahmarahsiwith pole star. That is why precisely this thread discussion is taking place.   
  
Warm regards  
Nilesh Oak
