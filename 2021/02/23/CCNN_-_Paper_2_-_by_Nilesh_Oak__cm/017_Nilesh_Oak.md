The paper of mine discusses two poison pills. Prof. R N Iyengar has discussed in his own way, about the AV observation(first poison pill) before. Since he did not  
see the need to discuss it here, may I take it as his acceptance of Vyasa reference of Bhishma 2:31 and my objective astronomy testing of it along with the  
the inference that the Mahabharata war occurred sometime between 10248 BCE and 4636 BCE?  
  
If not, why not?  
  
Warm regards,
