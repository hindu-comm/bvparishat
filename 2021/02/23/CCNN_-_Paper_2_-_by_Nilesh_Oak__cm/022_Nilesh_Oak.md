Thank you Shri V Pandurangi JI and SivasenaniNori Ji  
  

Specific question to Pandurangi Ji...  
  
Leaving aside the issue of what'Brahmarashi' stands for (A pole star, Abhijit, Shravana, another constellation or non-constallationexplanation) What could be the meaningof the verse
Brahmarashi......through Pradakshnah.  
  
In the translation, you may substitute Brahmarashi as 'Brahmarashi' or 'X'.  
  
Appreciate your help,  
  

Nilesh Oak  
  
PS: Folks here can be assumedto be mature enough to ignorethe wording that one may find inappropriate or uncalled for. Thanks.
