Prof. Korada's explanation is similar to that of Govindaraja's commentary.

  

Brahmaraashi is used as an epithet for Sage Yaajnavalkya in the BrahmaaNDda puraaNa.

  

स विजित्य मुनीश्वरान् ब्रह्मराशिर्महामतिः \| शाकल्यमिति होवाच वादकर्तारमञ्जसा \|\| 1.34.54  

In one of the Praatis'aakhya (can not recollect the name) the word
ब्रह्मराशिः is explained as वेदवित् \|\|

However, MBh, Paraashara and Vrddhagarga mention ब्रह्मराशिः as a celestial region or asterism not far away from the ecliptic, but not counted among the 27/28 nakshatras.
