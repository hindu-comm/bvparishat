And here is the Ugadi offer. Best wishes to all on the upcoming Ugadi/GudhiPadawa (a tradition that is more than 14,000+ years old, although it is been modified - name and form of celebrations through time and geography). Offer attached.  
  
Thank you all for your inputs. Any additionalinputs are welcome and are muchappreciated. Thanks to Prof. Kannan Ji for initiating the thread and Prof. R N Iyengar JI for raising pertinent queries.
