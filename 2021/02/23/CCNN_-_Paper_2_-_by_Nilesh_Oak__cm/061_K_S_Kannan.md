***adhyāhāra*** is what is dittoed from an earlier context (or drawn from  

an immediate surrounding in general) to make the wordings complete;

whereas ***śeṣa*** is what we supply in order to make the meaning complete,

but had been left out by the author for reasons of metrical exigency,

or even as what can be made good by common sense (or even out of carelessness);  

and both happen rather frequently in common conversations.  

There are, I faintly remember, Mīmāṁsā definitions of the two terms.

(Prof. Korada may be able to recollect/restate better).  

  

This is the difference I too had in mind. But as we see,  

sometimes the two have been somewhat loosely interchanged

or may have an overlapping functional role.

  

The *patākā-sthāna*-s in Sanskrit plays have sometimes  

exploited this pattern to good dramatic effect.
