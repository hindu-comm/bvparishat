I was so happy to see this from Purva-Mimansa.

  
  
अर्थैकत्वात् एकं वाक्यं साकाङ्क्षं चेद्विभागे स्यात् --

**जैमिनिसूत्रम् , पूर्वमीमांसा , 2-1-14-46  
  
Thank you, Prof. Korada Ji.  
**--  
  
I have employed the above elsewhere (in works) via the metaphor of mathematically regression equation with stepwise regression via variables but also data points, to check the robustness (validity but also sensitivity) of the theory and inference. I became aware of the above through the erudite lectures of Prof. V N Jha, on Indian Knowledge systems. \[While on the subject, Prof. V N Jha'slectures and personal communications with me have immensely added to my understanding of Darshana-Shastra. It is as if when he explains it I understand it, when others explain it, it confuses me.\]  
  
I did explain this briefly when I wrote down my rationale behind the specific meaning selection by me for this verse Yuddha 4:48 (rest of the 500+ pieces of evidence allude to the presence of and mention of Brahamarashiin Yuddha 4:48.)  
  
The allusion due to evidence and my assertion being that Brahamarashi aka Abhijit aka Vega was the Pole star at the time of the Ramayana.  
  
Warm regards,  
Nilesh Oak
