Namaste Dr. Rao,

  

I had written a note in BVP to thank you for the organisation of that talk.

I could attend about an hour of it and I was glad I could join in.

In fact, some of Dr. Roy's work has been cited in some of the papers Manogna Sastry and I have co-authored.

Dr. Roy's books appear to be clearly non-ignorable recent contributions to the literature on this topic.

  

Best,

Megh
