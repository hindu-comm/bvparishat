Dear Prof. Kannan

  

Here are two more examples worth looking at.

  

**Example 1: Mallinātha on Kumārasambhava 2.3**

  

स्तुतिप्रकारमाह ‘नमः’ इत्यादिभिर्द्वादशभिः श्लोकैः।

**नमस्त्रिमूर्तये तुभ्यं प्राक्सृष्टेः केवलात्मने।**

**गुणत्रयविभागाय पश्चाद्भेदमुपेयुषे॥**

नम इति॥ ‘हे भगवन्’ इत्यध्याहार्य व्याख्येयम्। ...

(original text in bold, colour emphasis mine)

  

Mallinātha gives the explanation after supplying the ‘adhyāhāra’ of ‘हे भगवन्’. The words ‘हे भगवन्’ are not present anywhere in this verse or in the entire twelve-verse ‘stuti’ of Brahmā by the ‘deva’s—not before this verse, not after this verse. ‘हे भगवन्’ does occur in any context prior to this verse in the Kumārasambhava. Yes, the vocative ‘bhagavan’ (भगवन्) is uttered by Bṛhaspati a whole twenty-eight verses later (verse 2.31) while addressing Brahmā, but it would be unreasonable to think that there is an ‘adhyāhāra’ of भगवन् from verse 2.31 in an entirely different speech separated by around thirty verses from 2.3.

  

**Example 2: Sāyaṇa on Ṛksaṃhitā 1.24.7**

  

**अबुध्ने राजा वरुणो वनस्योर्ध्वं स्तूपं ददते पूतदक्षः।**

**नीचीना स्थुरुपरि बुध्न एषामस्मे अन्तर्निहिताः केतवः स्युः॥**

पूतदक्षः शुद्धबलः वरुणः राजा अबुध्ने मूलरहिते अन्तरिक्षे तिष्ठन् वनस्य वननीयस्य तेजसः स्तूपं संघम् ऊर्ध्वम् उपरिदेशे ददते धारयति। नीचीनाः स्थुः। ऊर्ध्वदेशे वर्तमानस्य वरुणस्य रश्मय इत्यध्याहार्यम्। ते ह्यधोमुखास्तिष्ठन्ति। एषां रश्मीनां बुध्नः मूलम् उपरि तिष्ठतीति शेषः। तथा सति केतवः प्रज्ञापकाः प्राणाः अस्मे अस्मासु अन्तर्निहिताः स्थापिताः स्युः मरणं न भविष्यतीत्यर्थः॥  

(original text in bold, colour emphasis mine)  

  

Sāyaṇa says that there must be an ‘adhyāhāra’ of ‘रश्मयः’ (along with ‘ऊर्ध्वदेशे वर्तमानस्य वरुणस्य’). The words ‘ऊर्ध्वदेशे वरुणस्य’ are not dittoed but can are related to the words वरुणः and ऊर्ध्वम् in the previous line. The word ‘रश्मयः’, part of the ‘adhyāhāra’, is not used present in this mantra or in the entire sūkta 1.24. The first occurrence of रश्मयः in the Ṛksaṃhitā is in the mantra 1.50.3 (अदृश्रमस्य केतवो वि रश्मयो जनां अनु), a full twenty-six sūktas later. The word वर्तमानस्य is also not present in either the mantra or the sūkta. Sāyaṇa also says that तिष्ठति is ‘śeṣa’. Why तिष्ठति is ‘śeṣa’ but रश्मयः and वर्तमानस्य are part of what is ‘adhyāhārya’, even though none of the three words are taken from an earlier context or an immediate surrounding? Perhaps because the words ‘adhyāhārya’ or ‘adhyāhāra’ and ‘śeṣa’ were used by commentators interchangeably.

  

Anyway, with these two examples, we can see that the position that ‘adhyāhāra’ is something “dittoed from an earlier context (or drawn from an immediate surrounding in general)” is definitely not universal. At least commentators like Mallinātha and Sāyaṇa didn’t think so.

  

Thanks, Nityānanda
