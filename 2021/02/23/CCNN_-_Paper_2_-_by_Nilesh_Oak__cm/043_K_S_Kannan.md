Tilaka too states (apart from Govindarāja cited earlier)  

*pradakṣiṇaṁ kurvāṇāḥ.*

*  
*

So an idea common to two famous commentaries have not been taken into account.  

Further, no reason/ground for rejecting the same has been stated.  

It would have been desirable to note them, and state the reason for

rejecting the same. It is not the total number of commentaries that is important.

Discussing their key ideas is what is typically expected.

  

There is a maxim in manuscriptology:

"*Weigh the manuscripts, not \[just\] count them*":

It is not sufficient to show off how many mss. have been reckoned with;

rather, indicate what weightage is fair to the particular ms(s),

along with proper justification. Half a dozen highly defective mss.

cannot overrule one highly dependable ms.

  

So it is with commentaries. More than half-a-dozen have been cited,

but some of their key ideas have not been addressed.
