Thank you Shri Bijoy Mishra Ji  
  
I have duly noted your comments. I am glad you are not arguing with my interpretation.  
  
Since you do astronomical detection for living, you will find all 3 of my works fascinating. If it picks your interest you may read them and further, critiquethem, brutally, scientifically, and logically. I would be delighted to hear your critique and criticism.
