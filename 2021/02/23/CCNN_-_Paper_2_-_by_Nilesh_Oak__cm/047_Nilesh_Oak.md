Thank you so much, David Reigle Ji.  
  
The impressive variety in interpretations(width and depth) is, IMHO, due to varied level of knowledge of astronomy, precession and the knowledge of individualcommentator about 'Brahmarashi' itself.  
  
Those who were not aware of the identificationof Brahmarashi= Abhijit= Vega naturally felt compelled to interpret as related to some othercelestial entity in the form of an adjectiveor referring to that celestial entity itself.  
  
For me, since my journey did not begin with this observation and this was one of the 500+ pieces of astronomy evidence for me. However, when I did come across this, it was serendipity at its best.  
  
Thank you for quoting comments from Robert Goldman's books.  
  
Warm regards  
Nilesh Oak
