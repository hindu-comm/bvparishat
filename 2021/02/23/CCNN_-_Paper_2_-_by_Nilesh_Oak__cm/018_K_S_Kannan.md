As the role of the editors has been invoked, it must be clearly stated here that  

a categorical disclaimer has been issued at the end of the Volume Editorials

that the authors of the respective articles are themselves to be held responsible  

for the views expressed in their articles.

  

The same disclaimer has also been clearly and prominently put in the SI-website.

  

The editor(s) dons no corrective/judgemental role  

in matters he claims no expertise/competency in.
