Dear Prof. Bijoy Misra JI  
  
Thank you.  
  
You better stop. You have given me enough Gyan to last many lifetimes.  
  
Let's meet sometime over anOolong tea. I do visit, not that often though, the genetics, medicine, business, and biotechnology departments of Harvard.  
  
Best wishes.  
  
Warm regards  
Nilesh Oak
