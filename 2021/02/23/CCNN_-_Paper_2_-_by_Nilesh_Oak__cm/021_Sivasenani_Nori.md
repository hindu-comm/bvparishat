While I agree that the willing-and-capable comment was uncalled for, regarding the interpretation of the Sloka per se, Sri Nilesh Oak has indeed provided enough evidence to support his 'gist'. Regarding the difficulty in parsing the Sloka perceived by Prof. Iyengar, I think the issue is as follows.

  

The key difficulty is that ब्रह्मराशिः विशुद्धः च is in prathamaavibhakti, ekavacanma and does not agree with परमसप्तर्षयः (prathamaa, bahuvacanam) or ध्रुवम् (dviteeyaa, ekavacnam). Even if we argue that Dhruva is in neuter and such is an aarshaprayoga, Dhruva is still the karma.

  

However, even if we take brahmaraashi as an adjective of paramarshayaH, it does not change the 'gist' of Sri Oak, though the interpretation by most commentators makes it stronger as the connection between Dhruva and the saptarshimandala is more strongly established.

Senani
