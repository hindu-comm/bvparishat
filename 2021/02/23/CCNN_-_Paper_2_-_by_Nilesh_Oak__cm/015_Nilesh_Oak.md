I will be discussing the selective interpretation/commentary suggested by Prof. R N Iyengar for this verse Yuddha 4:48 on my channel (YouTube) and I invite Prof. R N Iyengar to discuss/debate it withme if he is so willing and capable. A readermay notice that I have provided translations by multiple individuals. I have a few more, again by decorated Sanskrit individuals (not that that is relevant, yet mentioning, since, folks when caught, embrace 'Authority fallacy' in a hurry).  
  
I can also organize an on-camera debate, unedited, uncut, recorded via Sangam Talks, Jaipur Dialogues, or Sattology if Prof. R N Iyengar prefers those outlets.  
  
Prof. Iyengar Ji, do let me know.

My work on Valmiki Ramayana dating, based on close to 600+ references from Valmiki Ramayana is available since 2014. I have asked folks to critique it brutally, rationally, and scientifically. No one has taken the challenge, otherthan this kind of side attack (hit and run).

On sattology, I am doing Purva-Paksha series of all existing Mahabharata dating claims. I have already done on Bharata Savitra, Prof. Ashok Bhatngar (1793 BCE) and beginning today, I will be doing critique and criticism of Prof. R N Iyengar Jis claim of 1478 BCE. Next wouldbe a critique of Dr. Dieter Koch's claim of 1198 BCE (borrowed wholesale from Dr. Daftari).  
  
Shivoham! Shivoham!
