Dear Sri Nilesh,  

श्रद्धा is a necessary quality, but there is another skill विद्या.

श्रद्धा is local and individual, it is विद्या that creates scholarship. The latter is a very slow process. It is a grace through long तप.

Try Shankara's उपदेशसाहस्री for analysis on instructional scholarship.

I would rather stop here.

Best wishes,

Bijoy Misra
