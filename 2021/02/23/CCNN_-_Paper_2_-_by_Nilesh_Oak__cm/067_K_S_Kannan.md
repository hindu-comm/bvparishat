Pretty clear, Misra-ji, and thanks for the efforts.

  

The force of etymology in *adhyāhāra*, "bringing something towards"

(comparable somewhat to the modern "drag and drop"), inspired the idea.

  

There is also a dispute, of course, between Naiyāyika-s and Mīmāṁsaka-s

in this context - as to the propriety of accepting *śabdādhyāhāra* and *arthādhyāhāra*.

  

In addition, the grammatical sense of *śeṣa* as *uktād anyaḥ*, "else than what is stated",

(context of kāraka) also reinforced the idea from a different angle.  

  

I had read long ago, and can't remember whether it was in *Adhikaraṇakaumudī*

or some other Mīmāṁsā text, of some such differentiation between the two.

  

Anyway, the proofs of Mallinātha and Sāyaṇa clinch the matter.

If men of their calibre evince little care to differentiate the two,

the two can be taken as practically synonymous.

  

And I admire the profusion of proofs you proffer.
