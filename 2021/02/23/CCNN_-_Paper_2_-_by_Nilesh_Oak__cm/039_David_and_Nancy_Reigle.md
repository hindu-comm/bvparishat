Dear Vidvāns,



A major feature of the Rāmāyaṇa volumes translated by Robert Goldman and Sally Sutherland Goldman is the extensive notes, taking up much more space than the translation itself. These notes give how the various commentators understood particular words in the verses. Here is their note on the verse under discussion, 6.4.43 of the critical edition, preceded by their translation of verses 42 and 43. Lakṣmaṇa is addressing Rāma, saying that he perceives auspicious omens.



42. “It is clear in all directions, and the sun, maker of day, is bright. The Bhārgava Uśanas is shining with bright rays behind you.

43. “The constellation Brahmarāśi is clear as are the Great Seers, which, shining brightly, all encircle and illuminate Dhruva, the North Star.



Note 43. “The constellation Brahmarāśi is clear” *brahmarāśir viśuddhaś ca* : The commentators are divided in their opinion as to the significance of this term. Cv \[Varadarāja Udāḷi\], Cg \[Govindarāja\], and Cm \[Maheśvaratīrtha\] (first alternate) take the word *brahma* in its sense of “*vedas*,” reading the compound as an epithet of Uśanas in verse 42 above in the sense of “master of the entire *veda* (*adhītasarvavedaḥ*).” They then read the following adjective, “clear (*viśuddha*),” with Uśanas as well. Cg \[Govindarāja\] takes it to mean “free from conjunction with inimical planets (*pāpagrahāsaṃyuktaḥ*),” and Cm \[Maheśvaratīrtha\] takes *viśuddha* in its sense of “pure,” a quality that he sees deriving from Uśanas’s vedic learning. (*brahmarāśir vedānāṃ rāśibhūtaḥ. adhītasarvaveda ity arthaḥ. ata eva viśuddha uśanāś ca tvām anugataḥ*.) Ct \[Nāgeśa Bhaṭṭa\], Ck \[Mādhava Yogīndra\], and Cr \[Vaṃśīdhara Śivasahāya\] understand the reference to be to the constellation known as the Saptarṣis, here called the Great Seers (Paramarṣis), or Ursa Major. Cr \[Vaṃśīdhara Śivasahāya\] understands the word *brahmarāśiḥ* as a *bahuvrīhi*, referring to Dhruva, in the sense of “that in which there is a collection of the stars known as the Seven Seers (*brahmaṇāṃ saptarṣīṇāṃ rāśiḥ samuho yatra saḥ*).” Ck \[Mādhava Yogīndra\] and Ct \[Nāgeśa Bhaṭṭa\] understand, similarly, “that which has for its tail the Seven Seers (*pucchabhāgo yasmin sa tathā*—so Ck).” They thus take it as a kind of kenning for Dhruva, the North Star (*brahmarāśir dhruvaḥ*—so Ct). In the second alternate, only Cm \[Maheśvaratīrtha\]—whom we follow—appears to read it as a *tatpuruṣa* in the sense of “the collection of seers (*teṣāṃ rāśiḥ saṅgaḥ*).” Thus, he refers not to the North Star or Saptarṣis but to a different group of stars situated in the southern sky along the path of the *pitṛs*, which he claims are described in a verse of the *Viṣṇupurāṇa* (*tatrāsate mahātmāna ṛṣayo yo ’gnihotriṇaḥ \| bhūtārambhakṛtaṃ brahma śaṃsanto ṛtvigudyatāḥ \|\| prārabhante lokakāmās teṣāṃ panthāḥ sa dakṣiṇaḥ*).

“Illuminate” *prakāśante* : Literally, “they shine.” We agree with Cr \[Vaṃśīdhara Śivasahāya\] in reading the verb in the sense of the causative (*prakāśayante*).



I was not familiar with the English word “kenning” used in this note, so I had to look it up. *Webster’s New World Dictionary* gives for the relevant meaning: “in early Germanic, as Old English, poetry, a metaphorical name, usually a compound, for something (Example: “whale-path” for *sea*).”
