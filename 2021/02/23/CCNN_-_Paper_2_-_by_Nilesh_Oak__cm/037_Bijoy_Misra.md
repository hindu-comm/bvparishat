Dear Sri Ak,

While I don't contest your dating of the Ramayana, I have difficulty accepting your argument asserted through the quoted stanza..

You need to analyze Valmiki's style of writing to appreciate Koradaji's analysis. You may cite a reference in Valmiki where he  

might have used ब्रह्मराशि as a phrase elsewhere.  

Regards,

Bijoy Misra
