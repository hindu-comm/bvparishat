Dear Sri Nilesh,

Since you are young, I do recommend that you invest some time in Sanskrit and Valmiki to develop

scholarship on the matter. Your intention is good, but does need foundation. You would discover your

own transformation after the rigor of the core studies.

It is a habit of the western researchers to do piece-meal work on India to enunciate theories. Indian

tradition is more fundamental and analytic. You can give yourself time in study and research through

the Indian tradition. Let the ideas get rooted.  

Best wishes,

Bijoy Misra
