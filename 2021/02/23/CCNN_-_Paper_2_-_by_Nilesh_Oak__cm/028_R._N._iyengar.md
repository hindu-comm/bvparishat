Yes Sri Misra ji . You are right so far. The derivable gist/meaning is***Saptarshisare circumambulating******the Pole Star**.* That much is fine*. **Brahmarashi as the Polestar can not be an*****अध्याहार** and can not be combined with Dhruva. This is my understanding of the verse. Prof. Pandurangi also says in his explanation: "ब्रह्मराशिर्विशुद्धश्च. it is not the anvaya here."

  

Thanks
