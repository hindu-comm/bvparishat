Dear Prof. Kannan,



I, too, wondered why the views of the various commentators on the word *pradakṣiṇam* were not cited. I suppose it has to do with what the translators judged to be of interest to most readers. Since Vālmīki is the ādi-kavi and the *Rāmāyaṇa* is therefore the ādi-kāvya, poetic usages would likely be of most interest, such as the meaning of epithets. After all, the *Rāmāyaṇa* is not a jyotiṣa-śāstra, and astronomical questions may not be on the mind of most readers. I do not think the Goldmans made any claim that the key ideas of the commentaries have all been taken into account and considered.



The initial question raised by Prof. Iyengar was how this verse could be construed. He later clarified that the revolving of the Seven Rishis around the Pole Star was not what he was questioning, but rather whether brahmarāśi could be equated with dhruva. I did not see anyone post from commentators who made this equation, only from the two commentaries initially posted by Prof. Iyengar that did not make this equation. Therefore, after a week, I typed in the Goldmans’ note showing some commentators who did not make this equation and some commentators who did make this equation. I thought this would be a helpful contribution to the point in question.



Best regards,



David Reigle

P.S. I am not a professor, but I thank you for your kind thought in addressing me as such.
