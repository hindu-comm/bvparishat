Ranganji released a full Rig Veda commentary (in Sarala Samskritam) recently. They made it available digitally yesterday here<https://dhvanidipika.com/>

  

There was a function for the release yesterday. I thought Ranganji's comments at the end were very good. Please takea look when you get the time --<https://youtu.be/sPnnJvVDpUY?t=6821>
