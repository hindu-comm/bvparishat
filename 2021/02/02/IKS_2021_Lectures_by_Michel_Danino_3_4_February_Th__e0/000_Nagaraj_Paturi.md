Dear All,

Tomorrow and Thursday, I will present lesser-explored aspects of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata epics: their geographic, environmental and ethnological outreach, their attempt (especially striking in the Mahabharata) to encompass as much of India's diversity as possible, and, in an almost inverse process, the deep imprints they left on the landscape, eagerly adopted and adapted in folk and tribal lore from the South to Kashmir or the North-East, and integrated in India's sacred geography through countless landmarks. You can find more on these themes[here](http://iks.iitgn.ac.in/michel-danino-2021/).



Thetwo talks will also be livestreamed on IIT Gandhinagar’s[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/IITGN1), with specific links below:
