The poet and his wife

  

आर्यानिबद्धचित्त: प्राहार्या मे प्रियेति भार्यायै ।

“आर्या केयं धन्या प्रविशति ते मानसं भर्त:” ।।

  

With his mind determined to write a verse in the Arya meter, the poet said to his wife: “I love Arya.” The wife asked: “O husband, who is this lucky Arya that has entered your mind?”
