Dear Scholars,

  

I am a Life Sciences professional and looking for information on mental health.

  

I have been browsing for the same and came across Yoga Vasistha. Are there any books/ sources from Sanskrit literature that you would recommendin order to understand/ enhance/ maintain mental health.

  

Looking for your guidance.

  

Best regards,  

Srikanthi Ramachandrula
