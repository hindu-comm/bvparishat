Nothing surprising, Jayaraman-ji.

  

Where will they not spot clefts and drive wedges?

The fissiparous proclivities rampant in tribalists are very much in evidence  

in every brand of the Western species. Quintessentially political animals,

they will try to attack every peaceful society in order to "establish peace",  

their own brand, that is, there.

  

"I am a jealous God" betrays how their god is in their own image,

determined to ruin others that capitulate not to their own barbaric hegemony.

  

Like Nobel who patronised the bomb and established the Nobel Prize for Peace,

they ruin the environment first and then establish university courses on environmentalism.

  

Or better, on lines of Orwell, they have ever been masters of Doublespeak,

and have gentlemanly and sophisticated cloaks for all their very well-designed acts  

of crime, every brand, against humanity.

  

They are very systematic, after all. Their simple motto is:

whatever is worth doing is worth doing well.

and the only thing worth doing for them is genocide;

and if difficult to excute, the same preceded by cultural genocide.

  

ye tu ghnanti nirarthakam parahitam te ke na jānīmahe!

  

(The above default rule will inevitably have a few exceptions perhaps

because a few of them somehow evolve enough to be capable of  

loathing what most of them instinctively indulge in).
