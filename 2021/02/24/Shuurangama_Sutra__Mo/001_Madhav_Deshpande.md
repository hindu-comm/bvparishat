Dear Ven. K. Seelananda,

  

A web source \[<https://medium.com/tranquillitys-secret/the-endurance-of-lies-the-perfidy-of-slander-the-treason-of-translation-7c3f77086c3d>\] points out:

"Unfortunately, there is no extant Sanskrit version of the Surangama*Samadhi*Sutra, and a Sanskrit version of the Surangama Sutra was found in 2010."

  

I have not had any success in tracing the lost Sanskrit original. There are Chinese and Tibetan translations, and French and English translations based on these.
