**Abstract**:  
The program showcases a short film on Chola Bronzes. In the *utsava*-s of temples, the deity in the sanctum, depicted as the manifestation of the ultimate truth, leaves the sanctum and becomes approachable to all. Around 8th century CE, the *utsava mūrti*-s in Tamilnadu began to be made of bronze, reaching the pinnacle of artistry during the Chola rule. Amongst the most magnificent of the *mūrti*-s is the Naṭarāja-Śiva in his cosmic dance.  

  

The technique used to make the South Indian bronzes is called the lost-wax process, which again, was so perfect in every way during the Chola time, that no further details needed to be carved. Each piece made by this process is unique and the *utsava murti*-s thus made with devout and artistic hands continue to bring the *bhakta*-s closer to the divine.

  

A more detailed introduction to the film is attached.
