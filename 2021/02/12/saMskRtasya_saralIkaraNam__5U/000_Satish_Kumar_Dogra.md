If we wish Sanskrit to spread to millions of people, we must simplify the grammar while retaining its core-structure.

With this view, I have been doing certain exercises. One such exercise is to pick out words and phrases from the classicsthat are still in use in Hindi in some form or the other.

Another exercise I have taken is to rationalise the verb-forms. One form of simplificationthat I am trying to popularise is the following:

  

In traditional grammar, the perfect tense and its various forms are expressed by using different लकाराः This results in nearly 100 forms for each verb --- an effort impossible for the modern young man who has to focus on so many other preoccupations. Therefore, there is a need for the simplification of the perfect tense. Here, Tamil provides a model.

In Tamil, the perfect tense is formed by using the participle of a verb and adding the appropriate form of the word "irukku" which is the equivalent of the Sanskrit form अस्.

So, using this model, we can use expressions as follows:

I have come अहं आगत्वास्मि

She has eaten सा खादित्वास्ति

They had read the book ते पुस्तकं पठित्वासन्

He will have gone सः गमिष्यास्ति

She would have come सा आगमिष्यासीत्

They would have seen ते पश्ययिष्यसन्ति
