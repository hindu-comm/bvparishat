Indica Renaissance Fund is pleased to announce a grant of Rs 2 lacs to Hindu Charitable Trust. ( HCT).

In the recent times several activists have made out a compelling case for moving the governance of Temples away from the Government. Whilst this issue is being actively advocated by various NGOs and attempts being made to bring about a policy change, HCT has developed a unique model of establishing shadow committees for all temples that are in the control of Government. The roles of the members of the shadow committees will mirror those that are in the Govt appointed committees. They will be selected from the local communities and seek to monitor the management of Temples and raise their concerns to the Govt appointed committee from time to time.

It is expected such a model will facilitate a smoother transition of management of Temples away from the Government as and when the change in the policy takes place. As a pilot HCT will establish shadow committees in the state of AP and roll it out to the other States in a phased manner. HCT has also undertaken advocacy of freeing of Temples from Government control under the aegis of Sri M.Nageswara Rao IPS ( Retd) and former In charge Director CBI.
