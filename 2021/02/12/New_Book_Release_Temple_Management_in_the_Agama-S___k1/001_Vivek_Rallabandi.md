Namaste,

  

The subject matter seems incredibly interesting and relavent, particularly in the context of the present system of government control of temples that has taken root in much of India, which I imagine is certainly not accordance with the *niyamas* stipulated in the *agamas.*

When is the volume expected to be released and how can it be procured?
