About the Book

For at least 1500 years, temple design, construction and worship have followed the canon ofthe āgama-s. Shouldn’t temple management also follow the āgama-s?Steeped in a history of more than two millennia, the real bequest of India’s ancient temples isthat they are still living in sacred spaces. The gods that were invoked in these temples more than athousand years ago, continue to reside in the sanctums and gaze benevolently upon their devotees.The bells ring for morning service as they did a thousand years ago.The ācārya waves the ārati just as another ācārya did a thousand years ago.No other organization in the world can boast of such amazing continuity. The secret to this longevity lies in the āgama-s.

Āgama-s are the traditional canon believed to be as old as the Vedas, with detailed manuals ontemple-building, consecration and ritual worship. While the world outside the temples – a worldof kings and kingdoms – has changed, temples continue to follow the āgama-s in letter and spiritin their everyday religious function, notwithstanding the many changes in administrativeformats.By studying the activities of the temple, material and manpower required, qualifications androles prescribed for the temple professionals, this thesis attempts to reconstruct an āgamic temple managementframework, using the Kāmikāgama as primary text with other āgama-s, secondary literature and inscriptionalevidence as required.
