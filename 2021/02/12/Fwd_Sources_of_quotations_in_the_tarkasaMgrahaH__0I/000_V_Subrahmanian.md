Jai Shri Krishna,  
  
For my own study I'm preparing a copy of the तर्कसंग्रहः andदीपिका. I am  
trying to trace the source of some quotations made therein and would like  
some help.  
  
1. तस्मात्तेपानात्त्रयो वेदा अजायन्तइति श्रुतेश्च  
  
Does anyone know where in श्रुति this occurs? The same quote is made by  
विज्ञान भिक्षु in his भाष्य on संख्यसूत्र 5.45. In a footnote, the editor of  
the chowkhambha edition of this work referencesशतपथ ब्राह्मण XIII.5.8.3 and  
VI.6.1.1.8 but the second one isn't this phrase and the first one doesn't  
even seem to exist. Also should it be तेपानात् or तपानात् ?  
  
2 तत्प्राप्तिहेतुर्विज्ञानं कर्म चोक्तं महामुनेरिति  
  
रामानुज also quotes this in श्रीभाष्य on ब्रह्मसूत्र 1.2.23 in the name of भगवान  
पराशर. Is thisपराशरस्मृति or even विष्णु पुराण (which is also known as पराशर  
संहिता)? Or some other work?  
  
3.ज्ञानं च विमलीकुर्वन्नभ्यासेन च पाचयेत् । अभ्यासात्पक्कविज्ञानं कैवल्यं लभते नरःइति  
  
In Rajendranath Sharmas' book on शलिकानाथ मिश्र's वाकयसिद्धि, this is said  
to come from कुमारील भट्ट's बृहट्टीका. Am i correct in assuming that this  
work is no longer available and\[ is only known through quotations by other  
authors? If so is there some collection of such quotes? Or if it has  
been published somewhere can you provide the details?  
All assistance gratefully received.
