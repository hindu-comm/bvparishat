Indic Academy is pleased to announce a grant of Rs. 2 Lakh to theInternational Chandramauli Charitable Trustunder the‘[Become CSR Ready](https://www.indicacademy.org/become-csr-ready-grant-scheme/)’grant scheme. This grant scheme was initiated by Indic Academy for NGOs working towards the preservation, protection and promotion of Indic Civilisational Thought. The grant money is specifically aimed at supporting NGOs to build their administrative, governance and reporting setup and processes in order to enable them to raise CSR money from various companies.

Through this ‘Become CSR Ready’ grant to International Chandramauli Charitable Trust, Indic Academy will be enhancing the ability of the Trust to raise additional funds for supporting their educational project for underprivileged children- who come from all over India to study at the Trust’s Gurukul in Varanasi. The Trust provides education, food, books, clothing, accommodation etc; to underprivileged women and children. The Gurukul now has 425 children and women supported on a small piece of land of 1000sq ft. along with 50 residential students. Those studying here are typically children of daily wage workers, migrants or are themselves having special needs.

This education project offers a highly specialized Sanskrit training in Shuklayajurveda, Samaveda, Panini Vyakaran. The children at the Gurukul are not trained to just pass exams but learn Panini Ashtadhyayi, Amarakosha, Dhatupatha, Panini Shiksha, Jyotish and other Vedangas.
