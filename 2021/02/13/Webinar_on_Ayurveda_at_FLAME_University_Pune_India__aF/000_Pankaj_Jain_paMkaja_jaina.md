Connecting Ancient Wisdom to Modern Science  

... and why we are disconnected from Ayurveda today

Have you ever encountered those cruel people who purposely give wrong directions to tourists? In the explorer's midst is a world of discovered wisdom, yet we are blind due to our education. Modern science reminds us that discoveries change our worldview, but warns us not to look at wisdom it has deemed quackery, and certainly not to question the rules.

If we are however true scientists, observers, and explorers, we must look under the upholstery. Under it, we find the wisdom that is profound, expansive, connected, well-tested, and infinite yet practical. Ayurveda is a direct and modern expression of that wisdom, connecting the wise observer to the edges of the Self, from the earth and water, to fire, to our food and our health, and to our mind's ability to navigate. If you as an explorer can understand each fundamental concept of Ayurveda one-by-one, you can see the world and find yourself reading your internal map gracefully and healing in profound ways.
