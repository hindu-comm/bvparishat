I agree with Sri Gudsoorkar AG. In keeping marriages within the varna, the advantage is that a number of factors combine to ensure both the bride and the bridegroom have similar views on many things. While not infallible, this enables a higher percentage of success in marriages. These factors are not far to seek: intellectual compatibility, food habits, dress habits, language, aesthetics, religious beliefs, etc., amongothers. You may be able to identify other traits as well. This is not to argue that they won't be possible in heterogeneous varnas. We are only discussing a higher probability in the same varna. I also do not like the term 'caste' being applied here. This imported term has already done a lot of damage. I hope we can avoid using it altogether.
