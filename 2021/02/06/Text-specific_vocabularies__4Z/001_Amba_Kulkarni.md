Dear Prof. Kannan,

  

With the availability of e-texts and the morphological analysers, it is now easy to get such lists.

What we need is a person with some background in using the tools, and maybe a few days time.

  

If you have anybody in mind who can devote some time, I'm ready to guide him/her in getting such text-specific lists.

  

Best regards,

Amba Kulkarni
