Dear scholars,

  

Are there works dealing with vocabularies specific to texts?

ORI, Mysore, had, for example, published Dharma-sūtra-texts with their specific vocabularies.

  

What other texts have their specific vocables -  

arranged alphabetically or otherwise - all in one place?:

how about the *Rāmāyaṇa* and the *Mahābhārata*? And the *Bhāgavata*?

  

Have any journals published word-indexes of particular texts,  

big or small, in their specific issues?
