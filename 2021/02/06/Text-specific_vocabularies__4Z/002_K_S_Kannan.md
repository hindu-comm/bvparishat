Dear Amba-ji,

  

Wonderful!

Arriving at the base (the *prātipadika*) is the task, essentially.

Has not the Morphological Analyser been "trained" to accomplish it?

Yes, it needs to be human-assisted in order to obviate absurd options getting thrown up,

owing to the versatility in exploring the combinatoric explosion.

  

This achieved, even historical explorations can get engendered/enhanced.

And more importantly certain felicitous (and even infelicitous) expressions

can be noted and employed(or eschewed).

  

A Cape of Good Hope of a different order!
