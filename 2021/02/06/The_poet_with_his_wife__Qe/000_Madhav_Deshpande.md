The poet and his wife

  

तामेव याहि भर्त: कवितां हृदये सदैव विनिविष्टाम् ।

मम किं प्रयोजनं ते निकटस्थां नाभिजानासि ।।

  

The wife says to her poet-husband: “O husband, just go to that poetry that is always residing in your heart. What is the use of me for you? Though I am near you, you don’t recognize me.”
