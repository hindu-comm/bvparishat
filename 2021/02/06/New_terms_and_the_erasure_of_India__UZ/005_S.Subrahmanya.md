Here are some examples from "India China and the World - a connected history" by Tansen Sen. - Chpt 1, pg 83-84  

  

a\) In this line, the author is referring to a number of Sanskrit texts translated into Chinese -

  "..... Although the titles indicate that these were mostly Brahmanical texts, Buddhist monks would have been involved

   in translating them. A South Asian monk called Damoliuzhi translated a text called Polumen tianwen"

  

b\) "It was perhaps because of such perceptions of Brahmins as specialists in mathematics and astronomy, that the Tang

   court decided to employ South Asians at its Bureau of Astronomy"

  

c\) "They made calculations of the movement of heavenly objects and drafted calendars using Indic mathematical methods.

   The most well known of these South Asian astronomers was a person named Qutan Sida (Gautama Siddhartha) ..... "

  

There are numerous examples in the book, but these examples should provide an idea of how the erasure is happening
