@Roland Steiner - Thank you for the link

Pollock usually has one spiel for general public consumption, and a different hard-line in his writings.

  

Yes. After WW2 , the field of "Area Studies" was created to learn about specific regions of the world for the fight against communism.

Specific set of universities for chosen establishing South Asian departments.

Norman Brown , established South Asian Departments and American Instt. of India Studies - which funds all these

The gathering of books from these areas to develop the 'South Asia' libraries was also funded from USAID.

  

There is indeed very little that is truly 'scholarly' about "South Asian Studies" or Indology, even to this day - It has

always been a political tool to keep India manageable.

  

There is another pattern I have noticed - The books/papers that perpetuate India as a hopeless and evil place that needs to

be civilized - are all "open access".  

  

Regards
