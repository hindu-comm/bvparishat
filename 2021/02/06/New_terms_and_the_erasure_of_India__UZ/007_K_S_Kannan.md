The case is almost tending towards

*siddha-sādhanaM doṣaḥ*! :

to seek to prove something patent constitutes a flaw.

That Western academia should be so informed by,  

and worse, dictated by, political considerations and exigencies,

overtly as well as covertly, does not bespeak highly of  

their vaunted "dispassionate" pursuits.

  

A new maxim could be evolved too: something like

*tato'dhītir yato dhanam.*

Academic studies blow in the direction of funding.

(no more is it "bloweth as it listeth").

And Prof. Pollock has the nerve to come down heavily upon *praśasti*-s,

while he is himself the author of multiple crass *praśasti*-s.

Verily did Kālidāsa come down heavily upon creatures like this:

*taṁ jñāna-paṇyaṁ vaṇijaṁ vadanti !  
*

*  
*

Worth repeating oft is the subhāṣita :

*vidyā vivādāya, dhanaṁ madāya,*

*śaktiḥ pareṣāṁ paripīḍanāya \|*

*khalasya ...*
