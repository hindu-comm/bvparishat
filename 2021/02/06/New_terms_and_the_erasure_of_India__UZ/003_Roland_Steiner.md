\>\> continuous use of the term "South Asia"  
  
  

In his inaugural address to the 33rd "Deutscher Orientalistentag"  
("German Oriental Conference") in Jena (Germany) in 2018, Walter Slaje  
made some remarks on the geopolitical background of such terms as  
"East Asia," "Southeast Asia," or "South Asia" that might be of  
interest to some of the list members. The original German text of that  
opening speech was published in volume 168.2 (2018) of the  
"Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl√§ndischen Gesellschaft" (pp.  
265-274); download:

I have attached an partial translation of this article by Prof. Slaje  
as a PDF file.  
  
  
Best wishes
