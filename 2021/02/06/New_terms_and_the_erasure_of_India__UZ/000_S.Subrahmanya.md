I have been reading "India China and the World - a connected history" by Tansen Sen.

  

What is interesting about the book is that continuous use of the term "South Asia" wherever possible. Also, the term Hindu is avoided and "brahmanical" is used.

The author and/or editor seem to be very thorough in this approach.

  

I have seen this erasure of India and Hindu in other academic books.

In california text book case a few years ago, the word India was to be removed.

  

In short, an erasure of the terms India and Hindu seems to be happening and

the publishers of academic books seem to have made this erasure a standard.

  

However, I have never seen the word "Greek" replaced by the term "South-East-European"
