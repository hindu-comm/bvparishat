\> continuous use of the term "South Asia"  
  

There is an interesting remark by Professor Pollock on the origin of  
the modern term "South Asia":  
  
"The word, the phrase ‘South Asia’ was invented in Washington D. C. at  
the State Department. \[…\] I am a professor of South Asian Studies. I  
am a professor of a region that did not exist.“
