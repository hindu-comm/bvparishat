seems to be found during the seventeenth century and later among the Telugu works of the time as part of the titles rewarded to poets such as Chaturvidhakavitaavishaarada alongside titles such as ashtabhaashaavishaarada.

There are many women poets too who held these titles.

These titles seem to have spread to all the Telugu courts in south India.
