Namaste Dr. Suresh ji,

  

I got the chance to go through your session, and it is indeed very interesting and insightful. I got to learn many things from it. Thank you very much for sharing the invaluable piece of information.

Not sure if it would be of any use to you but would like to share that I'm working on a project called Shastra Krida and we try to make toys based on Shastra. We have been working on it for at least last 5 years, but are in the very initial phase.

For the same reasons that prompted us to research into the playthings, we are also connected with two traditional setups one is Samskruti Arya Gurukula based in Rajkot, Gujarat and the other is community driven Vidyangan Learning Facility in Pune.

My little introduction, I belong to Gujarat and have settled in Pune for around 15 years, working for an Engineering software company. Toy tinkering has been my hobby since childhood and that helped me to explore this new dimension of makingtoys based on scripture,as we noticed a stark lack of it.

  

Thanks & Regards,

Sunil K Nakum
