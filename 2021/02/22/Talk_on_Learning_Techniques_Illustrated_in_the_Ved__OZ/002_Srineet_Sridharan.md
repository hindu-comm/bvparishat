Namaste Dr. Suresha,

  

I also attended the session and very much appreciate it. I had one question -- you make a list of shikshana-vidhis and other notions like adhi-chitta etc. Wanted to know in which source text or grantha these are described so that I can study this area further.

  

Many thanks.

  

\- Srineet.
