Dear Dr Deva Pattanayak-ji,

  

You and other members who get the messages from BVP as a digest, should not use the "reply" button from the message window directly.

  

They should go to the specific message to which they would like to reply and then reply from there.

  

Please take that much time and that much effort so that your message to BVP will have the proper title and makes your message appear when searched topicwise.
