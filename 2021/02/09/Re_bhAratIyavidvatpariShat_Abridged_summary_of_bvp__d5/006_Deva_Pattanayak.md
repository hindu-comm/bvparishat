Yes. Clearly at that time people in India knew of many things related to science, mathematics, technology and philosophy as well as ideas on self, mind and the relation between human being and nature ( Sankhya : Prakriti, Purusha, Patanjali Yoga Sutras etc.)

Cursively stating after the Vedas, Upanishads, relating to Sanatan Dharma, Jainist and Buddhist thoughts developed. I am thinking that the Pali and Sanskrit texts arising from Nalanda University have been
preserved and studied further in Tibetan Lama culture.

In addition to religious studies, advances in science and technology took place. Recently scholarly books such as, The Hindu Mind, by Bansi Pandit has appeared. I like to concentrate around 800 AD. From the response from Prof. Kannan, there is an algorithm attributed to Dixit. Is it possible to locate his work in Sanskrit or Pali or Tamil or Odia languages?

Best Regards
