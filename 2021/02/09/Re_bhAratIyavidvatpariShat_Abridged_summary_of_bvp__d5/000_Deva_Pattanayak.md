"[New terms and the erasure of India](http://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/t/51931ba651b4237f?utm_source=digest&utm_medium=email)"

  

Bertrand Russell in his book " History of Western Philosophy" writes about "Arabic Numerals" and "Indian Numerals" in two places :

On page 288 he writes:

" Contact with the Mohammedans, in Spain, and to lesser extent in Sicily, made the West aware of Aristotle: also of Arabic numerals, algebra, and chemistry. It is this contact that began the revival of learning in the thirteenth century,leading to the Scholastic philosophy."

On page 416 he writes:

" Meanwhile in Persia, Muslims came in contact with India. It was from Sanskrit writings that they acquired, during the eighth century, their first knowledge of astronomy. about 830 Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarazmi, a translator of mathematical and astronomical books from Sanskrit, published a book which was translated into Latin in the twelfth century, under the title *Algoritmi de numero Indrum. It was from this book that the West first learnt what we call 'Arabic' numerals, which ought to be called 'Indian'.* The same author wrote a book on algebra which was used in the West as a text book until the sixteenth century.

  

Few questions come to my mind.

1\. Which are the Sanskrit books mentioned above?

2\. How do Iget a copy of the Latin book mentioned above?

3\. Does the Indic academy and other institutions are systematically cataloguing and making them available in a digitised form. 

4\. Is there any ongoingeffort or plan to publish some of these Sanskrit books dealing with mathematics, science and astronomy ?

  

I am of the opinion that Indian intellectuals bear the burden of correcting misrepresentations relating to India. When it comes to Sanskrit, I am very muchinterested in the contents of the ancient Indian texts in Sanskrit properly digitised with search capabilities. Translations into other Indian Languages and their inclusion as text books in higher secondary and university courses is an effort worth undertaking,

As you can see from the above quotations there seems to be gaps of the order of centuries about developments that took place in India which played an important role in the progress of Western Science and Philosophy.
