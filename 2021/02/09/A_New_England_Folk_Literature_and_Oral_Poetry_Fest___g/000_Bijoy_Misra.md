Dear friends,

  

Good morning from snowed Boston. We have one foot of snow  

on the ground as I write this. More is expected. We do need  

the snow here for the groundwater reserve. A lot of US goes  

through drought spells for many years.  

  

Yesterday India Discovery center received the notice of a grant  

award from the City of Cambridge here to host the first Regional

Folk Literature and Oral Poetry Festival in August. This year

becomes the twenty fifth year of an India Poetry Reading group  

that we initiated at Harvard in 1997.

  

We plan to bring out a brochure on the occasion of the festival

to celebrate the folk literature and oral poetry in the world. I

thought to reach out to the BVP group here in case you have any

articles on the topic or if you have recommendations. You can

also give pointers to any recorded material that we can include

in a CD. Language or region is no bar.

  

I plan to connect to the cultural academies in various countries

to probe literature on folk poetry and oral compositions. I request

you to help me connect in case you have interest in the topic.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
