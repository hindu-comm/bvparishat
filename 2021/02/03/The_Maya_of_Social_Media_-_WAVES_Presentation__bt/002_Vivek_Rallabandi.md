Gudsoorkar-*ji*,

  

I understand the concern. I believe that if you take a look at the YouTube video, there is an option to enable closed captioning (CC) on the bottom right of the video. You can click the rectangle with the words "CC" inside of it. The closed captioning seems quite effective in terms of transcribing the text, so I would invite you to enable it so that you can follow the presentation better.

  

The WAVES conference youth segment presentations were done based on papers that each presenter wrote on their respective topic. The papers are still under review, however, and are yet to be released (I am aware of this since I also wrote a paper and gave a presentation myself). I believe that they will be published (if accepted for publication) sometime in Q1 of 2021.

  

Namaste,

Vivek
