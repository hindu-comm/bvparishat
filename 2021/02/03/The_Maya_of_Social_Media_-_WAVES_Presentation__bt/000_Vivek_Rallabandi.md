My humble *pranams*to the esteemed scholars on this platform.

  

I wanted to share a particularly striking presentation that I viewed (Please find it at[https://youtu.be/jr7cK0EtWO8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr7cK0EtWO8)), given as part of the World Association of Vedic Studies (WAVES) 2020 conference, youth segment.The presentation, given by a high school student, is entitled "Unraveling The Maya of Social Media and Entertainment Platforms" and uses an *Advaita Vedanta*lens to examine the effects of social media on Hindu American youth. The presentation's application of *vedantic* concepts - *maya,* the *arishadvargas,* and the *manas* -in the context of a very contemporary issue - namely social media - is extremely advanced and effective.

  

As the presenter notes, there is a paucity of research on this topic, and there is more research that needs to be done using other *vedantic* lenses on these topics also. As such, I am sharing the presentation here for the viewing of the esteemed scholars in *vedanta* and other disciplines and would respectfully request them to examine it.
