Dear friends,

I did my 5000 year survey with ten anchor points yesterday.

We are planning to seek funds from the National endowment

of the Arts for a video documentary for education. I can share

the slides if anybody would have the time to review and offer  

me feedback. We go through  

Yājñavalkya, S'rīkṛṣṇa, Mahāvīra, Buddha, Kauṭalya, Pāṇini, Vālmīki, Vyāsa, S'aṅkara, Kabīr  

The slides would be distributed through our site in a couple of months.

It was tiring to go through the massive texts, but I am happy that it is done.

It is a thirty year project for me!

Regards,

Bijoy Misra
