For some time now I have been seeking the Sanskrit text of Sri Madhvacharya's commentary on the Katha-upanishad. I have not found it at Archive.org, etc. Nagesh D. Sonde has kindly made available online his English translation of it that includes the Sanskrit text. The old and rare Katha Upanishad Vedeshu Bhikshu Tika that Ajit Gargeshwari-ji kindly uploaded to Archive.org includes the bhashya in footnotes. But the text of the bhashya in these two publications does not seem to always agree. So I am still seeking a book that gives just the Sanskrit text of Sri Madhvacharya's commentary on the Katha-upanishad. Any leads would be appreciated.

  

Thanks,
