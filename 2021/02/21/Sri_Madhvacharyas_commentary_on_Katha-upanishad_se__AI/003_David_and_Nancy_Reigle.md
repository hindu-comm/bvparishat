Many thanks to Sri Siva Prasad-ji for the link to the very helpful Sri Madhvacharya website from which I downloaded the needed commentary. Many thanks to Sri Gargeshwari-ji for the very helpful references and link. I had not thought of searching for Sri Madhvacharya's collected works under the title, Sarva mula, or Sarva moola, as in the post sent by Sri Paturi-ji only a few hours before my inquiry. I have downloaded another good edition of the needed commentary as found in this set of collected writings. The help from both of you is much appreciated.

  

Best regards,
