Some pertinent issues have been raised by Sri Gargeswari.

  

There is a dire need of an army of scholars well versed in  

reading the various scripts in which these mss. are written.

  

This may require a decent honorarium to be paid to the scholars who teach the scripts,

and some stipend for those who wish to learn. Rather than rest content with

some youtube videos that can teach the scripts (or providing good scan of mss. in addition)  

\- which no doubt can augment the cause - an all-India institutional infrastructure,  

whereby batches of trained scholars are turned out  

every year on a regular basis - indeed constitutes a key desideratum.

  

Knowledge of scripts coupled with scholarship in the particular field(s)

alone can yield worthy results.
