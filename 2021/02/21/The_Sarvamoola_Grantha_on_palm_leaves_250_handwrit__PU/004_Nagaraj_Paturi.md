Dear Sri Vishal Agarwal-ji,

  

<https://sripalimarumatha.org/tattwa-samshodhana-samsat>  

  

has a catalogue maintained in its library.

  

During my visit to it during our BVP conference, researchers at Tattwa Samshodhana Samsat they told me that they were finalizing the digitization of it.

  

Any members connected to the research body may be able to provide more information.

  

Regards,

  

Nagaraj
