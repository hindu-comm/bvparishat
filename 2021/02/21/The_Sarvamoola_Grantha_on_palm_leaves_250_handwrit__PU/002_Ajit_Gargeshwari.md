Most of the manuscripts belonging to Asta Mathas have been digitized . I don't think they have published or made available a list of Manuscripts they have digitized.

Tara Prakashana is involved in digitizing palm leaf manuscripts. Dr P R Mukund is the founder trustee of Tara Prakashana

I don't Know how many scholars can read Tigalari Sanskrit manuscripts. Reading Tigalari will be a key step towards documenting these old fragile manuscripts

Manuscriptologists and scholars who are involved in preparing critical editions will be able to inform if The oldest manuscript is always the most reliable manuscript towards a critical edition of a text and can that form the basis to claim authenticity of a given edition.
