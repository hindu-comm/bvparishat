Dear Sir,  
  
Thank you for sharing the links. I had tried searching earlier. After going through the abovementioned threads, I still couldn't find a source for the verse on puṇya and pāpa. The previous threads do solve the issue of finding the source of another verse (=ब्रह्मसत्यं जगन्मिथ्या जीवो ब्रह्मैव नापरः), the first half of which is identical to one of the variants of the verses on puṇya-pāpa (=श्लोकार्धेन प्रवक्ष्यामि यदुक्तं ग्रन्थकोटिभिः).  
  
Anyway, thanks again and I shall keep looking for it.
