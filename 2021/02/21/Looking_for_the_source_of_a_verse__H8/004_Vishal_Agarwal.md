Please check Tattvashuddhi of Jnanaghanapada - that is where I recall having seen it. The author was a grand disciple of Shri Sureshvaracharya - and so this is a very ancient Advaita treatise. Note that it also quotes Brahma Upanishad, Maitrayaniya Upanishad etc that were left out by Shankara Bhagavatpada.
