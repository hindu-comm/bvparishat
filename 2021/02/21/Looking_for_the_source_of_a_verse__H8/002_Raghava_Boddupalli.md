अष्टादश पुराणेषुव्यासस्य वचनद्वयम् ।  
परोपकार: पुण्यायपापाय परपीडनम् ।।  
(सुभाषितानि)  
  
It can attributed to Maharshi Veda Vyas. As in all the 18 Puranas, only two messages of Maharshi Veda Vyas hold prominence. Doing favour to others is the 'Punya' and Giving troubles to others is the 'Paap'.

  

Noble sayings (सुभाषितानि) collected from many ancient Indian Scriptures written by our great sages thousand years ago. They are quite relevant even today as they were in ancient time in our society. - Sri R.K. Chaturvedi
