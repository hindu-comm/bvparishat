**Automatic Gamakam insertion**

'Gaayaka' (part of Rasika package) will play exactly the notation that is entered. To get realistic music the notation has to include details of nuances ('Gamakam'). Notation used in Carnatic Music is generally skeletal and the nuances are filled in by the performer. Along with the Gaayaka program included in Rasika package, sample files are given where these nuances are notated. It is difficult to write detailed notation for nuances and so an attempt has been made to programmatically generate the detailed notation including the nuances based on the ragam's characteristics for 16 ragams.
