Sure

  

Index Verborum to the Published Text of the Atharva-Veda 1881

<https://books.google.ru/books/about/Index_Verborum_to_the_Published_Text_of.html>

is a very well-made work. I mean a .txt file to work with.

  

88837 lines of The electronic version of Maurice Bloomfield's A Vedic Concordance, Baltimore, Mass. 1906 seems to bee the biggest list of padas and still not a word-index.

  

•hvayāmi sarvā oṣadhīḥ # AVP.2.63.3c.

•hvayāmy agniṃ prathamaṃ svastaye # RV.1.35.1a. P: hvayāmy agnim AŚ.7.7.3. Cf. BṛhD.3.105.

•hvayāmy ugraṃ cettāram # AVŚ.6.99.1c.

•hvāro na vakvā jaraṇā anākṛtaḥ # RV.1.141.7b.

•hvāro na śucir yajate haviṣmān # RV.1.180.3d.

  

A VEDIC WORD-CONCORDANCE (Vishva Bandhu) as a .txt seems to be what I need - at least the headword list.  

  

Thanks,

Marcis
