Namaste Ajit Ji,

  

My apologies for the late reply, as I was away from email for the last three days. Yes, the translation of the Skanda-purana that I am inquiring about is the one that has more recently been published by Motilal Banarsidass in their Ancient Indian Tradition and Mythology series. The front matter in these volumes show dates from 1950-1960, as when it was originally published, but they do not say who translated it. I wondered if the original 1950-1960 publication showed the name of the translator. I have not been able to find these original volumes.

  

The more recent AITM volumes, by the way, comprise 23 volumes altogether (AITM vols. 49-71), rather than just the 20 volumes available for free download at the [holybooks.com](http://holybooks.com) site, presumably from Archive.org, and ultimately from Digital Library of India.

  

Best regards,

  

David Reigle

Colorado, U.S.A.
