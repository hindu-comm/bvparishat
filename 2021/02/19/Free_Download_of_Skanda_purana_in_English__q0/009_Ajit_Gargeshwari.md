People upload scanned books which are out of copywrite but many don't acknowledge the original scanner .I have not seen many thanking DLI, googlebooks uploafers on archives who upload free of cost for scholars or readers to read. All want services for nothing but when their work has been quoted without acknowledgement many authors make a big fuss.
