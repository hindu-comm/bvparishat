A good many publishers of Sanskrit books have not shown good care in

recording publication history - in order to conceal, possibly, info wrt copyright.

Authorship is sometimes attributed even to "A Board of Scholars"

also perhaps for the same reason.

  

Sometimes their publication history commences with :  

First Indian Edition: xxxx etc.

Many lack even the year of publication. In some only the Foreword has the date!  

  

It is sad that even some famous publishers have resorted to such ruses.

There should be some Publishers' Association that sets proper norms for these,

or an appropriate Govt. body should set norms for the requisite details and their sequence

in the Technical Page/Copyright Page as it is called.

  

Lack of uniformity shows in Western publishers also, incldg university publications.

  

A universal standard format is thus a desideratum, which should also facilitate proper citation.
