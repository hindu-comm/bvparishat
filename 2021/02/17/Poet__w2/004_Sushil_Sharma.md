Namaste Prof. Deshpande,

  

Please pardon my धृष्टता, but did you mean to write that you changed it to "वपुषा स्थितोऽपि निकटे..." ?  

The issue being जगण not allowed at विषम चातुर्मात्रिक positions in आर्या, changing it to "स्थितोऽपि निकटे वपुषा..." would only move the problem from the 3rd गण to the 1st without actually fixing it. Right?  

\[Perhaps the veteran professor just wanted to check whether the readers were paying attention... :-)\]  

  

Regards,

Sushil
