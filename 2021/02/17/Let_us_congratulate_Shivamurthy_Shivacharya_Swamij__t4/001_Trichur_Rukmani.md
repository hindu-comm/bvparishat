Swamiji I wonder if you remember me (T.S.Rukmani from Concordia University, Montreal). We have interacted at various SKT conferences and I remember your critical observationsat the grammar sessions. I want to pay my respects and congratulate you for this well deserved award.

Welive in Bangalore these days.
