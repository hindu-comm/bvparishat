Radhakrishna ji,

  

I have seen the Yukio Ohashi paper presents the shadow-based time measurement from the (so called) आथर्वणज्यौतिषं sequenced along with that of शार्दूलकर्णावदानम् ।

And I see you have taken this as a Vedanga, which I had not considered earlier. I am curious to know if this book was traditionally considered as a Vedanga text ?

  

Incidentally, the editor of the मूलम् of the आथर्वणज्यौतिषं text, Bhagavad Dutta of Lahore (1924) thought otherwise. I quote from his introduction -

  

"At the end of the work the writer calls this text by the name of "आत्मज्योतिषम्" XIV.II. I have, however, given it the title of Atbarvaņa jyotişa, as in harmony with the already known Arca jyotişa and the Yajuşa jyotişa's.

.. Nothing can be said with definitness on these points. Concerned only with the Atma jyotişa for the time being, as we are, we can say, that although mainly agreeing with type (a), it still shows a small difference, nowhere else to be found.

How arose this difference is a question for the astronomer to settle. We can only say that the present text is related more to the Dharmasastras, than to jyotişa proper.  

.. this Atma jyotişa, compiled according to the notions of his own age, which may be very recent. The text of this Atma jyotişa is not very old may also be in ferred from another fact. Atma jyotişa VII. 6 says :

ज्योतिःशाखप्रयुक्तानां कर्मणां फलदं भवेत् ॥

These jyotişa treatises are very recent. Hence the work quoting them, cannot be very old. Again Atma jyotişa IX.1 states:

अल्पग्रन्थं महार्थं च प्रवक्ष्यामि भृगोर्मतम् ॥

The context shows that here also the neo-Bhrguism is referred to and not the old one. All these things put together strengthen the view that the treatise is not a very old one."
