.. I am curious to know of the reference in Vedangas for this. (The शुल्बसूत्राणि do mention the use of शङ्कुः but my understanding is that it is only to determine the directions, and not for the measurement of time.)

  

There was a recent post about another (older?) technique used in the measurement of time in Ancient India. You may find it interesting<https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/TdoTQ5Y15kc/m/nyz-FZwXAAAJ>

  

Regards,
