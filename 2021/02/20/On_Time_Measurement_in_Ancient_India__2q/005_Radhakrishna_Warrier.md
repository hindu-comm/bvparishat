Thank youRupali ji, it was quite informative. Although the language is Marathi, I was surprised that I could understand a good part of it.
Because the script is Devanagari, I could easily read it. The many Sanskrit words made understanding easier. Deviating a little from the topic of this thread, Sanskrit tatsama and even tadbhava content in Indian languages increase their mutual intelligibility. Contrast this with Urdu. Urdu at the common man's level is fairly intelligible for me. But when it is spoken formally, as in TV and news, I cannot understand even half of it. Even when widely used, easily understood Sanskrit-tadbhava Hindustani words are available, formal Urdu uses Persian and Arabic words in their place. Nowadays the trend is to discard even Persian words and use Arabic instead ("Allah Hafiz" instead of the widely used "Khuda Hafiz"). And this makes Urdu still harder to understand.
