Here is my Facebook post on "Spring forward, fall back". 🙂

Last weekend, I was explaining to someone what “spring forward fall back” is; that we advance our clocks one hour just before spring and then, in mid-autumn, we set it back one hour to standard time. That set me thinking – how did people tell time when there were no clocks around? I did not sit idly thinking about it. Just did a little reading up.
So, here is the result of my online, armchair (actually couch) research on the topic and my drawing skills (or the lack of it) using the “paint” app.

People relied on the Sun to tell time in the olden days. The ancient Chhāyā Yantra, or the “shadow machine” used the shadow cast by a gnomon to measure time. Measurement of time using gnomons is mentioned in the hoary Vedāṅga-s (“limbs of the Veda”). Some trigonometry is involved in deciphering time from the shadow, but our ancient astronomers handled the trigonometry quite well. Let me add that decades ago, I made a few garden sundials but let a computer do the math and draw the dials. That hobby project was a good exercise for my software skills as a budding engineer, although I never became a software developer but remained a hardcore hardware electronics engineer. 😊.

Gnomons continued to be used even as late as the time of the construction of Jantar Mantar-s in different parts of India in the early 1700’s CE. The Jantar Mantar-s incorporate giant gnomons. The photos show the Jantar Mantar-s of New Delhi and Jaipur (Wikipedia/Wikimedia photos: <https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Jantar_Mantar_Delhi_27-05-2005.jpg> , and <https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Jaipur%2C_India.jpg>).
The gnomons are the big, triangular structures seen in the photos. The “Jantar” in Jantar Mantar is from Sanskrit “yantra” meaning machine or mechanism. Mantar is Sanskrit “mantra” meaning sacred words, magical incantations, calculation, etc. So, Jantar Mantar can mean mystery machine, or more prosaically, mechanism for measurement \[of time\]. 

How do you tell time when the Sun is behind clouds, or when it is night? Various types of water clocks, such as the Nālikā Yantra and the Ghaṭikā Yantra were in use from the very ancient times. Nālikā means a tube. The Nālikā Yantra tells time based on the outflow of water from the tube through a narrow outlet near its bottom. “Ghaṭikā” means a small pot or a bowl. The Ghaṭikā Yantra consists of a vessel of water in which floats a small bowl with a hole in the bottom. Time measurement is based on when the bowl gets filled up enough to sink.
Interestingly, a unit of time of 24 minutes duration (one-sixtieth of a day) is called both “nālikā” and “ghaṭikā” after the instrument used for measuring it. Ghaṭikā (or its alternate form ghaṭī) became ghaḍī in Hindi while nālikā became nāẓhika in my mother tongue.

Ancient astronomical works like the Sūryasiddhānta mention Rēṇugarbha (sand vessel) as an instrument for measuring time. This can be considered an ancestor of the hourglass. The hourglass in the shape we know today came in wide use much later, probably by the 13^(th) century CE. Mechanical clocks started appearing from the 15^(th) century CE.

The water clock was the basic mechanism for some of the complex astronomical instruments developed by ancient Indian astronomers.
āryabhaṭa (476 – 550 CE) constructed an interesting machine to demonstrate the daily rotation of the earth. It worked on the principle of the tubular water clock. In his mechanism, a wooden globe representing the Earth completes one full rotation in 24 hours, and the tubular water clock that drives it shows the time on the tube which is graduated in nālikā-s.

When did the concept of “standard time” arise? In India, in ancient times, the standard time used to be based on the meridian (longitude) of the city of Ujjayini (modern Ujjain.) Like Greenwich being the prime meridian of today, the meridian of Ujjayini was the prime meridian of ancient India. Till even a hundred years ago, the Indian pañchāṅga (religious calendar) used to be prepared with reference to the meridian of Ujjayini. Ancient Indian astronomers calculated fairly accurately the difference in time between Ujjayini and far-flung places like Romaka (Rome) and Yavanapuri (“the city of the Greeks”).

Happy “spring forward” after three weeks, and happy spring after four weeks! 😊
