In October, we solicited short story submissions for an anthology on lesser known characters of the Mahabharata. We have been delighted at the outpouring of wonderful stories received, spanning so many characters and incidents across the ocean of wisdom that is the Mahabharata, penned by talented writers and passionate enthusiasts of the Mahabharata. The hardest part was having to choose just 15 entries out of all of many submissions we received.

Following up on the spectacular success of the first Indic Academy Anthology curated by Saiswaroopa Iyer,*Unsung Valour*, about lesser known battles of the Mahabharata, we are looking forward to the launch of this anthology in 2021.
