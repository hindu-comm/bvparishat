Esteemed Colleagues,

  

I’m happy to announce the publication of my new book,*Tracing the Path of Yoga: The History and Philosophy of Indian Mind-Body Discipline*(SUNY Press: 2021)*.*It has been a labor of love and it’s great to finally send it out into the world.

If you are interested, you may use the code ZAPE21 on the SUNY website to receive a 50% discount on the hardcover. The code will be good through February 16th, 2021. It’s available for Kindle on Amazon and will be released as a more affordable paperback this summer.

  

Needless to say, I couldn’t have put this together without relying on the excellent work (and encouragement) of so many of you. I hope that some may find it of interest/use!

  

Best Wishes,

Stuart
