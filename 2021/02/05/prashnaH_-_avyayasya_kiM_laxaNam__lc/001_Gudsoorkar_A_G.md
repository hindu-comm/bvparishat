Dr Gasūns,

1\. Could you get any inf in detail about the reqd book? Are there only 22 Upasargas in total. I feel there are more. Pl enlighten

  

2\. I am interested to learn more about उपसर्गs. I have “उपसर्गार्थचंद्रिका” by Charudev Shastri. It is with Sanskrit commentary. I need English or Hindi commentary. If possible, pl guide. Is there any separate book on निपात and अव्यय also?
