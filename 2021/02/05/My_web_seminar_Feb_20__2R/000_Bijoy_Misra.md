Dear friends,

Good morning.

I give below a summary of my effort for the seminar "Then Thought Leaders from India"

to be hosted by India Discovery Center. This is the first of several bimonthly seminars  

in a general stream of India cultural outreach to the world.  

  

I weave a connected story of India's thought evolution from the ancient times to the present  

by using ten anchor points. We start with the early discovery of mind as functioning tool  

from very old times compiled by Yajnavalkya through the Brihadaranyaka Upanisad. We  

move to SriKrishna as a historical reference having introduced yoga which again possibly  

had its empirical rooting. Mahavira mapped the universe through mathematical calculations  

by declaring the finiteness of the observations and the Buddha tried to map the human  

conduct through interactions and relationships. Kautilya compiled books on regulations  

of social conduct with a vision to create a stable operational society and Panini codified regulations in grammar to create a stable operational speech. Vyasa is honored to be the  

person who compiled the existing legends to create an epic to help analyze conflicts in  

society in its success and failures, and we celebrate Valmiki for the operational handbook  

for the living of a righteous man in modern society by characterizing the significance of  

women in their multiple roles. The ascetic Shankara declared the unity of life in the universe through analytic reasoning while the humble Kabir extended unity to thoughts and beliefs by composing populist lyrics and communicating to the masses  

  

We meet Saturday, Feb 20, 9:30 AM Boston time (8 PM India time) . The seminar  

will be free and virtual through Zoom. You can register by sending mail to **[idcin...@gmail.com]().**

A Zoom link will be distributed Feb 18.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
