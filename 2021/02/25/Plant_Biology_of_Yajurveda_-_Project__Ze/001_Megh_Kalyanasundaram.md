Namaste Dr. Boddupalli-ji,

  

Many congratulations!

This appears, to me, to be a very differentiated contribution addressing what I sense as a gaping void in the related literature.

Thank you for sharing what you did today.

I look forward to the full book with keen interest.

Allow me here to add that a part of your work—'*Project Report: Plant Biology of Yajurveda'* \[2019, IJHS 54(2)\]—was very timely, useful and cited in (p. 14 of) a recent paper*[Landscape in the Nāṭyaśāstra and clues to its spatial origin: A study in 2019](https://www.academia.edu/44300252/Landscape_in_the_N%C4%81%E1%B9%ADya%C5%9B%C4%81stra_and_clues_to_its_spatial_origin_A_study_in_2019)*(forthcoming in IGNCA-*Samikshika;*[previous thread in BVP](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/u1RMBcMMtJE/m/1sWpfnZaAgAJ)).

Your work contributed to the possibility of a richer multi-disciplinary engagement, for which I am grateful.🙏

With best wishes.

  

Sincerely,  

Megh
