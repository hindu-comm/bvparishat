Dear ALL,

  

Namaste!

  

I, Dr. Raghava S. Boddupalli, basically a scientist from Bangalore, wanted to share the following with you ALL. I have studied the Yajurveda Taittiriya Samhita, Brahmana and Aranyanka under guru Brahmasri Vedam Venkata Rama Sastry, Bangalore.

  

The Indian National Science Academy (INSA), New Delhi, awarded a project titled, **'Plant Biology of Yajurveda'** during 2017 to 2019. I have submitted the project report to INSA that contains 700 pages. In this report the use of plants, trees, crops and other plant substances in various rituals, as magical and also as medicinal plants that are described in the Yajurveda are comprehensively discussed with Veda mantras (provided in Devanagari and Roman Diacritic languages). Presently, the INSA is trying to publish this report as book.

  

I am herewith enclosing the title and back pages with contents of the report, for your perusal.

  

With best regards,

Raghava Boddupalli, PhD
