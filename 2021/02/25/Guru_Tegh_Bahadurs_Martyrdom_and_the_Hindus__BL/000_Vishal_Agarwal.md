My article on martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadur has appeared at the link below.

  

<https://www.indiafacts.org.in/commentary/did-their-guru-tegh-bahadur-save-our-hindu-dharma/>  

  

It looks at the evidence from Dasham Granth, Pracheen Panth Prakash, Panth Prakash, Gur Pratap Suraj Granth, Panda Vahis, Padshah Buranji (from Assam) and so on.
