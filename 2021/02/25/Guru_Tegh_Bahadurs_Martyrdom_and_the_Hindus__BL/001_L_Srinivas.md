It's an excellent article. The current trend of false narration of medieval Indian history - both by secular historians and by modern sectarian Sikhs - can only be contested by resorting to contemporary sources such as the Persian sources and the records of priests in the holy places in northern India. Sri Agarwal has used such original sources to reconstruct some aspects of the history of Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur which he discusses in this paper. In this, he has shown the way which can be followed by others.

  

My namaskars to Sri Agarwal who has rendered yeoman service to the community with his writings.
