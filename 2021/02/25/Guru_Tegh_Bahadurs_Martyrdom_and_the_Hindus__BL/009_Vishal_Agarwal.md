Namaskar! Thank you for your comments. I do not have access to the article - could you send me a copy offline?

  

I am not very familiar with the Baul tradition. But your remarks about the Natha and Sikh connection is very true. The Dohas and other writings of Gorakhnath read exactly like the writings of Guru Nanak, whose compositions are full of Nath Yogi imagery (although some terms have different emphasis). In a work that I am writing, I will be including Gorakhbabi and Kulzam Swarup passages (of Mahamati Prannath) side by side with Sikh Guru's writings.

  

Like the Sikhs, the Naths and Sants also emphasize 'shabad', 'Satgur' etc etc. The Naths did not give much importance to Murti Pooja, they had communal eating kitchens and they rejected varna-jati distinctions. All these have continued into Sikhism. Punjab was a stronghold of Nath Panth and our elders tell us of the fairs and shrines associated with them at Sialkot and Jhelum (Jogi Bala Tilla) that they abandoned in 1947. Guru Nanak's eldest son Baba Shrichand founded the Udasi sampradaya (today they call themselves Hindus) which has continued numerous Nath traditions within their school like the Dhuni and so on. The pot containing Guru Nanak's ashes was buried (not dispersed in a river). After the original site was washed away by floods around 1550 CE, Baba Shri Chand had it excavated and then reburied the pot in the village of Dera Baba Nanak which is today in Gurdaspur district. That shrine is outside of SGPC control and still retains some its ancient Hindu features.
