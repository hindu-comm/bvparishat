An excellent article, Vishal-ji! If I may, I think this may be of additional interest:<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0048721X8090038X>

  

When looked at *with respect to* other traditions such as the Nathas and the Yogis, the Sikhi tradition doesn't actually look that dissimilar from the Hindu traditions at all. I spent the last year studying the Sahajiya tradition in Bengal (who are historically connected with the Nathas and Yogis) both in their Buddhist (Vajrayana) and their Hindu (Baul) forms, and it struck me that (a) it was quite similar to the Sikhs as well, and (b) that despite how we characterize it (Bauddha Vajrayana or Hindu Baul), there is a strong undercurrent of identity. There are obvious differences, of course, but on many levels, they actually are talking about a similar set of ideas, a very similar system of reverence for the guru and the parampara, and a near-identical conviction in the non-duality of existence. It seems to be that over certain historical periods, they chose to label or identify themselves with overarching identities (or were/are labelled as such), but the inner form of the spiritual tradition rarely changed significantly. The pre-Khalsa Sikhi tradition is very much in the Hindu fold, so to speak. The post-Khalsa did nonetheless seem to have a newer and more distinctive identity of its own - and this is something that your article brings out nicely. In context, for the honorable MP to say that 'our' people protected 'your' people is to reveal a poor understanding of the Indic traditions in general, and a narrow understanding of her 'own'.
