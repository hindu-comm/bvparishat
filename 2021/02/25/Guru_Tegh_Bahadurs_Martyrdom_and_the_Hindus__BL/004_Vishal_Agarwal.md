Thank you for your kind remarks. An additional source that I forgot to incorporate was the Bansawalinama of Kuir Singh in which he says this about Guru Gobind Singh:  
  

Hindūate mai uh panth chalai hai \| turukan nās karai sukh pai hai \|\|He was born among the Hindus and will find joy in the destruction of the Turks.

  

So even though Kuir Singh insisted that Khalsa was a third religion, he acknowledged that Guru Gobind Singh was born to Hindu parents.

  

In my article, I refrained intentionally from referencing Persian sources because they tend to be very demeaning and disrespectful towards the Sikh Gurus (with a few exceptions). Of course, the modern trend amongst some Sikh scholars is to claim that Babar's house lasted in India due to the blessings of Guru Nanak and then got destroyed when they killed Guru Arjan and Guru Tegh Bahadur!

It's an excellent article. The current trend of false narration of medieval Indian history - both by secular historians and by modern sectarian Sikhs - can only be contested by resorting to contemporary sources such as the Persian sources and the records of priests in the holy places in northern India. Sri Agarwal has used such original sources to reconstruct some aspects of the history of Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur which he discusses in this paper. In this, he has shown the way which can be followed by others.

Hindūate mai uh panth chalai hai \| turukan nās karai sukh pai hai \|\|

He was born among the Hindus and will find joy in the destruction of the Turks.

  

My namaskars to Sri Agarwal who has rendered yeoman service to the community with his writings.
