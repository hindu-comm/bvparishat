Yes, this is the set of verses called Sadd and are written by Baba Sudar Das, a descendant of Guru Amardas through his son Mohri. They were written at the request of Guru Arjan himself.

  

Pandit Kesho Gopal Ji was a favorite of Guru Amar Das Bhalla Ji (incidentally, his descendants live in my city and are friends with us and they openly acknowledge the Granth to be Vedantic in their conversations with us, and invite me whenever they sponsor Langar, and put on a white turban on me when I enter). Pandit Kesho Bhatt gave pravachans on behalf of the Guru in the afternoon.

  

According to Mehma Prakash Kavita/Varatak, Guru Amar Das Ji requested that at his death, the Pandit should be invited to do Hari Nam Jap and Hari Katha, and that he this will suffice for all the cremation ceremonies as he was going to meet with Hari - so no ceremonies were needed and no one should mourn either.

  

As you mention, Sikhs/MacAuliffe today totally misinterpret these verses and say that it means, "Do not call Pandits for my funeral, only call my Keshav Gopal" (which they explain as Waheguru or Akal Purakh). Of course, this translation is just ridiculous nor is the Sadd a 'rejection' of Hindu funeral ceremonies as the woke like to explain today. It merely re-emphasizes what is given in other Hindu scriptures (e.g. Paingala Upanishad) that funeral ceremonies are not required for a Brahmagyaani.

  

Much of the translation of the Guru Granth these days is really absurd - it does not even follow the oldest Tika (Faridkoti Tika) which is now dismissed as too Hindu/Vedantic. One sees a random change of subject-predicate, gender, number, insertions of 'do not', wrong translations and what not.

  

Baba Sundar Das was a kid at the time of Guru Amar Das demise whose sons Mohan an Mohri initially opposed the succession of Guru Ram Das (son in law of Guru Amar Das) but Morhi soon reconciled and then played a constructive role in the next Guru Arjan's accession. The hymn emphasizes the supportive role of Mohri. And it is obvious that Baba Sundar Das was writing the hymn from family traditions, as one cannot expect that a six year old kid wrote the Sadd and gave it to Guru Ram Das. The other son Mohan proved a bit problematic and initially refused to part with the Mohan Pothis compiled by Guru Amar Das (with the assistance of a Brahman) - this story and details are too well known to be reiterate but some modern Sikhs even dismiss it as a concoction despite evidence to the contrary - to project Sikhism as a unique unaltered revelation.

  

Your attachment also refers to the hymn of six verses by Guru Ramdas on the pilgrimage of Guru Amar Das Ji to Kurukshetra and Haridwar. According to that hymn, the pilgrimage was taken during a solar eclipse under Abhijeet Nakshatra. If you google, this happened only two times during Guru Amar Das' reign - in 1553 and then around 1572 or so. According to Sikh histories, the pilgrimage was taken after Akbar captured Chittor and visited Goindwal on way to Lahore. So the first date is ruled out because the Emperor was then Islam Shah, son of Sher Shah Suri, and Humanyun had not even returned from Iran. Modern Sikh writers also argue that Guru Amar Das was exempted from pilgrimage tax because he was distinguished from Hindus. But Akbar had already cancelled the pilgrimage tax much before 1572. Moreover, the verses talk of toll tax for crossing river Yamuna, not pilgrim tax at Kurukshetra or Haridwar, which is clear when the verses are read - they talk only of taxes while cross Yamuna (where there was no pilgrimage center) and Ganga, and do not talk of any tax being forgiven when the Guru and his entourage was actually at Kurukshetra or at Haridwar. Of course, some Sikh scholars today try to place the pilgrimage during the earlier date to argue that Guru Amar Das was specially exempted the Pilgrimage Tax but forget the connection of Akbar in the tradition with this pilgrimage.

  

Furthermore, the account of Guru Ramdas is virtually eye witness account of the pilgrimage. In 1552, he would have been 18 years old. Why would he write a hymn on a pilgrimage for 21 years after he became the Guru? In reality, this was Guru Amar Das pilgrimage to Haridwar (as he had done numerous times in his first 70 years of life) and soon passed away thereafter at the age of 95.
