Opportunity to learn fundamentals of Buddhism:

One might ask, why should I know Buddhism?

  

Vedanta and Buddhism have influenced each other for more than thousand years (roughly since 500 BCE). Knowing the fundamentals of Buddhism will be valuable for a Vedanta Student. Many people may think that they know Buddhism. However, learning from an expert provides one with a thorough and interesting overview.

  

1\) Buddhism has challenged Vedanta in several ways; those perspectives can strengthen a person's understanding of Vedanta. Personally, I have found these interactions between Vedanta and Buddhism to be very interesting.  

  

2\) Professor Hebbar is teaching this course. I have known Prof Hebbar for a long time. He is an excellent teacher. **This course is offered by VaYU (Vivekananda Yoga University, Los Angeles, CA)**
