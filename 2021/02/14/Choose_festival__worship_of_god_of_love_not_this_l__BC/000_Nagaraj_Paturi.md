Holi as Kaamotsava: The age old Hindu festival of Love  

  

It is celebrated by all, irrespective of whether they are or are not lovers or couples married through love affairs. Boys and girls, in love or not in love, couples married through love marriages or arranged marriages, young or old, or for that matter spinsters, bachelors, people with a wide range of sexual orientations and gender identities, all celebrate it.  

  

Kaamotsava was a pan-Indian festival deeply enshrined in the Indic roots such as Vedas, Puranas and classical Sanskrit and other literatures. Our Holi/Kaamotsava/Vasantotsava is a true festival of love, a participation in natureâ€™s seasonal changes and a celebration of one of our purushaarthas.
