I would humbly suggest that India should celebrate "Vasant Kamotsava" on the Valentine Day itself. Just do it the Indian way. Give flower garlands to you beloved, clothes, jewelry and sweets. Send music CDs, pen drives and pics.

Would prefer it to be earthy and rajasic. It is just a matter of offering an alternative fun day with desi trappings.
