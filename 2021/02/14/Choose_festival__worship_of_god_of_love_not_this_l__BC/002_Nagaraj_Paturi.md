Yes, its a good enquiry,aayushmaanPrasad.

  

I think you will take time to see if there is a mention of Kama temple in plays like Mricchakatikam.

  

if there is a mention of Madanotsava falling in the Vasanta ritu in plays like Maalateemaadhavam

  

if there is a mention of puja to Madana deva in Maalateemaadhavam

  

if there is a mention of a procession related to an utsava related to Kama in Mrichhakatikam

  

if there are romantic folk songs of Kaamudu, Kaantakka sung at least in Telangana on the occasion of Kaamuni punnama

  

Does the story of burning Kaama by Shiva end just in that burning or are there further developments in that narrative ?

  

Was Kaama Deva revived to life or not in that narrative?

  

Should the celebration of colors be seen as celebration for Kaama getting burnt for good or can there be any other meaning for

the celebration ?

  

Is the word Panduga in Telugu habba in Kannada pandugaiin Tamil in Kaamuni Panduga, Kamannana habba, Kaaman Pandugai in reference to the happiness , celebration that the bad fellow called Kaama got burnt for good or should there be some other meaning for that festivity /happiness indicating word ?

  

You seem to use the word 'materialistic' in an abhorring/pejorative tone towards Kaama as something bad /negative.

  

Is such an attitude traditional ?

  

Hope, you will ponder over.

  

Yes, scholars of the list may also help you ponder over.
