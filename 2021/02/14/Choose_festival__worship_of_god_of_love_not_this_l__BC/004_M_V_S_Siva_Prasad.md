Sir ,

  

My words towards the materialistic is towards this valentines day issue not to the kamadeva.

  

The purpose of kama utsava discussion here is due to the presence of valentines day but not as the Kama purushartha.

  

I preferred the Karana as primary concern rather than the concept.

  

Having those types of discussions in the time of valentines day definitely rises an alarm to others that india also has these types of traditions which is absolutely wrong.

  

The traditional concept of kama or the kama deva can't be intercepted with the valentines day issue.

That's my concern.

  

And coming to the further developments in the issue of kama deva.

  

After the Kama Dahanam a person in Pramatha Gana creates a sculpture and makes prana pratistha to that one and gives some powers too.

That person is known as Bhandasura according to the Brahmanda purana.

  

Actually from the ashes of kama deva Bhandasura was born who created the Kama Pralayam which ultimately lead to the Lalita devi avatara.

  

This is present in brahmanda purana i feel.

  

Your words of worshipping Kama deva is there in India.

  

As I know the KADI VIDYA of sri vidya tradition is from the kama deva
only.

  

My problem is not with the issue of kama deva or kama purushartha but comparision of purusharthas with the materialistic love on valentines day is really a concern for traditionality.

  

Even raising discussion of those topics on this valentines day is not necessary.

  

I feel those types of discussions to be avoided on controversial days later no problem.

  

Coming to the concepts specified in the Malati Madhava or other sahitya granthas we have to check what is their actual voice .

  

There are so many mis understandings in society some people celebrate Kojagara poornima on Ashvayuja purnima while some others celebrate it in Karthika purnima.

  

Gita Jayamti was on Ekadasi while the Mahabharata yuddha was started in Amavasya.

Instead of the real birth the gita jayamti was celebrated on the namakarana which generally happens on 10th or 11th day after the birth of child.

  

These types of issues are tone taken care by the honourable scholars like you otherwise the society definitely misunderstands it.

  

The topic is highly suitable for discussion but opening such type of discussion on the day of valentines day is really not good. It misleads normal people like me.

  

Sorry for inconvenience if any.

  

Thank you sir.
