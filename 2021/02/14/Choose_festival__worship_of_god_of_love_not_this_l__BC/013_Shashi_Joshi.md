Siva Prasad ji,

Thank you for your clarification.

  

Aesticismis not for all Ashrama, stages of life. There is undue stress on this one aspect of life.

Guided by spirituality is good, but then why are all our gods so luxuriously attired? Life is to be lived, before one attains rebirth or nirvANa. Vedas celebrate life.

  

Maybe Buddhism's fatalism and stress on sorrow in life has rubbed off on sanatani thinking post AdiShankara. And I apologise to anyone who may not like what I am saying, but I say with all due respect.

  

There were three puruShArtha to begin - dharma artha kAma !

MokSha comes only after doing these 3 properly. Hence, all three are given importance. Within the rules of dharma (social ethics, law, right conduct...) acquireartha (resources) and enjoy (kAma).

Exceptions are always there, but they don't make a rule.

  

India has always celebrated life in any and all dimensions! Look at food, clothes, music, customs, important events of life (16 of them!!) ...

Nothing is boxed in, except to not hurt or encroach on other's aspirations as well.

  

Valentine itself has a murky history.

Now that it is being celebrated due to card companies marketing, and youth like if there is a day for celebrating love, we must accept that and provide Indian context and help them celebrate it with Indian context.

  

And for "Chinmaya Mission having a workshop to teach what's love ??", I think that is a must, for all!

  

Why are all missions only focused on dvaita-advaita-vishishtadvaita hair-splitting? And about life after death; while ignoring life before death? Life is all encompassing. Don't we have great sculptures right in front of our temples? (I am not talking Khajuraho, even ordinary temples)

  

Body is pratyakSha, we can't ignore it. Body is the instrument for all things.

Even the shAntipATha says - namaste vAyoH \| tvameva pratyakSham brahmAsi\| (The perceptible brahman) Similarly, the body is perceptible reality. Not sat, but a satyam.

  

The entire kAmashAstra exists because our ancestors didn't shun from anything or consider anything bad. But, the idea is to never forget the bounds of dharma. That is the kabaddi court. Do whatever jumping around you want, but within the court :) :)

  

And, once again, apologies in advance if I transgressed anywhere.

All in good intention.

  
  

Thanks,  

\~ Shashi
