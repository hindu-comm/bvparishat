Joshi sir

  

   At first i felt too bad seeing such an article on the valentines day.

That's the main reason .

  

I studied in an RSS based school where we are taught to think the valentine day as a spoiler of society.

  

Honestly iam not against the kama purushartha . The kama purushartha with out dharma is nothing except the materialistic deed . I feel there is no dharma in the valentines day celebrations.

  

Does the valentine day serve any purpose.

  

I felt it is un necessary to discuss about the kama purushartha or such an article on the valentines day event.

  

It's like discussion of the India's sovereignity on the formation day of china.

  

Everyone knows that this valentine day highly different from the traditionalist celebrations may be the madanotsava or kaumudi purnima or else.

  

The issue of mine is these types of days are going deep into the indian society as like a slow poison. After some years every one may feel the valentines day as India's celebration like new year celebrations.

  

My issue is with that. If scholars start discussions on the kama purushartha on the valentines day .. what will be discussed on the madanotsava ? Or kaumudi purnima ? Definitely those days will be ignored even by scholars and ultimately leads a foreigner to show those days as degradations of indian culture .

Even scholars knows much more than me about these foreign writings negatively showing indian culture.

  

Chinmaya Mission having a workshop to teach what's love ??

Really I don't feel that missions with sanyasis have to respond to valentines day .

  

Is it necessary to that extent ?

  

I didn't felt well because of those and hence I replied like that.

  

At last i have to feel these type of articles and workshops as that

Then no problem for everyone.

  

Sorry for inconvenience if any.

  

Having discussions in the forum definitely increases my knowledge . Hence I said my opinion as I felt .

  

If iam harsh iam sorry to everyone.

Pardon me .

  

Thank you and sorry for inconvenience if any.
