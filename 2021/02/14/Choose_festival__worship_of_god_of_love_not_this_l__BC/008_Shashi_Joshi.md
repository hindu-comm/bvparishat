Siva Prasad ji,

I am unsure of why you used such a tone in your mail.

In Kamasutra, nAgaraka-vRitta-prakaraNam, it clearly mentions the various celebrations.

yakSha-rAtriH , kaumudI-jAgaraH , suvasantakaH.

The jayamangala tIkA expands on that.

False materialistic deeds?

  

kAma is not bad. Without it, the entire world of beings is impossible.

Even the Veda accepts kAmadeva to be the first born (and hence oldest devatA).

  

While it is not good to focus only on materialistic things with no rudder of spiritual or thoughtful conduct; it is equally wrong to detest it so much as to call it bad.

  

That too is unhealthy.

  

This may have been due to the over emphasis on philosophical and spiritual hair-splitting and mental gymnastics of the elite. To the point that niti and other practical things got neglected and we as a society started being fatalistic.

  

Even the AtmA is discussed through the instrumentsprovided by the body.

  

I am sorry if I sound harsh, but I am just expressing my view to balance the discussion.

  

  
  

Thanks,  

\~ Shashi
