Thanks, Prof. Kannan for your kind words and elaborate exposition of the issue.

  

On the one hand , we see an aggressive expression of opposition by some groups against those who participate in Valentine's day. On the other side, there is an exploitation of that situation as Hinduism's anti-mundane approach to life, Hinduism's opposition to love etc. This kind of manipulative projection of Hinduism based on some aggressive behaviour of some groups needs to be countered by bringing out the true stance of Hinduism towards issues such as love.

  

Such a right projection particularly can make Indian youngsters not hate their heritage and make sense of their own literary, cultural and religious heritage and can make them proud about their heritage.

  

Incidentally, these two occasions Valentine's day and Vasantotsava /Holi calendrically are very close to each other. I thought it is good to ask the youngster's to wait for Vasantotsava/Holi that is going to come very soon. Instead of angrily opposing some other'sevent, it is better to wait for our own and happily celebrate it.
