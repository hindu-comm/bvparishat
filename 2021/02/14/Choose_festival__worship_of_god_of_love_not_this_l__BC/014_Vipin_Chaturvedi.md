I may not be adding any thing but would humbly reiterate what Prof. Kannan mentioned earlier—a broader and a deeper word “Kaam” should be guided by both Dharma and Moksha. Different Aashramas give us ample opportunity for this. Also we have several examples as mentioned in this thread in our shastras where love has been glorified.
