Honestly as I know the Holi is known as Kama Dahana utsav.

  

Where the Manmadha turned into ashes by the third eye of shiva.

  

How it became a kamotsava ?

  

How a person will celebrate the day of ashes to day of love ?

  

It's vasantotsav because in someparts of North India Masa starts after Poornima instead of Amavasya like south India. Hence it's a genuine but how kamotsava instead of Kama dahanam ??

  

Normal people inorder to replace the Valentine's day try to do so many trails and creates the days like these.

  

Even Sanskrit scholars accepting these types of ideologies is really a questionable one .

  

Radhikastami may taken as a festival of love because the birth of Goddess Radha .

  

The love of gopikas to the krishna is known all over the world . And Radha is the prominent among those gopikas.

Even this was specified by krishna to saraswathi in Devi Bhagavatam by the words त्वत्तो बलवती राधा etc.

Instead of taking and promoting the real love of gopikas where the Kamadeva himself failed to enter the Rasa Mandala (according to bhagavtam) sanskrit scholars promoting these materialistic ideology of love and finding the ways to show these types of days in the traditional world is really surprising for me.

  

So many traditional scholars are there in the group like Kannan sir , korada sir and other scholars . Those scholars opinions are also requested so that we derive the right day for the symbolism of love according to indian tradition.

I feel citing these types of false days like kamotsava instead of kamadahana to Indian culture will degrade the standards of indian traditionality.

  

I request all the members to not to merge these types of false materialistic deed days in indian traditionality.

  

Thanking you and sorry for inconvenience.
