There is substantial wisdom in what Prof. Paturi states  

and his article is quite exhaustive in its treatment of the  

varied practices and details of the festival.  

The article is worth rereading several times.  

  

\[What may still be added as a supplement to its content is that  

a good deal of what stalwarts like Joseph Campbell  

(and also Mircea Eliade, Zimmermann, Alan Watts,  

Stella Kramrisch, and even Frederick Smith and Brian Smith)  

have said, or are saying, is ultimately traceable to some of the  

seminal ideas of Ananda Coomaraswamy  

(*wrt* myth and ritual here). That the culture of  

acknowledgement of indebtedness to scholars from the East  

is rather a subdued one is no recent phenomenon after all.\]

  

That the intensity of discipline expected of the four varṇa-s reduces  

sequentially among *brāhmaṇa*-s, *kṣatriya*-s, *vaiśya*-s and *śūdra*-s  

is an important factor to be noted : thus there is the view that

Upākarma, Śarannavarātra, Dīpāvalī, and Holikā - these festivals  

are respectively the **main** festivals of the four *varṇa*-s - although  

it is also clear that *all the four varṇa-s have all the celebrations.  
*

*  
*

The juxtaposition of Kāmotsava and Kāmadahana is also significant.

Manmatha is reduced to ashes by Śiva when he comes as an impediment for tapas.

As Kālidāsa notes: ***tapaḥ-parāmarśa***-*vivr̥ddha-manyoḥ* ...

Where Manmatha has a legitimate role, he is revived by Śiva Himself:

*tasyā'numene bhagavān vimanyuḥ.*

*  
*

Vasantotsava is a part of the celebrations as per both Śaiva Āgama-s and Vaiṣṇava-Āgama-s,

though at the same time both Śiva and Viṣṇu in their *r̥ṣi*-aspects spurned Manmatha,

when he thought he can vanquish them. We have many purāṇa-s and kāvya-s

that show the "dalliance" of the Divine with "damsels" during the said period,

once again demonstrating when and where Kāma has his legitimate role

(and where not), and why.

  

*Viṣṇu-sahasra-nāman* recounts the names  

*kāmadevaḥ kāmapālaḥ kāmī kāntaḥ ...  
*

***kāmahā kāmakr̥t** kāntaḥ kāmaḥ kāmapradaḥ ...  
*

*  
*

The *phala-śruti* therein says explicitly : *kāmān avāpnuyāt kāmī.  
*

*  
*

It is all akin to a step in the royal *paṭṭābhiṣeka* procedure*.*

The king is ceremonially made to say thrice thus:

*adaṇḍyo'smi - adaṇḍyo'smi - adaṇḍyo'smi;*

and the rāja-purohita tells each time :

*dharma-daṇḍyo'si - dharma-daṇḍyo'si - dharma-daṇḍyo'si,*

hitting him on his head with the *brahma-daṇḍa* thrice!

This is to drive home the lesson that the pursuit of *artha* by the king  

has to be within the bounds of *dharma*.

  

There is much significance to the sequence *dharma-artha-kāma-mokṣa*

in the sense that *artha* and *kāma* ought to function  

but within the bounds of *dharma* and *mokṣa*.

  

There is ample enough freedom for (*artha* and) *kāma*  

to function within these bounds; when boundless,

they become *mahāśano mahāpāpmā*, and identified as *the* enemy.

  

What is essentially sought to be made out by the norms of (Machiavelli and) Valentine's Day

is the autonomy of (*artha* and) *kāma* (as also reflected in the 'my body-my choice' barb),

and that is what is shown as hollow and dangerous, and hence denied any legitimacy.

(Cf. the Upaniṣadic *āpta-kāmam - ātma-kamam - akāmam.*)*  
*

*  
*

The liberty provided by the traditional Kāmotsava is such  

as not to make one tend to be or end up as a libertine*,*

which is what is at the heart of these modern celebrations.

Bigbiz exploits the situation to peddle their own (*sva-*)*artha* via this *anartha*.

  

The commendability and condemnability of Madanotsava and Valentine's Day

respectively - is well brought out by Prof. Paturi.

  

Sorry for the long mail.
