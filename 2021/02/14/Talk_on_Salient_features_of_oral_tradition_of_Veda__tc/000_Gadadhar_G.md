Vedas are the oldest literature available in the world which have been transmitted from generation to generation through oral tradition. This branch of knowledge in the world has this unique feature of oral tradition. The cannonical texts of all other religions all over the world have no oral tradition. All of them are having text tradition only. This is the oral tradition of Vedas that has helped to transmit the full texts of Vedic lore from millenia without any change in their reading or accentual system which is the core aspect of the oral tradition. Another important aspect of the oral tradition is that the whole corpus of the literature containing many texts with huge number of verses and prose passages were learned byheart by the students keeping them in memory throughout the life of a scholar. This is a very rare aspect of the Vedic tradition which is also unique in its nature.

Many knowledge systems have come into existence related to the oral tradition of Vedas in later centuries like phonetics, science of accents, etymology ,grammar and semantics related to modern linguistics. Separate texts like Sikshas, Pratisakhyas, Nirukta, Kalpa literature and the like were written later which contain the deep discussion on these aspects the lecture will cover the salient features of all these aspects related to the oral tradition of Vedas.
