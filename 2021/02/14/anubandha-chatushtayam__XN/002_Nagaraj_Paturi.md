Sri Subrahmanya avare,

  

We need to distinguishbetween

  

1\. The tradition of providing the details that got categorized as anubandhachatushTaya, their evolution from one, two or three to four and further beyond even four.

  

2\. The first known text that categorizes such details as a group.

  

ज्ञातार्थं ज्ञात-सम्बन्धं श्रोतुं श्रोता प्रवर्तते ।

ग्रंथादौ तेन वक्तव्यः सम्बंधः सप्रयोजनः ॥

seems to be a traditional verse quoted at many places.
