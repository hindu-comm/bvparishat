Thank you for the info you provided.

This is the sequence I am seeing:  

  

1\. First, from miimaamsa-sutra -

    a) autpattikastu shabdasyaarthena sambandhastasya jnaanam ..... (1.1.5)

    b) we have the model of vishaya, samshaya, puurvapaksha, uttara-paksha, sangati or nirNaya

    c) we have miimaamsa itself refered to as 'nyaya' (reasoning) by much earlier Apastamba-suutra !

2\. Later we have from shloka-vaartika - siddharthe jnaata-sambandham shrotum shrotaa prvartate ,

                             shaastraadau tena vaktavyah sambandhah saprayojanah and initial other statements

                             that value has to be explained first.

3\. then we see vedanta's anubandha-chatushTayam - the adhikaari is factored in... or, imho, this is only just explicitly stated here

     whereas in the upanishads previously, we see teaching for qualified students as implicit.

  

This is an extremely long tradition of intellectual-reasoning: stating objective/value, analysis of claims, responding and conclusions...  
I wonder if there is anything from the "sougata" texts on the model for analysis and response.

  

Regards

Subrahmanya
