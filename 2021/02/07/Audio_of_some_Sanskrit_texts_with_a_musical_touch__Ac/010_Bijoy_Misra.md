The Geetagovinda was the staple of the local culture in Odisha during our young days.  

There is a legend that the rendering was done by Jayadeva himself for the dance steps  

and movement. Dr Meera and Dr Kannan have continued the tradition. I can feel the  

dancer on the stage. It is nostalgic..  Congratulations.
