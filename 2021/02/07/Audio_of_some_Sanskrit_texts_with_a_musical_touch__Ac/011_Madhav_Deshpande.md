Thanks, Dr. Kannan, for sharing this beautiful song of Jayadeva sung so melodiously by Meera Ji. My recollection of Jayadeva goes back to my childhood. A college classmate of my father used to periodically visit us and sing Jayadeva songs. At that time, I did not have any understanding of Sanskrit, but still the mellifluoussounds of Jayadeva's poems made an impression on me. Now I have a collection of Jayadeva sung by various singers. Dr. Meera's rendition will be one of the latest additions. Best regards,
