This is a very melodious rendition. Many thanks to Professor Kannan!

  

Also sharing two lesser known renditions by Hindustani musicians:

  

Pt. Jitendra Abhisheki\* in Raga Basant: <https://youtu.be/4MGwtPmKERc>  

  

Smt. Meeta Pandit in Raga Kedar:<https://youtu.be/hO5jNN9u7iA>

  

\*Pt. Abhisheki also had an MA in Sanskrit.

  

Best,

Kushagra
