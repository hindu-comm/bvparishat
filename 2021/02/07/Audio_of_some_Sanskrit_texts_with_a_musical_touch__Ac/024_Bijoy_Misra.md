SriRama has been a symbol of immigrant hope. Apparently a Tulasi book was smuggled by

the indented labor imported to the West Indies in the nineteenth century. The legend is that

they smuggled it covering it as a love poem, since no religious books were allowed. In those  

settlements, The Ramayana remained their only book of choice. Many read it in Roman script.  

these days. Our Boston Ramayana was initiated in 1975 by a Pakistani Sindhi family who had  

left Pakistan during partition. They recruited me in 1982 because I could handle Devanagari.  

I brought it to the Temple in 1994 in an effort to integrate immigrants from the north and south India.  

The southerners did not like the Tulasi reading and they started Valmiki reading. That was my

initiation to Valmiki twenty five years ago. As they say, Jai SriRam!

  

Bijoy Misra.
