Very fitting personally. I received the Corona vaccine yesterday (one dose Johnson and Johnson)

at the local Mass General Hospital. I had a bit chill in the night, otherwise OK.

So for the rest of life सर्वदा मां पाहि because I am in साधुजनसङ्घ of BVP!

  

Every year on SriRamanavami we have organized an annual 24 hour Tulasi Ramayan recitation  

in the Temple since 1994. It was cancelled last year. We are arranging this year. Let there be

blessings!  

  

Thank you Dr Kannan and Dr Meera.
