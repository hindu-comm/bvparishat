While searching for an image of Gajendra-mokṣa,

I was a bit puzzled: there seems to be hardly any picture of the crocodile

capturing the elephant *from behind*. Not even a sculpture.  

  

I don't think crocodiles are foolish enough to catch the elephant's front leg:

cannot the elephant pulverize the crocodile with his other foot,

&/or deploy the proboscis to manipulate the crocodile?

  

My own surmise is that the elephant is already partly out of water when the croc captures him,  

but is too anxious to get out, and so gets no proper foothold to fight back the predator: after all,  

*nakras sva-sthānam āsādya gajendram api karṣati!*

*  
*

Has anybody attempted a different picture, or

are the present pictures realistic enough?
