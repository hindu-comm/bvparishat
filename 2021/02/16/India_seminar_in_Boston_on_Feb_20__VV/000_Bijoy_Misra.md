Dear friends,

  

Good morning. For a person of Indian origin living abroad, the question always  

arises as to India's distinction in the world of ideas. I thought about this possibly

some twenty years ago, to create a public lecture on the thoughts from India.

This is an educational exercise to help a young person of Indian origin to enable

in analyzing his/her thoughts in the context and possibly contribute new ideas

in a different scenario. I am assembling material and will present my views in a

connecting thread of ideas by carrying ten leaders in my selection.

We call these Outreach Lectures of India Discovery Center. We wish to create  

an international forum to discuss thoughts, literature, music, theater, dance,

architecture, design and sciences as we go along.

  

My seminar will be on Zoom. It is Feb 20, 9:30 AM to 11:30 AM Boston time,

8 PM to 10 PM India time. You can register by sending mail to [idcin...@gmail.com]()  

to receive the Zoom link. We will create a video, but have not decided how to  

distribute.  

  

Needless to acknowledge the contribution of BVP in my India education.  

I need your blessings to reach out to the new youth as technically we can.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
