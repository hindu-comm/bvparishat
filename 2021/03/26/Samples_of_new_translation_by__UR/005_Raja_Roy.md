Even in TatittiriyaBrahmana, the description is that of two nights. It is being said that the last night of the year is in Purva Phalguni and the first night of the year is in Uttar Phalguni. What moves one nakshatra in one night? It is the moon, not the sun. Sun moves by only one degree, no one could notice it. You sure can claim that Sayana was careless. This event is recorded in multiple Brahmana texts. I gave an example of Gopatha Brahmana only. THey mention the full moon explicitly. You have made a critical mistake, but I don't expect you to agree. After all What can one expect from someone who can do objectivetesting of a philosophical passage?
