Pranam to all  
  
Many years ago, when I was learning to type in unicode, I typed Karikaval. That was my grandfather's book.  
  
In fact I do not even have a rudimentary knowledge of the subject.  
  
I am now sharing this with you all, some of you will find ituseful.

  
You can surely point out my mistakes.  
  
Regards,  
Prakash Raj Pandey
