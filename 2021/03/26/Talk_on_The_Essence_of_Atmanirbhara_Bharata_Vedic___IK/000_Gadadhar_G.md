Our forefathers recognised that for a nation to flourish materially it would have to evolve ways of becoming Atmanirbhara or self-reliant. The Vedic vision of attaining this objective offers fresh perspectives to the dominant mainstream understanding of what this would entail. This talk will seek to identify some essential characteristics of the notions of Atmanirbharata based on the insights gained by the Rishis in their quest to fathom the underlying laws of creation and of the role of the individual in it.
