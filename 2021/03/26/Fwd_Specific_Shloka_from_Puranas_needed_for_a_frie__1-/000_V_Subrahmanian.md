Namaskaram,



A friend of mine who lives in Atlanta in the US has this request. He needs to find the source (dhyana) shloka of this particular picture, attached to this email. It may be the Vishnu purana or some other purana.



Note on the picture:



The picture was drawn in 1967 from a puranam, Lord Vishnu with Mahalakshmi as Kanakavarshini seated on Garuda. Both Ayyavaru and Ammavaru are showering gold from their Right Hands and Ayyavaru from His left Hand too. In addition, the Lord has 8 hands and holds the Surya and Chandra.



Can you or anyone who knows puranas please help him with the dhyana shloka or guide him as to how to get the source?



Thank you,
