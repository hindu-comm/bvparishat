Given the comprehensive influence of Yoga Based Practices (YBP) on human thought and behavior, and the importance of moral reasoning, engagement and cognitive abilities in general and in the field of management in particular, we examine the role of YBP on these outcomes. My talk will be based on the three major studies conducted in three years with the graduate students in the management department of a premier business school in India. In Study 1, we propose and test a theoretically derived model that links YBP and moral reasoning, mediated by compassion and egocentric bias. In study 2 we proposed and examined the impact of YBP on engagement with work without depleting energy at the end of the day. In study 3 we proposed the impact of YBP on positive psychology variables and its mechanism.
