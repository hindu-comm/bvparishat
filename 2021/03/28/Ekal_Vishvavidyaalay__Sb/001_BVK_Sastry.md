Namaste Hari ji



1. Thanks for opening up a current relevant line of thought for upsurgence of indic education systems.



2. I fully agree with you and will work for ‘Collaboration-
Co-creation’ as todays language expressions speak.



3. In Professional areas , Google had a similar path breaking initiative, an inspiration from ‘ Mentors- Master Guilds Craftsmen’
traditions of Europe, which in essence was a call :



‘Come with willingness to work for our projects and realize the vision. We will take responsibility to train you to learn skill and get employed to earn respectable – responsible livelihood’ .



4. This in essence was ‘ Kula-Vrutti – shikshanana’ at ‘Guru-Kuls’ for
‘Purushartha’-social welfare. The ‘Spiritual end of Guru-kul’ was a seamless integration over this at the high end for ‘Paramartha’.



5. When (i) ‘ Purusha and Artha controllers’ in ‘ Kula-Vrutti Shikshana went out of control (ii) community dynamics changed due to urbanization- globalization under impact of techno-economic , political factors, and (iii) ‘ Gold-Glory-Power seekers’ wanted to ‘ capture -control-rule the territory of Paramartha’, the ‘Gurukuls became a ‘ One Person Institution’.

Because there was only ‘ One person left to defend’. And only protection left is ‘Constitution of Nation’. Even that is being stripped off ! So the remains is :What good can the tradition deliver to make the life better: here and beyond. Guru- Kuls have a spiritual answer for this; but social application needs a bridge building effort.



Your initiative is likely to help bring together such ‘ One Person defenders of tradition’ to become a ‘ Group ( kula) of Masters’.
