Pranaams to All

  

Below is the link to my talk at the inauguration of the Conference on Puranas and Indic Knowledge Systems wherein I appeal to all the venerable scholars to consider themselves as “One teacher Universities” or Ekal Vishvavidyaalay. Due to paucity of time I could only briefly touch upon some of the points in my talk, therefore I am further elaborating the same here.

  

You all are an embodiment of knowledge and wisdom. All that is of value in an University resides with you and with you alone. Rest all, be it infrastructure, technology can or is being outsourced. Education is going to be disrupted in a fundamental way. From the present ability of students to do an year or a few semesters out of a 3 year degree program at different Universities, we will move to a situation of complete disintermediation of the University itself. A central certifying body who will pre approve scholars and curricula's for different degrees, will enable students to do different courses within the pre approved curriculum with different scholars of their choice and stitch together a graduate/ post graduate degree at their own pace. In other words scholars will no longer be tied to a particular University. Universities acting as licensed gatekeepers between you and the students will no longer be required for certification and will focus on research. Offline- online models will be the norm and Universities will offer their physical space( like airbnb) for you to meet your students. Scholars can choose any University campus for their periodical offline sessions with their students. At the end of taking all the required courses from different scholars, student will be awarded the degree by the Central Board. Scholars will send their evaluations to the Board directly.

  

(Analogy - From going to eat a buffet at one restaurant at a particular defined time we will be moving to an ala carte from multiple chefs to be consumed at our own pace either at home or at a place of our own or the chef’s choice ! )

*This kind of disruption is already being talked about in various quarters and some of you may have heard about it earlier*. However I felt it was necessary to speak about it in the context of IKS in this forum as this emerging model is akin to our Guru-Shisya parampara. I am therefore writing to appeal to all of you to prepare yourself and begin consideringyourself as an University - Ekal Vishwavidaalay. You and your teachings will bethe only thing of value that students will seek for in their education and not the brand of the University. You will be the brand.In twenty years time at the rate of 50 students a year each of you can personally teach and intimately transform 1000 students in what will be a modern day verision of a Gurukulam and in the process continue our glorious Guru Shisya tradition.
