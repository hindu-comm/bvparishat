Dear scholars,

We had a few fine presentations yesterday, commented upon by experts in the field, and over a 100-strong audience. The book of abstracts (with schedule) is attached.

If your time permits, please join us today for the second session, 10 am to 12:30 pm, same link.

Best regards,

Michel
