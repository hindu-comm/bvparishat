**Young Scholars’ Conference on the History of Mathematics**

**17 & 18 April 2021**





Throughout its ancient, classical, medieval and modern periods, Indian civilization has made crucial contributions to the foundations of modern mathematics. Since 2013, Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar (Gujarat, India) has conducted several high-level events to highlight those contributions and has recently embarked on an ambitious project on the**History of Mathematics in India**(HoMI).



As part of this project, we are glad to announce a two-day online**Young Scholars’ Conference on the History of Mathematics**, with a special focus on India. It is intended to provide a platform for young researchers from around the world to present their work in the history of mathematics or related fields (such as mathematical astronomy). Renowned experts will be sharing their thoughts after each presentation.



Scholars below the age of 35 are invited to submit their extended abstracts (1500 words maximum, Times New Roman 12 pt, 1.5 linespace), along with a bio-profile (200 words maximum). Submissions must be mostly original and should not have been published previously or be under consideration for publication while being evaluated for this conference. A committee of experts will screen submissions on the basis of the uniqueness and originality of the content. We will publish an edited volume of selected papers of the conference.
