Shri Venkatesh Murthyji,

Jai Shri Ram!

Thank you for your response.

\<If we strictly follow the seasons in the future .......Krishna Janmashtami will be celebrated not in Rohini but in Uttara Bhadrapada or Dhanistha.\>

In an earlier email I have already proved it that the date of Incarnation of Bhagwan Krishna as July 19, 3228 BCE, as "declared" by late Dr. B V Raman, is based neither on any scripture nor on any astronomical calculations nor on any historical proofs. It is based on the (imaginary) starting date of Kaliyuga as Feb 17/18, 3102 BCE
midnight (LMT for Ujjain), when actuallyonly Bhagwan Krishna Himself knows as to when it started!

Similarly, about the actual Janma nakshatra of Bhagwan Krishna, there is a lot of confusion since some scriptures claim it to be Abhijit nakshatra whereas others claim it as Rohini.

The Vishnu Purana 5/1/78 has categorically said that it was Krishna Paksha Ashtami of Nabhas month in Varsha Ritu. It is silent about any Janma nakshatra.

And (solar) Nabhas month starts on the day of Dakshinayana (Summer Solstice) whereas lunar Nabhas-cum-Shravana Shukla Paksha starts with the first New Moon after the same.

As per the attachment, "VP-Bhagwan-Krishna-janma-month" the Gita Press translators have translated Krishna Paksha Ashtami of Nabhas month as Krishna Paksha Ashtami of (Gauna-Mana) Bhadra-Krishna Ashtami. Thus there is absolutely no difference between Nabhas and Shravana (Mukhya-mana)

So insisting on Rohini Nakshatra on Janmashtami is self-deceptiveand nothing else since it isnot indicated in most of the scriptures.

***\<***If we strictly follow the seasons in the future we will celebrate Rama Navami in wrong Nakshatras like Kruttika or Ashwini instead of Punarvasu.\>***  
***

Regarding the Janmapatri and Janma-nakshatra etc. of Bhagwan Ram, I have all along been trying scrupulously not to get involved in that discussion, but I get repeatedly the impression that my silence is making matters worse!

***We are exposing chinks in our armour by discussing Janmapatri of Bhagwan Ram and His siblings or His father!***

Bhagwan Ram is supposed to have Incarnated in the fag end of Tretayuga.
And as per the Surya Siddhanta it ended around 864000 years of Dwapara Yuga plus about 5125 years of Kaliyuga i.e about 870000 years back as per the SS duration/definition of yugas.

But if we go by Aryabhatiya duration of yugas, then Dwapara Yuga had a duration of 1080000 years, which means Bhagwan Ram had Incarnated about 1085000 years back.

Well, these are really mind boggling figures and nobody will believe that there could have been any predictive astrology around then. *Hence the planetary position of Bhagwan Ram or His siblings like Bharata etc. or even King Dasharatha is a much later addition to the Valmiki Ramayana.*

Even if we ignore the duration of yugas of the SS and Aryabhatiya, we are pressed to the wall by some statements of the Valmiki Ramayana itself, since it has said at several places that Bhagwan Ram had ruled for 11000 years, whereas the Mahabharata Neelakantha edition as well as Kumbhakonam edition have confirmed that He had ruled for 110000 years (Attachments Ramarajya 11000year-I, II, III and IV).

That means even if Bhagwan Ram had ruled till the beginning of the Mahabharata war (ignoring completely the duration of yugas) He would have Incarnated in about at least 14000 BCE (presuming that the Mahabharata war took place in 3000 BCE).

It is really a moot point that any predictive, especially the niraadhaar Niraayanaastrology, could have been around then! So how could Valmiki Rishi have saidin 1/18/8

ततो यज्ञे समाप्ते तु ऋतूनां षट् समत्ययुः \|\|ततश्च द्वादशे मासे चैत्रे नावमिके तिथौ \|\|8\|\|

नक्षत्रेSदितिदैवत्ये स्वोच्चसंस्थेषु पञ्चसु \| ग्रहेषु कर्कटे लग्ने वाक्पताविन्दुना सह\|\|9\|\|

प्रोद्यमाने जगन्नाथं सर्वलोकनमस्कृतम् \| कौसल्याजनयत् रामं दिव्यलक्षनसम्युतम् \|\|10\|\|

meaning that He had Incarnatedin Punarvasu nakshatra on Chaitra Shukla Navmi, when five planets were exalted and the Moon and Jupiter were in Karkata lagna!  

Still more confusing is the claim of Dasharatha (as per 2/4/18 of the Valmiki Ramayana) that astrologers had predicted dire conditions for him since his janma-nakshatra was having transits of highly malefic planets like Sun, Mars and Rahu!

Why?

Because as per the same "Valmiki Ramayana" (1/18/10) king Dasharatha is supposed to have ruled for as many as 60000 years----yes, you heard it right!---it was sixty-thousand years! (Attachment Dasharatha ruled for 60000 years!)

Well maybe there are some "jyotishis" like imported "Vamadevas" who want us to believe that Bharata-varsha practiced"Vedic astrology" even in 60,000 BCE, butat least I am not going to buy that hyperbole!

So let us believe what Goswami Tulsidas Ji has said

नवमी तिथि**मधुमास**पुनीता\| सुकल्पच्छ अभिजित हरिप्रीता

which means Bhagwan Ram had Incarnated on the Navmi tithi of Shukla-Paksha of**Madhuamasa,**in Abhijit Muhurta (mid-day). And Madhumasa is another name of seasonal Chaitra!

Tulsidasji has naturally based his views on the same Valmiki Ramayana of Aadi Kavi Valmiki!

Krishna Dwaipayana Vedavyasa also has said in*Adyatma Ramayana*(which is a part of Brahmanda Purana) 1/3/14-15

***मधुमासे***सिते पक्षे नवम्यां कर्कटे शुभे\| पुनर्वसु ऋक्ष सहिते उच्चस्थे ग्रह पञ्चके \|\|

मेषं पूषणि संप्राप्ते पुष्पवृष्टि समाकुले \| आविरासीज्जगन्नाथः परमात्मा सनातनः \|\|

And the Gita Press commentators have translated it as

चैत्र मॉस के शुक्ल पक्ष की नवमी के दिन....

I must clarify here that even Valmiki Ramayana has not referred to any Lahiri or Ramana etc. Chaitra at the time of Incarnation of Bhagwan Ram but seasonal Madhu-cum-Chaitra when it hassaid in 1/18/8  

ततो यज्ञे समाप्ते तु ऋतूनां षट् समतिययुः \|ततश्च द्वादशे मासे चैत्रे नावमिके तिथौ

which has been interpreted by "Vedic astrologers" like ''imported Vamadevas" as ''almighty"Lahiri*nirayana*Chaitra whereas one of the most ardent Rama-Bhaktas, viz. Goswami Tulsidas of 17th century has interpreted it as Madhumasa!

So whichever way we look at it, Shri Rama Navmi is in Madhu-masa, Shukla-Paksha-Navmi which is nothing but a synonym of Chaitra and Chaitra is nothing but Madhu-masa------and Punarvasu nakshatra is optional.

*And the planetary position of the horoscope of Bhagwan Ram in the Valmiki Ramayana is a much later addition!*

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!
