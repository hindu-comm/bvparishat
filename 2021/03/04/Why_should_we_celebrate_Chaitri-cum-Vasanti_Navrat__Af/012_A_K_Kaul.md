B*ut judging from the planetary longitudes that it yields, it appears to have been “manipulated” by someone, I repeat manipulated by someone to suit his fancy!*

And DE431 is about 4 GB, whereas the SS is hardly a few mbs, when "computed"!

Similarly, since "Saptarshis" are said to be talking about Vimshottari Dasha results, that too as per "sidereal nakshatras" in "tropical Rashis"-----real square pegs in round holes!----and since we do not find any mention of Vimshottari in any of the works of Varahamihira of 505 CE, nor in the works of his prolific commentator Bhatotpala of Shaka 888, "Saptarshi" horoscopes are of post 10th century!

And you can check it from the "Reformed Hindu Panchang" of Shri T V Sivaraman, which you have already with you that it was actually seasonal solar Vaishakha that had started on March 21, 2021 and it was Vaishakha Shukla pratipat instead of Chaitra Shukla Pratipat on April 13, 2021.

***Purnimanta-nakshatra names of lunar months are a much later phenomenon:***

The one and only S B Dikshit has done a thorough study of Chaitra etc. names of lunar months, as will be clear from the attachment. And he was of the view that Chitra nakshatra-vis-a-vis Chaitra are much later phenomena! In fact, he declares unequivocally that he could not find Chaitra etc. names in the Rig Veda at all!

***Did Bhishma Pitamaha really shed off his mortal coil in seasonal Magha Shukla Ashtami and "sidereal" Rohini nakshatra of 3140 BCE?***  

What is to be noted here in the above case of 2021 is that though solar (Lahiri) Vaishakha started the very next day i.e. April 14, 2021 but the whole of India will continue to call the lunar month as (Lahiri) Chaitra! Why? Because the lunar month starts only with the New Moon after the sun's entry into a particular sign!

In the case of Bhishma Pitamaha, you have said it yourself

That was the start of Magha Shukla Paksha and Magha Shukla Ashtami would be on 20th January 3139 BCE (Gregorian).

So you can see it for yourself that though there is no Purnimanta in Chitra Nakshatra division much less conjunct Chitra star in 2021 AD, the whole country celebrated Chaitri Navratra on April 13, 2021 and will call the whole lunar month as (Lahiri) Chaitra, because the New Moon was vis-a-vis (nirayana) Mina-Rashi Surya.

Similarly, in 3140 BCE, even if the Purnimanta moon was conjunct Magha (Regulus) star it could not be Magha Shukla Paksha because the New Moon preceding that event was vis-a-vis solar Pausha!
