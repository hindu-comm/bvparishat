Respected sir,

The Hindu calendar is a luni-solar calendar, which means both solar months and lunar months are calculated. As i understand, chaitra, vaishaka, jyestha, etc.. are lunar months, and they are named for the nakshatra during/end of the full moon thithi. The seasons are determined by the revolution of the earth around the sun and the earth's tilt (23.5 degrees, as of now), and therefore the seasons are solar (tropical).

To clarify, **seasons are linked to the tropical/solar calendar.**

But the lunar months are sidereal.

  

Shri Bal gangadhar tilak in his book, "Orion or researches into the antiquity of the Vedas," writes in the 2nd chapter, "Sacrifice alias the year" thus:

"The difference between the sidereal and the tropical year is 20.4 minutes, which causes *the seasons to fall back nearly one lunar month in about every two thousand years*, if the sidereal solar year be taken as the standard of measurement."

  

According to "The Indian Calendar" authored by Robert Sewell and Sankara Balkrishna Dikshit in 1896, in Part one under the heading "The Hindu Calendar", article 41 titled "Lunar months and their names", S B D states thus:

'The names "Madhu'" and others evidently refer to certain seasons and may be called season-names to distinguish them from " Chaitra " and those others which are derived from the nakshatras.'

Then in the footnotes he goes on to explain:

'Madhu is "honey", "sweet spring". Madhava, "the sweet one". Sukra and Suchi both mean "bright". Nabhas, the rainy season. Nabhasya, "vapoury", "rainy". Ish or isha, •'draught"or "refreshment", "fertile". Urj, "strength", "vigour". Sahas, "strength". Sahasya, "strong". Tapas, "penance", "mortification", "pain", "fire". Tapasya, "produced by heat", "pain". All are Vedic words.'

  

So, if Madhu masa is linked to the seasons, then it cannot be equated with lunar months, because lunar months will keep drifting with respect to the seasons over the centuries as mentioned above. For example, if madhu masa (a particular season) happened in the month of Chaitra (obviously, lunar) 4000 years ago, it will happen in the month of Phalguna 2000 years ago, and in the month of Magha, in our times (now).

**So my first question is should we celebrate Vasantha navratri during the start of spring season (Madhu masa) or in the lunar month of Chaitra?**  

  

If March 14, 2021 denotes the start of a lunar month, then it is obvious that Amanta system is followed for the lunar months.

Interestingly, March 13 is a new moon day and the next *full* moon day falls on 28th March, 2021. The nakshatra on that day is Phalguna/Hasta and not Chitra. And according to S B D in "The Indian Calendar," the month of the full moon in purva- & uttara-phalguna and Hasta is named Phalguna. **Therefore, Phalguna month starts on March 14, 2021. So when does the actual month of Lunar Chaitra start? April 13th, 2021?**

  

Regards,

Madhivanan.
