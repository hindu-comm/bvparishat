Case in point, today is kAraDiyan nonbu aka charaDa paNDige aka sAvitrI vratam. No good reason to move away from sidereal solar for this one as far as I see.

  

Even if there were a good reason, it is doubtful that there would be significant numbers of women today who would a\] care observe the vrata (and not say "divorce" or "die" every so often) and b\] have sufficient education and intellect to make corrections, given that the distribution among women is not as fat tailed as in case of males.
