I do understand the predicament we are in. There is a choice we have to make - Whether to follow the seasons (the Sun and Moon) or the nakshatras. A decision needs to be made as to which is important. I would like to know what kind of proof will decide this question once for all.  

  

As we are deciding on the basis of books, those works belonging to the past 2000 yrs may not be acceptable as both the tropical and sidereal zodiac were almost the same during this period. If a meaningful decision is to be made, then more emphasis needs to given to works that predate the common era (CE or AD).

  

Kindly let us know the kind of proof that can convince oneself regarding this question without doubt. If we know the kind of proof that can convince you, then we shall strive to hunt for those convincing proofs rather than dismissing each other's argument in this regard. Like it is done in scientific circles, let us propose a hypothesis and try to prove if it right or wrong.  

Also please let it be known if scientific proof is acceptable or not.

  

As Shri AK Kaul says, if we follow the wrong system it is akin to following adharma. So let us approach this question with the right inclination to find the truth and nothing but the truth. If aspiring to unravel the truth is our only goal, god willing, we shall attain it.  

  

Regards,

Madhivanan.
