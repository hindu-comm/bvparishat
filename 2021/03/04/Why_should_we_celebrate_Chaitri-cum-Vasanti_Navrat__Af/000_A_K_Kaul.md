Respected members of Bharatiya Vidvat Parishad,

Jai Shri Ram!

The lunar new year of India is a unique festival. It is also known as Vasanti Navratra, Chaitri Navratra, Gudi-Padva and so on.

A new Panchanga for the next luni-solar year also starts and is even worshipped on that date.

***What does Vasanti Navratra/Navaratri mean?***

It means a lunar Vasanta after solar Vasant! As simple as that!

And as per all the panchangas of Bharatvarsha, includingthe Rashtriya Panchanga of Positional Astronomy Centre, Kolkatta,---who are supposed to be the "calendar-makers-to the nation", (solar) Vasanta Ritu (Spring season) started on February 19, 2021 and will last up to April 20, 2021, when Greeshma Ritu (Summar season) will start. That means the first New Moon (Shukla-Pratipada) after February 19, 2021 must be the start of lunar Navratras.

And that is on Sunday, March 14, 2021!

***Lunar Chaitra is a synonym of seasonal Madhu and vice-versa:***

As per the entire Vedic lore and even the Vedanga Jyotisha, being the first (lunar) month of the Vasanta Ritu it is known as Madhu-masa--the month of honey!

It is the same (lunar) "Madhu-masa" that has been equated and interpreted as (lunar) Chaitra by almost all the siddhantas right from the Surya Siddhanta---the initial most siddhanta---to the last siddhanta viz. Siddhanta Shiromani of Bhaskaracharya of 12th century CE.

The entire Vedic lore and its commentators also have advised accordingly.

*What are the proofs for the same?*

This will be clear from the following attachments:

1\. Madhu=Chaitra-Ranganatha (Ranganatha, the commentator of the SS---- 16th century).

The Surya Siddhant has said in 1/48 that the (lunar) new year must start from "Madhu Shukla-aadi" and the same "Madhu" has been interpreted as Chaitra Shukla-aadi by Ranganatha who was around at the time of Mughal king Jahangir.

2\. Madhu=Chaitra-SS.

Sudhakar Dwivedi of 19th century also has clubbed Madhu with Chaitra.

These are just two examples! There is no commentator or translator of the SS in any languagewho has not translated the Madhu-Shuklaadi of
the SS as Chaitra Shuklaadi!

3\. Madhu=Chaitra-Bhaskaracharya.

Bhaskaracharya also has advised to start a lunar new year on Madhu Shukla-aadi and he has himself translated it as Chaitra Shukla-aadi.

4\. Siddhanta-Shekhar-Rashis (Sripati, the famous astrologer of Sripati Paddhati (11th century) has clubbed Mesha with Vishuva and so on.)

5\. Madhu=Chaitra-Siddhanta-Shekhar: The same Sripathi has said that the creation started on Madhu-Shuklaadi! And it has been translated as "Chaitra-Shuklaadi"!

6\. Madhu=Chaitra--Samaveda (The famous commentator Acharya Sayana, in his commentary on the Samaveda has interpreted Madhu as Chaitra and Madhava as Vaishakha).  

7. T S Madhu=Chaitra ---In his commentary on Taittiriya Samhita, Acharya Sayana has again clubbed Madhu and Madhava with Chaitra and Vaishakha as the two months of Vasanta Ritu!

8\. Shatapatha Brahmaha Madhu=Chaitra---Here also the commentator Acharya Sayana has clubbed Madhu with Chaitra and Madhava with Vaishakha as the two months of Vasanta Ritu.

9\. Samaveda-Vasanta=Chaitra-Vaishakha (Here also the commentator Sayana has discussed Chaitra and Vaishakha as the two months of Vasanta Ritu)

10. Chaitra=Madhu-VD-Purana (In the famous VishnudharmattaraPurana, which the Aadi Shakara has quoted profusely in his *"prasthana-trayee*" and which was used for determining all the fairs and festivals in India as per Alberuni, has clubbed all the twelve lunar months of Chaitra, Vaishakha with Madhu, Madhava and so on!  

I could go on attaching quite a few more documents, but "Gmail" does not "allow" more than 8 mb as attachments!

***What about Shri Rama Navmi?***

I must clarify here that even Valmiki Ramayana has not referred to any Lahiri or Ramana etc. Chaitra at the time of Incarnation of Bhagwan Ram but seasonal Madhu-cum-Chaitra when it hassaid in 1/18/8

ततो यज्ञे समाप्ते तु ऋतूनां षट् समतिययुः \|ततश्च द्वादशे मासे चैत्रे नावमिके तिथौ

which has been interpreted by "Vedic astrologers" like ''imported Vamadevas" as ''almighty" Lahiri *nirayana* Chaitra whereas one of the most ardent Rama-Bhaktas, viz. Goswami Tulsidas of 17th century has said in his world famous Ramacharitamanasa

नवमी तिथि **मधुमास** पुनीता\| सुकल्पच्छ अभिजित हरिप्रीता

which means Bhagwan Ram had Incarnated on the Navmi tithi of Shukla-Paksha of **Madhuamasa,** in Abhijit Muhurta (mid-day).

Tulsidasji has naturally based his views on the same Valmiki Ramayana of the Aadi Kavi Valmiki!

Krishna Dwaipayana Vedavyasa has said in *Adyatma Ramayana* (which is a part of Brahmanda Purana) 1/3/14-15

***मधुमासे*** सिते पक्षे नवम्यां कर्कटे शुभे\| पुनर्वसु ऋक्ष सहिते उच्चस्थे ग्रह पञ्चके \|\|

मेषं पूषणि संप्राप्ते पुष्प वृष्टि समाकुले \| आविरासीज्जगन्नाथः परमात्मा सनातनः \|\|

And the Gita Press commentators have translated it as

चैत्र मॉस के शुक्ल पक्ष की नवमी के दिन ....

So whichever way we look at it, Madhu-masa is nothing but Chaitra and Chaitra is nothing but Madhu-masa

                    \*\*\*\*\*\*

Thus I just fail to understand as to why we are ''mesmerized" by our "Vedic jyotishis" and "Vedic Panchanga-makers" that we just cannot understand even our own shastras but go on blaming foreignersfor having deluded us by misinterpreting them!!

For God's sake, respected members of this august forum, let us not wait for Dharmacharyas but wake up before it is too late and start celebrating all our festivals and muhurtas as per the Vedic and scriptural lore.

***Let us do so before it is too late!***

Vasanti Navratraon Sunday, March 14, 2021, is the right time to start it, since if we celebrate ''almighty" Lahiri Navratris on April13, 2021, that will be the month of Madhava, almost the fag end of Vasanta Ritu which will end just after five days of that ''event''!

Surprisingly, on April 14, 2021, we will be advised to celebrate "almighty" Vaishaakhadi by the same Panchanga-makers, which means lunar Chaitra and solar Vaishkha will start almost simultaneously!

What a joke!

And "almighty" Lahiri Ramanavami will be celebrated on April 21, 2021, when Greeshma Ritu will start and even Madhavawillhave ended and it willbe the month of Shukra!

What a travesty!

And if we continue celebrating "Lahiri" festivals as we are doing these days, in a few decades we will be celebrating Vasanti Navratra in Greeshma Ritu instead of Vasanta Ritu, much against the admonishments of all the shastras and Puranas apart from Valmiki Rishi and Goswami Tulsidas!

I am attaching once again a list of correct dates of festivals and pray with folded hands that we must save our dharma by celebrating festivals on correct days, instead of killing it wilfully just to please some ''vedic Panchanga-makers"!

My apologies if I have hurt anybody's feelings because of my anguish!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

Avtar Krishen Kaul
