Respected shri AK Kaul,

It is with a worrying heart that I write this reply. With all due respect, it seems that you were in a hurry to summarily dismiss the evidence I placed before you rather than evaluating them with an open mind. The bedrock of scientific temper is reproducibility, but you just dismissed the points I put forward without even trying to reproduce them the way I did.

Let me discuss in detail your apprehensions one by one.

Bhishma nirvana

\<There is an insurmountable problem with your Bhishma Nirvana tithi explanation also!>

The swiss ephemeris test result you have displayed is factually incorrect. Kindly note that you have calculated the result for midnight UTC whereas I have calculated for noon local time, as it should be. I request you to rerun the test as I have indicated. I have attached the test result for noon local time below, nevertheless.

One can see that the Sun is ahead of the Moon by 87° and well into ashtami tithi. So there is no problem at all with my explanation, let alone insurmountable.

Let us not even discuss the various values of Δt when talking about dates in the distant past. I have rerun the simulation with those proposed by Henriksson (2017), with the recommended range of usage between 4000.0 BCE and 2000.0 CE, and my results hold good.

27 nakshatras

The very reason I posted those screenshots from the planetarium software is that one can easily visualize the skies with the stars as was observed by those during the times of Mahabharata.

Never once did I mention ‘tropical’ nakshatras in my reply. Sir, you should know that I follow tropical zodiac with sidereal nakshatras as you have quoted from that very article from my website.

\<Then there is further difference with the namesake stars of those divisions, which you claim were being followed in ancient times! That really is making confusion worse confounded!>

\<And that is one of the reasons why the "Reformed Hindu Panchanga" by Acharya Darshaneya Lokesh and Shri T V Sivaraman and Shri K M Rajan is/are indicating the actual timing of conjunction with the respective stars as the starting time of that nakshatra!>

I never once referred to namesake stars or whatever you mean by that or the Lahari nakshatra divisions. You then mention the "Reformed Hindu Panchanga" where the respective stars have been listed for the nakshatras. I have reproduced the relevant page you advocate from the "Reformed Hindu Panchanga" below. *This calendar credits you for the data supplied in this page*. So you should know what I was talking about when I mentioned Aldebaran and Regulus.

The common star name for Rohini is listed as Aldebaran and for Magha as Regulus in this table. So when I showed that the Moon was very close to Aldebaran on 20 December, -3139, I was not referring to any imaginary Lahiri nakshatras or their namesakes. I was referring to those *very stars* you have advocated in that calendar. **The moon was in Rohini nakshatra on 20 December, 3140** **BCE****.**

Vedanga jyothisa

It is Bhisma himself who was saying that the lunar month is Magha, I did not!  

When he did not mention Tapas why do we assume that he mentioned Tapas, Tapasya for the months. Sir, let us not assume anything and just discuss the facts as they stare at us. You have said that VJ mentions Tapas. Kindly quote the relevant slokas in devanagari script and in English; do also provide its English translation. Though I did learn basic Hindi during my school days, my knowledge of Hindi is elementary. I am comfortable in English, and I would request you to provide the English translations for all the slokas you quote.

Kindly state if VJ predates the time of Mahabharata. As we are sure that Mahabharata happened atleast 5000 years ago before the onset of Kali yuga, the astronomical descriptions in Mahabharata should be untainted by the corrupting influence of Kali. As you said, Kali yuga can be discussed later.

I am ready to discuss each and every evidence you place before me with an open mind as I hope you too would; otherwise we would just be wasting our time sticking to our intractable views and taking this discussion nowhere.  

When our rishis conceive an idea, they do it based on universal truths and not on any scriptures. Saptarishis are said to have learnt from Lord Shiva himself! They are spiritually much evolved than us, so that they can perceive universal truths that we cannot, using our earthly senses. It is not that such evolved beings are not present in our age; even if sage Agasthya were to voice his opinion now, we would just discard it as not conforming to *our interpretation* of our shastras.  

Summary

I would again request you to take an objective look at the points I discussed in my earlier mail and discuss the evidence *one point at a time*. We shall first discuss about Bhisma Nirvana before discussing other points.

If the object of our discussion in this forum is to seek out the truth of our Hindu dharma, we should approach it with an open mind as per the saying, “One can’t fill a cup that is already full,” rather than just parading our immutable views for the world to behold. Sir, please evaluate the evidence I have placed before you without dismissing them outright.  

I am also willing to discuss them privately through email as it takes as long as a day to get the response posted in the forum.

Regards,

Madhivanan.
