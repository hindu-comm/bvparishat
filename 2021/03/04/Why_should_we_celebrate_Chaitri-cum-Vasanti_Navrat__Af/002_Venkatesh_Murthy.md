Namaste

  

Tropical or Sayana and Sidereal or Nirayana will get separated more and more with growing Ayanamsha.

  

There is a choice we have to make. If we strictly follow the seasons in the future we will celebrate Rama Navami in wrong Nakshatras like Kruttika or Ashwini instead of Punarvasu. Krishna Janmashtami will be celebrated not in Rohini but in Uttara Bhadrapada or Dhanistha.

If we strictly follow Nakshatras we will celebrate festivals in wrong seasons like Rama Navami in summer.

  

Do we follow the seasons? Or do we follow the Nakshatras? What is more important?

  

Now to break the tie we have to look at Dharma Sastra books. There it is very clear all the festivals are given according to lunar months like Caitra, Vaishakha and so on. They give each lunar month and the festivals in that month. They give Rama Navami in Caitra, Krishna Janmashtami in Sravana, Durga Puja in Ashwina, Sivaratri in Magha and so on.

  

Therefore for one who wants to follow Dharma and not Adharma he has to follow the Nirayana Panchanga only. The Sayana system is only for some few people believing in Sayana astrology for predictions like Western Astrology.
