Respected sir,

Thanks for the reply. I would like to state outright that I am of the opinion that tropical zodiac is the true zodiac followed by our ancestors during Mahabharata and earlier, before the onset of Kali Yuga. Therefore, Uttarayana starts with winter solstice.

But I disagree with respect to the nomenclature of the lunar months and its association with the seasonal months. Sir, you have quoted the commentaries of various samhitas and puranas; i do not want to go into those discussions as of now. My only point is about the naming of lunar months. As can be seen in Mahabaharata, our seers paid close attention to the movement of the planets and the moon against the starry cosmos. When they say Bhisma died on shukla ashtami, it obviously means the 8th tithi from the new moon. And when they say the nakshatra is Rohini on that day (Gita Press edition), then it surely means that the moon was near Rohini nakshatra, whether we understand the nakshatras or not.

With respect to the 27 nakshatras, there is a reason behind the number 27. When taking the 4 padhas for every nakshatras in to account, 27 x 4 = 108, the number of esoteric significance in Hinduism. Descriptions of the 27 nakshatras and their shapes have been recorded in Tamil literature, which shows that nakshatras are not single stars but a group of stars implying a particular shape. It is up to us rediscover that lost knowledge.

The main problem arises because of Darwin's theory of evolution which states that we, of the present age, are the first ones with scientific knowledge and our ancestors were not knowledgeable enough. I beg to differ with his theory. Our puranas state that Time is cyclic; therefore called kaala chakra. Many evolved civilizations have existed in the past and decayed as time passed on only to be replaced by another civilization. This unrelenting march of time obeys the cycle of four yugas. We should not underestimate our Rishis of the past. They were much evolved than what we are today and are the pinnacle of human evolution.

Sorry, I digress. Our hindu calendar is luni-solar, which means tropical solar months and sidereal lunar months. Lunar months are easier for the common people to keep track of, by observing the movement of the moon during the night with their naked eyes.

O Yudhishthira, the lunar month of Magha has come. This is, again, the lighted fortnight and a fourth part of it ought by this (according to my calculations) be over.' - K. M. Ganguly translation.

Gita press edition clarifies that it was shukla paksha, ashtami tithi, and Rohini nakhshatra. And surely it is after the onset of uttarayana (winter solstice).

**Obvious implications of these observations**

1.  The lunar month of Magha. Magha is one of the 27 nakshatras;
    therefore, the lunar months are aligned to the nakshatras and are
    sidereal. *They are not aligned to the seasons*.

2.  Ashtami tithi is the 8th tithi, and it is the waxing phase (shukla
    paksha) of the Moon. This implies that eight tithis back it was a
    new moon day.

*Amanta system*

1.  If 3/4 of the lunar month remains, the lunar month should have
    started on a new moon day. Therefore, it shows that amanta system
    was used during Mahabharata.

*Naming of the lunar month*

1.  The moon was in Rohini nakshatra on the 8th tithi. On the 15th
    tithi, 6 tithis later, the moon should have covered another 5 or 6
    nakshatras. Therefore, the moon must be near Magha nakshatra on the
    full moon day. This forms the basis for the naming of the lunar
    month of Magha. *The lunar month is named for the nakshatra that is
    near the full moon* **in the middle of** *that month.*

**Testing the validity of these observations**

Mahabharata war is widely believed to have occurred during 3140 BCE and Kali yuga started on 3102 BCE. This can be tested using the planetarium softwares available today, with the *JPL DE431* ephemerides that allows acceptably accurate computation of the skies from 13201 BCE to 17191 CE. It is important to use this ephemerides because the computation cannot be accurate enough otherwise. This is not provided by default and therefore needs to be downloaded and enabled separately for Stellarium software.  

An important point to note is that proleptic Gregorian calendar will be used for the dates. This just means that that the same Gregorian calendar that is used nowadays is extended backwards through time even before common era. Gregorian calendar is a solar calendar (tropical) and is aligned to the seasons. Therefore, if winter solstice occurs on 21/22 December in a year, this would be true even 5000 years back.

Also note that 1 BCE is followed by 1 CE without an intervening zero year. But some softwares do not follow this convention; 2 BCE would be represented as Year -1 in these softwares. Likewise, 3140 BCE would be represented as Year -3139.

**Stellarium software**

Using the latest version of Stellarium software (0.20.4) and the calendar plugin, when the skies are computed for the Gregorian year 3140 BCE, winter solstice occurs during the midnight of 18 December and the waxing phase of the moon. On **20 December, 3140 BCE**, shukla ashtami, at 12 noon, the moon was very close to Rohini nakshatra (Aldebaran) as can be seen from the screen shot below.

To check whether the full moon of this lunar month occurs near Magha nakshatra, the sky on 20 December, 3140 BCE, when full moon tithi starts has been recreated below. The moon was near Magha nakshatra (Regulus) as can be seen below.

**Summary**  

Tropical zodiac is the true zodiac. Period.  

All I want to say is that lunar months are aligned to the nakshatras. I do not subscribe to the present definitions of the nakshatras as is known commonly today; I will be writing on it in the future. But there is no doubt about Krittika nakshatra (which is very obvious) and Rohini nakshatra which is next to it. And i have confirmed that Regulus is *part* of Magha nakshatra.

The lunar month of Magha was from 12 December, 3140 BCE to 11 January, 3139 BCE during Mahabharata.

The lunar month of Magha was from 13 February, 2021 CE to 12 March, 2021 as of now. The full moon was very close to Magha nakshatra on 26th February night as can be seen from the screenshot below. Please note that the uttarayana/winter solstice has not shifted from 20/21 December since Mahabharata.

![stellarium-000.png](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/22f3b2dba0172/stellarium-000.png?part=0.1&view=1)  

We can see that the lunar month of Magha has shifted by two months since the time of Mahabharata.

If Vasantha navratha is to be celebrated, then it should be during the onset of spring, which is officially during March. Magha month starts on February 13th and this may represent Vasant ritu during our times.  

My opinion is that Magha and Phalguna months may signify vasantha ritu as of now. Peak summer (Greshma ritu) is during April/May and May/June, officially, which corresponds to Chaitra and Vaishaka lunar months.

I would like to quote the following paragraph from wikipedia:

" Galileo's championing of [heliocentrism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism) (Earth revolving around the sun) and [Copernicanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_heliocentrism) (Earth rotating around the sun) met with opposition from within the Catholic Church and from some astronomers. The matter was investigated by the [Roman Inquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Inquisition) in 1615, which concluded that heliocentrism was foolish, absurd, and heretical since it contradicted Holy Scripture."  

Fortunately our scriptures do not contradict what is being observed now. Only the *interpretations* of those scriptures are against it. If those *interpretations by commentators of that time* of the shastras is final and not open to further inquiry, then we will be frozen in time. I repeat, *I am not questioning our Hindu shastras*, only their *interpretations* if they appear to go against dharma.

I have a lot more to write on this, but it will be very very long. I will discuss further another time.  

Regards,

Madhivanan.
