Respected Dr. Madhuvanan,

Best wishes for the Vasanti Navratra and lunar new year!

Many thanks for your response.

\<I would like to state outright that I am of the opinion that tropical zodiac is the true zodiac followed by our ancestors during Mahabharata and earlier, before the onset of Kali Yuga. Therefore, Uttarayana starts with winter solstice.\>

It is really a confirmation of my views that you also advocate a tropical Rashichakra!

And as pointed out in my earlier mail, you also club twenty seven equal nakshatra divisions of Ashvini, Barni etc. with the same tropical Rashis!

\<But I disagree with respect to the nomenclature of the lunar months and its association with the seasonal months.

Sir, you have quoted the commentaries of various samhitas and puranas; i do not want to go into those discussions as of now. My only point is about the naming of lunar months\>  

There is an irreconcilable difference---in fact dichotomy!--- in your astrological 27 "tropical" nakshatradivisions for phalita vis-a-vis the Lahiri nakshatra divisionsbeing followed for phalita as well as lunar month naming by Hindu Panchangas, including Rashtirya Panchanga!

Then there is further differencewith the namesake stars of those divisions, which you claim were being followed in ancient times!

That really is making confusion worse confounded!

In fact,The nakshtra divisions had always a conflicting history---the VJ equal nakshatra division starts from Krittika whereas the present Lahiri nakshatra division starts from Ashvini, though Ashvini "star" is 10 degrees away from its starting point!

And that is one of the reasons why the "Reformed Hindu Panchanga" by Acharya Darshaneya Lokesh and Shri T V Sivaraman and Shri K M Rajan is/are indicating the actual timing of conjunction with the respective stars as the starting time of that nakshatra!

*BHISHMA NIRVANA TITHI*

*\<*BCE, winter solstice occurs during the midnight of 18 December and the waxing phase of the moon. On **20 December, 3140 BCE**, shukla ashtami, at 12 noon, the moon was very close to Rohini nakshatra (Aldebaran) as can be seen from the screen shot below.\>

There is an insurmountable problem with your Bhishma Nirvana tithi explanation also!

As per the Swiss Ephemeris Test Page, below is the position of the sun and the moon

    On December 20, -3139 Greg. the moon was ahead of the sun by about 74 degrees which means it was Shukla Paksha Saptami and not even Ashtami!  It can never be Magha Shukla paksha saptami because as per the Vedanga Jyotisham, the months of Tapas and Magha start on or after the Uttarayana and not before the same!

    Almost all the Puranas and siddhantas have clubbed Magha with Tapas, which starts from the day of Uttarayana.

    The same is the case with Lahiri lunar Magha Shukla Paksha!  It can never start before Lahiri Solar Magha i.e. Lahir Makara-cum-Uttarayana!

    Thus you are putting the cart before the horse since it was seasonal Pausha Shukla Paksha Saptami and Magha Shukla Paksha would have started only after about 23 days!

    So it could never be in 3140 BCE that Bhishma Pitamaha shed off his mortal coil!
    KALI ERA of 3012 BCE IS IMAGINARY!
    Kali era is imaginary-----I repeat IMAGINARY----(pl. see the attachment "Kali Era is Imaginary- CRC ---and any superstructure erected on the same is doubly so.

Kali era is supposed to have started on February 17/18, 3102 BCE midnight as per the SS because the mean longitudes of all the planets were zero then!

But as per Aryabhatiya, they were zero for 6 am LMT (Ujjain) of February 18, 3102 BCE! In reality the meanlongitudes of all the planets were never zero over the last at least 10000 years! (Attachment Kali-zero-planets)

That means we have to first establish the date of the Mahabharata war sans Kaliyuga!

And unless that is done, we will continue to grope in the dark for aeons for the actual Bhishma (Nirvana) tithi!

And as must have become clear by now, Darwin's Theory of Evolution has nothing to do with it!

Wishing you a happy Navratri once again and Jai Shri Ram!

Avtar Krishen Kaul
