Respected scholars i want to know that -  

  

Is there exists any speech to text converter software/platform either online or offline which converts sanskrit speech to sanskrit text in devanagari script or english.  

  

Actually my friends are attending some classes in sanskrit in which they are unable to make a running notes. But they are recording those classes.

If there exists any source for voice to text conversion in sanskrit they want to use it so that they can improve their learning speed.  

  

If any software / platform exists which converts sanskrit speech to text either offline or online you are requested to provide those details.

  

Thanking you sir.
