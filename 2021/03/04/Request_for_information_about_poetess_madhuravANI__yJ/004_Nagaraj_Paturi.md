 Dear Gauri-ji,

  

16th and 17th centuries seem to be the time when sangraha forms of the three major Purana works Ramayana, Mahabharata and Bhagavat were being composed in big number by several poets and poetesses.

  

Molla Ramayanamu is a transcreation of the Mula Ramayanam from the Bala Kanda.

  

She says, Naarada was narrating to Valmiki.

  

At the end of prathamaashvaasamu , she says ........... hearing this, the great sage Valmiki asked Narada to narrate the next part of the story.

  

This Narada-Valmiki conversation is part of Bala Kanda .
