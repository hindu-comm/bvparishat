Hari Om!

Dear Nagaraj Garu,

This is very exciting. Madhuravani'soriginalpoem of 1500 Shlokason the Ramayana.

I had worked on Molla Ramayana. Molla Ramayana has only 6 kanda-s

Have presented on the Ramayana through the folk-songs of Maharashtrian women.

Would love to read Madhuravani'sRamayana-sara

  

warm regards
