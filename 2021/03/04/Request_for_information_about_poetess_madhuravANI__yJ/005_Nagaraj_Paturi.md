Sri T Naarasimhiengar treats Sree RaamaayaNa Saara by Madhura Vani as an independent Mahaa kaavya. But it is the Sanskrit translation of what is called as Raghunatha Ramayanamu , a Telugu kaavya work by the Tanjore king Raghunatha Nayaka.

  

Very few regional Indian language works got translated into Sanskrit or Sanskrit mahaa kaavyas which are translations from regional Indian languages are rare.

  

Ramayana Saara is one such rare work.

  

Madhura Vani represents the milieu of the 17th century or Nayaka period when the number of women poets that too women court poets suddenly increased.

  

Many of them had titles such as Ashtabhaashaavishaarada , Chaturvidhakavitaavishaaradaand received many honours like kanakaabhisheka, gajaarohana etc from their kings.

  

There were many like her who interestingly composed mostly in Sanskrit rather than in the regional language Telugu that was used by the poets of their time and place.
