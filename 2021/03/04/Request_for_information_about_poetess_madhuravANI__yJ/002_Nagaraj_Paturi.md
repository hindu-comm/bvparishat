**Madhuravani**was a scholar and poet who lived in[Thanjavur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanjavur "Thanjavur")during the reign of the[Thanjavur Nayak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanjavur_Nayak "Thanjavur Nayak")king[Raghunatha Nayak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raghunatha_Nayak "Raghunatha Nayak")(r. 1600-34). She is widely renowned for her[Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit "Sanskrit")translation of Raghunatha's Ramayana kavya. She also wrote many other Sanskrit works such as*Kumarasambhavam*and*Naishadham*. Tharu and Lalita says that she "could compose poetry in three languages and was an expert in ashtavadhanam (the capacity to attend to eight different intellectual activities at the same time)."
