Dear Senani Ji and BVP friends,

  

  Thank you so much for your kind words. My re-emergence as a poet after my retirement from the University of Michigan owes in large measure to the appreciation coming from friends on the BVP and some other internet groups. Otherwise, as Bhartr̥hari says: *jīrṇam aṅge subhāṣitam*. I thank you all not only for your appreciation, but also for correcting the occasional mindless errors that creep in. As I know, sometimes the Pāṇini in me goes to sleep. With best regards,
