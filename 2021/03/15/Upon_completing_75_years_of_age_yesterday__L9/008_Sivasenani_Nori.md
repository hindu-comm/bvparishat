The poem is delightfully ambiguous, Sir. At the surface, the poem is self-deprecatory, in a very becoming way.

  

An alternate reading is that though the world recognises the poet mainly as a scholar and Professor, the poet considers himself primarily a poet now. Even if parts like knees are showing the age, mind is going strong producing high quality poetry consistently.

  

Many of us enjoy your poetry and express appreciation only occasionally. Thank you for the more than thousand poems.

  

Many happy returns of the day, Sir, and wish you many more Springs.
