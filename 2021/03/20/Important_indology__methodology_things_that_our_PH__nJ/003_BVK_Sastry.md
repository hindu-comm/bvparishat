Namaste Pandurangi ji



I had shared a presentation on this theme, a few years ago at Chimanaya International Program .

The focus was to bring out the key differences in ‘desire, drive, deliverables through defined methodology’ adapted for research in Vedic tradition aiming for pursuing worldly and other worldly \[ aihika- paaramaarthika\] goals. 



The traditional model of संशोधनम्- as ’तपस्’ for पुरुषार्थ- परमार्थ समन्वय-सिद्धि-समुच्चयार्थं , परीक्ष्य, समुचित - स्वभाव-गुण-वृत्त्यनुगुण - कर्म - योग -साधन - जिज्ञासा- मीमांसा-अनुशासनम् has changed.



The modern global model, embraced by the ‘ Research Grants providers’
is seeking an answer to the question: ‘ What is the outcome and benefit ( artha-phala-prayojana). The nice cover word for this is ‘ Social outreach benefit of traditional research’. The core idea is ‘ What is the economic value of Vedic tradiiton’? How can it be controlled in a corporate economy investment portfolio model? Here ‘Veda-Vedic Langauges, Practices and everything connected with it’ becomes a ‘stock in trade, with a money value’. Samskruth term is संशोधनम् conveniently becomes ‘ diluted and distorted to सं -शो -धनम् :: popular scripting mapping to \<anglo-phone script> would be \<Sum -
Show – Dhanam> = Summarily Show Money.



This is not telling modern research is inferior or undesirable. Each research model serves a different human need, in a context, like left and right hands serving different needs in human life. विद्यार्थी for
सा विद्या या विमुक्तये is different from the one who understands (विद्या=धनं) विद्या धनं सर्व-धन-प्रधानम्



If needed, I can share my thoughts for the compilation.
