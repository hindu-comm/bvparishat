State Run Universities need to first equip their libraries with books in these subject area. They need to give to students, faculty and researchers with access to latest journals and research. I am sorry to add having torn tattered bound old books which cannot be be even opened without expert guidance is one thing and to say library has these many books, but access to latest books printed both in India and abroad needs to available in the library. One may have personal or professional liking or disliking for views expressed in books but books of authors with diverse views should be made available either as physical or electronic copies. To have a good Indological library might be vey expensive.

  

Students need to have exposure to Sanskrit Language which they have in addition one foreign Language such as French, German, Chinese etc and and a good exposure two at least two Indian vernaculars in addition to the ability to write in good English. Not writing Sanskrit as one writes in English or write l English in colloquial using phrases but proper written English. Thesis or Paper Can be in Sanskrit but a good knowledge of languages might be needed.
