Dear Professor Kannan, Professor Iyengar and Shri Ajit,

  

  I have been reading this very useful discussion. I completely agree that good research requires access to a well stocked library and a willingness and a recognition of the need to read all points of view and then react to them. Having gotten used to the excellent library of the University of Michigan for 45 years, my own migration to California now leaves me without easy access to such a library, and I have to primarily depend upon internet sources. Resources like the Vedic bibliography of Professor Dandekar need to be used routinely to find out what has been published on a given topic prior to making new statements. It is OK to criticise others, but before one criticizes others, one needs to understand what they have to say. The current discussion on the BVP is a good beginning to formulate the needs for a program of modernizing scholarship in India. I welcome it wholeheartedly. With best regards,
