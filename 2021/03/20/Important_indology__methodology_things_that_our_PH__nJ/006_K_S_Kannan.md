Gargeshwari's suggestions are very practical and implementable.

It only requires some men of vision at the top,

and of course substantial investment.

  

The other, higher, things can come only as a subsequent

if not directly as a consequent.

  

I have made this plea often that there is a crying need  

of good Indological libraries in India. I guess it was Cardinal Newman who said

My idea of a good university is a good library.

  

Most Indians have an abundant lack of motivation;

coupled with abundant lack of exposure to good books and journals,

which can stimulate and challenge them, their productivity levels

of quality work easily reaches a deep low.
