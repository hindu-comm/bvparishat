That there is a need to improve the quality of research in general , in Humanities in particular and in Sanskrit Universities that is on hand in the present thread , need not be disputed.

  

It is also true that the university academics of Sanskrit started on a wrong note because of those academics starting as part of 'Departments of Sanskrit' started in Indian Universities. That was the source and the beginning of viewing studies in Sanskrit as studies of a language and its literature.

  

But gradually, these departments themselves introduced elective courses such as Nyaya, Vedanta, Vyakarana which are knowledge system studies not studies of language or its literature.

  

With the introduction of Sanskrit universities, this diversification into knowledge systems from the limitation of language and its literature got intensified multifold and separate departments for the knowledge systems including Meemaamsaa that did not receive due attention in the Sanskrit departments of general universities, started.

  

Coming to the issue of 'research' , including MPhil, PhD , post-doctoral, major and minor research project schemes of UGC etc., one serious problem that is posed by the university system to the scholars coming from the background of traditional learning in the Sanskrit Knowledge Systemsis the intimidation and the consequent low self esteem created by the university system itself through its cultural alienness of western and modern roots and previliging of those roots in the system.

  

'Research' in particular is seen / shown as some new unintelligible 'bramhapadaatrtha' to these scholars coming from the background of traditional learning in Sanskrit knowledge systems.

  

They need to be first made aware of the fact that the entire newer and newer ideas in their own knowledge systems that emerged in the course of the evolution of or developments in those knowledge systems were, in fact, all (results of) 'research' only. All founding of new shaastras, introduction of newer , newer concepts of and approaches and theories /prasthaanas in those shaastraswere all (results of) 'research' only.

  

All that they need to shed is their vinaya to apratibhaanirodhakadegree that makes them think that all Bharatas, Srisankukas, Bhattalollatas and Bhattanayakas, Anandavardhanas, Kuntakas, Kshemendras, Abhinavaguptas, Jaiminis, Shabaras, Kumarila Bhattas, Prabhakarasetc., were all born once for all and no new such innovator can be born now and all that they can do now is to just learn and teach those innovations.

  

They have to be given the courage that they can found/start new knowledge systems or introduce newer and newer concepts of and approaches and theories /prasthaanas in their ownshaastrasand that is what is called as 'research'. No new acculturation of any western / modern methods / methodologies is needed.

  

Indology or Indological studies or studying texts connecting them to the social history of the time of their composition need not be shown as the only model for research in Sanskrit universities.

  

It should be left to the choice of the individual researcher of Sanskrit universities if they would like to pursue research of the nature of
Indology or Indological studies or studying texts connecting them to the social history of the time of their composition.

  

They should be enlightened about and exposed to the critiques such as those of Profs Adluri and Bagchee, of the method/methodology of Indology or Indological studies or studying texts connecting them to the social history of the time of their composition. They should be exposed to the critiques of History itself as a discipline/field/approach.

  

If they decide to pursue research of the nature of Indology or Indological studies or studying texts connecting them to the social history of the time of their composition, then only they need to be taught those methods rigorously.

  

Researchers of Sanskrit knowledge systems can be encouraged to get connected to the western / contemporary counterparts of their knowledge systems or explore possibilities of applications of their knowledge systems to modern life tools, technologies , professions etc.

  

But such approach should not be projected as the only acceptable research in Sanskrit knowledge systems.

  

They should be assured that if they participate in the centuries old lineage of innovations in their own knowledge systems too without any acculturation into Indology/ Indological studies, western / contemporary counterparts of their knowledge systems or applications of their knowledge systems to modern life tools, technologies , professions etc., that is very much acceptable , not just acceptable , greatly admired and rewarded as research.
