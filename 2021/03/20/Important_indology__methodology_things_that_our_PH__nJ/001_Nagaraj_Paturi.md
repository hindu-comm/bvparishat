Prof. Pandurangi,

  

The link you mentioned lists the negative side of a certain strand of Indology, particularly western Indology .

  

Since yours is a text bookfor students, it is good to introducethem neutrally to the approach of the Indolgists and then enlighten them about different strands of Indology including the shenanigans, anti-Indic, Hindophobic etc.

  

For example, they should be introduced to different approaches to / methods of literary criticism including Historical Criticism. Western Indologists claim that theirs is textual study belonging to the category of Historical Criticism.

  

It may be beneficial for the students to understand Historical Criticism and also to know all other approaches to Literary Criticism , for them to be able to evaluate the relative meritsand demeritsof Historical Criticism vis-a-vis other approaches.

  

If they are not yet introduced, it may be useful for them to know Historical Linguistics and then specifically Indo-European Historical Linguistics so that they understand the AIT / OITdebates and can contribute to those discussions from their side.

  

While teachingthem Historical Criticism, it should be useful to introduce them to the sources and methods of History itself and to various knowledge areas such as Philosophy of History, origins of History as a discipline, schools of Historiography such as Colonial, Nationalist , Marxist, Subaltern etc. , biases in History writing such as Eurocentrism, Orientalism , Neo-orientalism etc., Anthropological ap\[proaches such as evolutionism, concept ofrace etc., and their influence on History writing, Literary Criticism etc. , outdatedness of evolutionism, race etc. in Anthropology itself , later and the latest theories in Anthropology that countered evolutionism , race etc., Critiques of History itself as a discipline etc., etc.,
