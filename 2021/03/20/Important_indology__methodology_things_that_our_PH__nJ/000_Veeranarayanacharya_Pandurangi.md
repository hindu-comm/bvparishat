I am compiling a book on research methodology where besides traditionalmethodology of research, I want to introduce them some of most happening things in indology research.

our KSU (and elsewhere) samskrit phdstudents, though have good shastric background, lack awareness about western research patterns and our answers to them. most of them do not have english knowledge.

Hence I request you to help me to compile/add such

Most important things that our PH.D students need to understand, before they write their thesis.  

sometimes back there was a posting here on

<https://www.indictoday.com/long-reads/silence-lambs-part-i-drowning-out-native-voice-indology-sanskrit/>  

I invite you to help me by providing such first hand experience etc. in samskrit so these students will be able to do such things.
