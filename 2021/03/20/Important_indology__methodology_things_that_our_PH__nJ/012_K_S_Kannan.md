Very true, Prof. Deshpande.

  

It is I, perhaps much more than others, who has made a plea for  

the regular notice/review of newer publications -  

both as journal articles and books from academia/privately  

(presented along with an attempted/confirmed DDC number, say);  

and, too, periodical production of *annotated bibliographies* as sorts of "Current Contents".*  
*

  

Given the proliferation of multidisciplinary publications coupled with  

the enormity of literature produced, there can very well be at least five-yearly annotated lists.

And with the growing internet access, it can get even yearly.

  

We see in the West how linguistic corpora, and consequently corpus-based lexicography,

and even encyclpediae, keep getting constantly and continuously updated.

  

These should indeed become routine institutional enterprises and exercises,  

private or governmental, as primary/minimal resource material/tools  

in the augmentation and enhancement of research.
