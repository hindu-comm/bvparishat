I have seen several reviews and refutations which do not have academicrigour, forget academics, they just don't know what a review of a book means. I have seen several reviews which shows a complete lack of reading of the source materials in the complete overall context. The souce materials are many times what are classified as secondary reading. A good review requires vast reading and ability of the reviewer to show he has read or at least familiar with the book, the methodology used in the book, the evolution of a particular methodology . I have seen reviewers use colloquial expressions such as 'its insane' 'theauthor is a fool 'etc. A 4 page review on a 600 page books which catches on minor details. but misses review of a substantial point the author wishes to convey. I doubt the reviewer would be even familiar with the bibliographythataccompanies many books. They will not be familiar as they do not have accessto them.

  

Hence before one poses as reviewers one needs training and reading. One cannot be familiar with Indian Philosophical writings in Sanskrit in six months and one cannot become familiar withindological writings just by reading 3 books and dismissing all writings based on 3 plus book reading.
