I am an 81-year old retired scientist from Kerala and settled in Bangalore. I am an expert in Sanskrit, Tamil, Malayalam, Hindi and have working knowledge of Kannada and Telugu.  
  
On the day of retirement, I decided that I will engage myself in translation of Hindu stotras written in all these languages into English. I have so far translated 2000 stotras written in four languages. I have translated three Ramayanas (Valmiki , Kamba and Adhyathma), 21 Upanishads, Gita, Devi Mahatmyam, Narayaneeyam, Jnanapana, Krishna Karnamrutham, 21 Vedic Sukthas, including Chamakam, Rudram and 65 out of 80 known Stotra compositions of Adhi Sankara.  
  
I also wanted to preserve Carnatic Krithis in English and I have translated 1950 Krithis, which include all known Krithis of Thyagaraja, about 100 Krithis each of Purandaradasa , Oothukadu Venkatasubba Iyer and so on.  
  
All these translations are now available in PDF format on:

I have a humble request. Please circulate this information to your contacts.
