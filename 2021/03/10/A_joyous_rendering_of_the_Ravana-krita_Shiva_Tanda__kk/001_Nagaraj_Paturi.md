'Joyous' is the right description of the mood in the stotra, Sri Subrahmanian-ji.

  

Some of these stotras have been wrongly stereotyped. For example, this one is sung usually in a ferocious tone.

  

But verses like

  

कदा निलिम्पनिर्झरीनिकुञ्जकोटरे वसन्  
विमुक्तदुर्मतिः सदा शिरः स्थमञ्जलिं वहन्।  
विलोललोललोचनो ललामभाललग्नकः  
शिवेति मन्त्रमुच्चरन् कदा सुखी भवाम्यहम्॥ १३॥  

  

an intense and deep longing, not any ferocious mood.
