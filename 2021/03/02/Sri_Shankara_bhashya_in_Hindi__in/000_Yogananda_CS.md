Namaste,

  

A couple of jignasus have approached me to provide a Hindi version of Sri Shankara Bhashya, mainly prasthanatraya, (available in the Gita press books, for instance), in the same format as [advaitasharada.sringeri.net](http://advaitasharada.sringeri.net). I think it is a wonderfulidea. If anyone is interested in sponsoring / partially funding this initiative please write to me off the list: [sriran...@gmail.com]()

  

regards.................yoga
