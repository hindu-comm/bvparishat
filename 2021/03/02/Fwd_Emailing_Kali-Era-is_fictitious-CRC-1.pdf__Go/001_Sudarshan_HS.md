Namaste Kaulamahodaya,

  

Thanks for sharing this excerpt from Saha & Lahiri's report of the Calendar Reform Committee. I however did notice that one of the assertions they make there is not valid. They say:

-   p252, It is clear from historical records that date-recording by an
    era in India started from the time of the Kuşāņa emperors and Saka
    satraps of Ujjain. But India cannot be singled out in this respect,
    for none of the great nations of antiquity, viz., Egypt, Babylon,
    Assyria or later Greece and Rome, used a continuously running era
    till rather late in their history. The introduction of the era is
    connected with the development of the sense of 'History' which came
    rather late to all civilized nations.  

While, it is true that we do not have any records of those other ancient cultures recording dates using a long-count era, we do have one record from India. A textual record.

  

Varahamihira, Utpala Bhatta, Ballala Sena & Bhaskara Yogi have quoted extensively from a more ancient पराशरतन्त्रम् of Parashara. In the text, Parashara lists a series of comets whose year of appearance is stated starting from a **सम्प्लवयुगः**, which can be counted to have started 1300 years before his time.  

  

This is explained by [RN Iyengar (2008)](https://www.academia.edu/5886958/Parasharas_astronomy_ijhs_2008), if interested.

  

Regards,

Sudarshana
