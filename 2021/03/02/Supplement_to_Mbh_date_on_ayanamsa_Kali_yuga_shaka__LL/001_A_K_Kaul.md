Respected members of Bharatiya Vidvat Parishad,

Jai Shri Ram!

\< The 30-part series validating the Mahabharata date at 3136 BCE (year Krodhi), 35 years before Krishna left on 3101 BCE (Pramathi).......>

The attached article (in Hindi) "When-to-celebrate-Janmashtami-and-why"
has appeared in the latest "Shri Mohan Kriti Arsha-Patrak" ---- a prestigious publication conforming to the scriptural traditions----by Acharya Darshaneya Lokesh,

The "Tithi-Patrak" is not available yet in pdf format, but maybe so shortly. If any scholar wants a printed version, he/she may kindly write to the publisher, to whom a copy is being endorsed.

The bilingual "Reformed Hindu Panchang" (in Tamil and English) of Shri T V Sivaraman is also available now in a beautifully produced printed
form, though a pdf form is also available at

<https://www.mediafire.com/file/2jxymb6u7yct86a/2021-22_RHP_calendar.pdf/file>.  

A Malyalam printed version of the same Panchang has been published by Shri K M Rajan. It also containsMalayalam translation (by Shri T V Sivaraman) of my article in English "Why we must reform the Hindu calendar" attachedherewith.

The Malayalam Panchang is not available yet in pdf format but for printed copies, enquiries may kindly be made to Shri K M Rajan, to whom a copy is being sent.

In short, it is hightime that we do a rethink not only about Makar etc. Samkantis, but also about soli-lunar festivals like Vasanti Navratra, Shri Rama Navmi and **Janmashtami** etc. etc.

For ready reference, a list of "Correct dates of festivals"---in Hindi---is attached, courtseyAcharya Darshaney Lokesh.

With kind regards and Jai Shri Ram!

Avtar Krishen Kaul
