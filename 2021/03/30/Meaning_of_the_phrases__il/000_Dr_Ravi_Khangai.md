Esteemed Scholars, I am looking for the meaning of two phrases- Univesal Reasoning and Constructive Reasoning. These were practiced by the Greek Historian Thucydides as mentioned by Sheik Ali in the book- History: Its Theory and Method (p.186). Any help in this regard is requested. Thanking in advance.
