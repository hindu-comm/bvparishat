The question perhaps is where exactly is A pitted against B

(A being recited speech and B being natural speech).

  

Let us say you are giving a talk.

While one reads a written text - of a prepared speech, his focus  

is on the paper in his hand, (or today, on the laptop or the mobile);

while a person speaking spontaneously can be looking right into  

the very eyes of the audience - which undoubtedly makes speech more effective,

as communication happens directly, and he keeps continually modulating/modifying

his speech depending upon the way the audience is able to understand/appreciate  

what he speaks.

  

Recitation does not figure here, I suppose.

There was, we see, a general despise, of course,  

towards *pustakasthā ca yā vidyā.*
