The analysis should be focussed on Spoken versus Written versions of speech.

  

It is in the writing of a play that the writer wants to write conversations in a style as close as possible to the spoken version.

  

Again, it is in the case of a performance of a play that the performers try to bring back the naturality of the spoken style intended by the playwright in writing the conversations.

  

In the case of narrative poem kavyas too , the conversational portions are composed by the kavis in a style closer to the spoken form. But the reciters of kavyas may or may not bring back the naturality of the conversational form during recitation.

  

It is in the case of non-narrative writings i.e., shaastra and vyaakhyaana writings that the style moves away from the day to day household conversations. But the style may be closer to shaastraic adhyayana adhyaapanaand shaastraartha/vaakyaartha conversations among scholars.

  

The art of reading out from non-play works has been only in the performing practice. To my knowledge books have not been written about how to read out from the non-play books.

  

But Natya Shastra deals with Vaachikaabhinayawhich is how to render the conversations written by the playwright during the performance of the play.
