Is there any work in Indian literature that talks about the difference between recitation and conversational speech / the way people actually talk? There are some passages in which *likhita-pāṭhaka*s are despised. But is there anything that actually points out why read speech is worse than a natural speech occurring in actual conversation?

  

I'm not looking for things about why reciting from memory is important and why reading from a book is bad.

  

I'd be very grateful if scholars can throw some light on it.

  

Regards,
