Namaste Sanjeev-ji,

  

To all at team IKS division (MoE, AICTE), and outside, who contributed to the decision of focussing***also***on chronology (amongst other aspects): Thank you!

  

I hope this talk marks a new turn towards a rigorous, *but decolonised*, discussion (on Indian chronology)

that frees itself from some colonial and neocolonial machinations while remaininginclusive and accessible to *reason*.

  

Withbest wishes.

  

Sincerely,

Megh
