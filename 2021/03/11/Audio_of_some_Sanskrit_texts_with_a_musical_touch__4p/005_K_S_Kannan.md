Sri Subrahmanian has answered well.

  

*शेमुषी दक्षिणा प्रोक्ता* सा यस्याभीक्षणे मुखम् ।

दक्षिणाभिमुखः प्रोक्तः शिवोऽसौ ब्रह्मवादिभिः ॥

\- these are the penultimate words of *Dakṣiṇāmūrtypaniṣad.*

अभीक्षणम् = साक्षात्करणम् ।

मुखम् = द्वारम् \|.

  

It was facing south that the Lord taught the sages, it is also said.

The South is the direction of death and departure.

The Final Departure is one from which we no more return :  

*na ca punar āvartate, na ca punar āvartate.  
*

*  
*

Hope this suffices.
