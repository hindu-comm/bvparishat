Dear Prof. Deshpande,

  

Daskinamurti always faces south and is installed in a niche as described by Subbu-ji. Generally, the main Sivalinga will face the West. I can't recall any exceptionto this off the top of my head,there are likely a number of temples where the lingam faces the east. A main deity will never face the North.

  

Ramakrishnan
