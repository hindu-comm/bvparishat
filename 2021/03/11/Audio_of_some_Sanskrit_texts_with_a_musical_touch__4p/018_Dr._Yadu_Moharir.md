Namaskar Prof Deshpande,

  

Your question is very important and requires critical analytical thinking approach rather than just looking for some obscure reference or accepting things at par without questioning. (*बाबा वाक्यं प्रमाणं* )  

  

Actually, as we all know GaNesha is regarded as Shiva's Son (अयोनिजक) *त्वं ज्ञानमयो विज्ञानमयोऽसि .*  

  

Only thing that solves problems is your own understanding and certainly not the so called, grace of divinity or a *बाबा* . ऋते ज्ञानान्न मुक्तिः ॥ ज्ञाना देव तु कैवल्यम् ॥  

  

A perfect example is this can be illustrated by Corona Virus Covi-19 virus pandemic.

  

It was only after scientists established and verified the "Sequence of Spike Protein", scientists were able to create the necessary sequence how to arrest the replication of original virus. that could recognize the hazardous. Thus reorganization of hazard is always the first step towards finding a suitable solution.

  

दक्षिणामूर्ति स्तोत्र states यः साक्षात्कुरुते प्रबोधसमये स्वात्मानमेवाद्वयम् ॥

  

At the time of reckoning one needs to become "ONE" with the perceived knowledge which is often outside the observer. This means one needs to perceive, observe and validate the observations.

  

Only upon completion of this sequential protocol one becomes knowledgeable, regardless of the subject matter.   

  

Now coming back to your specific question of Why does दक्षिणामूर्ति always faces South.

  

As you have stated the divinity is sitting on the top of the highest point or location from kailaasa.

  

There is no one who willing wants to go to the यमलोक , thus the most critical hazard for every human being is to keep an "EYE" on that can snatch ones life itself that can result in "DEATH".  

  

Now, Scientists have created the vaccine that can control is not eliminate the COVID-19 Virus.  

  

I have discussed above principle in more details in my Book: *"GaNesa 360 : The Science of Smart Living"* that I published few years ago.  

  

Hope, you and others find these thoughts helpful why or ancestors may have iconic divinity facing the South Direction.

  

Rgds

I have perhaps a naive question. Assuming that Śiva is sitting on the peak of Kailāsa, one would naturally expect him to face the south toward India. Is there a convention that all Śiva images in temples should always face the south, or is Dakṣiṇāmūrti a specific exception?
