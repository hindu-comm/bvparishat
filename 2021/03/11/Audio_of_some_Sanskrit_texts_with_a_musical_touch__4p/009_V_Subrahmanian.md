Dear Yadu ji,

  

I know the reply I gave is not really answering yourquestion. I think finally since they have been 'stated so' in the scriptural works, the ascription of South to Yama, and other directions to other deities, it is so. I do not know if there is any reason to allot South to Yama.

  

regards

subbu
