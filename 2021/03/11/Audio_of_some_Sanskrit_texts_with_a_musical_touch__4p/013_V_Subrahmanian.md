The last phrase is in point. It is observed, as a rule, that in a temple dedicated to Shiva, the main sanctum will have a Shiva Linga. On the side of the sanctum, as the devotees do the pradakshina, the form of Dakshinamurti will be installed in a niche, facing South. So, this form of Dakshinamurti will be facing South, as a rule. This rule is not there for the Shiva-form of Linga. The niche for Dakshinamurti is also found in temples dedicated to Ganapathi and Subrahmanya.
