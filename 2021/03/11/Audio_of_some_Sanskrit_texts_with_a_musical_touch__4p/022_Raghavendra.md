Greetings of the day,

  

Isn't विश्वतश्चक्षुरुत विश्वतोमुखो विश्वतोबाहुरुत विश्वतस्पात्‌ the mark (लिङ्ग) of the Divinity?

  

If yes, naivety gets proved straightaway and at the same time, the assumption that the Divinity seated atop Kailash should be naturally facing southwards gets disproved, less said the better about the rule which becomes meaningless,

  

Thank you and Best regards,

The last phrase is in point. It is observed, as a rule, that in a temple dedicated to Shiva, the main sanctum will have a Shiva Linga. On the side of the sanctum, as the devotees do the pradakshina, the form of Dakshinamurti will be installed in a niche, facing South. So, this form of Dakshinamurti will be facing South, as a rule. This rule is not there for the Shiva-form of Linga. The niche for Dakshinamurti is also found in temples dedicated to Ganapathi and Subrahmanya.
