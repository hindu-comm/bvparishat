One explanation I have heard is this: South is the direction of Yama, Death. Shiva, Dakshinamurti, as the God of Self-Knowledge, destroys samsara, and hence death, that only perpetuates samsara, bondage.

  

Also, Dakshinaa has other meanings too, such as Intellect. buddhi. This is Pure Consciousness and hence he is called thus, an embodiment of Consciousness/Knowledge.

  

This is not all.
