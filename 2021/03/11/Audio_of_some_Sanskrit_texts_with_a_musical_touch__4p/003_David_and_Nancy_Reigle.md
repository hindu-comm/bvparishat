Dear Prof. Kannan,

  

Thank you for this. I had been hoping that you and Dr. Meera would do theDakṣiṇāmūrti Stotra. As always, it is carefully and accurately done, and your accompanying annotated English translation of it is very helpful indeed.

  

Now I have a question. A friend to whom I recommended this asked: "Why is Shiva referred to as facing south?" I do not know the answer to this question, and would appreciate any help with it.

  

Thanks,

  

David Reigle
