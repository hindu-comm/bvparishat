Dear Subbu-Ji

  

Thanks for your honest answer.

  

Here are my thoughts on this subject.

  

DNA Studies has established link between India & Australia.

(Key Point):

When the Anthropological Survey of India sampled 966 samples of individuals from 26 different modern-day Indian tribes, they found a genetic marker that until recently had only been seen in Australian Aboriginals.

Lead researcher Dr Raghvendra Rao, says maternal DNA passed down from linking mother to daughter over thousands of years reveals telltale genetic evidence of a deep link to Australian Aboriginals:

***“Among them what we found was 7 individuals shared a DNA linkage with the Australian Aboriginals that is M 42. M42 is the DNA of Australian Aboriginals published earlier. These 7 individuals came from Austro-Asiatic tribes from Eastern India and also Dravidian tribes from Central India.”***

  

It might have been a common knowledge in past that anybody who travelled to the "South" in the Indian Ocean does not return back home and were possibly presumed dead.  

  

Only known person to traveled and returned safely to India was Hanumaan and thus may have gained the tile of *चिरंजीव.*  

  

Everybody in India knows the famous श्लोक - *अश्वत्थामा बलिर्व्यासो हनुमांश्च विभीषणः। कृपः परशुरामश्च सप्तैते चिरंजीविनः॥*  

  

**I think based on above observations our ancestors may have assigned the South as being the Yama's abode because no one comes back from "yamaloka".**

Dear Yadu ji,

  

I know the reply I gave is not really answering yourquestion. I think finally since they have been 'stated so' in the scriptural works, the ascription of South to Yama, and other directions to other deities, it is so. I do not know if there is any reason to allot South to Yama.

  

regards

subbu
