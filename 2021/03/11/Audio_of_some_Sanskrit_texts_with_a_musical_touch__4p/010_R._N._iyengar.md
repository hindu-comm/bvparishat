I also enjoyed the Stotra. Actually I recollected the Hayagreeva Stotram of Vedanta Deshika (14th Cent)

  

दाक्षिण्यरम्या गिरिशस्य मूर्तिः etc.

  

I see in this an explanation for the southern face.

As we know there ar eight forms for Shiva

  

Bhava ➡ Water  
Sarva➡Fire  
Pashupati➡Air  
Ugra➡Plant and Trees (Earth element) Mahadeva➡Sun  
Rudra➡Moon  
Ishana➡Food  
Ashani➡Indra  
as per the Kaushitaki BraahmaNa (variants in other Vedic texts). Ishaana eventually became a directional deity and the direction which was originally known as Aparaajitaa became IshAnya. This usage overtook Shiva and he had to be referred as *Girisha aka Kailasanaatha.* Since Kailaasanatha in the north teaches Agastya (Pulastya, Daksha, Markandeya) who is in the South, he had to be south faced. The Kailasanathar Temple (6-7th cent.) in Kanchi is on the banks of the river Vegavati, wherein (Tuppil) Vedanta Deshika also lived. The Southern face of the Vimaana in this temple has the DakshiNaamurti image. One of the VaishNava Alwars has also a poem on the Southfaced Shiva teaching his four disciples (as above) in silence.
