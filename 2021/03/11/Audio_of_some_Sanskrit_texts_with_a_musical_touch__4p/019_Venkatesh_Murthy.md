Namaste  

  

I heard the Yoni part of the Linga must alwayspoint to the North. That means when Abhisheka is done the water must flow out to the North. This means if Linga is facing East the Yoni will be to the left. If Shiva is Linga and Parvati is Yoni we will see Shiva facing East and Parvati on His Left. This is the correct position for a Divine Couple.
