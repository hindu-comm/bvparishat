While there are many examples, here is what is quickly recalled:

  

At the end of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad Bhāṣya vārtika, Sri Sureśwarācārya (a direct disciple of Shankaracharya) pays obeisance to Shakara, His Guru:

यत्प्रज्ञोदधियुक्तिशब्दनखजश्रद्धैकसन्नेत्रक -  
स्थैर्य्यस्तम्भमुमुक्षुदुःखितकृपायत्नोत्थबोधामृतम् ।  
पीत्वा जन्ममृतिप्रवाहविधुरा मोक्षं ययुर्मोक्षिणः  
तं वन्देऽत्रिकुलप्रसूतममलं वेधोऽभिधं मद्गुरुम् ॥

The translation of the last line, which alone is relevant for the present purpose is:

//I bow to my Guru who is pure, born in the Atri lineage bearing the name of Vedha (the Lord).//

Ānandagiri says on the word ‘vedho’bhidam’: विदधाति इति वेधः तस्याभिधा शंकराख्या यस्य तं वेधोऽभिधं मद्गुरुम्....

\[He who creates is ‘vedhaḥ’, his name ‘Śankara’ whose name my Guru bears….\]

  

At the end of the Taittiriya Upaniṣad Bhāṣya vārtika, Sri Sureśwarācārya pays obeisance to Shakara, His Guru:

.....मस्करीन्द्रप्रणीतस्य भाश्यस्यैतद्विवेचनम् ।

मुमुक्षुसार्थवाहस्य भवनामभृतो यतेः । शिष्यश्चकारतद्भक्त्या सुरेशाख्यो महार्थवित् ॥ ४८,४९ ॥

//This exposition, of the Bhāṣya composed by the foremost among ascetics who takes upon Himself the responsibility of the aspirants, who bears the name of Bhava, is accomplished by his disciple, out of devotion, by name Sureśa, who is a knower of the entire meaning. //

Ānandagiri, commenting on these lines says:

..भगवन्भाष्यकारः तस्य यतीनामग्रेसरस्य भवस्य भगवतो महादेवस्य नाम शंकराख्यं बिभ्रतः तेनैव नाम्ना सर्वत्र प्रख्यातस्य सुरेश्वरसज्ञया लोके विख्यातोऽभूत् ।

\[Bhagavān Bhāṣyakāraḥ, who is the foremost among sannyāsins, who bears the name of Bhava, Bhagavān Mahādeva, which is ‘Śankara’, who is well-known everywhere by that name (Śankara), (this disciple) by name Sureśvara, became famous.\]
