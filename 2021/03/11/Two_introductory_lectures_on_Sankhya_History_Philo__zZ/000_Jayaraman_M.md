Namaste  

  

I give below the links of two my lectures on Sankhya Philosophy  

  

1\. History of Sankhya Philosophy - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAq40jHOgbg>

2\. Sankhya Philosophical Tenets -<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw6nfwZzxdg>

  

I hope that this might be of help to students.  

  

regards
