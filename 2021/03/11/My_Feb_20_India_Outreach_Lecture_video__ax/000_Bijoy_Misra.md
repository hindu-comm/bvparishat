Friends,

  

Happy Shivaratri.

Forty years ago, I thought of offering a Freshman class on India, but I was unable to collect  

material for a lecture. Ten years later I devoted time to learn Sanskrit and spent time in the

library to understand India. The Swami in Ramakrishna Mission blessed by giving me the

key to his library. A yogi showed up from Andhra Pradesh to help me get into the science  

of mind and the brain. BVP exposed me to the nuances of Indian thought and to the richness

of much literature unknown to me earlier. I tried to put it together to prepare a Freshman

lecture forty years later. So is "Ten Thought Leaders from India".
Many of you are much

more learned on the topics and have deeper understanding. I would love to receive

comments. The video is 85 minutes. I can share the slides if any of you may write a  

review. Depending on available time, I may expand it to a full semester course and

a feature documentary.

Best regards,
