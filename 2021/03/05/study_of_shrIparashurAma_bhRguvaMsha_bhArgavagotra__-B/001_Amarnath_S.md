Namaste,

  

  Regarding Sri Parashuraama, there is a book in Kannada, titled "ParashuraamaRaamaayana", written by Late Sri Bellave Narahari Shastri, published in 1938 by PTI Book Depot in Bangalore. This is a fairly detailed 270 page book, having 42 chapters.

  

  Contains chapters on Dattaatreya's arrival, efforts for marriage, travel to Kailaasa, coronation of Kaartaveeryaarjuna, Kaartaveeryaarjuna's arrival to Jamadagni'sashrama, kidnapping of Kaamadhenu, Parashuraama's arrivalin Maahishmati, then the fight between Parashuraama and Kaartaveeryaarjuna, and victory of Parashuraama, then the travels of Parashuraama around the world, then Parashuraama's arrival in Ayodhya, and finally ending in the Pattaabhisheka of Sri Raamachandra.

  

  The preface says that this book is based on the palm leaf manuscript of a kaavya named Vaardhaka Shatpadee, by Babboora Kavi. Not sure whether that manuscript is available, or the language of that manuscript - whether it is Samskrita or Kannada.

  

  I have got this ParashuraamaRaamayanaKannada book, which was awarded to my mother in her middle school in 1944-1945.

  

Thanks and Regards

\- Amarnath
