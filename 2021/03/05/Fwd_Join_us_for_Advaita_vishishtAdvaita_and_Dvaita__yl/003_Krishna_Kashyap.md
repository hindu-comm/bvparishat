Namaskar Paturi Ji,

  

Thanks for your kind email.

Please note that this is my humble attempt in addressing this complex topic.

  

I am not going into non-vedantic systems in this class and restricting the vedanta systems to just 3: advaita, vishishtadvaita and dvaita.

My approach is:

1\) state what is agreed upon by all the three acharyas as far as Gita is concerned. ( It is difficult to address Brahma sutras and Upanishads. I have to limit the scope. I can only refer to them where the Acharyas themselves quote from them)

  

2\) list points of disagreement between them. First break it into topics such as: phala , sadhana , tattva and go deep into what it means to build the bridges between these systems. topics here include: prapya svarupa, jagat-karana svarupa, jagan-mithyatva, nirvesha vishaya, nimitta-upadana karanatva, sadhana svarupa(such as bhakti) and moksha svarupa.

  

3\) how to reconcile or do some amount of samanvaya.

  

Among several teachers I learnt from, Sri KSV, in particular, has given a lot of ideas in his unfinished work : satya-siddhi about samanvaya. I can only select afew majorpoints from his book and explain. This book is terse and is 106 pages long totally in sanskrit.

His strong belief based on what he has learnt from his Gurus and confirmed through his research about these three major acharyas can be simplified in onesentence:  "tesham hridayam ekam eva". Based on the context and type of aspirants, These acharyas delivered slightly different views.

  

I will try to address these issues in the 11 week course. However, this will be an overview only due to lack of time and- " my limited knowledge about this complex topic".

With blessings from everyone (remember sarvam khalvidam brahma!), I sincerelyhope to do some justice to this subject.

  

*Best Regards,*
