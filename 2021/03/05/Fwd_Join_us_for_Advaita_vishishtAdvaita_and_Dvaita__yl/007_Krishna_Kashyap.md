namaskar Sri Siva Prasad Ji,

I am not an executive of this University(Hindu University of America). I will send them the information you have provided and let you know.

Thanks for the email.

  

I will see this chaturmata sara sangraha book and try to incorporate some information from this book.

My focus for this course is mainly the Gita-Bhashyas of the three acharyas.

  

  

*Best Regards,*
