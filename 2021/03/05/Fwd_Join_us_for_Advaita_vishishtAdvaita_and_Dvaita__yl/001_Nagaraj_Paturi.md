Congratulations Sri Krishna Kashyap-ji for choosing this important topic.

  

Best wishes for the webinar.

  

I have been dreaming for a project "Undisputed Vedanta"

  

The aim of the project is to sort out

  

1. aspects of Vedanta that are agreed upon by all the different schools of Vedanta and distinct for Vedanta compared to the other Vaidika darshanas.

  

2\. aspects of Vedanta where different schools disagree with each other.

  

This webinar focuses probably on the issue of reconcilability or lack of it in point # 2.
