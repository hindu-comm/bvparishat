Here is a pdf of 36 pages where Vidwan Sri Polagam Rama Sastrigal of the earlier century has compiled several points of concordance across the major systems of Vedanta and some other important points that one can ponder over. He has done this as a prelude to Sri Appayya Dikshitar's 'Chaturmata saara sangrahah'.
