Thanks to ShrimaanShatavadhani Dr. R. Ganesh for this great article.  
  
Perhaps it is not too late to recognize the contributions of Mm Pullela Sriramachandrudu. Possible recognitions can be in many ways. We should start this grand recognition process soon. It inspires future generations.

  

The article says the following =  

“On the one hand we have such mammoth and expensive endeavours backed by enormously wealthy sponsors endowed with a colonial mind set, promoting questionable prefaces and interpretations, which are far removed from genuine and rooted Indian sensibilities. On the other, we have fantastic native luminaries such as Pullela Sriramachandrudu, Sripada Damodar Satavalekar, Revaprasad Dwivedi, Sri Rama Sharma (from Haridwar’s Gayatri Ashram), Sudhakar Chaturvedi, Charla Ganapati Sastri and Baladeva Upadhyay, each a powerhouse in their own right. The fact that none of their outstanding accomplishments have received even a basic acknowledgement from the so-called*Bhadralok*inhabiting our nation’s academic-literary-cultural landscape is profoundly tragic.”
