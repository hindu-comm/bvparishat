Sir

  

In our tradition Rishirina is repaid by keeping alive the knowledge discovered and passed on by them.

  

In the same vein, the best way to remember Mm Padmasri Pullela Ramachandrudu is to keep his works in circulation by reading them amd support the institutions built by him. On that count, things are not very encouraging. Many of his books used to be bought by students, where his translation was the only one available in Telugu - Dhvanyaloka with Locana, for instance - but nowadays, newer guidebook-like translations, restricted to the exam syllabus have come up and students read only important questions in these. There are certain other original works of the Mahatapasvi like ko vai rasaH (published by Sahitya Akademi if memory serves me right) but these are no longer available.

  

All the three institutions built by him in Hyderabad are doing well, though both Samskrta bhasha prachara samiti and Sura Bharati Samiti have seen better days. Sanskrit Academy is doing good work, especially in publishing. The glory days of publishing the definitive edition of Kasika are not yet back but there is hope. The Department of Sanskrit in Osmania University, that he served for most of his working life, is doing better than say, the department in Andhra University, but it is slowly decaying. Faculty strength is down from 8 to 4 (if that). They have stopped publishing their annual journal (the last one was in 2008 or thereabouts). No major work of national importance has been done by this department or its faculty for a long time now, though one of the alumni Prof. Penna Madhusudan (now in Nagpur) won the Sahitya Akademi award for his Mahakavya.

  

More than awards, if the current generation of scholars could be exhorted to adopt the same standards of learning as the great teacher, that would be the best way to repay a part of our rina.

  

Regards

N Siva Senani
