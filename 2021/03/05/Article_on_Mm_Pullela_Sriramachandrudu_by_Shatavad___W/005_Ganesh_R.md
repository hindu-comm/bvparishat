Dear Sir,

  

Thanks a lot for your good words. Yes, the main problem with the information regarding the life and work of our scholars here is the inaccessibility of the same in English. Because of this, even many literary giants of languages are becoming unknown to our own neigborers. Perhaps writing about them in Sanskrit is one of the solutions.

  

  

With best regards

  

Ganesh
