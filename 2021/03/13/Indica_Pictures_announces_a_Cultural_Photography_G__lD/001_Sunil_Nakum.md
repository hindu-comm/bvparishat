Namaste,

  

I would like to cordially thank the Indica group for the number of initiatives you people undertake, and particularly for this one!

For quite some time I had this particularwish to have Stock of India specific pictures, and at times I've spread this word in my known circle to have photography that depict Bharata.  

The reason is whenever I had searched for "Yoga" with Google Images, most of the pictures were of skimpily clothed women. Well, we can get rid of it and find the desired images by tweaking the search terms.  

  

With such India centered projects, a new wave will propagateacross the Internet for India specific pictures, Yoga being part of our Culture!  

  

Bestwishes for this project.

  

Regards,

Sunil
