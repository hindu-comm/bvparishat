Owing to some distraction, I ended the previous mail somewhat abruptly.

  

Negations can sometimes be tricky, and words apparently exactly opposite

can yield or lead to the same *tātparya*.  

  

Consider the words *dharma-bhīru* and *adharma-bhīru*.

The former refers to one who is afraid of \[transgressing\] *dharma*; and  

the latter refers to one who is afraid of committing \[any act of\] *adharma*.

  

Even so, *atītopad(h)a* and *anatītopad(h)a* can end up in the same essential sense.

"Have as your model those who do not stray".

Integrity of character is what is being stressed here.
