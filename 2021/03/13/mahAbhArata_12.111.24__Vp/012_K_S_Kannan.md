Prof. Korada has drawn attention to key grammatical sources.

*upadhā* has been dealt with in detail by Kauṭalya.

  

That both तानतीतोपधान् and तानतीतोपदान् could be right

has just been pointed out. My indication too was to the same effect.

  

However, has the issue been sorted out as to whether the reading(s)  

अनतीतोपधान् or अनतीतोपदान् could still be right?
