Dear Misra,

  

It was not out of some vague generosity or a sort of a democratic approach

that I said that all the four readings are acceptable. The four readings *in the present context*

are acceptable, is what I meant. My comment need not be overgeneralised.  

  

There is no doubt at all that the original author meant but one reading.

(Which is not to deny, again, that poets themselves can, at times, feel tempted to create

a variant reading which will equally well serve the purpose).

  

There is abundant scope, undoubtedly, for scribal errors. I do not have to list here

the numerous causes for scribal errors. That a good many of them spring from

errors in copying (owing to similarity of certain letters), or hearing (while being dictated),

the limited vocabulary of the scribe, the limited knowledge of the scribe etc etc

can all contribute in abundance to the same; and they all need to be sifted.

In addition to being relegated to the "netherlands" of footnotes,  

some can even be unfit to be noted, and just discarded.

  

While the task of the editor is to reconstruct the original to the best possible extent,

and propose the best possible reading, it is not always easy to stand in judgement.  

  

As to Sanskrit commentators, they spend all their ingenuity in explaining away  

various readings; and not just that: they can give multiple explanations for the same reading too.

And there are good and bad commentators again, as elsewhere. Commentators  

besmirching one another for lapses in grammar etc. can also be seen in abundance -  

whether in commentaries on kāvya-s or even on kośa literature.  

"*sāhasikāḥ*" is, in a way, a very mild term of abuse!  

  

There is an overabundance of usages in our epic/puranic literature that cannot be  

explained using Pāṇini's rules. The story is different wrt the later mahākāvya-s etc.

While Pāṇini cannot be ignored - and a good many of Chaurudeva Sastri-ji's illustrations

of idiomatic usages *envisaged right in Pāṇini* flow from the epic/puranic literature -

a strict adherence cannot be expected, and the same cannot be made  

an exclusive criterion of rejection of readings is all that I need to say.

  

That you are involved in translating a portion of the *Mahābhārata* is highly commendable.

While it cannot be gainsaid that our own translators can also err sometimes,

mistranslations issuing from prejudice at the hands of many Western commentators

needs also to be handled and countered; and your attempts, we hope,  

will accomplish this in addition - a careful scholar that you are.

  

I wish the very best for your great enterprise.

Regards

KSKannan
