All the four readings can be explained,  

given the elasticity of Sanskrit.

  

In the KV edition I cited earlier, we have  

*anatītopadham* at 12.93.18 (in a negative sense), &  

*anatītopadān* at 12.111.25 (in a positive sense).

Therefore,

*atītopadha* is positive in sense.  

**atītopada** is negative in sense.  

  

Those who are familiar with the cornucopia (call it plethora if you will) of variant readings

even in fairly recent \[Sanskrit\] texts, and the more so in ancient texts, especially the epics/purāṇa-s,

and kindred literature, should not be surprised at "opposite" readings, many of which  

can still be defensible even without too much of grammatical exertion.  

  

To pass a verdict, therefore, that a particular reading is wrong

demands perspicuity and perspicacity to no small degree.

Sound hermeneutics, much more than mere skill at grammatical acrobatics

is demanded of the true investigator. Extreme conformity to Pāṇini

is after all not to be expected in such literature.  

  

This is not to be construed as some snide remark but is to be seen as  

a true requirement in a sound commentator.
