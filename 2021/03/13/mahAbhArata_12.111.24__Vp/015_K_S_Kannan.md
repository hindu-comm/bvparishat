What is clear from the discussion so far is the fact that  

even though we have the expressions तानतीतोपधान् and तानतीतोपदान्  

amenable to some explanation, the expressions अनतीतोपधान् /अनतीतोपदान्  

are still presented by more than one manuscript, and so demand an explanation.

I did suspect an explanation somewhat on the lines of Sri HSVBhattacharya,

(brought now to our attention by Hari Parshad Das-ji) which is why  

I did not just dissent - along the lines of Misra-ji or Korada-ji.

  

This can also be an occasion to remind ourselves how sometimes exactly opposite

readings can yield more or less the same sense. Sometimes more or less mutually opposite  

renderings can also make sense. I will give one example for each.

  

Example 1

In Kālidāsa's *Śākuntalam*, we have the situation where Duṣyanta is puzzled,

(and perhaps even Kalidasa was puzzled, or at least the scribes surely were), and

accordingly we have two opposite readings. 5.19b:*  
*

स्यान्न वेत्यव्यवस्यन्*  
*

स्यान्न वेति व्यवस्यन्

Both readings, however, can make sense, and can even lead yet to the same *tātparya*.

*1 ayavasyan* = unable to decide

*2 vyavasyan* = endeavouring to/proceeding to discern.

But ever so charming is the poetic and dramatic exploitation of the context by Kālidāsa.

While the Pratīhārī admires the adherence to *dharma* by the king,

Śārṅgarava lashes out questioning the king's conspicuous lull,

suspecting it to be the exact opposite: rank violation of *dharma* by the king!

  

If some commentators (ancient/modern) are uncomfortable with the reading 2,

it can be because of a possible ignorance of the use of the *śatranta* in the special sense

pointed out above.

  

Example 2

In the *Bhagavadgītā*, 1.10, we have *aparyāptam* and *paryāptam* in the two halves

of the verse, interpreted to yield the same senses by different commentators.

As they are rather famous, I will not expatiate upon the same here.

  

Even so now in the Mahābhārata readings under discussion.

I do not think there is any opposite sense or misprint to be suspected here,

if we can consider these renderings:  

*atīta* = going beyond/defying/untrammeled by/unshackled by.

So then *atītopadān* = those who are not swayed by bribes/who are above bribery.

I guess this sense is no misfit here.

  

I request scholars to give some consideration for this way out of the riddle

which sees the possibility of sense in the alternate readings found in  

more than one manuscript. Had it been a sole manuscript/edition,

we could have suspected a plain scribal error (in lieu of our inability to interpret).
