Thanks to all members for the valuable discussion. Yes, the reading अनतीतोपधान् can be justified, the Gita Press Hindi translation has the meaning “कपटनीति में कुशल” for this reading, taking उपधा to mean कपट like the Bhārata-kaumudī has. The Gita Press edition of the śāntiparvan came out in 1950s (1955 as per some news sites) and Bhārata-kaumudī in 1959, it is possible that the author of Bhārata-kaumudī was aware of this translation by Gita Press.

However, the question is what was the original reading? तानतीतोपधान् or अनतीतोपधान्. That the critical edition has तानतीतोपधान् in verse 12.112.24 (12.112.24 in Gita Press edition) shows that several manuscripts would have had तानतीतोपधान्. The translation by Kisari Mohan Ganguli reads “unstained by covetousness” which seems more aligned with the reading तानतीतोपधान्, as the four (five in some sources) उपधाs are essentially allurements, so most likely he also had (or preferred) तानतीतोपधान्.

Given that the word अनतीतोपध is used in a negative sense in the context of appointments by a king (कार्ये महति युञ्जानो ... नृपतिः) just a few chapters earlier (verse 12.93.18) in the same ‘parvan’, it is unlikely that a few chapters later, the word अनतीतोपध (verse 12.111.24) would be used in a positive sense in the same context of appointments made by a king.

With this, I still think तानतीतोपधान् makes more sense given the context as compared to अनतीतोपधान्. Very likely तानतीतोपधान् may have been the original reading which may have changed to अनतीतोपधान् due to a scribal error.
