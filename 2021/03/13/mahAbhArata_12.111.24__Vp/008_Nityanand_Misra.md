Namaste Dr. B V K Sastry Garu

As the context in the text is appointments of ministers, the most natural meaning of ‘tānatītopadhān’ = ‘tān’ + ‘atītopadhān’ is “those who have passed the \[four\] upadhā’s. As we already know, ‘upadhā’s refers to the test performed by a king before appointing an official like a minister—राज्ञां धर्म्मकामार्थभयैरमात्यादेर्यत्परीक्षणम् (शब्दकल्पद्रुमः). The four tests—‘bhayopadhā’, ‘dharmopadhā’, arthopadhā’, and ‘kamopadhā’—are also referred to by Hemacandra: भिया धर्मार्थकामैश्च परीक्षा या तु सोपधा (अभिधानचिन्तामणिः).

Those who have passed the four tests are ‘atītopadha’—अतीता उपधा यैस्तेऽतीतोपधाः (‘गोस्त्रियोरुपसर्जनस्य’ इति ह्रस्वः), तान् अतीतोपधान्. The word ‘atītopadha’ is used several times in the Mahābhārata.

This is an example from the Śāntiparvan which makes it clear that an ‘anatītopadha’ is not desirable for a king—

मूढमैन्द्रियकं लुब्धमनार्यचरितं शठम्।

अनतीतोपधं हिंस्रं दुर्बुद्धिमबहुश्रुतम्॥

त्यक्तोपात्तं मद्यरतं द्यूतस्त्रीमृगयापरम्।

कार्ये महति युञ्जानो हीयते नृपतिः श्रिया॥

(12.93.18)

Here are other examples from the Mahābhārata which show a minister/official should be ‘atītopadha’ or ‘upadhātīta’—

अमात्यानुपधातीतान् पितृपैतामहाञ्छुचीन्

(this line is originally from the Rāmāyaṇa 2.100.27, it is repeated in the Mahābhārata, 15.5.14)

पञ्चोपधाव्यतीतांश्च कुर्याद् राजाऽर्थकारिणः

(12.83.22, here five ‘upadhā’s are referred to)

नित्यं पञ्चोपधातीतैर्मन्त्रयेत्सह मन्त्रिभिः

(12.83.52, in the same chapter, again five ‘upadhā’s are referred to)

Given that the context in 12.111.24 (CE 12.112.24) is appointment of a minister by a king, the obvious I cannot think of any other meaning for ‘atītopadhān’ and so ‘tān atītopadhān’ seems the correct reading and ‘anatītopadhān’ appears to be incorrect.
