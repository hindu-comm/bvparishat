Yes, but even if four (or ten) readings can be explained given the “elasticity” of Sanskrit, there has to be one original reading, not four or ten.

On the other hand, to say “all readings can be explained/justified” is wishing the problem away. We can probably do that in a discussion. But there are situations where this liberty is absent and where one reading has to be chosen and others discarded. An editor has to elevate one reading to the ether of boldface and relegate the other(s) to the netherworld of the footnote(s). A translator also faces this problem. I am currently translating around 3% of the text of the Mahābhārata into English and Hindi. As a translator, I have to prefer one of the available editions/readings, the best I can do is add a note stating which edition/reading has been chosen. While many a time Sanskrit commentators give explanations of multiple readings, it is not unoften that we see commentators also strongly preferring one reading over another. An example that springs to mind is Mallinātha saying *kecit sāhasikāḥ ‘trilocanam’ iti peṭhuḥ* (commenting on *Kumārasambhavam* 3.44). The use of the word*sāhasikāḥ* for those who preferred the other reading offers both levity and insight in equitable, if not equal, measure.

I think this is a more a question of textual criticism than hermeneutics. Context, which has been discussed on this thread, and conformity to Pāṇini, which has not been discussed, are pertinent factors, though they are not the only factors.
