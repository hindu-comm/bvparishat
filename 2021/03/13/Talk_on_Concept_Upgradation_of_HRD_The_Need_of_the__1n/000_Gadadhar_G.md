The prevalent human resource development (HRD) concept and its execution suffers from the error of ignoring the Bharateeya Heritage and the consequent resource loss, lack of enrichment, and unaccomplished empowerment. The need  
of the hour is to upgrade HRD concept to an earlier Bharateeya version which has withstood the test of time by its innate strength. The Vedic foundation of Indian management ought to become the guiding factor of nation building for  
all round development, true progress, and sustained peace. HRD without the core concern for and focus on spiritual resource development (SRD) of the citizen and the nation, it would remain merely statistical and static. Indian  
Knowledge Systems should be given serious attention to derive and draw the right roadmap for this purpose.  
  
Health, Peaceful Living Space, Entertainment, and Security (Defence) are integral and integrated to HRD according to Vedic Management theory and practice. Ayurveda, SthApathyaveda, Gandharvaveda and Dhanurveda are  
very crucial to upgrade HRD with SRD. Yoga and Tantra provide the necessary discipline to pursue Indian Knowledge Systems for this purpose.
