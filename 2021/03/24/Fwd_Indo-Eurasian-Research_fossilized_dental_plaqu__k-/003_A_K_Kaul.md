Dear Dan and Rodo -



Really a great paper with far-ranging implications! What always impresses me in studies of premodern pan-Eurasian trade is that trade involving turmeric almost*always* shows up somewhere — not just as a “foodstuff” but for medicinal use, since it is one of the most effective plant-based anti-inflammatories known. Its active anti-inflammatory component, curcumin, is discussed in ca. 17,000 modern papers in PubMed!

Below I quote a key paragraph on turmeric from the new PNAS paper. The paper is formally behind paywalls, but it has been posted by someone online and is available via Google Scholar if you don’t otherwise have access to it:
