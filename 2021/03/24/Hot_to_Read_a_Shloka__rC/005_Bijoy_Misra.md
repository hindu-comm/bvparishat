Dear Dr Garsuns,

Ramakrishna Mission here in Boston did have a whole hymnal book for piano accompaniment.

An opera singer George Dwyer used to lead their chorus group with other western musicians.  

I am not sure if the music book is published.  

I appreciate your effort.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
