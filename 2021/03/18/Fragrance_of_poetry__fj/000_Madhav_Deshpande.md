Fragrance of poetry

  

चन्दनतरुरिव सुकवि: प्रतिवेशं वासयेत् स्वकै: काव्यै: ।

कविकालिदासगन्धेऽद्यापि रमन्ते सदा रसिका: ।।

  

Like a sandalwood tree, a good poet should make his neighborhood fragrant with his poetry. Even today, connoisseurs always find pleasure in the fragrance of the compositions of Kalidasa.
