Dear Ashok Ji,

  

  Vaman Shivram Apte \[1858-1892\] was among the five founding figures of the New English School set up in Pune in 1880, and later in 1885 this led to the founding of the Fergusson College. V.S. Apte was the first principal of Fergusson College. I am a student of both of these institutions. During his relatively short life, Apte contributed significantly to the development of modern education in Pune, and to Sanskrit scholarship.
