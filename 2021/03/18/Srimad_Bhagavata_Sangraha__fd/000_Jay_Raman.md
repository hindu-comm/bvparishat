Dear Learned members, I understand there is a "Srimad Bhagavata Sangraha" providing key slokas from Srimad Bhagavatam. I was trying to search online for a sanskrit version unable to locate - incase any of the group members are aware of such a document it will be immensely valuable if that can be shared.

  

Looking forward to responses.

  

Best wishes,

Jayaraman V
