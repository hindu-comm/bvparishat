प्रणम्य विदुषः निवेद्यते।

  

I came across a sutra in Jainendra Vyakarana (also called SabdArNavcandrikA) dealing with the combination of ह with व, ल, य, म, न. The same is reproduced below. Title page is reproduced below the signature line.

The absence of ण may be noted, as may be the optionality indicated in the vritti. Both the optionality and practicality (giving a sutra for pronunciation, which is usually dealt with in the proper vedanga - Paniniyasiksha) are, though, not surprising from a scholar of Syaadvaada.

  

Thanks to Sri Narayan Prasad (of the Concordance of Nine Vyakaranas fame) for sharing the text with me.

  

Regards

N. Siva Senani
