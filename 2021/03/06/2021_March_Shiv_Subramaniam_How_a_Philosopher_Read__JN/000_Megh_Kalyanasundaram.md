Subramaniam, S. How a Philosopher Reads Kālidāsa: Vedāntadeśika’s Art of Devotion.*J Indian Philos*(2021). <https://doi.org/10.1007/s10781-021-09459-0>  

  

Abstract: "Vedāntadeśika (c. 14th c.) is one of many Sanskrit intellectuals who wrote prolifically in both poetic and philosophical genres. This essay considers how his poetry is related to his philosophical concerns. Scholars have understood the relationship between his poetry and philosophy in a number of ways, some arguing that his poetry permitted a freer exploration of his philosophical ideas, others wishing to discuss his poems independently of his philosophy. My paper will propose a distinct way of understanding this relationship by focusing specifically on a strain of Vedāntadeśika’s poetry inspired by Kālidāsa (4th c.). Examining selections from his poetry alongside his theological writing on the nature of devotional attention, I will argue that the poetic practice Vedāntadeśika learns by reading Kālidāsa activates the same mental faculty involved in*bhakti-yoga*, or the devotional contemplation of god. This strain of Vedāntadeśika’s poetry thus amounts to a performance of the devotional practice he describes in his philosophical writings."
