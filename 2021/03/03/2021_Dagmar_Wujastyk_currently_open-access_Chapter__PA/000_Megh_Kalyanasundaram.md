Wujastyk, Dagmar. "Chapter 8 On Attaining Special Powers through Rasāyana Therapies in Sanskrit Medical Literature". In*Body and Cosmos*, (Leiden, The Netherlands: Brill, 2021) doi:<https://doi.org/10.1163/9789004438224_009>  

  

"In this article, I will examine the association of a particular branch of Āyurveda called*rasāyana*(vitalization therapy) with the development or attainment of extraordinary capabilities or special powers (*siddhi*). Special powers or abilities are often described in Indic literature as the necessary or incidental products of spiritual advancement: For example, a specific set of special powers (*siddhi*) forms an integral part of the yogic path of the*Pātañjalayogaśāstra*.[1](https://brill.com/view/book/edcoll/9789004438224/BP000010.xml#FN000248)But what role do special powers play in medicine? Are they also part of a spiritual path, or do they have a different function in medicine? In the following, I will examine how the generation of special powers is described in Sanskrit medical literature in the context of*rasāyana*and will explore what this tells us about the Sanskrit medical authors’ understanding of medicine."
