Thanks, Sri Megh-ji for sharing this article on a topic significant for us.

  

Her concluding remarks are carefully worded and are not in the usual scienticistnegative tone towards the Siddhis.

The second seems to reflect an optimism about the > possibility to nevertheless live a happy life in favorable conditions. > These effects of*rasāyana*medicines are reminiscent of some of the > effects attributed to mantras and rituals of the*Atharvaveda*and its > ancillary texts.

This has been my argument with regard to the Vibhutis of the Vibhuti paada of YS too.

  

It is scientismto sneer at every mention of supernatural power , super power etc. of rishis, munis, yogis etc.

  

There were discussions in this list too on Yogipratyakshamand those with scientism-limited understanding hastened to enlighten the list by arguing how irrational such views were.
