**Abstract**: In 1817, Henry Thomas Colebrooke (1765–1837) published English translations of different Sanskrit mathematical texts, including a translation of the twelfth chapter of Brahmagupta's Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta (628 CE), with the help of Pṛthūdaka’s Vāsanābhāṣya (fl. 960). Almost ninety years later, in 1902, Sudhākara Dvivedin (1855–1910/11) published an edition of the Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta with his own commentary, which refers also to Pṛthūdaka’s commentary. Since both texts were crucial to the access one could have to Brahmagupta's mathematics, their point of views durably marked the historiography. Dvivedin’s and Colebrooke’s publications are striking for the different ways they deal with the structure of Brahmagupta’s mathematical chapter, their relation to Pṛthūdaka’s commentary, or numerical practices.
