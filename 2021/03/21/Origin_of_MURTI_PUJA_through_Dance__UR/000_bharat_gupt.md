Dear Friends,

I am presenting this earliest evidence of making a devataa become morphic or saakaar as found in Indian textual tradition.

  

Please note that I place Natyashastra as compiled in 5th cent BC, as against the usual mindless dating of it from 2nd cent BC to 2nd cent AD unquestioned by stalwarts like V. Raghavan, Vatsyayan and others ( The real intent being to uphold the view that theatre was born in 5th cent BC , Greece).

I have also corrected here a common misconception that

'pindibandha' meant group dancing in NS. It actually meant making a devataa in his/her saakaar Rupa.

Reactions/ rejoinders/ questions eagerly awaited.

Best regards,

Bharat Gupt
