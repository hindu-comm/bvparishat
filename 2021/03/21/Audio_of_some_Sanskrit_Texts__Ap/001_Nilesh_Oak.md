Beautiful. Enjoyed it.  
  
I will be using the first 4 lines and then again few additional lines during my upcoming 3-series talks on Rama-Ayana (Short route -Ayodhya-Mithila-Ayodhya), Rama-Ayana (long route - Ayodhya-Lanka-Ayodhya), and Sugriva's GPS (Geography of Ramayana times), organized by Vaishnava organization in celebration of Rama-Navami.- 2021.  
  
I hope the organizers allow an additional 8 min for the playing of this rendering of Meera Ji.  
  
Meera Ji. Sadhu Sadhu.
