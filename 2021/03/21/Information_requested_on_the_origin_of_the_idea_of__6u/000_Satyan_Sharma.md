Namaste Vidvāns

  

I'm looking for the earliest mentions of the concept of single avidyā, which has different ākāras. Citsukhācārya mentions it towards the end of his Tattvapradīpikā while citing his Guru as the authority (nyāyasudhāyām ārādhyapādair upapāditam). I also found such an idea towards the end of Ānandajñāna's Tarkasaṅgraha.

  

Is there any other mention of such an idea prior before Citsukhācārya and Ānandajñāna?

Kindly guide.
