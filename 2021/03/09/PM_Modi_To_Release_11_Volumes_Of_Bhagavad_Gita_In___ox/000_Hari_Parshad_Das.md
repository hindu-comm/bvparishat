dear vidvaj-janas,

  

<https://swarajyamag.com/insta/pm-modi-to-release-11-volumes-of-bhagavad-gita-in-original-calligraphy-along-with-rare-sanskrit-commentaries>

  
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will roll out 11 volumes of Srimad Bhagavad Gita along with commentaries by 21 scholars on the shlokas at the Lok Kalyan Marg in New Delhi at 5 pm on Tuesday.  
  
The manuscript is named “Srimad Bhagavadgita: Rare multiple Sanskrit commentaries in original calligraphy”.  
  
The PMO revealed Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha and Congress politician Dr Karan Singh, a scholar in Hindu theology and the Chairman Trustee of Dharmath Trust, will grace this occasion too.  
  
Additionally, this is the first time when important commentaries by noted Indian scholars have been brought together to comprehensively and comparatively appreciate the epic. Several rare Sanskrit commentaries in its original calligraphy will be a part of the Bhagavadgita’s release too, TOI [reports](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-to-release-manuscript-on-shlokas-of-srimad-bhagavadgita-on-march-9/articleshow/81379946.cms).  
  
This is the first time key commentaries on the Gita by celebrated Indian scholars have been compiled together for a comprehensive and comparative appreciation of the holy book.  
  
The Jammu-based Dharmarth Trust has published the manuscript and written it with exemplary subtlety and variety of the Indian calligraphy. This includes the works of the likes of Shankar Bhashya, Bhasanuvada amongst others.
