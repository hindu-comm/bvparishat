Dear Scholars,

  

I had the proud privilege of physically handling a manuscript of 12 commentaries on the Bh.geeta, deposited in the Raghunath Temple Library,Jammu in 2005. My academic trip was enabled by the Dharmarth Trust, headed by Hon.Dr.Karan Singh.

  

It seems the same ms.must be utilized.

  

Prof.Siddharth Y.Wakankar.
