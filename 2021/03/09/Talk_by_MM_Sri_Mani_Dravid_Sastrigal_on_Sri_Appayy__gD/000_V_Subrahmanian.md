This is going to be a wonderful talk on 13 March, 2021 on one of the Magna Opera of Srimad Appayya Dikshitendra by Mahamahopadhyaya Brahmasri Mani Dravida Sastrigal.

"Chaturmata-saara-sangraha" also known as "Chaturmata-lesha-sangraha" is an independent commentary of Dikshitendra on the Brahmasutras. Divided into four sections named as Paricchedas, the first section of it, Nyayamuktavali, deals with Dvaita Vedanta of Madhvacharya, the second Nayamayukhamalika with Vishishtadvaita Vedanta of Ramanujacharya, the third book Nayamanimala deals with Sivadvaita of Srikanthacharya, and the fourth book Nayamanjari deals with Advaita Vedanta of Sri Sankara Bhagavatpada. He has written each book in the way a faithful scholar of the respective Sampradaya would write. He never reveals his heart while expounding each school's philosophy very beautifully. This book could be described as a Magnum Opus in the field of Vedanta which is a combination of four Magna Opera.

It is not an exaggeration to say that Dikshitendra has written not one but 3 Magna Opera in the field of Advaita Vedanta, 1 Magnum Opus in Sivadvaita Vedanta, 3 Magna Opera in Purva Mimamsa, 1 Magnum Opus in Vyakaranam and 2 Magna Opera in Alankara-shastra. He was such a colossal intellectual.

Here is the unique beauty of the fourth Pariccheda of Chaturmatasara-sangraha. It contains more than 380 shlokas. Each adhikaranam of the Brahmasutras is represented by at least two shlokas. The first shloka puts forth the Purvapaksha and the second one puts forth the Siddhanta. The beauty doesn't end with this. He has used more than 180 vrttams or meters to compose the shlokas. Many vrttams are rare to find even in standard works of Chandas-shaastram. He was an expert in integrating the Shastra into Samskrta-sahityam seamlessly and Samskrta-sahityam into the Sastra seamlessly.

We are all blessed to hear about this great work from Sri Mani Dravida Sastrigal who is a doyen in the field of Advaita Vedanta today. We should all thank the Tattvaloka team and the Sringeri Gurubandhava team for organizing this lecture.
