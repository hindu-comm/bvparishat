Dear Scholars,  

   Namaste.

   Out of the published "Prakriyasarvasva, Part I to IV", TSS, 106; 139; 153; 174, the first three are available on [archive.org](http://archive.org). But I am unable to trace Part IV, TSS 174 published in 1954 (1958?).

  

   At many places I find the publication year of TSS 153 to be 1948. But the available one indicates 1947. Similarly, TSS 174 was published in 1954, but I find it mentionedas 1958.

For example, see below (See also: "Prakriyasarvasva- A Critical Study", p.320):
