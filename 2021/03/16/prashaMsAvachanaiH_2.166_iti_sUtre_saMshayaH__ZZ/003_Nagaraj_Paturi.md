At least in Telugu, paNDita prakaaNDulu is commonplace , at least in contemporaryusage.

  

In Kannada, though paNDita prakaaNDa is there in usage, prakaaNDa paNDita is seen as more frequent, probably under Hindi/Marathi influence.

  

In Telugu, prakaaNDa paNDitudu , prakaaNDa paNDitulu is almost not found.
