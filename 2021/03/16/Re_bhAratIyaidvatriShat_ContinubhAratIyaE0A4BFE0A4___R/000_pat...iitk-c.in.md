The Ultimate Paradox! You have expressed knowledge / ignorance of Him so  
very beautifully!  
  
Many congratulations on your completion of 75 years, Professor Deshpande!  
May you live long and continue to enlighten us on His leela! Best regards!

\> विजानतामविज्ञातो ज्ञातस्त्वमविजानताम् । इति त्वं श्रुतिभि: ख्यातो निगूढो  
मम मानसे ।।१४०७।। Those who claim to know do not know you and those who  
claim not to know know you. This is how the Vedas describe you, and now  
you are hiding in my  
\> mind.
