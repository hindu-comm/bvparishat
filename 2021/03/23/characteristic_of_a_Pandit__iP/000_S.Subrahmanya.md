Prof. Aklujkar in his artilcle "Pandita and Pandits in History"

quotes the following :

nishevate prashastäni, ninditäni na sevate I

anästikah shraddadhäna etat pandita- lakshanam II  

  

He then states :

"The Sabdakalpadruma informs us that the verse comes from Cintämani, which should be the compiler's abbreviation for Hemacandra's Abhidhänacintämani, but I have not been able to find the verse there.
"  

  

Would anyone know where this specific verse is from ?
