The problem with *anāstikaḥ* is that it can be  

interpreted in two exactly opposite senses! :

\(a\) *a + nāstikaḥ* (not an atheist)

\(b\) *an + āstikaḥ* (not a theist).

  

This is a case of arriving at the same answer  

even while negating two words which are exact opposites of each other!  

(A good case of problematic negation - somewhat comparable with  

*anupada/anupadha* that we encountered in another thread).  

  

The word *āstika* itself can, of course, be interpreted differently:

*"nāstiko veda-nindakaḥ"*
