Dear Ujjwal Ji,

  

Panini 2.3.51 \[ज्ञोऽविदर्थस्य करणे\] indicates that, for Panini, the root ज्ञा can have the same meaning as that of विद्, and in some contexts a different meaning \[अ-विदर्थ\].

  

However, it is interesting to note that the Airateya-Upanishaddoes not list a form from the root विद् among synonyms:

संज्ञानमाज्ञानं विज्ञानं प्रज्ञानं मेधा दृष्टिर्धृतिर्मतिर्मनीषा जूतिः स्मृति: संकल्प: क्रतुरसु: कामो वश इति सर्वांण्येवैतानि प्रज्ञानस्य नामधेयानि भवन्ति।।2

  

There is probably some aspectual difference between the meanings of जानाति and वेत्ति. जानाति has a range of meanings from know, recognize, and finally ज्ञान coming to include meanings like awareness and consciousness. वेत्ति seems to refer to knowledge in the sense of acquisition of information about something or other, but does not normally refer to consciousness as such. That is just my best guess. With best wishes,
