Dear Professor Kannan,

  

This is a Vārttika of Kātyāyana. Kātyāyana's view of a sentence (vākya) is expressed in his Vārttika "ekatiṅ vākyam". So, in his view, every sentence has to have a verb (tiṅ), and if it is not expressly used, it can be understood to be there to explain the syntax. I have traced the evolution of the notion of sentence in a 1987 article. The pdf is too large to be attached to a BVP message, but I can send it privately, if you are interested. Best regards,
