Dear Ujjwal Ji,e

  

  By the term aspect I mean notions like an event, a state, a continuing process, a resulting state, agentive activity versus a stable state of affairs. This type of meaning differentiation is seen in different uses of verbal and nominal forms like jānāti, vetti, jnāna etc. Even the single word jñāna contextually denotes a cognitive activity, a cognitive event, a resulting cognitive state, or ultimately a stable continuing cognitive state, or mere self-awareness. These differences are what are referred to by the term "aspect." Without looking into the context, it is not possible to give a singular translation/interpretation of a term. The Sanskrit commentaries in Śāstras like Vedānta, Nyāya, etc. provide such contextual explanations. Most verbs have a range of such meanings, and the equivalence of two verbs often occurs only in certain shades of meanings, and not across the board. The meanings "be" and"become" are indeed aspectual. This is clear from Yāska's distinction between asti and bhavati as two different bhāvavikāra "modes of existence." The discussion in Kātyāyana's Vārtttikas and Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya on the alternative definitions of a dhātu is also very instructive \[i.e. bhāvavacano dhātuḥ OR kriyāvacano dhātuḥ\]. Best regards,
