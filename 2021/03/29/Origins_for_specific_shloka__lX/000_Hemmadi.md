Regards to all,

  

My query is regarding shloka

नमः सूर्याय शान्ताय सर्वरोगनिवारिणे  
   आयु:आरोग्यमैस्वैर्यं देहि देव जगत्पते \|\|

  

I would love to know which is the original stotra or Grantham it’s from... on net it mentioned as Aaditya Hridaynath stotram, but I couldn’t locate it in the staotra..

  

Please guide me
