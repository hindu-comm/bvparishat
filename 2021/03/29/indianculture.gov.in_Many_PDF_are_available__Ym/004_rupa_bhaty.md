Dear Prof Mishra,  

  

"Dr Roy and others in these astronomical dating calculations,

Dating events and iconography through astronomical software is a new trend.

It started in Germany in the nineties to date the Vedas. It died there.

Now it has revived in India. It may have a sensationalizing business interest,  

but no scholarly advance is made through such efforts..

We just had a discussion about the absurdity of another such calculation.

It seems like the nineteenth century extrapolation Indology where they created

stories from arbitrary text markers. Indian research has been always analytic.  

Since the populance at large is mostly ignorant of the old history, I request all  

to be absolutely diligent keeping an eye towards public education.
Dating is  

necessary, but it has to be necessarily comprehensive. All conclusions should  

conform to the whole text in its contents and in its analysis. A good in-depth  

study of the text is a pre-requisite for such an undertaking. We must not  

belittle a great culture and tradition by looking for correlations.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra"

  

1. Please care to answer how "dating events and iconographies(?) through astronomical software is a new trend", which had "started in Germany in the nineties to date the Vedas". I want to understand and write a prologue in my upcoming book "The Agastya Code" which may serve as a pUrvapakSha. You said "It died there", please provide substantial evidence sothat I includethem as well. I shall behighly grateful to you.

  

2. "We just had a discussion about the absurdity of another such calculation."

This has nothing to do with my dating of Agastya --19000 BCE. BTW, I don'tknow from where 19000 BCE appears in the refutation of 9500 BCE of Nataraja and Sangam period evidence).

  

3. "Now it has revived in India."Care to explain since this goes against **Koothu (Natraja), the dancer(kUttan) constellation**, which is a composite constellation of Adra+Mrigashirsha, which is mentioned in Malabar navigation system and in Malum ni Pothi navigational manuals and "**IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH ORION, ARDA(**Betelgeuse**), MRIGASHIRSHA(**Orion**) i.e., SHIVA-RGVEDIC RUDRA'S NAKSHATRA.** It has everything to do with**verb root Mriga means chaser. MRIGASHIRSHA--MRIGAVYAADHA, WHICH IS ALSO KNOWN AS RGVEDIC INDRA'S SHUNASIRA/SARAMEYA and INDRA WHICH IS KNOWN AS RUDRABAHU. RUDRABAHU IN TURN IS RELATED TO "INDRABAHU", WHICH IS ANOTHER NAME OF AGASTYA**". AGASTYA HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH SHIVA, they are inseparable and thus Agastya is another name of Shiva. "The pauranik lore of Agastya sent to the south by Shiva" is no figment of imagination by our ancients. They were not writing GIGO. Your goodself also is unaware of ethnographic memory of ADRA Darshan festival of Southern India. In all these analysiscomes the verb10मृग, which means "Chase", verb 4 which means "Seek after and search for", and thus all these are hunter group constellation. And thus it's clear that the Hunter word originated in India Itself. Kindly specify how I should analyse these datas. This will give me more insight to how to do scholarly works with an in depthanalysis.

  

4\. "It may have a sensationalizing business interest, but no scholarly advance is made through such efforts.." Kindly provide or share the gathered data that these are no scholarlyadvancements, this appears to be a highly generic statement, please elaborate so that I can take care of my deep analytical studies.

  

5. "It seems like the nineteenth century extrapolation Indology where they created stories from arbitrary text markers. Indian research has been always analytic."

Moreover we had all the datas and it was Coomarswamiand then Carl-Sagan who floated the theory that the Hunter constellation is Shiva Nataraja. I have contributed that the Lepus constellation is Indian MUYALAKA which itself is very clear since lepus means Hare and MUYALA --is also Hare. What was wrong in that. And why epilepsy like noun for an Asura assigned, that has to be understood by listening to my talks many times,which discovers Nataraja and Agastya connection nearChidambaram latitude.

  

6. "Since the populance at large is mostly ignorant of the old history, I request all to be absolutely diligent keeping an eye towards public education."As of now it appears that the flag bearers are themselves under the spell of ignorance on how to connect the dots and analyse any data lying before their eyes.

  

7. "Dating is necessary, but it has to be necessarily comprehensive."

I have done a very comprehensive study of the iconography "Sthapatya"of Nataraja as well as of the Koothu constellation which I hadpresented in a seminal paper 4-5 years back inSwadeshi Indology 3 conference organised by Shri Rajiv Malhotra ji. This is a peer reviewed paper (which has been refuted). What more can be expected from an architect in regard to Sthaapatya and Vastushilp Shastra? Kindly explain...

  

8. "All conclusions should conform to the whole text in its contents and in its analysis."

Which text is left ? I included Shiv Sahastranaam strotamas well from MBH. "rudraanaam api yo rudrah prabhaa prabhavataamapi., "naktam kalishcha kaalashcha", "nitya nartaka"- So I showed that North also knew Shiva as nartaka similar to South who knows Him as the King of Nartakas. What is wrong in Rudra then, who are hunter/chaser in Rgvedaas well as Nartaka in MBH.**What Kind of analysesare required for all these information like Root mRRiga-hunter-chaser-mRRigashiirsha-Ardra-Rudra-Rudra-bahu(**Tai. Br.**)(**Sirius**)-Indrabahu (**M. Pur**)(**Canopus**), lexicons, amarakosha etc etc?** Can't show these connections to blindfolded people here who cannot even recognise the analyses and read between the lines in my article or list them out from my various talks.

  

  

'A good in-depth study of the text is a pre-requisite for such an undertaking. We must not belittle a great culture and tradition by looking for correlations"

I fail to understand about "thepre-requisiteforsuch an undertaking" phrase and how am I belittling a great culture by connecting all the dots...Please explain why such a genericstatement- attitudewhen you have not read and discussed my works with me, if ever you had problems with my findings.  

  

What kind of refutation has been done by Shri Raja Ram Mohun Roy and what did yourgoodself understand by that refutation is not clear to me. Each word went tangent. In fact I can do better refutation of my own work. I thus take a lot of time (years) to find all evidence and connect the dots and then to pen them.

  

Your inputs on how one should proceed with Indic research shall be highly beneficialto the new entrants here in Bhartiya VidParishad.

  

Best Regards

  

Rupa

Dear Mr. Roy

  

1. First of all the refutation of my article appears more of an incorrigible rambling which is an outburstsof a "no" to one of your posts on twitter, which had offended you badly and thus refutations appears now as an attack thus lacks ingenuity.

  

2. You answered to Mr.Subramanya out of nothing pointing towardsme whichis quite visible. First of all, for the word "amateurs" I want a clarification on the kind of authority youhave touse this word for anyone here. This is uncalled for and unwarranted. An architect has to play with equinoxes, solstices and daylight factors, seasonal impact on buildings, cities and neighbourhoods etc and I have been playing with astronomy since 1995. Architecture is inseparablewith Astronomy. I don't know how you deem yourself so expert while your qualification doesn't even confer that, and that may be your deep interest asyou wrote in your bio in Medium blog making yourself also an amateur.**I have been pursuing astronomy for the last 26 years**, how many years are you indulged in? However, it is pertinent to mention that your study is altogether of a different stream of Metallurgical Engineering, which deals with metals and their properties only.Nowdefine who isamateur,and how you deem yourself as a scholar and researcher in the field of Astronomy and Sanskrit. I will request Bhartiya-vidya -parishad to moderate such callous comments.

  

2. After reading all your refutation of my works I am amply sure that you goodself don't know Sanskritwell, since you always seek for english translation, and for sure, as well as astronomy, otherwise you would have easily cited the evidence I provided in the blog attached to you,instead you are just doing GIGO and trying to subdue the truth which is lying naked before our eyes.

  

3. I proved that**Agni is Vasanta**, now it's your turn to refute my blog by showing me that Agni is not vasanta with original text( and no translation please) and is called for Hemanta.

  

So do some "Original" scholarly works and please don't try to subdue us scholars. I will wait for the Agni- evidence to be refuted first.

  

Deem that I will be unable to refute your ramblings onAgastya case as there was no head and tail in the article. But I will end up here with a screenshot that AGASTYA HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH SHIVA.

  

Best
