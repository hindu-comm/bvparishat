Dear Dr Bhaty,

I didn't read your full mail. I am suggesting on behalf of a block of people who believe in

objective work, not correlation work. You can review all correlation work through many  

books. Astronomy does come in texts to create auspicious moments etc.
These are

semi-empirical. Varahamihira gives a whole list. They do get reference in folklores and

find their ways in astrology. You need to distinguish between a poetic reference and an

astronomical event. Poetic reference is made to embellish omens.
Different texts have

different styles. I study Valmiki's style. You can notice that when you read the whole

text and how he introduces the celestial events. "Date" as a concept has historical  

significance and history does not rest only on the sky. Historigraphy is a science by

itself, it is not cursory.  

Since many of you are young and have energy and enthusiasm, my suggestion is to

indulge in the topics deeper and be more referential in approach.  You are free

to pursue your path as to your calling. It pains me to see this quick correlation work  

which had their origin during the colonial times.

I have expressed myself as completely as I could. I wish you well.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
