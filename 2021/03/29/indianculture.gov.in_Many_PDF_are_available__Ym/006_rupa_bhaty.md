Dear Misraji,

  

I fail to understand, "It pains me to see this quick correlation work

which had their origin during the colonial times." How do you conduce that I have

correlatedwith the origins during colonial times? Kindly share the evidence that I did so.

  

Also do you mean to say that Newton should have thought

about why apples fell down after experiencing

it for thirty more long years? Science happens suddenly.

Similarly epiphanic moments happen with me. I have correlated

all the shastras here.

  

Hope you provide evidence rather than generic statements. We are doing

some serious original works. Generic statements are a distraction to us researchers.

  

Thank you in advance.

  

Rgds
