Dear Prof. Misra,

  

Thanks for your very pertinent comments. Astronomical dating can be useful if done properly. Many Indic researchers are proposing fantastic high chronology based on misinterpretation of texts and misuse of astronomy software. Garbage in Garbage out. I am trying to refute some of these researchers.

  

Best regards,

Raja
