Dr Roy and others in these astronomical dating calculations,

Dating events and iconography through astronomical software is a new trend.

It started in Germany in the nineties to date the Vedas. It died there.

Now it has revived in India. It may have a sensationalizing business interest,  

but no scholarly advance is made through such efforts..

We just had a discussion about the absurdity of another such calculation.

It seems like the nineteenth century extrapolation Indology where they created

stories from arbitrary text markers. Indian research has been always analytic.  

Since the populance at large is mostly ignorant of the old history, I request all  

to be absolutely diligent keeping an eye towards public education.
Dating is  

necessary, but it has to be necessarily comprehensive. All conclusions should  

conform to the whole text in its contents and in its analysis. A good in-depth  

study of the text is a pre-requisite for such an undertaking. We must not  

belittle a great culture and tradition by looking for correlations.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
