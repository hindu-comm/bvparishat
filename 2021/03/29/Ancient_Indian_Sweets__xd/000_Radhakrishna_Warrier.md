According to the Malayalam Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇam of Eẓuttacchan, King Daśaratha of Ayodhya performed Putrakāmeṣṭi Yajña as advised by sage Vasiṣṭha, and on completion of the yajña Agni appeared and gave the king a bowl of sweet Pāyasam to be given to his three queens for putralabdhi (for begetting sons). Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇam follows the original Sanskrit Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa so I presume the mention of Pāyasam is there in Vālmīki Rāmayaṇa also. Payas is milk in Sanskrit, and so Pāyasam must have been a milk based dessert. To this day we in Kerala make the yummy Pāl Pāyasam but it is sugar that is used as the sweetening agent. I suspect sugar was not there in the ancient days and hence jaggery (Gu.ḍ ग़ुड़) must have been the sweetening agent. We make Pāyasam sweetened with jaggery also, called Prathaman (പ്രഥമൻ प्रथमन्), but it is not Payas (milk) based; instead, we use coconut milk. Other ingredients can include Chana dal, Moong dal and aḍa (rice flakes). 

What were the other sweets consumed as dessert in ancient India? I faintly remember a story in which a lady asks a king not to throw water on her and the king mistakes it as a request for the sweet modakam. So, modakam must have been an ancient Indian sweet. Kerala Hindus prepare modakam to this day. I believe laddoo too must have been an ancient Indian sweet dessert.
