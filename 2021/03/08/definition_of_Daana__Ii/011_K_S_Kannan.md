Dear BVKSastry,

  

Thank you for your kind post.

  

Problems do not get solved by throwing in a profusion of śāstric citations that have little relevance to the issue.

Verbosity is no testimony of or substitute for clarity. Nothing smacking of any Vedanta-Arthaśāstra conflict that you love to invoke figures here. Please try to understand the actual meaning of the terms involved, and the actual issue being raised/discussed. Beating about the bush intensely, vigorously, and passionately seldom takes us to the heart of the matter. It is not unoften the case that readers of your mails get confused as to whether you are yourself clearly confused or whether you are sincerely endeavouring to confuse others (सन्देहभ्रान्तिमदलङ्कारयोस्सङ्करो वा न वा?).  

  

You do not have to invoke "an editorial comment upon an assumed variant reading" of a famous and uncontested definition. Here, for example, is a crystal-clear exposition of the issue at hand (and a bonus of related issues) : This is from the celebrated Sri Jhalakikar's *Nyāya-kośa* (pp. 351-352, 1928 edn., BORI, c/o [archives.org](http://archives.org)). (And for your information, it does not deal with a hypothetical (almost laughable?) "*pitr̥tva-dāna*" as discussed in the JNMV 6.7.1 you so endorsingly choose to cite : no mark of wisdom to invoke some extraordinary/tricky situation to solve/ explain a simple, straightforward transaction. (And note, too, that there is *not a single instance of the doubling of* तकार *in the 17 occurrences* of the usage of स्वस्वत्व and परस्वत्व.)

Thanks for your patience. BTW, lovers of discussions in BVP would be highly obliged if you can deign to publish at least a brief errata of each of your long mails.

  

Regards

KSKannan
