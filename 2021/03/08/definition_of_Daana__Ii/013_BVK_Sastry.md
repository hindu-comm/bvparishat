Namaste Prof. KSK



 Have I erred in understanding the present thread from its
‘origination: seeking a definitional clarification and source’ to current state of exchange gong on ‘ scripting convention’ with a helpful suggestion for me to undertake an errata publication of my posts on BVP? ‘? - Please help me to understand. 



1. I shared some thoughts, believing that might be helpful to restore the prime issue on ‘daanam’- definition in meemaamsaa aligned to technicalities in gita, Meemaamsaa and vyakarana. The intention was to come back to the main issue of definition, which was taking exit
to ‘script-print conventions’ , the forced exits introduced by you inthis thread. 



2. In my ‘ narrow vision, response and understanding’, here below is the way the thread of post started and deviated due to forced comments provided by you, leading to exits.

The forced exits provided by you pushed the response exchange
from ‘ definition-focus’ to ‘ scripting letter -duplication’.

 The forced exit introduced by you blocked the exploration of key connection of ‘Meemaamsaa- Gita- Vyakarana’ on ‘daanam’ linked to ‘tyaaga’ using the term ‘ स्व’ .

Instead of capturing the ‘essence of स्व’, you forced the
‘scripting issue of स्व-सत्त्व – स्व**स्वत्व****.**



2a. The starting point was ‘Sri Subramanya ji’ asking for source -reference of ‘daanam’ in context of ‘ Meemaamsaa’ where the term \< स्वसत्व\> occurred ( as seen on web page/ mail).

2b. This was responded to by Pandit Jagannatha

 \< स्वसत्त्वनिवृत्तिपूर्वकम् इत्यत्र आत्मसंबन्धत्यागपूर्वकम् इति पाठान्तरम् ; परकीयस्वत्त्वापादनम् इत्यत्र परसंबन्धापादनम् इति
पाठान्तरं सूचितं

 संपादकीयायां टिप्पण्याम्।\>. The question of ‘ doubling in script or pronunciation did not surface.

2c. Prof. KSK’s keen ‘ Hawk-eye’ caught some inconsistency and responded :

\< श्रीमन् ! स्व**सत्त्व**निवृत्तिर्न ! स्व**स्वत्व**निवृत्तिरित्युच्यताम्। एवमेव परकीय**स्वत्त्व**मिति न !
परकीय**स्वत्व**मित्युच्यताम् ।

2d. Even after the clarification was provided by Prof. Deshpande reading was not enough ! 

\< ग्रन्थप्रकाशनादिकार्येषुभवतां मतमवश्यमङ्गीकार्यम्। हस्तलिखितग्रन्थेषु बहुत्र वैकल्पिकमपि द्वित्वं लेखने दृश्यते ।

विशेषत: "वर्त्तते" इत्यादिशब्देषु इदं द्वित्वलेखनं मया हस्तलिखितग्रन्थेषु बहुत्र अवलोकितम् ।\>

The original ‘ definition related -debate’ got further forcibly
distracted to ‘grammar rule- printing and handwriting conventions involving doubling of letters 

\< **स्वत्व-परत्व**शब्दयोस्**तकारद्वित्वं**किंस्विदवलोकितमिति जिज्ञासे । \> ! 



3. Anyway, it is nice to get keen ‘ red-pen audit’ from the vigilant scholar’, ever alert ‘ Spell Checker’. 



KSK, We can discuss on what is the common ground between our understanding of Vyasa Vedanta-Sampradaya and Chanakya -Saamraajya -sampradaya of Purhsartha presentation in the \< Vedanta-Arthaśāstra> model \< HIS Wealth and Purpose (Gita :9-4; 10-41) as Parama-Purushartha v/s Individual Person-purpose and relation to
money -possession ego linked ( स्व**सत्त्व**** - **स्व**स्वत्व** ) wealth as ‘Purushartha’> on a phone call , or better in person over a cup of tea.



4. Rest of your observations, Thanks for the flowery language ( (पुष्पितां वाचं). Thanks for your offer . I will certainly take your help for proofing- errata compilation of my \<long e-mails and writings \> at some point. Who else can be better qualified than you to help me in this effort .
