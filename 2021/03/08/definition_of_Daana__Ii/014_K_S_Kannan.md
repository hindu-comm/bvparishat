Dear BVKS,

  

My advice to you is to try to confine yourself to *mānuṣa ānanda*. Your constant ethereal escapades escape the comprehension of the ordinary mortals that constitute the bulk of BVP. Appoint half a dozen proof-readers for your writings, please. (I am my own proof-reader because I can't afford to appoint a proof-reader, and that is why I don't write much either). You are imparting an inferiority complex to almost all the poor readers as your writings often loom as incomprehensible: should the texts crafted by you (or I) be felt as *aphalām apuṣpām*? Some readers will even have been puzzled surely whether you relinquished the leitmotif of your thesis of talk-yoga which used to be ubiquitous in your writings, yet was badly missed in the previous long mail!: can senescence overtake (or rather take over) sense?  

  

Multidisciplinarity (*even at the thought of* the drop of a hat) seems to have become an obsession with you, but better substitute it by lucidity, at least now and then. Once in a way, try to see whether your own writings are transparent : read as a reader, and understand his/her situation - contrast the supernal flight of the writer (in you), and the infernal plight of the reader (in us)! I guess the force of your memory is your undoing: you saw two *sva*-s in **svasva*tva* (in the definition) of *dāna*, and how your mind at once seized **sve sve** (*karmaṇy abhirataḥ*) of the Gītā ! - see the sway of memory! : it never ceases to seize the opportunity. Swell not on words; dwell instead on ideas. Two same syllables in consecution, and your mind irrepressibly recalls some similar juxtapositions - sense or no sense, pertinent or impertinent. Curb that temptation, Sāstrin, control! *dāna* is giving up, after all; not forcefitting; or, have you given up giving up? Tell me, doesn't *sva-satva-nivr̥tti* amount to self-annihilation!?  

  

Don't you see that my "forced exit" issues merely from my spell-check instinct? (No garden path sentence intended please). It can spell disaster sometimes (as I cannot cast a spell as you easily can, after all)! Pāṇini too bothered too much about doubling, and don't you think that his *abhyāsa/āmreḍita* etc. speak of his own 'double' standards? And why just two or three? He can conjure 108 pronunciations of more or less a same spelling! : just his *puṁskokila* outhawks all hawks! (And me, a bespectacled poor creature, is a hawk to your probing eyes?)  

  

Anyway, you accuse me of downing the unimpeded aerial flights of *dāna*-speculations - grounding it to but a mundane spellright issue, and I don't think I can dispel the disillusionment that has ensued. You point to many things I cannot see - for example "money-possession ego" in *svasvatva* : isn't 'seeing, you see not' the characteristic of a *mūḍha* (= *paśyann api ca na paśyati mūḍhaḥ)?* And when we cannot see eye to eye on even dry and drab issues, can a telephonic call or a cup of tea undo all this, and elevate us in no time from the real to the ethereal (- or really the surreal)? So let us not waste each other's time: who is not afraid of *sva-satva-nivr̥tti*, after all?!

  

But don't forget to read Jhalkikar on the issue: he can eliminate all your doubts (if you had any, that is, in the first place). The moment you realise why there indeed are two *sva*-s in succession, realisation dawns, stunning you into silence! : and with the Aha effect, verbiage gracefully yields place to reticence, eloquence to quiescence; *Vāco-viglāpana,* as the *upaniṣad* puts it, just ceases. Or if you liked Wittgenstein better, "Whereof we cannot speak \[sensibly\], thereof we \[ought to\] remain silent".

  

You are welcome for a cup of tea if and when you discern to have casual chats.

  

Regards
