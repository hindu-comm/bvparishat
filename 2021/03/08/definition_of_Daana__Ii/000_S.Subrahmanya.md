namaste,

  

It is said that Jaimini-Miimaamsa Sutra defines Daana as

स्वसत्व-निवृत्तिपूर्वकम् परस्वत्वपादानाम् (??) - said to be 4.2.28 (??)  

  

I cannot seem to find this specific source on the net.

If anybody has this, will be very thankful if you could share it.

  

Regards

S.Subrahmanya
