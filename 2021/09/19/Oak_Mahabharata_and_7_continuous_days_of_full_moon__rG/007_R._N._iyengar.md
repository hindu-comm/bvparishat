Dear List,

The shlokas Dr.Roy has pasted from Twitter, as from MB (Yuddha parvan 5 & 6), are quite intriguing. Are they traceable in any MB versions of yore? In the versions I am having I could not locate them anywhere in the Epic. Hence this question. Perhaps members on the list more familiar with the different versions of MB text can help. I know MAHE, Manipal has a Centre devoted to MB studies. It would be helpful if some one from Manipal could indicate the source of the two verses.
