Dear Dr Raja Roy,

  

This message of you has the same feature that I see in many of your efforts to call anything connected directly or indirectly to what you think bad as bad.

  

Your logic starts with Sri Nilesh Oak. Then it goes to wherever some favor is found to his chronology work.

  

The big or small institute that mentions his name as regular or adjunct faculty , some IKS body that organizes his talk, some film making group that makes films that include films connected to his work, the followers on twitter for his twitter account etc., etc.,

  

An organization that funds the non Nilesh Oak films by a film making group that makes films including the ones connected to Sri Nilesh Oak is asked by you to stop funding even the non Nilesh Oak films. Logic ? If you don't fund this group, they will not be able to have the pool of funds for making Nilesh Oak connected films among others. If you don't fund, others will not be encouraged to fund them. The film making group should not have funds for making any films at all. Because any fund with them will be included in the funds that go into making Nilesh Oak connected 3/10 films also. So ultimately the only way the film making group should be allowed to make even the 7/10 non Nilesh Oak connected films is by relinquishing the 3/10 Nilesh Oak related films. If your activity includes any direct or indirect encouragent to Sri Nilesh Oak, I will not allow you to perform any of your activities. Any activity of an individual or organizationthat is connected directly or indirectly to the work of an individual or organization that is directly or indirectly connected to the chronology work of Sri Nilesh Oak should be stopped because that is the way the work of Sri Nilesh Oak can be discouraged and deplatformed and ultimately destroyed.

  

Are you able to see to what extent you are stretching your logic of cutting the sources of encouragement for the chronology work of Sri Nilesh Oak ? 

  

Dear Dr Roy, may I suggest that you please take a step back and see where all this is leading you to.

  

Be that as it may, organizations like ours can not, do not and will not think with such unrealistic and unhealthy logic while taking our funding decisions. Nor did we tell you that we want to participate in your Mission Destroy (the chronology work of ) Nilesh Oak, to prove our credentials in that aspect by not being connected to anything that is directly or indirectly connected to him or his work. If you or anyone would like to interpret our disinterest in participating in this mission as our interest in promoting the work of Sri Nilesh Oak, we are aware that no wise observer of us would buy that black and while, binary, my or high way interpretation.

  

Before I sign off , let me add, just as an observer of human culture,
that you may realize that your attempts to dislodge Sri Nilesh Oak from the platforms that are hosting him will bringdown the amount of following he has on SM and among general public do not work because it is not any of these platforms that brought him and bring him the followers, it is the uncritical attraction for chronologies that affirm/attest the sacred attitude of the devout towards the very ancient dates of the sacred events in their sacred narratives that is behind these numbers of followers.

  

It is the critically academic audience including myselfwhich is ever going to remain very small, that will appreciate the critically academic work like yours and similarly critically academic responses if there are anyfrom the likes of Sri Nilesh Oak to the works like yours and the beauty of rigor in the methodological and theoretical aspects in those debates.

  

Warm regards,

  

Nagaraj
