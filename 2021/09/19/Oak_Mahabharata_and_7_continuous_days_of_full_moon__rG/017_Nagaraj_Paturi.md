1\. This is not a case of preferring not to post to BVP, while being a member of BVP, if that is what is meant by quiescent members.

  

2\. Here is a case of having a choice of responding on different forums and preferring to respond on other forums and not to respond on BVP.

  

3\. Members quiescent on BVP could be of two types: those who don't post on any forum. Those who post on other forums but do not post here. If these posts on other forums are not related to or not in response to posts on BVP, then BVP need not be concerned with it.

  

4\. If there are members who are quiescent on BVP respond on other forumsto the posts on BVP, BVP members would certainly be interested in those posts on other forums. If the BVP posts to which those posts are responses do not involve the responding member, it can be viewed as taking BVP discussions to other forums by a member who is not connected to the discussion. Still , if these posts that take BVP discussions to other forums have a mocking at the members of BVP or BVP itself, BVP can be concerned with such responses on other forums. BVP as a group may not like to have a member who does not like it and more , hates it.

  

5\. But if a member of BVP is asked to respond to a post by a BVP member in a post on BVP and the member asked to respond to the posts does not respond anywhere, BVP is not concerned with such a lack of response. But if a member of BVP is asked to respond to a post by a BVP member in a post on BVP and the member asked to respond to the posts prefers to respond elsewhere not on BVP, BVP is certainly concerned with such a preference. To infer from such preference that BVP is treated as a forum not worthy of the responses from the member choosing other forums in preference to BVP. BVP is justified in treating such preference as either no respect for the judiciousness of BVP and as such a humiliation to BVP.
