Dear Sunilji  

There are many competent scholars here who can associate with you in your research.

You may apprise them with any interpretation you might have made.

Understanding is one thing, dating is another.

This understanding is terribly distorted in modern day translated literature.  

On the other hand, I am stuck in the Ramayana for a few more years.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
