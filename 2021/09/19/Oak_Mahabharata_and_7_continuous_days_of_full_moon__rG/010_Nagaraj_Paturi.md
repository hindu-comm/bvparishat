Dear Dr Roy,

  

In behalf of BVP,  

  

Some of the messages have a direct mention of your name.

  

Some others are in an anyaapadEs'astyle. In anyaapadEs'a, it is not easy to pinpoint the target and confront the user. Even if the use of such indirect reference is to the learned senior scholars on BVP, twitteratti is not worth responding for the venerable scholars.

  

Sri Nilesh did not respond on BVP, where a written response could have been read at leisure, discussed with care by the learned scholars.

There is a big scope for interpreting this from the BVP side, as shivering on the part of the one who does not respond. But it does not behovewellon our part to respond that way.

  

But I request you on your part not to drag such SM stuff to BVP and vice versa from your side.
