There has to be a moderator on any discussion group, and Dr. Paturi is fulfilling that role.

  

Even with his attempts at bringing some semblance of order there are deliberate attempts to undermine his work.

  

I would suggest that the "irritable ones" can find other ways (writing to Dr. Paturi back channel) and other channels (social media, blogs, etc) to pursue their interests, grind their axes, etc.

  

Being deliberately disrespectful and provocative is not recommended in any forum, in any philosophical tract on communication, and not surely in ordinary life.

  

Basic rules of etiquette and decorum are a must for any group to function.

  

Thank you.

  

Ramesh Rao
