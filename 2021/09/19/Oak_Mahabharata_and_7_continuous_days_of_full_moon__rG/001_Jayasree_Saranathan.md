Dear Dr. Raja Roy,

  

In response to your mail, I have attached two pages from Mr. Oak's book on the date of the Mahabharata war (2011 edition),

coming under thetitle, "The moon appearing like the full moon Last 7 days of the war".

He does concludein that section that he has presented those "Mahabharata observations and their comparisonwith that of the full moon, duringthelast 7 days of the war as corroborative evidence in support of 'Amawasya' as the first day of the war."

  

You have raised your concern about Gita Jayanti day.

According to Mr.Oak, it is a traditional belief and he considers 'traditional belief worthless, as primary evidencein support of any theory' however he is willingto allow it as corroborativeevidence for an established theory. Attached that page too (p.98).

  

Later in the SM, I found him corroboratingthe Gita Jayanti day on the 11th day of the war in his timeline (waxing phase), under the pretext that Gita was delivered by Sanjaya to Dhritarashtra only after he returned from the war field on the 10th day following the fall of Bhishma and perhaps that was treated as the day of Gitopadesaon Shukla Ekadashi.

  

In my video I havelisted down theanalogies corroborated by him in his simulator.

[Analogies corroborated by Mr Nilesh Oak as astronomy observations (Part 7) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp5nKmvIRWM&t=6s)  

He has corroborated25 analogies in support of solar eclipseon the first day,

28 analogies in support of sharad season, most of them describing the face of the fallen warriors as the full moon.

  

In the first 10 days of the war no big hero had fallen.

Only after the fall of Bhishma on the 10th day, do we find the notable heroes falling one by one.

That is the reason for the repeated comparison found in the last 7 to 8 days.

  

Overall, Mr.Oak has corroborated only 75 Mahabharata references.

21 planetary references+ 25 analogies of solar eclipse+ 28 analogies of sharad season+ Arundhati observation.

  

Regards,

Jayasree
