Not really. A good test to see if such inference is valid would be to look for plausible alternative explanations of the observed behavior ("He did not respond in BVP"). Example: "He does not have the time or energy for email exchanges", "He's still considering the arguments presented if any", "He doesn't actually have responses worthy of being presented in BVP", "He's being engaged by the same people outside BVP" etc..

Also, the above (conveniently) omits the fact that Nilesh Oak is being engaged outside BVP by NM and RRR as well.

  

To be honest, I wouldn't mind NNO being ejected because of some honest reason like "We want to do ourbitto reduce popularity of flat-earth-level counter-scientific theories" (if BVP mods had such conviction). But doing so on such fraught psycho-analyticpretext doesn't do "BVP" (or it's figurative "mental health") credit(मानित्व++).
