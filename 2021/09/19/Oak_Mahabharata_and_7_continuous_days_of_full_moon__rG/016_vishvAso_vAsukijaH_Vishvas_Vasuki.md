FWIW, the moderator is wrong to have removed N. Oak from BVP. (PS: I am anti-\[W\]Oakism.)

  

Logical error:ridiculing or mocking at the BVP members or preferring to Tweet (or write articles) rather than writing emails is not same as ridiculing BVP or considering it unworthy of writing his responses (anyway, if that latter were a reasonable metric, plenty of quiescent people would need to be removed).

  

By the moderator's own admission elsewhere, BVP is more a Q&A forum, and not some exalted club (though I see people presenting it as if it were such - <https://twitter.com/MisraNityanand/status/1441219144494444552> ) - and it is quite ok to the mail-stream more to receive info, rather than add (mis)information.
