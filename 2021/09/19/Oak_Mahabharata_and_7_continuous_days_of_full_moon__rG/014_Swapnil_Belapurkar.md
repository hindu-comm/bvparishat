Jai SitaRam Nagaraj garu,

  

I disagree that SM counters cannot be on BVP. Shri Roy is mentioning how this Oak is indulging in scoot and shoot in social media.

  

Oak is promoted by likes of Sangam Talks which have wide reach and hence has substantial SM following etc.

I am not sure if Shri Roy has the same reach on SM.  

  

I think Shri Roy should be allowed to post in BVP and highlight scoot and shoot indulged by other parties on othermorepopular SM.
