This intention is not good either. (As I pointed out prior to Swapnil in an email moderated away by the moderator: "I find shrI RR Roy's compilation valuable. Meta-Oakism, like meta-indology provides valuable information about the health (and systemic defects) of overall hindu scholarship.")

1\. That "mining" activity is not the reason given by the moderator. It is not even the case (and reasonably so) that the mod seeks to weilddaNDa on him for being a "bad boy" elsewhere.Moderator says he is motivated by - of all things - NNO's"regard" or lack of it for BVP.Why would BVP (or those that are appointed to represent it) project such a fragile ego?

2\. He can still do it (except he won't get email notifications - not that I know if his membership settings were configured such that he did anyway).

3\. Lurking and scraping info from a public forum is not evil - I occasionally do so on the indology mailing list precisely for thekind of criticalreasons you list. It is part of being a public forum (the positive aspect being making available useful topicalanswers to search engines).
