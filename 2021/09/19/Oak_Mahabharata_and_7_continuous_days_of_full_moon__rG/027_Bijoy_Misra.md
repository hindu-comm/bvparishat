Dear Sunilji,

I did not see your mail before. To accuse Nagaraji with adjectives is totally unfair.

I have been a member of the list for about ten years now. I have observed the previous moderator

Sri Ajit Gargeshvari and the current one Prof Nagaraj Paturi both to be balanced, academic and accommodating.

Both have served with dignity and objectivity. Certain kinds of language and improper etiquette must be banned  

from an academically oriented group. A dose of disruption has infected lately and it can only go with collective peer  

counseling. Let me take the opportunity to beg all not to reduce BVP to another social group with arbitrary opinions,

sarcasm and foul language. We have the responsibility to build new India and a new world scholarship.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
