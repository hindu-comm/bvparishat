Raking up some past grievances to score points and abuse the moderator should be cause for dismissal from a group, Sunil ji.

  

Please, if we are keen on keeping this group vibrant, useful, and productive then, as adults, we better maintain decorum, follow netiquette rules, and desist from undermining the group ethos.

  

I speak from my experience of teaching communication courses for 35 years,including group communication. I am aghast at the attitude of some, who are otherwise experts in matters relevant to this group, who seem keen on disruption,showing disrespect, and playing spoilsport.

  

What are we going to teach our children, grandchildren, and our students about public discourse if we cannot maintain simple decorum here?

  

Regards,

  

Ramesh Rao
