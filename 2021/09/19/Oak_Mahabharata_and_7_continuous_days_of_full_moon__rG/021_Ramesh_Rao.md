Vishvas, the simple reason, at least in my evaluation of the NNO affair here is NNO's use of this platform to mine/scrape for snippets of information/commentary here to mock, shame, challenge and abuse people elsewhere, and be a lurker on this platform for such scraping/mining activity.

  

That is simply unethical, and may I say, vulgar abuse of the platform BVP had provided him?
