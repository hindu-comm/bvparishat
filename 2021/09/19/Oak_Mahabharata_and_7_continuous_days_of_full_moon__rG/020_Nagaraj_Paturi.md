"We want to do ourbitto reduce popularity of flat-earth-level counter-scientific theories" (if BVP mods had such conviction).

  

The academic and theoretical conviction of an individualplaying the role of moderator not affecting the neutrality that the moderator's role upholds is what ensures healthy moderation.

  

BVP members engaging a member of BVP on other forums alongside their posts on BVP can not be considered as the same as or responsible for a member's not including BVP among the forums of the member's response.

  

Members including BVP among the forums that they prefer for engaging a scholar shows that such members do not suspect the judiciousness of BVP.
