Dear Prof. Iyengar,

In one of the tweets about "Oak Mahabharata" two people are tagged as shownbelow:

![image.png](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/9410f44fc4626/image.png?part=0.1&view=1)  

  

First one is a Sanskrit expert as shown below:

I believe that these verses are being created by him based on input from Mr. Oak. These verses are not from Mahabharata but from "Oak Mahabharata" as it says in the tweet.

Other person, I believe,createsthe graphics shown in the tweet.

Mr. Oak has graduated from dating Mahabharata to writing Mahabharata.

  

Best regards,

Raja
