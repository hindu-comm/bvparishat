Respected members,

Having finished my refutation of the 12209 BCE dating of Ramayana, I have started looking at 5561 BCE dating of Mahabharata. Mr. Nilesh Oak is now writing his own Mahabharata which he has named "Oak Mahabharata". He recently posted a verse from Oak Mahabharata as shown below:

From this I see that Mr. Oak is saying that Mahabharata describes seven days of continuousfull moon during the last seven days of Mahabharata. I gathered the same from one of his videos recently.

I would like to check with Dr. Saranathana if this is indeed Mr. Oak's position and from the members if this is possible, seven days of continuous full moon?

I understand that this conclusion is based on the comparison of faces of fallen warriors with the full moon by Vyasa ji. If the face is not severed, i.e. intact, of the fallen warriors, what choice does Vayasa ji have if he has to compare face to moon, which is so common in Indian literature?

He has used these analogies to claim that war started on Amavasya instead of ekadashi. He has thus changed Gita Jayanti from Ekadashi to Amavasya. This kind of blatant distortion of our scriptures is bothering me deeply. Should Indic Academy be funding this kind of distortion (Indic Academy has funded Prachyam to make 10 movies, Oak's Mahabharata is one of them, total 3 are based on Oak's work out of 10.)

  

Best regards,

Raja
