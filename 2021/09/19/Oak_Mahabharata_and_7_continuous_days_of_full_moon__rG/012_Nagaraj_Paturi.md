Dr Ramesh Rao too brought to the notice of the forum how Sri Nilesh Oak was responding on Twitter to the posts on BVP:

  

Learned folks,

  

I was sent a link to Nilesh Oak's tweet on this matter. Seems he is more comfortable tweeting than engaging in careful conversations here.

  

But then, he does not mind posting about other matters here, and so it seems as if he is abusing the trust of this group topresent himself as a concernedscholar. If he ignores posts here but uses the information posted here to mock Nityananand Misra and Raja Roy on Twitter is BVP's plank being misused?

  

Nilesh was very fond of invoking Karl Popper and the theory of "falsifiability" for a while, and now when scholarsare pointing out that his 12209 Ramayana hypothesis does not have support, and is therefore false, it seems like he has also distanced himself from Popper! Pandering to his 31,500 followers must be an interesting vocation.

  

I don't know what he means by "skin in the game" in this context -- a term popularized by Nassim Taleb over the past 15 years in a very different context, but list members here should be urged to be ethical and professional in these matters of straddling different media platforms and leveraging the information posted here to mock and dismiss people there.

  

This is what Nilesh says on Twitter:  

  

Enjoy! I am lovin it. ![ðŸ˜€](https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/c5dMqBcdpC7rTeQ405Ba8UqPxdBJoguHH8qkrzRhzIIwak9yBs8Iwt7kTsV0_Ua_FqHvP0zHDGs_9a1Fst-BLnM=s0-d-e1-ft#https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f600.svg)  

  

Well, the good thing is these are folks with real names and now they have 'skin in the game'.

We thought that if a member of BVP does not consider the forum not worthy of being used for his responses and chooses to respond to the same posts elsewhere ridiculing or mocking at the BVP members who considered BVP as worthy of their posts, such a member can be given the previlige of not being a member of the forum that he considers not worthy of his responses.

  

Sri Nilesh Oak is no longer a member of BVP.
