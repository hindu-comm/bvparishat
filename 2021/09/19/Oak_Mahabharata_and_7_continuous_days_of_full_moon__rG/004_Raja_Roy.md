Dear Prof. Nagaraj,

  

The announcement says the following:

![image.png](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/bd184958f0f65/image.png?part=0.4&view=1)  

It clearly says that the two films are part of a larger effort to produce 10 Indic documentaries. When the money goes into a pot, there is no way to distinguish one from another. Further, If Indic Academy had not funded and put its name behind the effort, Prachyam would not have been able to raise the money they raised for the effort to make 10 films. After Indic Academy announced their support, people started donating to this effort. So I see Indic academy partly funding all of the films instead of just two films behind which it put its name.

  

Best regards,

Raja
