Dear Dr. Saranathan,

Thanksfor your detailed reply and confirming that Mr. Oak indeed insists on 7 days of continuous full moon. This is very absurd and if accepted, meansthat Vyasa ji could not tell the difference between full moon and waxing/waning moon. In fact, Vedic texts are very clear that a full moon can span a maximum of two nights called Anumati and Raakaa. Here is the text of Aitareya Brahmana 32.11 to this effect.

Keith has it as Aitareya Brahmana 32.10 and given the following translation:

I think a great farce is being played to fool people into believing that Mahabharata took place in 5561 BCE using absurd arguments and catchy infographics that has not been verified by anyone. It is sad to see so many educated people fall for this absurdity. It is especially concerning since Mr. Oak has not bothered to present the list of 575+ corroborations for 12209 BCE that I have repeatedly requested for scrutiny.

  

Best regards,

Raja
