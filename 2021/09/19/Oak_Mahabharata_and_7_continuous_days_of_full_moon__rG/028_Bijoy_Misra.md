Let me confess that I am strictly against philological reconstruction of history.

Any reconstruction must be done from the first principles. Assuming the

arbitrary base information is itself the flaw in logic.  

I have some idea what the western method of philology is and I detest.

But the copycat dating through philology in India is more troublesome.  

To me it's unscientific idle research. All history must have archeological evidence.  

I wish people spent time in locating Valmiki's location and schooling

which would be a significant contribution.
