Dear friends,

While all creative pursuits should be encouraged, the trouble comes when we attach historical dates to apparent legendary

astronomical observations. We must come out from this medieval association which still plagues the bible research.

Bible may be traced to have a historical date, like Ramayana may be traced to a historical date. The difficulty comes when

the Bible research tries to track Bible characters. We can make people fly or create divinity through special effects, but they won't

have any analytic value.  

What I am suggesting is we have to distinguish between art production and knowledge production. New India has a role

in the world to define a state of rule of law or the peaceful coexistence of diverse opinions. By insisting to find the date for

Rama's birth is a disservice to millions of us who believe in Rama and Rama's enunciation of Dharma in the world.  

Not that historical research is not possible, but it needs rigor and multi-layered analysis. Throwing sensational numbers  

through social media is a crude method which must be avoided from an academic point of view.  

I am not following Raja Rammohan Roy's research either, since I don't see sufficient knowledge value in interpreting

sky maps for dates.   

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
