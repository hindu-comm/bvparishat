Namaste to all

  

Dr Vasant G Rele stands alone in bringing a rather original interpretation to the concepts of dEvatA-s in the Veda-s. He considers them to represent aspects of human physiology. He develops his theory in his *Vedic Gods As Figures of Biology*. This, of course, is taking the traditional idea that the dEvata-s reside in the human body in a literal sense and also the traditional idea that that the brahmANDa and the piNDA (i.e., the human body) correspond/mirror each other. These ideas were hitherto viewed in several quarters in a metaphorical sense, and Dr Rele was the first to break the pattern.

  

He further takes this viewpoint and applies it to the concept of Kundalini, with interesting results. (cf. *The Mysterious Kundalini*)

  

He goes even further and finds in the Bhagavad-Gita a whole system of ancient psycho-analysis. (*The Bhagavad-Gita: An Exposition*)

  

May I ask kind members here if anyone has taken up Dr Rele's ideas and developed them further, either to prove or to disprove?

  

I have drawn a blank in my search. May I request knowledgeable members to advise any resources such as papers, articles, books, interviews, etc.

  

with thanks
