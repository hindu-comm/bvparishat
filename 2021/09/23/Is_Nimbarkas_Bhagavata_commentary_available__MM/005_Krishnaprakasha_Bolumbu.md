Scholars,  
  
The link below cites a catalogue of Sanskrit manuscript by name  
"Madhvamukhamardana", available in private libraries of North West  
Province, NW 274, Part 1, Benares 1874. By this, as Nimbarkacharya has  
criticised Madhvacharya, the former would have lived after the times  
of the latter.
