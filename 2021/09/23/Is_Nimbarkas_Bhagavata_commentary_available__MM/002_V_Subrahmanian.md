Thanks for your kind response. I had no idea that Sukadeva is the author of the Siddhanta Pradipa. Yet, after your above information, I looked up the pdf and got this:

So, the Nimbabhaskara referred to here is Nimbarka? Then, since he is saluted, the author Sukadeva must be Nimbarka'sdisciple. In that case, what is the date of this author, and Nimbarka? Your response is welcome.
