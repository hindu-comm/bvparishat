Thanks for the clarification. About the timeline of Nimbarka there seems to be not much agreement:

  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimbarkacharya>  

  

**// Nimbarkacharya**([Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit_language "Sanskrit language"):निम्बार्काचार्य,[romanized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Sanskrit "Romanization of Sanskrit"):*Nimbārkāchārya*) (c.1130 -c.1200^([\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimbarkacharya#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJonesRyan2006xxx-3))), also known as**Nimbarka**,**Nimbaditya**or**Niyamananda**, was a Hindu philosopher, theologian and the chief proponent of the theology of[Dvaitadvaita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvaitadvaita "Dvaitadvaita")(dvaita–advaita) or dualistic–non-dualistic. He played a major role in spreading the worship of the divine couple[Radha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radha "Radha")and[Krishna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna "Krishna"), and founded[Nimbarka Sampradaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimbarka_Sampradaya "Nimbarka Sampradaya"), one of four main[traditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampradaya "Sampradaya")of Hindu sect[Vaishnavism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaishnavism "Vaishnavism").^([\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimbarkacharya#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMalkovsky118-4)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimbarkacharya#cite_note-5))

Nimbarka is believed to have lived around the 11th and 12th centuries, but this dating has been questioned, suggesting that he lived somewhat earlier than[Shankaracharya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Shankara "Adi Shankara"), in the 6th or 7th century CE.^([\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimbarkacharya#cite_note-FOOTNOTERamnarace2014-6))Born in Southern India, he spent most of his life in[Mathura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathura "Mathura"),[Uttar Pradesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh "Uttar Pradesh"). He is sometimes identified with another philosopher named[Bhaskara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bh%C4%81skara_(philosopher) "Bhāskara (philosopher)"),^([\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimbarkacharya#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoiberg2000-7))but this is considered to be a misconception due to the differences between the spiritual views of the two saints.^([\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimbarkacharya#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDalal2010129-2)[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimbarkacharya#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBose1940-8)[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimbarkacharya#cite_note-FOOTNOTERaju2013158-9))

  

Nimbarka's traditional followers believe that he appeared in 3096 BCE, but this dating is controversial as historians believe that he lived between 7th and 11th century CE.^([\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimbarkacharya#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMukundananda2014-10))According to Roma Bose, Nimbarka lived in the 13th century, on the presupposition that Śrī Nimbārkāchārya was the author of the work*Madhvamukhamardana*.^([\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimbarkacharya#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBose1940-8))Bhandarkar has placed him after Ramanuja, suggesting 1162 CE as the date of his demise.^([\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimbarkacharya#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBhandarkar1987-12))S. N. Dasgupta dated Nimbarka to around middle of 14th century,^([\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimbarkacharya#cite_note-13))while S. A. A. Rizvi assigns a date of c.1130–1200 CE.^([\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimbarkacharya#cite_note-14))

According to Satyanand, Bose's dating of the 13th century is an erroneous attribution.^([\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimbarkacharya#cite_note-15))Malkovsky, following Satyanand, notes that in Bhandarkar's own work it is clearly stated that his dating of Nimbarka was an approximation based on an extremely flimsy calculation; yet most scholars chose to honour his suggested date, even until modern times.^([\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimbarkacharya#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMalkovsky2001118-16))According to Malkovsky, Satyanand has convincingly demonstrated that Nimbarka and his immediate disciple Shrinivasa flourished well before[Ramanuja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanuja "Ramanuja")(1017–1137 CE), arguing that Shrinivasa was a contemporary, or just after[Sankaracarya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankaracarya "Sankaracarya")(early 8th century).^([\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimbarkacharya#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMalkovsky2001118-16))According to Ramnarace, summarising the available research, Nimbarka must be dated in the 7th century CE.^([\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimbarkacharya#cite_note-FOOTNOTERamnarace2014180-17) //)
