Scholars,  
  
Please go through this.  
  
Quoted from Bose:  
\\\\"There is a manuscript called " Madhva -mukha-mardana", a criticism  
of Madhva's religion, attributed to Nimbarka. This places Nimbarka  
after Madhva, provided the work is really by Nimbarka. The fact that  
the manuscript is not lent to anybody by the followers of Madhva,  
perhaps prevented us as well from having it, no reply even being given  
to our enquiries. It seems Nimbarka undertook the work because it was  
Madhva's immediate influence upon the people which he had to fight  
against for making his own campaign successful. Thus, from internal  
evidences from well-known works by Nimbarka, we can definitely assert  
that Nimbarka oould not have flourished before Samkara, whereas we are  
led to think, on the evidence of the manuscript mentioned above, that  
he did not flourish also before Madhva; i.e. not before the 13th  
century A.D.\\\\
