Hare Krishna.  

  
\>\> the Nimbabhaskara referred to here is Nimbarka?  

Yes. Because Nimbarka was also known as Nimaditya. Arka, Aditya, and  
Bhaskara are all names of the sun to which Nimbarkacarya's birth story  
is related.  
  
Regarding the timeline of siddhanta pradipa and its author Sukadeva, I  
am not much aware of it. Others in the forum may throw some light on  
it.  
  
Thankyou,
