Namaste

  

Here is a mention of a commentary on the Bhagavata by Nimbarka:  

  

<https://hinduism.stackexchange.com/questions/44926/what-is-the-nimbarka-view-of-the-bhagavata-purana>  

  

  

// The siddhAnta pradIpikA is a nimbArka commentary on the bhAgavata purANa. //  

  

Is this book published and available anywhere? In the multiple commentary Bhagavatam which contains many texts including that of Vallabhacharya (sri subodhini), the Nimbarka text is not there.

  

Any information about this commentary is welcome.

  

Thanks andregards
