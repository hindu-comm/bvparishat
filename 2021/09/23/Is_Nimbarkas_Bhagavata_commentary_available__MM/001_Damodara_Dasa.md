Hare Krishna.  

  
\>\> In the multiple commentary Bhagavatam which contains many texts including that of Vallabhacharya (sri subodhini), the Nimbarka text is not there.  
  

The one that is published from Sola Vidyapitha, Ahmedabad, Siddhanta  
Pradipa commentary is involved. The commentator's name is Sukadeva, in  
case you are speaking of the same as nimbarka commentary.  
  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
