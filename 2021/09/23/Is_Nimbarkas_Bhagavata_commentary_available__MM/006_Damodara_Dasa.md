In the link you have supplied, in all references except one, the  
author of madhvamukhamardana is Appayya Diksita.  
  
Thus, it may also be assumed that the ms with nimbarka named on it may  
be some other nimbarka who is belonging to Appayya Diksita line or so.  
More details can be had by comparing the text of madhvamukhamardana  
from Appayya Diksita and that from Nimbarka.
