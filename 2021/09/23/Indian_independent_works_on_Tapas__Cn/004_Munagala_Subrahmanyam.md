In krishna yajurvediya brahmayagna tapa is used as

ऋतं तपः सत्यं तपः श्रुतं तपः शांतं तपः दमःतपः शमः तपः दानं तपः यज्ञं तपः भूर्भवस्सुवःब्रह्मोपासनं तपः ।

  

I informed the meaning of the mantra not exact mantra . Hope experts like korada sir may tell the exact source of the mantra . I know it's in brahmayagna but don't know from where it's taken .

  

Thank you
