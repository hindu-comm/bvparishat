Namaste to all

  

Many western indologists have treated of the concept of Tapas. There are several articles and books in this regard. As an example, this paper:<https://www.jstor.org/stable/1062153>

  

But the central problem with the western approach, to my mind, appears to be their excessive reliance on, and rootedness in, a "buddhistic" slant. By this I mean their chosen slant of treating what is essentially a Vedic (and early Upanisadic) concept from a non-vedic perspective or basis. (And of course, by "Buddhistic" is also meant the Jaina and the broader Sramana traditions).

  

This is a lopsided approach in my view.

  

Again, in the Indian tradition, Tapas is equated with Yoga in several traditions and systems and they are also considered synonymous by many, or alternatively, it is considered part of Yoganga-s (cf. Patanjali, also some Purana-s)

  

Is there any Indian work that examines the concept of Tapas independently, without reference to later yaugic or the nastika systems?

  

I think there must be someone who must have treated Tapas independently, in the proper sense in which it is used in the Veda-s and the Upanisad-s. (For example, say, the sense in the Taittiriya Upanisad)



I would appreciate any guidance in this matter.

  

kind regards
