Dear friends,

We love our parents and learn from them. I came from a home

where my father was hardly at home. He was a brilliant student  

and the family wished him to join the British Civil service. He met  

Netaji Subhash Bose in Calcutta in 1940 and chose a different

line in life. Both went to the same High School in Cuttack.

Netaji disappeared after a few days and my father had to go on

his solitary journey. He became a leftist and was jailed for

five years. He did marry eventually, but declined his

inheritance. I think he took an internal vow to simulate the life

of the common man toiling India. My mother insulated us from the

"experiment". I realized pretty late in college. My father

became a celebrated poet with a huge following, but refused to

accept gifts or honors. He would be jailed periodically which  

became drastic in 1972. I had returned from the US after a  

brief tour as a Visiting Scientist. India was in despair. I struggled

and then learned that they were arresting the family members.  

I escaped in 1974. I could support my mother and maintain

the home. My father passed away a free man in 2000 at the

age of 80.

Last year was his centenary. I did travel to India in March,

but Covid showed up. Today the Central Sahitya Academy  

hosted his centenary event at Cuttack. Further events are  

at Delhi next month. Books are being released. I am writing

a bio as a textbook for the Academy. His life comes out

extremely nonlinear not mapped as we see life.  

Thought to share.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
