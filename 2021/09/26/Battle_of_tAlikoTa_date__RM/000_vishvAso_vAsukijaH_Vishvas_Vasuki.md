Battle of tAlikoTa is supposed to have happened on 23 January 1565 ("Tuesday, 23 January 1565, according to Sewell andFerishta" says nIlakaNTha shAstri). Some say it is 1565-01-26 Julian Friday (which IIRC roughly matches local muslim tradition, eg -<https://www.deccanherald.com/content/593949/retracing-battle-talikota.html>).

wiki says: "There exists debate as to the precise dates.^([\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Talikota#cite_note-:5-2)[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Talikota#cite_note-:6-15))Span-lengths vary from hours to days; descriptions of battle formations and maneuvers vary widely, as well.^([\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Talikota#cite_note-:5-2))"

  

What's your opinion on the correct date?
