Dear Friends,



Happy to announce the release of my book in Hindi 'अन्तर्जागरण: नव उपनिषदों के कुछ विशेष प्रकरण' on some special sections and some insights into nine of the principal Upanishads (excl Isha and Mandukya). It is available on Amazon in India (<https://www.amazon.in/dp/8195269273>) and worldwide, as well as on the publisher’s website (<https://www.zenpublications.com/forms/BB92EA3B_Antarjagaran_Nav_Upanishado_Ke_Kuch_Vishesh_Prakaran_(Hindi).aspx>).



If you are interested in the Upanishads, I am sure you will find some revelations here! Please do purchase and enjoy!



Uttara Nerurkar.
