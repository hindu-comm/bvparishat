Respected Scholars,

Namaskars.

As there was a limitation of 100 participants, Samskrit Promotion Foundation could not make the invite link public.

Prof. Ramasubramanian IIT Mumbai launched the book and gave a comprehensive review on the content, exercises and different sections of the book.

Prof. Amartya Dutta, Prof.Sriram & Prof. Michel Danino also shared their feedback and suggestions.

It was mentioned that Part 2 of this book will cover higher classes (Class 8 to 12)

Books are available from the following links;

1\. Only book: [www.samskritpromotion.in/bookstore](http://www.samskritpromotion.in/bookstore)

2\. Book+videos : www.learnsamskrit.online

Thank Prof. Kannan for posting.

Namaskars.
