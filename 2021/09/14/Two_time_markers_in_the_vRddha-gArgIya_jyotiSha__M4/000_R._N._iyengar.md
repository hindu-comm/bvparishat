The abstract of our recent research paper accepted for publication. I do not know when the IJHS-INSA web site will host the publication for open access.

From Jan-2021 I understand Springer is a copublisherof IJHS. Since online publishing by IJHS-Springer is getting inordinately delayed, I am sharing links to the pre-online-print for those interested in Astral Sciences in Sanskrit Texts. Feedback from the readers is welcome.
