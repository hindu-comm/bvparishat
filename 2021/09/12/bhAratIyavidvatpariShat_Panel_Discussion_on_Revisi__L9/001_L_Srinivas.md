Very interesting discussion on Hindi and related matters. I felt there was a 360 degree treatment of English, Hindi and other languages of the Hindi belt. I felt it was very informative. Thanks to Shri Kushagra-ji and others for their rather enlightened perspectives.  

  

One thing I felt could have been touched upon was whether Hindi was a language of ideas or intellectual utility in the modern world. Whether it is nor not, perhaps Hindi would still be attractive to those who speak the regional languages of the Hindi belt, as Shri Anurag Shukla-ji mentioned. Like Shri Balram Shukla-ji pointed out it would be well nigh impossible to discuss *dhvani* in Urdu-ized Hindi. You choose the right register of the language whereby you discuss virtually in Sanskrit though your sentences are in Hindi. Perhaps it would not be very different from couple Hindi speakers discussing computer architecture.  

  

Is the question then whether Hindi is at the 'basic needs' level in Maslow's hierarchy of a certain class of people ? (I've no difficulty admitting that non Hindi languages of India are in the same boat). For the other classes of people, there is a short route to their basic and higher needs. For them, English seems to be the ticket.  

  

The role of English in the development and spread of Hindi remained the elephant in the room (but for a few remarks in passing by Shri Balram Shukla-ji).
