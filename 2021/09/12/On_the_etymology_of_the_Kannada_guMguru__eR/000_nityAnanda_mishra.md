*namo vaḥ*

  

One of the words in Kannada for curly/wavy \[hair\] is ಗುಂಗುರು. As per *The Kannada-English Etymological Dictionary* by N. Učida and B. B. Rajapurohit, the word ಗುಂಗುರು has a Kannada origin (Ka.), while the word ಗುಂಗು is from Persian (Pe.). Their code for ಗುಂಗುರು is D1633, which is same as that for ಗುಜುರು, an entry (albeit with a question mark) which the authors define as “curled and tangled (as the hair)” and trace to Kumāra Vālmīki’s Rāmayaṇa (verse 6.53.43) which is quoted by Kittel. I do not have the Kumāra Vālmīki Rāmayaṇa to cross-check this reference.

  
The similarity in the sound and the same meaning make me certain that Kannada ಗುಂಗುರು is cognate with the Hindi word for curl of hair घूँघर, which has an attested etymology. The Hindi words for curly hair (as opposed to the curls themselves) are घूँघरवाले (=having घूँघरs) and घुँघराले. The *Hindi Shabdasagara*traces all three words (घूँघरवाले, घुँघराले, and घूँघर) to the root घुमरना, which means “to go round”. This घुमरना is from the root घूमना. Though not traced by the*Hindi* Shabdasagara, Hindiघूमना**is from the Prakrit root घुम्म, which as per the *Paia-sadda-mahannavo* (पाइअसद्दमहण्णवो) is from the Sanskrit root घूर्ण् = “to roll, to whirl, to turn round”. A wide range of Prakrit words घुण्ण, घुण्णिअ, घुन्न, घुम, घुम्म, घुम्मण, घुम्मिय, घुम्मिर, etc. are all from Sanskrit घूर्ण् and all relate to moving around or going around. Of special interest is the Prakrit word घुम्मिर which means “that which goes around or curls”. It is also likely (my view) that the word for curls may have been something like घुमघुम्मिर = “that which goes round and round” which in due course of time changed to घूमघूमर and then to घूँघर, a form with two घs and one र. The similarity with the name of the Rajasthani dance घूमर also is to be noted.

  

Given that Hindi घूँघर has a Prakrit origin, Kannada ಗುಂಗುರು is also most likely from Prakrit (Maharashtri Prakrit would be my best bet). There is a tendency in Kannada to replace ‘mahāprāṇa’s in borrowed words to ‘alpaprāṇa’s which would explain the घ (ಘ) → ग (ಗ) shift.

  

I would like to know if any other source has tracedKannada ಗುಂಗುರು to Prakrit.
