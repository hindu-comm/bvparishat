Respected Shri RN Iyengar ji,  

  

I am quite saddened by your mail on this day, ( my birthday) and it has hurt me to the core of my heart. If quoting your book is a sin, then Ishould tell you that the word to word translation done by you in the book in regard to Vindhya Loreis questionable. Still I have kept silent on this matter. Neither would I waste my time in regard to your assumptionsof this lore. With due respect I am quite clear and have produced facts with clarity in my write up and research. It is not my fault, it is then the fault of Parashara who says in the end that "Agastya after crossing Vindhya, **now rises and sets in the South**"(this is your translation)--if you want this statement to be for Physical Agastya in an astronomy text as you did for Ilvala-asur, (which i am guessing you will), in our private conversation (email is still with me ) then I cannot do anything about it.

  

I know that you have been filled with hatred about me for some different reasons but then it shows the world how your kindself's attitude towards other researchers is,especially those who follow yourresearch.

  

It appears that BVP is becoming a place of hatred for each other. Instead of respecting, which I always do, and have even promoted your books to be read by the masses and evaluate our lost histories, now appears to be in vain under the shadows of Mr. Raja Ram Mohan Roy. Everyone has the right to express themselves. You express yours and I will express mine. Your kind self is most welcome to do so. Let people who read ...judge. But by saying **sinner**...I mean this was quite personal. I willtake it as a gift on my birthday.

  

Thank you for opening my eyes here. Hope Shri Nagraj ji will take note of this event here.

  

Please note this Sudarshan ji. No more further conversation from my side in this regard.

  

kind regards

  

Rupa
