Dear Prof. R Narayana Iyengar,

  

Thanks for telling us what is पथ्य for us. We are good shrotas of such guidance from elders like you. Such guidance is definitely not सुलभ .

  

The essence of your 463 word brief response to my 910 words long post seems to be that the article being published under "research articles" category is wrong. Yes, I admit. It should have been published under a category like " Conference Proceedings" .

  

You say , "It is quite apparent that you have not understood the scientific intricacies involved about axial precession, visibility of stars and their logical (including*arthāpatti*) importance for Vedic-Hindu chronology. "

  

I did not join issue with you or do not intend to join issue with you getting inside the topic or content of the paper. My post did not get into or touch any such details. Hence my understanding or not understanding is not relevant here.

  

My post was all with regard to the organizational aspects of IA since you mentioned that name.

  

I know from my own experience that the chief editor of Indic Today, who is currently hospitalized withDengue, takes feedback from the subject experts regarding research articles before their publication.

  

In the present case, that might not have happened because it is in fact the publication of conference proceedings though it was wrongly included under " research articles" .

  

Thanks for alerting us about that administrative aspect.

  

Coming to the academic aspects,

  

There can be good or bad research, right or wrong research, good or bad , right or wrong methodology so to say in what is claimed as research by an author. When an author claims research in his /her article we can dispute the goodness or badness , rightness or wrongness of the methodology in that article. We can not conclude " no research" in the article unless we see such a situation.

  

For DGH like activities, anything from the Hindu insider side can be a fodder. Isn't OITobjectionable to them ? Do we have to stop publishing OITarticles ? There are AIT theorists too on the Hindu insider side. Do they not take the pro-Hindu ideas of the these AIT theorists as target for their attack ? Should we stop our activities just because some intentionally manipulating groups manipulate any of our work ?

  

There are Hindu insider scholars who are not comfortable with taking events in Itihasas and Puranas as History at all. They might say working on the history of the Itihasas and Purana texts could be a meaningful research but not the research on the historicity of the events mentioned in those texts. Among those who are interested in thethe historicity of the events mentioned in those texts, chronological conclusions vary from scholar to scholar depending on the method used. Why, even among the scholars following the same method, chronological conclusions conflict with each other depending on the details within that same method followed by each of them. We can't stop providing a platform to any of these multiple mutually debating sides. Each of these sides expressing their objections to the claims, methods and/or arguments of the side that they dispute is common.

  

Just as a forum like BVP provided platform for series of articles from one side of the astronomical chronology of the events in Itihasas and Puranas while asking the other side to respond similarly, IA and its units too provide platform for both sides within the same field i.e.,astronomical chronology of the events in Itihasas and Puranas. It is the academic strength of one of the sides that can eventually make the other side get extinct eventually, not pontifications to platforms not to provide platform to the other side.

  

We did use the word promotion and will continue to use the same in all our platforms. But we also did explain the difference between our platforming and our promoting, making it clear that all our platforming should not be taken as promoting.

  

Thanks for being a श्रोता to these tathyas from our side.

  

Warm regards,

  

Nagaraj
