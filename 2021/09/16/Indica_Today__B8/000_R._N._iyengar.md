Dear Dr.Roy,

Thanks for your mail.Normally I do not read the writings of the concerned author. However, since you forwarded it,I read it this time. Perhaps you did so because my name is taken by the author a couple of times. I wish the author had taken my first name *Narayana,* so that her sins of motivated translation, attributed by herwronglyto me, could have been reduced by a small amount! Discussing the article is a waste of time.I am sad to note that Indic Academy is promoting absurd articles on their web site as research. Or maybe they take shelter under their "about-us" declaration shown below from their website, wherein they are on record to promote *activists of their activities*.

  

<https://www.indictoday.com/about-us>

About Us:An initiative of the Indic Academy,Indictodayis a digital platform to promote the works of various academics,***activists,***authors and artists in order to showcase their activities and events.  

But then why do they need a legalistic Disclaimer prominently displayed after the article?  

Disclaimer:The opinions expressed in this article belong to the author. Indic Today is neither responsible nor liable for the accuracy, completeness, suitability, or validity of any information in the article.  

  

Yes, opinionscan vary but what about Validity of a mathematical/astronomical result? When it comes to positive sciences of Ancient India they should not be handled as if these are topics in Humanities/Social Sciences without getting the works reviewed by domain specialists. With such stalwarts as Professors MD Srinivas, M.Danino and K.Ramasubramanian on its Council, I wish IA changes its approach, when purported research articles, on Indic sciences, astronomy and chronology, are published on their platforms.

I am sharing this mail with BVP, since many IA posts appear on the BVP site.

Regards

RN Iyengar
