Thank you Nagraj ji for yourkindintervention.  

  

If I have done some errata I can be contacted for clarification. Converting from Apple software hasalways been a problem for me. I have used the original text of PT to understand and I have praised the humongous work of Shri RN Iyengar ji in the talk also. Had he not brought out this book we would not have been able to decipher this lore. Understanding Agastya as a "Star" is very critical.

  

Hope to reconcile on this matter soon. I would like to leave the group since it appears that I am or my worksare unbearable. Such senior people when they do not respect the female entity doesn't make me feel comfortable. People who want to refute my articles can follow my blogs.

  

Kind regards

  

Rupa
