Dear Prof. R Narayana Iyengar,

  

I was not able to respond earlier than this as I had to move to my daily teaching work.

  

I am responding here, first as a person representing Indic Academy in response to your negative remarks about the organization for what is published on Indic Today , one of the platforms of the organization.

  

The article under discussion is not published as part of publishing the proceedings of our conference on "Puranas and Indic Knowledge Systems"

Link to her presentation of the same at another platform

The proposal of the paper was seen as part of the analysis of 'lore' in the Puranas focusing on forms of physical landscape. How that coverage in the Puranas is analysed belongs to the analyst.

  

Participants and other panelists have the opportunity to express their disagreement with the paper presenter during the Q & A part of the conference, related to each paper.

  

Even if there was a paper taking a diametrically opposite approach to that of Smt Rupa, we would have allowed.

  

In fact , in the Q & A and in one of the other papers there was such a different / counter direction /approach reflected.

  

Giving opportunity to present such different approaches can not be and should not be viewed as promotion. Our promotion was for our Puranas that too as repositories of Indic Knowledge Systems. Parvata lore is an Indic Knowledge System. We were promoting Puranas as the sources of such knowledge.

  

We always proceedby taking it for granted that pro-Indic /pro-Hindu knowledge that we are committed to work for is not monolithic, it has a large diversity of approaches.

  

Our providing platform for sharing one of such approaches is neither promotion of that approach, nor a promotion of the individual sharing that approach.

  

IMHO, this is the bottomline or even common sense about the way organizations and their units or platforms or activities or events work.

  

In this background , I am appalled by your hasty characterization of our work as promotion of an individual or an approach or a position.

  

Particularly in the present case I was not able to understand what you were objecting to in the article published. All that I am able to see that might concern you is the author's use of your English translation of a Sanskrit work.

  

Did the author misquote words, passages or sentences from your translation ? Is the wrong quoting, ifany, from your translation what you call the sin of the author ? Do you want Indic Academy to check withyour original translation for misquoting before publishing? If that is the case, please point out where in the article such misquoting occurred. We will publish a correction with due apologies for not checking with your original translation and will take care of such aspects in future.

  

I know from your posts on BVP that you have serious disagreement with the approach of the likes of Smt Rupa Bhaty.

  

Is that approach with which you have disagreement, the sin of the author and in turn that of IA, because it published a conference paper with that approach ?

  

Or, using your translation for such approachwhich is wrong according to you is wrong on the part of the author and in turn on the part of Indic Academy for not checking for the difference of approach between the translator and the author using the translation ?

  

I know many Marxist authors using English translations of Sanskrit works by translators not holding any political /ideological position like that of Marxism or sometimes by translators holding a political /ideological position opposed to Marxism. I don't think these translators would object to the use of their translations by such authors.

  

If the Marxist author says that the translator is a supporter of his argument because it is his/her translation that he /she is using, that is wrong. (I don't think any Marxist authordid that or would do that.)

  

If Smt Rupa said that Prof. Iyengar, the translator of PT that she is quoting is a supporter of her argument, it is similarly wrong.

  

If the editors of Indic Today allowed such wrong knowing that the translator has a position opposite to hers, it is wrong on the part of the editors and on the part of IA. But in general how can any editors know the position difference between the translator and author ? So how can IA be held responsible even if Smt Rupa committed the wrong of saying that Prof. Iyengar, the translator of PT that she is quoting is a supporter of her argument.

  

(The author uses the original Sanskrit text as the source being discussed by him /her or as a point in support of his argument or claim. Translation is used only as a compensation for the lack of knowledge of or confidence with regard to the understanding of the original Sanskrit text on the part of the author. Using one translation in preference for the other of the same text only shows a respect for or authority attributed to the translator and his / her translation.)

  

In view of the above, your accusing IA for publishing the present conference paper is not justifiable.

  

Dragging the names of suchstalwarts as Professors MD Srinivas, M.Danino and K.Ramasubramanian on our Council into the discussion about some happenings in some part of IA too is unfair.

  

Warm regards,  

  

Nagaraj
