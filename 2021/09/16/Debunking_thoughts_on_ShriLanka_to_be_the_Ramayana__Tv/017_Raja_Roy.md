This picture was made by Jaipur Dialogues, which is run by Mr. Sanjay Dixit, ex. IAS. During his days of service, to my knowledge he was typical pseudo-secular. Now he has become saviour of Hindus along withAabhas Maldahiyar, who used to be a die-hard communist. Another new saviour of Hindus isNageswara Rao, ex IPS, ex CBI. He was not known to be pro-Hindu durinvg his career.
