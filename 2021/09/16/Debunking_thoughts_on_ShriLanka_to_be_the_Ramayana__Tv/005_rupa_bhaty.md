Dear Mister Raja Ram Mohan Roy,  

  

Even I am busy with many a thing,being a singlebreadwinner,household chores,children, writeups, architectural sites, art and what not. Only a request, kindly only refute the article and please don't bring into your **assumptions like what you just exhibited in the previous message. "How and why 9km wide 100 yojana long bridge?"**

  

Then there will be many questions like how Pushpaka vimana flies, why Sirasa comes out of the ocean, how Hanuman ji flies. And at the end which one is the Brahmarashistar ( that you yourself don't know neither you will be able to find it for us), what is Agastya Rsi, How can Jatayu speak, What was Pushpak vimana, how can vanara speak and finally Ramayana is a work of fiction, and so it was written between 2000BC to 2000AD (since you have pointed out Chaitra in Vasanta so the date cannot go beyond that limit and surely is landing after Mahabharata, whether of 5561 BCE or 3102 BC).

  

Neither you produce any evidence nor you produce any theoretical proof to them. You are very good at refutation without any theory and for that I surely applaud your patience as you said you are burdened with other tasks so I think you might be missing thepoint.

  

Anyways, all the best.

  

Rgds
