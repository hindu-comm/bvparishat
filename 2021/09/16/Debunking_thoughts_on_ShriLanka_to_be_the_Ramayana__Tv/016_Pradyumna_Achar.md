Respected Bhaty ji,

In that case, you would have to agree one or more of these: (a) Ramayana didn't happen in Treta (b) Dwapara is several orders of magnitude smaller (c) We can correctly compute positions of astronomical bodies 800k + years back. I believe these are difficult to establish.

Regards

Pradyumna
