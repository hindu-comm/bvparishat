Dear Ms. Bhaty,

I am not getting any nightmares, believeme. As I said in my articles, I write for the people who would like a second opinion. You are not going to agree with me, that is a given. If it was a scholarly debate, it would be settled by subject matter experts. Since there is no such mechanism on this side of the spectrum, you and your colleagues have been able to influence a large number of people, including some powerful and rich people. But power and money can't buy history, no matter how powerful and resourceful these people are. After all, one day people are going to realize how absurd it is to equate analogies with astronomical observations and dismissclearevidence based on analogies and bogus claims of 575+ corroborations. The Vartak-Oak hypothesishas been debunked byme, so Chaitra in Vasanta has no bearing on the timing of the Ramayana.

  

Best regards,

Dr. Raja Ram Mohan Roy
