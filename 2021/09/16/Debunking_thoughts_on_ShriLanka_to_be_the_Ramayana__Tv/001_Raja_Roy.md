Respected members,

Please also note the following:  

Ms. Bhaty and her colleagues claimthat the Lanka of Ramayana was at the intersection of equator and meridian passing through Ujjain basedon astronomicaltexts.These texts describe 4 cities on equator: Lanka, Yamakoṭi, Romaka, and Siddhapura.Coordinates of Lanka based on astronomical texts are (0.0, 75.8).Coordinates of Yamakoṭi based on astronomical texts are (0.0, 165.8).Coordinates of Romaka based on astronomical texts are (0.0, -14.2).Coordinates of Siddhapura based on astronomical texts are (0.0, -104.2).All four points are in the deep sea. There never wereany cities there. These are hypothetical cities illustrating the astronomicalcoordinatesystem of ancient India . Details with Google maps showing each of these point are in my article below:

If Ramayan's Lanka was at equator, then where is the bridge to it? If she takes the yojana at face value and locates Lanka at equator using 100 yojana distance, then Ramayana also says that the bridge was 10 yojana wide, which is about 90 km wide as the equator is about 900 km south from the tip of India. So can Ms. Bhaty explain where the 900 km long and 90 km wide bridge to equator has vanished? Did she take into account how deep the water is between India and the equator?Flawed research by her group may be used to dredge Ram Setu in future. Are we supposed to accept her Lanka that is hypothetical or the Lanka that exists in reality?

  

Bestregards,

Dr. Raja Ram Mohan Roy
