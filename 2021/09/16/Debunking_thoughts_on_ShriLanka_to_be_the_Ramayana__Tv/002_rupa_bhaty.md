Dear Mister Raja Ram Mohan Roy,  

  

Kindly refute the **articles which is your favorite timepass,** and have patience for I will also refute yours. BTW you have not yet answered the criteria you sought of the polestar being called as a polestar from any Indic scriptures. As you follow my blogs **ardently** you might know which blog I am referringto.

  

Refer to <https://rupabhaty16.medium.com/chinese-still-remember-the-old-man-of-the-south-pole-20f2a88115b1>

  

Regards

  

Rupa Bhaty
