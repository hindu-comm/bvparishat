And to give you a nightmare, it appears you yourself are giving proof to Pleistocene times by saying **"***These texts describe 4 cities on equator: Lanka, Yamakoṭi, Romaka, and Siddhapura.Coordinates of Lanka based on astronomical texts are (0.0, 75.8).Coordinates of Yamakoṭi based on astronomical texts are (0.0, 165.8).Coordinates of Romaka based on astronomical texts are (0.0, -14.2).Coordinates of Siddhapura based on astronomical texts are (0.0, -104.2).*All four points are in the deep sea.\`\`, the submerged cities are still being found across the world and we may never know how the deep ocean levels behave andwhat werethe previous Eustatic Conditions. When the shores get cut off and there is a sudden drop of levels at edges, that is not even rememberedinthe faintest memories of people living nearby and will never give you an idea what it was like before.  

  

The text also says "Kritaanta". I know that I am sheerly wasting my time.
