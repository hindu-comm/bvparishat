Dr. Rupa Baty:

  

I was reminded of a smart alec comment from Twitter of all places:

  

**"Hindus today are caught inbetween Woke and Oak".**

  

I sincerely hope that people caught in this space find peace.

That usually happens when people function based on hosh rather than just josh.

  

Something to reflect on maybe when one gets tired of all the navel gazing.

  

Regards
