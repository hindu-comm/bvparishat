Namaste Rupa ji,

  

I would be the last to ask anyone to leave.

You may have been blessed to not have encountered some other threads.

  

This was not directed at you. It is directed at all participants of such thread**s**.

You may be feeling otherwise, because of your current state of mind. Mostly, we see things from our own point of understanding, instead of what was intended. And even the wise get in this trap.

  

Please stay in the group.  
  

Thank you,  
Shashi
