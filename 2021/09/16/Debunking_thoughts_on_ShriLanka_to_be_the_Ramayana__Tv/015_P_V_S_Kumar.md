“debating other publishing portals” may be out of scope for this forum. But …



I do not remember who said these words, but I like them very much: “There is nothing useless in this world. Even the worst thing can be used to show as an example of how the worst thing looks like”.

I will not call this thread as a useless / unwanted thread, since I have learned few things from this thread:

1. I have learned how and where to use the phrase ‘pissing contest’ in a social forum. Wikipedia further widened my knowledge on this topic.

2. I really relished the coolness showed by party X by saying “I am not getting any nightmares, believeme. …” when party Y is bombarding with series of mails in fury. I need to practice this more.

3. “Mostly, we see things from our own point of understanding, instead of what was intended. And even the wise get in this trap.” So, true. A few times, in Ramayana, Lakshmana had to remind Rama on this point and bring him back from his delusions.

4. Most importantly, this thread has given me an opportunity to revisit some of the ancient texts to have deeper insight into the specifics the two parties are debating about.

  

Thanks
