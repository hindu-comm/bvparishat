Just an observation, on this and a few other threads:

  

The group has become 24x7 open forum for heatedly debating other publishing portals.

  

In a style, that is most aptly described in modern lingo as a *pissing contest*.

  

Instead of BVP, it has become BP raising forum.

  

Hari Om.

  

Thank you,  
Shashi
