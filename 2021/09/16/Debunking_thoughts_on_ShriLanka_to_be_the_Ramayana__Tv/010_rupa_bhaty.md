"*I am not getting any nightmares, believeme. As I said in my articles, I write for the people who would like a second opinion. You are not going to agree with me, that is a given. If it was a scholarly debate, it would be settled by subject matter experts.*"...words and many words and articulation of words.

  

"*Since there is no such mechanism on this side of the spectrum, **you and your colleagues** have been able to influence a large number of people, including **some powerful and rich people**. But power and money can't buy history, no matter how powerful and resourceful these people are.*" Please prove this that I am being aided for altering the History or else this goes for a defamation case.

  

"*After all, one day people are going to realize how absurd it is to equate analogies with astronomical observations and dismissclearevidence based on analogies and bogus claims of 575+ corroborations. The Vartak-Oak hypothesishas been debunked byme, so Chaitra in Vasanta has **no bearing on the timing of the Ramayana**.*" This is your assumptionthat you have debunked the Vartak - Oak Hypothesis. For me youhaven't even touched the subject.

  

You mean to say Ramayana didn't happen or is a work of poetical fiction or something else?  

  

Kindly refute the articles mentioned above and don't digress. Since the thread is about the two articles.
