Namaste Sri Venkataraghavan Ji,

  

Thanks for the information. I will still have to think about this and understand it properly. I am summarizing what I understand and asking a few questions below:

  

Thanks for pointing out the 6 anadi tattvas accepted. However, all vyavaharas vaidika or laukika involve this natural adhyasa and hence are due to avidya.

The Mind and the vyavaharika satya are interdependent.

  

मनसो हि अमनीभावे निरुद्धे विवेकदर्शनाभ्यासवैराग्याभ्यां रज्ज्वामिव सर्पे लयं गते वा सुषुप्ते द्वैतं नैवोपलभ्यत इति**अभावात्सिद्धं द्वैतस्यासत्त्वमित्यर्थः**॥  

  

This statement tells me sushupti is identical to realization. Is there any difference between realization and sushupti avastha?

  

मनसो हि अमनीभावे निरुद्धे विवेकदर्शनाभ्यासवैराग्याभ्यां means much more than just vakyartha jnana right? does this abhyasa vairagya refer to yoga?  

even in gita abhyasa vairagya is mainly for mind control.

  

श्री भगवानुवाच  
  
असंशयं महाबाहो मनो दुर्निग्रहं चलं।  
  
अभ्यासेन तु कौन्तेय वैराग्येण च गृह्यते।।6.35।।  


**Sanskrit Commentary By Sri Shankaracharya**

।।6.35।।**असंशयं**नास्ति संशयः**मनो दुर्निग्रहं चलम्**इत्यत्र हे**महाबाहो।**किंतु**अभ्यासेन तु**अभ्यासो नाम चित्तभूमौ कस्यांचित् समानप्रत्ययावृत्तिः चित्तस्य। वैराग्येण वैराग्यं नाम दृष्टादृष्टेष्टभोगेषु दोषदर्शनाभ्यासात् वैतृष्ण्यम्। तेन**च वैराग्येण गृह्यते**विक्षेपरूपः प्रचारः चित्तस्य। एवं तत् मनः गृह्यते निगृह्यते निरुध्यते इत्यर्थः।।यः पुनः असंयतात्मा तेन

In other words, Am I understanding this right?

  

viveka darshana abhyasa vairagya : means to me: first understand the issue, by may be vakyartha jnana and some guidance from gurus, then get viveka (discriminatory knowledge) then constant abhyasa and vairagya is needed to get the mind to be completely won over or subjugated. Then this knowledge of atmaikatva is attained by itself. ie. the ever existent atman within who is sarvantara.

  

  

My questions are: based on Gita, since I am focussing on it for my teaching course at the HUA (Hindu University of America),

  

1\) when is a person ready to say, "I am not confined to the dictates of karma or vaidika injunctions?". What is the clear decision point? is it that he should lose bheda jnana?

I am researching this topic now. I request people to help me out. how long should one continue with vaidika karma? In this regard, some people give this example of Sri Ramakrishna was asked to do some rites for his mother and when he started doing some rites, he immediately went to samadhi and could not continue. then the elder people there decided that he did not leave karma but karma left him. is this the state when one leaves karma or when one gets paroksha jnana or text book jnana with some conviction that there is only one atma and rest are vyavaharika and ultimately false? what is the right time for a person to quit karmas of any kind aihika and vaidhika. aihika includes that they are no longer indebted towards parents or family. They can walk or should walk away from samsara. there are opposing statements in the upanishads:कुर्वन्नेवेह कर्माणि जिजीविषेच्छतं समाः ।

एवं त्वयि नान्यथेतोऽस्ति न कर्म लिप्यते नरे ॥ २ ॥

  

who can get out of this vedic dictate? what is the exact difference between jnani and ajnani?  

  

further, is kutichaka and bahudaka sannyasa possible today in reality. is sannyasa dharma of begging still possible? which mutt acharya today goes begging? I have not seen any of them? hence such kutichaka (who lives in hut), bahudaka ( who keeps on roaming) are only in some literature. Or may be there are a few people out there. I am not really aware.  

  

One person in my class told me that he studied "jivanmukti viveka" of Sri Vidyaranya. he said he is employed and has two children. he said: All this book is telling me is to plan for either kutichaka or bahudaka sannyasa? are all these books intended for everyone? who is the right adhikari for such a book?

  

I am only interested in Sri Shankaracharyas' works only. I prefer to stay within the limits of prasthana traya bhashya of Sri Shankaracharya (which are non controversial, since they are accepted by all). Preferably if we can get more out of Gita bhashya, that would be useful. I mentioned jivanmukti viveka only since it popped up in my class.

  

I am researching this "transition from being a karmi to being a jnani" carefully based on only Shankaracharya's prasthana traya works: preference given now to Gita bhashya if possible. However, I can understand from other sources also: Upanishads, sutras.

  

2\) in verse daivi hyesha guna mayi mama maya duratyaya is this Brahman (saguna) a product of maya or maya is under his control? this is not clear from the bhashya there. I feel this saguna brahman is due to karana upadhi. I dont know where to find more information on this karana upadhi.

  

3\) in the statement given in your email:

In advaita, both the jIva and Ishvara are admitted to be beginningless - जीव ईशो विशुद्धा चित् तथा जीवेशयोर्भिदा। अविद्या तच्चितोर्योगः षडस्माकमनादयः ।।So the idea of Ishvara being a creation of the jIva's making is not accepted, because both jIva and Ishvara are beginningless.  

  

I think, the anadi term does not mean "nitya". in advaita there is only one nitya vastu: nirguna brahman. Eventhough these 6 entities are anadis, they are still experienced or known due to avidya / adhyasa. This avidya is anadi but not nitya. it is sad-asad-vilakshna. all vyavaharas are only in the realm of avidya. Do I understand this correctly?
