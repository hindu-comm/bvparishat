Namaste to everyone,

  

I wanted to ask a question regarding this statement:

  

I got this statement from the Internet. It says this is a quote from Sri Nisarga-Datta-Maharaj. I did not verify to find out whether he really said this. I took it as I got it from the internet.

"The way to truth lies through the destruction of the false. To destroy the false, you must question your most inveterate beliefs. *Of these, the idea that you are the body is the worst. With the body comes the world, with the world - God, *who is supposed to have created the world and thus it starts - fears, religions, prayers, sacrifices, all sorts of systems - all to protect and support the child-man, *frightened out of his wits by monsters of his own making*. Realize that what you are cannot be born nor die and with the fear gone, all suffering ends." \~ Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj . *His students, say, he prayed everyday! (“got used to it !”)*  

*  
*

*Is this statement in total agreement with the Shankaracharyas-prasthana-traya-bhashyas?*

*Namaste, thanks.*

*Best Regards,*
