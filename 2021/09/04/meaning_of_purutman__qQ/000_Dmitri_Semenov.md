Word purutman occurs in RV 8.2.38b as a characterization of Indra

Wilson gives translation of it as  

 "present in many places"  

Griffith --- "all-present",

Geldner --- langlebigen (long-lived)

Grassman --- lebensreichen (life-like ?)

Elizarenkova --- долгожитель (he who lives long)

Jamison & Brereton --- who has much in himself  

  

Dear pundits,  

What is your opinion on the meaning of purutman?

  

Best,  

 Dmitri.
