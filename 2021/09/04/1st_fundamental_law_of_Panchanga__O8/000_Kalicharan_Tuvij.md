"The pivot is where surya and chandra move with the same speed"

1\) This pivot is known (by definition) as *mAgha.*  
2) is lorded by Indra (maghavan) and brahman.  
3) shifts extremely slowly due to precession and **many other motions**, thus causing the resetting of nakshatra-s and the turning of yuga-s.  
4) with this information, one doesn't need even read Ramayana or Mahabharata in order to date the same.  

There cannot be a more natural fundamental law of time keeping than this. I'm offering this (as hypothesis) so that others may take it further (facing paucity of time myself).
