Dear Mr. Tuvij,

Can you please explain what your hypothesis is in detail. How can the sun and moon move with the same speed as one completes rotation in a year and another in 27.3 days? Whose definition is it that this pivot is known as Maagha? What do you mean by "shifts extremely slowly due to precession and**many other motions**, thus causing the resetting of nakshatra-s and the turning of yuga-s"? How does it shift by precession and what are these other motions? Do you have anything quantitative in your hypothesis? I can not make any sense of it.

Best regards,

Raja
