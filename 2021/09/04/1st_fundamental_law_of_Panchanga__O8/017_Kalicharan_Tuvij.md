Venkat ji,

  

Your reading is 100% correct. And you don't seem to have any trouble whatsoever in understanding all that.

  

In our country, organised research, even at the highest levels is beset with the basic problem of (mis-)communication (the so called diversity among Indian groups doesn't help). IMO it has more to do with the lack of a shared ethical worldview (the question of Panchanga also belongs here) than with the modes of communication itself.

  

"Every Indian thinks every other Indian as a fraud- hiding something- unless he/she expresses everything in binary (0-1-0) format."

  

"I'd say, as a nation, better self destruct."
