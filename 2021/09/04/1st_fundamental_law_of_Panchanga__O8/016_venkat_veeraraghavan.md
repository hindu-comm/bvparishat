Shri Paturi Garu:

"seeking for some common cause from the three digit IQ part of the universe."

The above sentence is malformed but no insult is intended to Shri Rajaram.

If anything Shri Kalicharan claims to have 2 digit IQ (by implication) and is seeking help from the 3 digit IQ part (which includes Dr. Rajaram).

We live in sensitive times where people take umbrage left, right and center.

I would request Shri Kalicharan to write in complete sentences to prevent such gross miscommunication.
