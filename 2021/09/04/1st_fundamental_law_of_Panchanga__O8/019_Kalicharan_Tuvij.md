Let me add to the OP (slowly as time permits).

  

The original term for "pivot" isनभ.

"इन्द्रो नभश्च"

Indra rules this point. Another devatA owning (native to) the point is ब्रह्म, understood as तप (also the Vaidika name of the month that is known in laukika asमाघ).

  

What does this say?

This says that madhu, mAdhava etc are luni-solar months and are equivalent, in every whichever way, to Chaitra etc months.

Why? Becauseनभ is defined in the context of luni-solar framework only, as explained ("mathematically speaking...") earlier in the thread.

  

After all, when yuga-s change, nakshatra-s also change (refer OP), and so must the laukika names of months. Vaidika is permanent, laukika temporary. वा?
