"तपो ब्रह्मेति" - so goes an old remembrance.

---------

  

 Ideally, माघ should be equally spread - on both sides - of the नभ point. But due to fixed nakshatra-s through a yuga, minute errors accrue. In this way, at a given point in time, only one of the अमान्त and पूर्णिमान्त panchanga-s offers the desired accuracy; clearly, it can be said that अमान्त and पूर्णिमान्त exist to serve this purpose, and both are correct in their respective halves a yuga.

  

P.S.

By "yuga" in this thread, we mean:

1\) the span of kali, or

2\) 1/2 the span of dvApara, or

3\) 1/3 the span of tretA, or

4\) 1/4 the span of sat
