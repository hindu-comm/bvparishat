I would ignore such expressions that reveal the IQ level of the user, Sri Raja Roy-ji.

  

IQ is mental age divided by chronological age.

  

If the user really thought that he was insulting you through that, that reveals that his mental age is less than his chronological age. Two digit IQ.

  

Please ignore.
