We make our assessments based on prior interactions. Mr. Tuvij had made these completely unjustified comments on Shri Nityanand Mishra'sarticle refuting Mr. Nilesh Oak. Nityanand ji's article was very detailed and scholarly and Mr. Oak had not made any counter-argument. Then how did Mr. Tuvij come to thisconclusion?
