Thanks for the clarification, which was much needed given your history of yourself getting confused (and trying to confuse the gullible readers) between writing and actual sound. For example here (already quoted with reference above):

With such confused, weak arguments you ruin your otherwise well written criticism of, for example, Goldman, who has no reason to adhere to Gita Press style or whatever the trend in modern India.

  

For those who have seen the bindu used only for Anusvāra all their life (almost impossible, but still), it is best to update their knowledge of the script (or "legend" to the maps) with a more generic universally-applicable meaning of the symbol which holds true also for the "correct style" of Sri Nityanand-ji:

-   Bindu before virāma represents makāra. -   Bindu before a vargīya vyañjana symbol represents the corresponding
    pañcamavaṛṇa. -   Bindu before *y, l, v* symbols represents the corresponding
    anunāsika (य्ँ, ल्ँ, व्ँ). -   Bindu before any other vyañjana symbol represents Anusvāra.

The above is sufficient for manuscripts. In modern writing with spaces, the following can be added.

-   Bindu before a space, itself followed by a vargīya vyañjana symbol
    optionally represents Anusvāra, but also (often pronounced so in
    practice, thus actually completely disrespecting the "correct
    style", but not Sanskrit phonology or Grammar) the corresponding
    pañcamavaṛṇa. -   Bindu before a space, itself followed by*y, l, v*symbols
    optionally represents Anusvāra but alternativelythe corresponding
    anunāsika (य्ँ, ल्ँ, व्ँ).  
-   Bindu before a space, itself followed by any other vyañjana symbol
    represents Anusvāra.

Most literate Hindi speakers would correctly determine the pañcamavaṛṇa from, say, *संतः,* though they may pronounce the visarga wrongly. I don't know where the common sense of Sri Nityanand-ji goes in such scientific, machine-processable systems as scripts, while he expects me to "understand" his "Anusvāra" as a symbol which he can any time turn over as a sound that "needs to respect grammar". See for example, this display of scholarship:

-   Basic mistakes regarding अनुस्वार are made by many beginners of
    Sanskrit. -   The word in Sanskrit is स्वातन्त्र्य, not स्वातंत्र्य. -   There is no अनुस्वार in तन्त्र, स्वतन्त्र, स्वातन्त्र्य, etc. -   See the rules मोऽनुस्वारः, नश्चापदान्तस्य झलि, अनुस्वारस्य ययि
    परसवर्णः, वा पदान्तस्य.

Also think of the poor scribes of the past centuries whose writing would be deemed incorrect for no reason by a great Sanskrit scholar born much later.

  

If by any chance, by "the encoding being faithful to pañcamavaṛṇas" Shri Nityanand-ji means that pañcamavaṛṇas should only be represented by their respective "pañcamavaṛṇa symbols", whatever happens to ञ् (or ज्) in ज्ञ? Why not rather switch to something like SLP, which can solves tonnes of other problems, most importantly the invisible 'a' representation in Devanagari. (Not recommending IAST which has 'h' attached to some consonants. Sri Nityanand-ji may start calling it "incorrect use of hakāra" and who knows which related Pāṇinian rules are in store for us?)

Originally intended to give the impression "I don't have any more time for this useless debate, and if I don't answer oncoming questions, its because I have made this resolution and not because I don't know the answer", this stupid statement is often misused by people who fear they might actually not have answers to oncoming questions, but who nevertheless read them carefully and are often seen (include Sri Nityanand-ji) breaking their promise and pouncing back with a reply when they can't resist their itch on seeing a very apt opportunity. But if my point has got across and he (and others of his sort) stops attacking Sanskrit learners, or hardworking scribes for their popular (in the past for Sanskrit and today for other languages) style of writing, and stop embarrassing us Hindus with confused notions about script and language in front of outsiders, its okay anyways.
