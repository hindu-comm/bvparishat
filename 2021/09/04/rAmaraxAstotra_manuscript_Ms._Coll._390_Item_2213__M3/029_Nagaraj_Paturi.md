Dear Vidwan Sri Ujjwal,

  

I have high regard for your good manners in general and good scholarship at a young age.

  

I take my moderating decisions depending on the merits of each given post as per our moderating policy.

  

No malice intended.

  

Warm regards and best wishes,

  

Nagaraj
