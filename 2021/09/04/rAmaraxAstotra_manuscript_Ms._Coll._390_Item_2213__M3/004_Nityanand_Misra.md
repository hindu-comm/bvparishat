This long-winded, confused, and poorly-argued post not only mixes up many unrelated concepts but also misattributes a position (in fact several positions) to me in a classic case of misrepresentation.

  

Statement A: The scribe knew Sanskrit

Statement B: The scribe did not use*anusvāras*for *pañcamavarṇa*sounds and did not use*anusvāras*at*virāma* positions

  

What I said in my post: B ⇒ A

  

(To be precise, I said B indicates A). The [contrapositive equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraposition) of B ⇒ A is⌝A ⇒ ⌝B.

  

Sh. Ujjwal Rajput criticizes my "insufficient model" and "wrong legend" and states this makes the likes of me (*some scholars*) erroneously conclude that if a scribe used*anusvāras*for*pañcamavarṇa*sounds and/or at*virāma*positions, then (s)he lacked the knowledge of Sanskrit.

  

So the position Sh. Ujjwal Rajput ascribes to me: ⌝B⇒⌝A.

  

⌝B⇒⌝A is the contrapositive equivalentof A⇒B, which is something I never said or claimed in my post! I said B ⇒ A (whose equivalent contrapositive is ⌝A⇒⌝B) and not A ⇒ B (whose equivalent contrapositive is ⌝B⇒⌝A). Sh. Ujjwal Rajput misunderstood my statement and misrepresented my position. He mixed up the antecedents and consequents in his mind, which is why I say his post is poorly-argued.

  

If Sh. Ujjwal Rajput really wanted to contradict my conclusion, he should have come up with some stronger logic like the possibility that the scribe was making an exact copy of an older manuscript available to him, so he may not have necessarily known Sanskrit. This is a possibility I did not factor in when I wrote my email.

  

To clarify once again, I very well know that even Sanskrit scholars use*anusvāras*for*pañcamavarṇa*sounds and at*virāma*positions. I never claimed that somebody who does this (use*anusvāras*for*pañcamavarṇa*sounds and at*virāma*positions) does not know Sanskrit in my post.

  

Retaining the*pañcamavarṇa*s is**not "my own style" or "my model". The faithful encoding of *pañcamavarṇa*s is the style that many purists deem to be "correct". I am happy to belong to this camp of purists which includes Gita Press and many other reputed publishers who publish Sanskrit texts in Devanagari script. I was present at a conference in 2016 when Prof.K. Ramasubramanian of IIT Bombay objected to the use ofanusvāras for*pañcamavarṇa*s in a Devanagari presentation by another Sanskrit scholar*.*

  

Finally my assertion: One needs a basic (and sometimes advanced) knowledge of Sanskrit to know where an*anusvāra*sound may replace a*pañcamavarṇa* sound in Sanskrit. The test for this assertion would be something like follows. Start with a list of paired spellings like पञ्चतन्त्रम्/पंचतंत्रम्, पञ्चाङ्गम्/पंचांगम्, सञ्चारः/संचारः, तदाऽऽत्मानं सृजाम्यहं॥/तदाऽऽत्मानं सृजाम्यहम्॥, etc. Ask some randomly chosen Hindi-speakers (or even Hindi writers) who do not know Sanskrit to identify which form(s) in each pair (first, second, or both) are correct as per the Gita Press style (let us add for fun that they are being interviewed for a proof-reader position at Gita Press). Do the same exercise on randomly chosen Hindi-speakers who have basic or advanced knowledge of Sanskrit.
