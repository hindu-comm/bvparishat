This one confused and, may I add, ludicrous paragraph whichfails to see the wood for the trees is enough for me to withdraw from this exchange. However, before withdrawing, I will try to clarify the doubt in the *vādin’*s mind. The word *anusvāra* is used, in multiple languages, for both the sound and the sign used to represent the sound in writing. There are multiple Sanskrit-English dictionaries (Shabda-sagara, Wilson, to name a couple) which give the meaning of the word*anusvāra*as both the sound and the sign. The authoritative Hindi dictionary *Hindi Shabdasagara* (ed. Shyamsundar Das) gives two meanings of the word[अनुस्वार](https://hi.wiktionary.org/wiki/अनुस्वार) as follows (1)स्वर के बाद उच्चरित होनेवाला एक अनुनासिक वर्ण ... (2)स्वर के उपर की बिंदी. The first meaning corresponds to the sound, the second corresponds to the written representation of the sound. There are many English publications which use the word *anusvāra* for both the sound and the mark used to represent the sound in manuscripts. For just for one example, see [here](https://www.google.co.in/books/edition/A_G%C4%81ndh%C4%81r%C4%AB_Version_of_the_Rhinoceros/cTmN8Xs9xBkC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA71) (also the attached image). Sh. Ujjwal Rajput says “as far as I know”, I just wish he knew further. Presence of mind and common sense may sometimes save the day despite lack of information, but Sh. Ujjwal Rajput seems to have abandoned both these friends and ignored the very context of the discussion: a manuscript. Even the *pañcamavarṇa*s are sounds and even the *visarga* is a sound, but when words like *pañcamavarṇa*s or *anusvāra* or *visarga* are usedin the context of a manuscript or printed matter (e.g. a book or journal), what is meant is the pañcamavarṇa-signs, the anusvāra-sign and the visarga-sign respectively.

  

This is my last post on this thread.
