I am sorry, Sri Ujjwal. With this post you too (Yes, that Shakespearean " You too !) slippedinto the need to get moderated.

  

I request all these youngsters to exercise emotional intelli=gence during their conversations.

  

Harsh and impolite language , instead of, as you might expect, making your argument powerful , makes it (at least appear as ) weak. Thus is counterproductive.

  

The strength of your argument should lie only in its reasoning aspects, not in the harsh words used against the prativadin or his expressions or arguments.
