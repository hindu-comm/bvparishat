Good (and concise) answer(s)!

I wouldn't put it past Goldman to not have known (or cared for) the distinction between anusvAra and makAra. Reasons:

  

\- Most western Indologists don't belong to the class of Cardona, Whitney, etc.. Sanskrit sounds are not sacred to them, and mispronouncing them does not alter "adRShTa" as far as they're concerned.

\- He pronounces makAra quite well - haven't seen him pronounce anusvAra.

\- His devanAgarI praveshikA says: "m anusvāra: This sound is realized by permitting the air used in the articulation of a preceding vowel to escape through the nose. If, however, the anusvāra is immediately followed by a sparsa consonant, it will be realized as the nasal belonging to the same varga as that consonant: e.g., vanam gacchati would be pronounced "vanañ gacchati." " , which while not wrong, is quite unsatisfactory due to incompleteness.

  

So, this carelessness merits being highlighted as part of Hindu criticism. Although, nityAnanda could (should?) have been careful to give him the benefit of doubt and said : "G either does not know/ care for the distinction m vs M or **does not care to follow the dominant modern devanAgarI orthography**".
