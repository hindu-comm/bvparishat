This Rāmarakṣāstotra manuscript, with exceptionally beautiful calligraphy, was written on 19 September 1905 (5 Āśvina Kṛṣṇa VS 1962) by Govinda Prasāda Gupta in Kashi. He wrote it to be given as a free gift to Brahmins (see folio 8: यह श्रीरामरक्षास्तोत्र ब्राह्मणों को धर्म्मार्थ देने के निमित्त). The manuscript is now in the possession of the University of Pennsylvania. Ms. Coll. 390 Item 2213 (3420 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104-6206., University of Pennsylvania, Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts).

The style indicates that the scribe knew Sanskrit. Pañcamavarṇas are not replaced by anusvāras and there are no anusvāras at ends of lines (something we see in many manuscripts).

  

The good thing about this being abroad is that the university digitized and made the manuscript available for everybody, unlike many institutes in India where manuscripts are just lying as locked knowledge. There are more than 30+ Sanskrit commentaries on the Mahābhārata and apart from one (or two or three?) which have been completely published, most remain unpublished.
