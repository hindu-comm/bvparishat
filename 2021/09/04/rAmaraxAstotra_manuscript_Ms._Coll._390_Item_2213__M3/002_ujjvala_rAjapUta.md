At least one script sufficient for writing Sanskrit is generally known to some classes of people in professions involving Sanskrit. This includes, for example, Sanskrit scholars (of course), Carnatic musicians, Vedādhyāyins and the traditional scribes.

  

Some scholars try to explicitly describe these scripts using some models. Often (very often indeed) these models are insufficient, not having considered all cases / usages / styles of the script. But nevertheless, these models nicely describe the style of writing in the modern "scholarly" works these scholars are most used to reading. This makes them believe that the models they have come up with represent the "correct style" of the script under question, forgetting the fact that any script / style which can encode the same text as their "correct style" can do, with possibility of to-and-fro transliteration without loss of information, is just as good.

  

When these scholars encounter a different style (however ancient and traditional it may be), rather than generalizing their model, they apply their narrow models to those texts and when what they understand is wrong according to Sanskrit phonology, they start falsely believing that the scribe lacked knowledge of Sanskrit, when in fact the models of these scholars have been insufficient.

  

I know of a model of the Devanagari script which is quite general. It helps me enjoy reading correctly written Sanskrit texts in the bulk of manuscripts (which constitute the majority, it seems) in which Sri Nityanand-ji thinks (because he is looking at the map while having the wrong legend in mind) that "Pañcamavarṇas are replaced by anusvāras and there are anusvāras at ends of lines". Reading these manuscripts generally doesn't make me think that the scribes didn't know Sanskrit (but there may be other evidences) or that they didn't adhere to "the correct styles".

  

Sri Nityanand-ji already knows that encompassing model at least subconsciously. To demonstrate this to himself, he can try to "correct" the texts in those "faulty" manuscripts to his own "correct style" without applying any knowledge of Sanskrit language to each sentence or word, and only using mechanical script-level transformations. I am sure he will succeed in doing so. That will prove for him that the "wrong style" is as good as his "correct style" and that the styles themselves do not differentiate people with different levels of knowledge of Sanskrit.
