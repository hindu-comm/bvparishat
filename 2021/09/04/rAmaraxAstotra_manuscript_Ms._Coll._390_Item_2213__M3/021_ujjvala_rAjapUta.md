I received a private message from a Sanskrit enthusiast pointing out some occurrencesof "स्वातंत्र्य" on Sanskrit Wikisource. While his gesture is appreciated, here are some template replies Sanskrit beginners can use-

> The word in Sanskrit is स्वातन्त्र्य, not स्वातंत्र्य.  

"Both are equivalent and only differ in orthography, like *तदपि* from *तद् अपि*. This claim reflects the way the majority of people pronounce."

> There is no अनुस्वार in तन्त्र, स्वतन्त्र, स्वातन्त्र्य, etc.  

"Yes, we know that, thank you very much."

> See the rules मोऽनुस्वारः, नश्चापदान्तस्य झलि, अनुस्वारस्य ययि > परसवर्णः, वा पदान्तस्य.  

"Don't confuse symbol with sound. Pāṇini never described the script."

> 1\) bindu is anusvāra only  

"If you mean to call the bindu as anusvāra symbol, so what? If you say bindu should only be used for anusvāra sound, you are no authority. And stop lamenting about enemies of Sanskrit and tradition distorting the modern Indian scripts - this style has been there since earliest Brāhmī inscriptions, all the way through Sanskrit manuscripts (including aṣṭādhyāyī manuscripts) to modern times."

> 2\) the word does not have anusvāra  

"Okay".

> 3\) if written with anusvāra, it is incorrect be it in manuscripts or > otherwise  

"Who says it's wrong to write with bindu?" (This is the point Sri Nityanand-ji always skips.)

Sure, but I would expect an unsuspecting Sanskrit beginner to almost think that the later statement follows directly from the earlier.

  

About Sri Nityanand-ji himself, having known "very well" (since at least 2016 I hope) that even Sanskrit scholars often use bindu for pañcamavarṇa and having indicated in 2019 that he understands this has been done in Goldman's Ramayana (if we were to use his common sense):

> "title on each of the seven books uses the anusvara incorrectly, a > basic error which beginners of Sanskrit make"  

  

pointing out rules from grammar in 2020:

![EfdT-1xUwAEgKUc.jpeg](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/8e8ebf1bc34e/EfdT-1xUwAEgKUc.jpeg?part=0.1&view=1)

(<https://twitter.com/MisraNityanand/status/1294597302863110148/photo/2>)  

does show clearly that he has been confused between sound and symbol (unless Goldman has himself confirmed to him some time in between that the bindu mark at end was indeed meant to "represent the anusvāra sound").

The font face on the cover of his books looks similar to that in the Hitopadeśa by Max Muller which has the same traditional style of using bindu, and this is what Max Muller writes in the preface (<https://www.google.co.in/books/edition/The_First_Book_of_the_Hitopade%C5%9Ba/BCYpAAAAYAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PR11>):

Yes, because you know there is a padānta inside *सय्ँयुक्त,*you can choose to pronounce it with anusvāra, the same way you can do to*किञ्चित्*or *सञ्चार*(though think how often this is actually done). About the old Sanskrit speakers from Vālmiki to Jagannātha, we don't know how they utilized this option because all that has come to us through manuscripts of whichever style, there is pañcamavarṇa always indicated at the cost of anusvāra.
