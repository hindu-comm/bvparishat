To make it clear, the aim was not to contradict any of Sri Nityanand-ji's conclusions. I discuss below why he has got the wrong impression but first let me state that this post was written for the sake of those scholars or learners who feel sad about the way Sanskrit is found written in most manuscripts and in some modern texts. I tried to show that the problem, most often, is not with the manuscript but with the wrong understanding readers have regarding the script. Even if you don't have one or two characteristics of the scholars described by me (for example you may not believe that writing in the "wrong manner" implies lack of Sanskrit knowledge), that post of mine can still help you clear other misconceptions that you hold.

  

Regarding Sri Nityanand-ji (or his post), I write down clearly the statements that I made (and these are the only ones I can find on rereading my post):

1.  **Sri Nityanand-ji thinks that "Pañcamavarṇas are replaced by
    anusvāras and there are anusvāras at ends of lines" in many
    manuscripts**. This is logically derived from his original statement
    praising the beautiful Rāmarakṣāstotra manuscript: "Pañcamavarṇas
    are not replaced by anusvāras and there are no anusvāras at ends of
    lines (something we see in many manuscripts)." I did feel the urge
    to contradict it, but wasn't sure exactly what he might mean by
    this. But I did say:  
2.  **Hethinks so because he is looking at the map while having the
    wrong legend in mind**. If Sri Nityanand-ji thinks this statement of
    mine is wrong, he may try giving an alternate reason for his
    thinking stated in (1) above. 3.  The last para was more of a prediction. I hope people will
    sympathize with me if it goes wrong by chance.

As was hoped, Sri Nityanand-ji found the description of the scholars in my post matching his characteristics closely. But, as was feared, he assumed I was trying to describe him, and wrote all this, mostly a digression from the point I intended to make. Still, my point-wise replies can be seen below:

Yes it is long because it is intended to explain a pervading phenomenon and not meant to be a little attempt to contradict one of your statements. At least I was very clear in my thoughts while writing the post. Still, if reading it you feel confused, I am sorry about that. The reason you give below for the post being poorly-argued is invalid as I show below. I haven't mixed any concepts and nowhere have I misrepresented any of your positions. Below I point out why your claims are wrong.

In this para above, one can clearly see you putting my words inside parentheses and presenting "likes of me" as a part of my statement. Is this not a misrepresentation of my position done in order to claim that I misrepresented you?

As noted already, I didn't ascribe to you anything but (1) in bold above.

Agreed.

I understood that statement of yours very well. And didn't misrepresent (or represent) your position about it. I didn't mix up anything in my mind. The only thing I said about you or your post is given in bold in points above.

As said earlier, I did not want to contradict your conclusion. I did catch this flaw in your conclusion, though, but felt it is a digression.

I have never known Sanskrit scholars using*anusvāras*for*pañcamavarṇa*sounds and at*virāma*positions. It would be nice if we can listen to a sample of what you are talking about. Or if by chance you are talking about written material, let us have a look at what you have in mind.

Agreed.

I know it's not your own style or model. I have clearly written "some scholars". One may correct it to "many scholars" if one wishes.

I don't see how can one "use" anusvāras for*pañcamavarṇa*s in a Devanagari text. Anusvāra is a sound as far as I know. And there are no sounds in a written text. Only drawings from which you have to determine the intended sounds.

Yes, of course. We all know that the difference in the possibility of*anusvāra* sound can be caused by whether the*pañcamavarṇa*occurs at *pada*boundary or within a *pada*. And for determining the *padas*, one does need knowledge of Sanskrit.

Yes, I do believe this test will help differentiate people with various levels of knowledge of Sanskrit. No issues with this.

  

Let me emphasize again that regarding Sri Nityanand-ji or his email, in my first post I made only the statements given in bold in points above. And I still stand by (1) and (2).
