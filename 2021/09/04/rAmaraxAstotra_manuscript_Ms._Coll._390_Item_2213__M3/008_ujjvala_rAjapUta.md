Sorry, missed another manifestation here of the misconception you have been holding to. All manuscripts I have seen "retain"*pañcamavarṇa*s (that is to say,*pañcamavarṇa*s can be determined from looking at them, without any knowledge of Sanskrit). The encoding in those manuscripts is completely faithful and your "purism" superficial.
