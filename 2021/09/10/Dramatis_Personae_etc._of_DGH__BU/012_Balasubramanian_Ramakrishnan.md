Prof. Kannan

  

It's also interesting who's there. I think a number of people are there for virtue signaling with no clue of the actual situation or politics, or even a real interest in India. Quick exampleChi-ming Yang, University of Pennsylvania and her web-site[Department of English (upenn.edu)](https://www.english.upenn.edu/people/chi-ming-yang)

  

It looks like she is Chinese-American, undergraduate here in the US, so likely born here as well. Interesting she has a full Chinese name and talks about perceptions of China in the West in her courses, but no talks or papers on the literal gulags in modern China for Muslims, but all too eager to sign on to causes against an actual, vibrant multi-cultural society.
