I peeped in the morning.

There was no scholarship, some agenda of bashing India with a cover.  

Looked like a few low-level individuals hired by the British to shout against swaraj.

Anand Patwardhan was an exception, but his facts were incorrect.

It is shocking that they promoted it as an academic conference.
