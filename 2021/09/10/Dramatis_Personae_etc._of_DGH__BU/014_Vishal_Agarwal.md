Actually the list of 900 really shows how pathetic their support levels are. Practically all the signatories are small fries and hardly any prominent scholar of Indian history or Dharmic traditions has signed this Hinduphobic petition. Even in the list below, Pollock, Thapar, TMK, UC, NS, VD, AR, KR, NM, AR are well known Leftists or Marxists or Communists or Maoists.

  

On his facebook page, Rambachan lamented that prominent Hindu orgs and temples in North America have collectively opposed this so called conference and have declared that Hinduism is Hindutva. Just in one of the petition lists opposing this conference, I saw 150 prominent Mandirs in US and Canada oppose it, including our own local temple, which has perhaps for the first time in its 44 year history every signed such a petition. All the 4 old Mandirs of Minnesota signed the petition although their printed version shows only 1 name (our local Mandir) which means that they decided to truncate their list.
