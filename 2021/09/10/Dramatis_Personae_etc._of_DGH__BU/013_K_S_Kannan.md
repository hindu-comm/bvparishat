Dear Ramakrishnan,  

  

There are many (Hindus esp.) who have been brainwashed into these anti-Hindu ideologies,

or just bullied into; as well as those - the majority perhaps - that feel unsafe not to go with  

the current trends and fashions of the academia. Survival instinct and security concerns

goad many into just playing safe.

  

Unlike most Muslims and Christians in science/engg./med. etc.,

too few Hindus who have made a name in such fields have

either the interest or ability to boldly/plainly identify themselves as Hindus.

  

Rampant ignorance of Hinduism on the one hand,

coupled with total lack of mutual support structure socially,

plus battering Hinduism in the mainstream academia and media

\- have all combined to culminate in this predicament and crisis.
