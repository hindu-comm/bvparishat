Namaste,

  

Donald Knuth, a great computer scientist, in the preface of each of his books and on his website, offers a reward of $2.56 (USD) to the first person to find each error in his published books, whether it be technical, typographical, or historical. Knuth explains that $2.56, or 256 cents, corresponds to one hexadecimal dollar! And people who found some errors have promptly got the cheques, but most of them don't encash them, but treasure the cheque from him as a greater reward!  

  

In my first research publication, I intended to thank the referee for 'pointing out' certain mistakes in an earlier draft of the paper. It had become 'printing out' certain. . .!

  

Regards. . . . . . Yoga
