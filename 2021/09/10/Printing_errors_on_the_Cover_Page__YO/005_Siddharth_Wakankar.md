My neighbour,Miss Walavalkar,an [M.A.in](http://M.A.in) German, found out three printing mistakes in the printed German book and as announced,she was given a reward by the German Publishing House for meticulously going through the books and bringing to their notice the printing mistakes.

  

On this background, it is very heartening to note that we hardly find any printing mistakes in the Publications of the old Nirnay Sagar Press,Mumbai.
