A detailed and involved discussion is underway on रामरक्षास्तोत्र manuscript, etc...

I do not intend to go off on a tangent on that thread... and hence this separate discussion.

  

Theरामरक्षास्तोत्रमन्त्र's ऋषिis given asबुधकौशिक.

I read that, बुधकौशिक is identified as वाल्मीकि the author of रामायणम्‌.

Is that identification well established and is an accepted fact?  

  

If yes, then

Since the firstपद्य : "ध्यायेदाजानुबाहुम्‌..." seems to be inस्रग्धरावृत्त,

that places स्रग्धरा in an antiquity on par with that of श्लोक meter and वाल्मीकि.

Is such an antiquity of स्रग्धरावृत्त also a well established and an accepted fact?

  

Regards

Prabhu
