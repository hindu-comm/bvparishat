Dear Scholars,

  

On not finding a compilation ofश्रीकृष्णनीतिः, I have provided @sanskrit_hitaay on Twitter a collection of these नीति shlokas from the Mahabharata. The handle will translate these verses and tweet one verse per day:

Given the number of verses, I expect this series to continue for a year. If it generates interest, we will look into compiling them and publishing in a book form.

  

Best,

Kushagra
