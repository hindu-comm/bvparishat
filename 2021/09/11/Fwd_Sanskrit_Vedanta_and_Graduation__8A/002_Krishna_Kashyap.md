Sorry I had missed this email.

Usually, the course is for 11 weeks. 10 lectures total. 1 lecture per week. 2 hours roughly including Q&A per lecture.  

roughly 20 hours of lectures. I have finished 9 out of 10 lectures now.  

  

These are the fundamental issues that will be addressed in this course.



2) The lecture content:

1.  14 Vidya Sthanas. What are they? How did the Rsis realize the Vedas? 2.  Overview of the three systems: Advaita, Dvaita and Visistadvaita 3.  Deep dive on Advaita 4.  Deep dive on Dvaita 5.  Deep dive on Visistadvaita 6.  How to understand the Gita as per the three systems. What are the
    main common take-home points regarding the message of the Gita as
    per all these three Acharyas? Are there any? 7.  The message of the Gita based on the commonly accepted view of Gita
    (while mentioning the different approaches of other acharyas)
    (chapters 1 to 6) 8.  continued (chapters 7 to 12) 9.  continued (chapters 13 to 18) 10. Samanvaya or Reconciliation between the three schools

Home workload is light: In order of priority, the focus should be given to; 1) attendance, 2) Understanding concepts by attempting quizzes in each class and 3) writea summary paper at the end around 1000 words: "What are these three systems and is there a reconciliation possible between these three Schools?." (writing such a paper helps students to think about the subject in detail)

  

Incidentally, I will be continuing to teach this course during the next quarter starting in a few weeks.
