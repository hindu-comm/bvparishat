Dear Scholars,

  

I am sharing a Sanskrit composition titled "Narmadāsragviṇī" on the sacred geography of the Narmada River in Central India (pdf attached). I had shared a portion of this composition a year ago but I am now sharing the full composition with an English translation attached.

  

The composition is an attempt to enrich the tradition of nature and devotional poetry in Sanskrit by drawing inspiration from local cultures and traditions - one of thefacets of Sanskrit as a Loka Bhāṣā. The song links the significance of Narmada in popular consciousness of the region to its description in the Puranas (Reva Khanda of the Skanda and Vayu Puranas). It emphasizes the intimate relationship between the “natural” and the “sacred" in Hinduism.

  

I have set this song to a tune based on Raga Bairagi Bhairavain Hindustani Music. Incidentally, the equivalent Raga in Karnataka Sangeeta is Revati, which is sometimes used as a name for Narmada (besides Reva).  

  

I previously presented this song at the 5th Annual Folk and Oral Literature Festival organized by the South Asian Poets of New England. I will also present it at theNew England Folk Literature and Oral Poetry Festival on September 25.

  

Best,

Kushagra
