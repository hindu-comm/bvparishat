Dear Prof. Nagaraj,

Sorry to respond again, but I have the impression that you know the qualifications of Ms.Rupa Bhatyand Mr. Nilesh Oak. Are you going to address Mr. Oak as Prof. Oak even when I have brought to the attention of this forum that INADS is not an accredited institute/university, does not offer a degree and hence has no authority to appoint anyone as Adjunct Professor?

  

Best regards,

Raja
