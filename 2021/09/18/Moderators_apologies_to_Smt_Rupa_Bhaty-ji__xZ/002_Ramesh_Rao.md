Really, Nagaraj ji?

  

"A pissing contest" is basically a term that is very commonly used in ordinary commentary/communication -- at least here in the US -- to characterize something small boys/adolescents would participate in to claim who is better, more powerful.

  

There is nothing sexist or "dirty" in the term except maybe to those who are hearing/reading it for the first time!

  

One can understand that people on this list come from a variety of backgrounds -- from the very traditional to the very Western/anglicized/modern -- from those who have not had experience in the use of modern English (and it is not just American/Western, but also Indian) to those who are very familiar with it: theshock value about the use of such English idioms depends on a person's familiarity with the language.

  

When we have a range of people from a variety of backgrounds on the list there are sure to be differences, sometimes very large differences in our perception of language use and the appropriateness of the language used.

  

That said, the tenor of the exchange between people who staunchly defend older dates of the Ramayana/Mahabharata and those who challenge those dates is always fraught because it seems that people refuse to follow the basic rules of argument and scholarly debate: providing evidence for the claims they make. A refusal to engage with or respond to those who raise questions about the nature and quality of the evidence presented leads to unnecessary standoffs and to blaming and shaming. And when spats and arguments are carried over from social media sites about these matters then what we get here are truncated pieces of the back and forth elsewhere, which the person who was referring to those issues called a "pissing contest" -- which is indeed an apt term -- for those who, again, are familiar with modern idioms/usage.

  

As long as people refuse to engage in scholarly debate here, and professionally deal with criticism of their theses, then what we will see, as we have seen here a few times already, is a breakdown in communication.

  

It is imperative that in the pursuit of knowledge we keep our egos aside as much as possible and simply deal with the content of the disagreements, because the style of communication will be different given the nature of the people gathered here.

  

Unless, of course, we lay down very clear rules of engagement about the kind of language we can use -- in English, Kannada, Sanskrit, Hindi, et al -- which is both a difficult proposition if not an impossibletask, and which is difficult to enforce.

  

I keep wondering why we Indians are such a prickly and quarrelsome lot when we say from the other side of our mouths that we are a dharmic lot.

  

We live in an interesting world!

  

With regards,

  

Ramesh Rao
