I received the following message from a former member of BVP that made me feel painfully guilty. I offer my sincere apologies as the moderator of the group to Dr Rupa Bhaty-ji.

  

Namaste Sri Nagaraj-ji  

  

I have seen some recent posts on BVP. I am writing to express my deep pain and disappointment with the fact that highly unparliamentary words like "pissing contest" are being used on BVP, that too in a discussion thread where a woman scholar is one of the participants. When I search on google for the meaning of these words, I see that it is classified as "vulgar slang".  

  

Very sorry to hear such words. In my opinion, respect for women is non-negotiable in Indian culture. Even though I am not party to that discussion, as a former member of BVP, I would like to convey my sincere apologies to Sri Rupa Bhaty ji.  

  

Please understand that I am not holding the moderators of BVP responsible for this. I am only writing this to express my pain.  

  

Sincerely Yours  

XXXXX
