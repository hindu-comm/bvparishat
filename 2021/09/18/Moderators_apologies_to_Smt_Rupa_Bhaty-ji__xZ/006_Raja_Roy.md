Dear Prof. Nagaraj,

  

Sorry to nitpick, but you addressed Ms. Bhaty as Dr. Rupa Bhaty. Is she a medical doctor or has she earned a Ph.D.? I am not aware of it, so asking out of curiosity, especially as she has been deliberately addressing me as "Mister". I have earned Ph.D. from The OhioState University in Materials Science and engineering.

  

Best regards,

Raja
