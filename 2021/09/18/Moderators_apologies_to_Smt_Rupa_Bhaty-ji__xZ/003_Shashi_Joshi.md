Namaste Paturiji and all the concerned members,

  

**'You' in this mail is used as a generic you, and not anyone in particular.  
**

  

**I once again repeat**-*people read and (mis)understand based on their own level and mood, and may miss the original intent.*Both parties are at fault for this.  

  

Even though the topic is closed, both literally and in my mind as well, since the post was directed towards me, I think I should respond.I will do so, trying to keep it to a minimum.

  

I apologise to the elders worthy of respect who are also members inthis group, for anything theymight find offensive.

And those who 'know it all', may simply skip this mail,since I can not add anything to their vast knowledge base.

  

I don'tintend toendorse disrespectful language, I have not been disrespectfulto anyone, critical maybe. I don't intend to respond on this topic further.

  

I may not have a PhD in Sanskrit, but that is not a qualification for being cultured or sensitive.

  

  
It is easy to jump on the bashing-wagon, but I hope some people see it the way it was meant. Don't just go for the word, go for its intent and meaning and the context. *And please read fully before commenting.*  
  
**1.** I sent private mail to her rightafter her first objection, and clarified the misunderstanding. So dharmAdhyakSha-s may now breathe.  
  
**2. I did not refer to her in my reply.**  
When you respond to a thread, you have to respond to some post within the thread. I responded to the last one, which happened to be hers. If someone cares to see my post, I had removed her message, a clear indication that I am not responding to her per se, but to the thread. This may be a new thing to understand for those who grew up primarily in the paper world.  
  
**3. Unparliamentary language.**

  
*"highly unparliamentary words like "pissing contest" are being used on BVP, that too in a discussion thread where a woman scholar is one of the participants"*  
  

First of all, the differentiation of man and woman shows that we somehow consider them less. Ladies like Sita and Draupadi have not been offended by language,if used suitable to the context.

  
This is a natural act, even performed publicly in many parts.  
Highly unparliamentary is subjective.  
My usage was based on context.

The thread was not a sacred thread on spirituality or such nature.  
  
This was nothing compared to the level of communication that has happened in the group in some threads. No need to keep digging those out, those who know, know.  
  
No one is under-age here, and the phrase 'pissing contest' is vulgar slang.I said so 'in modern lingo'.  
  
**Vulgar is not such a bad word! It is not abusive, it is just not cultured enough.**  
  
**Here is the definition of vulgar:**

"not in the style preferred by the upper classes of society" - the group hasbeen losing some of its*upper-classiness* in thepast. I wanted to point out the undignified (subjective) way the thread(s) evolve lately on BVP.

  
  
**4. Usage in Sanskrit literature.**  
We seem to have become such a soft, removed-from-reality society, that we don't realize that based on context, Sanskrit literature has such usage. I quote only a few.  
One doesn't have to be super sensitive or hypocritical.

There is an apparently respectable book with an unparliamentary commentary name.
