You definitely have a right to your impression, Dr Roy. I addressed/mentioned Smt Rupa-ji multiple timeswithout a Dr on this forum. Sorry if my one time usage of Dr in front of her name offended you.

  

Fact of the matter Dr Roy, is that I never knew Smt Rupa-ji earlier to her applying for our conference. Even now, I do not have any acquaintance with her beyond her posts here.

  

Regarding Sri Nilesh Oak, I can say that I have a greater acquaintance, met him during his talks at CVV, as I was parallelly giving talks in the same place and so on. But never paid attention to his degrees or positions.

  

As a linguist I did discvusshis family name with him.
