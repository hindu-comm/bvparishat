By openly publishing the honest criticism that he has received from a venerable member, and by apologizing unreservedly to the lady member, Dr Nagaraj Paturi has shown that ego-less adherence to truth in one's words and deeds, regardless of the cost/implications, is the hallmark of the true bhAratIya vidwAn.

  

I have followed this august forum for many years. I have noticed the yeoman service that Dr Nagaraj Paturi is rendering to the cause of Indic knowledge and Bharatiya heritage by, among other things, selflessly moderating this list. I convey my appreciation of his sincerity and honesty.
