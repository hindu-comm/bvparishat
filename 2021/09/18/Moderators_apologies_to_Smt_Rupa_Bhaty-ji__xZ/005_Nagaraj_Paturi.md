Sri Shashi Kiran-ji,

  

Your expression was used in a counterproductive way is what is getting established by what is happening as a consequence to it.

  

You wanted to point out the wrong in the heated nature of the debates and the bitternessin them.

  

But the expression you used to communicate that , as you can see is leading to what you wanted not to happen.

  

Sri Ramesh Rao ji,

  

Communicators need to keep the receiver's sensitivities and sensibilities in mind while communicating.

  

Some expressions could be universally accepted as bad, some universally as good. Some lie in the grey area because of the cultural contexts varying from place to place.

  

Wise communicators should avoid these grey area usages because of the sensitivities that may come into play without our knowledge.
