Deutsche Welle (DW) published an article (link at the bottom) two days ago on Somidh Saha, an Indian-born forester who now lives in Germany. This was a name I had never come across earlier. On LinkedIn, we see only two people with the first name ‘Somidh’. Both have a Bengali last name, just like Somidh Saha (who was born in Assam).  

  

The DW article says, “Somidh Saha’s name is well chosen: In Sanskrit, Somidh means wood of sacred tree species.” It is likely Somidh Saha himself told this to the news reporter. Though not complete, this is almost correct. It is good to see a German news site being almost correct about a Sanskrit name; Indian news sites would have published some made-up meaning copy-pasted from a random name website.

  

The Sanskrit word that the DW article alludes to is actually ‘samidh’ (समिध्, সমিধ্), which means “wood, fuel, especially fuel or sacrificial sticks for the sacred fire” (Apte). This would be pronounced ‘Somidh’ in Bangla, and hence the name. However, I do not think this is the right name for two reasons (1) ‘samidh’ is a feminine word in Sanskrit (2) it refers to wood used for yajña fire, not a person or deity.

  

While Somidh Saha may himself not know it, the correct name is in fact ‘samidha’ (समिध, সমিধ), which is a masculine word different from the feminine word ‘samidh’ (समिध्, সমিধ্). Literally meaning “he who is well-kindled” (समिध्यत इति समिधः), it means both “wood, fuel” and also “Agni” as per the Apte and Vācaspatya dictionaries (and some other dictionaries as well). There is a reference to well-kindled or well-lit fire in the Bhagavad-Gītā (4.37)—

  

यथैधांसि समिद्धोऽग्निर्भस्मसात्कुरुतेऽर्जुन।

ज्ञानाग्निः सर्वकर्माणि भस्मसात्कुरुते तथा॥

yathaidhāṃsi samiddho’gnirbhasmasātkurute’rjuna

jñānāgniḥ sarvakarmāṇi bhasmasātkurute tathā

  

My translation: “As a well-lit fire reduces fuel to ashes, similarly the fire of ‘jñānā’ (knowledge) reduces all karmas (actions) to ashes.”

  

In the Viṣṇu-sahasranāma from the Skanda-Purāṇa, we see ‘samidhaḥ’, the nominative singular form of the masculine word ‘samidha’, as one of the names of Viṣṇu: “haviragniścarusthālī samidhaścānilo yamaḥ” (हविरग्निश्चरुस्थाली समिधश्चानिलो यमः). So ‘samidha’ is also a name of Viṣṇu. Note that ‘samidhaḥ’ can also be the nominative plural form of the feminine ‘samidh’ but the word in this verse is most likely ‘samidha’.

  

To summarize, the masculine name ‘Somidh’ (in Bengal) or ‘Samidh’ (outside Bengal) is the Sanskrit word ‘samidha’ (समिध, সমিধ). As a personal name, it means “well-lit” or “blazing” and refers to Agni. It is also a name of Viṣṇu.
