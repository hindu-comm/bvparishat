Respected members,

  

May I request you to let me have your thoughts, if you get the time, on this one doubt of mine -

  

Amongst the Sun, the (Siva) Linga, and the (Devi/Shakti/Mother-Goddess) Yoni, which do you think has preceded the other (as deities or icons) in India and the world, historically speaking?

  

Which is the earliest in your estimation?

  

If one takes nature(-worship) as the principal line of historical development, then it would seem that the Sun comes first. If one takes the human body as the principal line of historical development, then it would seem that it is a toss-up between the Linga and the Yoni.

  

with thanks
