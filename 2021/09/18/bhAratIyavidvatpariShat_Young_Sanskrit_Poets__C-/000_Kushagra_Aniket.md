Dear Scholars,

  

This list of young (under 30) Sanskrit poets appeared in the September issue of रसना magazine.

  

I am also listed. However, the point is that there are many young people (listed and not listed) who continue to write in Sanskrit every day. We have to encourage them through different ways.

  

But the first step is to start reading their works. Some poets mentioned in the list have already published their works. Others are in the process of publishing.
