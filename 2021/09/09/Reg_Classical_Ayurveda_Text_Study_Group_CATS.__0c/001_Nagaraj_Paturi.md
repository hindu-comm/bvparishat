I am trying to check with the organizers of the conference the facts of the matter vis-a-vis their representation in this preface.

  

In any case, the following conclusion by Prof. Iyengar is being arrived at by many of the insider observers of these works:

  

  

"However, thisindicates to me that the post-colonialistic obsession of text-only-Indology of westerners about IKS is a reality. Topics of IKS (other than sAhitya-alamkAra) that are not amenable for easy objective analysis suffer at the hands of Kevala-Sanskrit scholars (within India or abroad) who lack direct experiential exposure to the discipline. "
