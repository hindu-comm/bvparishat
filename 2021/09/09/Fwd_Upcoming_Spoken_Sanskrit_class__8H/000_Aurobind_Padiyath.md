Welcome to All,  
  
**Our next batch of Spoken Sanskrit for those not knowing a modern Indian language will be beginning soon!** You have been added to the google groups for this class so that you will receive the class announcements each week.  
  
You have also received a **notification in your email inbox** from the google groups letting you know that you have been added. **Please make sure you received that notification**-- it is very important. If you do not see it in your inbox, please check your spam and trash folders and find it there. Then fix your incoming email filter so that you will receive mails from the google group going forward. Otherwise you will not receive the ongoing information from the group as to the timing of the classes, the date when it begins, how to join, etc.  
  
**If you have any further questions**, **please contact Aurobind ji who is cc'd here.** You'll find his email id just above, and I am enlisting it here for you as well: **Aurobind Mahodaya \<[padiy...@gmail.com]()\>.**  
  
Welcome again to Spoken Sanskrit!  
  
All the Best,  
Swarup
