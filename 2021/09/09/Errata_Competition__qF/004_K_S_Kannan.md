I meant it only in the sense that the "additions", which can be welcome,  

have added to the bulk - than mere corrections. Whence it becomes a bit

difficult to sift them, and compare only the Errrata portions.

  

The author introduced too many new notations,

and perhaps it all got too involved even for himself.
