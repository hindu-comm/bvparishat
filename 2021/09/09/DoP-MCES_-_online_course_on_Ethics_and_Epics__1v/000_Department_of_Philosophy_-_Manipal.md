Dear all,

  

Namaste.  

  

The Department of Philosophy (DoP) and Manipal Centre for European Studies (MCES) -Jean Monnet Centre for Excellence, MAHE, Manipal jointly offer a certificate course on 'Ethics and Epics: Indian and European Discourses' from 13 Sep 2021.

  

This course, open for all,discusses the social scenario that triggers the debates on understanding and practice of ethics, values and traditions. The course attempts to revisit the classical epic literature, narratives and characters to identify and render interesting views on questions of morality. These epics account on various situations of human life dwelling upon ethical dilemmas. The studies on such reveal interesting views on ethical theories and help in understanding the ethical frameworks and the changes brought in them through the passage of time. You may please refer to the attached poster.
