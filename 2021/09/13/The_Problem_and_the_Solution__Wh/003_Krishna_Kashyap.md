Namaste to everyone,

  

I think Sri Aravinda Ji has summarized the problem very well. Yes, this problem has to be attacked in many ways. I remember a long time back when Prof K.S Kannan told me that in the Indian IIT Madras, there was a situation when students were asked to write about their own religion and philosophy. Among the different international students attending IIT Madras, those who were of Indian origin failed this test miserably, whereas the foreign students did very well in explaining their own Semitic or Buddhist religions. That was when IIT Madras started a department to educate students in Hinduism / Vaidika Religions. I am not sure how well this is being implemented. However, I just remembered this episode.

  

How do we do this at an international level? One solution is as suggested by Sri Aravinda Ji to set up conferences where students get educated. That is a nice approach. We need an army of good presenters with deep knowledge. Another way is to establish a number of teaching institutions that offer education courses in this area (comparative religion, Vedanta, etc.). For example institutions such as " The Hindu University of America,"<https://www.hua.edu/> are trying to do something in this area. However, these universities are not there yet to solve the problem which is a gigantic task. One way may be to connect such institutions in India and the international universities where courses can be offered in collaboration with established universities. However, due to the process of accreditation, pushback from opponents, and other political hurdles, that is taking much longer for anyone to effectively address this problem.

  

Definitely, it has to start at home first in the family and then in communities. Community outreach activities where small communities work together using social media/zoom/google meet, Facebook, etc. are doing some work. However, they are not able to get to the students who are not exposed to in-depth comparative religion/philosophy to get some real conviction. Someone has to do this metamorphosis in education, where, aspre-requisites for professional education, a student has to take some courses in Vedanta / comparative religion, etc.
