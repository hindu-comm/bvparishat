The utterances of Prof Bharat Gupt, Dr. Aravinda Rao, and Sri Krishna Kashyap

are all sane and sagely voices at a moment when the task before us is as vast as is urgent.

  

A small clarification: I have spoken often about how among the well-educated in a country like US

(or elsewhere, equally,) - e.g. doctors/engineers/university professors etc. - whereas Muslims and Christians

are fairly knowledgeable about their own religion/heritage, it is almost always that the Hindu counterparts

have fared the worst : they prefer to quietly leave the place when such discussions arise, and/or highly

apologetic about their country/traditions. I do not recollect any specific episode wrt any IIT as described above though.

  

The archetype provided by Nehru who was ashamed to call himself a Hindu, has been duly "copied" by many.

In our own schools, we will have seen Muslims nd Christian teachers displaying their religious insignia

(the cross/the skull-cap etc.) unabashedly, while some of our own Hindu teachers too would discourage  

if not disrespect any Hindu religious symbols like the tilaka and the puṇḍra-s : whereby a sense of shame/guilt

was easy to detect.  

  

The situation must change. The large-scale ignorance is not *merely* wrt Vedanta, nor would a sound

knowledge about Vedanta *alone* going to help a great deal. An integral view about our heritage in its  

myriad aspects which are all crying for attention, must be paid attention to. (What is also required is  

knowledgeable and talented scholars who can impart a knowledge of Vedanta as can kindle appreciation

among the youth (as against the many who have made it look rather dry, or even distorted/diluted the ideas)).
