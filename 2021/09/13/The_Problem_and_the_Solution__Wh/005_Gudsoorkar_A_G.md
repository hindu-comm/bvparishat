Dear Aravinda Rao,

I read your note with deep interest. The impact on the minds of Hindu students in graduate schools is indeed very serious.

  

I am simply puzzled to think of any solution for this problem. Some ways suggested by Dr Kannan and other scholars should work.

  

Regards to all the thinkers for this problem.

-Ashok G.
