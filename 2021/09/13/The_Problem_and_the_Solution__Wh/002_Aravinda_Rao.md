Another important factor is the impact on the Hindu kids in the graduate schools. They stand demoralized, dispirited, and disoriented from the religion. That seems to be one of the main aims of these academics. Shaming the people so that they run away from the tradition. And that is the next generation of Hindus in America.

  

Unfortunately, our students and scholars seem to be more concerned with countering these academics, writing to the universities etc. While all this is most important, it is also important to recall whatVivekananda did. He merely taught Vedanta and forcefully compared it with the Abrahamic religions. That is being done by a small, almost invisible section of people is some secluded ashrams. They are perhaps not known to the field level persons breaking their brains to fightour Trutsches. There can be academic seminars on issues such as Vedanta, Yoga, Indian classics and art forms.

  

For instance, Swami Sarvapriyananda gave talks in IITK in India on subjects like 'The Definition of God', 'Nature of Consciousness' and many such topics whichare totally academic and non-controversial. In facttheconcerned faculty can also be invited for such meets. Such programs would attract all students, not merely Hindus but sceptics, critics and others. This would equip the Hindu students with the right knowledge to stand committed against all mischievouselements. Knowledge leads to commitment and knowledge leads to action. Without such knowledge, the students stand confused, and may even think that those who are fighting are mere rabble rousers.

The present lament is about the lack of participation by all the Hindu students. More students would be interested in knowing the fundamentals of Hindu doctrine and philosophy.
