We should make a REPRESENTATION to

Foreign Affairs Minister

&

Minister for Culture

to ask the American President

for

ENSURING SAFE & NON DISCRIMINATORY CAMPUSES

FOR HINDU STUDENTS.

  

This DGH has succeeded in:

  

1\. Consolidating and Validating

Hindu hating academics at American universities . Hindu haters are 4 kinds: Whites Muslims Christians and Marxists.

  

2\. In crystallising or stereotyping Hindus as caste ridden xenophobes particularly hostile to Muslims hence rightly defined as Savarkarites.

  

3\. To ask for a new specific Law that punishes Hindus in USA in case they are found

practicing caste discrimination.

  

4\. To push for the same law in India.

  

Let's not kid our self that protest s made so far have been sufficient .

  

Hindus in USA & Canada should do the same.

  

All this is being done by DGH to make anti Hindu laws and divert attention from the challenge of facing ISLAMIC TERRORISM now hovering once again on USA.
