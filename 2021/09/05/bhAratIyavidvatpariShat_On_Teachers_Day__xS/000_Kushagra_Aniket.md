My experience with teachers in institutional settings (such as school or university) has been different.

  

I previously circulated a long composition "श्रीगुरुदेवस्तवराजः" on our traditional Teachers' Day (Guru Purnima). But today, on more mundane matters:

  

दुर्लभाः शिक्षका लोके ये तु शिष्यहितैषिणः।  
द्वित्रा हिच्छात्रकाले मे लब्धास्तेभ्यो नमो नमः॥१  
  
“Teachers who care for the well being of their students are rare in this world. I have found only two or three such teachers in my student life. I salute them.”  

  

न ताड्यो शिक्षकैः कश्चिन्मूढोऽपि वटुको भृशम्।  
एकोऽपि बालिशः शिष्यस् ताडनैर्न गुणी कृतः॥२  
  
“Even a foolish student should never be chastised by his teachers. Not a single dull student has been made qualified through corporal punishment.”  
  
न जातु पतने भक्तिः शिष्यैः शिक्षकपादयोः।  
नानर्थं शिक्षकैरुक्तं तद्भक्तः सहते क्वचित्॥३  
  
“There is no devotion in falling at the feet of one’s teacher. A truly devoted student cannot let an incorrect statement by the teacher go unchallenged.”  

  

  

Best,

Kushagra
