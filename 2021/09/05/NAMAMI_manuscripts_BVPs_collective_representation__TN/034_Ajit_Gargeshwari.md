Thanks Chetan, I agree to differ with you. Let us part with the differenceon this thread on this issue. Your views are well respected and so should my views be considered that's all. This forum does not Discuss What Modiji does or does notdo. What his views are and what's not. Don't try to make any remarks against anyone, that's the best. I need not take lessons as I said before lessons from the large-scale violations done by DLI or by' others' which put a grinding halt to a well conceived program. One can debate on DLI indexing or small low quality scans that differentand discussed matter
