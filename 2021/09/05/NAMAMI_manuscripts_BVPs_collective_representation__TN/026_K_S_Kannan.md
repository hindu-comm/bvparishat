Mechanisms to fully explore and utilise the new gates inaugurated  

should be developed soon enough and on a scale large enough.

  

The government should work in collaboration with private bodies

who take up the massive task of training - for transcription/editing/translating/annotating

and publishing the mss.

  

This demands, on the one hand, requisite training to a vast army of scholars from diverse fields,

and governmental patronage/encouragement of new employment opportunities and avenues.

  

The government may also insist, where feasible,  

on soft publication of all mss. material so provided.

  

A new chapter, verily, in the history of opening up our vast heritage

to the public gaze, and to the scholarly world.
