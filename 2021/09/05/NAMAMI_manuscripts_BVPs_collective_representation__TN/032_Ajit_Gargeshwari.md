Can Chetan Pandey show all Greek and Latin Manuscripts on line. I am for Knowledge preservation through digitization and its my only mission in life. To make universal knowledge free for all. But I believe in not violating any one rights in the process and believe in all laws and agreements one does . I have been into digitization at my own small scale full time from 7 years and need not be given lectures on anti dissemination etc thank you

Please donot pull up Modiji in the wrong context I never have heard him say or mention violate Cultural rights if a person doesn't want public share respect it or Sri modiji never say violate any laws or agreements. This is all I have to say and look forward to NAMAMI Manuscripts going on line with perpetual access for all readers and researchers.
