Digitizing Manuscripts as a preservation strategy is different from making the assets in the form manuscripts which are held by various custodians in public and private domain to be made available for a free downlead. Why will any one agree and why should any one agree to such a preposition and one should not agree to such a preposition either. It will serve very limited purpose and who will bear the cost.
