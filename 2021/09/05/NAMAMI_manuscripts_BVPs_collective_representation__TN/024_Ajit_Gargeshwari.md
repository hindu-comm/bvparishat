[Digital Manuscripts Library \| National Mission for Manuscripts (namami.gov.in)](https://www.namami.gov.in/digital-manuscripts-library)  

  

NMM in collaboration with NIC has developed a user-friendly web application for entering meta-data online and accessing the Manuscripts details through a dedicated search engine. The Meta data will be uploaded in the cloud server along with the digital images to be interlinked for providing easy access to digital Manuscripts for a wide public to be used for research and study of various subjects. NMM has developed software taking into account the diversity of scripts, material on which they are written and subjects to which they refer. Such software would enable efficient management of data about custodial institutions, descriptive catalogues, subject directories, preservation status of manuscripts and for accessing the digital images through the search engine and incorporating the same in the digital library. It is being planned to set up a state of the art Digital Manuscript Library at New Delhi with the capacity for 10 users initially (to be expanded upto 100 users) to facilitate access to this knowledge base. Users are expected to access data from a Data Centre through desktop PCs. New data is expected to be added to the storage servers on a daily basis. It is also required that the Data Centre adhere to international standards of data storage, redundancy, uptime, and availability.

Trusted Digital Repository (TDR)  
A Trusted Digital Repository (TDR) for manuscripts will establish at NMM for long term preservation of Digital manuscripts. Around 4 lakhs manuscripts initiallyare to be made accessible through TDR. Scholars and experts from different fields of manuscripts will be required to be engaged to read, study and research the complete manuscripts in detail. A deep infrastructure supported by developing latest software, capable of supporting a distributive system of digital archives is required to be setup at NMM. A trusted organization capable of certifying the accuracy of digital collection of manuscripts is also to be selected for this purpose.
