Dear Dr. Ajit Gargeshwari

  

\>\>Is the above sentence a part of National Manuscript Mission

Ans--> ABSOLUTELY Pls read<https://www.namami.gov.in/national-mission-manuscripts> --mentions The Mission has the mandate of identifying, documenting, conserving and ***making accessible*** the manuscript heritage of India.

  

\>\> Why should all manuscripts be made available to all

Ans--> For study ofcourse. Isn't that what BVP is all about?  
  

\>\>Why should BVP make representation to The Mission?

Ans--> Why NOT? Doesn't BVP stand for exploring knowledge in shastras? How does mss being digitally or hermetically locked in sealed chambers help this cause?

  

\>\>Digitizing Manuscripts as a preservation strategy is different from making the assets in the form manuscripts which are held by various custodians in public and private domain to be made available for a free downlead.

Ans--> This contradicts NAMAMI mission statement.

  

\>\>Why will any one agree and why should any one agree to such a preposition and one should not agree to such a preposition either. It will serve very limited purpose and who will bear the cost.

Ans--> I am confused here. Do you work for NAMAMI that you make all these representations on behalf of NAMAMI or are these representations made from some other POV? Please help me understand.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
