Jai SitaRam,  
  

Sincere namaskaram to Shrivathsa anna for highlighting this issue.

  

It is a matter of great concern to Hindu people if their manuscripts have been taken under the name of digitization and now neither original manuscript nor digitized version is available.

  

A friend went through NAMAMI site and collected following information. Link for relevant document is given.

<https://www.namami.gov.in/performance-summary>  

1\. Total 27-Lakh - 42 lakh manuscripts have been taken purportedly for digitization.

2\. Only 3 Lakh manuscripts have been digitized so far.

3\. Out of 3 Lakh digitized , it seems only 30 have been published.

  

This is absolute injustice to Hindu people. This is a matter of Hindu history and Hindu treasure that has been 'taken for digitization' and never returned never digitized.

This is a treasure that our ancestors had guarded over millennia from invaders. Many times sacrificing their lives for it. In continuation of their ancestors,

Hindu Vidvaans will continue their selfless works to preserve these manuscripts with \\ without support from NAMAMI or such organizations.

  

If we are going push arguments that one who digitizes gets have final say about publication, then we need to dial Xerox or Canon for every publication :-).  

  

It will really help if vidvaans of BVP make a petition to know the status of what has been going on for 2 decades and see the results of digitization or return of manuscripts.

From my end: small fish like me will lend my support to any such effort.

  

Ram Ram,  

Swapnil
