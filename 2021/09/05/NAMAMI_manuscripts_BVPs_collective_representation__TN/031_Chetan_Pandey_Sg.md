I am apalled there are Sanskrit knowing ppl in this group who are making anti-dissemination statements and coining imaginary phrases

like

Cultural sentimental and revenuerights of the custodians

  

thats like saying public education is not a right of the ppl - it - by the above logic - eclipses the right of private individuals to make money and state has no business to interfere in a lucrative private education industry by giving stuff out for free.

  

as USA and all modern countries are doing just that .. making sure everyone studies for 12 years on the exchequers money. and now Sktists will study that for free also with no money spent - power of Technology

  

are all greek/latin manuscripts online...

  

so for first time under Modi ji... we are ahead of information available to Hellinists and Latinists.
