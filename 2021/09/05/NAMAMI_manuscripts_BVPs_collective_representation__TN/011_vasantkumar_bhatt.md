Respected Scholars of BVP,

\(1\) NMAMI was founded in 2003, and after every three years tenor, the mission gets renewed for further 3 years ! It has no permanent status ! Because it's called a "mission " ( भारत सरकार के सभी अभियान- Mission - , जैसे कि बाल शिक्षा अभियान, स्त्री शिक्षा अभियान आदि तीन तीन वर्ष के ही होते हैं । )

\(2\) The National Mission for Manuscripts (NMM) has been started in 2003, but up to September 2021 the Mission doesn't have any vision or output !

  

\(3\) 90 percentage of the sanctioned posts are temporary , since it's inception ! Even the post of a Director is filled up with " in charge Director ". & It's natural that no good eligible subject expert will join there for only three years job.

\(4\) In many periodical meetings of executive/ advisory committee, the demand for making the manuscripts digital copy available on the website is raised. किन्तु ऊर्ध्वबाहु विरौम्येषः, न कश्चित् शृणोति माम् ।।
