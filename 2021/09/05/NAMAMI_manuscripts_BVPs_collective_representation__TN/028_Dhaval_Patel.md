Yes. It was difficult and complicated matter. Hence it took almost 7 years from 2014 to 2021. Now, there is an order of a competent authority for allowing access.

The order says that the compliance has to be made within 1 month. It does not mean that the access would be for limited period.

All manuscripts digitized by NMM (roughly 3 lacs by NMM submission) have to be put in public domain within a period of 1 year.

Thank you for your wishes. It was always a public fight for public cause. RTI act does not recognize right of a body or association of people. It only recognises right of a citizen of India to access information. Therefore, I had to apply in personal capacity as a citizen of India.
