Dear Mr. Gargeshwari,

  

I am particularly interested about the first part of order asking NMM to put all 3 lacs digitized manuscripts in public domain within a year.

  

Regarding the second part asking NMM to allow download of 30,000 manuscripts, NMM submitted during hearing that these 30,000 manuscripts are already available for view on NMM website. They are not available for download. I have not verified that statement yet. But, if true, it would mean that the NMM would allow me to download 30000 manuscripts from read-only to downloadable format.

  

Alternatively,

If anyone wants access to those 30000 manuscripts, they can directly apply to NMM under citing this CIC order. The matter is already decided. So, NMM would be bound to give parity to their demand. The matter is no longer res integra. They will be bound by principle of res judicata.  
  

Dr. Dhaval Patel
