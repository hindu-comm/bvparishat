हरिः ॐ,

  

 As with all sarkaari projects the NAMAMI has been sluggish in uploading digitised manuscripts under its care.

  

 Can we as a group please reach a collective decision to remind the NAMAMI authorities to make the scholastic heirloom of this rāṣṭra collected by them available to us all. After all that was the promise with which the manuscripts were procured from common people.

  

 I request the group moderators to please suggest a plan of action. I am ready to do anything for this as instructed by the moderators.

  

स्वस्ति,

   भवानीभारती विजयतेतमाम्,

                   श्रीवत्सः ॥
