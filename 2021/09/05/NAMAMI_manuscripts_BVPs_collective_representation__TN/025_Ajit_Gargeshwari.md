This is not going to be straightforward. Controlled accessis alwaysgiven by manuscript repositories earlier as photo copies now as digitised Images. How quickand simple the process can be or how difficult in practice it is is a differentquestion.

  

Now is National Manuscript Mission duty bound to provide free unlimitedaccessto its digital content created with public finances. Having agreements with repostaries is a difficult and complicated decision.

  

The Information Commissioner order gives accessto limited and controlled access toDr. Dhaval for a small fraction of the collection for a limitedperiod of time. The order doesn't say which manuscripts. Can unpublished manuscripts be simply made available for view is not known.

The commercial, sentimental and cultural values associated withmanuscripts custodians view is not taken into account. It's a great step forward and I congratulateDr. Dhaval for having achievedthis personal victory for a public cause.
