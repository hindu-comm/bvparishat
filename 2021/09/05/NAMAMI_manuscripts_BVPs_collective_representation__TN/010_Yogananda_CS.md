Namaste,

  

I was a member of NAMAMI, both EC and high-powered committee. Was quite excited when appointed, but soon realised it doesn't mean much! There were in all 4-5 meetings of the EC, chaired by culture secretary, no meetings at all of the High-powered committee which is to be chaired by the cultureminister. The secretary changed - the first two meetings had one Sri Sinha who was good. He in fact greeted me when I introduced myself, and said it was good to see at least one technology person in the committee (all others were Sanskrit / manuscript experts); on his suggestion I did make a proposal totake the project to the next stage of validation of data and making it accessible. Most of the time / meetings wereconsumed by the extension to the project - the project time expired in 2016, and there were efforts to make it into a separate entityinsteadof being under IGNCA; the project staff's existence and salaries were also a big issue. Once during the time I was in Delhi for one of the meetings, I sought and got an appointment with Sri Vivek Debroy. He did look impressed with my suggestions and my other work and said he would get back to me which hasn'thappened till now. The letter of appointment did not have any specific period and so am not sure when I seem to have been out of the committees.

  

regards. . . . . . yoga
