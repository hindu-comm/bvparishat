Definitely NP varya.

  

As you have responsibility in Indic Academy and there are members of the latter here, will it be possible for you to broach this topic to the academy and get them to sign a letter of support?

  

I request the heads of universities present in this list to express their support to this cause either here or off list. We will follow this up with collecting formal signed letters of support from you.

  

I will soon draft a brief letter to the authorities concerned.

  

I need the help of moderators in identifying the heads of univs on this list.

  

स्वस्ति,

   भवानीभारती विजयतेतमाम्,

                 श्रीवत्सः ॥
