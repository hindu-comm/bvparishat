Dear scholars,

  

There had been a good amount of discussion in this thread regarding manuscripts digitized by NMM.

  

I would like to bring it to the notice of this august gathering that my second appeal in honourable Central Information Commission was decided on 30.10.2021. The order is attached herewith.

  

Honourable Information Commissioner Mr. Uday Mahurkar has decided this matter with a well reasoned order.

  

The order directs NMM to do two things.

1\. Put the digitized manuscripts (roughly 3 lacs) in public domain within a period of 1 year

and

2\. Allow me access of 30000 manuscripts for downloading the same within a period of 1 month.

  

This order would surely pave the way for easier access of manuscripts digitized by NMM to research scholars.

  

I once again pay my respects to the honourable Information Commissioner for enabling access to this centuries old manuscript treasure of India. I also place my appreciation on record for NMM and manuscript repositories without whose support the manuscripts would not have been digitized, and their digital access would have been impossible.

  

Dr. Dhaval Patel
