I applied to NMM for giving details. The data in which I got in 2015 is available at<https://archive.org/details/NationalManuscriptMission> . It contains details of catalogued / digitized manuscripts till 2015, along with the repository from which data was collected.

  

As far as digitized manuscripts available for viewing is concerned, the number is 0.
