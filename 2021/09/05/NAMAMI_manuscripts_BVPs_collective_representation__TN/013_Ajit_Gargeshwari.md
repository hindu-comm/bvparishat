This answers all the questions I had answered earlier

  

Prof Paturi. wrote "Does this mean uploading to the internet or not , we need to check through some RTI letter or something like that."

  

Once we have clear informationthen the digitised manuscripts can be hosted publicly or privately or by National Mission for Manuscripts. (I guess they will have some agreement with manuscript repositories they conserve and digitise).

If no information is givenbyNational Mission for Manuscripts then a petition can be launched.  

If there is a well thought strategy we will succeed in making what they have digitised available to all else hardly any action will be taken.
