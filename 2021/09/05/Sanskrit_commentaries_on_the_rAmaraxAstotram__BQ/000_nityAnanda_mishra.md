The below four Sanskrit commentaries are mentioned byGudrun Bühnemann in*Budhakauśika’s Rāmarakṣāstotra*. A Contribution to the Study of Sanskrit Devotional Poetry. Vienna: Institut für Indologie, Universität Wien 1983 (= Publications of the De Nobili Research Library 10).

  

I have (2), the Mantrarāmāyaṇam by Nīlakaṇṭha Caturdhara. I am looking for (1), the commentary by Mudgala. As for (3), the commentary byGovindadāsa/Gomatīdāsa Vaiṣṇava and (4), the commentary byDharaṇīdhara Pantha, I do not think they have been published. Does anybody know about them?

  

Also, are there any other Sanskrit commentaries on the *stotra*?

  

\(1\) Rāmarakṣāstotram. Mudgalacaryakṛtaṭīkāsahitam. Rājarājeśvarī Yantrālaya. Varanasi 1907. This is an incomplete commentary, explaining only verses 1–15 of the popular edition of the Rāmarakṣāstotram.  
  
(2) Nīlakaṇṭha Caturdhara. Mantrarāmāyaṇam. This contains a partial commentary explaining six verses of the popular edition of the Rāmarakṣāstotram.  
  
(3) Bühnemann concludes that the below two manuscripts are of the same commentary.  
3a) Rāmarakṣā (with a commentary by Govindadāsa), 82 pages, 10 lines, 1000 Ślokas. Unpublished, mentioned in catalogues of Sanskrit manuscripts seen in Oudh.  
3b) Śrīrāmarakṣāvyākhyā. A commentary on the Śrī Rāmarakṣā by Gomatīdāsa Vaiṣṇava, 82 pages, 10 lines, 1000 Ślokas. Unpublished, mentioned in catalogues of Sanskrit manuscripts seen in Oudh.  
  
4) A commentary by Dharaṇīdhara Pantha. Mentioned in Aufrecht’s Catalogus Catalogorum I. p.518 in the “List of Manuscripts discovered in Oudh during the year 1876 by Nesfield, ass. By Devīprasād”.
