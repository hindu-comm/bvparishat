While teaching Vedanta the teachers invariably teach other doctrines so as to see the merits and demerits. The quest was for truth and hence all the doctrines were studied in order to establish the validity of their own doctrine. There are several doctrines because different people perceived them to be the truth.

  

Sometimes the depiction of the rival doctrine may not be very perfect but we do study them as honestly as possible. Moreover the scholars of old debated with their rivals and in the process they learned all the intricacies too. So it was natural for Shankaracharya to know the prevailing doctrines.

  

It is unfortunate that our scholars are not doing purva-paksha of the present day challengers.
