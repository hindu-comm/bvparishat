Namaste,

  

My friend told me that this episode:

  

"Sri Shankaracharya went to a Buddhist Vihara to learn Buddhism".  

  

is not there in any of the 4 Shankara Digvijayas. Is this true?

  

If so, why did this misunderstanding happen?

  

Should we understand that somehow he studied Buddhism from his teachers?
