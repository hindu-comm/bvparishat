Sri Krishna Kashyap statement may no be recorded in the Sankara Digvijaya in versions we have today. Calling Sri Sanakarcharya asprachanna bauddha, Maya vadi etc by his opponent's is not new .
Why should Sri Shankaracharya have not studied Buddhism he very well could have Any way this may not be place to enter into polemics or debate
