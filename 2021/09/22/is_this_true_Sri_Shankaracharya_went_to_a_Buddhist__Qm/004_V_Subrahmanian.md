There are many stories that have come to be circulated and no one knows how authentic they are. There is even a Shankara Vijaya which holds that Ramanuja and Madhva were direct disciples of Shankara.<https://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp/sankara-vijayam.html>

  

It is only with regard to Kumarila Bhatta there is a story that he lived in a Buddhist monastery, in disguise as a Buddhist jijnasu, with a view to learn their system and was found out and meted out punishment by them. Later he self-immolated for such 'sins'.
