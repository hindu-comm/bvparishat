Namaste,

  

 Is there something like this for Sanskrit (taken from <https://archive.org/details/dli.ernet.503070/page/99/mode/2up>)? The closes I've seen is<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustani_phonology> but it has not pictures, only a vowel chart.

Does<https://archive.org/details/ACriticalStudyOfSanskritPhonetics_Mishra/img167_2R.jpg> remains the only book on Sanskrit phonetics?

  

Regards,

Marcis
