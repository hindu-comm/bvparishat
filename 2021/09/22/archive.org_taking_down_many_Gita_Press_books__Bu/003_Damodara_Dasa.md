Hare Krishna.  
  
Respected vidvaj-janas,  
My few cents of a suggestion here:  
  
There could be a system in Archive.org itself that anyone (for  
instance say me) uploads a book or media and sets the license of his  
page as public, then the location of the page and files should become  
global which means that even if the person decides to delete these  
things from his own account, still it is available at the same link  
for all. Such files and pages can be permanently deleted only by  
[archive.org](http://archive.org) officials. The persons who have personal accounts can  
still delete their entries from their accounts.  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
