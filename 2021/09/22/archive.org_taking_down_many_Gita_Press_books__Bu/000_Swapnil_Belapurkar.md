Jai SitaRam,

  

I am observing that many good Gita Press books which were available on [archive.org](http://archive.org) are being taken down. This includes the entire 6 khanda of Mahabharata published by Gita Press or vyakarana books such as Bhaimi Teeka on Laghu Sidhant Kaumudi.

  

I don't believe it is Gita Press which is taking down these books. Many of their Purana, Ramayana are available on [archive.org](http://archive.org) for all. It seems to be the work of some self-important book scanner.

  

It is disappointing and scary that some self-important book scanners can veto knowledge distribution by random deletions of [archive.org](http://archive.org).

  

May I suggest Indica academy can help host a Hindu centric e-book server ? Shri Nagaraj garu plz weigh in with your thoughts !

  

Jai SitaRam,

Swapnil
