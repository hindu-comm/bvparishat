Dear SitaRam,

  

This concurs with my experience too.

  

Is there a monitor for Archive.org which keeps notifying  

which new books have been added each day or each week ?

  

The moment a Sanskrit/Indology-related book makes an appearance,  

it must immediately be copied to (at least) half a dozen locations/collections  

(if possible automatically), and preserved there.
