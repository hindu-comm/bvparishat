Since a publishing agreement is between the copywrite holder and publisher it cannot exceed the duration of the copywrite itself.

Copywrite laws varies from country to country.

Let me make my understanding clear Puranas of works of Kalidasa are not udder copywrite it public domain but if I make a edition of a purana or works of Kaildasa then such a work is under my copywrite. If I have spent 20 years to write introduction and critical notes such material is under my copywrite. If my work gets illegally uploaded or copies are made I can make a request not to do and if the request fails can take recourse to law. If such an activity hurts the publishers interest then the publisher can act as per law. If the publisher or copywrite holder is not bothered none should be bothered.

The key is making a balance between knowledge dissemination, rights of individual and business. Unfortunately the balance has tilted towrds publishers and the author or editor hardly see any money. Open publishing is best if it can be sustained but its left to authors to decide on what they want to do with their material
