There is a difference between publishing rights and copywrite

One can delete what what one uploads on [arches.org](http://arches.org)

I totally agree copywrite material should not be uploaded its against law.

The copywrite holder feels his or her rights are violated its he or she who need to take up the issue. Let others not decide what is one rights.

  

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act requires that a claim of copyright infringement be sent to the service provider, providing specific information as outlined below.

DMCA Section (512)(f) provides penalties for knowingly misrepresenting a claim.

DMCA Section 512(c)(3)(A) requires the following of notices alleging copyright infringement:

ELEMENTS OF NOTIFICATION. To be effective under this subsection, a notification of claimed infringement must be a written communication provided to the Registered Agent of a service provider that includes substantially the following:(i)A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. \[As an electronic signature, our agent accepts facsimile/fax and digitized image of your signature attached to electronic mail.\](ii)Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site.(iii)Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material.\[Please include a URL such as http://.../.../... identifying the material or representative material. If possible, specify any IDs, passwords, or other authorization required to access the material. Please specify date, time, and time zone from which the material was observed. Technicians may require time information in order to identify dynamically assigned internet locations.(iv)Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted.(v)A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.(**vi)A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

DMCA Section 512(d)(3) requires similar information for notices requesting removal of links or other references to infringing materials.
