Copyright is for a duration once the right expires anyone can publish including digital publishing unless copywrite is renewed.

  

I scan a out of copywrite material I can upload to [archives.org](http://archives.org) under a creative common license or without such a license.

I can only point out if my rights have been violated. I cannot decide if others rights are violated. If I don't have objection to my material being used why should others.

If the copywrite holder has objections or questions it must be directed to concerned person or the website .

  

A publishing write is a permission or an agreement between the copywrite holder and a publisher which has a fixed duration.

  

The Grey area is for works whose copywrite cannot be clearly determined.
