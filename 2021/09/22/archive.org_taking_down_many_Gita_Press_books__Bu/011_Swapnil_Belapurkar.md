Jai SitaRam,  

  

Shri Balasubramanian Ramakrishnan,

  

To clarify: I purchase every Gita Press book I read.

I have the entire 6 khanda Mahabharata and other Puranas with me published by Gita Press.

I am not looking to save money by relying on [archive.org](http://archive.org) instead of buying.

  

I use [archive.org](http://archive.org) for two purposes:

1\. Disseminatingshloka and other interesting information in Itihasa , Purana. This is very helpful when discussing a specificpart with other vidvaans.

Photos of hard copy books taken with a phone are not very clear. On the other hand [archive.org](http://archive.org) has very clear scans.

2\. Some very rare books are not available on Gita Press site for purchase at all. One such book is Bhaimi Teeka of Laghu Siddhant Kaumudi.

 This is a very niche topic and Gita press lists no book currently for purchase. But [archive.org](http://archive.org) has uploads that can help students.

  

Ajit,

1\. Are you speaking on behalf of Gita Press here ? If so in what capacity i.e. do you work for Gita Press?

2\. 'Copyright' of Mahabharata & Puranas will be with Bhagvan Vedvyasa.

  I hope no publisher or Canon Xerox scanner is proclaiming to be Bhagvan Vedvayasa. :-)

  

Jai SitaRam,

Swapnil
