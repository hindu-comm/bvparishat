Dear Damodara Dasa ji,

As you have contributed quite a few items to [archive.org](http://archive.org),

please check/discuss with them formally, or better even informally,  

regarding their fuller schemes and policies, legal issues/embarrassments,  

and headaches and solutions etc. so that we get a better picture of the whole situation.

What if one fellow (not the publisher, but only an uploader) demands removal of a book,

but another uploads the same saying the former uploader is not the publisher.

  

Is there a possible way of getting to know about the typical uploaders

and the typical removal-demanders? And about how many books have been removed

so far? And what is usually the fate of the books removed?
