Very good point.

Contradicts the prior very good point. If reproduction is explicitly barred, there will be a note stating something like "All rights reserved". If it is explicitly allowed, there will be some reference to a license like[cc-by-nc](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/) . Otherwise, it's a grey area.
