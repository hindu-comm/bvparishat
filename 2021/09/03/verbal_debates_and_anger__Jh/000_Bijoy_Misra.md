Dear friends,

Some may be observing various jests and angry words hurled in the list.

Part of our work in speech generation has been to examine where does

speech procure its emotional content. The theory that we propose is that  

the वर्ण has to develop pure and then get stained with the local feelings.  

The time scale of the staining is not experimented yet. This is different than

treating the वर्ण as a behavioral element when the speech is not composed  

but is delivered through imitation or memory..

Sorry for this digression.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
