We are pleased to publish this book by the venerable S N Balagangadhara & Sarika Rao.

  

Our first event is going to be held tomorrow at London with Sri Gautam Sen, Sri Prakash Shah and Amish Tripathi. Will be a small private event.

  

We are also distributing review copies to our Curators list as well as the 1000 reviewer Club.

  

If you would like to receive a copy and be added to our Curators list , please send your address and mobile number privately to Vadde Srinivas marked on this mail.

  

Over the period of next few months we will be doing a series of events all over the world.
