Very shocked to learn that Professor T.N. Dharmadhikari is no more. An irreperable void is created by this sad demise in the field of Indological studies in general and Vedic studies in particular. Prof. Dharmadhikari was a loving personality and kind enough to visit our School of Vedic Studies, Rabindra Bharati University, Kolkata, for delivering a seminar lecture. May this great soul attain the divine bliss and deep condolences are being expressed  
to the bereaved members of the family.
