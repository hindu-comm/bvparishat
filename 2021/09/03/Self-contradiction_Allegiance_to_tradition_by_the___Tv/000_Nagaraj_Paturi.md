In the excerpts from Prof. Johannes Bronkhorst cited in the BVP thread

  

<https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/jLYzQ0L1Zys/m/AGwkXEa5BQAJ>  

  

says,

  

**"Traditions**whether religious corporate or national, including in the Indian context, traditions relating to castes**are by their very nature the enemies of historical scholarship**."'  

  

Here he pitches 'traditions' against 'historical scholarship'.

  

In the same excerpts we see him saying,

  

"**We are not**, or not primarily,**entertainers**. We have a far**more important role**to play, viz., to**defend the Enlightenment values**that we consider vital for the society we live in."

  

He also says, in one of the excerpts cited there,

  

"Our Enlightenment predecessors did not hesitate one second to criticize tradition, any tradition. Indeed, this is precisely what they were primarily known, criticized and admired for."

  

I have been saying right from my post at

in different posts on this forum that it is this 'defending the enlightenment values' is one of the primary motivations of all these 'modern' (he uses the word 'modern' too repeatedly in the excerpts) scholars whether from the west or from India for their attacks on tradition(s) and 'religion'(s).

  

They claim that they are not particularly against a specific tradition like Hindu tradition or not particularly against any specific 'religion' like Hindu 'religion'.

  

But the interesting point is that enlightenment itself is already at least three centuries old. This kind of adherence to a certain values of it for such a long time makes the activity of these adherers , a 'tradition'. 'Defending' of those values here constitutes a tradition, but interestingly of anti-traditionalist approach. That is the inevitable self-contradiction in all such approaches.

  

Many of those who are against the notion of Guru , guide, quote a person who inspired them to follow that anti-Guru approach, without realizing that that person is being taken by them as a/the Guru.

  

Those who follow teachers/preachers of 'deconditioning' do not realize how much they are conditioned by that deconditioning preacher.

  

Many strands of post-modernism belong to the genealogy of skepticism, (genealogy is a pet term of one of the fountain heads of post-modern thought Michel Foucault and his followers). Any strand of skepticism , skepticism being doubting the truth of someting, do not doubt the truth of their strand of skepticism. Same is the case with different strands of post-modernism.

  

We can go on and on to show the inherent self-contradiction in all these anti-traditional approaches. They quite often constitute stronger traditions than the traditions that they oppose and they are more traditional than the most traditional of the traditions that they oppose.

  

Most anti-religious people adhere to and defend their anti-religiousness more religiously than the religious that they oppose.

  

Modernity started with the pride of 'breaking with the past'. But with the emergence of the post modern it itself became the past.

  

If you see that traditional , religious adherence to and defense of the 'modern' in these scholars during the present times of fashionability of the post-modern, they come out as some obsolete stuff. 

  

(More on their religious adherence of these to 'History' in my next post)
