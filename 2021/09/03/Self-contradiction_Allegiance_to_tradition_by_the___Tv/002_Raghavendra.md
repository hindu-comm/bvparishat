Respected scholars,

  

Greetings of the day,

  

Prof. Johannes Bronkhorst is currently engaged in editing and translating ‚óÜsarva-darshana-sangraha‚óÜ which is likely to be published next year.

  

Given the 'antinomies' involved in his views and writings appended to the thread here, I wonder what damage is in store to our tradition at the hands of Prof. Johannes Bronkhorst ü§î

  

We have to wait and watch.

  

Couole of months ago, I had one to one correspondence with him challenging his views, it is at that time he mentioned about the above project being undertaken by him. It appears that he has been working on it for the past 3 years.  
  
Thank you and Best regards,  
B. Raghavendra

Very well said, clearly pointed out, Nagaraj ji.

  

I taught in a Krishnamurti School for two years (back in the 1980s) and saw for myself the paradox of "letting go" while being all tied up with the letting go spokesperson :-)

  

Regards,

  

Ramesh
