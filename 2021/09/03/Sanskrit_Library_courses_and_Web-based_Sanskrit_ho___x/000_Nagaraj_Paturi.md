Dear Colleagues,

  

Registration is still open for The Sanskrit Library's**three new courses**beginning from 6, 12, and 18 September. The Introductory Sanskrit course features the**debut of Web-based Sanskrit homework exercises**.

  

**CG20. Introduction to the Pāṇinian tradition, beginning 18 September.**

This course offers an overview of the architecture of Pāṇini’s*Aṣṭādhyāyī*as well as an introduction to the whole Indian grammatical tradition.

  

**US101a. Introductory Sanskrit Ia, beginning 12 September.**

This is the first of four courses Ia--b, IIa-b, offered in four quarters over the coming year that presents a linguistically rich introduction to Sanskrit equivalent to a first-year graduate course. In this course, we are excited to roll-out sophisticated automated exercises that provide immediate feed-back to students while doing their homework. The Web-based exercises avoid the doubt and frustration that students feel from flipping pages in dictionaries and grammar books by using cutting-edge software to provide glossary access via a flex-search interface, error-highlighting, linked help pages, etc.

  

**UP113. Introductory Sanskrit Ia. Kirātārjunīya sarga 1, beginning 6 September.**

This coures reads the first canto of the*Kirātārjunīya*, one of the Sanskrit Mahākāvyas, applying traditional oral methods of thoroughly analyzing the prosody, grammar and syntax of each verse.
