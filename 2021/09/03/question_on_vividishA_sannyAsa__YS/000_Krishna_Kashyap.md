Namaste to everyone,

  

My question on vividishAsannyAsa is :

  

Does Sri Shankaracharya talk about vividishAsannyAsa? If so please let me know the source text

  

I did find it in the jivan-mukti-vivEka of Sri VidyAraNya. What about in Sri Shankaracharya's works?

  

I am looking at the social transformation and acceptance of vividishAsannyAsa.

When did it happen? did it happen due to the words of Sri ShankarAchArya or later acharyas?
