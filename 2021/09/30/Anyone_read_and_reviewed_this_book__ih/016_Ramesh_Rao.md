Dhanyavada, Nagaraj avare, for the information about the mentions of Parashuraamaand the meanings/adumbrations in the texts.

  

The reason why I brought this book by Collins up is to highlight this issue: those knowledgeableabout and expert in Hindu texts fail to engage Western scholars who write about our texts, seek and propose "theories" to explain the texts, and those "theories" and "findings" then make it to the mainstream -- both internationally and in India such that our students and our children reading these explanations and subscribing to them.

  

When Hindu experts fail to challenge these theories and findings, those of us, like me, who are only superficially informed about the texts but who are exercised enough over what are clearly idiosyncratic applications of social science theories to "unpack" our texts seek to respond, and can do so only partially.

  

I hope therefore that scholars on this list will take some time to read Collins' work and consider if there are major and serious misrepresentations, false theorizing, and bogus findings.

  

From just reading his preface, I am concerned about the nature and thrust of the book.

  

Regards,

  

Ramesh Rao
