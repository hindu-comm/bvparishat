In which text is it mentioned that Parashurama, in the Treta yuga, was an avatara of Vishnu?

  

Just reading the provocative preface of Collins' book makes me wonder what it is he has presented, and whether his work has been read carefully by Indian experts.

  

If Indian philanthropists keep pouring money into endowing chairs in American universities, and experts do not keep tab on the kind of work done by those who occupy those chairs, then we lose twice.
