Ah, I keep discovering tell-tale marks of the Chicago/Doniger influences -- from the Amazon website bio of Collins:

  

"Over the course of earning his PhD with his mentor Wendy Doniger at the University of Chicago Divinity School, he became a specialist in Hindu epics with a deep interest in comparing mythologies across cultures. Since then, Prof. Collins has published research on sacrificial violence, the history of the history of religions, the psychoanalytic study of myth, and (sometimes) Bollywood horror movies".
