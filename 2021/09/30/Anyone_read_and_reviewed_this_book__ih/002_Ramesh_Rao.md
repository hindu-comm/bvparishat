Ajit ji,

  

Are any of the reviewers by Indian scholars, and if there are any, would you happen to have links to those reviews?

  

Since Brian uses "psychoanalysis", without the qualification needed to do so, and doing it on deities, and imagined others of antiquity, just like Courtright did on Lord Ganapati, I want to know what the reception Brian's book was, and if it is worth spending my time to discover yet another reading of an avatara on the couch of an American academic.

  

Regards,

  

Ramesh Rao
