The Book of the Axe is supposed to be a reprint of an edition published some years ago, but it has been so much enlarged and so much more fully illustrated with lithographs and woodcuts, that it may claim to be regarded as a new work.

  

As far as reviewed by an Indian Scholar working from an Indian University or research organization. I don't know

  

Dinnell, Darry, ‘Review of The Other Rāma: Matricide and Genocide in the Mythology of Paraśurāma’, Journal of Dharma Studies, 4.1 (2021), 155–57  

Here is a review

*The Other Rāma*presents a systematic analysis of the myth cycle of Paraśurāma ("Rāma with the Axe"), an avatáraof Viṣṇu best known for decapitating his own mother and annihilating twenty-one generations of the Kṣatriya warrior caste in an extermination campaign frequently referred to as "genocide" by modern scholars. Compared to Rāma and Kṛṣṇa, the other human forms of Viṣṇu, Paraśurāma has a much darker reputation, with few temples devoted to him and scant worshippers. He has also attracted far less scholarly attention. But dozens of important castes and clans across the subcontinent claim Paraśurāma as the originator of their bloodline, and his mother, Reṇukā, is worshipped in the form of a severed head throughout South India.  
  
Using the tools of comparative mythology and psychoanalysis, Brian Collins identifies three major motifs in the mythology of Paraśurāma: his hybrid status as a Brahmin warrior, his act of matricide, and his bloody one-man war to cleanse the earth of Kṣatriyas. Collins considers a wide variety of representations of the myth, from its origins in the*Mahābhārata*to contemporary debates online. He also examines Paraśurāma alongside the Wandering Jew of European legend and*Psycho*'s matricidal serial killer Norman Bates. He examines why mythmakers once elevated this transgressive and antisocial figure to the level of an*avatāra*and why he still holds such fascination for a world that continues to grapple with mass killings and violence against women
