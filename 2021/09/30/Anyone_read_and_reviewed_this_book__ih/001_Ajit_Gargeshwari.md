The Gawande’s philanthropy began when Ram Gawande, William Harlan and Rajindar Koshal established the Friends of India organization in 1984, a move that was in reaction to the assassination of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi the same year. All were long-time members of Athens Rotary Club and Rotary International.

Drs. Ram and Sushila Gawande moved to Athens in the 1970s and became known for their philanthropy throughout the community.
