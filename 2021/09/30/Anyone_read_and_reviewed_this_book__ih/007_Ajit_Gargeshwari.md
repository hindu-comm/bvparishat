In the Treta Yug,[Lord Vishnu](https://rgyan.com/blogs/tag/lord-vishnu/)was born as Parshuram Avatar to sage Jamadagni and Renuka. He was the youngest among the four sons and was the most powerful of them all. Parshu means axe, therefore his name means Rama with an axe. He had received the axe as a gift from Lord Shiva as a result of his meditation. He was an ardent devotee of Lord Shiva.

न जायते म्रियते वा कदाचिन्नायं भूत्वा भविता वा न भूयः।  
अजो नित्यः शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणो न हन्यते हन्यमाने शरीरे।।2.20।।
