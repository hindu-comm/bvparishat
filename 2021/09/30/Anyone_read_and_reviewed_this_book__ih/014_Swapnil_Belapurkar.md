Jai Sitaram Nagaraj garu,

  

Thanks for patiently dealing with earlierposts. My response to some queries/assertions in earlierposts.

  

Shri Arvinda,

"Namaskars,The Ramayana of Valmiki does not show Parasurama as an avatar of Vishnu."

  

By that standard Bhagvan ShriKrishna or Bhagvan Kalki aren't mentioned in Ramayana either.

We can't claim based on Ramayana in isolation. You will find explanations of many events of Ramayana in otherItihasa Purana.

We Hindus need to take a collective approach for our Itihas Purana. An event mentioned at one place will have an explanation somewhere else.

So not being mentioned in one text does notnegate the fact.

\[For example, Padma Purana has a beautiful explanation why Sita Maa had to live separately from Bhagvan ShriRam. We have to read all the possible Itihasa Purana.\]

  

Shri Ramesh,

" In which text is it mentioned that Parashurama, in the Treta yuga, was an avatara of Vishnu?"

Multiple. Mahabharata says it. There is a Purana which tells that Bhagvan Parshurama took avatar during sandhyaa of Satya and Treta.

We should make some effort to read ItihasaPurana (I read Gita Press editions which are quite good.).

Basing our view on books written by those outside Sanatan Hindu sanskaar is not good.

  

Shri Ajit,  

I see you quoted Wikipedia. I am surprised that you didn'tquote any of the above. I am sure you must have come across Bhagvan Parshuramain at least one of Hindu text ?

I suggest reading the following to check further: Mahabharata, Narada Purana, Padma Purana.

  

Here is some info.

1\. Padma Purana mentions briefly about Bhagvan Parshurama as an avatara of Bhagvan Vishnu.

2\. Kurma Purana mentions Bhagvan Shiva himself is Bhagvan Parshurama.

Kurama Purana Ishwar Geeta 7:6.

3\. Mahabharata in Shishupal Vadh Parva has Bhishma telling Shishupala about all the avatars of Vishnu. Bhagvan Parshurama is mentioned.  

In Shanti Parva there is a mention that the parshu of Bhagvan Parshuram was given by Bhagvan Shiva himself.

  

4\. Ganesha Purana mentions Bhagvan Parshurama as Shivasvarupa and same as Bhagvan Vishnu.

I can post other screenshots links but I will suggest those interested to check relevant sections mentioned above.  

  

There is no doubt at all that Bhagvan Parshuram was the avatar of Bhagvan. It is attested by multiple mentions in Itihasa and Purana.

Perhaps the exhaustive list will be a bit long.

  

FInally, it is a little bit disappointing to see the lack of basic information about Hindu dharma in BVP.  

  

Jai SitaRam,  

Swapnil
