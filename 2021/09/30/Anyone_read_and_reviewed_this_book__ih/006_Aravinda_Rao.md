Namaskars,

The Ramayana of Valmiki does not show Parasurama as an avatar of Vishnu. He is shown as a powerful rishi, and only that much. He is said to have earned several loka-s by his tapas, but Rama knocks them down when he releases his unfailing (amogha) arrow from the bow given by Parasurama. The very fact that Parasurama, like all other sages had earned several loka-s which are ephemeral in nature, shows that Valmiki did not portray him as the avatar of Vishnu. Even the Sanskrit commentaries on the Ramayana do not mention him as an avatara. Moreover, Valmiki makes a significant statement when Parasurama leaves the scene, 'aatma-lokamjagaama', which means that he went in his own way, or 'he pursued the knowledge of atman'. Having given up the futile quest for loka-s and pursued aatma-jnanam.

The Srimad-Bhagavatam, however, shows Parasurama as an avatar of Vishnu in just one sloka (1-3-20).

``` अवतारे षोडशमे पश्यन् ब्रह्मद्रुहो नृपान् । त्रिःसप्तकृत्वः कुपितो निःक्षत्रामकरोन्महीम् ॥ २०॥
```

He is said to have gone round 21 times (not 21 generations) and eliminated the kshatriya-s who were opposed to Vedas (Vedic culture).

I do not know how he is depicted in other purana-s. It will be interesting to know how other texts have depicted him.
