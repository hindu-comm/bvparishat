Sri Ajit-ji,

  

None of the details from the itihasa purana sources is being disputed here.

  

Dr Aravinda Rao garu is pointing out the difference in the presentation of Parasu Rama in different texts.

  

Dr Ramesh Rao avaru is suspicious about the interpretation of the narratives and their details, not regarding the details itself.

  

-----------------------------

  

Dr Ramesh Rao avare,

  

I did not read the book on Parasu Rama by Brian Collins.

  

But browsedalmost all that is easily accessible about him and his books, teaching etc.

  

Though the blurbs, intros etc. are using the word Psychoanalysis, I am not sure if it is Freudian or Jungian. I thought of this because in his bio details , it is mentioned that it is Jungian Psychoanalysis that drew him to the rest of his academic pursuits.

  

His other book "The Head Beneath the Altar: Hindu Mythology and the Critique of Sacrifice " is mentioned in all the reviews to have used and interacted with Rene Girard's Mimetic Theory , particularly the its portion dealing with violence. All in all, this book seems to propose that Vedic idea of sacrifice provides an alternative, counter to the Christian idea of sacrifice. This theory of Girard is not Freudian at all.

  

The common theme in all the three Parasurama, Sacrifice and Bollywood is 'violence'.

  

The AAR announcement has names that are not in the Hindophobicsyndicate. That makes one think if this author too is not to be suspected for Hinduphobia.

  

I will check more and revert.
