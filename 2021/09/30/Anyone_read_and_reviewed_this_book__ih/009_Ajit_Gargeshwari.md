He plays important roles in the*Mahabharata*serving as mentor toBhishma(chapter 5.178),Drona(chapter 1.121) andKarna(chapter 3.286), teaching weapon arts and helping key warriors in both sides of the war

  

He is generally presented as the fifth son of Renuka andrishi(seer)Jamadagni.The legends of Parashurama appear in many Hindu texts, in different versions:

-   In Chapter 6 of the*Devi Bhagavata Purana*, he is born from the
    thigh with intense light surrounding him that blinds all warriors,
    who then repent their evil ways and promise to lead a moral life if
    their eyesight is restored. The boy grants them the boon.\[9\] -   In Chapter 4 of the*Vishnu Purana*, Rcika prepares a meal for two
    women, one simple, and another with ingredients that if eaten would
    cause the woman to conceive a son with martial powers. The latter is
    accidentally eaten by Renuka, and she then gives birth to
    Parashurama.\[9\] -   In Chapter 2 of the*Vayu Purana*, he is born after his mother
    Renuka eats a sacrificial offering made to bothRudra(Shiva)
    andVishnu, which gives him dual characteristics of Kshatriya and
    Brahmin.

According to theSangraha Parva, after killing 21 generations of Kshatriyas, he filled their blood in five pools collectively known as the*Samantha Panchaka*(Sanskrit: समंत पञ्चक). He later atoned for his sin by severe penance. The five pools are considered to be holy.

TheAnukramanika Parvasays that the Samantha Panchaka is located somewhere around Kurukshetra. It also mentions that the Pandavas performed a few religious rites near the Samantha Panchaka before the Mahabharata War at Kurukshetra.
