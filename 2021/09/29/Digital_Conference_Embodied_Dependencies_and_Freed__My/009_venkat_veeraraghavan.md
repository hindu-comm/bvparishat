Dear Sir,

  

I agree that knowledge of these programs are essential for rebuttals, but don't you think deigning these prejudiced hack-jobs with a purvapaksha(pp)would give them the legitimacy normally afforded to positions taken within the ambit of shastra? Like for example topics within the dvaita - advaita debate where both positions accept the primacy of the vedas and are both based on a common set of axioms is worthwhile doing a purvapaksha on.

  

Is it worthwhile entering the rabbit hole of western academia's prejudices, assumptions and sociological frameworks to do a pp? Would it not amount to lending legitimacy to this loony fringe that masquerades as scholarship?

Most academicians in the west (not all) have unwholesome agendas in whatever it is that they do in this field. Is a pp going to change their agends/ stance or is it going to lend them legitimacy by deigning to engage a foreign actor trying to comment about local practices without the cultural, linguistic or sociological context?

  

Doeseverynoise in the corresponding department inBonn or London need to be answered? What is the sme of the actors involved? What are their motivations?

  

I think scholars like you are better positioned to decide.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
