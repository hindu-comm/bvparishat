I expected that scholars might express their to such a thesis/hypothesis .

  

Our Sri Swapnil did send a post expressing his objection. It had to be disallowed for the reason of impolite language. I did ask him to avoid those expressions and resend it.

  

In fact, I myself wanted to share my reasons for my disagreement with the formulation.

  

But the topic itself is interesting.

  

When two cultural items in two different cultures are found to be similar, one may take a stand of diffusion or a coincidence. Unless strong evidences are shown for an actual diffusion or influence, the similarities are taken as coincidence. Sometimes the inferred path of diffusion is argued, with evidence, to be just the opposite of what is inferred.

  

But to identify intellectual discussion -debate events in ancient Greece and ancient India as comparable cultural items is interesting and important. Whether a diffusion or coincidence, if diffusion, whether from Greece to India or the other way round should be inferred is a good topic to discuss.
