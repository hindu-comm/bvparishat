There are two issues here : 1. topics being focused on 2. sides being taken  

  

I said topics being chosen, if interesting, useful should inspire us to choose the same or similar topics.

  

If there is a side being taken, then comes the question of whether it is worth responding or not.

  

I hear /we see both sides of the argument.  

  

On the Indian, Indic, Hindu tradition insider side,

  

some say it is better to ignore the anti-Indian, anti-Indic, anti-Hindu stand taken. Response brings attention , 'legitimacy' (?) etc.

  

some others lament that the anti-Indian, anti-Indic, anti-Hindu stand taken is left unanswered, it is urgent to answer , respond.

  

Though the word purvapakshaoriginally belonged/belongs to Shaastra tradition , Sri Rajiv Malhotra popularized its use in the sense of Indian, Indic, Hindu tradition-insider side's response to the anti-Indian, anti-Indic, anti-Hindu interpretations, formulations, theorizations etc.

  

Dear Sri Venkat, I think the legitimacy is not coming from our responses. Those papers, publications and discussions have their own legitimacy in their own systems. For good or bad, we are in a global system where they get circulated back to our own forums , text books, researches and papers of our own scholars etc. In fact, contemporary university academics is allfully connected. No separation of your academics and my academics is possible. There is only a separation between orientations : Indian, Indic, Hindu tradition insider side and anti-Indian, anti-Indic, anti-Hindu. So there is no reason not to respond, not to participate.
