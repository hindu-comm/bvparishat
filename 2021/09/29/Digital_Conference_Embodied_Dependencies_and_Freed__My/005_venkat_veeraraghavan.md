Dear Shri Paturi Garu,

  

I agree with Shri Swapnil for being against using BVP as a platform for Hindu bashers. I really think we have been more broad minded than all the rest of the abrahamics put together and are paying the price.

  

Funnily the word catholicity can rightfully be applied to only the orientals more specifically the Hindus. Funny what semantic replanting and colonial indoctrination can do.

I'd request you to kindly vet such programs before sharing here.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
