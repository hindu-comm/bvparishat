I have a strong disagreement.

We have to protest against unreliable scholarship, how good it is packaged.

Let it be consumed where it is produced. In the early years, they were taught

as text. We have to so much to explore on our own that to engage in  

arguments of conjectures are a total waste of time. I urge all to spend time

in creating new analytic studies studying with teachers rather than arguing with  

others. All arguments are political. Scholarly arguments can happen when  

the parties have read the original text. "Why you tell me ugly and I look good"  

is a good statement when you really radiate light through your own scholarship.  

Arguments are only for the weak and the defeated. Please study the texts,  

produce new commentaries. Please don't waste time. Go small, produce a little,  

let it shine.

I have spoken enough. This should be my last post.
