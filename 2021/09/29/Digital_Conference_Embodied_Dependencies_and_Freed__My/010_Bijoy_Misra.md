Friends,  

Most of these are pure garbage.

None of the papers to be read is reviewed by any subject matter expert of the referenced topics.

The subjects are invited to see their portraits made in foreign lands out of total ignorance.

It is appaling that some scholarship rests on translated texts produced by members in the club  

and the documents are reviewed by the same group. I call upon all to escape this trap.  

This happened when Indians did not have a voice and were being "educated".

All must call an end to this distortion.  

No paper must be acceptable unless original sources are cited and explained. No translated literature  

should be used for cultural research. Papers created in such a manner should be demanded to be withdrawn.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
