Respected Scholars,

Namaste.

Greetings from the Centre for Avadhanam, a joint initiative of Chinmaya Vishwavidyapeeth and Indic Academy. We are delighted to be initiating a new Monthly Lecture Series, where subject experts would be invited to deliver talks on various forms and styles of Avadhānam, every month. The very first lecture in this series is going to be presented by renowned musician and musicologist, Dr RS Nandakumar (Mysuru), who is adept at rendering complex Avadhāna tāla pallavis and has also trained many disciples in performing these challenging musical forms.  

The event will be held on Zoom, and only those registered can participate. Therefore, request all of you who are interested in gaining fresh insights into the marvels that Saṅgītāvadhānam as an artform has to offer, to please register yourself through this link -
