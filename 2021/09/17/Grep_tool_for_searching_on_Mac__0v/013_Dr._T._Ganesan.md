Dear Ambaji,

It''s really a very useful tool. I used it. It''s so nice.  

Congratulations toi you and your team.

  

In the search results many texts are mentioned in abbreviaation.

Is there a list of abbreviations available ?

Though the search results are highly useful the abbreviations for the source texts are difficult to comprehend.

  

Any help in this matter will be highly appreciated.

  

With the best wishes

Ganesan
