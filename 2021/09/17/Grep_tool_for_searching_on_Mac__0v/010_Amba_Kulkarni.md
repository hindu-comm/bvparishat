Thank you for all the suggestions.

This tool was developed some 10 years ago, and we had also made the source code available under Github.

The text files were downloaded from the websites such as GRETIL etc as mentioned and are used with the same name as it appears on these websites.

  

Another limitation of this tool is, it uses the data on the local server. It would be good if we could use a crawler instead.

This tool also does not handle sandhied texts.

  

Anybody interested in developing / improving this further is welcome.

  

Best,

Amba Kulkarni
