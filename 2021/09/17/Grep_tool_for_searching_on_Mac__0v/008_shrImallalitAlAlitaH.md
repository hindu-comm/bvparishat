I tried to used the mentioned tool. This tool present searches as occurring in files with coded names, so it is quite difficult to ascertain whether we have desired result in desired wok or not.

Instead I prefer to have those resources downloaded as plain txt and then search in specific folder with ggrep. To add we have more number of works available with the help of Vishwas Vasuki and his friends.  

The mentioned tool may be helpful to know prAtipadikam, etc., but not so for finding exact part of text in a specific set of works.

  

I hope the tool can be tweaked by the maintainer, so that it could reveal exact title of the text. That may take a few lines of code.

If that is done, then the above tool will be more useful to a specific set of people.
