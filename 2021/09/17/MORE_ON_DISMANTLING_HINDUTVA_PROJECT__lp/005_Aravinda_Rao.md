Dear Bharat Gupt ji,

With a disarming smile and gentle tone, characteristic of yours, you have put forward some important points boldly. You have rightly pointed out that the advent of the Abrahamic religions has divided the world into two groups, one claiming the right to be a predator. You have not forgotten the idea of rasa in bhakti, which melts the heart and enables one to rise to a 'higher consciousness', as you called it. I agree with your observation that the abominable seminar is intended to hurt Hindus in the USA.

Regards,

Aravinda Rao
