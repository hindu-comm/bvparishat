DV Sir,

You presence this morning was a great encouragementto me.

So kind of you to join so early.

I am going to put out a video recording by tonight for all of you to view.

As I said in the lecture I am not an outsider to USA as my children have settled there.

So is it for millions of Hindus.

Deep Regards,

BG
