Shri Aravinda Rao garu,

Thank you for your appreciative words. You are very kind in noting that the

real battle is on two grounds (1.) making a law against Hindus in USA

alleging that they are sui generis homo hierarchicus and (2) that Hindus

practise of murti puja is essentially an error and hence all their art and

aesthetics is perverse (postulating that the hindu doctrine

of rasa is in reality an opium).

  

Hindu discourse, in my humble opinion, has to amplify these points.

Such an effort is being called revisionism because it is successfully

dismantling the Western Christian discourse of 'Brahmanism' (an actual

practise of destruction of texts and a class of scholars, done the same

way polytheist ancient Greece was vandalised by Christian iconoclasts).

The battle in America (symbolizing) is between Hinduism that offers a

more sensitiveand cosmic view of life and Christian vandalism (now disguised

as cultural marxism/wokism/militant consumerism and camaraderie with the

Islamic brothers of the book. This fight for the Hindus is global indeed and

hence needs to be fought at thatlevel.

regards,

Bharat Gupt
