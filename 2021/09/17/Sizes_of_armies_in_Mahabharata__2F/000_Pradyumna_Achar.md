Respected list members,

  

I vaguely remember that there was some paper/book/article analyzing the sizes of armies in the Mahabharata time (the Kurukshetra war as well as Jarasandha's attacks on Krishna) and concluding that such big armies are impossible because of the physical limits of the places (such as the surface area available) where they fought.

  

Request you to kindly point me to it if you remember/have a link to it.

  

Thank you.

Regards

Pradyumna
