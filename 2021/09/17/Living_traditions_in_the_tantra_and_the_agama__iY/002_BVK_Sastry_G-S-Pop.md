Namaste to all,



May I request members, if they get the time, to guide on the following:





A large number of sampradaya-s in the Tantra and Agama are vanishing/have disappeared, and are now historical details.

BVK Sastry ( ) : The sampradayas have gone underground would be a better expression. Or the ‘shrouded secrecy’ is a veil used to cover up ‘ in adept practices and greed- driven –actions. Not unusual, as history of ‘ Tantra – Mantra- practices’ even as late as nineteenth and 20^(th) centuries have shown how the high end goal of ‘ devi –saakshaatakaara’ was downgraded to ‘ abhichaara – vasheekarana’- practices. The contribution of ‘negative glorification by films as ‘ religion- mysticism – horror- exorcism ’ in projecting Tantra as ‘ evil- action’ cannot be overlooked.



But there are a few traditions that still have some adherents.



Apart from Sri Vidya, are there any other living traditions in vogue in the Tantra and the Agama?

BVK Sastry ( ) : Yes. There are many other ‘ living’ - Saiva, Vaishnava, shakta, Ganapathya - Tantra and aagama traditions, not self-declaring loudly. The sativcs have made conscious choice to yield way to ‘Vedic ( - ??) ’ culturally loaded religion-professions ; and made a conscious choice to remain dormant.

There is the Shakta tradition in Bengal, but I gather it is dying.

BVK Sastry ( ) : Bengal Shakta Tantra is a variant of ‘Dasha-Maha vidya’ tantras ; socially molested and misprojected. Sri Ramakrishna’s Kali worship is not the cup of tea of many Ramakrihsnaites themselves !

Kashmir Saivism is practically gone out of Kashmir and the North.

BVK Sastry ( ) : Any ‘Tantra – aagama’ will survive and flourish on the eco –system of a community. When external factors put a threat to spiritual exploration, siddhi- sadhana, the result is the kind of social migration you have pointed. Per se , Tantra- Aagama itself has no regional lock.

The Kamakhya in Assam seems to be the only center of Shakta activity in the country other than the South - is this accurate to say?

BVK Sastry ( ) : No. More deeper packets are there. These may have to be searched out. And what is ‘ shakta-activity’ -? Is it by the norms of ‘ drunken orgies and licentious life’ camouflaged as ‘tradition?? This model of looking for Shakta activity would be a travesty of search in Tantra and aagama ! 

In Maharashtra, and perhaps Gujarat, there could perhaps be some offshoots of the Dattatreya sampradaya. Is this reasonable to say?

BVK Sastry ( ) : yes. Datta –Sampradaya , as one of the forms of ‘ Natha –Sampradayas’ with more leaning to Shankara –Vedanta.



How about Kerala?



BVK Sastry ( ) : Less spoken better it is. Kerala had a wonderful tradition of blending ‘ Ayurveda –Vastu and Tantra’ with ‘ Upa-veda framework. The available information shows that the ‘ fruit bowl of traditions’ has become a ‘ bottled juice’ – making any source clarity to emerge.



I would appreciate any guidance in this matter.

BVK Sastry ( ) : In any case, The search to Tantra –aagama’ needs a solid eco-system of ‘ Vedic Samaj’ which seems to be fast eroding and diluting as ‘ Religion community with worldly interests prioritized than harmonizing the ‘ Purusha –Artha – Purohita’ model. There is no (Dharma-) Raja, There is no –(Vedic) purohita; only ‘Raja-purohitas’ are playing their ‘ political games’.





with kind regards

GK

BVK Sastry
