Thank you Dr Sastry



The Saura (Surya/Solar deity) tradition too, I understand, is part of the five/six principal deities in the tantra path (the other being Siva, Vishnu, Shakti/Devi, Ganapat).

BVK Sastry ( ) : Main stream ‘ Vedanta wrapper- Devataa- Pooja systems’ are not the ‘be all and end all of ‘tantra’ or ‘aagama’.

 The ‘brahmopaasanaa’ as ‘devataa’ opens up several avenues- techniques – custom guidance ( anushaasanam); these are technically the ‘tantras’ (= techniques of exploring the Brahma-Parinaama/ prakriyaa in Jagat’. The Surya / Saura – tantra is not the same as ‘ Solar worship’ where ‘solar’ is taken to be a pointer to the visible star called ‘ sun/ Helios’ providing the day-night referencing system for earth. 



But the Saura tradition in the tantra exists only in some limited pockets/communities in the northern areas' Brahmin communities today, I gather.

BVK Sastry ( ) : Explore and you will find embedded every where !



Solar worship was once a mighty tradition, and is closely associated with the Vedic path. (As an aside, Surya is also part of the Smarta tradition by way of the Panchayatana puja, if I am not wrong).

BVK Sastry ( ) : By social order change , every system of ‘ upaasanaa’ has declined or gone underground. ( ‘antarhita’- tirodhana- are some technical words to contemplate).



I wonder how it came to be considered as a part of the tantric path - or is this a wrong conclusion?.

BVK Sastry ( ) : Contemplate on Gita 11^(th) chapter : 11-12 in particular. Contemplate on how ‘solar traditions of west’ totally differ from ‘ Surya- upaasanaa as ‘ Para-brahmposanaa, vedokta -Adityopasanaa’. You may be able to find an answer.
