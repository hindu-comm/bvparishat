Sadara pranAm,

In reply to the question

How about Kerala?  

Like to supplement the answer given by Dr.SASTHRI

that there are a few groups that work hard to unearth many

vanished traditions.

For example, the group led by Girish Kumar of Iringalakuda, Thrissur, Kerala.

They could revive the procedure of MAHA YAGA, referred in the Lalitha Sahasranama.

The same group could revive the Ashta nAga worship also unique to Keralatradition.

See the website:[http://shripuram.org](http://shripuram.org/)/

Namaste.
