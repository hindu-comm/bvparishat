Namaste to all,

  

May I request members, if they get the time, to guide on the following:  

  

  

A large number of sampradaya-s in the Tantra and Agama are vanishing/have disappeared, and are now historical details.

  

But there are a few traditions that still have some adherents.

  

-   Apart from Sri Vidya, are there any other living traditions in vogue
    in the Tantra and the Agama? -   There is the Shakta tradition in Bengal, but I gather it is dying.  
-   Kashmir Saivism is practically gone out of Kashmir and the North.  
-   The Kamakhya in Assam seems to be the only center of Shakta activity
    in the country other than the South - is this accurate to say?  
-   In Maharashtra, and perhaps Gujarat, there could perhaps be some
    offshoots of the Dattatreya sampradaya. Is this reasonable to say?  
-   How about Kerala?  

  

I would appreciate any guidance in this matter.

  

with kind regards

GK
