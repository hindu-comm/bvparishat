Thank you Dr Sastry

  

The Saura (Surya/Solar deity) tradition too, I understand, is part of the five/six principal deities in the tantra path (the other being Siva, Vishnu, Shakti/Devi, Ganapat).

  

But the Saura tradition in the tantra exists only in some limited pockets/communities in the northern areas' Brahmin communities today, I gather.  

  

Solar worship was once a mighty tradition, and is closely associated with the Vedic path. (As an aside, Surya is also part of the Smarta tradition by way of the Panchayatana puja, if I am not wrong).

  

I wonder how it came to be considered as a part of the tantric path - or is this a wrong conclusion?.
