The epustakalaya website has done good work by listing works in proper way.

Although most(all?) books are hosted by [archive.org](http://archive.org) and they link to the same, but the work to present them in a far easier way is useful for those who fail to find books on [archive.org](http://archive.org) with inbuilt search tools. [archive.org](http://archive.org) listing and tools are not so good. They sometimes miss the book if you have searched a part of name or capitalized, etc.
