Namaste everyone,

  

Hindi is supposed to be my mother tongue, and it apparently is the case growing up in Bombay.

  

I am at "native" fluency, except for the curious fact that I chose to grow up as an english snob. I believe I am not the only isolated case.

  

Rather belatedly, the tide has turned post sweeping transformations courtesy yoga coming into my life in a non trivial way beyond asanas.

  

I acknowledge the disaster, and along with learning Sanskrit, I wish to elevate my Hindi or more properly termed Hindustani from "kaam chalau" or average to literary/philosophical heights.

  

At the same time, I would also like to be able to discern and use Sanskrit alternatives to Urdu/Persian where feasible.

Will this ability to discern Sanskrit versus Persian usage happen as a natural consequence of progress in learning Sanskrit ?

  

I have been told about Gita press publications as a good resource for Sanskrit influenced Hindi.

  

I am deeply interested in Indian/Hindu philosophy and psychology, and I like reading elevating literary fiction replete with cultural ethos grounded on the same.

  

If anyone would like to add appropriate advice as well as resources in the form of literature, authors, books, and online forums/YouTube media, etc, this would be very useful and appreciated.

  

Thanks,

Vishal
