Vishal ji, my two paisa, fwiw -

  

I would suggest that you go to the other extreme. Instead of trying to learn better Hindi, or Sanskritized Hindi, how about going to Sanskrit directly?

  

Saturate yourself with the Sanskrit bhasha, its vocab's roots and etymology and its vyakarana. That will kick your linguistic consciousness into a higher gear, and that in turn will automatically, without any conscious effort on your part, influence and permeate your Hindi.

  

Sanskrit being the mother of Hindi, and indeed, Indian languages as such, with increasing command of Sanskrit, you get increasing command of Hindi in the exact manner or with the exact results you want. You already are conversant with vyavaharika Hindi, you fluency being at a native level. You don't need more Hindi - you need more Sanskrit.

  

You could take a step-by-step approach or the immersion approach, like Aurobindo's method of teaching French. (He used to plunge his students directly into French literature and helped them understand the language that way.)

  

kind regards
