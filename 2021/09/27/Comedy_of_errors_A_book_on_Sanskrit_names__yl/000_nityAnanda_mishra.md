namo vaḥ  

  

I have seen bad Sanskrit name books and worse Sanskrit name books, but this has to rank the worst (to borrow and adapt from the Bard, this book has the most unkindest \[paper\] cut of all).

  

The book claims to have 7,000 Sanskrit names for girls. A look at just one page is enough: many entries are fake, not even Sanskrit words. The author has no idea of Sanskrit. Irony is this book is easily avilable in countries like Canada, where many Indian like to give a Sanskrit name to their child.

  

One of the books I plan to write (after finishing the Hindi version of Vyāsa-kathā) is the Sunāma-sāgara with 1,00,000 Sanskrit names, each name with a citation.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
