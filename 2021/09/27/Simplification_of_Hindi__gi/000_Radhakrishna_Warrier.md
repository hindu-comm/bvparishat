I have seen remarks on the internet that Hindi be simplified. It appears that the “simplification” intended by those who make these remarks is just reduction of Sanskrit tatsama words. They seem to have no problem with words of Persian or Arabic origin.

Before going into the merits or demerits of this “simplification” of Hindi, consider the following two English sentences. These sentences do not describe anything esoteric. They are about mundane, simple matters.

1.  “*This linear bilateral passive network transforms the output
    impedance of the device to the characteristic impedance of the
    transmission line*.” This sentence describes a simple matter in
    electrical engineering.
2.  “*The auto-benefactive functional domain of the middle diathesis
    includes (see Kulikov2012c: 172ff.): (i) the self-beneficent meaning
    proper*…” - just part of a sentence from a paper in the field of
    linguistics.
3.    

In the first sentence of 20 words, 9 words are of Latin origin and one word is of Greek origin. Two words are of Germanic origin, but they are not naturally evolved words; they were coined to describe what technology brought about. These are the important words in the sentence that convey the intended information. Rest are words like “this”, “the”, “of”, and “to”. The second sentence is also mostly Latin and Greek and is mostly unintelligible except to the subject matter experts.

These two sentences are examples of higher registers of English language. Any developed language must have different registers, beyond that of everyday chit-chatting, to deal with different fields of human endeavor and knowledge. For this, European languages borrowed words extensively from Latin and to a smaller extent from Classical Greek.
These borrowed words were not in everyday spoken language before they were borrowed. Common people might have found these words unintelligible and strange. Many still do. Some of these words slowly entered the common everyday “chit-chat” language and have now become familiar to many. The borrowings from Latin and Greek made English and other European languages rich and versatile.

For Hindi to become a versatile pan Indian language, it will have to borrow extensively from a pan Indian classical language. Such a pan Indian classical language is only Sanskrit. As a speaker of Malayalam, Sanskritized Hindi appears to me far simpler compared to Hindi/Urdu/Hindustani with Arabic and Persian words. This would be the case with speakers of Kannada, Telugu and even Tamil. This would also be applicable to speakers of north Indian languages like Marathi, Gujarati, Odia and Bengali. In my opinion, to become a versatile language acceptable to speakers of languages other than those of the so called “Hindi belt”, Hindi has to get Sanskritized and free itself from excessive Perso-Arabic influence.
