Crime scene - LoL. Nice turn of phrase.  

  

The circular writes 'हिंदी' instead of 'हिन्दी'. This has reference to something I experienced personally a few months back.  

  

The Hindi teachers, here in the US who teach NRI kids in my community, say that it's not good practice to 'anusvarize' the nasal when the conjunct is with a consonant of the same varga. They give examples of right usage as शङ्कर, व्यञ्जन, डण्डा, हिन्दी, बिम्ब etc. I dont have an opinion on this other than that sometimes the 'anusvarized' version looks rather strange. These teachers are generally 50+ and are from small towns in the Hindi belt. They may have enjoyed a much better standard of Hindi learning in their time than their city bred counterparts.  

  

(Note: An exception to the above is when the anusvara arises in connection with an upasarga as in संगम)

  

Whatever be the grammatical propriety, where do Hindi writers, magazines, publishers, user communities (as opposed to the government) stand on this matter. Increasingly they seem to determine the trend. I notice that Hindi magazines and websites 'anusvarize' wherever they can. There was a scene in one of the classes when a bright kid (and her parent) brought up a webpage from a TV channel or magazine and showed that the current trend was quite opposite of what they were being taught. There was some slight confusion and then one of the older teachers ruled that both forms are acceptable.  

  

In my community, there are also these paid Hindi classes. The kids there are taught only the 'anusvarized' version.  

  

Thanks,
