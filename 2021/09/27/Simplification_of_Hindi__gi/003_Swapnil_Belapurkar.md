Jai Sitaram,

  

'Simplification' is a dog whistle for de-Sanskritizing Hindi or rather 'de-Brahmanizing' Hindi. (I am quite sure the latter will be used somewhereto gather support).

  

I can read and understand Gita Press Hindi translations but have a hard time reading typical Hindu daily.

The latter has too many foreign words which makes it very difficult for me to understand.

  

Ideally, this movement to do शुद्धीकरण of Hindi \\ Hindustani should be driven by Hindus speaking Hindustani as their mother tongue.

They should be the ones rejecting these words outright and instead using Sanskrit words.

It is unfortunate that many Hindus from this region use these words such as 'tehzeeb' etc to denote some high culture.  

\[Despite शुद्धीकरणof प्रयागराज to its original name, many speakers from there continue to use अशुद्ध name that was in use till recently.\]

  

And to top it off: Center has not made any effort whatsoever to make systematic शुद्धीकरण of Hindi in last 7 years.

In fact they have made choosing these foreign languages (and अशुद्ध Hindi) lucrative. This ensures there is no incentive for शुद्ध Hindi.

  

Also this isn'tlimited to Hindi. It applies to all languages spoken by Hindus here.

Only तेलुगु I think willstill be the most Sanskritized language used by Hindus all over Desh.

  

From our end i.e. Hindus who wish to see शुद्धीकरण : we make sure to never use these अशुद्ध words in day to day conversation no matter which language. \[Hindi or Marathi or Malayalam.\]  

\[E.g. Some change we all can definitely do is : use तेलुगु पुलाव instead of अशुद्ध made-up term: बिर्यानी.\]

And adding to original post and my reply: शुद्धीकरण will have to be in bothभाषा & आचार. Which means abandoning non-veg.

\[Eg some states pride on non-veg and abhakshya habits. We will have to get rid of that.\]  

  

It will takeone generation raised on शुद्धीकरणso legacy is carried forward. We all have to start doing our bit.

  

Jai SitaRam,

Swapnil
