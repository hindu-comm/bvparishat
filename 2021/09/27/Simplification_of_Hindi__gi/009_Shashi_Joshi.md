During the manuscript era, changing each panchamAkShara with a bindu would save a lot on the writing material (paper), and nothing is lost from an information point of view. Remember, they didn't even have spaces at word boundaries! Each bindu can be easily and unambiguously mapped back to the panchamAkShara. For example [here](https://archive.org/details/YogaSutraVyakhyaPatanjlaBhashyaVivaranam4379Alm20Shlf3DevanagariYogShastra/page/n7/mode/1up).

  

The idea of ligature also seems from the desire to have one symbol for one varNa (string of consonants terminated with a vowel). Hence wherever possible, the dya, dma, hma, gra, gna, dva etc are all a single symbol.

  

  

Thanks,
