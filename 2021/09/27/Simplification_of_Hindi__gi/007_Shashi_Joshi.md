Just the dot on top - that is even seen in many Sanskrit manuscripts/books not just modern, but even from the early 20th century.

So that is kind of accepted.

But all other ligatures, removing them, loses the charm of the language.

There is a reason for all the ligatures the scribes chose to have.

If students are not taught, they will never know.

And if they are taught, it is not so very difficult that majority will not get.

  

As for govt versus the writers - websites, and even many magazines (like Sarita Mukta way back in 80s) have even replaced\| with . in sentence ending virama.
