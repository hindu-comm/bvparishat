Dear Sir,

  

Thanks a lot for this post. I am in complete agreement with you. Yes, the blind zeal in the name of simplification is ruthlessly removing, or to be more precise, has already removed numerous Sanskrit words from most of our languages. Many of these words and phrases are well rooted in our regional languages since ages and they naturally get blended with them. Removing such treasure will drastically mar the overall development of these languages. That apart, this blind act hampers the study of classics in the respective languages.Thus both the future and past of our languages are being challenged at present.

  

  

  

With regards

  

  

Ganesh
