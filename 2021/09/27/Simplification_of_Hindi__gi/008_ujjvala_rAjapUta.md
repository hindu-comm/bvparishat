This trend of 'anusvarizing' everywhere possible is as old as the oldest inscriptions in India. The other scheme of using pañcamavarṇa symbols *everywhere possible*is also fairly old. In contrast, the one where only all pada (or upasarga or samāsa) boundaries are 'anusvarized' is a very new trend in Sanskrit (and Hindi): only introduced by the colonizers two centuries back.
