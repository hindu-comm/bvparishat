We have added two new sections to the above conference which are non academic and are open to Public Intellectuals and Artists.

  

A. Panel Discussion “ Dialogues on Pluralism”

B. Panel Discussion “ Polytheist Art”

  

For those of you unable to submit a paper, these two platforms are an opportunity to present your views on Polytheism and the importance of preserving, protecting and promoting religious diversity globally.

  

Please do send your brief bio and expression of interest to Sri Edward Butler, Director for the Center for Global Polytheist & Indigenous Traditions.
