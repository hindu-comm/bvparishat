Respected Acharyas,

Humble pranams to one and all.

  

I would like to request you all to enlighten me about Sanskrit knowledge systems.

  

Is there any difference betweenSanskrit knowledge systems and Indian knowledge systems?

  

  

It will be very much helpful if anyone can share useful links or PDFs regarding Sanskrit knowledge systems.

  

  

With Pranams
