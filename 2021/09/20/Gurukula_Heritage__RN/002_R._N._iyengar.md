Dear mahAmanA shatAvadhAni Sri Ganesh,

  

When scholars of your stature find my work meaningful I can say कृतार्थोऽहं \|\| Thank you for your kind words.

How to bring in the value systems of our ancient Gurukula education into the modern institutions of learning ?

The deep and wide chasm created in the colonial period seems almost impossible to bridge. May be, widespread and sustained grassroot level

efforts will create a critical mass for the community to introspect and reinvent the ethical principles

of our Dharmic civilization, to properly guide the prevalent directionless education system.

I am flattered when you write you are *eager to hear more from me* ! Recently I talked at the Chaturmasya evening program of Sri Swamiji of Pejawara Math.

The topic was about Natural Sciences in Ancient India and what we are doing at CAHC, Jain University.
