Dear Colleague

I am sharing a general article on the Heritage of Gurukula System, published in the

Asian Journal of Professional Ethics & Management, Vol.13, no.3 July-September, 2021.

This is mainly based on my invited talk at the National Seminar "Ethics in Indian Higher Education"

on 25th June, 2021. (<https://youtu.be/BjLbd3URdB0>)

Your feedback is welcome.

Thanks

  

RN Iyengar
