Dear and respected Sir,

  

Thanks a lot for the kind reply. Your modesty educates me. And it is needless to say that I got benefited.

  

Thanks for the link to your recent talk. Just now I completed listening to it. Your observations on Natural Sciences in Ancient India are informative and the presentation is engaging as well.

  

I would like to talk to you either in person or over phone regarding your views on dating of the Vedic literature and the Mahabharata. As you have been working in the areas which are quite closer to the afore mentioned topic, I would be eager to know about your candid observations on these issues.

  

With utmost warm regards

  

  

Ganesh
