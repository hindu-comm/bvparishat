Namaste to all

  

By any chance does anyone have scanned copies of the (8 vol) series of books written by Thiru M Sundar Raj entitled *Rg Vedic Studies.*

  

I am unable to trace them from the usual digital repositories available to the general public.  

  

Would appreciate any help in this matter.

  

with thanks
