Please forgive my uncalled for advice, can't we (at least a subsection of BVP) simply Flag such attempts as inappropriate?

  

Most of the platforms (archive, fb, youtube, etc.) have this mechanism to mark the content as inappropriate with some kind of feedback. If it reaches a certain thresholdthe content is usually taken down from the platform.

  

Thanks,

Sunil
