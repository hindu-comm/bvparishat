Here is an [archive.org](http://archive.org) item (last line here) raising questions about Hinduism.

It may be desirable that some questions/issues therein are handled by those knowledgeable in this List.  

  

Once raised, questions do not, after all, die easily, even if raised by admittedly prejudiced minds - unless they are handled squarely by somebody or other, now or later; yet, the sooner they are tackled the better. Some may be answered off hand by some, and a few could be themes for projects, small or big.

  

It has for centuries been the project of Christian seminaries and other kindred institutions in India and abroad, to raise issues essentially aimed at (and indeed resulting in) undermining or detonating our religion/culture/heritage: hundreds if not thousands of pamphlets, books and tomes have been produced. And it is continuing.  

  

And so with Leftism, in its criticism of religion in general (mild), and Hinduism in particular (strong).  

  

The time has come for saying *krÌ¥te ca pratikartavyam*,  

and acting upon it.
