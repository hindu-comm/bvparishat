Dear Prof. Kannan,

  

Though the book is dated as2018-11-11, this kind of attack has been there right from the time of early evangelists in India.

  

Though the book calls itself academic , there is nothing academic about it.

  

What is new is Youtube channels like

and

  

open confrontations like

from the Hindu side

  

Because of a relatively uncomparably huge funding for the evangelical side , they started their defense and are continuing their offense.

  

This 2018 work seems to be a manual like work to come handy for the evangelical side.

  

Not to be taken academically seriously.
