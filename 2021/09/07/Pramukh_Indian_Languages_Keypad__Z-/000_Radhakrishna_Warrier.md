Is anyone here using "PramukhIME" keypad for typing in Indian languages?

  

I noticed something unusual a few days ago.

  

First, PramukhIME (online typing) stopped working on all my computers and mobile phones a few days ago. I type, and I get English, not the Indian language I choose. My two laptops and one desktop are all Windows 10. Mobile phones of my wife and mine are iPhone 10. Two days later it started working on the laptops but not on the desktop. Also, it stopped working on the iPhones.
