I would like to understand the Purusha Suktam in detail. At least the first stanza, and I would like to see the metaphor that it tries to describe. I do understand the whole sloka, but still feel there are a lot to know beyond the literal meaning. Any learned Scholar, Brahmin or Otherwise, can contribute. Pranaam!!

  

  

Jai Shree Rama
