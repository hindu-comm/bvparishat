Shri S K Ramachandra Rao, the great Vedic and Agamic scholar, wrote a detailed write up on the Purusa Suktam. The book is published by SAKSHI Trust, Bengaluru. It costs around Rs 80 or so. Link to buy:<https://vedah.com/product/purusha-sukta-mantra-s-with-meaning/>

  

Swami Amritananda of the Ramakrishna Math analyzes the Purusa Suktam according to traditional understanding in his book*Sri Rudram and Purusa Suktam*published by Advaita Ashrama . It costs less than Rs 100, I think. Link to buy:<https://shop.advaitaashrama.org/product/sri-rudram-and-purusha-suktam/>
