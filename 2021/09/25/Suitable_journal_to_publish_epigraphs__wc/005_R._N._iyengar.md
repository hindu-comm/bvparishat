1\. The Archeological Society of India (ASI) publishes PurAtattwa which is a time tested Journal on

all matters concerning ancient history. It has worldwide readership also. The HO of the society is in Qutub Enclave, N.Delhi

<https://indarchaeology.org/>  

  

2.*Journal of the Epigraphical Society of India*, used to be published from Mysore. Some of the issues are on Archive.org also.

I am not sure about its current address and activities of the Epi Society. The society was run by very famous names in Epigraphy. I hope the Society is still active. I could not get its official registered address.
