Respected scholars,

1\. Would any one of you suggest some good journal to publish a few epigraphs of stepwells?

I am not very familiar with the epigraphy discipline.

  

2\. I would also request the learned scholars to share a few good epigraphic articles to give me a framework to base my paper on, for example, what kind of information is required to be captured in the article.

  

With warm regards,
