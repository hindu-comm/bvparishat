You may try the three big volumes in Marathi written by Ahitagni Rajawade.He has referred to so many midern shastras,i.e.sciences like Embryology.

  

The third is entirely on Kamastadagre samavartatadhi.

  

You will enjoy reading provided you know Marathi very well.

  

Best of luck in your search.
