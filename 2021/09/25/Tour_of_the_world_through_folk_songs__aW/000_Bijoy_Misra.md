Friends,

We have the dramatization of a world tour through folk songs.

There would be fifteen stations, six in India.

The program will be telecast at

Lynn Noel of Boston Folksong Society will lead the tour.

I am attaching the storyline.

Kushagra Aniket of BVP will greet us at Narmada River.

People in literature, anthropology, world culture and humanity  

on the planet may enjoy.

We meet Saturday, Sept 25, 10 AM US East coast time, 7:30 PM India time.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
