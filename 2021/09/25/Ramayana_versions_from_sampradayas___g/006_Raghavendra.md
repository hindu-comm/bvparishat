श्री-सत्यधर्मतीर्थ (1798 -1830) has written a scholarly commentary on the whole of Ramayana (unfortunately the commentary on the first canto is lost) , it is was printed in Kumbhakonam way back in 1910 by the doyen of Madhva philosophy Sriyut. T R Krishnacharya and it is available in print only.

  

Mentioned must be made about the present senior pontiff of Sringeri Mutt who had preserved a copy of "Bruhad Dhaturoopaavali" ofSriyut. T R Krishnacharya from his childhood days and got print mistakes edited and reprinted in 2005 under the aegis of Sringeri research foundation.

  

The senior pontiff has commeneded the work ofSriyut. T R Krishnacharyawith the following observation which is worth recalling,

  

..."अशीतेश्शरदां प्राक् बृहद्धातुरुपावलिनामको ग्रन्थतल्लजो विद्वद्भिः कृष्णाचार्यैः निर्माय प्राकाश्यत। प्रायः प्रसिद्धानां पञ्चशताधिकानां धातूनां रूपाणि तत्र प्रादर्शिषत। तत्र तत्र प्रक्रिया अपि पाणिनीयसूत्रनिर्देशपुरस्सरं न्यरूपिषत। तत्र तत्र केषाञ्चिद्रूपाणां प्रयोग अपि काव्यनाटकादिगताः समुदधारिषत। कौमुद्यां वर्तमानान् सर्वानपि धातून् परिचाययितुं धातुकोशोपि पार्थक्येन संन्यवेश्यत। वालानां प्रौढानां च महान्तम् उपकारं जनयत्ययं ग्रन्थ इति निश्चप्रचं ब्रूमहे।।

  

Thank you & best regards,

Subject: {भारतीयविद्वत्परिषत्} Ramayana versions from sampradayas

  
  
Dear Vidvans,

  

I would appreciate it if people from sampradayas can forward their version (searchable raw preferrably and not scanned) of Valmiki Ramayana to me.

  

I am looking to collect different versions from tradition.

  

Thanks,

  

Venkat
