Dear Venkat ji,

  

International Ramayana Seminars were held in the past and the proceedings thereof are already published.

  

You may get some clue in some of the papers.

  

I faintly remember that Prof.H.H.Daniel Ingalls has brought out a small Booklet,years ago,somewhere in 1960s or so, on the Bibliography of Ramayana Studies and was published by the Ananthacharya Research Institute of Mumbai. Its first Director, Dr.K K.A.Venkatachary had given a copy to me,which is in my huge collectieon and I will require some time to locate it.

  

In the meanwhile,you can inquire with that Institute about its availability.

  

Best of luck in your search and research.

  

Prof.Siddharth Y.Wakankar.
