"In the classical Indian theories, a general definition of “art” is “whatever exceeds the literal form of an expression is ‘art’”. In this chapter, the following Indian theories of art are discussed:*theory of embellishment*which deals externally with human experiences and a much deeper*theory of suggestion*which restores*‘full word’ to human subjectivity*truncated due to*social repression*,*trauma*and the*loss of archetypal experiences*. In Indian theories, the*final frontier of art*is human beings’*experience of**harmony with nature."*
