Dear All,  
 We are delighted to announce that for the concluding two lectures in this edition of the IKS course, we will be hosting Prof. Kapil Kapoor. In his own estimate, Prof. Kapil Kapoor has been teaching for over sixty years. He is something of a legend not only among his numerous students, but also among students of Indian Knowledge Systems, of which he has been one of the pioneers in India. Generations of them have been fascinated by his lucid, invigorating and ever original expositions, as a speaker and a writer alike, of the most abstruse concepts of Indian literature, philosophy, aesthetics, languages and textual studies. Above all, he has been an unmatched champion of India’s intellectual traditions.  
 Prof. Kapoor taught for decades and held many positions in JNU and in various official bodies. He is currently Chairman, Indian Institute of Advanced Study, Shimla. He has authored important books on Indian texts, aesthetics, and intellectual traditions. More details are[on his page](https://iks.iitgn.ac.in/kapil-kapoor-2020/)on the IKS course's website.  
 Prof Kapil Kapoor’s two lectures will be: “**Panorama of India’s Knowledge Traditions**” and “**Pan-Indianness of India’s Intellectual Traditions**”. They will be in the format of a free-wheeling conversation with Michel Danino, rather than formal lectures, and will explore the complexity, richness and creativity of India’s knowledge traditions.

> **Date and time**: Wednesday July 1st &Thursday July 2nd, 3:30 to 5 > PM

> **Livestream link on YouTube**:[IITGn's YouTube > channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/IITGN1).

  
All are welcome!**Please consider forwarding this information to your interested contacts*.*  
Best regards,  
Michel & Mana
