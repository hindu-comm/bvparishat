Thank you very much Shri Ujjwal Mahodaya. I could listen to both.

Was there any spl program on AIR for Sanskrit Day (3.8.20)?

Is it possible to get the record?

Sincerely request you to pl continue this Service.

  

I have made some error last time when I reminded you of साप्ताहिकी वार्ता. I received a reprimand from Dr Nagaraj for posting my request on wrong thread. How should have I done? I apologise for any inconvenience caused to Members.
