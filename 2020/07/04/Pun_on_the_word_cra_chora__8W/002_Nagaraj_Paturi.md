K. Zvelebil, Dravidian linguistics: An introduction, 1990, p. xxii :

"The relevant passage concerning Dravidian languages occurs in KumArila's discussion of mImAmsA sUtra, I.iii.9 where he quotes five "Dravidian" words as he was aware of them in his time (7th or 8th cent., A.D.). The sUtra ordains that words borrowed from mleccha languages and used in the Veda ought to be understood in the sense they have in these mleccha languages and not to be ascribed new meanings. KumArila, speaking ironically, says that when the Aryans hear mleccha words, they add to or drop from them some sounds and make them resemble Sanskrit words. \[...\]

The words cOr and atar do not present any problem; the first is DEDR 2897 Tamil cORu (with the final non-morphemic automatic -u which is phonetically , dropped), the second DEDR 3170 Tamil atar. PAp obviously represents DEDR 4085 pAmpu (which, acc. to Burnell, South Indian paleography, p. 126) is given in some of the best mss. as pAmb. KumArila's mAl is to be connected either with DEDR 183 Tamil ammAL or it may represent a lax, fricativized and finally contracted form of Tamil makaL (DEDR 3616, cf. Malayalam mOL daughter, Kota moL id)."

Like makaL related to mAL, mOL, moL etc., in drav. languages, pAmpu is related with pAppu, poppu, etc., PoppaNa kAGkEyan of the kogku country is the patron of aTiyArkkunallAr, the famous commentator of CilappatikAram. pAppu is used for pAmpu 'snake' in CT akanAn2URu, then in pazamozi, tEvAram and so on. pAppu is common in names like pAppaiyan2, pAppaNan2 which refer to Shiva (Compare the drav. names mAyaNan, sAyaNan which refer to nAraNan(=Narayana)). This "pAppu" is what kumArila quotes as "pAp". makaL ( \> skt. mahila) occurs as mAL also in tamil (eg., vEL-mAL etc.), which to kumArila is mAl."
