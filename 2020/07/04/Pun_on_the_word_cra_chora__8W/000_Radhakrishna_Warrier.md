I faintly remember reading about a Sanskrit pun on the word cōra (चोर).
I don’t remember what that Sanskrit pun was. Also, remember faintly that the author of the pun was Kumārila Bhaṭṭa. I might be wrong. I might have read about this pun in *Aitihya M**āla*, but am not sure now. The pun was based on the Sanskrit word cōra (thief) and the Malayalam / Tamil word cōṟŭ meaning cooked rice. Does anyone know what the pun was and how it was worded? And was the author Kumārila Bhaṭṭa?

On another note, since cōra and cōṟŭ were equated, it looks like the north Indian pronunciation of cōra had already become cōr, as in the present day, by that time. In other words, mincing of the word final hrasva (short) ‘a’ was prevalent in Indo Aryan at the time of Kumārila Bhaṭṭa if he was the author of the pun. Also, that his mother tongue was either Malayalam or Tamil.
