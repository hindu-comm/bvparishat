In this context of "चोर" I recollect one episode mentioned in his lecture by Prof. Dhalphale at BORI. Audience consisted of both Marathi and Kannada speakers.

Once one person said in Marathi: कळलं न? (understood ?)

And the Kannada speakers understand this as: चोर है क्या? (Is he a thief or what?)

  

In Kannada ಕಳ್ಳ (कळ्ळ) means thief.
