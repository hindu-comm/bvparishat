Thanks Kannan Sir. Aishwaryaji, the English translation of Rasadhyaya by J. L. Masson and M. V. Patwardhan in two volumes, titled "Aesthetic Rapture" is available in [archives.org](http://archives.org). You can also refer "The aesthetic experience according to Abhinavagupta" by Raniero Gnoli, also in [archives.org](http://archives.org). There are Hindi translations of Natyashastra with Abhinavabharati commentary by Paras Nath Dwivediand Acharya Shri Madhusudan Shastri (includes a Sanskrit commentary of the author too, along with the Hindi translation). Both are available in [archives.org](http://archives.org). As mentioned by Kannan Sir, there is a translation of Nandikeshwara's Abhinayadarpana by M. Ghosh. This is published by Firma K.L. Mukhopadhyay, Calcutta, in 1957. You can find this book too in archives.
