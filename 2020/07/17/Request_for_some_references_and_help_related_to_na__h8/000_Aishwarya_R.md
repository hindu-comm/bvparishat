Namaste,

  

I am a faculty in a management school in India and am working on a research project related to the rasa nishpathi described in natyashastra and its application in management. As part of the project, I am also comparing the Indian and western schools of thought on emotions in a managerial context. I seek the following help from this knowledgeable community-  

-   I would like to connect with any scholar who is well-versed in this
    topic/researching on this topic to clarify some questions.If you can
    share your e-mail id, I will get in touch with you. -   I am looking for some good and authentic english translations of the
    natyashastra or abhinavadarpana (particularly the chapters related
    to rasas). I would be grateful if any member can put me up to some
    good sources, particularly those which are available online. -   I would also be grateful if any member can direct me to any recent
    conference or research paper published in the area of rasas.

I would be grateful for any help. My sincere thanks in advance.  

  

Regards,

Aishwarya Ramasundaram
