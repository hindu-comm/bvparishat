Dr. Shankara Rajaraman has actually worked on emotions.

He is knowledgeable in *nATya-shAstra* (even practice, if I remember
aright).

And of course, *Shatavadhani* Ganesh.

Both are in this List.

Both are expectably busy, so please check with them first.

  

Rectify the name of the text as **abhina**ya**-darpaNa.**

The translation by Ananda Coomaraswamy and Gopala Krtsnayya Duggirala  

must be available in [archive.org](http://archive.org). There must be one more translation in English.

(Ghosh perhaps).
