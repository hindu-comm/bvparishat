Thank you, Narayan Prasad Ji,

  

  Glad to know that my proposed forms are close enough. I thought of चोचूरीति along the lines of चञ्चूरीति that I have seen listed. But you are right. I also could not think of a sutra to get the दीर्घ for चोचूरीति. So, I will be happy with चोचुरीति. I remember the Paribhasha यथालक्षणमप्रयुक्ते which has been interpreted in two opposite ways in the commentaries: 1) अप्रयुक्ते शास्त्रम् अलक्षणं भवति, 2) अप्रयुक्ते यथालक्षणं शास्त्रं प्रवर्तते. I think we are following the second understanding of this Paribhasha, if we try to use a previously unattested form. Thank you once again, and with best wishes,
