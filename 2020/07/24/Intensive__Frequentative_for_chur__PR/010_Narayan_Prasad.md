\<\< सत्यम्, प्रश्नः चुरधातोः कृतः चञ्चुरीति इति चरधातोः रूपाणि दर्शितानि। नारायणप्रसादवर्येण प्रेषिते चित्रे स्पष्टं दृश्यते सः चरधातुः न तप चुर् इति।>\>

  

I don't know how my posting created confusion to scholars.

  

Prof. Deshpande's message was as follows:

"The Intensive/Frequentative forms for the root चर् are चञ्चूर्यते/चञ्चूरीति. Would the forms for the root चुर् be चोचूर्यते / चोचूरीति? Have not found any listed in the reference works so far. With best regards,"

  

In my initial reply I tried to derive his guessed verb-form चोचूरीति. But I could justify onlyचोचुरीति.

  

So I doubted the correction of the verb-form चञ्चूरीति (from चर्), quoted by Prof. Deshpande.

I gave three references to show that all these references give onlyचञ्चुरीति (and not चञ्चूरीति) from the dhAtu चर्.

  

Later he provided the reference from where he took this verb-form
चञ्चूरीति from the dhAtu चर्.

Narayan Prasad
