Respected scholars,

  

This is my first mail in this group. I would be obliged if you could share advice and/or resources to help me in studying Sanskrit in the best possible way. I am a complete novice.

  

My purpose for studying Sanskrit is to be able to study the Sad Darshanas and Bhakti shastras, specially the works of Gaudiya Vaishanava Acaryas (starting with Sat Sandarbhas of Srila Jiva Gosvami).

  

Mode of Sanskrit study would have to be self-study from prescribed books etc. or online/correspondence course from a university.

  

I am specially interested in studying Hari Namamrta Vyakaranam by Srila Jiva Gosvami, but donâ€™t know if/how it is possible, so if anyone has advice pertaining to that, kindly do share. I saw a book link given below, which is titled Hari Namamrta Vyakaranam - Learn Sanskrit through the names of Krishna, link given below.

If anyone can comment on the suitability of this book given my situation and purpose, I will be really grateful.

  

Eagerly looking forward to some actionable advice from the esteemed scholars in the group.

  

Sincerely,

  

Vineet.
