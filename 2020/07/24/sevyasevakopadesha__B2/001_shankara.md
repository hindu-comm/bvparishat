I'm a post graduate student at the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka. My major is Sanskrit. Recently I looked into finding some information about सेव्यसेवकोपदेश by क्षेमेन्द्र. I found the text of this book in the कावयमाला vol. 01. My intention is to prepare a Sinhala Translation for this book which is not available in Sri Lanka. So, I would be grateful if anyone could provide any news about this book (Translations, Bhashyas eg. ). Thank you very much!
