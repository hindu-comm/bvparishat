Abstract

"Recent research into source materials forhaṭhayoga(Birch, Mallinson, Szántó) has revealed that the physical techniques and esoteric anatomy traditionally associated with Śaiva practitioners likely found a genesis within Vajrayāna Buddhist communities. The physiology and practices for longevity described in the 11th-or-12th-centuryAmṛtasiddhiare easily traced in the development of subsequent physical yoga, but prior to the discovery of the text’s Buddhist origin, analogues to ahaṭhayogaesoteric anatomy found in Vajrayāna sources have been regarded as coincidental. This paper considers both the possibility that theAmṛtasiddhi, or a tradition related to it, had a lasting impact on practices detailed in subsequent tantric Buddhist texts and that thishaṭhayogasource text can aid in interpreting unclear passages in these texts."
