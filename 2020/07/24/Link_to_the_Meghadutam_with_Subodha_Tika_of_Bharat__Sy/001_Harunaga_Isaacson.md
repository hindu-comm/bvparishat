Quite poor quality, but a scan is attached, in the hope that it is better than nothing at least. (I can't remember how I got it; looks like a DLI scan or something similar; I could not spot it right now on [archive.org](http://archive.org).) I would be interested indeed if anyone knows of a better scan.
