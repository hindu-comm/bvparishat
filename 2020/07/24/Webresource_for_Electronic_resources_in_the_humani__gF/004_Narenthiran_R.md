Dear Prof.

  

Thanks for your feedback.

  

Sir, It is true becauseOpenEdition (OE) is a portal for online journals, books, academic publications in the humanities and social sciences.

OE is developed by the Centre for Open Electronic Publishing (Cleo), a non-profit public initiative promoting Open Access academic publishing,

with the support of the important French research institutions in and out of France.

  

Regards

Narenthiran
