**APPEAL**

  

The Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission was founded in 1897 by Swami Vivekananda with an aim to strive for the good of the world while striving to get spiritual experience. The branch centre of Ramakrishna Mission centre at Kozhikode, Kerala, called Ramakrishna Mission Sevashrama, runs a higher secondary school, a polyclinic, and an English-medium nursery school. There is a nice little temple. The school caters to underprivileged children of various religions and the polyclinic is for underprivileged patients.

  

Though over the period some buildings have been built for the school and the polyclinic, the permanent fund is negligible. Also, there is no fund for the food expenses of the sadhus living there. It costs about Rs. 1 lakh every month for the food expenses of the sadhus and the resident staff, about 15 people in total. However, because of the paucity of funds, now almost every day the sadhus share food with the school students, which is unfortunate. These sadhus have given up their hearth, home, and lucrative careers for serving the less-privileged. The least society could do is take care of their food expenses.

  

It costs Rs. 1 lakh every month for the food expenses of the sadhus. You could sponsor the food expenses of one or more months as you wish. You could also contribute to the intended permanent fund of Rs. 2 crores, interest from which would take care of the food expenses of the sadhus.

  

The donations can either be made by cheque favouring ‘Ramakrishna Mission Sevashrama’ or deposited into the following account with an email to [kozh...@rkmm.org]() mentioning the donor’s complete address and PAN and specifically stating that the donation is for the food expenses of the sadhus.
