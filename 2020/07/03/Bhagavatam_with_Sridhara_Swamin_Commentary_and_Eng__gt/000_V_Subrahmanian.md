Here is a site which gives the English translation too along with transliteration of Sridhara Samin's commentary:

  

<https://gaudiyascripture.blogspot.com/2019/10/srimad-bhagavatam-sridhar-swami-commentary.html>

  

It has so far only a part of the first canto. It says that the site is under construction.

  

Can anyone find out if the entire commentary is uploaded?

  

Thanks and regards
