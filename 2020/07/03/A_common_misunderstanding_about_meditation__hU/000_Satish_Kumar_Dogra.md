विद्युतेन प्रवर्त्यतौ

गणकः मस्तिष्कश्च उभौ

कथं मस्तिष्कं मन्दगतिम्?

कैः प्रतिरोधैः पीडितम्?

  

Both brain and computer work with electricity. Why then is the brain so much slower? What are the mental-blocks that hinder its processes?

  

From my experience with people I find that many have misunderstood Maharishi Patanjali's योगश्च चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः to mean that the stream of consciousness should be halted. In Tamil Nadu many people talk of शून्यम् which would appear to be a distortion of संयमः Thus संयमः becomes शून्यम् and शून्यम् is a state of thoughtlessness.

  

In my opinion, this is a harmful distortion of the processes described by the Maharishi and goes counter to modern psychology. Trying to achieve "thoughtlessness" in this way can create mental blocks and hinder creativity.
