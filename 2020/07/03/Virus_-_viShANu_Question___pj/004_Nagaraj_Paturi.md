The storyof Karkati certainly is a useful pointer for an allegorical style discussion about situations like viral diseases. The personification of epidemics into goddesses / demonesses and rituals to 'ward the off' or 'appease them to ward them off ' ' compensate them to ward off' etc., are common practice in Hindu folk culture in the village (mother) goddess worship.

  

There are discussions on microbiological understanding in Ayurveda , discussions on microorganisms being pathogens etc., most of these mention Kanva maharshi's contributions to this field and mention of these aspects in Atharva Veda.

  

But whether virus, the non-living entity that is a pathogen and multiplies itself with the help of the host , is discussed or not is not clear.

  

Ayurveda experts on the list might be able to help in that regard.
