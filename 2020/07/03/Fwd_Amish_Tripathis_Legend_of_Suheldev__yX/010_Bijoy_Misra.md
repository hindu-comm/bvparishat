Dear friends,

It may not be proper to use this forum to discuss what Indic Academy does or does not do.

Here we have individuals from various institutions scattered in different disciplines. I would

think a discussion should be topic oriented than why an institution conducts itself in some

manner. Discussion on institutions should be on moderation as a part of BVP. No person  

in the forum should be assumed to represent any institution besides being a scholar member  

of BVP.

So is my thought.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
