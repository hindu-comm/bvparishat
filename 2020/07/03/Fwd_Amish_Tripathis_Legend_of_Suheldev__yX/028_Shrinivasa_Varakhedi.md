I fully endorse the opinion of Sri Yogananda ji. We can not use a forum for individual fighting. We welcome an academic debate. But allegations if made are to be addressed in a separate forum where they got triggered. BVP is not interested.

  

We also equally condemn the personal attacks on individuals or institutions or groups. We can express our concerns and disagreements with them.

  

Regards

SV
