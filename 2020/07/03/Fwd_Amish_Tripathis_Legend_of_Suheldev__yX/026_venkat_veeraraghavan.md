Dear Dr. Kannan:

  

I only quoted that to illustrate that the young grow in perspective with experience --as C. Castaneda put it the elders teach a child to "see" the world in a particular way that becomes both a blessing and eventually a curse in terms of the cage of consensual reality.

Shri Paturi Garu:-

What we are fighting for or against is a mindset and not so much the people.

Once this differentiation is made, it will be easier to meet and greet without rancour across the political divide (and sometimes within).

The mindset is a greater prison which is why Roger Bannister is still feted for breaking the 4 minute barrier of the mile. Hundreds have broken it since. But RB was the first to break the mindset.

You must have heard and seen the videos of people hiding pornography in Disney cartoons. The problem is that the mind absorbs more than we realise and this contributes to the spaghetti of confusion that we have to deal with. I do not know if the "illuminati" is really behind all this but the evidence of subliminalmessaging is there.

  

We just haveto be extra careful.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
