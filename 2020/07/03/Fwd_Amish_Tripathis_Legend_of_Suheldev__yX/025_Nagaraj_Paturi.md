Thanks Prof. Kannan, Sri Venkat and Dr Galstian for your kind words.

  

I had to mention my role as moderator and keeping away from it at least temporarily, on account of my thought that my responses in thread as an office bearer of Indic Academy and my role as the moderator of the list may get in conflict with each other.

  

Sri Venkat-ji,

  

\> not send mixed messages for those who may not have the perspicacity to see the difference.

  

--- messages are already bombardingall including children, sir !. They are already not only mixed but are confounding. Perspicacity is the need of the hour for all including children. If it is not there , it needs to be urgently provided /inculcated.

  

Instead of cheecheeing the topic which makes the children even more curious and get trapped into the disinformation and misinformation from the left liberal dominated LGBTQI activism, academics and media communication, it is better to train them in critical reception all over the world in general and in the case of Bhaarateeya audience particularly Bhaarateeya children understand the Bharat-related material in this area from a Bhaarateeya perspective.

  

\> The LGBTQ narrative in the US has been firmly hijacked by the political left and since we import most of our "culture" from the US, Shrivatsa ji has some very valid worries.

  

----- That is IA's worry too , Sri Venkat-ji.

  

Oversexualization/ hypersexualization of the discussions on non-binary gender is another aspect that IA too is fighting against.

  

A learned member of an IA on an IA forum expressed concerns about children in his own and in his relatives' families using expressions like I am 20% male and 80% female today (and tomorrow ?) etc.

  

All this looks more nuanced, intricate and hence more advanced stuff to the new age youngsters and they are taking pride in being able to grasp such complex ideas. That very attraction for intricate understanding among the youngsters of this generation needs to be used to help them acquire, what you call 'perspicacity ' from Indic roots.
