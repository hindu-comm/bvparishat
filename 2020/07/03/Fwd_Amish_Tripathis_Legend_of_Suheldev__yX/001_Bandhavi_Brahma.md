Pranam to all scholars,

  

Since many may not have actually read books by author Amish Tripathi, I wish to place some excerpt from his book before you.  
  
Although the Indic book club wants to project Amish Tripathi as  

  
"*The First step in this revival was the retelling of Indian Itihasa-Puranas. The second step is the retelling of Indian historical accounts through traditional narratives and perspectives. So far, Shri. Amish Tripathi was one of the flag-bearers of the former and most successful"  
*  

my experience from raeding his books is different. As most authors, his hope is for popularity and high sales of his books, that's all.  
  
To quote: "In the story a Deshastha Brahmin named Jayadratha, rapes 4 women and kills his sister for trying to elope with a Chamar. The Chamar's father, named Arjuna, beheads the Brahmins and places his head on his father's lap in the end."  
  
If anyone interested in more details, it can be seen in this thread -<https://twitter.com/kryocken/status/1195975331796045824>

I think, there are several scholars in this forum belonging to Deshastha brahmin lineage. All are welcome to form their own opinion and judgement.  
  
Namaskar,

Bandhavi
