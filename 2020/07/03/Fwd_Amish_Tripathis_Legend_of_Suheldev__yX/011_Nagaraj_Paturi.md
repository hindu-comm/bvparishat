Dear Prof. Misra,

  

This forum allowed post's telling us what was being done at Boston by a certain association etc.

  

There is certainly a problem in the present case.

  

It is not discussing what an organization does.

  

The members or the office bearers of the organization are not the ones who brought what the organization does for discussion. Whenwhat the organization does was brought for discussion , the members of the organization, if present in the forum, along with other members, do and can respond. In the present case, the founder of the organization responded.

  

The problem in the present case is the conflict of interest in the posts by Nagaraj Paturi.

  

He wanted to avoid this and requested the owners of the list to, at least temporarily , to allow him to move out of the moderation -role.

  

It was certainly hasty on his part not to have waited until that request was allowed by the owners.

  

He is appologizing profusely to the list for this haste .

  

Apart from that, the discussion about what an organization does, as long as it is within the scope of the forum, is well in order.

  

I desist from any further post on this thread as long as I don't move out of the moderation-role.

  

Other members of IA or other members of the list can continue discuss the topic(s) of the thread following etiquette and other norms.

  

Appologizing again,

  

Nagaraj
