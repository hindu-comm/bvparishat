Dr. Paturi,

  

Your observations are welcome only if you rein in the wayward members of your organization whose empty threats I have shown you. Else it is just your posture against someone who cannot affect you in any way (as against a member of your clique to whom you seek to give a clean chit).

  

And no, the ordinary Hindu is in no mood to promote hypersexualizing his children. Only that the "reformers" are ill at ease with it. Examples attached.

  

Annoyed regards,

Shrivathsa. B.
