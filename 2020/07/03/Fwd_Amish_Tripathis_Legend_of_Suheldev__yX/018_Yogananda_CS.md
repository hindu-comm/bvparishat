Namaste Suren ji,

  

Very strong words are frequently used in this forum for / against members of BVP and others, but as far as I know, a person becomes a member of BVP for purposes of exchange of ideas, learning from others and such noble objectives. Your statement - I had requested Shri Nagaraj to add me to this group since allegations have been made against me. - is a new \`purpose' for joining. If only your mail - the first to BVP - had stopped at the third para (\`However, if the person who has made theseallegations wishes to have my defense on this forum, I am glad to reply to any charges levelled at me and I shall defend myself here.'), it would have appeared as constructive and a wish for scholarly engagement. The last para is in bad taste.

  

I am sorry that you havebeen the recipientof abuse on social media, but such is the lot of persons who would like to be vocal about issues they believe in.

  

regards........yoga
