Dear SriShrivathsava

  

You have been continuouslyabusing both me personally as well as Indic Academy in public fora. I am currently refraining from responding to them as it will only sidestep the issues you seem to have with me and IA.From your earlier tweets you seem to be primarily concernedwith :

  

a\. The conference we did for Hindu Traditions on Sex, Gender and Sexuality

b\. Our promotion of Amish Tripathi

  

I request you to please watch this video carefully<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnt52tbzzA0> . It outlines the process we have established for any person who is concerned with any of our actions. Pleasefollow this process and we are happy to submit ourselves to the ruling of the panel and given an undertaking upfront that we will abide by the same.

  

Please also note I will not be replying to any response that does not follow the process mentioned above.

  

On a side note we have also announced a **Research Scholarship on Bharatiya Tradition of Creative Liberty in Literature.** ( <https://www.indictoday.com/announcements/history-bharatiya-tradition-creative-liberty-literature/>). Once we shortlist a candidate you can surely engage with him or her and give your inputs. (If you consider yourself qualifiedand have the time, you could also participate in the Fellowship). This announcement is a direct result of your abusive comments. We are therefore grateful to you for the same and also take this opportunity to showcase this to the august mail group as an example of the value we at Indic Academy give to the importance of research and action beyond emails and social media discussions.

  

As far as the short notice for the open house is concerned, I am sorry that you could not participate. I am now considering holding such open house events once in a quarter and you could always participate in the next one. Do follow our handle for updates in this regard. Incidentally there is another event on the topic of creativeliberty coming up on the 26th being organised by another institution and I will check with them to see if you too can participate. Since it is not an IA event I cannot promise you but let me try.



I do not check the mails in this group and have come here only when your mail was brought to my notice. I will not be coming back again, so please therefore write to me at [ha...@indica.org.in](), if you choose to follow the process outlined in the video above.I also do not believe in email debates that do not result in resolution or action -be it a research paper, article, book, event, product, service or experience.

  

Look forward to an early resolution of all the issues that seem to be troubling you meanwhile, may bhagwan bless you with a peaceful disposition.

  

  

Hari Kiran

  

*Ps :Through this mail I also appeal to the moderators to observe this correspondence and try and ensure that there is no abuse so as to maintain the sanctity of this group that has several venerable scholars as its members.*
