हरिः ॐ,

  

Amish and his backers viz. the indic acad i.e. indic Thekedaars got a nice smacking on Twitter for brazenly supporting the "fiction" that Mr. Amish writes. The indic acad announced an "open-house" by their head and it was announced about an hour before the event (will be happy to know if I am wrong about their announcement being hasty and it will be a small reassurance that everything may not be lost).

  

People who don't read our epics and have zero respect for them will definitely write words to the effect of

"Bharata (Rama's brother) = womanizer"

  

in the name of freedom of expression. Given this, Amish tarring Deshastha or some other community shouldn't be surprising.

  

They have published another article today which is full of hot air about how great a writer amish is.

  

I pray to bhagavaan that the "indic" mentally-obese academy soon disintegrate. Some of their members have the nuance of street lumpens and throw Twitter threats with abandon!

  

Yours in shared pain,

Shrivathsa. B
