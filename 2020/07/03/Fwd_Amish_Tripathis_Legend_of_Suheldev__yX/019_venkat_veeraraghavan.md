Dear Smt Bandhavi ji:

  

Amish has written Lord Shiva as some sex starved tribal. What you have shown is par for the course.

More nuance than this cannot be expected since the baseline was set long ago.

  

The author seems some sort of savvy capitalist milking the current zeitgeist of revivalism.

That in itself would not hurt if it was done with more class.

  

Shri Paturi Garu--> You have done an excellent job as moderator and you have given a nuanced and balanced response to Shri Shrivatsa's angst filled post.

Dr. Kannan has written most of what I feel about this, so much so I feel he is channeling me these days :).

  

There is however a need to see beyond the harshness in Shri Shrivatsa's post. While it is good to be clean, it is also good to be clear from civilisational foes like these so as to not send mixed messages for those who may not have the perspicacity to see the difference.

The LGBTQ narrative in the US has been firmly hijacked by the political left and since we import most of our "culture" from the US, Shrivatsa ji has some very valid worries. The oversexualisation and the pride parades are a problem since the foisting of a fringe mindset /orientation on the majority and normalising notions like gender fluidity is a rabbit hole India can well do without.

  

To paraphrase Albus Dumbledore "It takes even greater courage to stand up to our friends" (HPATSS)

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
