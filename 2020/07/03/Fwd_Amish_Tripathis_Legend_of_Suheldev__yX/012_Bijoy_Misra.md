Prof Paturi,

You have been excellent in your moderator's role.

I guess putting a public service announcement for  

participation is one thing, but discussion of the organization

is another. I thought Mr Srivatsa was challenging the  

the conduct of Indic Academy etc and I felt this was not the forum.

It's like people challenge Harvard for whatever reason

and I have to bypass. I head India Discovery Center,

but I don't participate in BVP in that capacity.  

So is my thought.

On a general note, I would say that Indic Academy is well

positioned in its mission. I attend Prof Korada's classes and  

enjoy them.  

Best regards,

BM
