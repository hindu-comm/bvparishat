My Namaskarams to the esteemed members of this group.

I am a part of Indic Academy and have been among the triggers around which this discussion came about. My apologies to all the scholars here who have had to endure exchanges that may not be germane to the purpose of the group.

  

I had requested Shri Nagaraj to add me to this group since allegations have been made against me. Those allegations of misconduct are outside this group, do not deal with Indic Academy in any way and are to be addressed to me personally.

  

However, if the person who has made theseallegations wishes to have my defense on this forum, I am glad to reply to any charges levelled at me and I shall defend myself here.

  

If not, he is requested to refrain from making any references to me on this forum. Any further correspondence on this matter will be utilized by me in the event I decide to take this matter forward through litigation.

  

Thanks and Apologies again for the disturbance

  

Suren
