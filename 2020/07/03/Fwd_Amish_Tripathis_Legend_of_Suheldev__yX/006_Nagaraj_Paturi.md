Dear Shrivathsa-ji,

  

Your expressions in your post below such as

  

" viz. the indic acad i.e. indic Thekedaars got a nice smacking on Twitter "  

  

and curses such as

  

" I pray to bhagavaan that the "indic" mentally-obese academy soon disintegrate "

  

ill behoves learned members like you.

  

Earlier too you used expressions such as Indic Academy low lives etc.

  

Such verbal rashness does not serve any purpose than getting the same back.

  

Whom you call intellectually obese can attribute intellectual malnutrition to you.

  

This does not lead anyone anywhere.

  

There is a lot of anti-Indic activity of misinterpretation, misrepresentation and manipulation being done in the area of diversity of gender and sexual orientation. One can not wish away all this by keeping away from that topic.

  

Our children can be saved from the unhealthy influences of the unhealthy activism in this area only by our active counter-activism and counter -representation in that area not by shutting our children's eyes from all this new age stuff which is in fact impossible in this era of multidirectional information bombarding.

  

None of us is a thekedar of Civilization.

  

Indic Academy never claimed itself to be or behaved as the 'thekedar' (one and only savior, if that is what you mean by that word to you threw on it) of Indic.

  

Pro-Indic activity into which Indic Academy entered just a few years ago is older, larger, widespread , variegated and sometimes in some specific aspects is conflict-rich. Indic Academy is fully aware of this. Why, even within Indic Academy itself, there is a very rich diversity of positions with regard to several issues. Pro-Indic individuals and organizations come together and work together on issue to issue basis. Members of IA too, work as Indic Academy on the basis of some broad agreement while retaining their individualities in tact, to themselves. Absence of a herdish unity is the beauty of all this.

  

But no disagreement should be expressed through such unnecessary verbal rashness as exemplified above.

  

Your gentle response to Sri Hari Kiran's grace indicates course correction.

  

Hope we will all be able to continue with such grace and gentleness.

  

Warm regards as ever,

  

Nagaraj
