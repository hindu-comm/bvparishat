hariH OM,

Harikiran garu,

  

I have never abused you. I have severely criticised your organisation for promoting anti civilizational movements. But a member of your group has tried in vain to threaten me and I have called him out many times. I don't know if you took it as a reference to you. There was also a time when I thought the person who gave the threat to be a "founding" member of your academy. Hence there may be confusion created by my indirect references. Pl see attachment.

  

Be that as it may, you have shown the grace in your mail that is absent in many of your members.

  

I am also heartened to know that the protests of ordinary Hindus who want to protect their civilization has reached you and you have decided to think of course correction.

  

We, the ordinary hindus on twitter will think of engaging with the person you have appointed to reach out to our sorts. We welcome your move.

  

The following needs to be told again - As long as your organization keeps away from civilizational enemies of Hindus, we (the simple hindus) will be your friends. We have no other bone to pick with you as long as you serve the real interests of our civilization. Please advise your members to observe the hallmark of our civilization viz. humility. The white man has "borne" our "burden" enough. We don't want your members "civilizing" us by teaching us about 21 genders and so on.

  

स्वस्ति,

   भवानीभारती विजयतेतमाम्,

                     श्रीवत्सः
