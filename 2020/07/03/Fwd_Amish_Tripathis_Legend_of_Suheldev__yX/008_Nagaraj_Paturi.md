Dear Sri Shrivathsa-ji,

  

\> Your observations are welcome only if you rein in the wayward members of your organization whose empty threats I have shown you.

  

Whether it is a member of Indic Academy or any other individual, if the threat given by such a person is empty, there is no need to take such a threat seriously.

  

Yes, the act of giving threats whether empty or real, is not good manners in general. Indic Academy does not encourage its members resorting to such behaviour.

  

But I think it is not wrong on the part of IA to allow its members to confront misrepresentations and abuses towards IA head on if necessary by mentioning lawful consequences such as legal action against such abusers.

  

IA does not give clean chit to any IA member if the behaviour is not part of such justfiableIA related correspondence or conversation. 

  

If any IA member resorts to any unjustifiable behaviour not as part of such IA related activity, but as part of his own personal activity for his own personal reasons IA can not take responsibility for that behaviour of such an IA member.

\> And no, the ordinary Hindu is in no mood to promote hypersexualizing his children.

  

------ IA is also in no mood to promote hypersexualizing any children.

  

You may remember that in an earlier thread on this topic too , I agreed with your observation that there is an actual aspect of oversexualization in the present discussion and activism around non-binary gender and sexual orientations that are dominated by the activists from HInduphobic faiths and ideologies. You may remember that on more than one occasion I agreed with your observation that there indeed is an unhealthy influence on children from the bombarding information from the present discussion and activism that is dominated, funded and promoted by left liberal ideologies, breaking India forces and Hinduphobic faiths.That is one of the reasons why IA finds it necessary for it to enter into this space and counter these awkward and
unhealthy developments in this space.

  

The images and documents shared by you in the post below do not at all belong to IA's activity in this space.

  

Nazariya (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazariya>)'s event in a school , the image of a breast feeding bearded person (<https://sxpolitics.org/political-mythology-on-abortion-and-trans-men/18439>), the gender fluidity meme that you shared from twitter none of these things have anything to do with IA's work in this area.

  

Shutting the eyes of children to this information being bombarded on them from all sides in this new age ambience does not help. We need to train children all over the world to receive all this information critically and train Indic children in particular with an understanding well rooted in the Indic cultural and traditional complex with regard to these aspects.

  

The Indic spiritually rooted transgenderism is getting despiritualized in representation and practice. Spiritual transgenders are being made to get misunderstood. The appearantaspects Indian traditional images and expressions are being interpreted to be reduced to the universalized nonspiritualgender and sex categorizations. Awareness in Ayurveda and traditional Indic literature about complex sex orientations are suffering from either lack of representation or misrepresentation. Spiritually rooted voluntary sexual disorientations and Indic wellness solutions for the involuntary sexual disorientations are not finding place in this oversexulized discussion. Traditional Indian accommodation and inclusion of the gender diversities as part of customs and traditions are not getting highlighted in the universalized victimhood dominated narrative in this space. This list can go on.

  

Given all these lacunae from Indic perspective in the present discussions and activism can be countered only by facing it head on and claiming our space, countering the misrepresentations and fighting for representations.

  

Healthy and constructive critical observations about IA's activities are taken in their right spirit and IA is open to course correction wherever necessary.  

  

If IA's activity with this objective is repeatedly misrepresented and abused by conflating its activity with exactly what it is opposing, IA has the ability to fight such misrepresentations and abuses too.  

  

Warm regards as ever,
