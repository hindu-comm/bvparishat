Hinduism has never, I believe, cruelly treated the non-straight community

\- such as has been the legacy of some religions demanding they be killed etc.

There has all along been an unwritten law of sorts - of not discussing much  

in public on these issues, as there have been on several others.  

Such people among them who had genetic issues, or even psychological ones,  

would promptly go to the vaidya and try some medication.

  

But the crazy West takes things to extremes, and we see an era of flaunting and glorifying  

one's non-straightness - to the extent, in fact, of making normal people almost feel guilty,

and bordering on making the non-straightness almost the new norm. This aggressiveness

and unlimited propaganda seems to have the sole object of offending the sensibilities of even  

the well-informed and fairly tolerant. The picture provided by Srivatsa-ji,  

already in wide circulation by the time he had sent it, is horrendous,  

and it is not difficult to imagine how adversely it will all affect the younger generation.

And as they grow up, they may be fit candidates for psychiatric treatment

in the avalanche of confusion it has begun to lead all to. This is no small problem, then.

  

At the same time, it is also makes little sense to close our eyes to the problem and its consequences ,  

already assuming an alarming proportion. This needs to be squarely handled,  

and some methods must be devised to stop further misinformation and disinformation

\- in respect especially of the position of the Hindu heritage regarding the issue.  

One cannot but appreciate the concerns raised by Prof. Paturi in this regard.  

No more can we afford to close our eyes on these issues.

  

The discussions and developments in this regard can be quite confusing, and may

urge people to take some strong positions. Nevertheless, these should not have any impact upon  

the role of BVP in regard to issues related to Sanskrit and its heritage. In this connection,

it would be highly desirable for the owners of BVP to come out with some clear policy statements.

The bye-laws of an institution grow and evolve in the wake, after all,  

of controversies and attendant confabulations.

  

I, for one, strongly believe that Prof. Paturi has been serving excellently as a moderator.

A great conciliator that he is, he is able to handle warring scholars with ease, driving sense

and providing models of handling tricky issues with dignity and poise.

  

It would be most unfortunate if his exit is precipitated, especially against the background of

a raging controversy which has multiple facets each of which can be vigorously argued.

I appeal to the members to persuade the owners not to accept the temporary or permanent suspension,  

even if proposed by Prof. Paturi himself, of his very valuable role as an able and worthy moderator.  

Prof. Paturi is knowledgeable and versatile, and his ability to handle people of

varied temperaments and idiosyncrasies has very well been borne out in the past several years.

I say all these as but a well-wisher of BVP.
