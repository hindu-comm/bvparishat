Dear friends,

Good morning.  

The exploration of Sanskrit brought before me the scientific question of  

formation of a word. This leads to appreciating the cognitive nature of a

word as a neurological process in the human brain. Analytically it comes  

to the formulation of the acoustic signal from the mental cognition.  

Some of our work is summarized in the youtube video I posted last year.

We are continuing with a virtual video presentation on the western theories

on cognition. The free seminar is scheduled Saturday, July 11 at 9:30 AM.

You can register by sending an email to [idcin...@gmail.com]() .

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
