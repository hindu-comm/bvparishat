Namaste

  

My welcome verse to Rafale fighter jets to Bharatam.  

  
**"रफेल"-व्योम-यान! त्वं वह्निं वैरिषु वर्षितुम्।  
चण्डवातवदायाहि** **वायुसेना-विभूषण॥**  
  
*Come oh! Rafale Plane! like the fierce wind, to shower fire on enemies. Indeed you are a jewel of Air force.*  
  

(Web based dictionaries suggest that Rafale (in french) means continuous fire, fierce wind)  

  

regards

Jayaraman
