Respected Scholars,

                kindly help me by giving an information whether there is any write-up about Shovakar Mishra, a Sanskrit
rhetorician probably of 13th century, in any Journal like Indian Antiquary, Epigraphia Indica. Journalo Asiatic Societyof Bengal etc. Also I have got one manuscript of his book 'Alamkara Ratnakara' from [archive.org](http://archive.org) but it is too difficult to discern it properly because of its indistinctness. Is there any printed version of this book available ? If so kindly give me the information.

              With regards,

  

                                   
      Miss S.Sinha.
