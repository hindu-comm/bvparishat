Dear Krishnaprasad-ji,

  

Please accept my heartfelt gratitude. These fonts, doubtless, will adorn Sanskrit books all over the world in the years to come. Every lover of language is indebted to your perfect aesthetic sense and selfless service. May the glimmer in our eyes collectively render aglow the path of your future endeavours.

  

भूयिष्ठां ते नम उक्तिं विधेम।

  

Best regards,

Shashi Kiran B N
