I agree with Professor Paturi. The importance of Sanskrit for humankind is immense. Wings come and go depending on societal inclinations, but Sanskrit must remain an international treasure and be actively studied, spoken, and sung. This isn't about politics or gimmicks, it's about becoming fully aware of what is it to live a human life.
