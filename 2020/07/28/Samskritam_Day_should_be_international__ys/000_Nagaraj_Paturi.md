Namaste,

  

Most Respected Scholars,

  

I'm just literally no one to express my opinions. I'm not eligible in any way to share my thoughts around these things.

  

However, my inclination to Samskritam and right wing at large makes me think so. If this doesn't deserve a response, kindly forget & forgive me for being ignorant & arrogant simultaneously.

  

**Left wing 'scholars' have only one truth - To destroy Bhārata.**

**  
**

**Right wing scholars have their own versions of truth; hence, each one is trying to find one ultimate truth by debate & discussion, that can eventually build Bhārata. Well, this is legitimate, but, not the need of the hour.Right wing doesn't have time.**

**  
**

**Let's BUILD COUNTRY FIRST & then sort out The Truth.**

**  
**

I'm deeply saddened by the way SAMSKRITAM DAY is being celebrated. It's literally such a sad thing, that, SAMSKRITAM DAY hasn't gone international yet. Can we believe?

  

I think all scholars here have to come together to celebrate SAMSKRITAM DAY at an INTERNATIONAL LEVEL by 2021.

  

Sorry, for unsolicited advice.

  

Jai Hind
