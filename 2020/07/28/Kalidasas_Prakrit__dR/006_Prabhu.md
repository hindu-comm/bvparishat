Very interesting topic Warrier-ji!

  

Recently I was reading madhyamavyAyoga.

  

In the play only hiDimbA and brAhmaNI speak in prAkR^it.

I did not expect brAhmaNI to be speaking in prAkR^it when the rest of her family (all males, though) speaks sanskR^it.

  

I have attached a couple of prAkR^it sentences from the play.

  

I wonder if there is a difference between the prAkR^it of bhAsa and that of kAlidAsa or... in literary works a "canonical" prAkR^it is employed.

  

Thanks

Prabhu
