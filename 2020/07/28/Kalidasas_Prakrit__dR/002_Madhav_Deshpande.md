Dear Radhakrishna Ji,

  

  You have asked an interesting question. The Prakrit line that you have cited \[“ठाणे खु सज्जिदि दिट्ठी। इमिणा अंगुलीअएण उब्भिण्णकिरणकेसरेण कुसुमिदो विअ दे अग्गहत्थो पडिभादि।“\] is close enough to what we know as the Śaurasenī Prakrit, and so it is not completely made up. However, it is difficult tosay with confidence that Kālidāsa is providing Prakrits contemporary to him or from his region. Beginning with the Nāṭyaśāstra, there are instructions about which characters should be depicted as speaking which kind of Prakrit, and the Sanskrit poets and dramatists are following some literary conventions. Were these Prakrits incomprehensible to Kālidāsa's audiences? Probably not, since these are close to Prakrits we know from other texts, grammars and inscriptions, and so I would assume that these were comprehensible. However, literary Prakrits as seen for instance in Bhabhūti's Mālatimādhava using very long compounds are literary extensions of what might have been colloquially spoken Prakrits. Many of these long Prakrit compounds are probably formed originally in Sanskrit in the mind of the poet and then rendered into Prakrit. Some good evidence that Prakrit poets were occasionally rendering long Sanskrit passages into Prakrit comes from some literary works in medieval Pali from Sri Lanka. A text called Hatthavana-Vihāra-Vaṃsa, describing the history of the Hatthavanamonastery renders several passages from Bāṇa's Kādambarī into Sanskrit. It is clear that literary Prakrit was cultivated in India along with literary Sanskrit, and hence some mutual give and take occurs in these literary forms. This is somewhat like the Marathi used in Jñāneśvara's commentary Jñāneśvarī on the Bhagavadgītā. The language is an interesting literary mixture of pure Prakrit words with pure unchanged Sanskrit words. For Jñāneśvara, both languages are part of his poetic repertoire and he is comfortable in using Sanskrit words next to Prakrit words:

   आतां विश्वात्मके देवे । येणे वाग्यज्ञे तोषावे । तोषोनि मज द्यावे । पसायदान हे।।  

The main difference in the use of literary Prakrits in Sanskrit works and in Prakrit poetic works is that the Sanskrit vocabulary, including long compounds, is dutifully rendered into Prakrit phonology, unlike what we see in the use of Jñāneśvara. These are some of my impressions. With best wishes,
