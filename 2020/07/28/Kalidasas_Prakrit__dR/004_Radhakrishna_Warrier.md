Thank you Prof. Deshpande ji. Literary conventions sometimes make it difficult to get information on language and social conditions from pre-modern literature. In this context, I remember some persons saying that PNG (person, number, and gender) suffixes were prevalent in spoken Malayalam as late as the 16^(th) century CE based on their use in Malayalam Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇam by Tuñcattŭ Rāmānujan Eẓuttacchan. PNG suffixes look like adding a contracted form of the pronoun to the verb:
something like he did-he, she did-she, I did-I, etc., where the suffix is a contracted form of the subject pronoun. This exists in Tamil but does not exist in Malayalam. I believe it didn’t exist in Malayalam for at least two thousand years. But literary conventions being what they are, pre-modern poets sometimes resorted to PNG suffixes, most probably for meeting the requirements of vṛtta, prāsa etc. If they used one PNG suffix for these aforementioned reasons, they would have used fifty non-PNG suffixed verbs before! Eẓuttacchan used mostly non-PNG-suffixed verbs resorting to PNG only very rarely. Drawing the conclusion that the PNG suffixes were used in common spoken language based on their use in Eẓuttacchan's poetry appeared hilarious to me. PNG suffixes are still used (though very rarely) by some modern poets where the poet thinks these might prove useful to meet the requirements of meter, alliteration etc .
