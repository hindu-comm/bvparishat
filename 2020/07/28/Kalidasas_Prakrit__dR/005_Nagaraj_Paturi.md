\> PNG suffixes look like adding a contracted form of the pronoun to the verb:something like he did-he, she did-she, I did-I, etc., where the suffix is a contracted form of the subject pronoun.

  

---- This is a typically Dravidian periphrastic verb structure found in the case of some tense forms in the older classical versions of these languages.

  

When they were Noun/pronoun+ pp (past participle) of the verb+pronoun form,  


they weretaken as part of the nominal predication in the equational sentences (NP + NP), characteristic of the Dravidian.

  

Thus they were taken as Noun Phrases, and not as verbs.
