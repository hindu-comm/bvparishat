I had to study Māḷavikāgnimitram (Malayalam translation) in my Pre-Degree Malayalam classes. Just found another Malayalam translation by A.R. Raja Raja Varma. <https://archive.org/details/Malavikagnimitram_of_Kalidasa_Malayalam_Translation/mode/2up?q=%E0%B4%97>

This provides the original Sanskrit as well. The original Sanskrit also includes the Prakrit spoken by some characters, especially females. In the first act (aṅkam) of the drama, in the introductory scene (viṣkambham), Bakulāvalikā says in Prakrit:



“ठाणे खु सज्जिदि दिट्ठी। इमिणा अंगुलीअएण उब्भिण्णकिरणकेसरेण कुसुमिदो विअ दे अग्गहत्थो पडिभादि।“



Its Sanskrit and Malayalam translations, as given in the book, are as follows:



“स्थाने खलु सज्जति दृष्टिः अनेनांगुलीयकेनोद्भिन्न किरणकेसरेण कुसुमित इवतेऽग्रहस्तः प्रतिभाति।



“കുറ്റമല്ല നീയിത്ര സൂക്ഷിച്ചു നോക്കിയത്. ഈ തിരുവാഴിയിലെ കല്ലുകളുടെ പളപളപ്പുകൊണ്ടു നിന്റെ ഉള്ളംകൈ പുഷ്പിച്ചതുപോലെ തോന്നുന്നു.”



Here is my own English translation which is far from perfect:

“It is no fault of yours that you looked at it carefully. The glowing rays of the gems in this signet ring makes your palms look as if they have flowered.”



My question is this: Is this a Prakrit that was spoken during Kalidasa’s time? Or did Kalidasa generate this Prakrit from Sanskrit through a formula? If it was a spoken Prakrit, is it possible to find out in what period of time and in what part of India was it spoken?
