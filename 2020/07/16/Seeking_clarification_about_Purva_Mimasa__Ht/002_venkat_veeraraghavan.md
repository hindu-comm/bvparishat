Dear Shri Srivatsan ji,

  

What is popular is not always shastric in the strict sense of the word and represents a cutting of corners in the spirit of "svalpamasya dharmasya trAyate...".

  

Over the last 1000 years with the gradual decline of kshatriya kulas and withdrawal of the protection and patronage that they offered to Brahmana kulas, Brahmanas have been forced to actively seek artha(wealth) in society. This places a constraint on the extent to which karma-anushthana can be carried out.

  

Usually in the context of loka-sangraha, it is easier to use naama sankeertana and the kritis of the trinity to draw people into the fold of Bhakti as opposed to the path of karmaanushthana. Considering that among dvijas only the Brahmanas and of those only a few have maintained an unbroken regimen of nityakarma, it is not surprising that naamasankeertana is pushed as an alternative.

  

The other thing is that verses like these from the BG (2.43)

  

यामिमां पुष्पितां वाचं प्रवदन्त्यविपश्चितः ।

वेदवादरताः पार्थ नान्यदस्तीति वादिनः ॥ ४२ ॥

कामात्मानः स्वर्गपरा जन्मकर्मफलप्रदाम् ।

क्रियाविशेषबहुलां भोगैश्वर्यगतिं प्रति ॥ ४३ ॥

  

are routinely misinterpreted to connote a rejection of the vedic system of karmaanushthana.

  

Many like Swami Samartha Ramadas and Swami Thyagaraja did their Rama naama japa in addition to their nityakarmas.

It is not impossible. Just difficult as all things dhaarmic are.

  

'Vedaanta' is frequently misunderstood and misinterpreted in certain advaitic circles that has contributed to the confusion.

Sometimes the simplest explanation seems to far fetched for complicated minds like ours.

The problem sometimes is not that what needs to be followed is complex, but that the person has become complicated and that the instrument has retained its simplicity and the gap is too hard to bridge for most.

  

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
