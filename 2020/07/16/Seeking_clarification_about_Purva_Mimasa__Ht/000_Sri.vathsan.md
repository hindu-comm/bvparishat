Namaskaram to Vidhushees and Vidwans,

  

Almost all the present sampradhayam are based on uttara mimamsa finding base in Vedantham-Upanishad which has rejected Purva Mimamsa. It is argued that Purva Mimamsa, which focuses on moksham/phalam through Karma alone that are enshrined in Karma kanda, is flawed and only knowledge of Vedantham and Gyanam will confer moksham. At the same time it is claimed that Nama Sankerthanam and Baghavad Nama smaranam like the Nadhopasana of Carnatic trinity will also bestow moksham. So repeated chanting of Rudram, Durga Shuktham, Purusha Shuktham etc., performing Athi Rudram that Purva Mimasakas believe as the way to moksham that are dedicated to Baghawathi-Baghawan will also fall under the category of Nama sankeerthanam Bagavad Nama smaranam and hence must bestow moksham. So why uttara mimamsakas doesn't refute the nadhopasana of carnatic trinities but refute the japam, parayanam, homam of purva mimamsakas alone?

  

Dhayavadhaha,

Srivathsan
