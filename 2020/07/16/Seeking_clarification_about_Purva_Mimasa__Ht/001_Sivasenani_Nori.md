Sri Srivathsan

  

Namaste.

  

For all sampradayas, performing Vaidika kratus is as important or more important than naadopaasana, naamasankeertanaetc. If non-Vaidika saadhanasseem to be more popular, it is only because compassionate aacharyasunderstand difficulties faced by saadhakas and emphasise the easiest path.

  

As far as Advaita is concerned, there is no opposition to performance of rites as detailed in the Purva Mimamsa, but they are afforded a place in preparation of saadhaka rather than as a direct cause of moksha. These rites cleanse the chitta of the saadhaka and prepare him for imbibing jnaana.

  

With respectto lack of refutation of karmas like naama-sankeertana and naadopaasana as direct causes of moksha, it is so because only the principal opposition is dealt with. There would be myriad ways of saadhana; not all can be refuted. Once the principle that jnaana alone leads to moksha is laid down, it is expected that seekers extend this to others where needed.

  

It is not out of order to state that for most people, karma remains what is relevant; samyag-jnaana is grasped by the blessed few like Ramana Maharshi who are ready for it.
