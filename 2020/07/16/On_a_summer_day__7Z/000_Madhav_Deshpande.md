On a summer day

  

सन्त्वातपाक्ता दिवसा मदीया:

ग्रीष्माभिषिक्ता धरणी समन्तात् ।

मनस्तु शीते कविताविताने

नन्दत्यजस्रं कविवाचि मग्नम् ।।

  

Let my days be soaked in the sun. The ground around me is drenched in summer heat. But my mind rests in the canopy of poetry and always delights by immersing into the words of a poem.
