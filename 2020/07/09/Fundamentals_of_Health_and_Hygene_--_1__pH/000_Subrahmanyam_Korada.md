नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

I would like to provide some important guidelines from Indian literature / tradition that are useful to maintain good health and avoid unnecessary expenditure . It may not be possible to offer source to every quotation cited here .

  

Health can be defined as - mentally , physically and socially wellbeing .

  

**If you have a sore throat ----**

  

**Infections ( including Kovid-19 ) mostly spread through air ( contagious/ सांक्रमिक - आयुर्वेद ) and attack when one isweak ---**

**if youhave a sore throat --**

**boil the milk -- let the water with pepper-powder boil to half - get old-jaggery-powder ---mix all the three - take as hot as you can .**

**  
**

Avoid -- things just taken out from the fridge and anything that is cold ( cool is okay ) - curd -icecream etc .

  

Do गण्डूष ( gargling ) with warm-salt-water as many times as possible - take boiled water only . Wash your hands , feet and do गण्डूष when you return home and after touching / eating rice etc .

  

Avoid -- oil - brinjal - pulses - heavy food - cold water - dusty places - outside food - preserved stuff .

  

Honey , ginger , dry ginger , dry pepper, garlic and turmeric are good for people suffering from fever - body pains - sore throat etc.

Add turmeric in limited quantity in almost all dishes .

Inhaling the vapour of boiled water with turmeric ( covering the head with a blanket ) would give instant relief .

  

Always avoid -- **उच्छिष्टम्** ( scrap or left over food or the food that is being shared by two or more in a single plate --

'engili ' in Telugu . It is highly dangerous - detrimental to health .

  

Avoid **using saliva to separate papers etc . -- a very bad habit we come across in buses and offices .**

**  
**

**Do not bite nails - you are touching different places as well as
ohers and parts of your own body .**

  

There are two entities -- मनस् and शरीरम् ( शीर्यते नश्यति इति
शरीरम् ) and मनस् is more important between the two --  

although one takes a medicine it may not work if one does not have a peaceful mind .

  

आधिः -- मानसिकव्याधिः ( पुंस्याधिर्मानसी व्यथा -- **अमरः**) -- व्याधिः -- शारीरकरुग्मता ।

  

प्रक्षाळनाद्धि पङ्कस्य दूरादस्पर्शनं वरम्(prevention is better than cure ) .

  

पथ्ये सतिगदार्तस्य किमौषधनिषेवणम् ? पथ्ये’सति गदार्तस्य किमौषधनिषेवणम् ? -- **लोलम्बराजीयम् -10**

  

**धर्मपथ्यर्थन्यायादनपेते** पा 4-4-92 यत्-- (आरोग्य - ) पथः अनपेतम्
-- पथ्यम् ।

  

If one consumes the food that is suitable to his body then there is no need of a medicine and if one does not follow पथ्याहार then also medicine is not needed -- in vain .

  

**बलाधिष्ठानमारोग्यम्** -- strength is the base of health .

  

सर्वंबलवतः पथ्यम् --- **तन्त्रवार्तिकम् , 1-3-7**

  

For a strong person everything is पथ्यम् (no food restrictions )

  

**वाग्भटः** ---

  

कः अरुक्? हितभुक् मितभुक् ऋतभुक् ।

  

Who is without a disease ? The one who takes food -- that is suitable ( to his constitution ) , limited and that is earned by fair means (all three in one -- हेतुर्न तु हेतवः -- **मम्मटः** )

  

Why people often fall sick ?

  

जन्मान्तरकृतं पापं व्याधिरूपेण बाधते ।

तच्छान्तिरौषधैर्दानैः जपहोमसुरार्चनैः ॥

  

The main cause of disease is the कर्म / पापम् that is committed in the earlier incarnations . The degree of intensity of a disease can be
reduced ( शान्ति but not निवारण / cure ) through medicines , donations , recitation of specificंमन्त्र-s' and worship of देवता-s ( as per the priscriptionin वेद-s andशास्त्र-s )

  

Still to continue ...

  

धन्यो’स्मि
