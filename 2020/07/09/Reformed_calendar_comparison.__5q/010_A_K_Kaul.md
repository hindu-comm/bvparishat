Shri Venkatesh Murthyji,  
Jai Shri Ram!

\<Some critics are right when they are saying Sayana Calendar has a Western or Christian influence. They give importance to

Pratyaksha Pramana only. Not Shastra Pramana. All arguments saying Vedas support Sayana is not correct because there

was no Sayana-Nirayana division mentioned in Vedas.\>

That is the "most unkindest cut"!

All the Vedas, Purana and siddhantas claim in one voice that the solar year is seasonal i.e. tropical.  

Hence the New "Hindu" solar year that is supposed to start on April 14/15 every year is an insult to the Vedas, Purana and siddhantas as it should start/ have started around March 21, the day of the Vernal Equinoxor the Winter Solstice i.e. December 21!

And a Gregorian year starts neither on December 21 nor on April 14 but on January 1, which is neither here nor there!

Then what about the Puranas and siddhantas?  

All of them advise in an unequivocal and unambiguous manner that the seasonal i.e. so called Sayana Rashichakra is to be used for all the religious and astronomical functions.

Similarly, there are no Mesha etc. Rashis in the Mahabharata either but it has talked of Bhishma waiting for Uttarayan which was coupled with lunar Magha exactly as in the Vedanga Jyotisha of Acharya Lagadha!

And we must not forget that the Vedas themselves have called the Itihasasand Purana as Panchami Veda! (Reference Chhandogy Upanishad 3/1/2/)

Thus you are putting the cart before the horse by saying they give importance to Pratyaksha Pramaan only. Not shastra praman!  

\<Some critics are right when they are saying Sayana Calendar has a Western or Christian influence.\>

Since all the Puranas and siddhantas advise in one voice a Sayana Rashichakra, do you mean to say that all the Puranas and siddhantas and even the Vedas, because of their advocating a tropical year, have a Western or Christian influence?

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!
