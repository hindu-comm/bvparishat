It is, of course, simple - but the details are missing from your partially incorrect over-simplification. For example, yes, there may be a constant ayanAMsha offset (look up rAShTriya panchAnga). given a tropical luni-solar calendar, how are adhika-mAsa-s to be added? When is the start epoch? How are the months aligned with the seasons? Is there a separate ayanAMsha for naxatra-s?  

In these details, the rAShTriya-panchAnga differs from the ratnakaraNDika system. I presume that the other systems differ in similar ways.

Interesting - time travelling westerners and christians must have influenced munjAla, shrIpati, ratnakaraNDika author, lichCHavi-s etc.. I suppose the same applies to spherical earth etc..

They would respond: "No more than you nirayaNa fanatics! You pay more attention to whether full-moon of the month happens in the vicinity of an asterism; and not to shAstra-pramANa."

Why waste ink on regurgitating old tropes - this isn't the thread for it. Anyway, you can as well look at <https://vvasuki.github.io/saMskAra/jyotisham/history/calendar_reform_comittee_report/02_PART-A/10_ANNEXURE_IV_Dissent_by_K_L_Daftari_-_reasons/#historical-changes-in-year-beginning>. ie - if you don't want to have sAyana-nirayana type divisions, you ought to follow the ancient practice of shifting your year beginnings and ritual observations across naxatra-s - but no, like a mule which is neither donkey nor horse, you'd do neither and rather rest in tAmasika inertia.
