There are several tropicalized lunisolar calendars such as:

\- Shri T V Sivaraman above (saved at <https://archive.org/details/alternate-panchAngas> for future reference),

\- rAShTriya panchAnga (which was a temporary compromise wrt contemporary custom - albeit it became as "temporary" as "reservation")  

\- The nepAli ratnakaraNDika based system popularized by the kauNDinyAyana-s ( <https://vvasuki.github.io/saMskAra/jyotisham/history/kauNDinyAyana/english/chronology_2_adhikamAsa/> ).

  

I understand the latter two (and have been using the last for several years). But would like to understand the sivarAman approach. How does he handle adhikamAsa insertions and sAyana corrections?  

  
  

Also, if there are other tropicalized luni-solar calendars, please let me know.
