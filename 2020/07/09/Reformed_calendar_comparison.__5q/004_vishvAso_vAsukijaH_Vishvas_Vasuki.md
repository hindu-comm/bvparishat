From another thread: "I had been publishing "Shri Krishna Universal Ephemeris and Panchang" for about ten years and though it contained nirayana (of course, the "almighty" Lahiri Ayanamsha) as well Sayana longitudes of planets to please "Lahiri Jyotishis" but most of them boycotted it and I had to stop it ultimately! Shri Darshaney Lokesh and Shri T V Sivaraman are now publishing their Sayana panchangas against all odds and I am trying my best that they should continue it so that maybe the general public will ultimately start following dharma as against nirayana Adharma, as pointed out by the "Report of Calendar Reform Committee"."

  

I would like to know details about how these sAyanified panchAnga-s are computed too, please.
