Respected Scholars,

 May I ask here about identifyingThe "Tithi" correctly on a particular day in different regions (particularly in TamilNadu and Andhra Pradesh). I see that, for e.g., Pournami is celebrated on different days/dates in Andhra and TamilNadu. Kindly provide a source if available because I can't read Tamil panchang. Thank you!

  

With best regards  
Suresh
