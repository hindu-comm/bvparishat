Namaste Sri Kaulji

  

I am not saying what the critics said. I agree there are statements in Shastras about seasons. Sorry if I offended you.

  

But at the same time there is also importance given to Nakshatras in the Vedas. Abhijit Nakshatra is not always mentioned in the Vedas. Take for example the Taittiriya Samhita 4-4-10. There is no mention of Abhijit.

  

The equal division of Nakshatras is given in Maitrayani Upanishad 6-14. Here it says the Month is divided into 9 quarters of Nakshatras. That means in a month the Moon or Sun crosses 9 quarters of the Nakshatras.
