Shri Vishvas Vasuki,

Jai Shri Ram!

Munjal's Laghumanasa with translationby K V Sarma was available with INSA, Delhi. I could not find it on the www.  Even if it is not available with INSA as a hard copy, they will arrange it as pdf for you.

May be Shri Shankar, the "saviour" of this august forum can help you there!

Sripati's "Siddhanta Shekhar" and "Sripati Paddhati" are available for download freely, though I do not remember the address!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
