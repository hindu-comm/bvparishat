From the calendar reform committee proceedings: "Hindu savants of those times either were unaware of the existence of the \*\*phenomenon of precession\*\* of equinoxes, or thought it was not unidirectional. The mistake was found by Munjāla and śrīpati in the 10th and 11th centuries, when the Vernal Equinox had receded by seven to eight days, and they tried to persuade the astronomers to take to sāyana reckoning but the attempt was unsuccessful."

  

Could any of you please describe the works of Munjāla and śrīpati mentioned above, and their proposals?
