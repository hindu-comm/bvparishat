It is simple. The planetary positions are already available in Astronomical Ephemeris in the Western countries.

Our Sayana friends will simply copy that information and map the festivals to that. There is no Ayanamsha calculation.

Some critics are right when they are saying Sayana Calendar has a Western or Christian influence. They give importance to  
Pratyaksha Pramana only. Not Shastra Pramana. All arguments saying Vedas support Sayana is not correct because there

was no Sayana-Nirayana division mentioned in Vedas.
