Sir, I understand that. I recall two volumes by V. Raghavan, both on Bhoja's Shringaraprakasa: one is the 1998 Harvard University Press edition - that's not what you're after, it seems. The second is a 1963 volume, of which our library catalogue descriptions reads "a revision of the author's thesis, University of Madras". Please note the word "revision". Hence my question: would this 1963 volume suit your purposes, or are you looking for the exact manuscript Raghavan submitted to the university?
