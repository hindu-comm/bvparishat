Dear Dr Kiran

Many thaks for youremail with details of the great Prof.Raghavan.I was not aware of

all these things you wrote of.This is the 3rd ed.of 1978 in all 498pages.I am surprised about the 1st [ed.in](http://ed.in) 1000pages.Still as I could know this book may be considered an encyclopedic work on Sanskrit Poetics.40 years ago I had consulted it.

It is a matter of great pleasure that scholars could be able to consult it online.

Regards

Girish K.Jha
