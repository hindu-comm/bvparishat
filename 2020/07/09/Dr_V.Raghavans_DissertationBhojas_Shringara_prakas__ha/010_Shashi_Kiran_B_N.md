Namaskara.

  

Dr. Raghavan worked as a research student under Prof. S Kuppuswami Sastri between 1931 and 1934. The subject of his study was Bhoja's Srngara-prakasha. He published his dissertation in 1939. In his own words, he had a "lifelong companionship" with the work.

  

He amplified his thesis and published the work in two parts in 1940 and 1945. And in 1963, thanks to the munificence of Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar, the then-Maharaja of Mysore, Dr. Raghavan brought it out in a single volume. This edition has significant omissions and commissions: The previous edition included a section on 'Old Rama Plays.' Dr. Raghavan published it as an independent book subsequently. He also utilised much material from texts that were not available to him when he published the thesis.

  

He added further material and published 'Bhoja's Srngara-prakasha' in 1978. We can consider this edition--which, incidentally, is Dr. Raghavan's *pièce de résistance*--as conclusive. Arguably, it represents the high-water mark of modern Sanskrit scholarship.

  

Smt. Nandini Ramani, Dr. Raghavan's daughter, might have a few physical copies of the 1978 edition with her. She can be reached at: [nandin...@gmail.com]().

  

Best regards,

Shashi Kiran B N
