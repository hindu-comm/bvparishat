I am grateful to you for raising this query, Professor Jha. I was planning to go into a long queue in our barely functioning main library to obtain the 1963 edition for my own project and had visions of having to scan a 1,000-page book, but now that Shankara ji found you a PDF of this work, I can save a lot of time too. Big thanks to both of you!

  

Best wishes,

Irene
