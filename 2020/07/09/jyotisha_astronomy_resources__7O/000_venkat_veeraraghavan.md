Dear Vidvans,

  

I am looking for a good book /online web resource that pictorially represents the nakshatras and rashis from the POV of the observer from earth.

Looking to gain a pictorial and simple understanding of jyotisha concepts explained.

  

I'd appreciate any good resources you can point me to.

  

Thanks,

  

Venkat
