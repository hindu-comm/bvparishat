The world is going through an unprecedented and extraordinary health scenario. Unprecedented because ill health has become a fact of life and many diseases are vying with each other to take the top slot as a serious health hazard. Extraordinary because despite acquiring nuanced details about human biology, sophisticated technologies to study the most subtle structures in the body and technical skills to manipulate body structures in many astonishing ways, diseases are on the increase. There is also a growing realization that conventional Western medicine alone cannot handle the mushrooming of diseases underscoring the need for alternative medical systems. Furthermore, there is also a gradual realisation that a more holistic perspective of the human system is imperative for efficient therapeutic management. All these inevitably brings into focus one of the longest unbroken healthcare system in the world Ayurveda, a characteristic feature of which is its integrative approach to health and disease. Can Ayurveda with its hoary past and an entirely different approach to health and disease play a role in the contemporary health scenario?. Now is the perfect time to look back, ask these questions and move forward. About the Speaker: Prof. Rama Jayasundar, Department of NMR, AIIMS, New Delhi has an unique and unusual career trajectory. A PhD alumnus of University of Cambridge (UK), she is trained in physics and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). While pioneering biomedical NMR work in India, she enrolled for the 5 1/2 years medical degree in Ayurveda (BAMS - Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery) as a full time student at the age of 41. She is the only one at both the national and international levels to hold dual degrees in Physics and Ayurveda. Her current research interests harness the distinctive facets of her expertise (NMR, physics, Ayurveda and Allopathy) to shed light on the scientific basis and working of Ayurveda.
