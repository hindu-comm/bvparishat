Namaskāra

  

Towards the end of his Tarkabhāṣā, Keśavamiśra while again mentioning Hetvābhāsas, states a type of Āśrayāsiddha hetvābhāsa where there no sandeha of the sādhya being in the pakṣa (eg., ghaṭaḥ anityaḥ, kāryatvāt, paṭavat). As he defines pakṣa as 'sandigdhasādhyadharman', there being no doubt about the residing of sādhya in the pakṣa, the pakṣa loses its pakṣaness and hence the hetu becomes āśrayāsiddha.

  

But much before that, while mentioning the kevalānvayihetu, the example he gives for it is; śabdaḥ abhidheyaḥ, prameyatvāt, yatprameyaṃ tadabhidheyaṃ yathā ghaṭaḥ. Here, there is no sandeha about śabda being abhidheya or not. So, as per the aforementioned definition of pakṣa, the pakṣa (śabda) would lose its pakṣaness, and the hetu (prameyatvāt) would become āśrayāsiddha.

  

Is there any solution this seeming mixup? Kindly guide.
