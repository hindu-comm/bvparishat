Dear Mr. Soundararajan,

If you are serious about pronunciation, I recommend joining the online

course currently being conducted by Prof Subarhmaniam Korada.

It is a thirty session comprehensive course. Besides the theoretical

part of an hour, he offers thirty minutes for people to practice pronunciation.

The 5th session is Saturday. You would benefit if you have strong

interest.
