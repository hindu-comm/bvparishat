Devanagari doesn't need a key to pronunciation.

  

चिह्न - when typing this out, what did you type?

च् इ-मात्रा ह् न् अ-

Or c i h n - depending upon how you typed.

It breaks to चि ह् न

  

This should leave no doubt of the pronunciation.

  

Miss pronunciation happens.

Doesn't make it correct though.

  

There are many like

सहस्र -> सहस्त्र

आह्वान -> आवाहन
