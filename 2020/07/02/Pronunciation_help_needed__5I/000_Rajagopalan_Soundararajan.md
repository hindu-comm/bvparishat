Dear scholars,

  

I need your help with the proper pronunciation of the word चिह्न. While learning the taniyan sloka of Sri Kurattazvan, that starts with 'श्रीवत्सचिह्न मिश्रेभ्यो ', I was taught to read चिह्न as (चिन्ह)cinha interchanging h and n. I have a similar experience with वह्नि.

Is this a convention or have I been pronouncing incorrectly all along?

  

Similarly, in the Ramayana sloka, (Sita's wedding), 'पाणिं गृह्णीष्व पाणिना' the pronunciation has h and N reversed. I am confused with this. One of the members in my class asked me about this, and I could not give a satisfactory response. Your guidance is much appreciated.

  

Also have you come across a dictionary for Sanskrit words with pronunciation feature just like English dictionaries?

  

Thanks

  

Soundararajan
