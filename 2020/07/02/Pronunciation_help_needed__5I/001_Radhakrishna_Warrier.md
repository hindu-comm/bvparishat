I haven't studied Sanskrit formally, and my knowledge in Sanskrit is meager, but I was taught to pronounceचिह्न as cihna not cinha, ब्रह्म as brahma not bramha, वह्नि as vahni and not vanhi. 

  

"*Also have you come across a dictionary for Sanskrit words with pronunciation feature just like English dictionaries?*"

  

Is that needed for Indic languages? That said, I have a Hindi - English dictionary that gives the pronunciation of Hindi words in Latin script (i.e., English script) with diacritics.

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
