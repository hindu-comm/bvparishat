Many thanks, Prof.Deshpande ji. The first half is indeedfrom चन्द्रालोक/कुवलयानन्द. Vidvan H V Narayanashastritaught me Chandraloka around 1954-55. He was an accomplished poet. He has composed 2 mahakavyas. श्रीशैलजगद्गुरुचरितम् and विद्यारण्यलीलातरङ्गिणी. I don't think I showed my कपित्वम् to him. My memory was stirred by the verses about कपित्वम् and the verse floated up.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
