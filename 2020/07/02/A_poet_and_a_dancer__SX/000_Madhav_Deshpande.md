A poet and a dancer

  

रङ्गे रम्यै: पदन्यासैर्मनो हरति नर्तकी ।

काव्ये रम्यै: पदन्यासैर्मनो हरति सत्कवि: ।।

  

A dancer captivates our mind by her beautiful footwork on the stage, and a good poet captivates our mind with his beautiful placement of words.

  

\[In Sanskrit, "pada" means both a foot and a word.\]
