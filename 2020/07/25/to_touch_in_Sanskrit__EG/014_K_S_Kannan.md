पर्याय-वचन-विवेकः is a small chapter.

I expected that he will dwell in detail on it in a later writing.

Who could be better qualified than him on the issue?  

  

Also, it is so important, it is worth a whole book on it.

Panini mentions *kopa* and *krodha* in the same s*ūtra:*

obviously the two are different.  

The Gita mentions *dveṣya* and *ari* in the same verse;

so the two are different too.

  

An excellent topic for research/a fairly long project.  

  

Will send the reference.
