Many thanks Prof.Kannan ji and Prof. Paturi ji.

Perhaps I should explain the context in which I became aware of this. While versifying I wanted to use the word, स्पर्श. But that word would not fit in the line and that was when I realized that there was not another equivalent word in Sanskrit. Like a boy on the bicycle who changes the destination to suit the traffic, I changed my idea.

The list provided by Prof.Paturi is quite impressive but I do not know if any one of them is suitable if I want to say, "Don't touch me' or "Touch me.'

Of course it is not necessary that a language should have more than one verb to express an action and there may be many more such verbs in Sanskrit and any other language. As a supplementary I find it intriguing why certain verbs have many equivalents \[There may be a dozen verbs in Sanskrit equivalent to "to go"\] and some are loners. It is perhaps a well known area of study in Linguistics.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
