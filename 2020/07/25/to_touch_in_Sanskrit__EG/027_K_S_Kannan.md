I have come across a few dictionaries listing synonyms alphabetically  

or some order of ideas for a few Indian languages.

But I am afraid there are none which can show how some of the "equivalent" words  

differ too, one from the other. This of course calls for a rather nuanced handling.

  

A good majority of Indian linguists of recent times at best try to display  

their acquaintance with Western linguistics, especially its recent developments,

rather than giving an inkling of their awareness of the rich legacy they are heir to.

  

That way, lexicographical progress in recent decades amidst Indian languages

has been rather poor, as far as I know. My knowledge may be limited.  

  

And a pretty bad certificate as it were for the glorious and long heritage which prided

in the copiousness of its vocabulary, as well as a vast and varied  

lexicographical and grammatical tradition.
