Respected scholars,

स्पृश् is the verb denoting "touch" in Sanskrit. Are there any other words which mean "to touch" (tactilesense and not figurative)? As per dictionaries I have access to, there are none. Is there a list of verbs (in English) for which there is only one equivalent (could be "causative") in Sanskrit?

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
