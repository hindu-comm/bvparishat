Anyhow I got the Sanskrit Version from the same Archive.org searching in English "vagvyavaharadarshaH" and here is the link to download.

  

<https://archive.org/download/vAgvyavahArAdarshaH/vAgvyavahArAdarshaH.pdf>  

  

If anybody wants Sanskrit Version.

  

Paryayavacanavivekah is on page no,85.

  

Thanks to Dr,Kannan for suggesting it.
