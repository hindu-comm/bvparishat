The cover term "गत्यर्थाः" or "गतौ "

includes a number of shades and nuances.

  

Perhaps you have seen Charudev Shastri's

necessitated by their geographical demands.

Again, it is easier, they say, to describe the theory of relativity

in the Hopi Language.

  

Sapir-Whorf hypothesis : established but also contested.

Language moulds culture, and

culture moulds language.
