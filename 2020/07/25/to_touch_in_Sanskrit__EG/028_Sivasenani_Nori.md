I remember one project in UOh which was supposed to link all dhatus. For instance all dhatus which have गतौ as a part of their explanations would be linked. It was called a WordNet, osr something similar. IIT, Bombay also had the same. That said, it is not a proper thesaurus, not even for one restricted to verbs and lyuDantas, as a search of the dhatupatha with the string स्पर्शने yields only two results, against the large number given by Prof. Paturi.

  

The best thesaurus remains Amarakosha, also one of the earliest in the world, with some 10,000 words listed in it.
