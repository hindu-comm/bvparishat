Murthy-ji,

As you might have noticed, I used the word *synonyms*

within inverted commas (while speaking of Eskimos).

  

Strictly speaking, there can be no real/perfect synonymy in any language

\- theoretically speaking at least.

  

The issues of प्रवृत्तिनिमित्त and व्युत्पत्तिनिमित्त

(and notions of जाति, गुण, क्रिया, and द्रव्य behind nomenclature)  

were discussed long ago in our heritage.

The issue of semantic change through history is not a minor one either.  

  

You might also have seen पर्याय-वचन-विवेकः  

of Charudeva Shastri.
