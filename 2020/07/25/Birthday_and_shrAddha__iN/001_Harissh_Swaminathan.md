In TN also the janma dina is counted as the nakshatra in a particular month (sauramaanam)

  

For shraaddham it's different from what you mentioned

  

It is taken as the tithi in either shukla or krishna paksha and in a particular month (sauramaanam)

  

For ex I perform my mother's shraaddham in the kanyaa maasa , krishna paksha dwaadashi
