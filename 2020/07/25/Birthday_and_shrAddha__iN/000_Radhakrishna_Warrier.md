I am interested in knowing how people in different parts of India reckon the day to celebrate their birthdays or the day to perform the śrāddha of their departed relatives.

Malayali Hindus celebrate their birthdays based on nakṣatra. If a person was born under the asterism of, say Bharaṇi, in the month of say Tulām, that person would celebrate birthday every year on the day of Bharaṇi in the month of Tulām.

Malayali Hindus perform the śrāddha function also based on nakṣatra. If a person passed away under the asterism of, say Bharaṇi, in the month of Tulām, that person’s śrāddha would be performed every year on the day of Bharaṇi in the month of Tulām.

How about people in other parts of India?
