अवश्यमेव लेखनीयं लिखतीति लिखितुमावश्यकी इति लेखिनी = that/who writes necessarily is लेखिनी. The instrument to write लेखनी = pen. The explanation offered otherwise is the agent who write may be used for the female writer also, as लेखी, लेखिनी ending in इन्/इनी.

  

And both forms are possible, but not from the same word and meaningbut derived from different words and possibly with different meaning.
