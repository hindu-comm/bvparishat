Indic Academy is committed to advancing diversity and inclusion in the society.

In pursuit of this objective, Indic Academy seeks to preserve and protect the Indigenous lifestyles, practices, traditions and doctrines in the area of non-binary gender and sexual orientations from exclusionism, discrimination, universalization, lack of representation and misrepresentation.

An increasing trend of immediate concern are global traditions that have been exclusivist, discriminatory and violent towards non-binary gender and sexual orientations, necessitating the contemporary intellectual and activist movements. The same traditions are now universalizing the exclusivism, discrimination and violence towards individuals and communities of these natures and orientations. As a result, the highly nuanced, advanced and a long tradition of pro-diversity inclusionist view in gender aspects cherished and nourished in Indic traditions is either missing from discourse or being misrepresented and misinterpreted to fit into the understandings that are not rooted in Indic culture and traditions.

Indic Academy therefore seeks to actively work for the insiders of Indigenous traditions/ cultures of non- binary gender and sexual orientation, through research and documentation and by creating awareness through monographs, books and documentaries.

As part of this endeavour, Indic Academy offers a short term research fellowshipbeginning with a comprehensive review anddocumentation of existingacademic research followed by the study of areas mentioned below :

-   Evidences from the Indic pastfor the non-binary gender and sexual
    orientations and their representation, lack of it, misrepresentation
    or misrepresentation in contemporary literature. -   Spirituality based non-binary gender and sexual orientation
    aspectssuch as transgenderism, sexual neutrality etc. that are
    under attack through despiritualization, conflation with
    non-spiritual aspects, modern and urban misunderstanding and
    resultant humiliation, actual spiritual roots of them. -   Sources of conflict regarding Non-Binary Gender and Sexual
    Orientations among pro-Indic intellectualsand activists and the
    approaches to their resolution well within the Indic worldview
    reflected and understood from the Indic texts, traditions and
    practices. -   Need for and approaches to train global children in general and
    Indian parents and children in particular for the critical
    receptionof the confoundingly humongous information coming from the
    contemporary LGBTQI and related movements.

Interested researchers may send their statement of interest along with their CV to[nam...@indica.org.in](). The terms of the fellowship including the remuneration as well as the duration will be determined based on the proposal and credentials of the applicants.
