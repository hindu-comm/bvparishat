> "If we view the contemporary study of Indian culture as a research > program with this kind of structure, we can begin to make sense of its > peculiar combination of continuities and discontinuities. The basic > assumptions about the religion of the Brahmin are part of this > program’s hard core, whereas the claims concerning the Aryan invasion, > racial superiority, magical thinking, and the varna ideology are part > of its protective belt. The latter ideas form a more flexible set of > auxiliary hypotheses, which can be modified and revised in the face of > anomalies, so as to protect the research program from refutation. > Indeed, this has happened regularly, not only during the past three > decades, but also in the centuries before. Between the 17th and the > 21st centuries, various accounts of Brahmanical religion succeeded > each other; each of these relied upon specific ideas that were > dominant or popular in some era. In the face of empirical and > conceptual problems, the auxiliary hypotheses moved from theological > notions of heathen idolatry to anthropological concepts of magical > thinking and to the current claims about homology and ideology; or > they could shift from the idea of an Aryan invasion and conquest to > peaceful migration and contact. But the hard core of assumptions > concerning the religion and priesthood of ancient India needed to be > immunized against falsification; if scholars failed to do so, their > entire research program would break down (and this in the absence of > any promising alternative). >
