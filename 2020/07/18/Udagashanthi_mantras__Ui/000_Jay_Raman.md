Hello Respected Sir/ Madam,

I have recently joined the forum and noted it to be a great resource of information in Sanskrit.

  

I am wondering whether any experts have any information about "commentary or detailed meaning (in Hindi or English)"to Udagashanthi mantras? Look forward to advice/guidance.

  

Regards,

Jayaraman
