भूमा has started a textual study program on its youtube channel.  
(<https://youtu.be/2zD2dPi5KZ0>)  
  
Vedantasara of Sadananda is a gem of Vedanta darshana. It has many  
commentaries. Among them Vidvanmanoranjani is one of the important teeka.  
  
Dr. Ganesh Ishwar Bhat, one of the eminent scholars in the field of Vedanta will grace us by teaching this text.  
  
We have come up with its first episode.
