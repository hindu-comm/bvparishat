Prof Murali,  

Please check Valmiki in किष्किन्धाकाण्ड

See when Sugriva instructs his monkeys to go north.

He would describe the area, no proper noun.

The three of four chapters there give a good review of world geography possibly believed those days

as Sugriva instructs them to know their path in four directions as they search Sita.  

Regards,

BM
