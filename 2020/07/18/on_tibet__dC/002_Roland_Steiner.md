The Kaśmīrian *Rājataraṅgiṇīs* designate the Tibetan inhabitants of the Indus region (Ladakh) as *Bhauṭṭas* or *Bhuṭṭas.*  
  
“\[...\] Śrīvara already knows the term ‘Little and Great *Bhuṭṭa*-land’ \[ŚRT 3.445: *sūkṣmabṛhadbhuṭṭadeśau*\]. They refer to Baltistān (Skardo) and Ladākh which have continued to be known to the present day as ‘Little and Great Tibet,’ or among Kaśmīrīs as *Lukh Buṭun* and *Buḍ Buṭun* \[*Buṭun*, connected with the ethnic term Buṭ^(a) \< Bhauṭṭa \[...\], is the Kaśmīrī term for Tibet in general.\] These terms are in fact of a far older date, as they are found already in the Chinese Annals as ‘Little and Great Poliu.’ (Marc Aurel Stein, *Kalhaṇa’s Rājataraṅgiṇī.* A Chronicle of the Kings of Kaśmīr. Transl., with an introd., comm. and app. Vol. 2, Westminster 1900, p. 435.)  
  
With best regards,
