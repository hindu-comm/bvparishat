Respected Members,

About a fortnight ago, I have addressed the following mail to all Members. I am sure some may be in a position to provide the meaning in English or Hindi.

  

I specifically request Dr Shankar to help me. You have helped many many scholars in providing very rare Documents.

  

Dr Nagaraj, you also provided me the rendering of Sri Bhagavatam about 3yrs ago, which helped very much in my efforts.

  

Many Thanks in advance to all.

-Ashok Gudsoorkar
