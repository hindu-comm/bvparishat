Respected Members,

I wish to have complete meanings in **English** or **Marathi** or **Hindi** of the following two Stutis:

  

1\. We get the meanings of all the four parts of VenkateshSuprabhatam in Bookstores at Tirupati or elsewhere: (i)Suprabhatam, (ii)Stotram, (iii)Stotram and (iv)Mangalam.

  However, we **do not**get the meaning of **SrinivasaGadyam** which is rendered beautifully, by some scholars.

  

2\. In the same way, we get the meanings of the two parts of
RudraPrashna (i)Namakam and (ii)Chamakam in BookStores.

  However, we **do not** get the meaning of **Mahanyaasam,** which is rendered excellently, by some Scholars.

  

I request our learned Members, esp. Sri Shankar and Dr Nagaraj Paturi, to help me in getting themeanings of **SRINIVAS GADYAM** and **MAHANYASAM,** if they possess in their collections.

  

With warm regards,

-Ashok G GUdsoorkar
