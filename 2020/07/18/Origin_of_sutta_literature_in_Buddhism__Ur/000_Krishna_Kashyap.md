Namaskar,

  

I have a question.

  

1)Sutta literature like Majjima NikAya, anguttara nikAya mentions characters like vasetta, yamataggi, Bhagu etc. Was this literature created several years after Gauthama Buddha or during his times?

  

2)Did Gauthama Buddha author them or gave asinstructions to his followers and the major disciples like Satiputtawrote them down?

 Or  

4\) Are they the work of later authors belonging to a tributary of Buddhism like the Mahayana sect?
