I was pleasantly surprised to see Dr Shankar Rajaraman, the renowned Sanskrit poet of our times silently and humbly applying for the membership of BVP.

  

Shankar Rajaraman is an allopathic doctor, having completed his MBBS degree from MS Ramaiah Medical College, Bangalore and a post-graduate diploma in psychological medicine from JJM Medical College, Davanagere. He holds the first rank with a gold medal in MA Sanskrit from KSOU, Mysore. He completed his doctorate from the National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS), Bangalore, on a topic that bridges contemporary psychology and Sanskrit poetics.

Dr Shankar Rajaraman specializes in a cryptic form of Sanskrit poetry known as "chitra-kavya" (often translated as "wonder poetry" or "pattern poetry"). Two of his famous chitra-kavya works include Devi-danaviyam and Chitra-naishadham. For the former work, he was awarded the Professor M. Hiriyanna Sanskrit Works Award in 2013 by Karnataka Samskrit University, Bangalore. In 2017, he has conferred the Bannanje Award for his contribution to Sanskrit.

Apart from composing poetry, Dr Shankar Rajaraman has been translating Classical Sanskrit works to English. Some of these works pertain to Ayurvedic nutrition and dietetics. Others such as Kokila Sandesha ("The Message of The Koel") and Madhura Vijaya ("The Conquest of Madhura") are purely poetic compositions that he has co-translated along with Ms. Venetia Kotamraju. He has also translated some of the compositions of Basavanna, the 12th-century social reformer, and KanakaDasa, the 16th-century saint-poet, from Kannada to Sanskrit. At present, as a post-doc fellow at NIAS, he is involved in translating a Sanskrit epic poem from 12th century Kashmir. He has also been popularizing classical Sanskrit poetry through social media, especially Twitter and Facebook.  

Welcome Dr Shankar Rajaraman to BVP !
