1)Suffix -nu- underlies a small series of marginal suffixes including -tnu-/-itnu- and -snu-/-iṣṇu- which could be attached both to a primary function verb root and to a causative verb stem. Should we regard these suffixes -tnu-/ -snu- as a combination of suffix -nu- with the root distributors -t/-s ? e.g. kṛtnú, jiṣnú                
                                   
2)Is it correct to say suffixes -itnu-/-iṣṇu are the combination of suffix -nu- and distr. -t/-s with a linking vowel -i- for -seṭ roots? e.g. dravitnú, kariṣnú                        
        3) Do we have to follow the same principal using these suffixes with causative verb stems? Do they actually have the same formation: suffix -nu-, the root distributors -t-/-s and a linking
vowel -i- ( In spite of the fact that in this case -t-/-s- are added to a causative verb stem not to a verb root using -i-)? e.g. drāvayitnú, mādayiṣṇú                             Or -t-/-s- serve different here?
