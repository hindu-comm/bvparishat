Dear Kushagra-ji,

  

Ānanda-vardhana discusses *saṃvāda* (*Dhvanyāloka*, 4.11–13). He lists three kinds: *pratibimba*, *ālekhya*, and *tulya-deha*. Rāja-śekhara builds on this in his *Kāvya-mīmāṃsā* (as Dr. Shankar rightly mentioned) and categorizes *haraṇa* under three heads—***śabda-haraṇa*, *artha-haraṇa*, and *śabdārtha-haraṇa*. (Refer chapters eleven, twelve, and thirteen.) Interestingly, he also classifies poets based on *haraṇa*.

Best regards,

Shashi Kiran
