Dear Sri Singh,

  

Can you please share with me which edition of Ksheeratarangini you are using. I have the RL Kapoor Trust publication (ed. Pt Yudhishthir Mimansak) where I'm missing the said ganasutra and its explication.

  

However the opening verse व्याख्यातेयं नवगणी इत्यादि has this pada which says 'पाठेऽर्थे चागमभ्रंशान्महतामपि मोहतः' for which the learned editor supplies the remark in a footnote 'अनेन चरणेन चुरादौ पाठभ्रंशबाहुल्यं प्रदर्श्यते' which certainly seems to account for variations in forms.  

  

I'd really like to have another edition of this dhatupatha, for cross reference, also simply because my present text at some places talks of 'इति भुर्जपत्रलिखिते हस्तलिखिते पाठः' . Although my present text is very authoritative, dealing with text variations in birch bark leaves is somewhat above my pay grade.  

  

  

  

Thanks in advance,

  
Srini
