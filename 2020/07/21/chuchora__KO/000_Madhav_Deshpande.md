In his book *Radices Sanskritae*, published in 1827 from Berlin, Frederick Rosen lists the root चुर् as occurring in the first and the 10th conjugations, and provides forms like चोरति/चोरयति and चुचोर/चोरयामास.

I have used the form चुचोर in one of my verses, and I wanted to know from other Vaiyākaraṇas if there is any evidence for the root चुर् in the first conjugation. Perhaps, G.B. Palsule'sconcordance of the various versions of the Dhātupāṭha has some information. I couldn't find my copy of this book. Rosen does not list the source of his information.
