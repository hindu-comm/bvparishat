Somewhat related, sharing just because it may not have been discussed in this group before: this talk by him (Chamu Krishna Shastry) from 2013:<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yjya55mbbdg>-- on school education of Sanskrit. Even if one may have a minor difference of opinion on a point or two, one can get an idea of the amount of attention he has devoted over the years, and his passion for the cause to which he has dedicated his life, and that is highly inspiring.
