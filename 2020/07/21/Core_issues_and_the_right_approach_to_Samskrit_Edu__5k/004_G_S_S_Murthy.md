It seems to me that what is missing in today's Sanskrit pedagogy is an urge to expand the frontiers of the knowledge base in Sanskrit. We continue to arrange and participate in Vakyarthas and sangoShThis on the same subjects and themes endlessly, as if our main aim is to go on digging the ancient texts to unearth the hidden gems and wax eloquent about them. Scholars should spend time creating new areas of knowledge in Sanskrit. New types of literature should come forth.In fact modern Indian languages are way ahead of Sanskrit in this matter. It is not that nothing is being done. But what is being done does not get nurtured. Why cannot we develop a saptama darshana on the philosophy and methods of Science? Why cannot the best of literature in other languages get translated into Sanskrit? We are in a Golden Age as far as funding for Sanskrit is concerned. But silos, or rather, deep wells are being constructed out of those funds. People flock to learn Sanskrit as it is a venue for a decent living with clear cut steps, Ma, PhD and a lecturer/reader/professor in a university. I am sorry if what I say hurts.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
