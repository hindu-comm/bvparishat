Clear sky here after a long time - some fine stars were visible from our terrace. Writing so that interested others may go out, look up and enjoy as well.  

  
Most spectacular: One can see very bright guru and shani pretty close in the vicinity of uttara - AShADha. They will be on top of each other the coming winter solstice - a rare and spectacular event. Don't miss.  

  

Despite light pollution one could make out hasta. More clearly - chitrA, niShTyA, vishAkhA (incidentally the constellation of the great ikShvAkus), anUrAdhA, jyeShThA, mUla close to the galactic center, pUrvAShADha, shroNA, abhijit. Great opportunity to practice the corresponding bits of naxatreShTi mantras.  

  

Also, to the north, (despite light pollution), one could make out current dhruva close to the horizon. And the saptaRShi-s / RkSha and the shiMshumAra. Good opportunity to recite <https://vvasuki.github.io/saMskAra/mantraH/lokAntaram/yajuH/shiMshumAra/> and <https://vvasuki.github.io/saMskAra/mantraH/lokAntaram/yajuH/dhruva/> .
