Yes, Vishvas ji,

  

I too got an opportunity to see crystal clear night sky after several weeks in my place yesterday.

  

Apart from all the stars and planets you have described, we have our guest NeoWise comet also in the sky this month. I could watch it for about an hour in the evening sky (around 7:30 - 8:30 pm). It is bright enough to watch with naked eye, though one should know where to look for it in the sky. From place where I live, after the sky got dark enough in the evening, I spotted it exactly in the North-West direction (315 degrees from North) at an elevation of around 40 degrees from horizon.

  

Using a pair of binoculars of 10 x 50, view has improved to some extent. Tail is not very long, but wide. I could not catch it using my 120x zoom camera. If the sky is clear today also, we have better chances of getting better view today.

  

  

P V S Kumar
