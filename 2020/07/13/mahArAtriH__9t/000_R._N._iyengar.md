Dear scholars,

  

The Shabda Kalpadruma gives the meaning of the word as (the night part) two muhurtas past midnight. **In which Tantra this definition is given**?

The Vaijayanti Kosha of Yadavaprakashalistsमहारात्र\` a variant with nearly the same meaning as

Generally the word is used to refer to a particular night in the Kartika/Magha month. **I am not looking at such a usage**. My special interest is about the प्रातरनुवाक that the Vedic texts say should begin when a large part of night (महति रात्र्या अनूच्यः - ऐतरेय ब्राह्मण) is remaining. In Tai Sam (7.5.5) this appears as महति रात्रियै.Bhatta Bhaskara commentary explains this as - महारात्रिं उपोत्थाय प्रातरनुवाकमुपाकुर्यात् \|\|

I would like to know whether the word **Mahaaraatra/i** is attested in classical literature (not Lexical) in the sense of a division or time of night. Thanks in advance for all help.

Regards

RN Iyengar
