Professor Mahulikar Ji,

  

I understand that Carnatic musicians primarily sing in Telugu. Non-Telugu compositions are usually Dasapadas in Kannada and Sri Dikshitar’s Sanskrit Kritis. Most other composers have composed in either Telugu or Sanskrit.

  

So, if they sing in Telugu, they have to sing Tyagaraja Swami’s compositions, which are almost exclusively regarding Rama-Bhakti.

  

The dissonance associated with criticizing Rama Bhaktas and singing Tyagaraja Kritis must be painful.

  

Best,

Kushagra

  

P.S.: My knowledge of Carnatic music is limited. I received training in the Hindustani style.
