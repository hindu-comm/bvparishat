Dear Scholars,

  

On Twitter, Shri Bharath Ji (@brakoo), has posted a series of remarkable "ink-on-paper" sketches drawn mostly from temples across the country. I encourage everyone to view them here:

Over the last few days, I have been composing verses to describeeach of his sketches. However, I may not be able to cover all of them, given his sheer versatility.

  

Nonetheless, I am offering one verse in the famous śravaṇābharaṇam (श्रवणाभरणम्) meter:  

  

अयि दशकण्ठभुजाधृतभूधरतुङ्गविचित्रविलासरते  
शिशुशशिमौलिविनोदविधायिनि केलिकलाधरचन्द्रमुखे।  
बलधनमानविमत्तदशाननदर्पविभेदनसूत्रधरे  
विजितसुरारिनुते जय हे गिरिराजसुते भव मे शरणम्॥
