The famous Carnatic vocalist Sri T. M. Krishna, who has lately become known for his outspoken views, said recently:

  

"'We collect this in the forest, cut it and supply it for the homams (a fire centred ritual/religious offering) that Iyers (brahmins) do.' said an Irula (tribal) woman. But she cannot be an active participant in the actual homam!"  

  

My reply:

  

वल्लकीरूपलावण्यं काष्ठधातुसमुद्भवम्।  
तन्त्रीवादनतो लभ्यं काष्ठकारो न विन्दते॥ 1

  

Yesterday, Sri Krishna commented on a different issue:

  

"Parents who are thrilled about their children's marks in the CBSE exams must ponder over the necessity to express their pride on social media. Many children may not have done as well. In a country that is so obsessed with marks this only adds to the pressure."  

  

To which, someone added a parody:

  

"Those who are thrilled that they could sing well must ponder over the necessity to sing on stages. Many may not sing that well. This will only add to the pressure."  

  

My reply:

  

प्रीणातु मे सहृदयो रसपानलुब्धो  
मञ्चे विरौमि न कदापि जगाद गेष्णुः।  
यस्मान्न यान्तुलघुतामपलापिनश्च  
नेपथ्यमेव विदधामि सुरङ्गशालाम्।। 2  

  

“If it pleases the connoisseurs of music, I shall never sing on the stage,” said the professional singer. “Lest it discomfit the cacophonous ones, I shall treat the backstage\* as my theater.”  

  

\* Alternatively, the changing room.
