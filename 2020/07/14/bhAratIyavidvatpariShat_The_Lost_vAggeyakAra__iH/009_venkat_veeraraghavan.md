Thanks for the Kusha mantras.  

I was thinking of:

"ॐ विरिञ्चिना सहोत्पन्न परमेष्ठीनिसर्गज । नुद सर्वाणि पापानि कुश स्वस्तिकरो भव ॥ "  

Some traditions suggest using the Ishetva mantra to harvest samit etc.

  

The other issue to consider is that a Homa/Yajna is a spiritual function conducted by the Yajamana (on his behalf) and people who contributefromthe milkman to the person who gets honey from the mountains is due the merit irrespective of whether they are physically present or not.

  

The mouth eats food, but thewhole body gains in strength.

  

Instead of taking the Purusha sukta verses in this light, people expect something else.

Maybe next time we can insist that some payasam should also be poured into the ears of these intellectuals inthe interests of equality and socialjustice. What the tongue received, maythe ears, hands and legs receive. evam asthu.

  

By the standard of these 'intellectuals', I can argue that despite buying tickets for TMK's concerts I was not invited to his wedding etc. Despite themilkman and theprovision store owners supplying raw materials for Sivakumar's son's wedding they were not invited to the wedding feast.

  

There is no end to this madness.

I dontknow whether these people are angling for a ticket in politics.

If anything it serves to irritate and little else.

  

But there is an elegant solution to satisfy all these 'intellectuals'.

Give them all a box of Colgate 'Veda-shakti' .... now all can "participate" ;-)
