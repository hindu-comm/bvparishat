(Changing thread name per Sri Venkat Veeraraghavan’s suggestion)

  

A detailed discussion can be found in

  

Jan Gonda, “The Ritual Function and Significance of Grasses in the Religion of the Veda”

  

Some ancient authorities thought they were the same, but some others drew some distinction between the two. I have attached photo of 2 of the pages for your reference. Please see Gonda’s comment on the first paragraph in the chapter on Kusa. The book is very good and has detailed analysis.

  

Generally speaking Agni is held to be residing in the darbha grass and darbha can be used in lieu of the actual Agni in extenuating circumstances - agnivaan vai darbhastambhaH - acchidra prashnam 3rd anuvaakam. Thus ritually one should not step on it, should be transported with tips facing upwards, etc.
