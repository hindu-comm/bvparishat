Dear Shri Ashok ji,

  

Most of my knowledge is also from the internet and talking to Shishtas.

I have not harvested Darbha except once when in the Himalayas.

  

My understanding in this regard is as follows:

Kusha is a type of darbha that is considered best. It mostly grows around river beds and is growing scarce these days even in Aryavarta except for select pockets nearCauveri and the Ganges.

The word Kushala (expert) came from the practice of harvesting Kusha.

The blade is razor sharp and if held improperly will draw blood immediately, hence it took skill to harvest and prepare.



Munjha is a sub variety used for making the maunjhi a belt worn by Brahmacharis and those who have adopted the Brahmacharya vow as an anga of tapasya.

For ex: When Shri Krishna did tapasya for the sake of a son, he wore a maunjhi(Source: MB)

has more information.

  

I think your topic is worth starting as a fresh question rather than a branch which may get lost.  

  

Regards,,

  

Venkat
