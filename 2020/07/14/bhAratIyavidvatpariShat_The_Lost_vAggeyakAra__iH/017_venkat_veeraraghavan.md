Dear Shri Balasubramanian ji,  

  

Thanks for Gonda's paper.

Also the stuff about transporting darbha with tips facing upwards is new to me. I did not know that!

Could not find the book on archive.

  

Dr. Kannan: wrt the source of lava and kusha being the lower and upper portions of the same grass, are you looking for an earlier source than the Uttara khanda of the Ramayana?

 I believethere is a section on kushaprakaranam that speaks about the types and application of kusha:  

Generally ritual significance is for the sake of purity. Almost all rituals starting from achamana, pranayama, etc are for preliminary purification. Generally darbha pavitras are used after achamana to prevent ucchista (perhaps?).

The darbha serves to purify the ritual space whether hands (pavitra) for japa/homa/tarpana/marjana and around homa kunda for havan and so on.

  

Harita says: (10 types of darbha)

"कुशाः काशा यवा दूर्वा उशीराश्च सकुन्दकाः। गोधूमा व्रीहयो मुञ्जा दश दर्भाः सबल्बजाः ॥ कुशाभावे तु काशाः स्युः काशाः कुशसमाः स्मृताः । कुशाभावे गृहीतव्या अन्ये दर्भा यथोचिताः।"

  

The last sentence might read if kaasha(not kushaa?) is not available one of the rest is chosen (?)

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
