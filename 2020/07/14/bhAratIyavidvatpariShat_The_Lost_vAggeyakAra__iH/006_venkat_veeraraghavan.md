Dear Shri Kushagra ji,

  

Flowers, darbha and kaashta have to be collected by ones self (with mantras) or one's disciples/sons. Store bought stuff of the aforementioned kind loses value as per shastra and is nor recommended by our rshis. This is why many rshis /agnihotris chose to live near river banks where darbha and kaashta are in profusion.

  

TM Krishna is a good carnatic musician and does not watch the clock like many. He once on audience interest continued a concert in Melbourne till 1130 PM and was still going strong when I had to leave (reluctantly).

  

Now that said, TMK is deluded in the extreme and does not know what he is talking about. I can infer that he does not do even sandhyavandana.. the lack of chittashuddhi is rather apparent in some of his statements.

  

Dr. Paturi is right in every sense of the word.

Dr. Kannan is right on the ball.

Recently (just before covid) Sivakumar (an erstwhile Tamil actor) commented that the man who builds the walls of the gabhagrha with is feet on the lingam (????) cannot enter the garbha grha. The above is a rather ridiculous comment because no one is likely to put their feet on a Shiva linga and also the deity is brought in after the structure is built.

The above was in comment wrt the big temple of Tanjore.

Someone put out a meme of 4 workers sitting in the hall ofSivakumar's residence claiming the right for having built the walls of bedrooms. The actual meme was rather crass and suggestive, but for crass people only a crass message will sink (or will it?).

  

The statements are Dravidian propagandist trash rehashed all over.

  

May I add most commies in India are Brahmin strain of some sort. These people suffer from some sort of deep self hatred/ guilt and cannot be helped.

One can only pray for them and leave it at that.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
