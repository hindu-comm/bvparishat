Earlier, that TMK used to use false interpretations. In this he seems to have used lies. This Irula woman telling him that is all, most probably his fiction.

  

In any case, people on twitter gave him enough thrashing replies like surgical instrument maker /supplier does not perform the surgery, microphone supplier does not perform the concert etc.

  

He is using the source of his celebrity status (his birth in a certain community, as per his own theory) to attack that source (that community). Oedipus complex.

Patricidal/matricidal. That too killing the father/mother using baseless , false allegations against that father/mother as a weapon.

  

He is thinking that joining the herds that attack the art and tradition that gave / give him bread and butter is heroism, without realizing that a defector to the enemy side is considered a coward.
