नमोविद्वद्भ्यः

  

**गण्डूषः ( gargling ) is very important** ---

  

गण्डूषमथ कुर्वीत शीतेन पयसा मुहुः ।

कफतृष्णामलहरं मुखान्तश्शुद्धिकारकम् ॥

कुर्यात् द्वादश गण्डूषान् पुरीषोत्सर्जने ततः ।

मूत्रोत्सर्गे तु चतुरो भोजनान्ते तु षोडशम् ॥

  

**After using toilet -- 12 times**

**After going to urinals -- 4 times**

**After meals -- 16 times**

Gargling preferably with cool water (depending on the climate ) - so that the phlegm etc is cleared and there won't

be any smell from the mouth .

**' Mouthwash ' is carcinogenic(causes cancer ) . One should use tongue-cleaner after brushing the teeth .**

It is there in **Indian tradition - washing hands and feet and doing गण्डूष a number of times - after returning home .**

The cloths used outside should be kept aside and depending on the time spent outside it is better to take bath .

  

As far as possible **avoid visiting hospitals** ( it may cause Hepatitis - B -- **कामिलारोगः** ) - after returning from a hospital one should take head -bath and wash the clothes , before entering the house ( should maintain self-isolation -- should not touch anybody / anything ).

  

I teach my students to **change clothes five times in a day** -- daytime at home - outside - night time - during meals - during पूजा ( worship )

  

**Most of the virus enters through air and clothes .**

  

**Never touch another person unless it is necessary - if done do शौचम् (cleaning hands etc ) at the earliest .**

**  
**

**Hugging is not our culture . Watch the आचार** ( general cleanliness etc) before accepting anything at others' house.

  

**Never let your children share food with others , especially in a school** . Resist recitation of गयत्री etc in the school .श्लोक-s (verses) are okay .

We were keeping school-clothes separately .

Avoid out-side food as far as possible -- if cannot avoid eat hot and to the minimum .  

  

**It is better to give up मांस ( meat )** as he who does not consume meat would not suffer from any disease ---  

  

न भक्षयति यो मांसं विधिं हित्वा पिशाचवत् ।

स लोके प्रियतां याति व्याधिभिश्च न पीड्यते ॥ **मनुस्मृतिः , 5-50**

  

घृतेन वर्धते बुद्धिः क्षीरेणायुष्यवर्धनम् ।

शाकेन वर्धते व्याधिः मांसं मांसेन वर्धते ॥

  

Ghee ( clarified butter) would improve the intellect - milk increases longevity - vegetables cause diseases and

flesh would increase by meat .

  

**There are six causes of diseases** --

  

अत्यंबुपानात् अतिसङ्गमाच्च

दिवा च सुप्तेः निशि जागराच्च ।

निरोधनात् मूत्रपुरीषयोश्च

षड्भिर्निदानैः प्रभवन्ति रोगाः ॥ **चरकम्**

Consumption of excess water , too much of sex ( alternative days only ) , napping ( sleep during day ) , waking during night , suppressing toilets - are the six causes of diseases .

**निदानं त्वादिकारणम् -- अमरः ।**

  

More in store ...

  

धन्यो’स्मि
