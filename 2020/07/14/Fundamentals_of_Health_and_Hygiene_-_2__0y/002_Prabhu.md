namaste vidvAn shrI karoda subrahmanyavarya.

  

"शाकेन वर्धते व्याधिः - vegetables cause diseases"

  

Should the above be taken as meaning raw or uncooked vegetables?

Or is the verse implying vegetables... no matter cooked or not, cause diseases?

  

(Anyways, this being first month of chAturmAsya there is no use of
"shAkA" at home :-) )

  

Thank you and regards

Prabhu
