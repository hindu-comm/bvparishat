Namaste Prabhugaru

  

शाकेन वर्धते व्याधिः

  

Here one has to take व्यक्ति ( individual) rather than जाति (all ) into consideration --

  

one has to consume certain शाक only during certain ऋतु (season) -

  

for example the शाक-s that would cause heat should be avoided during summer - शाक-s thtg are difficult

to digest and cool in nature should be avoided during winter and rainy season .

  

1\. वस्तुगुणदीपिक 2004 ( तेलुगु ) ₹ 360/- ABS Publishers , Main Road , Rajamahendri(Rajahmundry)533101

                              or Gollapudi Veeraswamy & Sons , .... 533101

2.बसवराजीयमु 1998 (तेलुगु) Rs 300/ - as above

  

Both the above books are indispensable for every household .

  

In Vastugunadeepika, different things - vegetables , pulses etc are given in Telugu-Sanskrit-Hindi-English and antidotesare also suggested .

  

Generally speaking - uncooked is for animals and cooked is for humans (except a few ) - this depending on

respective digestive system - we should not ape apes in the name of प्रकृतिवैद्यम् ।

  

I may be discussing the गुण-s of certain foodstuffs in the forthcoming
postings .
