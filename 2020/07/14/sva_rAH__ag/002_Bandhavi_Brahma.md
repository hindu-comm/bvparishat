Dear Ujjwal ji,

  

It's really commendable that you are taking so much effort to bring back knowledge of स्वर! I am inspired to learn more from your posts and start to learn and use स्वर mark while writing or reading anything.

  

Please can you explain how you locate the स्वर for each word you use? Do you directly check with vedic literature, or is there any dictionary which has the markings and has searchable version availble online? Or do you have any way for using the स्वर rules of अष्टाध्यायी and फिट्सूत्राणि for generating the स्वर with an algorithm>

  

I also have two doubts and request inputs from other schollars also.

  

1\) since स्वर combination depends on संहिता, and since संहिता may change as per विवक्षा is it reasonable to simply mark the स्वर in a sentence taking it as fully संहिता?

  

2\) i have read that many words may have different स्वर according to different vedic texts. In such a case how do you decipher the one to adopt for the current context?  
  
Namaskar,

Bandhavi
