On further searching I found the project of Dhaval Patel ji, Sivakumari ji, and Marcis Gasuns ji. I think they are also members of this group by searching old posts!

  

Dear Ujjwal ji, do you use this website for finding the स्वर?<https://www.sanskritworld.in/sanskrittool/SanskritAccent/accent.html>  

  

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1IsXraXfCg>-Sanskrit Accent proposal for crowdfund

It seems that the project has not moved forward beyond फिट्सूत्राणि since last 5 years. Is there any interest in this group for reviving this project? I am also happy to contribute from programming side.

  

Namaskar,

Bandhavi
