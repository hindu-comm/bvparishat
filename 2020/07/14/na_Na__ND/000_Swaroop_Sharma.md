Namaste,

  

Esteemed scholars,

  

I request the learned members to enlighten me on the usage of न & ण in तृतीयाविभक्तिः

  

If at one place, it's रामेण, while in the other place it's पठनेन।

  

I tried to do some online reading and I partially understood the Sutra र-षाभ्याम्...... However, I'm unable to get to the depth of the Sutras.

  

Kindly help me:-)
