We generally act with some end in view:

प्रयोजनमनुद्दिश्य न मन्दोऽपि प्रवर्तते ।

  

When we act out of curiosity, we can't even expect the results:

we just have no idea of what is in store for us.

  

" x-निरपेक्ष " is "immaterial of x" ;  

here x=the consequence/result "फल-".

  

So you may be opening a Pandora's box.
