Megh Kalyanasundaram-ji

  

Thank you for sharing this gem!

  

During high school (40+ years ago) in our Sanskrit first language course we had a lesson called "ujjayinIvarNanaM" contaning about 6 selected verses from meghadUta. All the verses are still on my toungue tip.

  

I was so happy to listen to them again by none other than ShrI Dr. Nagaraja Rao!

  

Except for these two he covered all the others from "ujjayinIvarNanaM".

"हारांस्तारां ... सलिलनिधयस्तोयमात्रावशेषाः" and

"ज्वालोद्गीर्णै...वनितापादरागाङ्कितेषु"

  

Regards

Prabhu

  

(ps: The recent events, unfortunately, involving Ujjaini and the mahAkAla temple is a sad commentary on where things are today :-( )
