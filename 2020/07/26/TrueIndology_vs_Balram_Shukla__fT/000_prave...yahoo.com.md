Last week, a group of Twitter users, including the anonymous Twitter handle known as True Indology (@TIinExile), launched a series of attacks on Dr. Balram Shukla. Dr. Balram Shukla is a distinguished scholar in the world of Indological studies. With perfect command over Sanskrit, Prakrit, Urdu, Persian, and other languages, he has made remarkable contributions to the studies of literatures and cultures of these languages, broadening the horizons of comparative literature and culture. With fictitious citations and views incorrectly attributed to him, some members of the aforesaid group used improper language against Dr. Shukla. We as scholars, intellectuals, and authors from diverse fields of cultural and intellectual life in this country and beyond would like to condemn the attack on the integrity and intent of Dr. Balram Shuklaâ€™s scholarship. We speak both as inheritors and interpreters of the great culture of plurality, debate, and democracy cherished in Indian intellectual traditions. We are equally committed to the democratic values and traditions of our contemporary social and political life.

India has always been a multi-lingual and multi-cultural country. Some groups which have surfaced during the past few decades on social media and other platforms are making vicious attempts at tarnishing its unique cultural mosaic. It is the need of the hour that all sensible persons should stand to resist such moves leading to the erosion of ethics and values, which have been the hallmark of our cultural and intellectual traditions.
