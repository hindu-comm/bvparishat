I do not know what is the action point in the petition.

  

It says it condemns the behaviour of a 'group' on twitter.

  

Such 'groups' on the public platform like Twitter are not any organized group with any organized membership and the identities of most members not clear.

  

As Prof. Varakhedi recommended fact check , I tried to check the mahaaraNyamof tweets around this topic .

  

I found the following:

  

The issue seems to be about whether Dara Shi(u)ko(h) knew Sanskrit or not.

  

The TIinExile's claim seems to be that Dara Shi(u)ko(h) did not know Sanskrit.

  

He seems to have been responding to some video where he thought that Dr Balram Shukla claimed that Dara Shi(u)ko(h) knew Sanskrit.

  

While TIinExileseems to have shown great regard and veneration for Dr Balram Shukla and appologizedto Dr Balram Shukla

  

Some of the Tweets from TIinExile:

  

----------------------

  

Dr. Shukla blocked me after abusing me and calling me "filth". This was after I apologised to him if my words ever hurt him and accepted every correction he demanded. I do not KNOW why he was so angry and abusive. 

I wish him the best

agree. Infighting doesn't help Dharmic cause. Which is why I want to put an end to this conflict from my end. 

It began with a minor debate on whether or not Dara knew Sanskrit. It led to bad blood because the other side is rigid. So be it. But I don't think it important (1/n).

I made a remark on Dr.Shukla's ideology when I called him "Sarva Dharma Sambhav". I regret it & I apologized for it. I just "disagree" with Shukla's ideology. But I admired his scholarship. Never contested anything he said. Just asked another person to provide a primary source

There is probably more to it than I could know from my verification.

  

But I wanted to share that there were some healthy expressions from TIinExile.

  

Regarding the so called 'fans' / 'supporters' of TIinExile, their language, their expressions in the discussion, we can only say that there can be no control from any one, on who says what on Twitter, not even from the one to whom these groups claim to be fans/supporters. Such are not stable , fixed membership, controlled, organized groups.

  

It is unfortunate that respectable scholars like Dr Balram Shukla get to face such treatment from such trolls.

  

But that is how these SM seem to be. If we are on them for some benefit we should be prepared for the other side of the consequence.

  

Petitions may be of little help in this regard.
