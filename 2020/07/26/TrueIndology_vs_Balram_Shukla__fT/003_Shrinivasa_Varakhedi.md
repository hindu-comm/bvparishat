In continuation of what I wrote, I would like to express my unhappiness of some of the BVP members using abusive language in respect of some senior and respected members of BVP and about some institutions that are serving our heritage in a greater way….recently I noticed some bad remarks about Indic Academy and its members. We can express our disagreements with particular stand or act, but we can not degrade or demean any one. BVP members must maintain some discipline and control over their public statements in the list.

  

I have written this after repeated observations.  

  

Warm regards,  

Shrinivasa Varakhedi
