Another dimension worth noting here is flattery. One of the most horrible things in the world. Father manu rightly said: "सम्मानाद्ब्राह्मणो नित्यमुद्विजेत विषादिव । अमृतस्येव चाकाङ्क्षेदवमानस्य सर्वदा ।।". The more one is flattered by vidharmi-s for being such a "moderate intelligent secular" etc.., the more the unworthy mask becomes part of one's personality. Applies to allegedly pro-Hindutva governments as well as individuals. One begins to do/ say disgusting things just to get some more praise/ approval.  
  
Easier said than done, of course and very hard to resist. (Just the other day, I was duped into buying 2k worth of produce we didn't really need for 4k by a pair of very intelligent "villagers" who kept distracting me by going on and on about how much the respect brAhmaNa-s and would never cheat them.)
