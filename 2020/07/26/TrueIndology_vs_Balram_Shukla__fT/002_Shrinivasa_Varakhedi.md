Dear Scholars,

  

It is really not a good sign of scholarship to abuse a scholar for his stand. Dr. Balaram Shukla is a very genuine and committed scholar of varied interests. Such an erudite must be treated with dignity. We the members of BVP will condemn the way of abusive tweets. Ignorance or intention, not acceptable.

  

I tried to follow some tweets in this particular dispute, But, I could not trace how the debate slipped from its track. We would be glad if someone shares the summary of what was the debate. In any case such incidents are not to be encouraged. I don’t.

  

Warm regards,  

Shrinivasa Varakhedi
