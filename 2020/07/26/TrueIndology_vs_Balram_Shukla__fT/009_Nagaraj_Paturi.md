This shows that TIinExile considers Dr Balramshukla and his supporters as "in"(siders) .

  

But TIinExile also says

while also adding,

The petitioners are talking about " Cultural Mosaic" and
"multiculturalism" etc.

  

Probably that is what is being called as Ganga Jamuna Tahjeeband being opposed by those who disagree with the ideology.

  

By sending a request to those who are not considered by the likes of TIinExile as ' "in"(siders) ' to join, the petitioners seem to be making it clear to TIinExile that they are not "in"(siders)" and TIinExile is right in disagreeing if he does, with their ideology.
