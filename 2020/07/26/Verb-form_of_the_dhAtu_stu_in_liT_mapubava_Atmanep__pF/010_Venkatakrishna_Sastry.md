Namaste



Sorry on behalf of the machine! Yes. Machines did their 'auto-correction' without asking the writer! 



I am looking at 'how scripting- proofing' was done. It is not on 'how Panini composed'.



There needs to be a way to distinguish ' Human errors' from ' Machine introduced, Machine corrected human input', 'Auto-corrects', 'Dict- introduced errors'.



This problem was not faced by Panini and Patanjali and many classical writers in the dark ages before ' internet digital communicaiton'!



Please help me to a reference, if any, where Patanjali points to a method on how 'Acharya Panini' \[ who with great effort ' narrated
( praninaaya) Ashtaadhyayi' \] got proofing of the scripted text .




Despite the machine corrected typos, the human reader is still blessed with a 'self-correct to read and grasp the intended communication in the mail !
