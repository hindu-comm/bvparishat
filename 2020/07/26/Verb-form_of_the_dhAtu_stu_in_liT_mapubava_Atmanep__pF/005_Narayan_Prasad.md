Thank you, sir, for your comments.

  

In 2008, I gave the derivation exercise to a foreigner learning Sanskrit grammar.

His reply is attached (as MS Word). I checked his step-by-step derivation. But I could not find any mistakes.

The summary of different verb-forms is given at the end of this file.

  

Here is my reply given to him.

'\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Everything appears to be OK. However, please see also the variants in Atmanepada verb-forms in dhAturatnAkara (p.312, col.1 in the scanned file), which are wrong in my opinion.

 In mAdhaviiyA-dhAtuvRtti, the verb-form corresponding to "-dhve" suffix is printed as "tuSTudhve". This also is wrong in my opinion.

 VyAkarana-candrodayadoesn't appear to provide the Atmanepada verb-forms for the dhAtu "stu" in liT lakAra.

 rUpacandrikA doesn't include verb-formsfor the dhAtu "stu".

 Thus you will realize the significance of one's own knowledge in Panini.
