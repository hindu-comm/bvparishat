Namaste  

  

This is why reputed authors must invest money in getting out error free books.

  

There was a British Math professor writing a book. He posted every page he wrote daily on the notice board and challenged students to find any mistake. If a student found a mistake he was awarded 10 British pounds. In the end the book written had Zero mistakes.

  

Grammarians should follow this example. Now with Internet it should be easier for students to point mistakes and get money.
