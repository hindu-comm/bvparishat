Namaste



Out of Curisoty ( call it a cat cusriosity , for lightening the mood)



What training method was used in tradition to ' author' to
scribe/ getscribed error free, internally consistent work like ' Panini's Ashtaadhyayi' (700 BCE circa), Patanjali Mahabhashya ( circa 200 BCE), Buddhist Tripitakas, Acharya Bhashyas ( 600 C.E to 1400 CE)?
\[ I am deliberately keeping out of oral recension tradition of Vedas, itihasa and Kavyas\].



How did they overcome the human memory challenges and scripting errors -corrections ?





Helpful hints would be appreciated.



Regards

BVK Sastry
