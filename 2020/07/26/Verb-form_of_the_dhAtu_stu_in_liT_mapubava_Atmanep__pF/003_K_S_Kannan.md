We used to hear the remark of exclamation and dejection

viz. "Doctors differ!".

And now we know the same doctor can differ  

*from himself* - at different points of time!

  

I had considered *Dhāturatnākara* as an unparalleled *magnum opus.*

But Sri Prasad has shown us the differences between  

different editions of the same work!

  

Earlier, I had shown how certain errors persisted in even the later editions of  

the work of another giant viz. Charudeva Shastri!

  

Speaking of another grammatical work on verbal forms of another reputed grammarian,

we have the unbeatable example of an errata of ONLY 50 pages

in the *Dhāturūpa-prakāśikā* of Śrīkaṇṭha Śāstri !
