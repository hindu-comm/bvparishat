Great model, Venkatesh Murthy-ji!

I had heard that Nirnaya Sagara Press used to announce  

a \[covetable\] prize of Rs. 100/= for every mistake pointed out  

(perhaps for the first fellow who would do it).

  

The model of Bourbaki is also there

\- of a group of French mathematicians who produced unbeatable books

in terms of the correctness of content, and its unsurpassable finesse.

Their modus operandi was to meet once a month or so,

and the prescribed job of each of the members was to tear apart

the paper presented of one of their own folk, so that

an improved version answering to all the objections/desiderata

was presented the next time. The process would get reiterated multiple times,

and finally a perfected version received in the world of high mathematicians

with unadulterated praise became the norm.

  

Dr. Vineet Chaitanya has implemented the same scheme in his NLP project commendably.

  

And finally, the example of the Gita Press.

Should a printing error happen, they would correct the same with an ink-pen

in all of the 10000 copies or so before releasing the same to the shops!

Such dedication!
