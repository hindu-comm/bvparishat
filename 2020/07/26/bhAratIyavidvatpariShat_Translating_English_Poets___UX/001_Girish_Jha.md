Dear Aniketa Ji

Samuchitashatam.

कुशाग्रबुद्धे सुरवाक्प्रबुद्ध

नामानुरूपा तव भाति बुद्धिः।

आस्वाद्य पद्यं हि सुरम्यभावं

सद्यो मनः प्रीतिमुपावहन्मे।।

I am delighted to relish the sweet rasa of your slokas.In least I would like to give you an unwanted but humble and useful suggestion that you should study 2 books,viz.लघुसिद्धान्तकौमुदी and तर्कसङ्ग्रह with the help of simple and lucid explanations,if

you have spare time.

Kindest regards
