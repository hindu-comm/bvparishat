Dear List Members,

  

According to the following Wikipedia post, drawing upon the 2nd volume of Samsad Bangali Caritabhidhana, published by Sahitya Samsad, it seems that Mahamahopadhyaya Dr. Srijiva Nyayatirtha(26 January,1893-28 October,1992) completed a Hindi translation of the Nilakanthi commentary on the Mahabharata in the year 1983:

Does anyone have access to the above Hindi translation? I would be grateful for any relevant information, etc.  

  

Best regards,

Yourssincerely
