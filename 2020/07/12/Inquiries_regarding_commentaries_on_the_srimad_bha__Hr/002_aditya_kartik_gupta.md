Hare Krishna ,

  

Dandavat Pranam Prabhuji ,

  

to the above as a humble response and followup , i have another few following inquiries -

  

\(1\)

****Gaurakishora Anvaya****

****Svananda-Kunjanuvad****

****Ananta Gopal-Tathya****

****Sindhu-Baibhav-Vivriti****

****commentaries of** *Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur -* Are they exclusive individual archives / compilations / books of commentaries , or , are they all included in the umbrella under the ****gaudiya Bhasya****

if the above 4 commentaries are accessible in physical form ****** ****a***nywhere / any institution , can they be obtained*** ? they were all published by circa 1935 .

  

\(2\) i saw ****sri padmamukha nimai Das Jis archive library**** - and there is the ****Gaudiya Bhasya**** of Srila Bhaktisiddhanta saraswati thakur ( SB commentary ) but not sure which one is it of the 4 in (1) or is it a compilation of all 4 ? please clarify ?

  

\(3\) any consistent****hindi translation****physical copy or sanskrit physical copy of a focused ****Srila sridhara swamis commentary on bhavartha dipika**** and also (4) is sripad vamshidhara swamis tika bhavartha dipika prakash a ****followup****and expansive explanation to bhavartha dipika of srila sridhara swami and is that available too for parallel study with bhavartha dipika and is it recommended for parallel study ?

  

\(5\) ****the Bhagavata tatparya nirnaya of sripad anandatirtha madhvacharya prabhupada and the Sri subhodini of Sri Vallabhaacharya Thakurpada are very concise commentaries on srimad bhagavat mahapurana**** ,

any light over as to range of both commentaries ,

 the range of discussions , the focus ,

cantos discussed and commented upon and also ---->

one who has studied the preliminary Srimad bhagavatam in Srila Prabhupada's works , how should they followup with the concise works of these two acharyas ,

          ^**any physical copy available of these two** ? ^

  

\(6\) are any physical / digital copies of ****sarartha darsini ( all cantos ) and vaishnavanandini**** available for study ?

  

\(7\) the revered pioneer devotional treatise of ****caitanya mata manjusha**** , is it available digitally / physical copy ?

  

\(8\) for krama sandarbha , laghu vaishnava and brhad vaishnava tosani ----> any light as to over what are the preliminary commentaries after srila prabhupadas bhaktivedanta purports one must study and is advised to study ------ so as to then read the above works ^ ? are these available in original tika sanskrit form physical / digital copy ? ( **as u mentioned to study krama sandarbha , jiva goswami assumes one has studied srila sridharacharya** )

  

\(9\) the brhad krama sandarbha - what is the range of this commentary and its author , any availability ?

  

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_finally \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  

\(10\) a humble request , please do provide a **good pathway / pedagogy for study of commentaries** and which ones should we go on about step by step **so as to have a smooth study of the bhagavatam** , ( the pre requisites i have already done - i have covered and studied the srimad bhagavatam of srila prabhupada via the manual of bhurijana prabhu for 1st 4 cantos and the last 2 11th and 12 th cantos , the primary intermediate and final cantos have been covered by me by following direct purports and lectures of srila prabhupada along with sri srimad radha govinda goswami maharaj ji's beautiful lectures )

  

praying this message finds you in the ever wonderful grace of devotional nectar and in the pink of health
