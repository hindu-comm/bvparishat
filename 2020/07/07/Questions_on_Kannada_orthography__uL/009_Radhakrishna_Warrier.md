On a lighter note, here is my three-and-a-half year old grandson pronouncing the aspirate ch with considerable aspiration üôÇ

  

The little guy speaks three languages - English that he speaks outside his home and with his friends in the daycare, Malayalam that his father speaks to him and Kannada that his mother speaks to him. He has started reading words in English. His dad taught him Malayalam letters and he can read simple words like aana (elephant) and amma (mother). Here his mother is teaching him Kannada letters through "high tech" means.
