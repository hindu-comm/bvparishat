Dear list members

  

The attached image is from a Kannada newspaper. Some questions on Kannada orthography—

  

1\) Why is Jharkhand spelt with ಜಾ (जा) and not ಝಾ (झा)?

  

2\) Why is Chhattisgarh spelt with ಚ (च) and not ಛ (छ)?

  

3\) Why does the spelling of Jharkhand end with ಖಂಡ್ (without schwa) when the spelling of Uttarakhand ends with ಖಂಡ (with schwa)?

  

Is this always the case or is this publication an exception?

  

Thanks, Nityananda
