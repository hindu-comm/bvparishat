1) Why is Jharkhand spelt with ‡≤ú‡≤æ (‡§ú‡§æ) and not ‡≤ù‡≤æ (‡§ù‡§æ)?

  

This is not limited to Kannada alone. In all south Indian languages many newspapers and other publications do this. In the other thread on the same topic, I have given examples of the same in Malayalam. The reason is that aspirate (mahAprANa) sounds are not natural to Dravidian languages. They came into Dravidian languages from Sanskrit and Prakrit. In spite of centuries, and perhaps millennia of contact with these sounds, many speakers of south Indian languages find it difficult to pronounce these sounds which leads to mispronunciation.
Mispronunciation leads to errors in transcription.

  

2) Why is Chhattisgarh spelt with ‡≤ö (‡§ö) and not ‡≤õ (‡§õ)?

  

Same answer as above. ‡§õ is mahAprANa, hence substitution by non-aspirate ‡§ö.

  

3) Why does the spelling of Jharkhand end with ‡≤ñ‡≤Ç‡≤°‡≥ç (without schwa) when the spelling of Uttarakhand ends with ‡≤ñ‡≤Ç‡≤° (with schwa)?

  

Unlike north Indian languages, south Indian languages pronounce the word final hrasva (short) 'a'.  I am not sure if this is to be called a schwa. A schwa for me is a samvrta ukaara (very short u) found in Malayalam and Tamil. The word final short a is a short a for the south Indian. Nothing short of it. üôÇ .

  

Why does Jharkhand end with‡≤ñ‡≤Ç‡≤°‡≥ç in Kannada while Uttarakhand ends with‡≤ñ‡≤Ç‡≤°? This is just an inconsistency I found in Kannada. I have seen HAsan bound buses with destination written inconsistently as‡≤π‡≤æ‡≤∏‡≤®
(HAsana) and as  ‡≤π‡≤æ‡≤∏‡≤®‡≥ç (HAsan), but haven't heard a single person pronouncing the place name as HAsana with a word final short a. Same with ‡≤ß‡≤æ‡≤∞‡≤µ‡≤æ‡≤°‡≥ç and ‡≤ß‡≤æ‡≤∞‡≤µ‡≤æ‡≤° . The tendency of adding a hrasva 'a' in writing where none exists in pronunciation is more in the northern parts of Karnataka.
