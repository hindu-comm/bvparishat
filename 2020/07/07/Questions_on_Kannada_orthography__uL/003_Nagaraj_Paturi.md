MahaapraaNajha in the beginning of a word is a very rare occurrence in the phonemic distribution in many Indian , particularly south Indian languages.

  

Very few words have a padaadijhakaara. Even those which have are tatsama words.

  

Most of the jhakaaraadi words are onomatopoeic. ಝಾಮ್ಮಂತ , ఝామ్మని, ఝుమ్మని etc.

  

That explains the change of the mahaapraaNajhakaarainto alpapraaNajakaaraduring borrowing and localization of words into these languages.
