The same happens in Malayalam too - both in newspapers and on the internet. They write JƒÅrkha·πá·∏ç (‡¥ú‡¥æ‡µº‡¥ñ‡¥£‡µç‡¥°‡µç) instead of JhƒÅrkha·πá·∏ç (‡¥ù‡¥æ‡µº‡¥ñ‡¥£‡µç‡¥°‡µç). Sometimes the ignorance of journalists and netizens go to the extent of confusing jha (‡¥ù) as a conjunct letter of ta (‡¥§) and dha (‡¥ß) because of its shape üôÇ.

  

Aspirated (mahaapraana) letters came to South Indian languages from Sanskrit and Prakrits. Excepting Tamil, other south Indian languages had these letters for centuries and perhaps millennia, but many people are still unable to pronounce these correctly.
