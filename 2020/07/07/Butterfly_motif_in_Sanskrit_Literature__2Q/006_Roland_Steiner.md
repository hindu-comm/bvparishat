\> Ancient Tamil literature refers to butterfly and uses a Sanskrit word  
\> 'इन्द्रगोप:'. Looking up the dictionary, the meaning is found to be  
\> 'firefly' not butterfly. Tamil commentaries give the meaning as butterfly,  
\> though.  
  

Patrick Olivelle remarks to the meaning of *indragopa* in the *Arthaśāstra*: "precise zoological species unclear; refers to the tiny bright-red velvet mites (*Thrombidiiae*) that appear in large numbers early in the rainy season. K\[auṭilya’s\] A\[rthaśāstra\] 14.1.10. \[earlier translations of firefly and cochineal inaccurate (so Lienhard).\]" (*King, Governance, and Law in Ancient India. Kauṭilya’s Arthaśāstra*. A New Annotated Translation by P. Olivelle. Oxford 2013. 2013: p. 443)
