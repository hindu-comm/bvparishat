My thanks to Prof. Isaacson. I now consider it quite likely that citra-pataṅga stands for ‘butterfly’. Pataṅga does commonly refer to (fast flying) creatures (going round and round) in Sanskrit, Hindi, Urdu. etc. Citra could easily have been added to pataṅga to capture its distinctive feature.

    "चित्रपतङ्ग" seem to be coined words.

As far as I can see this is indeed the case of चित्रशलभ; but the word चित्रपतङ्ग has

a few attestations in ancient authors. The earliest one which I can spot right now

is the famous Buddhist philosopher Dharmakīrti. See this verse of the pratyakṣa section of

his Pramāṇavārttika:

This is from the edition by Rāhula Sāṅkṛtyāyana with the commentary of Manorathanandin;

note that Manorathanandin mentions nīla and pīta as among the colours

of the citrapataṅga. I don't know how certain it is, but it certainly seems

plausible that citrapataṅga here does refer to what is called in

English a butterfly.
