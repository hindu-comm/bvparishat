The coined words deserve to be made popular in Skt.

  

Contrary to expectation, “butterfly” is not based — at least directly –– on any objective reality. I heard it about three decades ago from a good authority (Prof. George Cardona) that it is just a changed form of “flutter-by”).

Virtuallynil, according to my search. There does not seem to be a word denoting a "butterfly". "चित्रशलभ" "चित्रपतङ्ग" seem to be coined words. Here is an example of its usage \[—> use\].

"चित्रशलभमभिधावसि चेत्त्वं तं ग्रहीष्यसि कदापि न मित्र ।

त्वं भविष्यसि यदा निरपेक्षः स्वैरमेव स उपैति खलु त्वाम् ॥"
