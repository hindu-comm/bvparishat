Namaste,

  

The word, Indragopa occurs in 41st nama of Lalita Sahasranama, इन्द्रगोपपरिक्षिप्तस्मरतूणाभजङ्घिका, where it is translated as 'glow-worm' by most of the English translators, while Bhaskararaya describes it as a red-coloured insect that is seen in rainy season - इन्द्रगोपाः प्रावृषेण्या आरक्ततमाः कृमिविशेषाः.  

  

regards  
shankara
