Returning to the earlier topic: G.S.S. Murty had written

-   "There does not seem to be a word denoting a "butterfly". चित्रशलभ"
    "चित्रपतङ्ग" seem to be coined words.

As far as I can see this is indeed the case of चित्रशलभ; but the word चित्रपतङ्ग has

a few attestations in ancient authors. The earliest one which I can spot right now

is the famous Buddhist philosopher Dharmakīrti. See this verse of the pratyakṣa section of

his Pramāṇavārttika:

This is from the edition by Rāhula Sāṅkṛtyāyana with the commentary of Manorathanandin;

note that Manorathanandin mentions nīla and pīta as among the colours

of the citrapataṅga. I don't know how certain it is, but it certainly seems

plausible that citrapataṅga here does refer to what is called in

English a butterfly.
