Virtuallynil, according to my search. There does not seem to be a word denoting a "butterfly". "चित्रशलभ" "चित्रपतङ्ग" seem to be coined words. Here is an example of its usage.

"चित्रशलभमभिधावसि चेत्त्वं तं ग्रहीष्यसि कदापि न मित्र ।

त्वं भविष्यसि यदा निरपेक्षः स्वैरमेव स उपैति खलु त्वाम् ॥"

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
