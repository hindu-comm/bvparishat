Hari Om!

Indragopa is a red-backed insect that is seen before the rainy season.

  

As far as butterfly in Sanskrit literature is concerned, I know Manish Walvekar from Amrita University, Bengaluru, who is working on this

Recently he had a Facebook live talk on this research (in Marathi)

He could be reached at 97574 05466
