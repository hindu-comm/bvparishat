Real research by Prof, Isaacson. It is possible that it refers to the butterfly. It could also refer to some chameleonic insect, if indeed there is. What causes me anguish is that an ubiquitous insect goes virtually unobserved by the poets. Were they poring over writings of previous poets and forgot to raise their head?

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
