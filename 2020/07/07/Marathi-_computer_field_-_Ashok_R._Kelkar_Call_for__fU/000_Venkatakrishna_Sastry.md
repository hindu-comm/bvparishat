Namaste



I am sharing a paper from the link
<http://www.ciil-ebooks.net/html/kelkar/html1/c41.htm> - Written by Ashok.R.Kelkar , under the title: COMPUTER LANGUAGE AND OUR LANGUAGE.

The occasion for the essay was the seminar cum exhibition entitled
‘Sanganakānī Marathi under the auspices of the Marathi Abhyas Parishad at Purne on 23-24 June 1990.



*The select part of the paper reads* :



This means we mustn’t hesitate to make use of our own language, Marathi, in the computer field. Then alone we shall find our way to adapting imported programmes to our own special needs and if need be to setting then aside in favor of new programmes of our own making.

Otherwise, between us helpless clients and the computer the computer people will stand like obdurate temple priest rather than user friendly helpful guides. They would rather dump into our laps imported programmes unsuited to our needs rather than take the trouble of fashioning innovative programmes.

Again, otherwise we the clients will be found wanting in an ability to present our needs with precision and clarity to the intermediaries between us and the computer. Indeed our inability in this regard may be a want of application on our part. We shall remain in articulate in ordering and communicating the contents of our minds. **The Marathi language and the Marathi speakers will suffer from a debility. **

Bringing the computer and the Marathi language together is our pressing need today. To adapt the seven-hundred-year-old words of the great Dnyaneshvar, in this city of Marathi let computer-lore abound and flourish. If we fail, then in computer city we shall remain mere onlookers and porters, dump compliers, at best factotums, but not entrepreneurs, controllers, or inventors. **The call for Marathi is not a call for swadeshi. Rather the call for Marathi is a call for swaraj, for autonomy**.



I am looking for more information on the development of this thought
and people who have worked on this.
