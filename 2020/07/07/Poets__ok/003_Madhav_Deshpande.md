Poets

  

“सक्तुमिव तितउना पुनन्त:” ते कवीश्वरा: ।

कुर्वन्ति मनसा वाचं तान् नमामि दिवानिशम् ।।

“सक्तुमिव तितउना पुनन्तो यत्र धीरा मनसा वाचमक्रत” ऋग्वेद (१०।७१।२)

  

The great poets create poetic language with their mind “purifying her like coarse grain by a sieve.” I offer my salutations to those poets day and night.

  

The description “purifying her like coarse grain by a sieve,” comes from the Rigveda \[10/71/2\], the oldest known religious poetry from India.
