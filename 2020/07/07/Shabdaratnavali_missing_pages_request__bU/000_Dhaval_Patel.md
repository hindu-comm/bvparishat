Dear Scholars,

If anyone of you have access to this work, kindly share with me the second page of the table of content and the first page of Śabdaratnāvalī of Mathureśa.

<https://archive.org/details/SabdarRatnavaliAsiaticSocietyMathuresa_201710/mode/2up> seems to be missing these two pages.

With regards,

Dr. Dhaval Patel, I.A.S

Collector and District Magistrate, Surat
