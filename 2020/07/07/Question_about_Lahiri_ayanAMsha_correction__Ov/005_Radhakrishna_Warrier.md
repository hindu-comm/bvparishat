As an example, if a person was born under the nAL (= day = asterism) of
mUlam (=asterism mUla) in the month of mEDam (mEsha), his birthday will be celebrated each year in the month of mEDam and on the day of mUlam.
If there happens to be two mUlams in a particular mEDam (because there only 27 asterisms but 30, 31 or even 32 days in a month), the second mUlam is chosen for celebrating the birthday.
