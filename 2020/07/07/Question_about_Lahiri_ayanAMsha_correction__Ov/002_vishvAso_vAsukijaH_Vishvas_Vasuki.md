Here is what I understand so far:

-   The committee created a civil solar calendar (equinox to equinox), a
    religious solar calendar based on a fixed ayanAMsha(=deviation from
    equinoctial colure)(23° 15’) to prevent further drift from seasons,
    a religious lunar calendar closely tied to the religious solar
    calendar, a asterism tracking variable ayanAMsha (23° 15’ 0”, with
    annual correction) for the nakShatra wheel. The reason for
    standardizing religious calendars was to be able to determine office
    holidays.

  
As far as religious calendars are concerned, the above standardization (barring the variable ayanAMsha for nakShatra divisions) was a compromise to prevent a violent break from current traditions. Basing the solar and lunar calendars on a fixed ayanAMsha prevents further drift of festivals from seasons, regardless of further drift of corresponding nakShatra-s.

  

The variable ayanAMsha for nakShatra divisions has its pros (everlasting tie to corresponding asterisms) and cons (not being tropical, eventual drift of official lunar months from full moon in the corresponding naxatra-s).

-   So, panchAnga-makers using this self-correcting (chitra at \~ 180
    deg) ayanAMsha will in a way produce (partly) satisfactory
    naxatra-date matches. Good enough for names, sankalpa-s and such.
    Complete satisfaction is not possible anyway! The wise should use
    appropriately tropicalized naxatra divisions instead where season is
    important (eg. sarpa-bali, vasanta-panchamI, sharat-pUrNimA,
    yajur-upAkarma, ayanArambha-s, ratha-saptamI, possibly puNya-naxatra
    determination).

  

Please let me know of errors.  

  

So, as far as naxatra divisions are concerned, the calendar reform committee clearly intended something close to "True Chitra" (but a very small offset away). If so, it makes sense for swisseph folks to:

  

\- Fix the lahiri ayanAMsha documentation appropriately  

\- Add the calendar reform committee's variable naxatra ayanAMsha.
