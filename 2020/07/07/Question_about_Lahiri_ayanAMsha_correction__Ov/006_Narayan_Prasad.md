\<\< I believe the term "sAyana" means correcting for this precession and "nirayaNa" means not applying any correction for the precession. Am I right?\>\>  

  

Nirayana means taking the origin of the zodiac as a fixed point with respect to the position of a star, be that origin exactly at 180 deg. away from Chitra, or whatever.

This is useful for Indian astrology, because it is based on nakshatras. Of course, it is a different affair that it uses equal division of the nakshatras for convenience in calculations, instead of their actual positions.

  

In the case of Nirayana zodiac, the position of the start of Mesha is a fixedpoint and can be exactly determined by observation. But in the case of Sayana zodiac, you require the exact location of the vernal equinox which is not a fixed point and hence it has to be computed.

  

In brief, the Nirayana zodiac has a fixed origin, whereas the Sayana zodiac has a variable origin.

  

\<\<The requirement that the nakshatra is also to be taken into consideration can be met by celebrating in the appropriate month, on the day the moon is in the required asterism.\>\>

  

Do you have access to any such published calendar? I would like to have a look at it.

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
