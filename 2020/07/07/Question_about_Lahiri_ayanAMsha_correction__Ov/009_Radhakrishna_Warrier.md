Yes, Shri Vishwas Vasuki is right. Vishu and Makara Sankranti have slipped by 22 days. So, the Kerala calendar is also not considering the precession of equinoxes.

Albeit, this is false. IIUC in KeraLa as in TN, people follow the siderial (not tropical/ sAyana) solar calendar. There is an obvious problem even there, which you have stated. Slowly festivals shift away from the appropriate seasons. You easily see this when mallu-s celebrate "vishu" \~ 22 days after actual viShuva (equinox).
