Namaste

  

Principle at work - If you can't convince then confuse.

  

Abhijit Nakshatra is overlapping with Uttarashadha mostly and a little bit Shravana. It is from 6 degrees 40 minutes to 10 degrees 53 minutes and 20 seconds in Nirayana Makara Rashi. The other 27 Nakshatras are each taken as 13 degrees 20 minutes.
