I quote from <https://www.astro.com/swisseph/swisseph.htm#_Toc19109057> :  

  
The standard definition of the Indian ayanamsha (“Lahiri” ayanamsha) was originally introduced in 1955 by the Indian Calendar Reform Committee (23°15' 00" on the 21 March 1956, 0:00 Ephemeris Time). The definition was corrected in Indian Astronomical Ephemeris 1989, page 556, footnote:

"According to new determination of the location of equinox this initial value has been revised to and used in computing the mean ayanamsha with effect from 1985'."

Does this correction mean that Lahiri Ayanamsha is same as True Chitrapaksha ayanamsha (Spica is always exactly at 180° or 0° Libra in ecliptic longitude)?
