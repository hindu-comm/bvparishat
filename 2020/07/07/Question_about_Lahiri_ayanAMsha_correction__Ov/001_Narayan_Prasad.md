\<\<It was the Indian astronomy historian S. B. Dixit (also written Dikshit), who first proposed in 1896 that the zodiac should be oriented towards the star Spica (Citra in Sanskrti), in his important work History of Indian Astronomy (= Bharatiya Jyotih Shastra\>\>

  

BTW, I have the original Marathi edition ofभारतीय ज्योतिषशास्त्र, 3rd edition, 1989 (scan of the cover page attached).. I do not have access to its English translation.

I could not locate the above statement anywhere in the book.
