Namaste.

  

In all this lengthy exposition, I do not find the simple and straight-forward statement that the National Calendar is nothing but a Sayana Calendar, in which the lunar months, viz.,Chaitra, Vaisakha, etc are a misnomer, because this calendar has nothing to do with the actual nakshatras -अश्विनी, भरणी, कृत्तिका, रोहिणी, आर्द्रा, ...,चित्रा, ..., विशाखा, etc.

A better nomenclature for the lunar months would be to adopt the season-based months,मधु, माधव, etc.

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
