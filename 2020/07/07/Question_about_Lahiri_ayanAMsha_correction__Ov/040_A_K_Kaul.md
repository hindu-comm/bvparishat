Dear Shri G S S Murthy,

Jai Shri Ram!

\<I am sorry, I didn't know. I have copy-pasted after shortening it on to a Word doc and it has worked for me.

Hope this works.\>

Yes, it did work!

The twelve unequal divisions of Greek constellations got linked to twelve equal astrological signs Aries, Taurus, Gemini etc. of similar names by Chaldean and later Greek astrologers more so when the March (Vernal) Equinox entered from the Aries constellation (pl, note "Constellation" and not astrological sign!) in -67 AD i.e. around 68 BCE into Pisces constellation.

As per the attachment "Meeus Constellations0" and "Meeus-Constellations" from "Mathematical Astronomy Morsels " by Jean Meeus

Quote

Two thousand years ago the constellationsand the sings did match approximately, but in fact the exact coincidence can never occur. The reason is obvious. While by definition, each astrological sign is 30° long, the actual constellations occupy different lengths along the ecliptic!

..........

That year (-67AD) the beginning of sign Aries coincided, on the ecliptic, with the Western boundaryof the like-named constellation.
Not until AD 2597 will the March equinox cross the boundary into Aquarius

Unquote

Some scholars like Anand Sharan claim that that was the reason of starting "Vikramaditya Era" around from that period of -68 AD (57 BCE is when Vikramaditya Era is supposed to have started) AD through back calculations by some astronomers of India in Guptaperiod.

That was the reason as to why the VE was known as "First Point of Aries" --- मेषारम्भ बिन्दु but nowadaysit is no longer like that.

Similarly, Capricorn ingress i.e. the (tropical) Makar Samkranti is no longer in Capricornus constellation but in Sagittarius where from it will cross into Ophiuchus constellation in 2269 AD.

Thus astrological Rashis of equal divisions, whether Sayana or nirayana, are unrelated to their namesake constellations of unequal divisions.

The names Aries=Mesha, Taurus=Vishabha and so on got subsumed into ---aligned with---the names of Vedic and Pauranicseasonal months of Madhava, Shukrah, Shuchih and so on!

Regarding stars, the Vedic nakshatras had nothing to do with any Mesha etc. Rashis which were conspicuous by their absence then. A greater part of the Vedic lore does talk about Abhijit and even pays obeisance to the same like to other27 nakshatras!

Nakshatras are neither nirayana nor saayana, since Acharya Lagadha has not linked them to any Rashi, nor has Maitrayani Upanishad done so.
They have been linked to various seasons, but as the latter are impervious to the effects of precession whereas the nakshtras are subject to precession, they cannot be linked permanently the seasons either! That is why we find the Uttarayana having slipped from Shravishtha-ardha of Maitrayani to Shravishthaa-aadau in the Vedanga Jyotisha of Lagadha!

As you might have observed from my mail just sent regarding
"Dakshinayana on July 16", there are quite a few ''astrologers" who do not appear to have read even Primary school level Geography books as otherwise, they would have known the definition of Dakshinayana (Summer Solstice), even if they clung/cling to Lahiri Karkata Samkranti!  

That is really the most ironical part!  

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
