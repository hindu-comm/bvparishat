Namaste

  

You are absolutely right. TN and Kerala follow Solar calendars but they are Nirayana. The goal of Nirayana is to be faithful to Nakshatras. The Nakshatras are fixed in the sky and they dont change position with time. Seasons keep changing because of Precession. If there are environmental changes there will be more changes in seasons.

  

We have seen how suddenly we get heavy rains in summer because of Cyclones and other environmental factors. Some years the monsoon fails and there will be very less or no rain at all. Then will you give up Naga Panchami because there is no rain? Will you give up Krishna Janmastami because there is no rain? Sometimes there is rain on Rama Navami day. Will you give up Rama Navami because there is no Spring but rain? It is silly.
