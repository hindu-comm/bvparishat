Dear Shri Radhakrishna Warrier,

Jai Shri Ram!

\<To put my understanding in slightly different words, if the calendar is corrected for the precession of the equinoxes, the months will be in sync with the seasons but the asterism (nakshatra such asअश्विनी, भरणी ...) in which the sun happens to be for a particular month will drift through the seasons as time passes. In about 2150 years, the drift would be roughly the equivalent of a month. In 25772 years, the drift will complete one full cycle, or 360 degrees, covering all seasons. So, names like Chaitra, Vaishakha may not be suitable for the months because the correlation between the month and the asterism breaks because of the precession of the equinoxes. Madhu, Maadhava, ... may be better names for the months.\>

There is separate a chapter in the Surya Siddhanta named "Nakshatra Graha Yuti Adhikaar".

It gives the methodology of calculating the timings of conjunctions of different planets with different "Fixed stars" which are of similar names as those of the equal/unequal nakshatra divisions.

Similarly, if the "fixed stars" were really fixed as per earlier astronomers why do their longitudes differ from one anotherin different siddhantas?

Bhaskaracharya-II also has given the details of calculating "Bh-Graha-yuti" as per the attachment "Bhaskaracharya--". He has advised to make "Ayanamsha corrections"

 The question arises as to what was the need of such a separate chapter if equal nakshatra division was to be followed by astrologers or panchangas the world over.  

The best solution about this nakshatra confusion is to follow the Vedic way:

1\. There were/are no Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis, whether Sayana or Nirayana, in any of the Vedas and/or Vedangas.

2\. The Vedic seers celebrated their rituals without the help of Mesha etc Rashis.

3. They worshipped nakshatras as living and vibrating deities and not as artificial divisions!

4. Then last but not the least is that we find innumerable references to nakshatras in the Mahabharata e.g. Blarama is supposed to have left on Pushya and returned on Shravana day after 40 days !

चत्वारिंशदहान्यद्यद्वे च मे निःसृतस्य वै\| पुष्येन संप्रयातोस्मि श्रवणे पुनरागतः \|\|(भीष्म पर्व 17/2/6) (Gita Press edition )

Here the moon could not be in an artificial divisions of nakshatras but must have been conjunct the relevant stars!

Similarly, as per the attachment "Mahabharat-bh-graha-yutih" wich is from "The Scientific dating of the Mahabharata" by late Dr. P V Vartak, we find innumerable references to different planets vis-a-vis different nakshatras, either in the form of conjunction or ''tormenting" (पीडयन ), "near" (समीपस्थौ ) and so on!

These cannot be for imaginary equal divisions! If it is for equal nakshatra divisions, then we have to find what ''Ayanamsha"was used by the Mahabharata! And above all, the labour of all the scholars, who have been using "Planetarium Gold" and what not softwares just to find the timings of actual conjunctions etc. with actual "nakshatras" has been a wastage of time, as they should simply have used some Ayanamsha to find out the results!

Above all, we used to hear a lot about "Rohini Shakata-Bheda"! The Brihat Samhita has said in Rohini-yogadyaya

रोहिणी शकट मद्य संस्थिते चन्द्रमस्य शरणीकृता जनाः\| क्वापि यान्ति शिशु याचिताशणाः सूर्य तप्त पिथरम्बु पायिन:\|\|

I am attaching a translation of all the shlokas of the relevant portion by Chidambaram-Iyer (Attachment Rohini-Shakata-bheda)

Can any "nirayana" astrologer/astronomer please tell us as to whether it was the imaginary Rohini division or the real Rohini nakshatra that Varahamhira was talking about?

Then again, what about the Saptarshis? Shri Nilesh Oak has created a stir by talking about ''Arundhati having advanced over Vasishtha" more than 7000 years back!

What about Agastya?

Do they get clubbed into some ''equal division" or are they exceptions?

In a nutshell, IMHO, before jumping to any conclusions one way or the other, we have to consider the views of the Vedic lore and even our ancient astronomers because these are matters relating to faith in the Vedic lore and the Vedic astronomy instead of to predictive astrology!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
