Albeit, this is false. IIUC in KeraLa as in TN, people follow the siderial (not tropical/ sAyana) solar calendar. There is an obvious problem even there, which you have stated. Slowly festivals shift away from the appropriate seasons. You easily see this when mallu-s celebrate "vishu" \~ 22 days after actual viShuva (equinox).
