Shri Vishvas Vasuki,

Jai Shri Ram!

40 is a typo.

The original says चत्वारिँशदहान्यद्य द्वे च which means 40+2 = 42 days.

And that means that it was actual conjunction of the moon with "nakshatras" instead of some equal division, as clarified by you!

Thanks for pointing the discrepancy.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
