In the example that I quoted, Moon enters Pushya at 21:23 PM on 20th July 2020 and leaves Shravana at 14:59 PM on 31st August 2020 which is a total of 43 days. Even if you disregard 20th July since Moon enters Pushya after Sunrise of that day, you still get a total count of 42 days. I have taken the location as Mumbai.

  

Regards,

Nikhil
