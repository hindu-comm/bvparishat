Shri Vishvas Vasuki,

Jai Shri Ram!

\< Does this correction mean that Lahiri Ayanamsha is same as True Chitrapaksha ayanamsha (Spica is always exactly at 180° or 0° Libra in ecliptic longitude)?>

There was a very lengthy discussion in "Swiss Ephemeris" forum about "almighty" Lahiri Ayanamsha!

Shri Dieter Koch had written to PAC, Kolkatta, asking for some clarifications about Lahiri Ayanamsha, but their response was not very informative.

I am sure you must be aware of all that correspondence since you are also a member of that august forum.

All my mails about "almighty" Lahiri Ayanamsha in that forum can be accessed as I do not want to repeat them here.

Regarding Lahiri Chitra being always in (Lahiri) Tula, no! Nothing is permanent in this world!

Lahiri Chitra has regressed to Lahiri Kanya as will be clear from the attachment Lahiri stars-2004. Even the Rashtriya Panchanga for the current year says that the nirayana Lahiri Chitra is no longer in Tula! (Attachment RP-Stars-1942SE)

In fact, late N C Lahiri took the entire Hindu community for a ride by inventing the hoax of Chitra Ayanamsha, which is neither sidereal nor tropical, but just because of being nearer to Grahalaghava longitudes in 1940 this ruse was resorted to!

Pl. see<https://madhivanan.in/>saptarishis-used-tropical-zodiac/

where a thorough analysis of Hindu calendar has been done by the author!

The IAE does not call it sidereal longitudes either! They just call the longitudes etc. of Hindu festivals portion as"nirayana"!

(Attachment IAE Ayanamsha-2019.)

In fact, late N C Lahiri had gone by the suggestion of late S B Dikshit, who had advocated sayana longitudes of planets to keep them in accordance with the scriptures and he siddhantas. He had maintained that because of the obsession with the then Grahalaghava etc. planetary longitudes, people may not accept Sayana. The would not accept even "Raivata-Paksha"

Thus "Chitra Ayanamsha" was the lesser of two evils! (Attachment Chitra Janmapatri)

It is really surprising that we have to depend on the longitude of a star of the mean (and not true!)equinoxof 285 AD for catering to the "niraadhar" nirayana whicheven the "Calendar Reform Committee" had termed as

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!
