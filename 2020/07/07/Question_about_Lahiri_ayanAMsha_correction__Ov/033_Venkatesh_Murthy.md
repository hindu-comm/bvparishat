The longitudes of all Nakshatras is given in Surya Siddhanta Eighth Chapter and later corrected in other texts. I read in another place Dixit's book has a discussion on Abhijit and why it has been left out. Now we have 27 Nakshatras and not 28. Sometimes to choose a proper Muhurta the astrologer will give Abhijit Muhurta. It is a very good and powerful Muhurta.
