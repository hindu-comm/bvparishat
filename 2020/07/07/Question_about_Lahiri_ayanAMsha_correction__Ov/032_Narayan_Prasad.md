Namaste.

  

\<\<Abhijit Nakshatra is overlapping with Uttarashadha mostly and a little bit Shravana. It is from 6 degrees 40 minutes to 10 degrees 53 minutes and 20 seconds in Nirayana Makara Rashi.\>\>

  

Could you please give the proper reference for the longitude of the Abhijit Nakshatra?

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
