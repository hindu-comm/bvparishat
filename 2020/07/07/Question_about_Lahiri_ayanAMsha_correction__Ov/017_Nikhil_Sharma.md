Hi,

  

I apologize in advance if what I say makes no sense or is incorrect. However, I do believe it is possible for a 40 day period between the Moon in Pushya to Shravana. For example, check the transit on 21st July 2020 where the Moon is in Pushya to 30th August 2020 where the Moon is in Shravana which is a period of 41 days. I'm obviously using equal divisions, which as per the above discussion may be faulty, but my guess is that it would probably work out even if you took the marker stars into question.

  

Regards,

Nikhil
