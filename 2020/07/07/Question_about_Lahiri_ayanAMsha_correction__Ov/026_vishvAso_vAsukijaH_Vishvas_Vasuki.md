Notes from the first meeting of the calendar reform committee:  

  

  

  

"Dr. Daftari said that for the sake of convenience the first point of the zodiac should be 23° 21' ahead of the real Vernal Equinox, and that all calculations should be made on this basis. Shri Lahiri pointed out that in Bengal they had 23° 12'. It was decided that the first point of Meṣa is to be taken 23° 15' ahead of the Vernal Equinoctial point, and all calculations should be made on that basis. "
