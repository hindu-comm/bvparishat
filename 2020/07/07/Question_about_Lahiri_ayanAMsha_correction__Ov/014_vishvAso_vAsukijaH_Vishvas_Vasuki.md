By equal divisions or conjunction with corresponding asterisms, he should have returned on 40th day. But he says he returned on 42nd day. So I don't see this as an explanation for anything other than the poet's inaccuracy.  

  

Can you show the calculations to explain how this must have been conjunct the relevant stars?
