"*Do you have access to any such published calendar? I would like to have a look at it.*"

  

Most calendars published from Kerala provide the Malayalam month (which is solar) and the lunar asterism. Here is one example:

  

<https://www.malayalamcalendars.com/malayalam-calendar-august-2020/>  

  

This is the calendar page for the month of August 2020. In August, Malayalam Era (also called "Kolla Varsham") 1195 ends and 1196 begins.
Also, the month of Karkkadakam ends and Chingam ("Simha") begins. This information can be seen at the top right-hand side of the calendar.

  

In each of the cells of the calendar, at the bottom left hand corner, the name of the asterism of that day and the tithi for that day are written in Malayalam script. For example, Saturday August 1 is asterism Moolam and tithi trayodashi as written in Malayalam script on the bottom left of the cell. This is also the 17th of the month of Karkkadakam as shown on the bottom right hand side of the cell. Top right is the English date in Malayalam script.

  

Suppose a person was born on August 11, 2000. As per Malayalam calendar, he was born under the Asterism Moolam in the month of Karkatakam. If he were to celebrate his birthday as per Kerala tradition in the year 2020, he would celebrate it on August 1st, 2020. For other years, the English date will be different.

  

A typical calendar looks like this:

  

<https://www.google.com/search?q=mathrubhumi+calendar+2020&sxsrf=ALeKk00LZqMnPOkU-niTC25XZnybpAmJHA:1594256156439&tbm=isch&source=iu&ictx=1&fir=1LHn-XrcN_Z_YM%252C5co4-H-jiFwrzM%252C_&vet=1&usg=AI4_-kSr3yFa-tdqTm5SIY2tFhDomGVNSg&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiiror_-r7qAhWdHzQIHTYACj8Q9QEwAHoECAkQJQ&biw=960&bih=552&dpr=3.13#imgrc=lTyw60AmYQ4F_M>  

  

  

"*In brief, the Nirayana zodiac has a fixed origin, whereas the Sayana zodiac has a variable origin*."

  

Wouldn't this imply that Nirayana is not taking precession into account and Sayana is taking it into account?
