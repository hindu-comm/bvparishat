Shri Vishvas Vasukiji,

Jai Shri Ram!

\< So, there you have it, shrI AK kaul - this is no proof of "unequal divisions".>

You have justripped the portion of Balarama's pilgrimage from the entire mail which contains quite a few references from the Mahabharata to planets vis-a-vis nakshatras! (Attachment Mahabharata bh-graha-yutih")

There certainly were 28 nakshatras during the time of the Mahabharata!

Bhagwan Krishna has identified Himself as Abhijit nakshatra in Srimad Bhagavata, supposed to have been compiled after the Mahabharata by the Veda Vyasa!

So if Abhijit nakshatra was very much around, that means there were twenty-eight"divisions" and each could not be of 13.3333 degrees!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
