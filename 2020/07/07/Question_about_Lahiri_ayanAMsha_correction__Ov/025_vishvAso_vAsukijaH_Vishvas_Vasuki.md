No I was not member of that forum, but searched and joined as a "no-mails" member just now. I suppose you're referring to - <https://groups.io/g/swisseph/message/8395> .

And I suppose shrI Dieter was referring to <https://groups.io/g/swisseph/topic/lahiri_and_b_v_raman_ayanamsa/73355685?p=,,,20,0,0,0::recentpostdate%2Fsticky,,,20,2,0,73355685> . Still curious what Dieter's takeaway (regarding correction to documentation) thence was.

You can still link them. Critical point is that it is unclear what you refer to by "Lahiri ayanAmsha" because the committee recommended two ayanAMshsa-s, one resulting in tropical divisions and the other resulting in sidereal divisions.

I am quite skeptical about claims of NC Lahiri's extraordinary influence in the committee or that he pushed the Chitra Ayanamsha underhandedly - one can access all the ayanAMsha-s then in use accross the country in the report - I am yet to go over those carefully, but with a cursory glance, there did not seem any revolutionary change there.
