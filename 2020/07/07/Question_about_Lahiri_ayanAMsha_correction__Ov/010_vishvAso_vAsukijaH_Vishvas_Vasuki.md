It seems that there is another era:

  

"The Bengali era is called *Bengali Sambat* (BS)^([\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_calendars#cite_note-1)) or the *Bengali year* (বাংলা সন *Bangla Sôn*, বাংলা সাল *Bangla sal*, or *Bangabda*)^([\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_calendars#cite_note-Sengupta2011-2)) has a zero year that starts in 593/594 CE. It is 594 less than the [AD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini "Anno Domini") or [CE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era "Common Era") year in the [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar "Gregorian calendar") if it is before *Pôhela Bôishakh*, or 593 less if after *Pôhela Bôishakh*. "

  

What was supposedly special about 593?
