Thanks Narayan ji. That is what I too understood from this discussion.  

  

To put my understanding in slightly different words, if the calendar is corrected for the precession of the equinoxes, the months will be in sync with the seasons but the asterism (nakshatra such asअश्विनी, भरणी ...) in which the sun happens to be for a particular month will drift through the seasons as time passes. In about 2150 years, the drift would be roughly the equivalent of a month. In 25772 years, the drift will complete one full cycle, or 360 degrees, covering all seasons. So, names like Chaitra, Vaishakha may not be suitable for the months because the correlation between the month and the asterism breaks because of the precession of the equinoxes. Madhu, Maadhava, ... may be better names for the months.  

  

By precession of the equinoxes, my understanding is this: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession> . I believe the term "sAyana" means correcting for this precession and "nirayaNa" means not applying any correction for the precession. Am I right?

  

With the sAyana calendar, festivals can be celebrated in the appropriate season - for example, vasanta panchami can really be in vasanta. The requirement that the nakshatra is also to be taken into consideration can be met by celebrating in the appropriate month, on the day the moon is in the required asterism. This is how festivals and birthdays have been celebrated for over a thousand years in Kerala. The months are solar and are in sync with the seasons and the days within the month are reckoned using the lunar nakshatra.

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
