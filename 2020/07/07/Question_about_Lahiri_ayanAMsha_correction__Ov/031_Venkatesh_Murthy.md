Namaste Sri Kaulji

  

Abhijit Nakshatra is not always mentioned in the Vedas. Take for example the Taittiriya Samhita 4-4-10. There is no mention of Abhijit.

  

The equal division of Nakshatras is given in Maitrayani Upanishad 6-14. Here it says the Month is divided into 9 quarters of Nakshatras. That means in a month the Moon or Sun crosses 9 quarters of the Nakshatras.
