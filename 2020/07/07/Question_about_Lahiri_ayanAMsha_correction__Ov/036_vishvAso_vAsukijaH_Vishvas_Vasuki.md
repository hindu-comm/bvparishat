A bunch of longitudes I copied from the Calendar Reform Committee notes (with Abhijit coordinates added from stellarium) - These naxatra divisions (barring abhijit guesses) seem to have held since vedAnga-jyotiSha times. <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VZ4AHRl4vGfJTORwXZBkYaFSXekOKeUB91kRZJp2nU4/edit#gid=0>

  

The role of abhijit remains mysterious to me, but the "unequal division" in early vedic times seems quite reasonable.
