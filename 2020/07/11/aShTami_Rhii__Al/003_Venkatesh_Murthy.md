Namaste Sri Radhakrishna Mahodaya

  

There are two camps. One will let go of Nakshatras and choose seasons. They want to celebrate in the correct season. Therefore they dont care about Nakshatra. Another camp will let go of seasons. They want to celebrate in the correct Nakshatra or at least close to it in Ashtami only.

  

Sayana followers belong to the first camp. Nirayana followers to second.

  

The problem is the Sayana followers are acting like they are very scientific and the Nirayana camp is unscientific with blind beliefs and so on.

  

But the intelligent person like you should see that it is not a scientific versus unscientific matter. But a matter of convention or faith and what the Sastras say. The Sastras clearly have a high regard for Nakshatras. Each Nakshatra has a God with it and it is powerful like the Sun or even more. We have to respect Nakshatras in religious observances. There is no second thought about it.
