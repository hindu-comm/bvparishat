Let us say in midsummer, the sun’s position is diametrically opposite to a star X, as viewed from earth. The next midsummer, the sun’s position with respect to this star would have moved a little because of the precession of the equinoxes. In 12,886 years, the sun and the star X would be close together, as viewed from earth. In short, on account of the precession of the equinoxes, the sun’s position with respect to any “fixed” star will drift through the seasons as years pass.

Lord Krishna’s birth is celebrated on the day of Aṣṭami of Kṛṣṇa Pakṣa (8^(th) day of the dark fortnight) when the moon is in the Rōhiṇi asterism. Now, these two conditions can happen together only once a year. Wouldn’t this occasion of Aṣṭami + Rōhiṇi move through the seasons because of the precession of equinoxes?

If we wish to celebrate Lord Krishna's birth in the same season every year, we must let go the condition that it should be on Aṣṭami + Rōhiṇi.According to Puranas, Krishna was born in the lunar month of Bhādrapada. If we fix the calendar such that Bhādrapada occurs always in the same season, we will have to let go one of these three to celebrate Lord Krishna’s birth. If so, which one to let go, Bhādrapada, Aṣṭami, or Rōhiṇi?
