Several periodicities are involved in measuring time duration. Earth's rotation on its own axis, Moon's revolution around the earth, earth's revolution around the sun and movement of the sun with respect to distant stars. An LCM of these periodicities subject to the accuracy of measurement would be a huge number. A coincidence may never recur. If a panchanga is accurate for one hundred years, that should be sufficient. Every hundred years a correction could be introduced like the system of Leap years. Our ancients observed a celestial coincidence at a terrestrial event and it would be wrong to expect the coincidence to occur for celebrating the event.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
