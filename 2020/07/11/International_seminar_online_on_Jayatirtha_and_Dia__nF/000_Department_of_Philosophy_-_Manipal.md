Dear Madam/Sir,  



Greetings from the Department of Philosophy – Manipal!



As the present COVID crisis has altered the way we live and interact with each other, it is imminent to explore the other modes of interactions to nurture and sustain our academic endeavours. It has been possible to do so through virtual platforms connecting with people who live across the globe. At this juncture, The Department of Philosophy (DoP) – Manipal in collaboration with Vedic Vedantic Studies and Research Institute (VVSRI), New Delhi in technical collaboration with Indian Council of Philosophical Research (ICPR), New Delhi are jointly hosting a one-day international seminar on Sri Jayatirtha and Dialectics on Monday, 13 July 2020 from 10 am to 6 pm online at [https://bit.ly/vedanta-seminar](https://bit.ly/vedanta-seminar) on the occasion of Jayatirtha’s 632nd Aradhana. Erudite scholars - HH Sri Vidyashrisha-tirtha Svamiji of Sosale Vyasaraja Matha (formerly known as Prof Dr D Prahlada Char), Prof Dr Shrinivasa Varakhedi, Prof Dr Arindam Chakrabarti and other notable speakers from IIT Delhi, Public Health Foundation of India and Senseforth Technologies are invited to speak on Jayatirtha’s hermeneutical expositions on the epistemology, logic and metaphysics in Dvaita philosophy.



Recalling the words of the eminent scholar Dr BNK Sharma sets the tone for this seminar, "If Indian philosophy is to be accepted as much more than an interpretation of certain basic texts and traditions, though not as completely detached from them, attempts should be made to present the various systems of thought and their logical, epistemological and ontological foundations and their metaphysical superstructures, in their architectonic unity. The philosophical system of Madhva and his commentators has not received adequate attention from this point of view… The period of Jayatirtha (c. 1365-88) was one of remarkable development in the history of Dvaita thought and its literature. He gave final shape and form… in the light of contemporary logic and philosophy. Jayatirtha… accomplished it with… his expertise in difficult textual exegesis and philosophical analysis of problems, his graceful style and extraordinary genius for amplification and clarification of details… His methodology of thought and exposition has been followed by all the subsequent writers of the system".



On behalf of Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE), an Institution of Eminence in India and the Vedic Vedantic Studies and Research Institute as well as Indian Council of Philosophical Research (ICPR), we extend a warm welcome to you to this international seminar to be held online this Monday. Those wish to may register at [https://bit.do/philosophy-registration](https://bit.do/philosophy-registration). Please find the invitation attached.
