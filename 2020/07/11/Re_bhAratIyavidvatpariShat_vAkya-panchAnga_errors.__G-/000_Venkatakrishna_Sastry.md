Namaste



In the context of ' Stellarium software' reference and ' Vedanga Jyotisha':



What are the sounds of sun' ? Explore the link and listen to the narrative at <https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2018/sounds-of-the-sun>

What are the sounds of the Universe / Big Bang ? - <https://www.sciencealert.com/sound-can-travel-through-space-after-all-but-we-can-t-hear-it>



'Sun' - is the star ( Nakshatra) in the solar system ( Bha-Chakra) and is marked as the physical pointer to ' Surya -Devataa ( Savitru by some; Aditya by some other schools)'.

Surya is ' Atma-Kaaraka'; and ' Life of Cosmos'.

Veda suktas and Mantra Shaastra provide 'Surya -Mantra's; the most popular being ' Vishwamitra Gayatri'.



Can the Vedanga Jyotish researchers connect the science evidence appropriately and present the ancient Samskruth texts to validate their interpretation ( of course Panini-Patanjali -Varahamihira, Parashara- Bhaskaracharya - Jaimini … every one comes in to picutre; And along with it the chalenge of explaining Gita : नक्षत्राणाम् अहं शशी (***nakShatrANAm ahaM shashI***) Chandara as a 'Nakshatra.



Vakya siddhanta rules validation for observing a ' karma- abhyaasa'
needs to look in to this aspect, beyond a routine historical translation model referencing and claims. Have the ephemeries addressed these physical dynamics in the Universe on the scale of billion years ?
