Maybe, but I’ve got a long list of booksellers from whom I tried to buy this book before the virus situation, and it was unavailable then too. My hope was to fill in an interlibrary loan request for it, but it’s not clear when that department will resume its post-virus activity. However, if you do know of a bookseller who has a copy of this book for sale, please do tell.

  

Best wishes,

Irene
