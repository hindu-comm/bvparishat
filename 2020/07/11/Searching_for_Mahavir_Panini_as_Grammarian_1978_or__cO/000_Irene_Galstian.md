This author states in his 1984 book that his 1971 thesis was published in 1978 as per the subject line of this thread, but Shodhganga didn't yield it, possibly because his name might have been different in 1971 (or because the thesis just isn't there). He doesn't mention the name of his PhD supervisor.

  

In addition, I'd like to find out more about this researcher, and information in that direction would be sincerely appreciated too. For example, in the 1984 book he writes that his more detailed work, called Panini as Sentence-Grammarian, is in progress, but I couldn't find any mention of such book on WorldCat. It's possible that the work was never published, or published under a different title, but WorldCat hasn't yielded it yet. However, there seems to exist a 1998 book by the same author:

I've joined the library queue to obtain it and might get it towards the end of next week. In the meantime, I thought I'd ask on the list and see what turns up.

  

Thank you,

Irene
