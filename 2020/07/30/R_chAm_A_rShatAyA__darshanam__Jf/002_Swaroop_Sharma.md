Namaste,

  

Your message with Swaras made me stop for a moment. I read them as if I was reading the Mantras as I know a very few Sūktas. Interestingly, I felt the same vibrations I generally feel when I read the Sūktas from the book. So, should I associate the structure of these Swaras with Yajurveda or Rigveda?

  

Can you add Swaras as if, it's structured in Sāmaveda? In which case, does every sentence become a song?  
  
Jai Ammā BHĀRATĪ
