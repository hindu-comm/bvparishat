Thanks, Sunil Ji. Huntington's book "Emptiness of Emptiness" on Madhyamaka Buddhism is a classic in Buddhist Studies. His novel "Maya" published in 2015 is really his autobiography in the garb of a novel, narrating all his experiences of living in India for extended periods of time. With best regards,
