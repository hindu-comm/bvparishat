Hari OM Professor,

  

I am sorry to hear this. I have been reading some of his works (in conjunctionwith Dr. Garfield's) and found Dr.Huntington's approach on Madhyamakan emptiness is clear and lucid.

  

This passage is profound from the wisdom site you pointed us to...

  

"In order to live what is left of my life and die in peace, the wrathful deity of death is teaching me to give myself over to the human community and to a felt kinship with the nonhuman world, a world to which I have always belonged while never fully appreciating the significance of that belonging, a world where this failing body of mine is, like all bodies, a tiny, fleeting shadow in the immensity of creation. In only a few months the gestalt has shifted, and after a lifetime of study and practice of Buddhism I am only now learning, here in this prison of necessity, to release my grip on life and so to love life as it is in all its beauty and horror, to give myself over to the embrace of those infinite others, human and nonhuman—the earth in which we are rooted, teaming with beetles and grubs and worms, the grass and flowers and trees, the robin building a nest outside my window, the hawk circling high overhead, the clouds, wind, rain, and sun—all of whom have nourished and sustained me throughout this long journey home. They are in me, and I am in them. We are inseparable."  

  

  

ॐ मणिपद्मे हूँ  

ॐ नमो नारायणाय
