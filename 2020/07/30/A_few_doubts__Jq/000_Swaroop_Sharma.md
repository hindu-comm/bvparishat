Namaste,

  

Most esteemed Scholars,

  

If सज्जता means preparation & सज्जः/ज्जा/ज्जम् means prepared, what's the Kriyāpadam of the same?

  

Is it सज्जति? Also what's the Dhātu & it's Artha?

  

Also, what's the Dhātu of सिद्ध्यति? Is साधयति, णिच् of the same Dhātu or a separate Dhātu, by itself?
