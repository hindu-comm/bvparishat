Respected Shankaraji, I will remain grateful to you if you kindly give me a link to download one book on Alamkara Sastra named *Bhasabhusana* written by Yasovanta Singha in Hindi Language. This book is urgently needed by me for my Research work.

                                   
                                   
      With regards,

                                   
                                   
      Ms. S. Sinha.
