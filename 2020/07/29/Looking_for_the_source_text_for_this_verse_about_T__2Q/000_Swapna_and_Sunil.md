Hari OM dear teachers,

  

I am looking for the original sourcetantric(?) text from whence this snippet must have come..

Any help/leads would be really useful. I searched online, but I did not get very many useful results.

  

ततःशून्या परारूपा श्रीमहासुन्दरी कला।  
सुन्दरी राजराजेशी महाब्रह्माण्डनायिका॥  
महाशून्या ततस्तारा तद्वैगुण्यक्रमेण च।  
मुक्तौ संयोज्य सर्वं तं महासुन्दर्यनन्ततः॥   

  

Respectfully,

  

Sunil
