Dear Scholars,

  

Offering an "approximate" English verse translation of Vande Mataram, inspired by Sri Aurobindo's translation. While Sri Aurobindo's translation is excellent, it is not conduciveto singing. Hence, I felt the need to render it differently. I would greatly appreciate any suggestions for improvements:

  

Sovereign Mother! I revere your feet  
Whose water is pure, whose fruits are sweet,  
Whose skies are cooled by winds from ocean  
Whose orchards wave in tender motion  
Whose nights rejoice in the moonlight  
Whose flowers blossom with delight  
Whose laughter rings with boundless bliss  
If there is paradise, it is this  
Who showers on us bounties free  
Sovereign Mother! I bow to thee  
  
When seventy million voices roar  
Your glorious name from shore to shore  
Your sons in their tumultuous bands  
Who raise unsheathed swords in their hands  
Who dares to call my mother frail?  
Undeterred, she reigns supreme, we hail  
Row us across life’s transient sea  
To peace and ceaseless harmony  
Victorious for the world to see!  
Sovereign Mother! I bow to thee  
  
You are wisdom, the eternal law  
At heart serene, bereft of all flaw  
In our mortal frame, life’s breath  
That guards us from the shroud of death  
Unvanquished power on our part  
You are devotion in every heart  
In every temple, every shrine  
Your idol, Mother, reigns divine!  
O crest of mankind's liberty  
Sovereign Mother! I bow to thee  
  
O Goddess of War, who wields the sword  
And slayed the evil enemy's hoard  
To thy foes, a dreadful sight!  
To thy sons, a beacon light  
O lotus-throned! In tranquil rest  
Rejoicing in ethereal nest  
I invoke you, Muse, in my verse  
Thundering across the universe  
March onward, O unbound and free!  
Sovereign Mother! I bow to thee  
  
I bow to thee, O lotus-born!  
Resplendent gems when you adorn  
When nectar gushes through your streams  
Exultant face with laughter gleams  
Deity! Abide in our soul  
In success, cheer; in loss, console  
O cradle of our nation’s birth!  
Bestowing wealth, O guardian Earth!  
Perfect in virtue, seers decree  
Sovereign Mother! I bow to thee  

  

Best,

Kushagra
