Namaste,

Thank you Satyan Mahodaya :-)

  

What do these two words Vayu and Pavana mean?

  

I've heard scholars using Samīra to indicate breeze.

  

Scientifically, these are different phenomena. Wondering if ever scriptures used different terms to denote different shades of Air?

  

Jai Hind!
