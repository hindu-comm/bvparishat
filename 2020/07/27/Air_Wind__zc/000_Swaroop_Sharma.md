Namaste,

  

Air & wind are two different concepts entirely as you all know.

  

Are there two separate Samskritam words to indicate them?

  

In my limited understanding, I've a feeling that, they're used interchangeably like Vāyu & Vāta. I'm sure I'm wrong. Just that I'm looking for a valid reason to be wrong :-)

  

धारणम् चालनम् क्षेपः सङ्कोचः & प्रसरः are known to be the quality of Vāyu as per ब्रह्मज्ञानतन्त्रम्।

  

So are these five qualities of Air or Wind?
