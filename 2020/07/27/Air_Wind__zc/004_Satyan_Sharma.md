Namaste

  

पवन is derived from the root पू (शोधने), suggestive of purifier. समीर/समीरण is a पर्यायवाची of वायु, but because it is from the root समीर्, which directly suggests movement, so it would be nearest to wind.

  

In the वैशेषिक text पदार्थधर्मसंग्रह, both air and wind are included in the वायु (द्रव्य).

  

Regards
