If you are talking / thinking about the difference in the expression-origin cultural root aspect of the two expressions Thank you and धन्योस्मि /धन्यवादाः ,

yes, there is a difference.

  

The word “thank” stems from theLatin word*tongēre*. The root*tong-*means “think.” Loosely translated, the expression might read “I will remember what you have done for me.” However, English is not the only language where “thank you” derives from Latin roots.  

<https://www.access2interpreters.com/the-history-of-thank-you-around-the-world/>

  

The expression thank you has the implied subject of the sentence ' I '. It is in fact 'I thank you' shortened into 'thank you'.

  

dhanyosmi is made up of dhanyahand asmi. So it means, I am dhanya.

  

The word dhanyahis used as dhanyosi(= you are dhanya)also.  

  

सः धन्यः, सा धन्या, इदं धन्यं are also possible.  

  

Though Apte mahodaya takes it as derived from dhan(a) = wealth, if we see the other shades of meaning in which the word is used , the root meaning seems to be fortune, supernatural merit, auspiciousness etc. meaning of wealth seems to be an extension from the meaning of fortune.

  

Apte himself quotes,

  

(इदं पायसं)प्रजाकरं गृहाण त्वं धन्यमारोग्यवर्धनम्Rām.1.16.19

  

and gives the meaning of healthy and wholesome. Since आरोग्यवर्धनम्‌ is already there , the meaning healthy makes the word redundant. So there must be some other meaning for धन्यम्‌ here.

  

In any case,

  

धन्योस्मि = I am dhanya



should mean your help made me fortunate or I am lucky/fortunate to get your help.

  

It is used in the sense of 'I am fortunate to have you as my guru'.

  

'I am fortunate to have been admired by you'

  

etc.

  

All in all, it seems to be an expression of humility apart from being an expression of gratefulness.

  

धन्यवादाः

  

is the sound(s) / expressions of dhanyah/dhanyaa(asmi)

  

full form of is ' I would / am making the sounds /expressions of 'I am dhanya'. '
