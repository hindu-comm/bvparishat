Dear Learned Scholars,

Sri Rangji temple Vrindavan, Mathura(UP) is dedicated to Lord Sri Goda-Rangamannar and is the largest South Indian temple outside the dravidian states. The temple was established in the year 1852 and is probably one of the few divyadeshams of SriVaishnavism tradition, which are managed by a private trust. The temple follows Pancharatra Agama shastra and for the last 150+ years been upholding all the traditions established by poorva achaaryas. The temple is facing severe financial crunch due to the Covid-19 epidemic and has requested for donations to allow it to continue doing the seva of the Divyadampathi Sri Goda-Rangamannar. Please refer to the detailed appeal in the attached document and if possible please circulate it among your social circles.

  

Dhanyavaad

Aditya
