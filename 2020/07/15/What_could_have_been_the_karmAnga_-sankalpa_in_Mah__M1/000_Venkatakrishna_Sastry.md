Namaste



A question to scholars -friends in Jyotish.



**Question**: What could have been the कर्माङ्ग -सङ्कल्प in Mahabharata and Ramayana period ? by what reference coordinates ? By which ' Panchanga ?

**Reason**: Our current practice is to start with Vaivasvata Manvantara and use ' Kali-yuga' tag as a reference in between
for the yuga- time measure. अद्य-ब्रह्मणः द्वितीय परार्धे ..
कल्पे...मन्वन्तरे ...कलियुगे .. ( जम्बू द्वीपे - भरतवर्षे भरतखण्डे ).......



 Samkalpa gives the Kaala-desha- bearings for Karma; and is important for ' Muhurta fixing'.





Thanks in advance for the help.
