Bhaṭa (भट) and Bhaṭṭa (भट्ट) were used as suffix to proper names in pre-modern times. The latter (Bhaṭṭa) is used as a surname in modern times (as Bhaṭṭ, Bhaṭṭar, Bhaṭṭatiri, Bhaṭṭācārya etc). What is the meaning of these words? What is the difference in meaning, if any, between these words?  Are these words etymologically related to bhartṛ (bearer, protector, husband) or bhṛtya (dependent, servant)?
