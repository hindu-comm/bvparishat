Respected members of BVP,

Jai Shri Ram!

Yesterday's "Hindustan" - Hindi edition---which claims to have a circulation of hundreds of thousands of copies, cried from housetops that Dakshinayana will start on July 16 since it is Karkata Samkranti on that date!

The "Jyotishiji" is sure that the sun will turn South then and the "night of Gods will start the same day"!

सूर्यदेव की दक्षिण यात्रा के आरंभ को दर्शाती है यह संक्रांति, अवश्य करें दान -

Just for your information, pl!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
