Warrier Ji,

  

I agree. There is a tradition of learning Urdu in my family and I have nothing against it. But it seems to me that the चमत्कार of Urdu primarily lies in using "alien"or "clever" sounding words in a base language that would otherwise be understood by large sections of people in North India and the Deccan. I am not a scholar but I suspect that large portions of Urdu poetry would fail the standards of kavya shastra established by Mammata or Panditraja Jagannatha.

  

Furthermore, the संहिता-esque features of Persian (for example, "शाम-ए-मौसिक़ी") and the "poshness" associated with its epiglottal sounds adds to the perception of beauty in Urdu. Of course, the Persian script suffers from several deficiencies in writing Indian words accurately.

  

Besides, Urdu enjoyed the patronage of the ruling elites for several centuries before Independence. This unfair advantage enjoyed by Urdu was only amplified by Bollywood post-Independence. However, I now see that the tides are turning and a level playing field is slowly getting restored.

  

Best,

Kushagra
