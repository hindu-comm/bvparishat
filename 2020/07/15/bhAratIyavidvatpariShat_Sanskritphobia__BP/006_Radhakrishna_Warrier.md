Dialogues in Indian regional language movies mostly sound natural whereas the Urdu dialogues in Bollywood "Hindi" movies often sound unnatural because of the excessive use of Persian and Arabic words.

  

While most Bollywood Hindi songs are actually in Urdu, there are a few that are in Hindi. Here is one sweet Hindi song with almost no Urdu words.

There are also songs in Simple Hindi sung by Yesudas in movies like Chit Chor.
