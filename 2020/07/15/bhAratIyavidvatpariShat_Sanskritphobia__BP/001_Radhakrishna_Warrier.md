I don't find Urdu any more sweet or beautiful than other Indian languages that I know. To me, Urdu sometimes appears artificial, and the so-called politeness goes to the extent of appearing a little unnatural. The sounds of Urdu are also not any sweeter than other languages. Frankly, non-Indic sounds like qa (क़ ق) k͟ha (ख़ خ) and g͟ha (ग़ غ) are a little jarring to my ears as I am more used to Indic sounds.  

  

Urdu developed as a camp language. The word "Urdu" and the English word "horde" are cognate. Both came from "ordu" of Turkic languages (including Turkish) meaning a camp.  

  

Modern Indian languages as informally spoken by the educated Indians are also becoming a sort of “Urdu” with the excessive and often unnecessary use of English words. Many things can be simply and elegantly expressed by commonly used Indic words, but people choose to use English words as a status symbol. Whole English phrases and even sentences are included in Indic language conversation just as Urdu imports not just words but even phrases and sentences from Persian and Arabic. The modern trend in Urdu seems to be to ditch Persian in favour of Arabic. The familiar Khuda Hafiz is giving way to the artificial Allah Hafiz.
