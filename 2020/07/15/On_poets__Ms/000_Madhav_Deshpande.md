On poets

  

नृत्यत्तरङ्गमधुरं हृदि ये क्वणन्ति

वाग्वीणया कुशलया निजकाव्यगानम् ।

तेषां निशाकरसुशीतलरम्यवाचाम्

आनृण्यमेमि शिरसा नमसा कवीनाम् ।।

  

I pay my debt by bowing down in reverence to those poets whose words are calming like the beams of moon’s light, and who play in my heart their poetic song with a skillful Veena of their language, a song sweet like dancing waves.
