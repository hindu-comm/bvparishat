Many thanks, Prof. Gudsoorkar. I shall provide the English translation of any verse I post in future.There is nothing original in my verse. It is a repetition of what Prof.Madhav Deshpande composed. I only changed one word to mean,"

I pay my debt by bowing down in reverence to you, a poet whose words are calming like the beams of moon’s light, and who plays in my heart his poetic song with a skillful Veena of his language, a song sweet like dancing waves."  

The plural used to refer to poets in the original has become a plural to convey respect in the modified verse. That is all.

Regards,

Murthy
