*(Noticed this email in my Drafts, sending it now in case it's still useful to the question of whether Virama was used in Brahmi.)*

  

I know nothing about Brahmi, but for questions of this sort the Unicode supporting documents are often a surprisingly good place to find potentially useful references. In this case, the Wikipedia articleon the Brahmi block in Unicode ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brahmi_(Unicode_block)&oldid=966150662)) has under "History" a list of documents and searching them one by one for "virāma", the fourth linked PDF is called[L2/03-249R](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2003/03249r-brahmi-proposal.pdf)which, in Section "2. Overview of the History of pre-modern Brāhmī", says:

  

\> The further historical development of the Brāhmī script is characterised by \[…\] One widely used system of palaeographical subclassification is that developed by A. H. Dani, distinguishing Old, Middle, and Late Brāhmī periods, Transitional Scripts, and the modern Indian scripts. While spreading towards southern India in the Old Brāhmī period (third to first c. BCE), \[…\] In the Middle Brāhmī period (first to third c. CE), regional variation increases; \[…\] Brāhmī is for the first time being used to represent Sanskrit, and for this purpose four new characters are added to the script ( /  ṛ,  /  au,  ḥ, and  ṅa). A special device is introduced for the marking of vowelless consonants, used both for Sanskrit, where it is called virāma and first occurs in manuscripts of the first c. CE, and for Tamil, where it is called puḷḷi and attested in inscriptions from the second c. CE (Mahadevan 2003, p. 198). \[…\] It is first during the Late Brāhmī period (fourth to seventh c. CE) \[…\] In the period of the Transitional Scripts (seventh to tenth c. CE) \[…\]

  

So according to the above, it would seem that virāma has been used in Brāhmī since "the Middle Brāhmī period (first to third c. CE)". The reference given, "Mahadevan 2003" is "Early Tamil epigraphy" and probably only
