Rishi-ji

  

Please try the 2 volume set by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. They are very good and give a top down picture and dives into quite a bit of detail as well. Srautakosha etc. will make you lose sight of the woods for the trees, just my opinion. It looks like no one has put these two books on [archive.org](http://archive.org) and violated copyrights yet ðŸ˜€

  

There are specific books on agnihotra and darshapurnamasa with photos published by Motilal. I can get those details if you wish.
