Namo Haraye

Vande Vidushah

Dear scholars, I require a guide to.understand various Yajnas, both Shrauta and Smarta. I have heard of 40 Major Yajnas mentioned in Gautama Smriti, where they compulsory for all or some of them where? Do the Shrauta sects approve of Pajayajnas? Such doubts are numerous.

A brief introduction to 7 Havir 7 Soma 7 Paka Yajnas, Agnyadhana and different Agnis, Agnichayana, info on Vedis etc.

Please provide a book in Hindi English or Sanskrit covering all these aspects.
