May it be clarified thatBVP WhatsApp group is not the WhatsApp version of BVP email list.

  

BVP moderating team is not the admin of the BVP WhatsApp group. So they can not add anyone to that WhatsApp group.

  

Dr Shivani of KSU and some others who were co-ordinating the BVP conference are the admin of the BVP WhatsApp group.
