 There are requests to us from some BVP email list members to add them to the BVP WhatsApp group.

  

The BVP WhatsApp group was created during the BVP conference for the smooth co-ordination of the conference activities.

  

For some reason, it did not get closed after the conference.

  

Dr Shivani of KSU and some others who were co-ordinating the conference are the admin of the group.

  

May it be clarified thatBVP WhatsApp group is not the WhatsApp version of BVP email list.

  

BVP moderating team is not the admin of the BVP WhatsApp group. So they can not add anyone to that WhatsApp group.
