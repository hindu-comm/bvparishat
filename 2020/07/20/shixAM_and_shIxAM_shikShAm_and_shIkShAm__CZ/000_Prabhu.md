namaH sarvebhyo

  

In shikShavalli of taittirIya upanishad, I learnt it with "शीक्षां
...shIkShAm" ie,starting withdIrgha shI

and I seeshikShavalliprinted likewise and also hear many recite...

  

"शीक्षां व्याख्यास्यामः । ... "

  

However among thevedAnga's it is normallyशिक्षा, (with the hR^isva)
and notशीक्षा.

  

1\. Is there a valid practice of reciting theshikShavalli with

"शिक्षांव्याख्यास्यामः । ... "

  

2\. Is there a reason for this difference?

  

I don't seeशीक्षाin any dictionary I could lay my hands on,.... expect for this entry in MW Cologne Dictionary:

(I understand about not all vaidika prayoga-a showing up in dictionaries.... )

  

शीक्षा f. incorrect form of शिक्षा (q.v.), TĀr.; ĀpŚr. &c.

  

  

  

Thanks and regards

Prabhu
