Dear All, Namamsi

I want to know if any good books are available on purana cosmology, especially in sanskrit by modern writers (1500- to present).

There are jyotish works obviously from suryasiddhanta to ketakigrahaganita etc. But I want know what conservative pandits think about frompurana standpoint.
