Abhayankar Ji,  
Your videos are very useful in that they provide clues on what to focus on.  
  
The part where you talk about the need for sacrificial yagnas in order to replenish faith helped me to understand why such rituals become important in a world where logic and science are pushing out true religion and thereby creating a vacuum that provides entry for fanatic religions to fill space.  
  
Your close study of Srimad Bhagwad Geeta and your hard work is providing a road-map deserves all appreciation.
