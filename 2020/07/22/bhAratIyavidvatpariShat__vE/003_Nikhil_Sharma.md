Dear Kushagra Ji and Venkatesh Ji,

  

Thank you for your comments. While I agree that Muhurta is a specialized topic with its own rules, there is also enough reference in Shastra that the Muhurta lagna (along with other factors) should be well placed with respect to the native's chart (in this case, India's chart). To that extent, I find some flaws in the selection of the muhurta. Then again, I am no scholar, and I am sure there must be a very well-reasoned argument for choosing this time, or perhaps there are other upayas being done to redeem this choice.

  

On a similar note, please do refer to the placement of the planets between September 9th - 11th, 2020. All the grahas are in dignity (either in their own rashi or exalted) except for Venus, who also gains strength by being in parivartana with the exalted Moon! Even the nodes are in rashis where some Jyotishis consider them exalted. If I am right, such a combination has not occurred for at least the past 200 years. Perhaps it is a marker for the birth of an exalted soul who will lead our race out of the mess that we have created :)

  

Regards,

Nikhil
