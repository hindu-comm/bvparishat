Namaste  

  

<https://www.pandit.com/shubh-muhurat-for-construction-of-the-temple-2020/>  

  

The above page has a Muhurta from 7:10 to 14:03 on August 5. Again from 16:22 to 18:26.

  

There are books like Muhurta Chintamani to be used for thispurpose. You cannot use the rules for individual horoscopes and apply them to Temple construction. There are different rules.
