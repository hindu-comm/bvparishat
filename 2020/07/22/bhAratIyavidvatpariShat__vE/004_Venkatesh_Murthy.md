Namaste Yoginiji and Nikhilji

  

Another auspicious event is the Raghavendra Swamy Aradhana on August 5. South Indians and particularly the followers of Madhva Sampradaya celebrate this festival every year. Sri Raghavendra Swamy was a great Rama Bhakta. He ordered his Brindavan to be built on Sravana Bahula Dwiteeya day. That day is August 5 this year.

  

If we start building the Rama temple on the day one of his great Bhaktas entered Samadhi there is nothing wrong. It is honoring the Bhaktas who have made sacrifices for Rama.

  

I cannot write much but there are scholars in this group from Madhva Sampradaya. They can give strong reasons for August 5 being auspicious and defend it better than me.
