Namaste Venkatesh ji

  

Can you write an article elaborating on this aspect for Indic Today. I see many people arguing there is no muhurtam in this month etc. Some are quoting Sri Ram's discussion with Hanumana about starting war after Chaturmasa etc too.

  

It would help to put this information for people to read and understand.

  

Regards

Yogini
