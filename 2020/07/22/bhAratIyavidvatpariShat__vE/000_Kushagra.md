Dear Scholars,  
  
I request the scholars of Jyotisha to kindly shed some light on the timing of the beginning of the construction of the Rama Temple in Ayodhya. The date is August 5 and the time is reported in the media as 12.13 PM.  
  
Prima facie, there seem to be multiple problems with this date. First, it is during the period of Deva-shayana, when such auspicious initiatives should be avoided.  
  
Secondly, the Tithi is Bhadra but there isn’t any particularly auspicious combination. I think they are simply going for the Abhijita Muhurta. On the other hand, Guru and Shani are both retrograde.  
  
Finally, charting the exact moment reveals that the Lagna is Tula but there is no real benefic in the Kendra and the benefics in the Trines are either conjunct or aspected by malefics.  
  
However, the Trust must have assessed these issues before choosing the date. If not, it would be a travesty:  
  
यः शास्त्रविधिमुत्सृज्य वर्तते कामकारतः।  
न स सिद्धिमवाप्नोति न सुखं न परां गतिम्।। (Gita, 16.23)  
  
Therefore, I would greatly appreciate the guidance of scholars in this group.  
  
Best,  
Kushagra
