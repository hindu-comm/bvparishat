Dear sirs,

  

I came across a very melodious rendition of the Srimad Bhagavatam in Sanskrit, a snippet of which was received through a whatsapp message. I contacted the producers in Kerala and got the mp3 pen drive for the whole text. It is a fluent and melodious recitation by a scholar named Narayana Murthy.

It costs Rs 1500/ inclusive of postal charges but it gives full value for money.

The producers are Messrs. Malayalarajyam Book Depot, Kottayam, Kerala and the phone number is 92498 93537.
