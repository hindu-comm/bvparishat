Namaskar,

  

This is my first message in this forum of learned scholars. I'm Vinay Modi. I live in Hyderabad, originally come from Sirohi, Rajasthan, lived my early days in a near by town Bhinmal.

  

Often times I've observed that rational thinking on the matters of Śraddha leads to friction, and if both the persons or groups don't take it in right perspective it even leads to animosity. But, I think there should be some Śāstra sammat ways to ask and reply queries on these matter without going down to the lower levels of human nature. Could you please share some textual references and practical advice from the experience gained in your own life.

  

Revered Swami Ranganāthānanda ji (past president of Ramakrishna Math and Missions), writes in his exposition of Vivekachūḍāmaṇi verse 25ː

  
"... śraddhā here means faith with a view to investigating the truth of what is told. Deep rational thinking forms the basis of such faith. ... This makes us go ahead from the level of faith to the level of truth."

  

For example, some scholars believe that theory of evolution has some truth in it andthe present society is the result of continuous evolution (both in lower and higher nature) of human functioning. But, we also come across scholars who would not agree with this theory.

  

In the west, we find many such examples, Bruno, Copernicus etc, who suffered as the society there was not progressive enough to deliberate on the scientific thought propounded by great rational minds.

  

One way (which may not be the best way), is to keep quiet or don't go into argument if the other person or group does not like thinking in rational way, and keep searching for the right person with whom one can discuss it in length.

  

Kindly share your knowledge in this matter (textual references, experience gained in your own life etc.).

  

Best regards,

Vinay Modi
