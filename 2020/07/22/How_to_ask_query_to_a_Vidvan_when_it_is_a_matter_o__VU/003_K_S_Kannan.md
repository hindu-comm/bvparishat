"*shrat*" stands for truth. plus root *dhA*.

This is the etymology of *shraddhA.*

"the grossly overestimated *critical thinking*"

\- exactly!

These are disasters issuing typically from - paying greater attention  

to a cultivation of finesse in language, structure and format of presentation of criticism,  

rather than probing into and comprehending the actual content.

  

The former is essentially a matter of drill and skill,

and the latter involves unusual/particular *tapas*.

  

A mere mad love of novelty (rAjasic rambling) primarily robs one  

of the patience to perceive the abiding (sAttvic rumination).
