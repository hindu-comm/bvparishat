Historically, "śrad/śrat "is more likely to be the same word as "hṛd/hṛt" (as in “hṛdaya") and to be related to “cred" in “credulous”, etc.

  

Followed by root "dhā”, ‘to place’, śrad/śrat gives us “śraddhā", meaning ‘place is (one’s) heart/mind’, —> ‘internalize, accept’.

  

As I suggested in an earlier post, we should not think of nirukta. nirukti, or nirvacana (or even Uṇādi derivation) as identical with what “etymology/etymologize” stands for, although the outcomes of the two intellectual/analytical activities sometimes are the same.
