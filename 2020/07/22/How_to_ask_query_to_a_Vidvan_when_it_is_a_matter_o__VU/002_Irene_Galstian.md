The problems around shraddhaa come from inability to direct one's own mind to something and keep it there. There seems to be an irresistible need to immediately agree or disagree with whatever is being held in the mind.

This is because conscious rituals have disappeared from daily practice, and we as a society are toys of haphazard rituals that are not necessarily good for the physical and non-physical aspects of human beings. Much has been made of debates and discovering so-called 'new' things. But look and experience this for yourself: knowing doesn't arise from debates or the grossly overestimated 'critical thinking'. It arises from the capacity for firm focus and repetition in that state. Many different levels of consciousness are possible for a human being. Through the Vedas, India possesses the imprint of a level of consciousness unknown to the cultures from which this vexed business of 'critical thinking' comes from. Nor should this be taken to the opposite extreme of 'blind faith'. The presence of daily rituals saves one from extremes. It also brings a healthy dose of renunciation into one's life, which is perfectly tailored to each individual, rather than lengthy one-size-fits-all philosophical lectures.
