Praṇāma Śrī GSS Murthy,

  

I just thought I should bring a bit more clarity in my post otherwise what I'm sensing from your reply looks like this post will meet not so good end.

  

My post in this scholarly forum is to know the process or manner of asking query to a Vidvāna and what does Śāstra prescribe about it. It has nothing to do with Bhāratīya or Videśī. A Vidvāna may live in Bhārata or in Videśa. Also, It has nothing to do with doubting Śāstra. So there is no point of discussion on Andh-Śraddhā and modernity of it because my post has nothing to do with it (kindly re-read my post if time permits).

  

In the process of Śravaṇa, Manana and Nididhyāsana, a truth seeker may get queries. Novice would get queries which are very basic. A Vidvāna may get queries which only the realized person can answer. All I've asked is "How to ask query to a Vidvāna when it is a matter of Śraddhā".

  

Best regards and Praṇāma,

Vinay Modi
