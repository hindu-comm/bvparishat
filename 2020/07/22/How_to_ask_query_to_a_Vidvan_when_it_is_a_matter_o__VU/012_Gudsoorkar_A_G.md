Thank you very much Dr Paturi Garu for retrieving the detailed post on “Shraddha” from Dr Sivasenani Nori.  Very informative.

  

Recently, I have posted one query/request in BVP for the meanings of two stutis: ‘SrinivasGadyam’ and ‘Mahanyasam’.  I shall be highly grateful if you can help me in this effort. Regards.
