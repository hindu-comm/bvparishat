नमो विद्वत्कविभ्यः सचेतोभ्यश्च

  

Now that Kushagraji and Madhavji have both composed verses onकाव्यचोर-s, here is my own.

  

काव्यचोरस्य निन्दायै पद्यं बद्धं मया निशि । प्रातस्तु काव्यचोरेण सभायां पठ्यते स्म तत् ॥ At night, I wrote a verse criticizing the plagiarist. Next morning, a plagiarist read out that very verse in the assembly (of scholars).
