The poet’s reaction after his verse was stolen:

  

करुणे न मे करुणा कदापि न हास्यतो वदने स्मितं

विकटश्च रौद्ररसः प्रियो न भयानकाद् भयकम्पनम्।

रिपुमद्भुतं प्रजहामि वीरमघं च शान्तिमशान्तिदां

न रतौ रतिश्च जुगुप्सया रचयामि काव्यमहं कविः।।

  

(हरिगीतिका छन्दः)

  

“I have no compassion left for compassion (tragedy). Comedy doesn’t bring a smile to my face. The fierce mood of fury is not dear to me and horror only makes me tremble with fear. I have renounced amazement as my enemy, heroism as a sin, and tranquility as calamitous. I have no love for love and as a poet, I now only write in aversion.”

  

Best,

Kushagra
