A rejoinder to Dr. Rajaraman'sbeautifulverse:

  

रत्नसंज्ञां विधायत्वं कवे काव्येषु कर्वसि।

रक्षरक्षाधुना काव्यंकाव्यचोरादहर्निशम्।।

  

"O poet, attributing the status of a gem to (your) poetry, you boast. Now, protect constantly your poem from those who would steal them."

  

Inspired, of course, by

  

पृथिव्यां त्रीणि रत्नानि जलमन्नं सुभाषितम्।

मूढैः पाषाणखण्डेषु रत्नसंज्ञा विधीयते ॥
