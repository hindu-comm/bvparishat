All was said in a lighter vein.

Even the great err - says the adage.  

So, Murthy-ji, is your minor error.

A small error of a master of versification.

  

Continuing the tenor of my quote, I reversed the logic:

Whoever errs is, therefore, great !

  

Don't they also say :

आत्मन आर्षत्वख्यापनार्थमादावेवाबद्धमाहेति ।
