Sri Girish-ji,

  

It is not a bad word or a word with bad meaning.

  

It is a word without meaning.

  

There are many names being used for naamakaraNa today that have no meaning.

  

Sometimes parents are using words with bad meaning because of not knowing the language, usually Sanskrit.

  

You are lucky. This word does not carry a bad meaning.

  

If you want to change the name into a word with a good meaning, or the meaning you intended to have, scholars on the list can help you.

  

Sri Nityanand Misra-ji ,on this list has special interest in this topic. He may be able to help you.

  

Otherwise no need to worry. Afterall, a name is just a name. You may leave it at that.
