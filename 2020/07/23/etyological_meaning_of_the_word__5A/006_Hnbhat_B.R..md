That is not the word AVUKT as halanta word. May be pronounced in Hindi as a HINDI word.

  

May be possible as suggested by Shri Vishnu. Better if we can see the citation of the original citation where the word occurs in the seentence in Devanagari characters to be clear.

  

Some one asked in Sanskrit:

  

\*माऋश्र्शा\*

इति शब्दस्य अर्थः कः।

  

It could not make any sense even in Devanagari. So far so good. Later he explaines it as the mother's sister.
