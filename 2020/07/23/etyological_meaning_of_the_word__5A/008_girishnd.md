Any inputs ?

  

**Avyukt "A V Y U K T "**is the name of my son chosen by my wife.

But Many Hindi and Temple Poojari don't agree this name to be good.

Hindi people say it as it to be a opposite meaning to work Upyukt but I do not agree.

Temple Poojari, says not a good name!! may be to pronounce but it is good name thou!!.
