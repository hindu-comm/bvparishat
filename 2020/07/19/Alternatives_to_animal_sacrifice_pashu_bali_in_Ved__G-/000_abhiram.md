Namah pariShade, namo vidvadbhyah.

  

Dear scholars,

  

Recently I became interested in the topic of alternatives to animal sacrifice (pashu bali) prescribed in the ancient Vedic literature (Brahmanas, Aranyakas, etc). As these are vast, I don't have the training to know whether these scriptures prescribe alternatives as a main option (instead of a special case). I did some online searching and found only a few references to original texts. Among these are Aitareya Brahmana 6.8-9, Shatapatha Brahmana 1.2.3.5-9, Taittiriya Samhita 2.3.2.8 and Taittiriya Aranyaka 6.2.

  

The main alternative of course is the puroDAsha (rice cake). But another option was to just release the animal. The Aitareya Brahmana reference seems to be very general and applicable universally.

  

I have written an article on my blog quoting the above original texts and based on my own analysis and research:<https://goldenreed-hiranyayavetasa.blogspot.com/2020/07/alternatives-to-animal-sacrifice-in.html>

  

I would like to ask the scholars two things:

  

1\. Could you please review my article

2\. Could you please direct me to any books or articles written by traditional Vaidika scholars on this subject.

  

I guess my intent is to find out how prevalent was actual animal sacrifice vs alternatives throughout Hindu history.
