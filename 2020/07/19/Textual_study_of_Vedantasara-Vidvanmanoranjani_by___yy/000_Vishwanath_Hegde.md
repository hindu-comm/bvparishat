Vedantasara of Shri Sadananda is helpful to understand the Advaita Vedanta darshana. It has many commentaries. Among them Vidvanmanoranjani is most important one.

Dr. Ganesh Ishwar Bhat, one of the eminent scholars in the field of Vedanta will teach this text.

We have come up with its first episode.
