RespectedVidvāns,

I have come across a Sanskrit inscription that was found at a temple dedicated to Mahādeva, written in Bengali alphabet and failed to decipher the same. The inscription is following,

शाके स्वराग्नि-कुलशैल-सुधांशुमाने शर्व्वाक्षि-पक्षविमिते तपसः शुभेऽहिन  

  

Is this inscription referring to a date of founding in cryptic words or people associated with?

  

Sincerely,
