Dear All,

  

Namaste. I am in search of a Upanishadic reference which would mean the following:

  

"As the butter is hidden in milk, even so the Atma is hidden in the body. As churning is required to bring the butter out, even so, meditation and vichara are required fo manifest the Atman"

  

Thanks in Advance.
