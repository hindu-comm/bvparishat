Excellent !

It will be a bonus if these small features can be added (if and when possible):

1\. Print in bold/highlight the string being searched for.

2\. Serialise the references, so we will know how many references we get.

  

Further, if a rough timeline for the kosha-s has been worked out,

\*make it available in general; plus,

\*produce the timeline of only those kosha-s from where citations have appeared.

  

This helps one make some historical notes also:

\*since when a particular vocable has made its appearance in the kosha(s);

\*since when a particular semantic value(s) has gained/lost currency/prominence.
