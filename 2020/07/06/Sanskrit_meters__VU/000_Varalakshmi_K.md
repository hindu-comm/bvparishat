My humble salutations to the Scholars,

Sanskrit Academy is working on a reprint edition of Harikathamritam, a Yakshaganam by Srimadajjada Adibhatla Narayanadasu. The author employed several meters among which four are unknown to me. I referedJayadaman of H.D. Velankar. But didn't find information of four meters. Kindly provide the lakshnam and reference books for the meters mentioned below:

  

1.कोरकवृत्तम्

2\. फलवृत्तम्

3\. माधवीवृत्तम्

4\. मायावृत्तम् (उपजातिः) (as for the information provided by meter identification tool of Sanskrit Library)

  

Thanks in advance.

with regards
