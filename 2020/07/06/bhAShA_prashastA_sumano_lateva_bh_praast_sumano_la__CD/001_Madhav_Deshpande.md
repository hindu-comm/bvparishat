Dear Marcis,

  

  The first line of your quote appears to be metrical \[Indravajrā\], but the second line is not so. "keṣāṃ na cetāṃsi" looks like the beginning of an Indravajrā line, but then āvarjayati is not metrical.
So I suppose, what you have quoted is a slightly altered form of some metrical verse. Also "sumano lateva" should be one word.
