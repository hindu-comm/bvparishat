Dear Prof. Deshpande,

  

Before asking I tested it on <https://sanskritmetres.appspot.com/identify> and I do understand it's broken - but still.

  

lolam is a sama-vṛtta. It contains 4 pādas, each of which has the pattern GGLGG.

The input verse imperfectly matches lolam (लोलम्) (note deviations in red):

bhāṣā praśastā

sumano lateva

keṣām na cetāṃsy

āvarjayati

  

It's for a translation of a book about Sanskrit in Russian.

  

M.
