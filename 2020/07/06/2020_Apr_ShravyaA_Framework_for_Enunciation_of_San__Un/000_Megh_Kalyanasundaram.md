**Abstract**

  

"Through this paper we are proposing a framework for enunciation of Sanskrit shlokas and phrases. Sanskrit shlokas have been known to have a cathartic effect on the mind and soul. But due to the richness of the language and the lack of a large number of teachers, few are able to tap its benefits. We propose a new method of sandhi splitting based on the shloka characteristics and the utilization of the seq2seq model with attention for generating shlokas. On testing, the model generates an MOS of 3.25 out of 4."
