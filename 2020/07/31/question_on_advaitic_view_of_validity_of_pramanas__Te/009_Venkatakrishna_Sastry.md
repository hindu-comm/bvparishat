Namaste





1. When talking of technicalty of ' shaastra-pramaana' in the darshana shastra' context, it may be of interest to take a peep on how modern scientists look at 'Evidence- Experience -validation' of Conscious experience and conscious experiencer. 'Darshana' through Yoga' is the highest rated 'Pratyaksha-Pramana'. Some times marked as ' Swaatmaanubhootyaikagamyam',

which is beyond ' indriya, manas, buddhi'- articulation, graspability
and debate'. ( Gita: 3-42. Advaita deliberation is in the realm of 'swatah-pramana'.)



The yoga mapping of this goes to 'Vastu- Anubhava-Chitta vrutti' in Yoga shaastra abhyaasa. A technical domain where 'Samskrutham' serves as the ' Langauge of Yoga disicplines ' for documentation.



2. I share two resources which may be useful in relation to this discussion, connecting Vedanta- Yoga and Modern Science research on Consciousness.

Description

While yoga was originally intended to be practiced for spiritual growth, there is an increasing interest in applying yoga in all areas of life. It is important to understand this ancient science and way of life through as many perspectives as possible (e.g., based on biomedical engineering). As its popularity and interest grows, more practitioners want to know about the proven physiological effects and uses in healthcare.



The Handbook of Research on Evidence-Based Perspectives on the Psychophysiology of Yoga and Its Applications provides research exploring the theoretical and practical aspects of yoga therapy and its physiological effects from diverse, evidence-based viewpoints. The book adds in-depth information regarding the (1) physiological effects of yoga; (2) neurobiological effects of yoga meditation; (3) psychological benefits related to yoga, such as mental wellbeing; (4) molecular changes associated with yoga practice; and (5) therapeutic applications (for lymphedema, mental health disorders, non-communicable diseases, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and trauma, among other conditions). Featuring coverage on a broad range of topics such as pain management, psychotherapy, and trauma treatment, this book is ideally designed for yoga practitioners, physicians, medical professionals, health experts, mental health professionals, therapists, counselors, psychologists, spiritual leaders, academicians, researchers, and students.
