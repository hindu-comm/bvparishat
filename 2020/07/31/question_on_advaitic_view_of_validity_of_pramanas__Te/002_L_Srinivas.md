On a lighter note, recently (maybe 3-4 years back) there was this movie called 'Ankhon dekhi'. It's the story of a middle class married man somewhere in northern India living with his married brother in a joint family. He works as a clerk in a small travel agency. One fine day he gets this notion that pratyaksha ('ankhon dekhi') alone can be a valid pramana. He resolves to act as per this vision. The comic consequences of this resolve are beautifully picturized.  

  

Sanjay Mishra does a great job as the central character. The film is very tightly written (no songs) and well directed.  

  

It's worth watching as a movie which truly has a philosophical notion as its central premise. I I liked it because the dialogs are in Hindi, not a mixture of English and Hindi.  

  

It used to be available on Amazon Prime.
