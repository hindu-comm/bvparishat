This may be relevant to those with interest and may not answer the particularquestion in full, especially references.

  

Each pramana has its zone of influence where it reigns supreme. Truth about Adityagati or alaatachakra cannot be established by pratyaksha , even though in matters accessible to indriyas, pratyaksha prevails. Eight kinds of instances (minuteness, occlusion etc.) where Pratyaksha doesn't apply are discussed in Saankhya kaarikas.

  

Sometimes Sastra alone prevails. Example - existence of svarga or apsarass. Pratyaksha or anumaana are not applicable here.

  

There are also instances when pratyaksha prevails over Sastra. Sankaracharya himself says that even a hundred Srutis do not make agni cold to touch. In such cases those Srutis are explained as being figurative. This is in consonance with the method of Purva Mimamsa. It may be noted that lakshaNaa(which involves some inference) is not allowed in vidhi vaakyas.

  

So, the general rule is that in case of atindriya matters (where even vyaaptijnaana is atindriya), Sastra prevails - otherwise pratyaksha or anumaana apply.

  

When it comes to establishing the highest principle / entity, the agreement amongst various Darshanas on spheres of influence of pramanas breaks down. Sankhya and Nyaya (and their affiliates Yoga and Vaiseshika) use anumaana to establish their highest principle - Pradhaana and Isvara.

  

Mimamsa (both systems) and Vyakarana depend on Sruti to establish their highest principles.

  

In Advaita, it is repeated many times that Sastra alone is the means to realize Brahman. Such realization can be validated through anubhava, which is a sort of pratyaksha, but the order cannot be reversed.

  

In both Advaita and Vyakarana, tarka is valid only when it is Srutyanugriheeta. Bhartrihari compares a man relying on tarka to a blind man travelling on a treacherous path.
