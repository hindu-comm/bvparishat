Just to add what Sri Senani ji has explained: Shankara says that each pramana has its own unique field of application:

  

तस्मात् न ब्रह्मैकत्वं ज्ञापयिष्यन्तो वेदान्ता विधिशास्त्रस्य बाधकाः। न च विधिशास्त्रम् एतावता निर्विषयं स्यात्। नापि उक्तकारकादिभेदं विधिशास्त्रम् उपनिषदां ब्रह्मैकत्वं प्रति प्रामाण्यं निवर्तयति। *स्वविषय**शूराणिहि प्रमाणानि, श्रोत्रादिवत् ॥* Brihadaranyaka Upanishad bhashya 2.1.20

  

Here he is addressing the stand of the purva mimamsakas who hold that the Vedanta part of the Veda is to be seen as eulogy since they do not have any vidhi. The Vedantin assures them that the Vedanta that teaches the Brahmaikatvam does not contradict the karma kANDa of the Veda.
Ultimately, even though the two kANDa-s have different viShaya-s, subject matter, they can co-exist as not conflicting with / contradicting each other. He sums up the discussion by stating 'pramANa-s are experts in their unique field (meant for them) just as the sense organs such as the ear (the ear is uniquely designed to work in the field of shabda, sound, the eye, in the domain of rUpam, and so on. They have no application in a domain other than theirs.)
