Namaste,

  

Respected scholars,

  

Are there references to these (in Bhāgavatapurāņam or Mahābhārata) -

  

1\. Flute as an instrument.

2\. Did Krishna really use it, or is it an addition like Radha in the recent years?

3\. Did Krishna have a Guru under whom he learnt playing flute?

  

  

4\. Also, does the author of any other text/s refers to the way flute was prepared by choosing a specific kind of a bamboo?

  

Apparently, to me, these are valuable sources of science.

  

Further, considering even Veena was Bhārata's contribution to world, it shows clearly that usage of wood/bamboo etc for preparing instruments was integral to this civilisation.

  

Where did it all start from?
