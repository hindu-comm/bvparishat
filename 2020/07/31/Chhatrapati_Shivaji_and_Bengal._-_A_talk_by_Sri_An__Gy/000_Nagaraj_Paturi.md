\*About the Talk

  

Chhatrapati Shivaji is celebrated as one of the greatest Hindu rulers. Not only in his time, but even for the Freedom Struggle against the British, his life story was a grand inspiration. It was in the province of Bengal, far removed from his native Maharashtra that he found the most resonance! Join us to know more about how he inspired everyone from Rabindranath Tagore to Bipin Chandra Pal to Aurobindo Ghosh.
