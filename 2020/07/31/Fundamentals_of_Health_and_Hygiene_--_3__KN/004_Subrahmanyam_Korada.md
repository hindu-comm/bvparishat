नमो विद्वद्भुयः

I have a question about the (non-)mixing of ghee and oil. Intuitively it does make sense, but there are many people who use oil to cook the dish, and in the end add a little bit of ghee for flavour. There are also people who cook the whole dish on a mixture of ghee and oil ...... What teachings exist regarding this?

The Ayurvedic Doctor is right -- we prepare Upma (with broken rice / wheat ) using oil in good quantity and at the end add some ghee . This is just an example ( I know cooking down to Mysoorpak ) .

If two hostile items are mixed in good quantity then it would certainly affect the health . Patanjali is here --

  

विरुद्धवीर्याशनं निन्दितव्याधिकराणाम् , सर्पिः वातपित्तप्रशमनानाम् - **चरकसूत्रम् (निर्धारणे षष्ठी)**

  

Consumption of hostile items would certainly cause serious diseases such as Leprosy , Jaundice (Hepatitis B) etc . Ghee kills gas and पैत्यम् ( bilious nature caused by oil , coconut , brinjal / वार्ताकम् etc ) .

  

I rather think ( not sure) imported items like Pizza , Berger etc are prepared using hostile items . I know some people who frequently consume

Pizzas , suffering from Jaundice (कामिला ) , obesity etc .

Liver (**कालेयः - सर्वत्राग्निकलिभ्यां ढग्वक्तव्यः - वा**) is a factory that kills germs . If it is disturbed then there will be chain reaction . पैत्यरस (Bile) enters the blood -yellowness in the eyes , loss of appetite , short temper , weakness etc.

  

More in the postings to come .
