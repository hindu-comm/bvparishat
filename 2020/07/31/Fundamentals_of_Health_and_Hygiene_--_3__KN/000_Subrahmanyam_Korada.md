नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

One should get up in ब्रह्ममुहूर्त ( 4AM - night is nine hours only - it is called त्रियामा - one याम is three hours ) --

  

ब्राह्मेमुहूर्ते बुद्ध्येत धर्मार्थौचानुचिन्तयेत् ।

कायक्लेशांश्च तन्मूलान् वेदतत्त्वार्थमेव च ॥ **मनुस्मृतिः, 4-92**

  

One should get up in the early hours - should think about the physical pains to be taken up to achieve

धर्म and अर्थ ( money ) - and also think about ब्रह्मन् ( the तत्त्वम् / noumenon of वेद ) .

  

Why today many people are suffering from **obesity and belly** ? --

  

**भुक्त्वा शतपदं गच्छेत्** शनैस्तेन तु जायते ।

अन्नसंघातशैथिल्यं ग्रीवाजानुकटीसुखम् ॥

भुक्त्वोपविशतस्तुन्दं शयानस्य तु पुष्टता ।

आयुश्चङ्क्रममाणस्य मृत्युर्धावति धावतः ।। -- **आयुर्वेदः**

  

**One should walk for at least hundred feet after meals - by that slowly the food would get settled - there will be comfort in the neck , knees and waist (at an advanced age and stage problems related to these three places willbe there) .**

 After meals if one --- sits he (she ) would get **belly** - lays down (may / may not sleep ) there will be **obesity** - walks (stroll) for some time his longevity would increase - runs , death comes running .**  
**

  

**नातिस्थूलं नातिसूक्ष्मम् ( सुश्रुतः )** -- the body should be neither too fatty nor too lean .

  

**अति सर्वत्रवर्जयेत्** -- too much is dangerous ----- too much eating / drinking / reading / watching / talking / sleeping etc.

  

( अतिदानात्बलिर्बद्धो ह्यतिमानात् सुयोधनः।

विनष्टो रावणो लौल्यात् अति सर्वत्र वर्जयेत् - **हितोपदेशः**)

  

**कालभोजनम्** ( **चरकसूत्रम् of Patanjali** ) -- one should have meals ( regularly ) at the same time .

  

हितं भुञ्ज्यात् मितंभुञ्ज्यात् न भुञ्ज्यात् अमितंहितम्।

हितमिष्टं च भुञ्जीयात् एषधर्मः सनातनः॥

One should consume food --- that is suitable to his constitution - in limited quantity . Even if it is suitable should not eat in excess- eat that is suitable as well as liked --- this is सनातनधर्म ( the perennial ' धर्म ' - the term is pregnant with meaning and hence untranslatable ) .

  

अनात्मवन्तः पशुवत् भुञ्जते ये’प्रमाणतः ।

रोगानीकस्य ते मूलम् अजीर्णं प्राप्नुवन्ति हि ॥ **चरकसंहिता**

  

Those , who , without being mindful (Mindful Eating ) , just like animals , go on eating something or the other without limit , would end up in a number of diseases - incur indigestion - that is the cause of all diseases .

  

उष्णमश्नीयात् स्निग्धमश्नीयात् मात्रावदश्नीयात् जीर्णे’श्नीयात् वीर्याविरुद्धमश्नीयात् इष्टे देशे’श्नीयात् नातिद्रुतमश्नीयात् नातिविलंबितमश्नीयात् अजल्पन् अहसन् तन्मना भुञ्जीत आत्मानमभिसमीक्ष्य भुञीत -- **चरकसूत्रम्**

  

One should eat --- food that is hot , oily and limited - after digesting the earlier eaten food - food that is made of mutually non hostile items ( oil and ghee are mutuallyhostile) - sitting in a pleasant place - without hurry - without delay - without talking / laughing - with mind applied on food only - having thought of his own body ( how much is required for his body - it varies from person to person ) .

  

  

तूष्णीम् अन्नानि भुञीत - **चरकसूत्रम्**

One should keep mum while having food .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
