I have a question about the (non-)mixing of ghee and oil. Intuitively it does make sense, but there are many people who use oil to cook the dish, and in the end add a little bit of ghee for flavour. There are also people who cook the whole dish on a mixture of ghee and oil. I asked an ayurvedic doctor about this, and he replied that the combined heating of oil and ghee, as in the 2nd example, is harmful, but using a little ghee for flavour after the dish has been cooked using oil, as in the 1st example, is acceptable. What teachings exist regarding this?

  

Thank you,

Irene
