A quote I like goes: "As a biological organism the human body is adaptive; more than that, it is antifragile, this is an important distinction in that things that are antifragile need stress to improve. So, the health and ‘fitness’ of the body is demand led – the demand comes from our environment." This applies to both food and exercise.  

  
Fasting (both intermittent and periodic) is naturally part of tradition.

  

Another key to health is exercise - while walking is good \~45 minutes after a meal, I wonder what traditional sources say about intensity training. (Well retained youth is not being able to walk a few miles at age 70, but more the ability to sprint with your grandchild.)
