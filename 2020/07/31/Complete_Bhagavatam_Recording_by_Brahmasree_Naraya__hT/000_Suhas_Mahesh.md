नमः सर्वेभ्यः

  

Most of you might have seen Dr. Aravinda Rao's post about a very pleasant and error free recitation of the entire Bhagavatam (54 hours) by Brahmasree Narayana Moorthi. You can [listen to a sample here on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2crjGb3EMHs).  

  

I'm posting some more details here upon the request of the producer Manoj Kumar Kamath, who is not on this forum:

  

A pen drive with the files (8 GB) can be shipped anywhere in India for Rs. 1500. You can also request a download link for Rs. 1200.

The payment can be made by bank transfer, Google Pay or PayTM:

  

Bank transfer:  
Malayalarajyam book depot  

Account number: 67384503306  

IFSC code ; SBIN0070125.  

CURRENT ACCOUNT

  

Google Pay/PayTM: 9249893537

  

You can also purchase it [via their website](https://malayalarajyam.in/srimad-bhagavatam-audio-pen-drive/).  

  

Send your email id as the comment along with the transaction. You can call or Whatsapp message Manoj Kumar Kamath on [+91 92498 93537](tel:+91%2092498%2093537) for any queries. He is very responsive.

  

Behind this recording, there lie 400+ hours of painstaking work by the reciter, musicians, and the studio. I hope many members will purchase this recording and the provide the team (and others like them) with the impetus to bring out recordings of other valuable texts as well.
