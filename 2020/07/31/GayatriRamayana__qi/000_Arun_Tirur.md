Namaste..

  

Dear scholars,  

  

There is a compilation of 24 verses taken from Ramayana, with a phalashruthi, known as GayatriRamayana. Of which each Shloka starts with letters of Gayatri Mantra, hence GayatriRamayana. Couldn’t find any interpretation of it. From an old Ramayana vyakhya in Malayalam, there found a reference of Swami Vidyaranya contribution in compiling GayatriRamayana. A mere reference nothing in detail.

  

Is there any reference of such a work with vyakhya available? Or is there any study on Ramayana’s connection with Gayatri Mantra.

  

Regards
