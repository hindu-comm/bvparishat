नमो हरये  
  
नमामि विदुषः  
  
I'm in need of a few Prabha Tika pages which aren't available in the Pdf file.  
There is a book with 4 Tikas on Nyayamuktavali. Prabha Manjusha Dinakari and Ramarudri together.  
  
Page 625 and it skips pages upto 629. In शब्दखण्ड, आसक्तिवनिरूपण, खले कपोतन्याय is given and then skipped. Then प्रभाकरमतखण्डन starts directly.  
  
If you have the hard copy, please provide me with the images of Pg 625-629 of Prabha Tika.  
  
Dhanyavda  
Rishi.
