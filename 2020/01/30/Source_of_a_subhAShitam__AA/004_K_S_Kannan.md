युक्तियुक्तं वचो ग्राह्यं बालादपि शुकादपि ।

युक्त्ययुक्तं वचो‌$ग्राह्यं वृद्धादपि शुकादपि ।।

is the reading I was taught in my younger days. Contrast bAla & vRddha.

Contrast s'uka (parrot), and s'uka (Sage S'uka).

  

So be open to learn from a small boy or even a parrot if they speak sense. Else, eschew the words of even an old man or sage S'uka himself!
