Dear Shri Subrahmanian ji-  

  

Thank you for the eloquent argument in favor of ekashruti.

  

I need a few clarifications here-->

  

Is there a proper context as to why the mahasannidhanam said what he did? Frequently people from a mistaken sense of "Guru Bhakti" take vaakyas out of context even when they are against what shastras say. I find it hard to believe that any mahasannidhanam of Shringeri would give advise that flies in the face of shastra.

Whatsapp university and memology notwithstanding, is there a proper context of verbatim conversation between the Mahasannidhanam and the shishya regarding ekashruti japa of Gayatri?

  

Have you considered that it is possible the original context went something like this: (?)

Sishya--What if I make a mistake in swaras while chanting the Gayatri (anavrata?)

Mahasannidhaanam-> Its ok Mother Gayatri is forgiving..if your japa is done with nishkaama bhava it does not hurt (if swaralopa occurs by mistake).

Later Commentators take this statement and twist it to say that the Mahasannidhaanam actively advised ekashruti japa for anavrata japa of Gayatri.

The kaliyuga mentality of the "sishya" is to find a way to make things simpler without having even begun the work. I have seen sishyas frequently pester gurus for "get out of discipline" cards so that they dont have to follow what they consider as too rigorous for their comfort.

While your "tadviddhi pranipaatena.." quote from the BG is very apt, it does not apply to sishyas who are perennially looking to bend "best practice " to suit personal comfort.

  

I am sure you will also agree that this is precisely the kind of person who will NOT be described as a "mumukshu".

Why is the "mumukshu" so intent on negating the very clear advice given wrt Veda mantras?

"मन्त्रो हीनः स्वरतो वर्णतो वा, मिथ्याप्रयुक्तो न तमर्थमाह।

स वाग्वज्रो यजमानं हिनस्ति, यथेन्द्रशत्रुः स्वरतोऽपराधात्॥"  
  

My understanding of the Vedic system is that the Rshis are the embodiment of precisely such a Guru as described by Bhagavan in BG.

  

By the way all of sandhyopaasana worship is nishkaama ..mamopartha samasta.."parameshvara preetyartham" / "naaraayaNa preetyartham" etc...where does kaamyaarthaprayoga enter into this field here?

  

So by this advise do we get all Brahmacharis and grihastas to start ekashruti japa of Gayatri?

  

What is being missed here is that there is a difference between Veda mantras and pancharaatra mantras ...like ashtaakshari or dvaadashaakshari.

  

One cannot take the rules that bind the latter, and try to force fit the Gayatri into this paradigm.

  

That would be fallacious.
