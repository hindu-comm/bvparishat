Shri Korada Garu:

  

Did the पीठाधिपति declare any context ?

-->

QUOTESvara-s must be correct if japa is performed with the lips moving*;*but if the gāyatrī-mantra is chanted mentally with one-pointed concentration,importance need not be givento the svara-s. It is sufficient to do just the japa. UNQUOTE

The other thing that needs to be considered is the actual wording of the answer. I have frequently found that when Brahmanishtas, and other Mahapurushas speak even when being diplomatic with the blunt truth the Shastra paramaartha is hidden in the wording.

The key phrase in the wording of the answer is "with one-pointed concentration"....I assume this refers to bindu or Para vani where the upasaka becomes one with the seer.mind takes the form of mantra..and svara is not an issue since it has become sahaja.

When one needs to get to Delhi from Chennai one has to explore options like train/flight etc.

This question of transportation would be moot if one is already in Delhi.

A layman also sometimes may get मोक्ष - check his horoscope - there may be some पूर्वजन्मसुकृतम् ।

  

--> Indeed. It is believed that Kannapa Nayanar was a reincarnation of Arjuna. We cannot use Kannappa's actions as a pramana for offering meat to Shiva Linga or to put our feet on a Shiva linga based on the argument that Kannappa gained darshana and mukti.
