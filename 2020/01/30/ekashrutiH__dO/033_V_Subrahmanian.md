Beautiful analogy. We have instances of scholars of various disciplines thronging to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Ramana Maharshi, etc. and hearing them wonder struck and finally surrendering to them. Shankara says in the Brahma sutra Bhashya,न हि दृष्टेऽनुपपन्नंनामin retort to an objection. When the result is seen to be delivered, there can be no objection about the correctness of the means from any quarter.
