Dear Shri Shankara ji and Shri Subrahmanian ji

  

Thanks for the source.

  

Frankly to me it is disappointing to note that my assumptions were proved right, by the very next question. Will performance of the japa without concentration yield fruits?

  

It is my belief that the Mahasannidhaanam has given answer based on the level of the questioner...with due respect to desha-kaala.

  

QUOTE *Svara-s must be correct if japa is performed with the lips moving;* but if the gāyatrī-mantra is chanted mentally with one-pointed concentration, *importance need not be given* to the svara-s. It is sufficient to do just the japa. UNQUOTE

  

Also how much of this has been properly translated wrt linguistic context is a big question.

This is not for a mumukshu but advise to a lay person to do Japa without worrying about technicalities. The hope underlying being that with greater shraddha the seeker will truly enter the zone of proper japa as per vidhi.

The answer looks like a call to action ..just do japa without worrying too much about technicalities seems the message.

Whether this can be transplanted as a prescriptive for a mumukshu is highly questionable given the next question and following questions.

 Will performance of the japa without concentration yield fruits?

Should the Veda be necessarily chanted with proper svaras?

Will sin accrue from mispronunciations?

Can one learn vedamantra-s by oneself?

  

The questioner is obviously an outsider to the Vedic path or adopting the outsider's perspective in questioning. I dont see even a first year Veda Gurukula student posing such a question.

  

This is definitely not a prescriptive and generally when there is a noncontroversial path and a controversial path, taking the noncontroversial one is the path of Dharma.

Controversial paths are for aapath-dharma. As in extraordinary situations call for extraordinary responses.

  

Also all sankalpas have an implicit intention builtin "yatha-shakti"...this refers to doing japa as per rule to the best of one's intellectual and physical ability. To do otherwise constitutes willful mithyaachaara.  

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
