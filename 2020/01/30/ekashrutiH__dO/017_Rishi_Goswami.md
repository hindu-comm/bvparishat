I had a similar curiosity since a long time.

Unlike Naiyayikas, Vedantis believe Shabda to be Nitya, and Brahmatmaka like everything else and all Shakti is in Brahma.  
The different meanings we interpret is through Shakti-Sankocha, when each word will represent a Specific Rupa of Brahma.

We use grammaar and Shaktigraham Vyakaropamana Koshapta.....Vriddhah methods to  
only understand, this is only meant for.our understanding, not God's. The Shaktisankocha is due to our Alpabuddhi, but Hari is Allknowing,and doesn't need any of it.

This probably should mean even if I chant random words with Brahmabuddhi, I should recieve desired results (not referring to sakaam) and Hari will hear my prayer.

This is the reason why I think even if Vishnaay means nothing technically, the chanter if chants with Brahmabuddhi, Vishnu will listen. A story much popular (dont know if its authentic), where Valmiki chants Mara instead of Rama still gets Brahmajnana.

But this makes me wonder, if any word chanted with Brahmabuddhi will be Brahm, what will be the Mahatmya of Vedas, of Gayatri? There will be no difference between Gayatri and a random drunkard blabbering?
