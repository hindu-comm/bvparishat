namaskAra.  
  
I have derived to a solution, which is pretty simple.  
  
विहितत्वात् or आरम्भसामर्थ्यात् ।।  
  
If Vedas are Akartrika, Nitya it means none of their words change,not even after Kalpas when Brahmaa is revealed the Vedas again. It is these Vedas which are just revealed in the same format, and They are endless and Eternal.  
  
If every syllable or any Shabda is Brahm, that means it denotes Brahm, but doesn't mean it is Veda. It can Vedamsha, like Gayatri starts with Om. Om has "M" in it. A baby who doesn't know anything is just sayingn'm-m-m-' so it's Vedamsha in that way.  
  
But this isn't the way it was revealed. The way it was revealed is Specific, unchangable and Uncreated,even Hari doesn't create the order, swaras.  
  
So Vihitatvaat, we pronounce the Vedas, the way they were revealed. It just means that Vedas are revealed in a certain way, so you follow that order.  
  
It is no breaking of grammatical rules or change of meaning if I utter "SwargakAmo DashapUrNamAsAbhyAm Yajeta", instead of "Darsha-pUrNamAsAbhyAm SwargakAmo Yajeta" but that isnt how the Vedas wrre revealed.  
  
Or,  
  
Aarambha-Saamarthyat, it means that Vedas are revealed in a certain way, their Aarambha or Revelation would make no Sense if it were not so important. Naryana could always directly Utter Smritis to Brahma.

So, yes there is another Gayatri as well, that is to be uttered by the 4th Varna, which will produce the same results as Vedic Gayatri. But Vedic Gayatri will not produce results if Turiya chants it. Why? AvihitatvAt. It is not Vihita for him.  
  
But if Brahmana chants Turiya Gayatri, it won't produce same results, because again, AvihitatvAt. Vedic Gayatri is Vihita to Traivarnikas.

Whereas if we look at God, he isn't bound by any of these as he himself says "नाहं वैदेः न तपसा न दानेन च येज्यया, भक्त्या तु अनन्या शक्यः". These Sadhanas are Prescribed, that is the only reason we use them, God isn't bound with these Sadhanas. God gets tied through Bhakti only (like he got tied through Yashoda, दामोदरो भक्तवश्यः).  
  
Why does it matter? I think it matters becuase it is Vihita and we should follow and maintain the Vedic Dsicipline. If we follow it, we should assume this is the Grace of Hari, if we do things according to our whims and wishes, we should assume it is becuase we are not Kripapatra of Hari.  
  
I'm just thinking the context Shankaraacharyaji said it, means simply that it's not a big sin to do it. God isn't bound by any boundaries, he will Select his Bhaktas at will, and that's it.  
  
If Hari wishes even Ajamila can accidentally utter HarinAma and get Moksha, then why not a sincere Sadhaka?  
  
I am not saying this as any pramANa, please forgive my errors and correct me accordingly.  
  
Namaskar to Scholars.
