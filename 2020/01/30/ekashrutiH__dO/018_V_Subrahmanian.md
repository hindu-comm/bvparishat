You have a point. There is this famous verse:अमन्त्रमक्षरं नास्ति नास्तिमूलमनौषधम्। अयोग्यः पुरुषो नास्ति, योजकस्त्र दुर्लभः।।

  

And another verse that brings out the role of faith/attitude in achieving results:मन्त्रे ,तीर्थे ,द्विजे ,देवे ,दैवज्ञे ,भेषजे गुरौ \|यादृशी भावना यस्य,सिद्धिर्भवति तादृशी\|\|

  

In the Panchadaśi of Swami Vidyāraṇya, we have, in the 9^(th) chapter this set of verses:

पुनःपुनर्विचारोऽपि त्रिविधप्रतिबन्धतः ।

न वेत्ति तत्त्वमित्येतद्वार्तिके सम्यगीरितम् ॥ ३८॥

38. In spite of repeated enquiry a man does not realize the truth
    because of three kinds of impediments. This has been clearly pointed
    out in his Vārtika by Āchārya Sureśvara.



कुतस्तज्ज्ञानमिति चेत्तद्धि बन्धपरिक्षयात् ।

असावपि च भूतो वा भावी वा वर्तते तथा ॥ ३९॥

39. If you ask why the realization (which did not arise before) comes
    now, we shall reply that knowledge comes only with the total removal
    of impediments which may be past, present or future.



अधीतवेदवेदार्थोऽप्यत एव न मुच्यते ।

हिरण्यनिधिदृष्टान्तादिदमेव हि दर्शितम् ॥ ४०॥

40. Therefore even by studying the Veda and its meaning a man is not
    released. This has been shown in the example of hidden gold.



अतीतेनापि महिषीस्नेहेन प्रतिबन्धतः ।

भिक्षुस्तत्त्वं न वेदेति गाथा लोके प्रगीयते ॥ ४१॥

41. There is the popular song saying that a monk could not realize the
    truth, the impediment being his past attachment to a she-buffalo.



अनुसृत्य गुरुः स्नेहं महिष्यां तत्त्वमुक्तवान् ।

ततो यथावद्वेदैष प्रतिबन्धस्य सङ्क्षयात् ॥ ४२॥

42. His teacher instructed him of Brahman knowing his attachment to it
    (by telling him that buffalo is the upādhi of Brahman). When the
    impediment was removed, the monk realized the truth properly.



(The quotes from the Panchadaśī ends here\]



The commentator, Sri Rāmakṛṣṇa, clarifies on the ‘popular saying’: A sannyāsin, in his householder life, had developed a deep attachment to a buffalo. Even after coming to be instructed of the Vedānta, he remained inattentive to the lessons. His preceptor noticed this and questioned him as to what was distracting his attention. On hearing about the disciple-monk’s buffalo-affinity, the Āchārya instructed him the highest Brahman with the buffalo-upādhi. In due course the monk became free of the past impediment, the buffalo-attachment, and realized Brahman as taught by the Āchārya and became enlightened.

  

We have the Brahmasutra 4.1.5ब्रह्मदृष्टिरुत्कर्षात्॥ ५ ॥

a part of the bhashyam:ब्रह्मदृष्टिरेव आदित्यादिषु स्यादिति। कस्मात् ? उत्कर्षात् ; एवम् उत्कर्षेण आदित्यादयो दृष्टा भवन्ति, उत्कृष्टदृष्टेस्तेष्वध्यासात् ; तथा च लौकिको न्यायोऽनुगतो भवति ; उत्कृष्टदृष्टिर्हि निकृष्टेऽध्यसितव्येति लौकिको न्यायः — यथा राजदृष्टिः क्षत्तरि ; स च अनुसर्तव्यः विपर्यये प्रत्यवायप्रसङ्गात् ; न हि क्षत्तृदृष्टिपरिगृहीतो राजा निकर्षं नीयमानः श्रेयसे स्यात्।

In the Chandogya Upanishad we also have the नाम्नि ब्रह्मबुद्धिः, etc..
