I have not followed the discussion.  

एकश्रुतिः to my mind is a significant physiological state, where one filters out all other stimuli to the brain.

Lately a term called "intentionality" has come into use in neuroscience. It is an undefined executive monitor.  

एकश्रुतिः can be an asymptotic state but this is where cognition happens. (cognition is not understanding!)  

We get to analyze it in our next brain seminar on Feb 8.
