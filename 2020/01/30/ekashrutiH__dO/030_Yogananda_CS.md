Namaste,

  

Watching this discussion with my interest and involvement in Mathematics / Physics an analogy comes to mind. A vaiyAkaraNi is like a mathematician and vEdAntin is like a physicist. Like a physicist, vEdAntin has to deal with and explain the world while, a vaiyAkaraNi provides and controls the expression. Now and then there are insights in physics which are beyond the mathematics of the day, and indeed, such instances necessitate creation of new mathematical concepts. Harish Chandra, one among great mathematicians of the last century was, at first, a physicistand got his Ph.D. under Dirac, one among all time physics greats. When Harish Chandra expressed certain reservationsin his thesis work, saying that he was a bit weary of lack of mathematical rigor, Dirac is supposed to have remarked that he didn't care for it as long as the physics conclusions drawn were correct!
