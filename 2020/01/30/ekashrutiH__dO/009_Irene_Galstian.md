Venkat ji,  
  
This is an excellent idea.  
  
What we're receiving here conveniently into our mailboxes is treasure  
that would have taken much time to assemble - and even that assuming  
we'd know where to look. With each of Shri Korada's  
mini-encyclopedias, we not only receive answers to the question in the  
post but become keen to examine the cited texts further.  
  
Not too long ago, there was a post about a group working on creating a  
traditional Indian Wikipedia. It would be good to compile questions  
and answers, then create an entry on that platform, so the teaching  
reaches people who come searching for this information.  
  
Let's discuss possibilities on and off the list to see what can be done.  
  
Irene
