Sir

  

At end of the day Math never lies.

Physical models are constructed around empirical data and not the other way around.

  

Every physicist worth his salt knows that when the data or math does not sync with the model the latter needs to be thrown out for a new one.

  

To modify or tweak the data to fit into the model even in today's fallen moral standards would invite opprobium.

  

Dirac's statement has its own context.

Lack of Math rigor would result in a very confused world. Imagine booking a flight to Delhi and landing in Peshawar.

Upasana marga is engineering and needs to be precise and unambiguous.

The damage from a laissez-faire attitude here would be more damaging than landing in Pakistan.

  

Regards,
