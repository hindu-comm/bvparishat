Sir

  

In the Geeta 10-25 we read -

  

yajnanam japa-yajno 'smi  
sthavaranam himalayah

  

Bhagawan said ''Of all Yajnas I am the Japa Yajna''. Therefore is it fine to recite the mantra inएकश्रुति in Japa Yajna also? If Japa is done for daily practice and Nitya Karma it cannot beएकश्रुति. But if it is done as mental Yajna?
