A. Further on implementation of LoD:  
 "Spreading it out" allows for information to seep through the system (so there are no information gaps). e.g.,  
 1) continuity: elections continuously and evenly spread over the 5-year yuga, with the results of each phase available to the next phase.  
 2) elasticity: it can be so that the incumbent rAjA cannot be dislodged if he has atleast, say, a 45% mandate; this also helps his successor by having atleast a 55% (a cushion of 10%) mandate to start with.

B. {L3,L4,..,Ln} & the 10%-Law:  
The set of laukika laws L{}={L3,L4,..,Ln} is valid if the "*government-people"* constitute atleast 10% of the total population.  
Even this condition is necessary but not sufficient. For conditions of sufficiency consider the following:

C. An extreme case:  
What if the rest 90% are not random (w.r.t. L{}) laity, and there is another 10% emergent group which keeps sending out the following control signal: \~L{}  
i.e. controls that say "reject L3", "reject L4", etc. As a result the 10%-government-group is nuetralised.

D. The sufficiency condtion:  
Statement: "There is a set G{} of people that enforces the condition: \~\~L{} = L{}."  
In simple words, G{} suppresses the \~L{} signals. G{} is theoretically not part of the 10%-government-group, but complementary to it. G{} is certainly not the Police/Judiciary whose mandate is to suppress random \~L{} and not the concerted \~L{}.

E. Theoretical characteristics of G{}:  
1) "*gupta-chara-s",*with L{} being non-applicable to G{}.  
2) lacks heirarchy, peer managed, single-point-interface-with-government.  
3) members of G{} make analysis reports on the signal-originator-10% of the 10%-control-group, or even the 10% thereof, and carry out the quarantining themselves. The end result is that \~L{} signals get randomised again.  
4) reports are then peer approved.
