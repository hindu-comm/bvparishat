(Submitting this brain teaser as a playful ode to Shri Saraswati.)

Laws of Aggregates:

Let Y1,Y2,Y3, and Y4 denote different "truth contents" (manifest mostly, but not always, as religions or value systems) subscribed to by various human groups. Let "\<" denote the relation, "is a subset of", having the chain rule: Y1\< Y2\< Y3\< Y4.

e.g. Y1 is a subset of Y2, Y2 is a subset of Y3, etc. Since all Y's are manifest, all are necessarily True - differing only in the size of truth content as expressed by "\<".

Let X1, X2, X3 and X4 denote different "truth perspectives" (manifest mostly, but not always, as political systems) subscribed to by various human groups. Let "/" denote the relation, "is to the left of", having the chain rule: X1/X2/X3/X4.

X4= conservative = right  
X3= liberal = moderate right  
X2= progressive = moderate left  
X1= radical = left  
(note: in India X1 is mislabeled as liberal. Swatantra party 1959-1974 actually being the only X3 manifestation)

Hypothesis: a nation-aggregate is the same as some combination \[Xi, Yj\] at a particular point in time.

Definition: secularism is the 'separation of concerns' of X and Y, resulting in the above hypothesis becoming a working principle.

Conclusion: given the hypothesis, secularism is True.

Example: let Y2= Christianity, then the current secular state of USA = \[X4,Y2\].

The Law of diversity:  
If Yi\< Yj\< Yk then \[X,Yj\] accomodates Yi and persecutes Yk.

Proof sketch: Yj is a superset of Yi so it already contains all the truth content of Yi the subset. Yj may even need Yi for its own validation. OTOH Yj is a subset of Yk so there is some truth content (in Yk) that is alien to Yj.

Case studies:  
1) it is impossible for Y3, for example, to ever gain accomodation for example in \[X,Y2\] countries. Second gen immigrants are all \[Y2\].  
2) M.K.Gandhi correctly saw it as the fault of Y3-groups themselves that led to their entrapments in \[X,Y1\]. (also refer Yk(i,j) defined below).

The Law of subversion:  
given: Yi\< Yj\< Yk  
The subversion of a \[X,Yk\] is achieved by the coalition of the groups directly adhering to Yj,Yi and the groups adhering to Yk but coming from its own Yj,Yi subdomains. Let the latter group be denoted as Yk(i,j).

The Law of the Worse:  
Any X+Y is better than any \[X\] or any \[Y\] (i.e. attempted nation aggregates with a single dimension). Again, any \[X,Y\] (i.e. secular) is better than any X+Y (i.e. unresolved concerns).

Example: India=\[X2\].  
1) Preferable: \[X,Y3\].  
2) Less preferable: \[X,Y2\].

1 is the first preference, but 2 may emerge as a compromise, given tail heavy skew Y3(1,2) typical of a place that has been, much like Africa, a source of human migrations.

Example of "tail heavy"/ Y3(1,2):  
Parsi came to the subcontinent and became elite, gypsies OTOH went out and became the dregs.  
Side note: Y3(3) can only statistically emerge from Y3(1,2); there is no way pure Y3 can willingly immigrate to Y2+Y1. There is no such thing as pure Y3.(re:Aryan question)

Y3(1,2) results in a seeming contradiction, with a group adhering to Y3 but its majority being less truth-aware than various groups explicitly adhering to Y2 and Y1.

Challenge before \[X,Y3\]:  
If the aggregate doesn't hold, its Y3(1,2)-heavy groups become targets of slavery and exploitations (e.g. deploying in wars, body farming, etc).

Need of 'movements':  
Movements that bring inertial momentum to tail-heavy Y3 are the only way before \[X,Y3\], irrespective of whichever X resides with Y3 in the particular point in time.
