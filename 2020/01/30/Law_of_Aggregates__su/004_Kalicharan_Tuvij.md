Sir,

 In plain words, this thread abstracts the principles on which a country runs. This helps in thinking precise over multiple problems that countries such as ours face.

 The framework is Hindu mysticism, though a veneer of "theorem-proof" and "set-theory" is used in a somewhat sarcastic way (without denting the validity of results arrived).

 The primary target is younger audience (who visit this forum) who can muster (time & energy!) multidisciplinary effort needed to understand the writing in finer detail. Which in turn lets the author make further refinement.
