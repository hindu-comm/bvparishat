Clarification:

The 'vertical separation' of concerns resulting in aggregate \[Xi,Yj\] doesn't mean that either X or Y is to be relegated to insignificance. On the contrary, every manifestation (x,y), big or small, mundane or special, of \[Xi,Yj\] retains both dimensions. Secularism then, and therefore, means Efficiency - nothing more nothing less.

  

Further,

\[Xi,Yj\] needs one more separation of concerns, this time 'horizontal' not 'vertical', to become a democratic-aggregate.

  

Law of Democracy (LoD):

Vote=Cash.

  

  Since explaining this generically would take some space and time, let me give an implementational example pertaining to the case of hypothetical \[Xi,Y3\].

  

"How to enforce common law that makes no exception whstsover for any group of people or circumstances yet is just and right?"

  This is only possible if the law be based on some deep yet natural law (LoD).

  

  Let the base value of a vote in a \[Xi,Y3\]-democratic be: Z rupees per month.

  

  If a person of voting age didn't vote in the last election, he gets Z till the next election.

Z is premultiplied by factor p where:

p= 1 if having 0 kid

p= 2 if having 1 kid

p= 2 if having 2 kid

p= 1/(n-2) if having n>=3 kids

  

here, 'kid'= child any age.  

  

Z,p actual values are fixed by the elected representatives.

  

Corollary: all democratic-aggregates are different working manifestations (=horizontally resolved/efficient to varying degrees) of the LoD.
