A.  
LoD clarification:  
This law manifests in different democracies in various inefficient ways. One of these is: a set of people (say "S") garnering the rental in the name of respective groups (the unintended vote banks).  
 This then results in the manifestation of various arbitrary/discriminatory laws which end up benefitting S and not any groups.  
 LoD bypasses the middlemen by directly transferring the rental to the needy. The right way (=slow) to implement LoD is then to start with minimal vote-related-rental, commensurate with gradual suspension of rental outlays to S.

B.  
 In a rare scenario, everyone opts for rental and no one opts for vote - this happens when the current "autocrat" is exceptionally good. No harm.

C.  
Summary thus far:  
There are two natural laws of democratic-aggregates: 1) secularism, & 2) LoD.  
Though already present, if transparently acknowledged these can result in increased efficiency of the aggregate.  
Let us call these two laws as L1 & L2.

D.  
The set of other laws {L3, L4,..,Ln} is *laukika,* subject to kAla and desha. The question here is then: what makes this set valid?  
The answer to this starts with another law:

E.  
 "The law of 10%"  
 Statement: the 10% controls the 100%.

 Proof sketch:

 x people are able to control n people iff the growth of control signal is more than the growth of affected people (i.e. x/n). In simple words, control-signal grows more than the number of controlled-people grows.  
 Let a person send a random control signal to everyone. Since the signal is random a receiver person agrees with it only by, say, t% and not 100%. Infact a receiver person agrees by t% to each of the random signals sent to him the rest (n-1) people.  
=> (n-1)\*t = 100% => t = 100/(n-1)% = 1/(n-1) in fraction.  
 This means, the amplification of a signal by one person is (1+ 1/(n-1)). For a group of x people generating the same (not random this time) signal, the amplification compounded is therefore (1+ 1/(n-1))^x.  
 If x is the minimum control group, x is the minimum integer for which:  
round(100\*((1+1/(n-1))^x - 1)) \> round(100\*x/n)  
 taking n= 100 => x= 10. (QED)
