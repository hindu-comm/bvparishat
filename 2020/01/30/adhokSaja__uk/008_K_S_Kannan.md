"When the group of senses take a downward course" - is indeed such a poor, literal, translation, not catching the spirit.

  

The yogic process is essentially one of turning the senses on an upward/inward course. "adhobhUta" is therefore "getting subordinate" = the opposite of their generally rebellious state viz. one of being turned downward/outward course. Introvertion of the gaze is the desired end at first ( AvRtta-caks"us"), demanding "courage" (kas'cid dhIraH).
