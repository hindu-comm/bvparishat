You are right, sir.

However, we may note that suppression is still a better word than repression. Ultimately, conquest, regulation, blocking, turning inwards, sublimation, stilling, and a few more words are used to indicate transcending the sense-organs. It is a question at once of the imagery that is preferred, and the actual yogic process involved. The indriya-s are sometimes just horses, sometimes thieves etc .

indriyani hayAn AhuH

corair mahAbalibhir indriya- nAmadheyaih & c. Our faculties are sometimes rebellious, sometimes neutral etc.
