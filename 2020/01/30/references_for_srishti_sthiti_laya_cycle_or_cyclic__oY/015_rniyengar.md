IMHO without first defining the word "cyclic", discussions and claims of 'cyclic time' are untenable. Let me explain my discomfort with this phrase. When we like to measure a long distance on ground, we make a mark and measure with a chain or tape that may be say 50 meters. (It is understood what meter, angula, yojana, Km means). We stretch the tape 3 times or 4 times and declare the length to be 3x50 or 4x50 meters. This concept of one dimensional space of equal length seems to have been extended to coin the phrase 'cyclic time'. In other words Time can be measured (with pre-defined units: kalA, mAsa, years, yuga, kalpa,.. and still other words) in terms of cycles of oscillations/changes/repititions, starting from a commonly accepted reference; but this does not make Time cyclic. In the MaitrayaNIya araNyaka we read सूर्योयोनि: कालस्य but the text in the next sentence mentions about the ***form of time*** in terms of unit measures, nimeSa, vatsara etc. and advises कालं ब्रह्मेत्युपासीत कालः तस्यातिदूरमपसरति \|\|

I would be happy if members can clarify the concept of kAla, (not just the word) in the Vedas and also explain how and why that can be taken to be "cyclic".

Progeny, rebirth, pUrveyuge etc does not establish Time in the Vedas to be cyclic. For day to day use ( particularly for historicity of events) one may use such a phrase if there is common understanding of the technical words.
