The phrase 'cyclic time' is used by modern scholars. When such a usage happens, we try to understand in what sense they used that phrase. From all the usages, we see that the users of the phrase use the word 'time' metaphorically, to refer to the happenings in time, or the nature , state, status of those happenings in time. For example what are cyclically occurring are the seasons in a year. If year is the name given to the time of the length during which seasonal changes in nature are repeated , then to call year as ' cyclic time ' is metaphorical. It is used in the sense of time taken for a cyclic change in nature.

  

Similarly, if events or nature of events is believed to be repeated in long durations such as centuries and millennia, such a view is given the name 'cyclic time'.
