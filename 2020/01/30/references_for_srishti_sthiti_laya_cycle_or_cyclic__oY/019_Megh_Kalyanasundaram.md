From*The Temporal Dichotomy: ‘Linear’ vs ‘Cyclic’ Time*(pp. 45-7) in Professor C.K. Raju's *The Eleven pictures of Time* (SAGE, 2003) :****

> "Though motivated by a desire for a moral dichotomy—a sharp > distinction between good and bad—the curse against ‘cyclic’ time had a > strange longer-term consequence. It created a belief in a temporal > dichotomy: a belief that there are exactly two conflicting pictures of > time—‘linear’ time vs ‘cyclic’ time. ...**Third, the categories are > not well-defined**, for pictures in the same category may be > incompatible.**To summarise, the categories of ‘linear’ and ‘cyclic’ > time are spurious: forcibly packing many pictures of time into these > two categories invites incoherence**. Originating in medieval > theology, this spurious categorisation has deeply infiltrated science, > from the time of Newton." \[p. 45-6\]

  

*Fig. 2: Types of 'linear' time*in p. 47 (with illustrations of "MUNDANE TIME", "SUPERLINEAR TIME", "APOCALYPTIC TIME") might be of relevance.
