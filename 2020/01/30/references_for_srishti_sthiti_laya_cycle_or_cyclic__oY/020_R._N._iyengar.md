Dear Megh,

Your post makes lot of sense. As CK Raju rightly points out western intellectuals havecreated a belief in atemporaldichotomy.This has gone to the extent of declaring "Hindus lack sense of history due to their concept of Cyclic Time" . It would follow that good sense of history among westerners is because they believe that God created the world on a Thursday some 4000 and odd years before present, which is Linear Time!

This judeo-xtiian model has been mentally constructed backwards to Bigbang by scientists and to # PIE by linguists.
