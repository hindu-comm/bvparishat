Dear Megh,

  

I found the following a good read (including Linear & Cyclic Time)

  

*Does India Have History? Does History Have India? by THOMAS R. TRAUTMANN  
*

*  
*

*Comparative Studies in Society and History 20 1 2;54( 1 ): 1 74-205.*

  

Excerpts:

  

".... the main point for present purposes will be that Eliade's construct of the history-fleeing archaic man comes from the very civilizations that compiled lists of kings and recorded the deeds of past kings for the edification of contemporary ones, and scrutinized the skies to discover the future - that is, who wrote the first histories. Eliade's big idea just does not hold together.

"Between them, Hegel and the anti-Hegelian Eliade, among others, collaborate in promoting a strong contrast between cyclical and linear time-senses, attributing

the first to nature, or "archaic man," or the Indians, or the non-West, and the latter to the Greeks, to the Bible, to Europe, to modernity. I believe this is

wrong and leads us down false paths. There are two good reasons to believe a hard opposition of lineal and cyclical time is mistaken. One of them is that they are not true opposites. The second is that it wrongly takes the cyclical time of the Indian theory of world ages to be primordial."
