Respected Dr. Paturiji,

Jai Shri Ram!

Aghamarshana-Sukta of the Rigveda is very clear धाता यथा पूर्वं अकल्पयत् !

Similarly, the Purusha Sukta has described "Creation" in detail, and it appears to be talking about the earlier cycles of the samein the end, but Acharya Sayana has interpreted it in a different way!

Regarding, "Samvatsarah"--in several Vedic texts, a year has been discussed in terms of "yajnya" itself especially since rituals were to be correlated to a "samvatsarah". The Purusha Sukta says पुरुषेवेदं सर्वं यद् भूतं यच्च भव्यं, but in the same breath it say, वसन्तो स्यासीदाज्यं ग्रीष्म इद्मः शरद्धविः

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
