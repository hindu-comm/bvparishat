Namaste,

  

As I see references to Carlo Rovelli's work on time and the larger considerations surrounding it, I wanted to draw attention to the work of two young Indians, one of them now the youngest to have completed his doctoral dissertation on the subject at Perimeter Institute, who have contributed significantly to the topic. They are Vasudev Shyam and Madhavan Venkatesh, both from Bangalore. They wrote the following papers in high school:

  

<https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.5619>

  

<https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/2038276973_Vasudev_Shyam>

  

Both of them have used presymplectic geometry to arrive at the significant result - there is fundamentally no time as a dimension, as used in fundamental physics and have corresponded extensively with Carlo Rovelli too on the same.

  

I thought I'd bring it to attention to show how two very young Indians have made fundamental contributions on this matter in the scientific community.

  

Warmly

Manogna
