Excellent point. I had been looking for literature on counting, but have not succeeded.

A measurement is a function of creating a static unit. In the statement like "I have five fingers",

the "finger" is a limb and the assumption is made that all such limbs are similar.  

"five" in the sentence is a mathematical quantity where the limb is reduced to a unit.

I think the Jaina literature might have dealt with this in developing their theory of numbers.

I would like people to think the relevance of Jaina literature on the measurements,

particularly any text on counting and number theory.
