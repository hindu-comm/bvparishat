\> The verse, which I quoted from memory is not Kalhana's, I believe.  
  

It is from Śrīvara's Rājataraṅgiṇī (1.5.75); the third pāda actually  
reads: pustakān sakalān sarvāṃs.  
  
Another iconoclast was King Harṣa of Kashmir (1058/59-1101), who  
carried out extensive temple plunderings and destroyed numerous  
statues of deities (Kalhaṇa's Rājataraṅgiṇī 7.1073 ff.).  
  
Best,
