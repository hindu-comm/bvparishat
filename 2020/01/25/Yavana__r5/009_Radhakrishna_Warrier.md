Interesting that there is so much mention of the “Yavana” in ancient India literature. Is the full monograph available anywhere?

  

On a lighter note, here is an old Malayalam movie song:

  

“O Greek beauty (“Yavana Sundarī”) please accept these coral jasmine flowers (“paviẓamalli” = pārijāta flower).”

There is a story that connects the pārijāta (paviẓamalli), Lord Krishna and his wives Satyabhāma and Rukmiṇi. Anyone knows it? 😊

  

Oh, my thoughts have strayed from Yavana to pārijāta to Lord Krishna!

Radhakrishna Warrier
