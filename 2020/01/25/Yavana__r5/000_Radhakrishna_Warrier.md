I have taken this from Dr. Kannan’s post in which he quotes Kalhaṇa’s Rājataraṅgiṇi:

  

“sekandhara-dharAnAtho

   yavanaiH preritaH purA \|

pustakAni ca sarvANi

   tRNany agnir ivAdahat \|\|”

  

The use of the word “yavanaiḥ” is interesting. Here, a Muslim from outside India is called a “Yavana”.



I believe that in Sanskrit, in the ancient days the word “Yavana” was used to denote a person of Greek origin. This word could be related to “Ionia” which was once a Greek speaking area but now part of modern Turkey. Compare “Yavana” with “Yūnān”, the Arabic and modern Persian word for Greece and also “Yauna”, the old Persian word for Greece. 

  

I think in the course of time, the word “Yavana” came to be used in Sanskrit for both Romans and Greeks. Looks like in medieval times the word came to be used for all people from west of Persia. Is the word “kāla yavana” for black Africans? Similarly, in the ancient days the word “Hūṇa” was used only for the Huns who came to India from Central Asia. But in the course of time this word came to be used for all westerners including Arabs and Europeans.



In Malayalam, one of the words used for a Muslim man is “Jōṉakaṉ” (the last “aṉ” in this word is the Malayalam masculine singular suffix; feminine is Jōṉakatti; the plural is formed by either the “ar” or the “mār”suffix). A mosque is called in this dialect of Malayalam as a jōṉaka paḷḷi (“paḷḷi” is the word used for non-Hindu places of worship).
I believe Jōṉakaṉ is ultimately related to the word Yavana. The other words for a Muslim man are “tulukkaṉ” (Sanskrit “turuṣka”, Turk),
“mēttaṉ” (probably from Sanskrit “mleccha”) and “māppiḷa” (mahā piḷḷa?).
