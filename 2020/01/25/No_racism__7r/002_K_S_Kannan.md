Dear Rishi Goswami-ji,

  

Both the conjectures presented by you make sense.

  

It is not always necessary for great scientists to be very honest also

\- as, for example, with Newton or Bacon.

It is only detailed and authentic biographies  

that can shed more/fuller light on the issue.

  

Regards
