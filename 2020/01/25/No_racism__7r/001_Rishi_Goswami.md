Thankyou Guruji for the article.

I will take some time out and search about this a bit more, in order to know the context of what he has uttered.

I couldn't grasp the entire meaning of the quotation, what does he mean by "forward"?

Also, what I assume now, it can be 2 things. 1) Einstein's views changed on Bharat slowly 2) He praised Bharat (Gita, Gandhiji etc) to show the world but his personal views were in his diary.

I'd like to know more on this.
