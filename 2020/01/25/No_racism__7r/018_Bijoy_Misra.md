A question why is not always analytic. Why three gunas, why seven colors, why eight rasas

are good questions, but are only argumentative. We do not have the analytic reasoning on

perception yet. Depending on your background you can dive deeper into each of these and more.  

Take the yama and niyama which you can experiment yourself.  

Possibly you have to search very old literature. You must reject all hand-waving opinions.

More fundamental question is if the universe is analog and appear digital because of our senses.

(now you go with five senses, there are hybrids!)
