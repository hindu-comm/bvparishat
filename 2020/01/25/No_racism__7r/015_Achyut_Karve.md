Discrimination (भेद) is the basis of knowledge. Choice is based on the ability to discriminate. The division of the animal world into opposite sexes in nature for the sake of reproduction is in fact splitting one into two. In this process one should recognize that transgender is a natural anomaly and so is the ethenic divide or skin colour divide.
However the point is how to get over it when it relates to the same species. The concept of dharma or shuddha does not exist at the individual or particular level it exists at the general level. It is therefore obvious that the born ability to discriminate needs to be put under conscious or aware behaviour that is all that sanskruti or samskar is about. Yes in fact every one is born a racist however one needs to overcome it by conscious effort. Practice of Yoga is the only way out.

  

One needs to grant that phobic and phillic are natural characteristics.
It is through them that nature operates.

  

With regards,  

Achyut Karve.
