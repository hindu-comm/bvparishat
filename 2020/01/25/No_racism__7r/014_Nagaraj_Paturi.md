Sure, sir. But also remember the whole discussion was about your guess.

  

There is no description of a social system called varNa in the texts where it is described, supporting the view that that system has to with skin color.

  

It is a social system found in books.

  

The real social system in reality that is and has been prevalent in India is a system that is known through names such as jaat, jaati, kulamu, kula, kulavu etc.

  

My basic point is : All Indic people must work for removing 'Caste' from the chapters /syllabus divisions on 'Stratification' because stratification is not the defining feature of caste = jaati/jaat / kulamu/ kulavu  
  
Endogamy, Membership by birth, Hereditary occupations are the defining features of a social group called caste = jaati/jaat / kulamu/ kulavu.  
  
The word 'caste' as an English word with its Portuguese origin, seems to have an association with stratification. In that sense, The theory of 'European origins of Caste' could probably make some sense.  
  
But the fact is that the word caste is in fact being used as the English synonym for jaati/jaat / kulamu/ kulavu used in various Indian languages. jaati/jaat / kulamu/ kulavu used in various Indian languages does not refer to a group of a certain stratum. The idea of stratum is not there in either the etymology or connotation of the words such as
jaati/jaat / kulamu/ kulavu .   
  
Social groups which are by definition stratified are : A group of Superintendents of Police \> A group of Deputy Superintendents of Police \> A group of Inspectors of Police \> A group of Sub-Inspectors of Police \> A group of Constables of Police  
  
Potters, Carpenters, Washermen, Haircutters, Blacksmiths, Goldsmiths, Weavers etc. are not such strata.  
  
 jaati/jaat / kulamu/ kulavu refer to such groupings as Potters, Carpenters, Washermen, Haircutters, Blacksmiths, Goldsmiths, Weavers etc. They are groups with the features of Endogamy, Membership by birth, Hereditary occupations.  
  
Modern occupational groups which do not have the features of Endogamy, Membership by birth, Hereditary occupations also get stratified in terms of status, rank etc.   
  
Caste is not a stratum.  
  
Caste is a social group.  
  
Class either as economic class or social class is a stratum.  
  
Castes are not classes.  
  
Castes may get stratified. But each caste does not form one stratum.  
  
Several castes may fall under one stratum.  

  

Varna system is system that exists only in texts. What exists in reality is only jaati/jaat/kulang/kulavu system only. People of caste = jaat / kulamu held Varna as model to be emulated and aspired. Some emulated the Brahmin varna . M N Srinivas called it Sanskrutization. He did not discuss Vaisyaization and Kshatriyaizaction. But it happened  

  

Kshatriya-emulation was done by Brahmins too. Raos, Rajus etc. at the end of their names and many other such features are result of this only. You have setty-ending caste names, family names and personal names among non-komati castes.  

  

castes when went to live in isolation got tribalized. Tribes when went to live with other tribes or castes, turned into castes. Whom govt calls ST, claim themselves to be castes. Some forest STs claim to have migrated to forest from a caste life. Village STs are called caste by other villagers.
