Namaste

  

I heard in Astrology the Budha planet is the ruler of Intellect. But this Budha when he is close to the Sun becomes Dagdha or burnt. That Dagdha intellect is inferior. Similarly in India because of the hot sun in many places the Intelligence will suffer and is inferior. In cold climate the Intelligence is sharp.

  

Another health principle is keep the head cool and feet warm. Brain should always be kept in cool temperature. Why the brain must be cool? Because thinking generates heat and it must not be left to degrade the brain. Computers have fans to cool them. In earlier days the computer was kept in AC room because number crunching operations generate heat. It must be cooled.
