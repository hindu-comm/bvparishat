Respected Scholars of the BVP group,

  

Namaste!

  

I am searching for the commentary of **Vidyasurabhi (विद्यासुरभिः)**by **Jnanamritamuni (ज्ञानामृतमुनि** pupil of Uttamamrita Muni). I have two anothercommentaries of the Naishkarmyasiddhi - (1) Chandrika by ज्ञानोत्तममुनि and (2) Kleshapaharini by सच्चिदानन्दसरस्वती. But I am in search of**Vidyasurabhi (विद्यासुरभिः)**by**Jnanamritamuni.**

  

Additionally, here I would like to mention that renowned writer **R. Thangaswami** in his book "**Advaita Vedanta Literature - A Bibliographical Survey**" ( p. 413) says that is commentary is available with Adyar Library and has not published.  

  

Any link or PDF of**Vidyasurabhi**can be shared. I will be obliged.

  

With regards

**Dr. Janakisharan Acharya**
