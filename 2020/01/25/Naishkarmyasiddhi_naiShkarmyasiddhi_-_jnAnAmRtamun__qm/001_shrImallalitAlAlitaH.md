That work is not yet published.

I took this work, but stopped as soon as I heard that this was taken as a part of project by some professor from Chennai.  

As far as I know, one Prof from Madras Sanskrit College is editing that and it may be published soon.

Another commentary by akhilAtmA was being edited by Prof Narayana Kutty. It is going slow, because of his health.
