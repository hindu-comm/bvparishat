Friends,

  

I spent the last six months in studying the history of the British Period

in India. The people who touted themselves as scholars were trained

as soldiers and had the job of maintaining the Empire. Through boredom

and to engage the new English-educated youth in India, these people

turned part of their work into "studies" taking a massive array of natives  

under their control. The reports and the "studies" were sanitized to protect  

the Crown and to establish racial bias. The colonialists did establish  

universities to grant degrees and not to conduct research. The Association

for Cultivation of Science was built through private funds. Sir CV Raman  

did his research in off-time from his accounting job. Indian Institute of Science  

and other institutions came through private funds.

  

The history is sad and disheartening. The west, particularly the British have

huge obligation to reflect on their selfish conduct touting it as scholarship. Most

of India's wealth including a large trove of manuscripts were exported out by these  

"scholars".. Some are hunting manuscripts even today possibly with the same  

attitude!
