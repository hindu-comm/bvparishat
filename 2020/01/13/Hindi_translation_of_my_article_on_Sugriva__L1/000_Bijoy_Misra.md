Friends,

I took up Valmiki reading in 2013 after being dissatisfied with the available translations.

My goal was to understand Valmiki as an author and a poet and to examine the plot

as objectively I can. Whether the legend existed or Rama lived is not of particular interest.  

Most stories could be empirical and natural, but they possibly appear natural through the  

art of storytelling. A story probably has the art of education.
Education carries cultural

value, the importance of objects in life. Education is different than prescriptive religion.

Education analyzes how one defines goodness and what would be accepted as righteousness.  

It is a struggle between self-preservation against supporting the life in the universe. Valmiki

is one of the early thinkers who apparently understood the value of education and possibly  

makes efforts to educate his students through literature and music. I believe, he succeeded.  

I make efforts to bring Valmiki to the world.

  

Here is an advanced post of my translation of the Englsh article. It will appear in

the magazine Garbhanal ([www.garbhanal.com](http://www.garbhanal.com)) in the Feb issue.

Thank you.
