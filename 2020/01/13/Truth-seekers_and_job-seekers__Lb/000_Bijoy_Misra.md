Friends,

  

Through our several years of studies of India, we encountered many valuable

contributions from foreign visitors. While I admired Chinese scholarship, I loved  

the authenticity of Al Biruni. Abul Fazl also comes out pretty scholarly talking

about his roots and his predicament as an employee in Akbar's court.

The follow up visitors are sloppy and show little respect to the topic

they write about. I have not understood if this part is a one of cultural training

or if it represents a poor sample of people operating in the colony. I have a deep  

interest to know why people choose India to study. Is it curiosity or fulfillment of  

the duties in a job? I meet many of the new India scholars in campus, they don't  

have any particular liking of things they do. They operate on correlations and avoid

analytic investigation. They have little capacity to think outside the box and easily  

move into political topics. (Modi good or bad, why should a scholar care? )

Occasionally good scholars like Ingalls and Cardona do appear.

  

While job-seeking would always be there, truth-seeking is the goal of scholarship.

A scholar is his/her own audience. Nothing is true if it is not true to the person.

All political indoctrination must be rejected by a scholar. A scholar has no King!   

  

These are from our findings through our studies. I will write more extensively elsewhere.  

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
