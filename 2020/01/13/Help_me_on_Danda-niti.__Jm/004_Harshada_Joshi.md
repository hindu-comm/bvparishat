Namo namah,

You may kindly refer to the voluminous work by Mahamahopadhyaya P. V. Kane titled 'History of Dharmashastra'.

You are sure to get number of references of various treatises on Dandaniti. Out of those, several sources are available on [archive.org](http://archive.org) and other sites.

Thanksand regards,

Harshada Joshi-Sawarkar

University of Mumbai.
