Western historians have besmirched their credibility terribly.

The White Man cannot shake off his great burden as yet,

and going by the strain of dishonesty - inherent perhaps in his genes -  

he never will. History of even science bedevilled by crass Eurocentrism

is a simple yet outstanding example.  

  

The Western strategy of inundation of biased literature,

and of each quoting the other conveniently among themselves, has roused  

strong suspicions that are not easily undone. Their coteries, cliques, and cartels

are essentially subversive, acting by subterfuge towards devious selfish ends

under sophisticated cloaks and masks of unimpeachable honesty.

  

As pure as presstitutes, they must be treated with as much regard as when Virgil said:

"Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes" = I suspect the Greeks even when they bring gifts!
