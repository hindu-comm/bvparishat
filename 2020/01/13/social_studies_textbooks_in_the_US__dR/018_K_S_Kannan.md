Nothing was meant against Mr. Roland Steiner in person or in particular.

Contrary to the lines of defence,

there are some exceptions who are balanced among Western Indologists,

but the majority are unabashed in their prejudices,

and others are covert in their activities.

Monier Williams in his preface to his SEDictionary,

or Max Muller in his letter to his wife are typical examples of the former.

  

Numerous examples of other Indologists are also available.

It is keeping them in mind that the general epithets were employed.

  

I have nothing whatsoever against Mr. Roland Steiner.

The diatribe is only against the general trends and attitudes of the Western Indologists.

  

"Vermin" may be a harsh word,

but the dictionary says it stands for

"people perceived as despicable and as causing problems for the rest of society".

Has somebody kept track of, or rather, can anybody ever give a full account of,

the ruinations and devastations that the colonialists wrought on the Indian soil?

Would anger against them, and their tribe, be deemed unfounded?
