If the statement is made to look like a threat of non-participation,

that is the response it attracts.  

  

MW and MM's words are known to most people on the list.

A waste of time to repeat, I thought.

Were they dishonest, then, in writing so?

  

Yes, when one pontificates on historiography to another as if even its elements need to be taught,  

or seeks to portray how honourable and routine things have all along been,

it becomes a provocation.

  

Can Mr. Steiner assert that there have been no iniquities in historiography whatsoever?

We need no condescensions.  

  

I think I should refrain from handling this any further,

as it would seem a digression.
