It is a well-known method to quickly make a few final assertions and  
at the same time declare the discussion closed.  

  
  
\> Nothing was meant against Mr. Roland Steiner in person or in  

\> particular. \[...\] \> I have nothing whatsoever against Mr. Roland  
\> Steiner.  
  
For me, it is completely irrelevant whether you have something against  
me or not. But that your excessive attacks are also aimed at me  
personally is shown by a statement like: "The List gets no poorer for  
want of participation by avid supporters of racists." You can have  
this opinion, but you should stand by what you have written.  

  
  
  
\> but the majority are unabashed in their prejudices, and others are  
\> covert in their activities. Monier Williams in his preface to his  
\> SEDictionary, or Max Muller in his letter to his wife are typical  

\> examples of the former. \[...\] The diatribe is only against the  

\> general trends and attitudes of the Western Indologists.  
  

The reference to a foreword and to a private letter from two 19th  
century Indologists without further details are truly convincing  
evidence of "the general trends and attitudes of the Western  
Indologists".  
  
  

  
\> But it cannot be denied that there have been overt and covert  
\> provocations for legitimate wrath and fulmination.  
  

With respect, I disagree. Or do you mean your own comments?
