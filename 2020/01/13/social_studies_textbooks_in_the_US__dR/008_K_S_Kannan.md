It is no Indian who wrote The White Man's Burden, sir.

Yes, the sullen creature was born in India,  

but his strain showed itself so well, so openly :  

*Take up the White Man’s burden—*

*Send forth the best ye breed—*

*Go send your sons to exile*

***To serve your captives' need***

*To wait in heavy harness*

*On fluttered folk and wild—*

*Your new-caught, sullen peoples,*

***Half devil and half child...***

***  
***

Or was he autobiographical?****

Themselves racist, they will be the first to brand others racist.***  
***
