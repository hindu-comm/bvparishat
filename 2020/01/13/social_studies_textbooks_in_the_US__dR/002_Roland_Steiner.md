On the question of what historiography is and whether and how it is possible, there are libraries of literature and very different theoretical concepts. My disputable idea of historiography is very simple in theory:  
  
History is the methodically guided, basically always criticizable attempt to reconstruct human past on the basis of critically examined and verifiable sources. This will inevitably involve not only the collection of pure data, but always interpretations and hypotheses as well. But this does not mean that such interpretations and hypotheses are allowed to be arbitrary because they always have to justify themselves against the background of all known sources; this distinguishes historical research from mere narratives. The state of research itself can be controversial. It is also true that historiography itself is done under the conditions of its own time, which in turn can become the subject of future historical research. Although this procedure can even lead to conflicting interpretations: there are justifiable and unjustifiable, probable and improbable or possible and impossible interpretations with regard to the respective state of research and the available data.  
  
Ideological motives of various kinds can lead and actually do lead to distorted historiography or even to falsifications of history (which, by the way, presupposes that there is something like verifiable history and historiography). In these cases, it is not enough to merely impute ideological motives, but one has to demonstrate the respective historical misrepresentation in detail on the basis of a precise knowledge of the sources involved (with reference to verifiable sources). Ideologically motivated historiography can only be refuted by historical research. Assigning a colonialist agenda to "Western" research (whatever exactly is meant by that) in principle is as unhelpful as subjecting the research of Indian historians to a general suspicion of nationalism. At present, there is as little a uniform "Western" approach as there is a different uniform "Indian" approach. More fruitful is the preferably unbiased, critical study and discussion of historical sources and historical research.  
  
History is an interest in what actually happened. To do this, you interview witnesses (= sources) and search for evidence. However, witness statements are only more or less reliable and can even be contradictory. Their statements must be checked against each other and against the known facts. One must consider the possible motives of these witnesses (= sources). For this reason, it is necessary to carefully study the witnesses (= sources) and their environment (= other sources, time, and region). Finally, the attempt is made to reconstruct a coherent overall picture (which may have gaps) This attempted reconstruction then has to face up to criticism (review).
