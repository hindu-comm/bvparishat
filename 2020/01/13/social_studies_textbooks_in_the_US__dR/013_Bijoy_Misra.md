Roland writes what he has been taught. He may not have lived long enough to realize

that what he is taught is incorrect. There is fundamental deceitfulness in any occupation.

Once deceit is accomplished, the rest is coverup, sometimes called history.

Arabs appear to be more objective in this. My late thinking is that the quality of people

who came from Europe were mostly low grade traders, no art, no literature, no taste!

Arabs wanted luxury in life, the British were starving in their country. Europe did produce  

good scholars who did not participate in the occupation. Modern Indology is another type

of occupation by making self-serving theories etc!
