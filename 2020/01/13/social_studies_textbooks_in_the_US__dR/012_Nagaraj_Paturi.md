"Moreover, since the late 20th-century contexts of post-imperial[decolonisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decolonisation "Decolonisation")and of the[developing world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_world "Developing world"), the phrase "The white man's burden" communicates the false good-intentions of Western[neo-colonialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-colonialism "Neo-colonialism")for the non-white world: civilisation by[colonial domination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_dominance_theory "Social dominance theory").^([\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Man%27s_Burden#cite_note-auto1-27)[\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Man%27s_Burden#cite_note-38))"

The formula 'the white man's burden', from Rudyard Kipling's eponymous poem, is emblematic in this respect."; Chisholm, Michael.*Modern World Development: A Geographical Perspective*.

Rieder, John.*Colonialism and the Emergence of Science Fiction*2008. Wesleyan University Press, Middleton, Conn., p. 30: "The proto-narrative of progress operates equally in the ideology of the 'white man's burden' — the belief that non-whites are childlike innocents in need of white men's protection — and the assumptions that undergird Victorian anthropology. From the most legitimate scientific endeavor to the most debased and transparent prejudices runs the common assumption that the relation of the colonizing societies to the colonized ones is that of the developed, modern present to its own undeveloped, primitive past."
