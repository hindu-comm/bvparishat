Data or events on which history is written is actually bland, insipid and sterile. What does the historiographer do? He tries to fit it into a need based ideological framework depending upon his world view. This is where differences of opinions do arise.

  

History in its positive sense guides man in his endeavour to progress.
In its negative sense it becomes the hand tool of oppression in the hands of the ruling classes whoever they may be white, black,coloured, jew, christian or muslim. It has been over 2000 years since India ever ruled itself. First the greeks then the turks and the moghuls and finally the europeans each succeeding the other. Indologists should recognize that there is something so Indian in its people that the invaders have never been in a position overwhelm the Indian soul on which account it still remains united. The Roman Empire tried to keep Europe unified but miserably failed. No better is the fate of the European Union.

  

With a single stream of immigrants from west Asia and Africa the European Union stands shaken with Brexit as its first casualty. India has accommodated immigrants over the centuries and in fact has been ruled by them and as yet the people have not lost their identity. All this because the varna system protected the culture of this land which was based on feudal division of labour. Indologists in the west need to appreciate this fact.

  

Ancient history needs to be written in conformity with the social political and economic condition prevalent at that time after taking into account social political and economic priorities of the time and region. One should not indulge in comparing apples with mangoes and bananas.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
