\> the phrase "The white man's burden"  
  

It is really astonishing that an explanation is still needed here.  
Neither the allusion to Kipling's poem "The White Manâ€™s Burden" is  
racist nor the use of "the phrase 'The white man's burden'" itself,  
but the statement  
  
"and going by the strain of dishonesty - inherent perhaps in his \[=  
the white man's\] genes"  
  
Consequently, we read in one of the subsequent e-mails from the same author:  

  
"What offence did India commit against those vermins?"  
  

Just so that everyone really understands it: it is the use of the term  
"vermins" in this context that is racist.  
  
  
From my side, everything has really been said about that.
