Dear List,

Personally I did not find anything objectionable in the post of Herr Steiner. It is possible some of us may not agree with some of his views. That does not call for such strong reaction as to paint the whole of wetern scholarship as racist. We can criticise a research paper/book/thesis of any author dispassionately but never condemn or abuse the author for his views.
