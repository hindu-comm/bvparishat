I would have definitely loved less harsh and more responsible expressions from a venerated senior colossal polymath scholar. But when I reflect on it, I think that there were patronizing and supremacist expressions such as " biting the feeding hand" hurled against an unsuspecting politely inquiring greatly contributing member.

  

I think we should get back to the academic issue on hand avoiding any more such expressions.
