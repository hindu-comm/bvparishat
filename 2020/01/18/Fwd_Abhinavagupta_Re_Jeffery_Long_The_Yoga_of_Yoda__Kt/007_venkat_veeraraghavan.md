Sir,

  

One of the problems with these movies is the trivialisation of the path to "Vedanta".. theres always a fast download cd/DVD that one can use to learn kung-fu or tai-chi or whatever is required to level-up.

The path with its attendant pain is not even acknowledged far less done justice towards.

  

This reflects the hippy attitude of modern snow-flakery where we have all sorts of people claiming that the "Guru is within" and anything is possible etc.

  

I have seen this attitude reflected in the most ridiculous ways in even supposedly strict (?) institutions.

I am reminded of one Janmaasthami in Melbourne where a "senior" disciple of Bhanu Swami decided to Chant the "purusha sukta" in front of the "homa" fire at the local Iskcon.

The pronunciation was atrocious, svaras nonexistent and it was even hard to run away from because of the crowds. I tried telling the man later but his refrain was that one who chanted the mahamantra can do anything (facepalm!).

TM reminds me of the frog jumps that "paramahamsa" Nityananda has now instituted into his own patented yoga-pill..incidentally has anyone managed to fly yet?

  

Dont know but the circus continues.

  

Sometimes when I think "Ishvaro Rakshat" I wonder if we are even worth the trouble..:)

  

Probably not.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
