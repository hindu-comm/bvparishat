This discussion on Abhinavagupta list continued as follows:

  

Seriously, Star Wars creator George Lucas is a long-time practitioner of TM and \[it is said that\]**he based the Jedi Master character on Maharishi Mahesh Yogi**, the man who left the Himalayas in 1958 to bring this ancient and much needed practice to the modern western world. The same man who taught my teacher, Harry Martinian, TM in NYC in 1968.



A certain band from Liverpool also studied with Maharishi and practice TM. In fact, Paul and Ringo still travel the world with the David Lynch Foundation raising awareness and resources to teach children and veterans the method.



Blake Ian, “[OK, for starters, Yoda practices TM](https://www.tm.org/blog/meditation/three-years-of-transcendental-meditation/)” (*TM Blog*, 07/08/2014)



**George Lucas has taken the instruction in Transcendental Meditation in the 1970's as a student at the University of Southern California and is reportedly still a daily meditator.** He is familiar with the principles Science of Creative Intelligence that describe the practice and help to understand the experience during meditation.



This web page lists the similarities that can be found in his science fiction writings and cinematic work, especially the Star Wars literature. Many non-meditators may miss the significance of many of the quotes and ideas, without the experience to connect them to.



Regular practice of the Transcendental Meditation and TM-Sidhis Program helps to understand the message that George Lucas is trying to convey.**Those who are "in the know" can appreciate more of the deep message contained in his films.**



George Lucas has known of Sidha Master Yogi - Maharishi Mahesh Yogi from the time he learned to meditate. Maharishi means "great teacher" in the tradition of Vedic Masters.**It is apparent from his speech, small stature, and mannerisms that Maharishi has served as George's inspiration model for Jedi Master Yoda.**



The intensive 6-month TM Teacher Training Course (TTC) and 3 month TM-Sidhis Program (including levitation) inspired the training program for Obi-Wan Kenobe, Anakin Skywalker (Darth Vader), and Luke Skywalker.



Whether George Lucas sought to convey these deep principles of Vedic Science consciously or unconsciously, the Star Wars literature and movies have had tremendous Support of Nature (with "The Force"). The theme of "mind being more powerful than matter" are in tune with fundamental truths of the universe, the latest thinking in Physics - and Vedic Science.



The Washington Post published an article: "George Lucas: To feel the true force of 'Star Wars', he had to learn to let it go"

Here is an article about George Lucas and TM.<http://tm-ireland.org/george-lucas>



George Lucas taps into a fundamental desire we all have, to become more in tune with, and master our environment. He provides the examples of Anakin and Luke Skywalker studying, training, and growing up to become Jedi Masters. This can explain why George Lucas has become a multi-billionaire through his work, and why the**Star Wars movies were one of the highest grossing films of all time**.



“[George Lucas, Star Wars, and Transcendental Meditation](http://goldendome.org/lucas/)”





George Lucas learned the Transcendent Meditation technique more than 40 years ago. The internet is full of rumors that the concept of “The Force”, in his Star Wars films, was inspired by Maharishi’s “Science of Creative Intelligence”, the more theoretical background behind the Transcendental Meditation technique. George Lucas has recently given his full support to the initiatives of the David Lynch Foundation. A video was recently published on the website of his Edutopia project (the George Lucas Educational Foundation) about the exceptional success of Transcendental Meditation (Quiet Time) in a school in San Francisco see TM Edutopia Video.



The main editor of Edutopia, after his visit to a school in San Francisco where TM was practiced, said: “Every once in a while, when visiting a successful school, you see something that makes your jaw drop, something so extraordinary, you have to stop and make sure what you saw is actually what it appears to be.”

Hello Paul,



Thanks for bringing to our attention this Maharishi Mahesh angle that adds to the list of Hindu influences on*Star Wars*that Steven Rosen, Jeff Long and HAF are compiling and disseminating.



The SW levitation scenes coupled with the fact Lucas has been a student of TM and continues to support its practice and pedagogy clinches the case.



Considering that the final trilogy is the production of JJ Abrams at Disney, we may wonder how well it continues to reflect the Hindu and Eastern influences that Lucas had channeled…



We hope all is going well and not just with your intense TM seances.



Sunthar
