This reminds me of my meeting with my friend Shri Bharat Sastri at Shringeri. We were discussing the mahasannidhanams of Shringeri.  
Being ignorant I asked him if they would be taking a third peetaadhipati ....obviously i was mentally connecting with the Kanchi system.

He solemnly replied: "No. They have the rule of two."

We were both standing outside the Vidyashankara samadhi shrine.

Unable to hold the gravitas we both burst out laughing.

So yes the world of Yoda and Vedanta have a rather close connection atleast in the psyche.
