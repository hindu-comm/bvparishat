This happens much in the case of householders, including their children, learning the Sandhyavandana mantras. However, in the case the Veda adhyayana in the rigorous gurukula system, ideally, there is the subjecting of the student to strict examination constantly. Only then they become ghanapaaThi-s. Such a regimen gives little room for the possibility of the student grasping and grooving wrong svaras or aksharas/pada-s.
