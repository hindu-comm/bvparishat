Smt Irene ji-  

  

Actually all four orders are required for the Vedic system to survive, since not all people have the same temperament.

Imagine how boring that would be.

  

Kshatriyas were traditionally in charge of enforcing dharma.  

However with their disappearance it is left to the "paterfamilias" to enforce discipline within the families and propagate dharma and karmaanushthana.

Even that has gone for a toss now with the joint family system gone to hell and beyond.

  

The joint family exists in very small rapidly disappearing pockets of the South Indian village and is practically nonexistent in cities.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
