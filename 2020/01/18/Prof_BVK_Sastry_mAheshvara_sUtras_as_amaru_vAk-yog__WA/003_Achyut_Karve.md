Dear Vidwans,

  

Maheshwar Sutras are useful to teach children to phonate all the possible letters that humans voice. It is important to note that the consonants in the Maheshwar are neither recited with intonation or with a prefixed vowel अ.

  

The damaru helps to coordinate speech with laya. It also helps to phonate letters with equal effort (अभ्यंतर प्रयत्न).

In order that each of the consonants can be phonated chastely by prefixing all the vowels both short and long I have composed sutras which I had posted on the list.

  

Here is a video link how the Barakhadi Sutras will prove handy to teach the letters as well as the Barakhadi to children irrespective of the language they speak effectively.

Members on the list might be aware of the amount of money the Govt. spent on the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan during the last ten to twelve years with little success. Even today a big chunk of children cannot read and write even when they reach 5th std. This is a major reason for dropouts in 7th std.

  

The Maheshwar Sutras as well as the barakhadi sutras have the potential of revolutionising primary education thus paving the way to better India's education index which is not showing improvement in spite of massive investment.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
