The earlier Pontiff of Sringeri Peetha, HH Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Swamiji has said: 'If a person is doing the Gayatri as a sadhana by chanting it always, then there is no need for the focus on svaras, etc.' This is about the 'anavarata japa' of a mantra a spiritual sadhaka has received as upadesha. The Acharya has said and also experienced in his own case, that such an anavarata chanting will show effects such as the involuntary chanting of the japa even in one's dream. In such cases the focus is on the sincere commitment to repeating the mantra rather than the svaras, etc.
