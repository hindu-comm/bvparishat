Venkat ji,

  

From what you've written, the conclusion is clear: the sacred ritual, having started once, must never stop. Actually it can't stop, which we'd see immediately if we keep our attention fixed.

A society where everybody senses this state inwardly and consciously keeps to it is a beautiful society. But in a society where a wide divergence of perceptions is present, Kshatriyas are needed for the Brahmanas to remain focussed in this state. This way, in spite of all the possible inconveniences such a division might create, there is always someone in the society who can be approached for help. Human body is highly adaptable and can exist in many states. People who have experienced firsthand how it is to live in the state of ongoing sacred ritual can transmit this to others via in-person interaction, but once such people dwindle in numbers, it's VERY difficult to find this state and stabilise oneself in it from crumbs of writings and sayings here and there.

  

Irene
