Dear Shri Subrahmanian ji  

  

I would not for a moment suggest that a Vedic scholar could pass based on wrong swaras or uccharana.

However the fact remains that it is possible for the vaikhari shabda to be perfect while the internal mapping is nonexistent or worse wrong. This is not something to be surprised about in this day and age since we do not employ Arya-bhaasha for mundane usage. When that is the case, the anomalies of regular speech creep into our upasana as well.

Take a small issue of the श and ष...not knowing where each sound comes from can be disastrous. Shiksha is taught after the learning of the paatha and by that time, it is too late. I specifically asked this question off one of the adhyapakas and he blithely said shiksha is taught only after the entire paatha has been learned and that is more than enough. The problem is that the Yoga aspect of Veda is totally lost on most Vedic Brahmins who look upon it as a sacred duty and nothing more.

"satyaṁ vidhātuṁ nija-bhṛtya-bhāṣitaṁ" is not a mere ideal but a reality for one who has aligned intention all the way through to what comes out through the mouth. I will not comment about Vedic scholars, but I am yet to see one person within nominal "Brahmin circles" who does proper pranayama during sandhyavandana..the actual thing takes atleast 90 seconds to perform properly sagarbha antar-kumbhaka. My cousin who works at Broadcom touched his nose and touched his right ear for a 1 second "pranayama". I asked him why he bothers to spend so much time working in IT for a paycheck. Maybe touching the Broadcom nameplate and coming back home would work too? He sadly did not get the joke.  

  

Gayatri is to be chanted with pluta pranava maha-vyahritis and 5 stops throughout while maintaining proper swara, uccharana and adhering to shiksha. Ultimately mantra manipulates prana in order to do its work. Without a proper mapping and employment the results will not be optimal.

  

Many chant the Gayatri routinely as a matter of duty and yet so few attain to siddhi..or even chitta-shuddhi...if this is not a case of lack of internal mapping what is?

  

Please do correct me if this is not the case.

  

Venkat
