Dear Vidwans,

  

While producing any consumer item a quality check is performed. In a similar manner is a quality check not necessary while we phonate words.
Can it be left to subjective verification?

  

Every adult feels that he has no problems with his speech and that he has a standard tongue. Though that is fine for the speaker the listener faces it when he has to process what he listens to make sense out of what he is listening. This processing time that the listener has to give comes in the way of drawing meaning. This can be experienced when children in school instead of being drawn to what the teacher wants to tell engage themselves in imitating the tics of the teacher.

  

For verification and for quality control it is necessary that one should learn to recite the Maheshwar Sutras with the damaru if not for one's own sake at least for the sake of the listener.  

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
