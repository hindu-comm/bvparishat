Dear Sir

  
The warnings are very clear as in the story of Tvasta and Indra in the TS

``` mantro hIna svarato varNato vA mithyAprayukto na tamarthamAha| sa vAgvajro yajamAnam hinasti yathendraSatru svarato' parAdAt|| ```

  

Much of what the mahasannidhanam said is to be interpreted wrt context. Even if it is to be anavrata japa why use wrong form?

Why disobey the explicit instructions of the Rshis?

Nothing good ever comes out of going against the prescriptions of the seers.

My 2 cents
