Very true.  

Old school is the best way in learning something properly.

  

Do, do and do until the analytical limited mind fatigues and removes itself from the equation. That is when real creativitybegins.

  

Apparently Anthony Hopkins used to repeat a dialogue 250 times before getting on set. I have a feeling the man would have fit right into the schema of mantra-purascharana.

This is how siddhi is obtained.

Michael Phelps took one day off in 10 years of 8 hours per day of visualisation and repeated training. The evidence is right here. It
hasn't gone anywhere.

  

However since this is the iron age or kaliyuga, we must seek the process to excellence in spaces where artha and kaama are the predominating purushaarthas.

  

It is very rare to see such thoroughness in the field of "adhyatma" these days.
