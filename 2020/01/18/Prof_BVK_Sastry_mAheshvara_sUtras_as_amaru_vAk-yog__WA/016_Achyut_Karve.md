Dear Vidwans,

  

Sanskrit occupies a miniscule portion of modern life. The mass of the people use regional languages and English. In this scenerio the question is how can Sanskrit contribute to the well being of society and in the process help the resurrection of Sanskrit? Has making Sanskrit an optional subject at the 10th grade helped in promoting the cause of Sanskrit?

  

Shiksha though important to acquire a chaste knowledge of Sanskrit can serve to improve education in India through regional languages. This will also make Sanskrit education from 5th or 8th standard onwards meaningful and in the process help to improve quality of Sanskrit education at the University level. More stress needs to be given to reading and speaking Sanskrit than writing. Is it not queer to see that children cannot read Sanskrit in spite of they being conversant with the script, leave alone speaking Sanskrit?

  

My effort is aimed in the above direction and the results are assuring.
Sanskrit being a very organized language is much easier to teach than any other language. The major problem is whether the teachers are upto the mark in teaching Sanskrit. If the Shiksha is properly taught at the primary level I think children will develop a taste for Sanskrit.

  

What is the use of a knowledgeable person/teacher if one cannot transfer his knowledge to students?

  

I have seen two stalwarts in Music who were incapable of transfering their art to their students. They would always find fault with the student for one's own disability This scenerio is also present right from the primary level where teachers blame students or their parents for the incapacities of the child or student. This situation needs to change. Can an undergraduate or a graduate become a teacher with a two year DEd. or BEd. course at the primary or secondary level?

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
