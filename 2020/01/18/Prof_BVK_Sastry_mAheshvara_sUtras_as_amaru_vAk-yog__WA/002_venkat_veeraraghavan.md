Thank you Shri. Sastry ji and Shri. Karve ji

  

Finally got to see Dr. Sastry after having read many of his intriguing posts here!!!!

  

Much of this brings into perspective what I saw at Vedapatashalas around Chennai.

  

While the Kanchi run patashalas teach the Vedapaatha first and Shiksha later, the Madhva pathashaalas spend 2 years on Shiksha before introducing the Veda.

  

While this might bring into mind analogy of learning the music before learning the finger positions on the guitar or piano, the issue here is even more insidious than we may realise because the instrument in this case is the subject himself-- much alike an "assembly language- machine code" mapping which is the closest analogy to the vocal apparatus-shabda mappings.

A wrong mapping at an impressionable age is very difficult and nearly impossible to reverse once the damage has been done due to the persistence of rote memory and "solidification of" neural networks.

  

This line of thought reminded me of certain Hindustani music Gurus making their chelas spend years on the 7 swaras and perfect landing on those swaras from different swara-alankara contexts until the chela internalises this to such an extent that it becomes second nature.
