Namaste,

  

I am not competent to reccomend to you books on Vaishanava Rasasastra. I hope others who are knowledgible in this subject will respond to your query.

  

Meanwhile, you may check the following books. The 2nd book is not available on the internet. You may have to buy it or access from your college library.
