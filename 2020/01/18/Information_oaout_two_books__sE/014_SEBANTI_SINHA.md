Sir,

 With due respect I am to inform you that I was successful to download two books from the links provided by you - Hindi Vaisnava Sahitya Me Rasaparikalpana and Ujjval Nilamani. I had been searching for such books for long. So far as I read the books till now I think that they will be useful for my work. In this connection I am again to inform you that at present I have one copy of Kavyadarsha of Dandin with explanation in Hindi Edited by Acharya Ramachandra Mishra publishedby Chowkhamba Vidyabhawan. Now I humbly request you to kindly give link/s to download any other book of Kavyadarsha with Hindi explanation/tika if available.

                                   
                               With regards Sir.

                                   
                                   
                                   
          Ms. S. Sinha..
