Dear Sebanti-ji,

  

It is advisable to share the efforts you made before sending perpetual messages to a helpful scholar member.

  

You may ask for the names of books on poetics written from Vaishnava perspective, put your efforts to search for them.

  

You may approach BVP, when your efforts fail.

  

Please search for Ujjvalaneelamani and/ or Haribhaktarasamritasindhuh , the Gaudiya Vaishnava books.
