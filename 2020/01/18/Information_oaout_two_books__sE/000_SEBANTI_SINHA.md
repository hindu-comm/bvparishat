Sir,

I tried my best but I could not get copies of Kavyalankarasarasangraha of Udbhata and Rasagangadhara of Jagannath with Hindi
Commentary/translation which are urgently needed by me. Kindly help me by giving me an information so that I can get it from internet or elsewhere. I searched for it in Archive.org but found nothing.



                With regards,

                                   
         S. Sinha.
