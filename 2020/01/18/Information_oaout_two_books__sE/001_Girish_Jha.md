Dear Ms Sinha,

You could find the two Hindi translations of the Rasagangadhara as follows:

1.Rasagangadhara-3 Vols.by Madhusudan Shastri-BHU Publ.,Varanasi

2.-do-   complete in 1 Vol.-Sanskrit Comm. by Pt.Badarinath Jha &

                      Hindi Comm. by Pt. Madan Mohan Jha

Of these two Comm. 2nd is very comprehensive. Panditaraj's Nyaya terms have been well elucidated.

But I am not aware of Hindi tr. of Udbhata's book.

Regards,

Girish K. Jha
