To,

Girish Jha,

Sir, I am glad to inform you that I have been searching [archive.org](http://archive.org) for last few days and traced a good number of valuable books. I am also searching for the above two boos. But the collection of books in [archive.org](http://archive.org) is so innumerable that at times it becomes very difficult to trace the books quickly.. So although I am trying to get those two books from [archive.org](http://archive.org) I would fervently request you to kindly give me the links of both the two books as you told if it is readily available with you.

  

                                   
                                   
                                   
                  With regards,

  

                                   
                                   
                                   
                  Ms. S. Sinha.
