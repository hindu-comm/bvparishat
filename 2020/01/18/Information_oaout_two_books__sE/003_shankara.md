Namaste,

  

Giving below links to Rasagangadhara with Hindi commentary.

Chapter 1 - <https://archive.org/details/RasaGangadharaIPt.BadrinathJha/page/n420>

Chapter 2 - <https://archive.org/details/RasaGangadharOfPanditrajJagannathaIIMarmaPrakashNageshaBhatta/page/n806>

  

I could not find Hindi translation or commentary on Udbhata's Kavyalankarasarasangraha. Hindi Sahitya Sammelan had published a Hindi commentary by Rammurti Tripathi in 1966. It seems it is out of print as well as not available on the net. You may have to access it from University library.
