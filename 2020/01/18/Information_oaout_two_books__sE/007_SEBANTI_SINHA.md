Sir,

 I am greatly pleased to inform you that I have downloaded the book 'Prataprudriya' from the link kindly provided by you . It will come to my immense help. Now I convey to you that I have two copies of Vakroktijivitam' of Kuntaka - one of Dr. S. K. De downloaded form internet and the other with Hindi Commentary edited by Shri Radheshyam Mishra published by Choukhamba Sanskrit Sansthan. Sir, is there any other book of Vakroktijivitam with Hindi/English commentary ? If so, kindly give me the link.

                                   
                                   
                      With regards,

                                   
                                   
                                   
                Sm. S. Sinha
