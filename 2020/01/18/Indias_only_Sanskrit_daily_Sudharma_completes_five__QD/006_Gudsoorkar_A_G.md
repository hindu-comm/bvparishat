Respected Shri Ajitjee,

There is no reason why you should get so averse and annoyed to the views of Suresha and Megh. I know ‘Sudharma’ since my childhood. They are appealing to BVP, certainly, for a very good cause.

  

If you personally don’t agree, leave it. It is not civic to discourage them.
