Thank you for this note, Dr Suresha.



That *Sudharma* is celebrating a golden jubilee is, in my view atleast, commendable and a clear testament to the commitment of the people who have been (and are) running it.

  

Here is additional information for those who might like to transact online:

  

Annual Subs. Rs.500/- Sanskrit Calander Rs. 50/- including Postage Each.  

  

SBI, Main Branch, IFSC Code : SBIN0003130, Account No. 32017153837

  

Best,

Megh
