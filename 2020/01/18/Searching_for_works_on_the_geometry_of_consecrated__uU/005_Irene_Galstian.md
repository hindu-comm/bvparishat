Thank you, Dr Narenthiran and Prof Isaacson.

  

The book is definitely out, and a number of libraries already have it.  

I've requested our library to acquire it too. Normally, after the online form is filled, one of the librarians writes back concerning availability and approximate time frame.

  

Dr Narenthiran, since you've familiar with the IFP series, which of the other books in the series should I look at?

  

Irene
