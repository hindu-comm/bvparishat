The story referred to in KSS refers to aerial travel, to *vimAna* and *mahAvimAna*.

Technical details if any are not available in the story.

The date of KSS is roughly that of Bhoja (11th Century).

Lot of corroborative study may be required to assert  

where the work speaks of actual flights, and where, of flights of fancy.
