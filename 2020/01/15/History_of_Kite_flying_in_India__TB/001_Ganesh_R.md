NamaskaaraaH,

  

Even in Sanskrit and classical Kannada literature, I haven't seen any reference to kites. The same I observe in Prakrit and other languages that I know. It is quite interesting to know that the names available to designate kites in Sanskrit are all newly coined and carry the flavour of local languages where kites became popular in later days.

  

With utmost regards and best wishes of makara-samkramana

  

Ganesh. R.
