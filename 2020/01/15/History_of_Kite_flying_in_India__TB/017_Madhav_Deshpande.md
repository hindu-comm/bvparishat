Thanks, Harunaga, for this link to the volume of Indian Linguistics with Gode's article. I have a physical copy of this volume and I was just about to scan this article. It is interesting to see that the oldest use of the word पतंग to refer to a kite is found in the Marathi work योगसंग्राम by a Muslim saint Shekh Mahammad in 1645 A.D. Ekanatha's use of the word वावडी for a kite is also interesting. In modern Marathi, I had heard the phrase वावड्या उडवणे only in the sense of spreading fake news.
