How do you map Pushpaka in this context?

It is a low flying craft propelled with mechanical "horses" that do get disabled in impact with a fair size bird.

Can be repaired and put back in air!

The payload could be a function of number of mechanical devices in action.

The initial lift can be some hot air action!
