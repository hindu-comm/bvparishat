Thanks to Dr. Irene for Gode's paper.

PK Gode cites flying balloons(1241 & 1401 AD) of Europe. It would be of interest to note that Bhoja in his SamaraangaNa-Sutradhaara (1055 AD) does mention such devices. Prof.V.Raghavan's published work on the topic is extracted below (page 62).

 I doubt very much about mercury vapor and ovens mentioned by Prof.Raghavan. AFAIK, the Sanskrit word used is 'sUta' one of its meaning being quick silver or mercury. But *sUta* could just mean propeller/impeller. The learned author himself on P.52 says "...sUta is only a form of Earth".

My guess is *sUta* refers to a mineral oil.
