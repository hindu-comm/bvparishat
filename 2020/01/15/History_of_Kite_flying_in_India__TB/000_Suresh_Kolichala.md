Makara Sankramana Greetings to all!

  

What is the earliest evidence of kites in India? It is generally agreed that kite originated in China and got introduced into India much later, probably around 1200 CE or later. I think Gāthas of Saint Namadeva (संत नामदेव) of Maharashtra (1270-1350) is where we find earliest literary reference to kites in India.

  

Are there any earlier references? Since paper is needed for kites, and as birch-barks and palm-leaves remained the preferred writing surface for literary works through late medieval period in most of India, we can presume that there wasn't wide consumption of paper in mainlandIndia (until 1700s?).

  

In Telugu literature, there are descriptions of Samkrānti festival inkrīḍābhirāmamu (14c),palnāṭi vīracaritra (15c), vijaya vilāsamu (17c),but none of them mention anything about kites. So, when did and how did kites become important part of theuttarāyaṇa/Samkrāntifestival celebration?

  

Are there any other earlierreferences for kites in other regional literature? I appreciate any pointers.

  

Thanks,

Suresh.
