Cf. *kathA-sarit-sAgara* 7.9 :  

The story of Rajyadhara and Pranadhara:

Verse 10:  

काष्ठयन्त्रमयं सर्वम् चेष्टमानं सजीववत्

Verse 11:  

विज्ञायमानं निर्जीव इति वाग्विरहात्परम्

Discernible as lifeless owing to the absence of the faculty of speech,

but otherwise the wooden automaton would function as though it did have life!
