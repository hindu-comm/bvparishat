The sangkalpa for the makara sangkraanti says "uttaraayana punya kaale"

  

It appears then this pooja is really for uttarayanam and not so much for sangkramanam

  

As such we have sangkramana every month which is also a punya kaala. So not sure what is special about makara sangkramana if uttaraayana happens when soorya is in dhanur raashi
