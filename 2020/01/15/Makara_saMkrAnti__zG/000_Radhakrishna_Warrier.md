Happy Makara Saṃkrānti to you all!  



By the way which is the more authentic Sanskrit rendering - Saṃkrānti or Saṅkrānti (संक्रान्ति or सङ्क्रान्ति)? In Malayalam, we use the former (Saṃkrānti സംക്രാന്തി).



Wonder why our ancients chose the day of Sun’s entry into the zodiacal constellation of Makara as an auspicious day of celebrations. 



Although some people identify this day with the beginning of Sun’s apparent movement northwards (Uttarāyaṇa) I believe that our ancient astronomers were smart enough to know that Sun’s entry into the Makara rāśi need not coincide with the beginning of Uttarāyaṇa. The beginning of Uttarāyaṇa happens on the day of Winter Solstice. Winter Solstice occurs nowadays around December 22. Makara Saṃkrānti happens around January 14th nowadays (January 15th in India). Considering the rate of the precession of the equinoxes, Makara Saṃkrānti and Winter Solstice (i.e., Uttarāyaṇa) coincided roughly 1700 years ago, but before that and after that they were/are not coincident events. They coincide once roughly every 26000 years.



The ancient Indian imagery of the Sun traversing the heavens in his chariot drawn by seven horses and driven by the ruddy charioteer Aruṇa is rich, poetic and beautiful. Here is a rendering of the same by Raja Ravi Varma (courtesy Wikipedia: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aru%E1%B9%87a)>
