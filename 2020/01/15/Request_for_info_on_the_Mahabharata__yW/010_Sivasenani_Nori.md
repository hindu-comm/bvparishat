Sir

  

I found the introductions to the BORI critical edition volumes to be excellent sources of criticisms of different episodes.

  

One traditional source that is relevant is Madhvacharya's taatparyanirNaya.

  

While I am sure that you will consider MM Pullela Sriramachandrudu's Telugu book Mahaabhaarata saarasngrahamu, I am mentioning it here in case others end up in this thread. There are some bold assertions in this book such as the one about Dharmaraja not being a name of Yudhishthira, notwithstanding such a usage by Kavitrayam, the translators of Mahabharata into Telugu (The Telugu translation along with the Javanese translation. Is amongst the earliest translations of Mahabharata).

  

Regards

Senani
