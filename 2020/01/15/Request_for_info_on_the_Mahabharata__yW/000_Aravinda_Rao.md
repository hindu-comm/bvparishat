Dear all,

I am planning to start a series of talks on the Mahabharata in a couple of months for the advaita academy website. I request scholarsto suggest any critical writings on the book in English. I have seen the books of Gurucharan Das and Chaturvedi Badrinath.

I could complete my talks on the Ramayana a few months ago for the advaita academy. They are on the you tube in the link

My idea is to follow the same pattern of reading out some relevant lines from the text during the talks and to cover the complete text, leaving out some episodes.

You may also suggest if someone has already given the talks in English on the Mahabharata.

Namaskars,

Aravinda Rao
