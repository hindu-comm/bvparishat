Namah Shivaya



Respected scholars,

I have certain queries on “Varahamihira” who has written Brhatsamhita and Brhatjataka.

  

1) I have heard a story that his name was originally ‘*Mihira’* and he earned the title ‘*Varaha’* by his prediction of the death of the

  

young prince by a *varaha* which indeed happens through the fall of an insignia of the kingdom upon the boy at the precise predicted

  

time. Are there any references for this story in any books or is this more of a folklore?

  

2) The second query is again with regarding the Name. A friend of mine was suggesting this. *Mihira* refers to Sun. *Varaha* can be

split to *vara* and *aha* meaning as the ‘boon’ and ‘day’. So together the name denotes “The Sun that gives auspicious day”. Is this

right? Is there any other way the name could be interpreted upon?

  

  

Kindly dispel my doubts. Thanks a lot in advance.
