Thank you Paturi ji for the response. The upanyasaka said it is of Sri Thyagaraja. Let us see the Annamacharya kriti.

  

The explanation given by the speaker is: Goats eat leaves. Tapasvis give up normal food and sustain on leaves. Infants go about unclothed. Avadhutas are not clad. Donkeys roll in ashes. (Paashupata Vratin-s) Bhasma shaayi tapasvis are there. Yet goats, children, donkeys are not venerated. This is the idea.
