Namaste. 

  

I am looking for the kriti of Sri Thyagaraja where he gives the analogies of goats eating leaf, infants not wearing clothes and donkey rolling in ashes, as their svabhava and they do not become venerable for that. I could not locate the kriti. I request your kind help.

  

I got the above data from an upanyasa.

  

Thanks and regards
