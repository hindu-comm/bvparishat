Thank you Paturi ji for the translation. The 'balamu kulamu' song of Thyagaraja, as I read from the Tamil translation, too gives almost the same analogies, with a few variations. Now I find that various composer-saints have expressed similar sentiments to bring out the traits of true bhakti.

  

In all this, I have not yet found the 'donkey rolling in ashes analogy' connected to Paashupata vrata. The upanyasaka had mentioned this too.
