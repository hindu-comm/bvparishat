Dear Members,

  

  

Is there any reference in shastras to mantras used in hunting game?

There is frequent mention in the Mahabharat about the Pandavas bringing down wild game with "purified arrows"..although many suggest that this means they were not tipped with poison, this inference is unacceptable for the following reason:

\* The inference from the above is that poisoned arrows were used in conventional battle. If this were the case warriors would be dropping dead left, right and centre whenever they were pierced the first time. This apparently was not the case.

  

The term purified arrows implies the use of mantras and tantra to somehow divinise an arrow so that the animal fat can be offered as sacrifice.

  

I am looking to reconstruct the lifestyle of kshatriyas, their rituals, mantras they used and their day to day life.

Any references however oblique are welcome.

  

Thanks,

  

Niranjan
