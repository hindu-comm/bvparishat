Dear Shankara ji,

  

Thanks for this source.

  

Although prokshana and a brief do not blame clause is given, I was under the impression that the process would be more involved given the manner in which darbha and other Yajna saamagri are harvested in consonance with tithi, nakshatra and time.

This assumption is also backed by reasoning that the fat from slaughtered animals was offered in nitya-Yajna of some sort.

Can you throw some light from within this context?



Thanks,

  

Niranjan
