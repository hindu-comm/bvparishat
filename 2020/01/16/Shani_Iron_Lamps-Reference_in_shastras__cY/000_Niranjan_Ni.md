Dear Members,

  

Is there any anecdotal or theoretical reference from shastras regarding lighting iron lamps for afflictions of Shani (sade-sati or malefic aspects?).

There are a few sources that mention that sucha lamp is lit in the western/south-western corner of the house for appeasement of Shani.

I'd appreciate it if the scholars can give some reference from shastras for this.

I am also open to listening to anecdotal experiential evidence from members who have tried this successfully.

  

Thanks.

  

Niranjan
