Namaste,

  

This is a request / reminder to all, not addressed to a particular person.  

  

Subodhini English translation is a very recent publication (2005) and is copyrighted. Please take care not to request PDF copies of copyrighted books. It may affect the reputation of BVP. I am writing this because I noted several such requests for copyrighted books in the last few months.  

  

regards  
shankara
