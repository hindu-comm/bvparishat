There are many scholars in Karnataka, Tamilnadu and Andhra/Telengana who do this. I can name Sri Balaji Bhagavathar of Erode who is exalted in this field. His vast learning, excellent music skills and soul stirring rendering in Tamil captivates one. He is versed in Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Marathi and Hindi. He is capable of expounding compositions in these languages too. A sample is here:

Brahmasri Ramanacharana Nochur Venkataraman is another exponent of the saptaham style.
