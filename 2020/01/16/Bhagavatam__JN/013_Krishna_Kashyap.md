I have heard Sri Krishnapremi Bhagavataupanyasam. He also does saptaham often.

**He is probably one of the best speakers I have ever heard**. He performs live bhagavata saptaham. Only some of his studentswould know the schedule. he is probably in his 80s.

  

<https://srisrianna.com/epic-puranas/>. this site may have schedule of several activities.
