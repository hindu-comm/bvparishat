Respected all,  
  
I want to know the complete translation of Bhagavata tikas sreedhareeyam or subodhini in english or in hindi .  
I saw subashini rikas with hindi translation but that's only for the the 10 th skandham . I failed to locate it from the first skandha hence i need your help in finding PDFs.  
Even the english translation of subashini also i got only one volume in pdf out of 25 volumes. Hence i need your help in finding the other volumes in pdf mode. Its for personal study only. So please help me in this regard.  
  
In case of Shreedhariya tika o failed to locate any translation on electronic mode neither in english nor in hindi. If you know any book which is the translation of shreedhareeya tika of hindi or english please share the links here.  
  
Thank you
