Immediately after the verse you have cited, the author of the Pratāparudrīya cites the verse from Mammaṭa's Kāvyaprakāśa on Kāvyaprayojanas referring to the source of the verse by name:

  

ततः काव्यं दृष्टादृष्टफलजनकतया बहूपयुक्तम् ।  
तच्चोक्तं काव्यप्रकाशे  
  
"काव्यं यशसेऽर्थकृते व्यवहारविदे शिवेतरक्षतये ।  
सद्यः परनिर्वृतये कान्तासंमिततयोपदेशयुजे" ॥  
इति ।
