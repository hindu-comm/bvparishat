// We observed that the manner of religious instruction can be classified under a threefold modus operandi known as******Prabhu Samhita, Suhrit Samhita and Kantha Samhita.//**

  

Is there a verse that denotes the three samhita-s: kaantaa, prabhu and suhrt?

  

Has Kalidasa or any other authority stated all the three in a verse?

  

Any information on this is welcome.

  

Thanks
