I have heard the following -

Shruti / Veda = Prabhu Samhita. (because it delivers instructions like a Lord)

Smritis = Suhrit Samhita (it delivers instructions like a friend)

itihaasa / purana = kAntA samhita (because it delivers instructions in a palatable manner)

  

Sorry, I don't have any textual reference .
