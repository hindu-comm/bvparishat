Dear Shri Subrahmanian,

  

  You should consult the first Ullāsa of Mammaṭa's Kāvyaprakāśā for a discussion of these three types of literature. I don't know if the verse you have cited predates Mammaṭa. In explaining the purposes of poetry, Mammaṭa uses the expression कान्तासम्मिततया उपदेशयुजे, and in his own commentary on this verse, he distinguishes poetry from literature that is प्रभुसम्मित & सुहृत्सम्मित.
