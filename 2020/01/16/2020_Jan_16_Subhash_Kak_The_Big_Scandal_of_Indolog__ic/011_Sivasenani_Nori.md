Prof. Steiner

  

You have been subject to much antagonism, unfairly, on this list. Please know that many like me do not share that.

  

I admire the temperament with which you dealt with that.

  

We might not agree on methods, points of view, conclusions or opinions but that doesn't affect civility.

  

Regards

N Siva Senani
