Dear list members,  
  
I'd like to announce the appearance of the following publication:  
  
Walter Slaje: *Kleine Schriften zur kaschmirischen Kultur- und Geistesgeschichte* \[= Collected Papers on the Cultural and Intellectual History of Kashmir\]. Edited by Jürgen Hanneder, Andreas Pohlus, and Roland Steiner. Marburg: Indica et Tibetica 2019. Two volumes. xxxii, 883 p.  
  
“These two volumes assemble Walter Slaje's papers on the cultural and intellectual history of Kashmir up to the year 2019. The contributions deal with topics such as studies of manuscripts and material culture, syntax, literature as well as political and religious history and philosophy. Special emphasis is laid on Slaje's fundamental work on the *Mokṣopāya/Yogavāsiṣṭha* and the subsequent literature, as well as on his authoritative studies of local Kashmiri historiography, the *Rājataraṅgiṇīs*. Also included is a complete list of Slaje’s publications as well as various indexes (word index; texts; index locorum; index of names and subjects).”
