The difficulty is not that people should not do research.

The difficulty is marketing it as "authoritative".

I have personal difficulty when a book on a local culture is brought to print

before being reviewed by a person of the area. Such was the case in the

colonial times, since the attitude was to impose. The current situation

should be different in ethnic studies. Let it be shown that times have changed.

Kashmir has an abundant number of scholars some here in this list.

  

It is also true that most India is unknown to many people of India themselves.

But then the new students should look for teachers in the areas of interest

rather than looking for "something to read". I see this in all ethnic studies.

Scholarship demands that one looks to the source than any derived material.  

BVP as a group should champion original research not second or third hand work
