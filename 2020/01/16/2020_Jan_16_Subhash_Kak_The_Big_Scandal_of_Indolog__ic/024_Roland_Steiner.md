Short Addendum:  

  
\> a right and duty to respond against  
  

It has escaped my notice that someone here has been denied the right  
to "respond". The moderators of the list think it is necessary to  
"moderate" me like a naughty child, but so far all my messages have  
finally been spread through the list.  
  
  
\> what they consider the misrepresentation of \[...\]  
  
Whoever these "they" are, who are all apparently supposed to hold the  
same opinion: I, for my part, am speaking for myself only.  

  
  
\> represented people have at least an equal right and duty to respond  
  

I would like to reply to this with great earnestness (no irony)  
because a very important, thought-provoking aspect is touched upon  
here. The "represented people" lived and acted for the most part in  
medieval Kashmir: they cannot "respond", but only speak through the  
historical sources.  

  
  
\> ideal to verify the validity of description /representation of the  
\> culture to the satisfaction of insiders /tradition-bearers of the  
\> described /represented culture  
  

That would consequently be the end of source-based historiography.  
Imagine that the validity of the description of events in the history  
of Christianity depended on whether they satisfied "the Christians of  
today" (provided that they would have the same opinion worldwide,  
which of course is not the case). One does not have to be a citizen of  
present-day Athens to study the writings of Plato.  
  
  
Best,
