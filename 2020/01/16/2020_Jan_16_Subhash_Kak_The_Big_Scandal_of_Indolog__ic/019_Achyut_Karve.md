Dear Vidwans,

  

What modern scholarship lacks is getting into the boots of the author.
Unlike physical sciences which are objective and hence verifiable by experiments in the case of social sciences this is not possible. It is therefore necessary to understand the standpoint from which the author has written or compiled works. If this is not done it amounts to foisting one's own view on the writings. This happens especially in the case of translations where there is great difficulty in getting the right words in another language.

  

Patanjali at the end of the Mahabhashya says thus the intention of Panini in writing the Ashtadhyayi stands fulfilled. The Mahabhashya is a standing example of how one should resurrect the author through one's own writing.

  

Being a person who studied Marx's writing I would seldom ask Marxist whether they have finally understood Marx. The answer would generally be that Marx has become irrelavant today. If this is the case of a writing just 150 years old one can just imagine what when the writing is scores if not a couple of centuries old.

  

The test of a commentary should therefore be how best it has revealed the mind and thought process of the author rather than its contents.
This is more than necessay while writing history. More than what a man speaks or writes it is necessary to understand what makes him speak so if one desires to go into his shoes.

  

With regards,  

Achyut Karve.
