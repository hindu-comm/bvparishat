The usurpation of Indology by the West makes them suspect, almost by default.

  

Said in his *Orientalism* has laid bare the "academic" aspirations of the typical Western scholar.

  

That we can still speak of a few individual scholars, such as an Ingalls or a Madeleine Biardeau  

(or even half a dozen more), as sensible and understanding only goes to prove the rule.  

  

The overt superciliousness and inveterate contempt which Western scholars have evinced  

towards other cultures and civilisations consistently through centuries - all through history perhaps,

and have abetted and augmented the plunder and ruination of others have been noted by  

many scholars of balance and benignance such as Coomaraswamy and Danielou.

  

The crux of the paradox of reading and not reading a good deal of the massive Western verbiage

was set forth by me in a Sanskrit verse:

  

अज्ञोऽसि यदि नाध्येषि पाश्चात्त्य-विदुषां मतम् ।

भ्रान्तोऽसि यदि चाध्येषि पाश्चात्त्य-विदुषां मतम् ।।  

  

Who can after all easily annul and annihilate their own hard-earned epithets and sobriquets?
