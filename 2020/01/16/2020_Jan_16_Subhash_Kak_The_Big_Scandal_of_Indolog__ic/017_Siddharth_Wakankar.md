Dear Gopal,

  

You are absolutely right.

  

We may differ on certain points,but, should not summarily reject or doubt the efforts and scholarship of the persons or fellow researchers in the field.More open.minded or objective or catholic attitude is necessary in this case, because,the times as well as attitudes of the scholars seem to have changed now.

  

Thanks and regards.

  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
