Roland has shown the fundamental error that ails Indology.

There is a belief that Indian traditions are a relic as it

is in old Athens or old Rome. Unlike an European country,

there is no medieval in India, all is organic. People have

lived in the same village for thousands of years.

India is a living culture! Culture is not a photograph!
