Namaste,

  

\> Do we not need a kashmiri to write an authoritative history of the land?

  

By the end of 19th century, many of the braahmana families' "bread winners" have been the men who left their varna dharma, studied english and other 'british' subjects etc in special schools and with home tutors. Their children,like the generation spanning first world war and the two generations before them in some parts of the country, resorted to learn the meanings of upanishads from english translation by so called 'non-Indians' - Europeans. This suits also the early life experiences of a bengali teenager by name Narendra and his friends...  

  

I read my first gita vyaakhyana in Tamil, Kannada and English before forcing myself to attempt to study the mula in samskritam. In my middle school, my history and geography teacher introduced to us a work by Kaalidasa by bringing in an English translation (by a non-Indian, of course) of Shakuntala to the class. Of the 40 of us there, only a couple could read devanagari and only one could parse samskritam... So....

  

One may not agree with translations of shruits  or interpretation of dharma shaastra by non-Indian, but as a knowledge corpus, they have a place in the sanathana dharma vaangmaya . The same may be true for other subjects pertaining to the history and philosophy of the land.

  

There are some good points in asking for 'native sons of soil' to be the custodians for history etc.. But taken to extreme and blanket-muting voices of scholarship even if there is a genuine interest and search of knowledge, then it will only lead us to a place where there is only a few inches of distance from the mindset that led to burning of books alien to one's political philosophy as in other lands as recent as last century.

  

Why not keep an open mind and examine the quality and veracity of the work by this 'non-native' child of Kashmir? Where were all these people questioning the authority for writing, when the so-called "native children" of Kashmir, Pandits, were driven away from their homeland?
So,now only the "local people" should write history? Isn't it against the very scientific objectivity principles? Wont that automatically introduce an intellectual bias to the subject matter?  

  

Members were asked to post TOC of recent books on Indology and other related topics to introduce them to larger audience. I believe Dr. Steiner is just doing that. Dr. Wakankar's mail and Dr. Steiner's response are more appropriate discussion for clarity. If there is any personal dislike or mutual conflict or whatever, that should not be used to build a wall to knowledge and dissemination of information for others.  

  

If knowledge is open to everyone, if hindu dharma operates with the principle "vasudeva kudumbakam" or Yaadum oore yaavarum keLir (in Tamil, it means, " everywhere is our town and everyone is our kin"), if the sense of blind tribalism and crude nativity are to be abhorred when one has that jignaasa, then these kind of myopic criticisms need to be avoided on a public forum.  

  

my 2 cents.
