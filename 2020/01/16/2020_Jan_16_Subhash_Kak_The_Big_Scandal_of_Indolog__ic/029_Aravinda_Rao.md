Wonderful verse by Dr. Kannan showing the paradoxical nature of Indological studies by the West.

I have often wondered about the superciliousness you mentioned and about the claims of Western universalism. The present Western ideals, shaped by the 18th century enlightenment did not appear from the core of Western thought but they grew as a result of interaction with the Indian knowledge systems. Even then, it is limited in scope in the sense that their idea of Supreme Reality is a person called God sitting in heaven and an antagonist staying in hell, perpetually opposed to the God. Thus it is talking about a Supreme Reality which is confined by space and by being a person, favouring a particular people who believe in Him and who throws all of us into hell. In Vedanta, even the so called heaven or hell are fictitious.

The Indian idea of Supreme Reality is that it not a person but it is infinitely existing consciousness, which has a manifesting power - consciousness manifesting as matter or as a phenomenon. In such manifestation one is free to visualize a form and name for the limited purpose of meditation, as the Gita says (7-21, 9-23). Such idea is universal, as it is inclusive of all forms and names and offers freedom of worship. Liberalism and tolerance are in the basic texts of Hinduism.

Universalism is not something which can be imposed by the strength of propaganda but that which is voluntarily accepted by the wise all over the

world.

Anyway, such purva-paksha by the West is a welcome thing as it is activating our young scholars.
