Namaste Vasantkumar Bhatt ji



While I agree with Misra ji's observation on the 'calibration of 'authoritative studies' part, one need to articulate the norms to seek
this 'authenticity claims- validation'.

If we look back the records used for ' historicity -authenticity -cross checking' , several good documents are ' non- Sanskrit' . 



Pl. Check the writings of HIUEN'TSIANG. \[book I\]- <http://library.umac.mo/ebooks/b25788693.pdf> . Pl. check the entry for Hiuen'TSIANG at <https://www.britannica.com/biography/Xuanzang> , where he is described ' Moksha Deva' : 



Xuanzang, Wade-Giles romanization Hsüan-tsang, original name Chen Yi, honorary epithet San-tsang, also called Muchatipo, **Sanskrit Mokshadeva**, or Yuanzang, (born 602, Goushi, Luozhou, now Yanshi, Henan province, China—died 664, Chang’an, now Xi’an, China), Buddhist monk and Chinese pilgrim to India who translated the sacred scriptures of Buddhism from Sanskrit into Chinese and founded in China the Buddhist Consciousness Only school. His fame rests mainly on the volume and diversity of his translations of the Buddhist sutras and on the record of his travels in Central Asia and India, which, with its wealth of detailed and precise data, has been of inestimable value to historians and archaeologists.



The language of writing, though important is not rated high on this list of authenticating factors'. The early writers did not write for today's academic authorization !



Can you please reason out your ' otherwise- logic' for the expectation \< Otherwise how one can check their "authority \>



 - beyond love of language which i share with all members of the team here) ?And why 'Sanskrit alone as language of document establishes authenticity' ?
