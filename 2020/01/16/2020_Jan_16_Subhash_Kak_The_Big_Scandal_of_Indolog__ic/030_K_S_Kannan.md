Thank you Dr. Aravinda Rao for your kind words.

  

The way Sanskrit, Hinduism, and Indology are "owned" by the West,

\- in the sense of verging on proprietorship - as evidenced by  

the number of journals they bring out/conferences they conduct,

and with either nil, or nominal, or mostly their-own-chela-type Hindus  

participating in them - very well betrays what they are out to.

  

Such a pattern is not in evidence, after all, regarding Islam/Christianity/Judaism,

where it is essentially those who practice their religion, or the natural inheritors of the legacy  

that endeavour to take care of things by and large.  

  

The Pollockian and Donigerian hubris - of deeming Hindus (and equally, Jains/Budhists/Sikhs)

incapable of understanding or interpreting their own heritage,

and of making out a case for "unpacking" for them their own ancient/modern texts and traditions

in order, ostensibly, to unravel (nay, "exhume") the underlying yet unknown or uncomprehended agenda therein  

\- is what is despicable.

  

That a mere mastery over lexica and grammar (and add a grand dose of history if you wish), howsoever profound,

can hardly suffice to grasp the *spirit* of the original - was time and again emphasised by

Dr. Ananda Coomaraswamy. He rightly indicted the unending Western enterprise

\- of deeply studying, spending even an entire lifetime poring over,  

what they, the Westerners, indeed hold in nothing but utter contempt, after all.  

He asked pointedly, taking the cue from the very Vedic warning :

*yas tan na veda kim RcA karis"yati ! ?*

*  
*

What else was it if not an act of beneficence and munificence  

that they so kindly looted our manuscripts and artefacts?

Was it not an act of exemplary philanthropy  

that they sought to patent turmeric and neem, and our folk medicine?

Aren't they giving a proper shape to poor Yoga that lay amorphous and anonymous for millennia,

and even promptly making billions of dollars out of them (especially with numberless distortions)  

\- all for the unprecedented upliftment of humanity?  

  

And has Hindu history ever known of such bona fide benefactors?
