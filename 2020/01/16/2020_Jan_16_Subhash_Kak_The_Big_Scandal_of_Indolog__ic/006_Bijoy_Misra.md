Part of the west still operates as India operated three thousand years ago.

In the old India literature, India was the center of the universe.

So is the current west. The logic is to assume an artificial center.

While culturally India has diversified, the west still lives in box.

"authoritative", "knowledgeable" words are arbitrarily used without any

physical thinking. Back in old time, it was ignorance, lately it appears  

to be marketing. I wrote a note on truth-seekers vs job-seekers.
