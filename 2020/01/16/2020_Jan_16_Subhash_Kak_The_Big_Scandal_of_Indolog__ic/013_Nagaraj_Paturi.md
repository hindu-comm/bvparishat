Dear Sri B V K Shastry-ji,

  

Is it not unfair to discount the entire history writing work done by modern Indian scholars of different ideological hues by using expressions such as vacuum, just itihas, Mahabharata etc. ?

  

By home team, if you mean, Indic-minded, anti-colonial academics, that itself, .as is well known, even just within the area of history writing, enormous. 'Nationalist Historiographers' produced astounding amount of rigorous History Writing, parallel and counter to the Colonial Historiography.

  

We have come a long way after that.

  

Marxist /Socio-economic history writers from India produced , again, a huge amount of rigorous History writing.

  

There is a general tendency to consider Nationalist or Indic oriented History writing as outdated on account of this chronological sequence of Marxist historiography being later to Nationalist historiography. But that is not a valid, fair, healthy approach. For that matter historiographies later to Marxist, such as Subaltern historiography consider Marxist historiography as outdated.

  

But today, there is a great amount of anti-neocolonial history writing that is coming out from Indian historians. There is no vacuum now or earlier.
