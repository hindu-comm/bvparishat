In foreign lands we operate on "need to know" in cultural presentations.

People want to know and the "knowers" present whatever cursory information they find.

In 1987, I was appointed the principal lecturer on India in a Festival

of India exhibition at the local Museum of Science. I had no choice

than to accept. We had the responsibility of training four hundred exhibit  

guides for the Museum. I had to recruit two more teachers. I lived through  

my hand-waving and then watched the "students" doing their "teach in" with  

their own bias.

People are also writing on tantra, yoga and festivals with their

occasional encounters. People live in their own map.

I did realize my ignorance, many do not. Some grow beards and change dress to look "real"!

Like church pastors, some of our new gurus aggravate this pretension!

Knowledge has been politicized. I recommend all to read Principia of Newton to appreciate ignorance.
