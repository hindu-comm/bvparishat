An interesting discussion on deciding who is an authority and how authority is perceived.  
  
The difference between who is considered an authority in the native classical Indian tradition vs. those considered authorities in the modern Western academic tradition (regardless of whether they are Indian or non-Indian origin) is that in the native tradition, scholars were by defaultpolymaths (i.e. their expertise in multiple areas of classical studies was almost a given). Any scholar of repute knew and could interpret multiple fields of indic knowledge with relative ease.  
  
Among Modern Western academics (and Indian university educated scholars) this is almost never the case. A scholar of Yoga is a novice in Mimamsa, and a scholar of Mimamsa is a novice on Sankhya. Being a polymath is neither expected nor even apparently desired.  
  
Therefore, informed wide-ranging purvapaksha becomes impossible, and without purvapaksha, no modern siddhanta can be authoritative for futuregenerations of scholars.  
  
Without siddhanta, the same questions are reopened repeatedly and there is no forward movement in thought, only endless bickering and ideological bashing based on discussions that come out of echo chambers. This is whatis found in Indian academics too now-a-days.  
  
It is only among the traditional pandits that studying multiple subjects of Indic knowledge systems is in vogue, and it is them therefore that can make informed decisions on who can be considered authorities in what area. We have to protect the traditional forms of knowledge transmission - we won't miss the university educated peer-reviewed specialists of Indology 1000 years down the line from now.
