Dear Dr. Roland,

  

Hearty congrats for the announcement of this highly important publication.

  

I would suggest one thing.Unless and until the book is in English for
wider consumption, it will be difficult to say anything about its authoritative nature or otherwise.

  

Hope,you get my point.

  

Thanks for your kind consideration of this suggestion.

  

Kind regards,  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
