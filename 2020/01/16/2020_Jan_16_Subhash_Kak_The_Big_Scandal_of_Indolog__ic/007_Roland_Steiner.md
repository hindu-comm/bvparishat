\> Do we not need a kashmiri to write an authoritative history of the land?  
  

The decisive factor is not the nationality of the author, but the fact  
that all of Slaje's work is based on a thorough study of the relevant  
(Sanskrit) sources.  

  
  
\> I have difficulty with the calibration of "authoritative studies of  
\> local Kashmiri historiography"  
  

Since the text containing the criticised statement comes from myself,  
I am perhaps entitled to interpret the word "authoritative studies".  
In fact it is a translation of a German expression we used in the  
editor's preface of the book, namely "maßgebliche Studien" which I  
might have better translated as "relevant studies", although  
"authoritative" in the sense of "reliable" or "possessing recognized  
or evident authority : clearly accurate or knowledgeable"  
(Merriam-Webster) reflects what we mean by "maßgebliche Studien". It  
goes without saying that "authoritative" here does not imply that the  
essays - like any other research work - must not be criticized. But  
for this, you should at least read them first.  
  
It may take a while for my messages to get through to the list because  
I've apparently recently become a "moderated list member" again.
