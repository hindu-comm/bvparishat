Nagarajji,  

There is no blame. All works should be encouraged.

It is the criticism of the presentation style.

Unlike Sanskrit words, English words are frozen in their meaning.

Gradually i observe that the superlative words are used to draw market.

We have to distinguish between slogans and scholarship.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
