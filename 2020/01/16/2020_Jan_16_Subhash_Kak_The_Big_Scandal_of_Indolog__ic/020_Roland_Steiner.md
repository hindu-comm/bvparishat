\> The difficulty is marketing it as "authoritative".  
  

Once again, the incriminated statement from the editor's (not: the author's) preface reads in the English translation of my announcement:  
  
"Special emphasis is laid on \[...\] as well as on his authoritative studies of local Kashmiri historiography, the *Rājataraṅgiṇīs.*"  
  
What is simply meant by this is that no one who deals with local Kashmiri historiography (that means with the *Rājataraṅgiṇīs* by Kalhaṇa, Jonarāja, Pseudo-Jonarāja, Śrīvara, Śuka, and Dāmodara Paṇḍita) as a researcher should ignore these important studies. This is at least the opinion of the editors of these "Collected Papers", namely Jürgen Hanneder, Andreas Pohlus and myself. If we did not consider Slaje's works so important, we would not have reprinted them. Everyone is free to express a different opinion here, but this will not be very convincing if one has not even read the studies.

  
  
  
\> before being reviewed by a person of the area.  
  

This reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of historical research, but I will not go into that any further. Let me give you a fictitious example instead: A non-German (Japanese, Indian, Ethiopian, Argentinean, French, etc.) literary scholar who has studied a certain German poet and the literature and history of the poet's time intensively, knows the language of this poet and that of his contemporaries, has studied unpublished manuscripts, has searched in archives and is familiar with the relevant state of research, etc. etc., does not need to consult a living German to have his research approved.  
  
  
\> in ethnic studies  
  
The two volumes contain no ethnic studies.  
  
Best,
