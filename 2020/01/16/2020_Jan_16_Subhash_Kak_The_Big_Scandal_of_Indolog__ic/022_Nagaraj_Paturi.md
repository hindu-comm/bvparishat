1\. When Indians respond or take objection to the representation of India, Indian people, Indian culture, Sanskrit, Sanskrit literature, Shaastras, Tamil, Tamil literature or other Indian languages and literatures in them by western Indologists in general or German or any other sub-section of western Indologists in particular, Indologists like Dr Ronald Steiner respond in defense of the western Indologists in general or German or any other sub-section of western Indologists in particular as a right and duty. It is as much a right and duty of all Indians as that of western Indologists in general or German or any other sub-section of western Indologists in particular to respond in defense . If representing scholars have a right and duty to respond , represented people have at least an equal right and duty to respond. Indians have a right and duty to respond against what they consider the the misrepresentation of India, Indian people, Indian culture, Sanskrit, Sanskrit literature, Shaastras, Tamil, Tamil literature or other Indian languages and literatures at least just as western Indologists consider it as their right and duty to respond to what they consider to be the misrepresentation of their representation of India, Indian people, Indian culture, Sanskrit, Sanskrit literature, Shaastras, Tamil, Tamil literature or other Indian languages and literatures.  

  

2\. In Social / Cultural Anthropological studies, ethographer /ethnologist/ anthropologist follows it as an ideal to verify the validity of description /representation of the culture to the satisfaction of insiders /tradition-bearers of the described /represented culture. The disciplineof History which went on incorporating more and more Social /Cultural Anthropological inputs should ideally emulate this ideal of Social / Cultural Anthropology.
