Dear Darshat Shah,  
  
One would expect that the collection of articles by a scholar who has rendered great service to the study of the cultural and intellectual history of Kashmir for more than thirty years now will be welcomed, at least by those who know his work, if only because the collection of these reprints makes all his Kashmir-related articles easily accessible and provides them with various indexes. Those who do not or only partially know his work may or may not be curious about it. That is the purpose of a publication announcement. No more, no less.  
  
  
\> Say a Japanese (just for purpose of illustration) scholar wrote a book on certain aspect of Germany \*in\*  
\> \*Japanese\* which was signed off by 3 other \*Japanese\* researchers as “authoritative” on that aspect of Germany.

  
\> Would you agree to that description of the scholarship  
  

 1. It simply depends on whether I have arrived or will arrive at the same assessment, provided that I have the competence to assess the work. Most of the time I will not have the necessary competence, because German history etc. is not my area of expertise. 2. The nationality of the author, the editors and the reader are completely irrelevant here.

  
  
  
\> Note that I have not read the book  
  

As long as no one here comments or is able to comment on **specific points** of the essays collected in the two volumes, general considerations about "racial and colonial bias" etc. are fine, but do not matter. It would be much more promising to discuss the essays themselves. For this, however, one would first have to study them thoroughly. Since the original essays were written and published over a period of thirty years, there was already enough time to do so for those working in this field.  
  
As far as I am concerned, there is nothing more to be said.  
  
Roland Steiner
