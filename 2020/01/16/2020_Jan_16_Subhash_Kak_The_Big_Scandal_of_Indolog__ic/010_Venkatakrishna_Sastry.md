Namaste Bijoy ji, Steiner

  

  

1.Steiner: congratulations for the publication - shared. I presume the earlier works of Pro. Aklujkar are taken note of in this.

  

2\. Bijoy ji: Nature abhors vacuum! The law applies to academics also. If Indian home teams (a)lagged on history (= iti- vrutta) writing (b) were happy for three hundred plus years to blend itihaasa (- mahabharat-hari-vamsha-kathaa) with land history and get mesmerized
with it, (c) did not capture the essence of questions asked by colonial scholars like max muller and many others (d) consumed like creamy chocolate the colonial narrative on nativity, then there is no need to blame any one else.

  

Let us all as a team do the ground home work with academic honesty. Blame games take us no where. Action brings reaction let us find utility, as my friend Dr. yadu says , the viniyoga

For our studies .

  

Regards
