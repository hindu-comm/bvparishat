Dear Prof. Wakankar,  
  
Many thanks for your kind words and your suggestion. The papers  
collected in the two volumes are partly in German and partly in  
English. On the website which I quoted -  
<http://www.iet-verlag.de/ser_ext.html> - you will find a table of  
contents of the two volumes -  
<http://www.iet-verlag.de/toc/ext5_toc.pdf> -, which I have attached  
here for the sake of simplicity.  
  
With best regards,  
Roland Steiner
