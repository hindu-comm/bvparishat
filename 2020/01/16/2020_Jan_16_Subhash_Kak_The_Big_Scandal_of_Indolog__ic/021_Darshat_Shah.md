Dear Roland,

We can take your analogy further. Say a Japanese (just for purpose of illustration) scholar wrote a book on certain aspect of Germany *in* *Japanese* which was signed off by 3 other *Japanese* researchers as “authoritative” on that aspect of Germany. Would you agree to that description of the scholarship, or would it feel a little bit like a sales job to you? Note that I have not read the book, and I am not denigrating any aspect of it – it could very well be very good scholarship but it is inaccessible to me except for its English description as “authoritative”. If you feel this is a well rounded research you might better describe it as "deep" instead and actually entice others to go read it.



The point probably not being made very well is that interpretation of Indian history by western indologists, more of than not, has suffered from racial and colonial bias. Aryan invasion theory refuses to die as per Witzel and others who have twisted Rigveda to extract whatever meaning. Swastika and Aryan concept were grandly misused for other means. So non-Indian scholars need to do more to win the trust of their Indian counterparts given all this past history. India still lives and breathes that culture, and has protected it against invasions for thousands of years. It is not just academic. So IMHO, the opinions of people of that land do matter in any important work that concerns Indian history.
