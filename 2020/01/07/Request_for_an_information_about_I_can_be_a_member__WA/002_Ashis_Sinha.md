I am to inform you further that I have already got one book of Sahitya Darpana from internet published by Chaukhamba Vidya Vidya Bhavan in 1957. But unfortunately that book has not the front page. So I am unable to know who has edited the book which is necessary to use it for reference.

                                   
      With regards,

                                   
                                   
  Sebanti Sinha.
