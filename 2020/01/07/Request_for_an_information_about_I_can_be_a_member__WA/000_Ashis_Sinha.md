To,

Shankaraji.

  

Respected Sir,

I am greatlyindebted to you and other members of this Group for giving me precious information about the availability of some valuable books from time to time. I am Sebanti Sinha, now pursuing Ph.D in Sanskrit form Kolkata. I am now doing the Job of Assistant Professor in a College in Kolkata. For sometime past I have been writing to this Group from the e mail of my father who is also very interested in Sanskrit. My father while casually searching in INTERNET happened to include himself as a member of this Group. After that he forgot how to again be a member of this Group. So I could not include myself in this Group and so continued to write to you from my father's e mail. Kindly tell me the process about how I can be a member of this Group so that I can write directly.. My e mail id is - [sebanti...@gmail.com]().

         With regards and waiting for your reply,

                                   
            Ms. S. Sinha.
