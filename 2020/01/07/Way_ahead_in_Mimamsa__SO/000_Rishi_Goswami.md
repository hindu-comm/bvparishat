ShreeHaraye Namah

Namami

I'm currently on Prayogavidhi Mukhyakrama on Arthasangraha. What should I read after Arthasangraha? I'm planning to go for BhattaDipika.

But both of these works only concentrate on 1 mata. What about Prabhakara? What should I read to understand Gurumata?

Please guide me on my way ahead in Mimamsa Shastra.

Namami  
Rishi
