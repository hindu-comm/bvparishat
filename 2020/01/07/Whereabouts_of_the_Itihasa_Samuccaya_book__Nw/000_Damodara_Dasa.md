Hare Krishna.

  

Respected Vidvaj-janas,

  

I am looking for a hard copy or soft copy of the book "Itihasa Samuccaya."

  

Sanskrit with translation into Hindi, English, or Gujarati is best.

However, only sanskrit will also do.

  

I saw Hari Parshad Das did send one snap of a page of it in sanskrit with Gujarati translation at this post:

But I am not able to locate this book either online pdf or in any available online book stores.

  

Thankyou,

Hari Guru Vaisnava das,

damodara das
