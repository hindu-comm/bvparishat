That is certainly true, and most people are inclined to live in peace. However, a small percentage doesn't, and some from this small percentage might join terrorist organisations and attempt to settle in India under the guise of a refugee, to spread hatred and incite violence. The Indian government is facing a difficult problem: how not to disadvantage the peaceful majority in order to protect that same majority from the tiny aggressive minority. That's the problem, rather than global considerations about God and religion.
