The Moon of Bhakti can shine only when the Sun of Jnana has done its job. WIthout Chittashuddhi Bhakti takes the form of sentimentalism and pashu-bhava.

True Bhakti happens beyond the state of Turya and is unimaginable much less simple to talk about.

The Sun always has to be courted first and the moon will come in the fullness of time.
