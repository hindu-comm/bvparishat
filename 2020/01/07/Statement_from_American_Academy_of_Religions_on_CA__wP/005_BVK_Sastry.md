Namaste Paturi
ji



I am not suggesting anything to go on record as my view or pointer. I understand the deep sensitivities of the matter.



My submission to Bharateeya vidwans/ teams is to deliberate and make articulate advise over the right position ; Be bold to articulate what should be the ' Rashtra-Dharma' for ' Praja-Kshema'. A nation cannot/ should not afford an education process and output which does not deliver firm clarity on 'Rashtra' and ' Prajaa of Rashtra'. This is where silence of scholars seems to be giving space to cacophony on these critical matters. 



What was running in my mind, while writing the post and sharing the AAR announcement : was 'Maharshi Valmikis first thought , the inner sensitivity which responded even before the articulate expression ' maa nishaada pratishtaam came out)on the act of the hunter. The term ' adharma' comes out. The very same term which haunts Arjuna before getting the 'Swa-Dharma' clarification and guidance'. This 'sensitivity'
was forcibly killed in Dyuta-sabha by scions like Bhihsma, Drona invoking the defensive position to Draupadi's question, telling 'Dharma raja, the personification of Dharma' can only answer that question; and Dharmaraja never answered the question of Draupadi. Rest is ' itihasa'.



This clarity supersedes all other issues and value judgment propositions. The contextual guidance can be provided in an articulate way only by Sanatana Dharma scholars following srimad Bhagavad- Gita.
This will benefit all :the media, the state and students. It is tagging ' Vidyarthi -dharma' to 'Prajaa- Rashtra -Dharma'. 



In this backdrop of thought : 



A) On \< Do you want to suggest that Bharateeya Vidwans should consider sending similar petitions to US similarly poking their nose into the American affairs ?> 



I believe firmly that Bharateeya scholars have the right to invoke their 'Swadharma' to guide 'Rashtra' and voice their thinking. This is pretty well covered under the scope of ' Academic Freedom of Expression'; and an obligation to stand by 'Rashtra-Prajaa Dharma' . Knowing the Truth and not articulating in the right time is being a silent witness in 'adharma'. I am only triggering the debate. I do not take any side or suggest.



B) On \< Do you suggest that Bharateeya Vidwans should consider sending petitions to US asking them to control gun culture there of which many Indians have also been victims?>.



This is an action-option, to be proactive voice providers for what is wishfully said ' sarve bhavantu sukhinah' ...' Shantih Shantih
Shantih'.

If BVP desires to be proactive on similar lines as 'American Academy of Religions', and several other outfits which may exist elsewhere; and desires to do so as an 'academic body', which will justify their
reason for sensible existence and sensitivity to events in society ,
then the action may be an open option if the management decides so; and go by the law of the land. The opinion expression will of course be expected to be with all nuances and compulsions of the civility and cultured mode with which it should be done. No knee jerk reactions, emotional outbursts, verbiage which could haunt as ghosts for years at a later period. Surely nothing dies in today's internet search enabled digital domains.



Being nice does not mean being fuzzy, going evasive and elude the engagement. It is not for me to suggest anything about the action-options in front of BVP to act ; whether to act like AAR, ignore, do otherwise. It will be totally a matter for internal decision at BVP ( closed doors).



My wish is : BVP acts to make articulate advise on a matter which clarifies ' Rashtra-Dharma' for ' Vidyarth- Prajaa- Kshema' and make it reach the right corners to be heard.
