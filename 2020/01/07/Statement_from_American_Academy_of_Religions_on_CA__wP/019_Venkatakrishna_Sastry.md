Namaste Megha

  

Good points. **And question at the end i**s : how would the perceived identity by religion change to identity by Dharma? What should be done by whom? What is your takeon this?

  

Specifically \<.first A in AAR is significant (to me at least). >.

  

It is not just the first letter, but also the last letter ‘R’! For religion/s.

  

Bharath, is the nation bound by One Dharma with a cultural diversity of practices brought in through adaptation of Yogas. This ancient tree is presented in American thought as home land of four world major religions of south east Asia! -as. Hinduism ( with several sub-isms: saivism, vaishnavism, shaktism) , Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism ( and more - ism’s and - ology’s of phoren flavors and inspirations! This is against one book yielding just three major Abrahamic religions .

  

**Outcome**: the gestalt, the organic integrity, life and history of Bharath gets studied as a body on postmortem table:: respectable name is ‘ classical religions’ anchored to classical languages.

  

**Why is this so?** Tolerating the given non- native understanding and equivalence of Dharma = Religion . And this incorrect understanding is perpetrated for three centuries to ride over the psyche of Bhaarateeyas.
