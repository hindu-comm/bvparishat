If it is true that there are 50 countries that are Islamic,

and over 50 Christian,

then the mistake being committed by the present Govt. is  

sheltering even a single refugee from the above creeds to step into India.

Look first for the cause(r)s of religious persecution.  

  

Democracy is ultimately demography - a game of numbers.

The first clause of UCC should be something like

\- the percentage of minorities in India should not exceed  

its counterpart in Pakistan;

for the simple reason that more and more Pakistans are in the making already,

and the declared intention is to convert the entire country,

(and ultimately the entire world): plain and simple.  

  

The mahaa-blunder of Mahaatmaa Gandhi is  

not making Pakistan a purely Muslim state, and India a purely Hindu state,

thus solving the problem for ever.

This Man of Peace inspired bloodshed of millions on account of his myopia,

and worse, a perpetuation of the problem.  

The tragedy is that many people talk and behave  

as though Pakistan has been on earth ever since Creation.

  

Australia perhaps has a sound model of handling problems issuing from

the ardent followers of the the peaceful religion.

  

Power does not issue from the gun,

but from the wombs of polygamists

which are the tombs verily of other faiths.

  

Many misunderstand, or deliberately misinterpret, the pluralism of India.

It is a land of Dharmic faiths - Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism :

their singular common feature, among others, being  

the singular absence of aggressive conversion.

Zoroastrians have never been a problem as Parsis were no converters.  

  

Proselytizers are the bane of the world and the scourge of humanity.

And the irony of ironies is that it is they who pontificate on tolerance

\- and, horribly, to the followers of Dharmic faiths.

  

Where have not the megalomaniacs spelled doom and disaster?

Physical genocide *and cultural genocide* are the only contributions

they have made to human welfare;  

and continue to do

\- till they are effectively stopped, that is.
