1\) Was a Muslim-state Pakistan created in 1947? Yes.

2\) Has the population of non-Muslim minorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh shrunk since their creation? Yes.

3\) Has the population of religious minorities in post-1947 India grown? Yes.

4\) Is there evidence for persecution of religious minorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh? Yes.

5\) Did AAR take a principled position against the persecution of religious minorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh? If yes, please share evidence.

6\) Did AAR exist before 1990? Yes.

7\) Can anyone produce any (previously published) evidence of AAR having taken a principled position against Lautenberg Amendment (1990) and Specter Amendment (2004)? 

See: <https://medium.com/@parihar.parth/cutting-through-ca-caa-phonies-part-i-e8aaf06bd059> for one comparative perspective.

If answers to 5,7 are a clear yes, I am willing to see consistency in their claim to a moral/ethical position. If the answer to either one is a no, I can't see complete consistency in their position and a claim to some sort of a moral high ground in this regard. If AAR has stayed silent on similar happenings in America and has decided to take positions about happenings in other countries, then the first A in AAR is signficant (to me atleast).
