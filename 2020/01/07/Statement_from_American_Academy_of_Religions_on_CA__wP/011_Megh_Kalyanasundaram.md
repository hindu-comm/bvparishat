"The **fact** that the AAR is American...does not play a role...": Since it has been, in my view, correctly described as a 'fact,' should it hence not play atleast a commensurate role? To each, her/his own. With respect, I am less inclined to unsee a "fact".

  

Also, I am not (yet) aware of either a fact-check or a critique of this study attributed to a postdoctoral fellow at Carnegie-Mellon:*US interfered in elections of atleast 85 countries worldwide since 1945*<https://www.globalresearch.ca/us-interfered-in-elections-of-at-least-85-countries-worldwide-since-1945/5601481>.
