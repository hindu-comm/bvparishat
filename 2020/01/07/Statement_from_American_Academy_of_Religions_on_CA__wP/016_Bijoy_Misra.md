Dear Megh,

That the act was aculmination of what was a) present in the manifesto of a party elected democratically!

This is exactly the US President is doing here under similar pretext.
US culture is still forming and is being hijacked. by the President.  

India is richer and more tolerant. It should try to maintain her cultural status in the world!  

Leadership will pay off in time.  

Best regards,

BM
