That's giving too much importance to one person. This president became the president of the US because there was enough agreement with his tactics among the US population. Various fears, circumstances and habits came together within the US society, and this particular man became its face. Society makes famous people who embody large-scale behaviour patterns within that society. 'Elected democratically' is one of the ways to describe this process. Not just presidents, but scientists, writers, and celebrities of different kinds. To some extent I agree with Megh's quote: it's not possible to right every single problem all at once. It's possible to make gradual imperfect steps, and it's important to take these steps anyway. There will always be dissenting opinions. That's natural, and these dissenting opinions have their place in the overall balance, but they too can't be given too much importance because those who criticise aren't proposing better solutions - they are merely criticising.
