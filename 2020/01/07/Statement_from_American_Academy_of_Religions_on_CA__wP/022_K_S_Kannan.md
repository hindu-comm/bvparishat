I appreciate your analysis.

  

The inundation of information today - which mostly comprises disinformation and misinformation -

leaves us with too little time to pursue worthy ends. Energy expended in extracting useful truth  

from out of the mindless cacophony of the myriad voices blaring 24\*7, and in counteracting concoctions,

is really frustrating. The devastation that the debased mainstream media spells is indeed horrendous.

  

God give us the wisdom and the strength - to know and act aright.
