Dear Dr. Kannan,

  

You overestimate Australia's competence in matters related to the religion of peace.

  

Having lived there for 12 years I can guarantee that if they had even a fourth part of the cultural, historic complexity of India, they would be in a constant state of civil war inspite of having more than double the land area, the population of Mumbai and being geographically isolated.

  

When the summer heat crosses 40 deg Celsius, the trains there are constanttly delayed 30-40 minutes even in Melbourne.

Ever heard of that in India?

  

We constantly discount ourselves.

  

Which leads me to the next question.

  

Why bother what a bunch of outsiders have to say about what is essentially an Indian policy decision on accepting immigrants?

  

Should we also now have a response ready for youtube stars like Karl Rock the kiwi or that clueless Norwegian woman in Kerala or that German nincompoop from IIT Madras?

  

One of the downsides of connectivity is this illusion of omniscience and invincibility that creeps in with having a social media account and a keyboard.

These people and groups are living their 15 minues of fame, for they have little else in their lives in terms of meaning.

Don't discount the possibility of financial reward in all these shenanigans.

  

There is no point crying about the past--Gandhi and Nehru get to be 'Statesmen' and others suffer for this. Thats how the history of mediocre peoples play out. When good people keep quiet and take the "high road" scoundrels take over and dictate policy.

When systems are bad they lead to bad results.

  

Now that our karma-bhumi has been decided by the past, the best course forward is to make the best out of a bad situation.

I believe the current govt is on the right track correcting further damage to the demography that has already ruined Bengal and Assam sending them beyond the tipping point. If the worst happens, it will atleast teach people who love janani and janmabhumi to grow a spine and crawl out of the mire of ignorance and stand up to be counted. I am sure it must be deeply humanising for all those hoardes immersed in "big boss", "dingchak pooja",ballywood and cricket to actually have to fight for the right to live and breathe. 

  

Also you overestimate the power of numbers that some of these desert cults bring with polygamy and endless jihad. There was once a time when power was centered on the one who held the sword. That time is long past. Most invasions whether of the overt or covert kind fail because they do not wait until they have the numbers and power to decisively tilt the balance.

The D-Day or should I say J-Day perspective that many of the desert cults hold will preclude the possibility of patience and the reliance on time.

  

Tolstoy had it right when he said : "The two most powerful warriors are patience and time".

  

It is not possible for one who depends on "Jannat" and immediate gratification to play either game. That in itself will guarantee a less than optimum result for the mujahids.

  

What we need to concentrate on is the loss of dharma within our own kulas. I have frequently mused on why Shri Rama of all people is a favorite target for conversion brigades, feminists and all these modern pontificates of iron age morality.

Recently an IAS officer Christodas opined that the meaning of "secularism" is that he can hit Rama with a slipper.

With intelligence of that sort it is not hard to guess how he got into the IAS, but I digress.

  

Krishna by all accounts was responsible for many more "questionable" actions and yet it is Rama who bears the brunt of the "intellectual's" ridicule.

Rama the scion of Ikshvaaku represents the path of the Sun/Jnana.

Krishna represents the path of the moon --as a descendant of chandravamsha.

  

When people give up karmaanushtana and achara from wrong readings of select passages ignoring context this is what happens.

The path of rectitude is lost and clarity in thought and action are absent.

Thinking with the heart and loving with the mind are the roots of adharma. People freely indulge in this thinking they are doing what is right.

Duryodhana thought that he was justified as did Karna. And yet neither of them gave up karmaanushtana.

What hope do modern Indians have given their confused state of existence?

  

Like all things this will blow over too until the next "crisis". With the advent of reality TV people have forgotten what it feels like to have a normal life.

Life moves from crisis to crisis and people enjoy the surf.

Trouble is it leaves very little for the really important things.

  

Regards,

  

V
