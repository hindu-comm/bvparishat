That a fact appears irrelevant to one, few, some, many, most needn't make it appear so for all. It is my limited opinion, the position taken by AAR, vide their statement, can be seen from more than a single point-of-view. Surely, one can disagree and argue that ONLY their point-of-view holds and only facts they see as relevant are relevant: to each, her/his own.

  

Arguments indeed count, logically-sound ones particularly so (in my book atleast). If I recollect my basic critical thinking lessons correctly, the quality of an argument (and the conclusion thereof) depends on the truth-value ofthe premises involved.  

  

Over to anyone who wishes to have the last word.
