Religious tolerance is much superior in India than in the US.

It is deteriorating in the US. My thinking is that the current US is influencing

India to create divisions which is an old colonial strategy.

I would think any preference of any kind on the basis of religion

is divisive. A refugee has no religion.

Talking about religion, we did offer a service to Jagannatha in a cultural  

event on Odisha last Saturday in our town. Everyone in the audience  

did offer flowers. The god has no face!
