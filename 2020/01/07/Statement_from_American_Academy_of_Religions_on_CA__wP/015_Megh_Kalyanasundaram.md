***AAR Statement 1***:On December 11, 2019, the Indian Parliament approved the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which provides fast-track citizenship for Hindu, Jain, Sikh, Buddhist, Parsi, Christian, and other refugees fleeing persecution, but—significantly—excludes Muslim refugees.

***One of the problems***: That of omission: the usage of "...fleeing persecution..." instead of"...fleeing religious persecution..." (or"...fleeing persecution on grounds of religion...")

***Fact ignored*:**in p.4 of the [bill](http://164.100.47.4/BillsTexts/LSBillTexts/Asintroduced/370_2019_LS_Eng.pdf): "As a result, many persons belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities have faced **persecution on grounds of religion** in those countries"

***Why is the ignored fact important?*** If the persecution is religious, then the exclusion alluded too in the statement appears likea reasonable classification, atleast to some.

To cite Harish Salve: "As a matter of constitutional law, we do not HAVE TO redress ALL wrongs in order to redress some wrongs..." (\~7:39 onwards in <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgiFqMrCxPU>)

  

***AAR Statement 2**:* The Act—which has been condemned as contravening the principles of equality and secular citizenship enshrined in the Indian constitution—has resulted in major protests across India.

***Problems***: Those of omission and biases

***What are some of theomissions***: That the act was aculmination of what was a) present in the manifesto of a party elected democratically and b) brought to effect constitutionally. (partial)

***What are some of the biases*:**1) Usage of the word "across": protests were seen in some/few districts of India, surely a minuscule percentage of the total number of districts in India. 2) The statement mentions thar the act has been condemned. Some have condemned it, no doubt. However, there are some others who have not condemned it. (partial)

***Restatement***: The Act—a culmination of what was a) present in the manifesto of a party elected democratically and b) brought to effect constitutionally—has resulted in protests in parts of India and has also received endorsements in parts of India for furthering the cause of justice.

  

Not only can Statements 1 and 2 be further critiqued, most of the remaining statements too can be analysed for their omissions and biases (amongst other things).

  

I will stop here, for now.
