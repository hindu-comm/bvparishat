The statement by the American Academy of Religion (AAR) ist explicitly  
made out of "solidarity with Indian colleagues and students". The fact  
that the AAR is American and the colleagues and students mentioned are  
Indian does not play any role, nor does the indisputable fact that all  
over the world things deserving criticism take place. It is all about  
international solidarity among colleagues and students, regardless of  
their nationality. Irrespective of that, this statement of solidarity,  
like anything else, must, of course, also face up to any objective  
criticism based on arguments.
