Amazing! Thanks a lot Shankara Ji, you are ever so resourceful and helpful.

  

I am currently reading the Samskrita original from the recently published edition (2019, ISBN 9788193760321) by Shri Govindacharya Pratisthana, Delhi. It is a hardcover with excellent production quality and the price (Rs. 800) is worth it. There are a few misprints here and there but they are expected in the first edition of such a massive work. It is available here

The Hindi and English translations are for additional reference. I am planning to get the Hindi translation in four volumes by Acharya Shiva Prasada Dwivedi by Chaukhambha. It is also available on Exotic India here

Thanks, once again for the quick help.
