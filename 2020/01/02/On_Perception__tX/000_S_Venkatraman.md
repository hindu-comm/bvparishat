Pranams to every one.  

  

We recently had some excellent discussions on the subject of ‘Perception’ in connection with Shri Chittaranjan Naik’s book on the subject.

  

I recently came across a Ted Talk on Perception where it tries to evaluate if perception can be relied upon as an accurate representation of Reality. It concludes that it cannot be so taken and offers some alternative theories. Here is the link to the talk:

Thought that this talk will be of interest to the learned members of this group.

  

Regards,

Venkat
