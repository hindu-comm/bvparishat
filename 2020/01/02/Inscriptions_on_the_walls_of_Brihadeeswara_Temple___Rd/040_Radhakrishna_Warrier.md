Thanks Prof Deshpande ji for the details of the Modi script. Yes, some letters resemble Devanagari while some are very different. It struck me that the letter ‘ja’ is very much like the modern Gujarati ‘ja’ except for the top line.  

  

LS, we had a good collection of palm leaf granthas in the ancestral homes of my father and my mother. Well, these are all gone now, behind the curtain of time, so to speak. Some were written in Malayalam script and others in the Grantha script. Looks like both the Malayalam and grantha scripts were used for writing Sanskrit in those times. I remember having tried to read some of these granthas. Reading even the Malayalam script was rather difficult because of stylistic differences from how we write it now. I didn’t find any punctuation marks in the Malayalam or in the grantha scripts of these granthas.  

  

Interestingly, some of these palm leaf granthas were written well after the use of paper and pen had become widespread. I have seen granthas composed by my father’s grandfather Pandalam Krishna Warrier which were mostly on Ayurveda, but some were devotional compositions too. I think these were written during the late 1800’s, maybe from 1880 to 1900.
This was a period when printing also was well established. My father’s grandfather was a friend of Kandathil Varughese Mappila who started the “Malayāḷa Manōrama” and had published quite a few literary articles in that paper (which was then a weekly). I don’t understand why he still thought it necessary to write stuff on palm leaves. I have also seen jātakam (horoscopes) of old relatives on palm leaves which could not have been more than a hundred years old. And I have seen the nārāyam (stylus) which my maternal grandfather used for writing on palm leaves.
Perhaps in those times, they still had emotional attachment to the palm leaves even though paper, pen, and printing had become well established.

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
