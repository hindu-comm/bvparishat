Mr Venkat,

I cannot comment on the general cooperation from the Library.

However, when I had visited that Library, about 10 yrs ago, I did thru an introduction from one Sanskrit professor at Vivekanand College, Chennai.

  

The Librarian Mr Sudarshan helped me very much to show the Marathi and Modi literature in their possession. It is also organised fairly well. Regards.
