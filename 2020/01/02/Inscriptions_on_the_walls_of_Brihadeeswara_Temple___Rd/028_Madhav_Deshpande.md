I have been told that the use of Devanagari for Marathi predates the emergence of the Modi script. Old Marathi inscriptions are found in Devanagari. The origin of the Modi script is traditionally attributed to Hemadri Pandita who was a minister at the court of Yadavas in Devagiri. The oldest Marathi inscription is found on the statue of Bahubali at Shravanabelagola. This inscription is in Devanagari.
