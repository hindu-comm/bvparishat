Two Sanskrit epigraphs, ***one in Nagari*** and the other in Kannada, the former on the wall of  
the mandapa and the latter on the wall of the shrine of the Vrra-Narayana temple, are both dated  
in the Chalukya-Vikrama year 29 (AD 1104). They record endowments of lands and money by the  
Paramdra prince Kumdramahamandale$araJagaddeva, a feudatory of Tribhuvanamalla, to the god  
Jagaddeva-NarayaTa.
