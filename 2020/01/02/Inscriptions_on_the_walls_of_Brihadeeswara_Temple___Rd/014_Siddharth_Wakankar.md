My student,C.Sudarshan,is a Librarian there,still,I don't get any help from that Library.

  

The late Maharaja Thulajendraraje Bhosale helped me a lot in 1996 and accorded to me the status of His Guest.

  

Now,the things have drastically changed and don't have any hope to get any kind of academic help,despite ny hectic efforts through my contacts from variousagencies.
