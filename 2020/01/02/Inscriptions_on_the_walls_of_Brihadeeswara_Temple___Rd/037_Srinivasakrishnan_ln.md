Thanks, Prof Deshpande.  

  

Likewise, Grantha too started getting phased out around the beginning of the 20th century. A relative of mine (born 1896) read Sanskrit in
school using Grantha but had to learn Devanagari for Sanskrit during his Intermediate because textbooks were coming from Bombay, Calcutta etc and they were in Devanagari. I have in my possession dozen or so books printed in Grantha script - mostly Sanskrit commentaries - one of these was printed as late as the 1950s. They have no punctuation whatsoever (other than the danDa), being very nearly printed versions of manuscripts. Devanagari on the other hand had absorbed much of the English punctuation system, I suspect.
