"I am a scholar/researcher in the “Origin of MoDi script”, imparting training in Mumbai. I manage the organization by the name “Jagtik MoDi lipi Prasar Samiti”. There were many Yes & No; For & Against MoDi script at various Marathi language conventions since the year 1862. The famous being the Convention of 1920 at Pune chaired by the englishman William Kincaid. In 1932, it was finally accepted that MoDi and Devnagari, both would continue as official scripts of Marathi. Administrative documents until 1959 are found in MoDi scripts. It was the G.R. of 1950 by the Chief minister Balasaheb Gangadhar Kher, of the then Bombay state who sealed the fate of MoDi script by declaring it ‘Unnecessary, Dirty & Incomprehensible’. These were baseless arguments. Inspite of this, the schools continued to teach basic MoDi script from std.3 till std.7. The books that were used were “MoDi Lekhan va Vaachan” part 1–5, by Dhawale publication which is still available in select bookstores and online. Today there are multiple MoDi fonts that are being used on the computer including an Unicode font that can be used anywhere on the internet. The literature have started evolving in MoDi again, the first being Veer Savarkar’s famous book “Maajhi Janmthep” in MoDi script. There are many movements started in various cities of Maharashtra for the revival of this script and people have taken to snail-mail again, written communication in MoDi. Every year on 1st May, the Maharashtra state formation day, a state level competition in MoDi script is organized simultaneously in various cities in Maharashtra."
