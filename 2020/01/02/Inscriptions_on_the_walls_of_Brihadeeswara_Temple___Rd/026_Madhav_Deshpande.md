From what I understand of the history of Marathi writing, only legal, political, administrative documents were written in the Modi script.
The works of the Marathi saints like Dnyaneshwara, Tukaram, Ramdas etc. were always written using Devanagari. Here is a folio from a manuscript of Dnyaneshwari.

The Modi script was taught in schools along with Devanagari until 1950s, and then discontinued. Unfortunately, it was not taught when I went to school in Pune. I have some old family documents in Modi that I cannot read.
