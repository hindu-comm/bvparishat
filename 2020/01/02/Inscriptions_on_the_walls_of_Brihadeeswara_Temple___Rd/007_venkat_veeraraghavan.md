Sir,

  

If you are interested in the meaning and full contents of the engravings, check with the Saraswati Mahal Library in Tanjore.

I am sure one of their departments would have full transcripts.

  

Getting any sort of "cooperation" from them is another story altogether.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
