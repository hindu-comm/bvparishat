Evidently the demise of Modi relates to the rise of printing technology and decisions made by the British education officers like Major Candy in Maharashtra. The development of Marathi text books for schools under British supervision decided to use Nagari, rather than Modi. Though there are a few printed Modi books, the preference for Devanagari slowly eclipsed Modi in relatively recent times. The Marathi newspapers from their beginning in the 18th century used Devanagari. I have a few letters written by my grand-father in Modi, but my father's generation almost exclusively used Devanagari.

  

Here is some information on early use of Marathi in inscriptions:

  

"Marathi, a derivative of Maharashtri, is probably first attested in a 739 CE[copper-plate inscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_copper_plate_inscriptions "Indian copper plate inscriptions")found in[Satara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satara_district "Satara district"). Several inscriptions dated to the second half of the 11th century feature Marathi, which is usually appended to[Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit "Sanskrit")or[Kannada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada_language "Kannada language")in these inscriptions.^([\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathi_language#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian_Lee_Novetzke201653-27))The earliest Marathi-only inscriptions are the ones issued during the[Shilahara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilahara "Shilahara")rule, including a c. 1012 CE stone inscription from Akshi taluka of[Raigad district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raigad_district "Raigad district"), and a 1060 or 1086 CE copper-plate inscription from Dive that records a land grant (*[agrahara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrahara "Agrahara")*) to a Brahmin.^([\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathi_language#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian_Lee_Novetzke201653-54-28))A 2-line 1118 CE Marathi inscription at[Shravanabelagola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shravanabelagola "Shravanabelagola")records a grant by the[Hoysalas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoysala "Hoysala"). These inscriptions suggest that Marathi was a standard written language by the 12th century. However, there is no record of any literature produced in Marathi until the late 13th century.^([\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathi_language#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChristian_Lee_Novetzke201654-29)")
