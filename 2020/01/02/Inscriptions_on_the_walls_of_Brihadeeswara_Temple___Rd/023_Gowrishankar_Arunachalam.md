Pranams to all.

A friend of mine Sri Kudavayil Balasubramanian is knowledgeable in the architecture and development of Big Temple. He has done research on the temple constructed by Rajendra Cholan.

I had asked for his opinion. He has replied as follows:

“

  

the inscription sent by you belong to thanjavur big temple,which were inscribed by king raja raja chola. the letters are only tamil letters. one or two letters are grantha letters. this document speaks about the prasasti and the endowments created by rajarajan,All the chola inscriptions in the thanjavur big temple are inscribed only in tamil letters. the form was prevailing one thousand years ago. the letters of grantha are the invention of tamil people. they used these letters to write the sanskrit language in tamil. some of the inscriptions written by marathas are in nagari letters. they are the documents of maratha language.”

  

I have sought translation of the inscription.

I shall revert when he sends it.

  

Regards
