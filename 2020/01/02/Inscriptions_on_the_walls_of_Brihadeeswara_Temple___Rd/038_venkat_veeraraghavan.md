Dear Srini Ji

  

Grantha is very much alive in Vedapathashaalas atleast in Tamizhnadu.

As long as there are adhyapakas who trained in Grantha they are more likely to prescribe the same to their students who in turn continue the chain.

  

This way there is always someone who keeps the script alive.

  

Regards,

  

V
