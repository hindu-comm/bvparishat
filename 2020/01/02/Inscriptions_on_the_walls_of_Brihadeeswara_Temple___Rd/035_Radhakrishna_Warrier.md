Thank you Prof. Deshpande ji for this interesting information.  

  

The Wikipedia article says "*The name ‘Modi’ perhaps derives from the Marathi verb moḍaṇe (Marathi: मोडणे), which means “to bend or break”. Modi is believed to be derived from broken Devanagari characters, which lends support to that particular etymology*." Interesting to know that Modi script was considered a bent, or broken form of Devanagari.

  

The Wikipedia article also says that the cursive nature of Modi script allowed scribes to easily make multiple copies of documents "*The Modi script has several characteristics facilitate writing so that moving from one character to the next minimizes lifting the pen from the paper for dipping in ink. Some characters are “broken” versions of their Devanagari counterparts. Many characters are more “circular” in shape. Thus, Modi was a sort of “cursive” style of writing Marathi. The Modi script does not have long ‘ī’ (ई) and long ‘ū’ (ऊ) of Devanagari.\[4\] The cursive nature of the script also allowed scribes to easily make multiple copies of a document if required.*" That the script had only one "i" and one "u" shouldn't have been a problem for Marathi. It has been my observation that informal spoken Marathi, Gujarati and Bengali do not differentiate the hrasva and dirgha 'i', as also hrasva and dirgha 'u'.

  

On another note, it seems cursive English is not properly taught in schools in the US. Many young people here are unable to properly write in cursive. I remember that in my school days back in India, we had to write at least one page copy each day on a special 'four line' book for English and special 'two-line' book for Malayalam and Hindi.
