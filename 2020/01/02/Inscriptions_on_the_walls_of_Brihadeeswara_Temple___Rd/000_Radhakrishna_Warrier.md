Given below is part of a Facebook post by Ms Kaladevi Ramasamy, reproduced here with her kind permission. The script of the inscriptions looked very unfamiliar to me. It is not Tamil script. Not Kannada or Telugu scripts because I can read those scripts. Even though I can't read Granthaaksharam (the Grantha script that was once popular in Kerala and Tamil Nadu), I believe I can recognize it when I see it.
This doesn't look like the Grantha script. And it doesn't look at all like Brahmi. So, what script is it? And what language is it, Sanskrit, Tamil, or some other language?

Have you seen the ancient inscriptions on the Temple walls & wondered what it meant?

Brihadeeshwar Temple was built by Raja Raja Chola (985 -1014 CE), located in Tanjavoor, Tamil Nadu. It is the only Temple in India, with inscriptions around all the Temple walls describing the construction, the daily rituals to be performed for the Linga, the details of the offerings such as jewellery, flowers and textiles, the special worship to be performed, and so on.
