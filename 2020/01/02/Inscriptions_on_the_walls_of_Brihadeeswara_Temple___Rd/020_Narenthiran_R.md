Dear All,

On going discussion about administration skills of the TSSML, Tanjore is very unfortunate. I know them personally for the last two decades. All the staffs are very kind and helpful when you approach in person. Further who ever need any help please contact Dr. Perumal, who is contributing his conservation skill in part time. His contact number is 9442401129. Dr. Sudarson contact number is 9488649147.

Thanks  

**Dr. R. Narenthiran**
