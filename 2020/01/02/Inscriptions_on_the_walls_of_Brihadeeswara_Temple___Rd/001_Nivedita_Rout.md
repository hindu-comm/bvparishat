Namaste Radhakrishnanji,

  

The script of the inscription is Pallava Grantha. It was used to write the sanskrit lnguage. The language of the inscription is Sanskrit. I have no more touch with the scripts but what i read that seems to me Pallava grantha. If not I may be corrected.

  

Regards,

nibedita
