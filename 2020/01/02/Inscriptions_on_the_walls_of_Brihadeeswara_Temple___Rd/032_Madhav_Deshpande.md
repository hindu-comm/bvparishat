बाळबोध is just the local Marathi name for Devanagari. The two ways of writing 'r' in conjunct clusters in Marathi reflect several things.
Generally speaking, in all words that are Tatsama Sanskrit words in Marathi, the Repha on the top of the letter is used as in the words कार्य, सूर्य etc. The horizontal or the so-called "eye-lash" representation of "r" is found in pure Marathi words, generally plural forms. For example, सुरी "knife" has its plural सुऱ्या. The phonetic difference between the two "r" representations is that a short vowel before an r-conjunct in a Sanskrit word like कर्तव्य becomes Guru, like the rule in Sanskrit grammar. On the other hand, in a pure Marathi word like सुऱ्या, the short vowel does not become Guru. In some sense, ऱ्य is not a true cluster, but a palatalized form of "r." There are a number of similar palatalized consonants in Marathi that are written in Devanagari as clusters, but are phonetically not clusters, for instance क्य in the word मक्याला \[\< मका "corn\]. The difference can also be illustrated with an example like Sanskrit/Marathi सख्य, where the अ before ख्य becomes Guru. On the other hand, in the word सख्याला \[accusative/dative of सखा\], the short अ before ख्य does not become Guru.
