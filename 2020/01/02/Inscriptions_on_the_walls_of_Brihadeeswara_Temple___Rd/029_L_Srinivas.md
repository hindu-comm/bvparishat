It is truly fascinating! Perhaps there are Marathi inscriptions in Devanagari from the core Marathi speaking region prior to Hemadripant
also.  

  

One obvious question re the modern period is why did Devanagari supersede Modi in the 20th century or is it the 19th century? I've heard that Tilak's 'Kesari' was printed in Devanagari. I wonder what script was used by Agarkar, Kelkar, Chiplunkar and other Pune reformers for their Marathi pamphlets and newspapers?  

  

A related question - In Maharashtra, did they use Devanagari for Sanskrit even during the period when Modi was being used for Marathi?  

  

Thanks,
