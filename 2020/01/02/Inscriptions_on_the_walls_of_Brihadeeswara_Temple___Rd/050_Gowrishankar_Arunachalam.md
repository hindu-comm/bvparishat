Namaskaram.

Information on the inscription posted by Sri Warrier is as delow:

  

That particular inscription was published in South Indian Inscriptions Volume II Part I No. 6 (Publication of A.S.I.) Herewith that English translation is attached. The beginning few letters and same letters among the Tamil Portion are in grantha of Rajaraja period. That photo which you had sent is a small portion of the beginning of that lengthy inscription found in Thanjavur Big Temple Athistana.
