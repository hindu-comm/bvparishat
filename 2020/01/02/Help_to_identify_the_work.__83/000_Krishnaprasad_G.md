Dear all

  

In the book titled "Secondbook of Sanskrit" there are verses appear in couple of chapters, the author of the Second book of Sanskrit says that the verses are addressing to a King named Krishna. Could anyone identity the name of the work and author of the same.

  

Page 4

तद्विद्विषां जरति चेतसि भोगतृष्णा ।

तेषां वपूंषि विपिनेषु च जारयन्ति।।

सहते शस्त्रसंपातं सहति श्रममाहवे etc

  

  

Any help is highly appreciated

Thanks andRegards

KP
