Vidyāmādhavīyam, aka Muhūrtadarśanam is a famous book on astrology. This has been published with the commentary *muhūrtadīpikā* of Viṣṇu. In this commentary an author by name Bharadwāja is quoted often. (I know this name appears in Ayurveda texts and in the Vaimanika śāstra.). My question is: What astrology/astronomy texts are attributed to Bharadwāja? Can someone post links to the *jyotiṣa samhitā* of this Bharadwāja?

Thanks
