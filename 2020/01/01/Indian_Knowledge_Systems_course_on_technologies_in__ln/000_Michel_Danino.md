Respected scholars,



Please find attached the announcement for the 4^(th) edition of our course on **Indian Knowledge Systems**, a full-semester HSS elective that will run at IIT Gandhinagar from next week onward. This year’s theme is **The ancient “idea of India”.**



As this course is open to students / faculty / scholars outside IITGn, I will be very thankful if you kindly take a minute to forward the attached brochure to your contacts in Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar who may be interested.



With warm regards and best wishes for the New Year,



Michel
