Mindless means acting or done without justification and with no concern for the consequences All words are words - we use them to convey a good or bad intent. So if A calls B mindles, it can either mean they are calling the person mindless, or they may be saying it as a joke with no bad intent and in case of my usage the later is true To make it clear I have no bad intentions.
