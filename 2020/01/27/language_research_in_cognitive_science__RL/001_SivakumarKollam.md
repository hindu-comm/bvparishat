SAdara praNAm,

At the outset let me express my deep felt gratitude

for the slides forwarded.

Relation between language and cognition has been

an important aspect of our culture.

The study of this in the environment of "modern science'

is inevitable to bring forth understanding of many of

the Sastras related to Vedas.Another example is the

Science of Manthras as given in *PrapanchasAra* of

Adi Sankara.

As you have referredवाक्यपदीय of भर्तृहरि,

the most important work on the subject I came to know

and hailed for the uniquenessof it by many western scholars

please let me know about the available commentaries of

it in Hindi, and English that you might have came across.

  

Namaste.

  

  

*Sivakumar*
