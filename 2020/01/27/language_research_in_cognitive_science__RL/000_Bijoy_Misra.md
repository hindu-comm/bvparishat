Dear friends,

  

Good morning. I write about the cognitive science here with the thought

that some of you would create teams with you science-minded colleagues

to help understand many of the intuitive ideas and statements we notice

in India's language literature. Indian literature is different than the prevailing

English language literature in the thesis regarding the primary emphasis on  

sound than that on an understandable word. In order to understand a word,

one has to learn it, while interpreting a sound is one's own cognitive capacity.  

By virtue of origin of a sound, there is a built-in meaning in this theory.

Naturally this thought is built into the object producing the sound and not

conditioned by the hearing of it which has been the basis of the modern  

language theory.

  

We continue our seminar series next month. I sent the slides of the previous

seminar to the individuals who requested it. I suggest a good reading of the

book वाक्यपदीय of भर्तृहरि, particularly book III. In our thinking cognition becomes  

the basis of the origin of speech as a built-in attribute in a living being.

  

Please feel free to comment.  

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
