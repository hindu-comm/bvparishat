Dear Sri Kolam,

You should read वाक्यपदीय in the original. Many concepts have no translation.

English translation is not good, I don't know if Hindi translation exists.  

Our Ashok Aklujkarji in the list is an expert on the book.

He may suggest.

भर्तृहरि definitely draws material from previous sources that have to be

found to get a more linear analysis.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
