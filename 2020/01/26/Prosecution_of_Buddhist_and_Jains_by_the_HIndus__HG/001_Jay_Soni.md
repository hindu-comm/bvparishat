Please see, for example, Hampana Nagarajaih: "Attacks on Important Buddhist and Jaina Centres in Karnataka", inJ. Soni, M. Pahlke and C. Cüppers (eds):Buddhist and Jaina Studies. Proceedings of the Conference in Lumbini, February 2013. Lumbini: Lumbini Inter­national Research Institute,2014 pp.49-75.

Here is the abstract:

Ablur (Abbaluru), a hamlet in Haveri District (in Karnataka) is a place of historical importance. During the medieval period Ablur was part of the Nagarakhanda seventy, which was a subdivision of the Banavasi twelve-thousand province. The epigraphs and mini-sculptures in the Brahmmesśara degula, ‘a Śaiva temple’ at Ablur, were founded by a Gavunda, ‘village-headman’, named Bamma-gavunda (Brahma, Barma and Bam­ma are other variants). There are five Śaiva lithic records (numbered A to E by J. F. Fleet ), datable to the early decades of twelfth century, to the reign period of Vikramā­ditya VI (1075-1125 CE), the Kalyāna Cālukya emperor. The fifth inscription is of particular importance and provides useful information about the persecution of Jaina ascetics and votaries. Interestingly, corroborative sculptural details on the walls and ventilators are found in the same temple. A lithic record from Talikote (Karnataka) also mentions names of various places where Jainas and Buddhists were attacked and how Jain places of worship were destroyed. My paper deals in detail with these incidents of the medieval period.

Hope this helps.

With best wishes,

Jay Soni
