Vijayasarathi Sribhashyam, a well-known Sanskrit poet, won the Padma Shri in the Literature and Education category. Born in March 1936 at Chegurthi village of Karimnagar district to Gopamamba and Sriman Narsimha Charya, Vijayasarathi had his primary education in Urdu medium. Inheriting Sanskrit, Vijayasarathi took to composing poetry at the age of seven.

He composed Sarada Padakinkini at the age of 11, Sabari Paridevanam at 16, Manorama, a novel, at 17 and Praveena Bharatham at the age of 18. He made a mark as a poet at the early age of 22.. His conviction ‘to write only in Sanskrit’ made him experiment in modern thematic aspects in literary forms, according to his blog, which says he introduced ‘seesam’, a Telugu indigenous poetic form and that he was the first to introduce ‘epistolary form’ in Sanskrit literature.
