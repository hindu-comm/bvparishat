Sir, one clarification. Let this error not be ascribed to the Mahakavi. He is credited with using the maximum number of dhatus in a mahakavya. Most likely it is a typo by Sri Rayudu.

  

Yes, this \*mistake\* is observed usually in the coastal regions. Since it is a mistake, Grammarians do not deal with it.

  

Regarding the closeness in aksharas, in Telangana if there is a mistake, and in vikriti form, katha becomes kata (कत) not kadha or kada. So the nearness of the aksharas was not offered as the primary reason, but only as a reinforcement of the error.

  

Another instance is when carnatic musicians sing "endaro magAnubhavulu" for mahAnubhAvulu. Heard more from Tamilian singers and singers with Tamil influence.

  

Regards

Senani
