Mahāprāṇa pronunciation came to the the languages of Dravidian family from Indo Aryan – from Sanskrit, from the various Prakrits and from modern Indo Aryan. My observation is that the mahāprāṇa pronunciation is still not well assimilated in the south Indian languages even after more than two millennia of its introduction. While standard Tamil does not have any of the mahāprāṇa-s, standard Malayalam, Kannada and Telugu do have these. Yet the mahāprāṇa-s are mispronounced by many people whose mother tongues are these languages. Sometimes even the well-educated mispronounce mahāprāṇa-s. There was an education minister in Kerala who used to pronounce the name of his portfolio as “vidhyābyāsaṃ” instead of “vidyābhyāsam”. Because of mispronunciation, many Malayalis write “navōtthāṉaṃ” (renaissance) as “navōddhāṉam” and then pronounce the word as “navōddāṉaṃ”. And then there was this joke going around in the olden days of one Ramaswamy inviting his friend Sardar Inder Singh to lunch and at the lunch table requesting the sardar “āp gānā gāiye”. And the joke goes on that the sardar started his song in rāga gardabha. What Ramaswamy intended to say was “āp khānā khāiye”. 😊
