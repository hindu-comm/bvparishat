Lakshmi usually becomes Lekshmi in Malayalam.

  

I observedSri Paturiji's post on Thyagaraja 'B(h)iccha' for BhikShaa.
This transformation is in Tamil too 'Picchai' (Sundar Picchai of Google). There are such names in Tamil Nadu, even among Brahmins:
Picchammaal. \[They say that it is a bhikshaa from God that they got this child and so name thus.\]
