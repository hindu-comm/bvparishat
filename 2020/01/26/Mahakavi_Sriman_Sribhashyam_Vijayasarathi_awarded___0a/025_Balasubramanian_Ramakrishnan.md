There is no tha or dha (mahAprANa) in Tamil. In Tamil, if the letter 't' appears anywhere but the beginning of a word and not preceded by a pure consonant form of itself, it's pronounced as 'd' (always alpaprANa) - that's what I remember from my high school grammar.

  

So pattu -> pattu, but patavi -> padavi
