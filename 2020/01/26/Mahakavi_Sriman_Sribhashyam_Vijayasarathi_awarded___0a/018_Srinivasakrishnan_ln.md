Grammarians do cover widely prevalent usages especially when they are in ‘error’. For example, heuristics like ‘ vabhayorabhedaH’ etc

  

Besides in my 5 decades of association with Telugus, I’ve rarely ever heard anybody pronounce थ as थ. It is always ध although I’ve never seen it spelt incorrectly.

  

I think it may just be a typo perhaps of a transcriber.
