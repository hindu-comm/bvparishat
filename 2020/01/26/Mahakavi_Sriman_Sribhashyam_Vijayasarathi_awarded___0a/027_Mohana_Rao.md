1\. The pradhA at the end was as given in the book, not my typo.

2\. The tha-dha confusion has been there in Telugu for ages. prAsa for these letters is allowed even in poetry and also for da-dha. This type of exception is not there for other varga letters.

3\. The letter La is perhaps more used in kannaDa than in Telugu. Some of the La sound is absorbed by Da in Telugu, e.g. chOLa -> chODa. kaLa is an exception as another native word kala, meaning dream, already exists in dESi telugu. As an aside, the TV anchors nowadays pronounce La as la! They pronounce peLli (marriage) as pelli (sounding like pilli, a cat) and maLlI (again) as mallI (jasmine)!

4\. Shortening of the word-ending aa to a (as in mAlA -> mAla, lIlA -> lIla, etc.) is grammatically correct in telugu.

5\. I am looking forward to the sIsa padya of SrI vijayasArathi as sIsa is a jewel in dESi Chandassu of telugu. sIsa itself is derived from SIrshaka. The sIsa padya followed the methodology of SIrshaka, but not the same lakshaNas. kannaDa and telugu have unique dESi Chandassu, that is not present in any other language.
