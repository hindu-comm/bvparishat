I can’t understand where this Tamil bashing comes from.

  

The Sanskrit pandit’s verses were perhaps transcribed wrongly so somebody comes and ascribes Tamil influence. Then the errors are amended and the way forward pointed to Carnatic singers who neither know Sanskrit nor Telugu.

  

Is this a vidwat parishad or a brickbat parishad?
