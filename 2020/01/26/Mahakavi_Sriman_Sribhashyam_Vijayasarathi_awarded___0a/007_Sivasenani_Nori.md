Incorrect substitution of 'tha' by 'dha', say kadha for katha (the Sanskrit word has a hrasva ending in Telugu), prudhvi for pruthvi, etc. is so common amongst the non-Sishtas in Andhra region (less so in Telangana) that the term 'Andhra-ism' is justified; having said that, it may be clarified that this is incorrect in Telugu as well.

  

While the very little difference in the aksharas tha (థ) and dha (ధ) - only a 'dot in the navel' differentiates both - would no doubt have reinforced the error, I believe that the error is primarily an influence of Tamil where saraLAdeSa is done on the fly in so many instances that it carries over to inapplicable places as well.

PS: both nAdha and nAtha (say in viSvanAtha) are correct, the only place where either can be used, to my knowledge.
