And with a little touch of "Greek influence", so to say,  

there are singers of "*S'rI **megA**-gaNapatiM bhaje*" !

  

In Hindi, supposed to have a phonetic script, we write *mahak*

 and pronounce it as *mehak*.

The transformation is:

*mahA>mehA>megA.*

  

Tamilians speak of *medrAs*,  

though they write it as Madras.
