Grammarians do not cover such observations and conjectures.

  

We should first of all verify whether the poet really used धा and not था. Using धा for था is not in pan-Telugu region feature. It is found only in the coastalregion. Dr Sivasenani was conjecturing the Tamil influence, probably keeping in mind that the author is a Sri Vaishnava and Tamil influence on Sri Vaishnava influence is a usual feature. Otherwise, the author is a Telangana dialect speaker. Using धा for था is not a feature of that dialect.
