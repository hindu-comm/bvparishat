There is nothing to speak ill of any language in particular.

Deformations, "reformations" if you wish to call it, across languages

was being discussed, also in somewhat a lighter vein.

Nothing to take offence please.

I see no variation in tone wrt Telugu or Kannada or Malayalam either.

Every language has its own pattern of transformations while drawing words from Sanskrit.

And it is not from Sanskrit alone that words are borrowed.

*Faux ami* was discussed in the list earlier, too.
