Scriptwise, Kannada and Telugu have the same characteristics  

in the case of *tha* and *dha*.

But Kannada speakers do not tend commit this mistake.

Perhaps Kannada speakers cause the least especial aberration.

Of course, they make kA**Li**dAsa out of kA**li**dAsa,

like all southerners; *parima**La*** out of *parima**la***; etc.
