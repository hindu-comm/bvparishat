Dear Sri Yogananda,

  

This is very nice. Thanks for sharing. One suggestion would be to have a sUktAnukramaNikA, where you could access an entire sUktam. Can you confirm that the chanting derived from the Sri Shyama Sundara Sharma recording by Sri Ranga Technologies?

  

Thanks.

  

Ramakrishnan
