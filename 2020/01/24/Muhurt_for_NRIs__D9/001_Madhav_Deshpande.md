Dear Shri Joshi,

  

  I just picked up a calendar for 2020 at the Sankranti celebration of the Maharashtra Mandal of Bay Area in California, and it clearly lists times for Chandrodaya for Chaturthi etc. according to various cities in the USA. So, clearly, some devoted Hindus in USA are following the Hindu Panchanga adjusted to their own local time zones.

  With best wishes,
