Respected Scholars,

  

I have been hearing from my ancestors that the concept of Muhurt does not apply to residents of foreign countries. In fact, if some one crosses the sea and stays for longer periods abroad - he does not require Muhurt for any auspicious ceremony.  

  

I am looking for references to the above statement. I do understand that the above statement is debatable and different sects/societies may have their own opinions.  

  

With thanks,
