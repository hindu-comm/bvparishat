A few days ago I had written about Kuṭaja and Kuṭajādri in this forum.
Just happened to come across on the Facebook a short video on the Sarvajñapīṭhaṃ atop Kuṭajādri: <https://www.facebook.com/inmoksha/videos/2542368636019397/> .  The video is in Malayalam. The title of the video, written in Malayalam is "*KuṭajādriyilSarvajñapīṭhaṃ ennaTapōbhūmi*" - A place of penance (tapōbhūmi) calledSarvajñapīṭhaṃ atop Kuṭajādri.

  

Interestingly, another name for the Kuṭaja flower in the description of the video is "girimallika".

The original Sarvajñapīṭhaṃ that Ādi Śaṅkara ascended is of course in Kashmir, in the Pak occupied portion.
