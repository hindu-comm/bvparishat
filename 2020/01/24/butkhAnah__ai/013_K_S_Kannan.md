Prof. Roland Steiner,

My mail was not in reference to yours.

I do not know if you have called yourself secular anywhere.

I have not. By which, again, I am not implying you are not.

Perhaps you are reading more meaning into what I said.

  

There are many among the self-styled secularists who have  

argued on lines pointed out above. It is directed just against them.

The link given does make a reference to such people.
