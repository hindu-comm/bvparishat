Fareed Zakaria, who pretends to a liberal these days, wrote in the early - mid 90s in Newsweek that the Muslims, Jews and Christians should join forces and defeat dangerous cults (yes - he used that phrase) like Hinduism. Someone from the old newsgroup alt.hindu (if you know what this is, then you have just revealed how old you are :-)) sent him an email and he pointed that the Thuggees were a dangerous cult and were Hindu - so Hinduism is a cult. This is the kind of critical thinking you can find in Newsweek.

  

Also note that his father was a proponent of even stricter Sharia in India, and Rafiq Zakaria is supposed to be a secular Muslim.
