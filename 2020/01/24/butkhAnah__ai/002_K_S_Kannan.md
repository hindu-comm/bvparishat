Yes.

  

And what does the word Hindukush mean?

The land where Hindus were butchered!!

  

Only scoundrels keep such names.

  

There was another reprobate called Sikandar Butshikan.

Butshikan is iconoclast.

  

The great achievement of this rogue is forceful conversion of Hindus

and burning of libraries in Kashmir.

  

To quote Rajatarangini:

  

***sekandhara-dharAnAtho***

*** yavanaiH preritaH purA \|  
***

***pustakAni ca sarvANi***

*** tRNany agnir ivAdahat \|\|***
