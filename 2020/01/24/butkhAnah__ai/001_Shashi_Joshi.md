Buddhism was well practised in middle east by his time. He didn't have to come out anywhere.

The word but does come from buddha.

It is only as derogatory as the word idol, when used for murtis.

  

So, Indic people should object to the word idol (false god), and use icon, statue, murti etc instead.  
  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
