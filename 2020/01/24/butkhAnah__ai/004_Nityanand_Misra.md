Allama Iqbal refers to India as ‘this butkhānā’ = this idol-house, fit to be destroyed by a modern-day Abraham who in his poetry was non-other than Aurangzeb

  

He wrote in “Rumuz-e-Bekhudi”—

  

در میان کارزار کفر و دین

ترکش ما را خدنگ آخرین

  

darmiyān-e-kārzār-e-kufr-o-dīn

tarkash-e-mā rā khadaṅg-e-ākharīn

  

“In the war between ‘dīn’ (=Islam) and ‘kufr’ (=unbelief), he was the last arrow in our quiver”

  

شعلہ ی توحید را پروانہ بود

چون براہیم اندرین بتخانہ بود

  

sholā-e-tauhīd rā parvānā būd

chūn barāhīm andarīn butkhānā būd”

  

“He was a moth to the flame of ‘tawhīd’ (=Islamic monotheism). He was like Abraham in this ‘butkhānā’/idol-house (=India).”
