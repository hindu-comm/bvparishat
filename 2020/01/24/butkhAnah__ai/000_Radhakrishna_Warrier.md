The Urdu word بُت خانہ (butkhānah बुतख़ाना) is a derogatory term for the Hindu temple. It literally means the house (khānah) of idols (but). I have heard this term casually used in Bollywood movies and songs. 

  

I have read that the ‘but’ (idol) in butkhānah is derived from "Buddha". Looks like Islam, in its spread eastwards, encountered Buddhism before Hinduism. Central Asia and eastern parts of modern Persia were predominantly Buddhist when Islam was spreading east. The icons of Buddha were called “Buddh” which later became ‘but’. The term was then generalized for any mūrti (icon) and not of the Buddha alone. Is this etymology correct?
