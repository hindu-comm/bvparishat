\> And an apposite and authoritative answer to the secularists who so fondly invoke the name of "the Kashmirian  

\> Hindu king Harsha who was an iconoclast too", in order to exonerate and exculpate Muslims \[...\]  
  
If you do, you should quote me correctly:  
  
"Another iconoclast was King Harṣa of Kashmir (1058/59-1101), who carried out extensive temple plunderings and destroyed numerous statues of deities (Kalhaṇa's Rājataraṅgiṇī 7.1073 ff.)."

Apart from the inappropriate labeling as "secularist", I cannot see what or who could be "exonerated" and "excused" by such a statement.  
  
In a private e-mail to Prof. Kannan (dated 14.1.2020) I have approvingly quoted the following statement:  
  
"All these sites were once sacred to the Hindu community of Kashmir, who have fallen victim to a violent Islamic insurgency, which—600 years after the first systematic Hindu persecution over a period of almost thirty years from c. 1390 to 1417—specifically targeted the Hindu Kashmiri Pandit minority. Since the beginning of the ethnic cleansing campaigns in 1990, about 400,000 of them have either been murdered or expelled, while India and the world, with the notable exception of a United States Congress’ resolution of 2006, calmly continued to stand by and watch." (Walter Slaje: "Kashmir Minimundus. India’s Sacred Geography en miniature". In: Roland Steiner (ed.). Highland Philology. Results of a Text-Related Kashmir Panel at the 31st DOT, Halle 2012, p. 26).  
  
I leave it to others how to assess Prof. Kannan's above insinuation against this background.
