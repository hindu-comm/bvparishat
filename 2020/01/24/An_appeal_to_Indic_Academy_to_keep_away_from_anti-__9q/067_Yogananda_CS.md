Namaste Krishna ji

  

Your tone is assuming harsher shades. It is becoming difficult to read them dispassionately, and not feel for the likes of Srivathsa whose orginal intension has been completely lost.

  

At least for a few of us, we would be happy if the discussion is taken out of bvp and continued.

  

Regards. . . . . Yoga
