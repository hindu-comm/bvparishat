Thanks Irene for your views.

Having lived both in India and West for a very long time, my observation is:

  

as stated in your email:

If, on the other hand, activism is taken to mean what's happening in the West (obsessive and aggressive behaviour), then all the more reason for the Indic Academy to step in without delay  

  

why did this happen in the west in the first place?

Because, there were religious views which made it acceptable to reject, demean, physically abuse or shoot or even give capital punishments of different kinds to LGBTQ (based on the country)

This is not the case with India. It is morea social ostracization, or disowning them by parents or offering them almost no other way to survive other than begging. Hence some activism is natural and understandable in India.
