Indic Academy shall upload the video recordings of the proceedings of the conference. It will include the presentation by the Genetics Scientist Dat Anuradhapura Udumudi-ji who is the owner of Gene Tech laboratory in Hyderabad. She has a long experience if handling hundreds of cases where parents approach her for help in the complicated and complex sex and gender identity of their babies. I shall request her to respond on BVP directly too.

<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_differentiation_in_humans>  

  

A human[fetus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus)does not develop its external sexual organs until seven weeks after fertilization. The fetus appears to be sexually indifferent, looking neither like a male or a female. Over the next five weeks, the fetus begins producing hormones that cause its sex organs to grow into either male or female organs. This process is called sexual differentiation. The precursor of the internal female sex organs is called the[Müllerian system](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_system).
