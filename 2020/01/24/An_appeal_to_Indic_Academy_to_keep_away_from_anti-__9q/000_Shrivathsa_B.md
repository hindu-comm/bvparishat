हरिः ॐ,

  

 Respected members of this group who are part of "Indic Academy", I am in receipt of a brochure announcing a programme titled "Hindu traditions on sex, gender and sexuality".

  

 We see that you have given disproportionate space to LGBTQ activists. This is a tragedy at various levels.

1\. Are you naive to the fact that LGBTQ activism is anti everything we as sanaatanis hold dear?

2\. What is the purpose of firstly subsuming the "Advaita academy" under your banner and helping activists peddle their abhorrent ideology using the credibility of the subsumed organization? (Your announcement had the academy's handle tagged).

3\. Are you so craven that you will stoop to this level in your quest to portray yourself "liberal".

4\. Didn't it occur to any of you to protest the programme? Or at least its design in giving disproportionate importance to LGBTQ activists, one of them a self confessed beef eater!

5\. Are you not aware that this is a slippery slope and may lead to you losing trust and credibility as friends of sanaatana dharma which you have cultivated?

6\. Are you at all aware of the impact of such activism can have on the already abysmal urban Hindu TFR? Or you wish to ignore?

  

 In case you have indeed protested, I request you to protest more. In case not, I request you to force the academy to rethink the contours of the programme. This much can be our appeal as well wishers.

  

स्वस्ति,

   भवानीभारती जयतेतमाम्,

                 श्रीवत्सः ॥
