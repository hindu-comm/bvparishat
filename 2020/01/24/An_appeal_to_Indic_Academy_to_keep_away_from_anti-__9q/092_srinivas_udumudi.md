Dear Prof. Nagaraj,

  

The incidence of Differences in Sexual Development (DSD) cases is about 1.7% according toAnne Fausto-Sterling. Now Intersex and DSD are used interchangeably by some, while some eliminate CAH, Hypospadias and other such cases from Intersex. Note that the percentage of births with other SOGEISC conditions is higher as DSD is only covered by SC of SOGIESC. Thus Sexual Orientation, Trans and other Gender Identity cases are in addition to the 1.7%.

  

Knowledge of basic terminology among the members here is useful for them to be able to follow reports or discussions on this subject. For instance, many don't know that Gender is not the same as Sex and use the word interchangeably. The terms to understand are: Sex, Gender, Gender Identity, Gender Dysphoria, Trans, Transgender, Transsexual, Sexual Orientation, Intersex or DSD, Gender Expression, Gender Role, assigned sex, rearing sex, etc. Various conditions, sometimes called Gender Variants, are naturally occuring conditions due to various genetic, hormonal and other physiological causes during fetal development, during GenderIdentity formation in early childhood, until adolescence.

  

This forum is not the right place to discuss such basic questions on Biology or Genetics of Sexual Development. Those interested can do their own reading. for those interested in advanced studies -- Gender and Sexuality Studies is a major field in Humanities with thousands of books and tens of thousands of papers published every year.

  

  

regards,

  

Srinivas
