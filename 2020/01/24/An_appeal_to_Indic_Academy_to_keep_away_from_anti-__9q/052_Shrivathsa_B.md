Dr. Paturi,

  

 What you have done is to package shaastra in a language which can justify all kinds of degeneracy. I am extremely saddened that you don't see how your words can be used by the enemies of sanaatana dharma.

  

 There is no "feminism" or "non mainstream gender" in vaidika paramparaa. Your innovation is akin to some "we wuz kangs" who seek to see spacecrafts in vedas. At least the latter seek to do it for a good purpose. Viz. See a good thing (spacecraft) in Veda. You are trying to retrofit a degenerate hyper-sexual movement into Veda. This is an unmitigated tragedy.

  

Shrivathsa. B.
