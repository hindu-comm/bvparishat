Interesting.

  

If these questions—"Could biological sex itself be an illusion, constructed from human categories? Can we overcome or refashion these categories to suit twenty-first century needs? Or is this a futile attempt to deny the reality of two biological sexes?"\*\*—are of relevance/interest, then some views expressed recently in an attempt to engage with these questions, from differing points of view, can be found in this [video](https://iai.tv/video/the-rise-and-fall-of-sex-is-biological-sex-an-illusion?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=IAITVNewsletter13Jan&utm_source=Institute+of+Art+and+Ideas&utm_campaign=22c65fcb82-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_01-13&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_33593fe9fa-22c65fcb82-48116789).

  

"Head of ***Psychobiology*** at Tel Aviv University **Daphna Joel**, ***genetic and developmental psychiatrist*** at KCL **Stuart Ritchie**, and ***sociologist of science*** **Barry Barnes** rethink sex, gender and the differences between men and women"\*\*.

  

Best,
