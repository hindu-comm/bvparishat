Dear Shrivathsaji,

  

My comment was not aimed at you. I just said that democracy fail its people if not an individual in the act of administering justice.

  

There are instances of sexual anomalies even in the animal kingdom and I see no wrong in it. Do we not see donkeys engaging in homosexual behaviour on the roads? Let us not forget that we too are the products of nature.

  

More pressing is a the problem of child abuse by hetrosexuals. Sexual identity is the first project that a child undertakes when he grows to become an adult. It is here that the child who is otherwise endowed starts facing abuse. If the lgbt movement describes a process of self endowment and self identity it should be welcome. It is not proper to call this movement an ideological one.

  

In the circumstances I for one would encourage debates on this subject where members of the lgbt community also participate so that the hetrosexuals are capable of understanding their problems and addressing them. A debate without their participation would be a futile exercise.
The majority would then impose their decision without empathy.

  

In one of my previous maiIs on racism I said that Yoga is the only solution to tame ones emotions and feelings which form the basis of any ideology. It is therefore no wonder that Patanjali defined Yoga as 'चित्त वृत्ती निरोधः. It is only then that the problem could be addressed fruitfully.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
