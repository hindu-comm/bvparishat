Just read many messages in this thread. While I opine Indic academy's engagement with LGBT types to be an overall good idea, I feel Shreevatsa's objection about contagiousness of sexual deviance has been discounted by some out of hand.  
  
Excerpting from note from a person (whom both of the parties in the argument don't like):  
  
"However, if a society cultivates homoerotic behavior it can take root as illustrated by several medieval Islamic societies& earlier the Macedonians. This does not imply a change in innate orientation but because in such societies its practice is cultivated from an early age it takes the place of a certain form of sexual self-stimulation or release that males in some animals like Homo & probably certain whales typically need. If such practice is sustained over a period along with enforced bisexuality we might actually see the extended survival homosexuality, especially if there is some genetic predilection. That's how I see it in the Mogol tyrant Baboor, or Mahmud Ghaznavi, Khalji etc ... In contrast in societies like H where it received no encouragement unlike in their Mohammedan neighbors (post-occupation) it never rose in frequency -- an observation which did not miss the eyes of the English tyrants. ..."  
  
  
My own stance agrees with the below from the same source:  
"My general rule of the thumb is that any sexuality, typical or atypical, should not be criminalized as long as it does not result in harm to others in society or reduces the group fitness of a society. Further, its practitioners, just as with typical sexuality, should not engage in public displays of overt sexuality that might be deemed indecent or disruptive. Something which is atypical cannot be considered the norm either just as one eyed or 6-fingered individuals are not the norm. Policy should have mooring in the central tendency while acknowledging natural variation. It is not correct to celebrate all extreme deviations from the central tendency. Some can be useful but some extremely dangerous. Hence, individuals displaying those forms of atypical sexuality which result in harm to others should be contained just as with other neurological conditions."
