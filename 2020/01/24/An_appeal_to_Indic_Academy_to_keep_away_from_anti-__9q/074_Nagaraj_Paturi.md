Let me limit the present post to the question of whether the claim that I showed LGBT in the Vedas (the claim compares it the showing /finding aeroplanes / spacecrafts in the Vedas) is valid or not.

  

Plainly that claim is not valid. In none of the posts in the thread did I make such a claim (that LGBT is in Vedas).

  

Did I claim that LGBTQ is approved by Dharma Shastra.

  

No, I did not make that claim either.

  

Moreover, I said that code books say that such acts as homosexuality are punishable offence.

  

Then why is it being made out that I made a claim that I said that LGBTQ is in the Vedas?

  

What all I did is to say that in the past, spiritual leaders like Akka defended their right to spiritual practice on the basis of the gender neutral nature of the individual self of the practitioner . Akka argued on the basis of gender neutral nature of the ultimate entity being pursued too. I was saying that scope for such arguments comes from the Vedantic (Upanishadic) view of a gender neutral self , Self.

  

I was saying that caste based discrimination was also countered ( though I did not mention instances like Maneeshaapanchakam)) using the idea that self, Self has no caste.

  

I was saying that discrimination against LGBTQ also can be countered through such arguments.

  

So there is no such claim as 'LGBTQ *IS* *THERE* in the *Vedas.*
