Krishna, what you have written is utterly irrelevant. Nobody asked for "reimposition" of Manu. The limited question is about LGBTQ activism and how it militates against civilization and its capability to sustain itself and thrive. Only our enemies reduce all discussion about shaastra to be about some egregious "manuvaad". I am surprised you thought you could get away with such caricaturing. What i have submitted till now is obvious even for someone with at least half a brain. It will need some mind bending to deny such obvious things.

  

Shrivathsa. B.
