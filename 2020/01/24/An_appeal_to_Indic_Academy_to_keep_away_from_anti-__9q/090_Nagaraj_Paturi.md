Dear Sri Nagaraj-ji

  

Would appreciate if you can post this short message of mine on BVP under the thread -An appeal to "Indic Academy" to keep away from anti-civilization activists".

  

This is in response to the post by Sri Srinivas Udumudi.  

  

Sri Srinivas: For instance, a fetus could be XY at conception but still be born as a female.  

  

Kalyan: Sir, could you tell us what is the probability of the above scenario happening? If you do not have a number, you can say if it is very high, high, medium, low or very low.If it is very low, can we say that gender is mostly determined at conception?

  

Thanks

Kalyan
