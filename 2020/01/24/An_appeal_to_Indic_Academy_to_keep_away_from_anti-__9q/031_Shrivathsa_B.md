NP varya,

  

Too much unnecessary annoyance in your post.

1\. Mr. Krishna told me that his acceptance of the evil ideology is by way of "samohaM sarvabhUteShu". My question was whether he accepts TB patients in the same way.

2\. You claim that TB patients are different, it simply doesn't take away anything from "samoham". My point was that Mr. Kashyap Krishna was misusing bhagavaan Krishna's words.

3\. Contagiousness in TB and LGBTQ differs inasmuch as one is bodily and the other mentally. In fact the LGBTQ epidemic is being spread by way of propaganda by the LGBTQ activists.

4\. Why should I make the distinction between various flavours of LGBTQ when they have decided to show solidarity among themselves?

5\. You seem only concerned about rape. We are concerned about the poisoning of children's minds by the LGBTQ activists by seeking changes in curriculum to "sensitize" children?

6\. My fear of this anticivilizational memeplex is well founded because it has been able to guilt trip and befuddle the likes of you who are respectable scholars. And it has been successful in imposing multiple gender pronouns, gender neutral toilets and so on.

  

Shrivathsa. B.
