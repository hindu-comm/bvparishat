Just a few remarks coming from observing similar activism in the West.

  

1\. Activists do not come "to a table" to argue --- they already know "the truth"; they use public platforms just to promote their agenda, not to discuss any ideas but to dish out agitprop.  

2\. No matter how just and fair are goals on their banners, activists as a rule aim at special privileges and power to control other peoples lives. ("Animal Farm" is a good demonstration of this).  

3\. "Science" used to support activism is often paid for by the same interests that plan to profit form that activism. Financial interests behind any activism are as a rule quite big.  

4\. "Inclusiveness" as it is practiced by activists means "to exclude, malign and attack anyone who even slightly disagrees with any (even a rabid) adherent to the cause".

5\. Having no substance to convince, activists redefine terms and give words new meanings which is usually followed by rewriting the history.
  

6\. Arguing with activists is like trying to win in three-cups-and-and-ball game. They change the rules at will.

7\. na' saa'yakasya cikite janaaso lodha'.m nayanti pa'"su ma'nyamaanaa.h
