Namaste all,

  

Does merely expressing a genuine concern and having an opinion which does not conform to your own personal view make the OP a bigot? Is this the sort of empathy we are talking about? Condemning the homosexual behavior is a different thing and causing harm or injury to homosexual individuals is wholly another thing. One should be able to *strongly condemn* the homosexual behavior without the fear of persecution or being ostracized. Anything contrary to that is an authoritarian, Taliban-like intellectual terrorism.
