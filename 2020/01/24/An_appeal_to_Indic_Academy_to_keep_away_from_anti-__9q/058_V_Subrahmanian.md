Are there any Vidhi nishedhas in the shaastra for this LG.... community just as there are for 'straight' ones? I think this group cannot perform vaidika or smartha karmas. Rid of their sexual orientation they can strive for atma jnana on the lines of '..te api yaanti paraam gatim'.

  

As I understand, gay/lesbian do not have any outward signs that make them look 'odd'. Hence, a gay-oriented, a male per se, can, as per his varna/aashrama, engage in vedic karma. But transgenders, will be in the category of 'ineligible' to vedic karma, upanayana, adhyayana, etc. on par with the physically challenged ones, as per the shaastra.

  

Coming to relationship based on gender, the Vedic dharma accepts only man-woman marriage and no other. And this couple alone is permitted to perform vedic rites, the punya/papa allotment, etc.

Those who do not fall in these 'straight' cases, have, without doubt, the right to strive for Atma jnana, just like the others, who are also, by default, as hinted by Sri Nagaraj Paturi in one of his posts, required to transcend their sexual orientation, whichever it may be, including 'straight', and realize the supreme goal of Jnana-Moksha. As the Brahma sutras have concluded, the means to that end is non-Vedic for those who have no eligibility to upanayana and adhyayana.

  

I remember the case of a transgender who lived in Shankarapuram, Bangalore, in a rented room of a Brahmin house for over ten years. She (or 'he'? she had a masculine name) would walk to the Sringeri Mutt temples every day and have darshan at the shrines. Her friends were the flower vendor women and a few other men in the neighborhood. She was very quiet, saadhu, never ever aggressive, with always a smile on her face. Once she asked me for a contribution to visit 'their' temple in Tamilnadu for an annual 'jaatra'. She said, 'engalavunga koil' ( the temple for 'we people'). When I gave her the money, she said 'I shall surely pray for the welfare of you and your family.'   

  

The Bh.gita 'te api yaanti paraam gatim' will apply to all these categories; the 'api' umbrella will encompass all of them.
