I have read parts of the abhorrent book and have seen the mental gymnastics the author brings in to justify his thesis.

  

The problem is not with the book per se. The problem is one of civilized ones promoting degenerate ideologies. We have no problem with lgbtq people. The only problem is with they trying to impose their way of life on others just the way certain religious ideologies do.

  

The seeking to retrofit lgbtq arguments into our tradition is disingenuous. It needs mind bending arguments.

  

Shrivathsa.
