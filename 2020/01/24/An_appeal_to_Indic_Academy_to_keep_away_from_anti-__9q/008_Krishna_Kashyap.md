My heartfelt congratulations to Sri Nagaraj Paturijito have taken a leading role in this conference:

It takes maturity for people to understand the various aspects of LGBT. Hinduism is all encompassing and has to have a profound view of LGBT!. Sincere thanks to all our Rshis and to Gitacharya who states:

samo 'ham sarva-bhutesu

na me dvesyo 'sti na priyah

  

*If some people are so against LGBT, I sincerely pray to God to bless them with a child or a close relative or even a close friend who is LGBT, to induce some consideration and mercy in their stone hearts to fellow living beings!*  

  

Incidentally here are some links to study for those Hindu haters of LGBT to understand the truth pertaining to "Nature". LGBT is natural and one can do nothing about it. It is like being born with a different skin color and being discriminated based on color.

*NOTE verse 9 and its meaning:*

  

9. By the dominance of the father’s semen, the child becomes male; the mother’s – female. When equal, a eunuch. If, at the time of impregnation, the parents are agitated, the child will be blind, crippled, hunch-backed or stunted in growth. If the couple have vital-air-trouble, the semen enters in two parts resulting in twins.

  

  

*Best Regards,*
