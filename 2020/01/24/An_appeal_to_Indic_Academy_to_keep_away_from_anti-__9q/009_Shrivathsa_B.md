Mr. Krishna Kashyap,

  

 The LGBTQ movement is anti-civilization and I am not a dhimmie to give the argument of "samoham". If someone is so "samoham", let him please house a few TB patients in his home and sleep next to them. Actually LGBTQs are much worse. Someone can consider housing a few of them along with TB patients for a thoroughly unhealthy mix. By normalizing their condition, people like you may be denying them medical aid which may actually correct them.

  

Dr. Paturi,

  

 Our culture is so vast that you can get some reference to some fringe practising some abominable tradition. There may be even now some "Indic" cannibal tribes. But the question is whether we tolerated anti-civilizational degenerates such as LGBTQs who conduct "pride parades" and poison the minds of children with excessive sexuality. Or worse, like your academy, promote them to become mainstream.

  

That these sorts of people were strongly kept away from the mainstream is quite clear from dharmashaastras. Even the kaamasutra that you quoted has told clearly that degenerate sexuality although described is not prescribed (vaatsaayana gives the example of various types of flesh being described in Ayurveda granthas with the preference being clearly to those that are allowed by dharmashaastra).

  

It appears that anyone can wear the "Indic" cap and get the support of the Indic academy no matter what abominable ideology they may be following. I think the academy can do without such cravenness and mindless aping of the thoroughly degenerate parts of the west. Please forgive the uninvited advice.

  

My appeal to the other members of the Indic academy stands. Please take a stand against degeneracy. The LGBTQ movement is one of the sword arms of our civilizational enemies. Tolerance should never become promotion. We have nothing against LGBTQs if they keep their degeneracy to themselves.

  

Shrivathsa. B.
