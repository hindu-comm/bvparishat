Dear Sir,

  

Thank you for your response. Just as heterosexuals/cis-gender males & females can be nationalists and anti-nationlist any LGBTQI activist can be pro sanatani too. Being a LGBTQI activist doesn't take away their right or ability to be a sanatani.

  

Neither does Hinduism deny them place at the table by virtue of their identity. My esteemed colleagues at Indic Academy who have been Cced on the email will be able to throw more light on this.

  

Indic Academy's mission and principles have been on the website from day one and we have never changed or waivered in any way since it's inception. So to answer your point 3 Indic Academy is craving only to set the narrative right and give all scholars and researchers a voice, a tool to progress. We have consistently done it and believe that before the LGBTQI community goes beyond hope we can help them be sanatani while recognizing and respecting their sexual preference.

  

Coming to your point on TFR - I could introduce you to quite a few women who are suffering / suffered by way of marriage to men who couldn't reconcile to their sexual preference due to societal pressures. Obviously they have not been able to contribute to the Hindu TFR rate and families continue to suffer. Instead of losing out people given the changing nature of society it is essential that we talk about the issue.

  

Dialogue is necessary and Indic Academy is only facilitating the same.  
  
Regards

Yogini
