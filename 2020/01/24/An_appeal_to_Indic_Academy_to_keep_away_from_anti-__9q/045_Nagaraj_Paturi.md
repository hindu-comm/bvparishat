Contemporary LGBT activism in India started during the days of the petition WP(C) No. 7455/2001, Naz Foundation Vs Govt of NCT of Delhi and others in the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi. Naz Foundation itself was founded in 1994. I started my research on Transvestite Jogins/Jogavvas/Jogappas

in the May/June, 1992. I am mentioning this chronology to show that my interest in the Hindu religious transgenders had nothing to do with the contemporary LGBT movement in India. I focused on the topic well before the Naz Foundation was founded and much before it filed the petition and the LGBT activism in India picked up parallel to that.

  

During the proposal stages of my research , I had to clarify that the transgender Jogin issue is not an issue of sexuality or sexual orientation. Transgender Jogins must be distinguished from Hijras, Eunuchs, Gays, Lesbians etc. From the emic /insider's point of view, the biological/psychological transgenderism among the transgender Jogins has a religious/ sacral /supernatural cause/origin. An outside analysis (etic perspective) could be that a biological/psychological development
is being given a religious/ sacral /supernatural explanation by the tradition-bearers. Either way, the point is that these transgenders are not looked down upon. Moreover, they are respected. At least people are 'scared' to behave badly to them, out of their fear of curse from the goddess.
