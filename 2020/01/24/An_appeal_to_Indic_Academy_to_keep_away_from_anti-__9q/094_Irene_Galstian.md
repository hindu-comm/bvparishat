Dear Srinivas Udmudi,

  

Thank you for the detailed reply.

  

Of course I don't think that personal insults or insults of any kind are to be supported by anybody. I also don't think your professional integrity or the Indic Academy are in need of justification or protection. What is not worth doing, in my opinion anyway, is respond to such verbal attacks. Why not? Precisely because the Academy as an organisation and you as one of its senior figures are far above such behaviour. It's in the Academy's favour that it sought to understand LGBTQ people and to give them an opportunity to present their views within a framework that respects Indian traditions. That step helped stop a number LGBTQ people from becoming spiritually homeless, so to speak, and be tempted to turn to the demagogy of extreme views. I am glad the conference went well and wish the Academy all the success in its work.

  

As for Shrivathsa B and his views, these are rooted in a sort of panic: he either lives in a Western country or has spent enough time in one to see the aggression of certain LGBTQ groups. We can't pretend that his worry is completely unfounded, even if he did go too far in some of his expressions.

  

I hope this clarifies the matter.

  

Best wishes,

Irene
