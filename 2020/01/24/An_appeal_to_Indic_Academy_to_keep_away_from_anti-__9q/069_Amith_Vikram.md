Point taken. If homosexuality is natural, then should we consider it as a condition which needs to be treated? If so, can it be treated? Or, would it be wrong to take that approach because the same thing can be said about heterosexuality?

  

In Vedic tradition, even if we concede that omission is not necessarily negation, how to accommodate LGBT within the framework? Whilst that is certainly not my burden, I am just curious. Pitr Rina cannot be paid off, Deva Rina cannot be paid off - as it demands a heterosexual couple. For instance, in case of a Hindu lesbian couple, they won't be able to perform any Vedic rituals due to adhikara bedha.
