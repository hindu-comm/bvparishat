Srinivas,

  

 I stand by every word of what I said here and elsewhere. LGBTQ activism is meme cancer and I will oppose it everywhere. Not only those activists but also those like you who support them.

  

 If you think I was not well informed about the article, there was no need for you to edit it!

  

 You have expanded the discussion by including a tweet of me taking exception to Indic Academy hobnobbing with sholaabahaadurs (agniveers). They represent another meme cancer - "dalit" activism aspect of Breaking India forces. We can have a separate discussion on it in a different thread. I am more than willing to join issue if you wish.

  

Shrivathsa. B.
