Anand,

  

 If my "ignorance" is necessary for my children and grandchildren's childhood be preserved and not ruined by busybody activism which seeks to hypersexualize them, then I wear the perceived ignorance as a badge. And bad news for you, it will not go away.

  

 You are merely high on pop-propaganda and wilfully blind to the havoc these LGBTQs are causing elsewhere. But then, you have to be aware of your ignorance to rid yourself of it.

  

You talk about scientific studies while being ignorant of the fact that the LGBTQ problem became an epidemic when psychiatrists started treating it as a biological problem and not a psychiatric problem. Thereby making young children the unwitting victims of hormone therapy and sex reassignment.

  

LGBTQ as practiced today is a memeplex which is trying to make the renegade as the norm. Therefore people like you are mere useful peddlers of their propaganda. That you tried to make the issue some personal concern of mine is utterly laughable and reflects more about you than me.

  

Shrivathsa. B.
