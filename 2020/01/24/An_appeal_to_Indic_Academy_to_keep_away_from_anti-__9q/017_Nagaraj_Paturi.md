There is an interesting theoretical development in gender studies, in the wake of LGBTQ movement. The west born feminist movement, in its rabid phase was arguing that 'femininity' is nurture not nature. Calling it nature is 'politics of naturalization'. The same feminists joined hands with LGBTQ movement. If LGBTQ tendencies argued to be nurture, not nature, the argument of 'no choice' in the case of LGBTQ does not hold water.

Then they had to go for LGBTQ being nature not nurture. That automatically compels them to accept femininity too being nature not nurture.
