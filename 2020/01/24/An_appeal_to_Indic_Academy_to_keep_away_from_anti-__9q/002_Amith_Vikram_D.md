Namaste,  
  
Apologies if I am digressing from the topic.  
  
Are Shamans and Shramanas same? I ask this because Gautam Buddha was called Shakya/Shaka/Saka muni. The Shakas were the Scythians. And elsewhere, the Scythians were known to be Shamans. If so, it is probable that the homo erotic sculptures at Khajuraho was Shramanic and not Vedic?  
  
VikramAditya was known as ShakhAri as he drove away the Scythians from India. He is also said to be the contemporary of Adi Shankara. So Buddhist exile and Scythian exile coincides? There are accounts that Buddhist assassins, the visha kanyas, were employed by Buddhist Kings to overthrow the Vedic Kings. Prime eg is the assassination of raja raja chola, although it's hotly debated.  
  
Further, gopikas don't feature in the Mahabharata but only in vaishnavite texts like Bhagvatam. In the Mahabharata, Krishna is only represented as an alpha male (Shauri etc) but in contrast, the jainas represent him pejoratively (ranchod, etc). Vaishnavism (bhakti movement) was a rebellious sect similar to Shramanic sects. Many Jain and Buddhist temples were converted into Vaishnava temples, according to some scholars. So in many ways, Vaishnavism has much in common with Shramanism than Brahmanism.  
  
There is no doubt that transgenders always coexisted with self respect in Vedic society. But not sure if gender ambiguity or fluidity was ever a part of Vedic society.
