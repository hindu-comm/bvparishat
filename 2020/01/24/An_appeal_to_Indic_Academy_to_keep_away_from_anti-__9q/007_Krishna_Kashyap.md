Namaskar AmithJi,

  

I personally was amazed at the digression of the topic. Sri Nagaraj Paturi Ji had written a profound answer to a rather controversial "strong accusation" by Sri Srivatsa Ji !!

It was funny the way your question, although duly introduced with an apology, did effectively derail thethread to some lala land though relevant to you!😁

*Best Regards,*
