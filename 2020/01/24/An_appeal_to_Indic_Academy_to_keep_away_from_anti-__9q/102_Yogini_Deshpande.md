It is shocking to see a person of your calibre present only half the information to make an argument. The article has an Editor's note at the bottom about the changes being made in the article. Yes, the article needed to be edited since folks picking on the piece didn't seem to understand an abridged version of a 1hr talk.

" *(Editor's Note: Some part of this article has been edited, as it was leading to confusion. The text which assumed knowledge of advanced biology and genetics, is now replaced with something simpler to understand.)*"

  

The piece being discussed is an event report and not an actual opinion piece. The original content of the conferencehas been published / is being published under the sections of video and research papers. You can go through the original piecesand discuss or submit a rebuttal on the original content published by Indic Today.

  

The author is a young writer and student. She was there to learn, study and report. Indic Academy is committed to its mission to nurture and support youngsters. It is appallingto see mocking language from a learned person like yourself for a young person. More so given that you took the pains to read her bio but not read the Editor's note just above the Author's bio.
