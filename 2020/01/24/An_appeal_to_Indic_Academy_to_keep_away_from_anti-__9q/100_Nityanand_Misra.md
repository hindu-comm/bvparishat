That solves the mystery, though I think the polymath’s expertise has to include genetic studies to write so convincingly about gene sequencing and number of genes regulating sexual development. I hope her expertise also includesPāṇinian studies. I can then clarify with her my long-standing doubts about forms like*cicandrīyiṣati*, *candidrīyiṣati*, and *candrīyiyiṣati*.
