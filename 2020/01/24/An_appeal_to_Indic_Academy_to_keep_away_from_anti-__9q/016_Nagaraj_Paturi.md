Dear Shrivathsa-ji,

  

Your words

  

" let him please house a few TB patients in his home and sleep next to them. Actually LGBTQs are much worse. Someone can consider housing a few of them along with TB patients for a thoroughly unhealthy mix. By normalizing their condition, people like you may be denying them medical aid which may actually correct them "

  

betray a big need for getting educated on your part , with regard to things like TB, LGBT etc.

  

TB is a contagious disease. LGBT do not have any such contagious aspects.

  

Even in the case of TB, it is not civilized to express scorn /disgust/ fear towards a TB affected patient. A civilized person treats such a patient affectionately though keeping the person in a temporary isolation until the person is cured of the infection.

  

You seem to make no distinction among the various categories among what you call 'LGBTQ'. You seem to think that transgenders are also homosexuals. You seem to think that gays always die to have sex with males and lesbians with females. As such you seem to fear that if one lives, moves or stands beside any of the LGBTQ, one would surely get or has a great chance of getting forced into sex with the same sex. Since you compare LGBTQ to TB affected individuals, you seem to fear that they have a potential to change such a person who lives, moves or stands beside them into LGBTQ. This betrays ignorance. While Transgenders represented by T in LGBTQ are not homosexuals, Lesbians and Gays represented by L and G do not force the next person into sex with the same sex. They can not convert the next person into what they are. Homosexual raping tendency is just similar to heterosexual raping tendency. It is part of a criminal behavior called raping tendency. Behavior of homosexual abuse including paedophilic homosexual abuse is similar to tendency of heterosexual abuse including paedophilic heterosexual abuse. It is part of a criminal behavior called sexual abuse. Just like not all heterosexuals are rapists or abusers, not all homosexuals are rapists or abusers. Bisexuals represented by B have both tendencies in one. Their sex with homosexuals does not turn them into homosexuals. Hetrosexuals do not any way get affected by living, moving or standing beside any of the LGBTQ.

  

Hence your scorn /disgust /fear towards LGBTQ is misplaced, unfounded and irrational.
