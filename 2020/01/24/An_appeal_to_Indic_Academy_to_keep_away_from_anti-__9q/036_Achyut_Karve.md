Dear Vidwans,

  

'Denying place at the table"?

Indeed we are talking about the table. They cannot be brought on to our "table". Because they poison young children's minds with hyper-sexuality. All in the name of promoting "acceptance" and "sensitization".'

  

Does not the above paragraph sound exactly the same as the one forwarded by the opponents of Socrates. Yes. Socrates was convicted and poisoned. Such an incident has never happened in our history. And all this took place under the banner of democracy in its first experiment in the west.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
