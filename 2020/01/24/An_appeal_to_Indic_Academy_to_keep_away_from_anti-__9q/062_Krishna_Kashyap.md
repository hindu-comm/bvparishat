Yes Sri Subbamanian, srutva anyebhyo upasate. or some other statements support some path for LGBTQ.

  

However, they are not interested in general regarding vidhi nishedha etc. !!

  

They are asking for some human treatment, they dont want to be bludgeoned to death for being what they are. They dontwant hatred or disregard from people but want equal rights foreducation, equal rights and acceptance in job opportunities and seats in educational institutions and fundamentally they need to be treatedby their own parents in a human way and dontto be pushed out of theirown homes to fend for themselves as soon as they reach roughly teenage phase.

  

In general LGBTQ folks are asking for equal rights as much as heterosexual people have. They may even question religion, or God for that matter for being discriminated by scriptures.

They ask who gave the right the majority of people who are heterosexual to create laws that can protect them and punish others.
