Even if you disregard totally all scriptures of any kind, stating that they can be interpreted differently, there is room for research and understanding pertainingto LGBTQ.

Biologists and Scientists have found homosexuality among flies, rams, birds of different kinds. In fact about 7 percent of different types of animals exhibit such tendencies naturally. The point is Human beings have to learn to co-exist peacefully.

This is the only issue.
