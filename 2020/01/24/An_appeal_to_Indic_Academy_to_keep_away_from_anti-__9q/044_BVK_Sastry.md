Namaste



Please allow me to share my perspective on a some points that have come up in this thread in defense and offense of ' Tritiya -prakruti' / LGBTQ related debate and where it fits in to indic /Sanatana Dharma Shaastra frame work. There is a critical need for fresh study to contemporize the practices of Sanatana Dharma, for which one needs to raise above the shackles of ' history' and ' historic Himalayan blunders of studying bharateeya sampradayas in isolated segments using the lens of history, religion, theology. 





a) The proposed conference is good ......**If** the intention of the academic conference is really to ' broaden their perspective in their own***saving-sanatana-dharma activism*** ' leading to produce a plan to deliver a real social impact factor.



 Will the outcome of conference facilitate to evolve a document for such a statement of position on the understanding of
Indic /Sanatana Dharma teams, relevant for movement of ' LGBTQ movement interest -people? It depends on who will address holistically and organically to provide a focused tri-party analysis related to 'Dharma-Shastras' -World Religions- Constitutions of Nations (and the law of the land as administered through the courts). The root-data for analysis can find an anchor in the monumental work of Mahamahopadhyaya P V Kane, titled Volumes of History of Dharma Shastras , where one would also get the colonial legal case studies for history anchoring.



 A mere academic exchange of thoughts at best could generate a wish list of the participating teams, a blame game partying.



b) This effort would need a triple- hoop jump without fault lines:

The three hoops to address are : (i) LANGUAGE (BHASHAA): ' short-translations of source traditional texts in Samskrutham

(ii)
DISCOURSE (KATHAA) : Native Narrative and Historic documentation without wearing a 'Religion colored lens' 

(iii) CRITICAL VISION ( SATYA-DAHRMA-NYAYA- DARSHANA SHAASTRA) through the
interleafing areas of ' Constitutions of Nations and Religion- Resources

(For indics , this would be works of Dharma-Shastra, Purana, Ayurveda, Artha Shaastra narratives).



 I doubt very much on the availability of balanced resources for this purpose; and much less the voice- enforceability power to shape the values of the findings to communities.



c) A textual extract from the scholarly work like the one mentioned
certainly provides the references painstakingly collected. But the 'data' alone is not enough to get the essence of the dictums.

One illustration to substantiate this statement: A legal punishment does not get recorded in vacuum unless there is a social context.



 The extract below is from Kautilyas artha shastra placed below ( in red: Evidence for sexual disorientations ; Guidance to Kings for social law administration).



**Source : https://ia802703.us.archive.org/13/items/Arthasastra_English_Translation/Arthashastra_of_Chanakya\_-\_English.pdf : Page 336.**



A man who forces his connection with a harlot shall be fined 12 panas.

When many persons perform witch-craft towards a single woman, each of them shall be punished with a fine of 24 panas.

When a man has connection with a woman against the order of nature (a-yonau), he shall be punished with the first amercement.

A man having sexual intercourse with another man shall also pay the first amercement.

\* When a senseless man has sexual intercourse with beasts, he shall be fined 12 panas; when he commits the same act with idols (representatives) of goddesses (daivatapratimá), he shall be fined

twice as much.

\* When the king punishes an innocent man, he shall throw into water dedicating to god Varuna a fine equal to thirty times the unjust imposition; and this amount shall afterwards be distributed

among the Bráhmans. \* By this act, the king will be free from the sin of unjust imposition; for king Varuna is the ruler of sinners among men.

\[Thus ends Chapter XIII, “Punishment for violating justice” in Book IV, “The Removal of Thorns” of the Arthasástra of Kautilya. End of the ninetieth chapter from the beginning. With this ends the

fourth Book, “The removal of of thorns” of the Arthasástra of Kautilya.\]



Would this be worth invoking today or justifying a position on LGBTQ
as 'Sanatana Dharma justification' - A definite ' NO' ! Good to know the history, which cannot be negated, negotiated for rewriting.

Would the evidence give pride or prejudice ? It is a personal opinion.

Would history teach a lesson to current society - Yes;

Can historic practice be implemented now - ? Needs a context sensitive deliberation.



**What applies to one part/ specific community within India may not work for the rest, the beyond India teams, people with different faith**.



**REASON** : The LGBTQ movement triggered in movement against a religion, used the advantages of Science. In Sanatana Dharma, no such revolt movement was there.



**Why** ? The rule base of texts were drawn in the frame of 'Sanatana Dharma' as 'Sanatana Dharma practiced in a Varna-Ashrama society/ state bound by Dharma -Shaastra and Artha Shastra / Ayurveda and Kama Shastra of the specific period.



**What are potential dangers of pursuing this line in a ' popular mode' **? - The danger is playing to the trap of language and religion.

Pursue the link " <https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/bible-app-aims-support-lgbtq-christians-feel-excluded>
.



 This would be termed in traditional language as ' Every individual , instead of following 'Swa-Dharma/ doing Swa-Karma' will end up in crafting their own ' Swa- Dharma Shaastra and Swa-Karma-Shaastra', resulting in a plurality of conflicting works and leading to ' War to decide the Market value of Each ones Texts on ' Own Dharma'.



In the words as used in this link, for Indic traditions, this would trigger an effort comparable to the articulation : Now an activist and writer, Cheatham has set out to create a digital space for LGBTQ people to explore their own spiritual practice without having to surrender any part of their identity. She is leading the effort to create Our Bible, **an app set to release this fall that plans to offer at least 20 Bibles** and more than 300 devotional readings, meditation exercises, articles and podcasts **for LGBTQ Christians and others who feel marginalized by mainstream Christianity**. " 



Would this point to the remotely vision able threat of ' Fission of
Dharma -Shaastra break ups and Break-downs' ?? Would this serve the intent of academy ??



** What may be and should be/ can be done** : A swabhiman-swadesi narrative of Sanatana Dharma iti-vrutta / desha charita written anchored to the texts of dharmic traditions.

Assess how and how much the value system gels with the aspirations of ' We the People...' in the constitutions.

This dialogue of Sanatana- Dharma -Shastras and implementations of Rights and duties of citizens as provided in Nations Constitutions is the grey area that needs a dialogue. 



This is an area covered in the exploration of Yoga-Samskrutham University project , a work-in-progress, anchored to Srimad Bhagavad- Gita: recognized as a 'Dharma -Smruti Shastra for Sanatana Dharma audit. (Gita: 4- 7 to 9 )

For members Sri Srivathsa B and Sri MVS Siva Prasad of this august forum, I would recommend the book "***Tritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex. Understanding Homosexuality, Transgender Identity, and Intersex Conditions Through Hinduism***" by Amara Das Wilhelm. This book provides exhaustive referencesto Hindu texts which discuss or mention issues related to non-binary sexual characteristics, gender identity, and sexual orientation. The textual references are to texts in multiple categories: ayurveda texts like charaka samhita and sushruta samhita, various dharmasutra and smriti texts, arthashastra, various kamashastra texts and commentaries, passing mentions from veda-purana-itihasa texts, and several jyotisha texts. Even if one doesn't buy into arguments by the author of the book, the references which were painstakingly gathered are themselves very useful for gaining insight into how the *tritiya prakriti * was perceived by our ancients.
