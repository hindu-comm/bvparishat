I would like to second the suggestion recently made by Dr. Srinivas Udumudi under this thread.  
  
If India's “modern’ (or college-university trained) Sanskritists need to check if they are unduly influenced by the views expressed by Western Sanskritists, India’s ’traditional’ (trained at gurukula , etc.) Sanskritists need to check if their evaluation criteria (for ‘civilization’ or ’true civilization' , etc.) are still at least partly the criteria of Victorian England — if their minds are still colonized.  
  
(1. I am aware that the ’traditional : modern’ distinction is no longer as sharp or as widespread as it used to be in India. 2. I will not be writing more on this observation for want of time.)  
  
a.a.
