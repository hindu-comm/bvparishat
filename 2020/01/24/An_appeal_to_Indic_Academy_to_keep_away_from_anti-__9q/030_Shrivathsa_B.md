Sivasenani varya,

  

 If it were mere "engaging", it would still have been tolerable. Engaging LGBTQs is exactly like engaging the hyper left. They will not stop until their narrative is the norm. As I have pointedout elsewhere, they campaign and have been successful in imposing gender-free toilets, number of personal pronouns with which they have to be addressed (by law) and so on.

  

One is reminded of the story of the Arab and and the camel.

  

Shrivathsa. B.
