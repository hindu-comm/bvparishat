Dear Yogini Ji

  

Somehow I missed seeing the editor’s note yesterday. Perhaps I was expecting to see it at the top of the article with a date (as is usually the case) where I did not find it. Perhaps I missed seeing it at the bottom of the article. Perhaps the article was edited multiple times (some British spellings in the original have been changed to American spellings in the new version: recognise(d) → recognize(d), civilisation → civilization, practising → practicing) and editor’s note added in one of the multiple edits. I cannot be sure about the last possibility as the Google Cache of the page is from 13 Feb 15:55:31 GMT and Wayback Machine does not have the page archived. So I will take your word that the editor’s note was duly added with the edits. You may please ignore my “quiet edits” comment.

  

Having said that, I do find it rather strange that the while the article was edited and the sentence objected to completely removed, the objection made on this list was summarily dismissed as“he (Shrivathsa B) couldn’t understand given his poor knowledge of genetics and biology”. There was not a word on the forum that the original sentence had some issues and that it has been edited. Seems the objection was valid to the extent that the sentence was removed.

  

Also, I do find it hard to believe a law student added the new extract and expressed the same (I did not read her bio on the Indic Today site but read what Vishvas Vasuki posted on this thread). Perhaps the editors added it, perhaps a genetics expert added it. I did joke about her enthusiasm extending to Pāṇinian studies, but I also clarified subsequently that my comments were made in a lighter vein (perhaps you missed my clarification). So I am at a loss to understand what is so shocking or appalling?

  

Anyway, now that you have clarified that the article needed to be edited in response to folks (Shrivathsa B?) picking on the piece (on BVP?), I have nothing further to say.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
