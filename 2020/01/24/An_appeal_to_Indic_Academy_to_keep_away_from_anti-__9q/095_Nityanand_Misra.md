In between the fiery exchanges between Srinivas Udumudi and Shrivathsa B, let me point out one thing which I noted

  

The article in question, by a certain SL (who is this SL?), on Indic Today site was published on Feb 13.

  

On Feb 14, Shrivathsa B shared a screenshot of the article which had this sentence, which was highlighted (and mocked) by Shrivathsa B.

  

*“Humans start with a gender-neutral embryo and the sex-determination happens only after seven weeks due to a complex combination of genes.”*

  

Given that chromosomal sex is determined at the time of fertilization, the claim that humans start with gender-neutral embryos is obviously incorrect and unscientific.

  

Interestingly, when I read the [article](https://www.indictoday.com/events/conference-on-hindu-traditions-on-sex-gender-and-sexuality/) on the Indic Today site today, the above statement in italics is missing and is replaced by the below four statements which are very different. **The original statement has been removed entirely from the article!**

  

*“Modern genetics, acknowledges a spectrum of conditions with differences in sex development including intersex between the standard binary male and female sex. A large number of genes and their complex interactions with each other play a critical role in sex determination. Chromosomal presentation of XX or XY is only one aspect of biological sex, and we currently know close to hundred genes that can regulate sexual development, irrespective of the chromosomal component. Genetic work up at the level of gene sequencing goes a long way in management of cases presenting differences in sex development.”*

  

It seems an edits were made on the article on Indic Today website after Shrivathsa B pointed out the problematic sentence in question. What is strange is that Srinivasa Udumudi dismissing the objection of Shrivathsa B as “he couldn’t understand given his poor knowledge of genetics and biology” on this forum and Indic Today in fact taking a note of the objection and removing the statement objected to quietly from their website (I say quietly because the article does not state at all that any edit was made to the article).

  

Thanks, Nityananda Misra
