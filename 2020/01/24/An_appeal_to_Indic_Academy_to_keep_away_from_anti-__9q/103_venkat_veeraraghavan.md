Dear Dr. Yogini ji,

  

I will not presume to speak for my friend Nityananda here, but following is my understanding of the issue -->

1\. We are all one family here united in values if not dna and the NM clearly indicated some of his comments were intended for the sake of levity and not to be taken seriously.

2\. As members of one family we have a duty (one would say dharma) to make sure our family member's compass is pointing true North and not otherwise. This cannot be done without a bit of friction..again no illwill is intended other than pointing out discrepancies.

3\. It is impossible even within a family for every member to completely agree with the other's point of view. A similar leeway has to be given in this case too and accommodation of view points is required from both sides.

4\. Open speech and clarification is always to be prized above diplomacy since it clears the atmosphere very fast and paves the way forward.

  

Any misunderstanding is regretted and i speak as much for myself as for my friend that neither of us were trying to mock or belittle anyone.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
