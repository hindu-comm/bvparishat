This is the exact point I had in mind.

Unless there is a proper forum for the LGBTQ people who do not want to be say, leftists, then the subversion ideology of some activists will easily attract the younger generation.

  

In fact, by making silly but damaging statements like "It is a mental illness", "It is not part of Indian culture" etc., more people suffocate and usually drift to leftist ideologies. This is a shame given we have a very broad inclusive culture from its roots.

  

The number of straight spouses who unknowingly married someone with a different orientation is alarming. All of these straight people are also sufferring apart from the already suffering (and often double-life leading) non-hetero partner. Suicide rate and depression among LGBTQ teens is much higher than non-LGBTQ.

  

I see that some people just complain without making any efforts to create alternatives. Indic academy's effort is in the right direction even if not all views expounded in the conference may be acceptable to various groups of people.
