For members Sri Srivathsa B and Sri MVS Siva Prasad of this august forum, I would recommend the book "***Tritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex. Understanding Homosexuality, Transgender Identity, and Intersex Conditions Through Hinduism***" by Amara Das Wilhelm. This book provides exhaustive referencesto Hindu texts which discuss or mention issues related to non-binary sexual characteristics, gender identity, and sexual orientation. The textual references are to texts in multiple categories: ayurveda texts like charaka samhita and sushruta samhita, various dharmasutra and smriti texts, arthashastra, various kamashastra texts and commentaries, passing mentions from veda-purana-itihasa texts, and several jyotisha texts. Even if one doesn't buy into arguments by the author of the book, the references which were painstakingly gathered are themselves very useful for gaining insight into how the *tritiya prakriti* was perceived by our ancients.  

  

I would also suggest these members attend the conference being conducted by Indic Academy, listen to the knowledgeable speakers, and learn whatever they can. This is an academic conference and not a facilitation meeting for any kind of activism that the members are projecting through their creative imagination.

  

In my opinion, following these two suggestions would help the members broaden their perspective in their own***saving-sanatana-dharma activism***.

  

  
regards,
