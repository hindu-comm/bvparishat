Shrivathsa B,

  

The discussion on this thread developed a fair bit since the last time I visited.

It seems to me that you and I have one definition of activism, and Prof Paturi has another. If by activism we understand the request of LGBTQ people to be treated like human beings, then I agree that nobody should be ostracised, and to that end traditional examples of inclusivity from Indian traditions are helpful. If, on the other hand, activism is taken to mean what's happening in the West (obsessive and aggressive behaviour), then all the more reason for the Indic Academy to step in without delay. If they don't, then the hysteria of activism will be the only voice heard, and I don't think this is beneficial. Nor is it beneficial to oppose outright, since opposition exacerbates hostility and resolves nothing. Hence, even though you see the dangers of activism in the second sense and feel uneasy, the actions of the Indic Academy are both appropriate and timely, being the most reliable way the hypersexualisation narrative doesn't get off the ground in India.

  

Irene
