There seem to be three separate issues here.

  

First is whether the LGBTQ movement is anti-civilization. While I grew up with a bias that anything other than heterosexuality is not normal and am now viewing it as a fact without a judgemental value being attached to it, I would be curious to know why the movement is anti-civilization. As long as there is no parapIDanam, and undue influence on border-line people, it seems fine to me. If people capable of procreation are lured into non-reproductive sexual activities, then the injunction 'prajAtantuM mA vyavacchetsIH' would be violated.

  

Secondly, even if we grant for the sake of discussion that it is anti-Indic, should an organization promoting Indic values engage with a patently anti-Indic group, say like the Wahhabis, Deobandis, Pollockites, or Evangelical groups? To me the answer seems to be 'yes'.

  

Finally, sponsorship of such anti-Indic groups is a separate question - but then, like in the case of Mr. Rohan Murthy, I think it is upto the owner of the money to decide how he spends it. That said, it is perfectly valid to treat sponsorship as a signal of either how informed the donor is, or the intentions of the donor.

  

So, it would be fruitful to discuss the intended signalling value (assuming there was some sponsorship involved) and that depends on the answer to the first question - is LGBTQ movement by itself - as opposed to the views of its leaders or participants, unless those views and non-heterosexuality are intrinsically linked - anti-Indic? The position of Indic Academy seems to be that there is no clear-cut case for LGBTQ to be anti-Indic and that it is a fit case for sponsorship. So then it seems that only if it is established that LGBTQ is indisputably anti-Indic would there be a case for Indic Academy to reconsider the signalling value of its actions.

  

Look forward to this discussion - hopefully with Sastrapramana.
