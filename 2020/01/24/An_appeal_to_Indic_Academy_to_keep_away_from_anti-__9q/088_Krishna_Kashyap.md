The point here is:

  

there are two views : one based on scriptural evidence and the other based on understanding nature using science or pratyaksha pramana. Both are important to this group as I understand.

Having said that, it is not correct to mis-quote or mis-interpret scientific views brought forth by people like Srinivas Udumidi after years of research. Srinivas Udumudi'spoint is :

  

"Anyone who understands this will also understand that genetic science does support non-binary view of sex. This is what is being communicated"  

  

how you deal with this in society and how you apply dharma shastras etc. is a separate issue.

It is also true that "dharma shastras" have a standard escape clause: desha kala issues. That is they may change due to some desha kala and other circumstances.

For example the suggestion in dharma shastra is that a 24 year old man should marry a 8 year old girl. How many people today are ready for this?

what happens if this suggestion is not taking into consideration? what are the bad effects of not following every rule of Manu? What about punishments for homo sexual behavior? it is said "manur vai bheshajam" that what Manu says is the medicine for society.

  

Reality tells us that in general society does not accept every word of Manu.

Even the so called serious agnihotris who do agnihotra every day may have to thinktwice to let their 8 year old given away to a 24 year old man in marriage!!

  

A strong verdict or line cannot be drawn regarding how to treat the issue of homosexuality. Live and Let live may be the only practical way, given the fact that human knowledge is not 100% mature whether in science or in spirituality. I am sure that the research in genetics have not stopped. The truth as science sees may be more stable as they understand it today. In a way I am re stating what Megh Ji wrote:

If these questions—"Could biological sex itself be an illusion, constructed from human categories? Can we overcome or refashion these categories to suit twenty-first century needs? Or is this a futile attempt to deny the reality of two biological sexes?"\*\*—are of relevance/interest, then some views expressed recently in an attempt to engage with these questions, from differing points of view, can be found in this[video](https://iai.tv/video/the-rise-and-fall-of-sex-is-biological-sex-an-illusion?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=IAITVNewsletter13Jan&utm_source=Institute+of+Art+and+Ideas&utm_campaign=22c65fcb82-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_01-13&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_33593fe9fa-22c65fcb82-48116789).

  

By the way Sri Sri Ravishankar says in many videos on youtube that "sexuality is fluid not binary". I guess this is reference to scientific views on this subject.
