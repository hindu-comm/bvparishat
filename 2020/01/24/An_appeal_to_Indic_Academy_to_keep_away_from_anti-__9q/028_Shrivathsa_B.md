"Denying place at the table"?

Indeed we are talking about the table. They cannot be brought on to our "table". Because they poison young children's minds with hyper-sexuality. All in the name of promoting "acceptance" and "sensitization".

  

You as an editor of a magazine should have known how in certain states of Canada acceptance has become imposition i.e. it becoming mandatory to address people by their preferred pronouns. (There seem to be a number of pronouns and not merely two i.e. he and she).

  

And you want to promote that meme cancer in India! Shocking.

  

You will help them "be sanaatani" while they themselves are for hyper-sexualization of children. Tell me what you told me was a joke!

  

You have tried to answer my question about TFR but failed miserably. Answer simple questions - How does more LGBTQ promote greater TFR?

  

Your efforts to "engage" LGBTQs unilaterally is actually worse than what was done by Gandhi towards a certain ideology.

  

I hope better sense prevails upon you people. LGBTQs are doing to children by curriculum change what the pornography peddlers are doing by way of videos. And no, you cannot bring a harmless LGBTQ and tell me his intentions are good. LGBTQ as a movement is a meme cancer. Regardless of its harmless adherents.

  

Shrivathsa.
