Much of the study of[memes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme "Meme")focuses on groups of memes called**meme complexes**, or**memeplexes**. Like the[gene complexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_complex "Gene complex")found in biology, memeplexes are groups of memes that are often found present in the same individual. Applying the theory of[Universal Darwinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Darwinism "Universal Darwinism"), memeplexes exist because memes will copy themselves more successfully when they are "teamed up". Examples include sets of memes like singing and guitar playing, or the[Christmas tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_tree "Christmas tree")and[Christmas dinner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_dinner "Christmas dinner").

Unlike inherited gene complexes, memeplexes do not have to benefit the individuals expressing them in order to replicate^(\[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]). Rather, because memes and memeplexes replicate virally (i.e., by horizontal transmission), they can be beneficial, inconsequential, or pathogenic to their carriers -- memes and memeplexes do not have to be true or useful to replicate.
