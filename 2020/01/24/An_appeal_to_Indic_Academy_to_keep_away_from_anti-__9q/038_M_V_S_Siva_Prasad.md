Socrates in the present scenario is really unnecessary.

At first the misinterpretation of gita was committed and at now citing Socrates .

  

Really it's a bad decision to cite Socrates here.

  

Socrates never promoted this type of propaganda anywhere.

  

Even he said " An unexamined life is not worth living ".

  

How I have to examine the Indic academy ??

  

According to the academy's views or according to the system ??

  

You represent the system in front of crores of people and you won't take responsibility of traditionality..??

  

Just answer me if some one from another religion attacks that all the Vedic systems are brainless and all these are homo sexuals and even they promotes them through scriptures also. This proves that they are uncultured and uncivilised .

What will be the stand of your institution. Will you support the argument or move against it ?

  

Hope scholars may understand the situation.

  

In the name of these types of issues we are ruining our traditions and culture.

  

Absolutely to say directly whether knowingly or unknowingly Indic academy promoted the DIVIDE and RULE of the British here. As like the divided cats ( traditional and Indic academy )fighting each other on LGBTS the monkey ( other religion ) will get benifit through this discussion.

  

What happens if some persons from left front attends the seminar and gets the knowledge towards these negatives and promotes them as their weapons to destroy the religion in the unawared society..

Only Indic Academy become responsible for that..

It's not an imagination sir . The religion fight is ongoing everywhere knowingly or unknowingly throughout the world.

  

Even there exists videos where Islamist scholars cite example from mahabharata and says that Bheeshma himself told that Beaf eating gives strength .. and never cites what he said next...

  

Whats your answer when same scenario happens............ ???

  

Beaf is a religion issue and LGBTS are social issues .... This answer won't be fine also.

  

If degrading the traditional system is the purpose , so many religions are ready to degrade the Sanatana Dharma at any cost . And you want to promote the LGBTS by citing examples of Sanatana Dharma.....

It is unsuggestable sir.

  

Re think on it please.
