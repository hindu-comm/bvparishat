Oh the "egregious" person saw the video and is apalled at the half truths presented therein.

  

I don't think your views need to be taken seriously because you pretend to have not heard of the term "conflict of interest". Simply put, your views reek of conflict of interest. The whole sex-identity epidemic started exactly because of your kind of approach - treating a psychiatric condition as a medical one.

  

7th week? Why not go a bit farther and say that human and pig embryos look exactly the same in the x-th week. Therefore the feeling that a few people have that they are pigs is tenable genetically. I am sure you can innovate a "pig-oil" gene therapy to make a human a pig.

  

Moreover if there was nothing wrong in the statement you should have been the first to protest the editing of the article!

  

"Anyone who understands this will also understand that genetic science does support non-binary view of sex."

That is what some wish it to be and that is what we seek to set right.

  

Are you showing us a case of dysphoria reported to your company which is a medical condition as an argument to support LGBQs whose problem lies somewhere else? It simply shows how dishonest you could be. You are using innocent dysphoric and eunuchs to promote your destructive narrative.

  

Honestly, you could have kept silent and not exposed yourself.

  

Shrivathsa.
