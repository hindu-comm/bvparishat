Notwithstanding anything said so far in the thread, it should also be noted that there is a balance required between

  

1\. nature and nurtureviews of the non-binary gender aspects.

  

and

  

2\. agreeing with the valid points of the gender diversity campaigners and spreading the discussion as a fad beyond requirement

  

Though the argument that the non-binary gender features can be natural in many humans , it can not be ruled out that there is a possible acquisition of some of these tendencies through 'influence', acculturation, 'learning' , imitation etc. Spreading the discussion as a fad, beyond requirement is one of the importantsources of 'influence', acculturation, 'learning' , imitation etc. Calling all non-binary gender features as just a memeplex is one extreme and ruling out the possibility of some of these tendencies developing through 'influence', acculturation, 'learning' , imitation etc. is another extreme.

  

Reducing the discussion of gender diversity to that of just sexual orientations is one of the reasons for the impressions andallegations of hypersexualization against the gender diversity activism. The fault lies with the activists who are reductionist and do not highlight aspects other than sexual orientations.

  

Sexual disorientation is also a very important aspect of gender diversity that involves social issues including those of inclusion and exclusion.

  

Sexual disorientation can be voluntary and involuntary.

  

Aren't involuntarily sexually disoriented people looked down upon ?

  

It is interesting to see that voluntary sexual disorientation is respected as an achievement of sensory control in many cultures. Particularly Indic cultural traditions have a great potential to contribute in this regard.

  

All such aspects do not draw attention because of overemphasis of sexual orientations in a gender diversity discussion.
