Respected siva senani sir ,

  

You asked for the sastra pramana.

I feel a new thread may help to understand whether same sex relationship is fair or unfair.

  

It's absolutely known that same sex relationship is unfair in society.

  

As far as I know there exists a पुरुष मैथुन प्रायश्चित्तम् in the dharma sastras and vice versa which proves same sex relationship is a पाप कार्यम् under the dharma sastra.

  

So having a new thread which discusses the view of dharma sastras on this is suitable for discussion. And even the traditional scholars who stayed away from this discussion thread may tell the exact references in the texts which says having same sex relationships is disallowed practice in sanatana sampradaya.

  

Thank you.
