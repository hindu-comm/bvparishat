‡§Ø‡§•‡•á‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡§∏‡§ø ‡§§‡§•‡§æ ‡§ï‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å is the ultimate given to Arjuna by Krishna but Arjuna followed the path of krishna only.

  

The system accepts them means you can start adapting and promoting it.

  

Please refer the words of the Army General Bipin Rawat sir on this .

Atleast he maintained the dignity of army. But you Indic academicians are destroying the sanatana dharma which is respected through out the world evem more than indian army.

  

Indic academicians are using the scriptures for negative shades.

  

"Samoham sarvabhooteshu "

How that can be used in this context.

Direct question if their children becomes LGBTS will they accept it ?

Don't go till children let's think about their spouses ..

If their spouse become an LGBT at now will they share the bed with the other guy / other lady ?

  

Nothing personal here. Sir.

  

You yourself secure the civic senses within family and promotes these ideologies by misinterpreting the traditional texts in the name of sanatana dharma to the youth who don't have complete understanding of sanatana dharma .

  

Securing family and destroying society and showing "samoham sarvabhooteshu " as an example.

Do you feel us as who blindly follow.

The group itself is a Vidvat Parishad . Although we don't have extreme knowledge but we atleast maintain the dignity of a scholarship.

  

  

Let's think about the another example of the same text bhagavadgeeta and the example is

  

‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§µ‡§ø‡§®‡§ø‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•á --------

  

Because of this LGBTS people maintain good relation with the LGBTS. { ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ó‡§É }

  

Because of regular contact with the LGBTS there is a possibility to try it once. Definitely it happens .. The person who have lunatics in his circle have a more favourability to accept the drink ..

{ ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ó‡§æ‡§§‡•ç ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ú‡§æ‡§Ø‡§§‡•á ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ‡§É }

  

If he gets the taste it once he / she may have much more interest due to that. No pregnancy/ abortion issues for women ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ and will be in secret in society also. Both ways secured.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ

  

If they don't find same sex partner they will become angry due to that. { ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ‡§§‡•ç ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡•ã‡§ß‡•ã‡§≠‡§ø‡§ú‡§æ‡§Ø‡§§‡•á }

  

If that desire increases they start hunting for the people to make them forcibly LGBT. This also happens and happened too.

{ Forming groups ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•ç‡§Æ‡•ã‡§π‡§É start hunting innocents ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡•É‡§§‡§ø ‡§µ‡§ø‡§≠‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡§É }

  

I will give even the article and group invitations as a proof also.

  

After that hunting they start demanding perks and previlages for them. And states that opposite sex marriage people are discriminating against them... BLAW BLAW BLAW...

{ ‡§¨‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß‡§ø ‡§®‡§æ‡§∂: }

  

This is not a misconception it's a social concern and even I cited the same text also.

  

Directly the Indic academy supporting this in the name of sanatana dharma .

  

Sanatana dharma has its respect . You may promote it or leave it but don't misinterpret it for the sake of institution.

  

There are so many misinterpreters in India already even Indic Academy who supporting sastra sabhaa becomes like this the scholars may loose hope in the institutions.

  

So please rethink about these types of promotions.

  

Thank you.
