Thanks Sri Deepro Chakraborty.

  

I have to state that many "Hindus" are proud of their culture, scriptures etc, which includes me also. However, they assume that whatever they are doing and their elders and predecessors did are all great because all of them naturally follow dharma, as if they belong to some RAMA RAJYA where no one is offended. Even hindu scriptures basically have no CLEAR say regarding how LGBTQ should to be treated. I even checked many granthas. They mention "ShtreedharmAh" or "purusha dharmAh", There is no "LGBTQ" dharmah. One can assume, LGBTQ may not have any dharmas or vidhi and nishedha; how can anyone assume without any mention?. The problem still stands as to how others to treat them? this is not stressed anywhere deeply enough. Most people think that it is taboo to even talk about all these things.

However, silently the discrimination and disregard continues.
