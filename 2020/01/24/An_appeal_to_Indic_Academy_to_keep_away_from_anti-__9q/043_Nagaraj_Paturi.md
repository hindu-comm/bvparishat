Sharing two pictures shot just a month ago near my house in the heart of the Hyderabad city. These are the pictures of a person whom came as a 'priestess' for the Yellamma Puja that took place in a house in my neighborhood. When I asked the person to provide his phone number, he/she dictated his/her number and took my phone to enter his/her name, probably to make sure it is entered correctly. He/she entered it as Avanthika Yadav Jogini. He gave a schedule of his priestly engagements for the next few days and said that I could continue following him for my research as per that schedule.

  

I have been researching on this tradition of transgender jogins starting from my native place in Rayala Seema (southern AP) and continuing in Telangana (earlier northern AP) for the last three decades.

  

Should we consider such traditions as part of Hinduism or outside Hinduism ? Hinduism is not all about traditions like transgender jogins. But these traditions are definitely some very important aspects of Hinduism.

  

Unlike the transgenders in other countries with no such religious affiliation , these transgender jogins are respected as priestesses and spiritual mediators to communicate with the divine. Such facts of Hinduism, when brought into light, enhance the image of Hinduism.
