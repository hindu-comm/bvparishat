I am responding in behalf of Indic Academy here:

  

This conference on " Hindu Traditions of Sex, Gender and Sexuality" is being organized by Indic Academy in collaboration with Srishti, Madurai. Indic Academy collaborates with different such organizations for different themes. The criterion for agreeing to collaborate is ideological closeness. 100 % ideological agreement may not be possible. So we may have to go with ideological *closeness* only.

  

That said, within the activist groups working in the area of Gender Diversity , organizations like Srishti, Madurai are pro-Indic, pro-Hindu organizations. That is the reason Indic Academy agreed to collaborate with it.

  

----------------------------------------------

  

We at Indic Academy know that there is no consensus among contemporary pro-Indic circles with regard to inclusiveness towards non-binary gender aspects. We also know that there is basis in the Indic tradition for both the inclusionist and exclusionist views towards non-binary gender aspects.

  

Indic Academy considers that in the present conditions, leaving the scope for overemphasizing the exclusionist aspects and hiding the inclusionist aspects into the hands of the breaking India forces is not prudent on the part of pro-Indic movements and activisms. As such Indic Academy decided to provide platform for pro-Indic inclusionist views towards non-binary gender aspects. That is the reason for Indic Academy agreeing to collaborate with Srishti ,Madurai for the conference on " Hindu Traditions of Sex, Gender and Sexuality" .

  

-------------------------------------------------

  

Theinclusionist or non-exclusionist attitude in Indic culture towards sexual orientations other than the mainstream heterosexual orientations and gender can be studied under

  

Existence, reflection or documentation of facts of inclusion or non-exclusion.

  

These facts can further be classified into those found in the evidences from the Indic past and those found continuing in the current Indic customs, traditions and culture.



**a. Evidences from the Indic past**: Ancient India had its own share of exclusionist and inclusionist/non-exclusionist attitudes towards non-mainstream /minority sexual orientations. While there indeed are some code books treating homosexuality as a punishable act, the references to homosexual practices mentioned in Kamasutra, 300 BCE text undisputedly with Vedic foundation, do not have even a hint of exclusion or demeaning attitude while dealing with these aspects. Everything is as a matter of course. Sculptures depicting homosexual practices in Khujaraho temple complex (950-1050 CE) or Konark temple ( 13th Century CE) do not have any indications of a separate treatment to these orientations than the mainstream sexual orientations. Mahabharata (900 BCE), while mentioning Shikhandi , the character who is a woman born with male features, a hermaphrodite, does not have any expressions of pejoration. The same book, while narrating the events with character Brihannala, a male with feminine features, does not use any expressions of pathology, pity or disrespect. There are many androgyne characters depicted in verbal and nonverbal sources of Hindu mythological narratives. Images of Argdhanariswara form of Siva are received with ease, without any discomfort. Narratives of Vishnu taking a feminine form Mohini, and even having intercourse with Shiva in that form, to beget a son Ayyappa are narrated and received just as matter of course. There are temples (for eample in Ryali, Andhra Pradesh) for Jaganmohini of Vishnu with the idol having masculine Vishnu form on one side and the feminine Jaganmohini form on the other. Krishna, the male god is adored for the feminine features of his enchanting beauty. There are expressions like Kittamma (Telugu) refering to Krishna in a feminine form andTukaram referred to Vithal, Krishna’s form popular in Maharashtra, as Vitha-ai, Mother Vithal.Male devotees of Krishna looking at themselves as Gopis (cowherd women ) , Manjaris ( the romance-assisting friends of Radha, the chiefmost Gopi-lover of Krishna) etc. the feminine characters of the Krishna narratives has been in vogue from centuries. Interpreting Gopis of Bhagavata as Rishis in their feminine form is a popular interpretation of the book.



**b. Facts continuing in the current Indic customs, traditions and culture**: It is a common sight during auspicious occasions such as weddings, celebrations of baby birth etc. at Hindu homes to see 'Hijras' visiting the venue of celebration, entertaining through dances and songs blessing the newly wed couple, new born baby etc. affectionately 'demanding' big amounts of money as a gift in return for the blessing, receiving the 'gift' usually without much dispute or discussion. These families believe that the visit of the hijras and their blessings is auspicious for them and the curse of the hijras is inauspicious for them. In the region covered by the present states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and (southern) Andhra Pradesh, transgenders ( born males living as females ) are found living a lifestyle of Jogin (a female ritually 'married' (dedicated ) to (the devotional service of ) the god /goddess. These transgenders are called Jogthi / Jogappa. Except in Telangana, these Jogthis / Jogappas leave the homes of their birth and live a wanderers' life. In Telangana, most often, they stay with their families. At the temples Ellamma, Uligamma, Tulja Bhavani etc., devotees seek blessings from the transgenders and donate to them. A similar cult of transgenders is found dedicated to the god Aravan in Tamil Nadu.These transgenders are called Tirunangai / Aravani. In the spirit possessions which are part offolk worship traditions, particularly south India, it is common for some males to get possessed by village goddesses and behave femininely during possession. These males usually behave femininely when they are not possessed too. These individuals are called "sivasattulollu" (Shiva-Shakti people) in Telangana. People seek blessings from these people too. Common feature found in Jogthi/Jogappa, Thirunangai / Aravani , Sivasattulollu etc is that transgenders enjoy a respect and protected from the usual scorn by
religion . Ritual-time transgenderism is a mandated common practice in many Shakteya tantric rituals and folk and tribal goddess worship rituals. There are many transgender shamans, supernatural healers, and other occult practitioners who are consulted by people for healing and other supernatural mediations with a belief that transgenderism provides greater access to the supernatural.
