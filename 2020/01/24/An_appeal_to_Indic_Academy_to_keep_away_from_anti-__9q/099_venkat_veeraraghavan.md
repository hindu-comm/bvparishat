QUOTE

*“Humans start with a gender-neutral embryo and the sex-determination happens only after seven weeks due to a complex combination of genes.”*

  

Given that chromosomal sex is determined at the time of fertilization, the claim that humans start with gender-neutral embryos is obviously incorrect and unscientific.

Misraji:- The devil apparently is in the details. Gender and Sex are semantically different entities as per some previous posts (I forget where I saw this). And there in lies a tale. This is one rabbit hole that will turn me inside out. Better not to jump inside.

  

You seem mystified by SL's expertise (?) May be she is a polymath who forgot to include gender studies in her online intro along with law, politics and philosophy. Or maybe gender studies / genetics has become subsumed as a part of philosophy in modern times.

  

All things are possible.

Incidentally I was chatting up a friend about this very thread and I remembered your name (fondly) for your takedown of DP. And hey presto you make an appearance on the thread!

  

These are synchronistic times.
