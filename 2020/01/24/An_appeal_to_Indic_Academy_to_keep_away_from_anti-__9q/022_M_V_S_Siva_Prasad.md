Nice point kashyap sir ,

  

  

आहार निद्रा भय मैथुनानि

समानि सर्वाणि नरांपशुनाम् ।

ज्ञानोहि तेषामधिको विशेषः

ज्ञानो विहीन: पशुभि: समानाः ।।

  

In the mahishasura story his father marries a mahishi { bufello } . Its in purana text.

Basing on this if some institution promotes human animal sex and another institution wants to promote it by sponsoring etc......

Will you show the cross sexual relation tendencies between animals as a research proof ?

Is it the purpose of the scientific temperament to use it in this way ???
