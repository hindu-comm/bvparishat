Namaste,

  

condemning something which is natural is not correct. If it is natural for everyone to be heterosexual, then about 7% of non-human species cannot be found to be homosexual. However, scientists have found out that about 7% of those species are homosexual. experiments on human beings is very hard. But many medical professionals and scientists are finding out that truth is more towards nature rather than nurture regarding LBGTQ. Hence one has to be careful in condemning. It is better to keep quiterather than condemn something. If it is a condition which is genetic, there is no need for condemning. Would you condemn a diabetic patient, just because by birth that person became a diabetic due to some inherited or mutated gene?

  

the other extreme is also not good. One may argue that someone did a serious crime and even if everyone agreed in some future day that criminal behaviour is totally due to genetic reasons, even then Law will certainly enforce punishment to that criminal, since no one can harm others and get away.

  

In the case of LGBTQ can you prove that homosexuality is more criminal than heterosexuality? You may think it is odd and most people are heterosexuals. You are free to express your views. But it is unfair to treat them badly.
