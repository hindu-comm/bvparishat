Dear Prof. Nagaraj,

  

Thank you for bringing to my attention the post by **Sri Shrivatsa B**. I am surprised that BVP forum tolerates such bigoted noisemakers who don't add anything to knowledge, but only generate noise. This takes away from the credibility of BVP itself. The video presentation of the talk by Dr. Anuradha Udumudi was already posted on IndicToday several days ago which if this egregious person watched he would have learnt something.Here is the link:<https://www.indictoday.com/videos/indic-perspective-on-sex-gender-sexuality-dr-anuradha-udumudi/>

  

The summary report he quotes was written by a student who attended the program. The author of the summary intends to point out that the sexual differentiation in an embryo starts after the 7th week. There is nothing wrong in that statement. Though the genetic component (acquisition of Y-chromosome) is determined at conception, the differentiation itself is kicked off in the embryo by expression of the SRY gene on the Y-chromosome which only male embryos would have. Now there are several pathways that could potentially be disrupted by variants or mutations on any of the more than 100 genes involved in the differentiation (including SRY) which would could potentially give rise to a spectrum of presentations. For instance, a fetus could be XY at conception but still be born as a female.

  

Medical practice so far has used sex chromosomes as the means to determine and assign sex in case of ambiguous genetalia cases, or cases with intersex presentation. But with actual expression of genes involved in sexual differentiation being recognized as being more important, and with the ability to sequence hundreds of genes (in our laboratory) to find any variants or mutations that could impact their expression, taking a deeper look becomes imperative for physicians.

  

At the same time, one should understand that the expression or non-expression of these genes involved would give rise to several variants, pathogenic and non-pathogenic, impacting various aspects of sex characteristics, and most likely gender identity, gender expression and sexuality as well. Though the research is inconclusive and not developed on these later aspects (where epigenetics could also play a major role), the research is clear about sex and sexual characteristics. While there are about 100-150 genes involved in sex differentiation from conception to adolescence, there are about 6,500 genes which differ in expression between males and females across the whole genome. Anyone who understands this will also understand that genetic science does support non-binary view of sex. This is what is being communicated.

  

  

**Discussion about a case from GeneTech which was diagnosed yesterday**

I would like to talk about an interesting and relevant case we reported only yesterday at our laboratory. I am presenting this to show how complexity can exist for declating something as simple as sex of a child (though in this case it falls in the binary and there is no intersex situation).

  

The parents came to us with a baby which the doctors **declared as female** at birth. But after a month, they became doubtful and referred them to an pediatric endocrinologist. The penis was so small that the doctors thought it was a slightly larger clitoris. No testes were present (externally), but were actually undescended (hypospadias). And the anatomical development of the genital area was as it would be for a female child, except for the urethral opening. A more detailed examination showed that the child did not have internal genitaliaof a female and the hormonal tests were ambiguous, just as the external genitalia were.

  

Sequencing of about 150 genes at GeneTech revealed two Single Nucleotide variants -- on STAR and CHD7 genes. The diagnosis explained that the child is in fact MALE without doubt. Prognosis was given based on other reported cases worldwide. The parents will raise the child as MALE but we will have to wait until adolescence to see if there is any gender dysphoria -- most likely there may not be any.
