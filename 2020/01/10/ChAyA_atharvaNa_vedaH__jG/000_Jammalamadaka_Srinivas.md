Namaste,

  

Has any scholar of the group is aware of 'chAyA atharvaNa vedaH (छायाथर्वणवेदः)? Is it any vikRti of atharvaNa Veda?

I heard the mantras of this Veda from a nRsimhopasAka named 'V V Srdhar Guruji'. His followers believe that he is the only person remaining in the tradition.

Namo vidwadbhyaH.

  

Srinivas Jammalamadaka
