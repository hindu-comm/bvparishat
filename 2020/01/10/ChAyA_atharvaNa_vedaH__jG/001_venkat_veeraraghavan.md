I think I know where you are coming with this. If you are referring to THE Sridhar "guruji"...I have checked with Shri Gowthan Sarma Mahamkali who happens to be an AV adhyapaka and he says it seems like some sort of tantric prayoga and has no connection with the traditional AV.

  

I have heard stories of the man offering diamonds and other precious metals in the havan kunda. People can claim what they wish, but ultimately if and when the mango ripens it will have to come on to the plate.

Ultimately proof of the pudding is in the eating.
