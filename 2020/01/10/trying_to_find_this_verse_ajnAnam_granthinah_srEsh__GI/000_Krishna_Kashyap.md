Namaskar,

  

I am trying to find this verse: "ajnAnam granthinah srEshtAh"  

the next line is probably: GranthinAm dhAriNahsreEshtAh

  

the meaning is among the dull witted, the ones who read granthas are better

among the ones who read the granthas, those who retain the knowledge are better.

  

  

this may be in manu dharma shastra.

  

I am trying to find the larger verse which has several more lines.

  

Thanks.

*Best Regards,*
