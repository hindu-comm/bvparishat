नमो विद्वद्भ्यः।

Your guidance is solicited in writing

an article on 'Socio linguistic aspects in Karaka theory'. katyanana's vartikam is one example I selected. Please enlighten me inthis aspect.

  

"aśiṣṭavyavahāre dāṇaḥ prayoge caturthyarthe tṛtīyā”. The Instrumental has the force of the Dative, in connection with the verb ‘dā’ ‘to give,’ when immoral conduct is implied. And affixes of Ātmanepadī are employed to the verb ‘dā’ (saṃyacchate).

As “dāsyā saṃyacchate kāmukaḥ”. The Profligate gives to the slave to entice her.

But when moral conduct is meant, Dative case (bhāryāyai) is used and affixes of parasmaipadī (saṃyacchati) are employed to the verb ‘dā’. 

“dharme tu bhāryāyai saṃyacchati”. He gives to his wife.

The verb ‘dā’ alone takes the instrumental case, with the force of the Dative, under certain circumstances like code of conduct.
