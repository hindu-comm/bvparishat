This is a request on behalf of a student:

  

Are there any good commentaries/ lectures (books/ YouTube) on S훮nkhya k훮rika and Ved훮nta s훮ra?  
  
The student currently is using the commentaries of Kaivalyadhama Publications, but any info on additional sources will be helpful.

  

Thanks and regards
