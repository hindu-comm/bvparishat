Thank you Ireneji ^\_^

I use the site word by word Qur'an you gave. That's very helpful.  
I use these also.

This is for commentary =  
<https://www.islamicstudies.info/tafheem.php?sura=2&verse=8>

This is for Voice/Transliteration. I literally learnt the first Surah with Swaras.

I use my Hindi book and another English pdf.

But what I require is Maariful Quran in Hindi. All 8 volumes.  
I found this while I was researching for it.

But I couldn't find proper structured commentary, like how Sanskrit texts have.

See becuase the metaphors and idiomatic usages are abundant. I just cant understand them without proper comnentary.

Try searching through Gita Supersite, see how comprehensive the commentaries and how many they have listed.

I found a good English pdf but will be glad if I got that Maariful in Hindi.
