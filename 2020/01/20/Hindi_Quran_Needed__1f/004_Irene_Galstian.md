Rishi ji,

  

Quranic commentaries (tafseers), and any other commentaries, reflect the commentator's own perceptions, which in some cases are outright agendas. If we want the convenience of receiving teachings from an embodied person, we can't avoid their body of assumptions (literally the commentator's body). For explanations (and all such explanations are interpretations), you may try Wahidi's compilation, translated (and that's another layer of interpretation) here:

  

<https://www.altafsir.com/Books/Asbab%20Al-Nuzul%20by%20Al-Wahidi.pdf>  

  

  

If I see the Hindi version of Maariful Quran somewhere, I'll post a link. I don't have access to physical copies of this book.
