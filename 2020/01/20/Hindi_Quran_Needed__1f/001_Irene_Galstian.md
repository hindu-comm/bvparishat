I suggest reading the Qur'an in Arabic as much as possible. Subtleties of meaning often have to do with the roots from which the words have arisen, and that's visible in Arabic.

Please have a look at<http://corpus.quran.com>. It might help with translation and grammar.

Another thing worth doing is researching the rules and the process of recitation. As you know, the word 'Qur'an' can be applied only to the oral recitation, whereas printed text is called Mushaf. You may want to hear different qaris and find what appeals to you. Qur'an is sound, not commentaries or translations.
