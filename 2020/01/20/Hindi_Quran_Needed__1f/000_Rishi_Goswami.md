Namo Haraye

Namaste to Scholars

I have started reading Qur'an recently. I read Surah Fatiah, now on Al Bakarah.

The issue is, the book I have is very nice, published by Sa govt, but has only 1 page intro to Surah, Arabic text, Hindi translation and footnotes.

It is organized not like how we write Tikas. Take eg of Raghuvamsha, we give Anvay, proper Shabdartha, certain Samasa, then Hindi meaning. Gita also if we see Prabhupada, he has given very nice transliteration, word-meanings and Purport.

I'm using 6 tabs currently. 1 where the grammar etc explained. 1 where recitation is there, one for English commentary on Verses, 1 for sound and recitation etc.

If you have, then please provide some Hindi (not Urdu) translation with good commentary.

Like this Saudi book just mentions Nabi Sallallahu etc and says Mmd is last Nabi in lineage of Ibrahim Sallallahu etc. But doesn't explain what Nabi means. It says Bani Israel was Yakub's son, and Ibrahim's grandson but doesn't say what Israel means and what Israel tribe is.

The verses 2.11-19 somewhere have many metaphors, but doesn't explain what significance they have.

Please provide some good commentary which explains us the context and doesn't use hard words like Ghaib, Munaphik etc.

Namskara.
