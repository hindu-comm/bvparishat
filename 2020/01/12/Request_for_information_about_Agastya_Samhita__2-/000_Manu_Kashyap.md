Pranams to all,

  

I would like to request the members of this group if they could share any information about the book named "Agastya Samhita" published under Sri Jayachamarajendra Grantharatnamala in the year 1952. I have a copy in which the table of content pages are missing. Therefore looking for it. Any leads about where about of the book or a scanned copy of it will be very helpful.

I have also attached the cover page of the book for reference.  

  

Regards,

Manu Kashyap C M
