Another guess (likely to be wrong):

In the *s'is'ira-r'tu*, if it is too cold,

kids unable to bear the same may, shivering, just babble and gabble  

(make an indistinct sound with their teeth

= lot of noise, and just no sense).

And this is provided as an analogy for the Vedantins

who, in the Kali-age blabber a great deal with not much of sense

as their utterances are not backed by experience.

A wild guess.
