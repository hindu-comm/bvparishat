Dear Prof. Kannan,

  

  Thanks for sharing this Marathi explanation. The festival of Holi comes in the month of Phālguna, and the rowdy behavior of some people, especially their use of obscene language, during this festival is what is referred to in this verse. In Marathi, the phrase शिमगा करणे has the meaning of using abusive languagetoward someone, and the word शिमगा refers to the festival of Holi.
