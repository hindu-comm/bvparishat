I have tried to make a 20 day course book to teach Sanskrit. This by my own learning experience and teaching experience, I understand would be a good method book to teach Sanskrit, can be used as a Self Tutor.  
  
It focuses on many aspects, mainly functionality. I learnt Sanskrit through Grammar and could only speak fluently after that. For eg, If I didn't learn विधिनिमन्त्रण I wouldn't be able to grasp the vastness of th3 functionality of लिङ्. There are more usages, सम्भावना, हेतुहेतुमत् which can be compiled at one place and the various functions be taught with examples.  
  
I'd never know through common tutor books that गम् धातु has 4 meanings. Or various usages of भू also. The famous narrative that if we teach Grammar to students nobody will learn displeases me. Because there will be no clarity, and no one can be fluent without clarity.  
  
Yes we should not teach any language through Grammar but completely neglecting it as it becomes tough is not correct.  
  
In my very short teaching experience I did realize that there is no conviction in this language. Only students who study without any commercial angle, or getting advantages through language angle, who are genuinely interested in learning Shastra (Gita etc) study seriously. Rest will lose interest and complain that the language is tough.  
  
In this, I've tried my best to compile both aspects, Prayoga and Siddhanta, fused with Abhyasa. Like how an Act/Article (in law) becomes boring if learnt without context, similarly Siddhanta without various examples will serve no purpose.  
  
This book is yet incomplete. I want to add 2-3 Excercise lessons in this. 1 Lesson with 2-3 Practice Excercises. In this way, 20 lessons and each lesson with 2-3 pages of good practice related to the current lesson.  
  
I'm trying teaching Sanskrit through this book online. I hope this method works. I would also like to know your feedback on the book and want to learn from your teaching experience, what method works best.
