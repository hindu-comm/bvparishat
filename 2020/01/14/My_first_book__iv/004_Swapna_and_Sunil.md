Namaḥste Rishi ji,

  

Thank you for sharing the link to the book with us. For rank beginners like myself, any help is appreciated. I did print out a copy and plan to read it over the next couple of weeks. I am reminded of a similar approach in a book by Pandit. Satvalekar (Sanskrit Svayam Shikshak).

  

May your kind of people who are interested in propagating this beautiful language prosper!

  

Respectfully,

  

Sunil
