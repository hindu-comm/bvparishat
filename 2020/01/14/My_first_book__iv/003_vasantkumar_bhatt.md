Dear Rishi ji,

Namaste ! There are many more books for Sanskrit Language teaching.
But every new effort is always welcome. Because, I believe that, every teacher has his own different insight / method to teach the language. Your method may / will appeal to someone. ( Minimum, you will teach the language to yourself by producing these lessons ! ) So, go ahead. Best wishes.
