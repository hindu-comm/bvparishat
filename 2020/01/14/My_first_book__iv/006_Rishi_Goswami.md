Sorry for late reply. सादरं वन्दे विदुषः।  
I saw the responses just today. Thank you everyone, vidvans for the kind words. I am very grateful to you and this community.  
  
I have seen 2-3 books, like Swayam Shikshak. But I loved Shri Janardan Hegde's book Abhyasa Darshini alot.  
  
Why I'm creating new because I think we need to understand various functional aspects of verbs/suffixes in Sanskrit. Rather thab starting from Apple, Banana vocabulary, we should start with Dhatus, as most Shabdas in Sanskrit form through Dhatus. Vocabulary is so vast it will become impossible for a person to utter sentences without getting the functional aspects, structure of the language, Important Grammar related to functionality and alot of practice. This is just my belief, I can be wrong though.  
  
I have started the course since yesterday, For eg, I found some errors in the first day, where I used a Samasta pada, दशरथपुत्रः which confused students.  
  
My effort is to create a method book, which can be self sufficient, covers good basic functional grammar and is fulled with various examples. I think one can never be fluent in any language if he doesn't understand the functionality. And new excercises to be added soon. This I will need to correct and update by trial and error, by teaching it at least 5-6 times.  
  
If there are any suggestions, or criticism/feedback all is welcome \_/\\\_.  
  
Thank you  
Pranamami.
