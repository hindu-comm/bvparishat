Dear Rishi Goswami  
  
These kind of posts deserve more replies. The reason for not getting is clear.  
  
Your efforts are really great.  
  
नहि सर्वाधिकारकं किमपि शास्त्रमस्ति so these efforts shouldn't be stopped.  
  
I like 1. Bhandarkar books for learning Sanskrit 2. Apte Composition 3. Higher Sanskrit Grammar Anundoram Borooah.  
  
Thanks
