In Feb 2017, on another list, there was this post :

  

Dear Friends,

  

Thanks to funds made available through[SARI](http://sari.anu.edu.au/), weare beginning to organise a small conference/workshop on 'Yoga and Sexual Violence'. This builds on the conference we organised last year about['Yoga and the Body'](http://sari.anu.edu.au/yoga-and-the-body-past-and-present/).

  

The tentative timing for the conference is scheduled for the**second half of 2017**. The most likely date is**sometime in November**, which is a lovely time to be in Canberra, Australia.

  

A confirmed date, more information, and an official call for papers will occur in the next few months. For now, we invite you to*save the date.*We will consider all possibilities that explore the theme, which includes perspectives that are grounded in philology, history, anthropology, and beyond.

  

All the best,
