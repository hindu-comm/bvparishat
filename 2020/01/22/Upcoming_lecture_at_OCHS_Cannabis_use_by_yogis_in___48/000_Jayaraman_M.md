Namaste  

  

I received a newsletter through email about the activities and lecture announcements of Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies yesterday Jan 21,2020.  

  

They have scheduled a lecture  

## \>\>Cannabis use by yogis in India

*Dr. Matthew Clarke*  
Week 8, Tuesday 10 March, 2.00-3.00, OCHS Library

Details of this can be seen here: <https://ochs.org.uk/lectures/forthcoming>

  

The following is the outline of the talk given in the above link -

*In this talk we will survey what is known about the use of cannabis in India from the earliest records until modern times. In my book, The Tawny One: Soma, Haoma and Ayahuasca (London/New York: Muswell Hill Press, 2017), one of the chapters was devoted to this topic. Although there are a few occasional references in the Vedas (the oldest religious texts of South Asia) to what may be cannabis, the plant does not appear in medical texts until around 1,000 years ago. The use of cannabis for recreational purposes was mainly introduced into India by radical Sufis (known variously as Qalandar, Heydari or Malang) in the 13th century. Some South Asian yogis use cannabis heavily as a form of tapas. The use of cannabis was made illegal in India in 1986, since when recreational use has declined. However, in some areas cannabis is still legal, and bhāṅg (a form of the plant prepared for oral consumption) is still widely available in north India. In this talk we will also look briefly at different kinds of cannabis preparations in South Asia.*

  

I have responded to the mail stating the following -

## *\>\>Cannabis use by yogis in India*

*Dr. Matthew Clarke  
Week 8, Tuesday 10 March, 2.00-3.00, OCHS Library*

*I feel that very respected organizations like OCHS should kindly consider hosting lectures on worthwhile topics on Yoga rather than the one listed above. When there are many healing and elevating philosophical dimensions of Yoga (increasingly being evidenced by scientific research also) to be explored and presented to students and scholars, giving centre stage to practices such as "the use of Cannabis" that are not known to have any useful outcomes to humanity at large may kindly be reconsidered.

*It is my sincere request that it would be very beneficial if global platforms such as yours host lectures on Yoga topics such as Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama and Dhyana etc which can provide solace and relief to the entire humanity. In the lecture description also I did not see the utility of the discussion/lecture presented anywhere. I feel, As researchers and academics we have a responsibility to be constructive.
