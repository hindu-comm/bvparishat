Many thanks, Shreevatsa ji, for pointing to this treasure trove.

  

And a thousand-fold greater gratitude to Professors Peter Adamson and Jonardon Ganeri and the institutions which made this possible. Podcasts are so convenient given the hundreds hours we spend in car every year.

  

I am especially excited at the opportunity to learn about other systems of thought such as Africana philosophy. I heard the first podcast on Indian Philosophy and am of the view that this series would offer a balanced introduction.

  

There are more than 250 episodes dealing with Greek Philosophy, 62 episodes dealing with Indian Philosophy (ending around Dignaga), and 44 episodes dealing with 'Africana Philosophy' (Babylonia, Egyptian etc.) as of Jan 19, 2020.
