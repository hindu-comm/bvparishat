As it does not seem to have been mentioned explicitly:

this is presumably based on the authors' work for their "History of Philosophy without any gaps" podcast. The 62 episodes related to India are available [online](https://historyofphilosophy.net/india) (parts [1](https://historyofphilosophy.net/india/origins), [2](https://historyofphilosophy.net/india/age-sutra), [3](https://historyofphilosophy.net/india/buddhists-jains)).
