Dear Dhaval Patel,

  

As I had brought to your notice earlier, I could not open or read tje text file of any of the .txt file you had provided so far in notepad or word. I could not neither use the zipped file also you had procided earlier. It reads only encoded text only in word or notepad.

  

Can you help me to solve the problem?

  

In doc. I got the error message "An error has occurred while trying to upload and convert your document.". In word in which I could read any unicode document, I could never open the document.
