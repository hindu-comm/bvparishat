\~[8:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Erxm70VGjfE&t=539s): "The third caliphate is the Abbasid caliphate. It ruled from Baghdad, from 750 CE to 1258 CE. ... So, in this period, Muslim scholars began to discover Indian works of Mathematics, Science, Art etc. These were translated **from Sanskrit into Arabic** and as a result, the Islamic world discovered concepts such as toxicology, pharmacology, surgery, astronomy, the decimal system, algebra and trigonometry. And for a few centuries, while India fell into decline, the Islamic world enjoyed a golden age where Mathematics, Science and Astronomy prospered and flourished." (almost verbatim)
