Dear Vidvans

What is the significance of the amavasya of the month of pausha in Vedic lore?

During the kumbhamela it is one of the most significant dates for shahi snan as it is believed that amrita is available on that tithi. It is also a day spent in mauna by sadhu or a day to start a maunavrata.

Please share any details or references from shastras.

Thanks.

Regards,

Venkat
