Dear Vidwans,

  

The reason for asking for information is I am teaching adivasi students Marathi. The phonetic distance between their dialect and formal Marathi is as large as between Indian formal languages and chaste Sanskrit language.

  

As a first step I started with teaching them the barakhadi sutras which I have already posted on this list. The second step was obviously teaching them single words. The words available in Marathi अंकलिपी book were used.

  

In this context I was interested to know how was teaching Sanskrit initiated prior to the Ashtadhyayi.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
