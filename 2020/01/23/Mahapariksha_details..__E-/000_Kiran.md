Hello All,

  

I have heard a lot about Tenali Mahapariksha and some about Ahmednagar Exams.

  

I googled them, I see some articles etc on Tenali but none on Ahmednagar.

  

I would like to know why these exams are ? How intensive they are ? And, by doing them what one gets in terms of worldly benefits and self-satisfied knowledge ?

  

Thanks,

Kiran
