You asked  

"I would like to know why these exams are ? How intensive they are ? And, by doing them what one gets in terms of worldly benefits and self-satisfied knowledge ?"  
  

These exams are made to qualify a student in Shastras like Mimansa Vedanta or Nyaya.  
  
  
Intensive- very intensive course as it covers the shastra from the scratch to the pinnacle.  
  
Last question : Very subjective. Even I am preparing for the exams and taking up from next year. For me worldly things hardly matters. संविदेव परमप्रयोजनम्।  
All great inventions in science or math were done not for worldly things. A famous tennis player once replied to an interviewer, when he has been asked why do you climb mt Everest. the answer was, "because it is there".  
  
For instance when prime number was discovered by a mathematician he had no idea of its application. When newton discovered the theories he had no idea about the advancement. Everything was to their own satisfaction.
