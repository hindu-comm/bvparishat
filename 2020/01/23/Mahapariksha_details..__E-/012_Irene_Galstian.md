It seems to me that Krishnaprasad G didn't mean 'self satisfaction' in the ordinary sense of that expression, but more along the lines of study in itself vs study for the sake of obtaining something else (including self satisfaction in the ordinary sense). This is a man who spent untold amounts of his personal money to develop Vedic fonts, which he then gives away, so texts can be properly typeset.
