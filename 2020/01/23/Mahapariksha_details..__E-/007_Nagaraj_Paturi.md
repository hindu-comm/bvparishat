Dear Sri M V S Siva Prasad-ji,

  

What Sri Krishna Prasad-ji is talking about is the worldlyadvantages to the scholars from studying the shaastra. Not about the worldly applications or any other prayojana of the shaastra.

  

Shaastras were created, studied taught and learnt by people who were not after worldly benefits from their study.

  

Even today, Philosophy, the greatest, of all the academic disciplines, is not a sought after discipline for those who are after the worldly benefits.

  

Those who keep complaining that a particular community denied shaastras to others do not talk about this. Would the world at large have asked for shaastras ? The world at large has always been happy pursuing the knowledge and skill areas that are immediately and directly provide them livelihood. Always, only a few who did not bother about such immediate and direct livelihood benefits from the activity of studying, studied shaastras in the traditional system , disciplines like Philosophy in the university academics.
