Dear all,

  

Sri Bhagavatutla Anjaneya Sharma, a great Hanumad-upasaka, has been doing a fantastic service for the preservation of shastras for more than twenty years. His modus operandi is to send the student to the scholar wherever he is and give a stipend to the student and honorarium to the teacher depending on the number of students. For example, if there are four students registered for study of vyakarana, he sends them to some vyakarana scholar who may be in Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad or any such place. There are at least ten semesters for every shastra and there are tests at the end of every semester. All such tests take place in Tenali wherethe invigilators assemble. In fact, it is a one-man university.

I knew Sri Sharma for a long time and had personally seen his work by visiting his house, which is the 'university'.

Sometime ago I introduced him to Sri Harikiran, who quickly admired the work and started helping the institution every year. That is how the Indic Academy got connected.
