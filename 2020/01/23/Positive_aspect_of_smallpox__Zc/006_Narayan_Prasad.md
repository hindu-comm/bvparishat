\<\< This means the body cleansed of it's (dieases's) most powerful juices.>\>  

  

No. Here, its ---> of the body, and not of the disease.

Actually in the Russian text no word equivalent to this pronoun "its" has been used.

You could just read this sentence thus: "the disease cleansed my body of most powerful and destructive juices".

Word by word translation of the relevant portion is as follows:

  

... следы этой  болезни,

... traces  of this disease,

  

зато она            в самом начале      жизни

but it (i.e. disease)   in the very beginning  of life

  

разом                      освободила

at once (in a single stroke)      freed

  

мое тело

my body

  

от   всех вредных  и   острых        соков.

from  all   harmful    and  acute/critical     
juices.

  

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
