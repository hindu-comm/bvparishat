**"At a very early stage of my life the disease cleansed my body of its most powerful and destructive juices, and to this day barely noticeable scars remain on my face."**  

  

What powerful and destructive juices does a young child's body have naturally that smallpox cleansed of? More destructive than smallpox?

  

Written word can be interpreted variously, and sometimes, we read what we want to read.

  

Smallpox has killed mostly. A few who could survive, would come out string.

Is it something like giving horse small doses of venom, to make it venom resistant after some time? Same principle applying for smallpox survivors? That if you survivor you will be strong.

  

Reminds me of the saying 'Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger.'

  

I guess, I am trying to say is there are no positive aspects of smallpox, that one would take the risk of getting it purposefully, hoping to benefit, because survival is not the norm with smallpox.

  

But an academic study of various diseases can be done, from a toxicology point of view.

  

  
  

Thanks,
