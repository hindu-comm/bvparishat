Dear Scholars,  
  Namaste.  
  I am translating from Russian the autobiography of [Aleksandr Nikitenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Nikitenko) (1804-1877), who was although born a serf, but not only he got freedom from serfdom at the age of 20, but later rose to a very high status in the czarist Russia. In ch.4 of his autobiography, he writes:  
  

**"I don’t know why I wasn’t vaccinated against smallpox. I suppose vaccination at that time was not as extensive in the provinces as it is today. This circumstance nearly cost me my life. I was stricken with an unusually virulent form of smallpox, but perhaps I owe my present good health to it. At a very early stage of my life the disease cleansed my body of its most powerful and destructive juices, and to this day barely noticeable scars remain on my face."**  
  
This means that smallpox has its positive aspect as well. Is there any mention of such aspect in the Ayurveda?  
  
Regards  
Narayan Prasad
