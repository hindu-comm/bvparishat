In Indic folk culture, smallpox is considered to be a 'blessing' from the mother goddess. This can be a religious /sacral articulation of the folk medical understanding of what you call positive aspects in your post.

In Dravidian culture and local mythology, Smallpox/Chickenpox is regarded a test time to see the devotion of the victim to the Goddess (Amman). ***As a result, the local beliefs is that, a person who recovered from Smallpox/Chickenpox is actually blessed by Goddess.***

During the time when infected with smallpox/chickenpox, the traditional justification of isolating the person to a room was that, the patient needs a private interaction/devotion to the Goddess.

This is a tradition very common in Tamil Nadu as well as Kerala as the base culture for both states are very much common.

In Kerala perspective, we have a Goddess for Smallpox called**VASOORIMALA**

*Goddess Vasoorimala worshiped as Muthumariamman in Trivandrum. The fire represents the pain of the disease -smallpox/chickenpox thro’ which devotees has to undergo and cured by neem leaves on other hand.*

There is a huge Myth associated with it in Kerala. I am not sure, whether its true in Tamil Nadu, but believe many concepts could be similar.

The tradition of worshiping Kali and Vasoorimala is very strong in Kerala, whenever someone gets infected with Smallpox/chickenpox. Small pox is now eradicated, so now only Chickenpox remaining.

*The performance of Vasoorimala Theyyam with Ghantakaran Theyyam in temples of Malabar.*

*Vasoorimala Theyyam*

In Malabar side, Vasoorimala is represented through a[***Theyyam***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theyyam)(a ritualistic art where the Theyyam performer becomes occultic and prophesies to the devotees). Relatives of those who affected with the chickenpox pray to organize a Vasoorimala theyyam and believed the turmeric thrown by the Theyyam (Goddess) will cure the person. Normally Vassorimala Theyyam is accompanied by Ghantakaran Theyyam to cure people from the disease.

In Central and South Kerala, Vasoorimala is worshiped like any other deity in the temples of Bhadrakali. The most famous is the Shrine of Vasoorimala in Kodungalloor temple near Kochi.

[Kodungalloor temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodungallur_Bhagavathy_Temple)is extremely famous for worshiping Kannagi (heroine of Tamil epic-[Silapprathikkaram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silappatikaram)) who attained her ferocious form of Kali. There is a small shrine of Vasoorimala outside the temple where devotees throw packets of turmeric over the statue’s body to avoid being infected with chickenpox.

*The shrine of Vasoorimala in temple of Kodungalloor. There is no poojas in this temple, but devotees throw packets of turmeric constantly over the goddess. This turmeric is used as a medicine for chickenpox.*

I don’t know whether the following legend is famous in Tamil Nadu. But very famous in Kerala, that in 11th century Chola Army invaded Chera capital of Mahodayapuram (Kodungallor) and defeated Cheras. They looted the Chera temple of Thiruvanchikulam and heard much more treasures were kept in nearby Kodungallor temple. A whole Chola army marched to Kodungalloor temple and the Devi (Goddess) got furious who cursed the entire army with Smallpox. When Chola Emperor[Raja Raja Chola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raja_Raja_Chola_I)heard this, he rushed to Kodungalloor and sought forgiveness to the Goddess (It must be noted Kannagi is actually a Chola Princess before attaining to Kali as per legends). The Goddess asked the King to worship Vasoorimala and accordingly Chola Emperor worshiped the goddess. The turmeric given by Vasoorimala cured the entire Chola army.

Due to this belief, anyone affected with Smallpox or Chickenpox prays Kodungallor Devi and the Rakthachandanam (Red Sandal) & Turmeric Paste received from the temple as Prasadam is seen as a curative medicine for Smallpox.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

***When a patient is inflicted with the Smallpox/chickenpox, its believed they got the blessings of Vasoorimala*** as the disease happens when the sweat drop of lord Shiva touches the body. And the disease being cured when Ghantakaran licks the sores (symbolically by spreading neem leaves over the body), thus purifying the body. Thus the legend of Kali blessing the devotee by Smallpox/Chickenpox is too popular in Kerala and hence the disease is never seen in a negative light worth for panicking. Even if death happens, its regarded sacred as the belief is that person attained to the feet of Kali. So technically there is no celebration as such, rather the disease has an aura of sanctity.

I guess it should have similar legends in Tamil Nadu too, due to our shared history.

  

In comments to this quora post, Sri Kannan Narayanan says,

  

"I don't think that there is anything uniquely Dravidian about this. In North India as well, Small pox is deified as Seetla Devi and kids with chicken pox/small pox are said to have been visited by “Mata”."
