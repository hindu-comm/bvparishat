To Shankaraji,

     Sir, I feel much hesitation to encroach upon your valuabletime again and again. But confide in me Sir, I am in urgent need of some old books which are not available in open market in West Bengal. I,therefore, humbly request you to kindly help me by giving me information of those books from time time. Now I humbly request you to kindly give me an information of Kavyalankarasara Sangraha of UDVATA with Hindi commentary/translation if available.

                      With deepest regard Sir,

                                   
         

                                   
                                 Yours sincerely,

                                   
                                 
Sebanti Sinha
