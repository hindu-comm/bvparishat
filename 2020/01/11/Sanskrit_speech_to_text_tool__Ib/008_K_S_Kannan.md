Dear Dr. BVKS,

I thought I was giving helpful hints.  

They were plain suggestions.

  

It is easier, I guess, to make simple corrections than  

strive to defend inapt usages with inept acrobatics.

Sophistication is any day better than sophistry.  

This way you can save your energy for deeper ideas, or smarter presentations at least.

"Strain the oil, not strain the engine", as they say.  

  

Hope I am not mistaken.
