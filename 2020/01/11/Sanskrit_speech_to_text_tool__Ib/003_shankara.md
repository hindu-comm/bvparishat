Namaste,

  

There are several voice to text apps for Indian languages for use in android phones. I tried a speech to text app for Malayalam language and it worked well with Sanskrit slokas from the Bhagavad Gita. The text output was more or less free from errors.

So, it seems the technology is already there and that there is no need to start developing a software from scratch.

shankara
