Namaste Prof. KSK



1. Thanks for the helpful hints and plain suggestions. Typo occurred , it did. Went off by oversight. Correction pointed out accepted gracefully .



2. The details on 'maize-maze' was elaborated for those who might have missed the subtle suggestion covered in the 'apparent typo'. Not a fig leaf cover argument.



3. Just laugh for a moment Don't we both come from a language tradition where one letter more or less, one break or the other for a given word has made three streamed philosophies from one set of texts !
and endless arguments for millennia.



 Sometimes difficult to suppress a tendency to justify even a genuine typo ! Laugh and Leave it . English is not samskruth ! E-mail is not shaastraartha. Nothing to mistake. Alert readers and critics keep the writer on the toe.





Anyway, Thanks





Regards

BVK Sastry
