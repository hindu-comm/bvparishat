Namaste Prof. KSK

  

1\. Thanks for noticing the mail and pointing out needful corrections on ‘ pathaH’ oversight.

  

2. On the maize part: true, for the first reading, the expectation is to suggest corrected spelling as ‘ maze’. ; even that meaning holds ( phonetic word proximity).

  

The use of maize in the context below had a hidden pointer and pun !

Maize isa Central American cereal plant that yields large grains set in rows on a cob; corn. Maize is a commercial crop.

  

With this given meaning, read my statement\< But path to peak is a maize! \> . With this,  My statement would read \< But path to peak is a Central American (cereal) plant that yields large grains set in rows on a cob; ( useful for pop- corn)  = maize! If you bring in the pop-corn / coke culture along with the design architecture of rows on a cob, used for final solutions, you will understand the pointers in my mail. Once maize is fried to become pop-corn, the live essence of the seed is killed.

  

Rest i am sure your imagination can figure out. You can see the maize-maze challenge in the link: 

<https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/time-to-rethink-corn/> ( some snippets at the end of mail:: trigger for thinking beyond corn-maize-maze).

  

If Speech to Text/ Text to speech ( for non- english like languages: especially for Samskruth) was an ‘ already accomplished thing in technology , as indian consumers are mesmerized and made to believe / repeat almost hypnotically, hysterically, the global corporates in technology would not keep this goal as a target for 2030, to be accomplished.

  

These are technology - for language issues , falling out of scope on this forum, by a conscious concurrence and self accepted frame; so i do not want to elaborate further. Prof. Bijoy Misra can say more on technology modeling and understanding of phonemes and neuroscience needed and being pursued to deliver the aimed solutions.

  

I am always available for off line interaction to highlight the intricate issues of national and corporate interests , samskruth community interests safeguarding, significance beyond technology override on language ( in this case Paninian language) ; and argue out my case on why this discussion can not go on public forum. The best and surest business strategic way to kill a targeted language with all good interest - intentions ( pashu-maarana to send it to swarga/ sad-gati)

Is to make ‘ free availability’ ( of technology tools to cage the language) and then control the ‘ freedom to access’.

It takes sharper eyes to see what is hiding behind the ‘ free , open-source development’ models.

  

Any way, irrespective of how you look at my perspective on technology developments related to Sanskrit, Thanks for helping me to articulate this concern.

  

I look forward for help from concerned people like you who know Samskruth and have exposure to III-T tech research environment.

  

Regards

More about Maize ( Corn):

How**has corn had a positive impact on the US**?**Corn has had a positive impact on the US**because it is used to feed animals and humans. It is also sold to make money. Lattitude and shape of North America matters because we have great soil to grow crops  

  

In short, the corn*crop*is highly productive, but the corn*system*is aligned to feed cars and animals instead of feeding people  

  

**The corn system operates at a big cost to taxpayers.**Finally, the corn system receives more subsides from the U.S. government than any other crop, including direct payments, crop insurance payments and mandates to produce ethanol. In all, U.S. crop subsidies to corn totaled roughly $90 billion between 1995 and 2010—not including ethanol subsidies and mandates, which helped drive up the price of corn.

**Bottom line: We need a new approach to corn.**
