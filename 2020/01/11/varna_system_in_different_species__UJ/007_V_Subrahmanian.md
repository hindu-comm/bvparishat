Here is a quote from the site:<https://www.prekshaa.in/tradition-kshaatra-india-%E2%80%93-awareness-kshaatra-yajurveda>

  

  

In the Yajurveda, we see manifestly the greatness accorded to the essence of*kshaatra*. An important representative of the essence of*kshaatra*is the*ashvamedha yajna*. The Taittiriya Samhita says ‘यजुर्वेदं क्षत्रियस्याहुर्योनिम्’ (3.12.1.2) suggesting that the Yajurveda is the origin of the*kshatriya*s. In our Vedas, the ऋक् has been associated with*brahmana*s, यजुस् with*kshatriya*s, and सामन् with*vaishya*s \[there are other viewstoo; for example, Taittiriya Brahmana 3.12.9.2 says that*brahman*created the three*varna*s from the three Vedas –*vaishya*s from Rigveda,*kshatriya*s from Yajurveda, and*brahmana*s from Samaveda.) The Yajurveda has been called an action-oriented, ritual-intensive Veda; Rigveda is more aligned to prayer, Samaveda is aligned to worship, and Atharva Veda forms a bridge between the physical and the spiritual.
