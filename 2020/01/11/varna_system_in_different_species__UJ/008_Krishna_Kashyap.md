some more references to indicate srutis / ragas to brahmana kshatriavaishya sudra are given below: I have limited information about the sources. Those who know how to read Kannada can understand. Details of these and sources can be obtained by texts like sangeeta ratnakara or sharada tilaka etc.

  

What I understand is that: Music can transform and affect one's spiritual state. These classification of svaras etc. are made in relation to the moods it can create in a person.

the moods towards moksha may be considered brahmana. moods towards carnal pleasures, anger, hatred etc. can be related to other classifications.

  

> It is said one who knows music well is closer to attaining moksha.. > see some statements regarding these below. Origination of svaras are > related to which vedas, it came from.It is almost obvious to people > that music affects the mood of a person.

Similarly studies in ayurveda and yoga have shown that music tones can provide satva rajas and tamo gunas. Studies of ragas and their effect on kapha vata pitta in ayurveda have been done.

See the classification of brahmana, kshatria, vaishya sudrapertaining to number of srutis below: I dontunderstand music well. Hence I dont know the details.
