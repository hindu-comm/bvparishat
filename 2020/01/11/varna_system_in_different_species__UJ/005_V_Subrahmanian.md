Should the Purana-s and Itihasa-s be left behind? I think these too, at least the Puranas, have the sattva, rajas, tamas, classification. Even the human four-fold classification is based on the three gunas and their combinations. So, the gunas must be the basis for extending the brahmanaadi classification to other objects. There is this shloka of the Bhagavadgita:

  

न तदस्ति पृथिव्यां वा दिवि देवेषु वा पुनः । सत्त्वं प्रकृतिजैर्मुक्तंयदेभिः स्यात्त्रिभिर्गुणैः ॥ ४० ॥ 18.40

  

There is nothing in the three worlds (that is, in the entire creation), that is bereft of the three gunas. chara and achara, jaDa and chetana, all come in this.
