Dear Mr. Roy,



First of all I would slightly correct my second statement as “Ch 8 verse 14 and 15 clarifies that there are polar coordinates.” instead of “They are”.



This statement was in relation to what is specified in the Conclusion section of your paper that sounded as if there is no polar co-ordinate in Surya Siddhanta.



Coming back to the two statements:



1.  Of course it’s your take if you wish to consider it as “Junction”
    but what’s this junction for? Ch 8 specifies the Bhogas of prominent
    stars within a nakshatra. So obviously these stars are not junction
    stars deciding the boundaries of any nakshatra. So junction of what? 2.  When I started studying this chapter 8 long back even I had a
    thought that maybe the coordinates are celestial (ecliptic) since
    though the commentators specify that only Aksha Drkkarma needs to be
    done for stars in verse 14, the Sanskrit text does not specifically
    mentions “AKSHA”. It’s just “Drkkarma” that is mentioned there.

But then the words “Dhruvaka” and “Vikshepa” suggest that they are polar longitudes and polar latitudes. The word “Dhruvaka” does not need any claification as Dhruv is North Pole. “Vikshepa” of course may create doubts. But the fact is that the word “Vikshepa” is used in relation to polar latitude only. You’ve mentioned three verses 2.6, 2.63 and 7.7 in your paper. Let me take each verse one by one.

Verse 2.6 and Verse 2.63 – the deviation is from declination.



It’s obvious that this deviation has to be polar latitude since the reference is the declination.



Verse 7.7 – In fact Vikshepa is used from verse 7.7 to 7.12. Now these verses are explaining the crude method of converting celestial ecliptic to polar coordinates and reason the Vikshepa has to be referred. In initial verses of ch7 when the planets’ conjunction is known by the celestial longitude same is translated to polar in subsequent verses for observation purpose.



Similarly Verse 14 and 15 in ch 8 is about drkkarma that includes converting celestial to polar for planets and which proves that polar coordinates were used then.



By the way you made me revisit Surya Siddhanta after nearly two years since I released my book “Taming the Untamed”. In fact I even read my book yesterday after a long gap. So in a way thanks for that.
