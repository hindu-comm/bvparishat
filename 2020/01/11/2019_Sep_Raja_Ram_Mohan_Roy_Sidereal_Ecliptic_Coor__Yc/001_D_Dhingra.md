Dear Mr. Megh,

  

There are two major drawbacks in this paper:

  

1\. Yogtara as a junction star is misconception. Read my article "Yogtara is not a juction star" at<http://gotodev.com/astro/article18.html>

  

Moreover the nakshatra boundaries are defined in the early chapters of Surya Siddhanta itself.

  

2\. It's not Burgess's wish that he considered stars' coordinates in ch 8 as polar coordinates. Polar coordinates are integral part of Surya Siddhanta. Ch 8 verse 14 and 15 clarifies that they are polar coordinates.

  

Sending a separate copy to Shri Roy as well. You may also forward my reply to him if you wish.

  

best regds
