Dear Bijoy Ji,

  

  I accept your "milkmaids of Gukula," and reduce it to "milkmaids" as the context of Gokula is evident throughout my Krishna verses. A translation can go only so far, but I do not agree with retaining untranslated Sanskrit words in an English translation. They may mean something to an Indian reader of English, but there is a wider readership beyond that audience to whole Sanskrit words do not communicate anything. I appreciate your concerns and your efforts to find a balance. With best regards,
