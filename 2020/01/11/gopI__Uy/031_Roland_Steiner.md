Dear Mr. Karve,  
  
I am sure you are aware that there are also purely oral traditions in  
other cultures and language communities, whatever conclusions may be  
drawn from this.  
  
  
\> as he \[the modern man\] is least interested in the form and structure  

\> of a language being only interested in its content.  
  

This is not applicable at least to linguists.
