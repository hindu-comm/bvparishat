People do come, but people must spend time in studies.

A lot of hand-waving appear by reading newspaper reports or  

religious discourses Missionaries and our local gurus

are busy in business. "God said" etc.

Sometimes hand-waving comes through academic garbs

by citing history. (Galileo paradox)  

I appreciate and admire your interest.

  

We have been too busy in BVP this morning. Let us get back to work.
