We had twelve attendees. Bela made a great effort in surveying the neurology literature.

A middle school teacher came and had questions about language learning.
Other questions

were on intentionality, decision system, inhibitory functions and brain development.  

Our focus is on word creation. We distinguish between human signature and human behavior.

Weather got unusually warm to support the seminar!  

I will post the slides after some corrections by Bela. They would be educational, but technical.  

The next seminar will be on "Neuro-anatomy of Cognition" by Mr. Prem Nagar on Feb 8.
