Sabdakalpadrumah Book II page 359

would interpret गोपी as व्रजवाला

It lists the names.

  

Early quick translation recorded in MW and others do  

need revision being viewed from the scriptural context.

Early translation was done for the missionaries to create  

a broad understanding compromising accuracy.. English  

is much weak [compared.to](http://compared.to) Sanskrit. It is said that the

translation and the dictionary was created for the western

audience than for use in India. I would advocate to leave  

the words as such or make a full contextual translation.

  

I see this massively in Ramayana work, which I study.

  

Sorry for this observation.
