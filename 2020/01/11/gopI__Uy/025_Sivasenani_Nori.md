Well, from the point of view of grammar, yes, what you described is the role played by the Mahesvara sutras. Also Panini uses abbreviations like ku, pu which are not found in Mahesvara Sutras. That said, the Mahesvara Sutras have been interpreted philosophically by Nandinatha in his Nandikesvara Kasika.
