Dear Vidwans,

  

Can the protocols for preserving knowledge and transferring it from one generation to the next orally and in writing be the same?

  

To transfer knowledge from one generation to the next through an oral tradition a strict phonetic encoding is necessary. This is the purpose of the Maheshwar Sutras. Therefore to treat the Maheshwar Sutras merely as an arrangement of sounds to serve the purpose of the Ashtadhyayi is lopsided. We cannot forget that the oral tradition needed to fit knowledge in chanda or poetic form before it could be protected.

  

It is therefore wrong to impose the protocols of languages which preserve knowledge through the written word on those that preserved it orally.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
