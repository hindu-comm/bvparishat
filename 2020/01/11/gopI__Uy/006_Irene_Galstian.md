The problem of 'object label' vs ' meaning in context' is a bane in any language. This is why the time of dictionaries in the ordinary sense of the word is rapidly ticking away. It's well to recognise that the emphasis in upcoming years and decades should shift to corpus linguistics and parallel corpora, not mere dictionary lookups. And so, it's important to collect into such corpora translations made by scholars who knew both the source and the target languages well. This will also assist in translating to and from Sanskrit, at least in cases where translation is a appropriate way of interacting with the text.
