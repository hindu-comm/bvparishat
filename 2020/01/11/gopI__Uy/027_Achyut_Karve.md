Dear Roland,

  

  

"If you or others see more than a language in Sanskrit, you are free to do so. But then you leave the ground of historical scholarship, which is perfectly legitimate. It is just something different than historical research."

  

I teach Tabla to students. We do not need a paper and pen or pencil to teach. The tradition is totally oral. What part of a tradition you inherit is oral which will be passed on to the next generation orally?
It is this aspect that is unique to Sanskrit which no other language in the world has. I doubt whether there is any one inthe west who has put to memory the Vedas and who is qualified enough to pass it on to the next generation in toto. This has been happening in India since time immemorial. Does there exist any parallel to this in world history?

  

It is for this reason that history proper starts with a writing tradition in the western world as it has no oral tradition.

  

It matters very little whether you accept or do not accept the uniqueness of Sanskrit as a language. Historical scholarship is not necessarily western.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
