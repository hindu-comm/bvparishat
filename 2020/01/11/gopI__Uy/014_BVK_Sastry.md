Namaste Roland Steiner



I need your help to understand the statement \< Linguistically, Sanskrit is a language like any other \> An argument which is put forth very commonly and almost accepted as 'axiomatic (Scriptural/ god given/ unquestionable / ? heresy to question issue. Especially in Sanskrit Language study circles.



This question was asked to me in my classes about two decades ago ( and continues to be asked even now) in different ways :How is sanskrit difficult from English German, Aramaic, Hebrew,.... even Prakruth's.
Honestly, I have not been able to figure out a satisfactory answer to justify this position and explain why and how the traditional model of ' Paninian Language', the language of 'Vedas, as presented in tradition, as a language of yoga and vision' can fit in to a social-historical model of language evolution, that too anchored to the Tower of Babel narrative used as a basis for World languages classification and branching.



I do understand the arguments of : Big Bang, human evolution, migrations, Aryan languages, Proto models et al; I also understand the relativity of poorve/ nootana Rushi, ..... . I also understand the 'language difference across several class of 'Vedic resources' for which stratification of language by historicity and migration is not the
Hobson's choice explanation . These optional models were placed before great minds like Tilak, Kane, and many others. The answers provided, the compromised solutions to fit in ancient tradition to new set of questions (and models/ evidence ) seem to have worked like a ' temporary patch'. The issue is unresolved. The issues now seem to have become 'a final settlement' debate like the issue that was taken by the two armies on the kurukshetra battle field.



 ***All the models so far provided ( seems to have originated from Colonial period/ around) carry one Unique Universal Common Point ( some call it an agenda; and i do not subscribe to that point of view) :*** That is ' Discrediting the traditional stand held by ALL Traditional Schools ( including Buddhist and Jain) that 'Samskrutham (Brahmi in Jain case / Buddhism has a special term for this: is it divya-bhashaa ? I do not recall ): The language of sacred discourse and Vision, stays way beyond the land-locked bounds of society, race, historic geo-local frameworks', as the masters of each sampradaya held and propagated. It does not matter if this is discredited as 'faith';
but the historic texts were built around this premise; and it cannot be taken out in the name of academic research/ freedom and science evidence to discredit a living tradition and culture. At best, we can say, our generation sees tradition like this ! and trashes it as 'evidence lacking' !



***The riddle that arises out of this situation for Samskruth Studies and Research is*** : How should one propose to study and research in Samskrutham? How did the Panini period people understood the language model? An issue which will not get resolved by 'Historic dating of Language or text; constructing the 'Noun words as Verbs or other wise to wriggle out of tight corners'. Those who are in to deep grammar research know what this means as implication to each and every school of Darshana ! The clarification to be resolved are 'articulated doubts' like:



 Was Panini -Patanjali- Yaska confused about the pedagogic model of Language of text for which they wrote grammar ? ?

( The nullifying arguments for this come from a list of stray references amidst the 99% highly technically articulate logical explanation of word-structures? and backed by 'doubt')

By what pedagogic model did tradition sustain its teachings for about three plus millennia? Fooling people? Truth seeking? Why?How? Opposing each other using common language-tools ?

 What are the costs of failure, deviation, compromise or compliance ? in deviations adapted ? For the research, the community, the culture, the Truth ? the Pride?

Research to go by what historicity? Historicity defined by whom ? 

What to trust and rely upon : Discredited -Disbelieved continuity of traditional 'lacking evidence' OR ' inadequately constructed and extrapolated Science inference ?



The traditional schools hold Samskrutham to be 'Veda-Bhashaa'. And axiomatically hold 'Vedas are Time- space- Transcendent (युगान्ते - अन्तरिहितान् -वेदान्....) by Yuga scale; Where Yuga is defined by Gita 8-17 (sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmano viduh ratrim yuga-sahasrantam te 'ho-ratra-vido janah ; सहस्रयुगपर्यन्तमहर्यद्ब्रह्मणो विदुः । रात्रिं युगसहस्रान्तां तेऽहोरात्रविदो जनाः ॥). This is a stand used by almost all traditional texts. The human year equivalence numbers for Yuga , varying in different works of Dharma Shastra, Buddhism, Jainism are not the issue. The pedagogic model is the issue of contention and 'Doubt'.



The Post Colonial/ Oriental/ Semi-Traditional schools hold their view on Sanskrit genealogy by (a) Carbon dating of archeological evidence (b) Astronomical data reconstruction using software's and sky-maps (c) Global Comparative study of civilizations, anthropology, Preferred theological anchors for narrative of cultural identity discourse (d) Community belief systems (e) Genetics of Language : <https://www.technologyreview.com/s/409215/the-genetics-of-language/> ; <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-01837-7> - Human ancestry correlates with language and reveals that race is not an objective genomic classifier ( Baker, J.L., Rotimi, C.N. & Shriner, D. Human ancestry correlates with language and reveals that race is not an objective genomic classifier. Sci Rep 7, 1572 (2017) doi:10.1038/s41598-017-01837-7- Published - 08 May 2017 - DOI; <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-01837-7> )



So the lines of references and action perspective to build a research hypothesis is clearly laid out. Lexicons are a small yet critical part to be debated here. The errors of lexicographer, the scan document accuracy, the reconstructed image reading for text construction are fringe issues , which like package are essential. Damage to package could be an indicator to damage for the content in the package. For Samskruth, the reference to test this is 'Panini-Patanjali-Yaska' unified position: (



Lexicons are supposed to be helpful tools for language-document understanding. Samskruth tradition did provide Vyakarana and Nirukta as a combined unit and complemented discipline. The ' Nirukta domain and Kosha' domain was not confused by any traditional samskruth lexicographer; least of all by Amarasimha; and at least till advent of colonial models of lexicons which replaced Nirukta by different semantic pedagogy. This violation of mixing 'Vedic and Bhashaa' vocabulary in a common lexicon base was pioneered by Monier Williams with all good intentions to facilitate Sanskrit studies ; but it has come with a serious price to pay. Has any effort been made to address this issue ? An issue which i had raised on this forum almost a decade ago ?



A good researcher needs a good lexicon ALNG WITH a RIGHT PEDAGOGIC MODEL OF Language of TEXT undertaken for RESEARCH STUDY TRANSALTION. I do not have to explain the consequences of researcher failing to apply this criterion to the tools used for TEXT-LANGUAGE-CONTEXT analysis. . The rule base pointers being : (दुष्टः शब्दः , मिथ्या प्रयुक्तः न तमर्थमाह ; यदधीतम् अविज्ञातम् निगग्देनैव शब्द्यते...) . Technically called as ' Vedangataa' of these disciplines. A tradition that seems to have vibrant from Panini to Bhartruhari in Samskruth studies; kept alve in literatre study till Jaganantha of Rasagangadhara ( even during the moghul regime). 



I agree that there have been great historical lapses on the home team side and many blunders of himalayan magnitude in history in safeguarding the Voice Tradition of Text/s, the manuscript, the 'man' who was supposed to be the grooming guardian of the text and traditions'. This makes the challenge of researcher greater. It does not give a lee way for alien model substitutions and use of inappropriate pedagogy. The situation is still not that hopeless to be dropped off as ' irreparable, beyond damage, irrecoverable'. There is a greater need to seek rectification and see how the ancient tradition is useful for our period and globally. There is a need to take a course correction action.



Your help to clarify this situation for Sanskrit would be helpful. ( and it would also serve the needs of answering the sacred language of the texts of buddhism in Tibetology).

Thanks in advance for the help.
