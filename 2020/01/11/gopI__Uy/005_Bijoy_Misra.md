Dear Roland,  

"missionaries" is a hyperbole, but the question is audience.

Unlike English, a Sanskrit word is not an object label.

It has a meaning in context. So the equivalence concept

or giving a dozen different meanings have little sense.

There is a fundamental error. The unfortunate part is that

the material proliferates in India because ease of access  

and convenience. The "scholars" should make a "brake" to

it. Serious westerners may help.
