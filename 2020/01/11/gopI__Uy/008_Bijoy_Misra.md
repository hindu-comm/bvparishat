The reason I used "missionaries" in an earlier mail because I do see the urge of the Jesuits to create

quick translation of the Bible in order to "enter" the "market". In have not studied the engineering fully.

Lately I see the Committee translations on Ramayana from Columbia and I can see how unfortunate  

they are. Brain is rather slow in comprehension of unfamiliar concepts. "black hole" is a good example.
