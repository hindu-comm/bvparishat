Dear Vidwans,

  

The question that needs to be asked is what aspects of language do other languages not share with Sanskrit.

  

The answer to thisquestion is simple and straightfoward. They do not share the Maheshwar Sutras.

  

The Maheshwar Sutras are important because they describe the unique nature of Vedic and Laukik phonation. It is this uniqueness that has been lost on account of leniency granted by succeeding grammarians to usages.

  

I am making this assertion on the basis of my study of the tradition of the Tabla which too speaks. It speaks the tongue of laya and taala which is important for communication between the speaker and the listener.

  

Though all languages share a common purpose is the manner in which they achieve this goal not important?



Does the fruit of action not depend on the manner in which an action is executed?

  

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
