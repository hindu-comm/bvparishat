Mr. BVK Sastry,

  
  
\> I need your help to understand the statement \< Linguistically, Sanskrit is a language like any other \>  
  

Sanskrit is a language. What makes Sanskrit a language, it shares with all other languages, otherwise one could not designate Sanskrit as a language. At the same time, **each** language is unique in different ways and in different respects. These are simple statements that probably almost everyone will agree with.  
  
If you or others see more than a language in Sanskrit, you are free to do so. But then you leave the ground of historical scholarship, which is perfectly legitimate. It is just something different than historical research.  
  
Apart from that, your very long e-mail, in which you raise many questions and often answer them yourself, shows me that you are not really interested in answers that could be discussed. That too is perfectly fine, albeit a waste of time, at least for me.  
  
Best,  
Roland Steiner
