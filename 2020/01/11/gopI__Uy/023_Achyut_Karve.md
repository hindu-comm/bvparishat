Dear Vidwans,

  

Why did man feel the need to write? 

  

What happens when something is brought down on paper?

  

Is a carcass as good as a living animal?

  

Now-a-days with growing sanctity for written material has the soul in a verbal communication not been lost?

  

Or is it that the modern man no more has a soul?

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
