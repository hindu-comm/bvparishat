Even through constant repetition, an incorrect statement does not  
become correct. The Sanskrit-English dictionary by Monier-Williams  
(MW) is based on the two Petersburg dictionaries (Sanskrit-German) of  
Böhtlingk/Roth ("large Petersburg Dictionary") and Böhtlingk ("small  
Petersburg dictionary"), each in seven volumes. It can also be said  
that MW is (not only, but) largely a partially rearranged, in general  
remarkably reliable translation of these two Sanskrit-German  
dictionaries. To put it briefly: The two Sanskrit-German dictionaries  
were neither written for "missionaries" nor are they content with "a  
broad understanding compromising accuracy". On the contrary, they  
strive for the greatest possible precision and work directly from the  
Sanskrit texts (published and unpublished at the time, each with  
exact, verifiable references).  
  
With best regars,
