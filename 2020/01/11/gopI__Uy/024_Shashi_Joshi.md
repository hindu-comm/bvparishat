Achyut ji,

My message was purely fact based.

  

Maheshwar sutra doesn't define sanskrit grammar or language, it arranges the sounds in a particular sequence to enable Panini use mnemonics and minimize the sutra lengths.

  

Please correct me if this is incorrect.

In no way do I intend to trivialize anything or anyone.  
  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
