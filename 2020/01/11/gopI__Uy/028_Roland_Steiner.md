Dear Mr Karve,  

  
  
\> the uniqueness of Sanskrit as a language  
  

In one of the previous e-mails I had already written: "Each language  
is unique \[...\]."  

  
  
\> Historical scholarship is not necessarily western.  
  

I did not say that historical research is "necessarily Western".  
Historical research is necessarily historical, no matter who does it.  
One can be interested in it but does not have to be.
