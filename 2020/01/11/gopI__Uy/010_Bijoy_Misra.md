Dear Irene,

The seminar is open to all except nothing profound may come immediately.

We are not video-taping, but we will distribute notes.  

The literature is full with therapy and drugs. Our goal is to check the neurology  

of thoughts and how a thought creates visualization and maps in brain.  

I appreciate your support and encouragement.

Best regards,

BM
