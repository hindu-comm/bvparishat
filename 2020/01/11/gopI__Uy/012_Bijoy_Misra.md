Dear Roland,

You are wrong in your many assertions in the mail.

You need to live in India for a long time in your early life to appreciate the use of native language words.

Communication is different than speech.  

Please do take a scientific view than the approach of arbitrary generalization. Please examine words than understanding them!  

I won't go further.

BM
