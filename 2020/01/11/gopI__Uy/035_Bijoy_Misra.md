The research in the field has been in the area of teaching English to the world.

It is all behavioral training, like living objects being taught to imitate. Language

as a speech mechanism would be different. My friend's historical studies

would be cited, but they don't address the creation of speech. Most do not  

even know the elementary principle that the speech is not canned.

  

We may not solve the problem, but the seminars may manage to set up the issues.
