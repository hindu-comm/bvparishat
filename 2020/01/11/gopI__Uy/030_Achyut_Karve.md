Dear Roland,

  

The uniqueness of the oral tradition demanded a unique protocol which is enshrined in the Maheshwar Sutras and the Ashtadhyayi. When words, sentences and complete works have to be orally transmitted we of the day need to appreciate that the writer needs to memorize the preceeding composition as he composes the subsequent ones.

This part of the effort is left to the paper and the pencil now-a-days.

  

Therefore the structure and form of Sanskrit too is unique though to a modern man it may appear common place as he is least interested in the form and structure of a language being only interested in its content.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
