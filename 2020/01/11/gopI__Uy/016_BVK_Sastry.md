Namaste

So what is the pointer ?

a) Move focus from ' Monier williams as Original Designer of 'English-Sanskrit Lexicon provider' to ' Monier Williams as more faithful Translator from German sources for Sanskrit ?

 - Apart from opinion, MW statement in the preface does not seem to lend support this position. MW had his Indian base of primary date providers. And he was aware of the design of the two samskruth lexicons of his period: Shabda kalpadruma/ Vachaspatyam and their evaluation by western/ German scholars.

b) Reg. Missionaries...: MW statement is clear enough for whom this lexicon effort was benefitting. Not only in MW Lexicon; but his other works which highlighted why missionaries should study

 Sanskrit as a prerequisite for their work in India.

c) Looking at the ' to put it briefly': do we have to surmise from the statements:  MW used to create a Missionary work useful new Lexicon from the two Sanskrit-German dictionaries,

 - which were neither written for "missionaries" nor are they content with "a broad understanding compromising accuracy"

 ***AND******/Which*** On the contrary,

 - they ( = German dictionaries) strive(d) for the greatest possible precision and work directly from the Sanskrit texts (published and unpublished at the time, each with exact, verifiable references).

What is the preferred intent pl.?

Regards

Even through constant repetition, an incorrect statement does not
become correct. **The Sanskrit-English dictionary by Monier-Williams
(MW) is based on the two Petersburg dictionaries (Sanskrit-German) of****** **Böhtlingk/Roth ("large Petersburg Dictionary") and Böhtlingk ("small****** **Petersburg dictionary"), each in seven volumes**.

t can also be said that MW is (not only, but) largely a partially rearranged, in general remarkably reliable translation of these two Sanskrit-German dictionaries.

***To put it briefly***: The two Sanskrit-German dictionaries were neither written for "missionaries" nor are they content with "a broad understanding compromising accuracy". On the contrary, they strive for the greatest possible precision and work directly from the Sanskrit texts (published and unpublished at the time, each with exact, verifiable references).

With best regards,
