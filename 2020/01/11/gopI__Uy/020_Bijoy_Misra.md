Spilling opinions as "knowledge" should not be a goal of this forum.

There are many self-proclaimed Sanskritists who have read some grammar and a few books.

They hardly know the elements of the language. A language student does not need a word dictionary!

  

I might have said before, somebody did volunteer to teach me Odia because he had a dictionary!

Can humility be taught!
