Dr. Misra,

  
  
\> Unlike English, a Sanskrit word is not an object label. It has a meaning in context.  
  

Linguistically, Sanskrit is a language like any other. Put very simply, in any language (including English) a word gets its concrete meaning in a specific context, which of course does not mean that a word can have **any** meaning in a given context. Monolingual and bilingual dictionaries (beginning with the Amarakośa up to the Śabdakalpadruma and the Pune Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Sanskrit) are no more, but also no less than indispensable **tools** for a most accurate understanding of non-contemporary texts. Particularly useful for this purpose are dictionaries and special glossaries which not only give meanings, but also provide textual references so that the actual use of a word in a specific meaning can be studied in the context of a particular text, its genre, time, region, etc. A student of Indology, in the course of his studies, must first learn to use such tools as the Petersburg dictionaries in the right way in order to do something like "corpus linguistics" (Irene Galstian). It is a naive assumption that a professional Indologist searching for the concrete meaning of a certain word in a certain text does nothing else but look it up in a dictionary and pick out any meaning that somehow seems appropriate.  
  
With best regards,  
Roland Steiner
