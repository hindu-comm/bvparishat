Sharma ji,

  

Link to vol 2 of History of Indian Philosophy by Umesh Mishra. This scan is from DLI collection. Scan quality is not so good. But, it is readable.  

<https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Rpk9kk4QmYVsy2K3wRvGzN6JPFNvpJkL>

  

There is also the Hindi version containing both the parts in a single volume.

regards  
shankara
