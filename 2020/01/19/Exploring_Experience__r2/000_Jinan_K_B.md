As part of the Thanima conference, we are planning a three-part event calledEXPLORING E X P E R I E N C E on 6th 7th and 8th of March. Please come, and feel free to promote the event. See the details below.

  

SENSING       FEELING      KNOWING

  

‘Exploring experience’ is a three-part event being planned as along with the thanima conference ([www.thanima.co.in](http://www.thanima.co.in/))on March 67 8-2 pm to 5 pm.

  

The wisdom of the Adivasi communities (indigenous nonliterate cultures) is the first dialogue in which we will explore how Adivasis imbibe knowledge without seemingly making any effort. Is knowing the very nature of life.

  

A session to rethink how to reclaim ‘experience’ as the basis for education by critically exploring the foundation year of design & architecture educationin light of the latest developments in cognitive science.

The third dialogue will be on re-examining the role of aesthetics and our sense of beauty.

  

The reason why we are ‘exploring EXPERIENCE’ is because in the modern educational process the role of experience is being negated.Human beings are biologically equipped to CREATE knowledge of the real world, but present-day schooling turns them into analyzers of de-contextualized, distorted and miniaturized information. This produces mechanical human beings without having ability to sense, feel, and experience which disables the development of sensitivity, intuition, and sense of beauty.This kind of mechanical human being will be soon replaced by AI as in the realm of planned and mechanized world AI would outperform humans and there is a need to revisit how final qualities are developed consciously.

  
While there is a need to revisit what really is experience and how we come to know, etc. an understanding of experiential reality would help us in not only re-imagining the current education systemsbut also in focusing on how to re-create conducive spacefor children to evolve in tune with the natural process of knowing andbeing.
