Dear Shri Ramakrishnan,

  

  This was the so called PL480 project. In exchange for American wheat, India was paying in Rupees, and the US was trying to use those Rupees in multiple ways. One of the projects was sponsored by the Library of Congress to buy books and ship them free to 18 university libraries in the US. This project began in early 1960s and lasted till the US cancelled the amount owed by India some 25 years later. The University of Pennsylvania library was one of the recipientsof these books and one of my summer jobs was to open boxes of books coming from India. The University of Michigan was also a recipient of these books.
But I am talking of 1890s when the library of the University of Michigan was acquiring Sanskrit publications from Pune, Bombay, Benares, Calcutta and Madras. There was no PL480 back then. I was told that the US libraries have more Chinese books than in China and more Thai books than in Thailand. I know of an arrangement with the Government of Thailand to provide copies of Thai books to libraries in Thailand.
Unfortunately, the rise of IT jobs is creating a problem of survival for the humanities in the US as well. Many Republican law-makers are questioning the need to teach humanities, and some smaller universities are beginning to close departments of humanities. I don't know where all this will end up. The university libraries are also starved for funds, and are beginning to rely more and more on digital resources.
