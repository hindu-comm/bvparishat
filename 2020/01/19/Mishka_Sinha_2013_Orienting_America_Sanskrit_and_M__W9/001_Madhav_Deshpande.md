Dear Megh Ji,

  

  Thanks for providing a link to this very informative article on the unique historical and cultural American environment of the beginning and development of Sanskrit studies in the USA, and distinguishing it from the English and European traditions. I myself did my Ph.D. at the Department of Oriental Studies at the University of Pennsylvania which included the study of Sanskrit along with languages of the ancient Middle/Near East and Far East, while modern Indian languages were taught in a different department called South Asian Regional Languages. Some years after I completed my Ph.D., the department of Oriental Studies was broken up and Sanskrit was moved to the Department of South Asian Languages. While the American Oriental Society, which began in 1840s, is still continuing to function, much of the energy has shifted to the Association for Asian Studies, American Academy of Religion, Linguistic Society of America, and the annual meetings of the Round Table for South Asian Languages.

  Given the American perception of the world, there is a desire to know about all parts of the world. Some of this desire is reflected in the coverage of the world in American universities. The University of Michigan where I taught Sanskrit for 45 years teaches some 68 languages across the world, covering the wide geography of the world and from ancient languages like Greek, Latin, Assyrian, Sumerian, Egyptian Hieroglyphics, Avestan and Sanskrit to modern languages like African languages, languages of most of Europe, languages of Far East, Southeast Asia, South Asia and Middle/Near East. The university libraries acquire massive amounts of materials from across the world. This is not an entirely new thing. When I joined the University of Michigan in 1972, I went to the library looking for a book published in the AnandashramaSanskrit Series published in Pune in 1892. To my surprise, the library had acquired the book in 1893.

  Mishka Sinha'sarticle covers only the early period of American Sanskrit studies beginning with Whitney and Lanman. There are other sources that cover later contributions till recent times.
