Regarding the libraries’ acquisition of Indian literature. I don’t have the link any more, but some time last century the Americans struck a deal with the Indian government as a return for some help they gave India, India would in return provide many publications over a few decades. I believe that the University of Virginia was one of the recipients. When I lived in the DC area, I had a chance to access that library a number of times. They had all kinds of obscure magazines in regional languages. Another great resource is the New York public library.
