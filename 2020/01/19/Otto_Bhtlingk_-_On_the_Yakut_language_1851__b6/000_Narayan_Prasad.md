Dear Scholars,  
   Namaste.  
  
   M.B. Emeneau writes regarding Böhtlingk's "On the Yakut language" (in German) \[India and Linguistics, JAOS, Vol.75, p.150, col.1, para 2\]:  
  
"Otto Böhtlingk (1815-1904) was so much impressed by Pāṇinian method that he wrote the grammar of the Turkic Yakut language of Siberia, in which the working out of phonology, morphology, and syntax is detailed and complete in a very Pāṇini-like fashion, and which Edward Sapir used repeatedly to praise as a model of excellent method."  
  
I was very curious to see Böhtlingk's book. I have not had access to the original German edition. But I have got its Russian translation that appeared in 1990. In this edition I do not find any "working out of phonology, morphology, and syntax, detailed and complete in a very Pāṇini-like fashion". I have not had chance to see Edward Sapir's appreciation.  
  
Regards  
Narayan Prasad
