\<\< Thanks for this link.>\>  

  

You are welcome sir.

  

When I was writing the introductory part "Importance of Panini" for my article "Sarasvatikanthabharana - the magnum opus of Sanskrit grammar" in 1999, I quoted Emeneau's statement from JAOS, That time I did not have access to the book of Bohtlink (1851). But I was eager to have a look at it. Later I wrote to my Russian friend in 2007. He sent me its Russian translation. That time the printed copy was available on auction (price being something like 1200 dollars).

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
