The problem of freeing temples according to Subramanian swamy is complicated :

  

1\) It seems he wanted to free all temples, however, the Government told him "Ok we will free all temples", who will we hand over the temples to?

by the way Tirupati temple is one of the richest with millions of dollars in revenues per year.

  

The problem is Hindus are not united to take over the responsibility of temples.

There are standard methods established which can be followed. the WAQF board is a model for management of Mosques. The Sikh Gurdwara management is done in an excellent manner and rules are well laid out and it seems their management of gurdwaras are refined. Of course the people can come together and unite the 1000 factions of hindus into one Hindu Board.

  

*However, this is not the real problem. some people think that the Government does not have any real incentive to give up the millions of dollars of revenues these temples bring*. This was not mentioned by Subramanian swamy though he certainly knows.

  

It seems only less than 20% of the revenues go to upkeep and maintenance where as80% goes some whereno one knows or cares to know, because typically hindus are sincere and religious; They just pour the money into the collection boxes and expect to gain something as a gift from God. They dontquestion how money is used.  

  

Subramanian swamy talks about this just after 29 minutes in this video:
