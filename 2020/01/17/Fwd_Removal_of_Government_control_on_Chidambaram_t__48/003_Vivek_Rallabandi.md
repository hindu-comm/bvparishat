सर्वेभ्यो नमः ।

  

As this is my first post on the BV Parishad group, I would like to first offer my salutations to the scholars present in this group. My name is Vivek Rallabandi; I am a high school student in the United States and a Samskritam student and enthusiast.

  

The point made by Shri. Krishna Kashyap with regard to temple revenue being misdirected/misused is definitely a salient one. A prime example of this phenomenon is in the Ahobilam Narasimha Swamy temple in Kurnool District of Andhra Pradesh. I recently wrote an [article](https://swarajyamag.com/politics/hostile-takeover-the-andhra-pradesh-governments-misguided-attempt-to-control-the-ahobilam-temples-comes-to-light) about the situation at the temple for SwarajyaMag - the state government is trying to take control of the temple, which has a centuries-long historical connection with the Sri Ahobila Math. One of the main issues of concern with the government's takeover is the fact that the temple's money is being misused (under the guise of vague and misleading budgetary allocations), and it is unclear as to how it is actually being spent.

  

The phenomenon that is taking place at the Ahobilam temple is certainly not unique - this situation seems to be quite prevalent in many temples that are being controlled by the government. The Supreme Court's decision in the Chidambaram temple case was a victory for our temples and their preservation, but there is much more to be done. Ultimately, it is absolutely absurd that our temples, which are religious institutions, are controlled by a secular government. Our temples need to be removed from government control. There is currently a [case](https://www.hinduismtoday.com/blogs-news/hindu-press-international/supreme-court-to-hear-freedom-to-temples-plea-on-july-13/15098.html) (*Dayananda Saraswati v. State of Tamil Nadu,* W.P. 476/2012) pending before the Supreme Court that seeks to invalidate government control of temples, which I earnestly hope will result in a favorable decision.
