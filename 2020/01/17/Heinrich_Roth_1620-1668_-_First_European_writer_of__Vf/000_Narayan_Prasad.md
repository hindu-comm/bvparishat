Dear scholars,  
   Namaste.  
   In May 1998 I happened to read the brief biography of Father Heinrich Roth in "German Indologists" (1990). On p.1 it says:  
  --- QUOTE ---  
  Heinrich Roth ... was the first European author to write a grammar of the Sanskrit language. ... In Agra, Roth learnt Sanskrit and was able to discuss with Brahmins in the language. He realised the importance of Sanskrit and wrote a grammar between 1660-1662. The grammar is descriptive and shows great pedagogical skill - the explanations are given in Latin. The grammar is based on Panini. The grammar was later highly appreciated by Max Mueller."  
  --- UNQUOTE ---  
  
I was very curious to see this Sanskrit grammar written in Latin and to what extent Roth has followed Panini.

  
After having a look at it, it was quite clear that this grammar is not at all based on Panini. Actually it is completely based on सारस्वत व्याकरण composed by अनुभूतिस्वरूपाचार्य.  
I have not yet had chance to see Max Mueller's views on this grammar.
