Friends,

  

The genesis of the cognition studies came from my reading of Patanjali's yogasutra.

The claim is that the truth reveals itself to the inner प्रज्ञा. The question is if the truth

is always known, if so how does it get colored. When do we become ourselves versus

a human being or a living creature or an object in the universe. So we ask what we

process from our senses. We distinguish between the origin of speech versus the  

words we utter.  

We have to distinguish between object cognition and word cognition.
Words are artificial,

the object did not create its word. So what does the object convey and how do we  

process it is the question.  

Ours is a very preliminary work, though possibly first of its kind.

After neuro-circuitry discussing neurons and neurotransmitters we are going to the bulk

anatomy in our next seminar. We take a break in March and continue April and May.

In April we take up the western philosophical literature and in May we deal with the Indian

philosophical literature.

As I have expressed before, BVP forum has widened my understanding beyond my own

expectation. Unlike many of you, I did not do college studies in language or culture.

My Sanskrit studies were necessitated to handle religious events in the early immigrant

community and my India studies began after my daughter went to college in 1990.

I am immensely grateful to the Forum for the encouragement and to many colleagues and

learned scholars to have helped me in a thousand ways.

  

I will be in India in March in connection with the centenary events for my father.

I might be able to visit any Conf in India towards the end of March. i will watch

the postings.  

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
