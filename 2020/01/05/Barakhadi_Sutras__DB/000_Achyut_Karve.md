Dear Vidwans,

  

Please find at the following link a video of the Barakhadi Sutras being taught to Adavasi Students.

  

<https://studio.youtube.com/video/nQqIHrV3z6I/edit>  

  

Vidwans are requested to comment on its utility in teaching the script of Indian Languages to primary children. This is a recording when the Barakhadi Sutras were first recited for them.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve
