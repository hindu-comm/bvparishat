I now learn that old temple inscriptions like that on the walls of the Brihadeeswara temple are in varieties of Grantha script (in the case of Brihadeeswara temple, Pallava Grantha script.) Some older temple inscriptions might be even in Brahmi. Grantha and Brahmi scripts are capable of representing all the sounds of Sanskrit language. They also incorporate characters for Dravida sounds likeẓ, ṟ, ṉ, etc., and also the hrasva (short) e and o. My question is about Tamil language inscriptions. In Tamil language inscriptions, were Sanskrit word written in tatsama form since characters were available to do so? For example, how were words likeśiva, indra, brahma, bhīma written – as śivaṉ, indraṉ, brahmaṉ, bhīmaṉ or as civaṉ, intiraṉ, pirammaṉ, pīmaṉ etc.?
