Unlike Sanscrit, Tamil language has got its own script. Hence, while writing in Tamil, only Tamil pronunciation would be written using Tamil script. Why would Grantha or Brahmi script be used in between Tamil script to represent only the proper nouns that you have mentioned?  
  
Only to write Sanskrit texts Grantha or Brahmi scripts were used, but not to write Tamil text. This is my guess.
