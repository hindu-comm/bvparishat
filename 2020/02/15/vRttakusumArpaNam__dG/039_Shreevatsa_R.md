Thank you Amba ma'am.

To be clear I wasn't replying to your previous email but to the thread in general, as some references had been asked for / given.

You have explained it very clearly.

By the way I just found and read through your paper at<https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0703658> which was also informative, thank you.

  

Also I didn't mean the calculation of the number 2^n but the enumeration of all 2^n sequences (the prastaara on n syllables). It is interesting that the two oldest available commentators on Pingala have interpreted his sutras as applying more generally (and in different ways) than they were probably intended originally.
