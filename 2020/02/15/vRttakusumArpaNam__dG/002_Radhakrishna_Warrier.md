Nicely composed and sung. Though not related, this reminded me of a cryptic, yet mathematically beautiful sūtra (formula) that we were taught in high school Malayalam class. The formula is Yamātārājabhānasa which helps us remember the rules of all the gaṇas that vṛtta-s (meters) are composed of. For example to find the guru-laghu composition of the ‘ya’ gaṇa, take the three syllables from ‘ya’ which are ya mā and tā – a laghu, guru, guru combination.
