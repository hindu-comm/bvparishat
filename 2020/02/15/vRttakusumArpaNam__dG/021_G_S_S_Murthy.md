Thank you very much, Prof.Kannan for having ferreted out Parmanand Singh's Paper, which I had referred to while writing my Sanskrit article. Page 232 bottom para refers to a Pingala sutra "misrau ca". Unfortunately I am not able to find out from PDF version of Pingala where exactly this sutra occurs (Chapter and sutra No.). Prof. Ambaji may be able to locate.

Thanks and regards,  
Murthy
