1\. This is regarding the article referred by Dr.Megh on Fibonacci series. I believe the earliest referenceto what is called Fibonacci series is that of Virahanka who was in the 6th or 7th century AD. It looks like even Pingala refers to the series. But becauseof the brevity of the sutra it is not very clear. I wrote an article in Sanskrit on the subject. Getting an article published written in Sanskrit on such a subject is not easy. Finally it got published in a journal, "प्राच्यमञ्जूषा". I attach a copy.

2\. I have not come across the mnemonic in any of the popular Sanskrit works on Chandas. But it is invariably taught in local language classes, (Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Telugu). I do not know why it is so.

3\. Regarding प्रमाणिका referred by Prof.Kannan, yes, it is defined in Vruttaratnaakara. प्रमाणिका जरौ लगौ. But does not come under अनुष्टुप् category.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
