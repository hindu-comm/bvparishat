Yes, I am aware of both these articles of Jayant Shah and S R Sharma.

  

And both of them provide the same interpretation, as I mentioned earlier, viz. 'misrau ca' gives a procedure to get the prastaara of 'n' aksharas from that of the 'n-1' aksharas.

Or to be close to the suutras, I should say

The previous suutra says, there are two types of aksharas viz G and L.

And then the next suutra 'mistau ca' tells us that you can also mix them (the earlier G and L) with G and L.

This leads to 4 pairs of G and L.  

That is it, And then comes vasavastrika. That there are 8 triplets.

Now how do you get 8 triplets? By mixing the previous 4 pairs with G and L!

From this I generalised and said 'misrau ca' provides a procedure to get the prastaara of 'n' aksharas from that of the 'n-1' aksharas.

But this is not stated explicitly in the suutras.  

  

I'm not alluding to 2^n here. The latter suutras deal with an algorithm for calculating 2^n, which Prof Donald Knuth refers to in his book on algorithms for its efficiency.
