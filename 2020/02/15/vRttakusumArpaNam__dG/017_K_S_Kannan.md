Dear Megh,

  

The 1985 article that I provided the link to  

(=30 years prior to the one you gave the link to)  

goes to show that **to call them Fibonacci numbers is not proper**,

as they were known to Indian mathematicians much earlier.  

That is the implication of "the so called" in the title.

I hope you have not missed this idea.

  

See how the article begins:  

  

"What are generally referred to as the Fibonacci numbers and the method for their forma-  
tion were given by Virahanka (between A.D. 600 and X00), Gopala (prior to A.D. 1135) and  
Hemacandra (c. A.D. 1150) - all prior to L. Fibonacci (c. A.D. 1202). ..."
