Yes, precisely.

This sequence is called de Bruijn sequence.

  

\[In [combinatorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics "Combinatorics") [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), a **de Bruijn sequence** of order *n* on a size-*k* [alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_(computer_science) "Alphabet (computer science)") *A* is a [cyclic sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_sequence "Cyclic sequence") in which every possible length-*n* [string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)#Formal_theory "String (computer science)") on *A* occurs exactly once as a [substring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substring "Substring") (i.e., as a *contiguous* [subsequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence "Subsequence"))\]. ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_sequence))

  

There are only two distinct ways of writing a cyclic sequence of 3 on a size-2 alphabet (of 0 and 1). They are 01110100 and 10001011, and the first one corresponds to Yamātārājabhānasa (if laghu is mapped to 0 and guru to 1), and the other one is the negation of the first one.  

  

Best,

Amba
