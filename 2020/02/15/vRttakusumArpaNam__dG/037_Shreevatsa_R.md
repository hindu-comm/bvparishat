Namaste.

  

There is a nice exposition of some of these, with clear references to the primary sourcesand explanations thereof, in an article by Jayant Shah: <https://web.northeastern.edu/shah/papers/Pingala.pdf>

  

As for Piṅgala's "miśrau ca", it has been interpreted by a commentatorयादवप्रकाश (11th century according to the preface) as a rule that gives the Fibonacci numbers. Some screenshots and links I had earlier posted [here](https://twitter.com/svat/status/869082474298593280).

  

This may be controversial but personally I don't find it convincing thatPiṅgalawas referringto arbitrarily-longprastāra-s either of thevṛtta type (which gives the binary numbers 2^n) or of themātrā/jāti type (which gives the Fibonacci numbers F\_{n+1}); I think both of those are clever ideas/interpretations of the lattertradition (though before Fibonacci, as mentioned in this thread already) -- this is Alsdorf'sinterpretation too IIRC. Although this interpretation is more "trivial" than anything in the available commentaries, it seems to make sense. An English translation of Alsdorf's article by S. R. Sarma is available here:<https://srsarma.in/pdf/articles/1991_Pratyayas.pdf>
