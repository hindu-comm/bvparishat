विद्वद्भ्यः प्रणामाः ।

  

In a separate thread, a link to गर्भोपनिषद् was shared. One line caught my attention there - "सप्तमे मासे जीवेन संयुक्तो भवति" ।

Does this mean that the fetus, till the seventh month, does not have the जीवात्मा in it ? The medical science says that the heart starts to beat in the third week, and the observation is that the fetal movements can be sensed from 4th month. How does all this link together ?

  

Also, what I had read (Not necessary from reliable sources) is that the jeeva has to fall on earth via the rains, then goes to soil, then to grains, and then to the father's body who consumes these grains, and from there it finds the way to the womb. If this is to be believed, it would mean that the jeeva is right there during conception. And if that is the case, how does it resonate with the सप्तमे मासे point ?

  

I request scholars to kindly point me in the right direction. Thanks in advance for your time!
