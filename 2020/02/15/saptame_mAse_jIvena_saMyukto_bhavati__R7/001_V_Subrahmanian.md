I think "सप्तमे मासे जीवेन संयुक्तो भवति" could mean that the jiva starts having abhimana in the fetus as 'I'. Before that such abhimana did not exist. This is only my guess. It also requires to be seen that the Bhagavatam, etc. statements 'the jiva suffers pain, pricks, wallows in dirt, etc. in the womb and resolves to never come back to take a birth again once out. But Vishnu maayaa sees that it forgets that resolve once out.' When, at which month does this feeling of suffering, resolving, etc. take place?
