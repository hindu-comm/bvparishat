"Machine Translation is considered as integral part of natural language processing. The translation from one language to another has always been a challenging issue in terms of percentage of the sentences that can be translated and the rate of accuracy of translated sentences. Rule-based machine translation is a definitive approach toward machine translation. It helps to translate statements from one language (source) to other (target) language on the basis of the defined rules. The software tool ‘EtranS’ provides translation of English to Sanskrit language. It has so far reported more than ninety percent of accuracy. The accuracy obtained in translation is large because of mathematical approach of Sanskrit grammar. Since it is a formulized language; therefore, it has great potential to act as Interlingua. This explores the potential of Sanskrit language to act as Interlingua. A generic framework for multiple language translation is presented here. Sanskrit can act as Interlingua for many Indian as well as foreign languages. Sanskrit language is mother of eighty-five percent of Indian languages and its grammar has resemblance with foreign languages like German, Russian, etc. The ‘EtranS’ can be further extended in order to obtain multilingual translation.": [Source](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-0633-8_26)
