Namaste Amba ji



1. About E tran S : EtranS is a name of system. It does not seem to refer to a Program. See the information below from the link and Author's note ( Paper Attached). <https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ce5e/bade19a59628a6a9279abff304ba8afbd393.pdf>



 In this paper, we describe the functional aspect to English to
Sanskrit Machine Translator. The system developed, has been named EtranS. This paper also discusses the results obtained after testing the system on variety of sentences gathered from various sources.



2. If this system, as per claim , by the author - Dr. Promila Bahadur, Asst Professor, Affiliated to Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan ,
Lucknow India is developed since 2013 in India , what is the update on this ?
