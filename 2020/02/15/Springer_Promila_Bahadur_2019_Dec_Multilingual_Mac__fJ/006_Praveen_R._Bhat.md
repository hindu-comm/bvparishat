I was just thinking of a possibility of a skeleton for automating English to Sanskrit translation a couple of weeks back by a kind of look-up table with the vibhaktyarthas. This paper is an interesting solution which seems to have made rules for the same after categorising each English word nicely.

  

Here is what seems to be the free copy of the said paper:<https://thesai.org/Downloads/SpecialIssueNo4/Paper_7-EtranS-A_Complete_Framework_for_English_To_Sanskrit_Machine_Translation.pdf>
