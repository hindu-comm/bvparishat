Dear Dr. Dhaval,

  

We've thoroughly proofed again (with resp. sources), all the koshas posted at erstwhile sansknet.

  

Of these, the ones that you referred are as under-  

अनेकार्थनिघण्टुः (धनञ्जयनाममालाया मुपनिबद्धः)  
अनेकार्थनाममाला (धनञ्जयकवि विरचिता)  

And you can get for the scanned copy of धनञ्जयनाममाला easily on the web.

  

Regards,

knbrao
