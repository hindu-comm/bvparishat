Sir,

  I intend to publish some articles on Sanskrit Literature written in English Language in some Referred Journals recognised by U G C.

 I, therefore, humbly request you all to kindly give me an information in which Referred Journals the Articles may be published. Also kindly enlighten me how I shall send the Articles.

                                   
                   With regards,

  

                                   
                   Yours sincerely,

                                   
                 Ms. Sebanti Sinha.
