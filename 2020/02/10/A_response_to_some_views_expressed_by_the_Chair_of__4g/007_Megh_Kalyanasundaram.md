[Sanskritotsavaha: Reinstating the value of Sanskrit](https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/the-hindu-friday-review-telangana/article30819129.ece) (Report dated Feb 14, 2020)  

  

"Valmiki’s Ramayana was the text in focus in the next piece, where an extract brings to the fore a conversation between Narada and Valmiki, where the former describes all the physical attributes and significant facets that contribute to the magnificence of Rama. Performed by Vamsi Madhavi and Ajeissh Menon, the decision to divide the piece between its word-to-word meaning (in the sloka) and the event in Rama’s life that brings forth a particular quality, added to its appeal."
