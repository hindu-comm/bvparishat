Namaste Subodh Bhat 



You have started with the assertive definition and statement \< **Vedas are 'kootastha-nitya'** \> .



Good that you have taken courage to voice out one of the views held strongly by the traditional schools, in relation to the
veda-analytics that has progressed in the lanes of 'Veda- Nityatva, Apaurusheyatva, Anaaditva, Vedokhilam Dharma-Moolam, itihasa-puranaabhyaam vedatham samupabrumhayet, Bharath panchamo vedah, vedah praachetasaad aaseet saakshaat raamaayanaatmanaa... et al' . 



Before going for further analysis of your primary statement \< **Vedas are 'kootastha-nitya'** > and its implications as \< **Anupoorvi do not change very Yuga** \> , the primary statement has to be established prima facie, as acceptable to both sides providing the discourse and engaging in the dialogue. More so when it relates to 'Vedanta ( Shaareeraka Meemaamsaa, including Karma- Yoga- Upaasanaa Kaandas) as the Meaning- Purpose - Command from Vedas. 





***Why am I seeking this clarity at BVP ?*** The crux of BVP thinking seems to carry a mixed view on this ' modeling Vedas and Language of Veda's. The clarification may help many researchers to understand the History and Culture of Bharath that has been shaped and guided by Vedic resources, especially Ramayana and Mahabharata; more so by Gita (for Philsophy) and Puranas ( for Faith-Culture- Religion). The thread binding all these texts and traditions is Samskrutham. Any misgivings on the Vedas and Language of Vedas will affect the proper understanding of ' Bharath' aka ' India/ Hindu-stan'. 



 The schools desiring to defend the primary position as stated by you on vedas need to establish , defend and argue out every alternative running through in ' otherwise modes' under the shades of interpreting / collating/ researching / translating/ propagating 'Vedas' as land-people-historicity, the collection of 'Vedas' as present now to be treated as - " historical textual compilations and alterations, especially with panegyrics,
interpolations" "a long chain of successive syntheses of divergent texts", "conflating bards narratives of discrepant accounts of local incidents" "the colossal idea of converting the popular Epic of the Bhāratas into the Encyclopaedia Brahmanica" to benefit a ritual oriented community ! For this, it is critical to establish the Language Model of Vedic text and its related narratives, totally known as 'Samskrutham: The language regulated by Paninian ( and other grammars in Vedanga Vyakarana tradition). This effort is also a way to satisfactorily respond to the issues raised by Dr. B.R.Ambedkar on ' Community Identities of People of Bharath'.



 As of date, this ' traditional language model for Samskruth: Veda /Deva /Yoga -Bhashaa has been treated as ' Samaaja- itihaasa bhashaa' in academia (west and orient). This ' alternate model' carries a ' historicity' of three centuries at least. This view is the antithesis of traditional view expressed by you in the primary statement.



 Coming to grammarians and nyaya schools ( = pada- pramana
schools), where the debate of 'shabda - nityatva is fiercely debated, their view has a critical role in addressing the ' meaning of Vedas'. I am keeping out the ' 'vakya' school as karma-kanda accepts 'Veda' in a particular mode and proceeds.



 The views of traditional grammarians ,( used preferentially by linguists, historians, translators, and archaeologists at least ) are
anchored to Patanjali, who has endorsed the traditional view on 'Samskrutham' as 'Vak-Yoga- Bhashaa', the language of Sthita /Sthira-Prajnaa ( Gita 2-54: Arjuna's question responded in Gita 17-15: Vangmayam Tapah) . When it comes to later writers, reference as
provided by Prof. Korada, there seems to be an ' element of indecision, doubt, less confidence, a compulsiveness to define a time limit for the concept of ' anaadi - veda' using the ' yuga-chakra time scale'. The exit comes from the definition of ' yuga -time scale', which has varied from some 5000 human years to a huge time cycle on cosmic scale . In beyond India study frame, the yuga time cycle of tradition is a directly challenging the science views on Big bang, cosmology , Darwinian evolution, Theologies and Religions looking at earth whose age does not exceed some 4000 years and the like. The proliferation of this debate is seen widespread and impacting the understanding of Vedanga Jyotisha, Jyotish/ Astronomy-Astrology based dating of Historicity of Mahabharata, and to come to the most practical level, the decision to observe the ' ekadashi'! 





Your following statement \< **If we agree to this then** \> is a noble, good wish and goal setting for debate for traditional schools. How does one proceed to address the issue , on what platform is the logistics to be addressed properly. It all starts with the exploration of two simple questions: What is Veda? What is Language of Veda ? 



 **This is also establishing the importance of 'VINIYOGA' issue raised by Dr. Yadu in many of his earlier posts.**



 Please note that I am as much an insider of the tradition and keenly interested to seek an establishment of position on this issue.
If 'Veda' is NOT established, the talk of 'Vedanta will end up as ' Prajnaa- Vaada' (Gita 2-11) ; The Gita statement at (15-15) becomes a
tall self declaration and 'egotistic claim ! Please don't feel offended. This is the logical consequence if your primary statement is not established beyond ' faith, continuity of tradition, Achaarya shraddhaa'. The views of three acharyas from Gita Bhashya is placed below for ready reference.
