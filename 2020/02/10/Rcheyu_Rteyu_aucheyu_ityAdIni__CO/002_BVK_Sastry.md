Namaste



The quote below from Prof. Korada, when taken out of context may lead to a highly inflammatory argument to derail the ' tradition'. and end up as a platform for generating ' new editions of texts of tradition' !

Especially if one misses the last pada of the quote. We do not seem to have enough ' abhiyktas' to meet the required decibel level to
be heard loud and clear, beyond their own whispers .



If we can research and bring back the entirety of 'Shadnaga Vedanga literature', especially for Nirukta, the questions raised by Nityananda ji may get an answer. any takers for supporting this ' Vedanga Treasure hunt' ??



I also recall at this point a memory from Late Mahamahopadhyaya Ranganatha Sharma. Around 1980's or so, there was a conference on 'Sanskrit, Computers, Veda and Eternal Word ( Nityah Shabdah). To the great surprise and shock of conventional audience, Sharma invoked a quote from one of the celebrated grammarians ( was it Nagesha Bhatta ?!)
and said ( summary as I remember now) :



The 'Shabdaanupoorvi' of ' vedas as we know today has a shelf - life of ' One yuga'. time scale. The Yuga time scale as mentioned in Gita and traditional Dharma Shaastras. This order of Veda as we know is for this yuga. In another Yuga, the word order and even swara may be different. Thus grammarians hold the view that ' the given word order in the current period is good for this Yuga. What is ' अग्निमीळे पुरोहितं ' for us might have been / could become वह्निमीळे पुरोहितं
for the next /previous yuga. This does NOT mean Veda is Anitya ! All that this means is VEDA is NITYA; VEDA -VARNAANUPOORVI is NITYA for the GIVEN YUGA. For our Yuga, what we have is fixed, sacred and is to
be guarded with the Vedanga tools provided.



The message was clear: The change of Veda-Varnaanupoorvi for another Yuga does not give a right for someone to meddle with ' Veda-varnaanupoorvi in this yuga and create new 21 st century veda and ' 21st century Gayatri Mantra'.



**" यद्यपि** इतिहासपुराणेषु **अपशब्दा अपि संभवन्ति** , तथापि येषामेव पूर्वपूर्वव्याकरणवशेन **तस्मिन् तस्मिन् काले सत्तानुसन्धानं त एव अनादयः साधवः इति निर्णीयते** ।



**यथैव वेदवाक्यानां पाठे सत्यपि सङ्करे । बहूनामभियुक्तानाम् उपदेशेन निर्णयः** ॥



Therefore, one needs to read the quote below in the right ' context'. Here below is my reason for this submission. May be this quote deserves greater debate in the frame of ' claimed integrity of larger texts of tradition.





The quote is not a justification to set right the course and documents
of tradition in circulation ! The quote is neither a call to make a laborious rule-jugglery with vyakarana alone to justify a 'deviant' reading and error seemingly obvious enough. There is no need to invoke ' inaccessible texts' as proof for a certain interpretation. There is no reason to pass on the blame to scribe copyist ! There is
no reason to make isolated hierarchy of one discipline as an irrefutable authority to clinch the argument. This is called the 'Shadanga Vedanga Integrity to understand the Vedic Text' which may have seeming ' apashabdas' in the limited lens of grammar applied partially !



If I point to the discussion from another thread over here, the variations of 'Text and reading for Vedas' can not be kept on the same par as ' Text and reading for Mahabharata'. While any effort to play around and edit 'Veda' will be tooth and nail opposed by schools of tradition, the ' seemingly bourgeoning expansion of Mahabharata' was permitted and allowed over a period of three millennia in Bharath - in the same land and communities. Gita remains intact; Mahabharata over all text expands. This is ' paramparaa'



Gita does document the loss of ' paramparaa' due to time-lapse. ( Gita -4-2)



 evam parampara-praptam, imam rajarsayo viduh ; sa kaleneha mahata yogo nastah parantapa.



 This supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession, and the saintly kings understood it in that way. 

But in course of time the succession was broken, and therefore the science as it is appears to be lost.



Mallinatha also points to ' earlier commentators errors'; Grammarians have condemned 'apashabdas' to restore the 'saadhu shabdas'.



Vedanta-Acharyas have claimed even the ' Brahma sutra Patha' as having suffered loss and provided their 'authenticated version' in Samskrutham.

In regional Languages, Jnaneswari emphatically states that the ' True meaning and text has been fixed by Sant Jnaneswara'.



All these great souls were clear of some things : TIME digests, decays
and destroys TRADITION. Therefore CONSTANT VIGIL is NEEDED to save, Safe-guard, Safe-Passage the Tradition for next generation . The mechanism was Guru-Shishya Paramparaa Human Chain of Successful Vigilant transmission and Validation. History was recognized, respected, referred to. But they were NOT locked to historic authenticity ! as ' written on stone' model. Old was not always Gold and unquestionable authority.
