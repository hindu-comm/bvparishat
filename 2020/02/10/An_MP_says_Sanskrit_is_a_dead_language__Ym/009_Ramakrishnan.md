Sarvebhyo namo namaḥ,  
  
Condemning is only effective on people who have some reputation to protect, and have self-respect that they value.  
  
Condemning a person who takes pride from it is counter productive. This speech is an example of the anti-intellectual counterculture that is typical in Dravidian politics. There are lakhs of such people whose intention is to strangle classical arts and shastras by repetitively uttering such obviously fake vicious propaganda to make it normative.  
  
We know that a large % of the country believes that Old-Indic was never a spoken language of the common people (did Pāṇini then not 'standardize' the phonology and morphology of multiple synchronic and diachronic commonly spoken Old-Indic dialects, or did he absurdly have an invariable unitary standard to start his grammatical standardization project with?) - this kind of fake propaganda is now made about the supposed death of sanskrit in order to actually kill it.  
  
What we can learn here is that there are shameless anti-intellectual forces which for the purpose of ideological brainwashing are actively seeking to kill the supposedly 'dead language' by making the argument (that 'Sanskrit is already dead and its carcass can now be cremated') normative -- and therefore ostensibly needs no university funding, no preservation of the millions of manuscripts currently being preserved in national libraries, no national news programmes in the language that are currently being broadcast on national radio and TV, etc. These are therefore desperate attempts to kill Sanskrit learning in India completely.  
  
Please dont bother condemning it - start uploading videos on youtube in Spoken sanskrit (as many as you can) on various shastras -- or simply post your thoughts about current issues in spoken sanskrit videos (and put 'Sanskrit' in the title so that people searching will find them) -- as more and more people (mainly scholars) speak in Sanskrit in publicly accessible social media platforms - the idea that Sanskrit is a dead language fit to be buried and denied funds will gradually go away.  
  
Our condemnations are of no avail, they have no morals to get affected by condemnations.  
  
Please upload (and share with people specifically who dont know sanskrit) videos in spoken sanskrit regularly, the proof is always in the pudding.  
  
Dhanyavādaḥ,  
Ramakrishnan
