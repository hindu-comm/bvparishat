Dear Vidwans,

  

By the beginning of the Christian Era Sanskrit was a fully evolved language. The literature written thereafter could have been written in any other language as easily as it was written in Sanskrit as the skill of writting it down too had sufficiently evolved. Before theChristian era the skill of writing not having evolved sufficiently it was necessary that knowledge be composed in chanda form so that the texts could be preserved over future generations through the Guru Shishya Parampara.

  

What led to the substitution of Sanskrit by apabhransh languages in day to day usage?

  

The first reason I suppose were its rigorous phonetical aspects which had to be learned before one could use the language. How can we answer the question of the word धर्म getting replaced by धम्म. This example only highlights the problem of the masses (illiterate of course) not being in a position to naturally pronounce धर्म on account of their dialects.

  

The next problem I suppose is the concept of prakruti pratyaya. The elaborate way in which the pada is arrived from its root. All this circus if one may call it tobe so is to maintain the unique phonetic structure of the Vedas.

  

The third problem is the inhibitions in the minds of the Guru's that it was difficult to teach Sanskrit to the mass of people on account of their dialects. (One should appreciate that as against Tamil Sanskrit was a pan India language.)

  

It is my opinion that if the last hurdle is overcome through a more evolved Shiksha Sanskrit can again be revived.

  

Unlike genes encapsulated in fossils which are dead, with the Vedas and the vedangas in hand it is possible to bring Sanskrit to life again.

  

Who said we can't? We can. But surely not by pumping money into Universities for Sanskrit or by giving scholarships and grants to students pursuing Sanskrit studies. Money has to go to children entering 1st grade in schools to teach Sanskrit. How many University Professors are ready for this job with their current salaries is the question?

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
