Here is an anecdote.

When I came to the US ('70s) I loved the Sugandha Shringar incense sticks from Mysore/Bangalore.

I was exposed to them in Udupi restaurants in Pune.

In those days, one can only order goods through a Bank (foreign exchange etc)  

I ordered a box through a local Bank. The box of hundred packets showed up in in a few months.

I got a call from the bank "something foul-smelling has arrived from India for you!"

Troubled with the message, i reached the Bank to collect my box of Sugandha Shringar incense sticks..
