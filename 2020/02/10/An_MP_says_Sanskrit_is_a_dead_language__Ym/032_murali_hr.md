Dear All,

  

I am sharing the thoughts about how sanskrit enriches ones life and one's society by regular use of Sanskrit.

  

Yesterday was Shiva Rathri and i happened to do the pooja and recite the following  

1.  Rudram 2.  Chamakam 3.  and Sadyojata Mantras apart from the regular suktas like Purusha
    Sukta and Narayana Sukta.

In the night I happened to read two books of poetry one in Kannada and another in Sanskrit  

1> Kiratharjuneeyam  

2> Kumaravyasa Bharata  

  

Similarly we can have ramayana recitation during Ramanavami.

Bhagavatam recitation during Krishnasthami, Narasimha Jayanthi etc .

During navaratri devi bhagavatam and tripura sundari rahasya etc.  

  

As i recite vishnusahasranamam regularly I felt that it was helped me lighten up my day and also energize me through out the day like daily exercise like running.  

  

I think we can publish a calendar of festivities and come up with a plan to discuss these mantras as per the schedule we will be spreading the vibes and also sharing the joy.

I am compiling NItya samskrutha in english/kannada on how sanskrit can bring joy and energy into our lives.

  

I suggest a format like Marathon where we have sprint training etc -  

VIshnusahasranama is like daily sprint for 20 mins

  

Let me know if people are interested we can make it a collective work.

  

Later we can add Sanskrit Literature also into the list.

  

Once a community is built around in various localities - we can spread the culture and enliven the language .

Once people have these many sanskrit literature in the mind it will be difficult to make it dead and we don not need state support

  

Murali
