The whole 'Classical Status" issue started with Sanskrit and Persian being categorized under Classical Languages during the British period and the categorization continuing during the post-independence period also.

  

The classification was " Classical " and " Modern"

  

(This has its origin in the European labels to Greek and Latin and the current European languages)

  

That implied Tamil is a Modern Language. For example, if a degree course three streams, Classical Language, Modern Language and say, Philosophy , student can choose Sanskrit or Persian under Classical , Tamil under Modern.

  

This label of Modern was not acceptable to Tamil language activists.
