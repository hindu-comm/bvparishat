His very name 'Dayanidhi' contradicts his idea of a 'dead language' :-)

  

Dr.Subrahmanyam Swamy, MP, has stated in a talk about his dialogue with M.Karunanidhi of the DMK: On the topic of Tamil not being influenced by Sanskrit, Swamy pointed to the very name of the person and the symbol-name of his party: udaya suriyan and taunted him asking what were these names other than Sanskrit ones.
