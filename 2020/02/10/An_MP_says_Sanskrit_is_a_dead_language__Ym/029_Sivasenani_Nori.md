Sri Nageshwar Mishra ji

  

You bemoan that there are not enough resources for learning Sanskrit; for languages like Telugu, the availability of resources is not even a tenth of that.

  

  

In the case of Sanskrit, there is very committed organization, Samskritabharathi, but the nearest equivalent in Telugu, the Andhra Mahasabha, glorious as its role was in achieving freedom in Hyderabad state, now is barely existing.  

  

  
To me it appears that it is due to lack of demand.

N Siva Senani
