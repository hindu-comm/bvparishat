Dear Vidwans,

  

What is the use of drum beating that Sanskrit is a living language though only in Universities or mainly by some scholars?

  

A language will last so long as the language or its literature contribute to the well being and education of the masses. It is towards this goal that the scholars need to work. Just unearthing manuscripts and earning PhD's on them or lecturing on the great ideas put forth in its literature is not going to take the cause of Sanskrit one inch forward.

  

Though the importance of protecting Sanskrit is unquestionable scholars need to prove its this worldliness.

  

With my little stint with Sanskrit (only limited to the Maheshwar Sutras) I am now conducting classes in remote Adivasi areas to teach them to read, write and speak Marathi English or Hindi with the help of Sutras based on the Maheshwar Sutras.

  

We need to prove that Sanskrit is an easy language to learn and use.
Unless we introduce it at the primary level where children readily pick up a language other than their mother tongue, I see no hope for its ressurgence. (The belief that it is a language of the Shisthas has to be erased from the minds of those who speak it). A language is much more than a means of communication. It shapes the personality of the people speaking it.

  

True, just bashing those who criticize Sanskrit in one way or other (also those who call it a language as any other) will not help the cause of Sanskrit and humanity. It is also important that we generate ideas with the help of its vast literature to further the cause of humanity.

  

Unlike Sanskrit there are many Indian dialects which are dying out on account of the proliferation of formal languages like English among others. Their usage on a day to day basis in homes is the only guarantee for their survival.

  

Each language whether fully evolved or not is a gift from nature like any other. The dying of a language is no different from the extinction of a species from the face of the earth on account of wanton human activities. It is my belief that introducing Sanskrit at the primary level will go a long way in preserving the uniqueness of each language or its dialect.

  

We should be in a position to bring forth the idea that Sanskrit is a facilitator to learn other tongues/languages than being a competitor.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
