Namaskar!

  

  

The following observation from this interview<https://grin.news/the-hidden-treasure-of-sanskrit-d11b436886e3>may perhaps throw some light to.

  

  

The idea of a “dead language” is applied especially to the classical languages of Europe, Greek and Latin. I don’t think it can be applied in the same way to Sanskrit. The culture that speaks Sanskrit is very much alive. If we go to Athens we won’t find any living temple dedicated to Zeus, but in India we will find plenty of them dedicated to Shiva or Vishnu. Arthur MacDonnell used to say that Sanskrit was more alive at the beginning of the XX Century, than Latin at the time of Dante. Linguistically a language is considered “dead” if it has no native speakers and it does not undergo any change. There are at least 7 villages in India were Sanskrit is spoken and the Indian Census records more 20.000 people who claim Sanskrit as their modern tongue. Moreover, changes have taken place. Neologisms are incorporated and the way today people speak Sanskrit is quite different from classical Sanskrit, even if Paninian rules are respected.

A staunch supporter of the death of Sanskrit could argue that people who today speak Sanskrit are revivalists and not true native speakers and that the so called changes are so limited and contrived that do not reflect a truly living language. If that’s so Sanskrit would have already been dead at time of Panini in the IV Century BC. What a paradox then, because much of the best Sanskrit literature would have come into life from a dead language. I argue that to speak of a “dead language” is a bad metaphor and a worst definition, because life and death are applied to biological entities and languages are not so. Dead is synonymous with lifeless, motionless, inert, but dead languages are much alive and productive. It is bad terminology. A language comes alive every time somebody reads or speaks it, writes or thinks in it.
