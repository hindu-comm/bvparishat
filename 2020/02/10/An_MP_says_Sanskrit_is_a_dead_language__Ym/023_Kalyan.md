Namaskaaram to all

  

Please allow me to tell my experience here. I tried to learn Sanskrit about 4 or 5 times, but each time I failed to make much progress.

  

For me, the biggest problem was that there was no one around me who can converse with me in Sanskrit. I feel one can learn a language more easily by conversing with others in that language. Even starting with simple conversational statements like "aham tatra gachhami" etc would be good. I badly felt the need of a person who can carry out day to day conversation in Sanskrit.

  

Regards

Kalyan
