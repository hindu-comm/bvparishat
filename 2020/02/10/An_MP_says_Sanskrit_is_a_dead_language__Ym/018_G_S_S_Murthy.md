I fully endorse the views of Prof.Achyut Karve in this matter. Especially this: "Just unearthing manuscripts and earning PhD's on them or lecturing on the great ideas put forth in its literature is not going to take the cause of Sanskrit one inch forward."

It is said that there are 2 components to taking care of anything: One is "yoga", the other is "kShema". Yoga refers to development, expansion. Kshema refers to preservingwhat exists. What is missing in Sanskrit is developing its area of activity "yoga". Unfortunately, today's political ambiance only emphasizes the heritage aspect of Sanskrit.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
