Recent acad.+classics development:2020 Feb 17: *[Classics Faculty Proposes Removal Of Homer And Virgil From Mods Syllabus](https://www.oxfordstudent.com/2020/02/17/94749/)*

  

One reaction I found particularly interesting, particularly when seen in comparison with the context in India:

If Rod is factual, it was striking (but not surprising), to me at least, that there are schools—Classical Christian (no surprise there either)—where, by the age of 13, there was an opportunity to read Illiad, Aeneid, Odyssey in full!

  

In US ('the' dropped, sorry!), where people of Christian faith are unarguably the religious[majority](https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/)(unless Pew data is contested/contestable), there exists (some might say, '[flourishing](https://classicalchristian.org/find-a-school/?v=a44707111a05)') an *Association of Classical Christian Schools,* with an impressive national footprint:

In India though, courtesy RTE (seen by some as '*[Legalised Hinduphobia](https://www.pgurus.com/diary-of-a-second-class-citizen-how-rte-has-hurt-hindu-educational-bodies-part-1/)*'), the *way of life* of the (so-called) majority is itself seen by some as an impediment:[*From RTE To Scholarships, Indian Education Is Hobbled By Minorityism*](https://swarajyamag.com/magazine/from-rte-to-scholarships-indian-education-is-hobbled-by-minorityism)

  

If all of the above is completely accurate, given how the religious majority in US is free to pursue their classical languages and texts as part of mainstream primary education, I wonder how much of a difference having similar 'freedom' in India could contribute to the growth and sustenance of languages such as Sanskrit and Tamizh (amongst many others) and some of the key primary sources in these languages.

  

Best,

Megh
