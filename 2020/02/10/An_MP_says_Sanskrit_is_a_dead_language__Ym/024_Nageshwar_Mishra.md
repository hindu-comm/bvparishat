I echo Kalyan Mahodaya completely. He shares same pain I had. I myself tried learning Sanskrit multiple times, bought many self learning books, referred online materials, understood whatever I could but with no conversation, I end up forgetting as it is not much in daily use. It did, however, help in reading and understanding our scriptures better.

  

Fortunately, I got few scholars here in New Jersey with whom I am enhancing my skills.

  

I see a wonderful concept of **ToastMasters** which is all across the world enhancing people’s skills in English and mainly conversation. It has local chapters in almost every US cities, it is all run by volunteers.

  

I wonder, to promote Sanskrit, why there cannot be similar institution. People can volunteer and create a local chapter in their area, city, office or whereever they are learn together for an hour a week or month or whatever is required. And it all can be guided and governed by centralized institution. There can be seminars, contests, award at each local, district, state, national or even international level.

  

I did find some local organization and few online courses that is big help in learning but I think they need to scale themselves tremendously and make people more aware about them. I strongly feel in order to promote and to ensure that Sanskrit really doesn’t get Dead, we need a Centralized but DeCentralized model where people can make active contributions.

  

I am in conversation with few people here and would be more than filling to volunteer for this greater cause. Hopefully, we’ll do something on this soon in smaller scale if not big.

  

May be I said too much. I know there are already eminent scholars in this group who might have much great thoughts. Just wanted to add few cents.

Nagesh
