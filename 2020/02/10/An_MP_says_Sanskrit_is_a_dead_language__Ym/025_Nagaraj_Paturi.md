I have a north Indian best friend of mine , here in Hyderabad, who did not learn Telugu in his last 40 years of stay here, in spite of a native

Telugu speaking environment all around him.

  

I have some relatives of mine who did not learn Marathi staying there for decades , in spite of a native Marathi speaking environment all around them.

  

I come across people speaking many foreignlanguages like German, French, Spanish , Russian etc. fluently after attending courses at the English and Foreign Languages University , without any native speaking environment around them.

  

Now the number of Sanskrit speakers who are learning through facilities like Samskrita Bharati is multiplying every day. Success of these learners seems to lie in them than in the environment. Samskrita Bharati-like facilities galore today all over the world.
