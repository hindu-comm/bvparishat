Dhanyavada.

I am aware of the math and science part. Most of the math, and many of the science.

  

Anything beyond these?

Ayurveda, rhinoplasty etc yes.

  

What about day to day life, what we see and accept as normal?

  

I do have a list of small things that collectively have a big impact. Even the use of chairs to sit on, with legs dangling, instead of cross legged, even on a raised platform. Long term or life habit to never sit crosslegged is a lost good habit, that many Indians left somewhere.

Western style toilet seats.

Use of modern toothbrush and pastes as opposed to neem or other options.

Not using iron pots and pans and hot plates but non stick pots and pans.

  

Small or big, any ideas examples are welcome.  
  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
