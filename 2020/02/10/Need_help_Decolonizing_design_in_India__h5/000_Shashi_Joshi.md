Respected members,

  

I need some help on the above topic.

If anyone has any pointers, references to existing work done etc, please share some links, works etc.

  

Not just theoretical, but practical aspects as well. Design is the expressed aspect of thoughts, so aterial about *decolonizing* *thoughts* will also be welcome.

  

While there is some material for worldwide domain, I am specifically looking for I dian context.

  

I am looking beyond the obvious, general statements (like McCaulay), but more specific examples and works. This is for a project.  
  

  
Dhanyavada,  
Shashikant
