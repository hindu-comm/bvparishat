Yes, plus beyond the modern definition.

  

I mean, even before modern concept of design came, India (like any other culture) had design - of town and city, of cloths and house, roads and temples, shops and farming, ...

  

The idea is to identify what Indians things were/are that have been abandoned/changed/neglected even though they were not *wrong* or *incorrect*. I may not be able to convey my thoughts clearly, though the scope is bit open right now.

  

Whatever info one may find, pointers, links, names are most welcome.

  

The intention of this?

To identify areas where the original, duncolonized thoughts and works didn't need to change (unlike new scientific and technical discoveries and inventions).

To identify areas where ways changed not because of a superior new product or idea, but because of an inferiority complex among colonized minds or some such thinking.

  

The aim is not to do chest thumping, but to sincerely recognize areas where a return is possible and even desirable. For India and if applicable, for benefit of others as well.  
  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
