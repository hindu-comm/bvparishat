Welcome to BVP, Manoj ji.

  

I wish you success in your endeavours.

  

To answer your question in brief, no there is no one convenient section of Vedas where all mathematics related material is collated.

  

It would be best to explore the organization of Vedas as a starting point. Articles of Prof K. Subrahmanyam of University of Hyderabad at the Jijyasa Foundation website (<http://ancientindianwisdom.com/vedas-and-vedic-system/vedangas/jyoti%e1%b9%a3am>) are an excellent starting point. Another thread of exploration could the contribution of ancient India to mathematics. There are some very good videos on the topic by Prof. K. Subrahmanian of IIT, Bombay (just Google them).

  

Regards

N Siva Senani
