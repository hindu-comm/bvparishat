Namaskara!

 I am new to this forum, joined recently and following some threads regularly. I am delighted to see that every post here is insightful with regard to our Sanskriti, heritage and Sanatan Dharma.

  

I was / am very curious about Vedic Mathematics since long; tried to collect material (online / offline) regarding the same and acknowledged some. But the gist is that that were only math’s techniques directly presented which were derived from Vedas. What I am more interested is in-depth study and analysis of rhymes which help in deriving more mathematical techniques, logic and built models based on it etc.

  

I haven’t read any of Vedas yet; for an even a page. Hence I would like to know whether all rhymes / verses related to mathematics are placed in single Ved in one section or these are segregated. Also I do sense these are not directly communicated but needs to interpret from given context.

  

In short, if I have to study this; where do I get related material, sources and what should be my approach? please guide. I wish to take deep dive into it though I know this is not as quick and simple as it looks but I am ready to spare considerable time on it. Dhanyavad!

  

Regards,

Manoj
