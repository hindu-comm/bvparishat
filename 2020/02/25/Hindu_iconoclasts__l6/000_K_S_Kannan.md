There was some discussion some time ago regarding Hindu kings who were iconoclasts,  

and Muslim kings who built/saved/spared temples - reckoning just exceptions  

\- the usual trick of Prof. Sheldon Pollock and his disciples.  

  

A fuller, or rather, more faithful, picture can be obtained in the present review  

of a book (authored by Meenakshi Jain) by Dr. Nanditha Krishna,

Director of Sir CPRamaswamy Iyer Institute of Indological Research, Chennai.  

  

The book by Jain must provide more info,  

as too, the books by Sita Ram Goel or Ram Swarup.
