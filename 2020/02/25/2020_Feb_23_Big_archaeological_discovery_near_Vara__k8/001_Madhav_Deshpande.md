We are told that "They have also found a pillar with a two line text in Kushan Brahmi script which makes the findings at least 3500-4000 year old." How does a text in Kushan Brahmi script prove that something is 3500-4000 years old? The Kushan rule is post-Ashokan and does not go that far back. Am I missing something?
