Dear All,

  

Sharing with all of you link of my TEDx talk on History of Indian Mathematics. I think this might be the first talk on the subject on TEDx and I hope many more will follow in the times to come so that more people get to learn and benefit from the subject.

I would like to thank stalwarts like Prof. Ramasubramanian, Prof. Sriram, Prof. M.D.Srinivas, Venugopal Heroor ji, Dr. R.C. Gupta ji and many others who have inspired me, and continue to do so, through their passion towards history of Indian Mathematics.

  

Regards,
