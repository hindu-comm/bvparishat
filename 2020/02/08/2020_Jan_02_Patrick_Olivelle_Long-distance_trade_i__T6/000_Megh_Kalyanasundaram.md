**Abstract**  
Much of the significant data for long-distance and maritime trade across South Asia in the ancient period comes from archaeological sources. Nevertheless, textual sources too have some significant things to say about material culture and trade in the ancient world. In a special way, texts give insights into what people thought about trans-regional trade, the globalisation of the ancient world, both the good and the bad that came with it, insights that cannot be culled solely from archaeological data. This article’s focus is on the Arthaśāstra, which Kauṭilya wrote around middle of the first century ce, drawing on sources that predate him by a century or more. The Arthaśāstra does not have a separate section on trade, but trade data are scattered over at least four areas: (a) the treasury and its need for luxury goods: pearls, gems, diamonds, coral, sandalwood, aloe, incense, skins and furs, and cloth; (b) military needs: horses and elephants; (c) developing and guarding land and water routes and shipping; and (d) duties and taxes on imported goods. Significant data on trade are also provided in Kauṭilya’s discussion of trade routes and their protection, as well as data on duties and taxes on imported goods.
