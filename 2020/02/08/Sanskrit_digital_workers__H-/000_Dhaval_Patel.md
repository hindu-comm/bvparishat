Dear scholars,

  

During the projects involving digitization of Sanskrit works, some of us feel lack of competent manpower sometimes.

  

On the other hand, there may be people who have requisite typing or proofreading skills and are not able to get in touch with potential employers / hirers.

  

Therefore, Vishvas at sanskrit-programmer group has created a small google form.

Two requests to members -

  

1\. If you know any person interested in Sanskrit digitization works, ask them to register. I request you to disseminate to pathshala / university students erc in your circle.

  

2\. If you / your contacts are looking for people to digitize something, you may consider hiring interested people from the list
