Namaskar to list scholars.

I have a querry. These days, many people opt for deha daana after their death. Garuna Purana describes the jiva' s journey after death of physical body. According to it jivatma feels pleasure and pain by various actions of relatives.

I want to know whether jivatma feels comfortable after watching the uses of his body if he opts for देहदान . Our ancient literature must have given some options. Please enlighten and oblige.

Dr. Rajkumari Trikha
