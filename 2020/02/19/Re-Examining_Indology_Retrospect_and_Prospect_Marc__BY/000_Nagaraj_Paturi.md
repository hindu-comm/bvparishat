Every civilization has an inbuilt mechanism to recollect and interpret its past which is a storehouse of its history and culture. This gives a sense of continuity on the basis of which traditions are built.**Long before the emergence of Indology as a colonial discipline in 18th century, India had her own intellectual traditions of self-recollection, self-identification, and self-representation.**These traditions were abounding with foundational texts inquiring into everything—from astronomy and grammar to the nature of ultimate reality—and developing appropriate knowledge systems for almost all aspects of human life.**These texts were continuously reflected and commented upon by a chain of commentaries**in various forms along with history (*Itihāsa*) as recollected, chronicled, and retold through various means not to speak of myth and*kāvya*traditions.**Without bearing any formal disciplinary nomenclature such as Indology, this vibrant and living engagement with the past—a realization of its own civilizational-self (*ātma-bodha*)—was derived from an ‘internalist’ perspective of its agency which was an integral part of those living traditions.**

**Pertinent Questions**:

**How should Indian scholars contribute to the generation of a new Indology in partnership with their confreres in the global arena in a manner which is true to the spirit and substance of India’s rich, varied and living cultural heritage?**What would be the appropriate epistemological underpinning of such a reconstructed Bhārat-Vidyā that could serve as a vehicle to understand India’s civilizational self?



Focusing on these questions, Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR, New Delhi) and Indian Institute of Advanced Study (IIAS, Shimla) propose to organize an International Seminar to address some of the**methodological, archaeological, historical, sociological, and philosophical issues involved in understanding the complexities of Indian society with particular attention to desiderata including the appropriate identification and use of source materials, knowledge systems, as well as methods of translation and interpretation**.



**Objectives of the Semina**r:

• to focus on contemporary value/relevance of Indological research

• to take forward some major debates in Indology

• to stress inter-disciplinary potential of Indology



**Issues to be discussed:**

• Pre-Indological appropriation of Indian knowledge

• Contemporary relevance of Indian*Gaṇita*(Mathematics), Āyurveda (Medicine),***Darśana-Śāstra*(Philosophy)**, and*Vijñāna*(Science).

•**Indian concept of State**



Date: March, 13,14,15, 2020.

Venue: Indian Institute of Advanced Study, Shimla, India.



"[Re-Examining Indology: Retrospect and Prospect](https://www.iccr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Indology%20Seminar%20Concept%20Note.pdf)" (March 13-15, 2020; Indian Institute of Advanced Study, Simla), prospectus







Nearly 30 years ago, a group of influential intellectuals in India decided:**let us tell our own stories**. The West has been telling our stories for us for far too long. I participated in the initial discussions, and in the resulting**Project of History of Indian Science, Philosophy and Culture**, and eventually authored one of its over 100 volumes.



  

**Therefore, it is time to stand on its head a whole lot of earlier Indology**, and to recognize that the contribution of Indian mathematics was not merely zero. It is time also to challenge the Western authority, on which fantasies about Greek achievements are based,**to provide primary facts, from contemporaneous texts, and to also engage with the non-textual evidence**.
