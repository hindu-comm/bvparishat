Namaste all,

  

If anyone in this list will be presenting in this conference and would consider sharing the schedule, that would be appreciated; thank you in advance.

  

An abstract, jointly submitted along with Manogna Sastry, did fetch us invitations for the conference but we are not in a position to see that through for reasons primarily logistical.

  

Best,

Megh
