Dear Colleagues,

  

Namaste.

  

I am wring this mail on behalf of the BVP management. I thought my intervention is needed at this point of time to maintain the harmony in the list. Each one of you are very important to me. You may apricot me in person in case you have any point for discussion.

  

I am a silent observer. I have been reading mails in recent days on many issues like Gender, Sex, and Sexuality. Everyone has his own ideas and thesis. Forums like this are the places to share and discuss. But, no one should take them personal. Personal comments and attacks are not good practices. We should not take the names of people and Institutions for nullifying their activities. We can just oppose the stands if any as a reference. Even using harsh language for others stand also hurt the other side. I need not explain this to learned scholars.

  

I am disturbed to note that the thread on Indic Academy's conference on " Sex, Gender and Sexuality" has attracted many posts with expressions that are not suitable to a forum of scholars and that too a public forum. Comparing an entire community and its tendency to TB etc., is not an acceptable form of communication on BVP. Opinion can be highly divided on issues such as the allowance to LGBTQ in Indic culture, traditions, shaastras, scriptures etc. As a forum discussing Indic culture, traditions, shaastras, scriptures etc., it falls well within the scope of BVP to discuss and debate the issue if we derail from the object. But we, from the management, can not allow name calling against individuals or organizations from this platform. The management may be compelled to take suitable steps resorting to such unacceptable forms of communication if situation arses. Since, Its a public forum, we are subject to legal, social, an moral bindings.

  

I therefore request all reputed members to maintain certain level of dignity and discipline, while posting on this scholarly public forum. This mail is NOT addressing or targeting any personâ€™s action. Hence, no reaction is needed. Only action is requested.

  

Warm regards,  

  

Shrinivasa Varakhedi
