Namaste,

Rules are already in place and everyone accepts at the time of joining the Group.

The first thing is that members are bound to abide...

  

Rest comes under the Moderator who is empowered enough to block the posts or replies not conforming to the rules, and that mUST be exercised no matter whose post or reply one maybe. Sanctity of the Group is on prime importance and must be upheld.

  

Regards

Sati Shankar
