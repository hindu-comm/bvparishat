This is a good note. I agree with the general idea - but disagree strongly with the following part: "Comparing an entire community and its tendency to TB etc. \[is bad\]". This is reminiscent of <https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48922546> ("Twitter is updating its hate-speech rules to ban posts that liken religious groups to rats, viruses or maggots, among other dehumanising terms." It is not hard to guess which religion(s) being shilded are comparable to viruses if one examines the mode of transmission.). Rather than merely adding to noise, sometimes similies and metaphors actually add clarity. It is not a bright idea to "ban" that.

  

To emphasize, it is not that I am agreeing with the comparison in this case, just that even moderation should be "moderate" :-). Also, I don't think that Mr Srinivas or Indic Academy or Narendra Modi or pro-immunization camp or whoever shrIvatsa is currently after need be overly worried - cool responses suffice, and muzzling the criticism is not needed as long as it does not become spammy (eg. by staying within a thread). It is not like "discord" vanishes if its limited expression is stopped.
