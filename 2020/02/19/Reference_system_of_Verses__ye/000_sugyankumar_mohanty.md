Respected Scholars,

I want to draw your attention towards following points:

  

References on *Reference system of Verses*.

How the verses should be cited?

Weather page numbers are necessary or not in the reference system to cite verses.  

  

What is the universal approved system of citing a verse from a masterpiece? It may be in APA or MLA.

  

Thank you.
