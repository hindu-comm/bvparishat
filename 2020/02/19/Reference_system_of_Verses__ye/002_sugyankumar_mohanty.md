Dear Prof./Dr.N Siva Senani,

namonamaH. Thank you for your remarks onReference system of Verses.

  

Following reference on the context is alos available as per APA 6.18.

  

**Citing classical works (APA 6.18)**

In-text citation includes the original date of publication and the date of republication or translation.

**Modern edition:**`Pestalozzi (1801/1977)`

**Translation:**`Rousseau (1762, trans.1979)`

Ancient classical works and religious texts numbered systematically across all editions do not require reference list entries. Simply identify the version used in the first in-text citation and use the standard numbering system rather than pagination when referring to specific parts of the work:

`James 3:1 (New American Version)`

Apart from above reference is any other study or reference available onReference system of Verses as per Indian Classical citations?

  

Regards
