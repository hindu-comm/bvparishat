I think some of the old Indo-Aryan words became obsolete and we don't find them in Sanskrit lexicons. However, a few of inflected forms out of those words remained in use.

  

The comparative and superlative forms *nedīyas-* and *nediṣṭha-* are in use, whereas the original stem \**neda-* was obsolete. Its Iranian cognate*nazd* was in use and we have the widely used word نزدیک (*nazdīk)* in modern Persian and Hindustani.

  

Some of our ancient grammarians probably didn't know the original stem since it had been not in use or they didn't want to provide the etymology from an unknown word. Hence, they used another word *antika-* which has the same meaning but it is not etymologically related to those comparative and superlative forms of *\*neda.*

*

The verb*nedayati* (makes near) is often used as a denominative form of *antika-.* Maybe this is a denominative of *\*neda* or just a causative of a verb root *ned-.* The Pāṇinian Dhātupāṭha in fact has this verb: *ṇédṚ*˜*kutsā-sannikarṣáyoḥ* 1.1013 (class 1 verb root *ned-*), one of the meanings of which is 'to near'.
