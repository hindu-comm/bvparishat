Dear List

  

These are interesting observations. My compliments to Sri Dr. Deepro Chakraborty on connecting the dots.

  

I have a question: To support the theory of suppletion, is it a necessary requirement to first list all cases where an apparent gap-filling operation happens and then show that for all, most or majority of cases, a lost root is found? Or, is this based on a few such observations without reference to the total number of cases which could be described as suppletion? As an aside, the theory would be on very sound footing, if a few such lost roots are found \*after\* the prediction, like we see in other fields like particle physics or chemistry (new elements predicted based on gaps in the periodic table).

  

To me if it is the former then it is the equivalent of supplying a modern vartika. If not, it is work-in-progress and cannot be considered as a siddhanta - along the lines of लुप्तस्य प्रातिनिध्यमिति केचन। न, सार्वजनिकत्वाभावात्।

  

Regards

N Siva Senani
