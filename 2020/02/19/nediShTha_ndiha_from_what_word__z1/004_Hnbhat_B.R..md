And also you can note that because of this substitution, you can find superslative of अन्तिक as अन्तिकिष्ठः or of बाढम् as बाढिष्ठः. But only from नेद and साध.

Also you can find many such substitutions in superlative dictionary.

  

Panini explained these available superlative degrees and has not done anything to the existing forms.
