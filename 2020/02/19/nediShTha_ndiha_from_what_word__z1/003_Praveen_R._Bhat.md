Its an आदेश/ grammatical substitute made during derivation, so they may not be found in dictionaries. Although you would find नेदिष्ठ in superlative, it is not really the superlative of neda, but of antika. So you will have अन्तिक, नेदीयस्, नेदीष्ठ to mean near, nearer and nearest, respectively. I am not sure what you meant by because of Panini, but I would add that Panini Maharshi just codified the language as it exists into grammar rules.
