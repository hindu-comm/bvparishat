Sir

  

Thank you for a very interesting paper.

  

List

  

The accumulation of observations and then proposal of a theory coveringinherent incompatibilityof sense of some roots and lakaaras with aspect was fascinating to read. This reminds me of akarmaka-dhatus. To extend the comparison a bit, there are different ways of proceeding further after the first step of observation. Sanskrit seems to generally restrict the boundary of a Sastra and retain focus on the stated aim: describe the language\[1\]. This focus on "what" and not "why" is seen in the case of root substitutions as well, where the device is use for both suppletive and non-suppletive substitutions.

  

However having posed the original question on whether this is a work-in-progress or a siddhanta, I must go beyond my fascination and ponder on that. It seems to me that, as with so many other attempts in modern linguistics, this is work-in-progress for the following reasons: no claim to comprehensiveness is made (a note to the contrary is in fact found), variations of reality from theory are observed but not explained (if suppletion is based on inherent incompatibility between sense and aspect it should not change over time - for one subscribing to constancy of the relationship between word and sense, change of sense over time is inadmissible, so a theory of suppletion not supported with a comprehensive survey then being used as a justification for change of sense over time becomes circular logic) and is based only on discussion of conforming cases.

  

None of this is to take away anything from the fascinating discussion. It is just that the standard of hard sciences like Physics is more compatible with what is found in ancient Sastra than that found in humanities. I found this most evident in comparing Critical Theory (book length hyper-verbose theory with examples of less than ten) and Alankara Sastra (concise propositions, precise classification and a plethora of examples and counter examples), both dealing with the same question - what makes poetry poetic? Compare that with a physics textbook: each chapter covering three or four propositions has tens of examples.

  

Thanking Prof. Deshpande ji once again, I remain

  

Curiously yours

\[1\] One speculation could be why the roots are what they are and not of other forms. For instance if we examine the roots with one akshara, and compare it with all possible candidates like ka, kA, ki, ki (the full baarakhadi), we will find many gaps. It would also be possible to speculate on reasons for the same, usually ease of pronunciation. Looking at the artificial language devised for the film Avatar (with a vocabulary of 1,000),it sems to be that pseudo roots occurring in the 'gaps' mentioned above were used. Anyways, the response of Sastrakrit would be, these are the roots and not others and it is so. And this difference in objectives was duly noted by Prof. Deshpande in his paper.
