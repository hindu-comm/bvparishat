Dear Nori Ji,

  

  Suppletion as a phenomenon across the languages of the world is a long studied subject in the field of linguistics. I have attached an article of mine that discusses the justification for this phenomenon in Sanskrit, but provides bibliography of previous studies. With best regards,
