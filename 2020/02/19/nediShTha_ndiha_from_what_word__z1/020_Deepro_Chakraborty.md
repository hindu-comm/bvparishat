Dear Prof. Kannan,

  

Can we derive *daviṣṭha* from the verb root *du- or dū-*?**Pāṇinian Dhātupāṭha has a verb *-du* (*dú \[gátau\]).* Probably the word *dūra-* is also derived from the verb *-dū* with a suffix *-ra.* But the Pāṇinian Uṇādi sūtra 2.20 (durīṇo lopaś ca) provides a peculiar explanation: the word *dūra-*is formed from the preverb *dur- +**√īṆ-*(to go)+ *-raK* (uṇādi suffix) where the actual verb root *i* gets omitted. Thus, *dur-+ -ra(K) = dūra*. But if we consider *dū- as the verb root* instead of dur- √ī it becomes less complicated. From the verb root*-du* or *-dū* we can get a nominal stem *du- or dū-* (going far) from which we can get the comparative and superlative forms *davīyas-* and *daviṣṭha-.*
