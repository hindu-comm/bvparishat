Prof. Deshpande,

  

I have not read your article in full.

But from what I had read long ago,

"went" is originally from "to wend", being its Past Tense form (Cf. *to bend* & *bent*).

Given the flux in English, this "wend" lost its original sense,

yielding place to a specialised sense of "to go".

  

Almost similar with : in "How did he fare there",

the root had a German origin, "*fahren*", to travel.

  

I might have erred, having read this too long ago (in the '80s perhaps),

while I went through Simeon Potter's *Our Language.*

*

Your article did not seem to have considered "to wend",

when I gave a quick search for the word.

  

Any clarification?

Regards
