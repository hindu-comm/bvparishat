Dear Deepro, 

  

   These are excellent observations. These are what are called suppletive forms, where incomplete paradigms are filled with near synonyms. The absence of *neda* and presence of *nedīyas* and *nediṣṭḥa* required the suppletion with *antika*. The Vedic name *nābhānediṣṭha* has an Avestan parallel*Nabānazdišta.*Avestan had both *nazd* and*nazdišta*, and did not need suppletion, while Sanskrit has *nedīyas* and*nediṣṭha,* but no *neda*, and hence required suppletion.
