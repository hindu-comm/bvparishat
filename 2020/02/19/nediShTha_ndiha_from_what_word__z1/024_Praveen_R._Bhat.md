Thats quite interesting; looks like नजदीक has the influence of नेदृँ as well as अन्तिक!

  

In any case, since Bhagavan Panini has नेदृँ in धातुपाठ but chose to use नेदादेश for अन्तिक, it is clear that Vaiyakaranas knew that the positive form using नेदृँ doesn't exist in Vedas (couldn't find in Rigveda, thanks to Yoganandaji's website) and in laukika too. Anything else is असंस्कृत।

  

Kind rgds,
