Namaste,

  

I am not sure how it is related to नेदम् for your reply on it, but just to clarify those Kena mantras have nothing to do with नेदम्, that is a sandhi of न and इदम्।

  

The refrain there तदेव ब्रह्म त्वं विद्धि नेदं यदिदमुपासते is to say (येन वाक् अभ्युदते, येन मनः मतम्, etc) त्वं तत् एव ब्रह्म विद्धि। यत् इदम् उपासते तत् ब्रह्म न विद्धि।

  

And through the anvaya, इदम् and तत् also are not categorically near and far respectively. If anything objectified सगुण इदम् as an उपास्य is farther than निर्गुण तत् known as अहम्।

  

(Apologies this reply has gone away from the thread topic as the post I am replying to has).
