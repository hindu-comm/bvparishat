You could please take a look at ಹಿಂದೂ ದರ್ಶನ ಸಾರ (Hindu darshana saara in Kannada) by Mmp. Pt. Lakshmipuram Srinivasacharya ( Univ. of Mysore, publn. around 1940). I have found this short monograph to be crisp, precise and scholarly, almost tracing an evolutionary trajectory for Indian Darshanas. It also has sections on Jaina and Bauddha systems.

  

Thanks
