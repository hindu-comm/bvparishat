1\. The explanation bears out wide-ranging scholarship as usual, no doubt,

but is just not convincing.

  

2\. If Manu (or Bhrgu) indeed wanted the formation to be  

(ब्रह्म->ब्राह्म->)ब्राह्मीय(as the base),

he could have used the word ब्राह्मीया  

(ending in long आ to accord with the gender of तनु),

and said ब्राह्मीया क्रियते तनुः\|

  

3\. All the examples of non-corroboration of gender you have given

(many were discussed earlier too)

are either (a) cases where there is उद्देश्य-विधेय-भाव;

or else (b) cases involving words which are नियत-लिङ्ग.

  

4\. Where simpler explanations are easily possible,  

why are we labouring to give complex explanations that just cannot tally?

  

5\. Also, has any traditional commentator taken this circumlocutory route of explanation?

For example, has Kulluka derived *brAhmIya* first, and then given the *anvaya*?  

  

6\. The traditional maxim is :

कल्पना-लाघवं यत्र तं पक्षं रोचयामहे ।

कल्पना-गौरवं यत्र तं पक्षं न सहामहे ॥

(=Ockham's Razor must naturally be applied).

  

7\. Where did I ask to edit the original?

I only gave the natural prose order.

  

8\. If प्रकृति-विकृति-भाव was intended between तनु and ब्रह्म,

could he not have said something more easily like

तनुर्ब्रह्म भवेद् ध्रुवम्॥

  

Are we to posit a प्रकृति-विकृति-भाव between तनु and ब्राह्मीय then ?!

  

9\. Or, does literature attest ब्राह्मीय as some independent/well-established entity/notion?  

The words पिण्ड (m.) and कुण्डल (n.) have their own gender each.

  

10\. And the change in number(वचन) is easily explicable:

What was a single entity has now become two entities

= one पिण्ड has become two कुण्डल-s.

  

11\. Is there a word ब्राह्मीय with its own gender (like कुण्डल ) ?

ब्राह्मीय is not a noun, I suppose, which कुण्डल is.

  

I would be thankful if my doubts are clarified.
