I could figure out no difference between  

\(a\) the generally accepted *iyam tanuH* in the text, and  

\(b\) your mere *tanuH* in the text.

After all, is Manu speaking of the *tanu* of any particular individual?

To whom does the indexicality of *iyam* then point?

  

And is there in any *s'Astra*, the concept of a *brAhmIya(tva)-jAti* described?

Is *brAhmI(tva)* inconceivable or inadequate as a *jAti* in itself  

that a new *jAti* had to be conceived or contrived?

And to what advantage, for all the effort?  

  

Does *the body* in "The body is mortal, after all!"

refer to *jAti* or *vyakti*?  

  

It is true that many commentators have missed many points.

And nothing wrong too in differing from them.

No problem in accepting any *upapattimad-UrjitaM vacaH* from anybody.

The question was only of the soundness of the *upapatti* as presented.

Sound substantiations can bolster novel conceptualisations.  

  

I am not keen on escalation, but the unusual explanation seemed a bit strained.

*vidvAMsaH pramANam.*
