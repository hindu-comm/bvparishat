Namaste



On \< amazing grammatical acrobatics \> There are palces where this charge would be accepted; but not in this context !



1. Understanding the 'Context Sensitivity and Communication from the given word as ' Mahaa- Taatparya' is NOT grammatical acrobatics !
Calling such a wide vision as grammatical acrobatics' is wearing
blinkers in text studies.



In the thread of discussion : the term ' 'ब्रह्म ' has come in from
multiple backdrops of Vedic , Dharma shastra and social usage . The 'genre and person' ( Jaati and Vyakti ) context changes the 'abhi-vyakti' (= intended communication for each seeker in the context). Prof. Korada mentioned it clearly. The invocation of ' chvi-' pratyaya is for deeper contemplation. Is the Samksaara for the ' tanu' (= body)
or 'Jiva' ? Samskaara impacting the Shareera and Jiva . What is the gender for \< **ब्रह्मन् **\> ? to invoke in \< ब्राह्मीयं क्रियते तनुः\> There are deeper philosophical and metaphysical technicalities that would come out in this contemplation.



The passage invoked by Prof.Korada has the pointer for this in the highlighted line below: Hari in **लिङ्गसमुद्देश - पदकाण्ड - वाक्यपदीय** explains the case of **लिङ्गम्** -- भावतत्त्वविदः शिष्टाः शब्दार्थेषु व्यवस्थितम् । यद्यद्धर्मे ’ङ्गतामेति लिङ्गं तत्तत्प्रचक्षते ॥ ----21 -- भावतत्त्वविदः = पदार्थतत्त्वविदः -- **Nagesa** says भाव (without उपपद) means ब्रह्मन् । **Since, between तनुः and ब्राह्मीयम् are प्रकृति and विकृति and neither is विशेष्यम् nor विशेषणम् to the other the question of समानलिङ्गत्वम्
does not arise at all --- तनु becomes ब्रह्मन् ।**





The 'kalpanaa- laaghava' is a context construction within the debated context. The 'If .. ' question and ' proposed reconstruction suggestions' are independent opinions of the schoalrs !

The If argument ..' does not give the freedom for ' given text altercations and amendation' or 'proposing ' simpler...(by our thinking standards)' constrictions seemingly simple at the cost of dropping the original frame of term-usage. The ' gender argument' as masculine/ feminine has a context sensitivity to run common for a male and female body. The grammar construction does not take away the inherent communication potential in the term or the dictum given. The line of argument that may have to be constructed is ' the rites of passage for a male and female body related'. The labour of schoalrship is to understand the deeper meaning of the given text.

On traditional commentaries on Dharma Shaastra, the sloka specific commentary does not high light this . Sure. But the issue is taken up elsewhere on 'rites of passage for women', a part of 'Samskara debate'.



Surely 'Samskrutham' is a language which brings in confusions, for which reason only one has to approach the 'acharya'.
