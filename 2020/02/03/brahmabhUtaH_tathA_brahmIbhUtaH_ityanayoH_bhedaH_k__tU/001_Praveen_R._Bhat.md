The grammatical differences might bring a slight change of meaning in the words ब्रह्मभूतः and ब्रह्मीभूतः। The former is a समास while the latter is a तद्धित derived through च्विँप्रत्यय। Factually, the धातुs are themselves different in both भूतs as well, the former being भू प्राप्तौ and the latter भू सत्तायाम्। IMO, the following may be the possible difference between the two:

  

ब्रह्मत्वं भूतः प्राप्तः ब्रह्मभूतः। This is द्वितीया तत्पुरुष with भावनिर्देश of the पूर्वपद। The attainment of ब्रह्मत्व here can be figurative as प्राप्तस्य प्राप्तिः/ जीवन्मुक्ति or it can be उपासनकृत and thereby गति involved can be seen as प्राप्ति।

  

अब्रह्म ब्रह्म भवति इति ब्रह्मीभूतः। This cannot be literal though the तद्धितवृत्ति is so and I think it can only mean जीवन्मुक्ति।
