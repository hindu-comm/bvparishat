I think the expressions ब्रह्मभूत, ब्रह्मीभूत and ब्रह्मभूय are different representations of the Upanishadic passageब्रह्मविद् ब्रह्मैव भवति' (मुण्डक-उपनिषद् ३/२/९). The slight grammatical differences in derivations will not change the intended meaning. However, I have seen the usage of the expressionsब्रह्मभूत, ब्रह्मीभूत and ब्रह्मलीन to refer to someone who has passed away, and in that sense it is equivalent to expressions like कैलासवासी, वैकुण्ठवासी or स्वर्गवासी, referring to variant notions of where the departed soul goes.
