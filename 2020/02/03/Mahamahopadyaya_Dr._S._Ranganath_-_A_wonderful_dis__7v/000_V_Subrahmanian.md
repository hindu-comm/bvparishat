It was by chance that I came upon this mesmerizing talk, in Kannada, by the eminent scholar of Bangalore. In the first few minutes of this talk he lists a bird's eye view of Sanskrit literary works of the last Century till date. The names of Dr. Janardana Hegde and H.R.Vishwas too are there.

  

He gives a sample of his deep scholarship in his reeling out from memory several verses of the Naishadhiya kaavya. A lot of anecdotes add to the pleasant experience of hearing this lecture. Even those who do not know Kannada can enjoy and appreciate the history of Sanskrit literature that he reads out.
