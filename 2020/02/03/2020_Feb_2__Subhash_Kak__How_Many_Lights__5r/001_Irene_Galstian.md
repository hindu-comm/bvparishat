What human activity can escape these questions?  

Academia and science do address them, but, like other areas of human endeavour, these two areas contain people of different levels of consciousness.

If you're asking why the \*majority\* of scientists and academics aren't alive to these questions, you're effectively asking why the average level of consciousness on Earth is what it is at this time. This has nothing to do with science or academia. The real question is how to raise the level of consciousness, because what's seen as 'obvious' is a matter of direct perception of those involved.
