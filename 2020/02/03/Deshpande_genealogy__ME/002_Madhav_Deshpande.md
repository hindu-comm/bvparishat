Dear Professor Iyengar,

  

  My family belongs to the Deshastha Brahmins of Maharashtra. We are R̥gvedins, traditionally following the Śākala Śākhā of the R̥gveda and the Āśvalāyana Sūtra. While growing up in Pune, I had heard from my grand-father that a few generations ago, the family, living in Tembhurni near Solapur, was a Madhvaite Vaishnava family, but after migrating to Pune, that Madhvaite connection completely disappeared. However, during the rituals in the family like changing the Yajñopavīta, I clearly heard the formulaic recitation of the Bhāradvāja Gotra, the three Pravaras \[Āṅgirasa, Bārhaspatya, & Bhāradvāja\], Śākala Śākhā and Āśvalāyana Sūtra.
