I found a book gifted to my grandfather by someone, where it says: रा. (=राजमान्य) वासुदेवराव देशपांडे यांस सप्रेम. So, here my grandfather was addressed as वासुदेवराव. The alternation of the honorifics पंत and राव is intriguing to me: रामचंद्रपंत \>वासुदेवराव>मुरलीधरपंत>माधवराव.
Would be a good research topic for someone.
