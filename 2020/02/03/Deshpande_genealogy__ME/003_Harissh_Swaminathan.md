Dear madhavji

  

Your story about your ancestor on predicting the tithi wrong is veryinteresting

  

Down south we have the story of abhirami bhatta who did the same. He said it was poornima instead of amavasya due to the radiance from Devi's ear rings

  

The king gives death penalty to abhirami bhatta but with Devi's grace that day becomes poornima

  

Interestingly the king is also a maraata ruler

  

A very interesting coincidence
