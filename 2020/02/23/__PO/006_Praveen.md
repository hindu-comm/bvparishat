Dear Members,

  

I think that, we have to find out the vyutapathi kosha's (Etymological Dictionaries) in Sanskrit for the same.

There are two good dictionaries as per my knowledge which are given below.

Dravidian Etymological Dictionary (DED) by Thomas Burrow for dravidian Languages.

A Comparative Dictionary of The Indo Aryan Languages by Sir Ralph Lilley Turner (1888-1983).

For more dictionaries, kindly visit the following weblink.

Online resources are available at <https://dsalsrv04.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/soas>

  

  

Regards

Praveen
