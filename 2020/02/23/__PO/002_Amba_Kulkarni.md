Dear Professor Sir/Madam

We have access to lot of literatures of Western languages wherein it is found that word like **scribe, write, read** came from incidents related to early counting /foretelling lot etc. Even **book c**ame from middle high German beeches. ( wooden tablets tied together ) transformed to its intermediate from Gothic "books".

Had our present/ancient form of words in respect of writing, reading, counting, name of numbers resulted from similar activities ? Have any such paper or book of linguistics/etymologies.?

I am requesting you to inform me the expert in this regard also.

Regards.
