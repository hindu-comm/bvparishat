Great set of reminiscences in a single talk. Very informative and informal, I'm sure. Everything has been couched as personal experiences and in a manner palatable to the primary audience i.e., young people.  

  

Thanks for sharing,

  
Srini

  

PS: He hardly looks like someone who got his first academic appointment in 1969!!
