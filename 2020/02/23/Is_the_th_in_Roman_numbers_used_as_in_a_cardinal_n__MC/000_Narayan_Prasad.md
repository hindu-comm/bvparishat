Dear Scholars,  

   Namaste.

  
Ref:<https://www.quora.com/Is-the-th-in-Roman-numbers-used-as-in-a-cardinal-number>

  

   With reference to the above, which of the following is correct?

      (1) in XV century

      (2) in the XVth century

  

    I intend to say "in the 15th century", but I want to use the Roman numeral as ordinal number.

    Regards

    Narayan Prasad
