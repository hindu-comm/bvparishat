" Modernity " no longer remains a positive label all over. It may have a positive reception in general educated and semi-educated masses.

  

But among the 'intellectual' 'liberal' circles, Cultural Studies" , "post-modern" " media studies" ' "Critical Theory " etc. are the fashion words.

  

In all these approaches, "modernity" is supposed to be "interrogated".

" Cultural Studies" , "post-modern" " media studies" ' "Critical Theory " etc.
