There are several helpful pre-modern works on upasargas, including

Tilaka's Nipātāvyayopasargavṛtti (covering, as the title says, more

than only upasargas), edited by Somesvara Sarma and published

from Tirupati in 1951, and the Viṃśatyupasargavṛtti attributed to

the Buddhist grammarian Candragomin, edited together with its

classical Tibetan translation by D. Dimitrov and published from

Marburg in the Indica et Tibetica series in 2007 (see

also the review by G. Cardona in Indo-Iranian Journal 51 (2008),

33–38). These works also provide references to other texts dedicated

to the upasargas.

  

Also the Gaṇaratnamahodadhi of Vardhamāna, edited by

J. Eggeling and published from London in 1879 (there are reprints

from Motilal Banarsidass, and also other editions I think),

treats the upasargas (as well as other items in the Gaṇapāṭha) very usefully.
