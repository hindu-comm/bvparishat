**\<\<It seems to me that in Sanskrit, like in Russian, the preverbs are the bane of one's existence.>\>**

  

And this is how the American physicist Mitchell Wilson expressed his opinion under the subject "How I managed without an interpreter" (Part-III) that I read when I was learning Russian (the relevant passage attached).

  

He learnt a five-line sentence (full of the beauty of prefixes) in Russian by heart with much trouble. He repeated the sentence even in his dream. But in the end he forgot 90% of this text.

He compares the endings of Russian verbs, cases and declensions as a twelve-hour farmer's work in the field.
