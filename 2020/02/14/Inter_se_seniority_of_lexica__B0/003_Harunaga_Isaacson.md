Different authors have different favorite lexica.

  

For the kāvya commentator Mallinātha I believe that apart from Amara the

most commonly quoted lexicon is the Viśvaprakāśa (usually quoted

with ... iti viśvaḥ). Vaijayantī and Śāśvata are also quoted

by him quite frequently, but Amara and Viśva are distinctly ahead

of them.

  

This is not based on comprehensive, precise statistics, which are probably not

possible without accurate and complete e-texts, but I think it should hold true

even when such statistics are eventually compiled.

  

(Matters are slightly complicated by the fact that citations from lexica are

not infrequently added in the course of transmission. So we find often that

some manuscripts of a commentary have more such citations than

other manuscripts.)
