What I may immediately recall:

I guess you will have looked into Zachariae, Patkar, and Vogel.

And SPNarang also perhaps.

(There is also a 1933 book in Marathi called *  
*

*Kos'a-racanA-s'Astra va Kos'a-vAn'maya*).  

  

BTW,

it may not be sufficient to say whether a particular word occurs in *Amarakos'a* (or not).

Whether a particular sense of the word is noted there (or not) is also important:

the section on homonymy/polysemy lists multiple senses,

and this will also need to be taken into account

(perhaps at a later/more advanced stage).

And so with other *kos'a*-s.
