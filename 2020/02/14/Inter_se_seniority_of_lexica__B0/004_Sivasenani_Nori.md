Sir

  

My thoughts.

  

While the method outlined by you would indeed be a good starting point, after your repository gets a few hits, say a thousand, the correct order would be the order of click-throughs as utility to your users is what is important and you do not intend arbiter the Sastraic soundness of one source over the other (in fact, your very act of inclusion of a source signifies your endorsement).

  

Overall, the following order may be followed.

  

A. Starting order - Amara at top and rest being in decreasing order of length of definition (presumably longer the explanation or list of synonyms, more the utility) and to break ties, alphabetical order of the popular or internally standardised name (say Amarakosha as opposed to naamalingaanushaasanam) of kosha. This would be valid as ultimately the union of all is what is sanctioned by Sastra and so all are equally important. Pending a measure of popularity, you are relying on presumed utility.

  

B. From the second instance, compute the number of times a kosha has appeared in all previous searches and display in decreasing order of this rank. This measure would rank the koshas in order of utility to your users. Tie breaker would be as in (A) above.

  

C. After thousand clicks (or such arbitrary number), arrange in decrease order of click-through counts. Use (B) for breaking ties.

  

Regards

Senani
