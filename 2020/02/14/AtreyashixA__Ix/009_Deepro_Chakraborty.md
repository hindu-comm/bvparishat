Dear Prof. Deshpande,

  

I am very excited that you are going to have a look at that work that I produced in 2013 as my MPhil dissertation.

  

With the help of Detlef Eichler I could trace 60 errors in the book. So, please also consider [these corrigenda](https://www.academia.edu/39061592/Corrigenda_of_%C4%80treya%C5%9B%C4%ABk%E1%B9%A3%C4%81_a_%C5%9Bik%E1%B9%A3%C4%81_of_the_Taittir%C4%ABya_School).

  

Thankfully,

Deepro
