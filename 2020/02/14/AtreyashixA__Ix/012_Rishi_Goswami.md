Dhanyavad Deeproji, by sources I meant various commentaries.  
  
As you mentioned Manomahan Ghosh and others, also You or someone epse had sent an Anusvara pdf which dealt with many variants like आगमज अनागमज etc. I found another Varnaratna-pradipika which I am wishing to read soon after PS, and it's various commentaries. Thanks again for the help.  
  
Thanks Ramakrishnan ji, I maybe pronouncing everything correct, as I learnt it through tradition but will need to ensure.  
  
Namaste \_/\\\_
