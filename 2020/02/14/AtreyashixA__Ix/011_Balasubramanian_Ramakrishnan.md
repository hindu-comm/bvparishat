Dear Rishiji,

  

Please accept my apologies, the questions you were asking about udAtta, etc., led me to believe that you were in the process of learning.

  

First of all there were different theories about how the svarita should be pronounced even within a single shAkhA. Not sure what you follow, but the taittirIya prAtishAkhyam lists some 4 or 5 theories including one which denies the existence of enclitic svarita altogether. So there is no scope of going back and correcting what is learned from a sampradAyavit. What can be done is finding the sUtras which match what the sampradAyavit taught and use this understanding to solidify the chanting.

  

Ramakrishnan
