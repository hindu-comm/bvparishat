This seems to be an interesting work- detail here (<https://www.amazon.com/Hamburg-Atreya-Shiksha-Codex-Thirty-Six/dp/1546867198>)

1\. Could it be known if this work has been translated into any Indian language, preferably Hindi?

2\. Are there any commentaries?

Please let me know. Many Many Thanks in advance.

:) शिवमस्तु
