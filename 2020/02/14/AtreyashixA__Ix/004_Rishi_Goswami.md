Hello Deeproji,  
  
Im currently reading Paniniya Shiksha, where there are too many doubts.  
  
Like there are 2 Has in the 14 sutras, and 2 Hakars mentioned in Shiksha as Aurasya and Kanthya, can they be compared to English H (like in Horse) and Spanish J (like in Jalapeno/Juan).  
  
Anuswara Uccharana was discussed here, where it was concluded we don't pronounce it as N. But PS gives "Dantamulyah Swaranugah". दन्तमूले भवः दन्तमूल्यः and specifies when such is to be said, नित्यं होः शषसेषु च। So should we pronounce Sanshaya, Sinha, Sanyama and Dhanoonshi?  
  
Also, Udattadi question I recently asked here. I've started learning Vaidiki Prakriya and want to learn Shiksha together.  
  
Please provide other Pdfs, sources and research material.  
  
Namami  
Thanks.
