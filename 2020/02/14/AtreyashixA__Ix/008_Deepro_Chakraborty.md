Dear Rishi Ji!

  

Thanks for asking me the questions!  

  

\(1\) According to my understanding, these two hakāras (urasya and kaṇṭhya) are just allophonic variations;h when combinedwith the nasals (as in brahman, vahni, aparāhṇa etc.) and the semivowels (as in bāhya, bahvī, hrada, bāhlīka etc.) is pulmonic (urasya) and the uncombined one is guttural (kaṇṭhya). [People predicted](https://archive.org/details/PaniniyaShiksha/page/n33/mode/1up) that the double enumeration of */h/* in the Pratyāhārasūtra might indicate to the Proto Indo-European voiced and voiceless aspirates as we have in Arabic (cf. Urdu/Hindi hal (plough) andh̤āl (situation)).But I don't know about the current scholarship about it.

हकारं पञ्चमैर्युक्तमन्तस्स्थाभिश्च संयुतम्।  

औरसं तं विजानीयात् कण्ठ्यमाहुरसंयुतम्।।

This verse is quoted by Gārgya Gopāla Yajvan in his Vaidikābharaṇa commentary on the Taittirīya Prātiśākhya and it also occurs in the Yājñavalkyaśikṣā.

  

\(2\) Anusvāra has its own pronunciation which is not identical with 'n' or 'm'. Manomohan Ghosh in his edition of the Pāṇinīyaśikṣā reads the verse as:

[अलाबुवीणानिर्घोषोऽदन्तमूल्यः स्वरानुगः।](https://archive.org/details/PaniniyaShiksha/page/n137/mode/2up)

[अनुस्वारस्तु कर्तव्यो नित्यं ह्रोः शषसेषु च।।](https://archive.org/details/PaniniyaShiksha/page/n137/mode/2up)

So according to this reading (adantamūlyaḥ), which I think quite plausible, anusvāra must not be pronounced as 'n'.

In the next line, the idea is you have to pronounce anusvāra before these sounds. In case of being followed by other sounds, anusvāra can be transformed into other types of nasals.

  

Different Vedic schools have their idiosyncrasies in Vedic orthoepy and accordingly, they developed their sectarian śikṣā manuals. So, reading one manual may not work for all caraṇas and śākhās of the Vedas.

  

Please let me know exactly which materials you need. I'll send you if I have them.

  

Best wishes!
