Namaste



May I be permitted to place some inputs in this thread and leave the inference to the learned readers pl.



**1. Shikshaa and Pratishaakhya Works provide a rule description for validating a ' pronunciation' ( uccharana). They do not describe the ' physiology and rule to follow while pronunciation is made'. !**



 What this means in learning -practicing 'Veda' is to go by the protocol of ' listen- -capture sounds- make internal effort to repeat (shravana - uccharana -anooccharana) :: Learn to bring the resonance of mantra-articulation to match the teachers instruction (external validation) which needs to be mapped -experienced internally
to ' vision-sense the sounds-sequences -accents- flow'. This is technically called ' Mantra-Varna- Pravaaha' with the knowledge - Purpose technicalities of the Mantra.



 This was the technical training system of ' Gurukul, where one needs to understand the technicalities of ' shrvana, varna-swara uccharana shikshana - swaadhyaaya - anooccharana - pathana - Paraayana - Japa -
Ashta vikruti jnana '- This is the total scope of one single term ' Mantra- Viniyoga'.



 There are specific works which guides how each mantra of each veda needs to be ' articualted in viniyoga'. Rishi Shaunakas works are to be seen for this detail.



**2. Shikshaa and Pratishaakhya Works are not to be seen in isolation ! They need to be looked at in combination with Vyakarana -Chandas- Nirukta for proper utilization through ' pronunciation'. **

**We seem to have the road map of books explaining this; but seem to have a broken map to reconstruct the total bridge to traverse. **

The rules are not based on conjectures and borrowed from other language sources ! Each unit sound has its unique mode of pronunciation and benefit.



For two 'ha'- kaaras : Contemplate why two identifications are made . Explore pointers in the link <http://www.languageinindia.com/feb2004/panini.html>
