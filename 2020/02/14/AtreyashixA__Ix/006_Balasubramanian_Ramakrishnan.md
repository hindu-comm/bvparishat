Dear Rishiji

  

I do apologize if this sounds rude, not my intention at all - but learning to chant vedas by reading texts would be like a toddler waiting to be able to read and reading books on human kinematics in order to learn how to walk. The chantingis learned by going to a sampradaayavit and getting it corrected by him, and fine tuning can be done later or simultaneously by reading shikShA texts.
