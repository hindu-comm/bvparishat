Namaste Madam

  

I had to flatten out the recursions by assuming a certain number of loops, for instance by assuming that two upasargas can attach to a dhatu, to arrive at the number of words. In order to alert anyone who lands in this list that the process shown by me is only a flattened process depicted to arrive at an order of magnitude computation, I am reproducing below the more complete word formation schematic depicted in your paper:
