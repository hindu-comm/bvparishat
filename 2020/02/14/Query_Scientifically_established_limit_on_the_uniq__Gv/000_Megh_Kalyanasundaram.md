Namaste,

  

If anyone is aware of a scientifically established limit on the unique number of words a human being can include (in any language, including Sanskrit) in one piece of work in her or his lifespan and would be kind enough to share leads to any published work that deals this query, partially or completely, would be grateful.

  

Sincerely,

Megh
