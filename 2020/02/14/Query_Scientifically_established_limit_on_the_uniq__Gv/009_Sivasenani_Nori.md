I get what you mean. Here is a list of unique words in 28 classics in English:

  

|                                            |                        |                       | |--------------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------| | Book                                       | Total Words            | Unique Words          | | Common Sense                               |  24,968 |  3,972 | | Alice's Adventures in Wonderland           |  29,380 |  3,871 | | American Fairy Tales                       |  34,825 |  4,615 | | Heart of Darkness                          |  40,935 |  6,788 | | The Wonderful Wizard of Oz                 |  42,581 |  3,497 | | The Jungle Book                            |  53,836 |  5,606 | | Andersen's Fairy Tales                     |  58,388 |  6,063 | | The Mysterious Affair at Styles            |  59,529 |  6,245 | | The War of the Worlds                      |  62,930 |  7,536 | | Around the World in 80 Days                |  66,271 |  7,509 | | Treasure Island                            |  71,237 |  7,050 | | English Fairy Tales                        |  81,591 |  6,089 | | Red Cap Tales                              |  88,728 |  9,613 | | Grimms' Fairy Tales                        |  104,118   |  6,522 | | Anne Of Green Gables                       |  105,521   |  8,765 | | The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes          |  107,504   |  9,170 | | Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Complete   |  114,235   |  8,419 | | The Life and Adventures of Robinson Crusoe |  123,899   |  7,169 | | Pride and Prejudice                        |  124,535   |  7,201 | | Russian Fairy Tales                        |  133,750   |  11,923   | | A Tale of Two Cities                       |  138,836   |  11,222   | | Great Expectations                         |  187,398   |  12,713   | | Jane Eyre                                  |  188,422   |  15,350   | | Moby Dick; or The Whale                    |  215,109   |  20,612   | | The Count of Monte Cristo                  |  462,033   |  19,966   | | War and Peace                              |  566,030   |  20,878   | | Les Miserables                             |  567,952   |  26,370   | | The Complete Works of William Shakespeare  |  903,598   |  30,341   |

Going by the above, we observe that more the number of total words used, higher the count of unique words. In Sanskrit - or for that matter in pretty much any language - Vyasa would be the most productive author - having authored an epic of 1,00,000 slokas (10x Shakespeare), and then 18 puranas and 18 upa-puranas. In Telugu, Annamacharya should be the author with most words, with 32,000 kritis, each having around 100 words, that is 32,00,000 words - which is of Vyasa-like proportions! The important point of the above graph is that the number of unique words tends to peak at 30,000.

  

This is also borne out by trends observed elsewhere. Testyourvocab (<http://testyourvocab.com/blog/>) is an organization which provides an online and test of the size of ones vocabulary. Apparently the top 2% of US population (in terms of size of vocabulary) use their service. Even there, size of vocabulary seems to top off at 40,000 words.

So, the max unique words in English would be about 40k or so , as per empirical observations is what I would say, as a starting point. For Sanskrit and Telugu etc., we need to first determine the agreed authorship and then lemmatize the works of Vyasa, Annamayya etc. to arrive at the figures. These could be good projects for MA / M. Phil. students, or for students of NLP.
