For one of my purposes, I can happily let go of that additional constraint ('unique') and include a modification:

...scientifically established **limit** on the number of words a human being can include (in any language, including Sanskrit) in her or his scholarship in her or his lifespan...

To paraphrase (with some loss no doubt): at what scientifically established limit can one confidently say that because there exist X number of words in this person's body of work, all of this cannot be attributed to that one person because it is not humanely possible.

  

Best,

Megh
