Namaste Misra ji.

  

Thank you for your kind words. This was published inThe Journal of Sanskrit Academy, Vol XX, 2010. pp 243-264. Published by Sanskrit Academy, Hyderabad. (ISSN - 0976 089X) , 2010

Yes, that is true. Actually, it is a count of pratipadikas as the multiplication factors of sups was not considered. An interesting aside about verbs: I had once done an exercise of counting the number of verbs in Vedic sentences and classical Sanskrit. For this I took the bhashya of Sankaracharya on the chatussUtrI. This contained about 250 Vedic sentences. In my analysis I found that in the Vedic sentences, every eighth word was a verb, whereas in Sankara's language, every sixteenth word was a verb. To be sure this exercise was done after the paper was written, but one had an idea that verbs do not account for much of usage. It is very similar in English where every seventh word is a verb.

Satyam. It was my mistake that I overlooked this. In fact in every optional affix, one needs to add a number in the multiplier. To take an instance, if we consider two upasargas, the possibilities are three - one, the root alone; second, with one upasarga and the third, with the second upasarga.

When I counted the number was around 130, but M. R. Kale in his Higher Sanskrit Grammar lists about 70 as common. So I took that count as my intention was to use the 'common' affixes only.

The uNAdis are not very productive, that is they do not produce many words. All the 700 or so would account for less than a few thousand prAtipadikas, I would say.
