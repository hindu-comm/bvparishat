Namaste Sivasenani Garu

  

Thanks for the wonderful analysis, I was trying to do something similar a few days a go.

  

I want to cite this in an upcoming book, how can I do that?

  

A few comments

  

1\) I believe your analysis is forsubanta words only, does not include tiṅanta

2\) If we take three frequently used affixes calledsanādayaḥ (san, ṇic, and yaṅ?), should we not multiply by four and not three, as if we include the original root and three frequently used affixes?

3\) What is your source for 70 taddhita affixes? A list here lists around 135:<https://sanskrit.sai.uni-heidelberg.de/Panini/HTML/i_taddhita_0.html>

  

Would be interesting to see how things change when we include uṇādi affixes.
