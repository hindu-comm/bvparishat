Namaste Shri Korada Garu,

  

Thank you once again for your clear directions.

The mantra seems to be a Tamizh tradition that diverges from others as in vareniyam vs varenyam issue.

  

Out of curiosity how much time did it take to make an upavita from scratch?

  

Regarding Yajnopavita I remember reading somewhere that kshatriyas wore hemp and vaishyas wool(??)....since most of these people nowadays wear (if at all) without any of the nityakarmas I guess information may have been lost over time.

  

The Shankhayana Grihyasutra also opines that each varna was given a different version of the savitri--with chandas gayatri, trishtubh and jagati to the 3 orders.

  

The problem with some of these upanyaasakars is that when asked for pramana they tremble with outrage ( :( ). The same people on stage say things like "where is the pramana for this that..?"

Horses for courses...

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
