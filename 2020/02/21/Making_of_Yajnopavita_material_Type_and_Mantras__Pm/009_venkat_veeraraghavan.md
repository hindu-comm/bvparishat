Dear Shri Harish ji-

  

Would you be able to share contacts?

  

Also do you have access to the ashta bija variety?

  

Many of the traditional sciences like Ayurveda mention that like increases like by the principle of resonance. Its interesting therefore to note that the grihyasutras prescribe upanayana within the 8th year from date of conception for Brahmanas, 11th year for Kshatriyas and 12th year for Vaishyas.

  

All other samskaras (if I am not mistaken) are counted from birth and not conception.

  

Thanks,

  

Venkat
