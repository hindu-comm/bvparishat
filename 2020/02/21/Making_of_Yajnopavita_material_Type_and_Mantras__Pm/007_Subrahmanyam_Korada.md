नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Vid Venkat Veeraraghavan ---  

  

1\. \>I heard in an upanyaasam that the Yajnopavita is made from a variety of natural cotton that has 24 bijas in every cotton boll/fruit (Is there a pramaana for this?)

Google Swami opines that cotton comes in varieties of 27 to 40 seeds.\<



**कार्पासम् उपवीतं स्यात् विप्रस्योर्ध्ववृतं त्रिवृत्** --  

  

कार्पासः = cotton .

  

A विप्र should wear a यज्ञोपवीतम् having three threads made of cotton .

  

The rest is unnecessary .

  

  

2\. \>Apparently the Yajnopavita is hand woven with the following mantras:

  

TB 3-10-5-1

  

भूर्भुवः॒ स्वः॑। ओजो॒ बल॑॑म् । ....ऊर्जं॒ पृष्टिं॒ दद॑द॒भ्याव॑वृत्स्व ॥

  

Can you please give the source for the above information? \<

  

This is from the first **काठक - कृष्णयजुर्वेद - called / startingwith
-- संज्ञानम्** ।

  

( I often quote **ओजो बलम् to explain ओजःक्षय / AIDS of आयुर्वेद )**

  

It is green in my mind -- some sixty years ago my father used to spin उपवीतम्-s --- cotton - thread with a Takili

but did not notice reciting any मन्त्र । Nor do I know any प्रमाणम् ।

  

Let me confess I did not learn for some reason or the other - it consumes a lot of time to make one .

  

As every now and then we discuss -- people made simple विधि-s more and more complicated and in most of the cases , the so called ब्राह्मण-s do not know / question the प्रमाणम् । Ex - मुद्राः etc in सन्ध्यावन्दनम् ।

  

                             

  

3\. This ofcourse is the Yajnopavita for Brahmins. Is there information on material and mantras for kshatriyas and vaishyas?

Interestingly one of my friends here who is a goldsmith (Vaishya) wears a yajnopavita of cotton.

Comments please?

  

There is no any specific / separate material for उपवीतम् for क्षत्रिय-s and वैश्य-s .

  

Goldsmits ( स्वर्णकार-s -- not वैश्य-s ) etc also wear उपवीतम् ।

  

Bonus Info --

  

The मन्त्र -- यज्ञॊपवीतम् परमं पवित्रम् .... is taken from **ब्रह्मोपनिषत्** ( 108 उपनिषदः ) \|

  

यज्ञोपवीत्येव अधीयीत (one with यज्ञोपवीत only should recite वेद ) -- **तैत्तिरीयारण्यकम्-2**) \|

  

A संन्यासी should not wear उपवीतम् ।

  

धन्यो’स्मि
