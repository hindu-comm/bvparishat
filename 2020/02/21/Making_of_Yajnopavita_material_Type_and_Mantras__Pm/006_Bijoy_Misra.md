Nagarajji,

Thank you for sharing the video on spinning.

In my 4th grade (1954) and possibly 5th, we had a full period

to spin on *Takli.* The quality of thread produced was scored  

by the teacher. The production was a good test of hand-eye

coordination. It was also a function of the quality of cotton,

fresher the better.

Sweet recollection, a fun class.

Bijoy Misra
