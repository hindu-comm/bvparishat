Dear Vidvans,

  

I'd like clarification on a few points.

  

I heard in an upanyaasam that the Yajnopavita is made from a variety of natural cotton that has 24 bijas in every cotton boll/fruit (Is there a pramaana for this?)

  

Google Swami opines that cotton comes in varieties of 27 to 40 seeds.

  

Apparently the Yajnopavita is hand woven with the following mantras:

  

TB 3-10-5-1

  

भूर्भुवः॒ स्वः॑। ओजो॒ बल॑॑म् । ....ऊर्जं॒ पृष्टिं॒ दद॑द॒भ्याव॑वृत्स्व ॥

  

Can you please give the source for the above information?

  

Its interesting that we have gotten so used to getting Yajnopavita from the shops/temples that many of us have stopped enquiring closely into the process.

Although Monsanto, Bt cotton and GM are all well publicised news items, its amazing how blind one can be in not realising the obvious.

Where does our Yajnopavita truly come from?

I really dont think I want to know, but a more pertinent question would be:

Is there a place in India where Yajnopavita is made as per the rules given in dharmashastra with appropriate starting material?

If so, address and contact details would help many here.

  

This ofcourse is the Yajnopavita for Brahmins. Is there information on material and mantras for kshatriyas and vaishyas?

Interestingly one of my friends here who is a goldsmith (Vaishya) wears a yajnopavita of cotton.

Comments please?

  

Thanks,

  

Venkat
