Takhli-->

  

That word brought up a memory (not a pleasant one) of "Dravidian" hatred towards Brahmins and their way of life.

  

The relevant section is from 4.25 till 4.30 of the video sourced from a popular movie of Kamalhassan.

For those who don't understand the Tamizh:

  

"Ennangaanum Takhli noothundrukkeer" -- "What are you doing threading the Takhli" (Obvious reference to a yajnopavita)--The Tamizh here is a Tam-Brahm dialect

  

"Mayiru maadhiri theriyardhu..." --"looks like a piece of hair" (Although I have translated mayiru as hair the colloquial translation and meanings are perjorative and not complementary)

  

Enacted by 2 Brahmana bandhus...:(
