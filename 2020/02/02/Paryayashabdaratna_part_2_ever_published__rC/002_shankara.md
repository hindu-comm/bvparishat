Dhaval ji,

  

According to ED Kulkarni, Paryayasabdaratna consists of only 3 sargas viz. Urdhvalokasarga, Madhyalokasarga and Patalalokasarga. All the three sargas are there in the part 1 published by Deccan College. Moreover, the editor's preface does not mention anything about the 2nd part.  

  

regards  
shankara
