Kasumbi is orange coloured flower-PALASH flower.Extract of the flower is used to dye a cloth, as it cannot be removed by any other colour nor it is faded.

the poet is petriot, his heart is fully coloured with love for mother India. This love is inspired by several people since his birth. First of all, he is nourished by his mother's milk.That milk filled his body with love for nation. Thereafter,his sister cradled him by singing songs of Rastra-prem.

then he grew up, enemies' attacks filled his heart with valour &patriotism. The freedom fighters,mothers of freedom fighters, &starving beggars also increased his patriotism.His wife also encouraged him. the devotees who visited his his place also used to sing songs of Desh-bhakti. In this way now his heart is coloured with love for nation &this colour has become permanent like like that of Kasumbi., no other colour can take its place.
