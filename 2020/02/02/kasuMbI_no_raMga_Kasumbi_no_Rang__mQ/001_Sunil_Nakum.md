Shri Radhakrishna ji,

  

I too have heard this song by Shri Jhaverchand Meghani a well known Gujarati poet and social reformer. Earlier, I had this curiosity to know about the exact meaning of Kasumbi, but never got the correct or satisfactory answer to it, so lived with the assumption of it being indicating the spirit of bravery, valour, etc. With your post, I too am eager to gain some knowledge about it.

  

I could find a link to a chapter on someone's work [here](https://sg.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/3811/6/06_chapter%201.pdf) (also attaching the same PDF) but it's only part of it, below is relevant excerpt,

Regarded as the > elixir of life, the hue indicates the colour of life with all feelings > poured in it and symbolizes the integrated and proud human existance > rather than mere survival at any cost. >

Regards,

Sunil
