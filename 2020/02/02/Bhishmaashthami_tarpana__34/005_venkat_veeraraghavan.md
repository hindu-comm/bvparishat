One way to see what is what is to examine the text of the MB when Yudhisthira meets Krishna sees him meditating, they go to Bhishma etc and see if anyone ate or drank anything on that day.

  

If they did it cannot have been an ekadashi. I assume Bhishma gave all his upadesha on the same day....

  

Much of these observances seem to be a local tradition rather than supported by text. Unless one of the great acharyas have categoricallystated one way or the other...who can say?

My understanding that Bhishmaasthami and the tarpana has grounding in tradition.

So the ekadashi has to be a mistake or the previous paksha's (?)

I get sidetracked into something deeply interesting and tangential everytime I consult this "pestilential" book..;-)

  

<http://www.krishnapath.org/Library/Mahabharata/Mahabharata-By_Kisari_Mohan_Ganguli.pdf>

  

Here in Book 13 Section CL of the English version has a chapter that is not reflected in the Sanskrit version.

There seems a chapter missing between

<https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/mbs/mbs13136.htm>  

  

Its a real pain matching the English and the Sanskrit versions..one has to adopt a manual version of the random guessing and divide and conquer algorithms.. ;-)

  

If you have a simpler way please share..:)
