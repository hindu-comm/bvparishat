In this connection, a friend asked: "Bhishma Ashtami (Maagha shukla ashtami) is considered as the day Bhishma left his mortal coils, and we offer ekodishta shraddha or tarpana to pitamaha.  
There is also another tradition which calls Maagha shukla ekadashi as Bhishma Ekadashi, and this day Vishnu Sahasranama was revealed.  

Do you have any insights on this discrepancy?"

  

Anyone know the answer?
