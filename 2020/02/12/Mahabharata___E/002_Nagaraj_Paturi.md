Dear Sri Ravi Prakash,

  

Yes, Panda as are also Kauravas.

  

Dhaartaraashtras are also Kauravas.

  

But to highlight the point that the traditionally inherited Kuru crown remained with the Dhaartaraashtras, they were referred to as Kauravas.

  

To distinguish, Pandavas were referred to as Pandavas.
