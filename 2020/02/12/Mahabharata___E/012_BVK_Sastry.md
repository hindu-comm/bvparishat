Namaste



1. There is nothing to consider here ! Duryodhana had the same explanation based on 'Dharma Shaastra / Niyoga / Kshetra .....' themes; and best advisors who knew Dharmashastras, including Vyasa, at some point. If the argument was strong enough, the only reason for Duryodhana/ Dhrutarashtra ... and many others to step away from that advise needs explanation. Simply stating that there was a sanction from Dharma shastra, there was the 'consent, there was intervention of divine plans,.....' does not resolve the issue. The terms usage in the well retained text of Gita at least does not help to solve the problem.



There is no harm in accepting that Duryodhana raised a contentious issue for litigating and safeguarding his interest to the power- inheritance.



2. The question of Duryodhana did not point to Pandu; it pointed to the legality of 'Pandu giving the title to children for whom he was not the biological father ( Ourasatva = born out of ones own body- elements, blood lineage as they say, ,...; aatmajah....). This question was not there in Duryodhanas case.





3. Addressing Pandus children as Kauravas is a literary usage. to that extent it is covered.



any way our opinions are not changing the Mahabharata narrative.
