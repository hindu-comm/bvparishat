Sir

  

Kindly consider the following -

  

1\. According to Dharmasastra, the sons of Kunti and Madri begotten with the permission of Pandu, are indeed sons of Pandu - by Niyoga. Hence they belong to the vamsha of Kuru as well.

2\. If it is to be interpreted that Duryodhana is questioning whether the sons of Pandu are indeed Kurus, it may be remembered that Pandu and Dhritarashtra are themselves born of Niyoga. So, to be consistent, Duryodhana also cannot be a Kaurava. (Duryodhana's stand for not returning the kingdom of Pandavas is that thirteen years have not passed from the day of Vijayadashami on which the game of dice was played and the end of Vasanta Navaratri when uttara-gograhaNam occurred \[1\])

  

In light of the above, my submission is that it is perfectly valid to address the sons of Pandu as Kauravas. Otherwise, Arjuna should also not be addressed as Bharata (a very frequent form of address), as the lineage is as much that of Bharata as it is of Kuru. Avoidance of Kaurava to address Pandavas may be due to the following:

  

a\) Initially, the intent might have been to show exclusion of the Pandavas from the Kuru clan as far as right to the throne is concerned, and

b\) In later times, the initial purpose of exclusion turned into celebration of Dharma, not confuse and no more.

  

Regards

Senani

  

\[1\] Duryodhana is wrong in his contention because a) for vratas such as the one concerning vanavaasa and ajnaatavaasa, the lunar calendar should be used, not the solar calendar, and b) in such vratas - along with application in pregnancy and computation of interest - the adhikamaasas (or malamaasas) need to be counted. When the adhika-maasas during the thirteen years are counted, thirteen years were indeed completed. Bhishma points this out before the battle between Arjuna and the Kauravas commences in the Virataparva.
