Pranam to all distinguished Scholars.

  

I have a query. I want to know as Pandava-s are also the descendant of Kuru clan and Duryodhana with his 99 brothers are also associated with Kuru dynasty, then why Pandava-s are called Pandava-s not Kaurava-s in general. Is there any motive behind it. I would be happy if you clear my doubt.
