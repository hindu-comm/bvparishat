**\<Pandava/ Kaurva> - An interesting debate with deeper and complex technicalities from Samskruth Grammar Taddhita pratyaya's and implications from Dharma / Karma/ Artha-Shaastra. **

****

**( **Complex and deep rooted technical issues cannot be explained with a sutra like statement : ' The Kaurava- Padava' debate has the deep technicality of 'Taddhita Pratyaya' construction with implications on ' prajaa-tva' nirnaya for Dharma-Karma -artha - taatparya nirnaya'.

For those who comprehend the technicality of the language this much is enough to see why the statement ' Pandavas are also Kauravas' carries serious limitations**\>. **

****



The question of Duryodhana was precisely asking for verifiable evidence to decide the issue \< Pandavas are also Kauravas. \> ***On the same stature as*** \< Dhaartaraashtras are also Kauravas. \> .



The identity of ' Paandu' as a ' Kaurva' was not challenged. The challenged issues was on the derivative of this position and ' Dharma' of passing the title-identity- inheritance rights from Pandu as a 'Kaurava' to 'children of Pandu's wife, who conceived from others'. The entirety of debate is available in mahabharata.



The debatable issue being : What would be the difference between the rights of ' biological children of Pandu' compared to the ' children of Pandu's wives, to whom Pandu lent his name?



Did Pandu have the right to pass on the ' family title of Kuru- lineage' to members of family where there was no direct blood lineage'?

The issue to be decided is the continuity of ' Vamsha- Gotra-Anvaya' - Identity Inheritance framework for Claims- Rights and Duties' ?



This demands the clarity on ' The Right application of the ' Taddhita Pratyaya' as ' Tasya - apatyam - Puman' or ' gotraapatyam' or ' Tatra bhavah'. And with that the full and deeper knowledge of 'Vedanga Vyakarana' beyond Historical linguistics, Interpreting Panini under Religion frame'. 



A side question worth investigating is : What was the grammar standard of ' Vyasa's 'Mahabharata-text, Text of ' Srimad Bhagavad-Gita' and how much do they differ from 'Valmiki Ramayana in terms of Grammar framework of language :Samskrutham ( or even if it be Bhashaa ?! part) OR if one wants further narrowing of window, How did Kalidasa
understand the text of 'Valmiki and story of Kings of Raghu lineage'? Did the poet lock himself to Panini or had a language - inheritance to guard from Valmiki- Vyasa ? 



Irrespective of our preference to interpret the ancient text/s and terms
in 21st century outlook, what seems important is to understand the
'internal stability and integrity of the language grammar anchored clarity to understand the Samskruth terms in the context of usage. Surely between Mahabharata time and Panini time, there is a gap of almost three millennia; and between us and Panini, another three millennia ! The sandwich in between is the lot of history and interpretations ( with translations to challenge the language models).




 The question of Duryodhana was never answered conclusively in the text of Mahabharata. The outcome was war. 

Even in Gita, the army of Dharmaraja's fighting side is called ' Pandu-putraanaam/ Pandavaaneekam (1-2 and 3).



 Arjuna is uniquely identified as ' Pandava' ( 1-14; 1-20,). The usage ' kurunandana' in Gita (2-41; 6-43; 14-13) , kuru-sattama( 2-41), kuru-shreshtha (10-19 ) Kuru-praveera (11-48), does not make

unequivocal clear evidence to substantiate ' Arjuna is
'Kaurava' on par with ' Duryodhana'.

 Krishna addresses Arjuna by various names, including ' Pandava ( 4-35; 6-2; 11-13; 11-55; 14-22; 16-5;) Partha (18-72 ) .



 The ' kula-kshaya-krutam' war got pushed and eliminated both the ' Pandava- Kaurava' lineage identity in Bharath.

The new ' people-identity ( prajaa)- model that emerged after the war was of ' Prajaa' in 'Dharma-Rajya' where society regulation is Sanatana Dharma constitution and compliance. 

The name of 'Dharma-Raja' as the king in post war did not make Bharath a land of ' Pandavas' or restore back the ' Kuru' identity.

On the same breath, it reworded the ideal of ' Rama-Rajya' : God incarnation as Iconic Person to rule - from Valmiki's frame to ' Dharma-Rajya' where 'Society is Value-regulated by Sanatana Dharma.

 The restored ' people identity ( Prajaa) was ' Bharateeya' referring back to ' Bharatam janah' of Vedas.

Pareekshit, though the biological son of Pandava/ Arjuna' died / still-born/ and was reborn- brought back to life by the blessings of Sri Krishna who is a ' Yogeeswara' with a self-declared responsibility


given in Gita 11-18: avyayah shaashwata -dharma -goptaa, sanatanastvam purusho ; Gita 14-27: Pratishthaa ..Shaaswatasya cha dharmasya, sukhasyaikaantikasya cha.



 On \< Kauravas> ; The question leads to further exploration of
the identity of people by land and lineage. Example: People of Indian origin / descent would be Indian. Descendents of People of India migrating to different lands would be ' Non-Resident Indians'. The convention is to identify a citizen of India as ' Bhaaratiya' and not as a ' Kaurava / Pandava/ Madra / Paanchaala....'.

As the ' Kshetra' - the land anchor and context changes, the 'Dharma- Karma :: Rights, duties, responsibilities, Rites of passage' -all undergo a change. When one makes a wrong- identity claim, the outcome is a 'war'. The decision to establish the identity with proof rests
on the claimant to the title and acceptance by the community -
society - constitution (Dharma Shaastra / Artha Shaastra in this case;
Safely keep out the Moksha Shaastra issues out of this debate).
Duryodhanas claim for title of 'Kaurava' was based on claimed identity of Dhrutarashtra as a blood- lineage person of ' Kuru's.
Pandavas could not establish this claim as ' direct blood lineage of Pandu: who was as much a kaurava with equal rights as Dhrutarashtra. So Children of Kunti/ Maadri are given the name of ' Pandavas (Belonging to the family of Pandu; and not as children of Pandu).



**This is where the nicety , neatness and technicality of understanding the ' Samskrutham language, specifically for the right application of ' Taddhita Pratyayas' comes in to picture. What should be the ' apatya-pratyaya' that should be applied to explain the term ' Paandava'- Kaurava' ?** What are we taught in Vyakarana and what is to be applied in understanding the Text of Mahabharata? For Dharma shaastra, Artha shaastra and Moksha Shaastra?



If ' tasyaapatyam' is invoked, we are looking at 'Direct blood descendent' with biological parentage interpretation for Pandava- Kaurava (- like Daasharathi : son of Dasharatha; saumitir: son of sumitraa). The connected difficulty is to decide who would be ' Vruddha' in the ' gotra' ??





Or

If it is ' gotraapatya / tatra- bhavah ( resident - born and brought up in a specific place like city of madra' - invoking a remote connection by relation of ' belongingness to land and people there of
and staking claim for inheritance- residual value - remote connection by some DNA strand ' to explain Pandava-Kaurava (- like Raaghava : Sri Rama belongs to Raghu's lineage: Kalidasa says - Raghoonaam **ANVAYAM VAKSHYE**) ? What would the expression ' anivaasi- bhaaratiya / para-vaasi ( pravaasi ) bhaaratiya mean ? The challenge becomes more interesting when the ' Identity stake shifts to 'Hindu definition by plurality and freedom of faith, dismembering the debate from land and lineage' , by pushing the anchor to ' FAITH (Call it by Religion or Value, God or Guru, Text or Tradition, Parentage or Place of work-living, historic formation of a Nation as a time-line event) and map it to 'SHRADDHAA' (as ' Religion faith) from gita !



**The term ' Hindu-ja', Haindava, Hindu - Rashtra' deserve attention here.** This could open new deliberation lines to explore how traditional schools have wrestled with this challenge and integrate 'Mahabharata Characters as elevated icons beyond people who might have walked on this sacred land to lay their mortal coil at Kuru-Kshetra'.





**It may be interesting to contemplate the pandava-kaurava term explanation as a stake for family title inheritance as ' identifier' of members of family lineage (Paternal and maternal) here.**



Bhishma is respectfully referred to as ' Gaangeya' ( referring to mother- line ). Bheeshma is called ' Kuru-Vruddha' (Gita 1-12).



Karna is insulted as ' radheya' where the name ' raadhaa' is said to be the name of mother who nurtured Karna ( Athiratha is fathers name; Raadhaa is mother's name).



Krishna is respectfully worshipped as ' Devaki- Nandana / yashodaa nandana' ( both biological and nurturing mother).



Dhrutarashtra does not seem to have any preferred reference to father or mother or land related name. Same case with Pandu.



When it comes to Pandavas, as members of Pandu family, the preferred name seems to be ' Kaunteyas' (Children of Kunti) and yamalau ( twins, children of mother Maadri). Still ' Paandavas' covers both Kaunteya and Madri's children. I do not know of the origin of the popular statement ' mama- praanaa - hi - Paandavaah' attributed to Sri Krishna ?! Was Sri Krishna trying to side the 'children of Pandus, whose stake to the Kuru title was being challenged ? Was Sri Krishna having the same identity challenge :as ' Yaadava ( Yadu family related / groomed in the gokula ) ' and 'Vaasudeva (Son of Vasudeva: The king' ? See the
lineage of Sri Krishna - (71 generations ) at <https://ramanan50.wordpress.com/2014/01/29/71-generations-lord-krishna-family-tree/> . Inside Gita, Sri Krishna identifies himself with ' Vrushni' family (10-37).





When it comes to children of Dhrutarashtra, the group name is ' Kauravas' referencing to land, family lineage of ' Kuru's. The title of ' belonging to land and lineage of ' Kuru's ( and Panchalas:: refering to Draupadi as ' Paanchaali) seems to be a matter of high pride.



In this sense, the mahabharata war looks like the challenge of ' Identity continuity for inheritance- rights', more by land-tradition lineage than the parentage. The question to contemplate would be :Why was there a clash between two models of identity in the historic period : By Parentage issue ( decidedly linked to Dharma Shaastra - Marriage based) and ' belonging to and born in the specific lineage and land called ' Kuru' ?



**The relevance of this line of thinking seems to get reflected in the 'Citizenship of Nation' debate issue in almost every nation of today. Citizenship relates to the rights, duties, responsibilities of a citizen of nation and Nation's reciprocal obligation. **



**So Kaurava- Pandava debate would like the decisive struggle for ' Identity for Dharma Rashtra / Desha':: Rashtra/ Desha Dharma as a part of Raja-Dharma and Prajaa-Dharma. The articulate question emerging as**:



Is the given individual a ' prajaa of the desha / desha-ja / deshastha ( as used for brahmana community of specific places) :: Person **born** in the given identified land ( irrespective of parentage lineage by father, mother) - Kaurava

OR

Is the given individual a ' nivaasi of the desha / desha-stha :: Person **resident** in the given identified land ***AND/ OR***
carries a blood lineage connection (= Atmaja, Tanaya, Kshetra-ja) to the people of the people who stayed- lived in the given identified land
irrespective of parentage lineage by father, mother) - Pandavas.
