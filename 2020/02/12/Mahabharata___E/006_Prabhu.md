Well thought-out and analysed response Sastry-ji!

  

Just as the pancha pAnDava-s are not biological offsprings of Pandu, likewise even Dhritarasshtra, Pandu and Vidura are themselves not in the Kuru blood-line, right, due to the niyogakrama invloving Vyasa?

In the true sense of blood-line, did the Kuru vaMsha end with Bhishma? Your thoughts?

  

Regards

Prabhu
