Namaste

Students Guide To Sanskrit Composition – VS Apte - has been a wonderful book -, very useful for Samskrt aspirants. We all were very highly benefited by the path-showing work.

There has been a Hindi translation of the work for the benefit of Hindi native speakers.  

<http://www.sanskritebooks.org/2011/01/students-guide-to-sanskrit-composition-english-hindi-vs-apte/>

I wantedto know if this book has been translated into Telugu.. or any attempts are being made currently.

Likewise, same querry for Kale's higher Samskrt Grammar as well.

If no, someone is ready to take up. Hence I have put querry here.. as the elite group has many great scholars.

Thanks a lot in advance.
