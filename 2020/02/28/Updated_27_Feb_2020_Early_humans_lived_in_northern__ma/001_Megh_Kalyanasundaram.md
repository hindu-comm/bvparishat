"India is located at a critical geographic crossroads for understanding the dispersal of*Homo sapiens*out of Africa and into Asia and Oceania. **Here we report evidence for long-term human occupation, spanning the last \~80 thousand years, at the site of Dhaba in the Middle Son River Valley of Central India.** An unchanging stone tool industry is found at Dhaba spanning the Toba eruption of \~74 ka (i.e., the Youngest Toba Tuff, YTT) bracketed between ages of 79.6 ± 3.2 and 65.2 ± 3.1 ka, with the introduction of microlithic technology \~48 ka. The lithic industry from Dhaba strongly resembles stone tool assemblages from the African Middle Stone Age (MSA) and Arabia, and the earliest artefacts from Australia, suggesting that it is likely the product of*Homo sapiens*as they dispersed eastward out of Africa."
