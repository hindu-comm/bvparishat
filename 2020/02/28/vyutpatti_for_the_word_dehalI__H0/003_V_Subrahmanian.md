By 'vyutpatti', what I am looking for is something like 'शं करोतीति शंकरः'. Recently the UM pontiff had composed a shloka welcoming the Pejawar Swamiji with the word 'dehali' occurring several times with different meanings. One meaning he himself gave was 'देहः लीयते ...'
'one's linga sharira will come to an end upon the study of ....'

  

Is there any text-based vyutpatti for the term 'dehali'?
