Sir,

Is Alamkara Ratnakara written by Shovakara Mitra on Sanskrit rhetoric available in internet ? If so, Sir kindly help me by giving a link.

                    

                                   
                                   
                                Yours faithfully,

                                   
                                   
                               Ms. Sebanti Sinha.
