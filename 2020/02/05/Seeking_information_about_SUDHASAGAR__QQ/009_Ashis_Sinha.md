Sir, I am trying to read the manuscript of Alamkara Ratnakara. But it appea#rs to be corrupt in some places. However, it is my fervent request to Irene Galstian to kindly send me page No. 26 of that book if it can be scanned tomorrow.

 Waiting for the page and with regards,

 Yours sincerly,

Ms. S. Sinha.
