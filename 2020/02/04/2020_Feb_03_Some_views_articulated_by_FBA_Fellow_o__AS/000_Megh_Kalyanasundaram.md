\~18:01-19:08: "But this meta-philosophical agreement means that there is an agreed terminology, for people coming in from very different places, and whose mother-tongues would have been very different, pretend to, however, **converse in Sanskrit, which, by the 2nd or 3rd century BCE, MANAGED TO LIVE PRECISELY BY DYING.** It was a **language that was NO LONGER SPOKEN in the ordinary world**. But, because its grammar was fixed, because its roots, the root-words, were fixed, because the rules for generating words, new concepts, out of that base was fixed, there was an enormous stability to this **VERY ELITE ACTIVITY** of talking, discussing, ideas in Sanskrit." (almost verbatim) \[Emphasis added\]
