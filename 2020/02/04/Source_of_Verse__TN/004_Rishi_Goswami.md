धन्यवाद कोराडामहोदय।  
  
I was traveling in Vraj so just checked my phone today.  
  
Very glad to know about this information.  
  
I'm reading a Vaad granth, ब्राह्मणत्वादिदेवतावादः which based on a Pankti of Vallabhacharya in Subodhini. It is been made into 4 Karikas, and expanded further by Tikakars.  
  
Jagadguru Vallabhacharya believes Varnas to be Devatas, not Jatis, as they get out of the Shareera, whereas Jatis are Nitya, eka and anekanugata which are Samaveta in Vyakti.  
  
It gave rise to a doubt, if Braahmanya isnt through birth acc to Vallabhacharya, are everyone born Turiyas? Or what is the stage hence the question to the source of shloka. I couldn't find it any Smriti, I knew it was Skanda Purana but wanted to confirm if it had origins in any of the Smritis as well.  
  
Dhanyavada for Uttara \_/\\\_
