I am sharing my delight in having read the Kannada book ನನ್ನ ಪ್ರವಾಸ which is a translation (by B.Mayya) of the original Marathi book माझा प्रवास of Vishnu Bhatta Godse. The firsthand eyewitness account of the first war of independence or the sepoy mutiny, however one may call it, is thrilling to read. How an ordinary Brahmana Purohit from a village (Varasayi) in Raygadh region of Maharashtra went north to make money but made history by interacting with Rani Laxmibai, Taatyatope, Nanasaheb is the story. True to his profession the author set out as a beggar, but did not bargain his dharmic views and ethics for worldly posessions. The book should be read by anyone interested in the question of what was the Idea of India amongst traditional elites. On a different level, the author narrates how some of the Vedic rites and functions were observed in the cities and villages he visited. He narrates about a meeting of pandits held in Gwalior to argue whether Upanayanam can be conducted in the month of Ashadha (rainy month). He says that based on the "*MaitrayaNiya Parishista*" the conclave decided that the Vedic rite can be held before the Vishnu-shayana-ekadashi.

  

Incidentally recently I read a paper by Prof.Deshpande (kindly shared by the author) about the migration of MaitrayaNiya-shakha followers from north to south. Within a few days mention about Maitrayaniya Parishishta as above came to my notice. My question to scholars here: Is theMaitrayaniya Parishishta known to academic community? Any information about this text would be welcome.
