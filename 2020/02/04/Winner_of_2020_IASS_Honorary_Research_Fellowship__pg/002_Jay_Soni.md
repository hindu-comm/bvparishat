Dr. Iris Iran Farkhondeh obtained her PhD in Indology from the University Sorbonne Nouvelle – Paris 3 in 2017. She has spent six months as a Gonda Fellow in Leiden to work on her critical edition of an 11^(th)century Sanskrit satire about courtesans, namely the*Samayamātṛkā*written by the Kashmirian author Kṣemendra*.*She had translated this satire into French as part of her dissertation on “The representation of female characters in the Sanskrit literature of Kashmir, 8^(th)-12^(th)centuries” (under the supervision of Prof. Nalini Balbir). She is currently a postdoctoral fellow of the Cluster of Excellence “Understanding Written Artefacts: Material, Interaction and Transmission in Manuscript Studies” in Hamburg. Her research project is focused on the diachronic study of Sanskrit manuscripts written in Kashmir in the Śāradā script. The first step of her project consists in the description of dated Śāradā manuscripts in a database that she plans to share online. Her study of the Kashmirian manuscript culture will contribute to date undated manuscripts. She is organising a workshop on Śāradā manuscripts which will take place on the 6^(th)and 7^(th)of March 2020 at the Centre for the Study of Manuscript Cultures in Hamburg.
