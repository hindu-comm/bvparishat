Dear Satyavratas !

  

I am attaching my full presentation used during my debate with Sri Nilesh Oak. My sincere appreciations to the event organizers Sri Harikiran Vadhlamani ji, Rithwik ji and Sri Nilesh ji for this event. Let it trigger a fruitful discussion regarding the dating of Mahabharata and the larger problem of the Bharatiya Veda-Itihasa-Pauranic Chronology.

  

My notes on the presentation:-

  

  

Attached pdf is the full presentation of my debate with Sri Nilesh Oak on the date of Kurukshetra War on 02-02-2020 (the date is a palindrome :-! the first global palindrome day in 909 years, the old one being 11-11-1111)

  

I have introduced the theory and concept of **habitable zones** of Kurukshetra War dates based on genealogy, technology evolution,
dwaraka excavations & bathymetry, Sarasvati dry up, monsoons and climatology, IE linguistics and language evolution, miscellaneous other minor factors, and then plotted the dates proposed by various MBH chronology researchers including Vartak, Nilesh Oak, Vedveer Arya,
Holey, Kota Venkatachalam, Jayasree Saranathen, Deiter Koch, Saroja Bala, Sadananda, Narhari Achar, Manish Pandit, Balakrishna, Mohan Gupta, Ashok Bhatnagar, Ramamoorthy, Iyengar, PR Sarkar, VS Dube and BB Lal in time axis, to see how they fall within these habitable zones or stays out of them.

  

Result is for all to see. Except for Nilesh and Vartaks 5561 BCE, other dates falls safely within one or other habitable zones.

  

I also insist, an archao astronomy date, however great it is, cannot be the final word about the date of kurukshetra war. It should align closely with genealogical, technological, archaeological,
bathymetrical, climatological and linguistic data.

  

If you go by the **chronology revision** suggested by Sri Vedveer Arya (changing sheet anchors like the date of Buddha Nirvana 1382 years further deep into the past from 483 BCE to 1865 BCE), then all the dates in the range of 2500 BCE to 3200 BCE (Vedveer, Holey, Saroja Bala, Pt. Kota Venkatachalam, Traditional date, Jayasree, Sadananda, Achar, Manish Pandit, Balakrishna) gets in to the habitable zone defined by the **genealogical analysis**; if not, the dates between 1000 BCE to 2000 BCE (Mohan Gupta, Ashok Bhatnagar, K Ramamurthy, RN Iyengar, PR Sarkar, and more or less Deiter Koch) gets into the habitable zone defined by the genealogical analysis.

  

In the habitable zone defined by **technology evolution** (horses, wheels, chariots), dates later to 4000 BCE like that of Manish Pandit and Achar gets in, when the sole criteria is horse domestication, but when light weight war chariots with spoked wheel, driven by war horses is considered, the dates between 1000 BCE to 1800 BCE (or if stretched up to 2000 BCE) only make sense based on the current archaeological excavation data. The dates of Bhatnagar, Ramamurthy, Iyenger, Koch and Mohan Gupta is falling in this habitable zone.

  

In the habitable zone defined by **bhathymetric studies** and Dwaraka underwater excavations, dates likeIyengar (1478 BCE) upto that of Achar (3067 BCE) are inside going by the date of excavated pottery. But putting more stringent conditions like the submergence event of 1500 BCE and dating of the city state at 1500 BCE, only dates close to 1500 BCE like Iyenger and Ramamurthy makes sense.

  

The **climatology** (including Sarasvati drying up and monsoon changes) habitable zone admits dates of Mohan Gupta, Bhatnagar, Ramamurthy and Iyenger inside.

  

IE **lingustics** and language evolution based habitable zone admits all dates except the dates of Nilesh / Vartak placed at 5561 BCE.

  

This is my unbiased, dispassionate and sincere analysis based on the currently available information at my hand in the multi-disciplinary fields, that I am familiar with. Experts in each respective field can indeed add on or correct my assumptions.

  

Going forward, it will be good to form two groups of Mahabharata chronologists:- one group following the chronology revision suggested by Sri Vedveer Arya. These dates are centered around 3000 BCE. The Traditional Date (3138 BCE) also falls here, so do dates of Achar, Manish and other friends.

  

The other group can ignore or refute this chronology revision. The dates between 2000 BCE to 1000 BCE falls in this group. The dates of friends like Mohan Gupta, Ashok Bhatnagar and Ramamurthy falls in this group.

  

The first group, I call for simplicity the **3K group**. The second group, for simplicity I call as **1K2K group**. I wish the 3K group debate and discuss among themselves and arrive at the best date. Similarly the 1K2K group can debate and discuss among themselves and arrive at the best date. There can also be inter-group debates to refute or accept the chronology revision suggested by Sri VedVeer Arya.

  

My view is that we will either get a well refined date in the 3K group or a well refined date in the 1K2K group as the final date of Kurukshetra War.

  

This way we can all be party to solve the greatest civilization-riddle of our current times, by putting a strong date for the Kurukshetra war vetted and fire-tested by multi-disciplinary studies, for our future generations, and for our children to study in their school books.
