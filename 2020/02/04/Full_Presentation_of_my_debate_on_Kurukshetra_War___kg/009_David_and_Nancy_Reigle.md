Dear Prof. Deshpande,

  

Thank you for your continued thoughtfulness and kindness in posting articles such as this one. Probably many of us benefit from them. Wondering if you happen to also have Part II of this article? Part II was published in Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 77, No. 4 (Oct. - Dec., 1957), pp. 266-280. Hope this request does not cause you to go to any trouble over it.

  

Best regards,

  

David Reigle

Colorado, U.S.A.
