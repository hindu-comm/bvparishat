Dear Manish ji

  

Pranamam!

  

Your date is a strong contenter, especially now strengthened by Vedeer's proposed chronology revision based on changing the sheet anchors like the date of Buddha Nirvana by pushing it into past by more than a millennium.

  

The way forward for you will be to convince those researchers who are not accepting this chronology revision. Veedver will have to explain how such a large descrpency in chronology survived till date. The push back is not decades or centuries but more than a millennium so that it will be resisted with a lot of hard data, discussions and debate.

  

This way, making 3067 bce date fall into the genealogy habitable zone can be taken care of, by the works of Vedveer Arya based on his success in proving it convincingly.

  

Other tasks will be to push the 3067 bce date deep into the heart of the habitable zones defined by technology evolution, bathymetry + dwaraka excavation and climatology + sarasvaty dry up. Your date is not as far,
as that of 5561 BCE date,from any of these habitable zones.So the difficulty to do this is lesser in comparison to attempt to push 5561 bce into these habitable zones. Your date is already inside the habitable zone defined by IE linguistics unlike the 5561 date which is out and far away.

  

Or conversely, the task will be to extend these zones based on arguments or future insights to embrace the 3067 bce date.

  

Thanks and Warm Regards

Jijith
