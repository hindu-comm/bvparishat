Dear Satyakamkshi Krishna Kumar Pillalamarri ji

  

Arriving at a date for the war, based on "astronomical data, both embedded in Mahabharata text as well as other sources" is precisely what is meant by **archao astronomical analysis.**

  

Did you fail to understand that every mahabharata date I have plotted in all the slides ARE the final results of archao astronomy based researches of multiple researchers (except a few like Dr BB Lal)? Could you please read the slides in detail, especially the slide number 14 where the archao astronomy based date of Nilesh Oak's at 5561 BC is refuted?

  

So basically i am taking the final results of the kind of analysis you referred and corroberating those results and showing you how each of these dates are positioned with respect to the other disciplines in order to subject them with the test of fire.

  

Kindly notice that my name is Jijith Nadumuri Ravi, not Agarwal.

  

Regards

Jijith
