Dear Shri Agarwal,

  

You seem to have considered several aspects of dating except Astronomical data, both embedded in Mahabharata text as well as other sources. This at once gives confirmation on the date of Kurukshetra war as well as confirm our puranas as source of genealogy.

  

Regards,

  

Krishna Kumar Pillalamarri
