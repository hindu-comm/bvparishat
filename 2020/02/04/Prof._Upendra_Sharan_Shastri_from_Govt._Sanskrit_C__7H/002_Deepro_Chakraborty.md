Dear Mrinal,

  

Thanks for your informative response. I did check your book which is very useful for my work, especially the introduction and the details of manuscripts. I wouldn't have known that there are some copies of Bālabodhinī in the National Museum, Delhi unless you mentioned that.

  

It is great to know that people are interested to work on the Kātantra texts which is quite a neglected area in Sanskritic researches in recent years. We had a very active and productive community of Kalāpa scholars in East Bengal. But the tradition seems to be entirely lost now. On the other hand, many Indologists are working on various genres of texts from Kashmir. But I barely see anyone working on the Kashmiri Kātantra texts. There is merely an incomplete edition of Ugrabhūti's Śiṣyahitā by Ramsagar Mishra in the 90s from Delhi. But this edition doesn't answer many questions. Yiming Shen, a student at University of Oxford transcribed a section of Chucchuka Bhaṭṭa's Laghuvṛtti that was in the Bodleian Library. If you know any recent work of Kashmiri Kātantra texts please let me know.

  

The older descriptive catalogues of the Asiatic Society Bengal do not include an entry of the Bālabodhinī. But there are some new descriptive catalogues of the Indian Museum Collection manuscripts which I haven't checked yet.

  

Also, I would like to ask you about the process of requesting copies of Sanskrit manuscripts from Kashmir University. Any idea?

  

Warm regards,

  

Deepro
