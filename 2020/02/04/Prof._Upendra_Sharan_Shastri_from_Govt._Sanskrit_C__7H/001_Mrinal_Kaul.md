Dear Deepro,

  

No grammatical work of Jagaddhara Bhaṭṭa (c. 1350 CE) has so far been published. I have at least referred to all his available grammatical works in my Introduction to the book "Linguistic Traditions of Kashmir" that I had the privilege of editing with Aklujkar Sir. I have also given the details of availability of the Mss of these texts wherever possible in the appendices of the book. Jagaddhara's commentary titled *Bālabodhinī*on the *Kātantra-vyākaraṇa/sūtra* is quite colossal. I can only recall Dr Ratna Basu from Calcutta University was interested in working on Jagaddhara's *Bālabodhinī* and she had also promised me a paper for the volume that never arrived to me. I recall she and Prof Karunasindu Das saying (if I can trust my memory) that there are a few Mss of the *Bālabodhinī* in the Asiatic Society. I never checked, but this does sound interesting to me in the sense that there was some transmission ofJagaddhara's*Bālabodhinī* in Bengal after 14th CE. But one can only confirm this if the *Bālabodhinī* really travelled to Bengal.

  

Best wishes.
