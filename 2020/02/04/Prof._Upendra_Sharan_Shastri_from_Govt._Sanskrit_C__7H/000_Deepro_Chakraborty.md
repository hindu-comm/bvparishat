I am looking for some information about this Sanskrit professor from **Ujjain**.

  

He was a professor at the Government Sanskrit College, Mahakal Mandir, Ujjain (Government Manmal Mimraj Ruyia Sanskrit College?). Yudhishthir Mimamsak met him on July 10, 1976, in Ujjain. See the details [here](https://archive.org/details/SanskritVyakaranShastraKaIthasPartIIIYudhishthirMimansak_201806/page/n111/mode/2up). According to Mimamsak, he was doing research on **Jagaddhara Bhaṭṭa**, a fourteenth-century Kashmiri grammarian. I am also interested in Jagaddhara. He wrote a couple of texts on grammar and a Śaiva devotional text called Stutikusumāñjali.

  

I was wondering if anyone is aware of the works of **Prof. Upendra Sharan Shastri** (if any) or at least can tell me the way to find more about him.
