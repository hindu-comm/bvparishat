This article and many of this kind that influence the popular netizen audience come from writers not trained in the field of Linguistics that is required to deal with such topics.

  

This writer is confused and is confusing the audience regarding the origin and influence. Gujarati's origin from a dialect of the Sanskrit-Prakrit language identified as Sanskrit and it getting influenced by languages like Arabic, Persian, for that matter, English at a much later part of the history after the origin.

  

What is politically motivated is the creating of the impression that Urdu is the language spoken by all Muslims in India and as such promotion of Urdu is promotion of Islam. Facts such as Gujarati being the language spoken by Gujarati Muslims is part of many other facts such as the local languages of different regions being spoken by Muslims different regions of India.
