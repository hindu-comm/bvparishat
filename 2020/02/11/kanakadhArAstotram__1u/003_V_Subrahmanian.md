Dear Shankara ji,

  

It appears to me that this is not a Sanskrit commentary. The name of the commentary is 'Sriphalavyaakhyaa', in Telugu. The commentator, is apparently by name 'KaashiboTla Subrahmanya-ganesh-kumar' He has named the Kanakadhara stotram 'SrIkarIstuti'. I saw a few Lalita sahasra nama names and many tantra, etc. quotations in the complete Telugu commentary. At the end he signs off by saying 'Sriphalavyaakhyaa samalankruta, (in Telugu) which is a Yoga shaastra nidhi and upanishadartha pratipaadaka..Shankara kruta srikarIstuti samaaptamu'.
