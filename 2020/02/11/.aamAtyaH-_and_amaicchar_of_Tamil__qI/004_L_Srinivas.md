The tirukkuṛaḷ does have reference to it. It has an adhikāra called 'amaiccu' meaning 'minister' - verses 631-640. The Tamil Lexicon cites Skt 'amātya' as the etymology for this word.  

  

There are also other references in literature e.g., to amātyakula, a community of Brahmanas.  

  

Hope this helps.,
