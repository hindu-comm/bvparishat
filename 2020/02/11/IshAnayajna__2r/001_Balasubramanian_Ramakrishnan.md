I haven't heard of an IshAnayaj\~na, but there is an IshAnabali prescribed by the Apastamba-gR^ihya-sUtra. You can find the mantras on page 183 -<https://archive.org/stream/apastamba/EkagniKandam#page/n183/mode/2up>and the commentary of haradatta<https://archive.org/stream/ApastambaGRhyasUtraHaradattaAnukUlaSudarshanaAchAryaTAtparyadarshanaChinnasvAmI1926/Apastamba-gRhyasUtra-sudarshana-Acharya-tAtparyadarshana-mahAdeva-shAstrI#page/n279/mode/2up>
