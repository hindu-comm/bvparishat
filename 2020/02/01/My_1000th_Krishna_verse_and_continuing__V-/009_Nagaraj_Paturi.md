\> I want to acknowledge my debt to BVP for providing an appreciative and at times a critical forum for my Sanskrit poetry. My continuing inspiration to write these verses is due in large measure to the continuing appreciation from all of you. Again, I thank you all for keeping me going.

  

-- I appreciate this acknowledgement from Prof. Deshpande. I can see this acknowledgement coming from the heart because Prof. Deshpande continued sharing the verses only on BVP while discontinuing on the other list midway. This definitely , I think, is on account of the participation from only the BVP members .

  

BVP congratulates Prof. Deshpande while feeling proud of what it has been acknowledged for by him.
