Thank you, Bijoy Ji, and all my BVP colleagues who have expressed their appreciation of my Krishna verses. I want to acknowledge my debt to BVP for providing an appreciative and at times a critical forum for my Sanskrit poetry. My continuing inspiration to write these verses is due in large measure to the continuing appreciation from all of you. Again, I thank you all for keeping me going. While I have not given up my interests in academic scholarly writing, the Krishna verses have given me an incomparable joy. With best regards,
