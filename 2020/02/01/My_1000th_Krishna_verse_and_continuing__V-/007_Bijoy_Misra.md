Madhavji,

First, congratulations.

I have always felt and now I believe it to be true that a stanza comes with its melody

in composition. You can make a contribution to the poetic literature by reciting

a few selected stanzas as they appeared to you. Possibly many stanzas may come

together to make a neurological sentence. Now, I have the rare opportunity to request

a poet to also add the melody to the chhanda. You may consider for the future

science.

माधवोऽहं कृष्णभक्तः दिव्यं पश्यामि सर्वतः।  
गुणज्ञानरसप्रेमः अमृतसागरभावः॥

Best regards,

Bijoy
