"Epistemicide is happening when an Indian scholar who identifies as a transnational feminist feels not only compelled but justified in accusing me (on social media) of being an inauthentic progressive activist because she has discovered that I have a Guru, who is literally my teacher of indigenous Indian knowledge. She has conflated my study of these epistemologies with me being a mindless lemur following a saffron-robed trickster, which is how she reads “Guru”."
