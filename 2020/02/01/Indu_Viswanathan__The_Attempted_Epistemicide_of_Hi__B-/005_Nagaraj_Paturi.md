A saying x = m , while x = l, is a misrepresentationof x by A.

  

Having a Guru and being a progressive activist is not mutually contradicting for Smt Indu Vishvanathan-ji.

  

The 'Indian scholar who identifies as a transnational feminist' is not allowing Indu-ji reach her audience by labeling her as 'not progressive' 'inauthentic' etc., on account of having a Guru.

  

This 'not allowing to reach her audience' is akin to killing her approach to knowledge.

  

Hence the word 'epistemicide', I think.
