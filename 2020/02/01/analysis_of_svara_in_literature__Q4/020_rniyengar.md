Dear Professor Deshpande,

  

Thanks for your explanation. Your reference to समानयमे उच्चैरुदात्त: नीचैरनुदात्त: समाहार: स्वरित:. is educative for me. Some times in ancient texts same words are used in different shades of meaning that can be followed only by the context and comparison. In the ऋग्वेद प्रातिशाक्यम् we read सप्तस्वरा ये यमास्ते(13.44). Here also perhaps Yama should be taken to mean the same register/octave as having the seven musical notes, following UvvaTa's commentary.

  

Best regards

  

RN Iyengar
