I had seen that. I will visit again.

The question is what we might call स्वर distortion क्षय.

We know that each individual has a different voice and so the normality

of the voice is confined to the individual. This is easily observed empirically.

So an uttered word would sound differently for two different individuals while

the cognitive value would be the same. And then the word itself would have

a built in pitch composition to render cognition to expression.

We have to distinguish between the distortion through the muscles (disease or absence)

and cognitive rendering.

I do appreciate the pointers. Need more help.
