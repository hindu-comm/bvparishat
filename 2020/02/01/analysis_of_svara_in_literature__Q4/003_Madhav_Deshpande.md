To my knowledge, the Saṅgītaratnākara talks about musical notes (svaras) and Rasa, but not the Svaras in the sense of Udātta, Anudātta, Svarita etc. Referring to these Svaras, that have now been retained only in Vedic recitation, the Sanskrit poetics says: काव्यमार्गे स्वरो न गण्यते । The absence of these Svaras in poetry allows for features like Śleṣa, which could otherwise be differentiated in some cases with the difference in Svara.
