A musical note as a forced phonetic melody could be an incorrect interpretation of Paninian स्वर.

The स्वर is built into the breathing and manifests the state of the consonant that is being expressed.

In a biological sense, a व्यञ्जन may have a spectrum of ways of expression depending on the thought.

Out of this spectrum certain registers are detected by the human ears.
When we link a musical  

note to a syllable we try to simulate a भाव which would otherwise be natural (Bharata)

So has been my thinking lately.

  

I still want to check any स्वर literature that might exist from the grammar and recitation point of view.

We may possibly reverse engineer to भाव from the राग (the score).
