Dear Professor Iyengar,

  

  Pāṇini's definitions of Udātta, Anudātta, Svarita etc. are the same for his Vedic accent rules and the accents that apply to Bhāṣā derivations. It is my assumption that the rendering of Udātta etc. became increasingly musicalized in the traditions of recitation, and especially in the Sāmavedic traditions. Nāradī Śikṣā clearly relates Udātta etc. to musical notes. Patañjali's descriptions of Udātta etc. is interesting: समानयमे उच्चैरुदात्त: नीचैरनुदात्त: समाहार: स्वरित:.
The term Yama refers to register. Within the same register, उदात्त is \[relatively\] high, अनुदात्त is \[relatively\] low, and स्वरित is a combination of high and low. But the registers change from person to person, and there is no absolute definition of high and low, till these notes get musicalized, as it is seen in the Nāradī Śikṣā. In my observation, the range of high and low in the Vedic recitation of the Maharashtrian reciters is relatively narrow compared to the range of the south Indian reciters. In that sense, high and low are relative, rather than absolute. In various recitational traditions, they may indeed get locally settled to specific notes. I am not an expert in Greek, but from what I have read about the Greek accent, the Udātta of the Vedic words corresponds to the accented syllable in the Greek cognate words, and hence the accents may go back to a common ancestry. Someone with better knowledge of Greek can say something in more details.
