Dear Dr.Irene,

I am amazed at the deep and varied interest you have in Indian Culture, History, Music, Philosophy, languages and what not !

  

I have been interested in (intellectual) understanding of one particular mode of Hindu classical music called "ālāpanam/ālapti/ālāp" in which there is no accompanying percussion instrument nor any song articulated through texts in any language. But the aural patterns weaved by a maestro are so beautiful, ālāpanam is considered to be the pinnacle of classical rendering of a Rāga. This character of language independence can be traced back to Sāmagāna where the meanings of the words (based on the Ṛgveda hymns) are subservient to the pitch positions (mainly Svaras
that are actually vowel-sounds). The approach I have taken is to essentially do a literature review of Sanskrit texts (Aitareya; Śāṅkhāyana āraṇyaka, JUB, Lāṭ. Śrau.sū, Nāradīya, BNS, SR, etc. etc) to understand how the technicalities of this *language independence of aesthetics (Rasa) is comprehended,* *recognized and described to be rendered as*Rāga.The preliminaries of this was published in 2018 in IJHS.

An update of the above work with first level extension to the Vedic part is due to appear as a book chapter. I will share a draft of this privately.
