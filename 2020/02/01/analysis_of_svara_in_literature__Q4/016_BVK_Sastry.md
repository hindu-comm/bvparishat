Namaste



This 'swara-analysis' and ' language related modeling' has been a contentious issue. Every academic (western and oriental) explaining 'Swara-related Samskruth' seems to pick a deviant stand from the 'traditional view point ' ! May be the issue needs a more focused debate.



***Traditional position***: 

(1) 'Swara' is an ' integral vision-audition' in the 'Veda Mantra/sukta' of all four Vedas. The language of 'Vedas' / marked as ' Chandas' is not human societal / natural / spoken language.



 The ' triaswarya' model documented / used in Vyakarana - (Vedanga ) Panini is not a limit on 'swaras' in 'Veda suktas- Mantra Viniyoga'. 

 Shikshaa is the Vedanga which deals with the 'Varna- Swara, maatraa, bala, saama, santaana' aspect of ' (Brahma-)Akshara' (= Veda-akshara).



(2) Praatishaakhyas are veda specific.



(3) The tradition of learning 'Vedas', as mentioned in Sayana Veda Bhashya in the frame of Praatishaakhyas' ( or by Shikshaa / Vedanga model) seems to have been deserted even the traditional Guru-Kul schools; as a consequent of embracing 'Colonial model Vedic studies.



 On the same count, the pedagogy of studying Panini's work also
seems to have been derailed from the purpose for which it is said to have been promulgated and endorsed by Patanjali.

 Samskruth Vyakarana studies does not seem to have taken a strong position to defend the ' Sa-swara Veda -Shabda/ Pada'.



(4) The osmosis of ' Swaras' of ' Bhashaa (Sanskrit/ Paninian language)' to ' Natural social Languages called 'Prakrits and derivatives' needs a systematic research using the surviving ' usage of languages'.

 In many cases, the surviving 'Prakrit' samples (Scripted in devanagari / anglcized writing) may need a rigorous clean up from several intrusions like: local language influences, anglicization,
inaccurate teaching transmissions over a period of time. ( The reverse of refining Prakrit sounds to approximate to Bhashaa Sanskrit is also a factor to be considered).
