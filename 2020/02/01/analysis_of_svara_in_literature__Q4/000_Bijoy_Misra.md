Dear friends.

Good morning. I wish to request the group to get a pointer on स्वर literature

in Sanskrit in as many dimensions as possible. We know that Panini

talks about the grammar of the Vedic स्वर. There could be both empirical and

analytic literature to connect रस to स्वर. Charaka talks about disease diagnosis

by studying the voice impairment. We observe this in our normal life.

I thank you all in advance.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
