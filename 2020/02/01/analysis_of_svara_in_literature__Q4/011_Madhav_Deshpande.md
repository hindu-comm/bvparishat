Dear Professor Iyengar,

  

  Thanks for that clarification. The original Svaras \[Udātta/Anudātta/Svarita\] of the Vedas and spoken Sanskrit \[as described by Pāṇini\] are accents of a natural language, and the Udātta of Sanskrit words corresponds to the accent of the cognate Greek words.
These natural accents of the language were transformed into musical notes especially in the Sāmavedic tradition. The Nāradī Śikṣā is an important text explaining this transition. Looking forward to the outcome of the research project described by you. Have you looked at Wayne Howard's study of the Samavedic recitation? If I remember correctly, it records variations in Sama recitation among different reciters and in different regions. With best regards,
