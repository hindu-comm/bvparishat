Dear Professor Deshpande,

Thanks for your inputs. I am aware of the field work of Howard. I have read some of his articles. His book; I am yet to read critically. I am quite familiar with Nāradīya Śikṣā, with commentary, including its critical edition by U. Bhise.

  

The A,S,U of RV are pitch-accents, that is they are at some particular frequency ratios. This can be easily verified by the spectrum of RV recordings. Way back in 1938 Ramachandran made the first attempt
(***Ragas of Karnatic Music, by N.S.Ramachandran Univ. Of Madras 1938***.) for RV recitation.He analysed using a hand held frequency meter for Tamilnadu RV chanting A/S=9/8 and U/S=10/9 in terms of their basic frequencies as harmonic sound waves. We have found with longer recitations and with more sophisticated algorithms, for both Mysore and Kanchi RV chanting the ratio of the sharp well defined peak frequencies are A/S=1.11 and U/S=1.15, up to two decimal accuracy. The Kerala style did not fit into this pattern, the spectrum is broad. This needs more detailed and careful study.

  

Could you kindly elaborate your statement:

  
"The original Svaras \[Udātta/Anudātta/Svarita\] of the Vedas and spoken Sanskrit \[as described by Pāṇini\] are accents of a natural language, and the Udātta of Sanskrit words corresponds to the accent of the cognate Greek words."

  

How to argue that RV Vedic pitch-accents were in vogue in spoken Sanskrit also? Some styles (like the Abhiri woman selling तक्रं ) might have been present but were they pitch-accented or loudness-modulated? About the correspondence between Sanskrit Udātta and cognate Greek word accent, is this conclusion based on continuous spoken Greek tradition or on some other basis?

  

with kind regards

  

RN Iyengar
