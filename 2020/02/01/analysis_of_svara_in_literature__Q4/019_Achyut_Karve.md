Dear Vidwans,

  

This discussion appears to be based on conjectures in the absence of a thorough understanding of practice or प्रयोग.

  

How can one identify the precise effort in udatta and anudatta in the absence of an understanding of the effort invested in phonating the swarita which is a union of udatta and annudata leave alone how these three were modulated to get the swaras of Sama?

  

The question of deciphering or resolving swara with the help of any instrument only comes after one has clinically identified its uniqueness.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
