Dear Shri Srinivasakrishnan,

  

  Another very valuable article is by Leonid Kulikov of Leiden University:

  

"Language vs. grammatical tradition in Ancient India: How real was Pāṇinian Sanskrit?

Evidence from the history of late Sanskrit passives and pseudo-passives"

Folia Linguistica Historica 34 (2013), 59–91.
