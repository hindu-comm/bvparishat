Dear friends,

  

As I am reading the Mahabharatam (MB) in old age, I am cursing myself as to why I did not do it when I was young, facing problems and dilemmas.

  

There is a great passage in the Udyoga parva in which there are three peace missions between the Pandavas and the Kauravas.The first emissary was from the Pandavas. He went andconveyed that the kingdom which was snatched deceitfully had to be given back, as per the conditions of the game. The other party did not consider this, but sentan emissary, Sanjaya, who conveyed the message of Dhritarashtra. The old, blind king was doing what we may now call psy ops on the Pandavas.The messenger went and told -' you are all mighty warriors, who can face you in battle - Krishna is on your side - Arjuna has divine weapons with him -all the while your reputation has been spotless - why spoil your fame by killing us - you please stay back - you will attain a lot of sin by killing all of us, etc. There is no talk about giving back the kingdom.

I have very briefly summarized the episode. This psy ops worked on great fighters like Bhima and Arjuna (who were advocating peace when Krishna was about to go as a messenger. (Arjuna was again in a moral dilemma in the battle field). But the unglamorous character Yudhishtira was clear. He told Sanjaya - "Sir, we are expected to see truth when adharma wears the mask of dharma and makes dharma look like adharma" (ch 26-2). The whole episode makes a great reading. My respect for Yudhishtira grew after reading it. (Yudhi = in battle, sthira = firm). He asked for five villages. He knew when to fight and when not to fight.



Moral confusion can lead to inaction.Recently, while listening to the TV debates and to our LW intellectuals talking about 'ekam sat, vipra bahudha vadanti' or 'vasudhaiva kutumbakam' etc., I was reminded of this episode. The NY times article also has talked in the same way about the collapse of great traditions of tolerance. They are not talking about the security of the country or about the legality of CAA but they are asking us to live in our glorious one-way ideals.
