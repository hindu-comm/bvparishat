Very true.

Sending Sanjay itself was a recon mission.

And Yuddhishthir's first question points to this. After Sanjay gives lecture on dharma to dharmarAja himself, Yuddhishthir asks:

**What have your heard of my statements, which reveals my desire for war?**  

  

This also exposes the fact that Kauravas have already started thinking of war. (I am forgetting exact reference, but I think Krishna says to Pandavas, and tells them to be ready, since the Kauravas are planning for war)

  

Krishna's also scolds Sanjay for giving lectures of Dharma to Dharmaraja. And of talking too much and unconditional 'peace' while being a kshatriya. Krishna asks, whether for a king's duty is deliveredby engaging in battle or running from it? (Sometimes, it becomes inevitable, and then the king should not run away from it)

  

  

  
  

Thanks,
