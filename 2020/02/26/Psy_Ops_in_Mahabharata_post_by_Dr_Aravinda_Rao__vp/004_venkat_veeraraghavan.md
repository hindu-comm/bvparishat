Beautiful post!

  

MB is required reading in order to understand dharma and achara.

  

Interestingly there is a negative trend in Tam Brahm households against the reading of MB at home. Apparently this leads to internecine conflict as per the wise "maamis" who come in the exclusive parampara of "paatti-dharmashastra"....Endless arguments lead nowhere. Countering with "Does a parayana of Ramayana invite the prospect of vanavaasa" is lost on the cognoscenti and is an invitation to being labelled a black sheep and an incurable "ashadu..avan sonna pecchai ketka maattaan!".

  

  

I had to go through elaborate charades and sneaky tricks to include the MB into my daily reading.

  

There is nothing unglamorous about Yudhisthira who is a shining beacon of otherworldliness along with Harischandra.

  

Yudhisthira is an example of what happens when a good man's patience and decency is returned with malice and humiliation.

Yudhisthira was one of a select band of Maharathis who had the knowledge and ability to use the Brahmaastra.

If Yudhisthira had ordered Bhimasena to kill just 4 people when Draupadi was dragged into the Rajyasabha of Hastinapura, the matter would have ended then and there. I sincerely doubt even Dhritaraashtra or Gandhari would have had a problem given the context.

  

His patience resulted in the extermination of the kshatriya class to the tune of 1.66 Billion warriors (not people but warriors--almost all of them men..with the exception of Shikhandin)  
சாது மிரண்டால் காடு கொள்ளாது!

  

There is something to be said for the meekness of those that are weak, but to be possessed of superhuman strength, virtue and to exercise forbearance in the face of duplicity, malice and humiliation from the hands of those of meagre power and mean minds shows true Mahapurusha lakshana.

As Hidimbi said:

आपत्सु यो धारयति ध्रमं धर्मविदुत्तमः।  

One that maintains his virtue in a season of distress is the foremost of the virtuous!
