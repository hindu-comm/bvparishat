\> The latter part of sarga 14 and sargas 15-17 in Cowell's 1893 edition were  
\> written by the Nepalese pandit Amṛtānanda, who transcribed the original  
\> palm-leaf manuscript in 1830. He added these because the original palm-leaf  
\> manuscript available to him was incomplete. Thus this material is not part  
\> of the original text. The first 24 verses of sarga 1 in Cowell's edition  
\> are also later additions, and thus are not in Johnston's edition.  
  
  

Perhaps I may add a few more details to this important note by David Reigle. The following verses **in the text of Cowell's *Buddhacarita***, which are missing in Johnston's manuscript A, do not belong to the original text of the *Buddhacarita*:  
  
1.1-24, 26-28, 44-45  
13.73  
14.33-91  
chapters 15-17 (all verses)  
  
Not all of these additions of the Nepalese pandit Amṛtānanda are his own creations. The Japanese scholar Kiyoshi Okano could prove that **the entire additional part** of chapter 1 was borrowed from the *Mahāsaṃvartanīkathā* (a Sanskrit *kāvya* about the cosmology of the Sāṃmitīya school by the Buddhist *mahāmahopādhyāya* and *mahākavi* Sarvarakṣita who lived in eastern India in the 12th century).  
  
A new critical edition of chapter 1, in which the Sanskrit gaps are filled with the Tibetan translation, can be found at the end of the paper I attached to my last e-mail which can also be downloaded here:
