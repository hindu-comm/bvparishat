The original Sanskrit text of sarga 15 of the Buddha-carita has been found and has just been published, edited by Kazunobu Matsuda and accompanied by his Japanese translation:

He added on the Academia.edu page:  

"This is NOT Sanskrit restoration. Real one! Based on Sanskrit manuscript!"

  

I cannot read Japanese, so I do not know anything about the Sanskrit manuscript that he found it in.
