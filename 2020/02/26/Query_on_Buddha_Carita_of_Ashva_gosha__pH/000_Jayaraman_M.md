Namaste  

  

I request the esteemed members to point me to a standard version of Buddha carita with twenty eight sargas.  

Also, I would like to know whether the text  

a\) has any Samskrita commentaries  

b\) has any direct indian regional language translation - especially Tamil  

  

Further,  

c\) are there any e-repositories that might have reliable editions of Buddha carita  

  

I am also searching the web for the above information.  

I would be grateful If scholars could lead me to useful links regarding the above.  

  

regards
