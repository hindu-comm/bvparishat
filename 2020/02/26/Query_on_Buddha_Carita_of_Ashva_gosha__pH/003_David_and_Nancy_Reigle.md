Dear Dr. Jayaraman,

  

Supplementing the good information already supplied by Shankara ji and Dr. Steiner, and with specific reference to the question of a standard version of the Buddhacarita, the standard version is certainly the 1935 Sanskrit edition by E. H. Johnston of most of sargas 1-14, and his 1937 English translation of sargas 15-28 from the Tibetan and Chinese translations. The preceding 1893 Sanskrit edition by E. B. Cowell, as said in Claus Vogel's note cited in Dr. Steiner's paper, was based on three manuscript copies of a revised and augmented transcript of an original palm-leaf manuscript. The original palm-leaf manuscript (or a rotograph of it) became available to E. H. Johnston. From this, he could correct the many errors in the earlier edition, and remove the later additions made to it. Johnston also made full use of the Tibetan and Chinese translations in establishing the Sanskrit text. Thus, in the absence of the availability of any more manuscripts, his has been the standard edition ever since, even though it is incomplete.  

  

The original was certainly in twenty-eight sargas, as Johnston's study and translation of the Tibetan and Chinese translations of sargas 15-28 showed. He also translated sargas 1-14 complete, translating the missing verses 1-7 and 25-40 of sarga 1 from the Tibetan and Chinese translations. All three of Johnston's volumes, one Sanskrit and two English, were reprinted in one volume by Motilal Banarsidass in 1984. They had previously reprinted only volumes 1 and 2 in one volume in 1972.

  

The latter part of sarga 14 and sargas 15-17 in Cowell's 1893 edition were written by the Nepalese pandit Amṛtānanda, who transcribed the original palm-leaf manuscript in 1830. He added these because the original palm-leaf manuscript available to him was incomplete. Thus this material is not part of the original text. The first 24 verses of sarga 1 in Cowell's edition are also later additions, and thus are not in Johnston's edition. The 1911 edition of sargas 1-5 that Shankara ji gave a link to is based on Cowell's edition, according to Johnston.

  

Best regards,
