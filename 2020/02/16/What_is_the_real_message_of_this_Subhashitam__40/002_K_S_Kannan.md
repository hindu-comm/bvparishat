When you feel depressed that you have not got much or achieved much,

 look at those who are less privileged, less accomplished.

When you feel elated owing to your fortunes or attainments,

 look at those who have made their mark higher through good luck, through hard work.

  

Be not despondent, be not exultant.

Neither the crestfallen not the jubilant tend to make further progress.

  

Strike a balance.

Strive for excellence.

  

This is the message I took from the verse.

(There may be better approaches.)

\- KSKannan
