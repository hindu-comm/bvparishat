Sir

  

We find both kinds of people. I have a friend who keeps crying about the salaries and bonuses of his boss and others in his cadres (he used to read the Annual Report to know the salaries of top people in his company), and is constantly unhappy with his own situation. Nothing productive ever came of this fixation. Then, there are a few I know who only befriend those 'below' them (economically mainly but also intellectually), so that their false sense of their own greatness stays undisturbed. This subhashita gives good advice to both sets of people. Only when we let all of the world in, can we gain a proper perspective. That, for me, is the taatparya.

  

Regards

Senani
