I got this from<http://subhashitani.wordsofwisdom.in/2011/11/blog-post_20.html>

  

अधोऽधः पश्यतः कस्य महिमा नोपचीयते ।  
उपर्युपरि पश्यन्तः सर्व एव दरिद्रति ॥  – समयोचितपद्यमालिका  
  
adho adhaH pashyataH kasya mahimA na upachIyate ।  
upari upari pashyantaH sarva eva daridrati ॥  – samayochitapadyamAlikA  
  
If you always look downwards (people less privileged than you) then anyone can feel great about himself. If one only looks above, then he will always feel miserable. It is all about perspectives.  – Samayochitapadyamalika

  

Is there not any positive takeaway from this Subhashitam? Does not one, looking at those who have achieved more than him, feel inspired to work more and go higher? The word दरिद्रति seems to give a negative tone.

  

Opinions welcome.

  

Thanks and regards
