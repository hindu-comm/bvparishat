'Discourse' would be the right word for Mahavakya in English. It could be a paragraph, a chapter, a book, or a number of books. All that is tied up with a common point of discussion is a 'discourse' or a mahaavaakya.

  

Please refer to Br. Ve. Prof. Korada Subrahmanyam gari book Mahavakyavichara for further details.

  

A brief introduction to the book may be found here -<https://groups.google.com/forum/m/?fromgroups#%21topic/bvparishat/nn5pkDyebog>
