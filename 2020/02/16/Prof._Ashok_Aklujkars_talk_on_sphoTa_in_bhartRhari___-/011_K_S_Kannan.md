वाक्योच्चयो महावाक्यम्

- if I remember aright the line from *sAhitya-darpaNa.*

  

In *nyAya*, the *pan'cAvayava-vAkya* is sometimes labelled

a *mahAvAkya*.

  

Was it Kuntaka who referred to a whole work as a *mahAvAkya*?

In recent times George Steiner, the famous literary critic  

referred to a literary work as but one long sentence (*On Difficulty*)
