Dear Vidvans,

  

Can you please share from personal or second hand experience Ayurvedic and Siddha (Tamil) Vaidyas who have had a good track record treating cancer? Since the paradigm of tridosha operates in both traditional systems, cancer that covers a range of derangements from head to toe is treated with almost the same protocol with the protocol differing from vaidya to vaidya and tradition.

  

If able kindly share the name and contact details (Phone numbers) of these Vaidyas here.

  

Many thanks,

  

Venkat
