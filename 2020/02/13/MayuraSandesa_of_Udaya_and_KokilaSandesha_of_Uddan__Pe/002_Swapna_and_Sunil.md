Dear Shankara Sir,

  

Thank you for pointing me in this direction. This is much appreciated.

  

I managed to find the Mayurasandesha by Dr. Kunjan Raja on archive (did not realize that there is no extant english translation).

  

Thank you also for pointing me in the direction of the Kokilasandesha book by Dr. Rajaraman. I will get that.

  

In reference to Kokilasandesha, I also noticed that this blog has some interesting interpretations -<https://venetiaansell.wordpress.com/2011/06/20/kokila-sandesha-introduction/>

  

Again, this is very muchappreciated.

  

Sincerely,

  

Sunil
