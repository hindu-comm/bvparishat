Sunil ji,

  

There is an English translation of Kokilasandesa by Dr. Shankar Rajaraman, published by Rasala publishers.

<https://www.amazon.in/Message-Koel-Uddanda-Sastris-Sandesa/dp/8192411206>

  

It seems Mayurasandesa has not yet been translated into English yet. There is an edition with Sanskrit commentary and exhaustive notes by Kunjan Raja.

regards  
shankara
