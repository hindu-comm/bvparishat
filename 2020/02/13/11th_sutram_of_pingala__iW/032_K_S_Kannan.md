What I felt was that when we say this is *guru (*in a poem),

the duration of time required may not exactly be double that of what is *laghu*,

but is counted as/deemed as double.

This is evident in the case of a *laghu* followed by a conjunct consonant,

wherein the former gets the appellation of *guru*;

this is in contrast with an actually long letter (*dIrgha*) wherein  

that it takes two units of time is quite clear.

Hence the separate rendering as

"prosodially short" for *laghu*, and

"prosodially long" for *guru*.

  

If Murthy-ji questions something (esp. wrt Chandas),

I suspect I may be erring!
