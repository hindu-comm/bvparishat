There is a functional equivalence between  

\(a\) the dIrgha and  

\(b\) the hrasva vowel followed by a conjunct consonant.

  

While the former can be translated as "long",

both can be described as "prosodially long"

(even though the latter is not eligible to be labelled "long".

  

In short:

The short is short in the prosaic world;

the short can be \[thus\] "long" in the metrical realm.

(Lest someone suspect me otherwise,  

I know both senses of *prosaic*).
