1\. By assigning 2 maatraas to an akshara before a samyuktakshara, some genius in the hoary past made a very significant contribution to Sanskrit prosody and beyond. I would be happy if this is recognized.

2\. If so far our voluminous texts throw no light on the issue, it is never late to take it up as a research project.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
