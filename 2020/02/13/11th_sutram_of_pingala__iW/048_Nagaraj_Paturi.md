Dear Sri G S S Murthy-ji,

  

Can you please kindly articulate the research problem /question that you identified in this issue, the intriguing question to which the research can /should find an answer,, the reason for why you think the phenomenon/ theorization about a phenomenon is intriguing ?

  

That will help develop a research project and announce it to be taken up by scholars, particularly the younger ones.

  

Is it a historical question of who, when and how started the identification of hrasva followed by a samyuktaakshara as a guru?

  

lakshya leads to lakshaNa .

  

The feature of hrasva followed by a samyuktaakshara occurring in the position for a guru in a pattern can be found in Veda mantras, Laukika Samskrita poetry. The the lakshaNakaara identifies that this is what is filling the position of guru as required by the pattern in the lakshyas in Veda mantras and Laukika Samskrita verses.

  

Do you want to say that the identification by lakshaNakaara that this is what is filling the position of guru as required by the pattern in the lakshyas in Veda mantras and Laukika Samskrita verses is an interesting and admirable achievement or index of great acumen of the ancient lakshaNakaaras.

  

Do you want researchers to investigate what helped lakshaNakaaras to make such a fine observation that hrasva followed by a samyuktaakshara fills the position of a guru in a certain pattern ?
