The first question by Sri Murthy is very natural. (Guru, Laghu) binary has a sense of weight/density. They are to be taken as by 'definition'. The time taken to 'utter/vocalize' the syllables/akshara would be a different issue. Murthy ji asks "Is it that when halants go piggyback, they *get compressed in time*?". Exactly! When I read a poem silently for myself the issue of time does not matter. It is only the Chhandas based on guru-laghu-gaNa that matter. But when vocalized for others 'our common time' comes into picture. It is not just the transmitter but the receiver ear also matters. I don't like to digress too much. Theoretically,I feel this has to do with discrete vs continuous time and quite importantly the singularity nature of vyanjanas in time. I posted on this topic last year,

but except for Prof.Deshpande's discussion, the thread got lost in the bye lanes! I am happy the question has come back in another form. Murthy'sappeal for more research is well taken. To avoid confusing meanings of technical words, like "gaurava & laaghava" in time (not of time) language of mathematics is necessary.
