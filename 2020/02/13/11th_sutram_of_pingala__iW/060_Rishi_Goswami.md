Namaste to all Vidvadjanas  
  
According to what I've understood, the Question is about contemplating why a Sanyogottara Swara takes up 2 Matras.  
  
Before dealing with that, I just wanted to state certain things. If Vyanjana is Ardhamatrik, why not count सर्षप as 1/2+1+1/2,+1/2+1,+1/2+1=5 Matras. Individually taking Swara as 1 and Vyanjana as Half here.  
  
Vyanjanas are Swarangas, part of Swaras so even though they are half-counted, still their value is zero. Like when milk and water is mixed, we only see milk. When Vyanjanas and Swaras are mixed, we only experience value of Swaras.  
  
प = 1 मात्रा, not 1/2+1।  
  
Becuase Consonants are Saapeksha,they are treated as parts to Swaras who are Nirapeksha. They obtain the value of the Swaras. Like how Agamas obtain the attributes of their Sthani यदागामाः तद्गुणीभूताः तद्ग्रहणेन गृह्यन्ते।।  
  
Here, we see that Vyanjanas are nothing without Swaras, hence Laghutva Gurutva also is only dependent on Swaras.  
  
A vowel if succeeded by a Sanyoga, is not always Guru or 2valued. There is an exception, called प्रह्रे वा।  
  
If it is succeeded by प्र or ह्र, then it (the previous vowel) is to be elongated by choice.  
  
We can hence conclude that, a vowel, even though succeeded by Sanyoga, can be pronounced एकमात्रिक, we can see that in many popular songs. But our Rishis have made Sutras for proper method of Vedic pronounciations.  
  
The pronounciations of Sanyogaparas are not compulsorily द्विमात्रिक but a rule is made for emphasis, weight to be given to them. Hence they are गुरुसंज्ञक, Guru means weightful, heavy. Elongation of द्विमात्रिकत्व is another attribute of Guruvarnas. But, Emphasis is the main attribute.  
  
Where it is optional, is also mentioned, the wieght/emphasis to be given to प्रह्रपूर्वs is optional.  
  
Guru and Laghu is just to instruct the chanter, where to guve emphasis and where he shouldn't.  
  
Namaskar.
