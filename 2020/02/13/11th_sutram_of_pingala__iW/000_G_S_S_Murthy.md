Respected scholars,

Among extant works on Sanskrit Prosody, Pingalacharya's is considered the oldest. His 11th sutra deals cryptically with the well-known rule that a syllable followed by a conjunct consonant is to be treated as a guru, even though the syllable is a laghu by itself. To my mind, it appears to be a very important observation/discovery/standardization. It is counter-intuitive but it works beautifully as far as Sanskrit Prosody is concerned. There is an element of rounding up/digitalization of time duration. The commentary of Halayudha does not say much (vide attachment). My query is: Is there a detailed discussion of this rule with special reference to this rounding up in any of the works before or after Pingala? Or, have I got it all wrong and there is nothing great about this Rule? What is the antiquity of this Rule?

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
