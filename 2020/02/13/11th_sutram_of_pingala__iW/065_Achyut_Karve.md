Dear Vidwans,

  

All doubts regarding the lengths of laghu and guru are on account of corruptions in the spoken languages which are never questioned. One should refrain from imposing subjective inferences on the scriptures.

  

  

I reiterate that in order to cleanse speech corrupted by spoken languages one needs to practice the Maheshwar Sutras along with the damaru.

  

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
