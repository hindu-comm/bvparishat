Dear Vidwans,

  

ऊकालोsज् ऱ्हस्व दीर्घप्लुत: Does the ऊ tell us that the unit of measure of time is दीर्घ.

  

Is one pulse length dirgha. The heart beat is lub dub. Thus two
ऱ्हस्व make one दीर्घ.

  

When did the word मात्रा (one short vowel length) become the standard of measure of time in prosody?



With regards,

Achyut Karve
