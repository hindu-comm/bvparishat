One mnemonic I have in my notes:

  

यद् व्यञ्जनान्तं यद् उ चापि दीर्घम्  

संयोगपूर्वं च तथानुनासिकम् ।

एतानि सर्वाणि गुरूणि विद्यात्  

शेषाण्यतोऽन्यानि ततो लघूनि ।।  

  

There's another verse which defines laghu as hrasva but not vyanjananta, samyogapurva or anusvara ending. I dont have the verse.  

  

I suspect this is from the Taittiriya pratiśākhya but I'm not sure. It was revealed to me in a taittiriya recitation class I attended in Madras in the 1980s.  

  

Hope this helps,.
