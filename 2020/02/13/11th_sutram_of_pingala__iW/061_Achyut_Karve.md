Dear vidwans,

  

Let it be clear that a guru or dirgha is the standard measure of a vowel. Exactly half its length is a laghu or ऱ्हस्व and one and a half times its length is a pluta.

  

I think Patanjali has argued over that as many consonants one may add contiguously it does not add to make a laghu. Time lengths are counted by dirgha.

  

The proof lies in holding a damaru in ones own hand and reciting mantras or slokas while playing it.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
