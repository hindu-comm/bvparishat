Dear vidwans,

  

The main point is to ask the right question.

  

We need to first to ask whether time is internal to a system or external to it.

If time were internal to a system

how does the system define its time?

  

By externalizing time science makes the subject stand on its head wherein it becomes more complicated to understand the way nature works.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
