Dear Prof.Paturiji,

I think you have articulated better than me what I was struggling to convey. With the clarity you have provided for me and especially the inputs given by Dr.Kannan and Dr.Ramanujachar, I will attempt to list out questions which , I believe need answers through further research. They say that raising the right questions is more important than finding answers for them. As we gain knowledge cutting a path through the jungle of half-knowledge and ignorance we may have to retrace path travelled and start a new quest. Keeping that in mind let me say:

1\. The statement made in sutra 11 of Panini is not something straight forward like 1+1=2. For so long, scholars might not have found it necessary to raise questions on what basis it was arrived at because a. Generally scholars are trained to implicitly accept statements of recognized authorities in any field and questioning is equated with disrespect. \[Even in hard science such implicit faith exists. A statement by an Einstein, Newton or Hawking carries a disproportionate weightage. It is not surprizing that it is more so in a pedagogical frame like that of a gurukula.\] or b. Some thinking leads one to the rationale of the rule. Can we demonstrate a logical chain of paper and pencil reasoning? That is the first question.

2\. There may not be a positive answer to the first question. There are many discoveries of man of the pre-historic past which would have involved a lot of experimenting and the knowledge obtained is taken for granted by us. For example: use of fire, arrow and bow, edible vegetables. In the same way we can say that competent humans arrived at Rule 11 of Pingala. That kills the question in one shot. Perhaps that was how Pythogoras theorem was discovered by masons who built sacrificial platforms.

3\. Granting that we accept the escape route of 2 above, we are faced with another question. What is the bio-physical explanation to the observation that rule 11 works as far as Sanskrit prosody is concerned? What is it that enables our perception to gloss over the fine structure of multiple halants and approximate all of them to a guru. \[When we have to work in the realm of maatraa gaNas, we cannot proceed without accepting that a guru is 2 maatraas.\] That is the second question.

Any questions?

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
