Yes, guru as heavy brings (+brings in and brings back) (the factor of) gaurava to the issue. Reference of ardhamAtrA to vyanjana-s is essentially in the context of Agama/Tantra as I indicated. Else the first syllable in kArtsnya should be valued as four and half mAtrA-s (on lines you rightly indicated).

  

What is guru already will subsume (figuratively consume) the vyanjana fractions dowered by the succeeding syllable (if any). Dr Ramanujan pointed out how there is therefore no plutation here, on grounds merely of the mAtrA count.

  

The semi-vowel nature of r - an unusual/exceptional junctional role perhaps - might have inspired an exceptional status/role within pra and hra as ambivalently imparting laghutva/gurutva on its preceding laghu, though this is only a very wild guess. I have actually come across in literature of the conjunct pra not guru-ing the preceding laghu. Reph has this mAf (concession) ( - to quote myself from the Notes of one of my own books) - in two situations.
