Dear Sri Murthy, I am actually in the process of writing a paper about it - the why of this rule, although I am not young 🙂. I’ll share the draft with this list, hopefully soon.

  

But in a very loose sense, according to Hayes’ “Introductory Phonology” vowels followed by pure consonants tend to be accent attractors in many languages. That may have influenced the original definition according to him.
