I went to the web-site given by Prof.Kannan. All commentaries repeat the same thing. What I am looking for is how and why of the rule. If so far no one has written about this, it is time some basic research is done by our young researchers, who are technically competent. A halant is perhaps of quarter maatraa duration. This is just a guess. Experiments could be conducted. There is physics behind it. As peculiarities of human perception render assigning 2 maatraas in this situation justified, there is human biology too.

This is my submission and I rest my case.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
