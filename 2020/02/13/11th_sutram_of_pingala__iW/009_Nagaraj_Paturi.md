Dear Sri Murty-ji,

  

Maaraa is a 'unit' and here, a unit of time.

  

One nimisha nimesha , time taken for a wink of an eye is one maaraa.

  

The syllable preceding a samyuktaakshara is counted for the purpose of Chanda's, along with the first consonant of the samyukta. That makes a laghu preceding a samyukta take an additional half maatraa.

  

This one and half maatraa is rounded up as two.

  

That makes it a guru.

  

Maatraa and time relation is discussed in musicological works, particularly on taala.
