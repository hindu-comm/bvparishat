#3 above is the relevant point in this.  

the metric of मात्रा has to be a perceptual protocol, as Dr Kannan said it is constrained by the prosodic intent.

Pure speech can be only constrained by the timescale of translating the thought into speech.

I had asked earlier for any text on स्वर analysis in speech. Our local work suggests that स्वर carries the

modalities of the scene while consonant carries the भाव. भाव is static and स्वरis dynamic.

Why 1, 2 in prosody could be empirical to our hearing aesthetics.
