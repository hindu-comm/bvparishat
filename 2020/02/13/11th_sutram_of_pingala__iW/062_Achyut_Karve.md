Dear vidwans,

  

The question is how did man build the time concept internally?

  

The answer is through the recitation of the Vedas which consist of letters mainly of three lengths viz. र्हस्व, दीर्घ प्लुत and not through the observation of the Sun and the moon. It is therefore no wonder that the number system was innovated during vedic times.

  

Interpretation of our ancient texts should therefore be carriedout at their level of perception and awareness and not by currently available standards. We need to be aware thatmodern gadgets have greatly impaired or even destroyed our basic sense perceptions which were available to our ancients.

  

Withregards,

Achyut Karve
