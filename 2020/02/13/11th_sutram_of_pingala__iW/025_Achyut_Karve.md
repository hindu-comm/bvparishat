Dear Vidwans,

  

Activity is counted in parts of time. However while investigating activity time does not play a role. It is irrespective of the time needed to perform it.

  

In the case of laghu guru what is significant is the change in the effort invested to voice a letter rather than time.

  

VP's ideation of time and activity needs to be looked into.

  

If I am not wrong in my interpretation of VP time is one. Activity creates an illusion that it is made up of parts which flow sequentially in one direction. As such time can be accounted as a fourth dimension.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
