Thanks, Sir. What about halants going piggyback on another halant? कृत्स्न, कार्त्स्न्य? Can every halant in this chain be counted as half maatraa? Why is it that our perceptionaccepts this rounding up? Is it that when halants go piggyback, they get compressed in time? These are the types of questions for which one should seek answers.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
