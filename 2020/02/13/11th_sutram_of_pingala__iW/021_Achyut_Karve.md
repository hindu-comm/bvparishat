Dear Vidwans,

  

It is necessary to take cognizance of Patanjali's comment on time (काळ) with reference to distinguishing between the effort invested to voice a short and a long vowel. Patanjali says that time is outside the voicing apparatus and hence has no role to play in the production of letters.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
