Dear Vidwans,

  

Transactions always occur in wholes. Therefore the question of parts of laghu does not arise.

  

Take the example of chemistry. Atoms interact in wholes not in parts.

  

Does a clock or a digital clock not count time by means of activity whether it be of a pendulum or a crystal?

  

The absoluteness of time is its absence. Time and matter (space) therefore cannot be two separate moments in creation.

  

I think that the concepts of time and activity as ideated in the VP needs to be understood.

  

If equal parts of time have to be put aside one after the other it is the equality of effort (प्रयत्न) that needs to be achieved which will parcel out equal wholes of time. This sequential equality of effort in speech is achieved through the Damaru of Shiva and not by means of a clock.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
