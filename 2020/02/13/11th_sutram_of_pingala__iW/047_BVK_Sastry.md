Namaste



A thought input to consider the technicality of ' chandas' as flow of varnas to build the poetic structure in the discussion below:



The concept of मात्रा The refers to Measure (मा - मान ) and
Protection (त्राण - पालन) .



The Measure comes in three parts : By TIME, By EFFORT, By FLOW, By PROXIMIATE TOGETHERNESS \[ Extending the thought : तद्वत् प्रयत्नवैषम्यं कालवैषम्यं च पृथगपि भवितुमर्हति इति भाति ॥\]



By TIME, - Kalatah

By EFFORT - Prayatna

**By FLOW - This part is where the technicality of 'Chandas'
(varna-Pravaaha) as flow, the intended articulation modulates the experience of ' laghu / guru :: apla-prana maha-prana :: anunasika -ananunaasika :: time -distanced **

By PROXIMIATE TOGETHERNESS - Samyuktaakshara.





Illustrative examples are in the earlier posts. What would be the in this analysis ? व as alpa-prana ; घ as Maha-Prana. \[ ह्रस्व =
ह्रस् - व \] - \[ दीर्घ = दीर् - घ\]
