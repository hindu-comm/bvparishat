Thank you very much, Sir, for this input. Prof.Kannan has pointed out its existence in Panini. I have no idea, which is older. TaittirIyapraatishaakhya or Panini. Eitherway, Pingala is not the originator as Pingala would be later. Now that the rule is noted by Panini I would like to believe that some Grammarian after Panini would have dealt with this rule in some detail. A substantial portion of Sanskrit texts deals with Grammar. Grammarians should be able to help if this has been discussed.

Western scholars have also dealt with prosody (Prof.Arnold's Vedic Metre) but they seem to deal with the subject keeping Greek Prosody in mind.

I would seek further input.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
