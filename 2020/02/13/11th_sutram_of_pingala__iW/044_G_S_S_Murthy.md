This is in response to Sivaramakrishnan ji's query. Prof Lakshmanarao taught in IISc during the late fifties. He left IISc due to some institutional politics and joined a Regional Engineering College. Probably he returned to IISc. He spent his retirement days in the library of IISc. He was a devoted student of Dr.K.Venakatachaliengar, a well-known mathematician.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
