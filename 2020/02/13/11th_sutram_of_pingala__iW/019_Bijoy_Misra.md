We have to distinguish between the speech construction and the melodic construction.

The former is natural ( वेद) the latter is learned (शिक्षा)

the later goes to aesthetics and prosody. The former is analog with biological constraints.

There are no studies on the latter yet, except lumping all into some compounded group called phonemes.

I am glad that people are thinking analytically into this. A lot of work is neede in understanding speech.
