As far as laghu/guru is concerned, all that we need to know is their ratio. Therefore it should not matter whether it is measured in terms of heart-beats or external clock. We need to measure this ratio under different conditions: a.when guru is dirgha, b. when guru is hrasva+1,2,3 halants. Once we measure these ratios, we move to the second part of the exercise which is more difficult and vaguer. This part has to answer the question of why the range of differences in the ratio of laghu/guru does not matter for the perception of "rhythm", "rhythm" being as yet undefined.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
