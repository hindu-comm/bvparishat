Measurement of time is well settled in Science. Only accuracy of measurement may keep improving. As far as Sanskrit prosody is concerned absolute time, as long as it is within reasonable limits, is not important. If laghu is one unit, guru is 2 units. The remarkable discovery of our ancients is that rounding up a duration (hrasva+halant-chain), which is really laghu+a fraction of laghu, to guru=2 units, adequately meets the requirement of Sanskrit Prosody.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
