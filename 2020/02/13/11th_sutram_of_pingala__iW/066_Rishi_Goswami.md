Thankyou Kannan Guruji for response.  
  
The reph factor is indeed interesting. रलयोरभेदः। ऋलृवर्णयोर्.... सावर्ण्यम्, also Reph is dental acc to T.Pr रेफे जिह्वाग्रमध्येन प्रत्यग्दन्तमूलेभ्यः T. Pr. II. 41; (2) Reph is Hal and so Ri Lri, hence in तस्मान्नुड्द्विहलः "ऋच" is treated as द्विहल्। hence a स्वरत्व and व्यंजनत्व both based on the desired functions to deliver.  
  
The optionality proves that Hrasva Swaras can be emphasized/prolonged (लृकारः प्लुत एव च) and even Guru Hraswas can be squeezed (प्रह्रे वा). All this is made due to the Akhand Vedic Parampara started from Chaturmukha, given to Rishis and passed to us through उच्चारण-अनूच्चारण।  
  
There is a lot of irregularity, which can be only justified due to delivery of Vedic functions/or, that's the way some letter is pronounced, learnt that way from Gurumukha.  
  
Hence, I think we hypothize various reasons like Phoenetics etc, but major reason is Tradition. These rules where laid down very late, and only explanation can be Parampara.
