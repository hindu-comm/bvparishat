Irrespective of which language I choose to express myself in, I may be saying pure nonsense. I feel less unsure of what I am saying if I express myself in English. An anecdote: Many would know Prof.Lakshmanarao, who was professor of Maths in IISc, Bangalore. He was one of those known for erudition, teaching skills, and subtle humour. Indeed a प्रातःस्मरणीय. Once he gave an answer to a question raised by a student. The student got up, "Sir, my question is different". With lightning speed came the repartee from the prof. " Your question may be different. My answer is the same."

Now back to the highway.

If our ancients said that a hrasva followed by a samuktakshara is to be treated as guru and that dirgha is guru, without bringing in the concept of maatraa, they are definitely equating the former with the latter. Here Guru is not just a matter of nomenclature. This equality between the two has to fit in with the requirements of prosody and it does fit in beautifully. My question is how did they arrive at this result. One explanation could be that when they were composing verses they would have found that replacing a hrasva followed by samyuktakshara by dIrgha did not upset the rhythm of the verse. Just as they might have arrived at Pythagoras theorem or Fibonacci numbers they might have stumbled upon this.

My respectful obeisance to Dr.Ramanujacharya,

Murthy
