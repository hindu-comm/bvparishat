Dr Suthar Visuvalingam , who attended the event , reported / responded on his Abhinavagupta list, as follows:

  

Friends,



While the above conference presented a wealth of materials on disparate domains and posed valuable questions of wider theoretical interest on each, there was no comprehensive ‘wrap-up’ attempting to juxtapose the four papers to highlight divergent approaches to common threads. A couple (or more) of the speakers are (understandably) uneasy about circulating work-in-progress and thus being held to account for specific details of their arguments. Though I ventured critical observations, both in public and in private after each session, I’ll restrict myself here to a single overarching but often implicit issue. 



Whether to valorize or debunk such ‘authoritative’ treatises (*śāstra*) seems to be a function of whether its brahmin authors are perceived to be oppressors or benefactors. Though co-host Whitney Cox’s*“Yāmuna’s insurgent Brahmanism*” explicitly elevates this ‘subtext’ to center-stage of the conference, he clearly showed that (the claim to) ‘brahmin’ identity (and authority) was a contested one in the Tamil Kaveri delta and may have always been so at all times and places. There was no homogenized caste of brahmins imposing their power on the rest of Hindu society through the form of treatises, because any (unstable) consensus attained, if at all, among these ‘law-givers’ was the result of (often bitter and open) dispute, possibly involving other stakeholders (local kings, land-owning Vellālars, etc.) as adjudicators.



*Tom Hunter*’s*“When Śāstram Met Literature: the Tale of Tantri in the Language Order of Premodern Java”*showed how Sanskrit treatises from (Hindu) India were assiduously studied and translated by natives into Old Javanese thereby co-creating this new literary language. In the next (two) phases of local development, however, the Javanese were more intent in creative expression in their ‘vernacular’ tongue while drawing inspiration from the received brahmanical corpus. Whitney pointed out that the original*śāstra*, elided in the final stage of the poetic hierarchy, remains implicitly present as its authoritative summit. In other words, though flourishing historical exchanges with the subcontinent had long ceased, the (now Muslim) Javanese continue to revere the brahmanical cultural norms of those treatises.*

*Mark McClish*’s*"Nīti as Śāstra: Text, Tradition, and Authority in Ancient Statecraft"*showed how preexisting, probably disparate, streams of political thought coalesced into the authoritative Artha-Śāstra attributed to the ‘Kauṭilya, Machiavellian’ counselor to Chandragupta, founder of the Mauryan empire. Critique of form suggests its text had been rearranged to receive a brahmanical imprimatur, where discussions of diverse topics lead up to a ‘conclusive’ (*siddhānta*) position that would conform to*dharma*.. Its orthodox redactors nevertheless retain even extreme alternate views as*prima facie*arguments (*pūrva-pakṣa*) to be refuted. Instead of imposing his own ‘definitive’ take on the treatise, Mark presented various facets of its contents, bracketed between a series of opening and concluding interrogations.



The core puzzle was what it meant for a statesman to have this ‘definitive’ Hindu treatise for his eyes (*śāstra-cakṣus*)? How were its general precepts applied in concrete contexts, bridging the gap between “saying” and “doing”? Discussant Wendy Doniger, recent author of her own notorious tract*[Against Dharma](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07B51Y3SF/)*, claimed that these “subversive”*pūrva-pakṣa*views reflect the authentic ideology of the brahmin authors, who were thereby circumventing the oppressive censorship (and surveillance?) of their unsuspecting dharmic peers. Taking my cue from UC’s*prima donna*, I proposed that crucial for the king’s counselors was familiarity with a wide variety of (even contradictory) options to apply in often unique contingencies: in the otherwise diametrically opposed Sino-Korean Neo-Confucianist framework, they deliberated the appropriate course of action by invoking and arguing the relevance of historical (near-) precedents. Wendy, I observed, is being more dogmatic than the brahmin orthodoxy to be debunked.



"A*śāstra*for whom? On the intended readership of the Pratyabhijñā treatise" takes it for granted that its authors, Utpaladeva and Abhinavagupta, had undertaken this monumental exercise of rational thought primarily out of altruistic motives to make self-realization accessible to all, not just to adherents of other brahmanical schools, but also their Buddhist adversaries, and in principle to illiterate (at least in Sanskrit) women and untouchables. Though qualifying their ‘Doctrine of Recognition’ as a “heterodox” philosophical current,[Isabelle Ratié](https://paris3.academia.edu/IsabelleRati%C3%A9)(the primary reason for our attending this conference…) shows, already in her hefty and formidable French doctorate, that these consummate brahmins were so universal in outlook that they deliberately bracketed aside their (Śaiva) sectarian affiliations in their outreach.



We already know since the beginnings of Indology that the ‘nonviolent’ brahmins are a self-serving conspiratorial bunch who managed to impose their oppressive stranglehold over Indian society through sheer cunning. Otherwise, how to explain the continuing prestige of their*śāstra*s over indigenous folks, so far removed in time and space from classical India as the Javanese? Wendy now wants us to believe that they were at the same time incredibly and credulously stupid, for not being able to see through the same textual and literary ruses resorted to by fellow “subversive” brahmins against*dharma*?



What a pathetic (UC) finale to an otherwise (once-) promising legacy of insightful scholarship on Hinduism…L



Enjoy!
