**1.Arguments versus ad hominem remarks:**Every textual critic and scholar ought to know the difference between evaluating an argument and evaluating the person making the argument. I will therefore ignore all musings about my education, motivations, previous actions, and what I must or must not do to be eligible to critique Indologists’ editions. The topic under discussion is whether the Mokṣopāya edition is methodologically sound. After studying this edition and following the editors’ work for several years, our view is that it is not. Indeed, it reintroduces nineteenth-century prejudices, especially the Indologists’ tendentious “text-historicism,” by the back door.



**2. Response versus counter-challenge:**Every textual critic and scholar must know that he does not get to choose his criticisms. If a reviewer notes errors, he must answer those criticisms. He cannot raise red herrings, by saying, for example, “But I dare you to criticize the font or the cover of my book!” Steiner has not refuted any of the criticisms raised; hence, they stand. They are*substantial*criticisms concerning the reliability of the edition and the procedure the editors adopted. Asking me to engage in*ad hoc*criticisms of specific passages is ridiculous, when the substance of my criticism was that the editors’ procedure is*ad hoc*. I would be committing the same error I accuse Walter of.



**3. Editions with stemmata versus those without stemmata:**The idea attributed me, “that it is possible to establish a*reliable*manuscript stemma*for each textual tradition*and that an edition without such a stemma cannot be called a*critical edition*,” is idiotic. I am well aware that excellent editions without stemmata exist (Lachmann himself was not disposed to them) and that sometimes it is impossible to establish a stemma. But there are established canons for how to proceed in such cases. This the editors have not done. They have ignored debates in textual criticism on this issue to follow the sham method of “*Kontaminationskritik*” found only in Indology. For our discussion of earlier so-called critical editions by Indologists see the conclusion to*Philology and Criticism*:<https://www.academia.edu/37364902/>



**4. Critical editions versus uncritical ones:**A Bédierist edition, even though its editor chose to edit the best manuscript rather than reconstruct a historical archetype, is still a critical edition. But the editors have not opted to produce an edition of the best manuscript. In fact, they say they could not identify any group of manuscripts, much less a single exemplar, as consistently better. On the other hand, they say they could not establish the descent of manuscripts from a common ancestor, so neither is what they have reconstructed the archetype. But what is it, then? The editors claim their text is “more authentic” and the “oldest form,” but without a critical procedure they cannot*show*this. The edition is uncritical because it lacks a transparent, controllable procedure. This Steiner himself admits when he says, “Every reader of the edition will be able to do so because the edited text and the critical apparatus together provide the entire available manuscript tradition. In other words, the reader knows at every passage of the text what wording each manuscript has handed down (including corrections and glosses).” Let us first note that every edition with a rigorous critical apparatus does this, so it is not a point of distinction. Let us also note that the purpose of a critical edition is not for the reader to “know at every passage of the text what wording each manuscript has handed down,” but to know at every passage of the text what stage of the tradition the editor is reconstructing, and this is something he*cannot*know of the Mokṣopāya because the editors don’t know it themselves. Indeed, what is the purpose of this “critical” edition if the reader has to “deal with the content, form, and language*of the text*”? Wasn’t this the editors’ job? Weren’t they to provide him with a readable text? Thus, the reader will have to do the editors’ work for them and what the editors have provided is not a reconstructed archetype with a critical apparatus, but merely a list of variants without any attempt at locating them diachronically within the tradition.



**5. Text versus witnesses:**The crux of the problem is thus, what text are the editors reconstructing and whose text is it? The editors claim it is the text of the anonymous author of the Mokṣopāya or one as close to it as possible, but they cannot*know*this. In fact, they know nothing about this author (he is, after all, anonymous) and we know of no other works attributed to him (this is why the idea of using the “author’s style” to determine authenticity is ridiculous). In fact, everything the editors “know” about this author and/or his interests is what they reductively infer from the fact that his text underwent “redaction” by a later Brahmanic author, who created the Yogavāsiṣṭha. Thus, they take everything that is “\~ YV” or “\~ in keeping with the philosophy of the YV” and consider it to be original. The argument is like taking a wall that we know was painted black at some date and claiming that everything white beneath it is therefore original. This is all Srinivasan’s specious term “*Kontaminationskritik*” means: if we can identify the putative redactor’s tendentious motivations in revising the original, then by counteracting those motivations, we can reach the original. That this argument is: (1) illogical, (2) circular, and (3) question-begging I need not show. The text that emerges at the end of this process of “reconstruction” will itself be the proof of the initial hypothesis, but nothing guarantees that such a text actually existed. Let us not even mention the logical inconsistency of moving from parts known to be revised to parts not known to be revised: it is like taking a young child given a prosthetic limb and saying, “since we know this part was reconstructed, we are justified in tearing off her face.”



**6. Lachmannism versus pseudo-Lachmannism:**Ordinarily, if someone thought no satisfactory genealogical analysis was possible and the manuscripts of the work could not be fitted into a stemma, he would opt to edit one of the witnesses. But the Mokṣopāya editors have chosen to reconstruct an ancestor, even though they cannot say*what the status of that ancestor is and how the manuscripts of the work relate to each other.*Thus, while their position is not Lachmannism, it is not Bédierism either. In fact, it is a peculiar kind of Lachmannism we might call pseudo-Lachmannism, analogous to the pseudo-Bédierism Leonardi identifies in his article. Leonardi demonstrates the problems with preaching fidelity to one manuscript arbitrarily selected as “base” by those who forego even the preliminary level of Lachmannian analysis required to identify the*bon manuscrit*. But even he could not have imagined that someone might forego this analysis and still opt for a reconstructive edition! Whereas the pseudo-Bédierist only*pretends*to follow Bédier in selecting a single manuscript to edit (in fact, his edition “consists in the transcription of one of the manuscript carrying the work, with corrections in variable measure”), the pseudo-Lachmannian only*pretends*to follow Lachmann in establishing the relationship of exemplars (hence the importance of the printed edition of the Yogavāsiṣṭha for the Mokṣopāya editors; it gives them the*appearance*of a critical procedure), and his edition consists of readings commingled from several manuscripts containing the work, with only the claim that they correspond to an earlier state of the text to attest for it.



**7. Reconstruction versus new creation:**From all I have said, it should be clear that what the editors have done is not reconstruct an earlier text, but, under the guise of historical reconstruction, create a completely*new*, composite edition. They repeatedly claim that this work is “more authentic,” and perhaps they really believe this to be the case; indeed, so much so that they are incapable of seeing that they cannot*know*it is. That this text answers to their particular developmental history of the text and to their particular view of religion goes without saying: how could it not, since they do not have a critical procedure, but have, instead, elevated their prejudices to first principles? Those prejudices entail that the author of the Mokṣopāya was a rationalist and a skeptic, a “proto-Enlightenment figure” who rejected the adequacy of the Revelation in salvation. They also entail that his work was, wrongfully, appropriated by orthodox Brahmans intent on preserving their authority. It should be clear, however, that the author of this text is not “Anonymus Casmiriensis,” but the editors themselves. Reductively using observable differences between the manuscripts of the Mokṣopāya and the Yogavāsiṣṭha, they have altered a great number of lines of the text to bring it more into line with their regnant ideology, assuring the reader that this has been done using “the means of contamination criticism,” that is to say, in the name of undoing an alleged tendentious revision of the work, they have undertaken a second, equally tendentious revision of it. When we observe that incredible sums of money were spent for German Indologists to engage in their favorite fantasy, we can only ask: for whom and to what purpose? The Indologists’ method, whether called “higher criticism,” “historical criticism,” “text-historicism,” “*Quellenkritik*,” “*Tendenzkritik*,” or, as in its latest iteration here, “*Kontaminationskritik,*” has not worked in relation to works such as the Mahābhārata and the Bhagavadgītā (see:<https://www.academia.edu/21508955/>). The present edition does nothing to rehabilitate it.
