Dear Prof. Bhate,  
  
Sukthankar uses the term "diaskeuast" in the sense of "redactor". Compare, for instance,  
  
V. S. Sukthankar. On the meaning of the Mahābhārata, p. 86:  
"Bhārgava **redactors**"  
  
V. S. Sukthankar. Memorial Edition, Vol. I: Critical Studies in the Mahābhārata. Bombay: Karnatak Publishing House 1944, p. 336:  
"The infiltration of masses of Bhārgava material in the shape of Bhārgava myths and legends, the manner of its treatment, and even that strange admixture of the Epic with the Dharma and Nīti elements, which latter especially has so long puzzled many inquirers into the genesis of the Mahābhārata, thus appear to find a simple and straightforward explanation in the assumption of an important unitary **diaskeuasis** of the epic under very strong and direct Bhārgava influence."  
  
Sukthankar's usage of the term "diaskeuasis" ("redaction"), that is the process of reviewing or revising a text, includes "textual alterations, especially interpolations" (Sukthankar 1944: p. 2), "a long chain of successive syntheses of divergent texts" (p. 104), "conflating two discrepant accounts of an incident" (p. 110), "the colossal idea of converting the popular Epic of the Bhāratas into the Encyclopaedia Brahmanica" (p. 331), "additions and alterations (p. 336)", or, "supervision" (p. 336).  
  
With best regards,  
Roland Steiner
