"The use of 'technical terms like 'diaskuasis' might have been a felt need ( or pressure or fashion of the day ?!) to align oriental research work to the Greek -Latin models and standards in bringing out the 'critical editions and provide a scholarly props for Indian vedic historicity to build anchors by land- people-language' that might snugly fit in to the classical Bible research model."  
  

That's not impossible. This choice of words isn't entirely without a semantic load, just like when a poet, instead of using the usual "have become", uses "are become", intending thereby a shift, however momentary, into the Biblical register. That's not to say that there was some extensive sinister agenda at play, so Roland Steiner's interpretation looks like a likely explanation.
