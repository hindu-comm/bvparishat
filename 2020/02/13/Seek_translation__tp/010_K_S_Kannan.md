Dear Madam,

  

My two cents.

  

The Mahabharata is a massive work, no doubt.

Its sheer bulk urges people to think of highly likely contributions from multiple authors.

  

But if we look into the work of Isaac Asimov - of our own times (1920-1992) -  

which amounts to some 500 books and a little less than a lakh letters/post-cards,  

we can imagine the bulk of production a single person can be capable of.

(I do not know if anybody has counted the total number of lines in his total output).

  

Three and a half years or so of dedicated work is the time taken by Vyasa, we hear.

Not impossible to imagine - going by the racy style and spontaneous flow evident in the epic.

No wonder, perhaps, the title "*cakAra-kukshi*" was earned by this author, reputed though for *vishAla-buddhi,*

indicative of the speed with which he composed. The work is essentially intellectual,  

though beautiful passages of charming poesy are found often.  

(I guess Prof. Ram Karan Sharma did some work on poetry in the *Mahabharata*).  

  

Eight syllables are more or less necessary and sufficient  

to articulate a good many thought units = small sentences or effective clauses:

given the minimality of rules for the *anushTubh  
*

(conditions on only 3 syllables= the 5th, 6th (and 7th) in each pAda),

the flow can be unimpeded and spontaneous.

  

As to unity/multiplicity in the work, our **living** tradition has always perceived the unity of the work

*- alongside* noticing some *prakshepa*-s here and there, as noted even in the Gita Press edition.

  

The approach of Westerners could be different.  

Scholars have warned us: Don't read Homer into Indian Epics.

Even the Western word "epic" has its own connotations, not applicable to our long poems.

  

The sheer bulk of the *Mahabharata*, more than eight times the *Iliad* and the *Odyssey* put together,

must be off-putting to many. Given the extreme exclusivism of the Western faiths,  

and the contempt, jealousy and intolerance and racism (especially the early) Western Indologists were easily capable of,

it should be no matter of surprise that spiteful comments form the default value of their writings on "others":

from ABKeith to SPollock (not to speak of the revulsion Wendy Donigers can inspire).  

(Exceptions there surely are, met with sporadically).  

  

For a Westerner, any poem of the early ages has to be a ballad of love or a song of war.

Why should this necessarily be the case with poems of our country?

The *tapovana* is an integral part, for example, of every work of Kalidasa.

The words of *tapasvin-*s look all extraneous and accretional to a typical Westerner.

The sheer enormity of output, mostly by Brahmins, is an abomination for him.

The contempt that the words of Max Muller or Eggeling are abrim with  

in regard to the theological writings of this country is no matter of secret.

  

And they held Yoga and Ayurveda also in equal contempt.  

And denied any place to mathematicians from India.

Many modern productions on Linguistics do pay some lip sympathy to Panini  

\- how graceful of them, and how lucky we are!  

  

One can still expect some sense from some *unprejudiced* scientists of the West:

now some Western mathematicians can admire Panini - in spite of Whitney & Co.  

  

It may well take a few more centuries for them to realise the wisdom

in the other disciplines inspired/developed by the "poor" Brahmins,

who cared little for being very "successful"  

(which today means little else than having huge bank accounts).

*brAhmaNena nishkAraNo* ..*.adhyeyo jneyashca* - is a famous line.  

  

The question boils down, then, to one of perception.  

One can see the vast work as nothing but a mess;

or as a work of essential unity, with some interpolations here and there

\- easily condonable in its mostly oral passage through millennia.

  

Sukthankar no doubt mastered the Western paradigm of the critical edition;

but at the end perhaps saw greater wisdom in the *avicchinna-paramparA* that our tradition is vivified by.

(One can perhaps recollect the words of St. Thomas Aquinas for whom

all his voluminous productions appeared but trivial  

in front of the glimpse of the glorious illumination he said he experienced at the end).

  

All the masterly appurtenances of lexica and grammars and indexes and concordances

may count for but a little more than zero - if the essential spirit itself is lost.

*"yas tan na veda kim RcA karishyati ?"*

  

"Cleverness is serviceable for everything,

sufficient for nothing".

  

Sorry for the prolixity.
