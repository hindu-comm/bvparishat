This is as selective and tendentious a citation of Sukthankar as I have ever seen. When quoting Sukthankar on the “diaskeuasis” hypothesis, one must also quote his views on “higher criticism,” butchery of the text in pursuit of the “Ur-Epos,” and his utter disdain for German scholarship on the Mahābhārata.



Sukthankar’s*On the Meaning of the Mahābhārata*is available here:https://www.academia.edu/36241691/On_the_Meaning_of_the_Mahabharata_Scanned.pdf



\>\> he has put forward arguments on the basis of a large number of manuscripts that you have to deal with one by one if you want to criticize his view. To do so, one must read his books and articles thoroughly and try to understand his arguments before trying to refute them.



Had Walter Slaje read Sukthankar’s “books and articles thoroughly” when he claimed, “Though I agree with Grünendahl's (1993) criticism of the Schriftartenprämisse \[*sic*\] I hesitate to accept its general application to all sorts of texts. Grünendahl developed his arguments by textual criticism of the epics, targeting on the principles Sukthankar adhered to as an editor of the Poona Critical Edition of the Mahābhārata in particular”? Had he “understood his arguments before trying to refute them”? This is the most perfectly inane comment on Sukthankar’s editorial principles. There is no “Schriftartprämisse” as we demonstrated in chapter 3 of*Philology and Criticism*. Slaje evidently had not a clue about Sukthankar’s work or about the fundamentals of textual criticism when he made this comment. See:[https://www.academia.edu/36999444/Philology_and_Criticism](https://www.academia.edu/36999444/Philology_and_Criticism)



Reading Slaje’s edition of the Mokṣopāya, I find the ignorance continues. The edition cannot be called “critical” in any sense. The editors have not read essential texts in textual criticism. They seem ignorant of basic concepts. The edition lacks a stemma; the editors do not group mss. into*meliores*and*deteriores*much less attempt to arrive at a satisfactory genealogical classification. No significant errors were identified; in fact, we find the absurd comment, “In a manuscript tradition that is at least partially contaminated the best criterion for producing a stemma would be agreement of significant scribal errors. In the first fourteen Sargas I have found hardly an instance of such agreement. The insertions and omissions also do not occur in regular patterns and are not sufficient to establish a stemmatic relationship.” First, significant errors are not “the best criterion” for “a manuscript tradition that is at least partially contaminated”; but for*every*tradition. Second, they are not the “best criterion” for “producing a stemma”; they are the*sole*criterion. “Insertions and omissions” even if they occurred in “regular patterns” do not permit a determination of filiation; in fact, they will always mislead because of the horizontal nature of such transmission. This is the error in Grünendahl as we demonstrated in*Philology and Criticism*: foregoing systematic recensio and having no mss. at his disposal, he tries to build a “stemma” on patterns of “insertions and omissions” forgetting that: (1) the order in which he takes those insertions and omissions will determine the result; and (2) because these passages are interpolations, their absence reveals nothing about the closer relationship of mss.



The Mokṣopāya editors state their edition reconstructs “the oldest form” but, in fact, in the absence of a stemma, they cannot know this. The edition reproduces just that arbitrary mix of readings in any line, which they have decided represents the oldest form. In fact, because they proceed eclectically, now reproducing the readings of one group of mss. and now another and the groups themselves keep shifting, it is impossible to know what state of the tradition they reproduce. This is evident from the*ad hoc*nature of their justifications: they would*like*the reader to believe they are presenting a “more authentic” form of the text. Lacking a critical procedure for sifting variants, they fall back on the criterion of*lectio difficilior*, albeit they apply it inconsistently; sometimes their arguments are open to the charge of circularity. (I will not even comment on the idiotic claim of applying*usus auctoris*to an anonymous work.) When clarifying editorial principles, they typically claim the original reading was “determined using the means of contamination criticism.” But (1) they neither list nor explain those means (a sure sign of scholarly fraud); and (2) no such thing exists (*Kontaminationskritik*is unknown in textual criticism; it is a bogus term invented by Paul Hacker’s student Srinivasa Ayya Srinivasan).



I regrettably cannot recommend the Mokṣopāya edition. What the editors have created is not a critical edition, neither a Lachmannian/neo-Lachmannian nor a Bédierist edition, but a*new*work. Given the editors’ eclecticism, no user can be certain that any line of the text is attested in one of the witness; if it is, it is so only accidentally. Readers should cite it at their own risk.
