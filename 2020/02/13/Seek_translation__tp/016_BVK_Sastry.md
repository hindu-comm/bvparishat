Namaste



1. The clarification helps. The question lingering is : Should we continue to take Veda Vyasa's work of 'Veda Vibhaga (Vivyaasa vedan)'
as 'editing of vedas for Kaliyuga' in the sense of ' orthoepic diaskuasis' in biblical context ?



2. If I am thinking right, the oriental scholars yielded to the use of ' orthoepic diaskuasis' model which meant the 'the activity of editing' the ' old classical texts of tradition; a model well accepted in Old Testament related studies and Bible studies. The hermeneutic error of using a ' base -fault line' seems to have been unnoticed. Vyasa was not considered as editor of 'Vedas in the sense it has been argued in the colonial model of interpretation and PIE linguistic model to project 'Sanskrit'. Veda-Vyasa's work is not explained as an effort
aiming to create a '(Kali-yuga) Version of 'Vedas.

The foggy understanding of the Greek terms (through the English translation and simplified porting over in Indian context) by oriental scholars of the period is something that may need a closer look.

The role play of 'diorthotes, diaskeuastes, redactor and editor' are clearly demarcated in Biblical research studies. 

The authors in the book ( indicated below) refers to the layers of confusions that have occurred in the practical (mis-)application of these terms leading to 'confusion' in bringing out 'critical editions'.

The use of 'technical terms like 'diaskuasis' might have been a felt need ( or pressure or fashion of the day ?!) to align oriental research work to the Greek -Latin models and standards in bringing out the 'critical editions and provide a scholarly props for Indian vedic historicity to build anchors by land- people-language' that might snugly fit in to the classical Bible research model.

I point to the book below ( Google book free read at the link given) where I notice the use of expression diaskuasis and related clarity as applied (Page 14-15) for Bible editing.

Editing the Bible: Assessing the Task Past and Present - By John S. Kloppenborg, Judith H. Newman ;
<https://books.google.co.in/books?id=P4F_DJw9rDwC&dq=meaning+diaskeuast%C4%93s&source=gbs_navlinks_s>

The intro to the book reads :

The Bible is likely the most-edited book in history, yet the task of editing the Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts of the Bible is fraught with difficulties. The dearth of Hebrew manuscripts of the Jewish Scriptures and the substantial differences among those witnesses creates difficulties in determining which text ought to be printed as the text of the Jewish Scriptures. For the New Testament, it is not the dearth of manuscripts but the overwhelming number of manuscripts—almost six thousand Greek manuscripts and many more in other languages—that presents challenges for sorting and analyzing such a large, multivariant data set. **This volume, representing experts in the editing of the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, discusses both current achievements and future challenges in creating modern editions of the biblical texts in their original languages**. The contributors are Kristin De Troyer, Michael W. Holmes, John S. Kloppenborg, Sarianna Metso, Judith H. Newman, Holger Strutwolf, Eibert Tigchelaar, David Trobisch, Eugene Ulrich, John Van Seters, Klaus Wachtel, and Ryan Wettlaufer.
