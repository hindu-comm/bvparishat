Dear Saroja,

  

  This is what I find: "**diaskeuast**in British English(ˌdaɪəˈskjuːæst) a person who revises, edits, or interpolates. Collins English Dictionary." The organizing of Rigvedic hymns into ten Maṇḍalas has been referred to in scholarly writings asorthoepic diaskuasis. This refers to the activity of editing.
