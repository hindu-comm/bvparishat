Dear Prof. Bhate,

  
  
\> I am still unable to understand Dr.Sukthankar's statement on p.20 of "The Meaning.."'. 'It is not in any sense  

\> the work of generations of poets, but the work of a single "diaskeuast"....'  
  
Sukhtankar here reports the view of **Joseph Dahlmann** (*Das Mahābhārata als Epos und Rechtsbuch*, Berlin: Dames 1895) who asserts "the essential unity of the text \[Mahābhārata\], which he \[Dahlmann\] saw as the work of a single author who combined earlier myths, lawbooks and teachings into a single whole - broadly speaking the epic in its present form - as a work of popular instruction" (John Brockington, *The Sanskrit Epics*, Leiden, Bosten, Köln: Brill 1998, pp. 46-47).  
  
Or in Sukthankar's own summary (*On the meaning of the Mahābhārata*, Bombay 1957, p. 21) of **Dahlmann**'s conclusions:  
  
"The unity of plan and aim was conceived in the mind of one single individual, who carried out the work in terms of this preconceived unity."  
  
  
Sukthankar himself holds a different view (1957: p. 22):  
  
"With DAHLMANN the pendulum had clearly swung to the other extreme. We owe very impartial and searching criticisms of DAHLMANN'S views to JACOBI and BARTH, who have exposed certain weaknesses of the theory. \[...\]  
We must also admit now that DAHLMANN's views regarding the unity and homogeneity of the text of the epic were  
much exaggerated. It can now be demonstrated, with mathematical precision, that the text of the *Mahābhārāta* used by DAHLMANN - the Bombay or Calcutta edition of the Vulgate - is much inflated with late accretions and most certainly does not, as a whole, go back to the fifth century B.C. It may even contain some furtive additions which had been made as late as 1000 A.D. or even later. The critical edition of the *Mahābhārāta*, which is being published by the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, shows that large blocks of the text of the Vulgate must on incontrovertible evidence be excised as comparatively late interpolations. The Brahmā-Gaṇeśa complex and the Kaṇika Nīti the Ādi and the hymns to Durga in the Virāṭa and the Bhīṣma parvans occur to our mind readily as examples of such casual interpolations. But the Southern Recension offers us illustrations of regular long poems being bodily incorporated in the epic, like the detailed description of the avatāras of Viṣṇu put in the mouth of Bhīṣma in the Sabhā, and the full enunciation of the Vaiṣṇavadharma in the Āśvamedhikaparvan, two passages comprising together about 2500  
stanzas. When we know thaf these additions have been made in comparatively recent times, even so late as the period to which our written tradition reaches back, can we legitimately assume that our text was free from such intrusions during during that prolonged period in the history of our text which extends beyond the periphery of our manuscript tradition?"

\> In continuation to my previous email,where can we place Vyasa, the composer of शतसाहस्री संहिता? in the beginning  
\> or at the end?  
  
  

Sukthankar *(Sukthankar Memorial Edition*, Vol. I: *Critical Studies in the Mahābhārata*, Bombay: Karnatak Publishing House 1944, p. 332):  
  
"Now there can be no question that all this Bhārgava material in our present Mahābhārata is entirely foreign to the plan of the original saga of the Bhāratas, occurring as it does almost wholly in the episodic portion of the epic. \[...\] The question how precisely this Bhārgava element, which we find concentrated mostly in the *upākhyānas*, came into the cycle of the Bhārata legends is intriguing, but unfortunately the answer is largely a matter of speculation. Even according to the traditional view, it was not the work of Vyāsa, the reputed author of the Mahābhārata, because the diaskeuasts have been fortunately frank enough to admit that his work, the Bhārata, which originally consisted merely of 24,000 stanzas, had no episode to speak of (1. 1. 61):  
  
*caturvimśatisāhasrīṃ cakre Bhāratasaṃhitām /  
upākhyānair vinā tāvad Bhāratam procyate budhaih //*  
  
It could again hardly have been the work of Vaiśaṃpāyana, the direct pupil of Vyāsa. according to tradition, who is said to have recited the Bhārata of Vyāsa, in the presence of Vyāsa himself, as he had been taught by his guru, during the intervals of the short snake sacrifice celebrated by king Janamejaya."  
  
  
Sukthankar *(Sukthankar Memorial Edition*, Vol. I: *Critical Studies in the Mahābhārata*, Bombay: Karnatak Publishing House 1944, p. 96-97):  
  
"Only a very late interpolation in some inferior Devanāgarī manuscripts speaks of the text as having been written down by Gaṇeśa to the dictation of Vyāsa, a fantastic story that we may ignore with an easy conscience. On the other hand, we are plainly told that the epic was first published, at an elaborate sacrificial session, in the form of a free *recitation* by Vaiśaṃpāyana, a direct pupil of the author, before king Janamejaya and the assembled guests. It was again *recited* by Sūta (or Sauti), who had heard it only at the first recitation, and somehow committed the whole poem to memory. After just one single hearing, he obviously could not reproduce such a voluminous text *verbatim et literatim*. In the beginning, therefore, it is clear that the poem, which was committed to memory, was recited freely, as faithfully as the particular reciter could contrive. This mode of transmission is not calculated to preserve rigid textual purity in any high degree, without stringent precautions, such as were adopted in the case of Vedic texts, but which never existed, as far as one knows, in the case of the epics. This fact also we find unexpectedly preserved by tradition (I. 57. 74 f.). Vyāsa, we are told, taught his Bhārata to his five pupils. Sumantu, Jaimini, Paila, Śuka, and Vaiśaṃpāyana. And the five rhapsodists – the direct pupils of the author - it is reported, published five separate versions of the epic \[...\].  
  
As is well known, there is preserved a work which actually passes for the Aśvamedhaparva of the Bhārata of Jaimini (whether it is actually so or not) and which is totally different from our Aśvamedhaparvan.  
  
Here, l think, we have a clear glimpse of the early history of the text. Two facts emerge rather clearly out of the chaos: firstly, *the text was originally committed to memory and recited freely; secondly, different rhapsodists recited differently*. This has indeed been assumed by many writers on the subject. All that is quite natural and intelligible. As a matter of fact, from generation to generation, from place to place, from bard to bard, the wording, even the contents, would vary a little, until the text is committed to writing, which is the beginning of a different phase in its history. The view that the epic has reached its present form by a gradual process of addition and alteration receives strong support from the fact that this *process is not stopped even by scriptal fixation*. The study of the manuscripts themselves, which belong to a very late phase in the evolution of the text, shows that texts must have been constantly amplified and altered by conflation."  
  
(Sukthankar 1944: p. 122):  
"The optimistic view that any extant manuscript, however old and trustworthy, of some favoured version or recension, could give us, with a few additions and alterations, the text of Vyāsa's Bhārata or Mahābhārata is the index of a naïve mentality and does not need any elaborate refutation."  
  
  
(Sukthankar 1944: p. 129):  
"The editor \[of the critical edition\] is firmly convinced that the text presented in this edition is not anything like the autograph copy of the work of its mythical author, Maharṣi Vyāsa. It is not, in any sense, a reconstruction of the Ur-Mahābhārata or of the Ur-Bhārata‚ that ideal but impossible desideratum. It is also not an exact replica of the poem recited by Vaiśaṃpāyana before Janamejaya. It is further wholly uncertain how close it approaches the text of the poem said to be recited by the Sūta (or Sauti) before Śaunaka and the other dwellers of the Naimisa forest."
