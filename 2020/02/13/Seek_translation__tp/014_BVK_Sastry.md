Clarification request : What is 'asorthoepic' ? qualifying ' diasckuasis' ? How does the term get connected to ' Rigvedic hymns related work of Vyasa, as we ' given to believe' to be one of ' Text reorganizing , without intervening to the swaras of suktas'- i.e. no change in the articulate pronunciation ?



I seem to miss something .







The meaning search for 'asorhoepic' pointed to ' orthopedics'- meidcal branch. And that does not apply here.



The search for 'asorthoepy' - did not yield the term.

The search for orthoepy' yielded: : Orthoepy is the study of pronunciation of a particular language, within a specific oral tradition. The term is from the Greek ὀρθοέπεια, from ὀρθός orthos ("correct") and ἔπος epos ("speech"). The antonym is cacoepy "bad or wrong pronunciation". The pronunciation of the word orthoepy itself varies widely; the OED recognizes the variants, and for British English, as well as for American English:
