Dear Professor Kannan

Thanks very much for your response.Yes, any reader of Dr.Sukthankar is convinced by his idea expressed in the words "its Gestalt remains unaltered"(p.23).And there is no gainsaying of this ..However,in our objective pursuit of the problem of the composition of the great epic should we agree to the theory of historical layers and the contribution of. Bards/poets in its growth?
