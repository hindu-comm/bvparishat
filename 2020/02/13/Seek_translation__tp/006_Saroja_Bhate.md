Dear Professor Steiner

Many thanks for your detailed reply which removed some of my doubts.I am still unable to understand Dr.Sukthankar's statement on p.20 of "The Meaning.."'. 'It is not in any sense the work of generations of poets,but the work of a single "diaskeuast"....' Were the Bhargava interpolators not poets?Who was the "diaskeuast"?Can we say he must have been a Bhargava or a "Bhagavata"?

Well, these are my stray ideas.
