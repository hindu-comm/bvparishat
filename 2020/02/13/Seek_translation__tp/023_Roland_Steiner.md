\> When quoting Sukthankar on the “diaskeuasis” hypothesis, one must also quote his views on “higher criticism,”  
\> butchery of the text in pursuit of the “Ur-Epos,” and his utter disdain for German scholarship on the  
\> Mahābhārata.  
  

This rather shows the well-known "utter disdain for German scholarship" of Dr Bagchee. Sukthankar's criticism in his "On the Meaning of the *Mahābhārata"* (1957) is indeed sharp and also excessive, but much more differentiated than words like "butchery" or "utter disdain" suggest. It is also important to note that in his 1957 book Sukthankar turns from his original text-critical approach to a more "holistic" attempt at interpretation.  
  
But that - namely the "'diaskeuasis' hypothesis" - was not the point at all, but only the *meaning* in which Sukthankar uses the two terms diaskeuast and diaskeuasis.

And now for something completely different.

  
  
\> I regrettably cannot recommend the Mokṣopāya edition.  
  

A seal of quality. If one knows what else Dr Bagchee recommends, we should consider including his non-recommendation in the publisher's book description.  
  
Dr. Bagchee shows once again that he may have read a few books and essays on the theory of textual criticism but has not digested them intellectually. This is not surprising, since to my knowledge he has never edited an Indian text from manuscripts. The idea that it is possible to establish a *reliable* manuscript stemma *for each textual tradition* and that an edition without such a stemma cannot be called a *critical edition* is at best a sign of great naivety. In any case, it shows that he does not understand the meaning of the adjective "critical" in the term "critical edition".  
  
  
\> (I will not even comment on the idiotic claim of applying \*usus auctoris\* to an anonymous work.)  
  
I take this remark as an example of the intellectual level of Dr. Bagchee's comments. The fact that the name of an *author* is not known, that the work has been composed by an anonymous *person*, does not mean that the work has no author. Does Dr. Bagchee think that the selection of text variants would be different if we knew the author's name? Apart from that, it turns out that Dr. Bagchee does not seem to have the slightest idea what kind of text is at stake in the case of the *Mokṣopāya*.

  
  
  
\> no user can be certain that any line of the text is attested in one of the witness  
  

That is simply wrong.  
  
  
The litmus test for a critical edition is the edited text itself. Dr Bagchee has to show convincingly in concrete cases that wrong or doubtful editorial decisions were made. To do this, however, one must also deal with the content, form, and language *of the text*. Every reader of the edition will be able to do so because the edited text and the critical apparatus together provide the entire available manuscript tradition. In other words, the reader knows at every passage of the text what wording each manuscript has handed down (including corrections and glosses). This is one of the chief aims of a critical edition. Anyone who questions the methodological foundations of this edition must show where they have led to incorrect or questionable results. If necessary, I will comment on criticism that is well-founded in this sense, but not on anything else.  
  
  
Best,
