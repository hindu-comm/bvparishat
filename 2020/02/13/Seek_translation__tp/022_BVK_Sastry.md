Namaste RS



On 'Suthankar's use of the term ' diaskuasis ' and work carried on under the umbrella scope of this term detailed in your post below:



***My question***: What may be the best way of finding the ' Samskruth translation or technical term/s' which may map to the work output from Suthankar covering various activities under the scope of the ' term
' diaskuasis ' ?



***Reason for my request***:



a) Vasnath Bhatt points to पाठ संशोधक \< I remember that Prof. V. S. Sukathankara ji has utilised the word " text redactor " ( पाठ संशोधक ) for this kind of work. Does / will it convey the same meaning ? Please clarify my understanding. Regards for both the Professors. Vmbhatt
> But the output goes beyond this frame of understanding.



b) Would the work done by Acahrya Madva fit under the scope of the term ' diaskuasis ' , about which Suthankar was fully aware of. Acharya Madhva has noticed such challenges and says in Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya 2 - (3 and 4) :


(<https://anandatirtha.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/mbtn-chapter2.pdf> ;
<https://archive.org/details/MahabharathaTatparyaNirnayaVol1/page/n132/mode/1up>
)



3. In some places, shlokas have been inserted; In other places, shlokas that go against one's philosophy have been removed; In some places, shlokas have been re-arranged; Along with this, due to wrong knowledge and illusion, the contents of the work have been distorted.

4. Those works which are currently extant also have such distortions; Amongst works, those which are now not available are more in number. Even one percent of the works among a crore are not available nowadays.

5, 6 When such is the state of written works itself, what else can be said of those shastras which even devatas find it difficult to comprehend? In Kali Yuga, when works are distorted in this fashion, in order to establish the correct purport of these works, I will provide
decisive comments on them, due to the inspiration and grace of Lord Hari. I have understood other shastras and the Vedas also only due to His grace.

7, 8 With the grace of Lord Hari, I have understood the purport of the various granthas found in different parts of the country; Having done so, I shall now describe the true meaning of the shastras, as also conveyed by the Mahabharata, just like how Bhagavan Vyasa, who is Lord Narayana himself, has conveyed in His various granthas.

9, 10 It is said that Mahabharata is the decisive grantha when it comes to understanding the purport of all shastras. Once earlier, under the orders of Bhagavan Vyasa, Mahabharata (on one side) and all the other Vedas (on the other side) were put on a weighing scale by Brahma, devatas and all Rishis. Then, Mahabharata outweighed all the other shastras.





c) Such challenge was not new to Indian scholars ! especially in the context of Mahabharata ! The technical term and approach used in tradition for getting at the ' True original text from the mix-ups' and improvising the same was covered under the names of ' Vartika- Bhashya' model ( in Commentators tradition) ; ' shuddha- Patha nirnaya' ( in Mallinathas words while commenting on Kalidasa's works) ; For texts like Mahabharata and Puranas which ' of necessity had to expand with time and get inclusive of local needs, a technical term and technique called ' upa-brumhana' was provided. The intention was very clear. The essence to be maintained, even if the text undergoes an enhancement and emendation. In other the 'sacred text was allowed to
expand and grow, with full knowledge that the enhanced text would not go against the true essence of the text. This is called ' Taatrpaya -artha - Nirnaya'. It was authorized inclusion and enhancement of
an earlier text to make sure the osmotic extension and continuity of divinity. This work could only be done by the authorized school of 'Suta-Puranika' disciples of 'Vyasa' ! Suta- Puranikas were in charge of outreaching the essence of 'Veda-Dharma to society .



This sacred duty of 'Dharma outreach to society' is badly and grotesquely presented as "the colossal idea of converting the popular Epic of the Bhāratas into the Encyclopaedia Brahmanica" (p. 331)' ! Because the lens of language used was tainted with the ' biblical theological hermeneutic'. I do not call it ' any sinister agenda'. Certainly Not. It seems to be a overstretch of the term to make it carry an unintended semantic load, ; as observed by Ms. Irene, \<
just like when a poet, instead of using the usual "have become", uses "are become", intends thereby a shift, however momentary, into the Biblical register. \> ' 



On a side note, I would be very suspicious of the ' interpretation of Mahabharata as presented in 'Discovery of India' by Nehru. (For Nehru, Ramayana and Mahabharata are historic stories of different tribes of India ! - Page 94: <https://archive.org/details/DiscoveryOfIndia/page/n91/mode/1up/search/Mahabharata> ) 



The integrity and commitment of Suthankar to tradition is seen in prolegomenon where he provides a over the shoulder review of the
project: Critical edition of Mahabharata, what it aimed, what it achieved, and what is the worth of the critical edition in relation to traditional understanding of the text and its purpose.



Therefore, I look for scholars input on how best to map the term ' diaskuasis ' to the model of Samskruth text edits and critical editions.
