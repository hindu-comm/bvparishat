Dear Sastry Ji,

  

  I assume you are asking "orthoepic" in connection with "diaskuasis." I now realize my own misspelling of "orthoepic" as "asorthoepic," by not splitting "as" from "orthoepic" in my message to Professor Bhate. I have not myself used the term "orthoepic diaskuasis" in my own writing, but several scholars like Sukthankar, Bronkhorst and Kiparsky have used this term in the context of the process of editing the Vedic Samhitas and the epics like Mahabharata and Ramayana. The term "orthoepy" refers to thestudyoftherelationshipbetweenthepronunciationofwordsandtheirorthography and the term "diaskuasis" refers to the process of editing. So, as far as I know, the term "orthoepic diaskuasis" refers to the process of editing taking into account oral and written transmission. With best regards,
