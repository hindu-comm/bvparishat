\> diaskuasis  
  
The correct terms are diaskeuasis ("redaction") and diaskeuast ("redactor").  
  
It does not matter that the words are Greek, because Sukthankar (!) uses them as synonyms for "redaction" and "redactor". This does not imply a "Greek" or "Latin" model, but includes - I repeat - "textual alterations, especially interpolations" (Sukthankar 1944: p. 2), "a long chain of successive syntheses of divergent texts" (p. 104), "conflating two discrepant accounts of an incident" (p. 110), "the colossal idea of converting the popular Epic of the BhƒÅratas into the Encyclopaedia Brahmanica" (p. 331), "additions and alterations (p. 336)", or, "supervision" (p. 336).  
  
It is tedious to deal with the same unsubstantiated general insinuations over and over again. I am not the advocate of Sukthankar, but he has put forward arguments on the basis of a large number of manuscripts that you have to deal with one by one if you want to criticize his view. To do so, one must read his books and articles thoroughly and try to understand his arguments before trying to refute them. However, if you know beforehand that his views are not correct, you can, of course, save yourself the trouble.
