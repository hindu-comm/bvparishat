Haraye Namah

Namaskara.

I wanted to ask if I was pronouncing Vaidik Swaras correctly.

I've just started with Vaidik Prakaran of SK. But I wonder if I pronounce my swaras correctly.

Swarit is a collection of both Udattatva and Anudattatva, and technically should be in between, but the chihna of Swarita is a vertical dash above the Varna, hence I pronounce it high, the one with horizontal line below as low, and one with no sign as between the 2.

But technically, if Swarita is between, the one with vertical dash should be pronounced as middle note, inst it? But he Parampara by which we learn also can't be ignored right?

Another possibility is that if Paninian system is to be taken, its possible that my Taittiriya Shakha (K Yved) isn't compatible with it. What system should I follow in this case?
