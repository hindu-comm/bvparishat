Namaste Veernarayan Pandurangi ji



1. Very welcome, timely and appreciated effort from traditional institution in undertaking this 'dialogue -response' which has been in side wing's for over some decades !



2. My suggestions for contemplation: ( call it a loud thinking if you prefer)



2a) Can this dialogue be first to address ' Western Academic engagements with Vedanta largesse ( and by this I cover the ( Vyasa / Veda/ Brahma/ Yoga) -Darshana-Shaastra's)' after starting with the flavor of ' Dvaita Vedanta' ?



2b ) Can the organizers provide a ' session- track' on the same
platform to address the ' Paradigms of Modeling the Languages of
Religion, Philosophy and Metaphysics in East and West' ?



 I offer to take this initiative to address the challenges in developing a session stream addressing ' Modeling Samskrutham : The core language of Vision (vedas), Contemplation (Sutra- Bhashyas), Discourse ( Gita -Vyakhyana) and Prayer ( Stotra)'. By default, this will also cover all the Brahmi languages including the related Dramidam and Prakruths.



I suppose the suggested title is good enough to see the scope of the session and whom it may interest, and importance of the same for the main theme of the seminar.



Look forward for Organizers interest and the interest expression from other interested members in off line mode.



Regards

BVK Sastry
