Dear All,  
You are cordially invited to join this seminar.

Earlier traditional scholars wereignorant orused to ignore about what their Western counterparts wrote in European languages. But that situation has changed little bit atleast with reference to Dvaita Vedanta where not so young like myself and other young scholars are ready to understand and reply it.  

But situation does not improve unless there happens a fave to face dialogue between them.

This is the first such dialogue happening between Indian and Western colleagues who are working on Dvaita Vedanta.  

I hope it is a small step towards filling this gap.

We welcome all the people to work in Dvaita Vedanta, one of the great philosophies, irrespective of their cast creed and nationality.
