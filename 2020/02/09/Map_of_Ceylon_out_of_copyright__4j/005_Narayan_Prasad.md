Thank you for your reply.

  

\<\<Even if it's not out of copyright, one can make a remake.>\>

  

Yes, it can be done. But it would be too late for publication. I have to hurry up.

  

\<\<Indeed, old bw Indian maps are hard to find.>\>

  

It need not necessarily be black and white. It could be in colour. But it should be out of copyright.

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
