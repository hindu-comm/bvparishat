Dear Scholars,  

   Namaste.

  

   I am searching a map of Ceylon (out of copyright) for my book "Sketches of Ceylon and India" (as English translation from Russian) that is to be published soon. The text is related to a travelogue dated 1874.

  

  One scholar has suggested "The Road Map of India" that was published from Calcutta in 1928. I have not seen it. If it is out of copyright, it could be available somewhere on the public domain. Could anybody indicate its link?

  

   Thanks andregards

   Narayan Prasad
