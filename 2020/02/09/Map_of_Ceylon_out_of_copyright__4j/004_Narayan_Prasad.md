Dear Dr Irene,

    Namaste.

    I require just the locations of different place names in the map of Ceylon. As I mentioned in my first message, the text is related to travels in Ceylon in 1874. That time trains were already in use.

  So any map (out of copyright) of Ceylon giving place names and dating from 1870s to say about 1930s could do. Any map dealing with prior to 1860s will not be useful.

  The link you have provided for the book, although published in 1945, gives maps of 18th century or earlier.

  

  Here, the main issue is that of copyright. I cannot include in the book any copyrighted map. The publisher will not agree.

  

  If the Ceylon map (including South India) published in "The Road Map of India", published from Calcutta in 1928 is out of copyright, I can get it on personal request from a scholar owning this book.

  

    With kind regards

    Narayan Prasad
