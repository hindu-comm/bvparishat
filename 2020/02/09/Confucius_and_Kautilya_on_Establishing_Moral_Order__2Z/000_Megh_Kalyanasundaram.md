{Abstract} "The main objectives of this paper are of two kinds: first one may be described as historical in the sense of correcting more than two thousand years of misinterpretations of the ideas of Confucius and Kautilya on establishing a moral order and the nature of its relationship to the legalistic approach; the second one is to highlight the relevance of moral order not only to create peace and harmony but also enhance the creation and sharing of knowledge and lowering of transaction costs. Since both creation and sharing of knowledge depend on genuine trust, which flourishes only in an ethical environment, and not in a “culture of suspicion”. It is indicated that their insights or pearls of wisdom are actually more relevant to today’s knowledge-based economies than they were to economies during their own times. They would have emphasized the warming of hearts to each other to solve the problem of global warming."

  

{Concluding observations} "Ethical environment encourages both trust and transparency, which help in changing the “culture of suspicion” and thus in reducing the need to take defensive measures. In recent years the words transparency and accountability have taken hold of our imagination. Transparency is understood as the full and accurate disclosure of relevant information in a simple format and timely fashion. Almost exclusively, the emphasis has been on rule- based transparency, such as legislations regarding shareholders right to know how much a CEO gets paid and consumers right to know the calories or fat content in the meals restaurants serve. Similarly, many regulatory agencies have been created to protect against the trust deficit rather than to eliminate the trust-deficit.

  

There has been very little if any emphasis or effort on the ethics-based transparency or trust. Honest, truthful and fair-minded individuals do not see the need to hide any information from any one. Similarly, ethical corporations do not engage in the practices of cooking the books for defrauding the stakeholders. Ethics-based transparency provides two types of benefits: it allows consumers and investors in allocating their resources in an optimal way and governments need not spend any time writing disclosure rules and devoting resources in enforcing them (i.e. it improves efficiency and lowers transaction costs). Rules-based transparency should be considered only as a complement to the ethics-based transparency.

  

Finally, according to both Confucius and Kautilya, creation of ethical environment may be essential to improving the environment. They would have strongly recommended holding conferences in New Delhi or Beijing, like the one just concluded in Paris, on creating ethical environment for solving problem of global warming fairly and quickly."
