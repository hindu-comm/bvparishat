Vijayananda ji

  

Namaste.

  

There are four 'vrittis' (usually vritti is the name given to the kind of text that you desire) that I know of on the Brahmasutras from an Advaitic point of view, but they are not really short.

  

Sadasivendra Saraswati's vritti is available at<https://archive.org/details/Brahmasutra_Vritti_Sadasivendra_Sarasvati_1909_SVV/mode/2up>

Haridikshita's vritti -<https://archive.org/details/ass082brahmasutravrittiofharidikshitaranganathsastrivaidya1917_202002/page/n9/mode/2up>

Brahmavidyananda's vritti -<https://archive.org/details/brahmasutravritti/page/n1/mode/2up>

Ramananda Saraswati's vritti called Brahmamritvarshini is available at<https://archive.org/details/brahmasutravritti/page/n1/mode/2up>

Senani
