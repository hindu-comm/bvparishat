While I am not aware of any such work for Advaita, there is this work of Sri Vidyaranya called 'वैयासिकन्यायमाला' which summarizes each adhikaraNam with samshaya, purvapaksha and siddhanta, in two verses each. I think you can get this book online for purchase or as a standalone pdf. This entire work, however, is included in the BSB of Shankaracharya with Bhashyaratnaprabha, Bhamati and Nyayanirnaya, where at the beginning of every adhikarana, the nyayamala shlokas of that adhikarana are printed.

  

You can also see these shlokas, interwoven with the BSB, here:<https://advaitasharada.sringeri.net/display/bhashyaVyakhya/BS?vyakhya=VN>
