Please refer to the Brahmasutrabhashya (BSB) of Sankaracharya for the Advaita view and Sribhashya of Ramanujacharya for the Visishtadvaita view. Both these are commentaries on 'just the Brahmasutras'.

  

Also, in Advaita you may refer to the commentary of Sankaracharya on the Bhagavadgita and the ten principal upanishads, which together with the BSB are the key commentaries of the tradition.along with the Gaudapada-karikas, which are a commentary on the Mandukya-upanishad.

  

In Visishtadvaita, there is a commentary of Ramanujacharya on the Bhagavadgita. A separate commentary on the Upanishads in the Visishtadvaita tradition has been composed by a later acharya, Rangaramanujacharya.

  

Regards

N. Siva Senani
