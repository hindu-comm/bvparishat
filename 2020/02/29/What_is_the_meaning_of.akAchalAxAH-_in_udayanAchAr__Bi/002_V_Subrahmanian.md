There is an entry for काचाक्षः  and no काचलाक्षः

  

<https://kosha.sanskrit.today/word/sa/kAcAkSa>

  

kAcAkza m. ‘glass-eyed’, N. of an aquatic bird, Suśr. i, २०५, १४.

  

##### Vachaspatyam

काचाक्ष  

पुंस्त्री काच इवाक्षि अस्य षच् समा० । वकभेदे स्त्रियां जातित्वेऽपि संयोगोपधत्वात् न ङीष् किन्तु षित्त्वात् ङीष् इति भेदः । अयञ्च प्लवः सबचारी च सुश्रुतेनोक्तः यथा हंससारसेत्याद्युपक्रमे काचाक्ष- मल्लिकाक्षेत्यादीनुक्त्वा “प्लवाः संघचारिणश्च” ।

  

It is possible that this bird has something to do with this phenomenon.
It could be refraction and use of glass prism. In Vedanta नभोनैल्यम् is admitted to be an adhyasa.
