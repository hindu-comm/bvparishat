Namaste

  

While reading Udayanācārya's commentary Kiraṇāvalī on Buddhivaidharmya of Padārthadharmasaṅgraha, I came across a portion of 'viparyaya', where he discusses two explanations regarding why the sky appears blue. After quoting some view of Patañjali, which says that some Indranīlamaya Śikhara causes the sky to appear blue, Udayanācārya says; "tatra kācalākṣāḥ sākṣīkartumucitāḥ". I checked the Rasasāra commentary of Bhaṭṭavādīndra, but he does not appear comment on the said sentence. Same is with Vardhamāna Upādhyāya.

  

Hence I request the scholars to kindly guide me as to what is the meaning of 'Kācalākṣāḥ' here.

  

Regards
