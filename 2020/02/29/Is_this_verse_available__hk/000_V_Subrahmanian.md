A verse that talks of the following details is required from a text:  

  

According to mythology the Lord Jagganath (a form of Vishnu) stays or sleeps in Dwaraka, takes his bath at Rameshswaram, does his prayers at Badrinath, while dropping by Puri for his meals.  

  

Any leads to the above is welcome.

  

Thanks andregards
