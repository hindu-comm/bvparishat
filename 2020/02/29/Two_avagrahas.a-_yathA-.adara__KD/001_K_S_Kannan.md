In the case of SavarNa-dIrgha-sandhi,

where the latter word begins with a long A,

double avagraha is used.

This helps disambiguation (though only partly).

  

In one of my own books, I have innovatively extended this benefit

to I and U (long vowels) also - in order to be more user-friendly.

(I have not come across such deployment by others earlier.)

  

One must differentiate this from

the same notation used in music books indicating elongation of vowel sound.

The Wikipedia entry needs some improvement no doubt.
