Namaste sir,

  Charaka Samhita edited and published by shree gulabaunverba Ayurvedic society , few volumes may be present in KLEU sri B.M.Kanakanawadi Ayurveda Mahavidyalaya Belagavi karnataka.

       Now At present we are not using this version ,it's very difficult to get all volumes .

we are using Cakrapani teeka edited by Yadavaji Trikamaji, 

 Hindi translations by Dr Harischandra kushavaha, Ravidattta tripati, and many more authors.

              If i get any information regarding
gulabkuverba edition will inform you sir.
