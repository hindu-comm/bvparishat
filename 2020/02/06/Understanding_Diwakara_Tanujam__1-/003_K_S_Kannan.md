One can almost say musicians are *fond of* slaughtering texts,

so regular they are seen paying no heed to the proper wordings.

  

A famous singer has created all the variants she could think of

- a very democratic approach perhaps in these days of ebullient liberalism.

The original (*bAla kanakamaya-cela* in the *rAga aThANa : elA nI dayarAdu*)

has thus been (wo)manhandled by the singer:

***danuja-samhAra*** of the text is sung with spontaneously generated  

pathetic (read pathological) *pAThAntara*-s:

*tanuja-samhAra*

*danuja-samsAra*

*tanuja-samsAra...*

Best not to reveal her name, quite a famous singer.
