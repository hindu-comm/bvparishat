Thank you everyone.

  

The musicians butchering the text is no different from the non-musicians butchering shlokas. I do however agree with the overall sentiment that lyrical fidelity takes a back seat.

  

I remember a famous duo singing the line in "Tamil krithi on Subramanya swamy -"karthikai pendir anaithum valarthaan" instead of "karthikai pengal anaippil valarndhaan". Instead of singing Subramanya was raised by the krithitka mothers, they sang Subramanya raised the krithitka mothers. Tamil is the singers' mother tongue as well!

  

Whether it's the Malinivijayottara tantra or the Malini mantra, how does it tie back to Shanaischara?

  

Thank you,

Ram.
