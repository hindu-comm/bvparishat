मालिनी may refer to the Malinimantra which is mentioned in connection with the Guruvandana practised by the SriVidya Upasaka-s;

A verse of which the second half is: मालिनीमन्त्रराजसहितं वन्दे गुरोर्मण्डलम्। is to be recited by all the Srividya Upasaka-s daily.

  

May be one can refer to the रश्मिमालामन्त्र which again contains many mantra-s to be recited by the SriVidya Upasaka-s before commencing their daily worship. रश्मिमालामन्त्र can be found in the Nityotsava of Umanandanatha.

So Malini does not mean Maliniviyottaratantra; Sri Dikshitar is not in the habit of referring to any particular text in his Kriti-s.
