NamastE,

  

I was going through "Diwakara Tanujam", by Sri. Muthuswami Deekshithar. While I was attempting to understand the krithi at the vak-artha level, I ran into a wall with two phrases.

  

"Malinee vinutha Guruguha muditam"

"Kaala chakra bheda Chitra bhaanum"

  

For "Malinee vinutha", the explanation [here](http://www.shivkumar.org/music/divakarathanujam.htm)says he is worshipped by the Maalini mantra. Anyone knows what that mantra is? Is there a different meaning to the phrase?

  

For "Kaala chakra bheda Chitra bhaanum", the explanation is that he is the fire who breaks the cycle of time. I don't understand this.

  

Anyone else has more insights?

  

Thank you,

ram.
