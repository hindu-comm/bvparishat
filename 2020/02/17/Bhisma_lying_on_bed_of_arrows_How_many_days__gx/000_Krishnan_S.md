Respected Scholars,

*Background:*

I recently attended a discourse on Mahabharat. The topic was Bheeshma’s departure from the earth of ‘Anushaasana Parva’.



The pauranikar was referring to the following sloka

**अष्टपञ्चाशतं रात्रयः शयानस्याद्य मे गताः।शरेषु निशिताग्नेषु यथा वर्षशतं तथा॥**13-273-27 (92306)

He translated this as below

**“I have been lying on my bed here for eight and fifty nights. Stretched on these sharp-pointed arrows I am feeling as if it was a century”.**

****

The pauranikar concluded saying the ‘For 58 days Bhishma was lying in the bed of arrows, and then left his mortal coil’

*My question*

Assuming that the time–reckoning of those days, was by lunar (ending in Purnima) calendar, I get

*Event 1*: War starts on Gita Jayanti day (Margasirsha Sukla Ekadasi)

*Event* 2: Bhishma falls—10^(th) day (Paushya Krishna Panchami

*Event 3 :* War ends -- 18^(th) day (Paushya Krishna Tryodasi

*Event 4:* Bhishma Mukti -- Bhismaashtmi day (Magha Sukla Ashtami)

  

Now the period between Event 2 and Event 4, I get is 48 days. (25 days in Paushya month and 23 days in Magha month)

  

Am I missing something?
