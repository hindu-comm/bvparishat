Sir

  

War started on Amavaasya, not ekaadaSI.

  

Gita jayanti is celebrated on ekaadaSI as Gita was known to the world on ekaadaSI, and not amaavaasya. Why? Time froze, or folded upon itself if you prefer to put it in such terms, when Krishna was preaching the Gita. Essentially none of the warriors on either side knew that Krishna and Arjuna had such a lengthy discussion (even a paaraayaNa of the Gita takes more than 3 hours). So though Gita was taught on Krishna on amaavaasya, it was not known to anyone.

  

Sanjaya observes the war for ten days and on the tenth night goes to Dhritarashtra to report that Bhishma has fallen. Thus it is during ekaadaSI time that the Gita got revealed to the world through the mouth of Sanjaya and so the jayanti is celebrated on that day.

  

This explains the difference of ten days.

  

Regards

Senani
