Dear List,

  

(Especially for the members in the twin cities of Hyderabad-Secunderabad)

  

The School of Humanities, University of Hyderabad is organising the following event

  

Sri Gunturu Seshendra Sarma Endowment Lecture

Speaker: Prof K S Kannan

Venue: Auditorium, School of Humanities

Date: 19th Feb 2020

Time: 3 pm

  

Title: ***Vakrokti-jīvita* : A Novel Perspective in Indian Poetics**

  

**Abstract:**

  

*Vakrokti-jīvita* is a unique work written in charming Sanskrit by Kuntaka,  

a 10th Century Poetician of Kashmir. This work written by a master of style anticipates or parallels many Western ideas of rhetorics and stylistics.  

Arriving between Ānandavardhana and Abhinavagupta, the twin giants of the Dhvani School, Kuntaka was well acquainted with the former and indeed influenced the latter. Blessed though with hardly any followers to continue his tradition, Kuntaka sought to reframe, if not reset, many figures of speech.  

The role of the poetic genius or *pratibhā* has been elegantly captured in his work.

  

The talk focusses on the Indian setting of his work primarily,  

and evaluates some of his significant contributions.

  

All are welcome.
