Namaste

  

The following verse is seen cited in several texts, especially in Sahityadarpana, Dasarupaka, Rajatarangini, etc. In some Hindi books it is shown as from Valmiki Ramayana. But the search is not showing up VR resource. Could anyone kindly throw light on the source?  

  

आहूतस्याभिषेकाय विसृष्टस्य वनाय च।  
  
न मया लक्षितस्तस्य स्वलपोऽप्याकारविभ्रमः।।  

  

Thanks andregards
