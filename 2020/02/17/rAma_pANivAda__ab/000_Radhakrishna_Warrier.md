Shri Sugyankumar Mohanty’s post on the work of Rāma Pāṇivāda is interesting.  



Rāma Pāṇivāda has been identified by many stalwarts of Malayalam literature / history with the master of Malayalam satirist poetry, Kunchan Nambiar (Kuñcaṉ Nampyār കുഞ്ചൻ നമ്പ്യാർ, CE 1705-1770, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunchan_Nambiar>). At the same time, there are also those who disagree with this identification. Those who disagree agree that both were contemporaries, belonged to the same caste and even same family, and were from the same place, but say they were different individuals because of the difference in their styles. The style of Rāma Pāṇivāda is correct, chaste and lucid. The style of Kunchan Nambiar is irreverent, boisterously witty and full of topical anachronisms. Nambiar’s Dēvalōkaṃ is populated by Namboodiris (Malayala Brahmins), Nairs, Pattars (Tamil Brahmins) and other castes of Kerala.
The landscape of the heavens has the rivers, hills and backwaters of Kerala. He makes fun of every caste and social segment, more so of the Nair and the Paṭṭar.

Here is an example of an irreverent witty poem of his. The king of Ambalappuzha built a lighthouse on the seashore and organized a grand function on the day of its inauguration. Poets sang of the magnificence of the lighthouse and of the king’s grand role in building the lighthouse in aid of the seafaring traders and their ships. Kunchan Nambiar had a short, succinct poem:



Dīpastaṃbhaṃ mahāścaryaṃ 

Namukkuṃ kiṭṭaṇaṃ paṇaṃ



ദീപസ്തംഭം മഹാശ്ചര്യം, 

നമുക്കും കിട്ടണം പണം



"The Deepa-Stambham (lighthouse) is magnificent, and we too want our share of money."



Needless to say Kunchan Nambiar received the largest reward for his witty poem that succinctly described the real aim of all those who composed poems in praise of the lighthouse and the king.



“Pāṇivāda” is a Sanskritization of the surname Nambiar. The traditional duty of the Nambiars is to play the drum called miẓāvŭ (മിഴാവു്) in temples. Sometimes Sanskritization of surnames takes weird forms. I have seen my own surname Sanskritized as Vārija, alluding to an origin from lotus. This is just a play on the similarity of the sounds of words. Actually, in ancient Malayalam and Tamil, vāriyam means an office, a department etc., and a Vāriyar is the head of an office, or a department head. In addition to their role in temple rituals, my ancestors were also vested traditionally with the duty of administering the temples. Hence the surname Vāriyar which is nowadays spelt in English variously as Warrier, Wariyar, Varier and so on.
