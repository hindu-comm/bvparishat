NamasteAll,

 I am also interested to know if detailed pictorial representations of Ramayana and Mahabharata availablein the form of book. I see very good pictures/art work in the books published by Gita Press, Gorakhpur but they are very few in number. Kindly let me know if there is any source for this. I bought books like Balala bommala Ramayanam but I am particularly looking for the kind of pictures published by Gita Press. Thank you!  

With best regards  
Suresh
