Dear Marcis,

  

  The Marathi Puranic texts Harivijaya, Rāmavijaya, Pāṇḍva-Pratāpa, and several more were printed by the Nirnaya Sagara Press with beautiful illustrations for each Adhyaya, and I grew up looking at them because my grand-mother used to read those pothis every day. I have scanned some of those.
