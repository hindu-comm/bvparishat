Here is one example of where Shankara accepts that Aparoksha Jnana can be there for a non-sannyasin:

  

त्यक्त्वाकर्मफलासङ्गंनित्यतृप्तोनिराश्रयः।  
कर्मण्यभिप्रवृत्तोऽपिनैवकिञ्चित्करोतिसः॥ २० ॥ Bh.Gita 4.20. The word 'abhi-pravrutto'spi' Even though one is involved in excessive action...the jnani is really not doing anything, he is a non-actor, akartaa alone. For this Shankara says:विदुषा क्रियमाणं कर्म परमार्थतोऽकर्मैव, तस्य निष्क्रियात्मदर्शनसम्पन्नत्वात्। तेन एवंभूतेन स्वप्रयोजनाभावात् ससाधनं कर्म परित्यक्तव्यमेव इति प्राप्ते, ततः निर्गमासम्भवात् लोकसङ्ग्रहचिकीर्षया शिष्टविगर्हणापरिजिहीर्षया वा पूर्ववत् कर्मणि अभिप्रवृत्तोऽपिनिष्क्रियात्मदर्शनसम्पन्नत्वात् नैव किञ्चित् करोति सः ॥ २० ॥ Here is a scenario: A person, a householder, when gets aparoksha jnana, sees no use for the actions and has to necessarily leave them (and take sannyasa). However, he is in a situation where it is not possible for him to renounce action/homeततः निर्गमासम्भवात्... he will continue to engage in those actions as are ordained for his stage of life, householder, as before, pUrvavat, but without the idea of 'I am the doer', as he has realized that the Atman that is really he is a non-doer as Atman has no organs that can engage in action, and will do them for loka sangraha: being a role model for others who are not jnanis and or to free the ignorant from censuring this man: 'Look, this man, a householder, is sitting idle without doing the enjoined duties, how bad of him' = शिष्टविगर्हणापरिजिहीर्षया .. 

  

Thus here is an example of Shankara accepting Atma Aparoksha Jnana for a non-sannyasin.

  

Regarding the 'sampradaya', it is the vaidika sampradaya. What he says there is: Even if a person has great learning, scholarship in many disciplines like tarka, vyakarana, mimamsaa, etc. if that learning is not in accordance with the shruti sampradaya that has come down from our ancestors in the traditional line, such a 'scholar' has to be rejected as one would, in the world, not pay heed to an ignorant man's words.
