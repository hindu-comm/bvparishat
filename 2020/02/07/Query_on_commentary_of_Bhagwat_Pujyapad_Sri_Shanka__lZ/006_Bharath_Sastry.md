Namaste

  

My two cents: There is a beautiful shloka which says these five people are called gnani's irrespective of there Dharma they followed.

  

कृष्णो भोगी शुक: त्यागी नृपौजनकरघवौ \| वशिश्ठ कर्मकर्था च पञ्चैते ज्ञानिनास्म्रुता \|\|  

  

Krishna was a bhogi with lot of gopikas around, Shuka maharshi was a renunciate, Lord Rama & Janaka they were ruling the kingdom & finally Vashistha being a purohita performing fire rituals daily.
