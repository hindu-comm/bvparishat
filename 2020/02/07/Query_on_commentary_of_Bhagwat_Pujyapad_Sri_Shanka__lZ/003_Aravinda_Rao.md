Dear Kulkarni ji,

This is a rather contentious question posed by you. Liberation or moksha is not merely for a samnyasi but also for a grihastha who is on the

jnana path. No one will say that Krishna was not a jnani, but he was a grihastha. There is the concept of Jnani karma in the Gita and all through in Vedanta. King Janaka and several other rajarshi-s were doing their karma as jnani-s and not as karma yogi-s. They were not bound by their karma.

We know that the Gita was told by a man of action to another man of action who faced an ethical dilemma. Krishna had to give him a big picture of dharma. His message, as I understand form my teachers, is, 'keep the cosmic scheme in view, rising above raga, dvesha etc, and perform your action, and it would be right'.
