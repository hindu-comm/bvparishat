Hare Krishna.  
  
There is critical edition of Mahabharata produced by Bhandarkar  
Oriental, Pune, and is now available in searchable devanagari etc.  
html formats on sanskrit documents website.  
  
Another searchable edition of Mahabharata is available on gretil website at:  
<http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/2_epic/mbh/mbh_13_u.htm>  
etc.  
  
  
However, I found that some verses available on gretil edition are  
missing in BORI edition. For instance the famous verse:  
13,135.142d\*0639_03 ākāśāt patitaṃ toyaṃ yathā gacchati sāgaram  
13,135.142d\*0639_04 sarvadevanamaskāraḥ keśavaṃ prati gacchati  
  
appears at the end of Visnu-sahasranama in gretil edition but not in  
BORI edition.  
  
So I would like to know which edition is more complete, Gretil or BORI?  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
