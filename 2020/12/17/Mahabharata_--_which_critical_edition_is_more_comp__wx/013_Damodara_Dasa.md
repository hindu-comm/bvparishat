Hare Krishna.  
  
Respected scholars,  
Thankyou very much for this valuable discussion.  

  
\>\> Hence, I personally feel all critical editions are complete in their own way. One may follow any one of the editions to conduct their respective research.  
  

Yes I understand this. My sense of using the word complete was  
basically to see which one contains all the probable verses; but as  
respected scholars have kindly clarified here, they have their  
methodologies to find out which verse may not form the part of  
original text and thus have omitted them. As the methodologies may  
differ, the verses that are omitted or included may also differ, and  
hence there are some differences in the critical editions.  
  
Arjuna Sir's effort is laudable and I am enthusiastic to have a look  
at his documents. Thankyou for that.  
  
My purpose was to get an edition of Mahabharata which contains all the  
probable verses. Now I understand that critical editons may have  
differences and thus something like the "Union" of all critical  
editions may help. This can have "Intersection" verses of all of them  
included as main text, with other verses marked (with their critical  
editions) as not available in certain editions.  
  
Okay. Now I know that the four critical editions -- BORI, Kumbhakonam,  
Ganguly and Gitapress can be used to reach to above document. Let's  
see how much I can do.  
  
Also, as far as I know, the text on gretil is from BORI edition,  
correct me if I am wrong. Can anyone explain what is the significance  
of \*s and @s in verse numbers there.
