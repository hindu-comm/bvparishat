Namaste to all!

  

It is quite difficult to say which one is more complete. All the critical editions followed a specific methodology and noteworthy effort of many scholars is also involved in the process of their creation. we can not decide a particular edition as complete merely for having more stories or verses. The scholars have logically explained why those omissions/addition of those important sections are done in the beginning of the each critical editions (the prolegomena of BORI, the preface of Kumbhakonam, short introduction of Sastri-Vavilla to mention a few). Hence, I personally feel all critical editions are complete in their own way. One may follow any one of the editions to conduct their respective research.

  

Our MAHE Mahabharata research project is focused on putting together most of the critical editions in one interface and highlight the similarities and differences among them. Currently, we have above-mentioned three critical editions and we may include few more in future. We proof-read all those three critical-editions and made error-free (thank you, Dr Mārcis Gasūns, for highlighting it). We have abeta versionof the[digital concordance](http://mahabharata.manipal.edu/#/simdissim)for those three critical editions along with a[Mahabharata search engine](http://mahabharata.manipal.edu/#/search)(word and praatipadika level search in Devanāgari notation) for all the three editions.

  

Regards,

Arjuna
