In that case, Kumbhakonam critical edition has more number of verses - 96,635 (which also marks the omitted in other editions) compared to BORI critical edition (73796 verses) and Sastri-Vavilla critical edition (95,286 verses). I am not aware of the other critical editions exact verse numbers.

I think Shri KM Ganguli's work is an English translation work of the Mahabharata, not a critical edition.

Yes, GRETIL has BORI edition developed by John Smith and Muneo Tokunaga. You nay look into this site -<http://www.mahabharata-resources.org/> for more resources related to the Mahabharata.

  

I could not see \*s/@s in verse numbers. A screenshot might help us to locate it.
