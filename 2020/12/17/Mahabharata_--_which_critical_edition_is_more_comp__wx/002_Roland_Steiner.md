Dear Damodara Das,  

  
  
  
\> However, I found that some verses available on gretil edition are  
\> missing in BORI edition. For instance the famous verse:  
\> 13,135.142d\*0639_03 ākāśāt patitaṃ toyaṃ yathā gacchati sāgaram  
\> 13,135.142d\*0639_04 sarvadevanamaskāraḥ keśavaṃ prati gacchati  
\>  
\> appears at the end of Visnu-sahasranama in gretil edition but not in  
\> BORI edition.  
  

Stanzas marked with an asterisk will be found in the critical  
apparatus of the printed version of the critical BORI edition (see  
attachment).  
  
With best regards,  
Roland Steiner
