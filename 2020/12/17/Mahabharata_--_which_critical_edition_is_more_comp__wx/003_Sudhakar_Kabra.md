Dear Damodar Das ji,

Hare Krishna.

  

In Mahabharata you cannot say which edition is more complete. It is a big epic and differences are bound to be found.

Also there are many intertwined episodes which is often referred to in Mahabharata.

  

Prof P. Lal (who also wrote a transliteration of Mahabharata and under whom I studied) used to say:

To check the authenticity ask the person to show a reference to :

  

1\. Mahabharata By Gitapress Gorakhpur.

  

2\. Mahabharat By Poona Bhandarkar edition.

  

3\. Mahabharata By Kishori Mohan Ganguly.

  

If it can be found there authenticity can be considered otherwise take it as author addition. (Devdutta Patnaik etc)

In Ramayana it is Valmiki Ramayana and Tulsidas as considered authentic.

  

So the point is not more complete or less but authentic or not. The difference as explained is path bheda.

  

Thanks and regards

Sudhakar kabra.
