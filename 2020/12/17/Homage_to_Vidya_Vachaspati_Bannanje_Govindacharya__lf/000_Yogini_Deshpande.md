Namaste,

  

On December 13, 2020 Sanatan Dharma lost one of its most illustrious scholars in the contemporary times -Vidya Vachaspati Bannanje Govindacharya. A scholar par excellence, his demise is an incalculable loss to the Dharmic community as a whole. Indic Today has published a tribute in his memory.
