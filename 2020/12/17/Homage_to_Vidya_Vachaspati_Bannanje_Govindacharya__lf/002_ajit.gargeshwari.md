Dear Prof Kannan,

Karnataka and different parts of India have several scholars who have written or edited hundred plus books during their life times and either from government grants or from their own funds and have got them published over several decades. No comprehensive bibliography is available. I only see condolence messages here ,which has little value if their writing are not read ,criticized, preserved, enjoyed by readers and scholars

To name A few Prof K.T. Pandurangi a list of all his works including articles written and published by him

Vidvan Bannaje Govindacharya

Vidvan Ranganth Sharma

S.K. Ramachandra Rao and so on

I don't even know about a comprehensive bibliography of great living Scholars such

Prof. Radha Vallabh Tripathi and many more

I don't even know all the works written and published even by you

Regards

Ajit Gargeshwari
