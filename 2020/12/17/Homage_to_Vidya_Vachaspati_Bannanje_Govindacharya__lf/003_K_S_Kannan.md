Dear Gargeswari,

  

Thank you for corroborating with and confirming my own thoughts and concerns.

  

The only ray of hope, I feel, is Indic Academy which has been taking up many good projects,

fired as it is with a new vision. I do not know if the Academy is already overburdened.  

  

This work must, anyhow, start somewhere. Can it start with you, for example, with but a small step?

*If* there is a word of assent from IA, can you provide such bibliographical ref.s  

(*just page no.s from & to*) as are available in *just 5* Commemorative/Festschrift volumes?

(Are there any such volumes for SKRamachandra Rao or Ranganatha Sharma or others?)  

That may serve as a good trigger, inspiration, and guide.

  

And bringing in my name,  

you have committed a Paninian mistake (6.4.133).

  

Regards

KSKannan
