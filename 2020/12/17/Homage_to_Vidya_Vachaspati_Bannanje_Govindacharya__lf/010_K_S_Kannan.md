An ideal format is one such as of VRaghavan.

Better ones, if any, may be suggested,

or improved upon.  

  

Summary and assessment in just about a hundred words of each book/article

could be a great enough welcome uniform size for each.

Plus links/pointers to book reviews in journals etc.

(Focus on Indian journals could be a bonus!

\- as Western ones could be accessible via Jstor etc.,

and we are not blessed with an Indian counterpart of Jstor as yet).
