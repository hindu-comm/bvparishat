Regular updating of RSS (2012) suggested by Gargeswari is an excellent idea.

Online updating should not be very difficult - at least not as much as getting one in hard print.

Going by the difficulties indicated by Gargeswari,

IA can act as a permanent repository for whosoever among our authors is willing  

to share their articles. Our journals must also act cooperatively.

  

Periodical reports in respect of progress may be made available to BVP.
