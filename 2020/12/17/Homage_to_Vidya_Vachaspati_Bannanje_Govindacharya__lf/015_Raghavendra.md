\<\<\<I only see condolence messages here, which has little value if their writing are not read ,criticized, preserved, enjoyed by readers and scholars>\>\>

  

Books and research articles of both BGA and KTP are all available in print. Review and criticism of them should not be a problem at all.

  

Aghast to see irresponsible comment that condolence messages have \*little value\*. Not sure, how it has become valueless.

  

If at all there is one thing that is \*valued and respected\* cutting across humanity is the expression of condolence.

  

Condolence is not always expression of sorrow or grief, if that is what behind the careless comment, condolence is a fellow-feeling or sharing of common feeling.

  

Original query was relating toBibliography if available of eminent scholars of the recent past, an institution came forward to assist financially for project of that nature which will help build an authentic Bibliography, suggestions were being made of those great-men-of-letters whose works have to be brought under the project, and in the midst of such a noble minded conversation, it is sad indeed to see an unsavoury comment relating to condolence message.

  

Thank you and Best regards,

Raghavendra Bheemasena Rao.

We can add Sri Sachidanandendra Saraswati Swaminah, Holenarasipur, Karnataka, who has authored more than 200 books, papers, etc. in Kannada and Sanskrit.
