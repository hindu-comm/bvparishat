Thanks Sri Yoganand Ji and Amaraji for pointing out to to website

  

The problems with websites are that the urls or the website themselves are not perpetually preserved . These sites last for a few years and due to lack of funds or interests their contents disappearafter a few years.

For example see website created for the great scholarPandit Pandharinathacharya Galagali The website<http://pandhareenathacharya.org/> does not existnow

As of now[Pandharinathacharya Galagali - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandharinathacharya_Galagali)seems the only permanent link.

  

Inventory of Sanskrit Scholars RadhaVallabh Tripathi Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan 2012 which can be updated and revised. All scholars who have published works and articles need to be accurately documented and should be releasedas ebooks in several volumes. If the copyrightholders do permit links to their articles if not to their books should be made available by clickingon hyperlinks in such a pdf document. The articles should be stored on site which give perpetual accessto such materials.  

  

Not just sanskrit scholars keepinginterdisciplinaryresearchers in mind it should cover all aspects of indological studies.

  

Indic academy under the able leadership, scholarly directors is a great and perfect place to approach. I thank Prof Paturi ji for always promptly supporting such and related activities keeping in mind rigourand comprehensiveness needed for such research.

न जायते म्रियते वा कदाचिन्नायं भूत्वा भविता वा न भूयः।  
अजो नित्यः शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणो न हन्यते हन्यमाने शरीरे।।2.20।।
