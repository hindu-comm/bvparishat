I am deeply saddened by the demise of Prof. Roddam Narasimha. He was a versatile genius and a good human being. I knew him well for nearly five decades from my IISc days. Worked with him at CAOS. Our common interest used to be very often, nonlinearity and randomness in nature, in engineering systems, and History of Indian Science. He released my book Parasharatantra in 2013 at the Mythic society, Bangalore. He spoke eloquently on the importance of tracing the links between Vedic thoughts and later mathematical traditions of Siddhantic astronomy. He was a multifaceted person with deep interest in Sanskrit and Indic knowledge traditions.

Shantih Shantih Shantih.
