He was a great scholar. I also have not met him. I invited him for a conference on Indian Intellectual Traditions. Though he was not able to come, his response was encouraging one and evinced warmth. Besides, his close associate, Prof. P. P. Divakaran, has always been eloquent about the good academic and an excellent human being in him. I admire him for the balance view he held regarding the contribution of ancient Indians to scientific disciplines.
