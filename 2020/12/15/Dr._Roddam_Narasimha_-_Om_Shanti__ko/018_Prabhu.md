I read a very interesting conversation with Prof Roddam Narasimha in this edition of themathematics magazine "[Bhāvanā](http://bhavana.org.in/)".  

<http://bhavana.org.in/category/april-2017/>  

Among other interesting things in the conversation is the nostalgic throw back to the 40s' and 50s' Bangalore life!

  

The same edition carries another article on the history of "String Equation" which includes Prof. Roddam Narasimha's formulation of nonlinear vibration of elastic strings.

Prabhu
