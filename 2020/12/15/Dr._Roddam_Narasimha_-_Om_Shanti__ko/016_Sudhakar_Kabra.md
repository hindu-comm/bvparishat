Namaste,

  

I am from Indian Institute of Science Bangalore 1976-78 batch. Prof R Narsimha took a few classes for us in one of the courses

as per the instructions of then Director Dr Satish Dhawan.. An excellent teacher in fluid dynamics course.

  

Our interaction was only for a short period but profound. Deeply saddened to hear about this news. May his soul get sadagati.
