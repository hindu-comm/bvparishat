Prof. Roddam Narasimha (RN) was on the SAC (Student Advisory Committee)  

of the PhD of my wife Meera. She and I had many occasions to interact with him,

even at his residence.  

  

RN and Rajiv Malhotra shared the dias at IISc, and the two shared some concerns.

He had accepted to write a few words by way of blurb to the volume of chronology

I am editing, but he could not, owing to failing health.

  

RN was writing on some portions of *Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha*, where he took some help from me.

The book is in the press I am told.  

  

An avid reader, he had a vast collection of books, of which a significant portion  

was gifted to NIAS, Bangalore. He was fairly knowledgeable in the Indian contribution to science,

and his views were quite balanced. I guess he even wrote about it in *Current Science*.  

Some of his words on this theme were recently cited, aptly indeed, by Prof. Amba Kulkarni  

in a recent talk of hers where I presided over.

  

May he attain *sadgati*.
