Extremely sorry to receive this news. Prof. Narasimha was my project advisor when I was a Master of Engineering student in the then Aeronautical Engineering Department of IISc. He taught us a number of aerodynamics related courses. I cannot forget some of his Gas Dynamics lectures. With a booming voice and a complete mastery of the subject matter, he captivated our attention like few others. Later he turned his attention to Adhyatma, and was equally influential in that arena, as far as I can surmise. His mahaprasthanaleaves a void in the lives of all who had any connection with him.

  

May the good Lord give his family, and the extended family of students and colleagues the mental fortitude to bear the loss, and may the good Lord elevate his soul to ever higheradhyatmiclevel.

  

Thank you.
