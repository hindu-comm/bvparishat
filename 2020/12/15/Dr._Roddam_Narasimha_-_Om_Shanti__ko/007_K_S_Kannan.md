Dear Amba-ji,

Would it be possible to provide to BVParishat a copy of the article of Roddam Narasimha

in *Current Science*, as it would act as an eye-opener and give a sound sense of direction and balance  

(badly required by many Sanskritists who tend to swing to one extreme or another)?

Regards

KSKannan
