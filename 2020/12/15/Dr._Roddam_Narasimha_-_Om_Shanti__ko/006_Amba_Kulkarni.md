Though I never met Prof Roddam Narasimha, I deeply cherish the communication with him I had when I was a student at IIT Kanpur informing him about the work I was doing on the Technical Language of Navya Nyaaya with Prof Vineet Chaitanya and Prof Rajeev Sangal, some 25 years ago. And he promptly replied to the letter with his blessings.

  

He had a very balanced stand about the contribution of Indians in the past in various disciplines. After the controversiesover the section on Indian sciences organised during the Science Congress at Mumbai, he wrote a very good article published in Current Science (Vol 108. No 4 25th Feb 2015) on the two polarized views about the History of Indian Sciences, and how both the camps have gone too far.

  

We have lost a genius, a strong supporter, and an admirer of India's scientific contribution without having any prejudices.

  

May he attain the sadgati.
