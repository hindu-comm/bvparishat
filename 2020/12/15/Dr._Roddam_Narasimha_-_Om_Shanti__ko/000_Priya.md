Deeply saddened by the news of Dr. Roddam Narasimha's passing. Besides his professional career in aerospace engineering and science education at the highest levels, he was a largely self-taught and inspiring scholar of Indian science and mathematics, and a gifted teacher and speaker. Attaching an interview that touches on his wide-ranging scholarship and vision. This is a terrible loss. Condolences to his family and students.
