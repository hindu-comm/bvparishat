TheOnline Etymology Dictionary by Douglas Harper is good. <https://www.etymonline.com/word/September> says

There are more details about the Julian calendar reform that happened in 46 BCE at[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Julian_calendar&oldid=994536814) and[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roman_calendar&oldid=995168876)

The renaming of Quintilis (5) andSextilis (6), toJulius (July) andAugustus (August) respectively, happened a few years later.

  

These articles say, however, that the Roman calendar had already moved the starting month to January even before the Julian reform in 46 BCE, though it seems disputed when and why this happened:

These references are:

• Livy: “In the five hundred and ninety-eighth year after the founding of the city, the consuls began to enter upon their office on 1January.”

• Plutarch: “He \[Numa\] also changed the order of the months. March, which had been first, he made the third month, and January, which had been the eleventh month under Romulus,he made the first month; February, which had been twelfth and last, thus became the second month, as now. But there are many who say that these months of January and February were added to the calendar by Numa,and that at the outset the Romans had only ten months in their year” (the last part referring to what is called "Legendary 10 month calendar" in the Wikipedia article, where the period between December and March simply went unnamed)

• [Ovid](https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/OvidFastiBkTwo.php#anchor_Toc69367683) I could not understand (but see below)

• Warde Fowler's [explanation](https://archive.org/details/romanfestivalsof00fowluoft/page/5/mode/2up) [from](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/59007/59007-h/59007-h.htm#Page_5) 1899 actually seems the most satisfying (bolding added by me), and also clears up what Ovid means (later on the page, not quoted here):
