Just to speculate:

Was the sky (or rather, the Celestial Sphere) referred to as *ambara*

in this context of astronomy, by any chance,

(or by some cognate/synonymous expression)?

  

For, if yes, the names of the four months get to be even more transparent

(given that the explanation resorting to *-bris* also seems to be just speculative).
