Yes, one theory is that the New Year did start with *Caitra*, usually in March.

Assignment of 28/29 days for a second month (reckoning January as the first)

looks arbitrary and baseless, if not outright stupid and silly.

  

Etymological dictionaries have not been able to explain the common endings of

Sept*ember*, Octo*ber*, Nov*ember*, and Dec*ember*. These four words betray their being the

7th, 8th, 9th and 10th months (Sanskrit *sapta-aṣṭa-nava-daśa*) originally, which is possible  

only if March is taken as the 1st month; else their two-month lag sounds anomalous.  

(And this can also easily explain February as the last month of the year,  

which thereby gets allocated the remaining 28 or 29 days as the case may be).

  

All this indicates that January - despite its justification as being "Janus-faced" etc. -  

could unlikely mark the commencement of a New Year.  

  

Let's then look forward to the real New Year!

(Kushagra-ji has analysed other unseemly aspects/implications of  

presuming this to be a New Year junction.)  

  

(BTW, was the last *o* of October nasal by any chance earlier? For,  

that would make it rhyme with the other three months more easily and naturally).

  

If there is a better explanation, it would be welcome.
