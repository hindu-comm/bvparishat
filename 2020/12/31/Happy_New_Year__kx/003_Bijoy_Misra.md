Dear friends,

For us abroad, India is a distant land. We are the lost tribes

that crossed the Himalayas. Then we look for our roots for

ourselves and for our children.

  

After sufficient analysis, I have settled down to map India's

intellectual contribution through ten thought leaders. This is

an effort to create an integrated thought picture that our

children may carry analytically through academic material.  

After creating the broader map, we plan to analyze each  

contribution in more detail for historical reference.  

I hope you would bless this effort in this distant land.  

  

Happy New year.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
