Namaste Damodara ji,

  

I hope my PhD work will help you in this regard. Title of my PhD thesis was - 'An Indian perspective regarding the science of weather forecast as described in Sanskrit texts'. You can read my thesis on shodhganga -<http://hdl.handle.net/10603/291678>

  

We definitely have rich literature in Sanskrit on weather prediction. I have tried to incorporate all the aspects of this science in my thesis. But, verification of the rules mentioned in the texts is challenging part.

  

Thank you. Regards.

  

Rudraksha Sakrikar
