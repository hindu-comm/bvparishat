There are many who claim to know Vedic Science for predicting or forecasting, climate, weather, rainfall and in fact all aspects of atmospheric sciences and even earthquakes! If any knowledge or statement that can be confidently and ethically propagated among lay public, the method and results have to be verified on a quantitative basis. The responsibility for this is on the author himself. Otherwise it will be similar to the Trump-cure for Covid by somehow injecting sanitisers or disinfectants.  

What our ancients have said on natural phenomena can of course be easily listed, read, translated (?) and published. But only after the texts are analysed for their doctrines, technicalities, (paribhaasha), logic and scientific models (not necessarily western) we get something out of them. I have spent a number of years analysing Indian rainfall data on different spatial and temporal scales and also have attempted quantitative and qualitative matching with information available from ancient Sanskrit texts. I will not elaborate here since my works are all published and available on the web. However, in answer to Sri Damodar Das the initiator of this thread, I urge him to read the book Kadambini by Pt.Madhusudan Ojha

More importantly the 45 page English Introduction by a famous meteorologist of yester years Dr.AS Ramanathan (Former DG of IMD) should be read by all interested in the topic. Almost all questions that can be raised about ancient methods on short range and long range forecasting of rainfall have been discussed. This seems to be a happy convergence of a traditional Sanskrit scholar with a rare analytical approach towards Vedas and classical texts, meeting a modern scientist who was also well versed in Sanskrit learning.

I can send a copy if someone is interested.
