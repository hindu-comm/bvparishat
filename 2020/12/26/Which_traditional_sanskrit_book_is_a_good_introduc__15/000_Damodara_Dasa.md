Hare Krishna.  
  
Respected Vidvaj-janas,  
  
Artha Samgraha is a very helpful book that introduces one to  
Purva-mimamsa, and makes it easier for a new student to enter the  
subject matter in its complexities later.  
  
I am looking for a similar book for entry to Nyaya-sutras. I would  
prefer work of traditional author like Laugaksi Bhaskara.  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
