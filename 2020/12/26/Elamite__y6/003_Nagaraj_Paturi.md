Elamite is regarded by the vast majority of[linguists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguists "Linguists")as a[language isolate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_isolate "Language isolate"),^([\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elamite_language#cite_note-Blench-13)[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elamite_language#cite_note-14)[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elamite_language#cite_note-15))as it has no demonstrable relationship to the neighbouring[Semitic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitic_languages "Semitic languages"),[Indo-European languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages "Indo-European languages"), or to[Sumerian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_language "Sumerian language"), despite having adopted the Sumerian-[Akkadian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_language "Akkadian language")[cuneiform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform "Cuneiform")script.

An[Elamo-Dravidian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elamo-Dravidian "Elamo-Dravidian")family connecting Elamite with the[Dravidian languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravidian_languages "Dravidian languages")of India was suggested in 1967 by[Igor M. Diakonoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_M._Diakonoff "Igor M. Diakonoff")^([\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elamite_language#cite_note-16))and later, in 1974, defended by David McAlpin.^([\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elamite_language#cite_note-17))In 2012, Southworth proposed that Elamite forms the “Zagrosian family” along with[Brahui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahui_language "Brahui language")and, further down the cladogram, the remaining Dravidian languages; this family would have originated in Southwest Asia (southern Iran) and was widely distributed in South Asia and parts of eastern West Asia before the Indo-Aryan migration.^([\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elamite_language#cite_note-Southworth_2012-18))

[Václav Blažek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%A1clav_Bla%C5%BEek "Václav Blažek")proposed a relation with the[Semitic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitic_languages "Semitic languages").^([\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elamite_language#cite_note-Blench96-19))

In 2002[George Starostin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Starostin "George Starostin")published a[lexicostatistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicostatistic "Lexicostatistic")analysis finding Elamite to be approximately equidistant from[Nostratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostratic "Nostratic")and Semitic.^([\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elamite_language#cite_note-20))

***None of these ideas have been accepted by mainstream historical linguists.^([\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elamite_language#cite_note-Blench-13))***
