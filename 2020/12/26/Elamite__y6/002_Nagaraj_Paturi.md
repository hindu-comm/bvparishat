The page shared here from [archyde.com](http://archyde.com) is giving inaccurate information.

  

What is deciphered by this French archeologist is Linear Elamite.

  

A sizeable number of Elamite lexemes is known from the trilingual[Behistun inscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behistun_inscription "Behistun inscription")and numerous other bilingual or trilingual inscriptions of the[Achaemenid Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire "Achaemenid Empire"), in which Elamite was written using[Elamite cuneiform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elamite_cuneiform "Elamite cuneiform")(circa 400 BCE), which is fully deciphered. An important dictionary of the Elamite language, the*Elamisches Wörterbuch*was published in 1987 by W. Hinz and H. Koch.^([\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elamite_language#cite_note-4)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elamite_language#cite_note-5))*The**[Linear Elamite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_Elamite "Linear Elamite")script however, one of the scripts used to write the Elamite language circa 2000 BCE, has remained elusive until recently.^([\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elamite_language#cite_note-LEW-6))*
