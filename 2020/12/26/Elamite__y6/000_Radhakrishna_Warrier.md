Just got this from a Facebook post:

  

<https://www.archyde.com/french-archaeologist-francois-desset-has-just-deciphered-4400-year-old-iranian-writing/?fbclid=IwAR0cRPFxNglBhoY-y5TQS3zMAIwYYejAd4m8tP1WDVrQNDwaW-k1K62Ofgw>

  

[TABLE]

The article says that the French archaeologist Fran√ßois Desset has deciphered Elamite writing. This is interesting because some people consider Elamite to be related to the so-called Dravidian family of languages.
