Dear Ashok Ji,

  

  The terms "good" or "bad" are not quite appropriate. One may perhaps use the terms "easy" or "difficult" to comprehend something, but even a difficult work may ultimately be worth the effort. To me, the Bhagavata Purana does not even fit in the category of "difficult", and its beauty is unquestioned. With best wishes,
