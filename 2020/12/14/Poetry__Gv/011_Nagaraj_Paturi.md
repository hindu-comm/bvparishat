In Alankaara Shaastra, naarikEla paaka, alongside xraakshaa paaka and kadalee paaka, is a well known concept. The verse is describing naarikEla paaka.

  

Identification of naarikEla paaka as one of the paakas itself shows that Sanskrit poetic tradition recognised the possibility of difficult but sweet poetry .

  

Sri Harsha's Naishadha kaabyam, not Srimadbhaagavata puraanam , is an example.
