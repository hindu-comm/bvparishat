Way back in mid 2000s, when I went with a list of my selection from their catalogue to their Delhi shop, I was told most of the books were not available because of lack of demand.

The only books that were reprinted tend in good demand were Ayurveda, Yoga and astrology.

  

Hope they carry in-print, more titles now.  
  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
