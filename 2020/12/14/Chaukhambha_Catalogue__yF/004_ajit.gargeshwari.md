I don't know about demand.. You are giving information about a talk you had with them in 2000 in the year year 2020. All chowkambha offices dispatch their books promptly when one places order with them. Books on all aspects of Indian culture with a special focus on Sanskrit books and hindi translations are continually been published by them. They have new releases even last month.
