Typo in the second line:

  
सङ्केत**स्थन**माप्ता --> सङ्केत**स्थान**माप्ता  

  

Dear Sri Amaranath,

I understand Sri Kalki-Simhacharya was very famous in Bangalore in the first half of the last century. Apart from the 1000 verses of Nammaaழ்var he has a book called Laghu-nityanusandhanam (ಲಘು ನಿತ್ಯಾನುಸಂಧಾನಂ) in two parts. The first part (published in 1934) contains TirupallAnD, TirupaLLieழுcci; Tiruppaavai with original text,
versified translation in Sanskrit, and meaning in Kannada. The complete book is in Kannada script only. The Printer of the book was BV Subbiah & Sons, Bangalore. I have no idea about the current availability of the book. I posted the verse from my personal copy.

Thanks

  

RNI
