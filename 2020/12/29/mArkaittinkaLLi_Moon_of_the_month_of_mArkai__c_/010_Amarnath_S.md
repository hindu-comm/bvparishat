Namaste, Dr. Srinivas ji, and to everyone,

  

  Thanks for providing the Second volume of this book. Have downloaded both, and will contact the printer for hard copies, if available.

  

  One more thing. The Tiruvaimozhiof Nammaazhvaar, as translated into Kannada by Sri Kalki Simha, along with a Sanskrit verse for each of the 1102 paashurams, is available online at the Mandayam Digital Library. I checked with Sri Sheshnarayan, President of the Mandayam Srivaishnava Sabha, and other officebearers of the Sabha, and they gave me permission to post the website link here. These are the website links for the 10 parts of the Tiruvaimozhi, for each paashuramof which Sri Kalki Simha has written an equivalent Sanskrit verse. At the end of each 10 paashurams, the corresponding verses from Dramidopanishat-sangati (by Sri Vaadakesari Azhaghiya-Manavaala-Jeeyar) and Dramidopanishat-Taatparya-Ratnaavali(by Swami Vedanta Deshikar) are also provided. These are in the Kannada script. Anybody can download and read, for non-commercial purposes.

  

These parts are available at

Part 1 - <http://mdl.mandayamsabha.in/book-details/291>  
Part 2 - <http://mdl.mandayamsabha.in/book-details/290>  
Part 3 - <http://mdl.mandayamsabha.in/book-details/289>  
Part 4 - <http://mdl.mandayamsabha.in/book-details/46>  
Part 5 - <http://mdl.mandayamsabha.in/book-details/67>  
Part 6 - <http://mdl.mandayamsabha.in/book-details/288>  
Part 7 - <http://mdl.mandayamsabha.in/book-details/287>  
Part 8 - <http://mdl.mandayamsabha.in/book-details/286>  
Part 9 - <http://mdl.mandayamsabha.in/book-details/285>  
Part 10 - <http://mdl.mandayamsabha.in/book-details/283>  

  

Also the main website of the Mandayam Digital Library is<http://mdl.mandayamsabha.in/>, where you find about 300 books, some of which are in Sanskrit. I could not find the Laghunityanusandhaanam of Sri Kalki Simha on this site, therefore I requested here. Thanks.  

  

Thanks and Regards
