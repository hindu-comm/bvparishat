If it's of interest, the Tamil essayist, the late Rao Sahib Sri M Raghava Iyengar, has written on the astronomical event refered to in this verse i.e., heliacal rising of Venus followed by setting of Jupiter. Based on inscriptions, king lists, astronomical data (he uses the Indian Ephemeris) and literary data, he concludes 731 AD to be the date of this event. He also concludes Sri Andal's birth year to be 716 AD. (Raghava Iyengar. M, *Āḻvārkaḷ kālanilai*, pp. 64-91(Madras, Law Journal Press, 1929).  

  

Sri Iyengar takes into account the phenomenon of 'tai nīrāṭal' of the earlier Tamil literature including the Sangam works and also cites the practice of 'tiruvatira' even now being observed in Kerala. On these matters he is consistent with the views expressed in his essays by his maternal uncle, Sri R Raghava Iyengar.  

  

'Āḻvārkaḷ kālanilai' is perhaps the most comprehensive study in the matter of periodization of the Alvars including Sri Andal. The books and articles written in English on the subject derive substantially from this study of Sri Iyengar's but they also deviate from it considerably, mostly due to their need to quote and be consistent with several authorities who have written only in English. The writers in English are generally not comfortable with all 4 types of sources that Sri iyengar has dealt with. They also sometimes do not take into account the previous findings of Tamil pandits. 'The Pandit and the Professor' phenomenon is very much in operation in this field of study, as in most of Tamil studies.  

  

Hope this helps,
