Sunder's post is interesting. I am enthused to add the following:

AndaaL a.k.a Godadevi is said to have lived in the 7-8th Cent CE.
Tiruppavai as per the first verse started on a Full Moon and ended on the last day of the month.

In those bygone days, the winter solstice was observed as per the yaugika meaning namely Sun turning North, very close to the longest night of the year. In any case the 27th verse

is about Pongal. \[Even now the end of Tiruppavai recitation in temples and homes of SV's ends in the Civil Calendar on January 14th, the so called Nirayana W.S./ Makara sankranti\].

Keeping this in mind if as Sunder connects with the early morning skies of Sri Villiputtur (near Madurai) in the 7-8th cent.CE, we can find the approximate position of Sun, Venus and Jupiter. On the 13th day of the poem, Sun was still not at 270 degrees; Venus was visible around 5 AM (the whole poem is about early morning before sunrise!) in the east and Jupiter was setting in the west. A Sanskrit translation of the verse by Kalki Narasimhachaarya (c 1934) of yester years follows:

  

संकीर्त्येमाश्च कन्या बकमुखदलनं राक्षसेन्द्रान्तकंतम्

सङ्केतस्थनमाप्तास्सपदि समुदितश्शुक्र एषोऽपि कल्ये \|

जीवोप्यस्तश्शकुन्ताः कलकलितरवाः पद्मभृङ्गाभनेत्रे

स्नातुं नायासि निद्रासि किमधुनाप्येहि शीघ्रं व्रतार्थम्\|\| 13\|\|
