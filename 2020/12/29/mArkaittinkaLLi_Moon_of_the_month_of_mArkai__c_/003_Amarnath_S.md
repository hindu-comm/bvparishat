Namaste Dr R N Iyengar,

  

 Have seen the Sanskrit translation, rather versification, of Swami Nammazhvaar's Tiruvaimoli by Sri Kalki Narasimhacharya, but have not seen the Sanskrit rendering of Tiruppavai by him. Is this book (Tiruppavai rendered to Sanskrit) by Sri Kalki Narasimhacharya available somewhere? Also, what other Tamizh books have been rendered into Sanskrit by him, is there a list anywhere?

  

Thanks and Regards

\- amar
