I have been trying to see the Jupiter – Saturn conjunction for the last few days. Unfortunately, most days were overcast and rainy. Today was clear. Stepped out, but instead of the conjunction, what I saw in the cool twilight was a near-full moon. Mārkaẓittiṅkaḷ (Moon of Mārkaẓi) is indeed beautiful. Mārkaẓi (Mārgaśīrṣa) is supposed to be the most pleasant among Tamil months.

In honor of the Mārkaẓi Tiṅkaḷ, here is a sweetly rendered song from Tiruppāvai of āṇṭāḷ. 

മാർകഴിത്തിങ്കൾ മതി നിറൈന്ത നന്നാളാൽ ... (மார்கழித்திங்கள் மதிநிறைந்த நன்னாளால் … Mārkaẓittiṅkaḷ mati niṟainta naṉṉāḷāl …)

Mārkaẓittiṅkaḷ is pronounced in Tamil and Malayalam asMārgaẓittiṅgaḷ.  

Regards,
