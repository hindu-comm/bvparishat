Namaste, Dr. Srinivas,

  

  Thank you very much for attaching a copy of the Laghu Nityaanusandhaana book, Volume 1 by Late Sri Kalki Simha. Couple ofquestions:

  

1\. Are these two volumes available for purchase, as hard copies in Bengaluru? I can go and get them.

2\. Is the soft copy of Volume 2, containing the remaining parts of Laghu Nityaanusandhaana (Neeraattam, Shenniyongu, and others) available?

  

Thanks and Regards

\- amar
