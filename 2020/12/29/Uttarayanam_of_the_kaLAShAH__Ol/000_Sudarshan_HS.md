I wanted to share this article at NYT "Welcoming a New Year at an Ancient Festival in Pakistan" - <https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/27/world/asia/pakistan-kalash-chawmos.html>  

  

The [कळाष](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalash_people) people of Chitral region of today's NW Pakistan celebrated their New Year's day around the true उत्तरायणपुण्यकालः (winter solstice). And, it is interesting that they call their two-week long new year festival - [चौमोस्](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chawmos) supposedly a corruption of the word चातुर्मास्यम् !
