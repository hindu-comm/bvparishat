Shri Sudarshan ji,

Jai Shri Ram!

Thanks for the interesting piece of information

Uttarayan was actually the start of not only a solar new year but a five year yuga in India as per the Vedanga Jyotisham.  

Even Pandavas and Kauravas are supposed to have followed the same tradition as per the Mahabharata.

With the advent of siddhantic astronomy, most of the Hindus switched over to Vishuva-cum-Vaishakhi (Vernal Equinox) as the start of the new solar year, which became known as Meshadi or Mesha Sankranti.

Somehow, a section of the Hindus who are now in Pakistan, appear to have continued the tradition of the Vedanaga Jyotisham.

That is really encouraging since the rest of the Hindus are observing neither Uttarayana nor Vishuva (Vernal Equinox) but an "almighty" Lahiri Mesha Sankranti as the start of solar new year, which is neither as per any Vedanga nor any Purana nor any siddhanta not even as per modern astronomy!

Can there be anything more ironic than the same!

Thanks again for keeping before us a glimpse of our ancient Vedic traditions!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
