I am searching forSanatkumarasamhita of Sahyadri khanda Skanda Purana which is said to include Subramanya mahatmya mentioned in my other post to this group. Some people believe this work is is written around 1700 because it mentions chitpavan Brahmanas and Pathiari people. Only edition seems to be that of Gerson Cunha 1887, 1865. Please let me know if any new reading material available in this regard.
