Nice and very interesting lecture. Thank yousir!

  

Here are some questions and observations.

  

You describe some words from Indo-European bypassing the Vedic language and appearing in later Prakrits. Have any such words managed to reach modern Indo-Aryan like Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, Punjabi, Bengali etc.?

  

Regarding 'r' of ancient western dialects becoming 'l' in eastern dialects, is this trend still there in modern Indo Aryan? In Malayalam, the Sanskrit tatsama-sr≈çma and l≈çma mean the same thing, hair. Perhaps these two words came to south Indian languages from the western and eastern dialects respectively, or perhaps long after, when these two forms were accepted as standard Sanskrit. However, the form r≈çma is much more in common use and it has become part of everyday, informal spoken language. L≈çma is found only in formal literary language or in such compound words as anul≈çma and pratil≈çma.

  

The change from the very ancient layers of the Vedic language to Prakrits of say the Bauddhas and the Jainas, appear to be mainly phonetic with some phonemes going out of use, and simplification of the pronunciation of words. (However, to me personally, such changes as from a·π£·π≠a to a·π≠·π≠ha, or hasta to hattha seem to be a change from simple to more difficultüôÇ.)The changes in grammar and structure don't appear to be that great. However, the change from Prakrit to modern Indo Aryan appears to be much more significant than the one from Vedic to Prakrit, with the structure and grammar undergoing lot of change besides the phonetics.

  

Regarding the description of the VrƒÅtya going east and many things including poetry travelling with him, I have read that the wordVrƒÅtyais used in a slightly derogatory sense in the Vedas. Is that true?

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna
