Dear scholars/language experts, please let me know if there is any algorithm/process/flowchart available to convert any given Sanskrit word to equivalent Prakrit word (and vice versa too), applying the rules of grammar of Hemachandra step by step?

  

I am not interested in direct translators which just output the equivalent word for the input word.  

  

Regards

P V S Kumar
