***Noopura Bhramari (R.), an Institution par excellence with the intention of promoting research in the field of Performing Arts and deep study of all aspects of different Art-forms invites applications for its new course***

**Nritāyanukeertana**

***Certificate Course on Aesthetics of Choreography***

***(with special reference to Natyashastra)***

****

This course will give an understanding of using the Angika elements of the Natya Sastra (Anga bhedas, Charis, Nritta-Hastas and selected Karanas), applying which, a few Bharatanatyam items will be taught. Items chosen are rare and special compositions. The technique of ‘movement transforming into an emotion’, is the focus in choreography of the items and the teaching of the same.

Nritya is the ‘samagama’ of Nritta (rhythmical movement of the limbs) and Natya( dramatization) elements. Hence dance is essentially emoting through aesthetic movement. This understanding is the objective of teaching in the compositions.

Please see the brouchure for more details and Interested can visit the website for application forms.
