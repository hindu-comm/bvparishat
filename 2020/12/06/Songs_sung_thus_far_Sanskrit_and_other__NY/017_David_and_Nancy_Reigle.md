Dear Prof. Kannan,

  

In reference to what you wrote here:

  

"Much of what we have been doing is already available over the internet, but much of it, unfortunately, abounds in errors - of text, of pronunciation."

  

This is exactly what was on my mind when I replied, and in fact what prompted me to reply. Yes, I have listened to a number of these songs on the internet, some of which may be reasonably accurate, and some not so. This is indeed the problem. The average listener cannot tell which is reliable and which is not. Thus, not knowing, the listener cannot trust any of them. With the ones posted by you and Dr. Meera the situation is entirely different. We can fully trust all of them. To me, that is huge, and that is why I so much appreciate these songs that you and Dr. Meera have done.

  

Again, thank you!,
