Dear David Reigle,

Many thanks for your kind words that enkindle enthusiasm;

and I take the word in its etymological sense (Greek : *en + theos*).

  

Much of what we have been doing is already available over the internet,

but much of it, unfortunately, abounds in errors - of text, of pronunciation.

And the paradox also is: the more the errors, the more the admirers.

  

What really sustains our efforts is, rather than the number,

the considered and enthusing words of the intellectual elite,

even if few and far between.

  

Thanks once again.

KSKannan
