The quoted passage needs to be placed in the holistic integrated backdrop of total text being studied and ' previous backing works and post connections provided by author'. The deeper connection to the ' Bhaavanopanishat' can not be sidelined in such studies.



1. The technicality of ' Meaning construction of given Samskruth text' in Tantra is multidimensional; especially as noted in the work of Bhaskararaya Makhin. The layers ( kosha/ aavarana) and POV (Darshana Sthana) = Point,Posiiton and Perspetives of analysis are indicated in the quoted text, as suits the context.



2. This tradition of 'Samskruth Semantics ( Pada-Artha - Nirukti/ Nirvachana) has its origin noted in Vedanga Yaska- sampradaya, using the technical term -f ' Artha- Nirukti'. Vedanga -Vyakarana and several other shaastra disciplines use the technical name ' paribhashaa' ( Technical terms definition in the specific domain of study and school).



3. This ' traditional model of Samskruth-Semantics' does not fit in to smug comfort of ' **Lexicon**' adapted for ' classical language text -scripture study for generating output as translation ( mechanized/ Or better words , like : automated, Dehumanized, Machine generated-
facilitated , Computed statistically) for ' generating **a word-meaning'**.

The'Samskruth- word' (pada) in Nirukta tradition is so analyzed to yield the 'vision (Darshana/ Artha) which parents it. This is Kalidasa's 'Vagartha-sampruktataa/ yuktataa'. This is a human-divine cognitive science related ' Yoga way of learning-using Samskrutham'. i.e. Vak-yoga-sampradaya. Bhaskara raya makhin has explaied this in Varivasya Rahasya for spiritual meditation guidance, which needs to be learnt from a ' practicing Master'.



**Srividya Tantra ( Abhinava gupta incuded) have provided the 'VINIYOGA' tradition of ' Vak (Yoga) ' as 'Mantra (Yoga)' using ' Shiva-sutra' ( Of Panini and Vasubnadhu), to form two different practicing traditions - One at Sringeri and One at Kashmir; One as Srividya tantra and another as dasha-mahavidyaa tantras. All these are of Vedic origin and connected to 'aagama and Puranas'. **
