"Dr. Kapil Kapoor speaks about why this book Sanskrit Non-Translatables is to be so celebrated. According to him, so far, the Hindu civilization has been subdued by suppressing and subverting its culture which is founded in vast knowledge heritage. All knowledge is constituted in language and words and this book allows Indian words to retain their swaroopa."
