Thank you Megh ji,

for bringing this video to theattention of the list.

  

I hope scholars would critically examine the evidence of transition to murti puja as available in the Natyashastra.

  

There seems to be no other concrete evidence available in any other ritualistic sphere.

  

I look forwardto hearing from the list.
