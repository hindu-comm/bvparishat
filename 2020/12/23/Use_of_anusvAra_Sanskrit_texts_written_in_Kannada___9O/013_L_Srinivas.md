\> In Hindi, the word for serpent is written as साँप , never as साम्प or सांप.

  

You will be surprised at the number of hits you get when you google सांप! Also, hardly anybody writes यहाँ वहाँ etc anymore, only यहां वहां . Even a few orthodox Sanskrit teachers of my acquaintance living or trained in northern India, advocate anusvara instead of the anunasika when a stop follows a upasarga. Thus संपर्क instead of सम्पर्क and संजय instead of सञ्जय on the grounds that upasarga has pada status and thus वा पदान्तस्य may be pressed into service.  

  

Reverting to Hindi, India Today etc have abolished the chandrabindu. It's all anusvara. Aside from this, the Hindi world is also generally abolishing the ङ and the ञ. Today in a cellphone it's very hard to type शङ््कर , you can only type शंकर. In other words you can type Hindi but not Sanskrit, at least not what's being talked about in this thread i.e., anusvara will replace the anunasika (the nasal vowel and the nasal stop) every time.  

  

I would request grammarians on this list to address this issue for the Sanskrit context (the original post raised in the thread) in the spirit of प्रतिज्ञानुनासिक्याः पाणिनीयाः . I understand in the eyes of the Pratisakhyas, the parasavarna is obligatory whereas Panini seems to offer an option.  

  

Thanks in advance,
