Dear all

  

On this issue this is the opinion of Vaman Shivaram Apte in the Preface to his 1st edition of Students English-Sanskrit dictionary :-

  

"Throughout the work the usual practice of representing every anusvara in the body of the word by its corresponding nasals has been rejected and the anusvara sign is invariably used, where usually a nasal would stand. I have not been able to understand the principle on which scholars reject this system and betake themselves solely to the other; though the anusvara system is most convenient in printing, and occasionally saves much misunderstanding. Besides, it is a practice generally followed in our old Manuscripts, and is sanctioned by Panini as being optional ..."

  

thanks
