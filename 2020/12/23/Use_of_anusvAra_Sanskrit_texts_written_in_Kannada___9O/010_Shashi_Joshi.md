Nagaraj ji,

When you say - "Historians of south Indian scripts in general and Telugu script in particular consider anusvaara to be a borrowing from the north Indian versions of Braamhee."

  

Do you mean to say that in traditional Telugu script the bindu on top wasn't used at all, even for anusvAra, or not used just for the anunAsika? How was anusvAra represented then? Like in saMshaya, saMsAra, saMskRita ?

  

  

  
  

Thanks,  

\~ Shashi
