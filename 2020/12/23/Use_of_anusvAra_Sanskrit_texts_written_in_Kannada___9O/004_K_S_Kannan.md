Adhering to the *varga-pañcama* may be welcome in Sanskrit circles,

but is much resented/even ridiculed in the context of modern Kannada writing

\- primarily because Kannadigas, through decades now, seldom see such formations,  

hence not habituated to; also it proves "more difficult to write" for these folks;  

space too, as pointed out above, may be a consideration. The argument of Apte

and the evidence of Sanskrit mss. (in other scripts too) go to dilute

the strictness insisted upon.  

  

I was embarrassed by some for writing ***pāścāttya**  
*

(correct Sanskrit formation with double *t*)*  
*

\- in lieu of the current ***pāścātya***  

(or the more horrible but even more popular ***pāścimātya***).
