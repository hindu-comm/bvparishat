Historians of south Indian scripts in general and Telugu script in particular consider anusvaara to be a borrowing from the north Indian versions of Braamhee.

  

Older Telugu inscriptions did not have anusvaara. As such, as a rule, vargaanunaasikas were used in front of the respective vargavyanjanas.

  

We see a confusion on the part of the stone inscribing scribes as to which system , the older vargaanunaasika system or the newer anusvaara system to use, during the transition period.

  

As a result, there are instances of the scribes using both the systems together for inscribing the same sound.

  

Telugu , in addition to anusvaara has ardhaanusvaara standing for an older, now extinct, nasality as a coarticulation . This nasality represented a historically extinct anusvaara / vargaanunaasika or morphophenemically 'dissolved' (druta) 'n', dissolved as part of sandhi.

  

This added to the confusion of the scribes and as a result , we see many work arounds employed by the inscribers to signify anusvaara and ardhaanusvaara distinctly.

  

So the point is: anusvaara script symbol is considered by historians of Telugu script, as a recent development occurringthrough Sanskritization of Telugu script and inscribing /writing vargaanunaasikas as the original native Telugu practice.

  

In any case, the adoption of anusvaara seems to have happened as a method of convenience and script- simplification that does not affect the pronunciation as it is the vargaanunaasikas that are pronounced in the places where such anusvaara is used as a result of a natural partialphonetic assimilation that is compelled by an articulatory convenience.
