I take this opportunity to ask a question, so that I may learn more about this.

  

In the Bengali script (and in common Bengali pronunciation), there is a change that happens which has confused me at times:  
  

\(1\) Saṃgha, even though written as saṃgha (সংঘ) or saṅgha (সঙ্ঘ), is always pronounced as saṅgha.

  

\(2\) In Bengali, it is always written 'mīmāṃsā' (মীমাংসা), but it is always pronounced as 'mīmāṅgsā'.

  

\(3\) In Bengali script, it is written 'kāryya' and 'bhaṭṭācāryya' (double Y), which in Bengali pronunciation becomes J (and double J).

  

Please could you shed some light on this, on the correctness or incorrectness of it? I would like to learn more about this.
