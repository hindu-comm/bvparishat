I found an interesting paper related to this issue (anusvara and anunasika) comparing the pratishakyas and Panini by George Cardona published in the Tokyo University Linguistic Papers (vol. 33, 2013, pp. 3-81). The abstract is given below, and the PDF is attached.

  

" The development of nasals in early Indo-Aryan has been the object of dispute. A major point of contention has been whether the distinction which Pāṇini and authors of prātiśākhyas and śikṣās make between the entities referred to by anunāsika and anusvāra has to do with a difference in the language or is a difference regarding merely how various scholars viewed the same matter. Whitney maintained the second view. He was criticized by later scholars but his position has not been refuted definitively. In this paper, I establish that the distinction in question definitely reflects a difference in language, between nasalized vowels and nasal stops, referred to by anunāsika, and a postvocalic nasal segment, referred to by anusvāra, which had different dialectal realizations. I consider also related questions concerning differences in timing, transitions and consonant doubling."
