> ***Abstract***: Who was the first to use the term ‘*lekhya*’ for a > legal document? In which text is that usage attested and how far back > in time does that go? Sentences that appear to be fairly precise > answers to the above questions are found dispersed in the scholarship > of Patrick Olivelle\[1\], who has been hailed by Dominik Wujastyk\[2\] > as “...the world's leading authority on the history of Indian > dharma”\[3\]. In this paper, the above-mentioned sentences are > foregrounded, analysed and responded to. This analysis seeks to > present evidence of serious fallacies manifest in some of the > statements alluded to above, and conclusions thereof, which have been > presented as being significant not just for Indian jurisprudence but > also for India’s cultural history itself. Finally, specific, > case-based, evidence of demonstrably contentious statements featuring > in a Murty Classical Library of India volume are provided in response > to inputs invited, in public, by the individual who has reportedly set > up Murty Classical Library with a $5.2 million endowment\[4\]. >
