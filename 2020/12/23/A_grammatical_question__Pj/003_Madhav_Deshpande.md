Dear Narayan Prasad Ji and Neelesh Ji,

  

  Thank you for providing these references. I am not convinced by either explanation. If Pāṇini meant to have the root śru in the bhvādi gaṇa to allow the derivation of śravati in the Veda, and śr̥ṇoti in bhāṣā, we would get such clear indications like the conditions chandasi/bhāṣāyam. By the way, śr̥ṇoti already occurs in the R̥gveda.
The rule "śruvaḥ śr̥ ca" prescribing replacement of śap \> śnuis a clear indication that the root was included in the bhvādi gaṇa. Nāgaśa's explanation appears to me to be something like "sthitasya gatiś cintanīyā." The real explanation still eludes me. We are missing something.
