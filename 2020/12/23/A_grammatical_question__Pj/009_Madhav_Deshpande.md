Dear BVK Sastry Ji,

  

  I am glad to see this continuing discussion. Your question is important: "The bearing question coming out of this is : why limit ' shap' only to listed ' bhavaadi' , when it is generic under 'karatari' -prayoga for 'ALL DHATUS' ? The distinction between a pratyaya of prayoga and pratyaya to mark ' Gana'? Why 'shru' constrained to 'bhavaadi and 'shap' inside of 'gana-patha'?" You are no doubt aware that Pāṇini's rule "kartari śap" is an utsarga "general rule" to which rules like "adādibhyaḥ śluḥ" etc. are all exceptions. The utsarga rule applies only where the exceptions do not apply. This procedure in Pāṇini leaves the application of śap only for bhū-adi and cur-ādi roots. Does the Pāṇinian Dhātupāṭha have some sort of Gaṇas. Indeed, his own expressions like "adādibhyaḥ" etc. suggest that he has in front of him lists of roots that begin with bhū, ad, etc. Apart from other issues, the rule "śruvaḥ śr̥ ca" itself says two things, a) replace śru \> śr̥, and b) replace śap>śnu. Without this rule, we will indeed have forms like śravati \[which are found in some Vedic texts\]. I spoke to Professor Cardona about this yesterday, and some clarity emerged. Given that we have forms like śrūyate and śr̥ṇoti, we do have two alternating morphs, i.e. śru and śr̥. One way or another, Pāṇini needs to account for both, and hence something like replacement of śru with śr̥ or the other way around is necessary. The Vedic forms like śravat/śravati can then be derived by following a maxim like: sarve vidhayaḥ chandasi vikalpyante. So far, this seems to be my understanding of the situation. With best regards,
