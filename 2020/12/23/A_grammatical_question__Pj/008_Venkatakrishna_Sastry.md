Namaste



On \< अत: पाणिने: कोऽभिप्राय: स्यादिति प्रश्न: समुदेति । > Hereis my understanding. Panini is complex but not confused or chaos ! The logic I have followed is from the excerpts placed below.

( I have not used HArvard Kyoto or other convention for romanizing Sanskrit. I hope that the context helps to get the intended meaning and clarity.)



**Still the question is** : Why 'shru' is not to be put under ' kryaadi' ? May be we need to distinguish ' karatari 'prayoge 'shap' ( by 3-1-68)- and ' Pratyaya by gana- listing'. A question of no worldly monetary value beyond intellectual satisfaction !



The reason for this hair-splitting between ' meaning of given dhatu for classification' and ' dhatu as listed with meaning under given gana'
comes from the observation in Balamanorama ( and Nyaya) placed below- highlighted.

The question would be : Did Panini have a different reading compared to current/later dhatu-patha ': The search for 'Dhatu -Patha in
Panini'- time line and text' ? When did the shift from Panini-list to ' listed Gana-patha' take place ? Why balamanorama marks ' ***artha-nirdeshasya -aadhunikatvaat'*** ? It is clearly understood that ' Panini did inherit and adapt 'Dhatu samjnaa' and 'Dhatu - patha listing along with a criterion to put a given term under Dhatu listing' from outside resources. Nirukta tradition also confirms this.



The bearing question coming out of this is : why limit ' shap' only to listed ' bhavaadi' , when it is generic under 'karatari' -prayoga for
'ALL DHATUS' ? The distinction between a pratyaya of prayoga and pratyaya to mark ' Gana'? Why 'shru' constrained to 'bhavaadi and 'shap' inside of 'gana-patha'?



Are we missing some thing in finding out the answer? treasure -hunt- hinting -texts ? ( And easiest escape route to answer is ' **Blame it on the boogie'** ( rock song) ? where ' Boogie' is ' loss of manuscripts'. How is 'loss of manuscript/ OCR issues/ scripting conventions impacting understanding of existing rule with available clear explanations in intelligble devanagari text ?



***Connected points to ponder on ' How we are engaging with Paninian rules in applications of Samskrutham in tradition, conversation, teaching, research, computational linguistic studies) :*** 



(a) Errors of DIGITAL TEXT ( very subtle, yet dangerous. The example of 'svara on indra-shatro vardhasva' operates more powerfuly and dangerously damaging in UNPROOFED DIGITAL TEXTS . One needs to ead through extremely carefully to understand the nature of error, even in the small extracts given below. Again, feel free to blame it on Browser, Font, OS…… **If there is no right technology, blame it on Boogie !** ****



b) Do we have any teaching - language -learnng- usage system that teaches us these nuances of Panini ? criss crossing between ' Chandas- bhashaa/ hybrid Sanskrit propositions' ? Conversational models ? Computational Linguisitc analysis ? **If there is no audience, blame it on Boogie !** ****



(c) Has any Sanskrit university any where made effort/ shown interest
to identify -assess the damages caused by the faulty digital texts in relation to the print and teaching traditions ? **If there is no fund,
blame it on Boogie !** ****



**1. Pushpa Dixit: Panini 'visioned' the totality of usages in making the rule.**

**2. Dhatu 'shru' gets a special treatment under svaadi (3-1- 73) .**

**3. Dhatu 'shru' related process is covered under 'anga'(6-4-1) and 'asiddhavat'(6-4-22) for ' lit' related ' idaagama' mentioned in 6-4-102 which is for 'Chandasi' by speciifc mentioning in sutra .

**4 . The kashikaa explanation at 7-2-13 -shows the lit related processing complexity of 'shru'. in relation to 'kryaadi', which alone get ' idaagama' for ' lit'.The rule of bharadwaja (7-2-63)for idaagama is optional . **

Look forward for helpful guidance.
