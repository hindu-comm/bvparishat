Dear BVK Sastry Ji,

  

  Thanks for providing more food for thought. The roots listed in the various rules you have cited do not all belong to the same conjugation, but in specific forms, they share the same behaviour. The other thing is that as your citations show, when Pāṇini intends certain forms to be restricted to chandasi or bhāṣāyām, he explicitly says so.
However, he does not do that for the rule 3.1.74 \[śruvaḥ śr̥ ca\]. The substitution of śap \> śnu prescribed in this rule is a clear indication that the root śru is listed in a conjugation that initially takes the vikaraṇa śap. This brings us to the bhū-ādi conjugation. There probably is a historically valid good explanation, but at present we are only searching for it. With best regards,
