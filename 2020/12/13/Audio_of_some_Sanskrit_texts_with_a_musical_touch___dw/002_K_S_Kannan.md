Thank you, Joshiji, for your kind suggestion.

  

The text we have given is Mārtaṇḍa,  

while the pronunciation is Mārtāṇḍa !

  

The pronunciation has come by sheer old practice - since childhood days!  

If nothing else, the two must, of course, conform.

  

Both forms are, however, seen : Mārtaṇḍa and Mārtāṇḍa.

We will rectify shortly. Thanks again, for pointing out.

We had somehow missed this discordance!

  

Regards

KSKannan
