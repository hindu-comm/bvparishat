Prof. Ramesh Rao avare,

  

I am aware of the ideological orientation of Dr Robert Zydenbos. I had some debating/disputing conversations with him on the Indology list on account of my ideological differences with him.

  

But the present context is mention of his name in the thread and the proof of his respect for his teacher. I shared it so that the list members know that he did make such a respectful expression in the present context.

  

That need not stop us from continuing to counter his views when we find them to be deserving a counter.

  

Regards,

  

Nagaraj
