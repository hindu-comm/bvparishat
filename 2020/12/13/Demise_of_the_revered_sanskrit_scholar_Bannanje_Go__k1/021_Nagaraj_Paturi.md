Dr Robert Zydenbos said these following good words about Pujya Sri Dr Bennanje avaru:

  

I knew Vidyāvācaspati Padmaśrī Dr.h.c. Bannanje Govindacharya for the past 30 years as a great friend, a wonderful mentor, a profound scholar with an amazing memory, a brilliant author in Kannada and Sanskrit, and a fine human with a delightful sense of humour. Among his great works is his edition of the collected writings of Madhvācārya in the original redaction (themūlapāṭha,not the corruptedpracalitapāṭhathat became the basis of most of the later commentaries). He was what we may call a critical traditionalist: he loved the Mādhva Vaiṣṇava tradition into whch he was born, but was highly critical of aberrations which crept in centuries after Madhva's time.  
  
His demise is a shattering loss. It was only befitting that his cremation took place with state honours. If Vaikuṇṭha exists, then he's there now.
