Namaste,

  

  Sometime in 2017 or 2018, Vidyavachaspati Bannanje Govindacharya gave a lecture series (of about 15 lectures in Kannada) on Bhartruhari's Shatakatraya at the Gokhale Institute of Public Affairs, Bangalore. Of which I could attend only one or two lectures; unfortunately I missed most of the lectures. If anyone has access to these recordings, or can point me to a place where the CD / pen-drive can be purchased, I will be grateful.

  

Thanks and Regards

\- amar
