Most scholars, at least (or especially) the best of them, would just be indifferent to,

or even fight shy of, advertising their own scholarship; but youngsters  

who may look forward to taking cues from, or get inspired by, their quality productions  

often have difficulties even getting to know, much less access, their valuable works.  

This is even more so in the case of polymaths, whose contributions in  

particular fields get to be known only by those pursuing the particular fields.

  

The suggestion of Prof. TSR is very welcome and is worth a serious trial.
