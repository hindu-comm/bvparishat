Dear Sri Raghavendra Bheemasena Rao-ji,

  

Such expressions are based on the respect-expressing person's belief system, not on the belief system of the respected person or the larger community to which the respected person belongs.

  

Without the conditional, the sentence would have implied that Dr Robert Zydenbos believes in the existence of Vaikuntha. But he wants to communicate that he is not sure or he is agnostic about it.

  

He wants to communicate that he believes that Dr Bennanje is as great a personality as to deservea place in the highest abode as per his (Dr Bennanje's) belief system.

  

Regards,

  

Nagaraj
