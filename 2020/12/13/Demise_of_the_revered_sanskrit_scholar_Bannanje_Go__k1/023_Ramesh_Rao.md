We need to beware Zydenbos, who brings his own ideological leanings into caricaturing, demonizing, and/or mocking others. He has not only had fights with Koenraad Elst and others, but this is how he characterizes S. L. Bhyrappa's work in the intro to his book "The Calf became an Orphan" (where he bestows a lot of love and regard for U. R. Ananthamurthy who urged his own students and followers to rain stones on Bhyrappa's home!):

  

"On the other end of the social spectrum, the agitprop of S. L. Bhyrappa, who quite explicitly propagated a fascist ideology in support of Hindu fundamentalism, is technically quite cleverly and at times beautifully written; however, it is the expression of a closed mind that does not invite its readers to think but tries to convert them to religious, ethnic and racial enmity. Either one is hypnotized by the anti-humanistic, religiously fundamentalist, and racist propaganda and joins the crowd, or one is appalled and turns away."

  

Beware the curate's egg, rotten in parts...

  

Ramesh
