LECTURE 6: Sanskrit in the South: Vernacular in Sanskrit, Sanskrit in Vernacular, and the Strange and Beautiful Case of Maṇipravāḷam
-**Prof David Shulman**

Professor, Department of Asian Studies, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, is an Israeli Indologist, poet and peace activist, known for his work on the history of religion in South India

Abstract: I will want to speak about some southern Sanskrit works such as Śākalyamalla's, where the colloquial Telugu substratum is very clear; and about the Telugu Naiṣadhamu and the Tamil Naiṭatam in relation to the Skt Naiṣadhīya, and what happens when Sanskrit turns into Telugu or another language; and about the Maṇipravāḷam-Malayalam case, which is particularly interesting and unusual. And more generally, I'll talk about the symbiosis of Sanskrit and regional languages in the south, including Tamil (where this relation is almost always distorted in the modern discourse on languages)-- also about why a particular author might choose to write in Sanskrit or in the vernacular, including cases where a single author composed in both languages. Also, the remarkable cases where a major work, such as the Telugu Vasucaritramu, was translated almost immediately into both Tamil and Sanskrit. Why did poets do this?

LECTURE 8: Indian Inscriptions: Prakrit, Sanskrit, and Everything Between: The Grand Paradox of Indian Epigraphy -**Prof Richard Salomon**

William P. and Ruth Gerberding University Professor Emeritus, Department of Asian Languages & Literature, University of Washington, Seattle

Abstract: Indian inscriptions from the time of Ashoka onward show curious patterns of language development which seem to contradict what we know of the history of Sanskrit and Prakrit from literary sources. Analysis of the language of the inscriptions, including the "mixed dialects," reveal that the relationship of Sanskrit and Prakrit in actual practice was far more complex than it appears from what is preserved in formal literature.
