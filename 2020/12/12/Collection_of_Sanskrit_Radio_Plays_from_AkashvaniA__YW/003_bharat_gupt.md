Delightful indeed for Sanskrit lovers and writers!!!

  

But in reality it perpetuates the historical untruth and the modern myth

fabricated by European classicists and Indian Sanskritists that there was something

called 'sanskrit drama' in ancient India. As you all know that ancient Indian theatre, so well

documented in the Natyashastra and the surviving play-scripts, was a multilingual

theatre (the one and only in history of civilizations). It had perhaps twenty percent

sanskrit in the paathya or dialogue spoken, rest being various prakrits.

In actual performance on the stage, it had perhaps five percent sanskrit as all music and

dhruva songs and dances in puurva-rangawere in prakrits. So when and where was ever

in history something called 'sanskrit theatre'?

  

Whenever I raise this question it is taken as an attack on Sanskrit and its glory. It is

completely forgotten that by this false glorification we are perpetuating the myth/falsehood

of domination of Sanskrit and its shastra-karas over other Indian languages and actually

belittling the contribution of sanskrit and shastras and throwing to winds the vision of vak

which treated all manifestations of vaikhariialike. It has caused an amnesia about the

treatment of languages by ancient performers and theatre theorists.

  

For a history of the birth of 'sanskrit drama' please listen to the audio.
