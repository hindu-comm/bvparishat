Hari Om!

Prof. Arjunwadkar has edited a Marathi grammar book named Vyakaranachandrika.

It's not available now.

CVV students got a torn copy in Oriental Institute, Thane, and they have typed the text in Devanagari.

I called the son of Arjunwadkar sir whether we can publish it afresh.

He talked to me for a long time but unfortunately didn't respond thereafter.

  

  

warm regards

Prof. Gauri Mahulikar

Dean of Faculty, Chinmaya University

Veliyanad, Ernakulam, 682313
