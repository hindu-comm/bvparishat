'It is

completely forgotten that by this false glorification we are perpetuating the myth/falsehood

of domination of Sanskrit and its shastra-karas over other Indian languages and actually

belittling the contribution of sanskrit and shastras'

  

It is a good reminder and correction by Bharat Gupt ji.
