Thanks for sharing this link. I know Professor Leela Arjunwadkar. She was my professor for Pali. The late Professor Mangrulkar was a senior professor in Pune. He together with the late Professor K.S. Arjunwadkar produced the magnificent Marathi edition of the Kāvyaprakāśa, but also worked on Marathi literature and grammar.
