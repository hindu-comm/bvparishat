Namaste All,

Could any one please share me the reference of some speakers who can deliver a lecture on Vedanta and Upanishads to children of 10+ years of age.

The event shall be online and children are not being charged to attend the event. The purpose of the lecture shall be to enlighten our children with the core concepts and literature of our sanatan dharma.

Please help me with the references of others or your self reference. Lets have our children aware of our great literature.

I am reachable @ 9880463460 in case any clarifications required.

  

Regards

Manish
