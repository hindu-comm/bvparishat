Namaste,

  

  Am looking for this Kannada book on Tiruppavai, called Tiruppavai Rasaasvaadini, written by Late Sri Krishna Tatacharya.

  

  If anyone can point to a PDF copy of the book available online, I will be grateful.



  Apologies for asking for a Kannada book in a Samskrita forum. But, I feel that the answer to this resides in this august group.

  

Thanks and Regards

\- amar
