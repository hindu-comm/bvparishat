"*Body and Cosmos*is a collection of articles published on the occasion of the 70th birthday of Professor Emeritus Kenneth G. Zysk. The articles revolve thematically around the early Indian medical and astral sciences, which have been at the center of Professor Zyskâ€™s long and esteemed career within the discipline of Indology.  

  

The volume is divided into three parts. The first part is devoted to the medical sciences, the second part to the astral sciences, and the third part to cross-cultural interactions between India and the West, which runs like an undercurrent throughout the work of Professor Zysk.  
  

The articles are written by internationally renowned Indological scholars and will be of value to students and researchers alike."
