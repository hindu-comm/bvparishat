Dear Scholars,  

  Namaste.

  From books on Hindi grammar, I come across reference to "स्वामी विवेकानंद परमहंसः हिन्दी का मौलिक व्याकरण" (for publication details, please see the attached scanned page).

  But I am unable to trace on the net any bookseller for this book, or any soft copy of it. Could anybody help?

  Regards

  Narayan Prasad
