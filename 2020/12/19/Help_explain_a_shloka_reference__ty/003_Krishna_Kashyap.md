Thanksa lot Sri Shankara Ji,

This Mallisena's syad-vada-manjari is somewhat special for me. I have not read the original syadvada manjari. However, I had read E.M Forster's thesis on Syad vAdamanjari about 35 year ago!

  

May I ask you how you found this shloka?

  

Interestingly, Syad VadaManjari is very critical of Buddhism and Vedanta equally. His logic is quite impressive!

*Best Regards,*
