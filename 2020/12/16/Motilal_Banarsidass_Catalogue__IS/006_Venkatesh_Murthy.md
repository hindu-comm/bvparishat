Namaste  

  

Most of the people have become accustomed to reading pdf and soft copy books. They don't want to buy hardcopies. I have not seen Indian publishers allowing soft copy purchases of new publications. This may be another problem why Indian publishers are in trouble. What is wrong in purchasing soft copy and downloading it from publishers? If they are afraid someone will distribute it to others freely. The hard copy also can be photocopied and distributed or it can be scanned and distributed. I am ready to pay for a soft copy download and many people are. Amazon has broughtout Kindle and many many books are available. Why are Indian publishers lagging in technology?
