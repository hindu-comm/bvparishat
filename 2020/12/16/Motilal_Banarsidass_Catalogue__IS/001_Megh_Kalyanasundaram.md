Thanks again, for this.

I had a printed copy of an older edition. This appearsto be the latest version, or close.  

Indeedthat does (worryingly) sound like one shut down perhaps too many.

Incidentally, I had called 044-43535417 just last Friday, to enquire about a particular book.

  

Best,

Megh
