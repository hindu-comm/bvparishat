The MLBD store at Chauk in Varanasi was my stop for many years.

Most of my India education began there. The staff was friendly and

they would pack everything and then ship properly. I loved the

service. I guess the brick and mortar stores are going out of fashion.

Barnes and Noble is the only store that is operating in the US, but

the store has become a Departmental store.

With the proliferation of internet resources, the personal book purchase

is reduced only for new editions and keep-sake books.

Talking about books, I don't see many analytic inquiries in BVP that

would demand massive book examination.  

Best regards,
