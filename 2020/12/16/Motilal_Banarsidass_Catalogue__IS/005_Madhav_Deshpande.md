Bijoy Ji,

  

  I completely agree with your experience of MLBD. I have been to their Delhi store several times and bought many books there. I was personally in touch with the late Shri N.P. Jain. It is sad to see their stores closing, but, as you say, physical bookstores are closing in the US, the business shifting to online outfits. Amazon killed the Border's chain of bookstores long before Covid 19 hit everybody. Now major businesses are going out of business. I don't know what the post-Covid recovery will look like, but it will not be a return to how the world was before Covid.
