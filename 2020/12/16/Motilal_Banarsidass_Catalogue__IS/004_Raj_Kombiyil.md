Majority of us tend to leave it at that (it's sad/really bad..hope they do well etc.) We don't do anything to popularize yeomen service Gita press (btw, they're doing well. News about their bad fin situ is fake!), MLBD etc are doing.. esp amongst younger gen. Many are not even aware of these -- Amazon has become one stop solution. Maybe we can put out adverts, link to their websites (those who run their own websites), send info in WA groups to popularize. Just thinking out loud. Om Namah Shivaya🙏
