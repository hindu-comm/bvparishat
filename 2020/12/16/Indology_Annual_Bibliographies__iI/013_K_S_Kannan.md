Wonderful, wonderful, dear Dr. Bagchee!

  

I am not in particular need right now of any specific material.

**My concern is essentially systemic**.

  

You agree with me that Indology as it stands today is dominated by  

\- or should I say infested with - Western Indologists (who are not practising Hindus).  

The writings of a good many of them reeks with contempt if not outright hatred of Hinduism

(a pagan faith, after all). The domination there of Christians/Leftists/(pseudo-)Secularists  

out to vilify and calumniate a harmless faith is writ large in whatever has issued from their pen  

for over two centuries. (Exceptions exempted).  

  

There is a crying need for remedying this ghastly situation. Even if attempts have been made

in some Indian journals to respond to some of these challenges, they remain mostly inaccessible.

  

The situation on the whole is that if you search for some writing on any Indian theme,  

you can only get, by and large, what Westerners have written about them, or what is  

filtered through Western lenses. The Western cartel is formidable and well-fortified

\- even if not impregnable.

  

The net result is :  

\- You type any Sanskrit word in Jstor, and you are inundated with Western writings  

on the same from over a century if not more. (That they have now included

the contents of ABORI or BDCPRI does not make any major difference).  

\- You go to Wikipedia wrt any Indian theme, and you see typical Western approaches  

dominating the presentation.

\- You look into the latest catalogue of Motilal Banarsidass, the biggest **Indian** Indological publisher,

and over 90% of the writings on Indian themes or texts are from the Western pen.  

-You look for Encyclopedias of Hinduism, and many betray the dominat Western source.  

\- You look for key conferences on Hindu themes, they are largely/systematically organised by the West.

\- And the less said about Indological journals the better.  

  

One even gets a doubt as to whether Indians have had little, or almost nil,  

to say anything worthwhile about their own heritage !  

  

Too few know about the various Indian journals (I refer to the Indological ones) on the one hand,

and fewer still have easy access to it, on the other. And the deterioration tells itself :  

in terms of get-up/standards/regularity, too few Indian journals can stand up to their  

Western counterparts. And you can see more and more articles/books by Western writers  

appearing on Archive.org also of late, even recent ones among them. Even their PhD theses  

are inundating the same locus.  

  

It is as though there is no venue or avenue that Westerners are not flooding their writings with,  

in order to ensure that none (esp. the Indian) knowledgeable in English (or kindred languages)  

escapes uninfluenced by their ideas.  

  

And worse perhaps is the recent step by the Central government in order to ensure/enhance  

the standard of research in our country : by way of insisting on getting the SCOPUS certification

even in Humanities - even for articles in or about Sanskrit or Indology (I hope I am right wrt this info);  

and hardly do any, or only too few after all, of our own journals - can qualify per that criterion.

  

As a result, a young scholar tends to quote the Westerners' approbation as a standard testimonial  

to the views he is presenting (and would rather stoop to steal an idea from an Indian author  

than cite him and give due credit; who can find it out that easily, after all?).

  

**I am not against Westerners' writing** whatever they do wrt our heritage. They disparage  

all heritages except their own (and anarchists there, typified by Chomsky perhaps, would

not spare even that perhaps). After all, is it not the very nature of the leech that  

\- with undivided attention, and unsparing efforts - it sucks rather, the very blood out of the udders  

of even the Kāmadhenu that can shower the ever-nourishing nectarine milk ?  

  

That they have not one word to write against the uniformly horrendous happenings  

in Islamic history (by no means a non-continuing legacy) - great as the Westerners are  

in their vaunted guts - is quite a different matter.

  

**My essential concern/focus is this : What contributions have our own Sanskritists made  
**

**in the past century or more in our own journals? Why should they not be accessible**

to our own scholars and students - even with such advanced technology as obtains today?  

Why are we not documenting the work of our own scholars first?  

  

This, I suppose, is the first step towards a reclamation of our own heritage :  

the more important and more stupendous goal looming large before our eyes.

  

What if we become "*ātma-nirbhar*" in everything  

\- but have to perforce outsource authentic knowledge about our own heritage?  

(Do the Chinese and the Japanese, our Asian neighbours, do it?

Does even Buddhism, our younger, sister religion do it?)  

  

Against this background, the endeavour made by your good self, Dr. Bagchee,  

is remarkable and commendable. The day must soon come when all that repository of yours  

becomes an honoured publication of Rashtriya Samskrit Samsthan  

or any august body that cherishes our heritage.  

  

(Sorry for the long mail.)  

  

Warm Regards,  

KSKannan
