Dandekar's summarisation of the article or the book (which could be  

in different languages) and the review - both in a brief compass -  

could give a quick idea as to what could be expected from the item.

  

Jstor may provide a whole article, or even detailed book reviews,

but the stamp of a versatile mind capturing some key points

\- is what is badly missed today.
