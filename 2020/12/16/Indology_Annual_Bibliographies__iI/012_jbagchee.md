Dear Kannan,

  

is there something specific you seek? I have copies of the contents pages of all Indological Festschriften in German and several other commemorative volumes. I also have copies of the contents pages of all the German Indological journals. I can scan the ones you require and send them. If there are specific articles you require, I also have all the articles on textual criticism, critical editions, the MBh, and statements about Indology/history of Indology in my archives.

  

Long term, I plan to digitize all this material and make it available online. Your suggestion of providing a brief summary of each article for those who cannot read German is excellent.

  

Regards,

Joydeep
