I completely agree with you, Professor Kannan. For many scholars who could not read German or French themselves, Dandekar's summaries of publications in those languages provided a glimpse of those publications. As I remember my classes with Professor Dandekar at the University of Pune, he was not merely reporting research by western scholars, but he was also critiquingit at the same time.
