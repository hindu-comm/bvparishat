Rashtriya Samskrita Samsthan, Ganganath Jha Campus

used to publish an *Annual Bibliography of Indology*.

I am not aware exactly how many volumes have come out,  

and for which years. Such volumes will help students/scholars  

to keep abreast of current issues, and trends and developments  

in research and writing, including creative ones.

  

The annual surveys that Prof. RNDandekar used to make from BORI,  

howsoever idiosyncratic they were, are also badly missed.  

  

Given their scale and massiveness, these are tasks that can be taken up only by institutions,

and should indeed be resumed by them, or else taken up by new ones.
