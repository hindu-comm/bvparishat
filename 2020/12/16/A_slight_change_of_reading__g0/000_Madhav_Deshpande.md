कवि: काव्यं करोतीति केचिदूचुर्विपश्चित: ।  
करोति काव्यमात्मानं लेखनी केवलं कवे: ।। 

This was my original verse today. A friend suggested that I should change करोति in the second line to कुरुते. This produces an interesting finer reading for the verse. कुरुते काव्यमात्मानम् with the verb in आत्मनेपद makes a better grammatical sense. Then the परस्मैपद in the first line may have other likely interpretations. The poet writes for someone else, as the poem makes the pen of the poet to get it written down. A nice contrast in the use of आत्मनेपद and परस्मैपद. This was an insightful suggestion from this friend of mine.
