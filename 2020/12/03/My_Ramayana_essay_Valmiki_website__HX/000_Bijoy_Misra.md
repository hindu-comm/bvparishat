Dear friends,

  

Greetings from the US. Things are really bad here. We are confined,  

but are safe so far. I learn that India is slowly coming out of the woods.  

We may have a vaccine for people next week. Hope we get relief.

There is a lot of suffering.  

  

I am sharing my latest article in the series of Sugriva here.

A Hindi translation appeared yesterday in a literary magazine from Bhopal.
