Many of our colleagues live by themselves for various reasons.

Most of them are suffering because of isolation. I occasionally

go out to help and then take two weeks of quarantine. The social

network is poor in the local society, We drop them off in the hospital  

and have no courage to check back! Many may not survive the  

winter months.

Regards,
