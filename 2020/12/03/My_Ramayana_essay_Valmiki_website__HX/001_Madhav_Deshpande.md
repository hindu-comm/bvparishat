Thanks, Bijoy Ji, for sharing your article. California is now leading Covid-infections and my daughter, who is a doctor, says that the hospitals will soon start rejecting patients. The hospitals are running out of space and there are not enough nurses and doctors to take care of the massive number of infected patients. We are also staying locked at home and minimizing contact even with our extended family. By the time people like us get access to the vaccine, it will probably be February. Several of my acquaintances are down with Covid, and no one is truly safe. Please take care of yourself.
