In my bhagavad-gita class, these 2 questions have popped up.

  

1\) The verse brahma-satyam-jagan mithya jivO it seems occurs in only this work of Sri Shankaracharya:

  

<https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_z_misc_shankara/brahmajna.html?lang=sa>  

  

**The 20^(th)verse of[Brahmajnanavalimala](http://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_z_misc_shankara/brahmajna.html?lang=sa):**

> ब्रह्म सत्यं जगन्मिथ्या जीवो ब्रह्मैव नापरः ।  
> अनेन वेद्यं सच्छास्त्रमिति वेदान्तडिण्डिमः ॥ २०॥ >
>   
> > Is this the work of Sri Adi-Shankaracharya? >
> Or a later Shankaracharya?

Does this verse repeat again in any other major work of Sri Shankaracharya.

  

I felt ashamed that after decades of study, I had not heard of

Bhramhajnanavalimala !!!

  

I looked into the list of works of Sri Shankaracharya on google.

Out of so many results, I got, I could find this grantha listed only in this site:

  

<https://www.advaita-vedanta.org//texts/Complete_Works_of_Adishankara.html>  

  

2.13 bhramA nanjana vali mAlA
\[21\]

Is this work generally acceptable as written by Sri Adishankaracharya? It should be, since [advaita-vedanta.org](http://advaita-vedanta.org) is a standard advaita website. am I right?

  

2\) I googled further and found out the explanation given by Sri Mani Dravid Shastrigalon that subject. Is this explanation pretty much the standard view of Advaita?  

Where can I find sanskrit descriptions of "bramha satyam jaganmitthya" written by later Shankaracharya lineage acharyas, which can be quoted universally like prakasatma, or bhamati-kara, or anandagiri or madusudhana sarasvathietc?
