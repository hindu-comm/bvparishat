This is one that is crisp: (One may not get an intended resultthat does have the word 'mithya'.)

  

In His commentary to the Taittiriya Upanishad, Acharya Shankara gives a comprehensive definition of ‘Satyam’ while commenting on this term occurring in the Upanishad in the definition of Brahman: ‘Satyam JnAnam Anantam Brahma.’

यद्रूपेणयन्निश्चितं तद्रूपं न व्यभिचरति, तत् सत्यम् ।यद्रूपेणयन्निश्चितं तत् तद्रूपं व्यभिचरति, तदनृतमित्युच्यते । अतो विकारोऽनृतम्, ’वाचारंभणं विकारो नामधेयं मृत्तिकेत्येव सत्यम्’, एवं सदेव सत्यम् इत्यवधारणात् ।

//As for satyam, a thing is said to be satyam, true, when it does not change the nature that is ascertained to be its own; and a thing is said to be unreal when it changes the nature that is ascertained to be its own.Hence a mutable thing is unreal, for in the text, ‘All transformation has speech as its basis, and it is name only.Clay as such is the reality.’ (Chandogya Up. 6.1.4), it has been emphasized that, that alone is true that Exists (Ch.Up. 6.2.1)

Also in the commentary to the Gita verse 2.16, the Acharya says:

यद्विषया बुद्धिर्न व्यभिचरति तत्सत्, यद्विषया व्यभिचरति तदसत् …।

\[That is said to be Real, of which our consciousness never fails; and that Unreal, of which our consciousness fails.\]

No. Nevertheless, the statement is not wrong. It only condenses the Advaita doctrine.

Yes, very much, in this site:<https://advaitasharada.sringeri.net/search/index>

It will take only one distinct word in the box. If you give two words, even if they are in a valid sentence, it will show 0 results. For example, अनादि will be taken and you will get results. Yet, if you want all the results for this word, it is better you give नादि. Still, even this will not give all the results since anaadi can be a part of a samasta word नाद्य (अनाद्यविद्या).. So, one will have to make several attempts to get the complete picture. No doubt it is time consuming.
But one surely gets rewarded.
