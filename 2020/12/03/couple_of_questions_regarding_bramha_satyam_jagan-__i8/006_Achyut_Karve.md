Nature has gifted us only with sense perceptions. Can sensing instruments under stand the nature of the thing being sensed?

  

The jagat therefore is that which is revealed through sense perceptions. How can it reveal the under lying reality?

  

To understand the underlying reality man has to transcend the sense perceptions. And this in my belief is what is called darshan which ultimately leads to knowing the brahman.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
