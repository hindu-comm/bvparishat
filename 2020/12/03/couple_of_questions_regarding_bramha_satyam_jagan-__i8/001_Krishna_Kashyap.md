Few follow up questions:

  

3\) Please locate me where Sri Shankaracharya defines the term mithya

4\) does "bramha satyam jaganmithyajivo bramhaiva naparaha"' statement comes in prasthana traya bhashya of Sri shankaracharya?

5\) is prasthana traya bhashya searchable ? which site? is it shringeri one?

I tried but I am making some mistake in searching.

I was not successful.
