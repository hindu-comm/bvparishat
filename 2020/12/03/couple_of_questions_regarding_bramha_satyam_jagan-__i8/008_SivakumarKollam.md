SAdara praNAm,

Being associated with a project to publish

in malayalam all the available works of Acharya

our team lead by Swami Haribrahmendranandaji maharaj

collected all the works of which the authorship is attributed to Acharya.

We got it all translated and typeset in Malayalam.  

Altogether it came to 16000 pages in 18 volumes in dummy 1/8 !

This is the fact about works attributed to Acharya!

Interestingly nowhere in the prasthAna thraya bhAshya  

we see 'jagat mithya'!  

Only in prakarana grantha we come across it as cited by you.

Namaste.  

  

*Prof. Sivakumar*
