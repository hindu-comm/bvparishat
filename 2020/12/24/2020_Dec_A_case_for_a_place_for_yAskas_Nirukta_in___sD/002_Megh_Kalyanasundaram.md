I *perhaps*agree more than not. Nuance-less/nuance-free "complete gender equality"—whether or not any such study gets popular—such a hypothesis might indeed find itself up against evidence to the contrary, not just in texts in Sanskrit but also (at least) in Latin.

  

That said, for those who are interested in **inclusive histories of ideas** and who can see a difference between simply anunqualified "complete gender equality" and (in my view at least, a more qualified and nuanced) "...the **thought** of complete gender equality **in property inheritance**..." {highlighted in yellow in the abstract (in the trail below)}, the evidence invoked in [this paper](https://www.academia.edu/44767596/A_case_for_a_place_for_Y%C4%81ska_s_Nirukta_in_inclusive_global_histories_of_Technology_Science_Gender_Equality_in_Inheritance_and_an_argument_of_consequence_to_the_chronology_of_some_Sm%E1%B9%9Bti_texts) might perhaps be of interest.

  

"...thought of..." (p. 1, p. 8, p. 9)

"...property inheritance..." (p. 1, p.9)

  

Best,

Megh
