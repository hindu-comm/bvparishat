The attachment does Open. I have read in Kannada the BookShrautayagna Kalpavalli Ananda Tirtha Sharmaji. This list normally discusses Sanskrit and related books. The book is a scholarly treatise but this advertisement brochure doesn't befit the book written byAnanda Tirtha Sharmaji.

  

Id not think Polemics and preconceived notion should at all be discussed on this list The first line on the pdf document sates

  

The first sentence reads

"We came to know that a band of scholars who are stalwarts in Madhwa philosophy and in Yaagnika prakriya are arranging a Seminar

on 30th and 31st of December to discuss on Yageeya Pashuhimsa..This meeting is futile. We request all scholars to do justice to all

animals in all yagnas"

The last Sentence reads

  

"This is not a personal opinion of any scholar but it is a greatest responsibility of every Vedic scholar to defend Hinduism. If a scholar

gives permission to kill a cow and it's dynasty on the basis of Veda mantras, he is definitely not a Hindu scholar. We request all scholars

of Dwaita, Adwaita, Vishishtadwaita and all Hindus to read thehumble work Shroutha Yagna Kalpavalli with fine and pure heart".

  

The above sentences are in bad taste. This is the opinion of a scholar and is the scholars personal view

  

All Vedic scholars are awake and are not sleeping Thanks any way for the awakening
