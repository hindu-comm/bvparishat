Today is Tiruvātira in the month of Dhanu, an occasion for grand celebrations in Kerala in the days of yore. The moonlight of the Ārdrā night (ātira nilāvŭ) is a favorite metaphor of Malayalam poets.

Just remembered the Tiruvātira celebrations of my boyhood.  Like Ōṇam and Viṣu, Tiruvātira used to be celebrated in a grand fashion in the Vāriyam-s of Kerala. (A Vāriyam is a traditional home of a Warrier joint family.) There would be many rituals including the Tiruvātira Kaḷi (Tiruvātira dance). What was of interest for us boys was eating the kūva pāyasam made of arrow root powder and the so called eṭṭaṅṅāṭi (എട്ടങ്ങാടി) containing eight ingredients, after these were offered to the Lord as part of the pooja. There would also be plantain chips, plantains, bananas, and sweets. 

  

An interesting ritual was, looking at the Ārdrā (Tiruvātira) star up in the sky. As I remember, this was Betelgeuse, as shown in the picture.

  

Here is a Tiruvātira song for your enjoyment:
