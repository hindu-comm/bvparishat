सर्वेभ्यो नमः

  

The name गुडाकेश in MB appears several times

The popular meaning that I am aware of is -onewho has conquered sleep ( गुडाका = Sleep)

  

However, does anyone know any event/incident behind this source (i.e any event that happened in MB, where Arjuna conquered sleep?)

Although I am aware of such an event for Bhima in Varanavata - where he didn't sleep for months together watching and protecting his mother and brothers, I am curious to know whether such a similar incident (or order of magnitude more) is also attributed to Arjuna anywhere ?

  

Thanks

Vijayananda
