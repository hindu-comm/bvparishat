I think the original poster wanted the story related to arjuna conquering sleep because of which he got the name guDAkesha.

  

Did he not do sleepless tapasyA to get the divine weapons he got, which he later hid up in a tree. I am forgetting the details. Maybe that is when he got the name.  
  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
