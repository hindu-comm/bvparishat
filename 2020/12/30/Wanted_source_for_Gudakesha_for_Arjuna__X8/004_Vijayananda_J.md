Namaste Arjun mahodayaha

Thanks for responding to the question

I did check the Virata parva - but unfortunately, गुडाकेश, is not one of them

  

अर्जुनः फल्गुनोजिष्णुः किरीटी श्वेतवाहनः ।  

बीभत्सुर्विजयः पार्थः सव्यसाची धनञ्जयः v.p .43.19

  

So, unless there is special reason to consider the meaning of conquering the sleep for Arjuna (considering असाधारण्येन व्यपदेशाः भवन्ति), I am tending towards considering the other general meaning of thick-haired, as you noted  

  

Regards

Vijayananda
