Namaste Vijayananda ji,

  

The wordगुडाका has several meanings according to the different *kosha*s. The Vachaspatyam says, आलस्य is also a meaning along with निद्रा (स्त्री गुडि वेष्टने बा० आकन् उपघालोपश्च). The Kalpadruma mentions, "गुडयति सङ्कोचयति जडीकरोति देहेन्द्रियादीनि योऽवस्थाविशेषः स गुडः, तं आकायति प्रकाशयतीति । गुडां आलस्यं जाड्यावस्थां कायति वा । गुड + आ + कै + कः स्त्रियां टाप् ।". According to [Monier Williams](https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/csl-apidev/servepdf.php?dict=MW&page=356) Dictionary, "thick-haired" is the meaning which clearly refers to Arjuna (please check under the word - गुड). The etymology of the word गुडाका itself is an interesting point here.

  

For the popular 'one who has conquered the sleep' meaning referred by you, we 'may' connect Arjuna' practice even at night. The reference for the same can be found at the beginning of the 123rd chapter of Adi Parva(BORI edition). I couldn't find any other incident/event related to this meaning. Other learned scholars of this group may put more light on this.

  

I found this extra information as well -

1\) We can get the famous ten names of Arjuna and its explanation by himself to prince Uttara in the 39th chapter of Virata Parva(BORI edition).

2\) The wordगुडाकेश occurs 32 times in BORI edition in all its forms (extracted using our[Mahabharata Search](http://mahabharata.manipal.edu/#/search)with theadvanced option enabled).  

  

I hope this helps.

Thank you.

  

Regards,

Arjuna
