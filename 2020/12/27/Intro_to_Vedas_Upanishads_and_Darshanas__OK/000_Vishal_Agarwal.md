Namaskar,

  

Below is the link to my introductory talk on the Vedas, Upanishads and Darshanas meant for a non specialist audience. It presented the traditional view however using many modern examples. It was delivered on 25December2020 for the Hindu Heritage Foundation of America.

I know that the audience of this list might find it too general and elementary but note that it was meant for those who have no background on these matters. My purpose was to make them aware of some of the important themes through a somewhat modern framework.
