Dear Prof. Deshpande,

Listening to your Atharva Forum talk was an hour well spent. I found several special points to ponder about. I like to share only two of them and seek your views.

I heard you say Pāṇini’s grammar is meant for someone who knows Sanskrit already. (I am not quoting you, but something nearer to this view point…). Aṣṭādhyāyi is in Sanskrit, but of a kind (meta-Sanskrit ?) specially created for that purpose. Sūtra style might have been available, but the notations अच्, अण्, हल् etc seem to be unprecedented. Am I correct ? \[This notation reminds me of the symbolism that double subscript means summation in Mechanics\]. Do we find origin or inspiration for such symbolisms and 'pratyaya' addition to get a word in the Praatis'aakhyaas?

You mentioned thatAṣṭādhyāyiin its original oral tradition had (svara) accents. Is there any evidence for this? I have heard people argue about Vedic Svaras (that are really pitch variations) getting continued in day to day language. If svaras were to be so important as to make meanings topsy-turvy as in इन्द्रशत्रुर्वर्धस्व स्वाहा etc why Saamaveda recitation, for the same Rk-mantra has entirely different Svaras? Is there any serious discussion by traditional or modern scholars on this point?

With best regards

RN Iyengar
