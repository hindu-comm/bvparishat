Yes, it is intense. We did a study group in 1995.

A language scholar Thomas Burke who learned Panini with Ramanath Sharma's father became the

nucleus. He had additional expertise in Latin and Greek.  

Another Kannada speaking professor from the local Northeastern University was the third member.

Prof Balachandra's father was a Sanskrit scholar and a priest. Bala dealt with and taught optimization principles.  

I came from a nationalist poet's family in Odisha and was a physicist.
I was the youngest in the trio.  

We would do two to four sutras in a weekly three hour sitting.

It did take us ten years to complete. We used Basu and Ramanatha Sharma. I loved Panini as a scientist.

The study pushed me to spend more time in India studies.

  

We had done SiddhantaKaumudi before and I didn't like. it was too mechanical.  

  

By the way, like many aging scholars Thomas is not keeping well. He is 86 and single.

Covid has made it difficult for us to support him. Bala is past 80 and his own health issues.  

  

A lovely man, Thomas left his home in Oregon for Germany to do linguistics. He went to India as a Sanskrit  

student in 1963 and eventually taught in Banaras Sanskrit College until 1973. He returned to Havard and worked  

as a staff member. He occasionally taught classes but served as a resource to scores of students who passed  

by the Department of Sanskrit.

  

I take this opportunity to share one of many stories from Cambridge, USA

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
