Dear Bijoy Ji,

  

  It took me twelve years to learn Pāṇini and a lifetimedevoted to exploring his work. Cannot express everything about Pāṇini in one lecture. Hopefully, as you say, there will be more occasions, where other scholars will bring out further aspects of Pāṇini that you mention. With best regards,
