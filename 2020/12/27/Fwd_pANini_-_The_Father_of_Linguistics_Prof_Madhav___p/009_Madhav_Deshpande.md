Dear Srini,

  

  You raise a good question. While we see Ashokan inscriptions in Greek script and language in the regions close to Pāṇini's hometown, were there Greeks in the area before Alexander's invasion? From what I understand, there were Greek and Aramaic speakers in the employ of the Persian empire before Alexander's invasion. I don't remember where I read this, but presumably there were Aramaic speakers as local officials in the eastern parts of the Persian empire. In keeping records, they may have begun transcribing Indic person's names and names of localities in Aramaic script, and such early Aramaic transcriptions of Indic words may have given rise to modified versions of Aramaic script resulting in the early forms of Brahmi and Kharoshthi. I cannot confirm this, but I did come across some publication that proposed this as a likely development. Will see if I can locate it.
