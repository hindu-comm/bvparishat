Dear Megh Ji,

  

  I am glad to see that you took the time to listen to my interview on Atharva. I saw your comment about Pāṇini's date and your citation of V.S. Agrawala's view. Yes, I am aware of Agrawala's view, and also of differing views expressed by Kiparsky, Cardona, Thieme and other scholars on this topic. There is almost a range of two hundred years within the proposed dates based on different interpretations of what evidence there is. At the end, I agree with Professor Cardona's summary statement on this issue: "The available evidence does not allow one to determine Pāṇini's date with absolute precision. Nevertheless, the evidence also precludes placing Pāṇini at a time later than the early fourth century B.C.: 500 B.C. is a reasonable date to accept."
\[Cardona: Pāṇini, His Work and Traditions, Vol 1, Background and Introduction, 2nd edition, Revised and Enlarged, MLBD, 1917, p.\]. In my talk, I added "500 B.C. plus/minus." In one lecture, there was no more time to devote to this issue. Again, I wish to thank you for taking the time to listen to the talk. With best wishes,
