The talk was quite interesting, Prof Deshpande ji.

  

When I was listening to the talk, the following were some of the thoughts that came to my mind.

  

In one of the previous companies where I worked, I had a colleague from an African country (I now forget which country it is). He told me that his country had several tribal languages many of which were mutually unintelligible. Hence, Pidgin English was the informal language for communication. Overall, Pidgin English has English words and the structure of English language, but the grammar is simplified. The pronunciation of English words is also different in Pidgin English.
Pidgin English is not taught in schools. Standard English and Standard French are the languages taught in schools and these are the languages for administration and formal communication. Many tribes are adopting Pidgin English as their first language and abandoning their tribal languages.

  

In Latin America, the genetic make-up of the population is predominantly native American, yet they speak the language brought by the conquistadors from Europe. They have totally abandoned their ancestral languages.

  

Decades ago, I had a very short visit to Belgaum (now Belagavi). I observed that most people there are trilingual speaking Kannada, Marathi and a variety of Hindi. The language of the marketplace seemed to be this variety of Hindi and not Kannada or Marathi. It was interesting to see the same bus conductor ask "Kuṭṭhe" in Marathi (not "Kuḍe" as Mumbai conductors ask), or "Elli" in Kannada. However, most times he would ask “kahāṃ” in Hindi. It appeared that given sufficient time, this Belgaum Hindi could become the first language of Belgaum, just as Mumbai Hindi has become the first language of second and third generation Mumbaiites even from Kerala and Tamil Nadu.

  

Could some of the Prakrits have developed as Pidgin Indo-Aryan as spoken by originally non-Indo-Aryan speakers? Could that be the reason why the pronunciation of cognate words in Sanskrit became so much different in Prakrits? As a counter example, modern day Malayalam pronunciation is not very different from the pronunciation of words of Sangam Tamil even after the passage of two thousand years.
