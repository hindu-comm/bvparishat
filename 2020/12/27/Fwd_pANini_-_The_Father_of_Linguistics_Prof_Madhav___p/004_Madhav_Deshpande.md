Thank you, Radhakrishna Ji. My language experience is similar to yours. Most Indians are at least multi-dialectal, if not also multi-lingual. This is especially true of border regions. Pune of my childhood was not as multi-lingual, but my wife comes from Sangli, a border town, so that her Marathi initially sounded as if it had a Kannada accent. What you say in your last paragraph is close to what I have argued in my own publications. In ancient times, the Indo-Aryan languages were spoken by large populations initially probably as second languages, and interactions of IA languages with non-IA languages become more and more evident as time moves ahead. Languages like Marathi are indeed border languages. I agree with Professor Franklin Southworth's theory that the original language of the region of Maharashtra was most likely Kannada, and gradually Maharashtri Prakrit made its way into this region. Marathi, in this theory, initially developed as a pidgin which was in the course of time creolized and became the mother tongue of the population. It still retains trace of its relation to Kannada in vocabulary and syntax. The literary form of Marathi always remained in close touch with Sanskrit and the vocabulary of literary Marathi was continuously re-Sanskritized from the times of Dnyaneshwar upto Savarkar.
