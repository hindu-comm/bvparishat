Dear Professor Iyengar,

  

  Thank you so much for your appreciation of my Atharva talk. Here are my responses toyour questions.  

  

  Pāṇini's Aṣṭādhyāyī is in technical Sanskrit, and yet one cannot follow this technical Sanskrit without knowing the basic Sanskrit. So, I do not believe that the Aṣṭādhyāyī was originally designed to be read/understood by someone who does not already know Sanskrit. The technical language used by Pāṇini is not entirely limited to Pāṇini.
The few rules of Āpiśali, Vyādi and Gālava that have survived and the Kāśakr̥tsna Dhātupātha that has come down to us indicate that many grammarians were already using this type of technical language. The rule of Vyādi and Gālava that has been quoted, i.e. इकां यण्भिर्व्यवधानं व्याडिगालवयो:, uses the shortformsiK and yaṆ based on the Śivasūtras.
There is a similar rule of Āpiśali quoted by commentators. The occasional separation of pratyayasis seen in the Padapāṭha of Śākalya, and the Padapāṭha also splits compounds. Yāska's Nirukta also uses the notions of stems and affixes extensively. So it is clear that the use of technical language was quite widespread, and did not begin with Pāṇini.

  For the discussion of Svaras in Pāṇini's Aṣṭādhyāyi and what happened to them during the transmission, let me attach my article on this subject that deals with this question exhaustively. With best regards,
