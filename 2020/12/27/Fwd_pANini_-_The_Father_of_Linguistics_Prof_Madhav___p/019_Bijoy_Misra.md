Madhavji,

  

Thank you for sharing the article. I admire the effort in compiling a large amount of information.

I infer from vākyapaḍiyam about the vast mīmāṁsā literature that developed to negotiate sounds

as instructions. I didn't find much analysis in that regard, but your goal was the printed script.

In many scripts in the world, the vowels and accents are added while reading. I have not

personally tried the efficacy of the process, but native speakers remain comfortable with it.

Literature may exist on the physics of expression in such a situation.
The word or sound

possibly assumes allotropic variation given the context in which the vowel is used. The  

information could remain coded. It is also true with English language where the expressed

sound has little similarity with the printed text.

  

I also have an observation on the nasal sounds. I would think that nasal accent is a part

of the basic human speech process. Rural speech, older languages, and all existing hill

languages carry the nasal accent. This could bring the question as to what the real sound

of a word is. I was taught by English language teacher in Grade V to erase my nasal

accent which I had developed through my ancestral upbringing in Puri. I observed

the difference pretty late in life. People in pure urban setting may never know what a

word ought to sound or what it was during the time of Panini.

  

We admire Panini for examining the numances in speech and probing the root  

from the context. The process could be evolutionary.  

  

Best regards.

Happy New Year.
