Namaste / Namaskaaram Dr. Srinivas,

  

I appreciate some of the specificity in your note.

Let me though, for now, just mention that more points than what has been covered in Dr. Deshapande's 8:43:10 AM UTC-5 note (in trail below) and your8:02 PM note (also in trail below) were raised in the comments section, one of which has to do with a 2020 article of Dr. Deshpande.

Again, I acknowledge some of the engagement though.

  

Sincerely,

Megh
