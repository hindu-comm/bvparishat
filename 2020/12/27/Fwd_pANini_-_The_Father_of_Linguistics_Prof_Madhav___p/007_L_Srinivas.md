Sri Megh's reference to Sri Agrawala's various points (twitter post) have been taken up in Cardona: Panini, A Survey of Research (1997), pp. 261-277. Sri Agrawala's reasoning around gold coins etc have also been taken up in a separate publication (See Cardona: Panini's Dates and the Evidence of Coinage)  

  

A side issue however. Prof Deshpande's considered opinion of a date around 500 BC, while very reasonable, raises another question - what script is refered to by 'yavanani'? Could it actually be Greek, as mentioned by Prof Deshpande in the talk, at this early period? What does the ethnonym 'yavana' even mean at this early date?  

  

  

  

Thanks,
