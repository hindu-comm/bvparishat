Dear Madhavji and friends,

I did listen to the talk last night. I must confess that I was bothered with the heavy amount of

speculations and arbitrary assumptions. Let me hope that the Government of India and the

scholarly groups in languages would put sufficient resources to produce good research on these

fundamental aspects of Indian tradition. I did expect to hear more on Panini's methods and

their evolution in time through the previous grammarians. Questions like

\(a\) what's a syllable

\(b\) how does a syllable assume a sound

\(c\) what's the origin of a syllable

\(d\) how does a syllable carry meaning

\(e\) where does the meaning lie (in the object or the subject)

I think the answers to these had been analyzed by the time Panini took up the task of compilation.

Even though the claim is that he wishes to code the language, there is a larger thesis of knowledge symbolism in human syllables.  

It is assumed as a tool of communication or philosophical, but it appears to be scientific to me.  

It is this naturalness of Panini's work that I wanted to hear. Language is not a word play, it is human expression.  

Hopefully there will be substantial more work in the coming years.  

Best regards.

BVP has always been a blessing to me in its material content and resourcefulness.

With gratitude I wish you all a Happy New Year.
