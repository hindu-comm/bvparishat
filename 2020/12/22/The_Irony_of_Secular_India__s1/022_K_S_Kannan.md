Did the predatory Abrahamic faiths

*ever* have a different agenda than destroying the pagans and heathens?

Full scale genocide, preceded by cultural genocide,

is their regular and routine, or rather *sole*, programme, through centuries/more.

Hardly anything to be surprised about.

  

What *is* to be surprised about is how none of these "heathens"  

studied this deeply and evolved remedial/counteractive strategies.

  

Incredible credulousness can have no other consequence, after all!

Some creeds are simple and straightforward, having but one motto:  

You kill me or I kill you - culturally/physically. How to handle them?
