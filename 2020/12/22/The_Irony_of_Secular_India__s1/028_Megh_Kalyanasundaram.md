"Satish Mahaldar, Chairman of the Reconciliation, Return & Rehabilitation said,”The day matters to the Kashmiri Pandits because it is one of the most extensively documented instances of atrocities, hatred, dehumanisation, and apathy in the present day world history. The Holocaust Day matters to the community because when ethnic cleansing of the minorities was happening, the world just watched silently.”" [](https://ind.news/remembering-the-modern-day-genocide/)
