OUP can, but no Indian university dare,

publish *Manusmr̥ti* (or any *smr̥ti* for that matter).

Our "liberals" and "secularists" will cry hoarse.

  

Does anyone remember any program on the Veda-s on AIR *ever*

(or perhaps on TV too) ? : Secularists here will cry "sacrilegious"!

Buddhist scriptures, however, are ok (I remember hearing Buddhist recitations and commentary

in Kannada from AIR daily in my schooldays) : After all, Leftists are ok with it.

  

Our politicians, university professors, and public figures could speak freely of  

Christ, Buddha, or Ambedkar; but no, never in any positive manner about  

Rāma or Kr̥ṣṇa or Śiva or Devī - veritable anathemas to our "secularists".  

  

\[A few years ago there was a shibboleth flaunted :  

"India shines -

with more than one Muslim President for the country,  

and a Christian President of a national party!"

Imagine this happen in any of the 50 Christian or 50 Islamic countries

\- with a Hindu President etc. !\]
