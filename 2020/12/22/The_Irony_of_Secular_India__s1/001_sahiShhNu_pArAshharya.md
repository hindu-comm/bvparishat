Dear Dr Kannan,

  

You raise a good question that many would not be courageous to ask. Insofar as a 'religion' is understood as a creed, a faith, or persuasion, institutionalized as a set of attitudes, beliefs and practices, Secularism itself has regrettably become (or rather: has been made to become) a religion. There are tenets one cannot challenge, beliefs one cannot possibly hold, and practices that are shunned and castigated - otherwise, one becomes a heretic ('communal').

  

Marx famously said that religion was the opium of the masses, but the irony (and farce of history) is that in all communist movements across the world, 'Marxism' and 'communism' itself are also religions in their own right (after all, what is the Politburo, if not a great Church?). They both profess access to the profound truth of the world and how it can be rescued or saved ('moksa', so to speak). They tell us who the 'oppressors' are and who to 'liberate' (which is their peculiar 'dvaitavāda', so to speak - since this duality is never overcome). And this is the only correct view - everyone else is either brainwashed or ignorant. Yet the irony is the liberators nearly always became oppressors when they entered into power. These strains of ideas reach their zenith with Lenin and Trotsky - but annihilates itself and others in the hands of Stalin. Perhaps if only Marx understood the human condition and mātsyanyāya better, he may have realized that even victims become oppressors and even liberators become tyrants.

  

Something similar has now become applicable for Secularism (with a capital S). It was once meant and intended to promote and preserve pluralism and diversity (in the Indian context), even though the Latinate English term meant non-Church-related, a sort of non-religiosity (as in French secularism). But what many fail to grasp is that dharmanirapekṣa (पंथनिरपेक्ष वा) is notdharmarahita (Church-रहित इत्यर्थे). The former Sanskritic term, dharmanirapekṣatā, beautifully expresses a politicaladvaitavāda (that transcends the narrowness of sectarianism) into a true pluralism.

  

What man (or woman) is trulyधर्मरहित in this world, I wonder? Even the adharmika has their own dharma.
