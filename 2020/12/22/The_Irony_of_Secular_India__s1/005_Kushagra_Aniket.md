I should just add that most universities in the West have religious foundations, particularly in Christianity. Many continue to operate under an established Church. For example, Oxford and Cambridge are ultimately affiliated with the Church of England. Indeed, Oxford was developed around the Church of St Mary the Virgin, which dates back to the Anglo-Saxon era. Many of these universities have incorporated religion in their practices and traditions.

  

During my education at two Ivy League universities, I was surprised to learn that the United States, which was the original torchbearer of religious toleration in the Christian world, has a strong tradition of religious affiliation in its colleges and universities. All but one out of the eight Ivy League universities were founded by religiously affiliated founders. At least four were sectarian. These universities continue to maintain on their campus churches that are either denominational or replete with Christian symbolism.
