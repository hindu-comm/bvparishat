"While we await justice for ethnic cleansing, which has been denied to us for more than three decades now, we carry our wounds inside us. These wounds get reflected in our conversations over tea, marriage functions, and at cremation grounds. We remain tenacious for justice. We seek answers and remedy through constitutional and peaceful ways. We have protested, made appeals to the government and human rights organisations, as well as knocked on the doors of the judiciary. We will continue to do so. That’s our way of seeking justice. That’s our*dharma*."

"According to the[**official website of Jammu and Kashmir government,**](https://jk.gov.in/jammukashmir/?q=demographics)Muslims form 97 per cent of population in Kashmir Valley. Hindus are about two per cent and a large majority of them are Megh Bhagats.

...

Kashmiri Pandits, unique to the Valley were a dominant group in the state until[**jihadi terrorism surfaced in the state in 1989-90 and forced them out.**](https://www.indiatoday.in/fyi/story/exodus-of-kashmiri-pandits-january-19-jammu-and-kashmir-304487-2016-01-19)It was a strategic move to make Kashmir Valley exclusive for Muslims as Article 35A prevented migration to Valley.

The official website of Jammu and Kashmir puts different estimates of Kashmiri Pandits who were driven out of Kashmir by the terrorists - 1,60,000 to 3,00,000. Many Sikh families too fled the Kashmir Valley during the exodus of Hindus."
