Western Universities have never fought shy of publishing books like Dictionaries of Christianity. It is only Indian universities that have to bear the real yoke of Secularism with a capital S (nay all ten letters Capital!) that they cannot publish any book on Hinduism (unless, of course, it is one that has to attack it or disparage it !

## Edited by F. L. Cross and E. A. Livingstone

Uniquely authoritative and wide-ranging in its scope, *The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church* is the indispensable reference work on all aspects of the Christian Church.

***Welcome*** to the website for editors of and contributors to the *Cambridge Dictionary of Christianity*.



Our goal is to produce a comprehensive dictionary of the Christian religion in all of its diversity. (**[*See Key Features*](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/religious_studies/CDC/keyfeatures.htm)*)*
With at least 2700 entries on more than 900 pages, it presents the origins, developments and contemporary manifestations of Christianity in all parts of the world: Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Oceania (1.178 billion Christians), as well as in Western Europe and North-America (661 million) and in Orthodox Eastern Europe (158 million) (see [contextual entries](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/religious_studies/CDC/context.html)). It will contain the definitions of classical terms found in other reference works (see [conceptual-theological and historical entries](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/religious_studies/CDC/concept.html)).
Yet, it is not limited to these traditional subjects. Instead, it includes often ignored geographical regions, popular expressions of faith, and dissenting voices that nonetheless have significantly shaped Christian beliefs and history. 



The definitive and accessible entries will make *The Cambridge Dictionary of Christianity* indispensable for students and scholars, clergy and laity, believers and agnostics--in short, anyone who needs a full and accurate picture of the world's largest organized religion.
