Namaste to all !

  

While reading Sahitya-shastra, one doubt came to my mind.

  

Why are the नायक of any play, prose or poetry have the common prefix 'धीर' ?

  

धीरोदात्तः, धीरोद्धतः, धीरप्रशान्तः & धीरललितः

  

and one more doubt is that if Kansa, Duryodhan etc belong to the group of धीरोद्धतनायक, I acknowledge that definitely they were उद्धत by nature, but why to apply the prefix धीर to them as well ?

  

Moreover, we all know that धीर and उद्धत are both opposite 'swabhav', then how can these two be in the same person ?

  

Please give me the required knowledge. This is my humblerequest.
