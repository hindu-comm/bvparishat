नमस्ते

The features of उदात्तधैर्यं are different from उद्धतधैर्यं. The उदात्तनायक is not धीर in the same sense as उद्धतनायक. The19th chapter of शृङ्गारप्रकाश gives the features of उद्धतधैर्यम् such as अभ्युदयादिभिरुत्सेकः. Whereas a character such as Rama is धीर because of अभ्युदयादिभिः अनुत्सेकः etc., a character such as Ravana is धीर because of अभ्युदयादिभिः उत्सेकः etc.
