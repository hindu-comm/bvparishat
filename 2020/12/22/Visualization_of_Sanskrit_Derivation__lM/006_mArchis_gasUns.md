Do not know how to search for members here.

  

I'm looking at <https://scl.samsaadhanii.in/scl/dhaatupaatha/graphs/gam1.svg>

  

As Apte is the basis, so let us take, for example, पराग. पराग is the परागः from Apte Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary, revised edition, 1957? Because I do not see a link back to गम्and am wondering how to remake the path, to understand how the work is built?

  

parāgaḥ

1 The pollen of a flower; sphuṭaparāgaparāgatapaṅkajam Śi. 6. 2; Amaru. 54.

2 Dust in general; pratāpo'gre tataḥ śabdaḥ parāgastadanantaram R. 4. 30.

3 Fragrant powder used after bathing.

4 Sandal.

5 An eclipse of the sun or moon.

6 Fame, celebrity.

7 Independence, self-will.

8 Medicinal powder; Mātaṅga L. 11. 28.

9 Powder; kāye'pi karpūraparāgapūraḥ Mv. 7. 17.
