Dr Kannan,

  

Pl. look at the attached p.84 of the book. Is this what you had referred to?

  

BTW, I see that many pages in this are in a greyscale (unprocessed), whereas others are in B&W (processed). This page is in greyscale.

  

Probably those are the pages that are not visible in some applications/versions.
