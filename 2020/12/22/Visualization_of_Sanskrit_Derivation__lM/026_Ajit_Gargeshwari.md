The quality of scan Is good. Somepages are color and some pages are black and white Since the size of Color scans, with high resolution will be large I Suggest that you open them on computer which have at least 4 GB of Ram ideal would be at least 8GB Ram I don't see any missing pages. You see balnk Pages because of insufficient RAM you computer has that too when you have opened multiple applications
