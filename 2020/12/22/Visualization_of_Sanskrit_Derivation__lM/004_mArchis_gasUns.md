One does not need Russian to see, how beautiful the graph is. But it is manually made, withoutgraphviz

Is there a list of all the kṛdantas used? Maybe even a list for each dhātu?

To come? May I ask a few more questions, please:

  

Is there a list of all the SVG files on the site?

<https://scl.samsaadhanii.in/scl/dhaatupaatha/graphs/> yes, there is.

  

What do the colours stand for?

Red is for dhātu and sopasarga dhātu? Blue is for kṛdanta forms?

  

Based on <https://scl.samsaadhanii.in/scl/dhaatupaatha/graphs/hq1.svg>

I see that both pure dhātus and sopasarga (with combinations of upasarga's included)
