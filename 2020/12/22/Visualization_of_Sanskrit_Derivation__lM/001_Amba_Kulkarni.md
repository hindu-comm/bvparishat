Hello Mārcis,

  

The attachment is broken.

  

Regarding the words that can be derived from the dhātus, the Apte's dictionary provides the etymology of several kṛdantas.

We have linked them to the entries in the dhātus in the concordance of dhātuvṛttis available on the saṃsādhanī website.

  

For example, for the verb bhū, you can see all the kṛdantas that can be derived from it at<https://scl.samsaadhanii.in/scl/dhaatupaatha/graphs/BU1.svg>

  

Is this what you were looking for?

  

Best,

Amba
