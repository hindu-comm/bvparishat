As far as I know all the k.rdantas from Apte's dictionary are linked.

You may go to the dhaatupaatha page and either place the cursor on the dhaatu to view the graph on the same page, or right clock to view it in a new window/tab.

If there are no words found in the Apte's dictionary, the graph is empty.

But we have not yet published anything on it.
