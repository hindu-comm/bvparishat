Dear Megh,

This is a very interesting picture. Makaraayana means Sun's sojourn in Makara. Instead of worrying about the 'Raashi or the Sign' the direct meaning would be the **month of solar Makara** and the associated entry PuNyakAla. If this is what the Kanchimatham also means for the special Pooja, then it is remarkable and extremely satisfying. The Sugaracane stacks are symbols of harvest and Pongal (literally overflow of boiling milk). Still, TN would officially celebrate Pongal next month only.

Thanks for your post
