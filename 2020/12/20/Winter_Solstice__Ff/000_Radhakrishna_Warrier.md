Where is he? Apparently sleeping behind the rain clouds for the last couple of days. And might continue to do so for another few days.

Anyway, he will reach the finish line of his southern trip soon, then take an infinitesimally short pause and start his northern trip. That infinitesimally short pause will happen in the early morning of Monday at 2:02 AM, Pacific Time.

Speaking of the infinitesimal, our ancient Indian mathematicians and astronomers played with it confidently long before Newton or Leibniz.
Mādhava of Sangamagrāma in Kerala showed us how this infinitesimal can be used to elegantly derive mathematical theorems and formulae used in astronomy. Long before Mādhava, other Indian astronomers too used the infinitesimal happily.

When x is zero, sin x is zero. So, is sin x/x illegal because the numerator and denominator are both zero? That is where the beauty of infinitesimal comes in. As x “tends to zero”, sin x/x will “tend to” 1. This is but one small instance of the happy frolicking of the infinitesimal in mathematics.

After this infinitesimal pause, called “solstice” (sun standing still) our days in the northern hemisphere will happily grow longer. Will continue to grow long for six months.

For those interested, the figure below shows the length of day as a function of the number of days from Spring Equinox (March 20) and the latitude of the place from where the day is enjoyed. These results were obtained with the simple formula shown in the figure itself. The formula can be derived from basic spherical trigonometry. This formula is only approximate as it does not consider some other things that influence the length of the day. However, it is accurate to within ±15 minutes.

I used Excel to do my calculations, and to draw the figure too. Ancient Indian astronomers did similar stuff, and more complex things involving trigonometry. They didn’t have computers and Excel. They laboriously built sin, tan and other trigonometric and power series tables. They did not have the luxury of writing down these values in neat tables. They embedded these values in Sanskrit poetry so that these could be orally transmitted and committed to memory. Written stuff (on palm-leaf books called “grantha”) were only back-ups for reference. Oral transmission and committing to memory were the primary means of passing on and retaining information.
