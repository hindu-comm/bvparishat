The soft copies on archive seem to be scans of old print, and many pages have difficulty reading some words due to smudging. And some pages are missing as well.

  

Are any of the reprints on paper by any of the publishers, that is available to buy, free of this defect?

  

If so, I would like to buy the printed versions, but not just a print out of a scanned pdf copy from archive.

  

Can anyone has printed copy, please post photos of a few sample pages. I just want to see the quality.  
  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
