Dear Marcis,

  

The Sabdakalpadruma was originally published by Radhakanta Deb as 8 volumes, in **Bengali script**, during 1822-1857.

  

A mention of it being in preparation can be seen in HH Wilson's preface to his Sanskrit Dictionary (1st edition, 1919), which was later printed as a separate book after Wilson's demise (with updated footnotes). \[A copy of the relevant portion is attached to this mail.\]

  

Also the Banglapedia mention thus -  

"An accomplished scholar, Radhakanta was proficient in Sanskrit, Persian and Arabic. He also acquired a fairly good knowledge in English. He published Xabda Kalpadruma, a dictionary of Sanskrit language, in eight volumes, the first of which appeared in 1822 and the last in 1856. This was the publication which earned him international recognition as a scholar. He received honours from the Royal Asiatic Society, London, and other learned societies in Europe."

  

The current edition being used and quoted widely is the revised ("**considerably improved, carefully revised and published**") edition by Varadaprasada Basu & Durgacharana Basu as 5 volumes (1st Vol. in Saka 1808 and 5th vol. in Saka 1813, i.e. about A.D. 1886-1891), in "**Nagari letters**".  

  

One can see that the inner opinions pages in this ed. clearly mention about the first edition volumes.  

  

And in 1967 Chowkhamba reprinted this revised edition, without recomposing (photo offset?).

  

Later the same is being published by both Chowkhamba and Rastriya Sanskrit Sansthan.

  

Luckily both the 1st edition and the original revised edition are available at [archive.org](http://archive.org).

  

Really surprised that a resourceful (having a vast collection of books) and knowledgeable person like Ajit Gargeshwari is erred about this.
