Shri Shashi Joshiji

Jai Shri Ram!

The edition published by Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, New Delhi, that I have is quite readable and free from any smudges etc.

Most probably, they have reprinted it further and must be still available for quite reasonable price.

Because of Covid-19, the "sansthan" must be closed these days.

You can try Nag Publishers, New Delhi on the web and find out from them if they have some copies, which may be without subsidy and therefore
costlier comparatively.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
