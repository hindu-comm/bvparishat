Yes, the 5 vol.s published by Basu brothers are being just photo reprinted again and again (by Chowkhamba & RSS) these days.

  

One can get all the earlier editions by searching at [archive.org](http://archive.org) for "Shabda Kalpadruma" and Shabdakalpadruma" or "Deb, Radhakanta"..

And "Sabdakalpadruma" gives the recent editions (esp. the RSS ed.)

  

There are 8 pages of the opinions included in the revised edition about the first edition, **before the bhUmikA (preface)**- from [https://archive.org/details/TheSabdakalpadrumaIRsktS\_201710/page/n10/mode/1up](https://archive.org/details/TheSabdakalpadrumaIRsktS_201710/page/n10/mode/1up) to [https://archive.org/details/TheSabdakalpadrumaIRsktS\_201710/page/n17/mode/1up](https://archive.org/details/TheSabdakalpadrumaIRsktS_201710/page/n17/mode/1up). These pages are in all the versions of this edition (original, Chowkhamba and RSS), and I just gave the RSS links here.
