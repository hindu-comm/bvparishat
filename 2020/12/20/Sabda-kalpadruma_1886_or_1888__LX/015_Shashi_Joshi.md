Ajit ji,

The Blue Covers, 'printed' by chaukhamba?

I have these. That is what I was referringto.

Mostly it is great, but there are many pages, where the ink is a bit smudged.

Scanning can give rise to two problems - either lumping together of strokes making it look smudged, or over cleaning up and making it look crisp but many dots, and marks may disappear.

Chaukhamba'sSubhashitaRatnaBhandagara's soft copy has the same problem.

After scanning, it was 'cleaned' and it misses most of the anusvara and visarga.

  

If the Blue Cover ones are the best available so far, I will live with it.

But the books are such a great source, I wish some project is undertaken to actually retype or at least for those pages where it gets bad are redone.

  

What an amazing gift from almost 200 years back!

  
  

Thanks,  

\~ Shashi
