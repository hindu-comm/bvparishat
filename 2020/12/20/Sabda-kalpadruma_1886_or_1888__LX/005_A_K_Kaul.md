Shri Marcis Gasuns,

Jai Shri Ram!

The latest edition of Shabda Kalpadruma as a hardcopy was published by Nag Publishers, Delhi, in 1987 and there were subsequent reprints.

It was subsidized by Rashtriya Sanskrit Samsthan, New Delhi and I bought a copy from them in 2005.

Vempti Kutumba Shastri, theChancellor of that "samsthan" has given all the details about its publishing history.

A scan of the same besides that of the publication details are attached. Also attached is a photograph of its "side-view".

Hope these details serve your purpose.

BTW, even the Shabdakalpadruma has advised that Makara-Samkranti is nothing but Uttarayan and it has quoted all the authorities----including the Surya Siddhanta!---which "Vakya-Panchanga-makers" and even some of our "Dharmacharyas" claim to be niraayana!------- in support of its claim. (Attachment Shabda Kalpadruma)

But for our "Vedic astrologers" all such exhortations are an anathema for reasons not difficult to discern.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram! With regards and Jai Shri Ram!  

A K Kaul
