Dear Prof. Kannan,

I had the good luck both to see your message soon after you posted it, and to be able to immediately

listen to the audio. My deep appreciation to Dr. Meera and yourself for this recording (and the whole series,

though I have not yet heard them all) of exceptional quality, which I am sure will touch and bring true delight and

edification to very many.

With many thanks and all good wishes,

Harunaga Isaacson

  

PS A very small typing mistake, only in the Roman transliteration, which I noticed by chance in vs. 6: Śaṇmukho —> Ṣaṇmukho.
