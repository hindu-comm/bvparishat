नमस्ते

My understanding of this समास along with a small correction in the end (नतपरुडिषु = ?तपनरुडिषु)

क्रतुहर = destroyer of (Daksha's) sacrifice = Shiva

शिखरि = mountain

कन्तुक (कन्दुक) = ball

विहृति-उन्मुख = eager to play with

(Eager to play with the ball that is the mountain of Shiva - referring to Ravana's lifting of Mt. Kailasa)

जगत् - अरुन्तुद = causing pain to the world

जित-हरिदन्त-दन्तुर-उदन्त = conquered-end of the directions-marked by-exploit = जितैः हरिदन्तैः दन्तुर उदन्तो यस्य = one whose exploit is marked by the conquer of directions

दशवदन - Ravana

(So, till here the समास means: Ravana, who was eager to sport with the ball that is Mt. Kailasa, who caused agony to the world, and whose exploit is characterized by the conquer of the directions till their ends)

दमन-कुशल - adept at subduing (Ravana, described above)

दश-शत-भुज-नृपति = The king with a thousand arms (कार्तवीर्यार्जुन)

कुल - family (of कार्तवीर्यार्जुन)

रुधिर-झर - stream of blood (issuing from the members of कार्तवीर्यार्जुन's family)

भरित - filled with (the stream of blood)

पृथुतर - very vast

तटाक - lake

तर्पित - satisfied through तर्पण

पितृक - manes

भृगुपति - Lord of भृगुs - Parashurama

(Till here, the समास means - Parashurama, who satisfied his ancestors through the performance of तर्पण by means of a very vast lake that was filled with the stream of blood issuing from the family-members of the thousand-armed king, कार्तवीर्यार्जुन, who was adept at subduing the ten-headed Ravana - who was eager to sport with the ball that is the mountain of the destroyer of sacrifice, who caused agony to the world, and whose exploit is marked by the conquer of the directions till the ends.)

सुगति-विहति-कर = causing an obstacle to his (Parashurama's) well-being

नतपरुडिषु - (unable to make out the meaning of this group of words - seems like it is तपनरुडिषु, written wrongly with letters jumbled up) = ? arrow as bright as the sun

परिघ - bolt (bolt-like arrow)

So, the समास in its entirety means: You (Rama) whose arrow - bright like the sun - became a bolt to hinder the progress, towards well-being, of Parashurama, who delighted his ancestors by performing their final rites by means of a lake filled with the stream of blood issuing from the kith and kin of the king with a thousand arms - a king who defeated the ten-headed Ravana -whose (i.e., Ravana's) exploit is charecterized by the conquer of the ends of directions, who caused agony to the world, and who eagerly sported with the ball that is the mountain of Shiva!!
