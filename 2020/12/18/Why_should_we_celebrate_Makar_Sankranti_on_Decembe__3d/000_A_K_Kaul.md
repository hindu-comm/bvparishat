Respected members of Bharatiya Vidvat Parishad,

Jai Shri Ram!

Our religious as well as cultural life is governed by the Vedas, Puranas and Dharmashastras like the Manusmriti etc.

***No Makar Samkranti in the Vedas:***

As we do not find any mention of Mesha, Vrishabh etc. Rashis in any of the Vedas or the Vedangas including the Vedanga Jyotisha, does it mean that the Vedic seers never celebrated any Makar or Mesha etc. Samkrantis?

Yes,that is right! The Vedic seers never celebrated any "almighty" Lahiri Makar or Mesha etc.Sankrantis that we celebrate on January 15 and April 15 or so every year.

Then what are the bases of our present Makar, Mesha etc. Samkrantis, if not the Vedas and the Vedangas?

***It is the Panchama Veda:***

**Srimad Bhagavata**, isthe most favourite Purana of the entire Hindu community whether Vaishanavas or advaitins, orvishisht-adviatins and so on or even Aadi Shankara---in fact it is the Purana par excellence irrespective of our "orientation". The same Puranahas said in5/21/3-6

यन्मद्यगतोभगवान्स्तपतां पतिस्तपन् आतपेन त्रिलोकीं प्रतपत्यवभासयत्यात्मभासास एष उदगयन दक्षिणायन वैषुवत संज्ञाभिर्मान्द्यशैघ्र्य समानाभिर्गतिभिरारोहण अवरोहण समानस्थानेषु यथासवनं अभिपद्यमानो मकारदिषु राशिषु अहोरात्राणि दीर्घ ह्रस्व समानानि विधत्ते \|\|3\|\|

“Placed at the centre of the sky, the glorious sun, the lord of the luminaries, warms by its heat and illuminates by its light (all) the three worlds (heaven earth and the space lying between them). Coursing by slow, swift and regulated marches known by the names of Uttarayana (the northerly march from the equator to the summer solstice and back to the equator), Dakshinayana (the southerly march from the equator to the winter solstice and back to the equator) and the Vaishuvata (the march across the equator at the equinox) and rising higher (in the heavens) going down and taking a mean position whenever andwherever such positions are inevitable (under the divine law), the sun, while passing the zodiac, from Makara (Capricornus) onwards, lengthens the days while shortening the nights and vice verse and brings their duration on a par." (Gita Press translation)         

यदा मेष तुलयोर्वर्तते तदाहोरात्राणि समानानि भवन्ति यदा वृषभादिषु पञ्चसु च राशिषु चरति तदाहान्येव वर्धन्ते ह्रसति च मासि मास्येकैका घटिका रात्रिषु \|\|4\|

\|“Days and nights are equal during the sun’s transit through Aries (Mesha) and Libra (Tula); when the sun moves through the five signs, Taurus and the following, the days grow longer, while every month the nights become shorter by one ghatika (twenty-four minutes)”.

यदा वृश्चिकादिषु पञ्चसु वर्तते तदाहोरात्राणि विपर्ययाणि भवन्ति \|\|5\|\|यावद् दक्षिनायणमहानि वर्धन्ते यावदुदगयनं रात्रयः \|\|6\|\|

“When the sun moves through the five signs Scorpio and the rest, the lengths of the day and the night are reversed. From Uttarayana–Winter Solstice—(Makara Rashi) days go on increasing while the nights go on shortening but from Dakshinayana to Uttarayana, the process is reversed”. (Translation by K Ragunathan, Vigneshwar Publishing House, Madras/Bangalore).

***Makar etc. Samkrantis as per the Vishnu Purana:***

The next Purana which is equally favourite of all the Hindus irrespective of their caste, creed or sect, is the Vishnu Purana that is supposed to have been "narrated" by Maharshi Parashara, the father of Krishna Dwaipayana Vedavyasa! So let us see the definition of Makar etc. Samkrantis as per the same.

**The Vishnu Purana** 2/8/28-31. has said

अयनस्योत्तरस्यादौ मकरं याति भास्करः \| ततः कुम्भं च मीनं च राशेः राश्यन्तरं द्विज \|28\|त्रिष्वेतेषु अथ भुक्तेषु ततो वैषुवतीं गतिम् \| प्रयाति सविता कुर्वन् अहोरात्रं ततः समम् \|29\|ततो रात्रिः क्षयम् याति वर्धते अनुदिनं दिनम् \|30\| ततश्च मिथुनस्यान्ते परां काष्ठामुपागतः\| राशिं कर्कटम् प्राप्य कुरुते दक्षिणायनम् \|

“In the beginning of Uttarayana (Winter Solstice), the sun enters Makara Rashi (Capricorn) there from going to Kumbha and then Mina. After having passed through these three signs, it just gains vishuvati (equinoctial) speed resulting in the day and night being equal on Mesha. After that, nights start decreasing and the days increasing correspondingly daily. Then when the sun is in the end of Mithuna Rashi, i.e. when it is just at the verge of entering Karkata (Cancer), the day is the longest then as Dakshinayana (Summer Solstice) starts on that date”.

Maharshi Parashara has repeated the same thing again:

शरद्वसन्तयोर्मध्ये विषुवं तु विभाव्यते\| तुला मेष गते भानौ समरात्रिदिवं तु तत्\|\|67\|\| कर्कटावस्थिते भानौ दक्षिणायनमुच्य्ते \| उत्तरायणमप्युक्तं मकरस्थे दिवाकरे \|\| 68\|\|

“The Vishuvas (Vernal and AutumnalEquinoxes) take place in the midst of Vasanta and Sharat Ritus respectively. Thus days and nights are equal when the sun enters Mesha (Aries) and/or Tula (Libra). When the sun enters Karkata Rashi it is the start of Dakshinayana (Summer Solstice) – the longest day. And when the sun enters Makara, it is the start of Uttarayana (Winter Solstice) — when the day is the shortest.”

***All the commentators including Shridhara Swamin, confirm the above definitions of Makar etc. Samkrantis:***

There are eleven commentaries on the Srimad Bhagavata, including the one by Shridhara Swamin. Similarly, there is a commentary on the Vishnu Purana also by Shridhara Swamin.

None of these commentators has expressed any view contrary to the above translation. Even the founder of ISKCON, A. C. Bhakti Vedanta Swami Prabhupada has dittoed the same explanation that days and nights are equal on Mesha and Tula Samkrantis; days are shortest on Makar Samkranti and longest on Karkata Samkranti! (Attachment ISKCON-BHAGAVATA RASHIS)

***So what are these Makar etc Sankrantis?***

Whether it isMaharshi Parashara or Vedavyasa, or the commentator Shridhara Swamin or ISKCON or Gita Press, all have laid down the following criteria:

1 Makar Samkranti = shortest day of the year = Uttarayana (Winter Solstice)---when the sun turns north.

2\. Mesha Samkranti = day and night are equal =Vishuva = Vernal Equinox (When the sun has zero declination)

3\. Karkata Samkranti = longest day of the year = Dakshinayana i.e Summer Solstice. ---when the sun starts turning south.

4.Tula Samkranti = day and night are equal = Sharat Sampaat i.e. Autumn Equinox.

***Vedic Uttarayana is Makar Samkranti and so on:***  

So we have seen that Makar Sankranti is nothing but a synonym of Uttarayan of the Vedas and the Vedangas, Mesha Sankranti just a synonyms of the Vedic Vishuva, Karata Sankranti another name of Vedic Dakshinayana and Tula Sankranti just another name of the Vedic Sharat Sampat!

***Shaiva Acharyas also advise similar Makar etc. Samkrantis:***  
It is not only Vaishnavites that celebrate (actually should celebrate!) Makar etc..Samkrantis in the above manner but even the well known Shaivacharya Abhinavgupta has in his Tantraloka correlated the two solstices and equinoxes with Makara, Karkata, Mesha and Tula Samkrantis respectively in his yogic kriyas as will be evident from the attachments TAI1 and TAI2.

***Let us get down to brass-tacks:***

As per the two attachments Delhi-sunrise-sunset-dinmaam and Greenwich-sunrise-sunset-dinmaan, we find that whether it is New Delhi in India or Greenwich in England, the day is the shortest on December 21, 2020---which is thus Makar Samkanti-cum-Uttarayana; days are equal to nights on March 21, 2021 which is thus Mesha Samkranti,--Vishuva-- day is the longest on June 21, 2021 which is thus Karkata Samkranti---Dakshinayana---, and day is again equal to night on September 23, 2021, which is therefore Tula Samkranti---Sharat Sampaat and so on!

We also find that in both the cases, days and nights go on following the pattern in the respective months/Rashis as advised in the Shrimad Bhagawata, Vishnu Purana or by the one and only Acharya Abhinavgupta!  
***Are these months (so called) Sayana or (so called) nirayana?***

It is immaterial whether we call such phenomena as sayana or nirayaana but what is material is that they are related to the seasons---exactly as is done by the Vedas and the Puranas and siddhantas!!

***Bhagwan Krishna is all praise for Vishvas and Ayanas:***

As per the attachment Mahabharata Vishuva, Bhagwan Krishna has declared in unequivocal terms that Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh join their heads together at the time of highly auspicious Vishhvas (and Ayanas) to review the situation prevailing in the world.  
****

***Thus thecalendar has to be reformed!***

All these are actually in accordance with the "Reformed Hindu Panchang" of Shri T V Sivaraman from Chennaiwhich anybody can download from<https://www.mediafire.com/file/2jxymb6u7yct86a/2021-22+RHP+calendar.pdf/file>.  
Its Hindi and Malayalam versions will be uploaded to the same address as soon as they are received from ShriDarshaneya Lokesh and Shri K M Rajan respectively.

***Astronomical proofs of Makar Samkranti=Uttarayana etc.***

The below details about declination etc. have been copied from the JPL Horizons to vindicate the Vedic statements about Uttarayana etc. in the following manner:

1. Makar-Samkranti-2020---details as to how the declination of the sun is maximum South at the time the longitude of the sun is 270 degrees and then starts decreasing!---hence Uttarayan-cum-Makar-Samkranti!

***"Almighty" Lahiri etc. Makara, Mesha etc. Samkrantis are really niraadhaar!***

What is also to be borne in mind is that these phenomena will not repeat themselves during the entire year i.e. there will be only one shortest day of the year and so on. Thus the Mesha etc. Samkrantis that we are celebrating after 24 days of the actual phenomena, which we call euphemistically niraayana are really niraadhaar!

They have no sanction-----neither from any shastras nor any siddhanta nor modern astronomy!

***God helps those who help themselves:***

We should not wait for Pujya dharmacharyas to streamline the derailed Vedic calendar. May be they have their own limitations. Or may be they have a feeling that if they declare that the present "almighty" Lahiri calendar is wrong then they may be asked as to why they kept silent for such a long time.

So we should not wait for them but start celebrating festivals on correct days.

शुभस्य शीघ्रम् !

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!
