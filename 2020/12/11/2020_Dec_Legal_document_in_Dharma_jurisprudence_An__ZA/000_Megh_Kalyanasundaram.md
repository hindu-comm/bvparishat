Namaste,

  

***Request***: If anyone reading this note knows for sure that NIAS (*National Institute of Advanced Studies*) has planned a lecture series titled*Sanskrit Language and its Traditions: A Journey through its History and Contemporaneity*in 2021 (20 Jan - 28 Apr) \[I don't see it here: <https://www.nias.res.in/calendar/forthcoming>\] and would consider letting me know, if so, I would appreciatethat. Thank you in advance.üôè 

  

I received a flyer (included at the end of this note) earlier today and if that is accurate, it appears that the series includes, amongstothers, Dr. Dominik Wujastyk, Dr. Patrick Olivelle, Dr. Richard Salomon, Dr. Mark McMclish and also includes a theme *Hinduism and the History of Dharma≈õƒÅstra*!

  

Also,*[‚ÄòLegal document‚Äô in Dharma jurisprudence: An analysis of the early chronology of 'lekhya' in 'A New History of Dharma≈õƒÅstra' and 'A Treatise on Dharma'](https://www.academia.edu/44681929/_Legal_document_in_Dharma_jurisprudence_An_analysis_of_the_early_chronology_of_lekhya_in_A_New_History_of_Dharma%C5%9B%C4%81stra_and_A_Treatise_on_Dharma)*(2020 Dec)
