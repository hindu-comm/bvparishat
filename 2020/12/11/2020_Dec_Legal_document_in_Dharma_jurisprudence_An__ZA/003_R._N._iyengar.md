Dear Megh,

Two more posts have appeared on this topic and hence I changed the subject line. I empathize with Dr.Bijoy Mishra and of course with your concerns. As a practising Hindu, why would I like to hear sermons about history of Hinduism & Dharma that too from a non-practitioner? So is the case with Ayurveda which is of day to day relevance not just for Hindus but others also. If some old book says that Brahmin Vaidyas should not carry out surgery because it is not 'dharmic' what is its contemporary relevance? The talks are all typically **Indology** with no specific topics on**Contemporaneity**. This is not to devalue the efforts of the "Consciousness Studies Program" of NIAS. Perhaps they have consciously worked out the Lectures to be so. At least Shankar Rajaraman could give a talk picturing how his brain or mind or consciousness does parallel processing during his Avadhana sessions.

As an aside:

You wrote; *Patrick Olivelle\[1\], who has been hailed by Dominik Wujastyk\[2\] as “...the world's leading authority on the history of Indian dharma”\[3\].* This made me recollect the article "The Disease of Indology" by H. Tull (Numen, 1991).

Thanks for your provoking posts!
