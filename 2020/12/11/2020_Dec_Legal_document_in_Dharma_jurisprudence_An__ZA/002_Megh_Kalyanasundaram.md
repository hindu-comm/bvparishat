Dr. Misra,

  

If I am not mistaken, I can fathom some of the spirit of your suggestion and I think I understand it, given, perhaps, some of the larger context.

That said, protesting, particularly on only grounds of nativity (I am not saying you implied so but just making myself clear), and in this case, does not resonate with me.

I *try to* stay open to learning from wherever I can, and without needing to either fully agree or fully disagree, I have learnt much from the work of scholar-professionals such as James Clackson, Jeffrey Long, David Frawley (to name only a few).  

It would have perhaps hardly mattered if Dr. Amba Kulkarni was Indian or not (of course I am glad she is :)) but from what little I have seen of her work, I really do look forward to herlectures in the upcoming NIAS lecture series.

All this said, and I appreciate the indulgence thus far, I happened to have read some of the work (as many others may have done so too) of some of the scholars in this lecture series and have [written some specific, pointed, critical responses](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/ZAZgQG20TFc/m/u8pCJhZTCAAJ)that are publicly accessible.

Amongst the things that I hope for (not for myself) is the opportunity for systematic respectful academic *engagement* and a level-playing field.

This lecture series, of course, need not be the solution to that *engagement*issue though.

  

Best,

Megh
