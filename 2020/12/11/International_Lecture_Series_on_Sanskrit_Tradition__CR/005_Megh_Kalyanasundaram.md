Namaste Dr. Misra,

  

A "why" in this [note](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/ZAZgQG20TFc/m/32Oik1JVCAAJ) of yours did make me think. Perhaps only the organisers can fully answer that, though.

  

If, however, part of the objective (by design or otherwise) is to—amidst a diverse range of topics—allow for thesocialization of new hypotheses that substantially impact (that is, post-date) the chronology of the origin of the*Dharmaśāstra* genre and of the *Arthaśāstra*text attributed to*Viṣṇugupta,* then at least I am not aware of 'local' scholars who have published such 'original' hypotheses. It is, of course, possible that the lectures related to the above points may eventually simply not cover those points, or present them in a way where the shifts are not easily perceived, a perception which would, of course, also be a function also of what and how much the listener knows about those specific points. Let me hasten to add that a scholar's *body of work* is, by definition, a larger set than some points (a subset) in her/his work and that there might be significant value-addition in other subsets.

  

Sincerely,  
Megh
