Namaste Dr. Iyengar,

  

Subsequent to[this](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/ZAZgQG20TFc/m/YCGag1aWCAAJ)note of yours yesterday, and in following up on one of the leads you had included in it \[which I believe is[this](https://brill.com/view/journals/nu/38/1/article-p27_3.xml)one, and if so, thank you!\], I also ended up[revisiting a presentation](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/5-4Il5b-3w8/m/SyNmnlzLAwAJ)by Dr. Bagchee last month on[*Issues and Perspectives in Indology*](https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/iOf7vfJz7M4/m/_9yDg_VbBQAJ)*.*It may perhaps resonate with some.

  

I was reminded of a statement I read in a book titled*Indology - Past, Present and Future*(2002):

  

"...whereas there is lot of scope for Why-Indology. 'Why?' is indeed, central to all research." (Bhate 2002:9)

  

Surely "Why-Indology" cannot be unimportant (not in my book at least!) but it is fascinating, for me, to*also*see the kind of "why" questions addressed, for instance, in Dr. Adluri and Dr Bagchee's works.

  

Best,

Megh
