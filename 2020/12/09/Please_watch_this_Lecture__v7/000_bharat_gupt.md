Spirituality should be defined in Indian terms of practical sadhana of diverse kinds which are done, Manasa Vaacaa Karmanaa through rituals upheld by tradition. There should not be an interference by Western nations in name of spiritual reform. Same with human rights. Indian concept of Dharma envisages kalyanam well-being of all living creatures, birds, plants, animals and of coexistence between all beings. It is not anthropometric or even man-centered. It is a higher level of human rights than what is propounded by West. Human rights should NOT be used for economic and political leverage. Eg., If you don't want Indian carpets then you accuse India of using child labour. We are capable of implementing our Higher Human Rights or Dharma.
