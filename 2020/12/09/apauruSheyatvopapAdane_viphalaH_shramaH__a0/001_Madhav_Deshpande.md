Dear Vishwas Ji,

  

  Your comments remind me of an earlier time of these debates. When Lokmanya Tilak was a student at the Deccan College \[1870s\], he had two influential teachers, Shridhar Ganesh Jinsiwale and Keropant Chhatre.
Jinsiwale was an instructor in Sanskrit, and argued that the Vedas were in a form of language comprehensible to humans, and could not have existed prior to the existence of the humans. He claimed that the Vedas must be Pauruṣeya. Chhatre was professor of mathematics and astronomy and had noticed references to specific positions of Nakṣatras in the Veda. These two teachers inspired Tilak, who was both a Sanskritist and a mathematician, to look for astronomical indications in the Vedas to figure out the likely date of the composition of the Vedas. This resulted in Tilak's several works on the date of the Veda. Jinsiwale and Tilak were attacked severely by the upholders of the traditional Apauruṣeyatva. \[It just so happens that Shridhar Ganesh Jinsiwale was my great-great-grand-mother's brother.\]

  And of course, the Apaureṣeyatva theory was not only criticized by the Jains and Buddhists, it was also criticized by the Nyāya-Vaiśeṣikas, albeit on different grounds. In modern times, there is often an impression that the theory of Apaureṣeyatva was the only unchallenged traditional Hindu view. The history is somewhat different and varied.

 With best regards,
