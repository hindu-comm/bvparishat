PraNaamas to scholars,

  

 I hope at least some of you will enjoy reading the pages 344 to 354 of the attached book.

 It is a translation from original Hindi book.

  

 The section under concern starts with:

 "The purport of saying that the Vedas are apaurushe\`ya"  

 Comments from all scholars are welcome.

  

Regards
