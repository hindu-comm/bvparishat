The mImAmsakas do indeed make it a point to stress the drashTrtva as opposed to kartrtva of the Rshis, but there are other dArSanika ideas of apaurusheyatva that are different.  

  

Besides, there is a well known and often recited SAnti mantra where the Rshis are described three times as mantrakRt, so we should be aware of that.
