In 1853 and 1854 "The Dream of Ravan" was published anonymously in the *Dublin University Magazine* in two parts. It describes with high literary merit and deep philosophical import a dream had by Rāvaṇa, the ten-headed king of Laṅkā, in the midst of the events immortalized in the Rāmāyaṇa. It appears to be a partial translation and partial paraphrase of a Sanskrit original. In the four decades since I first read it, I have never been able to find its Sanskrit original, even in manuscript catalogues. After re-reading it recently, I began to wonder if the original is in Marathi rather than Sanskrit.

  

Besides quoting from texts that are written in Sanskrit, the Adhyātma Rāmāyaṇa and the Mahābhārata and the Bhāgavata, it also quotes from texts that are written in Marathi, the Jñāneśvarī (Dnyaneshvari) and the Viveka-sindhu. It also refers to Alandi and Paithana, contrasting the yogic or mystic schools associated with these two towns in Maharashtra. In a passing footnote it refers to the author of what is presumably this text as Dāsa: "Dasa, which signifies slave or devoted worshipper, is also the name of the author." (p. 166 of the 1895 reprint, or p. 64 of the digital).

  

The translation/paraphrase appears to be unfinished. Possibly more installments were intended to be published in the *Dublin University Magazine*, but none were. In any case, I would be glad to learn anything about the original text, which may be in Marathi.

  

A re-formatted digital copy of the 1895 reprint is attached. I do have in my files a photocopy of it as first printed in the *Dublin University Magazine*.
