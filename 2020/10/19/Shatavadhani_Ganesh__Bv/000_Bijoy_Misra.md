Friends,

Talents sprout in many ways, but they rarely concentrate.

Shatavadhani Ganesh is the exception. I had a chance to

hear him on the topic of musicology through the course on

Natyashastra offered by Prof Radhavallabh Tripathi last week.  

I could see in him the person fully endowed in scholarship  

and with the skills of performance. It was commented by  

the veteran dance teacher Dr Padma Subramayan that it  

is a treat to be a part of Shatavadhani performance.  

Late Richard Feynman in the scientific world is the only known

person to me who was a scholar and a performer. Lert many  

get inspired to blend scholarship to artistic expressions.

Interpreting art in mind is science.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra.
