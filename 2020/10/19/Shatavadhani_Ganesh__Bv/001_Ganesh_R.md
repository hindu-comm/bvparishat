Dear Sri. Mishaji,

  

Thanks alot for your generous appreciation. I am extremely beholden to your nice gesture.

  

Apartfrom me being a performer of the art of saahitya-avadhaanam, I have no other great talent as an artist. My sustained interest in music, dance, traditional theatre, painting and sculpture have inspired me to study their nature and appeal. This of course, is quite natural to my pursuits in poetry and poetics. The intrinsic nature of sanaatanadharma demands any serious practitioner of it to get acquainted with various arts and sciences that are inseparable aspects of the same. My humble endeavor in this direction has caught your kind attention and I am once again grateful to you.

  

I should also thank Prof. Radhavallabh Tripathi as he only provided an opportunity to share a few thoughts of mine in that workshop. Of course, Dr. Padma Subrahmanyam, naaTya personified, is always kind to me and her insights have shaped many of my thoughts on this subject. Hence she has to be thanked with gratitude.

  

With warm regards

  

Ganesh
