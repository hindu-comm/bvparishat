Dear Kushagra,

  

As late as the 11th c. AD, in theGotra-Pravara-Manjari of Purusottama-Pandita, it is written as still prevalent that the gotra-pravara system applies to brahman (arsheya) lineages only: the Baudhayana-Pravara-Adhyaya mentions that the (biological) descendants of the seven rishis plus Agastya as the eighth are called gotra: this is the arsha-gotra (pita-putra parampara). The conventional sense is used as laukika-gotra (guru-shishya parampara/which non-brahmans use). Over the centuries, during to social and cultural changes, various groups in India have adopted the gotra system, but the pravara system still applies only to brahman gotras. Purusottama-Pandita also adds that Ksatriyas (who employ kulapurohitas) use either the gotra of their kulapurohita, or use the generic template: Manava, Aila, Paururavasa (or: Pururava, Ila, Manu). Vaisyas, similarly, are to use the Vatsapri gotra. However, Purushottama Pandita also points out the Tandin school's opinion (which he seems to favor) that other than brahmans or kshatriyas with kulapurohits, the sarvasadharana usage should be Manava gotra, since (they say) we all are human beings and belong to the human gotra.

  

I hope this helps. :)
