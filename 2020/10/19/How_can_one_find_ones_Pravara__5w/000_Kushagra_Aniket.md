Dear Scholars,

  

I was recently informed that non-Brahmins also have Pravaras (प्रवर). However, nobody in my family has heard of it. They are only aware of Gotra. Therefore, I was wondering:

1.  Do otherDvijas also have Pravaras? 2.  If yes and if the knowledge of the Pravara is lost, is there a way
    for people to re-discover their Pravaras? I understand that given a
    Gotra, only a few combinations of Pravara are possible.

Thank you.

  

Best,

Kushagra
