Pranam Kannan Mahodaya,

  

Thank you for sharing. It is a pleasure to know that somebody is putting these much efforts into puppetry theatre, right from making wooden puppets, dressing, music, lighting, and much more.

All these to enliven the ancient art of puppetry and epic characters together!

  

Regards,

Sunil
