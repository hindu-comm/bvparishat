Namaste scholars,

My request is partly related and partly off topic.

  

I have heard name of Vachaspati Mishra as commentator on all 6 darshanas.

While I am aware about his wonderful commentaries on Nyaya, Sankhya, Yoga, Mimamsa and Vedanta; I am not aware about his commentaries or work on Vaisheshika system.

  

Can any of our esteemed member throw some light on his contribution to Vaisheshika philosophy?
