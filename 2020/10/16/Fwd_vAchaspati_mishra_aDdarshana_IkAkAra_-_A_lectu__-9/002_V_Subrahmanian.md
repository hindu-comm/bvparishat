Namaste

  

While I do not have an answer to yourquestion, here is what Vachaspati Misra says at the end of his commentary 'Bhamati':

To this, his commentator, Sri Amalananda, in his Kalpataru, says:

From the above we have this list:

  

1.   Vidhiviveka Tika - 'NyayakaNikaa'  
2.   Brahmasiddhi Vyakhya - 'Tattvasamiksha' 3.   A treatise on the BhaaTTa school of Mimamasa- 'Tattvabidnu' 4.   Nyaya vaartikatatparya tika - nyaya nibandha 5.   Sankhya - 'Tattva Kaumudi' 6.   On Patanjali sutra bhashya - 'Tattva (vai) sharadi' 7.    On Vedanta darshana - Bhamati.

The above list may not be exhaustive as Vachaspati Misra would have written something after the Bhamati.
