Related to this issue of writing books which are hard to understand, I should state, two of my favorite authors Sri K. S Varadachar and Sri Abhinava Ranganatha Parakala swami have written 2 books in sanskrit: Tattva MuktA KalApa: sarvankasA bhashya and GudArtha Samgraha in a very simple manner. However, only when other people read them, they will know whether this view of mine is true or false, since I am sort of biased and exposed to their way of thinking.
