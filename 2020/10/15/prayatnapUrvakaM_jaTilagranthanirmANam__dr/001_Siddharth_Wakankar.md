Sir,

  

This tendency of using hard and pedantic language continues in modern times also as is clear from the writings of many Sanskrit scholars,pandits etc.They unnecessarily use such a language as they seem to be used to it while reading it.

  

It is difficult to use simple language and easy to use difficult language.

  

I have no intention to hurt the feelings of the scholars.This is just an observation.
