Dear Madhavji,

  

What you say is ok.,but,why people use desideratives and difficult indeclinables like Nishchapracham etc.when simple alternatives are at hand and could be easily understood by everyone.

  

My only point is: why scholars use such difficult language.Is it to show their pedantry or parade their knowledge.

  

That's all.

  

Thanks and regards.
