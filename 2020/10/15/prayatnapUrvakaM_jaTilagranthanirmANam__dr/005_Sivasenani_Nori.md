Sirs

  

There seem to be two different issues here - language of Sastra and language of Sahitya. Hard and pedantic language in Sastra has been around for at least a couple of thousand years now, starting with the technical terms of Panini and Pingala (say, 'vrit') to terminology of Mimamsa (bhaavanaa, apoorva), Saankhya and Nyaya. Sri Harsha himself is an example (khaNDanakhaNDakhAdyam) and most famously in Navya Nyaya. The equivalent of Alankarasastra in English - Critical Theory, Russian Formalism, Deconstruction etc. - is sort of following the same trend. I also noticed that the Alaankaarikas who write in English (and other European languages like French) are aware of this fact (that their writing is difficult to understand) and actually seem to celebrate it.

  

Hard and pedantic language in Sahitya is another matter. For me, the epitome of this remains James Joyce and his 'stream of consciousness'. It seems that increasingly the poet's greatness is enhanced if the reader struggles to understand what is being said. In Sanskrit, we see the language of poetry becoming 'harder' after Kalidasa, may be reaching its peak in Sri Harsha. That said, Subandhu (author of Vasavadatta) with his "pratyaksharaSlesha" sort of combines both easy-to-understand and difficult-to-understand language in one sentence. The equivalent of 'stream of consciousness' in Sanskrit (only in terms of difficulty of understanding) is citrakavitvam and bandhakavitvam, the ekaaksharapadyas of Bharavi and Magha being stand out examples. This trend of verbal gymnastics continued and grew after Bharavi. A related but slightly different aspect (in that, it is still uttamakavitvam) is gUDhavya\~ngya, which is also 'hard'.
