Dear Siddhartha Ji,

  

  This is happening all around the world. The terminologies of talking about literature, art, linguistics etc. go on changing, and unless one keeps up with that changing terminology and the newly emerging branches of these fields, the more recent talks, articles and books become more and more difficult for older generations. At one such talk on literature, I was sitting in the audience with my senior colleague Professor Trautmann. After the first 15 minutes, Trautmann turned to me and said: "She is apparently speaking in English, but I need a translator." Our younger colleagues in the audience were totally at ease with this talk.
