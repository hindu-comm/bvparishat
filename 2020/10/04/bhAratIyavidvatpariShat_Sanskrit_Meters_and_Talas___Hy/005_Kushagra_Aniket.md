Yes, that would certainly be a greatproject. Moreover, we can just take ideas from the book and set our own Sanskrit compositions to music.

  

I recently sent a verse in the कुसुममञ्जरी meter, which is referred to in the book as शुद्धकामदा or विबुधवन्दिता. This is the meter of famous compositions such as गोपीगीतम् as well as हरिवरासनम्.

  

It is interesting to see that on page 10, the composition in कुसुममञ्जरी is set to Raga Pradeepak (Deepak?) and aChatusra Jati Tritala. As we know from folklore, Raga Deepak is a rareRaga and there is some debate regarding its structure.

  

An added benefit of relating Sanskrit meters to music Talas is that it may lead to the revival of numerous rare Talas. For instance, Talas of 11, 13, and 15 matras are rarelyheard in practice but they exist in theory.
