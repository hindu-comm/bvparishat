सर्वेभ्यो नमः।  

  

The question of relating Sanskrit meters to different Talas was earlier raised here. At that time, I did not have a good answer except to say that the Tala will be based on the matras of the meter.

  

I have subsequently discovered a rare book calledSaṅgitānusāra Chandomañjarī, written by certain musicians at the Gaikwad court. It is written in a strange form of Hindi, which may be a bit difficult to understand. I am attaching the book here.

  

In this book, the authors have ascribed various rare Talas in different Jaatis to Sanskrit meters,while taking Yati into account. Moreover, they have given full Raga and Tala notation for compositions in nearly 50 meters. Both Hindustani and Carnatic Ragas are used. As one can see, for पञ्चचामर, they have used एकताल, which is of 12 matras and corresponds to चौताल in Dhrupad. For Totaka, they have a composition inChatusra JatiTritala.

  

I believe that most Sanskrit poetry can be sung. I hope this will help Sanskrit poets in easily setting their compositions to music. May classical music also help in popularizing Sanskrit!
