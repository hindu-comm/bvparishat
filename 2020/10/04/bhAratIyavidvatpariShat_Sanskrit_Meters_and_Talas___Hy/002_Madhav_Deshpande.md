Dear Kushagra Ji,

  

   It is a nice book in a form of spoken Hindustani written down before Hindi writing was standardized. There were numerous such publications in Marathi from the period of 1830 onwards when the book printing began in Maharashtra, but Marathi writing was not yet standardized. Thanks for sharing.
