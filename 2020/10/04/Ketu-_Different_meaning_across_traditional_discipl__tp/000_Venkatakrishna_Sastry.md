Namaste  
  
Request scholars deliberation and input on why ' Ketu' means different  
things across different traditional disciplines ?  
  
The meaning of ' Ketu' occuring in a veda-mantra, used in graha-yajna to  
appease ' graha-devataa' has different ' grammar meaning' leaning towards '  
vedanta- life style'.  
  
Image below is from Bhattoji Dikshitas work. Bhattoji dikshita is well known  
grammarian who wrote Siddhanta Kaumudi as a reorganization ofAshtaadhyayi.  
My notes on the iamge placed.
