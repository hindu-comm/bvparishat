Dear Sh. Narayan Prasad Ji

  

Does Bhoja have any need for the अट् *pratyāhāra*in his grammar? Pāṇini uses it in the rule शश्छोऽटि. So for the अट्*pratyāhāra*, he has to have हयवरट् and लण्. Of course we have the*vārttika* छत्वममीति वक्तव्यम् as per which the rule needs to be formulated with the अम् *pratyāhāra* and not the अट्*pratyāhāra*. If we accept the*vārttika* (Patañjali does not contradict it), then we do not need the अट्*pratyāhāra* and we can do away with the *anubandha* ट् and simply have हयवरलण्. Probably this was Bhoja's thinking?

  

Anyway I am sure Dr. Pieterson's analysis holds good for the *pratyāhāra*s used by Pāṇini, including अट्.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
