Dear All,

  

Would someone happen to have scanned copies of the following manuscript catalogues by any chance:

  

--*Descriptive Catalogue of Raj Manuscripts Preserved in Kameshwar Singh Sanskrit University Darbhanga*, by B.R. Sharma, Darbhanga 1969.

  

--*Vivaraṇātmak Hastalekha Grantha Sūcī (Kameshwara Singh Sanskrit University)*, Darbhanga 1986.

  

I should be grateful if you can share them with me. Thanks in advance and best wishes.

  

Mrinal Kaul
