Dear All,

  

Are there any ready made tools available for producing bilingual texts with Sanskrit and another language in facing pages? This is for translated texts where paragraphs need to line up.

  

Ideally I would like this for MS Word or another popular word processor on the Mac OS.  

  

If this has already been discussed, please point me to the appropriate links in the archives.  

  

Thanks and Regards,

  

Srini
