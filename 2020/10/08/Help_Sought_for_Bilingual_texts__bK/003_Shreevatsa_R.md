For what it's worth, though it doesn't count as "popular word processor", I was once able to hack together something passable (though imperfect) using tools from the TeX family -- I don't know whether it still works and whether there's something better now (I hope so!), but take a look at [this question](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/17417/how-can-i-typeset-parallel-lists-of-paragraphs-on-facing-pages)and (transitively) linked questions; in particular[this answer](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/240596/how-to-manually-typeset-text-in-parallel-on-facing-pages-in-lualatex/557349#557349) from a couple of months ago looks promising.
