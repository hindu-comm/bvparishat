Beautiful recitation and recording. Thanks for sharing. I am not sure why Veena is added in the background. Perhaps it is added to make it more pleasing and musical. I have not heard the entire videos, but I wonder if there is a discussion clarifying the differencesbetween the RV and the KYV traditions of recitation. I also have a question if a dominant Vedic Śākhā like the Taittirīya YV in many parts of South India affects the recitation of the other Vedas. On the whole, this is a wonderful project.
