I am not sure if this topic has come up before. A vedic recitation expert named Suresh has come up with a new mode of recitation which he calls suresha-paddhati. Here two experts from each veda recite the same Rk in both regular as well as gaNa form. For example 2 people recite the Rk gaNAnAntvA in the Rg and then 2 others in Yajur style. For people who are aware of the lakShaNa of both vedas, or even one of the vedas, this is a delightful experience.

One of the yajur reciters Brahmashri Satayanarayana Bhat is my teacher.
