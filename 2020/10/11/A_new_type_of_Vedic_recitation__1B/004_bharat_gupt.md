Dear Friends,

I found this 'novel' but puzzling. What is the prayojana of such a project?

To make samhita path and vikritis more popular? more acceptable?

The inclusion of sangeeta svaras as base/drone/ aadhaara shruti/ and the

vinaa which replaysthe 'vedic svaras', is problematic. The background

sound by the synthesizer obliterates the distinct nature of vedic svaras.

  

To mind, this is doing something forbidden by tradition. Namely mixing

laukika music (once called gaandharva, then called 'sangeet since 8th cent.).

with vedic path. (I have heard some others using the drone of taanpuuraor

shruti box with sama gaana also).

  

For thousands of years the two were kept distinct. No mix/mishra was allowed.

Why? Because the two are different. Vedic svaras are not the same as sa, ni, re

of laukika music. What is worse, by playing modern instruments of the tempered scale

which are western not Indian, you further dilute the vedic tone and specially the

voice timber (kaaku) and obliterate them under the pleasing (actually only familiar and

banal) veneer of every day music.

  

In my humble opinion, the frogs and the kokilas do not sing together. Desh and kaala

are different for each and so is the prayojana. Let the frogs keep the Vedic chants,

the kokilas have a huge space anyway. Let markets not obliterate them.

May be, I am a fanatic stickler for tradition.

  

with humble regards,

Bharat Gupt
