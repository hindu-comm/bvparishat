Shri Narayan Prasadji,

Jai Shri Ram!

\< It gives three different dates.> - of Shaka era

1\. There is a thorough discussion on "Unenability of Saka of 550 BC" by T S Kuppana Sastry in his "Collected Papers on Jyotisha" (Kendriya Sanskrit Vidyapeeth, Tirupati, 1989) and he has discarded any other starting date of Shaka Era except for 78 AD.

2\. Varahamihira has taken 78 AD as the start of Shaka Era for his Panchasiddhantika etc. astronomical works.

3\. Same is the case with all the other astronomical works of Brahma-gupta, Munjala, Bhaskaracharya-II and even Ganesha-Daivagya of Grahalaghava --16th century AD.

3\. Page 6 of "Alberuni's India" -- Part II, gives details of all the major eras that he had observed. He has given the dates vis-a-vis the year 400 of Yazdajird Era, which was 1031 of CE. On the basis of the same, he also has given the Shaka Era starting date as 78 AD, and that of Varahamihira as 505 AD.

It may be of interest to everybodythat Bhaskaracharya-II has clubbed Vikramaditya Era completely with Shaka era (of 78 AD) and has clarified that even Bhatotpala of of Shaka 888 was referringto the same Vikrami era, which was actually Shaka era of 78 AD.

And Bhatotpala had really done so!

That means Vikrama-Era is a later addition than Shaka-era!

There is also a very interesting discussion on Vikramaditya Era in the "Report of Calendar Reform Committee" -- pages 253-255. About Kanishka Era also, "the Report" says on page 253

Quote

The so called Kanishka Era is nothing but the old Shaka era with 200 omitted.

Unquote

KIndly see the three attachments.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
