Dear Scholars,  

   Namaste.

  

   I thought the start ofशक संवत् had been well established as78 AD. But today I wanted to check the exact reference and I came across the following paper:

  Robert Bracey: "The Date of Kanishka since 1960", Indian Historical Review, 2017, 44(1), 1-41

<https://www.academia.edu/32448882/The_Date_of_Kanishka_since_1960_Indian_Historical_Review_2017_44_1_1_41_>

  

  It gives three different dates.

  

  What is the latest finding?

  

  Thanks and regards

  Narayan Prasad
