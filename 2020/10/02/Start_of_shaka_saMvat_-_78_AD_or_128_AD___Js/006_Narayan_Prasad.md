Dear Shri Kaul ji,

    Namaste.

  

    \<\<The reckoning of the Shaka Era begins with the Vernal Equinox of 78 AD and is measured by expired years so that the year between the Vernal Equinox of 78 AD and 79 AD is zero of Shaka era.....

That yields 506 of CE by adding 78.\>\>  

  

    It appears that you are begging the question, i.e. you are assuming the validity of which is actually to be proved.

  

   There must be at least two different eras given at the same epoch. Then only one can prove something. For example, consider the AihoLe inscription that supplies at the same epoch the Kaliyugaadi samvat and the Shaka samvat.
