Dear Shri Narayan Prasadji,

Jai Shri Ram!

\< It appears that you are begging the question, i.e. you are assuming the validity of which is actually to be proved.>

Sometime back, there was a long discussion with a gentleman on the same question of Shaka Era in a different forum. He was of the view that the Shaka era had actually started in 550 BCE.

In fact, there are quite a few other scholars also who have a similar view and they have even proofs for the same! (Attachment Shaka=78 AD)

My simple reply to him was that irrespective of how many Shaka Eras there have been, we have to see as to which Shaka era was being used for astronomical purposes by Varahamihira and so on.

And that is what I had said in my below mail, "There is also other astronomical and circumstantial evidence which confirms 78 AD as the start of Shaka by VM."

It is not the case with Varahamihira alone but with all the other astronomers whether Bhatotpala or Munjal or Bhaskaracharya or Bhaskar-Yogi or  
Ganesha Daivagya and so on for whom Shaka started in 78 AD. Even Alberuni has confirmed the same!

We must not forget that Kalidasa of Jyotirvidabharna had claimed that he was one of the Navratnas during the "reign of Vikramaditya of 57 BCE" where Varahamihira also one of them! It was only S B Dikshit, who could prove that Kalidasa of Jyotirvidabharna was actually around in Shaka 1164. Even Dikshit has taken Shaka Samvat starting in 78 AD.

And as is clear from the Report of the CRC, the Vikramidtya Era itself was not known in India till 937 AD! That is what Bhatotpala and even Bhaskaracharya had confirmed when they had clubbed Vikramaditya era with the Shaka Era of 78 AD!

\<For example, consider the AihoLe inscription that supplies at the same epoch the Kaliyugaadi samvat and the Shaka samvat.>

Regarding "Aihole" (or "AihoLe") inscription, when even the Kali Era/Samvatsar itself is an "Astronomical Fiction" instead of "Astronomical Yuga" as per CRC (Attachment Kali-Era-is-fictitious-CRC) ) as per all the astronomical and scientific proofs, and which era is supposed to have "come into existence" only after "Aryabhata became 23 years old after 3600 years of the Kali Era", we cannot say anything about any other records vis-a-vis such an imaginary era!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
