Dear Shri Narayan Prasad ji,

Jai Shri Ram!

\< I do not understand this. Here 78 AD must have been derived one. \>

The CRC Report has discussed Shaka Era on page 255.  This is what it says

Quote

The Shaka Era is the era par excellence which has been used by Indian astronomers all over India in their calculations since the time of the astronomer Varaha Mihira (died 587 AD) and probably earlier. The Indian almanac-makers, even now use the Shaka era for calculations and then convert the calculations to their own systems. It is also called Shaka-Kala, Shaka-Bhupa-Kala, Shakendra-Kala, and Shalivahana Shaka and also the Shaka Samvat....The reckoning of the Shaka Era begins with the Vernal Equinox of 78 AD and is measured by expired years so that the year between the Vernal Equinox of 78 AD and 79 AD is zero of Shaka era.....

"But we are not yet sure about the origin of this era. It has been traced back to Shaka satraps of Ujjain, from the year 52 (AD 130) to the end of the dynasty about 395 AD. But in their own records, they merely record it as year so and so, but there is not the slightest doubt that the era used by them subsequently became known as the Shaka era"

\<Could you please explain how it is derived from the actual work of Varahamihira?\>

Varahamihir has talked about सप्ताश्वि वेद सँख्यम् शककालमपास्य as the epoch for Romaka and even PaulishaSiddhanta in his Pancha-siddhantika 1/8 which means 427 (अँकानाम् वामतो गतिः). That yields 506 of CE by adding 78.

VM has not said anywhere as to why he is using that era which means it must have been the era being used during his time at least for astronomical works.

All the later astronomers also have used the same Shaka era of 78 AD.

There is also other astronomical and circumstantial evidence which confirms 78 AD as the start of Shaka by VM.

Sphujidwaja is also supposed to have used the same Shaka era of 78 AD for his "Yavana Jatakam".  

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
