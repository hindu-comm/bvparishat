Dear Shri Narayan Prasadji,

Jai Shri Ram!

\<Any arbitrary but convenient epoch could be selected for astronomical calculations.

In case of modern astronomy also a Julian date is considered. The epoch considered for that as well is arbitrary.\>  

The more I try to understand the gamut of Indian eras, the more I am amused!

As yet, I have not been able to pinpoint even a single era, whether Kali Era or Vikrami or any otheras all these eras do not have any consistency and almost all of them"came into existence" much after the date of their "creation"! For example, the Kali"came into existence"after 3600 years of it had already elapsed! Same is the case with the Saptarshi Era, Yudishthira Era and so on. Vikrami Era was created after more than at least 800 years of the same had elapsed.
None of these eras had any astronomical bakground. Even the regnal eras did not survive for long!  

The CRC Report has discussed all these eras in detail!  

\<Whether the 78 AD is actually related to the historical Kanishka or not, it is immaterial regarding astronomical calculations. This is just a reference point.\>

Yes, you are right! But the one plusepoint that has been with the "astronomical Shaka era" is that it has been used consistently by all the astronomers of India! Bhatotpala and Bhaskaracharya-II have even tried to prove that it was known as Shaka Era because the Shakas were supposed to have been defeated by King Vikramidtya around that period!

Even Harry Falk has said in his paper "The Yuga of Sphujidwaja"

Quote

There is one last problem to solve: if the Saka era is not identical with the Kaniska era, how then  

did it originate and why did it last right into our time? It has often been stated that the Western  
Saka era is best associated with the Western Saka dynasty of Ujjain, particularly with Castana as  
the first firmly settled ruler of the dynasty himself? When looking for the beginning of the Indian  
year in 78 AD we find April 1, and this is truly a singular day: not only do sun and moonmeet

jointly in Aries, but with them is Jupiter, a very rare event indeed. From AI-Biruni we know  

that the Saka era was mainly used by astronomers. From later South Indian inscriptions we know  
that Jupiter years are often combined with a Saka date  
Therefore it seems highly probably that the Saka era is an astronomer's era, maybe once the  
starting point of yet another yuga, or of one of the Jupiter yuga systems•  
The rare event, useful for astronomers through many centuries to come, does much better explain  
why this era was kept alive in diverse circles than any reference to kings of foreign descent.

Though as per the CRC Report the Shaka era is supposed to have started from the day of Vernal Equinox of 78 AD, which was on March 22, 78, but who knows, may be it started actually on April 1, 78 AD as that was a New Moon day after the VE, and later it switched over the VE.

That is exactly what had happened with the Julian calendar---Soseigenes had advised to start it on (Mean) New Moon's Day after the Winter Solstice in 46 BC, (exactly what the Vedanga Jyotisha had advised!) but later it continued to be celebrated as a New Year's Day neither on the New Moon after Winter Solstice nor on the Winter Solstice Day itself---but just Janjury 1. The Shaka Era has at least the starting point as the Vernal EQuinox of 78 AD.

\<My query put to you was not regarding the historical event. All I wanted to know from you was: how do you arrive at the year 78 AD as the starting year of  the Shaka era from different Indian astronomical works?\>

1. VM had claimed in Pancha-Siddhantika 1/8 that the "Paulisha Siddhanta" epoch started from Chaitra Shukla Pratipat of Shaka 427, which was a Soma-Divasa. It could have happened only in 505 AD. Pl. see attachment (Somadivasah).

2. In his BS in Brihaspati-Chara, VM has given the methodology of calculating "Barhaspatya-Varsha". It has been demonstrated with an example as to how "the formula" is to be used after taking Shaka-abdas as starting from 78 AD. (Attachment)

3. Brahmagupta has made it very clear in his "Brahma-Sphuta-Siddhanta" that 3179 years had elapsed since Kali Era when the "Shakanta-kala" started. (Attachment Shaka-kalaref.BSS)

4. Munjal has given the mean longitudes of the sun and planets for the epoch of Chaitra Shukla pratipat of Shaka 854 which was March 8, 932 as per his "Laghumanasa" 1/1 and then in 1/5 he has advised to calculate one arc minute per year as "Ayana-Chalana corrections" from Shaka 444 to those mean longitudes. The calculations work only if Shaka 444 means 522 of CE.

5. Bhaskaryogi has written a commentary on the Brihat Samhita. He has said that in his time the Ayanamsha was already more than 11 degrees in his Shaka year 1150. Here also the zero Ayanamsha year has been taken as Sahaka 444 as suggested by Munjal. And that means the Shaka zero year was 78 AD.

I could go on providing further proofs but this mail will become much longer and not much purpose will be served.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!
