Dear Shri Kaul ji,  

   Namaste.

  

\<\<My simple reply to him was that irrespective of how many Shaka Eras there have been, we have to see as to which Shaka era was being used for astronomical purposes by Varahamihira and so on.\>\>

  

 Any arbitrary but convenient epoch could be selected for astronomical calculations.

  

 In case of modern astronomy also a Julian date is considered. The epoch considered for that as well is arbitrary.

  

 Whether the 78 AD is actually related to the historical Kanishka or not, it is immaterial regarding astronomical calculations. This is just a reference point.

 My query put to you was not regarding the historical event. All I wanted to know from you was: how do you arrive at the year 78 AD as the starting year of the Shaka era from different Indian astronomical works?

  

 So far as historical evidence regarding Kanishka is concerned, DrRoland Steiner has already mentioned three references.

 

 Best regards

 Narayan Prasad
