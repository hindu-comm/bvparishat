Dear Shri Kaul ji,

   Namaste.

   Thank you very much for your response to my query.

   

   \<\<Varahamihira has taken 78 AD as the start of Shaka Era for his Panchasiddhantika etc. astronomical works.>\>

  

   I do not understand this. Here 78 AD must have been derived one. Could you please explain how it is derived from the actual work of Varahamihira?

   Best regards

   Narayan Prasad
