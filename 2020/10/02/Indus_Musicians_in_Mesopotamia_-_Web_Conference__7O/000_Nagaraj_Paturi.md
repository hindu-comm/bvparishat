Needless to say, if Shail Vyas’s linguistic evidence of Sanskrit words being adopted and adapted into Sumerian finds confirmation and ultimate acceptance, it will be a major argument against the “pre-Aryan” nature of the Harappan civilization. However we need an objective assessment by Sumerian linguists — if at all objectivity is possible in this case.

A working paper gathering all the evidence is available here:
