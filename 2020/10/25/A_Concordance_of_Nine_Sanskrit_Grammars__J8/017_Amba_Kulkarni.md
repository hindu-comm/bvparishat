If you are referring to Prof. Palsule's concordance of Dhātuvṛttis, the one on our website is not the same as that of Palsule's.

Palsule'sconcordance has two parts, in the first part, meaning is not considered. And in the second, only meaning is considered.

Whereas, the concordance developed by my Student Dr. Shailaja, has both all the four dimensions - meaning, gaṇa, padī, and seṭa-aniṭa information at one place.
