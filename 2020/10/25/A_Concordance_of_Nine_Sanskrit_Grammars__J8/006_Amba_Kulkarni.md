Dear Narayan Prasad ji,

  

This is important work. This should be published.

At the same time, in this age of digitisation, I would also like to see it as an online concordance, similar to our concordance of Dhātupāṭhas.

If you need any digital space, I would be glad to host it on our University website under CC license or any other open license.

  

Best wishes,

Amba Kulkarni
