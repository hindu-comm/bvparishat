Salutations to the Parishad.

  

I want to announce one good news: Sanskrit Academy, Hyderabad agreed to publish this book, along with the sutrapathas of the nine Vyakaranas. Work will commence shortly.

  

Congratulations to both Sri Narayan Prasad and the Sanskrit Academy.

  

Regards

N Siva Senani
