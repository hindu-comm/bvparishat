Just as we see in Ayurveda and in lexicography and in the legal literature in India,

not to speak of other disciplines,  

newer modes and methods of presentation of the same stuff on the one hand,

and very novel approaches, analyses, and cultivations on the other  

were regularly attempted all through.

  

One or more of these five criteria characterised a good many of these attempts:  

*1.anya-tantra-samāharaṇa*

*2.saṅkśepa-karaṇa*

*3.pratisaṁskaraṇa*

*4.vargīkaraṇa*

*5.sampūrana.  
*

  

The prefatory verses of *Amara-kośa* hint at these.

And none perhaps forgot to add  

*śeṣaṁ tu jṅeyam śiṣṭa-prayogataḥ*

as did Amarasimha himself add.

  

The wondrous variety of usages recorded by Bhoja

perhaps singularly surpass all other grammarians (at least singly).

What started with Belvalkar ("*Systems* ")

has in a way found its culmination in this concordance  

devised by Narayan Prasad ji (NP).

  

Thanks not only to NP,

but also the *yojaka*-s wrt the publication.

Students and scholars of *vyākaraṇa* are going to be  

largely benefitted by this work.  

  

But one care needs necessarily to be taken:

to rid the work of of all typos.

It is not easy, but not impossible.

An *asahāya-śūra* that NP has proved himself so far to be,

this may not indeed be impossible.

Others possibly can assist him too.

  

Best,

KSKannan
