Thank you so much Dr Siva Senani for this good news.

I am grateful to the Sanskrit Academy, Hyderabad, for considering my work for publication.

Thanks to Dr Kalyansundaram and Prof. Deshpande for good wishes.

  

I hope, the publication of this work will facilitate more number of comparative studies for different systems of Sanskrit grammar.

Theसरस्वतीकण्ठाभरण of भोजदेव is the biggest Sanskrit grammar (has about 6480 sUtras) of the sUtra style. I am quite hopeful that this publication will attract more researchers. To my knowledge, so far only five researchers have done PhD on this grammar.

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
