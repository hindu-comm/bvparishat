Dear Narayana Prasad Ji,

  

  My first suggestion would be that you create a scanned copy of your handwritten work and keep multiple pdf copies \[perhaps some with your trusted friends\] for safe-keeping. Then you can create an Excel spreadsheet of all this information. Your sample page is already in that kind of a spreadsheet format. With best wishes,
