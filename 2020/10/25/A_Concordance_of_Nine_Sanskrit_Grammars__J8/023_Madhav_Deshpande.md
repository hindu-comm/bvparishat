Dear Narayana Prasad Ji,

  

  While Pāṇini's grammar has remained the main tradition of Sanskrit grammar, other grammars like Kātantra, Haima, etc. were widely studied in different parts of India as can be seen from the commentaries on these grammars. Multiple commentaries on the Cāndra grammar have been preserved in Tibet. Each of these grammars have shown some new thinking in the formation of grammar, new techniques and terminology, and occasionally usages not noted by Pāṇini. That shows how lively this tradition is throughout its history, and that it is not merely copying the same old stuff generation after generation. Like your appreciation of the Sarasvatīkaṇṭhābharaṇa, Nārāyaṇabhaṭṭa's Prakriyāsarvasva also needs some focused attention, especially as he is engaged in proposing some fresh linguistic thought in his Apāṇinīyapramāṇatā. Hope our next generation will find enough excitement in these studies. With best wishes,
