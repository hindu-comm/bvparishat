Sir,

 Thank you very much for the appreciation of my work.

  

\<\<Students and scholars of*vyākaraṇa*are going to belargely benefitted by this work.\>\>

  

I also hope, more no. of comparative studiesof different systems of Sanskrit grammar would come up and more and more research scholars would take up the so far almost neglected biggest Sanskrit grammar of the sutra style - the सरस्वतीकण्ठाभरण of भोजदेव.

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
