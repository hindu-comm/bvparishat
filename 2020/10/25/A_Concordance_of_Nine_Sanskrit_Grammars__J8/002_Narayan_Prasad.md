Thank you so much Dr Siva Senani for appreciation of my humble effort made about 24 years ago.

This work was considered necessary for doing research on theसरस्वतीकण्ठाभरण of भोजदेव. The research articles published based on this work are uploaded [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRUZOzbW06A5HFKKiYw64kj9TcYT_fH3eYVU32uDF--bjdKCMfRN8aPn6kuJv5j88Vcy5W6z5fibaOT/pub).

The सरस्वतीकण्ठाभरण-सूत्रपाठ is available [here](https://ashtadhyayi.com/ska/).  

I would be happy to get the work "A Concordance of Nine Sanskrit Grammars" published.

  

Thanks and regards

Narayan Prasad
