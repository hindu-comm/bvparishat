Dear Scholars,  
   Namaste.

  
   I prepared "A Concordance of Nine Sanskrit Grammars" in 1996 in which in the 9 columns I have kept the sUtra nos. respectively for (1) पाणिनि (2) भोज (सरस्वतीकण्ठाभरणम्) (3) कातन्त्र (4) चान्द्र (5) जैनेन्द्र (महावृत्ति) (6) जैनेन्द्र (शब्दार्णवचन्द्रिका) (7) शाकटायन (8) हैम (9) मलयगिरि. In case of पाणिनि, sUtra nos. are entered in the serial order from ch.1 to 8, and the corresponding parallel or equivalent sUtra nos. for the other systems of grammar are given.

  
   Since this work is related to a highly specialized subject, it is difficult to get it published. So I am planning to upload the manuscript on the internet. In this regard I would like to know the opinion of respected scholars.

  
   A list of references used and a sample page of the concordance are attached.

  
   Regards  
   Narayan Prasad
