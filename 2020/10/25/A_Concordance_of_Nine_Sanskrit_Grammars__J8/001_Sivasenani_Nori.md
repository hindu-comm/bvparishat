Sir

  

This is truly amazing. I prostrate before your scholarship. We know Hanuman ji as the knower of Navavyakarana. And now, we see your concordance.

  

This deserves to be published. If possible, with all the sutras also being replicated and extensive remarks and footnotes for explaining the scope of concordance.

  

Published properly, this can become a magnum opus, along with other great works such as The History of Dharmashastra and Vacaspatyam.

  

A prestigious institute like BORI, or a university would be a befitting publisher. I heard that Sanskrit Academy (which published Kasika) is looking for books to publish. Dr. Subrahmanyam (marked in cc) may be contacted to take this forward.

  

If nothing materialises, the Nori Narasimha Sastry Memorial Charitable Trust our family trust) would be glad to publish this.

  

Regards

N Siva Senani
