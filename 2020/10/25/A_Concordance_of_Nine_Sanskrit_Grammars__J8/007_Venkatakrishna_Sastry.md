Namaste Narayan Prasad ji



1. Congradulations for the completion of tedious work of going through nine sanskrit grammars, when people find it difficult to go through just one of them from cover to cover ! Your work will be useful for schoalrs in specialized area of Samskruth Research. I find use for this work, personally. Why were you holding this work since 1996 ? 



If you are not looking for ' economic gain from publication', then at least for 'sarasvati seva' you should make an e-publication of the same. E- publication will still carry your name as the ' researcher-author'.



2. As you have gone through these works, can you please help me to two
specific questions :



 (2-A): Is there a 'Common Definiitonal understanding across these works on what constitutes the characteristic feature of 'Samskrutham'?




 संस्कृतं - इत्यभिहितस्य -भाषायाः -लक्षणं किम् ? ( प्रकृति-प्रत्यय-प्रक्रिया- युक्तं पदं शास्त्रनियमेन क्रियते इति
सर्व-भाषा-सामान्यतां - विहाय)







 (2-B): How many of these grammarians ( apart from Panini, and Bhoja I know for certain) have made any plausible connection of Yoga with Language?



तत्र विशिष्य ’ वाग्योगः इति वेदे अभिहितस्य, वैदिक -छन्दसां सूक्तानां भाषायाः ( वैदिक- संस्कृतभाषा इति - यत् - अस्माभिः लौकिक-संस्कृतात् - भिन्नमिति निर्दिश्यते) तस्य वैदिक-भाषायाः योग-संप्रदायेन सम्बन्धः कीदृश? अस्ति चेत्, चिन्तितं, लिखितं चेत् ?



Your helpful guidance wth reference-pointers would be immensely helpful.



With Regards
