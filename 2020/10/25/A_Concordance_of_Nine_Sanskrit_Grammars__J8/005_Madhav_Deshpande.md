Dear Narayana Prasad Ji,

  

  This is an important work of yours and absolutely needs to be published. Have you approached the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan? Is it all in a hand-written form, or have you entered it into a digital form?
I hope you can enter it into a digital form before the hand-written material deteriorates. With best wishes,
