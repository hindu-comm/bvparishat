Dear Prof Amba Kulkarni,  

   Namaste

  

   \<\<This is important work. This should be published.\>\>

  

   Thanks for the appreciation of my work.

  

 \<\<At the same time, in this age of digitisation, I would also like to see it as an online concordance, similar to our concordance of Dhātupāṭhas.\>\>

  

 Of course, but this concordance was published in 1955 and might be out of copyright (I don't know). But "A Concordance of Nine Sanskrit Grammars" has not yet been published.

 Actually I am trying to get it published first. I would prefer to get at least a few printed copies.

  

 Regards

 Narayan Prasad
