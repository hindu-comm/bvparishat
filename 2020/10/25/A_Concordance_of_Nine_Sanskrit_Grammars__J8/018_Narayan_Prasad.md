Namaste Professor!  

  

\>If you are referring to Prof. Palsule's concordance of Dhātuvṛttis,

  

No. I meant Palsule's "A Concordance of Sanskrit Dhātupāthas (with Index of Meanings)" (1955)


<https://archive.org/search.php?query=Palsule%2C%20A%20Concordance%20of%20Sanskrit%20Dh%C4%81tup%C4%81thas>

  

\>the one on our website is not the same as that of Palsule's.

\>Palsule'sconcordance has two parts,

\>in the first part, meaning is not considered.

\>And in the second, only meaning is considered.

\>Whereas, the concordance developed by my Student Dr. Shailaja,

\>has both all the four dimensions - meaning, gaṇa, padī, and seṭa-aniṭa information at one place.

\>

  

 Thanks Prof. for the information. I was not aware of this.

  

 So far as my work is concerned, I do not bother about any monetary benefit out of it. But I have a desire to get at least a few copies in printed form. If it does not materialize, then I will decide what to do with it. So far as putting it on the internet is concerned, it's not a problem at all. Already I have put theसरस्वतीकण्ठाभरण-सूत्रपाठ (corrected by me) on the internet.
