As the sun was rising on this bright and clear Vijayadashami day, we performed our humble obeisance to the goddess of learning, reaffirming our commitment to continuous learning and to let in the light of knowledge to dispel the darkness of ignorance.

No palm-leaf "grantha" here. Just a few printed books. At the top is a book on satellite communication. It was the technology of satellite communication that transformed me from a young, raw graduate just out of school to a seasoned engineering professional. Although I continue to work in the field of electronics communication, it is no longer satellite communication.

  

तमसो मा ज्योतिर्गमय

Tamaso mā jyotirgamaya!

From darkness, lead me to light!
