A small addition as I reflect further Prof RNI: When I wrote "Amongst the things we were careful about is to not force conclusions where there might be none or where it might be prematureand hence your observation is well-received," I would like to add a qualificationthat, as I see it, that is readily applicable to part 2 of our paper, despite the quantum of evidence we have put together for an alternate hypothesis. Quite happy, though, with the conclusions of Part 1 of our paper, a part of which I see as you having remarked about, when you noted the point aboutBhārata-Nāṭyaśāstra.

  

Pranaam,

Megh
