Namaste,

  

*[The Concept of Bharatavarsha and Other Essays](https://www.amazon.in/Concept-Bharatavarsha-Other-Essays/dp/8178245477)*, published by Permanent Black in association with **Ashoka University,** appearsto be well-received in certaincircles, and enthusiastically referred to, in articles found in *The Wire*, by some Indian-origin professors based Canada (amongst others).

In the paper*['‘India that is Bharat…: One Country, Two Names’ and ‘The Concept of Bhāratavarṣa and Its Historiographical implications’: A response'](http://t.ly/6C0n)*(2020 Dec),**I have attempted to engagepointedly with some aspects of it.  

  

Best,

Megh

  

PS: There is perhaps something to be said, which I have not in the paperthough, about the choice of the image for Indian paperback version (included above) of a book that contains 'The concept of Bharatavarsha' in its title.
