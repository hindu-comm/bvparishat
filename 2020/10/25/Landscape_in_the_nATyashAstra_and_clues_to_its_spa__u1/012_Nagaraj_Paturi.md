\> Nationalism is good for the white man, but not for the brown people - this is a fact.  

  

----- Not just US. All the three competing political imperialisms are based on their respective nationalisms only, expanding their nation's controlover the other nations.

  

It is part of their imperialist / expansionist strategy to demonize the ideas of 'nation' 'nationalism' 'nation-state' in their prey nations because that is what comes in the way of their expansion.

  

Controlling nation deserves these ideas of nation, national pride etc., not the controllableone.

  

Those who propagate the ideas of 'nation is mithyaa' are either erstwhilesoldiers /sepoys of the World Communist Government movement or victims of self-hate psychological syndrome. These are the ones smilingly, gleefully looked at as the gullible elementsof the prey nations and used by the predator imperialists.
