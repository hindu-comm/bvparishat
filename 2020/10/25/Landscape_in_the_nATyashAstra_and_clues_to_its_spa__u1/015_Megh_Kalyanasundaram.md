The conclusion of the paper begins with this: “To state the obvious: more extensive multi-disciplinary effort might be required before anything final can be concluded about the spatial origin of the *Nāṭyaśāstra* text.” Amongst the things we were careful about is to not force conclusions where there might be none or where it might be prematureand hence your observation is well-received. We have foregrounded evidence for a new hypothesis and lets see if there is further addition to it.

"Bharata'sNāṭyaśāstra will remain asBhārata-Nāṭyaśāstra as you have rightly noted.": Thank you for noting this.

Good to know your view about this. As you may have observed, we have raised questions about it being translated so

Personally, I would agree that it would be injustice if that was thecase. The "...and for that matter, even in..." was included in greater reverence to BMC but the differentiation was perhaps too subtle. Maybe it could have been made less subtle and more explicit. "His is one of the goodbooks on ancient geography of India"Absolutely agree. Our limited point was that *Ns* landscape data seemed to have escaped his otherwise very comprehensive work to which I am indebted.
