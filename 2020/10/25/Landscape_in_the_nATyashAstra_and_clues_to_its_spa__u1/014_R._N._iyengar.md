Dear Megh, This is a provocative article (at least to me!) with no strong conclusions. Yes, more work is needed but the questions will most probably remain as they are; that is Bharata'sNāṭyaśāstra will remain asBhārata-Nāṭyaśāstra as you have rightly noted.

  

1.As an academic exercise one may look for the provenanceof BNS, but Bharata and/or his students could have put their collectively inclusive knowhow into the work which they refer as for example

I feel we should take the text as belonging to the *School of Bharata* rather than *authored by a person named Bharata and Bharata* alone.

  

2\. Priyangu and Nagapushpa: Both are well attested in other texts also. In the Vrddhagaargiya jyotisha (unedited manuscript), priyangu appears along with other cereals three times. For example:

The translation of the word as saffron would be wrong. Naagapushpam in general is mentioned as flowering in Vasanta Rtu along with a long list of other flowers. To decide that Bharata was a Kashmirian ( not that you have done so) would be just another opinion.

3\. I did not follow your objections to BC Law's book. His is one of the goodbooks on ancient geography of India. He discusses the name Bhaarata and how it has evolved out of Jambudvipa, Bharatavarsha etc with excellent textual and epigraphic evidence. The book may need revision taking into consideration what has been unearthed in 100 years; this is another issue. To mention him in the same breath as Habib *imho* is unjust.

4\. Present day geopolitical India, that is Bhaarat, as a Nation in the European sense has evolved out of the ideal Bhaarata of the puranas and other ancient texts. The unity in the ancient Bhaarata was cultural and Dharmic and not political in the modern sense. I recollect a Kannada inscription from the Kuntala region (present day north Karnataka, Maharashtra, and parts of AP) which starts by describing Bharatavarsha and then says Kuntala desha is a part of Bhaarata. But the Satavahanas, the various Chalukyas, kalingas, pallavas, cholas, hoysalas, fought among themselves, but without sacrificing the underlying Dharmic ( whatever that meant to them) link to their own past ancestors and founders (if they be called so) of Bharata Varsha. The AraNyaka forest-type ecosystem of such a Bhaarata sustains even now, but for outsiders interested in sightseeing or cutting a tree, or translating a book, it is difficult to empathise with inscriptions and the inherent societal unity built on legends, rituals, drama, dance and music.

5\. Last but not the least; even though absolute dating may not be possible, relatively speaking BNS may be later than Bhaasa. This issue has been discussed in the past (20th century as you may say) to a very limited extent. A detailed technical comparison between the two would give more insight into the issues involved.  

6\. BNS is a remarkable text with copious information far and wide outside what one generallyconsiders as fine arts. For understanding IKS (an abbreviation made popular by AICTE) before the Common Era that is *before week days and Raashis came into vogue*, BNS is indispensable.

  

Congratulations on your interest in BNS.

Best..
