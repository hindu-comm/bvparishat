Rishi ji

  

Jati resides in all vyaktis and is not destroyed till all vyaktis are destroyed. So even if one pot is destroyed, potness survives in other pots. The concept may be better understood by referring to the discussion in Nyayasutras from 2.2.61 (तदर्थे व्यक्ताकृतिजातिसन्निधावुपचारात्संशयः) to the end of the aahnika (समानप्रसवात्मिका जातिः। 2.2.71॥)

Senani
