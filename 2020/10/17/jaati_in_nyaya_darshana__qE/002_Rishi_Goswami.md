महोदय i read the sutras but the points discussed are weather jati vyakti and aakriti are padarthas or not, i understand Jati can be nitya with 1 pot breaking, but at a time when there is no pot, where will Jati stay, because it cant be Nirashraya.

  

my main doubt is about varnashrama, where"Jati shabd for varna is the same as Jaati used for Saamanya or different" i think it is different because Krishna uses Srishtam so does Purusha Sukta mention the word "ajaayata", hence it cannot be Saamanya.
