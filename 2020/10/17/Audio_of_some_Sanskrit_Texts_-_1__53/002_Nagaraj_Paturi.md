Sri Achyut-ji,

  

Please do not resort to such statements, which leave scope for people trying to know your credentials/elegibility to judge about the correct pronunciation of Sanskrit.

  

There was no claim that it was recitation.

  

Mantras are traditionally not to be sung. Slokas have no such proscription. Slokas are said to be suitable be sung in a
tantreelayasamanvita way. Interestingly the expression
tantreelayasamanvita is from Valmiki Ramayana from where the singing is being done.

  

South Indian is not the same as 'not correct'.

  

Your entry into the field of Sanskrit study is noted and appreciated. But that does not entitle you to such comments.
