Wonderful, and loved it. Thanks Dr. Kannan.

  

This is not a suggestion or correction, but a question. At around 2m47s in the video, I heard the word *kṛtajña* as *kṛtagya*. There are multiple variant pronunciations of*jñ* by Sanskrit speakers from various parts of the country. Is the*gya* pronunciation prevalent in the south? In the north the pronunciation of*jñ* as *gy*is nearly ubiquitous. There are exceptions like Baba Ramdev who pronounce it differently. **
