Thank you, Misra-ji for your kind remarks.

  

The pronunciation may not have come out very clearly owing to the speed.

But we are aware of the peculiar situation you mentioned

wrt the pronunciation of the particular syllable.

  

We will check with it again.

  

Thanks once again.

Regards

KSKannan
