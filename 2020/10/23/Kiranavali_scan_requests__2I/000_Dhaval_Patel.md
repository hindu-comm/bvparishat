Respected scholars,

I am looking for the scanned copies of the following works.

  

1\. Kiranavali of Udayanacharyya, with the commentary of Vardhamanopadhyaya, edited by Mahamahopadhyaya Shiva Chandra Sarvvabhouma, Asiatic Society

I have a scan from archive, which abruptly ends at 300th page.

  

2\. Any other translations / commentaries / subcommentaries except kiranavalibhaskara and kiranavalirahasyam would also be appreciated.

Dr. Dhaval Patel, I.A.S

Collector and District Magistrate, Surat
