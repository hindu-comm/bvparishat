Dear Professor Deshpande Ji,

  

Thank you. This is an interesting point. I investigated it a bit. It appears that this phenomenon of word breaks can be partly attributable to the following two reasons:

1.  In the पञ्चचामर meter, due to पदान्त-यति, sometimes such word
    splitting may take place within a foot. While singing, the
    opportunity for न्यास is typically on the गुरु letter. There are
    some examples in the शिवताण्डवस्तोत्र:  
    जटा-टवी-गल-ज्जल-प्रवा-हपा-वित-स्थले
    orजटाटवी-गलज्जल-प्रवाहपा-वितस्थले 2.  However, my verse is in चारुचामर, which is rarer thanपञ्चचामर. I
    don't see this meter in my copy of छन्दोमञ्जरी. In चारुचामर, the
    first letter is गुरु, requiring the reader to dwell on it for some
    time before proceeding with the rest of the foot. This may lead to
    the word-breaks that you have pointed out. I found only a couple
    examples of चारुचामर. An example that I foundfrom श्रीविश्वासो
    वासुकिजः-  
    पन्नगैश्च-पन्नगारिभि-श्च पूजि-तं वटं  
    यात्रिकात-पत्रभूत-बन्धुरं धु-रन्धरम्।  
    मन्दवेग-गन्धवाह-सङ्गतं प्र-मोदकं  
    नैकजीवि-शर्मणे दृ-ढव्रतं न-माम्यहम्॥

I have discovered that while singing this phenomenon is minimized. An example fromSri Radhika Ashtakam:

Best,
