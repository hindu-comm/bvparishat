Vasuki is my father - I am Vishvas. We use patronymics here. Naming conventions, like pronunciation variations, are good to know as well.  

  

In this context, I must note the telling fact that despite interacting with the maruvAtUla-s for 1k years and the shveta-mlecChas for 200 years we remain (for the most part) quite innocent about even the peculiar syllables of their languages (let alone their counter-religions). (Stark contrast with the Japanese.)

No. I mean to say what I wrote - v is labiodental. If you trust Wiki on this: "Dentolabial consonants are the articulatory opposite of labiodentals: They are pronounced by contacting lower teeth against the upper lip."

In the Sanskrit you espouse (based on your audios), you should write vAsuki only.
