Dear Achyut Ji,

  

Here is Bhartr̥hari's verse that I cited and its translation:

  

यदा किञ्चिज्ञोऽहं द्विप इव मदान्ध: समभवम्

तदा सर्वज्ञोऽस्मीत्यभवदवलिप्तं मम मन: ।

यदा किञ्चित्किञ्चिद् बुधजनसकाशादवगतम्

तदा मूर्खोऽस्मीति ज्वर इव मदो मे व्यपगत: ।।

"When I knew just a little bit, I became blind with pride like an elephant in rut. Thinking that I am omniscient, my mind became excessively arrogant. When I learned something from the learned people, realizing that I am a fool, my pride withered away like a fever."
