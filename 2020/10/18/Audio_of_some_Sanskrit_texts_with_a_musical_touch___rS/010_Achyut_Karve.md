Dear Vasukiji,

  

You mean to say that v is dentolabial and w is labial. The question is whether an English speaker can utter 'widwans' as 'विद्वान' by any approximation. Secondly is the 'व' in Sanskrit dentolabial or labial?

  

Is the spell of वासुकी vasuki or wasuki?

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
