Thank you Shri Nityanand ji and Achyut ji for the explanation on the pronunciation of v and w.

  

In English, v is labio-dental in that the lower lip and the tip of the upper teeth touch each other when pronouncing this sound. The English v is almost like a voiced version of f. When native English speakers pronounce v, I sometimes (but not always) hear it as f; "very" sometimes sounds like "ferry" to me because I am not a native English speaker. On the contrary, w is bilabial. The upper and lower lips touch each other and not the teeth. However, they touch each other only lightly; the lips are slightly brought forward and rounded when pronouncing English w.

  

In my view, the Indian "व" is neither an English v nor an English w. It definitely is not like English v but may be closer to English w, in that the lower lip does not touch the upper teeth. But it is not the same.
In my observation, the average Indian does not bring the lips forward or round them when pronouncing w. Also, it is not as voiced as the English w. The average Indian, not fully exposed to native English pronunciation, does not seem to distinguish English v and w.

  

So, it is not very relevant to say Indic "व" should be pronounced as v or w.

  

This is somewhat like the case of the soft, alveolar 'r' (ര ர) and the hard 'R' (റ ற) in Malayalam. The Malayali (even a five-year-old child) clearly distinguishes these sounds when speaking and when hearing. Word meanings change when one is substituted by the other. But in most other Indian languages this distinction is not maintained. I hear other Indian language speakers pronouncing "र" either way. Sometimes they pronounce "Rama" with the soft "r" and sometimes with the hard "R", and on many occasions with an "r" sound that is midway between the soft r and the hard 'R'.

  

Regards,
