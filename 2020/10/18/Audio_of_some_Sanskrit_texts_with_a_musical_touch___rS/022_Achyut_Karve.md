If one intends to go the Paninian way it is not very difficult to know whether 'v' is labial or dentolabial according to Panini. Just search for it in the Maheshwar Sutras.

  

'v' is read in the 5th Maheshwar Sutra. How will the articulation of the Sutra change if the 'v' in it is articulated first as labial and then as dentolabial? What will its effect be on the remaining letters of the 5th Sutra?

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
