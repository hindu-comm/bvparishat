v is a labiodental consonant (aka दन्तौष्ठ्य in sanskrit) - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labiodental_consonant#Dentolabial> / <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_labiodental_fricative> , whereas w is purely labial (औष्ठ्य) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiced_labio-velar_approximant> . Euro-americans easily notice the difference (with Indians and sometimes Germans providing amusement due to their inability to distinguish these). IIUC, the meccan demon Awrangzeb's name, properly pronounced has w.  

  

(shrI nAgarAj is wrong in declaring this question to be "off-scope". shixA-shAstra / phonetics very much has roots in bhAratIya-vidvattA, and it is stunted to confine it to the study of Sanskrit sounds.)
