Even with a cursory examination, in this example (the impressive vaidarbha rendition of saMvRtta अ and anunAsika yvl apart), one finds the below defects (I did not proceed further):  



\- At time 0:43 (साङ्ख्ययोगौ पृथग्बालाः प्रवदन्ति न पण्डिताः), instead of upadhmAnIya varNa, a regular visarga is recited (perhaps due to an extra virAma inserted for whatever reason). (Sadly, this is another poor "tradition" blemishes recitations in other regions even more - including Andhra and karNATaka). Not to mention the bad rendering of ओ instead of औ or च्च instead of च्छ shortly after or other tenuously distinguished mahAprANas.  
  
Of course I don't blame the reciter as mild errors given the overall superb quality and the apparently advanced age of the mouth parts involved. Just commenting on it being upheld as an supposedly better "example". Apart from that, the adjective "meaningful" is risible - the only "meaning" I derive from it are certain inferences about "dear Vidwans" commenter (who seemingly cannot distinguish w from v).
