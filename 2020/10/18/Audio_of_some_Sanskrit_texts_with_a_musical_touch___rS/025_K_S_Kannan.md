Am reminded of a joke  

(open to different interpretations perhaps).

  

A : There is a hole in your eye.

B : There is no hole in my eye.

A : There *is* a hole in your eye.

B : No, there is no hole in my eye.

A : There ***is*** a hole in your eye.

B : No, I have checked in the mirror, there is no hole in my eye.

A : There is a hole in your eye, *that's why* you can't see there is a hole in your eye.

(After a pause)

B : There is a hole in *your* eye.

A : No, there is no hole in my eye.

B : There *is* a hole in your eye.

A : No, there is a hole in *your* eye, that's why you see a hole in *my* eye!

  

Sigma.
