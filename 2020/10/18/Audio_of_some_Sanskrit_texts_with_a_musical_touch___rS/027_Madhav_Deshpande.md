This one is to follow Professor Kannan's line of thinking:

  

A says to B: "अन्धस्त्वमसि रे मित्र यतस्त्वं मां न पश्यसि ।"

  

B replies to A: "नाहमन्धस्त्त्वमेवान्ध: पश्यन्तं मां न पश्यसि ।।"

  

This is a Pune joke: Two deaf friends meet each other.

  

A to B: "Are you going to Tulashibag?"

  

B replies to A: "No, I am going to Tulashibag."

  

A says to B: "I see, I thought you were going to Tulashibag."
