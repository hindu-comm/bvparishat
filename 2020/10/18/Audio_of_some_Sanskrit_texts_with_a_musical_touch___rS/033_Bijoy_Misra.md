My entry into India Studies came through Yoga. I was stunned

with the lines

वृत्तयः पञ्चतय्यः क्लिष्टाऽक्लिष्टाः \|  

प्रमाणविपर्ययविकल्पनिद्रास्मृतयः \|\|  YS I.5, I.6

  

This was 1983. A Yogi had relocated from Andhra Pradesh and I was trying to

"exhibit" India in public places using him as an asset. Then came Patanjali.

The lines have bogged me ever since. The precision and the scientific understanding

must have been the product of hundreds of years of debates and analysis. Unlike the

gross features like वात पित्त and कफ, or the analytic features like सत्त्व रज and तम,

the mental conditions have to be analyzed by mind only. It cannot be done though

objects of study. The experimenter is the object of the study. The statement is so  

profound that it defies challenge. No instrumentation would ever succeed.  

  

The remedy most often invoked is to ignore it. But the beauty is that the line knows

that some would ignore. I love it, but can't wrap around it to understand it.

I just bow down to the great scientists whose names we would never know..

  

The discussion in the track provoked me to share these lines. While yoga

states them as temporary local states, they could be permanent mental states

of various categories of people. Lately we are discovering neural imprints to

define cognitive states in the brain.  

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
