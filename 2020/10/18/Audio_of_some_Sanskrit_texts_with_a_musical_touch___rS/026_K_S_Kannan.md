A member sought further elucidation.

I guess this quote will help:

  

"There are four kinds of people:

\(a\) He who knows not and knows not he knows not - he is a fool: shun him;

\(b\) He who knows not and knows he knows not - he is simple: teach him;  

\(c\) He who knows and knows not he knows - he is a asleep: wake him;  

\(d\) He who knows and knows he knows - he is wise: follow him."
