I am wary of plugging my piece on American political dynamics in response to Prof. Deshpande's carefully wrought observations on the nature of human political animals and consequences of believing in them, but I believe my piece countenances, in longish fashion, what he has so crisply been warning us of. My piece, here:<https://medium.com/@rameshrao_89399/democracies-discontents-american-voters-at-a-tipping-point-fb691d81b6a6>

  

Regards,

  

Ramesh Rao
