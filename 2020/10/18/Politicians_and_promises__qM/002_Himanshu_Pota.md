Dear Professor Rao,

  

Most people suspect that our elected representatives cheat us but you have pointed out how even those of claim to rescue us from the "system" cheat in more dishonest ways. At least the "white" politicians may get away only with some financial irregularities but the "colour" politics robs us of money and self-respect.

  

I am beginning to believe that a melting pot might be preferable to a salad with characterless vegetables.

  

Thanks for sharing your article.
