Dear Nitya and Nusta,

  

Extreme important work for giving a proper and meaningful name to one's own child.

  

We generally see a tendency to give a child a name which has no meaning or significance and then out of ignorance,it is either misspelt o mis.pronounced.

  

Your book,coming from the pen and pain of a first rate grammarian,will definitely serve a great purpose of giving a singinificant and Yathaartha name to a child.

  

No adequate words to express my gratitude for this yeoman's service.

  

Best of luck in all your future intellectual endeavors.
