A lot of people need such explanations of names. Otherwise some fanciful explanations develop. This is not limited to Indian American politicians, but this is quite widespread. I have heard explanations of the word गुरु as being composed of गु+रु, explanations of भारत as भा+र+त, and of course Kalidasa's folk-etymology of उमा as coming from उ+मा \[cf. उ मेति मात्रा तपसो निषिद्धा पश्चादुमाख्यां सुमुखी जगाम, Kumarasambhava\]. Yaska refers to etymology of सत्य given by शाकटायन as coming from unnatural components "अनन्वितेऽर्थेऽप्रादेशिके विकारे पदेभ्य: पदेतरार्धान् सञ्चस्कार शाकटायन: - एते: कारितं यकारादिं चान्तकरणमस्ते: शुद्धं सकारादिं च. The most extensive case of such interpretations is the five volume work of N.V. Thadani on the Mahabharata, where he interprets the text by assigning separate meanings to each syllable. V. S. Sukthankar has appropriately criticized this approach.
