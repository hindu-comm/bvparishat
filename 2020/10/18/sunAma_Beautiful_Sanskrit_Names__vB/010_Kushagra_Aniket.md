नामसंस्कारसिद्ध्यर्थं लोकेसुनाममालिनी।  
वर्धतां राजतां नित्यं सा नित्यानन्दभारती।।

  

This is one book that is desperately needed to guard against the "tsunami" of absurd and meaningless names that has swept us from India to the U.S.

  

This book is truly a service to dharma, since नामकरण is one of the primary samskaras of a Hindu's life. The critical importance of नामराशि is also recognized in Jyotish:

  

देशे ग्रामे गृहे युद्धे सेवायां व्यवहारके।  
नामराशेः प्रधानत्वं जन्मराशिं न चिन्तयेत्।।  

  

Many congratulations to Shri Misra Ji! Please inform us when this book becomes available on Amazon in the U.S., since I would like to request Columbia University Library to buy it for their collection.

  

A copy may also be gifted to the various Indian American politicians who have lately started explaining un-shastric meanings of names.

  

Best,

Kushagra
