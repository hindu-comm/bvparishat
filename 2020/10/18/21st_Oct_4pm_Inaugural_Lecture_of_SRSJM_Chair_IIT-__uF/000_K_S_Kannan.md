Dear All,  
  
Dr. P. Ramanujan has kindly agreed to deliver the Inaugural Lecture of the activities of  
the Sant Rajinder Singh Ji Maharaj Chair, Dept. of HSS, IIT-Madras,  
on Wednesday, the 21st October 2020,  
4 pm onwards.  
  
Dr. Ramanujam will give a lecture on  
**"Ancient Knowledge Enterprise"**  
based on Laksmipuram Srinivasacharya's Māna-Meya-Rahasya-Śloka-Vārttikam.  
  
THE TOPIC  
  
Structural and systemic help to understand the human communication process  
for better articulation/expression of intentions, results from an acquaintance with  
epistemological issues. Conversely, they may also be utilised for guessing  
purport and intentions of speakers removed in time, from their statements.  
Thus, consideration of aspects of ontology or classification of knowledge is  
beneficial to people working on human language processing in digital platforms.  
  
In the last century, Panditaratnam Laksmipuram Srinivasacharya,  
a renowned scholar of Samskritam from Mysore, put together  
many invaluable topics of ancient Indian intellectual enterprise  
in a highly technical treatise called
Māna-Meya-Rahasya-Śloka-Vārttikam.  
  
The talk aims to introduce some basics related to this topic.
