Thank you for sharing the preview, Professor Kannan; the pdf shared contains the synopsis of the book, the Foreword written by Nityānand Miśra-ji (which he shared in a thread on October 7), prefaces written by both the authors - Rajiv Malhotra and Satyanarayana Dasa Babji - and profiles of both authors. Attached below is the flyer with linksto order the book as well.

  

Warm regards,

Manogna
