> > "Recent studies of scholarly life in early modern India have > concentrated on the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. My essay has > two aims: to push this study into the long eighteenth century, and to > contextualise the new configurations of Sanskrit scholarship in the > movement of people between Banaras and Thanjavur, theorised here as > centres of gravity and of levity, respectively. Towards the end of the > seventeenth century, the Maharashtrian scholar Raghunātha Gaṇeśa > Navahasta moved from his post as temple priest at Chāphaḷ, in the > Sātārā district, down south to Thanjavur, to receive the patronage of > Queen Dīpābāī. At the behest of the queen, Raghunātha began writing in > Marathi instead of Sanskrit, in order to reach a wider audience. > Despite his elite education as a young man in Banaras, his Sanskrit > writing itself was likely accessible to the same audience that the > queen had envisioned. What were Raghunātha’s true aspirations, and how > did changes in his working conditions shape his career? In this essay, > I trace Raghunātha’s entrepreneurial spirit through his > Bhojanakutūhala, or Curiosities on Consumption. Although traditionally > the prerogative of cultural historians of food, the Bhojanakutūhala > reveals just as much about the intellectual context of its author as > he travelled from north to south. I conclude by comparing Raghunātha’s > career with that of his contemporary and namesake, Raghunātha > Paṇḍita." >
