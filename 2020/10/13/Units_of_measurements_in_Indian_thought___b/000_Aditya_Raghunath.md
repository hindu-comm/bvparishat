Pranaams Vidvaans,

We know that ancients philosophers/scientists used units like Yojana/Krosha for distance and the concept of Yuga/Kalpa can measure time in a big scale. Did the ancients also thought about similar units for measuring very small quantities of say distance/time. Is there any equivalence of nano-meter, nano-second in the scriptures.

  

Would be thankful to hear your thoughts.

  

Pranaams

Aditya
