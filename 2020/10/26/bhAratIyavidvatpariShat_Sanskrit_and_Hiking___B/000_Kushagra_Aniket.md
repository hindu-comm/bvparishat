From my hike in the Hudson Valley today:

  

नदीतीरे नीरे गिरिशिखरबिम्बं द्रुमवृते  
मदीयं वैक्लव्यं हरति नगरावासजनितम्।  
तरङ्गे दृष्ट्वाऽहं शरदनिलभङ्गच्छविमहो  
प्रतीक्षे साकाङ्क्षो मधुऋतुकटाक्षं वनभुवि॥  

  

On the tree-covered river-front, the reflection of hill-tops in the water expeditiously dissolves my fatigue that was caused by city-life. In the waves of the river, as I behold this image disrupted by the autumnal winds, I expectantly await the day when spring’s glance shall fall on the forest floor.
