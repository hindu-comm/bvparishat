Namaste,

Dear All,

could you help me to get this book:

# Subash C. Dash and T. Wada, A Navya-nyāya Discussion on the Meaning of the Negative Particle NaÑ: A Study of the Nañvādakārikā of Udayana

?

I need a hard or soft copy of the whole book or of its part only...

  

For now it is not available anywhere:

<https://www.abebooks.com/Navya-Nyaya-Discussion-Meaning-Negative-Particle-Nan/11932721843/bd>  

Kind regards,
