Thank you very much for sharing this valuable course by INDIC Academy.

Really the need of an hour, I do see many parents succumbing to the "WhiteHat Jr" (BYJU'S) advertisements endorsedby celebrities to make their child learn coding (computer programming) as young as 6 years.

No objections about learning coding, but was wondering without any proper vision of parents and much samskaras on kids, what would be the outcome of such a sudden rush (due to covid assisted online vocational learning) for code learning at this tender age?

Rather than promoting coding for so-called "logical thinking", why don't we have such courses based on our traditional learning?

And Finally it is here, thank you for such a wonderful course, definitely worth promoting as a prerequisite for whoever wants to opt for WhiteHat Jr. :)

  

@Srinivas ji, thanks for sharing the session link.

  

Regards,

Sunil
