Dear Satyan Sharma Ji,

  

शर्मा, वर्मा, गुप्तः, and दासः are the four surnames prescribed in various texts.

  

There seem to be two categories of दास-surname holders: bhaktas of various denominations (तुलसीदास, सूरदास, रामदास), particularly Vaishnavas, and persons belonging to certain communities.

  

There are various communities that retain the दास-surname. One community is the Dasas of Bengal and Odisha. Many of them belong to the eastern branch of the Kayasthas.  
  

Best,

Kushagra
