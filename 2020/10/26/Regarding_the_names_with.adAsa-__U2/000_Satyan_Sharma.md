Namaskāra

  

While reading the Manusmṛti with its commentaries, I came across examples of names for persons of various varṇas. In the commentary on 2.32, Medhātithi gives two examples of a Śūdra's name; Brāhmaṇadāsa and Devadāsa. Other commentators too say that it should end in 'dāsa'.

  

Was this tradition followed strictly enough? Do the names like Kālidāsa, Veṅkaṭadāsa (author of Vedāntakārikāvalī) etc. tell us about the probable varṇa of the person?

  

Regards
