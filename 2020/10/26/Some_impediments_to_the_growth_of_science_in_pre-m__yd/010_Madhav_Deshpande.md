In connection with orality and writing, I am attaching an article of mine regarding the creation, transmission and interpretation of Pāṇini's Aṣṭādhyāyī. Pāṇini's oral creation with use of nasal vowels and accents as markers of various functions was much too complicated for the early forms of Brāhmī and Kharoṣṭhī and the earliest written transmission of the text lost these features by the time of Kātyāyana and Patañjali.
This leads to the declarations in the Kāśikāvr̥tti: प्रतिज्ञानुनासिक्या: पाणिनीया: and प्रतिज्ञास्वरिता: पाणिनीया:. So at least in the case of the Pāṇinian grammar, the use of written transmission was more of a hindrance than advantage. The oral tradition was far more sophisticated. With best wishes,
