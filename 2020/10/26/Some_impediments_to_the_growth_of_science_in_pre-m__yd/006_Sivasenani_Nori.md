Sri Warrier

  

Namaste.

  

You make a very important point, especially in a group like this, where we usually focus on what was good and great about the past of India. It is equally important to know aspects where we were not good, as it would help us avoid the mistakes of the past. Military technology is one example. And we are still not building cutting edge military technology. For instance, can we build one crore drones to unleash on our enemies if the need arises?

  

Our late adoption of writing and writing technology (paper, printing etc.) should indeed be treated as an impediment.

  

That said, your observation does not take into consideration the fact that as an engineer you have spent nearly ten years learning the language of science, called mathematics. To someone not used to the notation of mathematics, an equation is more unintelligible than a sutra. So, clarity is not really a guna of modern mathematics.

  

The most powerful aspect of mathematics is the ability to capture the abstract from specifics and then build upon that. Here concision of expression is not so much an end by itself as a necessary means to higher knowledge.

  

Our ancients had the ability to think at the level of highest abstractness, Aryabhata himself being an exemplar, but the absence of a language like mathematics shows that either this was not fully developed or not spread sufficiently widely and so lost like the science of making rust-proof iron pillars.
