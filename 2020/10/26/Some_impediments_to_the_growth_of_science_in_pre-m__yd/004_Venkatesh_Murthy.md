Namaste  

  

Science and technology in the West contributed what. Automobiles caused pollution and unnecessary oil exploration and Middle East countries becoming rich without any hard work. Many Industries are polluting rivers, oceans and the air we breathe.

  
Airplanes were invented in the West. But now air travel has become the cause for spreading of Corona Virusfrom China tothe world.

  

Science in the West has caused developmentof Nuclear weapons capable of destroying the earth itself many times. Even now US and Russia are sitting on a large stock of nuclear weapons. If a terrrorist state like Iran gets a nuclear weapon they will not hesitate to start a nuclear war. The Earth can be destroyed any day in the coming future.

  

Western Medical Science has become dangerous also. They have invented many drugs with serious side effects. Food Industry is using many Cancer causing chemicals in everyday food we eat. Processed food has high sugar content making it very unhealthy. Agricultural Science has encouraged using pesticides dangerous to our health.  

  

Large international companies have one and only one goal of making money. They are exploiting the consumer and making the consumer addicted to buying newer and newer products. But the biggest loser is the education system. The Education system has become a puppet of the companies. They are teaching children and young adults only subjects to get them a fat salary job in a big company.

  

Now tell me what is the Good coming out of Western Science?
