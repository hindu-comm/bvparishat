Science and scientific thinking are two different topics. Scientific thinking involves

the process of inquiry. The fundamental discovery was that the universe is one and

all belong in one unit. This happened through philosophy and intuitive logic. It must

have taken hundreds of years to establish the logic and get it to popular understanding.

Hurting another is hurting oneself is not a slogan but science through this cosmology.

Then they got hung up on why people are different. A group Jainas tried morphing  

through mathematical operations and possible subjective assumptions, another group

tried to invoke continuity of life and redistribution. These became religious.  

The only basic science as accepted in the modern ways, was in the discovery of speech

syllables as a product of human anatomical features. Understanding of anatomy and  

how air might flow through the body has not been repeated by any one.
That speech

is a process and it is created every time we speak is a mammoth scientific discovery.

Though we credit Panini to articulate it, the process must have continued for thousands

of years with slow progress. We need to unravel.  

Speech science continued to the modulation of voice with emotion and musicality.

Such science as we call मात्रा and छन्द are equally profound.
Development might have

taken hundreds of years through experimentation and repetition.

This goes forward to the theory of mind and emotion. Then it goes into iconography etc.

I will stop here.  

My observation has been that Indians have been basic scientists and not engineers.

Scientists look for fundamental analysis and not local short-term solutions. Customization

of a product to suit a person was more important than mass production of uniformity. In  

such a style, progress is indeed slow. Sufficiency of food possibly created a reverence to

earth and a prohibition not to damage it. People thought that they could offer food to anyone,

but were unaware that people would come to take away their land.

Modern Indians are becoming good engineers but I think they would be happier as good

scientists. An engineer accepts sky as blue, a scientist explores why the sky is blue.

Charaka's enunciation that mental health is more important than physical health must

have gone through huge iterative analysis for thousands of years. The west is just

waking upto it! Science has its own time scale!
