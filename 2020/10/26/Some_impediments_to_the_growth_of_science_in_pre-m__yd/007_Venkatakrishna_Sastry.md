Namaste



1. I would request schoalrs debating on 'Science in pre-modern India' to take a look at the following video and see where the current research is heading.



<https://confcats-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/WCCI2020_Werbos_SessionIntro_Panel_Kozma.mp4> -

More specifically 9.31 where the slide uses ' Devanagari script, to explain six blind men and elephant cognition', alluding to (Dharma anchored but A-vaidik) Jainism.



#  I have a strong conviction that Panini Samskruth tradition has solutons to address Artificial General Intelligence theme, without needing prop models of ' Python, decatron, PyTorch and the like. ([facebookresearch](https://github.com/facebookresearch)/[maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark)). The research path needs to be an expansion of current models of computational linguisitcs.



2. What pre-modern India had or did not have is history.



 When the current generation has a different context and flow, with access to different set of tools, and clearly defined needs of socio-economic frame work, the action to shape the future-fitness is going to be a conscious-choice.

The path can be one of 'follow the others' by allowing
collaborated free offer to data-mine traditions ( an ongoing process for three plus decades) or ' invest-build-own' for 'atma-nirbharataa' as ' Indic base'.

 It is here the investors love and interest between ' ROI
for money ( धनागमाशा ) and Passion to save and groom
tradition ( शास्त्र-सम्प्रदाय रक्षा -वर्धनम्) ' gets separated
as 'Hamsa-Ksheera viveka'.





3. The question to ponder over : How can 'We the people of Samskruth' provide a 'Atma-nirbhar' solution from Panini -Patanjali-Yaska for Social Wellbeing with the given technology and shaping the future ?

How best can we use our own
Heritage resources to build and own Knowledge-Technology solutions ?



 ( It is all nice to sing the ' past glories of Supreme Divine and Langauge of Tradition', It is satisfying and emotionally fulfilling ; But would that shape the timely future strong enough to be sustainable and lead to light ? )
