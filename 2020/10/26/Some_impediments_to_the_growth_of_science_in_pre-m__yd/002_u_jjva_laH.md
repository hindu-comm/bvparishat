**अपि॑ च सङ्गणकय॒न्त्राणि॒ चेद् अभ॑विष्यन्। अथ॒ चेत् तानि॒ यन्त्रा॑णि [स्व॒यं प्र॒मेया॒ण्यपि॑ प्र॒त्यपा॑दयँ॒](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_theorem_proving)स्तद॑द्भु॒तमि॑वाभविष्यत्।**

And if calculators and computers were also available. And if they [automatically proved theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_theorem_proving), that would have been great.

  

**यद् नासी॒त् तन्नासी॑न् महोदय। अ॒श॒क्य॒त्वात्। कस्मा॒द् अश॑क्यम्? तत्र॒ ये हे॒तव॒स्तेषां॑ ब॒हवो॒ भव॑ता सा॒धु निरू॑पिता॒ अनु॑गृहीताश्च व॒यम्।**

What was not, was not, sir. For it was impossible. Why impossible? Because of the many reasons thankfully stated by you, and many others that are not mentioned.

  

**ए॒वम् अभ॑विष्य॒च्चेत् तथा॑भविष्य॒दित्या॑दीनि॒ वचां॑स्य॒नर्था॒नीत्या॑श॒यः। वि॒रो॒ध॒प्र॒ति॒पाद॑नार्थान्ये॒व तानि॑ प्रयोक्त॒व्या॑नि।**

If this would had been so, then that would had been such. Such statements are illogical, that's what I want to say. They should only be used to show contradiction.

  

**संस्कृ॒तेपि॒ यो लृ॑ङ्प्रयो॒गः स प्राकृ॑तेन पू॒र्व्यम् असि॑द्धम् अभिप्रा॒यं वक्तु॑म् अस्ति।**

Even in Sanskrit, the lṛṅ form was originally meant to describe unaccomplished intent.

  

**यो वृ॒त्राय॒ सिन॒म् अत्राभ॑रिष्य॒त् प्र तं जनि॑त्री वि॒दुष॑ उवाच। (ऋ॰ २.३०.२)**

To the one (Índra) who was about to bring provisions for vṛtrá, his mother (Áditi) said. (RV. 2.30.2)
