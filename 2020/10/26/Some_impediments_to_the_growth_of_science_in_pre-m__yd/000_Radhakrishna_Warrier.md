I believe that science in India would have progressed much faster if pre-modern India had convenient writing material like paper and pen with easy and wide availability. On the top of paper and pen, if printing were also available, I think science would have developed leaps and bounds as compared to its actual development in the absence of all these. The lack of these led to the following:

1.  The need to be very succinct in writing science
2.  A tradition to phrase these succinct explanations in verse
    embellished with metaphors, alaṅkāra-s etc., so that people could
    easily learn the matter by heart (hṛdistham) and remember and
    reproduce it when needed
3.  Above 1 and 2 preventing the development of crisp mathematical or
    scientific notations (say, like writing*a=* *4πr²* for the area of
    a circle) and the use of diagrams in explanations. All scientific
    and mathematical explanations needed to be done only with words
    bound by meters (vṛtta) of poetry 
4.  All the above resulting in clouding the meaning of what the original
    author intended and after the passage of time the matter becoming
    almost obscure. Bhāṣya-s, ṭīkā-s and what nots becoming essential
    for understanding the matter just a couple of generations after the
    original author



Take the case of āryabhaṭa who is one of the more straight-forward writers of scientific matter in ancient India.



āryabhaṭa in his āryabhaṭīya, pāda 4, Golapāda, verse 17, says:



रविवर्षार्धं देवाः पश्यन्त्युदितं रविं तथा प्रेताः । 

शशिमासार्धं पितरः शशिगाः कुदिनार्धमिह मनुजाः\|\| 



“*The gods see the Sun for six months after it has risen for half a solar year; so is done by the demons too. The manes living on (the other side of) the moon see the Sun for half a lunar month. The men here see it for half a civil day*.”



\[Aryabhatiya of Aryabhata with English translation & comments by Kripa Shankar Shukla
<https://archive.org/details/Aryabhatiya-with-English-commentary/Aryabhatiya-with-English-commentary/page/n199/mode/2up> \]



The gist of the verse is that it is half a year day and half a year night at the North and South Poles of the earth. Half a lunar month (roughly 14 earth days) day and the other half night on the Moon. And half day sun and half day night for us here on the earth.



To get this gist from the original verse, you must have some knowledge of the cultural milieu and the belief systems that Āryabhaṭa was part of. You must know that:



1.  There was a belief that the dēvas lived on the North Pole and the
    prētas (ghosts or demons) lived on the South Pole
2.  There was also a belief that the pitṛ (manes) lived on the moon on
    the far side (the side not visible from earth)
3.  It was customary in the days of Āryabhaṭa for science to be written
    in verse embellished with metaphors and other alaṅkāra



It would be almost impossible for an outsider to this cultural milieu and belief system to decipher what Āryabhaṭa is saying. Āryabhaṭaused the metaphors of dēva, prēta, pitṛ, etc., just so that people could later remember easily what he wrote.



Now come to Yuktibhāṣā and see how Jyēṣṭhadēva is explaining Mādhava’s derivation of the area of a sphere.



<https://archive.org/details/Yukthibhasha1948/page/n313/mode/2up>



He states the results as:



ഗോളവ്യാസത്തെ ഗോളപരിധിയെക്കൊണ്ടു ഗുണിച്ചാൽ ഗോളപൃഷ്ഠത്തിങ്കലെ ചതുരശ്രഫലമുണ്ടാകും



Gōḷavyāsatte gōḷaparidhiyekkoṇṭu guṇiccāl gōḷapṛṣṭhattiṅkale caturaśraphalam uṅṭākum.



If \[you\] multiply (*guṇiccāl*) the diameter of a sphere (*gōḷavyāsam*) with the perimeter of the sphere (*gōḷaparidhi*), \[you will\] obtain the area (*caturaśraphalam*) of the surface of the globe (*gōḷapṛṣṭham*).



He is saying that the product of the diameter and perimeter of a great circle of the sphere will yield its area (DxP = 2Rx2πR =4πR²). 



Jyēṣṭhadēva wrote in prose, so he did not need to fit his words within vṛtta and embellish the matter with metaphors, alliteration and alaṅkāra. He doesn’t normally use metaphors. He is very pratyakṣa priya, not parōkṣa priya, i.e., he is very straightforward. Obviously, he did not intend the reader to learn his explanations by heart. His explanations are detailed and crystal clear. It is like conversational Malayalam and easily understood even five centuries later. 



The problem comes when he is proving his statement through the principles of calculus, using infinitesimals and integration. He doesn’t have recourse to crisp mathematical notations. I studied this proof during my Pre-degree classes in less than one printed page.Jyēṣṭhadēva'sproof is exactly the same, buthis proof in modern printed form needs several printed pages. This is because he has to use words and words, in place of crisp mathematical notations and diagrams.Imagine how many palm-leaves he must have used for writing all this proof.
