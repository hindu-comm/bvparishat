NamasteRadhakrishna ji,

  

Would like to point out a couple corrections:

  

**1\\ On use of paper in pre-modern India**

*\>I believe that science in India would have progressed much faster if pre-modern India had convenient writing material like paper and pen with easy and wide availability*

  

But we know that pre-modern India did indeed have paper and pen with easy and wide availability!

There are many sources of evidence for this. One of my first was the "Goiten papers" - letters of business correspondences from 12th century. Paper is listed as one of the major imports from India to Europe. FromGoitein, S. D., & Friedman, M. (2007).*India Traders of the Middle Ages: Documents from the Cairo Geniza'India Book'*. Brill. pp18

A Rahman's "[Paper technology in medieval India](https://insa.nic.in/writereaddata/UpLoadedFiles/IJHS/Vol01_2_7_SAKGhori.pdf)" is a good summary.  

  

Looks like paper & pens were extensively used for business documents, and other uses of relatively temporary nature. For books and technical publication which were expected to last for a very long time in Indian weather - more permanent media like palm or bhurja leaves were used.After about 17th century paper is seen to be extensively used in North India for books and technical publication as well.

  

**2\\ On diagrams in pre-modern India**

*\>This is because he has to use words and words, in place of crisp mathematical notations and diagrams.*

  

Just FYI.. Diagramswere indeedpart of pre-modern Indian scholarship. Extensively used in गणितं, वास्तु & ज्यौतिषं publications. Attached are a few diagrams from a few random pre-modern scientific texts. (bear with me - they are unclear photographs of micro-film negatives).
