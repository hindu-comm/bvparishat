Since the thread initiating post talks about absence of writing as an impediment, I thought it might be useful to bring to the notice of our members that these issues of advantages and disadvantages of presence and absence of writing in different world societies is already rigorously theoretically discussed under the categories of " Orality and Literacy " .

  

Looking at writing / literacy as 'progress' and absence of the same as backwardness is part of what is called as 'literate consciousness' structured by writing.

Members might be interested in reading the book,  

  

Orality and Literacy : The Technologizing of the Word

  

by

  

Walter J Ong

  

The book does not specifically cover the premodern Indian situation as that of a predominantly oral society.

  

There are huge possibilities with the application of the Orality and Literacy perspectives to a better understanding of premodern and to some extent, contemporary India.

  

The presently taken for granted view of literacy rate as an index of development goes for a toss once pre-modern India had literate non -'scholars' (stone and metal inscribers) and illiterate prodigal scholars, geniuses and 'intellectual monuments' .

  

The awe-inspiring Vaiyaakarana progress in the understanding of language and linguistic holistic view of reality etc. would not have been possible with the flaws of the literate consciousness.

  

There are a very big number of such aspects.

  

I am going to give a series of talks or conduct a workshop covering all these aspects.
