सा॒धु प्रति॑पादितं महोदय।

  

**अपि॑ च चीनदे॒शस्य॒ स्थिति॑र्द्रष्ट॒व्या॑। तत्र॒ लेख॑नं च॒ मुद्र॑णं चो॒भे चि॒रेणा॑स्ताम्। तैरपि॑ गणि॒ते म॒हद् वि॒ज्ञान॒म् अवा॑प्तम् आसीत्।**

Also, we should see the case of China, where writing and printing, both have been present for long. They also gained much knowledge in Mathematics.

  

**यन् नव्यं॑ गणि॒तं यू॑रोपदे॒शेष्वे॒व परि॑णतम् इव ल॒क्ष्यते॒ तत्र॒ कार॑णं॒ तेषां॑ कालविशे॒षे स॑र्वाङ्गविका॒सः।**

The reason we find modern mathematics to have taken its form in European countries is their overall development in the particular time period.
