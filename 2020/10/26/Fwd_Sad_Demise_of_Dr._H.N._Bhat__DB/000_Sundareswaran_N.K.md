Subject: Fwd: Sad Demise of Dr. H.N. Bhat  
To: Sundareswaran N.K \<[nksw...@gmail.com]()\>  

  
  

It is with deep regret that we write to inform you of the demise of H.N. Bhat, a scholar at the Pondicherry Centre of the EFEO for 24 years (1989 to 2013). He passed away in Shimoga, where his daughter lives, on Thursday, 22nd Oct 2020. His son Satya, whom many of you will remember, is returning today from the US. During his years of service, H.N. Bhat published one of the few existing critical editions of a Sanskrit commentary on a drama, namely Murāri’s*pañcikā*on the*Anargharāghava*. He also published, with S.A.S. Sarma, a first critical edition of the Keralan aesthete Pūrṇasarasvatī’s commentary (*Bhaktimandākinī*) on the*Viṣṇupādādikeśastotra*. Fascinated by Sanskrit belles lettres and literary Prakrits, he helped in the preparation of literary word-lists, and participated in many reading groups, where his contributions were often surprising and stimulating. After his retirement in February 2013, he continued to be active on online message-boards for students of Sanskrit seeking guidance.H.N. Bhat's last rites will be performed at Uppinangadi, Karnataka.
