 I am shocked at his demise..!!

Sanskrit fraternity has lost an exemplary grammarian cum critic.  

Most of the time, his replies were instantaneous & very curt yet thought provoking

His postings & comments can be seen in most of the sanskrit blogs in the internet.

  

Sir was living at Shimoga with his daughter.  

He is a very very simple man by his looks & attire. He never complained of food or the place. He used to adjust himself wherever he is put in.

His sole companion was his tablet & few sanskrit books .

Once when he approached SBI for an error . The staff misunderstood him to be an illiterate seeing his simple looks & attire & nudged him away.

The staff then suggested do that way, do this way..

Sir then let out his wisdom from the bag, no body could withstand his thorough knowledge in internet, apps etc & all were astonished.

  

Sir was suffering from Jaundice & was admitted in the hospital.

He was made to undergo corona test whose result was negative.

But the hospital authorities admitted him & kept on performing test after test..

He was shifted out from ICU & put on general medicines.

He breathed his lost on 22.10.2020 at his 72 years of age.

his son flew from USA and performed the last rites.

Learnt from her daughter that hnbhat01at gmail dot com is still alive .

People can express their condolences in that mail.

  

He will be ever remembered by me for all the guidance he has given especially to the samskrita googlegroup.

  

Few pictures of sir..
