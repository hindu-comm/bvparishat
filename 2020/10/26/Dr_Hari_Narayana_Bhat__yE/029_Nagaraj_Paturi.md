Thanks for sharing those excellent pictures and a detailed eulogy, Sri K N Ramesh-ji.

  

I saw that sea shore picture in his profile. But that was small and low pixel. This is a high resolution one. Thanks for sharing.

  

That family pic is also a good selection and has come out very well.

  

This list misses him deeply.
