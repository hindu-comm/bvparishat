Shocked to learn about the demise of Dr.HN Bhat . Heartfelt condolences.

  

I have met him in his house once in Chennai three or four years ago. What amazed me most was - he was living in a remote suburb of Chennai where internet communication, accessibility by road even was very difficult. His computer also needed updating, a CD that we took did not work, the system was very slow, the OS will not cooperate. But the way he was communicating with us all in BVP was amazing.  

  

I could see the verse in action - क्रियासिद्धिः सत्त्वे वसति महतां नोपकरणे।  

  

Salutations to the great soul.
