Namaste,

  

I learnt Kashika under his guidance. I used to shoot questions to him via mail and he used to clarify the problem very easily.

  

What I loved most about his style was that he did not give the answer directly. He did not believe in spoon feeding. He would ask you counter question. Once you think about his counter question, you yourself would come to know about fallacy in your questions. And this learning gets retained in mind for long, long time.

  

A personal loss to me.

  

I would appreciate if someone from the list can send me his residential address off list.
