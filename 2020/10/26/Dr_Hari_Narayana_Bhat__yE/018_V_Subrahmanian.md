Dr. Bhat was a very amiable person. I had a chance to meet him personally in 2012 in Chennai when he had come to the venue where the Sringeri Jagadguru was camping for Chaturmasya and the annual Mahaganapati Vakyartha Sabha was on.

  

He expounded to me personally over chat a small text of humorousverses some years ago.

  

Our tributes to the exalted soul.
