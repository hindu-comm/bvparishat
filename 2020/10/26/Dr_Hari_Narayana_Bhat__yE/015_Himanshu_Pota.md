Dear Dr Patel,

  

I believe Dr Bhat's phone -[+91 82960 53906](tel:+91%2082960%2053906) - is still active. The news came through this phone sent by his son.

  

I wish someone who lives in Chennai can go to his son's residence, collect as many facts as possible, and publishes a fitting eulogy celebrating his scholarship. Perhaps Veeranarayana Pandurangi ji can put it all together for us.

  

He was a great man, an embodiment of a great scholarship culture.

  

Thanks.

  

Himanshu
