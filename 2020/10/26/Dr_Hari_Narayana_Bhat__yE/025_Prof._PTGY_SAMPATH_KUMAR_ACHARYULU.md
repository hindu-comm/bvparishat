It’s a shocking news to me that Dr. Harinarayana Bhat is no more.

He is such a person to remember for ever. He is very simple in person and highly reputed in scholarship.

Sanskrit world lost A grate grammarian, and a critic.

I had a grate chance to accompany with him for more than ten years while working in EFEO, Pondicherry during 1987. - 97, preparing entire Samasa section of Paniniya Udaharana Kosha. But unfortunately the publishers omitted my name in the publication. Of course this is quite common practice every where. But Dr. HN Bhat is really a peculiar scholar, who could succeeded such people and continued upto end of service.

He has submitted his theses on Pancika on Anarghararaghava, to Madras University during 1987, working as a Sanskrit teacher at school level. His theses was attracted the scholars, And made him appointed in the EFEO, placing him in a world wide reputation.

  

I pray Lord Srimannarayana to shower his grace on Harinarayana, for ever peace of his departed soul.

I convey My deep condolence to his family members.
