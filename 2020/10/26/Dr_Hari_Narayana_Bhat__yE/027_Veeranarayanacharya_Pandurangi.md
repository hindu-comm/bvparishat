True Sir.

But unfortunately the publishers omitted my name in the publication. Of course this is quite common practice every where.  

  

It is also particularly true in French context.

I wonder nobody in BVP asked in whose name Bhats work on Bhavabhuti word index is published.

This is saddest thing to happen. But such things do happen.
