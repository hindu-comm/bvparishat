Indeed a great loss to Samskrit scholarship and personal loss to me.

  

I had worked along with him in French institute of Pondicherry during 1999 to 2004. And immensely benifited by his scholarship.

  

He worked in EFEO for 24 years collaborating with many scholars both indian and Western.

  

However due his style of communication, his reach was limited to mostly writing, but that too was limited by the French style of administration.  

  

He published

Murāri’s*pañcikā*on the*Anargharāghava*. He also published, with S.A.S. Sarma, a first critical edition of the Keralan aesthete Pūrṇasarasvatī’s commentary (*Bhaktimandākinī*) on the*Viṣṇ*upādādikeśastotra as already noted. But his published (in other persons name) writings include Bhavabhuti word index (published under .....name as everyone knows it).

In this way, he might have published so many things. May be kashika critical edition, he was working on it partially.

He had prepared one more critical edition of a kavya work, perhaps Mahanayak??? SAS Sharma knows better.

But he was noticed by most of people only in BVP and other forums after this evolution of internet properly.

He had been paralyzed for many years now but still could participate in BVP enthusiastically.

He could not come to Udupi conference of BVP due to his ailments.

I hope French people will take measures to publish his works.
