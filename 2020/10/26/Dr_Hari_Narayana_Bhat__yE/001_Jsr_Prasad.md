This is indeed a great loss to Sanskrit scholarship. A scholar par excellence, maintained a low profile throughout his career. French Institute was blessed to have him as its resourceperson. He was prompt in answering several questions, and contributed to BVP a lot with unmatchingscholarship. सद्गतिप्राप्तिरस्त्विति प्रार्थना ।
