Dear friends,

Good morning.

In our group here, we study the neurological process of speech production.

The goal is to create a quantitative model to convert a thought into a syllabic

expression. We struggle through the literature in anatomy, linguistics, neurology,

psychology and philosophy. Our next semar is Dec 19, Saturday. I will post

the announcement.

  

Two months ago, we did a live experiment on melody. Our speech itself is prosodic,

on occasions it becomes melodic. Melodies appear as natural and possibly

have infinite variations like the infinite structural formations in objects. But some

melodies become dominant and they stay in human culture. We wanted to check  

if we can catch a melody in expression and extend it with our own expression.

We wanted to think that melody is human and is independent of language

if the language is expressed naturally. We gathered thirty poets in various languages

and requested them to "sing" compositions on "Liberation". The logic was that the  

next person was expected to link to the previous melody. It was an experiment.  

  

I am sharing a report of the meeting to give you the overall structure.
The link is

There is more to it in science and we will gradually produce it.

I am giving below the meeting video which is close to three hours.

It may have intellectual value on the rendering of "Liberation" with its

many facets. I see it as a scientific experiment on a live chain of melody

through cognitive expression. Unlike orchestra, there is no previous code

and each poet operated totally unaware of the previous person's material  

or rendering. Here is the video.

Interested people may write to me privately.

  

Happy Purnami (an evening of melody!)  

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
