Thank you, Bijoy Mishra Ji, Professor Deshpande Ji, and Krishna Kashyap Ji.

  

Some members have emailed me requesting an English translation. So, I am attempting to provide one. Some words such as रासमण्डल have deeper meanings that cannot be captured in the translation:

  

रासपूर्णिमागीतम्

  

The Song of the Full Moon Night of Rāsa

  
  
शरदि शर्वरीशोदये प्रभो  
त्वमसि भास्वरो रासमण्डले।  
उडुपतिं विना तारकच्छटा  
शतसहस्रशो नैव शोभते॥1

  

In autumn, at the time of moon-rise, O lord, you are the resplendent one in theRāsa-arena. For without the presence of the moon, who is the lord of constellations, the lustre of stars, though present in their hundreds of thousands, does not illuminate us.

  
  
करधृता यया पादकिङ्किणी  
चरणयोर्यया कङ्कणं धृतम्।  
विकृतवेष्टिता वेणुमोहिता  
जयति गोपिका कृष्णवल्लभा॥2

  

Charmed by the music of the flute, the cowmaid (Gopi), who adorned her hands with anklets and feet with bracelets, while wearing her clothes inside out, excels.  

  
सरसिजारुणौ यस्य लोचनौ  
मकरकुण्डले कर्णयोः तथा।  
मधुरिमा मुखे यस्य मोहिनी  
तदधरामृतं को न वाञ्छति॥3

  

Who does not want to drink the nectar flowing from the lips of the one whose eyes are radiant like a lotus, who wears crocodile-shaped ear-rings, and whose sweetness is enchanting?

  
  
तदपि मानिनी-गोपिकाः मुदा  
करतलस्वनैः नर्तयन्ति तम्।  
अपि तु लीलया नृत्यति स्वतो  
निभृतमर्म तद्वेत्ति को बुधः॥4

  

"However, even then, the proud milkmaids blissfully made him dance to the clapping of their hands. Or did he dance on his own accord, as a sport?" -- Which intelligent person can understand the secret of this matter?

  
  
खलु रहस्यकं सर्वमेव तज्-  

जनकमातरौ नैवनिश्चिते।

  
प्रियतमो तथापि व्रजेश्वरः  
वदति विस्मितो गोपबालकः॥5

  

"Truly, everything is mysterious about this boy. Even the identity of his parents is not certain. But still the lord of Vraja is our beloved."-- says thus an astonished cowherd.

  
  
कुमुदिनीचये रागिनीगणं  
कुवलयाशये रागसङ्ग्रहम्।  
चरणनूपुरे तालमालिकां  
मुररिपोर्निशायां प्रपश्यतु॥6\*

  

In this night of the enemy of Mura, i.e., Krishna, behold the Raginis in the hosts of night lotuses, the Ragas in the hearts of water-lilies, and the range of Talas in the beads of his anklets.

  
  
दिनकरोदये रासमण्डलं  
पशुपतिः स्वयं द्रष्टुमिच्छया।  
विपिनमागतो गुर्जरीगला-  
दृषभधैवतारूढभैरवः॥7\*

  

When the sun was about to rise, Shiva himself, desiring to see theRāsa-arena, arrived at the forest in disguise. He sprung as Raga Bhairava, riding the second (Rishabha or bull) and sixth (Dhaivata) notes of the octave, from the song of a Gurjari (milkmaid).

  
  
व्रजकुले पुरा गोपिकार्चितो  
भवतु मेऽधुना वस्तु चक्षुषोः।  
विरहपीडिता व्याकुला हरे  
भरतभूरियं त्वां प्रतीक्षते॥8

  

May he, who was thus worshipped, by the milkmaids in ancient Vraja, now become the object of my eyes. O Krishna, this land of Bharata is anxious and afflicted by the sorrow of your separation, and awaits your arrival.

  
  
हृदि न ते दया हे दयानिधे  
स्वपिषि वारिधौ योगनिद्रया।  
अनवलम्बितं मोहसागरे  
पतितमेव मां वा न पश्यसि॥9

  

O abode of mercy! Either you do not have forgiveness in your heart, as you sleep in your Yogic meditation in Vaikuntha; or, you do not see me sinking unsupported in this sea of delusion.

  
  
मनुजजीवनं निर्मितं त्वया  
प्रणयबन्धनं साधितं त्वया।  
विरहवेदना कारिता त्वया  
जगदिदं हरे त्वां प्रतीक्षते॥10

  

You created this human life. You initiated this bond of affection. You caused the pangs of separation. And, O Krishna, now, this world awaits you.

  
  
गजपतेः त्वया क्रन्दनं श्रुतं  
द्रुपदनन्दिनीरोदनं श्रुतम्।  
श्रुतमहो ध्रुवाभ्यर्थनंवने  
कथमिह स्वरः श्रूयते न मे॥11

  

You attended to the cries of the great Gajendra. You heard the wailing of Draupadi. You answered the prayer of Dhruva in the forest. How, then, could you not hear my call?

  
  
नटतु मोहनः कृष्णनागरो  
नटतु राधिका नागरी सदा।  
नटतु गोकुलं गोपलालितं  
नटतु पावनं रासमण्डलम् ॥12  

  

Thus, the intelligent Krishna dances, along with Radha and the village of Gokula, the beloved of cowherds. So dances thisRāsa-arena.

  

Best,

Kushagra
