Dear friends,

IIT Gandhinagar’s Archaeological Sciences Centre launches this Saturday a monthly webinar series on “**Recent Advances in South Asia’s History and Archaeology**”, which will generally take place on the last Saturday of each month. Some of the world’s best experts will be speaking in turn, bringing to a wider public the latest advances in their fields. In the process, a good deal of misinformation or misconceptions will be dispelled.

A poster on the entire series is attached.

We begin this Saturday October 31^(st)with**Prof. Ravi Korisettar**, one of India’s finest prehistorians, who will speak on "Prehistoric Colonization in the Indian Subcontinent". Please see the poster announcing the lecture.

Lectures can be attended only after registration (see bottom left on each event’s poster).

The registration link for Prof Korisettar’s lecture is repeated here for your convenience:

Of course, lectures will be shared later on Archaeological Sciences Centre’s YouTube channel, and will build up to a very rich collection on early India.

Please feel free to share this information with friends or on other forums / social media.

Best regards,

Michel
