Reminded me of my student days in Veda Vijnana Gurukulam, Bengaluru, where, early morning we used to recite this pratahsmaranam. Nostalgic. Thank you very much.  

  

One humble suggestion sir - If possible, can the text (in Devanagari) of the verses be given in the description below, so that whoever wants to use the verses in their blogs or other writings can get mistake-free content.

  

regards

Jayaraman
