The present Subhashita comes under the contextual category.

We have to understand a Subhashita taking the meaning wholly. It is like a Mahavakya.

The present Subhashita's aim is not about happiness. It is about not being lazy, not putting any effort etc.

It is something as would be said by a teacher, parent or elder to the young one.

"If you are lazy and don't put any effort in studies, you won't get any education. What happens then?

You won't get any job or money. So you will have no time left to make any friends and enjoy with them.

You have to spend all your time to earn some moremoney. You will be alone. You will have no one to share

your worries or happiness with."

It is still something like, "If you don't do your homework, I won't allow you to go out and play with your friends.

You have to sit here all alone."

So don't be lazy, study well, earn well, make friends, and enjoy life.

Thus if you take the whole meaning, and create a story, you will enjoy the Subhashita. Most of the Subhashitas are like that only.

That is why they seem to be contradictory. But it is not so. We have to try to grasp the real meaning.

Sankaracharya asked for money in Kanakadharastava, and not for moksha to the woman!
