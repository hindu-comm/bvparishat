Please read the article<https://blog.practicalsanskrit.com/2012/03/give-your-best-be-of-some-worth.html>

for the relationshipbetween money and friendship.

You can't make **new**friends if you are poor. You can sure find someone who will take pity and help you.

This is practical world, niti, not ideal spiritual AdhyAtmika pursuit.

  

Also, udyoga is important and that alone will give you results.

But, even after udyoga, sometimes you may not get results. That is due to daiva, the X-factor, the unknown.

We are not in control of everything.

  

  
  

Thanks,
