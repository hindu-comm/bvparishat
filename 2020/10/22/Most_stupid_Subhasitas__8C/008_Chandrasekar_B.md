Suppose a person does not have any friends, eg., lets take when a person is in between jobs. Friends are the ones who refer a person to the jobs. And hence the search is completed due to the help of friends. Without that, the search will be longer dealing with contractors with money for them:-) So, friends lead to happiness.
