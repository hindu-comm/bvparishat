pariṣade namaḥ pāriṣadbhyonamaḥ

  

Namaste Rishiji,

  

I would like to make a note on this matter, as this relates to something I have been studying for a while and I am collating my thoughts to publish on this matter. But it may be considered a rather heterodox proposition, since it runs counter to prevalent thinking. Thus, in offering this answer, I also welcome the learned opinions of the scholars of this pariṣad, for I may be mistaken too.

  

There are two aspects to the question: (a) that a particular citation is not traceable to the extant texts, and (b) that it is being cited as*śruti*.

  

To the first aspect (a), if it is not found in anybrāhmaṇa, it is often taken to mean that this phrase belonged to a text (aśākhā) that is not now extant, and is thus easily resolved. Although given the context of the citation, this phrase is mostly likely to be found in thegṛhyasūtras. But that leads us to the second question: namely, that of its being cited asśruti.

  

To the second aspect (b), there exists currently a rather rigid way of categorizing the vedic texts whereby thesaṃhitā-brāhmaṇa-āraṇyaka-upaniṣad texts are boxed up as śruti while the trio of theśrautasūtra-gṛhyasūtra-dharmasūtra texts are boxed up . While older German and modern American Indological exegeses have (notably extant in Hiltebeitel and Olivelle) kept this distinction, many modern Indian interpreters have also stuck to this template rather uncritically.

  

As a Suklayajurvediya karmakāṇḍin (practicing ritualist), while studying the upanayana ritual and performing it as per the Paraskaragrhya (as well as the Satapathabrahmana), I had felt a straitjacketed intuition that this distinction is problematic. At a distance, it may be an effective conceptual distinction to introduce a student to the entire array of the vaidika tradition, but when looked at closely, this grouping is not quite forceful. While a linguistic distinction (and a historical difference between the period of their composition) definitely exists between the two groups of texts, the clubbing together of the śrautasūtra-gṛhyasūtra on one hand and the dharmasūtra on the other as a fixedkalpasūtra corpus on that sole linguistic and historical basis may not (or perhaps should not) be held on to, since there is also a thematic and ritual continuity and injunctive relevance attached to it.

  

Even though it may be slightly muted, nonetheless I believe this opinion has existed in parallel. my instinct was validated when I found that Nṛsiṃha in his Prayogapārijāta also recorded the opinion that some pandits consider the gṛhyasūtra (and by extension: śrautasūtra) to be śruti as well (in the sense of having the same injunctive force, i.e. śruti-tulya). The instinct of the ritualist would tend to concur. Furthermore,commenting on Āpastamba's passage on the upanayana (गर्भाष्टमेषु ब्राह्मणमुपनयीत), Sudarśana in his Tātparyadarśana stresses that "upanayanaṃ śrautamiti jñāpayitum" - that is also, I think, an important remark. He adds: "iti etat śruti anukāritatvāt".

  

Despite this, it may also be possible that the phrase 'iti śruteḥ' (depending on where exactly you found the citation) must necessarily take to mean the textual canon sense. If we take the Śāṇkhāyanagṛhyasūtra's usage ofśrutaṃ as 'learned in the Veda' (श्रुतं तु सर्वानत्येति ३ न श्रुतमतीयात् ४ अधिदैवमथाध्यात्ममधियज्ञमिति त्रयम् मन्त्रेषु ब्राह्मणे चैव श्रुतमित्यभिधीयते ५) , then 'iti śruteḥ'could also may have referred to any text in theārṣaparaṃparā in the sense of being known to the vedajñas ('it is so heard to been so decreed').

  

I would be grateful if you could share where exactly you found this reference being cited as śruti. I would use it as a reference in my work.

  

I hope my answer has been helpful.
