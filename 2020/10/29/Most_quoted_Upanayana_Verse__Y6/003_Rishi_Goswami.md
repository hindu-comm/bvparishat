नमामि सहिष्णुजी।

  

I have found this in most Mimamsa Granthas. Be it Apadevi, Manameodaya or commentaries on Artha Sangraha, in Shaabara Bhashya too if I'm not mistaken and many other Vedanta granthas too.

  

वसन्ते ब्राह्मणम् उपनयीत is another frequently quoted verse.

वसन्ते ब्राह्मणोSग्निमादधीत etc.

  

These are quoted to denote अधिकार of a ब्राह्मण। as he is mentioned being an adjective of the doer.

  

यज्ञोपवीत्येवाधीयीत also in तैत्तिरीय आरण्यक।

  

These are easily available on google searches. But the prior अष्टवर्ष which is most quoted is only available in the books where it is quoted, not the Shruti.

  

I agree with your opinion. But I do feel this is साक्षात्श्रुति।
