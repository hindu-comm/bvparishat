The same situation that is today was there before Hari entered the seen -**people did not have जिज्ञासा and wanted everything in brief**-- even महाभाष्यम् was lost on the same and other grounds  
  

This was the eye opener! It was an observed truth and must be very common, that it was officially noted.

  

Thank you, Dr Korada, as always there are lot of new information/facts that one gets from each of your post. 🙇‍♂️🙏🙇‍♂️  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
