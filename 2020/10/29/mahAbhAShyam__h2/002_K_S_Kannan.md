Already by the time of Patañjali,

Vyāḍi's work was lost more or less.

And Mahābhāṣya was rescued from the South!

Chapters in the vicissitudes of Grammar in India.

  

The Yogic tradition got lost too in its long career

as the Gītā indicated (4.2).

  

Coming to the recent centuries,  

we cannot even make a very rough guess as to how much was lost  

due to devastations wrought by Muslim brutes by way of burning libraries,

and how many official records were destroyed  

by the cunning colonialists, the Christian Britishers.

Both are past masters in "the perfect genocide"

as noted by Prof. Arvind Sharma.
