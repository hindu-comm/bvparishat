At the request of a historian friend, I've dumped historical panchaanga summarie-s (South Indian common computation system used) centered around:

  

\- Hampi 1300s to 1600s

\- Pune 1600s to 1800s

\- Mysore 1730s to 1950

\- Bengaluru 1950 onwards.

  

It makes it easy to map Gregorian/ Julian / Islamic date to panchAnga dates.  

  

If it aids your research as well, feel free to use it ( <https://jyotisham.github.io/jyotisha/output/> ) .  
  

PS: Some paths of calendars sent in prior mails have changed.
