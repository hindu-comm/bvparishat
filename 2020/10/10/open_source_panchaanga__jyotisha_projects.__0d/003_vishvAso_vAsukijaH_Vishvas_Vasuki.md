Same folks bcc-ed and cc-ed .

  

Inspired by shrI harSha's (bcc-ed) quiz bots, we now have a **telegram channel** where a bot sends daily panchaanga message-s (one for kauNDinyAyana system, another for the common sidereal system) for bengaLUru, India - <https://t.me/bengaluru_panchaanga> . Those interested may subscribe.  

  

Also, in these distributions I've (in a personally maintained event repository) begun to additionally (beyond festivals) mark (mainly as per the Julian and Gregorian calendars) significant **events in Hindu history** such as the  
Tukaram Omble attaining vIrasvarga capturing the maru-rAxasa Ajmal Kasab, paNdit ethnic-cleansing day, the cataclysm at pAnIpat, shivAjI's escape from Agra, capture(s) of panhaLa etc.. Those interested in contributing to it may contact me offline.
