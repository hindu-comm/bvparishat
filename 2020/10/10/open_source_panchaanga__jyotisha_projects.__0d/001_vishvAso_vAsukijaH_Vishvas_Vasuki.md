Same folks bcc-ed and cc-ed (plus shrI sammodAchArya).

  

I Just produced a basic markdown output (richer event markings etc.. pending) - <https://github.com/sanskrit-coders/jyotisha/blob/master/output/sahakAra%20nagar%2C%20bengaLUru/SOLSTICE_POST_DARK_10_ADHIKA__CHITRA_AT_180/shaka_year/1942.md> showing the tropical-luni-solar kauNDinyAyana calendar . (An ICS calendar file for use with calendar apps is also available in the same location - but does not work with Google calendar, though it works fine with Evolution app on Linux.)  
  
For comparison, the commonplace sidereal-tropical-confusion calendar is at <https://github.com/sanskrit-coders/jyotisha/blob/master/output/sahakAra%20nagar%2C%20bengaLUru/MULTI_NEW_MOON_SIDEREAL_MONTH_ADHIKA__CHITRA_AT_180/shaka_year/1942.md> .

  

Please let me know any errors on [github](https://github.com/sanskrit-coders/jyotisha/issues) (might not receive mailing-list emails at my inbox).
