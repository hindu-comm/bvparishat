CC: Interested people (from earlier email threads)  

  
shrI kArtik (cc-ed) and I have contributed to python project at <https://github.com/sanskrit-coders/jyotisha> (backed by a pretty big ok events database - <https://github.com/sanskrit-coders/adyatithi> ).  

  

The code itself is capable of typical (amAnta, chitra-at-180 ayanAMsha, असङ्क्रान्तिमासोऽधिकः ) based calculation (which can be invoked via some shell scripts at <https://github.com/karthikraman/panchangam> ) as well as the ancient but now uncommon tropical lunisolar system ( <https://vvasuki.github.io/jyotiSham/history/kauNDinyAyana/> ) which I prefer.  

  

However, despite recent MAJOR code cleanup/ testing/ structuring efforts, because of (rather unexpected) [speed](https://github.com/sanskrit-coders/jyotisha/issues/52) and portability concerns, I favor moving to a better language. I've started a multiplatform-targetted Kotlin project at <https://github.com/sanskrit-coders/jyotisha-kotlin> . This code will have common panchaanga and utsava computation parts which can be used with platform specific ephemeris code; while reusing the old festival db from <https://github.com/sanskrit-coders/adyatithi> . Besides multi-platform targetting, Kotlin was chosen (over say Scala) because of it's good corporate (intellij) support + adaption, simplicity, richer language features (compared to Java). (PS: The compact and popular swiss ephemeris code is ported for use in JVM languages as well.)  

  

You are welcome to contribute to any/ all of the above repos (particularly the jyotisha-kotlin and adyatithi ). Needless to say, everything is open source.
