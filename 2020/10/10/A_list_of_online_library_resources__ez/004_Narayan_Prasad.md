\<\<If you are meaning these abbreviations, on that page in that link, if you take the cursor to the abbreviation, it shows the full form.>\>

  

If this is so, there are many abbreviations whose full forms are wrongly displayed.

For example, "Adayar D. VI 697" ---> here, D. means the Descriptive Catalogue of Sanskrit Manuscripts, Vol. No..

    It does not mean dated.

    Saṃ. does not meanSaṃvat , but Sanskrit.  
  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
