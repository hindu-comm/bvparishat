Dear members,

  

My father late Prof. A B Padmanabha Rao had written an article pointing out the differences and similarities between the concept of infinitesimals of Bhāskarāchārya and of Newton.

His article is published in IJHS posthumously. Here is a link to his article:

In the same issue, you will also find a book review of his English translation of Līlāvatī, by Prof M S Sriram:

I hope you will find it useful.

  

With kind regards,

Amba Kulkarni
