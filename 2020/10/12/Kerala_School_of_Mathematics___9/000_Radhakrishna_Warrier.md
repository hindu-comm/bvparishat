I got a little time last week to devote to a quick study the contributions of the “Kerala School of Mathematics” to Mathematics and Astronomy. Given below are some information I could gather that may be of interest to this group.

First let me thank śrī Shankara, Bāndhavi ji, śrī Sunil (Swapna Sunil), and śrī Mēgh for their kind help. The links they provided helped me a great deal in understanding the contributions of the “Kerala School of Mathematics” and how this Kerala School came up with the fundamental concepts of calculus at least two hundred and fifty years before Newton. The very useful links they provided are:

-   Printed copy of Yuktibhāṣā with explanations: Thanks śrī Shankara

The people behind the “Kerala School of Mathematics” were:

-   **Mādhava** (c. 1340–1420 CE) — pioneer of the Kerala School of
    Mathematics.
    [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhava_of_Sangamagrama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhava_of_Sangamagrama)
-   **Paramēśvara** (c. 1380–1460 CE) — a disciple of Mādhava, great
    observer and a prolific writer.
    [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameshvara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameshvara)
-   **Nīlakaṇṭha Sōmayājī** (c. 1444–1550 CE) — monumental contributions
    Tantrasaṅgraha and Āryabhaṭiyabhāṣya.
    [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilakantha_Somayaji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilakantha_Somayaji)
-   **Jyēṣṭhadēva** (c. 1530 CE) — author of the celebrated Yuktibhāṣā.
    [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jye%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%ADhadeva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jye%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%ADhadeva)
-   **Śaṅkara Vāriyar** (c. 1500–1560 CE) — a brilliant mathematician
    and astronomer well known for his commentaries.
    [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankara_Variar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankara_Variar)
-   **Putumana Sōmayājī** (c. 1532 CE) — author of several works, but
    well known for his Karaṇapaddhati.
    [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puthumana_Somayaji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puthumana_Somayaji)
-   **Acyuta Piṣāraṭi** (c. 1550–1621 CE) — a disciple of Jyēṣṭhadēva
    and a polymath – teacher of Melpattūr Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭatiri, the
    author of *N**ārāyaṇīyam*.
    [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achyutha_Pisharadi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achyutha_Pisharadi)

  

Mādhava’s works have not survived to reach us in the present day.
*Tantrasaṅgraha* of Nīlakaṇṭha Sōmayājī is based on Mādhava’s works and quotes Mādhava. *Yuktibhāṣ**ā* in Malayalam prose by Jyēṣṭhadēva is based on *Tantrasaṅgraha*. 

The Malayalam prose of the 1500’s of the Yuktibhāṣā is not difficult to understand. Author Jyēṣṭhadēva’s explanations are crisp and clear.
See how he provides an example for *trair**āśikam* (त्रैराशिकम्, the rule of three) which is finding the fourth quantity in a linear function when three values are known.

“ഇതിനുദാഹരണം. അഞ്ഞാഴിനെല്ലിന്നു് ഇരുനാഴി അരി എന്നിങ്ങനെ അറിഞ്ഞിട്ടിരിക്കുമ്പോൾ ഇതിന്റെ ശേഷം നെല്ലിന്നൊക്കെയ്ക്കും ഇങ്ങനെത്തൊരു അരിയോടുള്ള മാനസംബന്ധ നിയമമുണ്ടു് എന്നിരിക്കേണം. ആകയാൽ പന്തിരുനാഴി നെല്ലിന്നു് എത്ര അരിയുണ്ടെന്നു് അറിയേണ്ടുമ്പോൾ ഇത്ത്രൈരാശികമാകുന്ന ക്രിയ ഉപയോഗിക്കുന്നൂ.”

“An example for this \[for *trair**āśikam*\]. If it is known that five *n**āẓi* \[a volumetric measure\] of paddy gives two *n**āẓi* of rice, and considering that this quantitative relationship between paddy and rice holds good hereafter, for finding the amount of rice from twelve *n**āẓi* of paddy, this rule-of-three operation \[*trair**āśikam* *kriya*\] is used.”

\[Incidentally, this volumetric measure *n**āẓi* was popular till relatively recently. I have heard my late mother and my late eldest sister speaking about rice, milk and oil measures in terms of *n**āẓi* and *uri*.\]

It is not the language, but the subject matter that needs careful attention. It is a mathematical and especially geometric treatise and yet it is all words. As per the premodern tradition, no diagrams, or symbolic notations are used. In other words, convenient figures, equations, and formulae are absent. Plenty of technical terms are used but Jyēṣṭhadēva clearly explains these in his work. However, for a newbie, there is need to frequently refer to the explanations when many of these technical terms are encountered.

Here are some technical terms that reflect the calculus fundamentals:

aṇu pariṇāmam = infinitesimal

asaṅkhyam ēṟiyāl = if increases limitless = if tends to infinity

saṃkalitam = integral; also sum of a series

saṃkalita saṃkalitam = integral of an integral

The following is a brief explanation as to why it is considered that Mādhava and the Kerala School of Mathematics knew of the concepts of calculus and used the techniques of calculus in their works. I will not go deep into the technical matter. The technical matter is very interesting, and the interested members can use the links provided to go into the mathematical discussions. I feel the following slide from Prof. P.P. Divakaran’s presentation is sufficient for the present purpose.
