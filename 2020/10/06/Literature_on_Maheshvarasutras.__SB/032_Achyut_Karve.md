Dear Vidwans,

  

The difference between akshara and varna needs to be investigated further. What does theइतpratyaya do? Theइतpratyaya creates semantic value to the letters in each of the sutras. One can see an इत added for the same reason elsewhere. One should not see the abbreviation used in the Ashtadhyayi as those used elsewhere. Those used in the Ashtadhyayi have their own semantic value. For example UN is an abbreviation of United Nations. The letters UN have no semantic value of their own.

  

Patanjali has discussed whether an akshara has semantic value by giving the examples किरिणि, गिरिणि or कूप यूप. Let us take an example from chemistry. Do the characteristics of the compound not change when H2 is replaced by Cu in H2SO4. There is bonding between each of the atoms in the molecule. When क् is replaced by ग् inकिरिणि there is a total change in its semantic value as well as the individual letters cease to have their individual characteristics. The concept of Samhita is therefore pivotal in word building in Sanskrit. This describes how words as well as letters are considered as पदार्थ and आकृति at the same time in Sanskrit.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
