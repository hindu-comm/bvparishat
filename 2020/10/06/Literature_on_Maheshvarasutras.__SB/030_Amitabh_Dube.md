Dear **Professor Achyut Karve**,

  

Hello! Thank you for sharing such piercing insight into nuances of *Language*that the *Human Mind*has elaborated to such an evolved state. I am working as a *Senior Professor* in the *Department of Physiology* at *S.M.S. MedicalCollege and Attached Hospitals, Jaipur*and presently our team is trying to *Model the working of Human Mind*. We were fortunate enough to have been associated with such an elite and learned group of *Sanskrit Academicians*.Your presentation and your book on *Unveiling the Atlantis of Sanskrit Phonology*has influenced ourongoing work on appreciation of genesis of *Language in the Human Mind*.Do please share your mobile number, if possible, so that I could interact and discuss our ongoing work on*Language*. Thank youonce again for yourtime and inputs.

  

With warm regards,
