Dear Vidwans,

  

 "It is important to note that Bhojadeva in his[सरस्वतीकण्ठाभरणम्](https://ashtadhyayi.com/ska/)has used only 13 instead of 14 anubandhas(इत्) in thepratyāhārasūtras. The two
pratyāhārasūtras."ह य व र ट्। ल ण्।" has been merged into a single one "ह य व र ल ण्।"  

  

Here is the reason why not only र but ल and ण too have become non retroflex in some regional languages. It also shows how regional dialects have impacted Sanskrit.

  

On the other hand had the two sutras been combined with the pratyyaharaletter ट the two sutras could have been merged into one as ह य व र ल ट, where both र and ल would have become retroflex. By making a separate sutra for ल Panini has himself created confusion in the instruction as then ल ण can be phonated with a dental ल and a nasal ण which would then go against the sutra मुखनासिका वचनोनुनासिका: or ल and
ण as retroflex letters and ण as an अनुनासिका.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
