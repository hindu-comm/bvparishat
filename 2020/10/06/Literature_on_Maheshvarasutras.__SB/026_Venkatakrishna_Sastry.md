Namaste Sivasenani ji



In the notes I observed a sentence reading :



\<While the Māheśvara sūtras are nothing more than the letters of the alphabet, and are actually called **akṣarasamāmnāya** **or varṇasamāmnāya**, > .



*Clarification requested* : What is the difference between the two terms **akṣara-samāmnāya** **or varṇa-samāmnāya ? Why two separate terms if they mean the same ? **

****

** Is varna same as akshara ? whether in worldly usage ( laukika) or vedic context ( samaamnaaya/ Chandas) ? What would be 'ha'- akshara, varna, both ? **

****

**Should we take 14 shivasutra's as ' Varna- upadesha' or ' akshara-upadesha'? **

****

**Regards**
