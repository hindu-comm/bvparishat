Dear Vidwans,

  

I had by mistake posted the following post in the wrong thread. I am reposting the response which was meant for this thread.

Dear Vidwans,

  

I am attaching the above video for the perusal of all. The Maheshwar Sutra have been misconstrued to have been composed for the sake of abbreviations for the Ashtadhyayi. Patanjali in his first anhik has given an example of a man who is offering water to his dead ancestors sitting under a tree. This act of the man serves two purposes. The ancestors are offered offerings as well as the tree is watered. In the same way prescriptingthe Ashtadhyayi with the Maheshwar Sutras serves two purposes. The pratyaharaswere useful in compiling the Ashtadhyayi as they provided abbreviations. The other part was in instructing the letters and that too in Sutra form. The same form in which the Ashtadhyayi was compiled. A question arises naturally which of the two was the main objective of the Maheshwar Sutras. In the article 'A Method of Linguistic Description' Staal concludes 'The analysis above may give a glimpse of the techniques used in Panini's workshop. It also shows that a phonological analysis of the sounds of a language, expressed in a mere list with subdivisions, can be fully determined by the grammatical structure of the language'. Is this true for all languages? The question is whether the nature of the elements of a language (here letters or अक्षर) determine the nature of the language or vice-a-versa. But Panini has not left it there. He has arranged them into sutras which have been considered as Vedas by Patanjali. The use of the indicatory mark is not casual. Panini has used indicatory marks at many other places.

  

What does the indicatory letter achieve? The indicatory letter helps in completing the articulation of the last letter of the sequence. Thus the Maheshwar Sutras also help to instruct each of the letters in the Sutras. This aspect of the Maheshwar Sutras seems to have been completely ignored by the later commentators of the Ashtadhyayi except Katyayana and Patanjali.

  

'Of course the method of presentation must differ in form from that of inquiry. The latter has to appropriate the material in detail, to analyse its different forms of development, to trace out their inner connexion. Only after this work is done, can the actual movement be adequately described. If this is done successfully, if the life of the subject-matter is ideally reflected as in a mirror, then it may appear as if we had before us a mere a priori construction'   

Karl Marx, Das Capital, Afterword to the Second German Edition. 

  

The above is the best description of how Panini must have analysed both Vedic and Laukik Sanskrit. The question that needs an answer is whether it would have been possible for Panini to compile such a work like the Ashtadhyayi without sensing and observing the uniqueness of each letter and its relation with other letters? To say that the presentation of Sanskrit Grammar in the Ashtadhyayi was the method he used for the investigation of the Sanskrit Language is misplaced.

  

My investigation therefore aimed at unveiling the unique way in which Panini must have been articulating letters, words and sutras. This could only be done with the help of the Maheshwar Sutras the results of which have been presented by me in a concise form in the above video.



With regards,

Achyut Karve.
