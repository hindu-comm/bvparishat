Dear Sir

  

I know that many references have already been given. Even so, I thought that the attached class notes on Sivasutrasdeveloped at University of Hyderabad (unpublished) would be useful. This materialsummarizes most of the papers that have been given here, including the comments of Patanjali and Bhartrihari. It shows the different justifications (linguistic, historical, mathematical, set-theory based, and based on Sastra-prakriya) offered by modern scholars and tradition.Three appendices show the formation of pratyahaaras, give a list of pratyahaaraspossible (305) and those which are used (44), and explain the derivation of examples used in the discussion about the second 'ha'. The structure is reproduced below for easy reference:

  

1. Intorduction to Sivasutras

2. Patanjali on the Repetition of 'h

3. Fritz Staal's Linguistic Explanation of Order of Consonants

4. George Cardona's "Historic Reasoning"

5. Kiparsky's Mathematical Reasoning

6. Wiebke Petersen's Generalization: S-sortability

7. Patañjali on the Repetition of "Ṇ"

8. Bhartṛhari on the Repetition of "Ṇ"

9. Possible Application in Other Areas

Annexure 1 – Formation of Pratyāhāras

Annexure 2 – Possible Pratyāhāras and Those Used

Annexure 3 – Derivation of Examples

  

Regards

Senani
