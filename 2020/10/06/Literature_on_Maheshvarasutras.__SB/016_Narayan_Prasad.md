Sir,

 This point has been included in her thesis of 2008. I quoted the first para of her conclusions in English translation:

      <https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/hJty6h7ycZU>

 My message has no statement contrary to her conclusion. Bhojadeva in his SKA has used only 13 (instead of 14) pratyahaaras. But the conditions imposed by Dr Petersen are no longer satisfied in this case.

 Regards

 Narayan Prasad
