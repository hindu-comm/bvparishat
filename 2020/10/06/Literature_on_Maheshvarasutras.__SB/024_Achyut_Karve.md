Dear Vidwans,

  

1\) A language can only function within the constraints afforded by the vocal mechanism provided by nature. What are the constraints?

  

2\) What are the various parts of the vocal mechanism provided by nature?

  

3\) How are they mutually coupled when a particular speech sound is produced?

  

4\) What is the role of the tongue?

  

5\) Is it an independent element or is it a sympathetic element i.e. can it be independently maneuvered?

  

6\) Is the use of the vocal mechanism in Sanskrit as compared to that of other languages the same?

  

7\) How is phonetics different from semantics?

  

8\) How are they related?

  

9\) What is the smallest unit of speech sound which has or can have semantic value?

  

10).Can a science of semantics (grammar) evolve with total disregard to phonetics?

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
