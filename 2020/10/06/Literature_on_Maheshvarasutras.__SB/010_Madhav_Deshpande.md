Dear Siddhartha Ji,

  

  I had already attached my article with one of the previous messages in this chain. If you are not able to access it, I am attaching here once again. My book on Savarṇatva also goes into details of the interpretations of these Sūtras. This book was recently digitized and made available for Open Access by the University of Michigan Press. Here is the link to that book pdf:<https://www.fulcrum.org/concern/monographs/nc580p650>

With best wishes,

  

Madhav M. Deshpande
