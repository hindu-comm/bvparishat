Thank you, Amba. During my student days at the University of Pennsylvania, Professor Paul Thieme was a visiting professor for a year and this was my term paper written for him. He liked itvery much and asked me to submit it for publication in the journal Zeitschrift für Vergleichende Sprachforschung that he was editing. This was my very first scholarly article after coming to the US. With best wishes,
