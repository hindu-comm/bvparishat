Dear Vidwans,

  

  
What is the smallest unit of speech sound which has or can have semantic value?  

  

Here we need to differentiate between a syllable and an akshara. An akshara is the smallest unit of speech which cannot be further broken down as is the case in Chemistry with atoms. An akshara has no semantic value. Onthe other hand a syllable can consist of more than one aksharas which have semantic value. It is the same as is the case in chemistry with respect to molecules.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
