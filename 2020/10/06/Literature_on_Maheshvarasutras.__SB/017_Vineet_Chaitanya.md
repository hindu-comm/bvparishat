Respected Narayan Prasad ji,

  

 I think, she is not claiming that number of
"subsets" required to cover all the cases in Ashtaadhyaayi must be 42.

 Her claim is that given the required "subsets" how to arrange the alphabets so that all the desired subsets are covered.

  

 Interesting point from her point of view is that a letter needs to be repeated and PaaNini chose it to be "ह".  

  

 If I understand you correctly, you are giving evidence that 41 subsets are enough to cover all the cases in Ashtaadhyaayi.

 Am I missing something?

  

Regards
