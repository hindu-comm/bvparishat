Dear Scholars,

  

I faintly remember that Prof.Dr George Cardona had written a monograph on Maheshvarasutras or Shivasutras.

  

I need it's complete details and the link to download it.

  

Moreover,has any scholar done some work on these sutras.I feel that sometime back, there was some discussion on this topic on bvp.

  

Any pointers to this are welcome.

  

Thanks in advance for your help.

  

Sincerely yours,

  

Prof. Siddharth Y.Wakankar
