Thank you, sir, for supplying the articles and the thesis of Dr Petersen Wiebke.

The thesis (2008) of Dr Petersen Wiebke contains his own paper of 2009. How?

Since the thesis is prepared in a font that is not unicode-compliant, and the file being pdf/A, you cannot process the text. I just wanted the English translation of chapter "7 Fazit und Ausblick" (Conclusion and Outlook).

  

Best regards

Narayan Prasad
