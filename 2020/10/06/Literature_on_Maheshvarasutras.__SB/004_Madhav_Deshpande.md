Dear Siddhartha Ji,

  

Here is my article, but it deals with the competing Hindu and Buddhist claims on who inspired Pāṇini. Somewhere in my files, long time ago I collected all the variant versions of these sutras found in some Prātiśākhyas and several non-Pāṇinian traditions of Sanskrit grammar.
If I can find it, I will scan it and send it to you. The Mahābhāṣya discusses the necessity of including ऌ in these Sutras, and discusses alternative orders in a few others, and why Panini uses ण् as a marker twice in these Sutras.
