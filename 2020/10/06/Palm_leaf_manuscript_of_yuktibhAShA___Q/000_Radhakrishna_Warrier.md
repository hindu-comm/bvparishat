Thanks to the members of this group, I was ableto download the manuscript of Yuktibhāṣā, and other interesting materials from the links forwarded by the members.

  

I thought the Malayalam of the 1500's CE would be difficult to understand, but it was not very difficult. What was difficult was reading the palm leaf writing. Though not very different from modern Malayalam script, it was difficult to read because the images were not very clear. Also due to the way of writing.

  

I have tried to read palm leaf granthas from my boyhood. But it was a sporadic activity that I indulged in when I went with my family to our ancestral homes once or twice a year. We had plenty of palm leaf granthas in my mother's and father's ancestral homes. These would be taken out of the aṟa (അറ), or the “sacred room” once or twicea year especially during the days of Sarasvati pooja. On the Vidyarambham day, we would open and try to read some of these granthas. We were told that some were written in Granthākṣaram, while the others were in Malayalam script. At that time, reading even those in Malayalam script appeared a bit difficult because of the peculiar way these granthas were written.
I was told that some of the granthas were devotional and the rest dealt with "secular" subjects like Ayurveda, Astronomy, grammar, and poetry.
The granthas, the aṟa-s, and the very buildings these aṟa-s were part of disappeared behind the kāla yavanika (curtain of time) by the time I got really interested in reading the granthas.

  

Plan to read the manuscript and the other materials I downloaded including the copy of the Vedanga Jyotisha slowly as I get time in between the work I do to earn a living and the personal errands I need to do for the living that I earned.

  

Regards,
