Dear Ones,

  

Greetings! The Department of Contemplative and Behavioural Sciences, Sri Sri University, Cuttack along withthe academic support of Inter University Centre For Teacher Education (IUCTE; an autonomous body under UGC), presents**"Ātmanirbhara Bhārata: India in the 21st Century, Faculty DevelopmentProgram 2020 on Indian Knowledge Systems in Contemporary Education & Practices", 5-19 November, 202009:30 - 17:30 hours (IST).**

  

The challenges of contemporary global civilization are many and there are voices asking for alternatives, searching for systems of thought that promote harmony and mutuality rather than conflict and difference.

  
There is a universally felt need for a new system of values and thought that has the possibility of creating a world of peace and cooperation. Indian civilization, an alternative civilization, is founded as it is on plurality and togetherness. These civilizational values are both centred in and also a product of India's Knowledge Systems. Evidently, we need an education system that will help carve out a brighter and a happier future for Bhārata and the world. This education will need to incorporate the domains of knowledge and traditions of texts and thinkers of India's intellectual heritage.

**  
**

**Bringing Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS) in the centre stage of Education and making it a part of the Faculty Development Programme**is the need of the hour.
