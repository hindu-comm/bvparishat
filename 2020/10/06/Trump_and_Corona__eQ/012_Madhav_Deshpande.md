Dear Murthy Ji,

  

  The Ramayana, Mahabharata and Puranas occasionally have un-Paninian forms, and they are traditionally treated as Ārṣa Prayogas, not to be followed in later classical usage. As I mentioned, Pāṇini himself makes provision for the Chāndasa usage of such forms in conjunction with the use of a genitive case: षष्ठीयुक्तश्छन्दसि वा.
