**Abstract**: Mathematical Astronomy (Siddhantas) developed in India starting from the early centuries of the Common Era. What was the inspiration for the origin and growth of this intellectual tradition? Existence of an astronomer by the name Vrddhagarga is known from the Mahabharata and also his opinions are quoted extensively by later astronomers. Manuscripts of Vrddhagargiya Jyotisha also called Vrddhagarga Samhita are yet to be critically edited and published for wider scholarly use. In this talk the work done so far will be presented bringing out the closeness of the subject matter and the style of narration to Vedic texts. Large parts of the work can be considered as observational astronomy transitioning to computations.
