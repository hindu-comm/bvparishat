The above is an interesting theory/proposition; however, related facts do not seem to support the same.

  

First, we must remember that the Mahabhashya is a commentary on the sutras of Panini (and the varttikas of multiple authors). The sutras need a vritti, and often an explanation, to be properly understood, as is well known. This, in fact, is common across various sutras. So the first instances of bhaashyas known to us are explanations of sutras, which are in a sort of telegraphic language, to use a modern term, requiring an elaboration in the spoken language, 'bhashaa'.
Veda-bhaashya occurs much later, by which time, the term 'bhaashya' has acquired a 'rUDhi' meaning (as can be seen by the usage of Maagha in the 2.24 of Sisupalavadha, for instance). As is well-known, a 'rUDhi' meaning overrides the etymological one, and so the etymology of the word 'bhaashya' is not applicable to the various veda-bhaashyas.

  

Secondly, the earliest bhaashyas were not commentaries of texts that were in Vedic Sanskrit (admitting these labels strictly for the purpose of discussion, since tradition admits of no such hard boundaries).

  

Thirdly, Nirukta, which 'explains' words listed in the Nighantu, itself a thesaurus of difficult words in the Veda, and a few others offers an interesting case. Technically it could be termed as an explanation of

'Veda', but significantly not only is it not called a 'bhaashya', but commentaries on Nirukta are called 'bhaashyas'. Thus we see that the one text which could have been called a 'bhaashya' as per the above theory is actually not called a 'bhaashya'.

  

Therefore, in my view, the assertions 1 and 2 above are not tenable.
