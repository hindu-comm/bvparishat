Namaste



For the question \< Was Vedic Sanskrit called "Bhasya?" >

The reading in the given passage seems to be a misspelling / misreading **भाष्य** (Bhashya) for the intended term भाषा
(bhashaa).



**Original as given Text**: The Vedas were in the form of an increasingly archaic (to them) style of Sanskrit - simply called Bhashya but today is called Vaidik Sanskrit. Bhashya is different from what is now known as Classical Sanskrit in which the Puranas and Itihasas were written.  
  

**What it might have been intended** : The Vedas were in the form of an increasingly archaic (to them) style of Sanskrit - simply called भाषा
but today is called Vaidik Sanskrit. भाषा is different from what is now known as Classical Sanskrit in which the Puranas and Itihasas were written.



Hope this helps.
