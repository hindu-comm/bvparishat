Hare Krishna.  
  
Respected Vidvaj-janas,  
  
Is the use of word “Bhasya” in below paragraph correct? Was Vedic  
Sanskrit called "Bhasya?" :  
  
Along with the Vedas themselves the student had to learn texts that  
explained the Vedas. The Vedas were in the form of an increasingly  
archaic (to them) style of Sanskrit - simply called Bhashya but today  
is called Vaidik Sanskrit. Bhashya is different from what is now known  
as Classical Sanskrit in which the Puranas and Itihasas were written.  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das.
