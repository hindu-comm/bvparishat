There is a difference between Sanskrit as a Bhāṣā (natural language with dialects) - and Sanskrit as a phonological and morphological standard of that natural language.

  

The former is a naturally evolved language like all languages, the latter is a systematization and standardization of the former produced by the grammarians.

  

But too often, people confuse one with the other.

  

To distinguish them we can call the former as Sanskrit language (i.e. what the grammarians call Bhāṣā) and the latter as Standard Sanskrit (produced by the grammarians from the Bhāṣā). However, do remember that both of these are what we can call classical sanskrit. There might have been multiple standards of Sanskrit back in the 4th century BCE but the only surviving one appears to be that of Pāṇini.

  

Although the grammatical tradition must have existed long before Pāṇini, Vedic Sanskrit these days is normally viewed purely from the point of view of a Bhāṣā and less as a standardized register of the Bhāṣā.

  

But by Pāṇini's time, the Vedic dialects had become sufficiently old to be distinguished from the Bhāṣā of his own time (4th century BCE). So when Pāṇini says Bhāṣā, he speaks of the Bhāṣā that could be seen in his time (laukika bhāṣā) and he calls the older Bhāṣā that was only visible from the śākhā saṃhitās of the Vedic tradition vaidika bhāṣā.

  

Thus the original significance of the word bhāṣya must have been to restate the texts of the vedic tradition in the later spoken sanskrit (i.e. classical sanskrit) - thus the earliest bhāṣyas were the commentaries (in classical sanskrit) of texts that were in vedic sanskrit.

  

That the Vyākaraṇa Mahābhāṣya calls itself a Bhāṣya must therefore mean one of two things:

  

1\. It treats the Aṣṭādhyāyī as a śruti (vedic) text, or

2\. The term bhāṣya in the time of Patañjali (150 BCE) had come to denote a commentary of classical sanskrit works also.

  

So a bhāṣya is literally not a commentary but a translation or a restatement into a more recent form of the spoken language. Writing a commmentary in Vedic sanskrit for an original text in classical sanskrit would not fit the definition of bhāṣya.
