The discussion on the difference between ‘v’ and ‘w’ reminded me of my experience of how difficult it is to deal with phonemes that are not in the repertoire of the mother tongue or languages equivalent to mother tongue.

  

Long ago, my Arab friend was trying to explain to me the difference between the two Arabic “t” sounds, the ط and ت. My friend repeated these sounds several times, but I could not reproduce the difference in my pronunciation. Actually, I was hardly hearing the difference. Even those other language groups that use the Arabic script like Persian and Urdu seem to have given up the effort to differentiate these Arabic sounds in pronunciation. The average Persian or Urdu speaker makes no distinction in pronouncing these two Arabic phonemes and pronounce these two alike as “त”. Same was the case with the sounds ظ , ض , ذ.  I heard these as some kind of weird ‘d’ and could not reproduce these, let alone differentiate them. Speakers of Persian and Urdu do not differentiate these in pronunciation. They pronounce all these as “z”.
So, my inability to pronounce them is pardonable. 😊 However, I could easily pronounce a few other Arabic sounds not in my mother tongue, like the Arabic fricative kh (خ), q (ق) and the fricative gh (غ).
