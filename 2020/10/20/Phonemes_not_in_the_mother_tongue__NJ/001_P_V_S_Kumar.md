Are there well defined वर्णोच्छारण स्थानानि (as given in शिक्षा),for sounds inlanguages other than Sanskrit? Only by knowing them, we can understand and improve our pronunciation of other language sounds. Unfortunately, we are hardly taught about वर्णोच्छारण स्थानानिin our curricula. In the case of mother tongue by constant listening we adopt ourselves to the sounds even without knowing the places of articulation. People who do not have a chance for 'constant listening' to their mother tonguefrom people in their community , fail to grab the correct pronunciation. 

  

So, in my opinion, phonemes not in the mother tongue can be learned in only two ways (a) knowing the correct places of articulation with few founds of listening from the persons who use that sound and (b) constant listening to those phones over a prolonged period.
