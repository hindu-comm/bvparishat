Dear Viswas,

  

Except for the Maheshwar Sutras there is no tool available in any of the world languages where letters used in a language can be taught without the use of words. The Roman alphabet in no way affords any clue as to how it is to be pronounced when it comes in a written word. The same is the case with all Indian languages. One can just imagine how a Malayali word rendered in Devanagari script will be pronounced by a Marathi or Hindi speaker or vice-a-versa.

  

Language is an acquired skill and therefore it is no wonder that a deaf person is dumb.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
