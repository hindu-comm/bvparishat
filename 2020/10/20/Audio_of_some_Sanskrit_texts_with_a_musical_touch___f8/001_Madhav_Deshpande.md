Hearty congratulations to Dr. Meera. What a beautiful voice and clear pronunciation. In Maharashtrian weddings, Maṅgalāṣṭakas are routinely recited. Here are some commonly recited Magalāṣṭaka verses. To such verses, often relatives add Marathi verses mentioning the names of the bride and the groom etc. I found a collection of such Maṅgalāṣṭaka verses and I have attached it. With best wishes,
