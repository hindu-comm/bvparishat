Very interesting Nityanandaji. Do any ancient Sanskrit works mention or derive the actual formula for nCr?

  

One of the difficulties we face when reading ancient works on mathematics or any other science is that they don't have any convenient notations to express formulae or equations. Everything is in words.
And if it is in verse, the efforts to confine the words into the meter and to add alliteration and alankara cloud the meaning. Recently I read Yuktibhasha in the Malayalam of the 1500s CE. Since it was prose, the author didn't have to fit the words to any vritta, or add any embellishments. That made the subject matter quite clear. However, lack of diagrams and convenient formuale or equations did cause some difficulties in following the author's explanations.

Radhakrishna Warrier
