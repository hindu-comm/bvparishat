Friends,  

I suspect most of the numerological procedures were developed by the Jaina scholars in their

theories of making sense of the observed universe through physical principles of transformation.

This could include the basic number theory, counting, addition and subtraction, groupings and sets.

Reducing all objects to a similarity of "soul", the universe becomes a manipulation of numbers.

I am told that the Agama literature in Prakrita during the time of Mahavira has a wealth of information.

There is a book Tattvabodhasutra in Sanskrit of 2nd century AD by Monk Umaswati which gives

hints of the previous developments of modeling a finite universe through object manipulation.

A jaina group is planning a Conference in MIT next year (2021) June to help understand the literature.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
