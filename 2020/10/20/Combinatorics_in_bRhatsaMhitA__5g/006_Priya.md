Namaste,

  

The formula in the Ganita-sara-sangraha by Mahavira that Sri Mishra referred to is very clearly stated as follows:

एकाद्येकोत्तरतः पदमूर्ध्वाधर्यतः क्रमोत्क्रमशः ।

स्थाप्य प्रतिलोमघ्नं प्रतिलोमघ्नेन भाजितं सारम् ॥ (५ : २१८)

This is effectively saying:

nCr = (n (n-1)(n-2)…….. (n-r+1))/(1.2 .3……r)

which is equivalent to the well-known

nCr= n!/((n-r)! r!) 

  

Regards,

Priya
