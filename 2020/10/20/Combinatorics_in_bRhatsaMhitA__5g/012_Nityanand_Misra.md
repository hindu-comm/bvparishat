Gaṇitasārasaṅgraha 6.218  

एकाद्येकोत्तरतः पदमूर्ध्वाधर्यतः क्रमोत्क्रमशः।

स्थाप्य प्रतिलोमघ्नं प्रतिलोमघ्नेन भाजितं सारम्॥

  

Rangacharya’s translation of the above verse: “Beginning with one and increasing by one, let the numbers going up to the given number of things be written down in regular order and in the inverse order (respectively) in an upper and a lower (horizontal) row. (If) the product (of one, two, three, or more of the numbers in the upper row) taken from right to left (be) divided by the (corresponding) product (of one, two, three, or more of the numbers in the lower row) also taken from right to left, (the quantity required in each such case of combination) is (obtained as) the result.”
