Combinatorics appears to be a topic that classical Indian mathematicians took great delight in, and also treated with extreme respect. Bhaskara seems to have considered this to be the mastiff of mathematics - gentle and demonstrative, yet demanding and intimidating. Lilavati #277 -

न गुणो न हरो न कृतिर्न घनः पृष्टस्तथापि दुष्टानाम् \|

गर्वितगणकवटूनां स्यात्पातोSवश्यमङ्कपाशेSस्मिन् \|\|

In this maze of numbers there is no multiplication, no division, no squaring or cubing, yet if it is asked of an egoistic, unskilled mathematician, his downfall is certain.

And my rhymed translation, just for fun:

I present you with this numerical snare -

There is no arithmetic here to beware;

But if a ganaka doesn't know his stuff,

His pride takes a tumble here - that's sure enough!

  

  

Regards,

Priya
