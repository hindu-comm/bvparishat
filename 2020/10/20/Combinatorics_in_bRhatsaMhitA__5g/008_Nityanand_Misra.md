Thanks, Sh. Kaul. The verse number is indeed 77.20 as you say and not 76.20.

  

The method described in verse 77.22 is nothing but the recursive formula for nCr, which is

  

nCr = nC(r-1) + (n-1)Cr

  

Varāhamihira knew this recursive formula. It is very likely he also knew the formula which Mahāvīra gave. The highlighted comment by Biggs in the attached image is to be noted. Reference: N.L. Biggs, The Roots of Combinatorics, *Historia Mathematica* **6** (1979), pp. 109–136.

  

Now for the explanation byBhaṭṭotpala. This is a truncated version of Pascal's (or rather Piṅgala's) triangle or the *Meruprastāra*. It is well-known that entries in the Pascal's triangle or*Meruprastāra* are nothing but the nCr values.
