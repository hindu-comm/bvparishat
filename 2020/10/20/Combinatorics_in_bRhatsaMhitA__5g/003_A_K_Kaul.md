Dear Shri Warrier,

Jai Shri Ram!

\< Very interesting Nityanandaji. Do any ancient Sanskrit works mention or derive the actual formula for nCr?>

Yes, many thanks to Nityanandajifor pointing out to 76.20 (actually 77.20) of Brihat-Samhita! --Chowkhamba Vdiyabhavan, Varanasi edition.

Bhatotpala of Shaka 888 has given a practical demonstration through a table as to how the figure 1820 had beenbe arrived at!
(AttacmentnCr-I and nCr-II).

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
