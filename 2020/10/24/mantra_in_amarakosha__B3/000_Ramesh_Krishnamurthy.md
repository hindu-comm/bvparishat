hari om,

  

can you help me understand this entry in Amarakosha, please?

  

मन्त्र:वेदभेदे गुप्तवादे – अ.को. 3.3.167 

  

How do I interpret Veda-bheda and gupta-bheda? How does that apply to the Rk-s and mantra-s in the veda-s and upanishad-s?

  

many thanks in advance.  

  

--  

regards, Ramesh (Mashi)
