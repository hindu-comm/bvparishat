In Purva Mimamsa, different types of Vedic sentences are divided into Vidhi (injunction), Mantra, Naamadheya (designation), Nishedha (Prohibition - sometimes this is included in Vidhi) and Arthavaada (corroborate praise or censure, not to be taken as literally true). For the sake of exegesis, Vidhi and Nishedha are the most important as far as determining the meaning of Veda is concerned. Arthavaada forms the bulk of Veda. Mantras are smaarakas, reminders, of Devataa etc. Naamadheya is the residual category. It may be noted that the Mimaamsaka explicitly rejects the accrual of punya (or apurva in the language of Mimamsa) upon recitation of mantra.

  

There is another division of Veda into mantra and braahmana. In this the text to be used in a particular rite is called the mantra and the text that discusses this rite (how to do, why do, what is the import, what is the ultimate etc.) is called braahmana. So in this scheme, Rks are mantra and Upanishads are Braahmana.

  

Then there is the most popular definition of mantra, मननात् त्रायते इति मन्त्रः, That which protects \[the reciter\] upon remembering it is mantra. As per this definition, repeating a mantra would accrue punya.

  

It is seen that whichever we classify Vedic sentences, Mantra is one such division of Veda. So, in short, it is a Vedabheda - one of the divisions, whatever be the scheme of division. Amarasimha does not express an opinion on the scheme of division. It is up to us to choose the division method.

  

Guotabheda refers to the fact that mantra also means scheming, planning, advising, strategising etc. that is done in secret - what mantris do.
