Malayalam movie songs, especially the old ones are rich in Sanskrit words and classical imagery.

Most of the lyricists of the older generation had a good grasp of Sanskrit and were well read in Sanskrit classics. They would often embellish their lyrics with, words, phrases, and imagery from these classics. The result was of course very pleasing. Vayalār Rāma Varma and ONV Kuṟup were quite adept at this. 

But sometimes deciphering the meanings of some of these songs becomes rather difficult.

Here is a sweet song, but it would not be easy to arrive at the meaning:

*Hima śaila saikata bhūmiyil ninnu nī*

*Praṇaya pravāhamāy vannu*



“You came as a torrent of love (*praṇaya pravāham*) from the sandy soils (*saikata bhūmi*) of the Himālayas.” \[Why sandy soil? Do snow mountains have sandy soil? Is this taken from any ancient Sanskrit classic?\]



*Ati gūḍha susmitam uḷḷil otukkunna*

*Prathamōda binduvāy tīrnnu*.



“You became a *prathamōda bindu* \[what is this?\] that hides within \[*uḷḷil otukkunna*\] a very secretive smile \[*ati gūḍha susmitam*\].
\[What is the idea that this line conveys?\]



ഹിമശൈല സൈകത ഭൂമിയിൽ നിന്നു നീ  
പ്രണയ പ്രവാഹമായ് വന്നു  
അതിഗൂഢ സുസ്മിതം ഉള്ളിലൊതുക്കുന്ന  
പ്രഥമോദ ബിന്ദുവായ് തീര്‍ന്നു
