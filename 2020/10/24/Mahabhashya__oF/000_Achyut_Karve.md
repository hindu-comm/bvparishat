Dear Vidwans,

  

What is the methodology used in the Mahabhashya? Is it correct to draw rules that come subsequently in the Ashtadhyayi to prove or disprove a previous rule?

  

In Euclidean Geometry this does not appear to have been adapted. Later theorems take the previous theorems axiomatically.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
