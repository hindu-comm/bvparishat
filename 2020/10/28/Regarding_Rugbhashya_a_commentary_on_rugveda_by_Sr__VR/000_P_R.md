Hello all

I wanted some information regarding the Rugbhashya of Madhvacharya

I had found one commentary on Rugbhashya by JayaTirtha Muni on Rugbhashya

Dr BNK Sharma states that there is one commentary on Rugbhashya by Kambaluru Ramachandra Tirtha of Sosale Vyasaraja Mutt. Can someone please guide me on this, as to where can I find this work.

I had found one Rugbhashya Tika Tippani edited by Sri KT Pandurangi , but that work did not have the Tippani/Vyakhyana of Kambaluru Ramachandra Tirtha SreecharanaH. Please help me in finding this rare work

  

Thanks andRegards

Dr Pradyumna R
