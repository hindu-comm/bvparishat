My pranams to all scholars in the group. We are running an institute GnanaNiketanam that offers courses in sanskrit , Ramayana, Bhagavad Gita, epigraphy etc. Its aim is to preserve and propagate our shastras and scriptures. We are developing a library to house various books on
our shastras ,religion and culture.

Read about the concordance on the nine vyakaranas. Can anyone please suggest where we can get these nine vyakarana books ?Are they available?

Thank you

Regards

Priya Santhanakrishnan
