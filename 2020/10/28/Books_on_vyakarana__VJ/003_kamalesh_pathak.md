Other sources for grammer books is perhaps digital platform, [www.archive.org](http://www.archive.org) or Sanskrit docs may work, national govt maintains digital library dlindia or if telegram application in use there is Vedic granthkosha platform providing various Sanskrit scanned books,

Special congested to your efforts to spread and preserve our heritage and SANSKRIT,
