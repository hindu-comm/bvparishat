Dear Scholars,

Please accept my humble pranams.

  

Hare Krishna.

  

We are making a series of arts on Ramayana and we have question regarding that.

  

We would like to know that during lord Ramachandra's time, what type of hairstyle would the widows keep, especially the mothers of lord Rama, the wives of king Dashrath, it wouldn't be braided but would it be cropped in eka-veni (ponytail) or short and untied. Also what kind of clothing would the widows wear, would they wear cholis under their white saris?

  

What does it mean when it is said that lord Rama and lakshmana wore tree barks? Is it a kind of a cloth derived from the tree bark and would it extend up to the ankles or only up to the knees?

  

Thank you,

  

Vrindavanachandra Das
