Thank you, Subrahmanian Ji and Megh Ji for reinforcing the message.

  

Another nuance is our concept of प्रलय:

  

**यथोर्णनाभिः सृजते गृह्णते च** यथा पृथिव्यामोषधयः संभवन्ति।

यथा सतः पुरुषात्‌ केशलोमानि तथाऽक्षरात्‌ संभवतीह विश्वम्‌ ॥  
  

According to the Mundaka Upanishad, thespider "withdraws" the net. The wordप्रलय itself carries this sense of "withdrawal":प्रलीयते क्षीयते जगदस्मिन्निति. According to thePuranas, this gradual withdrawal or contraction takes 4.32 billion years (equal to the duration of कल्प).

  

Thus, प्रलय is strikingly different from the concept of Armageddon, which is presented as a distinct event that would happen at a definite point in time ("end of history").

  

Best,

Kushagra
