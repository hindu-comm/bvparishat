Respected Sirs,

I have downloaded 'MUHURTAMALA' from [archive.org](http://archive.org). But in that copy the pages containing Slokas from 16 to 26 are missing. I would be grateful if anybody or any Institution having that book containing those pages may be kind enoughto send me scanned copies of those pages. I am very much in need of those pages.

 With most humble request and best of regards,

  

Ms. SebantiSinha.
