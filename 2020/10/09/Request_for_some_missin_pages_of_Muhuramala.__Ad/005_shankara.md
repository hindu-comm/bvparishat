Namaste,

  

You will find a detailed bibliography of commentaries (those that have been published as well as those not-published) in SK De's History of Sanskrit Poetics, page 204.

<https://archive.org/details/historyofsanskritpoeticssushilkumarde2volumesboundinone/page/n217/mode/1up>

  

As per the above list, Nigudharthachandrika was published from Benares in 1895. It seems copies of this edition are not available on the internet.  

  

Other commentaries in your list are not yet published.  

  

regards  
shankara
