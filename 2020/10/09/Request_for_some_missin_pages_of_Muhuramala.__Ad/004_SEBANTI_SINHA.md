Sir,

  I have received immense help from you till date. Now I want to say to you that I have heard about some commentaries on Chandralokag
written by Piyusvarsa Jayadeva of 13th Century which are perhaps unpublished and kept in manuscript form, They are (1) Bajachandrachandrika (heared to be kept in the library of the King of Jaypur), (2) Chandralokadipika, (3) Nigurarthadipika, (4) Sharadasharvari. I did find them in any place including [archive.org](http://archive.org). I would be indebted to you if you would kindlyprovide me the link or links of those books if available.

With regards,

Sebanti Sinha.
