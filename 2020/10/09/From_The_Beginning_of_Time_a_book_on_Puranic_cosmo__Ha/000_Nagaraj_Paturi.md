While we are on the Vaidika cosmology topic,

  

I would like to share my conversation with Sri Ganesh Swaminathan the author of“From The Beginning of Time” a book on Puranic cosmology

  

and a few pdfs related to the book.

<https://www.amazon.in/Beginning-Time-Science-Puranic-Universe/dp/164850731X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1Z49RQELQ9YVM&dchild=1&keywords=from+the+beginning+of+time&qid=1602220520&s=books&sprefix=from+the+beginning+of+time%2Caps%2C271&sr=1-1>  

  

Interestingly we at Indic Academy , received two more books on the topic, coincidentally from two other authors.

  

One book connects cosmology to 'Indian History' on a grander time scale,

  

the other focuses on astrophysical exactness of Vaidika cosmology.

  

My conversations with the authors are in the pipeline.
