I often see mail and ads Spoken Sanskrit Classes. Is writtenSanskrit different from Spoken Sanskrit?

When One learns a language, one learns to speak, read, write and comprehend all these elements are an integral part of any language .How can one learn a languagedivorced from any one of these elements. One may speak less and read or write more SanskritThat'sdifferent.
