For over a thousand years a theatre festival has been performed in Tamil Nadu and Andhra, totally outside any institutional religious, corporate or state support. This unique festival easily might be the longest standing, independent theatre festival in the world surviving currently. The festival has been funded purely by individual contributions of each family in the community and its primary objective seems to be to create inclusive communities of belonging. For over a decade Sashikanth has been making a series of films on this festival, listed below. He will show excerpts and discuss this work.
