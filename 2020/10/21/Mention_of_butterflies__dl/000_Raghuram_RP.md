अभिवादये,

  

We are studying on butterflies as part of a school project. I went through encyclopaedia dictionary of zoological terms by dr. B . Tirumala acharya (samaskrita-samskrita-english dictionary) . It has only one word named पतङ्ग and पतङ्ग म for butterfly or moth

This book contains so many different species of birds and it's samskrita words but only one mention of butterfly

Is there any reference to different species of butterflies in our scriptures?

  

Any pointers?

  

Thanks and regards

Raghuram
