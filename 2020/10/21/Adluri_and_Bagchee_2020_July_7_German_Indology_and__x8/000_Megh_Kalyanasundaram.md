> > > > "Few European nations developed such a broad spectrum of research on > > India or sought so strongly to defend the notion of a privileged > > access to ancient India as Germany. Yet this German interest was > > peculiarly restricted to ancient India, and German scholars often > > contrasted its intellectual and social achievements with what they > > saw as the degeneracy of contemporary Hinduism. This contri- bution > > discusses the origins and growth of the German fascination with > > India. It surveys the main fields of Indological engagement and > > scholarship and ex- plores reasons why, even today, in Indology we > > can hardly speak of Germany and Hinduism—except negatively—in a > > volume dedicated to Hinduism in Europe." > > > >
