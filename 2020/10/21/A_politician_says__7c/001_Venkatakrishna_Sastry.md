Namaste



A similar idea imitating Gita ( 18-66 ) and generic( !). Following foot steps of seniors.



आधिकार्ये नियुक्ताः भोः, प्रजाः भोः मत-दायकाः।

एकैकोऽपि भवद्गणे मतं शृणुथ मामकम् ।



सर्व-धर्मान्-परित्यज्य ( or न्याय-धर्मान्-परित्यज्य )

मामेकं शरणंव्रज ।

शासनोत्थ-भयेभ्यस्त्वां 

मोक्षयिष्यामि मा शुचः॥



A politician assures every one in administration and community : Don’t be afraid of the fetters that law can likely bring to you. Care not for violation of Nyaya-Dharma ( Law and Religion norms). Listen with Trust to my considered guidance and surrender to me alone. I will carry you through and assure thy just liberty.



With Regards
