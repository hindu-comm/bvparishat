Dear friends,

  

Good morning.  

I am attaching the Hindi translation of the next segment of my article

on Sugriva. I write these to help analyze the Ramayana characters  

for possible drama scripts for stage or cine. Ramayana is a large

drama and each of the characters has his/her own characterization

in the drama as created by the poet. Each of the characters is a natural

social personality. So is the analysis. I had posted the English article  

earlier, the Hindi translation is done by Sri Maneesh Srivastava, a poet  

from Kanpur now living in the US.  

The article is published in a journal called Garbhanal from Bhopal  

yesterday <https://www.garbhanal.com/2020-oct>

The English articles are archived at  

<https://vidyapeeth.dwarkamai.com/index.php/articles>

and the Hindi translations at  

<https://vidyapeeth.dwarkamai.com/index.php/phoca-downloads>

  

I create these articles to help popularize Valmiki as a poet among our youth.

Please feel free to give any feedback.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
