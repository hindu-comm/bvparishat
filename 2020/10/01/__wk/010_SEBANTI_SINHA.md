Respected Scholars,

                Shree Raghunath Temple Mss LIbrary, Jammu played a vital role by preserving highly valuable manuscripts of rare books and I have been personally benefitedmuch from many of those manuscripts. Now I want to give some information regarding the correctness of some manuscripts of that Library. So far as can recollect this library had the stock of five manuscripts statde to be of Chandralokahof Piyusvarsa Jaydevaof 13th Century. But on going through all those manuscripts it appeared to me that out of them three manuscripts bearingthe nomenclature as (A)Chandraloka - Jaydev Piyush Varsh_339_Gha_Alm\_ 2\_ Shlf\_ 4_Devanagari - Alankar Shastra; (B)Chandraloka - Jaydev Piyush Varsh_332_Gha_Alm_2 \_Shlf_4\_Devanagari - Alankar Shastra; & (C)Chandraloka - Jaidev_760\_ Gha \_Alm_4 \_Shlf_3\_Devanagari - Alankar Shastra are not of Chandralokah but of KUvalayananda by Appayya Dikshita. It will be helpfulfor all to find out the sameif the discrepancy is rectified by theauthority of that Library. I am sorry to say that as I do not know to whom the matter is actually to be itimated, I brought the matter to the notice of the reveredScholars of this Group so that the same reaches to the appropriate Authority.  

With regards.
