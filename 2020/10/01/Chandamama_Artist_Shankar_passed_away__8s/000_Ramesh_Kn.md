Sankar was the artist behind the signature painting of the Vikram and Vetala series, featured in Chandamama. He was the last surviving member of the original Chandamama design team. The iconic painting, along with his trade-mark signature that he was recognized by, was drawn in the 1960s. It is one of the thousands he created for Chandamama.
