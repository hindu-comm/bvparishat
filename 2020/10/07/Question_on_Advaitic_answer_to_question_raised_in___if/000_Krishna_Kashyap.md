Namaskaram,

  

I was teaching Bhagawadgita. someone asked me this question.

  

I would like to find where in which advaitic texts, arguments against very beginning portion of "mahA siddhanta"' of Sribhashyam, where Sri Ramanujacharya raises the question of " using shabda pramana any entity which is nirvishesha cannot be established".

I don't know which book to look. Is this in the works of Sri bellamkonda ramaraya kavi? or some other text? like advaita tattva sudha?

or is there any other author who has addressed this from Advaita perspective?

  

Any help is deeply appreciated.

see below where this comes up in sutra 1.1.1 in sribhashya right after beginning of mahasiddhanta.
