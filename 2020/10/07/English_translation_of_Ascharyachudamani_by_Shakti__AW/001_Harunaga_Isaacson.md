There is a translation by V. Raghavan, contained in the book of which you should be able to see

the bibliographical details here:<https://www.worldcat.org/title/wondrous-crest-jewel-in-performance-text-and-translation-of-the-ascaryacudamani-of-saktibhadra-with-the-production-manual-from-the-tradition-of-kutiyattam-sanskrit-drama/oclc/12832872/editions?referer=di&editionsView=true>

  

I don't know of an online PDF of the book. It may also be hard to buy a physical copy at the moment. Assuming that there are no copyright isues, I can upload a scan via [wetranfer.com](http://wetranfer.com) and post a link that will be valid for 7 days here. I will do so, if no one else provides a link for downloading or buying the book, or raises an objection, by tomorrow.
