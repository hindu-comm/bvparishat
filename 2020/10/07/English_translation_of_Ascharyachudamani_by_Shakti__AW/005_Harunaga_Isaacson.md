Many thanks to Ajit Gargeshwari-ji for pointing out that there is a translation by K.P.A. Menon.

A PDF of that book is on [archive.org](http://archive.org); it should be easily findable, but just in case here is a link

<https://archive.org/details/classicalsanskritliteratureofkeralavolume1ascharyachudamanimenonk.p.a.nagpublications_202003> .  
  

The book with V. Raghavan's translation can be downloaded from this wetransfer link:

Thanks once more,

Harunaga Isaacson
