"Vrinda Acharya explains the significance and philosophical dimension of the term 'Nada' in the Indian musical tradition and enumerates as to why it cannot be and should not be equated with 'Sound'. She explains the concepts of 'Nadabrahman', 'Nadopasana' and 'Nadayoga' giving several references from ancient Sanskrit texts on musicology and also from compositions of great saint composers."
