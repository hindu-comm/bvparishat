Namaste Nityanada Misra ji



1. Congratulations for recognizing the critical need to acknowledge the' Global' and ' Inhouse -India' damages caused to ' Hindu/India/Vedic/Sanskrit /Panini studies' over the last 100 plus years 



 by preferred use of ' Sanskrit- English-Lexicons' to the neglect of ' Inhouse guidance, tools and teaching -practicing traditions'.



 ( P.S. Pl. don’t read me wrong. I have great respect for the work done by scholars of west , more so at Harvard, Oxford, Guttenberg et al
for the cause of Sanskrit, right from early days and continuing.

 While one may differ on the drive, funding, framework of studies and theology driven theme- motives for translation, we have to gracefully and with gratitude acknowledge their academic

scholarly and sincere work for making available the original manuscripts in accessible print and digital formats.

 It was not their national or economic call and priority. Yet they did it and we are now the beneficiaries.

It is at least now for the native teams to take advantage of the ' resoruce made available' and move ahead to delvier the ' promissed good' than getting stuck at the blame game.)



2. The upcoming task to address stands clear. There is a need to revist at least 40,000 marked words ( at the minimum out of 1,86,000 words) in the MW 'Sanskrit-English'-dictionary' carrying Theology -flavored latinized/ romanized English translations provided by the lexicographer as ' personal preference'. Majority of 'secular and traditional scholars and teaching institutions/ resoruces seem to have no clue on the nature of the problem and impact of ' poison-pills' in these translation -equivalents.



The sample of 54 words indicated in the book is a teaser-taster- sampler-appetiser read for the poorly strategized and inadequately supported challenge ahead to be cleared.

This is not even speaking of the secondary challenges of rewriting the correction-upgrades out there for 200 plus years as translations and filling gaps with new models for 'teaching resources', yet to be formulated'.



3. Well, the 21 st century strategy for ' Sanskrit-Knowledge-Transmission systems (earlier model of Guru-Kuls controlled by Guru's and supported by Kshatriya-Kings ) is no more there; not even relevant to talk with any pride !



 The new model and soft-language-strategy of ' University Chairs
and publications' placed on table for this work are controlled by
deep strings and several other forces, factors and interests
demanding tangible time-scheduled growing return on investments in
predefined frames eyeing power controls. Simply ' language-heritage connected faith of communities' is a gold miners land in 21 st century, where the soft language words read differently.

The trending view is on English as an Indian langauge ! - <https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/english-is-an-indian-language/article32766945.ece>



Rajiv Malhotra has made many vocal articualtions, earlier, on this line topic ; vidoes available on social media links.



4. I some times wonder whther one learns from hisotry on how to repeat the errors or do mistakes in new ways or invent new ways of doing mistakes ! The following link may be an interesting read in this regard. <https://shiva4senate.com/dr-shiva-ayyadurai-stops-harvard-tamil-professorship-scam/>
