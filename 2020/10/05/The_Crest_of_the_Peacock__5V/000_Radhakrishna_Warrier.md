A friend just forwarded this book to me and I have just started reading it. It looks to be interesting. I have saved it in my Google Drive, and anyone can read/download the book from the above link to my Google Drive.

  

"The Crest of the Peacock - Non European Roots of Mathematics" byGeorge Gheverghese Joseph.

  

"*Like the crest of a peacock, like the gem*

*on the head of a snake, so is mathematics*

*at the head of all knowledge.*

—Vedanga Jyotisa (c. 500 bc)"

  

Chapter 10 of the book is titled*A Passage to Infinity: The Kerala Episode*. Therein is mentioned the Malayalam prose treatise*Yuktibhāṣa* (യുക്തിഭാഷ) written by Jyēṣṭhadēva around 1530 CE. I am interested in reading the book, both for its mathematical content and also to see how Malayalam gadyam (prose) of the 1530's looks like. At present I don't know how I can get a copy of the book, or if at all I will be able to get one. I knew about the*Yuktibhāṣa* long before reading *the Crest of the Peacock.* Here is a Wikipedia article on *Yuktibhāṣa*:
