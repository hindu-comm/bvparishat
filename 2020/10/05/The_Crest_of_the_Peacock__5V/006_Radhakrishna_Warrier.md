Thank you verymuch Shri Megh for the copy of Vedanga Jyotisha, and also the link to the blog of Shri C.K. Raju.

  

I went throughthe blog article of C.K. Raju forwarded by Shri Megh.
This is the first time I am reading any publication of Jacob. I didn't know that Jacob was a plagiarist. Nevertheless, *the Crest of the Peacock* is an interesting book. There could be plagiarized stuff in this book too. I haven't read it fully yet, so I don't know. But this is supposed to be a book on the history of non-European Mathematics, and it is not being presented as an original research work. So, unless there is unacknowledged verbatim reproduction of matter from other works, I am not sure if inclusion of what others have published previously can be considered as plagiarism in a book on history.

  

Thank you very much S/Shri Swapna and Sunil for the presentation ofProf. K. Ramasubramaniam. That was very informative. Thank you to the link to [archive.org](http://archive.org). Another member of this group also forwarded it privately to me. The manuscript is written in Malayalam script. Of course it is a copy of the original work. I wonder what script was used in the original work. It is said that Ezhuthachan was the originator of the modern Malayalam script. But if the Yuktibhasha was written in the 1530's and if the script was modern Malayalam script, then the script predates Ezhuthachan.

  

Regards,  
Radhakrishnan
