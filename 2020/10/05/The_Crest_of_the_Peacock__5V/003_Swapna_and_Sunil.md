Dear Mr. Warrier,

  

Thank you for this. I am not sure if Prof. K. Ramasubramaniam is in this group, but the professor does a lot of work in this field (Kerala astronomers). He may know more about finding theprose treatise Yuktibhāṣa.

  

Here is a relevant recent presentationof his: <http://www.ircc.iitb.ac.in/IRCC-Webpage/rnd/PDF/IIT_Bombay_Research_Dissemination_Award_K_Ramasubramanian.pdf>
