Not as detailed/precise as what Dr. Shankar said, but this verse occurs in Vidyākara's Subhāṣita-ratna-kośa (number 1506 in the HOS edition), attributed to Vallaṇa (as in the photograph: there's also another photo [here](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vallana_-_Haagweg_14,_Leiden.JPG)), and Ingalls translates it as:

  

Blessed is the wise man who clearly knows  
the ways of all the universe  
and happy likewise is the fool  
who never doubts his wisdom.  
But let a man not fall between  
to suffer doubts of right and wrong  
that rise from the workings of a mind that's sown  
with just a bit of knowledge.
