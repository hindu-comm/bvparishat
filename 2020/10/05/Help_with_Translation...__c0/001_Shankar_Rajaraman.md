Namaste

As I understand it -  

"Worthy of salutation (नमस्यः) is the wise man (प्रज्ञावान्) by whom has been fully grasped (परिकलित) the nature (गतिः) of the three worlds (लोकत्रय). (At the other end is) the fool (स मूर्खः) who too (अपि) is happy (सुखी) since in his heart (हृदय) he is completely sure, without a second thought (अद्वैत), about the greatness (महिमा) in himself (स्वगत). But let there not be someone (अयं मा भूत् कश्चित्) whose mental composure/surity about things (मनःसमाधान) is combined (किर्मीरित) with insufficient intellect (प्रतनुमति) and who is therefore rendered helpless (विधुर) on account of the excessive doubt (अतिसन्देह) about what is correct and what incorrect (सदसत्) - a doubt arising (उन्मीलत्) from such a combination of surity+imperfect intellect.

  

Overall purport: It is better to be a wise man or a fool rather than someone in between who, because of his or her doubts, is never sure.
