This is an extremely important work. Assuming that the basis of this work goes back to Kāśakr̥tsna, who is mentioned by Patañjali, we may get a glimpse of his system of grammar. This is an extensive work, and I hope some Vaiyākaraṇa will take this as a research project to study it in detail. With best wishes,
