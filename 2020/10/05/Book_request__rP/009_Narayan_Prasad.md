Thank you Ajit ji.  

  

About 25 yearsago I saw the Kannada script edition in a book form. That time I wanted to purchase it from Deccan College. But it was already out of stock.

On having a bird's eye view of all the three editions, the Hindi edition appears to be best arranged in a systematic way.

The rare Kannada script edition is available as a hard copy here:
