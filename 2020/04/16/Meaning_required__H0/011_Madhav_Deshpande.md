Dear Sampath Kumar Ji,

  

  Thanks for providing a link to the Professor Palsule Felicitation Volume. I have an article in this volume, but I had lost my physical copy during my move from Michigan to California. The name of the volume Amr̥tamandākinī reminded me of a Sanskrit poem composed by Professor Palsule that had the title Saṃskr̥ta-Mandākinī, and that used to be sung often by his daughter in various events in Pune. With best regards,
