As said already Kashika is Vritti and it is not Sutra. It is Ashtadhyayi that gives Sutra. Anyway पञ्च नापिताः does not mean sons of five barbers, but only five barbers. In Kashika, there is no such a sentence, but some word पापनापितः under AS 2.1.54 in काशिका which means sinful barber. Is it you wanted meaning of?
