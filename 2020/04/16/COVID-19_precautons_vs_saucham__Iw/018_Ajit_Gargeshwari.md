Please don't mix Dharma Shastra with Govt Covid guidelines. To make shastras relevant lets not create a view or start justifying derogatory practices in the name of Sauca. Subtle thinking is not restricted or need not be equated to justifying wrong and derogative practices Lets not mix shastras to into everything. All have their own place. When quoted out of context leads to greater misunderstanding than understanding. Lawyers need not love truth. A lawyers argues his view. Dharma loves truth and may one be guided by trut.
