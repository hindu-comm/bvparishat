The context of COVID need not be taken to

*prove* any dharma-shAstra prescriptions.

It serves as a strong, and beautiful, analogy  

for truths at other levels.

  

Science sometimes actually arrives at what our shAstra-s said long ago.

The importance/power of neem or turmeric  

or certain *yogAsana*-s/*prANAyAma*-s are some easy examples.

  

Sometimes it comes tangentially - handshakes are not best always.

But there could be other reasons too that  

science as of today may not even conjure.

  

Sometimes science provides nice analogies/correlations.

A flying aeroplane casts its shadow on the ground.

For an uninformed thinker, the moving shadow looks "tangible",

rather than the plane flying at a higher plane, for he could not imagine  

that an object could be flying so too high.

There are things that uninformed thinkers cannot even suspect,

but may nevertheless be true.

  

All this was said not to assert that what all our shAstra-s say

are all "scientific" (howsoever we may define the word).

But to caution that it makes less sense to assert that

there can be no science as cannot be adjudged by today's standards.

  

Yes, there are scientists, good and great ones at that,  

who are humble too!  

But lawyers convinced and confident of a sort of omniscience of "today's science"

are usually more assertive and aggressive.

  

We have to tolerate the intolerant sometimes.
