We swear by our constitution;

has the constitution not been amended scores of times?

  

We stand by democracy.

In how many countries is democracy faring very very well?

Aren't we yet accommodative of many things

high in ideals and low in performance?

  

The only things we may attempt is - to recognise  

where we have slipped from the ideal  

and what can be done about it now.

  

If we have an open mind, we can know the foibles of others,

and more importantly, analyse how and where we are likely to err too.

Rather than ruthless (and endless) remonstrances,  

let us help ourselves introspect.
