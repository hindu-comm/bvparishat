Sri. Ajit Gargeshvari ji has a point. Let us not read into "apa uoaspRshya" hand washing required for keeping Covid at bay. Shrotriyasare not necessarily hygienically clean. Is it not acceptedwhen the old sacred thread is discarded? जीर्णतन्तुं कश्मलं *मलदूषितम्* विसृजामि"

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
