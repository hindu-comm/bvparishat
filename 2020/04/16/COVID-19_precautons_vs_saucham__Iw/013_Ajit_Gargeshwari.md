'Is the cynical pessimistic statement that reinforces the demonizing of the social distancing" . waht I wanted to say is lets not quote Covid adavice and start practicing derogatory social distancing that is practiced and say and say such practices are sanctified by our shastras. If there was or is anything good about such practices they have lost their original context and significance centuries back. The way such practices remain need reforms or changes. Swaccha Bharath was the first right step. One doesnot need a dharam shastra advisory not to go close to a person who has cold or cough or visible sickness as there is a chance of catching infection.
