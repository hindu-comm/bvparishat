S'oucha includes physical cleanliness but not limited to it. Scholars in the list are aware that mrita -as'oucha, jaata - as'oucha etc. are super-physical as'ouchas that have an impact on whether or how a karma /ritual can be performed in that condition or not. Some of such as'oucha can be partially explained in terms of emotions and degree of intensity of them based on the degree and type of kinship. We see similarities to this in traditions like those of Judaism:  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bereavement_in_Judaism#Mourning> 

In fact, this is what is conveniencing communication between Indians settled abroad and their neighbors when they want to tell the neighbors about their mritaas'oucha practices.

  

But s'oucha, though not limited to it, includes physical cleanliness, not following physical cleanliness while following acts of s'oucha as a rule from the rule book is certainly not correct, inconsistent, foolish and what is described as "the dreary desert sand of dead habit" by Sri Rabindranath Tagore.

  

Let us remember that Sri Rabindranath Tagore was coming from a reformation movement Brahmo Samaj. The poem quoted is from his Gitanjali which is his own English translation of selected Bengali poems from among those he wrote for the Brahmo Samaj prayers.

  

This particular line

  

"Where the clear stream of reason has not lost it's way  
into the dreary desert sand of dead habit."

  

succinctly articulates the central spirit of all the 19th century reformation movements in India like Arya Samaj and Brahmo Samaj.

  

All these movements while vehemently opposing the behaviors resulting fromthe dreary desert sand of dead habit,

  

were equally vehemently trying to bring out the clear stream of reason that lost it's way into the dreary desert sand of these dead habits.

  

There are a big number of traditional 'Hindus' including Vedic scholars who follow s'oucham without the inconsistencies such as physical uncleanliness. Vedic scholars among them are aware in a scholarly way about the clear stream of reason behind what they do.

  

There certainly are those who have inconsistencies and do not even think of the stream of reason behind what they do as a rule and as such do not think about how their uncleanly habits and surroundings are inconsistent with that stream of reason.

  

But to cite these ignorant followers of the dead habit to obstruct a discussion of the clear stream of reason is not fair.
