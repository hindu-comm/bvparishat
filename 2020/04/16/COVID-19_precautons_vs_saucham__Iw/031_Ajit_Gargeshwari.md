"Textual mentions or evidences of social distancing are deemed, in historical interpretation" This can be an area of study no doubt.  
  
Social distancing in places of worship and also in private worship was tool to used to spread discrimination and discontent in society. I have seen highly educated Hindus who follow unhygienic practices but keep washing their hands and feet that is what i meant when I said the opposite is true. Social discrimination has led caste discrimination in society. It has also led to oppression. Social discrimination done in the past should not be mixed with Social distancing which is needed as of now to control the spread of Carona
