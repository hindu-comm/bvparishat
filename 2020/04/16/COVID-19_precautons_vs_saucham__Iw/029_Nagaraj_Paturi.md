\>I don'tsee why unhealthy practicesof the past need to be defended and given new twists

  

Not a single unhealthy practice is being defended.

  

None of the explanations provided is a new twist.

  

If at all anything, misinterpretations of the past are being corrected.

  

For example, when textual mentions or evidences of social distancing are deemed, in historical interpretation, to be evidences of emotional distancing, social discrimination or social hierarchy, the new awareness that social distancing need not necessarily imply emotional distancing, social discrimination or social hierarchy is expected to help such people that their earlier historical interpretations of textual mentions or evidences of social distancing as evidences of emotional distancing, social discrimination or social hierarchy is mistaken.
