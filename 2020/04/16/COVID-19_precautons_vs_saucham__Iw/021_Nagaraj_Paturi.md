That I was not differing with the good intentions side of Sri Ajit Gargeswari'sfirst post and my balancing of that with my agreement with the good intentions of Sri Jammalamadaka Srinivas garu in his Hindupedia blogpostthat I posted to initiate the thread would have been easily understood looking at a similar balance in Sri Rabindranath Tagore's quote I used.

  

If such balance is not understood , there is no point in continuing the discussion from my side.
