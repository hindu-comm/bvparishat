If we harken back to the pristineness of the original prescriptions in letter and spirit,

we will know what true *AcAra* was expected to be,

rather than going by the degenerate forms (in part/in full - mostly the former, or often missing the spirit)  

current now or in the recent (or sometimes even the distant) past.

  

"With the passage of a long duration of time,

yoga got lost, Oh Arjuna", grieved even Krishna.

  

How is *AcAra* defined? Rangapriya Swamiji often used to quote this verse:  

पञ्चेन्द्रियस्य देहस्य बुद्धेश्च मनसस्तथा ।

द्रव्य-देश-क्रियाणां च शुद्धिराचार इष्यते ॥

  

And further, with respect to a *sanyasin*, seven things are supposed to be white/bright.

The list includes the garment, even his teeth etc.

  

It can be universally accepted that those who knowingly (or even unknowingly)  

violate the rules of an institution are not, after all, to be considered as  

authentic representatives of that institution.

  

Our discussions can do well to exclude inauthentic representations,

and examine the utilities/futilities of only authentic ones.
