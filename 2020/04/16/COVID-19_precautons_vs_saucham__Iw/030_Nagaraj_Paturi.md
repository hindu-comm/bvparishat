\>I agree with most of what's said by the professor except for the above statement for which the opposite is true.

  

What is the opposite that Sri Ajit -ji thinks is true ?

  

My statement is

  

"There are a big number of traditional 'Hindus' including Vedic scholars who follow s'oucham without the inconsistencies such as physical uncleanliness. Vedic scholars among them are aware in a scholarly way about the clear stream of reason behind what they do. "

  

By opposite, does it mean

  

"All Hindus including Vedic scholars follow s'oucham with inconsistencies such as physical uncleanliness. No Vedic scholar is aware in a scholarly way about the clear stream of reason behind what they do" ?

  

or "Some Hindus including Vedic scholars follow s'oucham without
inconsistencies such as physical uncleanliness. But they are not big in number? Some Vedic scholars are aware in a scholarly way about the clear stream of reason behind what they do. But they are not big in number? "
