COVID-19 precautons vs saucham  

  

World Health Organization (WHO) has prescribed certain precautionary measures to avoid getting affected by the COVID-19 virus. They are - - Wash hands regularly and thoroughly with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. - Maintain social distance i.e. maintain 1 meter (3 feet) between oneself and another. - Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. - Practice respiratory hygiene. That means covering once mouth and nose with bent elbow or tissue while coughing and sneezing. These precautions are not new to people who are aware of the niyamas of Śaucham prescribed in various dharma sastra works. Śaucham means purity. In dharma sastra works there will be a separate division for means of maintaining Śaucham. In sanatana tradition maintaining inner Śaucha i.e. maintaining peace of mind is given prominence. The techniques of bhāhya śaucha are also aimed at attaining inner śaucha. Common bhāhya śaucha practices are bathing, washing hands, performing āchamanam (taking small quantities of water with or without recitation of certain mantras), prokśaṇa (sprinkling water with or without recitation of certain mantras), not touching another person without valid reason etc. The COVID-19 precautions are very much similar to the bhāhya śaucha niyamas which are being practiced by practiicioners of sanatana traditions since time immemorial.

### Washing hands - Respiratory hygiene and Avoid touching eyes etc.

The word repeatedly used for washing hands in works of dharma sastras is ‘apa upaspṛśya’ which literally means touching water with hands. But practically is means to wash hands. For example, in āpastamba śrauta sutras there is this sutra which prescribes washing hands at certain scenarios. The sutra is -

> raudra-rākṣasa-niṛrutī-paitṛka-smaraṇeṣu chedana bhedana khanana dahan > nirasana ātmābhisparśaneṣu apa upaspṛśet

If one recollects anything related to rudra, rākṣasa (anything negative in nature), the word ‘niṛrutī’ which means same as rākṣasa and anything related to pitṛ devtas, then one should wash hands. Not only that after performing acts such as cutting down anything, splitting anything, burying anything, leaving anything far or touching one’s own body parts such as chest, mouth, nose, ear etc. one is prescribed to wash hands. So, if one is prescribed to wash hands after touching mouth, eyes etc. it means that it is better to not touch them without specific reason.

> kṣutvā bhuktvā suptvā ca....punarācāmet

Not only this but even after sneezing, coughing, waking up from sleep etc. one is said to perform āchamanam. And before performing āchamanam one should wash his hands. In another dharma sastra work one is instructed to thoroughly wash hands, legs and mouth before having a meal. Even after laughing or crying excessively one is instructed to wash hands and perform āchamanam. Prāṇayāma is another wonderful technique to maintain respiratory hygiene. In relation to repiratory hygiene, prāṇayāma helps to maintain better respiratory system which leads to the reduction of sneezing and coughing.

### Social distancing

Social distancing means maintaining distance form one another which results in avoidance of touch. In sanatana traditions people are instructed to avoid touching one another in various occasion. The word 'jātāśaucha' and ‘mṛtāśaucha' are quite popular in the circles of sanatana dharma practitioners. Families are prescribed to maintain social distance after birth and death in one’s families. The minimum duration is 11 days. There are different rules of social distance for jātāśaucha and mṛtāśaucha. In caraka Samhita one is prescribed to maintain distance from a diseased person. Among the traditional families of sanatana dharma people have a practice to avoid touch of another person. Because avoiding touch is considered to be among the means of indriyanigraha. Indriyanigraha is a constituent part of dharma and moksha. Thus, maintaining distance is a virtue of sanatana tradition which was demonized by many modern thinkers.
