Unhygienic practices anywhere in the world have their origin in the lack of care for hygiene. They are not degenerates of any past practices, good or bad.

  

Past practices started with good hygienic intent can *inconsistently get mixed with* such unhygienic habits.

  

Past practices started with good hygienic intent are not the origin, source or cause of the present u**n**hygienic habits .Lack of care for hygiene is the source or cause of the present u**n**hygienic habits. Mixing of these two happens with hose who do not understand and /or follow the good hygienic intent behind the past practices.

  

People following the past hygienic practices without any inconsistent mix of unhygienic practices are feeling vindicated during the present developments.

  

People following the past hygienic practices with an inconsistent and contradicting mix of unhygienic practices have no right to feel any such vindication.
