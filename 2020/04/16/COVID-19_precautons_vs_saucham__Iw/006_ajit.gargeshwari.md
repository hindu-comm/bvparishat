Sauca lost its good intentions to keep one body and develop good hygienic practices to being unhygienic and further led to the practice of untouchability a noble ideal that did deteriorate over a period of time. if they were ever praticed in letter and spirit.  

  

I see people in my community simply washing hands when the touch any one but live in unclean surroundings. In south India one cannot touch idol of Gods at home or in the temple without having a bath. There were great ideals when they started and deteriorated over a period of time.
