Sri Gargeshwari,

  

Your comment on Shastraas ‘appears’ logical while it is not. You say one does not need Shastras to not go near someone who has cold. Now how do you ‘know’ not to go near someone who has cold? There is some learning you have gone through in knowing that. Someone who has not gone through that learning will not ‘know’, and will not act like you. It appears to me that Dr Paturi’s note laying out Saucha requirements is to re-educate people who do not know, like you. Why do you react negatively to that? Is it because you somehow believe that ancient Hindus would/could not know so many things, though they formed a knowledge society?

  

Regards,

Krishna Kumar Pillalamarri
