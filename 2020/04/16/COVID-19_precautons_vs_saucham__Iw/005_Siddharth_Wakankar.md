Dr.Irene,

  

You are abdolutely correct.

  

The gullible Indians were way.laid by the British educational system to such an extent that we forgot our basic age old Sanskaras and blindly started following the western style.

  

It is reflected in such a degrading manner that the westernised Indian intellectuals,including some irthodox families,take pride in blowing off the candle on the Birthday cake to celebrate their dear one's Happy Birthday. They conveniently connive at or blissfully innocent of the fact that we are the worshippers of Agni or Tejas to whom the first Rgvedic rk is addressed.

  

Less said is better more said is worst .

  

What a cultural fall.
