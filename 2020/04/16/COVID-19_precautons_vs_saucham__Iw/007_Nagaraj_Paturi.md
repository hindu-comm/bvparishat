Gurudeb Sri Rabindranath Tagore

  

Wished for an awakening into

  

# "Where the clear stream of reason has not lost it's way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit."

Sri Ajit-ji is pointing out ' the dreary desert sand of dead habit '

  

Covid-19 situation is helping us realize

  

' the clear stream of reason '

  

that

  

' lost its way.'

  

Today people relizethat Social Distancing does not imply a. Emotional distancing b. Social discrimination c. Social hierarchy

  

Today we are asking people to avoid a. Emotional distancing b. Social discrimination c. Social hierarchy while maintaining Social Distancing

  

We are able to see that our great valiant divine Covid warriors The medical personnel , sanitary personnel and security personnel are at some places being ill treated by those who are not capable of handling such nuanced understanding of the distinctions between care and attitude.

  

Those who demonized the traditional 'Hindu' / Vedic practices of hygiene projected that social distancing always implies a. Emotional distancing b. Social discrimination c. Social hierarchy, there can be no other meaning for social distancing.

  

The present situation is helping people realize clear stream of reason and pointing out that wherever it lost its way into dreary desert sand of dead habit it was an aberration born out of the ignorance and personality problem of the practitioner.
