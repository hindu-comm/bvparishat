There are a big number of traditional 'Hindus' including Vedic scholars who follow s'oucham without the inconsistencies such as physical uncleanliness. Vedic scholars among them are aware in a scholarly way about the clear stream of reason behind what they do.

I agree with most of what's said by the professor except for the above statement for which the opposite is true. I don'tsee why unhealthy practicesof the past need to be defended and given new twists Thanks for your view it was important for me
