Even within one's own body, say the Dharma-shAstra-s,

there are limbs which are *medhya*, and limbs which are not *medhya*
(and in this context/that context).  

Such high sensitivity, as directed towards and dictated by specific goals/objectives

is evidenced in too few civilisations.

  

All historians of science have rebuked the dharma-shAstra-s for

excluding *vaidya*-s from events like *shrAddha*-s.

Now we know that doctors are susceptible to numerous influences.

This by no means implies that the doctoral profession was spurned,

or that the medical science was not allowed to grow.

  

The distribution of professions among the "castes"  

often ensured there were no unwanted contaminations.  

  

And everyone was wont to hold in high esteem his own kula-vidyA,

and that is perfectly understandable.

  

Kalidasa himself says

*sarvasyApi kula-vidyA bahumatA,*

as too

*pashu-mAraNa-karma-dAruNo'py anukampA-mRdureva shrotriyaH.*
