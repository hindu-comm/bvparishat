Exactly as Professor Wakankar said. A culture that has deeply enquired into all the nuances of life and death came into contact with a culture where such matters were not only muddled, but where the very idea that these are deep subjects of enquiry was missing until fairly recently. Or missing in the mainstream, maybe that's a better way of putting it.
