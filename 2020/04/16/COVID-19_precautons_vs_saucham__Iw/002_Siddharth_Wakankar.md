In our childhood,we were instructed not to touch even our relative sitting beside us while doing puja or taking good. This was meticulously practised in orthodox families in the bye.gone days,but due to the false notions created by English medium schools our kids just forgot these necessary practices and see now the same age.old practices are being prescribed to be practised.

  

Prof.Paturi, you are rendering yeoman services to us no words are adequate to express our deep sense of gratitude .
