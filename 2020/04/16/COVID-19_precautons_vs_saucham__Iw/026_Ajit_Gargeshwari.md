I agree with the views of other scholars who have posted on this thread. Most are familiar with what I was trying to say. Probably one should experience, live in such an environment to know what I meant when I said "people in my community simply washing hands when the touch any one or even touch certain type of cooked food but live in unclean surroundings " If sauca is not related to hygiene which was a part Swachh bharat Mission what is Saucha then? With this I leave this thread as of now unless there is something more for me to add.
