The article was not written with the pretext of advicing people to practice. It was written to trigger introspection and getting to know some good practices which even today many shraddhalus practice. And agreeing to the fact that asprusyata which was demonized is actually a virtue.

And kindly do not draw a parallel line between swacha Bharath and saucham. Saucham is not related to only cleanliness. It is way superior to it.
