The notions of *sandhyakṣara* and *saṃyoga* are completely separate.
According to Pāṇini's rule \[*halo 'nantarāḥ saṃyogaḥ*\], the notion of *saṃyoga* applies only to consecutive consonants, and not to vowels.
While *a+a* can result in *ā*, phonetically *ā* is a single long vowel and does not have two phonetic components. Such dual components do exist in the vowels *ai* and *au*, and these are phonetically called *dvivarṇa* in many Śikṣā/Prātiśākhya texts. Even so, the term *saṃyuktākṣara* is never used to refer to vowels.
