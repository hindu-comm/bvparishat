Therefore the vartik अकारस्य निवृतोपदेशे आकारस्य ग्रहणार्थः gains all the more importance. If the effort invested to phonate अ is changed from vivruta to samvruta under the guise of the final sutra अअ it automatically follows that the आ would not be phonated as Panini visualized it to be phonated.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
