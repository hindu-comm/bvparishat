Dear Vidwans,

  

How truthful is it to rest the interpretation of the Ashtadhyayi on the pratishakhyas or the Paniniya Shiksha which have not been composed by Panini.

  

By so viewing the Ashtadhyayi are we not causing injustice to the tradition of Panini, Katyayana and Patanjali. It is like attacking Euclidean Geometry from the point of view of Non Euclidean geometry where the premises are different.

  

The last Sutra of the Ashtadhyayi viz., अअ can be interpreted in more than one way. Then why has the tradition after Patanjali interpreted the last sutra in one chosen way to the exclusion of others?

  

I say this because I have exclusively worked on the Maheshwar Sutras for the last fifteen years and evolved sutras to instruct the Barakhadi suffixed with Swarita vowels. The Sutras also separately instruct the suffixed short and long vowels.

  

For ready reference

It is high time that we reconsider and restructure our view so as to give justice both to the Panini, Katyayana and Patanjali tradition as well as to the Vedic Pratishakya tradition which protected Vedic literature through the ages through uninterrupted transmission.

  

"Living a Lie: We Deceive Ourselves to Better Deceive Others"  

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
