Dear Madhav,  
  
\> This becomes even more likely in view of the Aśokan variant \*prasada\*.  
  
Exactly, I completely agree, the transmitted consonant cluster with "r" is a very strong argument.  
  
That is why I have quoted the variants "aśok. (girnār) *pāsaṁḍa*-, (kālsī) *pāśaṁḍa*-, (shāhbāzgaṛhī) *praṣaṁḍa*-, (mānsehrā) *prasada*-" even twice.  
  
With best wishes,  
Roland
