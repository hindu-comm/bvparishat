A lot could be said about Prof. Kannan's last e-mail. I shall be as brief as possible.  
  
First of all, I would like to recall the context in which I refered to **a single entry** in Mayrhofer's dictionary (KEWA).  
L Srinivas wrote:  
  
“my query had to do with 'पाषण्ड'. I would like to understand its origin. Any pointers would be appreciated.”  
  
I then pointed to the entry in Mayrhofer's dictionary (KEWA) that I consider relevant. Prof. Kannan has criticized this “pointer” in several e-mails with the following words:   
  
“To assert wild links and ask for better answers may not be the best way to progress.” – “One can start a hypothesis only upon some real/sensible/plausible foundation. Or else add a caveat that the proposition is at best conjectural. Wild guesses may not be best placed in dictionaries. Is it too difficult to throw a mild hint by adding a question mark after a wild suggestion?” – “But the task expected of his commenders and recommenders is to carry things to logical/more logical conclusions if possible; to supplement and complement his work, rather than merely compliment, and rest at that.”  
  
I do not need to reiterate my answers here. Of course, there can be no question of “wild links”, “wild guesses”, or “wild suggestion” at all if you know the dictionary or at least have read and understood the entry on *pāṣaṇḍa*.  
  
In his last e-mail, Prof. Kannan now refers to a critical review by the German Indologist Paul Thieme, whom he calls “a giant scholar”. One may or may not see it that way, but that is not the point, because it is not about authorities, but about arguments. It goes without saying that such a monumental work like Mayrhofer's two etymological dictionaries (KEWA and EWA) is a challenge to criticism. Criticism is part of the very essence of research. Thieme himself ends his critical review as follows:  
  
“Mayrhofer is not a man of pat answers, but a pensively brooding scholar. His work provokes thought, invites discussion, challenges criticism. We cordially wish him strength and energy for finishing his enterprise. We thank him warmly for a most valuable *instrument de travail* that, but for him and his enthusiasm, we should not have at our disposal.”  
  
Now Thieme's own etymological approaches have by no means remained unchallenged among scholars, which in turn is perfectly normal. I could now go through Thieme's criticisms of Mayrhofer in detail, but that is not necessary here. Whether Mayrhofer speaks of “Sanskrit” or “Altindoarisch”, or whether he uses too many abbreviations (I do not want to imagine how many pages his two dictionaries \[of now about 2500 and 2700 pages each!\] would have covered without the use of these abbreviations), does not change the substance of his entry to *pāṣaṇḍa* in the least.  
  
I could now also discuss Prof. Kannan's understanding of Thieme's review in detail, but I will spare myself that. Apart from the fact that Thieme **has not reviewed** Mayrhofer’s “Kurzgefaßtes etymologisches Wörterbuch des Altindischen (KEWA)/A Concise Etymological Sanskrit Dictionary“ (Heidelberg 1956–1976) at all here – this is the dictionary I referred to –, but the first 11 fascicles of Mayrhofer’s second dictionary “Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Altindoarischen (EWA)” which is not a second edition of the older dictionary, but a completely new dictionary), just one example is sufficient. Prof. Kannan remarks:  
  
“Naive is the supposition that the antiquity of a language is settled just by its earliest literary attestation.”  
  
With this he wants to paraphrase the following criticism by Thieme:  
  
“They support the naïve supposition that a language is only as old as its earliest literary attestation.”  
  
“They” here means: designations like “Middle Indic”, “Middle-Indo-Aryan”, or “Old-Indo-Aryan”. Thieme thus criticizes here certain language **designations**, because in his opinion they suggest something wrong or at least “support” a “naïve supposition.” It goes without saying that Thieme does not accuse Mayrhofer of sharing what he considers to be a “naïve supposition”; Thieme merely criticizes what he considers to be a misleading **terminology**.  
  
Apart from this, with the first two volumes of his second dictionary (EWA), Mayrhofer has presented a complete dictionary of the “older language” (= lexemes that are first attested in the Vedic literature or, at most, by ancient grammarians), while the third volume deals with the younger language (= first attestation not before the epics or the law books). Those who do not share this historical perspective on language will find this etymological approach fundamentally wrong. The rest will find it useful in principle.  
  
One last remark. The reference to an essay, a study or a dictionary entry is no more and no less than a pointer to a possible source of information or knowledge. At best, this source of information or knowledge “provokes thought, invites discussion, challenges criticism” (Thieme). It is not meant as a reference to an irrefutable truth, even if it has been expressed by an actual or merely supposed authority.  
  
It is quite simple: Ignore the entry in Mayrhofer's dictionary or read it (after all, it is less than a whole page) and form your own opinion if you are able to (not everyone is a linguist). Why should I justify the reference to a dictionary, especially since its follow-up work is designated as "a most valuable *instrument de travail* \[= working tool\]" even by Thieme?  
  
  
With this, I say farewell to this thread.
