The expectation of attestation etc. is only to avoid *anavasthA-doSha.*

One could as well allay all apprehensions by saying all is *yAdRcchika* too!

  

One can start a hypothesis only upon some real/sensible/plausible foundation.

Or else add a caveat that the proposition is at best conjectural.  

Wild guesses may not be best placed in dictionaries.

Is it too difficult to throw a mild hint by adding a question mark  

after a wild suggestion?
