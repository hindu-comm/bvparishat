I don't, at all, mean to nitpick but thefirst post had included "**far** removed in time":"Are Manu and Asoka far removed in time that there's this difference in meaning"?  

  

I hope it is not too unreasonable, even without invoking exact science (which, in my view, was not invoked by me in my previous post in this thread), to be skeptical about the rigour of any attempt to postdate the chronological epoch of Manu (and by implication, Manusmrti) based *only* on the *meaning-of-pāṣaṇḍa-in-edicts-versus-Manusmrti*hypothesis*.* This may or may not be the attempt of anyone in this thread but the "far removed in time" got me thinking on these lines.



It is also is in the same thread that we had this example from Dr. Deshpande: "This is **perhaps** similar to the interpretation of the compound श्रमणब्राह्मणम् in the Mahabhashya verses its use in Ashokan inscriptions.For Patanjali, this comes under येषां च विरोध: शाश्वतिक:, while the use in Ashokan inscriptions is neutral.". If this example can be admitted as-is, even if only argument's sake, then should there be any ground to require the difference between epochs of Manu and Edicts to be any more than the difference between epochs of Patanjali and Edicts?

  

To reiterate (and apologies in advance for anyone who does not require it): how methodologically sound and reasonable is it to use differences in usage of a term to infer anything conclusive (even if only as supportingevidence) about the difference in time between the different usages?If B uses a term very differently from A, can**just**that data-point**alone**:

Can it not be possible that different meanings were used for the same word simultaneously (or nearly so) for which evidence is now either 'lost' or 'undiscovered'?

  

Pranaam,
