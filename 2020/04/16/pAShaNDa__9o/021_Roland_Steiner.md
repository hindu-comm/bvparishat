\> While *pārṣada* does not seem to have a negative meaning as it is used in the Nirukta or in Aśokan  
\> inscriptions, the words *pāṣaṇḍa/pākhaṇḍa* developed a negative meaning.  
  

Yes, Madhav, the meanings given by Mayrhofer also correspond to this:  
  
German "Ketzer, Ketzerei" = English "heretic, heresy".  
  
But:  
  
"aśok. (girnār) *pāsaṁḍa-*, (kālsī) *pāśaṁḍa-*, (shāhbāzgaṛhī) *praṣaṁḍa*-, (mānsehrā) *prasada-* (etc.) Sekte \[= Engl. "sect"\]."  
  
Best,  
Roland
