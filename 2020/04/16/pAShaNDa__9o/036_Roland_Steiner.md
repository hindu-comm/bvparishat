There is no question of that. Mayrhofer's "A Concise Etymological Sanskrit Dictionary" comprises in three volumes more than 2500 pages and presents and discusses the state of research of its time. Of course, Mayrhofer gives information about the literature in which a word is testified, and in what form and in what meaning. He does not give exact references to individual texts but instead references to the relevant secondary literature where everything else can be found. - Imagine how voluminous his "concise" dictionary would have been if he had also given all the references of a word. And besides, it would never have been completed. To my knowledge, there is no comparable modern etymological dictionary on Sanskrit, apart from his own later dictionary "Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Altindoarischen" in two volumes (Heidelberg 1992 and 1996) of more than 1700 pages.  
  
And please remember: this is not an essay or a monograph on the etymology of *pāṣaṇḍa*, but a **dictionary**. On the contrary, I find it quite amazing how much information there is about this single word. I think this is an excellent starting point for further reflection and research on the etymology of this word.

  
  
  
\> Wild guesses may not be best placed in dictionaries.  
  

It is not a wild guess.

  
  
  
\> Is it too difficult to throw a mild hint by adding a question mark after a wild suggestion?  
  

He actually uses question marks very often. In the case of the *pāṣaṇḍa* entry, he does not make a positive assertion, but expresses a presumption. Therefore, I wrote:  
  
"Manfred Mayrhofer **assumes** 'despite phonetic difficulties' a connection with \[...\]".  
  
In his own words: "wohl kaum von *parṣat* \[...\] zu trennen" ("is hardly separable from parṣat \[...\]").  
  
So from his point of view it is not a matter of assured facts, but of a strong presumption despite certain problems.  
  
Best,
