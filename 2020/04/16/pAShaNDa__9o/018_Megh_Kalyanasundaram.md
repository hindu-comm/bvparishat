I see one of the queries in the first post of this thread as being quite Olivelle'sque.

A subsequent point that "this is perhaps similar to the interpretation of the compound श्रमणब्राह्मणम् in the Mahabhashya verses its use in Ashokan inscriptions" is, in the above context, interesting to me.

If one were to simply connect these two dots, without necessarily endorsing any, I wonder if one might next see the question: are Patanjali and Asoka, hence, "far removed in time that there's this difference in meaning" (of श्रमणब्राह्मणम्)?

Even Dr. Olivelle had once written: “Patañjali can be dated with some precision and certainty to the middle of the second century bce.” (Olivelle 1999:xxxiii)

More fundamentally, how methodologically sound and reasonable is it to use differences in usage of a term to infer anything conclusive (even if only as supportingevidence) about the difference in time between the different usages?

If B uses a term very differently from A, can **just** that data-point **alone**:

> 1\. tell anyone anything, to any reasonable degree, about the quantum > of time elapsed between the usages of B and A? >
> 2.tell anyone anything whose usage was earlier?

(These questions are not directed at anyone in this thread)
