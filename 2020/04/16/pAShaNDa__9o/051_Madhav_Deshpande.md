Dear Roland,

  

  You referred to Thieme's assessment of Yāska's "etymology. Here is the passage from Thieme's review of Mayrhofer:

  During my student days at the University of Pennsylvania, I was fortunate to study with Thieme for a year, and I remember him saying that while Renou was careless like Yāska, he was careful like Pāṇini. His reviews of Renou were equally critical. I remembered this in connection with the passage about Yāska and Pāṇini in his review of Mayrhofer. I have great respect for Thieme, but with all of his negative comments about Yāska and Mayrhofer, their contribution to scholarship on Sanskrit is very great indeed, and I tend to agree with Mayrhofer's"suspicion" that the words *pāsaṇḍa/pāṣaṇḍa/pākhaṇḍa* have some etymological connection with Skt. *pārṣada*. This becomes even more likely in view of the Aśokan variant *prasada*. The variants in the Northwestern inscriptions generally seem to be closer to Sanskrit in retaining consonantclusterswith "r" like *pra/br* \[like *bramaṇa*\],and the variation of *pra/par* is very common. With best wishes,
