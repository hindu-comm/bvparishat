\[Sorry for the typo "his" instead of "this". Now corrected. RS\]

  
  
  
P.S.:  
  
\> Now for a justification of all the comments made above about Mayrhofer,  
\> \*please see the highlights\* made in the erudite review of  
\> the early fascicules of his work by a giant scholar (viz. Paul Thieme),  
\> attached.  
  

I recommend a thorough, accurate and above all unbiased reading of the **entire** review of this "giant scholar". Here it depends very much on the nuances, the context and the basic preconditions, which are of course shared with Mayrhofer, but not always explicitly. It is not enough to highlight single remarks.

  
  
However, I must warn you: it's not for the faint-hearted. Example: Thieme's assessment of Yāska's "Etymology".
