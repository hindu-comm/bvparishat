What I said was not to underrate the enormity of the task he undertook.

If due precaution is taken so that a user is not misled, it is fine.  

But the task expected of his commenders and recommenders is  

to carry things to logical/more logical conclusions if possible;

to supplement and complement his work,

rather than merely compliment, and rest at that.
