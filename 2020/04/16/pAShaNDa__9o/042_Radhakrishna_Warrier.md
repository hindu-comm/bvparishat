"*Words in Hindi like 'गन्ध', 'वास' denoting 'fragrance', 'good smell' are more or less nowadays exclusively tending to mean 'bad odor'. Same with Tamil word nāṛṛam meaning 'fragrance' classically today stands for 'stench', as is the case with English words like 'knave', 'villain'.* "

  

  

Interesting to know that Tamil nāṟṟam meant fragrance in the ancient days. Like Tamil, in modern times Malayalam nāṯṯṯam (നാറ്റം, spelt with a geminate ṟ but pronounced with a geminate ṯ) also means stench. To say “good smell” in Malayalam, either we have to use the Sanskrit “sugandham” or pure Malayalam “nalla maṇam”. “Maṇam” actually means just “smell”, hence the need to add the adjective “nalla” meaning good.
But Maṇam has acquired a sense of good smell, so that you can say "maṇam alla nāṯṯṯam" meaning it is not good smell but stench. I have a faint memory of a Malayalam teacher telling us that nāṯṯṯam originally meant good smell, not bad smell.
