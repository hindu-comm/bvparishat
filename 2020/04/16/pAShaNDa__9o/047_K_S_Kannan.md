Apropos a point raised by Dr. Steiner on the virtues of Mayrhofer's etymological dictionary of Sanskrit.

  

Alongside the recommendations made, one should also take note of some of the idiosyncrasies,  

and more importantly, limitations, of the said bulky dictionary :  

  

\* Deplorable is Mayrhofer's preference not to call Sanskrit by its own natural, hallowed, name,

but designate it as "Altindoarisch" - in a vaunted etymological dictionary of *Sanskrit* !

  

\* Naive is the supposition that the antiquity of a language is settled  

just by its earliest literary attestation.

  

\* Exasperating to even a patient porer over lexica is the over a thousand abbreviations  

(many clumsy and mutilated) deployed.

  

\* The fad of *renaming Sanskrit roots* (an offshoot of making a fetish of diachronism)

setting aside the short and evocative Paninian set up of the same!  

  

\* Absence of any cogent, even poor, reasons to deliver up to oblivion the superb achievements

of Indian grammarians - **pretending thereby that scientific linguistics started in Europe and  
**

**only in the beginning of the last century**; the fact on the other hand being that  

Indian grammarians of all descriptions are shrewd observers and sharp thinkers.

(Oh what great sagacity and service of Mayrhofer for the Indian heritage!)

  

\* Fulsome praise showered on Saussure by ignorant IndoEuropeanists (no exceptions possibly)  

for an etymology given by Yaska 2000 years ago! Yaska's fault: did he ever apply for patent?  

(And Oh what a great Mutual Admiration Society the West has steadily and carefully nurtured !)

  

\* Suspicions of Dravidian origin mooted even for words plainly explained by Patanjali or Yaska;

or even when easily explicable from material extant in Sanskrit itself.

(*Divide et impera* - is a never-to-be-forgotten norm, after all).  

  

\* Specious asterisks and exclamatory marks

(to decorate a book involving heavy drudgery, no doubt) !

  

\*Fallibilities owing to ignorance - of the sensitivities of an Indian ear and mind

while dealing with Indian words (Overbearing omniscience cannot care less).  

  

\*\* Western linguists in particular (and Western Indologists in general, too) need to learn the banal truth

that by far not everything printed by them is actually worth it (- worth even the paper, that is, possibly).

  

\[And a caveat: all this was not said to underestimate or undermine  

some of the positive contributions made by a few wise Westerners.\]

  

Now for a justification of all the comments made above about Mayrhofer,

**please see the highlights** made in the erudite review of  

the early fascicules of his work by a giant scholar (viz. Paul Thieme), attached.
