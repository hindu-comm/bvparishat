References to secondary literature or newspaper articles or YouTube videos are given here on this list constantly, which is sometimes useful, sometimes less useful. Since Mayrhofer's dictionary had not yet been mentioned in this thread, I thought it useful to point it out. I myself have not researched the etymology of the word *pāṣaṇḍa*, so I cannot say more about it than what Mayrhofer says.  
  
But if the prerequisite for being allowed to give a special bibliographical reference is own research on this particular topic, then there will be far fewer contributions on this list in the future.  
  
Best,  
Roland Steiner
