Well, it's not an exact science. Let me explain why I had said 'removed in time'.

  

In many loci when a word gets associated with it a more restricted meaning and in particular, a pejorative or other sense connoting opprobrium, it is reasonable to assume that it has taken some time to get that meaning and also, that the earlier meaning might have been of a general nature.  

  

To me it appeared that 'पाषण्ड' and as the thread showed 'देवानाम्प्रिय' probably belong to this category. We can find many such words in our modern language too. Words in Hindi like 'गन्ध', 'वास' denoting 'fragrance', 'good smell' are more or less nowadays exclusively tending to mean 'bad odor'. Same with Tamil word nāṛṛam meaning 'fragrance' classically today stands for 'stench', as is the case with English words like 'knave', 'villain'. Their archaic sense tend to be non-negative.  

  

So if you think it's not time difference but space or cultural remove that's at play here, just spell it out. It should be interesting.
