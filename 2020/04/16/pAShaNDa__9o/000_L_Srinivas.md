I find this word 'pāṣaṇḍa' rather problematic. As per Apte's Lexicon, it means 'heretical' among related senses. It cites the line 'पाषण्डमाश्रितानां चरन्तीनां ... सुरापीनां च योषिताम् ' from Manu (5.90). Down to the modern times, this sense and another related sense 'hypocrite' continue to be associated with this word. (Hindi पाखंडी for hypocrite, Tamil pācāṇḍi பாசாண்டி for heretic - just to give a couple examples)  

  

However one reference not seen in Sanskrit dictionaries is the use of this word in Asoka's inscriptions. In particular, Rock Edict 12 which seems to use this term many times rather neutrally in the sense of sect or tradition (e.g., ātpa pāsaṃḍa, para pāsaṃḍa - one's own sect, other sect respectively). Are Manu and Asoka far removed in time that there's this difference in meaning?  

  

In any case, does this word have a derivation?  

  

Thanks in advance,
