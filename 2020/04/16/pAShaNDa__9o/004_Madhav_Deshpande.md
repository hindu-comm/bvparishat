Dear Srini,

  

  This is perhaps similar to the interpretation of the compound श्रमणब्राह्मणम् in the Mahabhashya verses its use in Ashokan inscriptions. For Patanjali, this comes under येषां च विरोध: शाश्वतिक:, while the use in Ashokan inscriptions is neutral. I think Manu wants to draw a sharp contrast between Vedic and non-Vedic schools, while Ashoka perhaps intends to keep peace among the different sects within his empire. This is my guess. With best wishes,
