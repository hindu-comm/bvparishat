Mayrhofer sees a possible etymological connection between aśok. (girnār) *pāsaṁḍa*-, (kālsī) *pāśaṁḍa*-, (shāhbāzgaṛhī) *praṣaṁḍa*-, (mānsehrā) *prasada*- (etc.) meaning "sect" with *parṣat* (*pariṣád*-) "assembly" and its derivatives *pāriṣada*- "participant in an assembly" (epic, classical), *pārṣada*- "participant in an assembly", also "companion (especially of a god)" (Upaniṣads, epic, classical). Furthermore, another line leads from the neutral meaning "sect" to the pejorative meaning "heretic, heresy". For this, he refers to further literature, that one should read before judging this etymological approach. Anyone who can make a better suggestion should voice it.
