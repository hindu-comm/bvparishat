\> 'पाषण्ड'. I would like to understand its origin. Any pointers would be appreciated.  
  

Manfred Mayrhofer assumes "despite phonetic difficulties" a connection with *parṣat* (*pariṣád*-) and its derivations *pāriṣada*- "Participants in an assembly" (epic, classical), *pārṣada*- "Participants in an assembly", also "companions (especially of a god)" (Upaniṣads, epic, classical); please see attachment.  
  
With best regards,  
Roland Steiner
