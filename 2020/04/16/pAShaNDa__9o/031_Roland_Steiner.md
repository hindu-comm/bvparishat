\> No, Patanjali's statement is not a paraphrase of the statement you have

\> rejective of others.  
  

This is not at all about Pataṅjali, but about the etymology of aśok. (girnār) *pāsaṁḍa*-, (kālsī) *pāśaṁḍa*-, (shāhbāzgaṛhī) *praṣaṁḍa*-, (mānsehrā) *prasada*- (etc.) meaning "sect".  
  
Skt. *pārṣada* has several different meanings, like many other Sanskrit words. Sometimes these meanings (of one and the same word) are closely related, sometimes not. What is the problem? The expectation that two etymologically related words must share all attested meanings is wrong.
