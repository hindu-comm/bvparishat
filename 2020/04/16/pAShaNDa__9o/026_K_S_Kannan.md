I am only confirming what Prof. Deshpande noted.

"*sarva-pArShadaM hIdaM shastram*" occurs more than once.

  

To link *pASha(kha)NDa* with *pArShada*,

is to fly on wings of wild fancy.

  

To derive a word of a very negative connotation  

from a word reflecting high honour,

some basis needs to be shown.

Has Mayrhofer attempted that?
