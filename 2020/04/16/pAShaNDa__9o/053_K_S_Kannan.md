I did not mean, let me clarify, to deride Mayrhofer's enormous effort  

or the net result by any means.

  

After all, as they say,

"Dictionaries are like watches;  

while the best cannot be expected to go quite true,  

the worst is yet better than none".

Every dictionary is but an attempt, a human endeavour,  

subject naturally to human foibles and fallibilities.

(All the same, the responsibility of a lexicographer is, it will be easily conceded,  

indeed much more than of any other ordinary writer:  

one wrong note can mislead more people than any other book can).

  

It is good to recommend a dictionary. It is good Steiner did.

But he seems to consciously ignore my "if possible" consciously added there.  

  

It is precisely because Mayrhofer violates a significant principle of Yaska,

one of semantic compatibility, that he has ventured to link two words

that have but just an initial syllable (*pA*) in common, and the rest utterly disparate,  

demanding thus too heavy a price to get equated in any manner whatsoever.

  

**(Indeed, somebody should evolve a mathematical model to calculate**

**the distance, hence weightage/price, between two syllables,**

**paid in the case of each proposed etymology).**

(And even Yaska may perhaps be subjected to test against these methods,

provided the methods are carefully and sensibly evolved).

  

After all, Yaska largely continued the archetypes of etymology already provided in the Vedic,

and I should not like to dwell on this at this juncture.  

  

And had Thieme been nothing but all disapproval of Yaska, would he have  

summoned the evidence of Yaska to show how Mayrhofer eggregiously erred ?  

  

My grouse is essentially against the roughshod air of superiority blatantly displayed  

by a good many Western Indologists in matters of explanation/interpretation

of things essentially Indian - even where the things have survived (or even flourished)

as a continued and living tradition. It is their tone of condescension that makes them repulsive.

It is a confidence issuing and effusing from unmitigated academic "impunity".  

  

(And what provides a stark contrast and an ironic contradiction at the same time is that  

all their intellectual dauntlessness, affectation and aggression against the Hindu melts into  

nothing but pusillanimity and spinelessness when dealing with things Islamic.

It is no new matter that Hindus have no aggressive defenders, after all. Anything, therefore, goes:  

making any filthy comment even; and a good many are meant to and designed to  

shock and hurt the sensibilities of the "poor, mild, meek" Hindu).

  

And do we indeed have to doubt very much the standard and stature of Paul Thieme?
