I am reminded of a sort of a *subhAShita* a teacher of mine once said:

It is not enough to *be sincere*;

one must also *appear sincere*.

Necessary sometimes, even if unoften.  

  

Secondly, and more importantly,

*pan'ktibheda* can sometimes inspire misconstruals.

Better give no scope for that; and it's easy too:

give a generic "thanks all of you", and nobody bothers !

  

Or if specifically listing names, take care to treat equal benefactors equally.

Or at least say, there are many more to thank.

Use the handy escape clause *AkRtigaNo'yam*.

  

If you resort to a sort of *pratipada-pATha* on the other hand,  

you can't say later, "Oh I missed some".

That will demand *uktAnukta-duruktAdi-cintA.*

  

These are only safety guides.

Hope I am not very wrong!
