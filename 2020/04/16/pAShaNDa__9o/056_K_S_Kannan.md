Thank you Prof. Isaacson, for your effort.

I had expected that the person who raised the question  

would be willing to take the little trouble,

when sufficient clue has been given.

  

Speaking of a few others,

there are many who want everything ready-made & spoon-fed.

I sometimes feel almost irked by the patience and helpfulness of Shankara,  

when people do not make even elementary efforts

\- just as much as looking up in a dictionary or looking into [archive.org](http://archive.org) as a preliminary attempt.  

Shankara should not be treated as a free BVP-tap doing but its duty.  

  

Thank you once again for your concern.

KSKannan
