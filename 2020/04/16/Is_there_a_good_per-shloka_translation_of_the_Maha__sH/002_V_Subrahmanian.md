Thanks for the link. I had seen the notification of this edition which specifies:

  

<https://sripalimarumatha.org/news/mahabharata-e-publications>  

  

//This edition of Mahabharata published by Shri Matha is based on the literary works of Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya by Shri Madhvacharya and Mahabharata Lakshalankara by Shri Vadiraja Teertha. Therefore, instances not validated by Lord Vedavyasa will not be found in this edition making it one of its specialities.//

  

regards
