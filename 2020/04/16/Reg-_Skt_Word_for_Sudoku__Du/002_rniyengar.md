While I do not know the equivalent word in Sanskrit, there seems to be evidence for one particular arrangement of numbers (as in modern sudoku) being part of a mystic yantra called महाशीतला-पूजा-यन्त्र.Please see the attached paper by Prof.SR Sarma, (ex-Professor of Sanskrit, AMU) who has made seminal contributions to science in Sanskrit texts and History of Indian Astronomy.

I have seen in an ancient Kannada work called "Lokopakarakam' by Chamunda Raya (1025 CE) such diagrams for planet worship. Due to the current lock down, that book is locked up in my office !
