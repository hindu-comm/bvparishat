The name “sudoku” (सुदोकु) is abbreviated from the Japanese "suuji wa dokushin ni kagiru", which means “the numbers (or digits) must remain single (i.e. unique).” \[Note: In Japanese, there is no टवर्ग sound.\]

  

The numbers (digits) must be unique in each of the nine rows, or nine columns, or nine boxes (3x3), i.e. each row/column/box of a square divided into 9 x 9 squares must contain the digits 1 to 9 without any repetition.

  

There is no already existing word in any Indian language and hence it has to be coined.

  

It could be an abbreviation of four important words: पङ्क्ति (row), स्तम्भ (column), एक (unique), संख्या or अंक (number or digit).

  

The last one could be omitted.

प - स्त - एक = पस्तैक
