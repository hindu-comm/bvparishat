early 21st century: from Japanese*sūdoku*, from*sū(ji)*‘number’ +*doku(shin)*‘single status’ after*sūji wa dokushin ni kagiru*, literally ‘the numbers are restricted to single status’, former name of the puzzle.  
  
The word sudoku is a created word in Japanese, just for this puzzle type.

So, we need to coin a word for it Sanskrit, nothing existing will be found.

  

एकसंख्यी

सांख्येकी - play on सांख्यिकी

एकाकिनी

एकैकी - one-one (digit per square)

एकांकी - play on single act drama

  

  
Thanks,
