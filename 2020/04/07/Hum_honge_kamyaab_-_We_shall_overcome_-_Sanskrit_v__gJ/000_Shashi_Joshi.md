Dear members,

The famous song We shall overcome (Hindi - Hum honge Kamyaab) has been translated into Sanskrit by Shibu Kumar, and sung by Aditi.

  

[Here is an article covering that](https://blog.practicalsanskrit.com/2020/04/we-shall-overcome-sanskrit-translation.html), those curious/interested may check it out.  

  
  

Thanks,  

\~ Shashi
