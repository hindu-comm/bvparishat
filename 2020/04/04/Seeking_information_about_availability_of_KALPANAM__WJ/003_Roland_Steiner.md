\> Kalpanamaditika also known as Drstantapankti. I think Prof. Michael Hahn re-edited the text.  
  

Michael Hahn has edited and translated (into German) the **Tibetan** version of the **first chapter** of Kumāralāta's text (see the first file attached here). According to him, the original title is *Kalpanāmaṇḍitikā Dṛṣṭāntapaṅkti*.  
  
See also Martin Straube: "Narratives: South Asia," in: *Brill's Encyclopedia of Buddhism. Volume One. Buddhist Literatures*. Edited by Jonathan A. Silk. Consulting Editors: Oskar von Hinüber and Vincent Eltschinger. Leiden, etc.: Brill 2015 (Handbook of Oriental Studies. Section 2 South Asia, 29/1), pp. 501-502 (see the second file attached here):  
  
"The entire work exists only in a Chinese translation from the 5th century CE, which found its way into some older works of literary history under the wrong author Aśvaghoṣa and the equally wrong title *Sūtrālaṃkāra* (for a French  
translation, see Huber, 1908; comp. Hahn, 1982, 1f.). Fragments of a manuscript with the original Sanskrit  
text were found in Kizil (Lüders, 1926), and the first narrative with the verses introducing the complete  
oeuvre exists in a Tibetan translation as part of the Tanjur (Hahn, 1982)."  
  
With best regards,  
Roland Steiner.
