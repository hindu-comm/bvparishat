\> I am in need of getting the book in Sanskrit script or in english/ Hindi language.  
  

As already stated, only fragments of the Sanskrit text have survived, which the German Indologist Heinrich Lüders published in Roman transcription (Bruchstücke der Kalpaṇāmaṇḍitikā des Kumāralāta, Leipzig, 1926). The entire work is preserved only in a Chinese translation, which Édouard Huber translated into French (Açvaghoṣa: Sûtrâlaṃkâra: Traduit en français sur la version chinoise de Kumârajîva, Paris, 1908; s. the already mentioned article by Martin Straube). Unfortunately, I cannot help you any further.
