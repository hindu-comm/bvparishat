To cite just a parallel.

Once I was talking to Rangapriya Swamiji when we heard a knock on the door.

There was a man seeking a rather urgent interview with the Swamiji,  

(as he was proceeding to USA the next day). I took him to, and told Swamiji :  

Here is a person going to a place wherefrom he would  

*na ca punarAvartate, na ca punarAvartate !  
*

Amused, Swamiji asked me to spell out what I meant.

  

The fellow said in all seriousness that he indeed plans to return and settle down in India.

To this day he has not. He still wants to, but his  

"wife and kids are not interested".

  

A story that rings true with so many perhaps.
