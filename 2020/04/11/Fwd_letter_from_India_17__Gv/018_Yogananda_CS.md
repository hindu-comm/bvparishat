Namaste,

  

I am addressing the moderators. This is a platform for a specific purpose and as such, perhaps may not be used for sharing personal communications meant for other groups. The current thread is a case in point. The interests of BVP and residents of Lincoln may not overlap much. I would request the moderators to seek opinion of other members of the group in this regard.

  

Regards. . . . .yoga
