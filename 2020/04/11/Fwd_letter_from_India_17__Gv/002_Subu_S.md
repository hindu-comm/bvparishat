Sir

  

SAINT Thomas never came to India.

  

\*That story is a fake\*.

  

Even Europeans do not believe it.

  

That is a fake story just Peddled in south of India

  

Probably to appease some people or to convert some people, Nevertheless the story is fake

  

I’m sure that the erudite members of this group will not believe such fake storiesnevertheless the story is fake

  

Best Regards

  

///It *is believed that St Thomas arrived in the southern coast of Kerala*

*in 78AD. It is said that he traveled by land, but I don't understand*

*why he went so far south. The coastal Kerala has some beautiful*

*old churches linked to St Thomas. ///*

  

Best Regards
