**Summary of the above post !**

**  
**

-   Colonizers take. -   Colonizers never ask to borrow. -   Colonizers never return – which is the polite thing to do after you
    are allowed to borrow something. -   Colonizers never say thank you. -   Colonizers purposely exclude you – the actual person – after they
    have taken everything else from you. -   Colonizers take all profits
