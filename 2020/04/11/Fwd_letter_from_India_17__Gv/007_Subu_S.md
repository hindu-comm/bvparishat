Sir

  

People are free to believe what they want but history shows otherwise

  

1\. Source that says St Thomas never reached INDIA ... ie didn’t even reach mumbai ... let alone KERALA

  

<https://ishwarsharan.com/2019/08/13/pope-denies-st-thomas-evangelized-south-india-ishwar-sharan/>

  

  

2\. And a point by point REBUTTAL of any connection between ST Thomas & India

  

<https://medium.com/@TheSensible_1/the-myth-of-st-thomas-7ef88ecb9e13>

  

3\. And what more did PORTUGUESE do to Hindus and Hindu temples in south India
