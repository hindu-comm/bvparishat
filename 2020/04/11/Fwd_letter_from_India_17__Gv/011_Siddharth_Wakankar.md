I am given to understand that Sawai Jai Singh,the Maharaja of Jaipur,had sent some Jesuite scholars along with some Sanskrit Pandits to Samarkand of Mirza Raja Ulugh Beg to study his Observatory and bring the
Astrological Tables,known as Saranees, to Jaipur.This enabled him to erect five Stone Observatories or Jantar Mantar in India,at Jaipur,Varanasi,Mathura Ujjain and Delhi .
