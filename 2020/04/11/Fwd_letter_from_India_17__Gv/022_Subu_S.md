Dear sir

  

I am replying this purely from an indological and historical perspective

  

I am all ready for free flow of ideas

  

I am not denying anyone any right to propagate or preach or learn

  

All I wished to state and with reasonable certainty is that St Thomas , who is beloved to be one of the original followers of Jesus \*never came to south India\*. 

  

Yes there could be copper plates which are in the eight ninth or tenth century et cetera but they are of a much much later period

  

  
  

Best Regards  
  
S. Subramaniam \[Subu\]
