Prof. Misra,

  

You need not refrain.

  

You may continue to consider BVP as a source for sharing your thoughts.

  

The suggestion was only to post on topics relevant to BVP.

  

In this time of isolation , BVP is with you and we will be happy to enjoy your thoughts.

  

Warm regards,

  

Nagaraj
