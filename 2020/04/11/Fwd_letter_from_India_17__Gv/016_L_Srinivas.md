I dont know about St Thomas etc. But as a general point, if Hinduism started spreading in SE Asia very early, is there any reason to deny similar spread of Judaism and Christianity in the Kerala and TN coasts? Tamil texts of the early centuries speak of the West Asian trade. Coins of contemporary Roman emperors (Tiberius, Augustus, Caligula, Nero) have also been found along Tamilnadu and Kerala trade routes.  

  

SE Asian and West Asian trade were enabled basically by the trade winds so clearly the trade must have been rather ancient. So why would there not be cultural influence, spread of religion etc? In the 9th century (\~ 849 AD), there's even a copper plate issued by a Kerala king granting rights to Christians which is countersigned by the foreign merchants in Pehlavi, Greek and Syriac. The charter itself is in Tamil written in vatteluttu script. So maybe there's no document as yet for the earlier periods. But to deny other religions in the absence of hard documentation sounds almost Indological to me.  

  

For evidences of attestation of Christians in India, a handy reference may be:  

  

[Baum, Wilhelm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Baum "Wilhelm Baum"); Winkler, Dietmar W. (2003). *The Church of the East: A Concise History*. London-New York: Routledge-Curzon.  

  



Hope this helps,
