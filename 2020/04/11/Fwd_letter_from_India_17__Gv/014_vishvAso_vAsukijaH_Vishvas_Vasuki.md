Your weird use of the "Mirza Raja" (Mogol title held by Jai Singh's dad) for "Ulugh Beg" led me to infer that you confusedly thought him to be contemporaneous to Jai Singh.  

Not that I care to disprove your statement - but that provides valid grounds to write a clarification for the general edification of readers who might otherwise be misled.
