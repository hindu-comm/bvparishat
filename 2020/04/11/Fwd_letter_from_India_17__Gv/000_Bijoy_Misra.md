Friends,

  

Today is Good Friday. In our school days it was a holiday.

i don't know the transition. Everything is closed here now.

All social congregation is strictly prohibited. Possibly the  

containment strategy works. They seal off the areas where

new cases are discovered. Apparently all cases are connected

with somebody coming from abroad. I don't fully understand the

connection.

  

I have been writing a short summary of cultural evolution in

India as I understand. If you are interested in world history  

and you have school-age children at home, I recommend

you to procure the brilliantly written eleven volume set by the

couple Will and Ariel Durrant. The set is called The Story of

Civilization and you may check out from the library before

buying.

  

The first encounter of the west to India was in 327BC through  

the invasion of Alexander. Though he reached the periphery,

he got concerned with the massive rivers and an elusive elephant  

Army. Apparently his soldiers rebelled. Alexander retreated taking the ocean route back to Greece. The historian Pliny (as quoted by Durrant)

mentions about Alexander's quest of "God". Apparently he

wanted to know how does a man become God. He imprisoned

some monks and threatened them death to know the "answer".  

The monks declared that a man becomes a God when he can  

do "impossible" tasks. Any task when done, becomes "possible"

was the sly response. So ended Alexander's quest as per Pliny.

  

It is believed that St Thomas arrived in the southern coast of Kerala

in 78AD. It is said that he traveled by land, but I don't understand

why he went so far south. The coastal Kerala has some beautiful

old churches linked to St Thomas. There could be other unrecorded

travels, but we know of Portuguese arrival in Goa around 1500AD.  

Though they came for trade, missionary activities were supported.

Goa has some of the most elegant churches constructed by the

Portuguese missionaries. The Portuguese were followed by the  

Dutch and the French who made port enclaves on the coastlines.

The British were shrewd. They could flatter the Moghul

emperor with European oil paintings and managed to get a blanket

permission to operate through any port in India. This is recorded  

in 1636AD. The rest is history.

  

The British East India Company let Jesuit missionaries operate in

India. Jesuits were dedicated and extremely committed to the cause

of preaching. They tried to mingle with the locals and learn their

language in order to preach. The first compilation of grammars in

Indian languages was painstakingly done by the Jesuits. They also  

opened schools and managed health care in the country. While they  

had good intentions to spread the message as widely as possibly,  

unknowingly they were destroying the native culture and the languages.

Eventually the East India Company decreed to make English compulsory for employment thus making the final effort to kill India's culture. The

damage could be permanent. In stead of the great literary tradition

in India, the communication now is mechanical and business-like.

The lyricism of old India only lives in the temples and monuments

or in dance recitals.  

  

In order to accomplish the task of converting the natives, the  

missionaries have adopted most cultural symbols of the natives to

convert the churches as little temples. The mimicry is atrocious and

massive resources are used for the effort. There is an element

of thinking that "we can do better" belying thousands of years of history

and culture. I think the effort is un-Christian. Disrespecting people

and culture though deceitful methods must be abandoned. A lot

of semi-literate individuals are apparently involved to create pretentious  

mis-statements. No new Emerson is coming in India!

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra (Bhubaneswar, India)
