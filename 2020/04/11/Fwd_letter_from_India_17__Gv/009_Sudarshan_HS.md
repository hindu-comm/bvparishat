Prof. Bijoy,

  

I saw the very useful conversation about the story of St. Thomas in Kerala. Thanks to all. May I use this context to highlight a few other topics that were mentioned, invite comments and learn from them as well?

  

\> The early brutality by the Islamic invaders and the continuing Hindu fundamentalism did give rise to a beautiful new religion called Sikhism

\> in the 16th century.

  

"Sikhism" may have become a "religion" now. But did it become a religion in its early days as well, the 16th century? Probably not.

  

\> The teacher Guru Nanak is the only known religious preacher in the world who tilled his own land, cooked food for his guests

\> and spoke to them only after he fed them.

  

This assertion is also strange as we infer that it was quite common for an person living by himself to cook, feed guests and speak to them only after they are fed.

  

Next, on the topic of Jesuits,

> Jesuits were dedicated and extremely committed to the cause of > preaching. They tried to mingle with the locals and learn their  
> language in order to preach. The first compilation of grammars in > Indian languages was painstakingly done by the Jesuits. They also  
> opened schools and managed health care in the country. While they had > good intentions to spread the message as widely as possibly,

  

It may be incomplete to talk about Jesuits without one of their significant interventions: They were responsible for transmission of Indian mathematics to Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. Many have written about it. Below is an extract from "Joseph, G. G. (2009).*A passage to infinity: Medieval Indian mathematics from Kerala and its impact*. SAGE Publications India."
