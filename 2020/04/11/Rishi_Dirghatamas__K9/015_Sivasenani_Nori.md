I like the phrase 'here and there'. Why? Let me explain.

  

Forget students, to whom Shankar ji is so patiently and cheerfully helpful (others give suggestions like 'Google it' or 'search archives' but not the man who actually gives them what they want), or research scholars for whom he can generate the literature to be reviewed in a jiffy as it were, but even for researchers with a narrow focus, he is able to come up with books they need. Present list on Rishi Dirghatamas is an example. And Prof. Kannan would not use words of praise out of mere politeness, as we know - he means them.

  

Thus, Shankaraji's 'here and there' extends to as many texts as are required to come up with the answer. In other wordsthe vyangyaartha of 'here and there' is important here.

  

कस्मै न रोचते ध्वनिः।

Senani
