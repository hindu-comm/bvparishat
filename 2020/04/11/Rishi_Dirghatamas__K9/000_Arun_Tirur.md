Namaste scholars..!!

  

In Rigveda, first mandala sukta 164 - Asyavamiyasukta, Dirghatamas is the rishi. There are more suktas and mantras attached to Him. What actually is the idea of Dirghatamas. What is the significance of the nameDirghatamas? Read that he is the son of Uchathya Angirasa and grand disciple of Rishi Angira.

Is there any book or reference where I can get more details of Vedic Rishis viz; Nirukti of rishi names, their association with mantras or suktas.

  

Thanks,

  

regards,
