Shri R. V. Vaidya,who worked for 22 years in the Ujjain Observatory and translated in English the Marathi Book by Shankar Balkrishna Dixit( named Bharatiya Jyotishashastrachaa Itihaas),had released his English book on Asya Vameeya Sukta at the time of the Ujjain Session of the A.I O.C. in 1972. Its a very small book trying to solve some mysterious verses bearing on Astronomy.

  

I am not an authority on this subject, but,this books seems to have been either forgotten or possibly not known by the scholars of that subject.

  

Best of luck in its search.
