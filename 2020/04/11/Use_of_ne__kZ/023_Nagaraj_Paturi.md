The Dravidian, gender is semantic unlike in Sanskrit, where it is grammatical not semantic.

  

In Sanskrit, gender is that of the word and not that of the object denoted by it. In Dravidian languages gender is that of the object denoted by the word.  

  

In Dravidian, gender categories are human-masculine, human- feminine and non-human.

  

It is this difference in gender system that makes the observers note that in languages like Sankrit, Hindi inanimate objects have gender distinctions.
