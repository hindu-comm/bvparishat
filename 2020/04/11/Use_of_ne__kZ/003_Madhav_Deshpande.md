According to Jules Bloch's *Formation of the Marathi Language*, the Sanskrit instrumental ending -*ena*found in the masc./neut. paradigms of the -*a* stems turns up in Old Marathi as *-eṃ*, in forms like *deveṃ* "by god." This is generally not used in Modern Marathi, where in singular forms like *rām-ne/ rāmā-ne*, "By Ram" the form -*ne* occurs really as a post-position, alternatingwith -*nī* in plural forms like *devāṃ-nī* "by the gods." The ancestry of this post-position is shared with other IA languages. I am still looking for a discussion of the source of this post-position.
