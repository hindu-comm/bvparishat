See the following sentences in Hindi:  



1\. राम अयोध्या गया (गए if Rama is spoken of with respect) / सीता अयोध्या गई (गईं spoken with respect) – Ram / Sita went to Ayodhya



2\. रामने अयोध्या नगरी देखी / सीता ने अयोध्या नगरी देखी 

\- Ram / Sita saw the city of Ayodhya



The same in Gujarati



1\. રામ અયોધ્યા ગયો (or ગયા spoken with respect) / સીતા અયોધ્યા ગઈ

2\. રામે અયોધ્યા નગરી જોઇ / સીતાએ અયોધ્યા નગરી જોઇ



Sentences (1) and (2) are in simple past. In (1) the verb is intransitive and the agreement is with the subject. In (2) the verb is transitive and a grammatical element ने, ne,  (in Gujarati એ, e) gets added and the agreement of the verb changes to the object.



I know that Punjabi and Marathi have similar constructions (i.e., in the past transitive case, ने gets added and the agreement of the verb changes to the object.)



Other Indo-Aryan languages may also have similar sentence constructions in the simple past.

  

Where did this ने (or its equivalent) come from? Is there a parallel in the various Prakrits, Apabhramshas or Sanskrit?
