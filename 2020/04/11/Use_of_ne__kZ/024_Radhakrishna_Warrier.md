It is easy to understand how semantic gender came about, but it remains an enigma how grammatical gender originated in all these many languages. Perhaps in the distant past, the ancients perceived some sort of masculinity or femininity in the form of the words.

  

Wondering if there is grammatical gender outside of the Indo-European family of languages.
