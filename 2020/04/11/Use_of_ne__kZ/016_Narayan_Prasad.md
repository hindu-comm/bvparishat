\<\<I guess finite verbs (*tin'anta*-s) in Sanskrit have no gender,(but all other Indian languages have).

Participles in Sanskrit too show gender, (as do other Indian languages).\>\>

  

There are many Indian languages \[e.g. Bengali, Oriya, Assamese, and Magahi (my mother tongue)\] do not have any grammatical gender in verb-forms.
