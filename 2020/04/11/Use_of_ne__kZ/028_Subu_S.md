Radha sir

  

Thanks for that explanation

  

///*Inanimate objects (say, a table) doesn't have gender in the way that Indo-Aryan languages have.//*/

  

I suppose this portion is true for Tamil and Kannada as well ? While you have rightly pointed out that PNG suffixes are available in other Dravidian languages, Absence of gender for inanimate objects is what I am referring to

  

As far as I see a table or a cycle or a bus or a train does not have gender in either Tamil or Kannada ( while they have gender in Hindi etc )

  

Thanks in advance for your comments and corrections

  

All posts here is with an intention to learn from this great group of knowledge 🙏🙏🙏🙏
