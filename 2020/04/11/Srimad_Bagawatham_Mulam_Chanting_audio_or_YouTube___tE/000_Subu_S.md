Request for audio or video of \*Srimad Bagavatham Moola parayanam chanting\*  
  
Sir  
  
Namaste üôè Pranams üôè  
  
I am new to this list. very happy to see many knowledgeable people in this group  
  
I am looking for an audio of video of Srimad Bagawatham moolam - esp 10th and 11 th SKANDHAM  
  
This is to read along and learn with my book and audio support  
  
I know that Shri Shri Krishna Prema Ji has rendered it ... but he is very fluent and I can‚Äôt learn at that speed - which is MY limitation , NOT his  
  
Once I found a very good rendering of Srimad Bagawatham \*mula parayanam chanting\* on google drive / google docs. A Lady had done the mula parayanam chanting and she had even done one repetition two repetitions and stuff like that. \*Sadly I lost the link to those files \*  
  
Searching through the archives of this group I found that she Subramaniam Ji had referred to on MR Annaswamy of US . Those YouTube and the media fire audio video are very good. But unfortunately I cannot find the 10th SKANDHAM / canto? which I‚Äôm specifically looking for  
  
Do any of have any good rendering of \*Srimad Bagavatham Moola parayanam chanting\* ? Especially 10th and 11th SKANDHAM  
  
Audio, YouTube, or anything?  
  
It does not matter as to who has done it. It can be anyone. Just a good Sanskrit rendering is requested.  
  
Thanks in advance.  
  
Best Regards  
  
S. Subramaniam \[Subu\]
