Across all of India, there is a love for Srimad Bhagavata Mahapurana. Besides the much loved narration of the avatars of Sri Vishnu, it conveys a wealth of cultural and philosophical knowledge making it equally popular from children to adults. Composed by Bhagavan Veda Vyasa, it is a monumental work of 18,000 verses. Many would like to chant it in its entirety, or on occasions some significant parts (like the dashama skanda related to Sri Krishna lila), but find that difficult. Brahmacharini Devaki Chaitanya has recorded the entire Srimad Bhagavatam with the correct metrical form meant for any sadhaka who would be immensely aided in doing parayana whether novice or an expert.

Brahmacharini Devaki Chaitanya grew up in Kerala in a family that followed the tradition of doing the parayana of Bhagavatam and has memorised large parts. After completion of her Vedanta course, she has been posted at CIF since 2014 and conducts many jnana-yagnas in Malayalam on the Bhagavad Gita, Bhagavatam and Narayaneeyam.
