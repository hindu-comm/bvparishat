Thank you sir.

  

But I’m not in a position to collect or use any of these tapes / cassettes .

  

Also I do not have proper working tape players or tape recorders as of today

  

So, due to my limitations, It has to be either online or digital as recommended in an earlier reply by one of our members.

  
  

Best Regards
