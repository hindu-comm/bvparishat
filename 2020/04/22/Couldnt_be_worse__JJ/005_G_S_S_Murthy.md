रमणीयं जगद्भूयात् “सन्मनुष्यमनो यथा” ।

पृथ्वीदिनेऽस्मिन्नाशासे दारिद्र्यामयवर्जितम् ॥

माधवार्यसिद्धार्थवर्याभ्यां हृदुत्थाः धन्यवादाः ।

Gudsurkar ji, English translation could be

"In the forenoon, then, the King's Venue was dense with people in the sidewalks and the carriage way was full of 4-wheelers sounding their horns continuously. Now has it gone to sleep? No, it has swooned frightened by Carona and brings an illusion of a noise free midnight."  

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
