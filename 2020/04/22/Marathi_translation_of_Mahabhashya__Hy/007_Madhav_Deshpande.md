Dear Nityananda Ji,

  

  Glad to be of help to you and others. I bought the whole set of 8 volumes when I was studying Mahabhashya for my M.A. classes at the Pune University in 1966-68, and brought it with me on my ship when I traveled to USA in 1968. I never met Vasudeva Shastri in person, but I used to frequently visit his son Mahamahopadhyaya Kashinath Shastri Abhyankar to consult with him on my difficulties in reading the Mahabhashya.
