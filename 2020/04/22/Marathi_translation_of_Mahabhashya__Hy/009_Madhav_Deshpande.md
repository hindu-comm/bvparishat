You are right. There are only 7 volumes. My mistake. The Prastāvanā volume is mostly written by Kashinath Shastri, with only some portions being written by Vasudeva Shastri. Kashinath Shastri with Jayadev Mohanlal Shukla had started an English translation of the Mahabhāṣya.
From the title page of the first volume, which contains the first two Āhnikas, it appears that he intended to translate the first 9 Āhnikas.
However, I have not seen anything beyond these first two Āhnikas.
