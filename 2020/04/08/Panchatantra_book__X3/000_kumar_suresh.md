Namaskaram respected Scholars,

 Can somebody help me to share original text of Panchatantra or the Telugu translation of it with me? I could not find the full text in archive. A copy in Telugu (Prose) of a few stories (94 pages) is available in archive. Thank you very much!  

With best regards  
Suresh
