I think 'guru-mata' would be the correct one for the disciple to foster. In the Prashnopanishad, at the end, the disciples, after having lived in the Gurukula for long, and having attained the direct realization of the truth, address the Acharya: tvam hi nah pitaa.... 

  

In the Vedic perspective, a disciple is given upanayana by the Guru and inducted into his gurukula. Hence the Acharya is naturally the 'father' and the patni, the mother.
