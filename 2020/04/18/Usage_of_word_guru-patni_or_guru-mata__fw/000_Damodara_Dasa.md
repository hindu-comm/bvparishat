Hare Krishna.

  

Respected scholars,

  

I have repeatedly heard the word "*guru-mata*" being used for the wife of one's guru (who is considered on the level of one's own mother). However, I am not aware of this usage of wordin sastras. Rather I find the word *guru-patni* in the vedic literatures for describing this position.

  

Which usage is the correct one: *guru-patni* or *guru-mata*?

  

Thankyou,

Hari Guru Vaisnava das,

damodara das

  

ps. I understand that in the practical vyavahara, the disciple would be calling "mata" only as one is not supposed to make difference between one mother or other.
