Respected Scholars,  
  
Namo Namah.  
  
\* HARE KRISHNA! Mantra, movement and Svami that started it all \*  
  
Synopsis: Hare Krishna! is a documentary on the life of Srila  
Prabhupada–the 70-year-old Indian Swami who arrived in America without  
money or support in the turbulent 1960s. It explores how he ignited a  
worldwide revolution of spiritual consciousness, now known as the Hare  
Krishna Movement.  
  
Prabhupada’s uplifting story is emotionally moving and has given  
inspiration and hope to many, especially in this very difficult time.  
We wish to extend our heartfelt sympathy and best wishes to those  
suffering from the pandemic and our condolences to the relatives and  
friends of those who have passed away. Please take the time to watch  
HARE KRISHNA! and spread the word to others.
