namaste,

  

Prof. Aklujkar in his paper on Pandits ( published in a collection of papers by Axel Michaels )

refers to a book called Kashi ki paanditya parampara by Baldev Upadhyay

Is there a way to get a pdf version of this book ?  
  

There are a few other books by him available on Archive - but not this specific one on Kashi pandit parampara

<https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Upadhyay%2C+Baldev%22>  

  

I will greatly appreciate references to other books on 'shishTa' and pandits also.

Also, when the description 'kumbhidhaanyaah' is used - how much grain is this supposed to hold ?

  

  

Regards

S.Subrahmanya
