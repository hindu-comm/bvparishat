According to BORI Critical Edition of Mahabharata, the wonderful shloka (5)  
appears (with a pAThabheda at the end) among the benedictory shlokas  
at the beginning of anushAsanaparva in the manuscript D7 which is available  
at BORI.  
  
See the attached Screenshort.  
Some letters are not clear in the scanned copy I have, so I give the shloka  
in ITRANS below.  
  
yaH shvetatvamupAgataH kR^itayuge tretAyuge raktatAM  
yugme yaH kapilaH kalau sa bhagavAn kR^iShNatvamabhyAgataH  
yaM vedAntavido vadanti munayo yo yogibhirgIyate  
sa brahmA yadi vA haro yadi hariH pAyAjjagaddurgateH  
  
"pAyAjjagaddurgateH" instead of "yaH ko.api tasmai namaH" of Adiparva.
