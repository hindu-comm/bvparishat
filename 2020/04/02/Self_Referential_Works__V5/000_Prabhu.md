namH sarvebhyo

  

On the eve of Ramanavami, while perusing the 10th sarga of raghuvamsha

the verse 68 caught my attention. It starts:

  

" **रघुवंश**प्रदीपेन तेनाप्रतिमतेजसा . . ."  

  

Does the word "**रघुवंश**" appear in the raghuvamsha mahAkAvya anywhere else?

As far as I could search, this is the only instance of "self referencing" in the raghuvamsha mahAkAvya.

  

Are there other kavyas or works that have such instances of self reference?

eg does word "मेघदूतं" appear in meghadUtaM?

  

Regards

Prabhu
