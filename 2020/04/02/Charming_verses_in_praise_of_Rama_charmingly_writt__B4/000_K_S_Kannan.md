Dear All,

  

On this auspicious day of Ramanavami,

I present an old hymn in praise of Rama

"penned" by my calligraphist friend Prof. KNIengar.

  

This was only a rough draft of his.

I am not sure where the fair copy went.

But you can still see the charming handwriting.

  

The metre I guess is *puShpitAgrA*.

  

KSKannan
