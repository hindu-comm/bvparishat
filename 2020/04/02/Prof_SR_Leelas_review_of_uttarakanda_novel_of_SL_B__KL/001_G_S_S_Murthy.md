I read the Kannada article of Dr.Leela. Very well written. I have not read Dr.Bhyrappa's novel. I liked the sarcasm of Dr.Leela in the last sentence of her article. I felt that she could have also referred to the interesting incident of Sita taking a vow while crossing the holy river that she would pour hundreds of pots of liquor to the river if she successfully completed the "vanavaas". Whether she fulfilledher vow or not is not known.

Many thanks toProf. Pandurangi ji for posting this article.  

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
