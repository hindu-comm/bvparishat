Synopsis of the movie "Lost Village":

  

"The end of traditional civilisation is in sight. For the first time in human history villages across the world, once the cornerstone of the majority of the world's population, are dying out. This beautifully shot film captures the story of just one of these vanishing villages; standing as a poignant testament to those like Lokarth Swami, proud resident of the remote Indian village Arawade, who get left behind. 80% of the Indian population live in small villages, but the number is rapidly decreasing. Tensions between ancient heritage and modern values are growing. And as commercialisation sweeps across the land, farming once the staple of employment is dying out. Rural-urban migration is a growing trend and experts predict that by 2025, slums will be everywhere. "Is this progress?" asks Swami. The way of the city, lies on a bed of dissatisfaction: "People of the village are moving to the town. Townfolk are moving to the big cities. Big city people - they're trying to go to the moon". Producer: Gunar Raimann (Bhaktivaibhava Swami) Feature: 43min, English (c) 2009 Veda Vision studio, ISKCON Czech Republic."
