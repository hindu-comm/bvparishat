Namaste Bijoy Misra ji

  

Yes Sir. Your points are valid. In one of your replies you also pointed out the problem with referring dictionaries. I recently encountered such a problem, where the usage of the word in the actual concerned texts was a bit different from those shown in the dictionary entries. And hence, to determine the vivakṣā of the writer, especially a poet, one needs to do a detailed study of the text itself, while not restricting oneself to only certain verses.

  

Thank you for your input.

  

Regards
