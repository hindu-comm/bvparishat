Roland,

Some scholar did try to teach me Odia with a dictionary in hand.

it would be much better if people get engaged in work that they

understand well through their nativity. It is one thing to learn

a language, it is entirely another to "assert" uncultivated opinions.

Keep well. Yes, koshas exist for people who can "read" them.

Using koshas in native language is better! One knows more.  

Best regards,

BM
