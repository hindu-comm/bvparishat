It has happened because of the late "commentators" throwing things as miracles.

Things take a different angle once you take the poet's imaginative view.

  

In Sugriva's order, monkeys "flew" from all over the world.

The monkeys can be imagined to have their "tree" trails, where they can jump in lightening speed.

Hanuman's galloping on the shore is another example.  

The skill is what distance one can jump, not "fly".

  

I am glad that you appreciate. It is easy if you see the poet's view.
