Not only is this not true, but it is also downright grotesque. Such a  
claim can only be made by someone who does not have or does not want  
to have the slightest idea of the actual methods of Indological  
research. The idea that scholars (whether Indian or non-Indian) would  
rely exclusively or even mainly and uncritically on arbitrary  
information in some dictionaries is so far away from reality that I  
shall not discuss it further. Such an assertion is either ignorant  
and/or malicious. Everyone who knows the indispensable benefits and  
also the inherent limitations of ko≈õas in general und of specific  
dictionaries and glossaries in particular would have to agree with me  
here. Does anyone seriously believe that Indological scholars (Indian  
or non-Indian) are that stupid and naive?  
  
A comparatively unqualified judgment about, for instance, the methods  
of quantum physics by someone who is not a trained physicist  
himself/herself would never be allowed to pass. Not so in the case of  
Indology. Apparently, it is not required to be a trained Indologist,  
one does not even have to have sound knowledge of Sanskrit to be able  
to criticize Indological research competently.  
  
No one who does not fit this description should feel attacked.  
  
With best regards,  
Roland Steiner
