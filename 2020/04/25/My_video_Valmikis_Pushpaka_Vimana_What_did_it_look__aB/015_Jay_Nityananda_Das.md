Respected Satyan ji and others,

Namo Namah. Hare Krishna.

While it’s not just laudable but also an good intended and an honorable attempt to ponder over the possibilities of “Vimana” of Valmiki-Ramayana, however, in my humble opinion, rationality in this regard should not be restricted to only what we can perceive today.

There are mentions of supernatural powers of mantras throught out Vedic literatures, which are more than mere mechanical apparatuses i.e. Sage Tvasta invoked Vrtrasura through the power of mantras, Draupadi and Dhrishtdumna appeared from the fire sacrifice, Astras were personified weapons who can be invoked by mantras along with the eligibility (not in mechanical terms) and so on.

My humble submission to all who are interested in this thread is to be ready to embrass the fact that we seriously lack adequate access to myriad ancient technologies of the Vedic era, many of them are enigmatic to a common man and and thus, we might not be able to comprehend every minute details of those technologies that sound irrational to the modern Minds.

Are we of the opinions that because we, 21^(st) century humans, cannot visualize how great sages such as Narada could fly in space without any mechanical machine, so this must be a mythological story or at the least (if we don’t want to offend our Rishis), a wrong interpretation of the sacred texts!

How many of us have had visualized that one day people at thousands of miles distance could have conversations with us on mobile, internate etc.? Perhaps we can go still further and think of establishing Telepathic connections among human beings!

It’s a submission, not an accusation or order, and I hope, broad-minded people on this forum will take the essence of it.

Wish you all best luck in exploring the truth,

das,

Jaya Nityananda Dasa
