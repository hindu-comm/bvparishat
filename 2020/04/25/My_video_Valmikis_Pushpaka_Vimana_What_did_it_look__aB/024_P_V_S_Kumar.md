Dear Satyan,

  

Here I am giving you an addendum - a little bit of elaboration on some of the points just touched upon left in my PDF document:

  

Hope these points will give you some direction to you to think in multiple aspect to understand Pushpaka Vimana's structure even better.

  



***Hanuman as a high-flying highspeed self-propelled long-haul aircraft with great grand payload capacity***

******

गत्वा परममध्वानमुपर्युपरि सागरम् \|  
हिमवन्तं नगश्रेष्ठं हनूमन्गन्तुमर्हसि \|\| 6-74-29

  

**…** **Valmiki Ramayana 6-7-30, 34, 38 – 41, 50, 52, 54 …**

  

स तं समुत्पाट्य खमुत्पपात \| वित्रास्य लोकान्ससुरान्सुरेन्द्रान् \|  
संस्तूयमानः खचरैरनेकैर् \| जगाम वेगाद्गरुडोग्रवीर्यः \|\| 6-74-68

**  
**

**Observe that there were NO swans around Hanuman, the flying machine. While describing the flight of Pushpaka Vimana, which was NOT flying at that much fierce thrust and speed as Hanuman, there was a mention of swans alongside. **

**There was no mention of a trailer or add-on module being attached to carry the Mount Sanjeevani in his return journey from Himalayas to the South of India. So, Hanuman is not a modular aircraft! **

****

**If we consider Pushpaka Vimana as a ‘modular’ plane, we need to find the answer for “from where did Sri Rama (or whoever was managing it) got the additional add-on cabins to onboard *vanaras*’ families at Kinshkinda on the way back?”**

**If we have to assume spare empty cabins were also brought along from Lanka, we can as well consider Pushpaka a single large unit (a suuuuper extra sized jumbo jet kind of airplane). Then the question of why would Ravana use it at the time of abducting Sita, just for carrying 4 or 5 persons (including couple of onboard service crew). Using such a large vehicle just for 4 or 5 people is definitely not fuel/energy efficient!**

**Also, if we have to assume that Pushapaka was a single large unit, it would be much difficult to attach a such large vehicle for a bird called Jatayu.**

**From this we can construe that Pushpaka was a vehicle which can expand and contract as per the requirement. **

****

**Hanuman, one of the very important characters of Valmiki Ramayana, has the competence to change his size from normal to extra small to extra-large as and when needed. If Valmiki could give this ability to one of his monkey shaped characters, he can as well give the same capability for an object like Pushpaka Vimana also in the same story, if his narration demands so. There is no wonder!**

****

**When Pushpaka is taken as masculine (पुष्पकः), it stands for ‘name of a particular mountain’. Thus, to correctly identify the etymology of ‘Pushpaka Vimana’, we need to search puranas and elsewhere to find out the story behind that particular mountain called पुष्पकः \| As part of this we need to know whether Vishwakarma, the builder of Pushpaka Vimana, had embedded that mountain in Pushpaka Vimana or just named his creation after that mountain; what are the special features/powers of पुष्पकः \| By ascertaining these features we can understand Pushpaka Vimana better. We also need to check whether there are any other products with similar features from the same maker.**

  

  

Good luck.

  

Regards

  

P V S Kumar
