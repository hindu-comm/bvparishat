One of the effects of western Indology on India has been the research through the dictionary.

The technique first picks up a word and assumes its meaning through a "reputed" dictionary.

The follow up research becomes assumption. The technical analysis to determine the contextual  

meaning of the word through its use and application is not a part of the effort. There are strange

translated texts passing as "academic" contributions. The disease has now gone to create

linear translations of Indian poetry. Hobby scholars in India find the technique convenient

to cause noise in their social settings and then get picked up by English language word search.

Hope new India would recover from this mime. The gentleman in the quoted article has tried to  

to create Devanagari reversed from some English transliteration. There are enthusiastic

entrepreneurs..  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
