Sri Satyan Sharma ji,

Very good video.  

Your presentation is very truthful to Valmiki's text. Valmiki uses the word vimana to describe multistorey buildings also. In some portions of Sundara Kanda it is difficult to say whether he is referring to the flying instrument or to the building of Ravana.

You could have referred to the Bharadwja Vaimanik Shastra which also talks of pyramidal shapes.
