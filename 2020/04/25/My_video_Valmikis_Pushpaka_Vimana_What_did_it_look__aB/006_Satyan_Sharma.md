Namaste Aravinda Ji

  

Thanks for appreciating. The reason I did not refer to VaimaanikaShaastra is that whatever literature I read regarding it, cast doubts over its antiquity. As I remember, Indian Institute of Science and Technology did some research and found only one vimaanacapable of lift. It's antiquity is also debated. But I somewhere read that there is some manuscript with some related title, which is older than19th century kept in some manuscript library. If you could give me some more information about the text, kindly do.

  

Regards
