Namaste P V S Kumar ji. Yes, I agree, there is a lot of more work to be done on this. It'd be a pleasure to share the script with you. Here is it:

  

Vimanas or ancient Indian flying machines, are usually thought of only as mythical objects, because we usually think that our ancestors did not have the required technical knowledge to build any such machines for real.

  

All we find is mentions of Vimanas, how mighty and enormous they were. And also, we have TV serials depicting them. Recently, Ramanand Sagar's Ramayan has been retelecast on Doordarshan.

(show the poster of Ramayan in the background).

  

This video began with a scene from the same, which shows the Pushpaka Vimana. But does that match with the description of the vimana given by Valmiki in his Ramayana? (show a still of the said Ramayana's pushpaka vimana)

  

Before I answer that, let me tell you something about the word 'Vimana'. Those who study ancient Indian architecture are familiar with the word 'vimana' as being the long pyramidical and/or conical portion of a traditional Indian temple. (show image of a traditional temple).

  

So what is the connection between the flying Vimana and the stationary Vimana? An 11th century text on architecture called 'samaranganasutradhara' attributed to king bhoja, tells a brief story where Lord Brahma created Vimanas which were Viyadvartmavicarin or ' those which moved in the path of the sky'. Pushpaka was one of them. After a while, stationary structures imitating them were made for the decoration of cities or nagaras. These structures are called Prasadas. The present tradition is that they are called Prasadas in the north India and Vimanas in the south. (show multiple temples).

  

So if we take the said textual mention to be true, we can guess the average shape of those flying Vimanas by looking at the stationary ones.In that case, the depiction of Pushpaka Vimana in Ramanand Sagar's ramayana, is not correct. (show image comparing Ramanand's Pushpak and the stationary Vimana.)

  

Now let's move to the Valmiki Ramayana. (show a manuscript of Valmiki Ramayana).

  

*Although there are many details* about the pushpaka vimana found the Valmiki Ramayana, yet I will only discuss the very basic ones.

  

As far as the shape of the Vimana is concerned, Valmiki keeps calling it as 'resembling the summit of mount meru', 'resembling a mountain', and also he compares its shape with that of a cloud.

(put a combined picture of a mountain and a cloud in the background)

  

The mention of the pushpaka vimana's shape being similar to that of a mountain somehow agrees with the stationary Vimanas of ancient Indian temples. Why? Because both are pyramidical and/or conical structures. (again show some temple vimana).

  

Hence, once again, the depiction of the Vimana in the Television ramayana violates that of Valmiki. (show the Ramananda's Vimana and turn the frames colour to red to show it is wrong).

  

Regarding the colour of the Pushpaka Vimana, it seems that the similes like Rajataprabham, Candrasannibham and Suryasannibham, and Meghasankasham, suggest that the colour of the Vimana was somewhat light, and probably whitish.

  

About its sound, we find the word 'mahanada' in a variant reading of a verse, which suggests that it produced a very loud sound. Even a modern day Vimana or aircraft produces very loud sounds. (play a loud aircraft sound in the background and show the verse).

  

Valmiki mentions the Vimana having windows of Vatayanas, which clearly implies that it was a closed object and not an open one as shown in Ramanand Sagar's ramayan or even in some others. (show the windows of an aircraft and then show the Ramanand's Vimana and turn its colour to red again).

  

Valmiki also mentions the Vimana having a Hamsa or swan. Yet Valmiki does not credit the swan for the flight, because he does not say that Swan is making the Vimana fly in the sky or that the Swan is flying and Vimana is attached to it. Two commentators of Valmiki's Ramayana, Govindaraja and Rama, interpret Valmiki's expression 'hamsayukta' as 'hamsapratimayukta', suggesting that swan which Valmiki mentions, is not a real swan, but a structure which has the shape of a swan. (again show manuscript of Ramayana).

  

Many paintings and depictions of the Pushpaka Vimana join one or more swans at the front of the Pushpaka Vimana. My own interpretation of it is like that of a modular aircraft which has two main components, i.e., the flying components and the detachable pods. The flying components are the airframe, cockpit and engines, while the detachable pods which are like cabin etc., which carry the passengers and the load. (first show pictures of other interpretations. Then switch to showing the modular aircraft).

  

The airframe and the cockpit as one component, does have a swan-like or a bird-like shape, as can be seen in this clip and the detachable pod does resemble a conical structure. In this sense, Valmiki's Pushpaka Vimana might have been a modular aircraft, where the multiple detachable pods may have looked like major and minor peaks of a mountain, and the flying components as one unit, may have been interpreted as being a swan or swan's statue. (show stills of the upper part of the modular aircraft and compare it with the upper part of a swan flying., and compare a clipart of multiple peaks with that of the detachable pods.)

  

Hence, it seems that the Pushpaka Vimana described in the Valmiki Ramayana, might have been a modular aircraft. At the least we can be sure that it wasn't any way like the Pushpaka Vimana usually shown in paintings, and many television serials based on Ramayana, even the one created by Ramanand Sagar's ramayana. (talk directly into the camera and show your fucking face).

  

If there were no real Vimanas in the time of Valmiki, why did Valmiki not simply imagine a huge bird as a vimana? Why does he describe its shape like that of a mountain? Mountains don't fly, birds do. Also, as has been mentioned, he mentions a swan being attached to the Vimana, and yet does not give the credit of the flight to the swan, leading to the interpretation of the swan being just a structure having the shape of a swan.

  

Either Valmiki was a genius, that he imagined a non-bird shaped, mountain shaped, and a machine like structure as a Vimana, which looks like a modern day modular aircraft, or he might have known directly or indirectly.

  

Whatever be the case, now that you have some idea of how Valmiki himself described the Pushpaka Vimana, you could check if the depictions of Pushpaka Vimana being presented to you are in accordance with Valmiki or not.
