Dear Ganesan Sir,

I very well get your point. I can only say that I only know whatever is said in Sankara Digvijayam and other available biographies of Adi Sankara, from which I and other people like me came to know about the incident of Adi Sankara performing last rites of His mother.

Moreover, H.H. Swamiji is himself defending Adi Sankara on this very point through quoting from the text of this smriti. He is not neglecting this incident which is easy for Him to do.

Regarding the composition period of this smriti, I do not know the exact answer. But still, it is an important text for being quoted by someone Who is in direct succession of the lineage of Adi Sankara.

Regards,  
Harshit
