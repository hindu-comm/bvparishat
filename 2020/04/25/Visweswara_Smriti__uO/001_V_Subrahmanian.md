A few weeks ago I had initiated a search on this topic.

  
Then I tried looking for the text by the name 'Vishveshwara smriti'. I got the lead to visveswara samhita that sannyasins follow.

<https://hinduism.stackexchange.com/questions/14976/which-sm%E1%B9%9Btis-dharma-%C5%9B%C4%81stras-are-to-be-followed-in-kali-yuga>
//Sannyasins follow Visvesvara-samhita. In Tamil Nadu the Dharmasastra means the Vaidyanatha-Diksitiyam.//

  

Our good friend had helped me and said: Catalogue sites like[worldcat.org](http://worldcat.org/)show only one edition of Visvesavara smriti, from Machilipatnam in Telugu script. But its manuscripts are preserved in various places including Sringeri Math.

  

<http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/77413989>

  

Old libraries in Andhra may have its copies. Mysore Oriental Institute may have copy of manuscript.  

  

I have the // "Yati Dharma Sangrah" of Visweswara Sarawati published by Anandasharama// and read thru the same and did not find the topic required. So, there is mostly another text with the name 'Viswesvarasamhita' which, if procured, could be verified.
