Then the question would be, as far as I know, Buddha himself practiced yoga. Yogasutrasmaybe post buddha. However, Upanishadic yoga and Pranava in Vedas are pre-buddha. It is highly likely that he was influenced by Pranava.

Further, they say yogis experience Pranava during meditation. Buddha himself was not very anti-Vedic at least according to some scholars. Hence there may be some influence from Vedic thought and Aum may have been assumed.
