Dear Madhavji,

  

Yes, definitely! As I mentioned, Śrīcakrasaṃvaratantra --- I just have gone through --- gives numerousmantras with the Omkara. Butunfortunately, there is not a single discussion in the commentary of BavaBaTTa(dra) about Omkara. I would like to look into the books which you have just mentioned. If there is any problem to find any of them, I will definitely inform you.

  

Regards,
