I think the output of this topic is, briefly, Aum is there in Buddhist texts is well-known, but there are no such extraordinary traditional textual interpretations. Hence, we may assume that there was not that much different concept in the context of Aum in Buddism; therefore, there is no debut of any intellectual discussion/debate with Hindus.

  

I think this is the main substance of this thread. Please correct me if I am wrong.

  

Yourssincerely,
