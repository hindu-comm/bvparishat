My Buddhist friend Dhammaputta wrote to me regardingthis:

Prof. Deshpande is right.

There is no reference to "Om" in Pali Buddhism.

  

Mahayana Sutras & Vajrayana Tantras, yes indeed

Theravada says Mahayana is Hinduism in the guise of Buddhism

The irony is that non-Advaita Hindus say Advaita is Mahayana
Buddhism in the guise of Hinduism
