Dear Mr David Raigle,

  

At first, I should thank you fromthe bottom of my heart. Your enchanting scholarshipbrings some more light to me. There are many points, you left through your write up, shed light on various topics. I am really grateful to you and to your impressive website, such a treasure! I hope, in case, I will find obstacles in the future, you will give me some light.  
  

Thank you.

  

Yours sincerely,
