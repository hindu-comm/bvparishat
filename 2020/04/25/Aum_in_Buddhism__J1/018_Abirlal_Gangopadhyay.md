Dear Prof. Kannan,

  

Thank you foryour kindreply. I just found the book, edited by Sri Ganganatha Jha, in two volumes. It is great to see Dr. before my name, but I am still a PhD student, and perhaps you saw me in the department of Sanskrit Studies of the University of Hyderabad when you visited. I believe, with the grace of Bhagavan and blessings of Vidvans like you, I will certainlyget my degree in the near future.

  

Pranams.

  

Yours sincerely,
