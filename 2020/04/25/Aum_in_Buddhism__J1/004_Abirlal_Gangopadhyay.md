Respected Nagaraj-ji,

  

Thank you for those links. Even I went through a lecture where HH Dalai Lama was explaining the meaning of the famous mantra -Om̐ maṇipadme hūm̐. Naturally, he explained the meaning of Aum from a Buddhistperspective. I would like to hear more, from a Sanskrit text (maybe derived from Tibetan text), about this. I hope David Reigle-ji will help me in thisregard. For general information, I went through theŚrīcakrasaṃvaratantra, but unfortunately, there is not a single discussion about Aum, though the same come there frequently.

  

Yours sincerely,
