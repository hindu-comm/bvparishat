Dear Eminent Scholars,

  

I am looking for the proceedings of the **International Seminar on  
Bhart≈óhari (BH)** held at Delhi in 2003 to mark the hundredth anniversary of  
Motilal Banarsidass, the publishing house. The research papers have been published as a volume entitled **Bhartrhari: Language thought and reality** by Chaturvedi, M.

Kindly share the e-book if someone has it.

  

Thanks in advance,

  

  

Regards,

Praveen
