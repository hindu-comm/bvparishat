Wakankarji,

  

Apart from SP Narang's Kalidasa Bibliogrpahy published in 1976 (which is available online), I could not find any information on later Kalidasa bibliographical works in Englsih or Hindi.

Could you please provide name of authors/publishers of later works if you remember the details?  

  

regards  
shankara
