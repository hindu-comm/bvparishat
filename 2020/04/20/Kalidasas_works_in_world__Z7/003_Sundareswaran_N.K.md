Dear Swasti Sharmaji,

  

This may be of some use:

<https://bibliothek.univie.ac.at/fb-suedasien_tibet_buddhismuskunde/files/BIBLIOGRAPHIE-Kalidasa_HP_20110308.pdf>

  

Also the list attached, comprising editions, translations into various foreign languages and studies on Abhijnanashakuntalammay be useful. The list may not be exhaustive. Also some typographical errors also might have crept in. However it may be of use.
