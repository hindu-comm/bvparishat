Dear Shri Shankar,

  

One Prof.of Sanskrit from Bhopal,I think,Prof Shukla, has written on Kalidasa.Now, I forgot the details.I met him in Bhopal in 1991 December but,then list contact.

  

I think,Dr.S.C.Banerji also has some Bibliographical work on this.

  

In course of time,I lost contact with this kind of books and forgot the details,for which I feel sorry.

  

You are the best person to enlighten us on such rare things.

  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
