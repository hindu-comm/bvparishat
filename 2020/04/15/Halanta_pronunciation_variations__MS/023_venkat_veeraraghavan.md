Dear Dr. Kannan,

  

Thank you for an exposition worth reading again and again.

I am an ignoramus when it comes to scripture and shastra so kindly bear with me..

  

Its interesting how the vocalisation of pranava starts with akaara (kanTa) middles with ukaara (oshTa) and ends in makaara(oshTa and cerebral)..the final laya is in bindu.

By this it covers the entire gamut of range of the frequency of expression and hence is representative of Brahman for having covered all manifested nama-rupa.

अर्धमात्रा-लाघवं पुत्रोत्सवं मन्यन्ते वैयाकरणाः  

Apparently the key to all expression was kept as close to silence as possible(?)

The idea was apparently to find the most efficient mode of expression while conserving energy/words.

  

The other thought that comes to mind is that in Ayurveda it is clearly mentioned by Acharya Charaka that natural urges are not to be suppressed.--> A natural urge happens when prAna has been churned up and is flowing towards a pre-assigned destination.

  

In the case of prachodayAt....with a dirghasvaritaa just before the last t in (yA"t) I was wondering if the Pandits gave a natural continuation to the t with halanta in order to avoid abruptly stopping the prAna that has been churned up with the previous vocalisation at yA".

  

Is there anything in vyaakarana or in shikshaa that gives guidelines for manifesting expression of halanta while chanting and in japa?

  

Thank you to all the Vidvans who have contributed their thoughts to this thread.

  

Shri Paturi Garu--> Thanks for the video showing difference between halanta and ukaaraanta in Vedic chanting. The difference is crystal clear.

As a counterpoint please find the relevant audio of prachodayat (from dhanvantari gayatri) i managed to catch this morning..the ukaara is rather pronounced in this case.

  

Thanks to Shri Madhav ji for bringing up Kurriyalukaaram in Tamil.

You wrote-->"Theoretically, theidea that "consonants could not be pronounced independently" is true fully of the non-nasal स्पर्श "stop" consonants, where the oral contact needs to be released in order for the consonant to be audible."

 Incidentally: In Tamil the vowels are called uyirezhuthhu (uyir=life / shakti) as opposed to consonants mei-ezhutthu (mei-Truth/Shiva)...

again I am no scholar and just thinking aloud here...

The apparent inference here is that the consonants cannot be expressed without support from the vowels. All this ties in well with the "vAgarthAviva samprktau...pArvati-paramasvarau"  

In other words consonants need the support of vowelisation of some sort to manifest.

  

Shri Balu Ramakrishnan ji Uppu in Tamil is spelt with an ukara at the end (உப்பு) the pronunciation though is as you say with a reduced expression of ukaara at the end. Thanks for bringing this up. Have been using without reflection all along.

  

  

To sum up how does a child whose mothertongue is Sanskrit (and not Tamil /Telugu/Kannada/Marathi) express halanta? Is there a default setting here?

  

Thanks

  

Venkat
