Dear Venkat gaaru,

  

First of all, I appreciate Venkat gaaru for pointing out the variation in pronunciation. The reason for pronouncing prachodayaat as prachodaya**tu** is **M**other **T**ongue **I**nfluence(MTI).  

  

Generally, borrowed nouns from English to Telugu are nativized. For example, Eng. '***bus***' has become '***bassu***', **train** has become ***treenu***, **hand** has become **haandu** in Telugu respectively. How Telugu speakers are able to nativize English nouns into Telugu? Because of World Knowledge.  

  

I would like to know that are there any studies on Phonological, Morphological, Syntactic Variations in Sanskrit. For example, Bh. Krishnamurti (2000) based on Occupational Vocabulary Dictionaries, he has divided the Telugu region (Present Telangana and Andhra Pradesh) into four parts viz. puurva mandalam (Kalinga 'Eastern'), dakshina mandalam (Rayalaseema),  uttara mandalam (Telangana), madhya mandalam (Coastal region). Each variety has its own identity. Likewise, are there any studies on Sanskrit dialects.

  

  

  

Regards,

Praveen
