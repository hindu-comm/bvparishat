A similar question I remember in Maheshwara Sutra why they are pronounced as हयवरट् etc. with अ added to hals in the Maheshwara sutras? The hals written at the end of each Maheshwara sutra is not counted and deleted. I remember these are added 'a' is added as the consonants could not be pronounced independently. That may be the reason the samvrita ukara is added in their prounciation. Exactly said by some scholars a similar variety as example uppu is pronounced in malayalam and tamil which is different from u in kuruppu the difference being the first two u-s and last u. The same is indicated by Prof.Nagaraj. It is never pronounced as उ which is regular and alwas विवृत. There should be some name in linguistics, which I don't remember.

  

Thank you.
