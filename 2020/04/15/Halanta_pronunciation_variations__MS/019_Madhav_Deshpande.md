Dear Dr. Bhat,

  

  Theoretically, theidea that "consonants could not be pronounced independently" is true fully of the non-nasal स्पर्श "stop" consonants, where the oral contact needs to be released in order for the consonant to be audible. Nasals and sibilants are often treated as continuants.
The term "continuant" is defined as "sounds without a complete closure in the oral cavity." The nasals are described by the Prātiśākhyas as नासिकाविवरणाद् आनुनासिक्यम्. That nasal passage can remain open even when there is oral closure in the pronunciation of ङ, ञ, ण, न, म. Vowels and sibilants are often described as being विवृतकरण or अस्पृष्टकरण indicating that there is no closure in the oral cavity in their pronunciation. However, in the case of the pronunciation of the Śivasūtras, the dictum हकारादिष्वकार उच्चारणार्थ: is used for all consonantslisted there. Given the length of strings like खफछठथचटतव्, it is impossible to pronounce them without assuming the separating उच्चारणार्थ अकार. With best regards,
