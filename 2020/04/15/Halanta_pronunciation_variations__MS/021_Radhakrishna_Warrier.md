At 24:02, “paśyat” (पश्यत्) is pronounced as “paśyatŭ” with saṃvṛta ukāra at the end, whereas later, the last “tu” is pronounced with a full hrasva ukāra as “tu”. The difference between a full halant and asaṃvṛta ukāra is the difference between the last 'p' in the English work keep and the "pŭ" in uppŭ (salt in Malayalam/Tamil) which again is different from the "pu" with the full hrasva 'u' of uppu (salt in Kannada/Telugu).
