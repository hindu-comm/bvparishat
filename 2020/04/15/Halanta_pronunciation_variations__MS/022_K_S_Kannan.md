Incidentally,  

I discovered on my own in my student days that

there is a regular, serial, progression *from the inmost to the outmost*

\- from the throat to the lips, in the *sthAna-*s of pronunciation  

of the 5 *varga*-s viz. *ku, cu, Tu, tu, pu.*

  

Has this seriality been noted in any Sanskrit texts ?

  

(Modern books on phonetics of course provide a picture of the mouth

pointing out the various positions, whereby it should become obvious  

to careful observers). But has this idea of directional sequentiality been  

articulated/explicated/exploited in any Sanskrit grammatical/other texts  

(or even modern grammars of Sanskrit) ?

  

For that matter, even the pronunciation of *oMkAra*

has ***a***, a *kaNThya* at the beginning,

and ***m***, an *oShThya* at the end

(as do *ku* and *pu* respectively in the 5 *varga*-s).

The 5-by-5 matrix (*kAdi-mAvasAna*) almost symbolises the progression  

from *vivRta* to *saMvRta*, from speech to silence, as it were.

  

Descriptions of *tapas* (wherein one withdraws from the transactions in the world,

and delves deep into the recesses of one's own being)  

note *saMvRtAsya-tva* as a feature of the tApasic posture.

  

While *vyAkaraNa* is a case of a setting forth, an articulation, a giving expression to (one's own *vivakShA*),

the opposite, the silence, a withdrawal, figures in the latter when one assumes (almost resumes) silence.  

(Strictly business. Speak if you indeed have to. Speech is silver, silence is gold).  

  

Panini could as well have framed his first *sUtra* with ***Adaic*** as the first word,

which symbolises what *vyakaraNa* in fact is - an "emanation" and an "elongation", typified by ***A***  

= an explication - of what is in one's own mind in order to convey an idea  

\- "***artha-gatyarthaH shabda-prayogaH***"  

\- the progression being from *artha* (the idea in the mind) to *shabda* (in the mouth) \[of the speaker himself\],  

(and even onwards, from the \[utterance of the\] speaker to the \[comprehension in the\] hearer).

  

While all these considerations are by no means negated, Panini preferred to use *vRddhi* \[as the first word\],  

meaning an "expansion", an "augmentation", an "advancement", an "increase", a "waxing (eloquent)".  

  

The structure of a typical Paninian *sUtra* accordingly is,

"**In** \[order to convey\] **this sense,** \[use\] **this**",  

respectively indicated by  

the Locative and the Nominative, *saptamI* and *prathamA.*  

  

To add a philological note: *  
*

*vRdh* is a cognate of *bRh, brMh* (perhaps even *ruh* and *vi-ruh*), a growth.

(Also cf. *upabRMhaNa*, *samupabRMhaNa* - as in

*itihasa-purANAbhyAM vedaM* ***samupabRMhayet*** (*Mahabharata* usage), and

***vedopabRMhaNArthAya*** *tAv agrAhayata prabhuH* (*Ramayana* usage), and

*shata-valshM **viroha** sahasra-valsham * (Vedic usage).  

  

Speech is thus the *\<sam+> \<upa+> bRMhaNa  
*

*(=* indeed a *vyAkaraNa)* of *vivakShA,*

an opening of the mouth in order to *ex*-press, to give vent to, and to expatiate upon, what is in the mind.  

(This can also be said to be comparable to the *nAma-rUpa-vyAkaraNa* (Ch.Up.)  

= a morphology - from the amorphous to the morphous,

from the undifferentiated to the differentiated, the nameless to the named).  

*  
*

And the last *sUtra* ( *a a* ) is one of withdrawal, a reticence,

once the function of speech is over - a reverse "progression"

\- from *karman* to *a-karman,* as it were  

(a veritable *naiShkarmya*, as *vAc* is a function of a *karmendriya*).

  

(That the consideration of auspiciousness both at the beginning and the end,

\- with the usage of *vRddhi* as the first word and *a* as the last words -  

weighed in in the Paninian work is also well-known. That he "sacrificed" the *uddeshya-vidheya* sequence

in the opening *sUtra* for the sake of this is, too, quite known).

  

The last *sUtra* also throws a hint perhaps, somewhat akin to

"Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one has to remain silent"

(Wittgenstein).

  

I should perhaps have started a separate thread for this,

but thought it can be woven into this.
