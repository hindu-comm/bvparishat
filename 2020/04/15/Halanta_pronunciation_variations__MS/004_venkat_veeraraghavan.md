Shri Shashi Joshi ji--> Please find relevant audio attached.  

I did not get the dhanvantari gayatri where they chanted prachodayaatu but I have something equivalent where halanta is pronounced with ukaara. Tamil /Kannadiga pronunciation sample (Challakere) is also attached.

  

Shri Harissh ji--> Thanks for your feeback. I am not suggesting the ukaara is a result of pratishakhya, but since there is difference in chanting based on region (desha) I was wondering if there is a clear directive in the pratishakyas or shiksha.

  

Shri Praveen ji--> I am not worried about people from Andhradesha pronouncing Bus as Bassu, but pronouncing prachodayat as prachodayaatu is a problem because the standards for Vedic recitation are much higher than for loukika bhasha.
