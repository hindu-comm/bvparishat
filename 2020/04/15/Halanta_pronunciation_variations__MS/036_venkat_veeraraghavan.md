The other issue we need to consider is that Vedic oral tradition predates the written records by quite a long periodof time.

  

So this is more a case of original sound....written record.....recreated sound.

  

We are trying to find if we are recreating the right sound.

Obviously replacing a halanta akshara with a whole akshara will change tonality, chandas schema...meaning, create an apashabda which is considered a sin and the effect of the mantra.

  

So the idea here is to see what the seer of the mantra was intending instead of trying to experiment with our very limited intellects.

We have neither the intellectual ability nor the tapobala of our ancestors.
