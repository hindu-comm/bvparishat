Dear Vidvans

Everyday 7 AM on TTD SVBC channel there is a parayana of Narayana kavacham, Rama raksha stotram and Durga stotram along with other parayanas for corona nivaarana.

What caught my attention was the pronunciation of halanta by the Telugu pandits. Prachodayat is pronounced prachodayatu the last tu is pronounced as tu in tubhyam.  
A variation of this is found among Tamils and Kannadigas who pronounce this as tu in prachodayat....as a sort of elongated tuuu which is hard to describe in words.  
For reference please google the video of challakere brothers Gayatri dhyanam.  
You will find the relevant part at 9.28 onwards.

What is given in the pratishakhyas and shiksha texts regarding this?  
I understand just like anusvara the pronunciation varies from desha based on local dialectic inflections.

I request the vidvans to clarify this matter.

Thanks

Venkat
