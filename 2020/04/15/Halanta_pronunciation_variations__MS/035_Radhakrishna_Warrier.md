I feel that you cannot prolong the pronunciation of a pure consonant like k, t, p etc. Trying to prolong ends up in adding asaṃvṛta ukāra.

  

What is asaṃvṛta ukāra?

  

Take the case of the English work "keep". You cannot prolong the last 'p'. This, I assume, is the pure halanta pronunciation.

  

Now compare the pronunciation of the word for salt in Malayalam/Tamil and Kannada/Telugu

  

In Malayalam/Tamil, the pronunciation of the word for salt isuppŭ. 

  

This is neither "upp" nor "uppu". It is actually a very short vowel called saṃvṛta ukāram in Malayalam and kuṟṟiyal ukaram in Tamil.
Although the ancient grammarians related it to theukāra, in my view, it has pretty little to do with 'u'. It can be described in my view as a schwa of short duration. In fact, it can be prolonged but the prolongation doesn't result in u or ū (i.e., by prolonging it, it does not turn into either a hrasva or a deergha 'u'.)

  

In Telugu/Kannada, the pronunciation is uppu with a regular short (hrasva) u. The first u and the last u are not different.

  

In Kerala, many Sanskrit reciters end halanta words like“paśyat”, when these come at the end of a sentence, with thissaṃvṛta ukāra and pronounce it as “paśyatŭ”. This is very different from "paśyatu" with a hrasva u at the end. Because of the regional language influence, these reciters sometimes voice the last 't' into 'd' and the pronunciation becomes “paśyadŭ”.
