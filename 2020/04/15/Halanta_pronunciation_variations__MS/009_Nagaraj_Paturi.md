Dear discussants,

  

The vowel like pronunciation heard after the pronunciation of ending hal in instances such as त् in प्रचोदयात् is not the same as u in bassu the Telugu borrowed form of the English bus. It is not even the u in upa, or in uttama or in kanu in kalupu or in kalamu. The Telugu speaking Vedic scholars never pronounceप्रचोदयात् asप्रचोदयात्तु or asप्रचोदयातुThat sound is u like but not a full u, it is as if u is pronounced to its first one fourth part only.Did any one of you notice any Telugu speaking Sanskrit or Vedic scholar pronounce ओं तत् सत् asओं तत् सतु ? What appears as a vowel like particularly u like pronunciation at endings such as inप्रचोदयात् is the result of a musical / sasvara rendering of the mantra, of course with a Telugu local variation of such a rendering.
