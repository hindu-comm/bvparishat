Nikhil ji, in my view, the ancients did not pronounce the visarga as a full ha. If they did, words such as duḥkha (दुःख) and niḥśeṣa
(निःशेष) would have been pronounced as duhakha (दुहख) and nihaśeṣa (निहशेष). However, these words are pronounced as dukkha (दुक्ख) and niśśeṣa (निश्शेष).

  

Pronouncing the visarga as a full ha seems to have been a trend developed long after the correct pronunciation of visarga was lost. The visarga itself might have developed as a relic of another sound in the parent language of Sanskrit, perhaps an ‘s’ sound.

Radhakrishna Warrier
