He might have said kurriyalukaram - pronounced kuTTriyalukaram = kurriyal + ukaram. ukaram or ukAra has one mAtra, kurriyalukaram has 1/2 mAtra. The ukaram is pronounced kurriyal in specific situations in Tamil. Example uppu - salt - first u is regular and the u in pu at the end is the kurriyal variety. The rules can be found in the tolkAppiyam. However any native Tamil speaker will say this naturally. All consonants, except the makAra, at the end of Sanskrit sentences are pronounced with kurriyalukaram by Tamil paNDita-s.
