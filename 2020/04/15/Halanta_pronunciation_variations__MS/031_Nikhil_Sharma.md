Namaskar,

  

Thanks for all your views. I can take out 2 streams out of this discussion -1) That the extension of the halant sound at the end of a mantra was meant as a teaching device 2) For smooth landing at the end of the mantra.

  

In either case, it begs the question that how is it really meant to be pronounced given that intonation is so important in Vedic chanting? What difference will it make in pronunciation if the halant is replaced with a full matra (त)?

  

Regards,

Nikhil
