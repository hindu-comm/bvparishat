Namaste Radhakrishna Ji,

  

Your note makes a lot of sense. I have been pondering over this for a long time and my assumption is that the same issue will extend to visarga pronunciation as well. All mantras ending with visarga are always pronounced as if the whole matra rather than short aspiration. For example, to the ear it sounds like Namahaनमह rather than Namah
नमः. Whether this was meant as a teaching device alone, it sure has translated into practice, at least in what I have been exposed to.

  

Dhanyawaad,

Nikhil
