Dear Dr. Bhat,

  

  Though the term *svarabhakti* is not traditionally used in this context of the pronunciation of a final consonant, it literally means "a vocal segment." I have seen the term "vocoid" used by the late Professor Kenneth Pike to refer to a vocal segment,which is phonetically a vowel, though not a phonological one. In the present case, what this would mean is that in the pronunciation of *tat(u),* this final ultra-short *u*is phonetically a vowel, but not long enough to create a full syllable. I like theanalogy of the *uccāraṇārtha* use of "a" in the Śivasūtras.
Pronunciation of consonants, especially the *sparśa* "stop" consonants, involves two phases. There is closure caused by the touch of the *karaṇa*, which in most cases is a part of the tongue, and the *sthana*"point of articulation." After the closure, there has to be releaseof this closure for the sound to become audible. This release phase can extend into a full vowel, or be a very short one in the case of word-final consonants. Professor Pike was my senior colleague at the University of Michigan and his book on phonetics was widely used in those days. When I was working on translating the text of the Śaunakīya Prātiśākhya, I was fortunate to have had long discussions with Professor Kenneth Pike and Professor John Catford, who were some of the best known phoneticians of their generation.
