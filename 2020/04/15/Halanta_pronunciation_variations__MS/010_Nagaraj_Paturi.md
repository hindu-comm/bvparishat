To articulate the situation better, it is better to say that the vowel like , u like ending heard during the Telugu speaking Vedic scholar's pronunciation of halantas such as त् is the result of the reciter's attempt for the ease of musical smooth landing at such halanta endings, because of the reciter's cultural cognitive perspective that a rendering without such a vowel like ending for the pronunciation of a line ending hal is unmusically abrupt.

  

The vowel like rendering at such halanta line endings is seen as a musical reverberation facilitating smooth landing.
