Dear venkatji

  

As far as I know , there is nothing in the pratishakhya or shiksha which allows the ucchaarana of takaaraanta as tu

  

It is at best a regional influence

  

Also there is no regional variation of the anusvara in any of the shiksha or pratishakhya texts. The variation is according to sampradaya

  

Whether that is correct or not is a matter of different discussion

  

Thanks

Harish
