Shri Harissh ji--> I was wondering if there is a clear directive in the pratishakyas or shiksha *on how exactly to pronounce halanta in Veda mantras*. (I missed typing the last part which could lead to confusion). Is there any rule that says a mantra should not be abruptlystopped at halanta? Because when I put this question a Swami from Rishikesh said something to that effect.

  

Shri Praveen ji--> (I am not worried about people from Andhradesha pronouncing Bus as Bassu,) ....Its funny you should mention Telugu people pronouncing Bus as Bussu because a similar quirk exists with Tamils who say bussu kind of mirroring the way Prachodayat(u) is is pronounced in the Challakere audio without the extension of the sound. Never realised that being a native Tamil :)

  

Yes, the swaras are given importance in Vedic recitation. It was therefore shocking for me when a Shukla YVedin who conducts Chandi homas regularly in Kanchi insisted that the Swaras are not important and that Rshis included swaras so that people will not trip over the swaras in haste and mispronounce which I found rather shocking given clear directives like "mantro hina svarato..."
