In this YouTube video, I hear words such asजगत्, असत्, and भिषक् (Jagat, asat, and bhishak) pronounced with a clear and slightly prolongedsaṃvṛta ukāra. Please note that this pronunciation has nothing to do with “u” and resembles regularukārain no way, as I explained in one of my previous posts here. I think it was needed for the words to jell well with the style of recitation.

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
