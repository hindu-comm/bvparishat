Namaste,

  

If you observe the tongue touching position, and how your push the air out between त् and तू they are completely different. For the smooth landing at the end of the mantra, it should be pronounced as त् but prolong the sound, but it if we pronounceतू it will be akshara dosha. As my guru mentiones, akshara, svara both are important while chanting veda mantras.

  

Dhanyavaad,

Kishore
