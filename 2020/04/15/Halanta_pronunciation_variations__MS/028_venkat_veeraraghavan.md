Thanks for your reply.

  

The one I sent was the daily 7 AM Corona nivaaranashlokason SVBC channelwhich the lead Pundit chants and people chant after him.

It was not a teaching section.

  

If you listen to the videos sent by Paturi Garu, you will find the distinction made. This somehow does not come out in this case.

Try the above link at 7AM IST tomorrow or afterwards.
