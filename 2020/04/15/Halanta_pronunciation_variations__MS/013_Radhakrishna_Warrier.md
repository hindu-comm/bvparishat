He must have said kuṟṟiyal ukaram (குற்றியலுகரம்) pronounced nowadays as kuṯṟiyal ukaram but in the ancient days as kuṯṯiyal ukaram, the ṯ being an alveolar t which is neither the dental or the retroflex t. This means very short ukāram, what we call in Malayalam as Saṃvṛta ukāram and what I represent in my posts as ŭ. This is exactly what I mentioned in my previous post in this thread. This is the last short vowel sound one hears when a Malayali saysnāḍŭ (country), kāḍŭ (forest) etc.
