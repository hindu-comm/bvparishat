Sorry pressed send before completing ðŸ˜€

  

So is the case with the svarabhakti. And the svarabhakti of Telugu pundits have more Bhakti to the svara than Tamil pundits - if you get the joke. Thatâ€™s why the end sounds like the vowel u - but I can hear the difference.

  

There is a reason for pronouncing the consonants the way Vedic pundits say them. As Prof Deshpande pointed out you canâ€™t have a pure stop - nasals, fricatives and semivowels excluded. Thatâ€™s an excellent point.
I donâ€™t want to go into details here but the rules of mAtra also come into play here, apart from other things. Itâ€™s actually fairly complicated - at least in the yajur.

  

Also teachers will tend to lengthen the last vowel or consonant stop while teaching. This is likely because the student knows they have to start repeating after that and can mentally prepare themselves for that. I am talking about traditional learning not reciting from books.

  

I have noticed that my teachers would recite with correct mAtra while doing plain recitations, but while teaching, the end of the sentence vowel or consonant would be lengthened well beyond usual maatra lengths. The recording you sent sounds like one of those cases.
