The Ministry of AYUSH has released an advisory on Ayurveda’s immunity boosting measures for self care during the COVID-19 crisis. It says, in the wake of the Covid 19 outbreak, entire mankind across the globe is suffering. Enhancing the body’s natural defence system (immunity) plays an important role in maintaining optimum health

While there is no medicine for COVID-19 as of now, it will be good to take preventive measures which boost our immunity in these times. The simplicity of awareness about oneself and the harmony each individual can achieve by uplifting and maintaining his or her immunity is emphasized across Ayurveda’s classical scriptures, said the advisory.

Ministry of AYUSH has recommended the following self-care guidelines for preventive health measures and boosting immunity with special reference to respiratory health. These are supported by Ayurvedic literature and scientific publications:-

Recommended Measures

    minutes as advised by Ministry. 3.  Spices like Haldi (Turmeric), Jeera (Cumin), Dhaniya (Coriander) and
    Lahsun (Garlic) are recommended in cooking.

Ayurvedic Immunity Promoting Measures

    sugar free Chyavanprash. 2.  Drink herbal tea / decoction (Kadha) made from Tulsi (Basil),
    Dalchini (Cinnamon), Kalimirch (Black pepper), Shunthi (Dry Ginger)
    and Munakka (Raisin) – once or twice a day. Add jaggery (natural
