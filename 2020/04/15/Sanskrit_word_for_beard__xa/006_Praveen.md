Dear Sampath Kumarji,*  
*

*  
*

*kēsaraḥ* means Moustache. The one who has the *kēsaraḥ* 'Moustache' is called *kēsarī*. Since beard and mustache is there only for males. The word *kesaraH* should be a masculine noun. Even the word *smaśṛ* 'beard' is also masculine. We got *kēsaratvaṃ* and **smaśṛ*tvaṃ* from Male Lion because it has the mustache.
