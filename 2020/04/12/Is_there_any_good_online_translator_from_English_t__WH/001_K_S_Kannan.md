There may indeed be many who need this service.

If there are people who make money out of suggesting names,

why not this?

  

In fact, it would be good if the formation of a group that can take up this service is encouraged.

While BVP may not be interested, or would not like to involve, in any commercial activity,

guiding the formation of a guild of translators from and into Sanskrit  

from and into various Indian languages may be desirable.

  

This may provide some useful engagement to many who can spare a few hours a week.

There may similarly be many who need proof-readers.

And Sanskrit teachers at various levels/for various texts.

A directory, thus, of who can teach/translate/proof-read/sing what etc. etc. may also be desirable.

  

A **Sanskrit Talent Pool** of those who enjoy doing this  

for a reasonable fee/free may be a desideratum.

  

There surely are many causes where  

free service is welcome and is well deserved.
