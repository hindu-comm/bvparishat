Dear Prof. K S Kanna Sir,

  

Yes, you have rightly pointed out. One may take up this assignment and prepare a directory of Sanskrit Translators. It can be a good asset to the field of Translation Studies. National Translation Mission, Central Insititute of Indian Languages, Mysuru is maintaining a Translators directory. One may contact Dr. Tariq Khan, NTM, CIIL, Mysuru who is an incharge of NTM, CIIL, Mysuru. One may find the details of the translators from the below weblink:

<http://www.ntm.org.in/languages/english/nrtdb.aspx>

  

Interested scholars (Translators from any Indian Language to Indian Language) can register from the above weblink.

  

  

  

Regards,

Praveen
