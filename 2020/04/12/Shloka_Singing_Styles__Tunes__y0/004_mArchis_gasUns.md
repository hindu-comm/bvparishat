Vishvas, thanks, I have not seen the playlist before. Listened to it now.

  

In महाराष्ट्ररीतिः, kerala rItiH I can understand where it comes from. But in तरलरीतिः I hardly can. Please advise - was the idea close to what Usha wrote? साङ्गीतकः- singing mode? अवध रीतिः- from Avadha?

  

shankara rItiH - geographically not contected? मुफ़ाइलुन् is a name of a person?

  

नारायणि-स्तुतिः is a sample of genre, not of style, right, or? Same style in मगध संंवाद रीतिः, that means it comes from Magadha?

  

Thanks for such a great list and forgive me my questions.

  

M.
