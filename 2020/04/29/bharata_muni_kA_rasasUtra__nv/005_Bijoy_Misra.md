Dear Siddharthsaheb,

My entry into Sanskrit happened in exploring the neurology of speech.

Brain science is infant in this. Probing the thought segmentation in

creating expression would need still higher resolution sensors not

invented yet. We are simply creating a framework for future experimentation.

Currently we are in vowels. We might take our work to Canberra  

next year. I admire the massive analytic work by the Indian

scholars which would need still further public exposition. Let there be

new theories on the drums and the strings. The neurology of shruti

is another enigma. India is unique in this field.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
