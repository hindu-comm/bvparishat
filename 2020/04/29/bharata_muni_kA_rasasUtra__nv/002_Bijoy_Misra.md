Dear Vasantji,

Excellent exposition. It will be helpful to many generations of students and teachers.

Congratulations for the great effort. Possibly viśvanātha should be added to extend to

rasānanda. You do allude through Bhattanayaka.

A few years ago, we engaged here to analyze here the sāṅkhya enunciation

that the sthāyibhāva could have different potential for excitation. We created a technical

paper called rasa-sāṅkhya. I can send to people who may be technically oriented.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
