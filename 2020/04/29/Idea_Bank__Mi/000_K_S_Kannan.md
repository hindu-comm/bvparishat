For the Project Bank (of IA/others):

Various Indological journals keep publishing two items regularly:

\- books received

\- books reviewed.

It would help researchers a great deal if there are regular compilations of these  

\- just lists, if there are copyright concerns -

and published as yearly, 5-yearly, and 10-yearly consolidations.

  

This may not require enormous funding,  

but mainly proper/easy access to the journals and regular/systematic output.

It could be a team effort, nut a formal team needs to be constituted,

(rather than just some individuals making their own contributions regularly/irregularly)  

with requisite deliverables clearly stated.
