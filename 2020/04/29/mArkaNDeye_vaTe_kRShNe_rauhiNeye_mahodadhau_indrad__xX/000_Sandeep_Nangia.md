Dear Scholars,  
  
I am trying to find the exact reference to the verse below:  
  
मार्कण्डेये वटे कृष्णे रौहिणेये महोदधौ ।  
इन्द्रद्युम्नसरः स्नात्वा पुनर्जन्म न विद्यते ॥  
  
This verse appears under the entry of रौहिणेय in शब्दकल्पद्रुमः and is indicated there to be from तीर्थतत्त्व (which I gather is one of Raghunandan's works - also known as तीर्थयात्रतत्त्व).  
  
I am trying to get hold of तीर्थतत्त्व (or तीर्थयात्रतत्त्व) . Is there an online version available? Or at least can somebody verify me the exact location of this verse? Very likely, this work might be available only in Bangla script (but that is OK - I will be able to read it).  
  
Thanks and regards,  
  
Sandeep
