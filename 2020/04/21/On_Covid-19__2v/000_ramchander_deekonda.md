Respected Scholars,  
  
My brother Dr.Narsing Rao Deekonda has written the following verses in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic. Kindly throw your valuable glance on them.  
  
  
1)मुषिताः सर्वलोकास्तु  
प्रकृतिर्यदि दूषिता ।  
सा यदि भूषिता सर्वैः  
नित्यानन्दप्रदा भवेत्।।  
  
2) प्रकृतिः सर्वभूतानां  
मातेति न हि विस्मरेत्।  
विस्मृता सा विनाशाय  
तत्र का परिदेवना ।।  
  
3) गुणमयी हि मातेयं  
पाति नित्यं गुणान्वितान् ।  
अगुणिनस्तु पश्यन्ती  
भृशं दुःखपरिप्लुता ।।  
  
4) अतः सर्वे वयं नूनं  
यावच्छक्यमिमामितः।  
पूजयामः सदा भक्त्या  
सर्वभूतहिताय हि।।  
  
  
1) The whole world will be destroyed if Nature is defiled. When adorned, She will be the source of happiness perpetually.  
2) One should not forget that Nature is the mother of all the beings. When neglected, She may be the cause of destruction. There is nothing to lament about it.  
3) This Mother indeed being meritorious, protects the merited while She is extremely saddened seeing the ones devoid of merits.  
4) We together, therefore, for sure and to the best of our ability adore Her hereafter for the welfare of all beings.  
  
Regards,  
Ramchander Deekonda
