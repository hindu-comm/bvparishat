Thanks for drawing attention to a beautiful and important lesson,

relevant especially in the context of COVID.

  

Whereas the East always respected Nature, and our environment with high regard and respect,

the West has always been riding roughshod with Nature. The very idiotic idiosyncrasy and idiom  

of "conquering Nature" bespeaks of the megalomania it is imbued with - for centuries.

  

While the East has revered the Earth with words such as  

*samudra-vasane devi, parvatastana-maNDite,*

& the Waters as

*tA Apo devIr iha mAm avantu,*

the Wind and the Fire as *pavana* and *pAvaka*,

the West always dreamt of bespoiling lands as their exploits;

treating all other civilisations as trash, as heathens in their blindness.

  

I just googled "conquering nature", and I got this as the very first note:

The very framework of science is to conquer nature. That is the very terminology of science—conquest of nature. We have to overpower nature and we have to destroy all mysteries of nature, and we have to find all the keys of power, wherever it is. But the very idea takes you away from nature, makes you antagonistic to it and becomes destructive. The [ecology](https://www.soulveda.com/spiritual-leader/ecology-and-the-spiritual-process/) of the earth has been destroyed by this power seeking. In the outside, in the inside—both—the natural rhythm of life is disturbed.

I have heard…

A very unusual idea occurred one day to Frederick of Prussia. He was in the country when he saw some sparrows eating some grains of wheat. He started to think and reached the conclusion that these small birds consumed a million pecks of wheat a year in his kingdom. This cannot be allowed. They have to be either conquered or destroyed.

Since it was difficult to exterminate them, he promised a price for each dead sparrow. All Prussians became hunters and soon there were no more sparrows in the country. What a great victory.Whether you become powerful in a scientific way, or you become powerful in a psychic way, it makes no difference.  

Frederick of Prussia was very happy. He celebrated the event as a great conquest over nature. The king was very happy until the following year when he was told that caterpillars and locusts had eaten the crops because without sparrows the whole rhythm of life was destroyed. Sparrows go on eating caterpillars and locusts. There being no sparrows, the whole crop was destroyed by caterpillars. Then it was necessary to bring in sparrows from abroad. And the king said, ‘I certainly have made a mistake. God knows what he is doing.’

The great scientific minds of this century are coming, by and by, slowly, reluctantly, to recognise that a great mistake has been done.
