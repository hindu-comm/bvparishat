Rishi ji,

  

Yes, it may be useful to skim the work beyond its TOC.

  

In a cursory glance, I noticed that starting around p.125, the author surveys Sambuka story from Puranas, other Sanskrit Ramayanas, classical Skt literature, Jain Ramayanas, vernacular Ramayanas, and more! Looks quite comprehensive, although I'm sure one can't possibly cover every iteration there is out there.
