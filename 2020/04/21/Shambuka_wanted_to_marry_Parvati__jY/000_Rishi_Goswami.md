Harih Sharanam

Namami vidvAmsah

I am searching for various resources where Shambukavadha is mentioned. I read VR and Padma. In Tatparya Nirnaya basic English Translation, it says he wanted Rudrapada and Sadehaswarga.

Does wanting Indrapad mean will to marry Shachi? Where is this narration that he wanted Parvati mentioned?

Which are other resources where his narration is narrated? Kindly provide.

Namami  
Dhanyavad.
