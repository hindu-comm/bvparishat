Dear Vidwans,

  

How many letters are there in the Maheshwar Sutras? 42 or 43. If the two ह's in the Maheshwar Sutras are taken to be one and the same then the count would be only 42. If however they are taken to be two different the count would be 43. But yes the grammarians need to tell the difference between the two ह's.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve
