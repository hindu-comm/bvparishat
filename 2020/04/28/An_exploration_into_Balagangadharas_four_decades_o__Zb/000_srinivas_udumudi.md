Dear members of BVP,

  

Indic Academy is organizing a webinar this Sunday that explores Prof. S.N. Balagangadhara'sfour decades of research. This is part of our "**Retrospective - Prospective**" initiative which aims at presenting an overall perspective into work of great thinkers, their sishyas and allied research centers.

  

We are excited about this event as Balu is going to talk about his four new books which present his latest groundbreaking research work. Most of you are surely aware of his ideas on Caste. Some of you may be aware of his explorations into Bhagavadgita, his analysis of what Varna means and what Varna Sankara means. Now learn about his explorations into Manu Dharmasastra, and Indian textual studies.

  

The formatof the event is to make it driven by questions from attendees. We provide downloadable book excerpts for those who register. The download includes four chapters from his new non-academic book --**What does it mean to be 'Indian'?**. The registrants are expected to submit questions before May 1st after reading the material. A panel of 4-5 scholars from Balu's research groups -- Dr. Jakob DeRoover, Dr. Sarah Claerhout, Dr. Sarika Rao, Dr. M.S. Chaitra -- will discuss these questions along with Prof. S.N. Balagangadhara himself.

  

This is a great opportunity for those of us who are already aware of Balu's research work to further explore their ideas and pathways. For those among us who actively comment on political and social issues related to India, deeper understanding of Balu's thought cannot be avoided for thedepth it provides to such analyses.
