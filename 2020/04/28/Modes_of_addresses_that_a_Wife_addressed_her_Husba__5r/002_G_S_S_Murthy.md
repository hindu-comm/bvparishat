It is a very interesting subject, I believe. In Kannada wife would address her husband, "houdaa" हौदा (yes??) or "enu andre" एनु अन्द्रे (what I mean is). I have reason to believe there would be equivalents in other South Indian languages. My mother addressed my father, अन्नाक (Tamil equivalent of "what I mean is").

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
