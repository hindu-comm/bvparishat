In a lighter vein:

In Karnataka, the husband would address the wife with "le" (reads like "lay").

In Tamil Nadu, as "Dee".

And the British took the two to form "Lady".

  

(Going by the first dialogue in the play *Shakuntalam*,

it could be that) she that causes delay inspired the label "lady".  

(Like *simha* from *hims*).

*siMho varNa-viparyayat.*

*  
*

*T*here could be more interesting etymologies.
