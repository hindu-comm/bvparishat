Hare Krishna.  
  
Respected vidvaj-janas,  
Pranams.  
  

This conversation is going good. Please let us go on churning like this.  
  
I am nothing each email here and organizing notes on this. This may  
end up having a list of different addresses with which husband wife  
used to call each other in different languages, cultures and castes. I  
feel, this is a very important aspect of our tradition which we need  
to save (otherwise after a generation or two only few modern address  
would be left). This can kill the whole diversity.  
  
In my Guru Maharaja's upcoming research, one of our subject is to  
enlist modes of addresses that were used across various traditional  
Indian cultures in various Indian languages (including main language  
sanskrit) in various castes. This is but a small topic in the list of  
broader Vedic Culture Book. Currently I am going through a primary  
essay on "Modes of Addresses in Vedic and Vaisnava Cultures" that he  
has kindly compiled based on his vast experience of Indian culture  
(for last 40 years) and his study of scriptures.  
  
I feel fortunate to be a part of this service as well as to be a part  
of BV Parishat for being co-operative in this mission.  

  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
