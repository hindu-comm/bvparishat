Hare Krishna.

  

Respected vidvaj-janas,

Pranams.

  

In traditional Indian culture wives used to address their husband by many addresses (not usually by his direct name). I have seen usages like Arya, Arya-putra, Swami, Prabhu, Natha, etc.

  

However, I also remember reading somewhere that these addresses would also depend on the varna and social status of the husband. For instance arya-putra could be used for ksatriyahusbands ( I faintly remember).

  

I would like to be directed towards authentic texts that have dealt with this issue and has a collection of addresses that a wife (of different varnas) can use for her husband (of different varnas). It may also contain occasionwise rules and many other rules that I may not be aware of.

  

Thankyou,

Hari Guru Vaisnava das,

damodara das
