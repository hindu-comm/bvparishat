Hare Krishna.

  

Respected vidvaj-janas,

Pranams.

  

Astottara-sata (108) and astottara-sahasra (1008) are widely seen as honorific prefixes used in written forms. However, in spoken forms, I have come across mainly astottara-sata usage and hardly ever astottara-sahasra (1008).  

  

What do you all think the reason for this observation? Is my observation correct? If yes then is there any reason behind this practice?

  

Thankyou,

Hari Guru Vaisnava das,

damodara das
