The Western practice is to address a person by his name - even if he is one's teacher.

The practice here is not to call him/address him by his name,

but refer to him respectfully as guru-ji (or its equivalent in other languages).

नाम गृह्णाति = नामग्राहम् आह्वयति ।

It is only when he has to refer to his *vidyA-vaMsha*  

that he speaks of his guru by his name,

(as accords also with *guruM prakAshayed dhImAn*).

  

Agama-s and Tantra-s prohibit *tvan'kAra* for the *guru*.
