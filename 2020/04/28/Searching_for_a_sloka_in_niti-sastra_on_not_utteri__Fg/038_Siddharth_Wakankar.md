Prof.Paturi,

  

Am much grateful to you for furnishing such a rich source.

  

In 1954 when I was just 7 year old,our cousin sister got married to Shri Haribhau Joshi,who had composed and himself sung his own poem in Kashmir. We youngsters recited shlokas in Sanskrit and Marathi wherein the word Hari was used. Haribhau worked with older generation of Jan Sangh volunteers and he breathed his last in 2010 December.

  

His famous patriotic poem is:  
एक देश में दो विधान,एक देश में दो प्रधानज्ञ

एक देश में दो निशान,नहीं चलेंगे,नही चलेंगे.

  

One [correction.it](http://correction.it) should be प्रधान.‌ The ज्ञ is not getting deleted.

  

Warm regards.

  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
