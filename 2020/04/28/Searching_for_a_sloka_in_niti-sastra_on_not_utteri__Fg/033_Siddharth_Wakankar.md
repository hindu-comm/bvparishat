This उखाणा tradition of taking each other's name in a verse form or a two line poetic way is fastly disappearing and a new way of taking names in modern parlance is getting currency,the fun still continues. Some new practices have also crept in esp.after the release of the film हम आपके है कौन.

  

Sometimes it is funny and at times not welcome by seniors.
