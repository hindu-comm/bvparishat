I did not know about this UkhaaNaa tradition until I read your post.

In Kannada region, there is a similar but different tradition. The name of the newly wed spouse is mentioned through instant creation of a riddle whose answer is the name of the spouse. ( Since I was born and brought up in the Karnataka borders of Andhra Pradesh, though my parent hailed from coastal Andhra , I did this in my marriage) . i found mention of this tradition being prevalent even now here :
