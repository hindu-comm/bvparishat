Didn't everyone have multiple names, like a nakshatra name that was kept secret from everyone except immediatefamily.

  

Kshatriya won't reveal their name when challenged by another. Some concept of - if they your name, they can weaken you through spell, or something. I am not very exact in this, but vidwans can throw some light on this aspect of not taking the name.

  

  
  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
