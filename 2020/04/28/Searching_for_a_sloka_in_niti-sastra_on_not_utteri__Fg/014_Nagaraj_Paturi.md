Talking of the the 'western' practice to address a person by his name - even if he is one's teacher, it appears that it is more an American practice than western. Recently when there was a discussion on this topic, even some European teachers expressed their discomfort with their American students in American universities addressing them by their name without even Mr., Mrs., Dr., Prof. etc. This seems to be part of Americans adopting 'informal' communication in an attempt to shed 'formal' habits of their European countries of origin.  

  

Indian students adopted English words such as ' Sir' (pronounced usually as 'saar' ), 'teacher', Master (mEshTaaru in Telugu, mEshTrE in Kannada, Moshai in Bengali ) Madam etc. to replace older addressings such as ayyaa, ayyar, ayyangaar, guruji, aachaaryaa, aachaaryaah, aachaarre, pantulugaaru etc.
