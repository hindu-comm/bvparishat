**आत्म-नाम**गुरोर् नाम

नामातिकृपणस्य च ।

श्रेयस्कामो न गृह्णीयात् तु  

ज्येष्ठापत्य-**कळत्र**योः

  

This verse seems to be summarising name mentioning related etiquette at one place.

  

Contexts for not mentioning the name in each of these cases seems to be different.

  

One's own name: Is avoided for humility and is replaced by expressions such as bhavadeeyah.

  

Guru's name : Again, out of respect, words like aachaaryapaadaah, gurudevah etc. are used.

  

For example, One could say, Raamaachaaryavaryaah vadanti. (not guru but respected)

  

Aachaaryapaadaah vadanti ( guru, so no name)

  

Wife : While mentioning to others:

  

Mama dharmapatnee, mama grihiNee etc. are used.

  

In other cases, I am not able to imagine.
