There are differences in addresses in India too among different communities. Sanskrit also originally does not have the 8th case. They are not found in most of the native spoken languages.These honorific addresses are a product of feudal hierarchies which have got filtered into modern Indian languages. They are also the remains of the colonial hierarchies in India. That these addresses are not found in America only shows that being a new world they have no honorific feudal addresses.

  

One should not go by how one addresses the other but by how one treats the other by status. Addresses are by the way only symbolic.
