I don't know the exact source of these two verses. the commentators quoted these in their commentaries while explaining the mangala shloka where an author takes his name. then the commentator quotes these two from smruti shastra. but they don't say from which smruti they have quoted. you can see these in the various commentaries of laghushabdendushekhra and paribhashendushekhra. where Nagesha writes his name in mangala shloka. but where this verse appears in siddhantakaumudi. I could not find it.
