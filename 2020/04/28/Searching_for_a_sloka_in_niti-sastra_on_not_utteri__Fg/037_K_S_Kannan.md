Another horrible aspect is that our film actors strive sometimes to imitate their Western counterparts

even in showing emotions!  

  

With the TV (and the cinema) shows (representing themes and issues relevant only to  

the most contemporary post-modernist-rank-feminist-critical-post-structural

-ultra-anti-genderists-whatnot theorists) invading even the poorest of rustic huts,  

much innocence is lost too. Deviance is the norm.  

  

With the right to artistic expression unbridled, they can make fun of any Hindu tradition,

any Hindu deity, any Hindu shastra, any Hindu custom, any Hindu idea!  

  

In the name of broad-mindedness, benign portrayal of any nonsensical Western custom can be  

given a full and free hand. "Antisecularists"! beware!  

  

All workings of Degeneration & Co. Unlimited.
