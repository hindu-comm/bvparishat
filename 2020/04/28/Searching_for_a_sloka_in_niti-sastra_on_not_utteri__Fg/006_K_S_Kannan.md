There is this practice of addressing/calling the eldest son by a different, additional, name.

All use only that name. The real name appears in official records only.

Even the *lagna-patrikA*/marriage invitation carries this more commonly used name

along with the "official" name (the former in brackets).

  

Grounds of etiquette very well set forth by Prof. Paturi.
