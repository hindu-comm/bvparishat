Thank you, Prof. Bhat, for the verse.

I remembered the verse partially, and did not have the time to search for the full text of the verse.

The narration of the personal experience of Prof. Deshpande is also revealing.

  

Obliteration of hierarchy and growing informality may have had  

some distinct advantages in the West, (or as more accurately pointed out - in the US).

But then, it cannot be held on that very account that observation of formalities undermines intimacy.

Utter formality and high intimacy could go hand in hand for millennia in our country quite smoothly.

  

Not unoften, the glamour of the West induces many to find merit in *whatever* the West does.

For, deep down in their subconscious, there is the facile equation, of

West = power (especially military/brutal),  

buttressed by technology and science, and matchless economic success  

(& *ergo)* = must be good and great  

(howsoever crafty and nasty the means may have been in its "great" exploits).

  

Rapacious looters they were, and unscrupulous plunderers Westerners will ever be,

but only getting the more and the more subtile and polished.

Propagandists *nonpareil* they will ever be,  

and can outwit, or outshout any argument against them.

One can only be amazed at how organized and sophisticated they are

\- in their crime against (only two things:) humanity and Nature.  

  

That is not to portray or assert any exaggeratedly rosy picture of the East,

which had its infirmities and parochialities at times.

  

There is much truth in these words of Matthew Arnold:

"The brooding East with awe beheld  

Her impious younger world.  

The Roman tempest swell'd and swell'd,  

And on her head was hurl'd.  

  

"The East bow'd low before the blast  

In patient, deep disdain;  

She let the legions thunder past,  

And plunged in thought again."  

  

\[A correction to Arnold (*add just one letter*) :  

he should have used *imperious* instead of *impious*.

Or in addition to, more sensibly.\]  

  

Or the words of figures like Will Durant,  

which I do not need to repeat now.

  

But then, things are bound to change once India proves to be an economic success

(for, *that* has unfortunately been made the sole criterion of assessment currently),

and revives her values and mores - of which signs have begun to surface.

  

And till then, we continue to see *nothing but* merits in, and *revel in* aping  

whatever the West does (and if the West flogs us, "*Oh how well they flog!*"); and worse,  

holding in scorn or viewing with indifference our own vast and deep heritage.  

  

The most simple and representative example for this right at present could be the consigning of  

the examinations of Indian classical music and dance (and of the various Sanskrit disciplines)  

to Boards that conducts high school exams ! Perversity unlimited:  

whereas the fields themselves demand a lifetime of study and dedication.

And a person who has studied a *shAstra* for a dozen years is not treated on par with  

even a poor second-class BA graduate!

  

The ramifications and implications of a *subconscious* enamour of the West  

(and today, it is patently and brazenly *conscious* *and even wilful*)  

*coupled with an ineluctable contempt* for all indigenous traditions  

can indeed unleash untold and unspeakable disaster. And it has.  

  

All this notwithstanding the norms of our own hallowed tradition which declared:

शत्रोरपि गुणा वाच्या

दोषा वाच्या गुरोरपि ।

and even asserted,

गुरोरप्यवलिप्तस्य

कार्याकार्यमजानतः।

उत्पथ-प्रतिपन्नस्य

कार्यं भवति शासनम् ॥

  

All the same must we ever remember:

निरक्षरे वीक्ष्य महाधनत्वं

विद्याऽनवद्या विदुषा न हेया ।

रत्नावतंसाः कुलटास्समीक्ष्य

किमार्य-नार्यः कुलटा भवन्ति ? ॥

(For our own times, replace the first word निरक्षरे  by असंस्कृते if you want;

for, the merely साक्षर can easily descend into राक्षस- as proven many times).

  

Didn't Bhatrhari bemoan long ago, reminding Bharatiya-s  

as to their key role/function in their own life (and for the good of the world) ?:

स्थाल्यां वैदूर्यमय्यां पचति तिल-खलं चान्दनैरिन्धनौघैः

सौवर्णैर्लाङ्गलाग्रैर्विलिखति वसुधामर्कतूलस्य हेतोः ।

छित्त्वा कर्पूरखण्डान्वृतिमिह कुरुते कोद्रवाणां समन्तात्

प्राप्येमां कर्मभूमिं भजति न मनुजो यस्तपो मन्द-भाग्यः !! ।।

  

Let not the golden words of Bhartrhari fall on deaf ears !  

His own verse offer seven analogies - to drive home the point inescapably,  

and hitting the nail on the head:

अरण्य-रुदितं कृतं, शव-शरीरमुद्वर्तितं,  

स्थलेऽब्जमवरोपितं, सुचिरमूषरे वर्षितम्, ।  

श्वपुच्छमवनामितं, बधिरकर्णजापः कृतः,  

धृतोऽन्ध-मुख-दर्पणो - यदबुधो जनः सेवितः ॥
