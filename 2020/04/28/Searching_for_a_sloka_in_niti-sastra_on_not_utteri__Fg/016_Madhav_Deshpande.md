  To add my personal experience in the US for the past 52 years, when I arrived as a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania, I began calling all my professors with "Sir." There were two entirely opposite responses. My American professors immediately told me to call them by their first names, while a professor who had migrated from Europe told me that I can call him by his first name after I finish my Ph.D. degree. When I joined the University of Michigan as a faculty member, I was the junior most member of the faculty. However, I was immediately told by the chair of the department to call all colleagues by their first names. The "Sir" is not particularly American, but undergraduate students typically address their professors by "Hello Professor," while the graduate students typically call their professors by their first names. In my lifelong experience in this culture, calling someone by his/her first name does not show any disrespect, but at some level it creates a more open conversation. It does not obliterate the hierarchies. You can call your Ph.D. advisor by his first name, and yet he remains your professor who is going to vote "yes" or "no" on your dissertation. Given the norms of the American culture, calling your colleagues by "Sir" or "Professor" appears strange at the very least. However, newcomers to the US environment find this very strange. I remember that during my student years at the University of Pennsylvania, Professor Paul Thieme was a visiting professor for a year. Initially, when everyone started calling him by his first name, he felt very offended, but gradually he got used to being called "Hello Paul."

  Three years ago, we started here in San Jose a group of Marathi senior families. Initially, everyonewas calling each other by the Marathi honorific use of "तुम्ही", which is like "आप" in Hindi. But then the group made it a rule that everyone should call each other by their first name, and not use any honorifics. What this did was to gradually create a greater sense of intimacy among friends, as if we were friends from our childhood.

  American culture and the English language as used in the US pretty much openly gets rid of hierarchical usages across the board. The president is officially addressed simply as "Mr. President," and not as "His Highness," as it may perhaps be done in the UK. The American norms need not be promoted in India, but need not be misunderstood. They are not a display of American disrespect toward each other.
