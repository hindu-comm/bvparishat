Hare Krishna.

  

Respected vidvaj-janas,

Pranams.

  

According to niti-sastra one should also not utter one’s own name, one’s wife’s name. There is a sloka to this effect that I am not able to recall.

  

If someone can direct me to the same, it will be helpful.

  

Thankyou,

Hari Guru Vaisnava das,

damodara das
