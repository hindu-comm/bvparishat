Hare Krishna.  
  
Respected Kannan ji,  
Pranams.  
  
Thankyou for this reference sloka. May I know the original source of this sloka.  
  
I searched and found it to be from some book called Karmalocana while  
is quoted in Sabda-kalpadruma. However, I would like to know the  
original source of it.  
  
Also similar verses from other sources are welcome.  

  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
