My grandparents (father's side) used the eldest son protocol.

My father was the eldest son. I lived with my grandparents in

our village in Puri during in my early years. My mother would be

with me but father would be in detention or underground for

various political reasons. I would miss my father.

Whenever my grandmother called out my father's name I  

would look around to check. It took me a while to figure

out the internal calling protocol. I had assumed the practice

as a show of affection to my father till I saw the stanza above.
