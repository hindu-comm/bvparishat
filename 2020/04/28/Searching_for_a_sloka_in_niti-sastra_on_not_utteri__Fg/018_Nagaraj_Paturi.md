Dear Prof Deshpande,

  

Was there any statement anywhere in my post that indicated any 'misunderstanding' or any 'judgement' about the American culture of calling teachers by their first names?

  

Thanks for providing an example to my point that European teachers do not feel comfortable with their being called by first name in US (in the beginning before getting acculturation of the new environment, yes, but nevertheless)

  

Your example of Marathi community meet has an implicit message that it is calling by first names thatcreated a greater sense of intimacy among friends, as if we were friends from our childhood. My experience is that a few hours of living together creates such an intimacy here too in India, probably all over the world, depending on the interpersonal apprroach of the members irrespective of the addressing styles.

  

Thanks for confirming that calling by first name does not obliterate the hierarchy.

  

We are trying to understand the culture expressed in a verse, in terms of etiquette and the worldview behind that etiquette.

  

As a matter of course, American culture was discussed using neutral descriptive terms.
