Answer: अपराह्णे तीव्रम् उष्णम् अन्वभावि = अपराह्णे तीव्रमुष्णमन्वभावि ।

–अथवा–  
अपराह्णे तीव्रः उष्णः अन्वभावि = अपराह्णे तीव्र उष्णोऽन्वभावि ।

here anvabhAvi, as I understand means : I experienced

  

However, here

र्गो यदाह भगवानन्वभावि तथैव तत्

meaning of anvabhAviis different:

*Whatever the worshipful Garga utteredhas beenfullyverified.*

which states anvabhAvimeans: "has been verified".

  

is the meaning of anvabhAvi verification or experiencing?

I could not understand. Please help.

  

does abhAvi means - it existed?

then if anu upasarga comes before how does it get changed to the new meaning?

  

I am not making the connection to the meaning. I am mainly worried about meaning.

in other words,anvabhAvidoes not seem to indicate experience. right?

I am confused for sure!!
