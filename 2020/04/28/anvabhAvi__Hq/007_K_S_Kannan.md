1\. *aham anubhavAmi*

2\. *mayA anubhUyate*

  

3\. *aham anvabhUvam*

4\. *mayA anvabhAvi*

  

1 is *laT* of Active Voice.

2.................Passive............

3....*lun'* in Active voice.

4................Passive........

  

Further, the root of the problem is in taking *aham* as the subject.

*ahaM-buddhi-bodhya*  

is a compound word.
