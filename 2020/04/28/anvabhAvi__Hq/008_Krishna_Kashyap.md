Thanks a lot for the clarification Sri H.N Bhat and Sri V. Subramanian.

When Sri Subramanian wrote initially, I was confused since the Bhagavatam verse seemed to indicate a slightly different meaning of "verification" instead of "experienced by me".

hence I had written at that time:

Now it is clear that it is passive and meaning is : "The Lord was experienced" makes sense in the context of the verse I cited.

as you have indicated.

Namaskar and thanks.

Incidentally, my Sanskrit is not good. I could not follow the grammar in depth cited by Sri V.Subramanian. I have studied till Sahitya level a long time back. Further, even thoughI studied vyakarana: siddhanta kaumudi. However, I dontremember a major portion of what I have read!

For now, English meaning makes sense to me. My friends cited a different English meaning to the same verse on a private message and I was confused. Hence I had raised that question.
