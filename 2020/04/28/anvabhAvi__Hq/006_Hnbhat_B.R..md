Mr.V.Subrahmanyam had in his first reply had given the link to the detailed derivation of the form अन्वभावि in Sanskrit and in short it is**लुँङ्, कर्मणि प्रयोग:, प्रथम-पुरुषः, एकवचनम्**। in english past passive voice form of the verb अनु+भू present tense अनुभूयते in passive voice in present tense. This form if of aurist past called लुङ् in Sanskrit. Translation is simple "the Lord was experienced" in the context.
