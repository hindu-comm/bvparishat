Hari Om!

Vedic Rudra is a roaring storm God.

रुद्रो रौतीति वा, रोदयतेर्वा, रोरूयमाणो द्रवतीति वा।

Father of Maruts who are called रुद्रियाः.

He is the best amongst the physicians भिषजां भिषक्तम, जलाषभेषज

In the Vajasaneyi Samhita, he is variously addressed as कपर्दिन्, ईशान, नीलग्रीव, कृत्तिवासस्, उग्र, त्र्यम्बक महादेव।

In the RV, seer Grtsamada asks, क्व ते रुद्र मृड्याकुर्हस्तः यः जलाषभेषजः। मृड later became synonymous to Siva

Puranic Siva has these names as almost synonyms.

This might have started the comparison and then identification of the Vedic Rudra and Siva from the Puranic trinity
