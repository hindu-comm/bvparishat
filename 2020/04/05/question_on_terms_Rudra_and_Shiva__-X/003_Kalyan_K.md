Sri Krishnaji  

  
\>7) Is the term shiva a later term rarely mentioned in the Vedas?  
  

This is my understanding. Shiva is rarely mentioned in vedas and when mentioned, Shiva in vedas is mostly used to mean "auspicious" or "auspicious one". (There might be a couple of exceptions). An important usage in this sense occurs in the Mandukya upanishad.
