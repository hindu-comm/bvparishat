While 'Rudra' is mostly used in the Veda (samhita), 'Shiva' is also used, perhaps sparingly. One example is the popular Srirudra prashna, Krishna Yajur Veda Samhita, where the name 'namaH shivaaya' occurs. It is said that this name is placed in the very centre of the KYV samhita.

  

There are a few Upanishads, where both the names appear.

  

<https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_upanishhat/kaalaagni.html?lang=sa>
Kalagni Rudropanishad For this there is a Deepika by Narayanasrama of the 13th Century CE

  

<https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_upanishhat/brihajjabala.html?lang=sa>
Brihajjabala Upanishad

  

<https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_upanishhat/bhasma.html?lang=sa> 
Bhasma Jabala Upanishad

  

The latter two are named in the Shiva/Linga Purana in connection with Bhasma Tripundra dharana

  

All the above are also commented upon by Upanishad Brahma Yogin, an Advaitin of the 17th Century, perhaps.  

  

<https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_upanishhat/kaivalya.html?lang=sa> 
Kaivalyopanishat contains Shiva name. And refers to Sri Rudram as one to be chanted by Sannyasins.  

  

<https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_upanishhat/atharvashira.html?lang=sa>
Atharva shira upanishat has Rudra name several times.

  

<https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_upanishhat/atharvashikha.html?lang=sa>
Atharva Shikha Upanishad has both Rudra and Shiva names. These two Upanishads have been commented upon in 13th Century. Ramanuja has referred to the latter Upanishad in his Vedartha Sangraha.

The Kaivalyopanishad uses the Trimurtis' names:स ब्रह्मा स शिवः सेन्द्रः सोऽक्षरः परमः स्वराट् । स एव विष्णुः स प्राणः स कालोऽग्निः स चन्द्रमाः ॥ ८॥

  

``` Atharva Shikha Upanishad   ब्रह्मविष्णुरुद्रेन्द्रास्ते सम्प्रसूयन्ते This has all the trimurtis' names. Just as in Narayana Suktam.   
```

  

Shankaracharya has cited the first part of this line/verse in the Vishnu Sahasra NamaBhashyam and said there - अभेदोपदेशात् (The Upanishad teaches the non-difference of the deities mentioned therein).
This Upanishad also has the names Nilakantha, Parameshwara...

This is an arthavAda. Shankaracharya has cited this mantra in the Brahma Surya Bhasya.

Please see the several Upanishad references given above.

Some hold that view but it is not substantiated by facts.
