Namaste  
  
The confusion on ' interchangeable usage of Shiva and Rudra' needs clarification here.  
  
1. The two terms are NOT interchangeable, substitutable ! Om Namah SIVAYA is not same as ' Om Namo Bhagavate RUDRAAYA'.  
  
2. Popular misinformed usage is dangerously justified, using the ' pooling of several names of Shiva' used in AShottara and Sahasranaama worship models.  
  
3. Dr.Yadu has made this point clear in some earlier posting. This confusion is similar to the misunderstood equivalence of ' Ganesha = vinayaka'.  
  
The understanding of Vedic Devataa's under the frame of ' polytheism'- pluralism -Religion worship model is at the root of such errors. The effect of 'mantra-medicine' delivers its result, irrespective of whether one consumes it knowingly or unknowingly.
