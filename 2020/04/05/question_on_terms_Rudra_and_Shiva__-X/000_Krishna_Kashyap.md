I have several questions on these two terms "Rudra" and"Shiva".

  

1\. In Vedas which of these terms Rudra and Shiva are mentioned often.

how are these two terms related?

  

2\. I heard that regarding creation, sustenance, and destruction, in Vedas fundamentally Rudra term to represent destruction instead of shiva. Is that true? even though brahmavishnu maheshvaraare generally used to mention trimurtis with these three distinct functions.

  

3\) There is this section of Vedas which talks about an episode of agni / rudra which cries and silver comes out etc. what is the significance of this episode? here is Agni same as rudra?

  

4\) in these Brahmanas, does the term shiva come up? or only Rudra is used for the function of destruction?

  

5\) I know svetasvatara uses rudra to mean the ultimate.

except svetasvetara, is rudra mentioned in other Upanishads?

what about term shiva?

I am trying to understand the relation between these two termsin Vedas.

  

6\) Is term shiva mentioned in the satarudriya of yajurveda?

it seems:

The Śatarudriya (शतरुद्रिय), constituting the sixty-six subdivisions of chapter 16 of the Vājasaneyi-saṃhitā, is a litany accompanying no less than 425 oblations and addressed to the hundred forms and powers of the god Rudra.  

  

7\) Is the term shiva a later term rarely mentioned in the Vedas?
