In the above link the following is stated:

  

``` Textual support for this is adequate.

(1) In SriVishnu Puranam at that point the following names are given re Yogamaya:Arya,Durga,Vedagarbha, Ambika,Bhadra,Bhadrakali Kshemada,Bhagyada.

(2) In Srimad Bhagavatam the following names are given:Durga,Bhadrakali,Vijaya,Vaishnavi,Kumuda,Chandika, Krshnaa,Madhavi,Kanyaka,Maaya,Narayani,Iisaani,Sarada, Ambika.

It can be seen that the characteristic names of Siva's wife are totally absent. ```

``` In the Amarakosha, for the name Parvati, these are the names given: http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/scl/amarakosha/frame.html ```

[SB 10.53.39](http://www.vedabase.com/en/sb/10/53/39) Bound by their swelling love, the city’s residents spoke in this way. Then the bride, protected by guards, left the inner palace to visit the temple of**Ambikā**.  

  

The Bhagavatam itself is giving the name Ambika to Shiva's consort, when Rukmini visited the temple before here wedding.

  

``` The names Durga, Ambika, Aaryaa, Kaali (Bhadrakaali), Chandikaa, Ishvari (Ishaani),  Sarvamangala (Bhadra) are common to both Parvati and the names of the 'sister of Krishna' given in the above post.  Almost all the names in the two groups mentioned in the above post are in the Lalita Sahasra Nama.

``` Gowri is Vishnu's sister - Silappadhikaram  http://www.tamilvu.org/ta/library-l3100-html-l3100ind-132364

The Tamil Classic 'Silappadhikaram', admitted to be of 5 CE, has a reference to the idea that Gowri, Shiva's consort, is Vishnu's sister: 2. வேட்டுவ வரி ```
