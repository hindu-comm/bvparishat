Even among Vaishnavas, not all beliefs are shared the same way. There are drastic differences across various schools of Vaishnavism when it comes to the nature of Vishnu, other deities, their status, etc.

  

This verse of the Bhagavatam says this female is Vishnu's sister:

  

sā tad-dhastāt samutpatya

sadyo devy ambaraṁ gatā

adṛśyatānujā viṣṇoḥ

sāyudhāṣṭa-mahābhujā

//Thanks for the reference to Silapathikaram. It looks like the concept of Vishnu and Parvati being siblings, has origins in Tamil nadu. The idea has also been interpolated into the Mahabharata and Harivamsa, but has been removed by the critical editors at BORI. The concept thus seems to be absent in any Vaishnava scriptures.//

  

We can't conclude that the 'siblings' concept originated in Tamil Nadu since we do not know on what sources the author of the Silappadhikaram relied. Here are some opinions about the work and its close connection with Sanskrit epics:<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silappatikaram#Sanskrit_epics>

  

//The Tamil epic calls portions of it as*vāla caritai nāṭaṅkaḷ*, which mirrors the phrase*balacarita nataka*– dramas about the story of the child \[Krishna\]" – in the more ancient Sanskrit*kavyas*.^([\[51\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silappatikaram#cite_note-HawleyWulff1982a-51)[\[note 1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silappatikaram#cite_note-53))According to the Indologist Friedhelm Hardy, this canto and others in the Tamil epic reflect a culture where "Dravidian, Tamil, Sanskrit, Brahmin, Buddhist, Jain and many other influences" had already fused into a composite whole in the South Indian social consciousness.^([\[53\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silappatikaram#cite_note-Hardy1983p118-54)// //)The major festivals described in the epic are pan-Indian and these festivals are also found in ancient Sanskrit literature.^([\[59\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silappatikaram#cite_note-FOOTNOTEV_R_Ramachandra_Dikshitar193947%E2%80%9353-60)//)

  

^(Hence, we can never be sure that the siblings idea is an interpolation in Mahabharata and Harivamsha. Also the BORI critical editors removing it is also not a conclusive proof of the idea being an)

^(interpolation. There are scholars who do not)consider the BORI edition to be sacrosanct. Such opinions have been expressed in this very forum. Since such a critical edition is also 'paurusheya',

the possible defects attached to it like 'bhramaand pramaada' cannot be ruled out.

  

Its absence in Vaishnava scriptures also does not prove anything. For, what is not to one's liking is rejected in such scriptures composed by those belonging to such schools.
