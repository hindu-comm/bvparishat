Namaste Vidvat Parishad.

  

A quick clarification request.

  

Does the term "Narayani" represent

the Goddess "Laksmi" as in SriSukta or

the Goddess "Durga" as in Devi Saptashati, or

both depending on the context, as the shakti is the root of Saraswati, Kali, and Lakshmi?

  

I appreciate your perspectives.

  

Best regards,

Komer
