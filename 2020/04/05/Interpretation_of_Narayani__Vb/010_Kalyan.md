Thanks for the reference to Silapathikaram. It looks like the concept of Vishnu and Parvati being siblings, has origins in Tamil nadu. The idea has also been interpolated into the Mahabharata and Harivamsa, but has been removed by the critical editors at BORI. The concept thus seems to be absent in any Vaishnava scriptures.
