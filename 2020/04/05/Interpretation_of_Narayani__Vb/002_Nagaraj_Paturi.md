Dear Sri Komer-ji,

  

Narayani is used in the sense of Devi who has the three forms Maha Kali , Maha lakshmi, Maha Saraswati.

  

We have expressions such as Narayana Sahodari, Vashnavietc. too in this sense.

  

*Ratnatraya Pariksha and its commentary :*  
In this extremely short work containing only very few verses, which Sri Appayya Dikshita calls as the three gems or*ratna traya*, Sri Dikshita proves on the basis of the*pramanas*of the*Puranas*, that Siva is really the*Parabrahma,*that it is the*Sivasakti*in the female form that is known as*Parvati*, and ***that it is the same sakti which is known as Narayana in the male form***, and that on account of these,*Hari, Hara*and*Ambika*, all the three have*Brahmatva*, and that it is not necessary to fight among ourselves as to who is greater and who is smaller, since all the three are derived only from the same eternal source
