Dhanyavad, all for sharing your perspectiveson my question.

Within no time, I am exposed to multiple relevant scriptures. Most importantly, the conversation helped me immensely in understanding my question.

  

When I started, it was a casualquery. Now I conclude my question is irrelevant.

  

I will continuemediationson Lalita Sahasranama,Sri Sukta,Vishnu Sahasranama, and the sweet Telugu Bhagavatam (Potanaamatya's exposition).

I appreciate the depth and breadth of knowledge and wisdom evident in the community.I will actively stay tuned.

  

Best regards,

Komer
