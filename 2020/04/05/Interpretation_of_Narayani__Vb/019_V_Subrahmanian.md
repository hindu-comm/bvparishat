The name Padmanabha-sahodari (280) occurs in the Lalita Sahasra Nama:

The commentary 'Saubhagya-bhaskari' of Sri Bhaskara Raya says:

  

First, alluding to Sri Appayya Dikshitar's 'Ratna Traya Pariksha' -

  

'Padmanabha, Vishnu's sister, having born in the same womb. One Brahman alone attained two forms: Dharma = attributes and Dharmi = the substantive. The Dharma-twin is two fold: male and female: Male is Vishnu, the creator of the entire universe, and female is the consort of Paramashiva. All these three, the two dharmas and the Dharmi, together is one impartite Brahman. This 'secret' of Shaiva doctrine is popular in Kurma Purana etc. This is elaborately established in that text by Sri Appayya Dikshitar.

With this idea alone, in the Brahma Purana, in the Purushottama kshetra Mahatmyam -

She who was born as Subhadra in an earlier life to Menaa (consort of Himavaan), is born as the sister of Krishna in the womb of Devaki.

  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subhadra>   The Yoga Maya - Subhadra identity is stated here:

  

//**Subhadra**([IAST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAST "IAST"): Subhadrā) is a character in the*[Mahabharata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata "Mahabharata")*which Hindu legend ascribes to[Vyasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vyasa "Vyasa"). She is worshiped as an incarnation of[Goddess Yogmaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogmaya_Temple "Yogmaya Temple"). In the epic, she is the sister of[Krishna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna "Krishna")and[Balarama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balarama "Balarama"), wife of[Arjuna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjuna "Arjuna")and mother of[Abhimanyu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhimanyu "Abhimanyu")and grandmother of[Parikshit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parikshit "Parikshit"). She is the daughter of[Vasudeva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasudeva "Vasudeva")and[Devaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devaki "Devaki"). //

  

The name 'NaaraayaNI' occurs in the Lalita Sahasra Nama as 298th. The above commentary says:

  

First giving the etymology for 'narayana' from Manu smriti and by a grammar rule that it is either Shiva or Vishnu. and the one connected to narayana is narayani.

And goes on to give the Mahabharata etymology for the name 'narayana':

  

![image.png](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/fa9d94966bd4/image.png?part=0.6&view=1)  

and says 'this Narayana's i.e. Paramashiva'sconsort is Narayani. \[earlier the commentator had said the etymology after Manusmriti by a grammar rule can be either Vishnu or Shiva\]. Considering the Turiya (Para Brahman) Narayana is Sripati, consort of Lakshmi, he also is Parvatipati, consort of Parvati, according to Kashikhanda (perhaps this is from the Skanda Puranam).

  

It ('Narayani) could mean non-difference with Lakshmi too (that is, Parvati and Lakshmi both could be Narayani). He cites a grammar rule applicable to masculine, that it is not by default that man-wife relation alone is meant. There is seen an example of father-daughter relationship too (for this grammar rule). By this, here, by this rule, there is the brother-sister relationship too, which means the sister of Narayana = Narayani. One may refer to this post of mine<https://www.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2011-March/026639.html>
for more details about a name of Shiva that the commentator cites below:नारायणीसहचराय \*नम: शिवाय.

The commentary continues: Narayani can also be the non-difference between Narayana and Gowri, and goes on to cite the Kurmapurana:

  

Gunishiva says:

  

![image.png](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/fa9d94966bd4/image.png?part=0.8&view=1)  

'I, the Lord, Parameshwara, am appearing manifold as Narayana and Gowri, the Jaganmaataa, sanaatani, My true nature is not known to the gods and the maharshis. Know Me to be One, the Universal Self, Bhavani and Vishnu.'

  

The commentary on the name Narayani concludes with this citation from Devi Bhagavatam:

![image.png](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/fa9d94966bd4/image.png?part=0.9&view=1)  

The meaning of the above is not clear to me. Also, a disclaimer: I do not know the implications of the vyakarana rules cited by the commentary above.

If the term 'Narayani', which is the primary question of this thread, is explained in other scriptural texts like the Vaishnava Pancharatra, etc. those may be provided here for a more informed understanding. While searching for some quotes in the above commentary, I realized that the commentary is available in non-pdf form too on the internet. I have copied the above from a pdf with me.
