In the Lakshminarayana samhita, a text brought to my notice by a Madhva scholar friend, is a stuti addressed to Lakshmi-Lalita:  

  

<https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_devii/mahAlakshmIlalitAstotra.html?lang=sa>

  

A sample from the above stotram:

  

``` सर्वशक्त्यै सर्वधात्र्यै महालक्ष्म्यै नमो नमः । 
```

या ससर्ज विराजं च ततोऽजं विष्णुमीश्वरम् ॥ १४ ॥ She is the one who created the Virat and then Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.

  

*इदानीं दृश्यसे ब्राह्मी नारायणी प्रियशङ्करी ।*  

नमस्तस्यै महालक्ष्म्यै गजमुख्यै नमो नमः ॥ १३ ॥

  

She is the one who is Braahmi (Saraswati),Narayani(Lakshmi) and Priyashankari (Parvati).

  

This info, not the actual verses, shared by a friend: In Devi Bhagwatham, the godess Ishwari/Narayaniis the ultimate god. When Narayana opened his eyes at the beginning of kalpa, he beheld the godess. Not knowing who or what her intention was, Narayana started chanting mantras. Later the godess assured him that he would carry out his duties as per her will.

  

Durga Saptashati there is aNarayaniStuti.

  

In Srimad Bhagavatam the following names are

``` given:Durga,Bhadrakali,Vijaya,Vaishnavi,Kumuda,Chandika, Krshnaa,Madhavi,Kanyaka,Maaya,Narayani,Iisaani,Sarada,Ambika.
```

``` ```

``` This is a popular shloka that Smarta-s chant, invoking Gauri: sarva mangaLa mAngaLyE shivE………nArAyaNinamOstu tE ```

``` ```

``` So, when nArAyaNa takes birth, His sahOdari (sivAni) also takes birth elsewhere to prove their sahOdaratva. And hence, She is termed asnArAyaNi. And siva is called *nArAyaNisahacharaH*. ```

``` Also,in “lalitOpAkhyAna”, at the time of the celestial marriage of Kameshwara & Kameshwari, kanyAdAna was performed by Vishnu, being Her sahOdara and She was addressed as “nArAyaNi”.

The above are some of the many references in the Puranic, etc. literature to the name Narayani.
