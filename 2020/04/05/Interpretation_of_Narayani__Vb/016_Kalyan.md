I dont deny that some non-vaishnavas consider Vishnu and Parvati to be siblings. However, I do not know if this idea is accepted by Vaishnavas. (If they are siblings, who are their parents? Vishnu atleast has no parents, as per Vaishnavism). From what I know, this idea is foreign to Vaishnava scriptures. It is well-known that vaishnavas dont accept all puranas in total. They accept only what they consider to be sattvik portions.

  

Also, when you quote a verse from a scripture, please try to give information about its location in any of the existing editions. This is to prevent the possibility of unknown quotations.

  

PS: I dont know how many serious scholars of history think that all the extant puranas were written by one single person called veda vyAsa. While there is nothing wrong with being traditionally inclined, a historical approach is better suited for tracing the origin of ideas.
