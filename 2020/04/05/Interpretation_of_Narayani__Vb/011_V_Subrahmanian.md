In the skandapurāṇa Veda Vyāsa teaches this in a dialogue between vasiṣṭha and brahmā:

आत्मशक्त्या ससर्जाथ कन्यात्रयमनिन्दितम्

कन्यान्तु रुद्रो जग्राह कृष्णां सर्वाङ्गसुन्दरीम्

Shiva’s Māyāshakti gave birth to three damsels of whom Rudra took for himself the black one.

सा च विष्णुश्चैकभागो भगिनी सा ततो हरेः

She is one part of Vishnu, his sister.

  

\[The above have been cited in very great detail in the book ‘Vedantanāmaratna sahasram’ authored by Sri Paramashivendra Saraswati, the guru of Sri Sadashivendra Saraswati. This book is a compilation of 1000 names from the shruti. In support of those names, as far as possible, the author has cited references from Itihasa and puranas. That list contains names such as Vishnu, Vasudeva and Narayana, and shown as names of Brahman, with references from shruti/smrti\]
