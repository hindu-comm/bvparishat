Dear friends,

  

Am reading the paper“Knowledge Representation in Sanskrit and Artificial Intelligence” published in 1985 in the journal, AI Magazine Volume 6 Number 1. It was authored by Rick Briggs of the Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science of the NASA Ames Research Center.

  

The paper refers to Nagesha's work mentioned. Are there any translations available of this work?

  

Thanks and regards
