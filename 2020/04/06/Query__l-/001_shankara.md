Acharya ji,

  

Lakshmanarekaha is mentioned in Bhusundi Ramayana and Ramcharitmanas, Lankakand.

  

Bhusundi Ramayana Dakshinakhanda ch. 154, verse 26. Lakshmana draws a kundali on the ground, with the end of his bow.

  

किंत्वात्मघनुषः कोट्या कुण्डलीकृतमेतकम् ।  

देशं मा देवि लङ्घिष्ठाः कृतोऽयं ते मया पणः ॥

In Ram Charit Manas Lanka Kand 35.1, Mandodari reminds Ravana that he could not even cross a small line drawn by Rama's younger brother Lakshmana.

  

कंत समुझि मन तजहु कुमतिही। सोह न समर तुम्हहि रघुपतिही।।  
रामानुज लघु रेख खचाई। सोउ नहिं नाघेहु असि मनुसाई।। 35.1  

  

regards  
shankara

There is no reference to LakSmaNarekhA drawn by LakSmaNa in VAlmIkirAyaNa and TulasI's RAmacaritamAnasa. Where does the reference occur then?
