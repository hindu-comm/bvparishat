<https://youtu.be/bzhjM9Gn0UU>  The video has English subtitles.  

  

"Corona Yuddham", a song written by Ramnath Bhagavath on the war between humanity and Corona virus. The song gives listeners, a quick glimpse of the following:  
1) The virus,  
2) Global lock down  
3) Economic crisis  
4) Social distancing and prevention  
5) Extolling front line warriors.  
The song ends with instilling hope in us to destroy the virus  

  

A lovely composition, in Tamil, set to the popular tune of 'mudaa karaatta modakam' (sung by MS Amma) bringing out all the aspects in beautiful verses. The song has all the traits of a poem, praasa, and what not. And the rendering is also very appealing with the raaga and the sangati-s flowing with ease. My salutations to all those involved in this.
