Respected Scholars!  
Mahim Bhatt refutes Lakshna as a Shabdshakti in his Magnum opus VyaktiVivek, is there any other text or school which doesn't accept Lakshana as Shabdshakti other than Mimamsakas (Bhatta Lollat & Mukul Bhatt)?

Apart from that, kindly provide text/ detail pertains to dedicated work on Lakshana.

Thank you.  
Sincerely  
Jayesh
