Dear Members,

  

Hope you're all safe in these trying times.

  

Could you please respond to a query made by one of my seniorcolleagues, who I've copied in.

  

''It is mentioned in one of the Mahapuranas that Ganga (the presiding deity of the holy river Ganga) goes to the heaven every month, and that she leaves for the heaven in the middle of the Shukla-paksha (bright fortnight) and that she returns to the Earth in the middle of the Krishna-paksha (Dark-fortnight). I need the reference to this topic, giving the name of the Mahapurana, the Canto number, the Chapter number and the verse(s) number. If the descriptive details can be obtained, It will help me even more.''

  

  

With regards,

Niranjan
