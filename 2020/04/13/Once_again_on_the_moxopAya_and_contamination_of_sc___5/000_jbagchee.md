Dear friends,



I am forwarding a message from RISA-LIST on Srinivasa Ayya Srinivasan’s tendentious analysis of the Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa. The text is below. Srinivasan’s*Studies in the Rāma Story*is a problematic attempt to second-guess and “improve” on the lower critical work of the Baroda critical edition by applying higher critical criteria of “what makes sense,” i.e., randomly emending the text to conform to preconceived notions of what Srinivasan thinks it*should*have transmitted. One would expect a Professor of Indology to apply more stringent criteria for recommendations, but the explanation is simple: Walter Slaje’s Habilitationsschrift on the Moksopaya, which I already critiqued here, is indebted to Srinivasan’s methods and ideas.



In addition, I add this link:<https://www.academia.edu/42725519/Paul_Hacker_Nazi_Dossier>

Indologists on RISA-LIST are protesting my describing Paul Hacker as a“Nazi Indologist,” even though this is the literal truth. When Indologistspractice censorship of others and cover up the historical record, how can their scholarship be relied on?

Of the two volumes, the second consists only of notes and indices; moreover, the treatment of different works indicated in the subtitle is inconsistent and peters out. Srinivasan’s Habilitationsschrift underperforms his dissertation—likewise, not without problems, especially in its formulation of “Kontaminationskritik.” But here Srinivasan makes no attempt to cover his higher critical speculations about an original text by consideration of manuscript evidence, however rudimentary and second-hand. The conclusions Srinivasan attains (about an “original,” about “growths,” about the “course of transmission,” about “narrative coherence,” etc.) are as unscientific and tendentious as anything in Mahābhārata studies (see*The Nay Science*and*Philology and Criticism*; the results of two centuries of attempts to reconstruct an “original” Gītā are summarized in this table:<https://www.academia.edu/30431442/Paradigm_Lost>).



It is unfortunate that Srinivasan chose to continue the “text-historical method” of his mentor, Nazi Indologist Paul Hacker (discussed on p. 94, n. 35,<https://www.academia.edu/36999444/Philology_and_Criticism>). His work provides further support that this method is unscientific and driven by Protestant anti-traditional and anti-clerical prejudices (in Srinivasan’s case, also a desire to acculturate to the dominant paradigm of German Indology). If anyone feels Srinivasan’s work is immune to the charge of circularity and subjectivism, please feel free to respond.Vishwa and I are currently studying “critical” editions based on Srinivasan’s problematic and untenable method of “Kontaminationskritik.” This work will form an appendix to the second edition of*Philology and Criticism*.
