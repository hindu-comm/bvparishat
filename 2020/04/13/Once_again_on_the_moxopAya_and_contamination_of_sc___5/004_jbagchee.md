The files for Paul Thieme and Paul Hacker have now been split.

The Paul Thieme materials belonged together with materials for the Indische Legion, which I received later.

I have uploaded them here: <https://www.academia.edu/42749714/Paul_Thieme>

For Paul Thieme we were able to locate a index card from the Reichsforschungsrat (RFR) and one from the Reichserziehungsministerium (REM).

It is important to note that an NSDAP membership card could not be located.

A British intelligence report dated 12.1.1945 in the National Archive of India notes that he was a “strong anti-Nazi.”

(This should answer questions I received off-list about different rumors concerning Paul Thieme.)

  

Regarding Thieme’s military service (please note the Wehrmacht is not the same as the party, even if there was some overlap):

From Wikipedia:

Thieme was appointed professor of Indo-Germanic at Halle in 1941, but was conscripted for the Russian campaign. In the battalion, he became friends with the Indo-Iranist Karl Hoffmann. Thieme was saved from the fate of the many soldiers who died in Russia because he was deputed to the Indische Legion in 1942 as a translator for Hindustani \[according to my records, also Karl Hoffmann\].

  

Summarizing, military service after 1941; Indian Legion after 1942 (this popular term is not quite accurate, but I won’t get into details); we have records for him as a translator with the Indian Legion from 1943 to the end of the War. Where Thieme was between 1941–1942 can only be gleaned from military records.

The Archive of the Polish National Institute for Remembrance contains an entry for a Paul Thieme in the Waffen-SS who is recorded among the 8500 SS-Officers at the Concentration Camp Auschwitz-Birkenau. I am as yet unable to ascertain if this is the same person (no place or date of birth or time period in Auschwitz is mentioned).

We know Paul Thieme was in the Waffen-SS (see uploaded photos); like all national legions of the German Army, control of the Indian Legion was transferred to the Waffen-SS in 8.8.1944, and was now known as the Indische Freiwilligen Legion der Waffen-SS.

It is unlikely the two Thiemes are the same, since we can track the movements of the Indian Legion quite accurately (mainly Western and Southern fronts), but note that per Wikipedia Paul Thieme was on the Russian (Polish?) front between 1941 and 1942.

The Auschwitz reference may date from this period. (Perhaps some of Thieme’s students are better informed about his movements in the war years than I.)

I remain doubtful, however, that this is the same Thieme because this would imply Thieme was a member of the Waffen-SS prior to 1944.

A lot of these files have been destroyed—sometimes deliberately, sometimes they go missing after the war, sometimes university archives are uncooperative (most notably, PersakteThiemeUAT 602 Nr. 1196 Uni Tübingen is missing)—so I beg your patience.

I maintain thousands of files on Indologists, living or dead, and it requires painstaking work to provide definitive answers.
