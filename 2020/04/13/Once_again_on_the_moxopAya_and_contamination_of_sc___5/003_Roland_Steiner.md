\> Indologists on RISA-LIST are protesting my describing Paul Hacker as a “Nazi  
\> Indologist,” even though this is the literal truth. When  
\> Indologists practice censorship of others and cover up the historical  
\> record, how can their scholarship be relied on?  
  

Dr Bagchee knows better that there can be no question of censorship at  
all since there is currently a discussion on this topic on the RISA  
list.  
  
What do we mean by a "Nazi Indologist"? I think of an Indologist who  
is convinced of the Nazi ideology and whose Indological work is guided  
or at least influenced by this conviction. What is certain is that  
Hacker (born in 1913) was not yet an Indologist at that time (1937).  
In 1940 he earned his PhD in Slavistics. His first Indological paper  
appeared to the best of my knowledge in 1947. And as for his  
ideological views in the 1940s, I do not know them. The photograph of  
a membership card does not replace historical research.  
  
Dr Bagchee has given this thread the title: "Once again on the  
Mokṣopāya and 'contamination' of scholarship". In the context of his  
e-mail, he thus suggests a relationship (a "contamination") between  
the MU edition and the ideology of National Socialism, otherwise this  
heading makes no sense.  
  
It will be understood that in view of this infamous insinuation I see  
no basis for any further discussion.
