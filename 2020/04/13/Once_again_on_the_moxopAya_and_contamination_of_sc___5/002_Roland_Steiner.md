\> Chanced upon this:  
\> <https://www.academia.edu/42725519/Paul_Hacker_Nazi_Dossier>  
\>  
\> Thank you Dr. Adluri and Dr. Bagchee, for making this accessible.  
  

What one should know: This "Paul Hacker Nazi dossier" consists of 13  
pages. Of these, pages 1–2 relate to another Paul, namely Paul Thieme.  
Pages 11–13 relate to a different “Paul Hacker” than the later  
Indologist of the same name.  
  
Best,  
Roland Steiner
