Please look at the front pages of these two different editions. One mentions प्रथमो भाग:, while the other with a greater number of pages makes no such mention of प्रथमो भाग:. My guess is that Tripathi originally intended to publish a द्वितीयो भाग: to supplement his प्रथमो भाग:, but later on revised the book and published it without any separate भागs. I could be wrong, but having never seen द्वितीयो भाग:, this is my best guess.
