There is one more interesting verse which needs to be completed from the bits which I give below.

  

हां हां दद्यात् हुं हुं दद्यात्.

  

it ends: न दद्यात् सिंहगर्जने..

  

We used to recite it some 65 years back but now I completely forgot it.

  

I request scholars here to complete it and enlighten us.

  

Thanks and regards.
