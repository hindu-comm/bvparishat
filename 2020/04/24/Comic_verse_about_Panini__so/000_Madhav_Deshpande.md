I seem to partially recollect that there is a verse describing how students find the sandhi rules difficult and run away. As I remember, सुद्ध्युपास्य is one of those examples, and the verses says something like ....हता: केचित् .....हता: परे....हता: सर्वे. I wonder if anyone remembers such a verse.
