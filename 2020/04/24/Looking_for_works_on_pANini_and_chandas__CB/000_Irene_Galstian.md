Vishal's post reminded me that I meant to post this query, but things are even more hectic these days than in pre-Corona times, and I forgot.

  

I realise that this isn't a widely studied topic. All the more reason to find whatever is available. Since many list members are in touch with developments in various parts of India, I thought BVP could be a good place to ask.

  

Thank you,

Irene
