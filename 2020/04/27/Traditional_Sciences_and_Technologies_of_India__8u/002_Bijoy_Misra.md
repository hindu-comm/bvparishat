I read the article last night, it is a gloss journalistic view starting with Dharampal's book.

"A Concise History of Science in India" edited by D M Bose, [www.universitiespress.com](http://www.universitiespress.com)

should be consulted. I think a public soft copy is available.

For research interests, I can furnish the presentations we compiled here through India Discovery Center.

People with strong analytic interest in the sciences, may contact me offline.
