Thank you, Prof. Kannan, for sharing. Even here, it would seem that the west has taken the lead after making the necessary self-corrections. Just this semester, I heard from 3 students studying undergrad calculus in different US universities that they were told about the contributions of the Kerala school of mathematics. I wonder how many Indian universities can make the same claim.
