When two birds began chirping "koruk" daily on Ālattūr Nambi’s way to the temple, the Nambi one day replied in the following Sanskrit shloka. Seemingly satisfied, the birds flew away, never to return.

  

काले हितमितभोजी

कृत चङ्क्रमणः,क्रमेण वामशयः

अविधृत मूत्रपुरीषः स्त्रीषु

यतात्मा च यो नरःसोरुक्

  

The question from the birds wasकोरुक् (कोऽरुक् - कः अरुक्?).
