May I request vidvajjana-s' feedback please?

  

An unexpected turn in harivaMsha due to social distancing:

  

हित्वा हि पाणिग्रहणं ययातिः

गर्तात्‌ प्रयातश्च करोनभीतः ।

शुक्रात्मजायास्तु कथं विमुक्तिः

कथं च श्राव्या यदुनाथकीर्थिः ॥

  

ITRANS

hitvA hi pANigrahaNaM yayAtiH

gartAt prayAtashcha karonabhItaH \|

shukrAtmajAyAstu kathaM vimuktiH

kathaM cha shrAvyA yadunAthakIrthiH \|\|

  

Scared of Corona, yayAti went away from the ditch without holding (DevayAni's) hands.

How would shukra-daughter's rescue be? and how listen to kR^iShNa's glories?

  

Regards

Prabhu
