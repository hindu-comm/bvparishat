Namaste,

  

On the occasion of Sankara Jayanti I wish to share Adi Sankaracharya Puja Vidhi in five scripts. The original compilation was done by Sri. Harsha Rammurthy with Mantras. Here is a shorter version with only slokas which could help many people who do not have the upadesam of mantras. Hope thishelps.

  

Jaya Jaya Sankara Hara Hara Sankara
