नमस्ते विश्वास-वासुकेय-वर्य!

When typing देवनागरीin Google, there are three systems available मराठी, हिंदी, संस्कृत.

I get विसर्गः in संस्कृत by H (capital), but not so, not always inमराठी, हिंदी. I do not why.

I think colon forविसर्गः can be simple standard. विसर्ग: This typing is with colon. Previous one was with 'H'.

I am fairly happy withसंस्कृत, except that hereदेवनागरी numbers are not available. For that I switch toमराठी.

I wonder whyदेवनागरी numbers are not available inसंस्कृत, especially when they are available inमराठी.
