This abstract triggered many questions but here is only one them: who decided (also when and how) that*Suśruta-saṃhitā*can be assigned to "ca. second centuryCE"?

  

How can that 'assignment' be reconciled with Hoernle'sstatement:“On the other hand, there are indications in the *Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, …,* that the author of it was acquainted with doctrines of Suśruta...” (p. 8)<https://archive.org/stream/studiesinmedicin01hoeruoft#page/n23/mode/2up>

  

  

Also, in case this is of interest to anyone:
