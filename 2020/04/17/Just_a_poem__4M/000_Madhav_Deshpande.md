My verse in response to a beautiful verse by Balram Shukla Ji

  

नमस्तस्मै कटाक्षाय येन विद्ध: प्रहृष्यति ।

किमन्यैर्नेत्रविक्षेपैरक्ष्णोर्व्यायाम एव स: ।।

  

Salutations to the glance that pierces someone but makes him excited with joy. What is the use of other eye movements? They are just an eye exercise.
