Dear Sri Deshpande Ji, the verse youhave written:

  

द्वैताद्वैतविवादेषु विवदन्तां मुधा बुधा: ।  
विरामो यत्र वादानां रमते तत्र माधव: ।।११०५।।  

  

reminds me of

  

"*i*ndriyani parany ahur

indriyebhyah param manah  
manasas tu para buddhir  
yo buddheh paratas tu sah"

*  
*

*Hence my understanding of the second sentence:*

*  
*

विरामो यत्र वादानां रमते तत्र माधव:

is

  

"He is beyond logic or intellect (buddhi), only when logic ends, Madhava can be realized! (yoginAm hridaye ramate)

  

Even in Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa's (SRP's) discussion with Master M,

when Master M says "now I know why God gave *intellect* to people", SRP asks Master M, " why did God give people *intellect*?".

Then M said: "to realize that in spiteof any amount of intellectual reasoning, God cannot be known through intellect since *God is beyond intellect*". Then SRP agreed that "yes, now you have understood".

This thought reverberates in the Upanishads in several places for example

  

**न तत्र चक्षुर्गच्छति न वाग्गच्छति नो मनः\|**

**न विद्मो न जानीमो यथैतदनुशिष्यात्\|\|**

  

*

*Best Regards,*

*  
*

*Krishna Kashyap*
