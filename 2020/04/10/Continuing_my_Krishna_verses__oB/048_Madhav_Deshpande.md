Continuing my Krishna verses

  

द्वैताद्वैतादयो वादा अन्धानां हस्तिदर्शनम् ।  
किमेतैर्लभ्यते वादैर्माधवं भज माधव ।।११०७।।  
  
The debates over duality and non-duality are like the perception of an elephant by the blind. O Madhava, what is to be gained by these debates? Devote yourself to Madhava/Krishna.
