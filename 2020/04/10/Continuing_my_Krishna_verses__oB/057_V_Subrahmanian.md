What you say is not denied. In fact Ramana has himself given a lot of analogies to convey many things pertaining to Atma sadhana. The particular incident that is reported is just to remove the idea that 'an analogy, a construct, etc. could be made part of the goal the realization of which requires those analogies, etc.' There is this statement in the Panchadashi:

  

<https://sa.wikisource.org/s/1s1f>  

  

ग्रन्थमभ्यस्य मेधावी ज्ञानविज्ञानतत्परः ।  

पलालमिव धान्यार्थी त्यजेद्ग्रन्थमशेषतः ॥ ४५॥ 4.45

  

After having studied the books, the one who is focused on knowledge and experience (vijnana), let him give up the books completely, just as one would the husk after obtaining the grain.

  

Even here it is the spirit that is to be taken.
