This merits some clarification. It's not meant that slack reasoning or no reasoning is to be imposed as the 'right thing' on everyone. For a person whose natural inclination is attempting to understand by reason, the course of action is to fully devote himself to this task. If/when it's seen firsthand that reason isn't enough, the drive to reason everything out falls away by itself. This doesn't mean that from that point onward one stops all reasoning, it's just that reason as a human facility is allocated tasks it can manage. And until that realisation comes, one can just say, I'm trying but I don't know yet. We've got to take responsibility and not try to trick ourselves, even if nobody is watching.
