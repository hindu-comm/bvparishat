Continuing my Krishna verses

  

अद्वितीये हरौ लोके कमन्यं भारती स्तुयात् ।  
त्वमर्थ: सर्वशब्दानां स्तोतव्यो नापरोऽस्ति मे ।।१११३।।  
  
When Krishna is all that exists in the world, who else would Sarasvati, the goddess of speech, praise? You are the meaning of all words. I don't have anyone else worth praising.
