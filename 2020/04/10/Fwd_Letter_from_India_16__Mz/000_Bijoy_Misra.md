Dear friends,

  

Normally in early April, I walk around the yard to check on

many plants that I have procured through my efforts to learn

gardening. I lost a large number in the early years till my wife

gave me insight into the plant life. Like most men, I did not  

leave the design curiosity to her, but maintaining anything is  

hard. She treats a plant like her baby.

  

One of the finest contributions of India to the world is the science

of yoga. The philosophy of yoga rests on the principle that the

universe is one and man has the ability to identify himself or herself

with any object completely in an immersive manner. It is a process

of self-dissolution, where the "other object" becomes the only priority.

The "object" controls the relationship and there is no "subject."

It manifests in the phrase like "true love" like a mother has to her

baby. It goes further to analyze that anything "true" has no subject.

True friendship, true knowledge or true wealth is not "owned" by

anyone, it exists.

  

We do not know the full evolution of the yoga literature, we only know  

the findings. The observation is that we have two levels in our mind,

one is superficial, manipulative and fickle, the other, an inner mind  

that reasons, understands and knows. We operate our life by suppressing inner mind being locally driven for our physical comfort

and conveniences. We do get a glimpse of the inner mind when we

pursue mindful activities like music, dance, writing or painting where

we evaluate our own work through the inner mind. Yoga makes access

to the inner mind by identifying the nuances of the outer mind. It is

not easy and it goes on making scientific prescriptions to achieve

the pathway. Yoga becomes easy if you live on your inner truth all

the time and don't lose your ground for conveniences or scare.

This non-scare nature of yoga has been called God, Ishwara in  

technical literature.

  

There are legends in India that Jesus Christ visited India during his

periods of travel and was exposed to the philosophy of yoga. There

is a Jesus shrine in the Kashmir valley in the Himalayas claiming

that Jesus lived there for a number of years. A massive university

with world-wide fame did operate not too far in Taxila, in modern

day Pakistan (close to the location where bin Laden was captured).

Taxila University operated from the third century BC to about 2nd

century AD and is known to be the center of most intellectual activity in

classical India. I do not know the research on the life of Jesus,

but i do see similarity in the teachings ascribed to him to the teachings

in yoga.  

  

The principal teaching in both systems is to treat the "other" person as "you" and treat all as "equals". While yoga stayed as an intellectual

exercise in India, Jesus wanted to make it a practical way of life calling

it Christianity. So is my view. Many in Lincoln are practitioners of the faith. I wrote this as an introduction to get to the state of Christianity in India which I will try tomorrow.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra (Bhubaneswar, India)
