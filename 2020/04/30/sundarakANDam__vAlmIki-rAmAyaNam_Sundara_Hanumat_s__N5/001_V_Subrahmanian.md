In the video Brahmasri Samavedam Shanmukha sharma says that these 32 names are strewn across the Sundara Kandam. In the shlokas shown in the video there are names such as 'shiva dhyanaparah, mahalinga pratishthaataand shivapuja paraayanah' Are such events associated with Hanuman in the Sundara Kanda of the Valmiki Ramanyanam? We have to examine this.
