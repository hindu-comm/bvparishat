I found there is only 27 names in the stothra and I found the complete stotra as from Parashara Samhita in face book page. Which clearly says as:

  

सप्तविंशतिसङ्ख्याकान्येतानि श्रीहनूमतः।

पडन्नामानि सो विप्रो नियमेनाप्यतन्द्रितः।

... ..

Hence this seems to be not from Sundarakanda of Valmiki Ramayana.
