Dear Dr Dash,

Thank you for your response.  

I feel like a man stranded at a remote location. Here we have a huge task of

presenting India to the world. In various ways, India is fossilized, distorted and

various pseudo-commentaries are used as text-books. But then some other

processes are causing to create insecurity among the children back home.  

A sincere grass-root scholar movement would be required to champion Indian ideals

and literature through the high school education. Richness of language acquiring

is in the medium of instruction.  

Best regards,

BM
