Dear friends,

The lock down in India gave me an opportunity to watch the local culture

through the TV. I admired the depth of India's folk culture, Odisha is a hot bed

of indigenous culture. There were TV channels who captured the instruments,

the rhythm from the village women. It was delightful to watch the imaginative

nature of dramatic displays with simple thematic presentations leading to

moral education and principles. The richness is phenomenal.

Then I saw the use of language in the newscast and reporting. This was

disappointing. Many didn't know what to say, many were struggling for words.

Most expressions were artificial. The language was Odia, but the construct  

was strange. Most importantly I noticed the reporters not to have the grasp

of their reports and were creating mechanical statements. The English shows  

were utter imitations from the west and were mostly uncouth.  

This observation prompts me to write this mail for a possible role of BVP in

helping out the language training in India's youth. There appeared to be substantial

decrease in literature training, leading to the lack of appreciation of the use of words.

Literature and folk plays help us to learn the splendor of the word use in a language.

It is certainly reducing in Indian schools. The word is not a living concept any more,  

but becoming fossilized like those used by the foreign missionaries.  

Periodic volunteering in the local schools by sharing expertise might be a doable

act. It could be enriching to the participants in its own contributory role. The national  

and the state governments may eventually wake up to safeguard the country's language

treasure and the manifest grandeur of country's literature.

Thank you for letting me express this view. I was distressed. My decision to eventually

leave was prompted by the massive abuse of language by the politicians touting

as elected representatives. The Odisha Chief Minister fails to speak Odia!

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
