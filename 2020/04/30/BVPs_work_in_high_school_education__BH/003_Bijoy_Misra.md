Thank you Rukmaniji. It is the vocabulary that appealed to me. I had noticed it through my early childhood

but did not appreciate the power of expression in brevity and in metaphors. it appears to me that the brain

has a natural arrangement to economize expression. it is perhaps natural in small social settings.

Things need expansion when we have to report to someone who "wants to know". In smaller societies

denser words can form as a part of condensation and precision. The biology and neurology of this

would need analytic research.

  

I should also comment that I went through the The Munda Languages that I had picked up from the library.

There is effort to map a language under some arbitrary standard scale to estimate an "age". I thought

the foundation was artificial. There is some structural analysis, not appreciation of the word formation.

I thought the process was too superficial.
