The translations. The indigenous languages use massive ruDhi.

As a native speaker, I was not fully cognizant of it till I engaged

myself in translating a section of the fifteenth century Odia mahabharata

(Oxford, 2005) A word can be used in many ways, noun, adjective, verb, adverb etc.

It appears to me that linear analysis would be incorrect.

So i wanted to check the scholars. My father's work does not go  

to the oral literature. I am studying and keeping notes.
