Your question  

  

language expressions particularly as calibrated by the western

linguistics

  

is not clear to me.

  

This may be because you do not know the terms in the discipline.  

  

Please explain your question with examples.  

  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

Linguistics is a contemporary discipline, an international discipline like most of the contemporary international disciplines, with a western origin.  

  

What do you intend to communicate through the word 'Indian Linguistics' ? Do you mean ancient Indian study of language ?  

  

Are you looking for the terms in western Linguistics for the terminology in ancient Indian study of language ?
