Dr Prasad,

  

I know that usage. For that matter, there are usages like Telugu Linguistics too.  

  

In all these cases, application of contemporary linguistics to the specific language or group of languages is intended to be communicated. Study of Indian languages by applying contemporary discipline of Linguistics is what is being called as Indian Linguistics.  

  

Journal of Indian Linguistics is run by Linguistic Society of India <http://www.lsi.org.in/about.php>, <http://www.lsi.org.in/pubs.php>
