\<\<The research I am looking for is the application of concept-based semantic analysis to older hill languages as regards the formation of words.  
Our current focus here is on the neurology of speech, so we look in older oral languages.>\>  

  

Sir, in about 2006, Bob Eaton, an American, was doing PhD in Kangri. He was a member in one Hindi/Urdu group.

If research on Kangri could be useful to you, you may contact him on his email ID:Bob Eaton \<[pete_de...@hotmail.com]()\>
