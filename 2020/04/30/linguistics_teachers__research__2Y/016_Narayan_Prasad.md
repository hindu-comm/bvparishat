\<\<What do you intend to communicate through the word 'Indian Linguistics' ?>\>

  

There is a journal under this title published from India.

  

\<\<Do you mean ancient Indian study of language ?>\>

  

I think, all the three fields mentioned under wikipedia are involved under "Indian Linguistics"

  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_linguistics>  

  

  

One section under the title "Indian Linguistics" also exists in AIOC.

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
