I have lost track of this discussion, but the term "Indian Linguistics" has two meanings. One meaning is that it refers to linguistic theories that developed in ancient through medieval India, and it has been used by many in this sense. The other meaning of "Indian Linguistics" is the science of linguistics as it is practised in India today in various departments of linguistics at different universities. There is a long established Linguistic Society of India with its head office at the Deccan College in Pune, and their journal is titled "Indian Linguistics". There is an Indian Journal of Dravidian Linguistics coming from Trivandrum. This is not ancient Indian linguistics, but linguistic study of Indian languages acrossIndia using techniques and theories of modern linguistics. These two kinds of "Indian Linguistics" are often studied by unrelated derdspartments and very few people have familiarity with both types of linguistics. That is my experience.
With best regards,
