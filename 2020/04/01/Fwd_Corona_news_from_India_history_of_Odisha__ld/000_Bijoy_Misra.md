Friends,

The complete lock-down imposed by the Government on the 24th night

has stranded millions of migrant workers who operate in cities on daily wages. The culture to create a support class had long been in making

in the Indian system but engineered to completion first through the  

Islamic kings and then during the British Empire. The technique to

make a person work for the King was first to create a class of landless through taxation and to create an artificial unproductive middle class who would be engaged in collecting the taxes and would be protected by the King. I have not studied the European history, but the creation of a privileged class through land is a master economic manipulation against the peasants who till the land.  

  

Among Indian states, Odisha was most affected by the British. Tucked

in a geography of about four hundred square miles, the land is washed  

by three large rivers and the land has been agricultural for more than

ten thousand years. Since the land produced plenty, people from the area

only moved for trade and developed a self-contained local culture of their own design. The language is oral and the grammar is cognitive than structural. While the Vedic religion was spread in the north India and was systematized as Hinduism in the south, Odisha carried her own cult of treating the Earth as the universal mother. When the Vedas reached Odisha, they developed a new system called *tantra* where the nature can be controlled by human techniques. It buys into the thinking that the human mind has much larger potential and is possible to do miracles by controlling mind. Some of it has eventually gone into the practice of yoga. Many of it has merged into the concept of a deity called Jagannatha that embodies time and is considered the ruler of the area. The massive temple (170ft high) to Jagannatha exists in Puri in the coast. The Temple was completed in 11th century and has been operational since. (picture below)  

  

The important aspect of Odisha culture is the strong affinity to land and its preservation (I was attracted to Lincoln because of its cultural affinity to

land!). Massive leisure due to liberal supply of food helped develop

artistry in food, textiles, jewelry, household goods and finally the stone carving. People developed strong ownership to their way of life and their  

style of art and architecture. Odisha is identified with her indigenous

work in Indian cultural scene. Islamic rulers tried to destroy the culture,

but were defeated by the local militia. The militia has been strong since

three thousand years and did brew in the area I currently live. The coastal militia was supported by other militia from the hills.

  

The British came to India for food and did eye to occupy Odisha. They were rebuffed for about fifty years until 1860 and then they resorted to  

create local protectorates called princely states. All food was transported  

out and for the first time Odisha faced back to back famines in the period 1860-1870. Millions perished, Odisha was broken. The rest eighty

years of British rule did not help. Odisha remained unconnected to  

the world and with utter misery and absolute poverty.

  

Today on April 1, 84 years ago in 1936, the British granted an independent statehood to Odisha. It became the first language-based  

self-administered state. But the economy was broken, it is not clear

if the morale is fully broken. Unlike many other places in the world, the

people here are the same that lived three thousand years ago, but they

don't dream of creating the magnificent temples their forefathers did.

The prosperity of the land is destroyed, but the richness of art and

artistry continues only with the villagers particularly in the village women.

  

It is not easy to visit the land. I will write more about tourism later.  

  

Best regards,

Bijoy (in Bhubaneswar, India)
