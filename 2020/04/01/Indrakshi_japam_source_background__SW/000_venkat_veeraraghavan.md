Dear Vidvans

Yesterday evening around 930 pm Sankara TV posted a rendition of Indrakshi japam by Ganesh ghanapatigal and team for healing the world of Corona.

Recently a similar japam was held at an aunt's house to heal a cousin of mine who is seriously ill.

Could the vidvans share source, history and usage of Indrakshi stotram as applied in private and public contexts?

Thanks

Venkat
