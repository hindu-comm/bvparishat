Some synchronicity right here...as I open this mail to answer, there is the chanting of Indraakshi happening on Sankara again!

  

Shri Venkatesh ji and Shri Harissh ji Thanks for your replies.

Shri Venkatesh ji-> It seems the chanting of Indraakshi and Siva Kavacham might be one of those practices that came in specific lineages. It must have been individually added to one's sadhana paddhati like Aditya Hrdayam

  

Shri Harissh ji--> Could you please list out the paatha bhedas, so that some of the other scholars can weigh in with views on authenticity?

I believe a similar paatha bheda exists with the Shri suktam....("aardhraam pushkariniim.....chandraam hiraNmayiimlakshmiim jaatavedo ma aavaha")
