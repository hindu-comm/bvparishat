The West "at its best", as usual, even to this day : Damnatory verdicts on India  

(and Modi) all the time. Have prejudice, envy, and racism no limits?  

And yet the West has the nerve to preach against racism to the whole world.  

Brazen : Plunder and destroy others, and celebrate "Apology Day"!

Unadulterated hypocrisy unlimited.

The academia exemplified by Prof.s Pollock and O'Flaherty

are just the "worthy" successors of Miss Mayo.  

  

See the epigrammatic quote of Gandhiji at the top of the page,  

and Sri Suryaprasad's article on the Indian situation wrt the coronavirus  

vis-a-vis that of the West.
