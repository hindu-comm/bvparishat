Nagaraj ji, you have provided good information on Hyderabadi Dakkhani.
Hyderabadi Dakkhani reminds me of French Creole.

  

I have a friend of Indian origin from Mauritius. At home, they speak French Creole, so it can be considered as his "mother tongue" although his ancestors who arrived in Mauritius sometime in the second half of the 1800's spoke Bhojpuri. He is proficient in standard French too.
And since they teach English in schools, he speaks good English too. He knows a little Bhojpuri and Hindi because the grandparents sometimes spoke that language and also because they watch Bollywood movies in Mauritius.

  

According to my friend, French Creole is a mixture of several languages. The base is the French that the colonialists brought from France. But it changed a lot from that original French. Words were borrowed from African languages (of the slaves who were brought from Africa) and also from languages like Bhojpuri, Marathi, Telugu, Tamil and Chinese of the indentured laborers. It also underwent grammatical and syntax changes. I was surprised to learn that in Mauritius there is the yummy "puttu" that we eat in Kerala and they call it by the same name "puttu".

  

The base of Hyderabadi Dakkhani might have been a closely related sister language of Khari Boli (the base for Hindi/Urdu) spoken in some part of north India. When it reached Hyderabad and other parts of south India, it might have undergone changes because of the influence of other languages and also because of the passage of time.

  

This also reminds me of a friend and ex colleague who is from Madurai and whose mother tongue is the Saurashtram language. The language has changed a lot from the Gujarati now spoken in the Saurashtra region.
But I could catch a couple of words because of their similarity to Gujarati. According to my friend, Saurashtram language has borrowed a lot from Tamil, and also from Marathi, Kannada and Telugu. His ancestors must have left Saurashtra at least a 1000 years ago, according to my friend. His ancestors were silk weavers from Saurashtra.

  

Regards,
