While all the usages given in the Wiki link are familiar, as spoken in the streets of Hyderabad, and most of them are derivable from Hindustani, I think the usage observed by Sri Warrier is different, mainly in verb forms and a large proportion of Dravidian words (these are fewer in the dialect spoken in Hyderabad, like chembu). For instance, "main (some action) karti" (spoken by men) is a very common usage in the districts but this is not heard in Hyderabad. My view was that like Tanjavur Marathi, the change is much more in pronunciation than in the language itself, but I never paid much attention to that.
