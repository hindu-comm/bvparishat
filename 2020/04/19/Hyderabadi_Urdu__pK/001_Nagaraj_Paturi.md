Interesting that brought this up.

  

What is generally misunderstood as 'Hyderabadi Urdu' is not Urdu or Hindi at all.

  

It is a different language called Dekkhani. The name comes from Dakshina \> Dekkhan \>(Deccan )

  

As you observed it is spoken not just in Hyderabad but in many parts of South India. That is why it is called Dekkhani.
