नखो -usage

  

 नखो in Dekkhani is not just a word, its a syntactic usage.

  

नखो = नहीं चाहिए

  

नखो = मत

  

usages are different from

  

नै= नहींं

  

 नखो seems to be a Marathi borrowing.

  

But its usage seems to be the influence of vaddu / bēḍa of Telugu, Kannada.

  

चाय होना क्या ?

  

नखो । ( नहीं चाहिए )

  

नखो खा = मत खाओ

  

होना बोलके = deliberately is another such Telugu / Kannada influence.

  

 होना बोलके रोराय = is weeping with some plan / ulterior motive
