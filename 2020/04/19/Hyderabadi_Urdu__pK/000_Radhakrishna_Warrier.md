This is a question not on Sanskrit, but on a related language which is Hyderabadi "Urdu". When the speakers of this language speak to me in standard Urdu/Hindi, I don't find any difficulty in understanding their language. But when these people speak among themselves, I find some difficulty in understanding. This is not at all because of Farsi / Urdu words. 

  

As I understand it, standard Hindi/Urdu is based on Khari Boli (खड़ी बोली). I think the so called "Urdu" of Hyderabad is not based on Khari Boli, but based on a closely related sister language. The original language of Hyderabad is Telugu. The Hyderabadi "Urdu" must have come with the Muslim invaders from north. My question is, if Hyderabadi Urdu is not based on Khari Boli, which language is it based on? Is it Avadhi, Bhojpuri, Magahi, Maithili, or some similar language?

  

On another note, the Hyderabadi Urdu is spoken by many Muslims in Karnataka, Maharashtra and even Tamil Nadu. Actually, among the Muslims of Karnataka, Kannada/Tulu/Kodava (Coorgi) speaking Muslims are a minority. The majority is the Hyderabadi "Urdu" speaking. I believe the case is similar in Maharashtra.
