Which is the correct way of writing Visakhapatnam in Telugu?

  

విశాఖపట్నం (Viśākhapaṭnam) or విశాఖపట్టణం (Viśākhapaṭṭaṇam)?

  

In Malayalam we write it as Viśākhapaṭṭaṇam (വിശാഖപട്ടണം)

In Malayalam, paṭṭaṇam means town.

  

I find that this word is written in different ways in Sanskrit:

  

Pattana with dental t (and dental/alveolar n)

Paṭṭana with retroflex t (and dental/alveolar n)

Paṭṭaṇa with both t and n retroflex.

  

Is only one of the above correct, or all are correct? Or do these different forms reflect different shades of meaning?
