Dear Sri Acharya,

From your post I understand you are translating a Kannada book about a religious institution founded a few centuries back, when such foreign words were in official use in the administrative circles of Hindu kings and officers. A good reference for such officially accepted words is the राज्यव्यवहारकोश in Sanskrit prepared for use by the ministers of Shivaji. PFA a copy. This may be helpful in knowing the meanings of many non-Sanskritic technical words.

Thanks

  

RN Iyengar
