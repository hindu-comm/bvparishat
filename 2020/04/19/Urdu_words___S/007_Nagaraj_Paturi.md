Tehsildar is the term used to describe a tax inspector in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. They are in charge of obtaining taxes from a Tehsil. The term is assumed to be of Mughal origin, and is perhaps a combination of the words"Tehsil" and "Dar" ("Tehsil", presumably an Islamic word derived from Arabic meaning "revenue collection" and"dar", apparently a Persian word meaning "holder of a position"). The role of a Tehsildar possibly existed during the period of British Administration, and was subsequently used by Pakistan and India following their independence from the British Empire. Tehsildar is also known as Talukdar in some states of India.The immediate subordinate of a Tehsildar is might be known as a Naib Tehsilda. The word Mamlatdar is derived from the Arabic word ‘Muamala’ with suffix ‘dar’. Mu ‘amala’ means business, a serious,difficult or complicated matter.The state government has power to appoint a Tahsildar (Mamlatdar) for taluka who shall be the chief officer entrusted with the local revenue administration of a taluka. The Mamlatdar has to function and perform various duties under section 70 of the Bombay Tenancy and agriculture Land Act. Tahsildar is assisted by Naib- TYahsildar- sec.1 of M.L.R.C.  
Originally it was restricted to rural areas to give immediate possession of lands, premises, trees etc., as distinguished from urban matters. Jurisdiction was limited to agricultural lands or premises. But due to defective language in the act it was extended to towns and cities. Heavy work was given to the Mamlatdar and it was under consideration that the burden should be reduced and so section 5 provides that the jurisdiction of the Mamlatdar should be reduced to agricultural lands or premises used for agriculture or grazin.
