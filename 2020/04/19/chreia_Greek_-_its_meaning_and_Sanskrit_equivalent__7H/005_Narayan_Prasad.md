Dear Sir,

   Thank you so much for the detailed meaning of the term अष्टावधान.

   About 20 years back one Telugu scholar told me about this term. We used to meet at BORI. When I greeted him with "नमस्कार!", he would say "प्रणाम!". The latter is the usual term in the Hindi belt.

   He also told me about the enmity between the Jains and Hindus and said that the Telugu poetअप्पाकवि had indicated such thing in his work (अप्पाकवीयमु?).

  

   As per Russian-Russian dictionary, chreia: (In rhetoric): speech, reasoning on a given topic, compiled according to certain rules.

   I was thinking that chreia might be translated as अष्टावधान. But this does not appear to be a suitable Skt equivalent.

 Best regards

 Narayan Prasad
