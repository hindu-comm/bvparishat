Dear Mr Prasad,  
  
The Greek word χρεία (*chreía*) means "use, usefulness". It has a special meaning in Ancient Greek Rhetoric. For the sake of convenience, see:  
  
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chreia>  
  
Or, <https://oxfordre.com/classics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199381135.001.0001/acrefore-9780199381135-e-1554>  
  
"A succinct anecdote embedding a pointed saying, so called because designed for use in rhetoric (χρησίμον τινὸς ἕνεκα, Hermog.Prog. c. 3); exercises in developing *chreiai* formed one of the varieties of \**progymnasmata*. Collections of *chreiai* were already being made in the 4th cent. bce, e.g. by Theocritus of Chios and \*Demetrius (3) of Phalerum, and they figure prominently in some biographies of philosophers, e.g. that of \*Diogenes (2) by \*Diogenes (6) Laertius; the ancestry of the genre may be seen in some parts of \*Xenophon (1)'s *Memorabilia*, and the *Apophthegmata* preserved in the Plutarchan corpus are a close relative. The moral tone of the *chreiai* is far from austere." (Christopher Pelling)  
  
\["*chreiai*" is the plural form (nominative) of *chreia*.\]

According to Sircar (*Indian Epigraphical Glossary*. Dehli 1966, p. 33) *aṣṭāvadhāna* designates "one who has the power of listening and grasping eight things at a time; Epith of a poet".  
  
With best regards,  
Roland Steiner
