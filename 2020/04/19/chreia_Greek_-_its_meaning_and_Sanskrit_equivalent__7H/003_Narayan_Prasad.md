Sir,

  

 Thank you so much for the reply.

  

  I had a look at the works like the one mentioned in the wikipedia. Different Greek authors explain the term "chreia" with examples in many pages, e.g. "Progymnasmata: Greek Textbooks of Prose Composition and Rhetoric", translated byGeorge A Kennedy.

  

  Best regards

  Narayan Prasad
