Dear Sir,

  

*Aṣṭāvadhāna* is a subset of *Sāhitya-avadhāna*, an Indian performing art. Rooted in classical poetry and extempore versification, it involves eight questioners (*pracchaka*s or *pṛcchaka*s) posing challenges to a performer (*avadhānī*). Since the primary meaning of *avadhāna* is concentration, an *avadhānī* is a person who possesses it to a remarkable degree.The performer composes impromptu verses as answers to the questions, amidst distractions, without the aid of stationery. *Aṣṭāvadhāna* proceeds in four rounds. The performer composes one foot of a verse in each of the rounds; he recalls the whole verse at the end of the event and explains its meaning.    

  

*Aṣṭāvadhāna* gets its name because of the number of questioners and / or the number of components involved. A typical performance includes the following components:

1.  *Niṣiddhākṣarī* / *Niṣedhākṣarī*: Composing a verse under syllabic
    constraints, 2.  *Samasyā-pūrti* / *Samasyā-pūraṇa*: Solving a poetic challenge, 3.  *Datta-padī* / *Datta-pada*: Composing a verse using four specific
    words, 4.  *Citra-kavitā*: Composing a verse with multiple daunting constraints
    (such as a monosyllabic verse, one that adheres to a pattern of a
    floral bouquet, or one that envelops multiple verses), 5.  *Ā**śu-kavitā*: Composing a complete verse swiftly,
6.  *Kāvya-vācana*: Identifying and expounding on a verse composed by a
    classical Sanskrit poet, 7.  *Saṅkhyā-bandha*: Solving a 5\*5 magic square intermittently
    throughout the performance, and  
8.  *Aprastuta-prasaṅga*: Engaging in an entertaining banter
    intermittently throughout the performance.

Since the performer must compose verses alongside solving a magic square and engaging in entertaining chat, the art form is a veritable test to his ability to multitask, think laterally, and manage various 'crises.' Several other components are designed to break the performer's concentration or exercise his erudition and creative imagination to the extreme.  

  

\[Oftentimes, people unfamiliar with *Aṣṭāvadhāna* confuse it with *Aṣṭāvadhāna-sevā* or *Aṣṭa-vidhāna-sevā*, an eight-step ritual offered to the deities.\] *
