Dear Scholars,  

   Namaste.

  

   While translating Russian author Aleksandr Nikitenko'sautobiography, I came across a word "chreia" (Greek: χρεία). Most probably this term is related to rhetoric, because he has used it in that context. The Russian-Russian dictionary also gives the meaning of«хрия» in that context only.

   I request scholars to explain its meaning and give its Sanskrit equivalent.

   In this context I would also like to know what is exactlyअष्टावधान.

   Best regards

   Narayan Prasad
