 Dear list,

  

I'm looking for bibliographical details (i.e. pdf of or link to) of the following works to find out the reference to Bellaṃkoṇḍa Rāmarāyakavi, 1875-1914, there.  

  

  

1. Nyāyacandrikā of Ᾱnandapūrṇamunīndra, Government Oriental Manuscripts Library, Madras, 1959.

  

2.New Catalogus Catalogorum, Vol. I, ed. V. Raghavan, University of Madras, 1968 (I'm not sure if Vol. I has reference toRāmarāyakav, or in any other volume).

  

  

With regards,

Niranjan
