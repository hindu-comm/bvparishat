The presence of Dravidian loanwords in the Rigveda implies that Dravidian and Aryan speakers were, by the time of its [composition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/composition), fused into one speech [community](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/community) in the great [Indo-Gangetic Plain](https://www.britannica.com/place/Indo-Gangetic-Plain), while independent [communities](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/communities) of Dravidian speakers had moved to the [periphery](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/periphery) of the Indo-Aryan area (Brahui in the northwest, Kurukh-Malto in the east, and Gondi-Kui in the east and central India). Notably, the most ancient forms of the Dravidian languages are found in southern India, which was not exposed to Sanskrit until the 5th century bce. This suggests that the south was populated by the speakers of the Dravidian languages even before the entry of Aryans into India.

So first,  

  

'the south was populated by the speakers of the Dravidian languages even before the entry of Aryans into India.'  

  

then

  

'Dravidian speakers had moved to the [periphery](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/periphery) of the Indo-Aryan area '
