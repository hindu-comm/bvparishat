Namaste,

  

There is an excellent study in Malayalam on 'The Mutual Relationship of Aryan and Dravidian Languages' (Arya-dravida Bhashakalute Paraspara Bandham) by L.A. Ravi Varma published in 1932, which is available online at  

<https://archive.org/details/AryaDravidaBhashakaludeParasparaBandham-LARaviVarma/page/n57/mode/1up>

  

First chapter deals with the possible evolution of Dravidian scripts from Brahmi script. In the 2nd chapter, the author gives a list 570 dhatus and 100 nouns in Malayalam that have evolved from Sanskrit dhatus and nouns.

  

A few pages are missing in the scan available at [archive.org](http://archive.org).  

  

regards  
shankara
