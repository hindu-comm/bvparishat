F. Kittel has in his "A Kannada English Dictionary" (1894) listed 420 words that are probably borrowed by संस्कृत from द्रविड (pp. xvii - xliii).

In section VI, "Dravida elements in संस्कृत Dictionaries", pp. xiv- xvii, he has presented a brief history of research works published in different journals.
