Dear Colleagues,

  

Many years back I had come across an edition/book that included a poetic translation of the *Meghadūta* of Kālidāsa into all Indian/South Asian languages. I do recall there was also a poetic translation into Kashmiri by Arjun Dev Majboor (1924-2015). I cannot recall who had edited/published this book, or even the complete title of the book. Would someone have any idea aboutthis?

  

Since we started re-reading *Meghadūta* recently,**I really wanted to read the Kashmiri rendering again. Many years back I had attempted a poetic Kashmiri translation of a few verses of the *Kumārasaṃbhava*that I lost. The self-reflexive quarantine situation is making me think about such attempts yet again. Any help in finding the above book wouldbe highly appreciated.

  

Mrinal
