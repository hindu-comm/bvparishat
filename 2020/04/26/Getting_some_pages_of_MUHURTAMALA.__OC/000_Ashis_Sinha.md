Respected Scholars,

   I have one downloaded copy of Muhurtamala by Raghunatha, but that copy has not the Title pages and the Text pages No, 6 & 7 containing Slokas from 16 to 26. Can you kindly help me by giving me the scanned copies of those pages particularly the Text pages No. 6 & 7 ?

  Secondly I will be grateful if you kindly provide me the Title pages of Muhurtama by Chakrapani Mishra along with the Text pages which contain the Codes representing the different numbers from 1 and onward. This book is not available in archive .org.

                With regards,

                                   
         Ms. S. Sinha.
