In the Valmiki Ramayanam is this verse:  

  

विष्णो पुत्रत्वमागच्छकृत्वात्मानं चतुर्विधम्।

तत्र त्वं मानुषो भूत्वा प्रवृद्धं लोककण्टकम्॥१-१५-२१॥  

  

It says Vishnu aught to descend as the four sons of Dasharatha by making Himself fourfold.

  

However, the three others are not counted as avatara-s. Even though Krishna - Balarama pair and Rama - Parashurama pair lived during the same time and are counted among the Ten Avatara-s, why are the three siblings of Rama not so counted?

  

Is there any explanation in the Ramayana itself or elsewhere for this?
