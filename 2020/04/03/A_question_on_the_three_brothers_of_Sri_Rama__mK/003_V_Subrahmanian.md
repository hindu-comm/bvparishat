This is very interesting, Shankara ji. In the first link, we find this information: (as Prof. K.S.Kannan ji suggested):

  

//The deities here are the four sons of King Dasaratha of Ramayana. Lord Ram, the eldest of them is the seventh avatar (incarnation) of Lord Vishnu, who is the Supreme God of the Hindus. Bharata, second amongst them, is the avatar of the Panchajanya (Conch held by Vishnu) .Lakshmana is the avatar of the Adisesha, the serpent of infinite measures and on whom Lord Vishnu sleeps in the Ocean of Milk. Satrughna (the One who is destroyer of enemies) is the twin brother to Lakshamana and the youngest .He is the avatar of the Sudarshana chakra held by Lord Vishnu.//

  

The second link has this interesting story:

  

//It is believed that the idols of Rama, Bharatha, Lakshmana and Shathrughna were the pooja idols of Lord Krishna. He worshipped these 4 idols in Dwaraka. At the end of Dwapara Yuga, Dwaraka was swallowed by the sea. These four idols floated over the sea water all together and at last reached the Cheetuva region of Kerala shore. Vakkayil Kaimal, a minister with the Ayirur Kovilakam of Ponnani had a dream one night in which some mysterious person appeared before him and told him about the floating idols. The Kaimal being an ardent devotee hastened to the sea shore. There the fishermen who got the idols handed over them to him. They were duly installed in four temples - Rama at Thriprayar, Bharata at Irinjalakuda, Lakshmana at Moozhikulam and Shathrughna at Payammal - as directed in the dream.//

  

Thanks for these links.

  

warm regards
