Shankara ji,

  

With due respect, even though its printed front page says "रामानुज कृत टीका समेतम्", a quick look at its contents shows that in reality this text is nothing other than the well-known 'tilaka' commentary, and it has nothing to do with shri Ramanujacharya ji (the viShishTadvaitin aachaarya). I have no idea why the editor/publisher of this Calcutta edition attributed the commentary to "रामानुज", when at the very start the commentator says "रामो रामप्रवर्त्तकः रामायणस्य तिलकं कुरुते रामतुष्टये" and at the end of every chapter it says "इति श्री रामाभिरामे श्रीरामीये रामायणतिलके ...काण्डे ...सर्गः".

The "tilaka" commentary is believed to have been authored by Nagesha Bhatt but published with attribution to "raama" or "raama varmaa", who was Nagesha's patron and disciple. It is well known that "raama varmaa" / "raama si.mha", king of shringaverapura (Singraur, near Allahabad in UP) was a disciple of, and provided regular financial support to, Nagesha Bhatt. Nagesha has mentioned him as benefactor/patron in some of his works.

  

There is no way this commentary could be ascribed to "the" Ramanujacharya ji, because... it mentions, at several places, the "kataka" Tika of Kataka Madhava Yogindra (from mid/late 17th century AD).  

  

I am afraid by the time this post appears on BVP there might be many other messages pointing out the same, though at the moment I do not see any. :-)  

  

Regards,

Sushil
