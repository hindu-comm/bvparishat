Sharma ji,

  

You are right about Acharya Ramanuja not being the author of the tika (Calcutta edn). I had shared earlier a journal article on 'Srivaishnava commentators on the Ramayana', in which the author of Ramanujiya tika was identified as 'Kandala Ramanuja'. Even that information seems doubtful now.

  

The content of the tika attributed to Ramanuja is same as that of Tilaka tika of Nagesabhatta.  

  

regards  
shankara
