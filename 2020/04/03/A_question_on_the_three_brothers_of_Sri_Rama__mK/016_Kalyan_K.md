Dear Subrahmanian  
  
In the version of the Valmiki Ramayana, that is available on the net, it is reiterated in the yuddha kanda that Lakshmana is a part of Vishnu himself.  
  
शक्त्याब्राह्म्या तु सौमित्रिस्ताडितोऽपि स्तनान्तरे \|  
विष्णोरमीमांस्यभागमात्मानं प्रत्यनुस्मरत् \|\| ६-५९-११२  
  
Lakshmana, though wounded in the breast by Brahma's weapon, recollected that he was an inconceivable fraction of Vishnu Himself.  
  
अश्वस्तश्च विशल्यश्च लक्ष्मणः शत्रुसूदनः \|\| ६-५९-१२२  
विष्णोर्भागममीमांस्यमात्मानम् प्रत्यनुस्मरन् \|  
  
Healed and free from that lance, Lakshmana the annihilator of his foes, recollected of himself as a part of the inconceivable Vishnu the Lord of Preservation.  
  
These verses are also present in critical edition (with minor variation).
