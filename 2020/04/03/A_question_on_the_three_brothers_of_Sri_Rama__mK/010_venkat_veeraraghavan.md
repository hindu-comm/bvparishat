Dear shri Subbu ji

The 3 brothers of Rama are subsumed within Him and need no separate mention is my take on this.

Rama's parivara is eternally a part of Him is the understanding.  
Tradition depicts Ram darbar that includes His shakti, 3 brothers and Hanuman.  
If you think of an avatara as a sankalpa of the viraat purusha....Rama encompasses all Sita..3 brothers and Hanuman.

Parashurama although he was a shaktyaveshaavatara or empowered by Vishnu is mentioned uniquely because the sankalpa is different.
