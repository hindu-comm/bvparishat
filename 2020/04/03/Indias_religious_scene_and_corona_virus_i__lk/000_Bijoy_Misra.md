I am writing a few notes to my town in the US  

from my location in Bhubaneswar.

Sometimes we write letters from a foreign city.

I am doing reverse. Sharing. There may be  

two more segments on the topic., i am writing  

with the new cases emerging from Delhi.  

Lincoln is a small town in Massachusetts.

I am an elected Commissioner in he town  

  

Friends,

India's cultivated religious views are a contradiction to the modern

world. The principal modern philosophical discovery happened

in India around 900BC with the statement that the "God" resides

inside the Man. God is "realized" than prayed to. God does not

give health or wealth, but gives us intelligence and creativity. Man

achieves. God's grace is not selective. All these declare the freedom

of man against any control or domination. To sustain such philosophy

possibly needed extremely good food supply and solid security. Some

inner stratification occurred to run the society, but the personal economy

was not affected. A man or a family could choose a profession and excel

in his/her life. Excellence in work was considered attaining God.

it was Platonic.



The seed of community living without local competition was developed

through the thousands of years development of agricultural economy.

The nature provides, does not ask for a return. Man is only a caretaker,

the wealth belongs in nature. It was pre-cash economy. While this

indigenous culture brewed, some people created kingdoms and got

annihilated to reconcile with the ground truth. But things did take a

different turn as cash transaction was introduced by the Greeks about

fourth century BC. A local economist tried to develop a new State model

containing different strata of society providing service to the State.

Different religious thoughts did come by, but Kautilya (the name of the

economist)'s model did stand the test of time. India remained the

most prosperous nation on the earth for more than fifteen hundred years.

China was a close second or occasionally higher because of its size.

Kautilya's model has been lately called the Hindu model. 



The foundation of indigenous thought was that the life-needs for the

individual are all provided for by the nature, and life's goal, if any, is

to help "others." To feel for another is equivalent to feel for God. 

The universe is one and nobody is an island. God resides in everything

and all is God. Hence the fundamental trait for each is to respect the

other object, reflected in the ritual of "namaste".  Respecting the other is the

first step to "feel" for the person. Because we talk about the universe,

the "person" can be any object and we get into mysticism and yoga.



I will write more about the developments and the ramification in

the present context tomorrow.



Best regards,

Bijoy Misra (in Bhubaneswar, India).
