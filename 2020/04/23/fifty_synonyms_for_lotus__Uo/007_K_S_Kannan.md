In several of my talks, I have illustrated the enormity of the word-building potential in Sanskrit,

justifying William Jones' dictum "... more copious than Latin ...".

  

There nevertheless seems to be some truth in Brough's statement;  
not all of the formulaically derivable words can be found  
attested in a majority of the several well-known works in Sanskrit.

(Nor can one easily pass a decree that such-&-such a word is not at all attested,

for the simple reason that there are hundreds of texts as yet unexplored).

  

Today our confidence increases directly proportional to the number of texts made searchable.  
Time was when *index verbora* used to get published for many key texts.  
Wrt Sanskrit, it may often be more easy to say if some expression is attested,

rather than say confidently that it is unattested.  
  
Usages in works of paNDita-kavi-s/citra-kAvya-s sometimes border on pathological constructions

(after the fashion of "pathological usages" coined in Linguistics for artificially posited expressions),

(and due also to an oftener dependence on ekAkShara-kosha-s etc.)  
though the border-line is somewhat porous.

  

Lastly, the vocabulary and syntax of the Bhagavata-purana is a bit dubious,

and perhaps not a very good measure or representative of "normal usage" in Sanskrit,

given its abounding linguistic idiosyncrasies (well analysed by Charudeva Sastri),

even though the adage goes : *vidyAvatAM bhAgavate parIkShA*.
