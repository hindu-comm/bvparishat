(Replying to the original message -- sorry, I had typed most of this hours ago and got interrupted, but sending this reply anyway even though it's mostly answered already...)

  

Note that when Brough speaks of “some fifty expressions for ‘lotus’” (I assume this referenceis to the discussionin pages 31–33 of the introduction in his *Poems from the Sanskrit*; here:<https://archive.org/details/PoemsFromTheSanskritJohnBrough/page/n31/mode/2up>), this includes expressions that one can obtain by taking, for example, any synonym for "water" or "mud" (e.g. vāri, ambu, jala, paṅka, ...), then (appropriately) suffixing anything indicating“born” or “grown” (e.g. -ja, -ruha, ...). This way one can probably obtain at least hundreds of synonyms -- and the notable thing (my garbled memory of a remark from some lecture by Shatavadhani Ganesh) is that any person reasonably well-read in Sanskrit literature can easily understand any such word even if encountering it for the first time,and it wouldn't feel out-of-place either.

  

But now I'm actually interested in the second-order remark that Brough makes on pages 32–33: in passing, he mentions that despite these general principles, there are some exceptions:

1\. the word*uda-ja*“does not appear to mean” ‘lotus’ though it could be used for fish, say,

2\. the word *udaka-ja* does not seem like it could be used (for a lotus anyway),

3\. on the other hand, any combination of synonyms from "earth-supporter" could be used for a king or a mountain -- no exceptions there (probably).

These are obviously his subjective assessments (and stated as such), but as there are many in this group with sensitive ears for the language, I would be interested to hear from others whether they agree and whether these can be explained.

  

With regards,
