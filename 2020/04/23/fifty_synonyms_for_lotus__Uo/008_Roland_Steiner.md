\> There nevertheless seems to be some truth in Brough's statement  
  

I do not want to question that at all. In his article "Lotusblumen" (in: Asiatica. Festschrift Friedrich Weller zum 65. Geburtstag. Ed. Johannes Schubert and Ulrich Schneider. Leipzig 1954, pp. 505–513) Wilhelm Rau examined the use of words for lotus and water lily in a number of *kāvya* works in which, according to his findings, a word *udaja* "lotus" apparently does not occur.  
  
But Brough could have known that in the *Bhāgavatapurāṇa* the word *udaja* "lotus" is used once because this passage is already recorded in the large Petersburg dictionary by Böhtlingk and Roth (Vol. 1; 1852-1855):  
  
<https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/PWGScan/2013/web/webtc/servepdf.php?page=5-1170>  
  
However, he probably considered this passage to be irrelevant, because his statement is only aimed at *kāvya* works in the narrower sense.  
  
Best,
