Dear Marcis,

  

  Instead of looking for a complete list, you can look at the structure of some of the words. For example, you can take any word meaning water and add the element ज and you can get a word for lotus.
Some of the resulting combinations will be more common than others, and they may not all be listed comprehensively in a dictionary or Kosha format. A similar thing happens for example with words for king. All sorts of words which mean men, people, world, earth etc. combine with words like प, पति, पाल, ईश, ईश्वर etc, and as a result you can produce a vast number of words. Such a word-factory aspect to word generation does not mean that all of these words are part of the very basic vocabulary, like the word राज, but all these possible combinations allow poets to pick appropriate combinations to fit the available metrical space and syllabic pattern, or create effects like alliteration, rhyming etc. In that sense, one can possibly make a distinction between some sort of basic vocabulary and extended literary vocabulary. We don't have access to the daily mother tongue usage of Sanskrit from ancient times, and hence it is somewhat of a guess as to which vocabulary is more basic. I have been thinking about this for some time. For instance, when Panini refers to verbs of going, he uses the expression गत्यर्थ. We don't see him using expressions like यात्यर्थ or व्रजत्यर्थ or चलत्यर्थ. Would that probably mean that the verb गच्छति is in some sense part of a more basic vocabulary for Panini? I am wondering about this. Can the meaning entrees in the Dhatupatha be used to detect the basic vocabulary? Perhaps, other scholars on this list can provide their thinking. With best wishes,
