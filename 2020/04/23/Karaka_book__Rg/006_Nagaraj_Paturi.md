Thanks for sharing the link and the book Sri Raghavendra Prasad-ji.

  

I read a message somewhere providing a tool that helps in downloadingthe whole book from shodhganga in one go. I am not able to locate it now.

  

Did you use some such tool or joined all the separate pdfs into one. That's a good amount of work.

  

Thanks again.Regards,
