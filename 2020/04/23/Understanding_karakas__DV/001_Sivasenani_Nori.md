The kaaraka samuddesa of Vakyapadiyam lays out the philosophy of grammar w.r.t Kaarakas.

  

The Bhushana books (the different versions - saara etc.) give a post navya-nyaaya perspective.

  

Vakyapadiya has been translated into English by Prof K.S. Subrahmanian. I remember seeing another translation, by a researcher guided by Prof. Ashok Aklujkar, if I am not wrong.

  

I had not seen English translations of Bhushana saara, much less the bigger versions.
