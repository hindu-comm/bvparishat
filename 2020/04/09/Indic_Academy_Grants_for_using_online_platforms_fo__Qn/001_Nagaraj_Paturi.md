# Zoom Precautions

[](http://sriprabhav.me/author/prabhavp/ "View all posts by Sri Prabhav Paturi")

Many organizations have allowed its staff to work from home to stop the spread of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Online communication platforms such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Teams for Education, Slack, Cisco WebEx etc. are being used for remote meetings and webinars.

Zoom is a popular video conferencing platform. Insecure usage of the platform may allow cyber criminals to access sensitive information such as meeting details and conversations.

Following measures are advised for increasing the security of Zoom meetings and reducing risks

1.  Keep your Zoom software patched and up-to-date. 2.  Always set strong, difficult-to-guess and unique passwords (make
    your password at least eight characters long and use at least three
    of the following types of characters: lowercase letters, uppercase
    letters, numbers, symbols) for all meetings and webinars. This is
    especially recommended for any meetings where sensitive information
    may be discussed. 3.  Enable “Waiting Room” Feature so that the call manager will have a
    better control over participants. All participants can join a
    virtual “Waiting Room”, but they will be approved by call manager to
    be part of the actual meeting. 4.  Disable Join Before Host Feature: The “Join Before Host” option lets
    others to continue with a meeting in the absence of an actual host,
    but with this option enabled, the first person who joins the meeting
    will automatically be made the host and will have full control over
    the meeting. Alternatively, “Scheduling Privilege” may be given to a
    trusted participant to host the meeting in the absence of an actual
    host. 5.  If not required, restrict/disable file transfers. 6.  From settings and controls, ensure removed participants are unable
    to rejoin meetings. 7.  If not required, limit Screen Sharing to the Host only. 8.  Lock the meeting session once all your attendees have joined. 9.  Restrict the call record feature “Allow Record” to trusted
    participants only.
