Respective scholars,  
  
It has been clarified by Shri Ravva Shrihari, an eminent Sanskrit/Telugu scholar that the word "vardhanti" has no grammatical basis; and that it is widely used by all Telugu people (scholars and non-scholars) for the death anniversaries, which is only a misguided practice and has value of "rUDhi".
