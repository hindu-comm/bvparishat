An important point is addressed in this paper. Not only in Buddhism but even in Christianity certain far outliers perceived the need for stage of emptiness. Meister Eckhart said in one of his sermons that God should be known as nothing at all, otherwise one can't know God fully. Those who were prevented by the violence Christian dogma, hinted at the emptiness step poetically. Here's an example:  
  
  
The Forerunners

(George Herbert)  
  
The harbingers are come. See, see their mark:  
  
White is their colour, and behold my head.  
  
But must they have my brain? Must they dispark  
  
Those sparkling notions, which therein were bred?  
  
Must dullness turn me to a clod?  
  
Yet have they left me, Thou art still my God.  
  
  
  
Good men ye be, to leave me my best room,  
  
Ev’n all my heart, and what is lodgèd there:  
  
I pass not, I, what of the rest become,  
  
So Thou art still my God be out of fear.  
  
He will be pleasèd with that ditty:  
  
And if I please him, I write fine and witty.  
  
  
  
Farewell sweet phrases, lovely metaphors.  
  
But will ye leave me thus? When ye before  
  
Of stews and brothels only knew the doors,  
  
Then did I wash you with my tears, and more,  
  
Brought you to church well dressed and clad:  
  
My God must have my best, ev’n all I had.  
  
  
  
Lovely enchanting language, sugar-cane,  
  
Honey of roses, wither wilt thou fly?  
  
Hath some fond lover ’ticed thee to thy bane?  
  
And wilt thou leave the church and love a sty?  
  
Fie, thou wilt soil thy broidered coat,  
  
And hurt thyself, and him that sings the note.  
  
  
  
Let foolish lovers, if they will love dung,  
  
With canvas, not with arras, clothe their shame:  
  
Let folly speak in her own native tongue.  
  
True beauty dwells on high: ours is a flame  
  
But borrowed thence to light us thither.  
  
Beauty and beauteous words should go together.  
  
  
  
Yet if you go, I pass not; take your way:  
  
For Thou art still my God is all that ye  
  
Perhaps with more embellishment can say.  
  
Go, birds of spring: let winter have his fee;  
  
Let a bleak paleness chalk the door,  
  
So all within be livelier than before.  
  
  
After this poem, the very style of Herbert's poetry changed. Example:  
  
The Rose.

  
Press me not to take more pleasure

In this world of sugred lies,

And to use a larger measure

Then my strict, yet welcome size.

  

First, there is no pleasure here:

Colour’d griefs indeed there are,

Blushing woes, that look as cleare

As if they could beautie spare.

  

O if such deceits there be,

Such delights I meant to say;

There are no such things to me,

Who have pass’d my right away.

  

But I will not much oppose

Unto what you now advise:

Onely take this gentle rose,

And therein my answer lies.

  

What is fairer then a rose?

What is sweeter? yet it purgeth.

Purgings enmitie disclose,

Enmitie forbearance urgeth.

  

If then all that worldlings prize

Be contracted to a rose;

Sweetly there indeed it lies,

But it biteth in the close.

  

So this flower doth judge and sentence

Worldly joyes to be a scourge:

For they all produce repentance,

And repentance is a purge.

  

But I health, not physick choose:

Onely though I you oppose,

Say that fairly I refuse,

For my answer is a rose.
