Nice article on Vaastu, and interesting videos. 

  

It is interesting that Shri Kannan-ji mentioned the central courtyard as Brahmasthana. This means that these central courtyards used to be viewed as an important part of the home. Wondering if the Nalukettu type of homes were only a feature of Kerala or if it was pan Indian.

  

I have pleasant memories of not only the Nalukettu that I was born in, but of many others, mostly belonging to relatives. In my Nalukettu, the floor was part wood, part cement and part cow dung smeared. The floor of the place surrounding the inner courtyard, calledtaḷam (തളം), was cement concrete. In the distant past, long before I was born, that must have been cow dung smeared floor but later converted to cement.
However, the kitchen floor remained cow dung smeared well into my memory. All the rooms had wooden floors. There was an aṟa (അറ), a "holy" room where the family deity was installed which also served as a storage room for paddy. Below this aṟa was a nilavaṟa, a sort of storage room where mango and other achar were kept in large ceramic containers called cīna-bharaṇi (ചീന ഭരണി). Much as I liked theaṟa and the nilavaṟa, I used to be rather hesitant to go into those dark rooms as they were also the abodes of palm-sized spiders.

  

My memories of my Nalukettu are not of living in that home, but of visiting it during vacation times and living there just for a few days.
My Nalukettu was sold in my twenties and the buyer tore the home down and sold the wood he got out of it.

  

Nalukettu type of traditional Kerala homes are fast disappearing. Most of such old traditional homes are owned by middle class Hindu families who find that they don't have family members to live in these homes or the funds needed to maintain the homes. Hence the homes get sold for the money much needed by these middle class families. The buyers typically tear down the home, sell the wood and other sellable articles and build several concrete buildings in the land.

  

In the early days of my marriage, my father in law took us to the Azhvancheri Tambrakkal for his blessings. The Tambrakkal are traditionally the head or the guru of the Namboodiri Brahmins of Kerala. Parts of the Azhvancheri "mana" (home of Namboodiris) were quite old while some parts were relatively modern. Here are some pictures of some parts of the mana:
