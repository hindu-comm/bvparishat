Most of the old village houses in Orissa carry a courtyard in the middle.

There would be a well, a small herb garden, Tulsi plant as a shrine

and a fire place for large projects.

In our rental apartment in Cuttack, where I grew up, the construction was

similar.  

In older remote places, the living quarters were set in a circle enclosing

a large open space used for festivals or feasting. Pretty tight structure  

there! The British had hard time to penetrate.
