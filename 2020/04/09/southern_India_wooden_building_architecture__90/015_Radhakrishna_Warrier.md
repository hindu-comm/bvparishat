Out of curiosity, I just dug a little deeper into section 4.7 of the first link provided by Shri Nagaraj-ji to the article on Vaastu. This section describes a method to determine the true east - west alignment.

  

The following figure I drew shows pictorially what the first part of the section describes:

The points where the tip of the shadow of the peg meets the circle in the forenoon and afternoon are A and B respectively. This is the activity of the first day. Next day, the same activity is repeated and further refinements to the measurements are done. I haven't shown the next day's activities. Just joining A and B will give the East-West line with an accuracy that is consistent with the experimental tolerances involved. Actually, the next day's activities are for correcting the small error introduced by the earth's movement along its orbit around the sun in the time between the forenoon and afternoon shadow tip marking. The experimental inaccuracies like the circle not being in a truly horizontal plane and the peg being not truly vertical etc, will more than offset the attempted error correction. Actually one need not even adhere to the dimensions mentioned in the section. Any circle and peg will do, as long as the peg can provide a shadow whose tip will touch the circle preferably a little before mid morning.
