In a discourse, the speaker said: Valmiki did not include the 'stone' curse but it was Kalidasa, in the Raghuvamsha, who said this for the first time. Later, others included this in their versions.

  

Is the above true? Those familiar with the Valmiki Ramayana and Raghuvamsha may please clarify.

  

Thanks.
