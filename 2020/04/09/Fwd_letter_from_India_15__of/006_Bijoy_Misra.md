Madhavji and friends,

I heard last night that lock-down in Odisha would be extended to April 30.

Friends in the US suggest not to travel in the next two weeks.
Massachusetts

seems better, but I am concerned about the travel. The US appears to have

lost direction at this time of crisis.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
