Dear Bijoy Ji,

  

  First, I am glad to know that you are safe and in good health. Good to hear your evaluation of the situation in the US. As a US citizen and a resident of California, let me say that while we have a good-for-nothing president, the burden of leadership has shifted to the governors of the states. The governor of California imposed the Stay-at-Home orders before any other and even within California, it was the counties of the Bay Area that ordered this policy before the state.
As a result, now California has the lowest rate of infections, and California is sending ventilators to New York. The capitalist system in the US profited enormously by shifting most labor intensive manufacturing to China and other countries not only by creating ghost towns in the US manufacturing hubs, it created the inability to respond in a crisis like the current one. It is a shame that the US did not have ready manufacturing capability to produce the most basic needs like masks, gowns, ventilators and medicines. Some companies are now beginning to retool to produce these things, but that will take time.
In the meantime, WE are importing all these things from China, India and other countries, sometimes by threatening them as Trump threatened India, if it did not lift its ban on exporting Hydroxycloroquine. So much for the hugging between Modi and Trump. It is a shame that at this point the number of infections in the US is beyond 400,000 and going up, more than four times the infections in China, where the numbers are now going down and the lockdown is being lifted. But I am sad to say that the US politicians, and Trump at the White House, have no shame or sense of responsibility for the welfare of the people. It is amazing to see the contrast between the US and India. Bijoy Ji, I believe you are safer in India, and I am safer in California as compared to the sad situation in New York. Take care.
