Friends,

Irene Galstian wrote inquiring about my whereabouts.

I am confined here in a spacious apartment in Bhubaneswar.

My sister lives here with a young help. Her husband passed

away last year and children are abroad.

I write a daily mail to my neighbors in my town of Lincoln, US.

I am forwarding the yesterday's mail. Because of internet

difficulties, it has not been easy to be in the net. I spend time

in translating my father's poems to English.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra

  

(People would remember Dr Devanarayan Patnaik. He is in a Boston hospital for a week afflicted with the virus.)

Friends,

  

I started writing this when my complete home confinement

began on March 25 with India's total lockdown. I seelockdown

images from other countries in the world. I learned this morning

that 30% of the Corona cases are in the US, with about 400,000

cases to the world total of 1.4 million. A few people I know have

passed away, my friend lingers in Brigham.

  

While I am optimistic that we will recover from the scare of the virus,

the pre-eminence of the US in the world is possibly lost for the

foreseeable future. An opulent productive economy does not

sustain itself by bluffs and blusters. I learned yesterday that the

US has asked for malaria-cure drugs from India. The trouble is

that the medical care and public health are not whims. It appears

that the US administration has been an assembly of sycophants.

The rescue may not be near.

  

The end of Moghul rule almost had similar parallels. Emperor

Aurangjeb inherited the most splendid economy, glowing cities

and the most productive labor in the world. He found his way

to the throne by killing his three brothers and by imprisoning his

father. He tried to eliminate all the liberal policies that were

instituted by his predecessors to help integrate the country. With

a strong economy, he could manage to be a fanatic and was unable

to notice the effects of his blind faith. With arbitrary punishments,

rebellions occurred and he tried to be more brutal. The Moghul Empire

collapsed after Aurangjeb's death in 1707AD. There could be parallels,

hope not.

  

Early Moghuls helped develop a synthetic India. New strands of

art, music, architecture and dance developed. Artisans produced

magnificent products, the Taj Mahal was built. Poetry, literature

became the norm. Though the taxes were high, the massive

economy could sustain it. Many people were forced out of their

homes to be in the Army, but they were well-supported. I should

add that Aurangjeb killed the social programs through the basis of

religion. Any fanatic becomes lonely and deranged. Aurangjeb

died a pauper.  

  

The early brutality by the Islamic invaders and the continuing Hindu

fundamentalism did give rise to a beautiful new religion called Sikhism

in the 16th century. The teacher Guru Nanak is the only known religious preacher in the world who tilled his own land, cooked food

for his guests and spoke to them only after he fed them. He declared that God is only a name and manifests in service to man. The best service is to remember the God's name all the time and serve

anyone that may come one's way. If you ask what's God's name, his

response was as it comes from your heart. Your sincerity and truthfulness would express God in you. God is one's desire to serve!

  

The Sikhs are a hard-working industrious people, built up by a grounded

culture much older than the formal Sikhism. They form the major segment in the Indian Army and have been in the front-lines in any national calamity. Their population in India is about 2% but their contribution to India's defense and culture is much larger. I read in the Times that the trucking industry in California is now managed by the Sikhs.
Non-discrimination, fellow-feeling and absolute sincerity have been the hallmarks of the Sikhs. There is a western version of Sikhism active in many parts of the US. We have a branch in Massachusetts.

Bijoy Misra (Bhubaneswar, India)
