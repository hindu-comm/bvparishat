Sir

  

Ref post in this group saying TRUMP threatened India

  

///*WE are importing all these things from China, India and other countries, sometimes by threatening them as **Trump threatened India, if it did not lift its ban on exporting** Hydroxycloroquine. **So much for the hugging between Modi and Trump.**////*

  
There are clear reports that say that **Trump did not threaten India** and was only responding to a question by a journalist

  

As a proud citizen of the Indian democracy I do not think another democracy threatened India and I do not think that ( false feeling of threat) is good between two large democracies of the world

  

Merely posted this clarification with Goodwill and love to one and all

  

It is up to the moderators to allow this post or not
