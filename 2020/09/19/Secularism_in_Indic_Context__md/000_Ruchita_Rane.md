Through "Secularism in Indic Context" Prof. Dr. Shrinivas Tilak, after discussing the harmful consequences of the introduction of secularism (an ideology based on alien values) in India's public policy and political discourse, argues for the need to contextualise secularism with Dharma (i.e. general concept of material and metaphysical wellbeing), which is central to all expressions of Indic spiritual, ethico-legal and socio-cultural thought and action encompassing welfare in this (and the other world). Since material and this-worldly welfare is recognised and understood as 'aihik' i.e. secular, Dharma must constitute, it is argued, the central category in any "secular" formulation or vision for ongoing societal process in the Indic context.
