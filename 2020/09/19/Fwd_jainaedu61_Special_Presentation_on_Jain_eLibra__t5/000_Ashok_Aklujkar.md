Many members of this list may find the following information useful.

  

The Jain libraries, personal as well as public, have preserved manuscripts of several texts in theBrahmanical/Vedic tradition that are not found or are lost in their in their original tradition. While it is rare to find a Veda or scriptural Vedic text in Jain libraries, philosophical texts that criticize Brahmanical philosophical texts/views and thereby help in filling the gaps in Brahmanical texts or in the understanding of such texts are not uncommon.

  

The Jain community has proportionately a larger number of wealthy (manufacturers, traders, etc.) dhārmika persons who generously support the community’s monk and a nun members through good maintenance of upāśrayas and grantha-bhāṇḍāras. The work of impressive and broad-minded ascetic scholars such as Jina-vijaya, Puṇya-vijaya and Jambū-vijaya (just to name a few) has instilled a good sense in the community of why scholars and scholarly publications should be supported beyond universities and government established research institutions. Modern technology such as digitization is enthusiastically adopted by the likes ofMuni Padma-sågaraand Ajaya-sāgara. (The preceding statements are based on my experiences in tours of manuscript libraries going back to my 1980s and 1990. For want of time, I will not try to update. It should be clear that, in my view, non-Jain communities have much to learn from the Jain community as far as libraries are concerned.)

Jai Jinendra,



**Special Presentation on Jain eLibrary Project**

Jaina Education will present a one-hour WebEx session on Jain eLibrary website. Jain eLibrary website consists the following types of Jain Literature

Jain eLibrary - A Portal of a Digital Library to Foster Creativity and Free Access to all Knowledge of Jainism

For the first time in history, all the significant philosophical, spiritual, literary, artistic, and scientific works of Jainism can be digitally preserved and made freely available, in every corner of the world, for our education, study, and appreciation of all our future generations.

Existing archives of Jain literature in physical papers have many shortcomings. Many works of Jainism still in existence today are rare, and only accessible to a small population of scholars and collectors at specific geographic locations. A single wanton act of destruction can destroy an entire line of heritage.

Jain literature is predominantly available in Indian languages. It consists of various philosophy, history, arts, traditional medicine, Jyotishka, mantra, rituals and many more

**The presentation will explain the history of eLibrary development, current status and future plan to accommodate photo gallery, audio, video materials. The entire project is run by volunteers except scanning of the books.**
