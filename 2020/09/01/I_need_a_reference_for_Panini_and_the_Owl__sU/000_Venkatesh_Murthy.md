Namo Vidvadbhyah  

  

I remember reading long time back Lord Shiva appeared before Panini in the form of Owl and taught him.

Where in our tradition is this described?

  

Another question is why in Hindi Owl is taken as dull and not intelligent. But in English they say Wise as an Owl? Somewhere the Hindi speakers missed the connection between Owl and intelligence?
