Owl is the animal representation of the Greek goddess of wisdom Athena and hence its reputation in the West as a wise. However, in India, because of its nocturnal activity and screeching call, it has been associated with bad luck and death.

  

By the way, in which purāṇa do we see owlrepresented as the vehicle of Lakshmi? (or the vehicle of elder twin Jeshta-Lakshmi, the goddess of strife and misfortune)?

  

It is interesting to note that owl and ullu are cognates: In fact, Latin ulula & Eng owl appear closer to Hindi's ullu and ulwa than Sanskrit's úlūka.  

  

Regards,

Suresh.
