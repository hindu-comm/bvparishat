Thank you Sir. And thanks for the question which you have raised that is worth pondering about. Bhoja speaks about poets as being "सार्वपारिषदाः", i.e., "belonging to the assembly of all scholars" - poets felt at home in diverse assemblies of scholars since they always had something they could take away home from those assemblies and incorporate in their poems.

Regards

Shankar Rajaraman
