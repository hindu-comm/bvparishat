नमो विद्वत्कविभ्यो रसिकेभ्यश्च

Composed an AryA on Krishna that explicates the value of pi till 40 decimal places. Each letter in the verse stands for a number as understood from the famousकटपयादिसूत्र.

The verse is as follows -

गोपीघटामधुरतमगुणोदधे साधुगीः खगोदूढ ।

चरितावलीबहुल रसधाम निरंहो दृढैकधीसुकृत ॥

"O Ocean (udadhe) of merits (guNa) that is greatly pleasing (madhuratama) to the Gopis aplenty (gopIghaTA)! O, one of virtuous(sAdhu) speech (gIH)! O, one that is borne (udUDha) by a bird (khaga)! O, one who is replete (bahula) with a series (Avalee) of (heroic) exploits (carita)! O, the abode (dhAma) of bliss (rasa)! O, sinless! (niraMho), O, richly endowed (sukRuta) with an unwavering (dRudha) and unique (eka) wisdom (dheeH)"

There exists an anushtubh verse that is on Krishna and explicates the value of pi till 30 decimal points but I felt, that verse (especially from the 2nd pAda) is not easily understandable without a commentary. This verse, on the other hand, makes use of words that are quite familiar and easy to understand.

Given below is the correspondencebetween the letters and numbers

  

गोपीघटामधुरतमगुणोदधे साधुगीः खगोदूढ ।

3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3 5 8 9 7 9 3 2 3 8 4

चरितावलीबहुल रसधाम निरंहो दृढैकधीसुकृत ॥

6 2 6 4 3 3 8 3 2 7 9 5 0 2 8 8 4 1 9 7 1 6
