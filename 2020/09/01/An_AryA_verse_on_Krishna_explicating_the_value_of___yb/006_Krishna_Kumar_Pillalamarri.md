Dhanyavaadaah, Dr. Shankar! Highly impressive.

  

This approach gives me insights into how mathematics, general science, observation of nature, etc., were all combined into a poetic approach inIndian knowledge systems. Compared to this, current education system'sapproach of treating each subject individually is strikingly different. It gives raise to a question: was the idea of 'specialization' pursued at all by our ancestors?
