Namaste,

  

Are there any Vedic kriyas to stop these kind of Disasters. Felt Vedic yagnik rituals might help in reducing forest fires after witnessing Australian forest fires and their helplessness in controlling the spread.

Kalpa bhaga deals with the measurements and muhurta for carrying out Kamya and loka Kalyan rituals as far as I guess.

Every year seshachala forests in Tirumala get affected by fires.

I feel there must be some interdisciplinary branches connected to Vedic rituals and science as microbial studies of usageof panchagavya (specific to covid19 treatment) and controlling there forest fires disasters.

A lot of money and human effort are going in vein by using technology and science, these rituals might not cost and can save environment for future generations.

Sustainable development is primary motto of Vedas and Vedic shastras.
