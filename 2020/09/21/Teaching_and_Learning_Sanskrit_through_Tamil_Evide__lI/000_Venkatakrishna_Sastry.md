I am sharing a file of Giovanni Ciotti



Titled: Teaching and Learning Sanskrit through Tamil Evidence from Manuscripts of the Amarakośa with Tamil Annotations (Studies in Late Manipravalam Literature 2)



The manusripts in the document may be of interst to some .



which has a note by Prof. Aklujkar reading as below:



In this respect, while describing the figure of the paṇḍita, Aklujkar (2001, 45, n. 8) wrote an insightful remark about the relationship between orality and manuscripts: \[…\] an intimate and wide connection with the older Indian way of preserving knowledge,

coupled with an ability to impart that knowledge, is at the core of what paṇḍita means to us. The use of the term in performing arts also points in the same direction. It is based on the elements (a) of study in the presence of a teacher outside the Western-style academic institutions that have become common in South Asia and (b) of oral retention.

The above observation, however, does not imply that pandits do not build personal libraries, do not prepare manuscripts and editions, or do not make a significant contribution to the preservation and deciphering of manuscripts. Their association with reading, writing and printing is also close. Their distinction from ‘Western’ and ‘westernized’ scholars consists in the manner in which they relate to these latter activities.
