Namaste

  

In the commentary to the Taittiriya Upanishad, Swami Vidyaranya cites this passageयक्षगन्घर्वाप्सरोगणसेवितमन्तरिक्षम् while commenting on 'gandharva' and says it is from a shruti. A search on the net for the source did not yield any result.

  

Could anyone kindly help locating the source?

  

Thanks and regards
