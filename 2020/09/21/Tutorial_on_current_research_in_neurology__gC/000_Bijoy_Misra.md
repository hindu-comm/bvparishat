Dear friends,

Good morning.

For many years, we are pursuing to understand human speech from

a neurological point of view. We think speech is a creative process  

than a learning process as accepted in the clinical literature. Speech

experiments are hard, we are first developing a quantitative model.

A background seminar would be offered virtually coming Saturday.

The speaker will be Dr Bela Kosaras, a retired Hungarian neuroanatomist,

earlier with Harvard Medical School. The seminar will be technical and

clinical. I am sharing in case any of you wish to understand this side

of speech science. The seminar is Saturday, Sept 26 at 9:30 AM  

Boston time (7 PM IST). You send mail to [idcin...@gmail.com]() for  

registration. You will receive a Zoom link Thursday,

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
