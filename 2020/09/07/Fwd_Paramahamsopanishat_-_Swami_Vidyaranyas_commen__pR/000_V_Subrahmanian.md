The Paramahamsopanishat, a sannyasopanishat, is available here, in four pages:

In the fifth chapter (विद्वत्संन्यासप्रकरणम्) of the Jivanmukti Viveka, Swami Vidyaranya takes up this Upanishad and writes a complete commentary throughout the chapter. While comparing Swami Vidyaranya's reading with the version given in the link above, it is found that there are very minor variations. The commentary is full of citations from shruti and smriti texts making the study very fulfilling.
