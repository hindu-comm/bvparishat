Apart from our comic verses, the wildfire situation in California is dire. Close to 60 thousand acresof woods were burning in the last two days north of San Francisco and thousands of people had to be evacuated, some in the middle of the night. We are again smelling the smoke in our air and keeping the doors and windows closed.
