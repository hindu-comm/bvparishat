Namaste

Sharing a verse on Goddess काली

  

गाधेतरनयनद्वयविवरव्यावर्तमानविलयसमीरा। मालाकपालपटली यन्नृत्ते घूर्णतीव साव्यात्काली ॥ As the apocalyptic winds revolve round and round in the deep eye sockets, it appears as if the skulls in her garland are dizzy due to her robust dance. May she, Kali, deliver us.

Regards

Shankar Rajaraman
