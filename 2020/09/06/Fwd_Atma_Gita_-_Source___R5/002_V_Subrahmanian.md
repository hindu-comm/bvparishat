Thanks, Shankara ji for the link and information. I found one result<https://archive.org/details/ATMAGEETAYOGVASISHTHA>  where it appears this Gita is a part of the Yoga Vasishtha. Maybe if the book is downloaded, one can search if the Gita is really there and if the shlokas are there.

  

regards

subbu
