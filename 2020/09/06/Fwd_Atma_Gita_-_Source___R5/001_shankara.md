Subbuji,

  

As per New Catalogus Ctalogorum, a mss of Atmagita is there in Thekkematham collection (may be in Kerala).

All the available commentaries on Panchadasi are silent on the identity of Atmagita. Swami Swahananda says it is Atma Purana, but these two verses could not be found in Atma Purana.

regards  
shankara
