One of the questions in the initial note: "What was the word used for Brahmins?"

  

Some other points in the original note that appear related to the above question: "Coming back to the theory that Brahmins came to Kerala only in the 8^(th)century CE, if ancient Tamil classics mention Brahmins and the performance of yajna, Brahmin presence should have been there in the Cēra-Cōẓa-Pāṇḍya cultural sphere of which Kerala was a part.In other words, there should have been Brahmins in Kerala during the time of the composition of the Tamil classics."

  

One of the responses received (by Dr Ramaratnam): "In ancient Tamil literature, the word used to represent brahmins was 'andanar'. One may refer to Tirukkural - andanan enbon aravon'"<https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/6KCSZ-Bo5ag/m/FJstZH7wCgAJ>

  

A subsequent response specified one of the places where a pre-*Cilappatikāram* attestation of '*antaṇar*' can be found:in the*Tolkāppiyam*!<https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/6KCSZ-Bo5ag/m/SHi-U2zxCgAJ>
