\> T.P Mahadevan proposes that they are the descendants of these Sangam age Brahmins who moved west into the region of Malabar during the[Kalabhra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalabhra_dynasty "Kalabhra dynasty")interregnum

  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalabhra_dynasty>

  

According to Kulke and Rothermund, "nothing is known about the origins or tribal affiliations" of the Kalabhras, and their rule is called the "Kalabhra Interregnum"

  

The**Kalabhra dynasty**, also called*Kalabra*,*Kalappirar*,*Kallupura*or*Kalvar*^([\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalabhra_dynasty#cite_note-Bhandarkar1927-2))were rulers of all or parts of Tamil region sometime between the 3rd century and 6th century CE

  

According to Burton Stein, the Kalabhra interregnum may represent a strong bid by non-peasant (tribal) warriors for power over the fertile plains of Tamil region with support from the heterodox Indian religious tradition (Buddhism and Jainism).^([\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalabhra_dynasty#cite_note-Stein1994p76-13))This may have led to persecution of the peasants and urban elites of the Brahmanical religious traditions (Hinduism), who then worked to remove the Kalabhras and retaliated against their persecutors after returning to power.^([\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalabhra_dynasty#cite_note-Stein1994p76-13))In contrast, R.S. Sharma states the opposite theory and considers "Kalabhras as an example for peasant revolt to the state" – with tribal elements, albeit around the 6th century.^([\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalabhra_dynasty#cite_note-Ray2019-14)[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalabhra_dynasty#cite_note-15))All these theories are hampered by the fact that there is a "profound lack of evidence for the events or nature of Kalabhra rule", states Rebecca Darley.^([\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalabhra_dynasty#cite_note-Ray2019-14))
