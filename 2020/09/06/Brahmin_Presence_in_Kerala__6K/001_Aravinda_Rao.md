Such migration seems to have happened in Andhra also. A sect of Brahmins, puduru-dravidas, migrated to the coastal Andhra districts on the request of a local king supposedly to improve standards. This happened about 400 years ago. They maintain their uniqueness even now though there is some mix up with the locals.
