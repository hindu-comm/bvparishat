One can, though, understand why that particular attestation in the*Tolkāppiyam* might be very inconvenient to certain agendas/narratives but I found the context in which it occurs thoroughly fascinating and thought-provoking. For a flavor,P.S. Subrahmaya Sastri’s English translation of the concerned verse is the following:

  

> “The nature of the origin of the air which starts from navel and the > modifications which it undergoes before it comes out as an articulated > sound and of its quantity therein is clearly discussed in the > scriptures of Brahmans.”\[Sastry, 1999 (2nd ed.), p. 15, verse 102\] >
>   

Best,

Megh
