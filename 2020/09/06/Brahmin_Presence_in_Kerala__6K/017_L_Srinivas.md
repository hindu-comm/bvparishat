Keralolpatti is attributed to the 17th century at best. How can it be considered probative for early Brahman settlements in Kerala? It is interesting that Veluthat even quotes Keralolpatti in his chapter on Cellur settlement for which the earliest evidence is only from the Tamil classics. In any case he doesnt cite any hard evidence like an inscription which antedates 11th century. Even in his chapter on the 'Original Settlements', he hardly cites any source before the 10th century. It's all mostly 'Keralolpatti', vague references to traditions esp., Parasurama traditions, 15th/ 16th century Malayalam sources, Namputiri myths etc.  

  

This work by Veluthat, which seems to be an outgrowth of his M Phil thesis, is sometimes cited as \*the\* source on Brahman settlements in Kerala. This author even has a chapter in Staal's Agni. In terms of rigor however, the present work leaves much to be desired.  

  

Hope this helps,
