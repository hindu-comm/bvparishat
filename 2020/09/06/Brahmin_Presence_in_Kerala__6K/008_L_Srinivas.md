Cilappatikāram is a post Classical work. The earliest Tamil anthologies do make references to one or two villages in modern Kerala e.g., cellūr (peruñcellūr aka taliparamba) which later become nucleus of Nampūtiri mana's. They also make reference to Tulunādu in a Vedic context.  

  

Ancient Ceras ruled from Karūr (between Trichy and Coimbatore). They also seem to have had control over central parts of Kerala contiguous with the Palghat Gap. Ancient Pandyas had control over southern parts of Kerala all the way upto at least Kollam. As the West Asian trade increased, there has certainly been more impetus to assert control over the hinterland which produced both pepper and over which trade routes passed. I'm sure a majority of the cotton cloth and wootz steel produced in Kodumanal (a Cera town in Erode dt, Tamilnadu) went out to west Asia thru west coast ports.  

  

The process of brahmins moving thru the Palghat Gap to Central parts of Kerala seems to have been a continuous one throughout written history i.e., from maybe 1st Century BC onward. Clearly it may have been a trickle initially for a long time. Brahmins moving from southern Pandya country also seems to have been fairly continuous since the most ancient times. But both movements were accompanied by military movements clearly to secure trade. In the 8th/9th centuries, both Karur and Mahodayapuram were seats of Cera power. With the rise of the Imperial Colas, Ceras were chased out of Karur and their traditional territory in what's now Tamilnadu.  

  

Likewise, it is also logical to assume that there was migration into northern Kerala from the Tulu country.  

  

But the Kerala brahmins have a vedic branch, gotra and other affiliations that strongly point to cultural and genetic affinities with certain communities of Tamil brahmins, not to Tulu brahmins. Also their i.e., Kerala brahmins' home territory is central and southern Kerala, not northern Kerala. As said earlier, central Kerala is contiguous to the Palghat Gap and ancient Cera country.  

  

Thennilapuram Mahadevan's (TM) work is an Indological work inspired by the Harvard professor, Michael Witzel. He uses classical Indological method - divide the subject into two parts and posit a conflict between the two and see where that takes you - thus, the pūrvaśikhā and aparaśikhā brahmins. There is not historical evidence - literary or inscriptional evidence for Tamil brahmins having been divided into two parts. He also says pūrvaśikhās were the original Tamil Brahmins - I see echoes of the classic who came first (original homeland) theory here!! He also says that the aparaśikhās came later - more Indology for you. There's actually no evidence whatsoever that the Krishna Yajurveda Apastamba sutra affiliated Tamil Brahmins were not there in the earliest period. Besides TM resorts to considerable text torturing to show that most references to the hair of the Brahmins in ancient Tamil texts are indeed references to forelocks.It might also be mentioned that he seems to cite Tamil texts from translations.  

  

It seems reasonable to assume that Brahmins had always been there in Kerala from early historical times i.e., at least 1st century BC. They have a strong affiliation in terms of veda śākhā and gotra markers to certain communities of Tamil brahmins. There might also been ongoing infusions of Brahmins from other parts like Tulunadu and to a much lesser extent, from the antarvedi. There are also cases of Brahmins in later centuries immigrating from northern Tamilnadu and lower Andhra and becoming unrecognizable from Kerala brahmins in due course.  

  

Texts will not give incontrovertible evidence. Archeology might. There's not been a proper study of west Asian trade from the Indian point of view. For example, it's clear that during the times of Vasco Da Gama, the ports which were most active were Kollam, Cochin, Calicut a little to its north and also Cannanore, the seat of the Kolathiri raja. But a few centuries before that i.e., 10th to 14th/15th centuries, Kollam was much more important -this is known from middle Eastern sources. But according to the most ancient Tamil sources, most west Asia trade was conducted from Musiri and the ports in the south coast of Tamilnadu. Archaeology is also bearing this out. Following trade, settlements would have sprouted and Brahmin settlement would have accompanied that.  

  

Inscriptions and archeology might move our knowledge base forward, not some daft Sanskrit texts or Indological analysis. Kerala scholars might also have to use original Tamil sources, since there are no Malayalam sources prior to 825 AD.

  

Hope this helps,
