This is only mildly related, but this talk may be interesting to this thread as the speaker mentions some things about brahmin settlements and migrations in Kerala:

  

Vanishing traditions of Vedic Chanting of Kerala

Many of the terms the speaker introduces seem to be in malayalam not sanskrit, so it would be great if Radhakrishna ji or some of the other members of the group can give a translation or glossary of some of the words, like in the nice summary thread of युक्तिभाषा made by Radhakrishna ji.
