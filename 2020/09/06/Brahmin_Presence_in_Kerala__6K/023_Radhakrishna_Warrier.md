Bandhavi ji,

  

He uses mostly Sanskrit terms. The pure Malayalam terms that I could catch in the video are the following. I am not very knowledgeable on the technicalities of Vedic chanting. So, I have given the most general meaning of the terms.

  

Anyōnyam – competition (of Vedic recital)

Kaṭavallūr Anyōnyam – Competition of Vedic recital held at the main temple in the village of Kadavalloor 

Tāṇṭam (pronounced tāṇḍam) – a padya composed for those studying the Vedas from tāṇṭŭ meaning to cross, to overcome – to cross the ocean of doubt

Paṭṭaru tāṇṭam - Tāṇṭam for Tamil Brahmins

Malayala tāṇṭam - Tāṇṭam for Malayala Brahmins (Namboodiris)

Samhitā tāṇṭam - Tāṇṭam for the Samhita

Muṟa Japam – a satram that used to be conducted by the kings of Travancore at the Padmanabhaswamy temple. Muṟa is the Malayalam equivalent of Sanskrit “krama” meaning an orderly sequence. <http://vsktelangana.org/murajapam-vedic-chanting-rituals-begin-in-sree-padmanabhaswamy-temple>

Muṟa hōmam – a type of homa: Muṟa hōmam at śabarimala Sannidhānam <https://www.facebook.com/sabarimaladevaswom/posts/rig-veda-mura-homam-at-sanndhanam/1600174653577888/>

Vāram – a ritual performed at temples; a term also used for Brāhmaṇa bhōjanam

ōṭṭūttŭ, ūha, ūṣāṇi, koṭṭŭ – all these are associated with different types of Vedic recitals 

Mumpil (pronounced mumbil) irikkal – sit at the front

Kaṭannirikkal (pronounced kaḍannirikkal) – sit closer, sit inside

Valiya kadannirikkal – big “sit closer”

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
