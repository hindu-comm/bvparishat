I have seen people argue in online forums that Brahmins (Namboodiris) came to Kerala only in the 8^(th) century CE. 

Kerala was a part of the Cēra-Cōẓa-Pāṇḍya cultural sphere. I know that Brahmins are mentioned in the Sangam classics. I also know that the performance of yajñas for ancient kings is also mentioned in these classics. Not just that, the Vedas, and stories from itihāsas also find mention in the earliest Tamil literature.

Could someone well versed in ancient Tamil classics explain where (in which works) and in what contexts are these mentioned?Also, are there other words than vēḷvi (வேள்வி) used for yajna and maṟai (மறை) used for Vedas? What was the word used for Brahmins? Was it the tadbhava word pārppāṉ (பார்ப்பான்)?

Coming back to the theory that Brahmins came to Kerala only in the 8^(th) century CE, if ancient Tamil classics mention Brahmins and the performance of yajna, Brahmin presence should have been there in the Cēra-Cōẓa-Pāṇḍya cultural sphere of which Kerala was a part. In other words, there should have been Brahmins in Kerala during the time of the composition of the Tamil classics. Namboodiri Brahmins might have come in the 8^(th) century CE and by their own aitihyas, from Ahicchatra (modern Bareilly district in UP - the same Bareilly of "Jhumkā girā re barelī ke bāzār meṃ”). The original Brahmins of Kerala might have merged, over a period of time, with the more numerous immigrant Namboodiri Brahmins.
