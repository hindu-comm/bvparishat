Brahmin presence in the Tamil country is attested from the[Sangam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangam_period "Sangam period")period onward. Based on the fact that Nambudiris are Pūrvaśikhā Brahmins wearing the traditional hair tuft on the front, T.P Mahadevan proposes that they are the descendants of these Sangam age Brahmins who moved west into the region of Malabar during the[Kalabhra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalabhra_dynasty "Kalabhra dynasty")interregnum.^([\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nambudiri#cite_note-7)[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nambudiri#cite_note-8))This sets them apart from the later Aparaśikhā Brahmin (wearing their hair tufts on the back) migrants to South India such as the Tamil[Iyers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iyer "Iyer"). According to T.P Mahadevan, the Nambudiris brought with them a very early recension of the[Mahabharata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata "Mahabharata")which became the basis of the Malayalam language version of the epic.^([\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nambudiri#cite_note-9)[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nambudiri#cite_note-10))

Anthropologists Heike Moser and Paul Younger note that the Nambudiri Brahmin presence predates the 9th century, as attested by grants of land given to them by ruling families.^([\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nambudiri#cite_note-moseryounger-11))
