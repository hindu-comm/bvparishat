Dear all,  
  
I wrote a month ago mentioning a tool I've been working on, which I said could be used to analyze the meter of whole texts (the Rāmāyaṇa, for example). Fortunately, I was able to give it more time since then, and I'm pleased to say that it's finally in good shape and ready to be used more widely.

  
Access it online here:[skrutable.pythonanywhere.com](http://skrutable.pythonanywhere.com/)  
  
The web app should hopefully be easy to use, even on mobile devices, and it also gives point-and-click access to whole-file analysis. Meter identification was already able to give good detail on such things as anuṣṭubh vipulās and unmetrical pādas, but now it's also able to handle even more difficult cases like triṣṭubh upajātis. As a nice bonus, I was also able to optimize it for speed in a major way, such that where it was taking 20 minutes to finish the Rāmāyaṇa before, now it can do it in just 10 or so seconds(!)  
  
I'm hoping that this tool willcomein handy not only for research but also for helpingstudents learn about and enjoy Sanskrit meter. Please do give it a try and also pass it on. I'm interested tofollow up with people on their experiences with it.  
  
Kind wishes,  
Tyler
