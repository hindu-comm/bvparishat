Dear Mr. Gasuns Ji,

  

A few factors can explain the discrepancies:

  

1\. There are around 100-150 known वार्णिक meters in Sanskrit. They are listed in a book called छन्दोमञ्जरी, among other references. Some meters, such as उपजाति, have different varieties.

2\. There are several known मात्रिक meters in Sanskrit, such as आर्या. But this category is more fluid.

3\. There are several Vedic meters. Some are related to meters in (1). For example, कुसुमविचित्रा is related to गायत्री.

4\. There are numerous Prakrit meters that have been adopted in Sanskrit. Some have both वार्णिक and मात्रिक versions.

5\. There are various meters in regional languages that have been adopted in Sanskrit.

6\. There are meters in foreign languages or other modern meters that have been adopted in Sanskrit. Even I have invented a meter to adopt the Dactylic Hexameter in Sanskrit (षण्मुखमाला चित्रविशाला वीरवधूटी).

  

Most traditional books count 1 and 2 but their enumeration might vary. This would lead to a number around 200. After including all 6 categories with the sub-varieties of each meter, one may exceed 1000.

  

Best,

Kushagra
