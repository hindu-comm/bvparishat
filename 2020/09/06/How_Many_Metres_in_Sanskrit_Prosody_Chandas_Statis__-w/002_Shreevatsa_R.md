It's a question of combinatorics versus aesthetics.

  

Answer 1: Even if you count only metres of the *vṛtta* (*varṇa-vṛtta*) type, and among them only *sama-vṛtta* metres (ones where each of the four*pāda*-shas the same pattern), then there are 2^n metres of *pāda* length n (as there are two possibilities for each position), so adding this up for n=1, 2, ..., 26 (as any longer is called "*daṇḍaka*") gives134217726 metres. That's over 134 million (13 crore). Cut that in half if you think *pāda*-s should end with*guru*. :-) As for giving separate names to all of them, one is only limited by one's patience.

  

Answer 2: The point of putting something in metre is that it should sound pleasant to hear. There are only so many different things that the ear can distinguish, let alone find enjoyable. The higher your standards of aesthetics, the fewer metres you would consider to "really" exist. All the rest are just names given to "weird" patterns: while it is no doubt possible in a language like Sanskrit to compose in any of them, it would be pointless to do so (except as mental exercise or whatever).

  

This is similar to *rāga*-s in classical music, where one can combinatorially imagine similarly dizzying numbers of potential*rāga*-s but only a two-digit number of them are commonor truly enjoyable.

Anyway, to be more concrete, I don't know where Dr Anand Mishra initially got such a large list of (*varṇavṛtta*) metres from. Presumably it is from actual works on prosody where the author(s) bothered to give names to thousands of patterns for some reason. A paper by Ashwini Deo ([this one](http://www.safarmer.com/Indo-Eurasian/skt-meter.pdf)) says:  

  

\> Hundreds of meters are instantiated in classical Sanskrit literature and many more are listed (and illustrated) by traditional metrical texts. The most exhaustive listings of these, modern compilations by Velankar (1949) and Patwardhan (1937) contain more than 600 meters.  

  

The references mentioned are to:

  

\* Patwardhan, M. (1937). Chandoracanā. Bombay: Karnataka Publishing House.  

  

\* Velankar, H. D. (1949). Jayadāman. A Collection of Ancient Texts on Sanskrit Prosody and a Classified List of Sanskrit Meters with an Alphabetical Index. Bombay: Haritoṣamālā.

  

It would be good to look at Mishra's list and find out which ones are not listed in those sources, so that we can at least find the mystery sources of the other metres. Work for someone or some future day.
