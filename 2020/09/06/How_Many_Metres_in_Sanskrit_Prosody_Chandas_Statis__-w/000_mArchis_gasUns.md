Namaste,

  

 Here is what I've seen:

  

<https://github.com/shreevatsa/sanskrit/blob/master/data/vrttaratnakara.json>

based "List of metres from Vrtta-ratnakara" (input by Dr. Dhaval Patel) has 146 metres.

  

<https://github.com/shreevatsa/sanskrit/blob/master/data/mishra.json> has 1348 metres.

  

How many in <http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_7285627_000/pages/ldpd_7285627_000_00001197.html> Apte, Vaman Shivaram, The practical Sanskrit-English dictionary Appendix I have not counted, around 100?  
  
What have I missed?  
  
M.G.
