The virtual infinitude of expression is invariably hinted at sometimes  

with the self-same analogies. We weave an endless tapestry of words  

with but a few alphabets, even as with just over a half dozen notes  

the entirety of music is spun. Says Māgha :  

  

वर्णेः कतिपयैरेव ग्रथितस्य स्वरैरिव ।  

अनन्ता वाङ्मयस्याहो गेयस्येव विचित्रता !॥

  

The *upamāna* ought to be superior to the *upameya*, and the more famous of the two.

So here. Who does not know music? The most elementary lessons in music  

hold a mirror to the primacy of the septad of notes.  

  

As against the same, the 43 (tantrically 50 or 51, or even 64 as per Śambhu-mata) alphabets

of the \[Sanskrit\] language lead to literature which can see no end to its variety. Pitting 7 against  

what is just above two scores - shows the *aucitya* in the choice of the more powerful *upamāna*.  

  

And in the case of metres, the base is not even fixed or fixable as over 40 or even 7.  

(The binary criterion describes and circumscribes but the *varṇa-vr̥tta*-s).  

Practicability and plausibility are the sole criteria for a sensible discernment

and drawing the line for the numerosity of possibilities.

  

And provided, once again, with the possibilities of *sama/ardhasama/viṣama* potentialities,

who on earth can say I have counted the last metre, and so can claim to have uttered the last word?!  

  

Extending the variety of expressions to slightly different realms/strata,

poets and poeticians have thus had to invoke the impossibility that can be posited

even at the hands of Vācaspati (as does Ānandavardhana), or even Sarasvatī (as does Daṇḍin)!

  

And in Tāntric/Āgamic literature, *lipi*-s or *varṇa*-s (sometimes shown as *arṇa*-s)

are said to constitute the exterior (the means of support in meditation),

the mere external frame, of the divinity. *Vāc* is but the body, and the content, *Artha*,

the essence. And Chandas constitutes but the *āvaraṇa* for the frame (*chadir āvaraṇe*),

the most extraneous accoutrement, to wit.

  

\[What infinitude then must the quintessential - the supreme *artha  
*

(identified with Śiva by Kālidāsa and with Viṣṇu in *Viṣṇu-purāṇa*) just *be*!  

What wonder, then, that *kavyānanda* has been shown as but a \[obviously younger\] brother of *brahmāsvāda*

(as said by Viśvanātha) or, even more effectively spelt out, as its *vipruṇ-mātra* (as stated by Abhinavagupta) ?\]
