In today's trail video, we have Smt. Dhanashree Shejwalkar, Senior Research Fellow at Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences at Tilak Maharashtra Vidyapeeth, Pune along with her daughter, Sumukhi Shejwalkar.  
  
Through a dialogue they demonstrate how Amarakosha is an extremely useful tool in the course of language learning in school.  
  
She has recited a few verses from the Brahmavarga in the second kanda of the Amarakosha and has nominated Vinaya Deo ma'am to take this trail further..
