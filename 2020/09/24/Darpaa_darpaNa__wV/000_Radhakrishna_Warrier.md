How old is the Sanskrit word Darpaṇa (दर्पण) meaning mirror? Is the word there in the Vedas? What is the etymology of the word? Did it always have the meaning mirror?

  

There are many ancient sculptures showing ladies holding mirrors.
Wondering what these ancient mirrors were made of. They are unlikely to have been made of glass. I think glass mirrors are a modern innovation. I believe these mirrors would most likely have been polished metal mirrors like the Āṟaṉmuḷa kaṉṉāṭi (ആറന്മുള കണ്ണാടി = mirror of Aranmula). <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aranmula_kannadi>.
Aranmula is a town in Kerala famous for the Pārthasārathi temple and boat race besides the polished metal mirror.
