``` Dear Prof. Asko Parpola,

You rely for your dating on " the mirror was not known in Vedic India until it was introduced to South Asia by the Persian Empire at the end of the sixth century bce."

For this, you seem to rely just on the occurrence of words in texts.

But historians of mirror have said with enough non-textual evidences that high tin bronze mirrors were known in India at least by  1000 BCE. ```

``` Dear Prof. Ask Parpola,

Can we be sure that the authors of Upanishads were so isolated from the India that used mirrors by the time they were authoring those texts?

While we see Dravidian and south Indian linguistic and other elements in various Vedic texts and Sanskrit , can we propose this isolation selectively in the case of these texts?

Another crucial question is how sure can we be of the exhaustive coverage every piece of material culture, floors or fauna of known to a linguistic group in their texts? Can absence of a word be taken as evidence for the absence of the entity indicated by it? ```
