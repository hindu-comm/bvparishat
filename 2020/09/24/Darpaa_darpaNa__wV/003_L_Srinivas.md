The original Tamil word *āṭi* 'mirror' is clearly derived from *adarśa* or more likely from its Prakrit equivalents. There's another word *taṭṭoḷi* used for mirror in early medieval texts like the *tiruppāvai*. That seems to indicate a metallic mirror. *āṭi* is also a metallic mirror, according to the dictionary. In addition, the other synonyms are *ātaricam* (from Pkt *ādarisa*, I think), *tarpaṇam* (from 'darpaṇa'), *kañcaṉam* (from *kaṁsa,* bell metal) and lastly, *paṭimakkalam*, from (loosely) *pratimāpātram*. It does seem like metallic mirrors are indicated in each case.  

  

It's not clear what word for mirror was used in the most ancient strata of Tamil texts. In any case, I'm not sure if there's any reference to glass mirrors in Tamil literature at all.  

  

Hope this helps,
