I am ardent fan of Warrier. He seems to have limitless curiosity and admire the problems he comes out with. I would like to know the etymology of the Tamil word kaNNa:Di itself. It seems to be a compound of kaN ‘eye’ and the noun formed with a:Du ‘to perform’. Similar words are kaiya:Du ‘to handle’ coming from kai ‘hand’ and va:ya:DU ‘to chatter’ derived from va:y ‘mouth’. Based on this I would presume that
kaNNa:Di should mean an instrument that you use to see. We know that the invention of mirrors precedes that of the eyeglasses. So, the meaning of spectacles made of glass was the primary meaning in Tamil for kaNNa:Di and the sense of glass is secondary. If that is the case, then there should be a different term for glass in earlier Tamil. In fact, scholars should be able to find the first use of the terms for glass, modern day mirror and eyeglasses in Tamil and Sanskrit. This would further be supported by any term that was used to denote any mirror like object made of metal in earlier times.
