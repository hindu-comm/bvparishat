"I am ardent fan of Warrier." Thank youShri Jagannathan Ramaswamy. 
There are many things that are very interesting aboutof our Indian languages, culture, arts, history, philosophy and the civilization ancient and present in general. These ignite the natural curiosity within.

  

As Shri LS has explained, the *āṭi*of kaṉṉāṭi could very well be from Sanskrit or Prakrit. But as you indicated,āṭu, with a different etymology, is a very versatile verb. It can mean many things. It can mean shake, swing, oscillate etc., as in "Pendulumāṭum", the pendulum will oscillate. Or perform, as in nṛttam āṭum (will perform dance)
kalaśam āṭum (will perform abhishekam with pots of water) and so on. The adjectiveāṭi, derived fromāṭu, is also very versatile with many meanings. A vāyāṭiis a talkative person (perhaps because her/his mouth moves a lot? 🙂). There are many other interesting words having the adjective "āṭi" as suffix.

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
