Copying here a FB post by Sri Gokula Krishnan Iyer of Srirangam:

  

". . . the brahmanas of the old, enjoying large patronage and support from the Kshatriya Kings, were able to preserve unsullied their alloted duties of Sastric dharmas, . . ." ---Sri Ramananda Sarasvati Swamigal (former Sri G Ramachandra Aiyar) in his book The Hindu Ideal. All the Hindu Maharajas of erstwhile Princely States had been supporting is until their twilight years in the early half of the 20th century.

Donating rare and valuable Sanskrit books from the land of Kashmir to a Vedapathasala in some distant Tamil Nadu is one of the many great sukrtis performed by the Maharaja of Kashmir. Sri Sankaragurukulam of Srirangam (Sringeri Sankara Matham, Srirangam), Trichy District in Tamil Nadu is an institution where Vedas and the Sastras are taught. It was founded by Gurubhakta-shikhamani, Sastraprasarabhushana, Sri TK Balasubramanya Aiyar, a disciple of the Sringeri Shankaracharya, who worked hard to propagate the study of Sanskrit language and the Sastras. In one of the editions (probably between 1940-1946) of 'The Journal of Sri Sankaragurukulam' published by him he expresses his gratitude towards the Kashmir Maharaja for contributing many books published under the Kashmir Sanskrit Series to the Gurukulam's library. He also mentions that some manuscripts found in the Gilgit were also given by the King. The books were mostly of Kashmirika Shaivism. TKB Aiyar expresses great joy at receiving copies of Sri Vidyarnava Tantra, a work concerning the details in Srividyopanasana, written by Sri Vidyaranya Swamigal that were preserved in the King's private collection. Within the two bulky volumes of this book, Sri TKB Aiyar says, are collected all the available authoritative texts from whatever source they might be thus exhausting practically all available literature on Srividya.

All glories to the late Maharaja of Kashmir!
