The above comes very close to the Shaankara Bhashyam for the Prashnopanishat 3.8:

  

The mantra is:

  

आदित्यो ह वै बाह्यः प्राण उदयत्येष ह्येनं चाक्षुषं प्राणमनुगृह्णानः। पृथिव्यां या देवता सैषापुरुषस्यापानमवष्टभ्यान्तरायदाकाशः स समानो वायुर्व्यानः ॥ ८ ॥  

  

Bhashyam:

  

तथा पृथिव्याम् अभिमानिनी या देवता प्रसिद्धा सैषा पुरुषस्य अपानम् अपानवृत्तिम् अवष्टभ्य आकृष्य वशीकृत्याध एवापकर्षणेनानुग्रहं कुर्वती वर्तत इत्यर्थः। What comes next in the bhashya is:अन्यथा हि शरीरं गुरुत्वात्पतेत्सावकाशे वोद्गच्छेत्।

  

Translation by Swami Gambhirananda:Similarly, ya devata prthivyam, the deity that is well known as identified with the earth; sa esa, that very one, exists by vouchsafing favour; avastabhya, by attracting, keeping under control-by the fact of pulling down. apanam purusasya, the vital function called Apana in a human being; this is the idea. For otherwise the body would fall because of its weight or would fly up into the sky if left free.

  

Here is a Hindi translation of the above too:<https://www.upanishads.iitk.ac.in/prasna?language=dv&field_chap_value=3&field_sec_value=1&field_mantra_no_value=8&shtgp=1&scsh=1&setgb=1&choose=1>
