"The radical idea that everything is conscious has a small but growing following in Anglo-American philosophy. How deep are the philosophical roots of panpsychism? And how doolder Indian systems of thought inform modern philosophical ideas?

  

To explore these questions we’re joined on this week’s episode by Chakravarthi Ram-Prasad, Professor of Comparative Religion and Philosophy at Lancaster University who helps us explore the realms of consciousness and experience through the lens of classical Indian philosophy."
