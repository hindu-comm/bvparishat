We are pleased to announce a $16000 grant to an international research group headed by Prof Dr Balagangadhara (Belgium) by INDICA, Inc USA under our Legacy Grants Scheme. The grant is for a period of three years and is intended to help the fundamental research into Indian culture that this group has been conducting during the last three decades. The anticipation is that at least two books, an academic and a non-academic book will be published as result of this research.

Commenting on the development Hari Kiran, Founder said,

â€œS.N.Balagangadhara is alegend. He is without doubt one of the most original thinkers of our times. We consider it an absolute honour to be able to serve him and his group in their seminal research work. We look forward to actively promoting these books once they are published.
