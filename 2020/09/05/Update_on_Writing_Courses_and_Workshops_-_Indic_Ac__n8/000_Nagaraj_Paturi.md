We are pleased to present an update of the writing courses and workshops we have organised or sponsored writers to attend since our inception in 2015.

We believe a change in the narrative begins with a change in narration or writing. We actively encourage public intellectuals to develop a RRR framework â€“ writing that is backed by research, has the rigour of the academia and lastly but most importantly be respectful. Such writing has long lasting impact and read by both sides of the ideological spectrum.

We organise writing workshops and courses as well as sponsor public intellectuals to attend those that are organised by other reputed instructors and institutions.

A summary of all our interventions is given below :
