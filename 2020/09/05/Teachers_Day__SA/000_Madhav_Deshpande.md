On the Teacher's Day, here are two verses from one of my earlier poems on Pune, Puṇyapattanikam:   
  
सा पुण्या नगरी यया चिरतरं बाल्ये सुखं वर्धित:  
   दीपस्तम्भसमैरनेकगुरुभिर्यत्नैश्चिरं शिक्षित: ।  
यत्रानेकसुहृद्वरै: सह मया सख्यं समासादितम्  
   दूरस्थोऽपि न विस्मरामि नगरीं तां पुण्यनाम्नीमहम् ॥१०॥  
  
     "That is the City of Pune that raised me for long in happiness, where I was trained for long with great effort by teachers who were my guiding lights, and where I found great friendship with many wonderful friends. I cannot forget that City of Pune, even though I am far away from it."  
  
नेत्रे निमील्य गच्छामि मानसीं तां पुरीमहम् ।  
    यस्यां मे गुरवोऽद्यापि मूर्तिमन्त: समासते ॥२९॥  
With my eyes closed, I go to that city in my mind where my teachers are alive even today in a manifest form.
