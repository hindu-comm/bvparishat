I don't want to add this political discussion about US politics. Butthis was the worst presidential debate I have seen in my life. Trump says either he will win or will unleash anarchy on the nation. This is what the American democracy has come down to. Feel very sad. See the NYT article of Thomas Friedman: <https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/opinion/trump-election-fraud-2020.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage>
