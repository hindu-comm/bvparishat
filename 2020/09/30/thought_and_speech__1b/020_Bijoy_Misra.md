Dear Dr. Rao,

These are old books.  

If you are into the topic, please think about how thought may become a neural activity in the brain,

particularly to understand भाव as a neurological activity eventually affecting our physiology.  

Prof Korada's posts have been very useful and I am studying further..

I agree the topic is extremely interdisciplinary. I posted the MIT press article

to help create awareness. Such research should happen in India by the new doctoral students.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
