Prof Korada,

  

I admire your analysis in 2 below. I loved it.  

Our argument follows Bhartrhari, that शब्द is an acoustic signature of the object that is recognized by us

through our innate nature. It has an auditory perception component and no language component.

We convert this perceived signal through our local grammar if we wish to communicate.

The information gets stored as natural semantics, like a dog's bark would help recall the visual of a specimen of dog from its class.

  

In your analysis in 1, I think we have to distinguish between the universality of चैतन्यम् versus the localization of the sensation संज्ञा

चैतन्यम् would relate to प्रज्ञा of योग, which is most likely an inert state. That analysis would be more with cosmology with an extension of साङ्ख्य..

  

You may comment.  

  

Our focus is to develop a speech model further through 2. There are a lot of intermediary steps to create a syllable. We are struggling.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
