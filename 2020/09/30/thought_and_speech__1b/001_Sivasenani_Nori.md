It is a very interesting article, Prof. Misra. Thank you for sharing this.

  

While it is easy to say that this confirms what we find in Paniniya siksha, Bhartrihari etc. about production of Sabda (vivakshaa is the starting point) and tantalising information about yogyata (if each sound or thought has a particular wave - form, then is there an innate yogyata between Sabda nad Artha at the level of physical or biological map?), it is important that we do work like this, or get inspired to do this kind of work, to prove or disprove what our Sastras say.

  

Regards
