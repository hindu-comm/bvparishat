Dear Prof Korada,

The medical analysis below would classify चैतन्य as "sensation",

In this way it can be termed physical, like people losing the

sense of smell through coronavirus. But the inception of

thought in मन may not be confined in the body, since it can

easily be perceived that मन is not "contained" in the body.

Please help if sources exist to explain this dichotomy.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
