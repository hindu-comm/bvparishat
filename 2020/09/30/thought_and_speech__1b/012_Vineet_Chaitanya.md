If you believe in Adwait Vedanta then चैतन्य cannot be accessed by any physical means whatsoever!

(If I am not mistaken then all Vedanta schools will agree on this point.)

At most we may be able to go upto पश्यन्ति level.

Moreover चैतन्य is neither कर्त्ता nor भोक्ता according to Adwait school.

Language cannot describe it and intellect cannot understand it.

So atmost it can only be pointed out by अध्यारोप-अपवाद method.
