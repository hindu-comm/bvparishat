Dear Dr. Mishra,

Thanks for sharing an interesting article. In some ways some of the ideas are similar to what I used to discuss with Dr. Francis Crick, a Nobel prize winner, here at the Salk Institute—he had become interested in understanding consciousness. And we agree to disagree in our lunch time discussions whether mind (not even consciousness) is a product of chemical reactions in the brain or it is not but a receiver and mind has its own entity.

I agree that this is an important area of investigations that requires development of new tools and has a lot of translational potential.

Best regards,

Vipin K Chaturvedi
