Namaste





1. The paper is a good read. It raises a number of issues to contemplate.



2. The snippet in the article reading below needs deeper deliberation on the concpetualization of ' Vak' before jumping to the ' modeling of Vak as para-pashyanti, madhyamaa' from the plank of 'Vaikhari.

*We know that language can also be present in the absence of sound, when we read or when we use words while thinking.*



3. The science community thoughts on ' Consciousness' in ' Brain Science' and ' Science of Language/ Linguistics' are miles different and deviated ,away and apart from the 'traditional models of understanding ' vak'. So far, I have not been able to figure out the Medical science models for the abstraction of ' Indriyas', ' Chitta-Chaitanya, Prana' so frequently and unquestionably consumed in traditional schools to explain the phenomenon of ' Vak- Vakya- Bhashaa:: language-science ( Bhashaa - vijnana). Bhartruhari's technicality of ' Vak' in 'Vakya-padeeya' can not be arbitrarily short mapped to ' brain science - material chemistry processes'.



4. I am of the opinion that the traditional schools need a better and thorough understanding of the neuro-science and brain science : Concepts, models and measures ( Which are physical , real and tangible) in relation to the abstract ideations derived through ' translations'.
The fundamental premise and postulates about 'body-brain-life science' ( Shareera - Rachanaa prakriyaa -shaastra) in traditions of
Ayurveda and Yoga need an ab initio mapping to the western science model of ' Body- Brain chemistry'.





5. Look forward for more details from the learned.
