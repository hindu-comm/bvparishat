Dear Misraji,

  

One needs to appreciate that though a mother gives birth to a baby the first breath that the baby takes blows चैतन्य into the body of the child. The mother is only responsible insofar as she delivers the physical body. But that is not enough. It is the first breath of the child that injects life into it. The question is who prompts the child to take its first breath?

  

And see the beauty. That which comes first to the child as a living creature is the last to go before the body turns into a corpse.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
