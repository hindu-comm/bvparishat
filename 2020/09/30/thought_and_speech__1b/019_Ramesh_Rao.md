The quest to find a particular part of the brain that registers something, receives something, stores something, moves something, triggers something, and alters something is good as far as it goes in terms of enabling medical science to intervene in finding certain cures and corrections for a faulty, distressed, diseased brain. The brain itself is very malleable and can change what it stores where, what part can do what, and so on -- neuroplasticity -- on which there is a well-written popular book:

VS Ramachandran's fascinating work on phantom pain, and Oliver Sacks' works also refer to these matters:

But conflating the science that seeks to understand brain functions with metaphysical inquiry is yet another example of scientism.

  

But there is "work" involved in this that keeps a lot of people and institutions going/humming/prospering/thriving :-)

  

Sohum...
