My suggestion is leave out any talk about परा and चैतन्य!

But we may hope to go upto पश्यन्ति.

In my opinion it is at the "deep semantic level" decopled from language specifics words, syntax and constructions..

Interested person may look at UCCA (<https://github.com/UniversalConceptualCognitiveAnnotation/>)

It is a crude first attempt in the Right direction and needs to be enriched by पाणिनि's आर्थी-पक्ष related

सूत्र in my opinion.  

Neuro-physicists must hunt in which part of brain this knid of information is stored.  

Regards
