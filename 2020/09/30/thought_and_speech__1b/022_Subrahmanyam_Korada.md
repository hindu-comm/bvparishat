नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

  

1. चैतन्यम् as defined would be different in different structures making it local, than universal. This could be a contradiction.  

  

Notice one thing --

  

The term चैतन्यम् , if employed in the sense of जीवशक्ति , will be there in humans , flora and fauna and the same is referred to by **Panini -- चित्तवति नित्यम् (5-1-89),**

**अचित्तहस्तिधेनोष्ठक् (4-2-46) --- here चित् means जीवशक्ति (life) .**

  

Mountains , dry wood , dead body etc and those which do / can not move
spontaneously or not able to feel pain etc are अचित्तवन्तः (without चैतन्यम्) .

  

Sometimes a part of a structure -- the leg of a person suffering from **मधुमेह ( Diabetes Mellitus ) may lose स्पर्शज्ञानम् / चैतन्यम् ।**

  

Since you take each entity as a single unit , following your विवक्षा (a desire to say) you may take it as ' local '.

  

The other side of the picture --

  

You follow 'आत्माद्वैतदर्शनम् ’ -- what is the cause **(उपादानकारणम् and निमित्तकारणम् )** of the universe - as it is illogical even to think that **' something would emerge from nothing'**- then the answer will be चैतन्यम् - a synonym of ब्रह्मन् ।

  

**सर्वं खलु इदं ब्रह्म (छान्दोग्योपनिषत् , 3-14-1) -- ’ सर्वस्य चेतनावत्त्वात् ’ (वार्तिकम् ) , ’अथ वा सर्वं चेतनावत् ’ ( महाभाष्यम्) -- ’ धातोः कर्मणः समानकर्तृकादिच्छायां वा ’ पा 3-1-7 --- the entire universe is** **ब्रह्मन् / चेतनावत् ।**

In this case if you select the universe as a single unit then it will be ' universal ' and if you treat each unit in the universe as a single entity then there will be 'local' .

   

2. An extension in my mind would be that चैतन्यम् is a property of the universe as any other attribute like gravity or creativity.

 It can manifest in different ways locally. Like we don't know the universe well, we do not know what चैतन्यम् is, but we

 know that it exists and supports us. Its scope could be larger than our awareness, as yoga would enunciate.

  

Is it in the right direction of analysis? We are looking for understanding speech and to simulate a quantitative model.

  

---Yes - with some विवक्षा (not in सिद्धान्त ) you may consider चैतन्यम् as a गुण (in सिद्धान्त it is द्रव्यम् - व्याकरणम् ) that is available in different ' things ' ( for example जीवात्मा )

and its real existence can be known by a योगी / ब्रह्मज्ञानी ।

  

It is the same चैतन्यम् that , through stimulation , helps in the production and pronunciation of शब्द ।

  

Before that we have strong evidence to show that the child had had **शब्दभावना --**

  

इतिकर्तव्यता लोके सर्वा शब्दव्यपाश्रया ।

यां पूर्वाहितसंस्कारो बालो’पि प्रतिपद्यते ॥      **वाक्यपदीयम् , ब्रह्मकाण्डः , 121**

  

In the universe the 'इतिकर्तव्यता’ ( the imagination that a work has to be done like this ) , which even a child / boy , due to his पूर्वजन्मसंस्कार , is able to grasp ,

is based on शब्द ।

  

Even the so called Motor Responses of a child are preceded by शब्दभावना ।

  

आद्यः करणविन्यासः प्राणस्योर्ध्वं समीरणम् ।

स्थानानामभिघातश्च न विना शब्दभावनाम् ॥ .... **122**

  

The first movement of speech organs , the upward stimulation of breath and its contact with centers of articulation -- these developments would not be possible

but for the verbal imagination (of the child ) .

By nature air travels horizontally and in spite of that the child tries to push the प्राणवायु upwards and also passes the same through speech-centers .

  

**Thought and Speech** --

  

न सो’स्ति प्रत्ययो लोके यः शब्दानुगमादृते ।

अनुविद्धमिव ज्ञानं सर्वं शब्देन भासते ॥ ..... **123**

  

In the world no thought / ज्ञानम् is possible except as accompanied by शब्द । All kinds of thought / knowledge (प्रत्यक्षम् , अनुमानम् , शाब्दम् etc) is manifested as permeated

by शब्द ।
