Prof Korada,

This is another beautiful post.

I have two observations:  

  

1. चैतन्यम् as defined would be different in different structures making it local, than universal. This could be a contradiction.  

  

2. An extension in my mind would be that चैतन्यम् is a property of the universe as any other attribute like gravity or creativity.

 It can manifest in different ways locally. Like we don't know the universe well, we do not know what चैतन्यम् is, but we

 know that it exists and supports us. Its scope could be larger than our awareness, as yoga would enunciate.

  

Is it in the right direction of analysis? We are looking for understanding speech and to simulate a quantitative model.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
