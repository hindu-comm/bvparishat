Dear friends,

  

From time to time, I have requested here for people to go into more

analytic examination of the indian scholars' empirical findings. The

most important among these, in my opinion, is the origin of thought

in mind and its conversion to speech. The western linguistic research

literature has been rooted to the acoustics of speech rather than the  

inception of speech. People who may be scientifically oriented and

have some understanding of Indian views, may appreciate the following

posting from MIT today.
