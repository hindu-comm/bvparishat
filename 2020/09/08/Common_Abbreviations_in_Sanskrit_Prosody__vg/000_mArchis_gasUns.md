Namaste,

  

In my Russian edition of Bhartrihari I want to give abbreviations of metres, but would not want to invent new ones, if there are some common ones around.

ār\[yā\] (69), indra\[vajrā\] (28), upaci\[trā\] (?), upa\[jāti\] (28),

gī\[ti\] (70), do\[dhaka\] (27), dru\[tavilambita\] (33), pu\[ṣpitāgrā\] (?),

pṛ\[thvī\] (44), ma\[ndākrāntā\] (47), mā\[linī\] (40), ra\[thoddhatā\]

(27), vaṃ\[śastha\] (32), vasa\[ntatilakā\] (35), viyo\[ginī\] (69),

śār\[dūlavikrīḍitam\] (56), śā\[linī\] (25), śi\[khariṇī\] (49), ślo\[ka\]

(19), sra\[gdharā\] (67), har\[iṇī\] (45).

  

That's what I have for now. \[\] contains the full form. Should I used with endings, I guess?

  

M.
