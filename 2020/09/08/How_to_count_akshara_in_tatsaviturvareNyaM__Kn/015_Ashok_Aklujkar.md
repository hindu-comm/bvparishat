The following two publications should help in the present context:

  

[**Rig Veda : a metrically restored text with an introduction and notes**](https://www.worldcat.org/title/rig-veda-a-metrically-restored-text-with-an-introduction-and-notes/oclc/479024731&referer=brief_results)

by Barend A van Nooten; Gary B Holland;Harvard Oriental Series.Publ. by the Department of Sanskrit and Indian Studies, Harvard University,Cambridge, Mass. USA.1994.

Thomson, Karen and Jonathan Slocum, eds. 2006. [The Rigveda: Metrically Restored Text](http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/RV/). A corrected version of the preceding.Linguistics Research Center, The University of Texas at Austin.

I do not know if either is available as an electronic text.
