Which is the right order ?

  

The mantra had वरेणियं from the beginning and we are viewing it as a metrically suitable version of वरेण्यं ?

  

or

  

The mantra should ideally have had वरेण्यं and we are reading it as
वरेणियं for a correct count of syllables as per the meter and such a reading as per the requirements of meters is 'sanctioned' by the shaastra ?

  

My view is that the former is the right approach.

  

Not just in the case of Veda mantras and not just because of the sacred attitude.

  

When you collect folk songs too, you collect them as they are sung. When you see 'ungrammatical' elongations, shortenings etc., you would look for the grammatically correct versions of them and see them as the musically/metrically adjusted variants of the grammatically correct versions.

  

But nevertheless, the 'ungrammatical' elongated, shortened etc., versions are the naturally, originally born versions and hence the 'right' versions.
