Namaste  
  
The invocation of 'Pingala Chandas Shastra/ sutra with Halayudha  
commentary' makes the discussion more complicated and deeper. More  
questions to explore open up.  
The questions are like : Which of the 'Gayatri' and as what ' Structure,  
text as given letters, akshara - division' is being taken as reference in  
the debate ?  
To justify which reading as valid as against the other one ? Why invoke  
Panini for the Sandhi split rule, where Pingala looks for ' Filler (  
Poorana) ?  
How one justifies the rule base invoking \< प्रातिशाख्य के नियमानुसार ….  
एक अक्षर नया जोड़ कर …. बनाया जाया है, \> ? A meddling with the mantra  
structure - split and usage ??  
  
I place below some snippets from Pingala's chandas shastra with halayudha  
commentary. My understanding is that more research is needed to educate and  
understand the right use of 'Gayatri'- as a vedic technical structure, with  
given letters, split and clustering of akshara segements ( by pairs,  
triads, quintuplets…), the laghu-guru classification, the svara marking,  
and a host of other factors like devataa. Simplistic and partial  
justifications open up room for more confusion.  
  
The snippets placed below seem to justify the usage \< वरेण्यं and  
वरेणियम् \> in very specific contexts as explained in Pingala's commentary  
. The change in application and meaning may have a similar, equally complex  
' traditional debate and final verdict for a practice' in Vyakarana and  
Nirukta. We have not touched these disciplines in their totality. The  
floating popular view that ' Gayatri mantra' is universal and can be  
chanted/ sung/ used in a free for all manner is not justified by any text  
of tradition. The traditional stand is ' Get the required Samskara and use  
gayatri mantra properly to get the benefit' . The name of the samskara is '  
upa-nayana'. The 100 -level intro training is learning correct phonation  
(Shikshaa- Chandas) before going to grammar and semantics (Vyakarana -  
Nirukta).  
  
The application of Gaaytri with this right backdrop yields the right '  
parihara- phala' sought by the user, more specifically in vedanga Jyotisha.  
This is the VINIYOGA ( as Dr. Yadu has said in many earlier posts;  
VINIYOGA term is a part of the traditional declarations before Gayatri  
mantra and pooja/ japa : Jape viniyogah'. Many seem to have inappropriately  
substituted the 'Yoga sutra technicality of ' tajjapah tadartha-bhaavanam',  
poorly ransalted as' understanding the meaning of the mantra ! Additional  
justification for inappropriate action is drawn from Nirukta : yadadheetam  
AVIJNAATAM, nigadenaiva shabdyate. The karma-yoga techniclity of the three  
terms -\< viniyogah'.- tadartha-bhaavanam', -AVIJNAATAM> are diferent and  
distinct.  
  
  
The start with ' general over view, this thread started on how to count  
'aksharas' which needed deeper thinking, especially for Vedas. The  
opening of this post contained a statement : \< आप वर्णविच्छेद  
\<<https://www.rbsesolutions.com/solutions-for-class-6-sanskrit-vyaakaran-varn>  
-vichaar/> करके स्वरों की संख्या गिन सकते हैं। वही अक्षरसंख्या है। \> The \<  

वर्णविच्छेद  

\<<https://www.rbsesolutions.com/solutions-for-class-6-sanskrit-vyaakaran-varn>  
-vichaar/> \> got us to the point of \< वरेण्यं and वरेणियम् meaning \> .  
The issue of \< मूल संहितापाठ… अष्टाक्षर पाद बनाने के लिए, प्रातिशाख्य के  
नियमानुसार…. एक अक्षर नया जोड़ कर …. बनाया जाया है, = उस तरह से उच्चारण  

किया जाता है । ऐसी अक्षर बढाने की प्रवृत्ति को, प्रातिशाख्य में "व्यूह "  

संज्ञा दी गई है \|\>. The technicality of \< व्यूह \> was explained as \<  

व्यूह करके ( = इको यणचि । सूत्र से प्राप्त होने वाली सन्धि में, जहाँ  
संयुक्ताक्षर में यकार अथवा वकार सुनाई दे वहाँ, ) इय एवं उव - जैसा उच्चारण  
करके, पाद को अष्टाक्षर बनाया जाता है । \>  
  

This got connected to Pingalas Chandas sutra 3.20 \< invoking the rule : 3.20  
snippet below.  
<https://archive.org/details/ChhandaSutra-Pingala/page/n36/mode/1up>  
  
Here came the difficulty , in understanding and applying the rule to the  
context.  
  
  
  
  
This rule applies to ' paada' of ' gayatri' as the third section adhikaara  
reads. Thus in third chapter of Pingala, Gayatri- paada means eight  
aksharas.  
  
The rule seems to provide a POORANA (=FILLER) SVARA/ AKSHARA in  
between at a specific point. The split of ण्यं -- to णियम् is step wise:  
  
  
Rule Application:  
\[( ण्)+( यं) \] -- \[ ( ण्)- पूरण स्वर ( इ) + यं/यम् ) \] \[ णि +  
( यम् / यं ) \] \[ Vasant kumar bhats explanation is illustrated here. This  
modification is in one special text of gayatri.  
I did not what prevents the तु in सवितुर् not to be affected by  
the same rule ?! The mantra would have become \[ तत्सवि- तव----  
र्वरेण्यं \] and still retain the 8 letters rule \]  
  
  
Any rule in Pingala's Chandas shaastra refers to ' Akshara-count'.  
  
  
The general tag of ' GAYATRI gets more specific classifications in Pingala .  
The classifcation basis is explained :  
  
  
  
  
  
The Commentator explains ' GAYATRI variations from ' One letter to  
several letters, with illustrations . Pingala is not the only source to  
explain the diversity of chandas in veda mantras :  
  
The several names of Gayatri and its variants are : एकाक्षरं छन्दो गायत्रीति  
संज्ञायते .... आसुरीगायत्री प ञ्च दशाक्षरा ....प्राजापत्या गायत्री  
अष्ट्टाक्षरा भवति ...यजुषां गायत्री षडक्षरा भवति ...... द्विः-कृता  
द्विगुणिता षट्-संख्या साम्नां गायत्री इतित् संज्ञायते ......त्रिगुणिता  
षट्-सम्ख्या ऋचां गायत्री भवति । यत्र कवचित् वेदे अष्टादशाक्षरं छन्दः तत्  
ऋचां गायत्रीति संज्ञायते .. साम्नां, ऋचां, प्राजापत्यं, दैवी, याजुषी,  
आसुरी, ब्राह्मी गायत्री,  
  
  
  
  
  
I hope this helps to deliberate more deeply on ' Gayatri' and all other  
Chandas as well as Veda mantras .
