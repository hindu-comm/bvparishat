Dear Sri Ashish Sharma-ji,

  

There is no difference in meaning between वरेण्यं and वरेणियम् .

  

Rishis did not **WRITE** any of the mantras.

  

Veda mantras have been oral right from their origin.

  

They have been metrical in their origin.

  

The metrical regularity in them is by / from their birth.

  

So the वरेणियम् version is part of the mantra right from its origin and has been preserved all through in the tradition of its recitation from the guru to sishya and his sishya and so forth.

  

 वरेण्यं version is reconstructed by those who looked for the grammatically correct version from this metrically correct natural original version.

  

They provided an explanation for why sometimes the metrically correct versions are different from the grammatically correct versions.

  

That is the explanation mentioned by Prof. Vasantkumar Bhatt.
