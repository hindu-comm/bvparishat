Namaste Ashish Sharma



I am responding to your question in two parts. First part is from Classical langauge position. Second is from Vedanga Jyotisha position.



**Classical langauge position**: The conceptualization of 'AKSHARA' for ' articulation ( uccharana)' - is not dependnet upon the scripting mode.



The \< वरेण्यं and वरेणियम् \> difference carries articulation place and effort differences ( sthana-prayatna of ' VARNA- AKSHARA SAMYOGA/ AANUPOORVI' ) .



Different splits- differing results is the simple logic and insight. Wave graphs will be different for both. This has a pointer to the right teaching - learning- use of Gaayatri mantra per veda.

**ण्यं = (ण् + य् + अनुस्वार ) = मूर्धानुनासिक व्यञ्जन + अन्तस्थ व्यञ्जन + अनुनासिक व्यञ्जन transformed to अनुस्वार = एकाक्षर - ( गुरु अक्षर) **

****

****

**णि-य-म् = ( ण् + इ + य + म् ) = मूर्धानुनासिक व्यञ्जन + तालु स्वर** **+ अन्तस्थ व्यञ्जन + अर्धाक्षर ओष्ठ अनुनासिक व्यञ्जन = अक्षर द्वय or सार्ध-अक्षर-द्वय (लघु- गुरु अक्षर )**

****



I hope that this detailing helps you to see the difference: ( I have not elaborated on Swara and Kaala- bala - samyoga -devataa - part, speed of pronunciaiton called ' gati', level of ' japa'-pronunciation called
loud- soft/ upaamshu - maanasa . These details are public knowledge in practicing tradition for over a millennia ; and are part of Samskruth Vyakarana studies in ' Vaidika -Sandhya- vidhi/ training and practice'. 

This entirety is technically called ' Maitra- upaasanaa':: (simply) tri-kaala sandhyaavandanam'.

The importance of this is explained by Manu: : **कुर्यात्- अन्यत्- न - वा - कुर्यात्, मैत्रो ब्राह्मण उच्यते . Each of the gaayatri mantras in practice as मानव- गायत्री , विश्वामित्र गायत्री, देवता-विशिष्ट गायत्री are different. (**Detailing on this is not needed at this point.)



The same mantra occuring in two different vedas with different applications -context invoke different langauge- context sensitive phonation and articulation related praatishaakhya rules. 



To learn the details of these, for practice and application, one needs a
full theory and practical discourse on' Shikhsaa and Pratishaakhya
of each veda and prayoga -difference' . That is learning the theory and practice of the phonation of sounds and sequences as prescribed for ' Chandas' and ' Bhashaa' parts. Scripting is an important necessary part of document; but not sufficient.



This part of ' Oral and Practical Traditional knowledge' has sufferend a great deal in the past three centuries due to several reasons. One of the main reasons being dismemberment of 'Yoga' part of Samskrutham, known as ' Vak-yoga' in Vedas. The agencies responsible for this dismemberment are the educational institution syllabus makers themselves.



In the current mode, Panini studies have taken approach of ' historic langauge -study model' than the real traditional guidance as ' Muni-Traya Sampradaya with anchor to srimad Bhagavad-gita - Vak-yoga sampradaya'. The technical definition of Muni comes from Gita:
**मुनिर्मोक्ष-परायणः ( यतेन्द्रियमनोबुद्धिर्मुनिर्मोक्षपरायण: \| विगतेच्छाभयक्रोधो य: सदा मुक्त एव स: \|\|५-२८\|\| ) . Therefore, Munitraya sampradaya needs to be understood as 'Moksha parayana- (Yoga) Traya sampradaya'. **

****

The contribution of 'Astrologers and ayurveda practitioners' is no less in making this damage to ' Veda and Samskruth studies'. Assessing this damage and setting a course correction for this is a different issue , which can not be detailed on a public forum exchange of views.



**Vedanga Jyotisha position**: I am responding on this second part as I notice your signature line reading \< OSD to the President Indian Council of Astrological Sciences > . If in the tradiiton, as Prof. B.V. Raman said, Jytoisha and Vastu are in reality ' Vedanga / Upa-Vedanga', the veda -mantras provide the 'parihara':: remedial solutions for human problems. The two versions of gayatri mantra \< वरेण्यं and वरेणियम् \> have different ' parihara- phala', as they belong to different vedas and different aplication modes. The apparent split in script is not due to scripting convention. It is not even slackness of pronunciation, regional difference, deviant pronunciation
( = Desha- Vaktru - kaala - uccharana bheda/ dosha ).



 It is a specificity of ' Articualtion for Meditation to delvier a 'phala- parihara'. In the current period, the teaching and practitioners of ' Jyotish' seem to carry fancy ideas of ' Graha-chaara related Phala- Parihara' . Much of the prevelant practice of yajna-vidhi, mantra parihara prescription and consumer practice needs a tremendous clean up for langauge and yoga-science part of it.



This dimension of 'Vednaga Jyotisha' is known only to some of the senior members, in your central body. This area is a very special Vedanga Jyotisha related research and can not be elaborated in detail on a
public forum post like this.



Suffice it to say, the question you have asked has \< Deep Insights, linked to the right understanding and practice of ' Jyotisha ( Astrology) as ' Vedanga- Jyotisha' ( Veda- Yoga Science of Divine , the TIME -Yoga :: Kaala-Yoga). The applications relate to the right diagnostics using D-20 chart and identification of right ' Graha-Devataa- Mantra Gayatri for the four Purusharthas, linking it to the dasha-bhukti-antara up to Sookshma- Prana dasha. The ' AKSHARAS/
BEEJA-AKSHARAS ' of Mantra have ' Devataa association' and ' PRAANA- YOGA' association. The split of \< वरेण्यं and वरेणियम् \> splits the 'Devataa - Prana - yoga'. The out come will be different.



In this sense, Doctor and Jyotishi both have to depend upon the ' TRUST' of the ' SEEKER- Client'. It is a call for responsible and respectable practice of Vedanga Jyotisha. 

If a doctor advises/ administers wrong medicine, using wrong diagnostics, the health of patient gets affected.

Similalry ,if Vedanga Jyotishi advises/ administers wrong Mantra/ Prayoga, using wrong and non-vedic/ non-yogic diagnostics, the ' Swasthya- Saukhya:: health and wellness, the KARMA of patient gets affected. There are social and spiritual consequences.



Veda is called ' MANTRA '. Veda is realized and adminsitered through YOGA. The Langauge of Mantra , Veda, Yoga is called SAMSKRUTHAM. The vedic name of Samskrutham is VAK-YOGA.

In this sense, VEDNAGA JYOTISHA means 'MANTRA- ANGA - JYOTISHA/ YOGA- ANGA - JYOTISHA/ SAMSKRUTHA- ANGA JYOTISHA.



The right adminsitration of 'MANTRAS' is through right use and split of AKSHARAS . 

The JYOTISHI need training in YOGA-SAMSKRUTHAM for use of 'Samskrutham as VAK-Yoga. Different splits- differing results is the simple logic and insight.



If interested , for more information. please write privately. At least some of the members on your board know me in person and my views on the need to upgrade Jyotish to 'Vedanga Jyotish' studies.
