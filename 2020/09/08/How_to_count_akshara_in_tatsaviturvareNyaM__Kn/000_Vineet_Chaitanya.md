I have no background in छन्दशास्त्र, so kindly excuse me for a very elementary question:  

How to count "akshara" in तत्सवितुर्वरेण्यं? Should I first break it as:

तत् सवितु: वरेण्यं?

I have practically not much background in Sanskrit. So you may direct me to some English or Hindi online source.

Regards
