Dear Learned Scholars

  

I have a small confusion and hence request you all to clear that too:

1\. वरेण्यं and वरेणियम् has same meaning or different?

2\. In other 2 ashtapada, it has been written in 8 aksharas then why first pada, rishi has written in 7 aksharas? They have written in 7 aksharas while speaking, we are using 8 aksharas. Why they followed this style? Any insight behind this system?

  

Waiting for your answer.

Best Regards
