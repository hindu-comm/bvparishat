Namaste





I made a simple table, as below, to see how would this mantra -akshara classification by scripting, saying and transliteration models. 



The ' akshara- count' traditionally refers to ' varna- akshara -svara' combine' as basis for classification.( This accounts for the time , elongation:: maatraa -kaala, accents).



The script based ' akshara classification is helpful to identify the
units -sequence needed for pronunciaiton; but may need a different template to calculate the 'akshara -count/ word -letter unit count'.

Still contemplating on the implication of this analysis .
