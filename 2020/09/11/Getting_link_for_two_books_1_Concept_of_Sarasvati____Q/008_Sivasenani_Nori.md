My deepest condolences, Sri Sinha. The grief of losing an offspring is so cruel. May God give you the strength to bear it.

  

I remember Ms. Sinha as a very earnest and diligent researcher with an old-fashioned sense of propriety and a seemingly unquenchable thirst for books in Alankara Sastra. Though I personally never responded, i did follow (as many would have done) her progress, visible from the nature of her requests. A budding life and career coming to an end even as it was just blossoming is very sad. May she attain uttama gati.

  

Narayana, Narayana.
