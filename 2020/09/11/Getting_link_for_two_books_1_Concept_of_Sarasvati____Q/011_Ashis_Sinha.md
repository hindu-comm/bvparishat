Respected Shankaraji,

     I am deeply indebted to you and S. Noori ji, Prabhuji, Gudsoor A. G. ji and all others who expressed their heartiest condolence on hearing the sad news of my daughter's sudden demise. I pray to God to keepyou all well. I am now 69 years old and suffering from different ailments like high blood sugar. I don't know what future is awaiting me. Good bye to you all.



                                   
                                   
      With regards,

  

                                   
                                   
      Ashis Sinha.
