Namaste,

  

There is 'Tulsidas Aur Unka Yug' by Rajapati Dikshit published in 1953.

<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.479675>

  

When you post a new query, please do it in a new thread so that scholars who are experts and who are interested in that topic would see it. I am not aware of the current status of research on Tulsidas's life and times. I am sure, other scholars in this group will help you in this regard.  

  

regards  
shankara
