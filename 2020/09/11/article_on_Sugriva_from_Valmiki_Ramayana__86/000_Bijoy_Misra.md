Dear friends,

  

I am sharing an article I did on my series on Valmiki. Being abroad,

my outreach goal has been to the young adults to orient them to

literature and to analysis. Here I talk about Sugriva and help analyze

friendship as I understand from Valmiki. The eventual aim of Valmiki

to help teach concepts through literature and storytelling should

be explored with further analysis in the future.   

  

Here is the article.

Other articles in the series are archived at the same location.

  

Best regards,
