Hare Krishna.  
  
Respected Vidvaj-janas,  
  
Snatakas were of three types:  
Vrata-snataka  
Vidya-snataka  
Vrata-vidya-snataka.  
  
Of these, the vrata snatakas, when they become grihastha, what  
occupation was he engaged in? He would not be engaged in teaching  
works because he has not passed that. Then what other things he could  
do?  
  
Similar question could be for vidya-snataka.  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
