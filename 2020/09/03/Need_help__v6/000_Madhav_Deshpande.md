I have joined a Marathi group here in the Bay Area that plans to read Jñāneśvara's Amr̥tānubhava. The very first verse salutes Nivr̥ttinātha as his Guru. I have tried to locate compositions of Nivr̥ttinātha himself, without any success so far. I would appreciate any help on sources, and also on the connection of Nivr̥ttinātha to the Nātha tradition, and the connection of the Nātha tradition to Kashmiri Shavism. With best wishes,
