Dear Prof Deshpande,

I recollected one more source for your need.

1\. There is Samaadhi of Nivrutti Nath at Trimbakeshwar, just half a mile after the main Jyotirlinga Temple. Just near the gate of the Samaadhi temple, there are two bookshops which sell literature related to Nivrutti Nath. You will get your needed books there. I bought one related to his biography in 2016.

  

2\. I have read long back that while traveling from Alandi to Paithan to get “Shuddhipatra”, the four siblings were separated from one another in a jungle due to a stong wind. Nivrutti was found by GahiniNath who was doing penance and he stayed there for some period; there he received दीक्षा of नाथ-संप्रदाय. Pl moderate my inf if necessary.

  

3\. I am aware that I am not able to provide you any pdf docu which is a present trend. I am hopeful that you may get more inf from some of our BVP scholars.  Very recently, Dr Shankar has provided one pdf docu on Waman Pandit’s ‘Geeta Treatise’ and two yrs ago, Dr Nagaraj Paturi has provided me a pdf docu on Tukaram’s special Abhangas.

  

I wrote above with a sincere interest to be of some help to you. With warm Regards,

-Ashok Gudsoorkar
