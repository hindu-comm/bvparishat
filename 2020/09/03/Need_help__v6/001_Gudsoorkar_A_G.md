Dear Prof Deshpande,

1\. There is a book compiled by Gurudev R D Ranade,‘संतवचनामृत’.

It contains many Abhangas of diff Marathi saints. There is one chapter-“Abhangas of Nivrutti, Jnanadev, Sopan etc.” This Ch contains 50 Abhangas of Nivrutti. I had this book, but donated to Library in my n.place before leaving Hyd. The book is available for sale in Gurudev’s Ashram in Nimbal, Dist Bijapur.

  

2\. There is meaning and Nirupan of these Abhangas in English (no Abhangas) in his book-“Pathways to God in Marathi literature”, published by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan in Mumbai in 1961. You can get this.

  

3\. The Guruparampara, as I read is- Adinath, Machhindra, Gorakhpur, Gahini, Nivrutti, Janna, Sopan, Mukta, Changadev.

  

4\. I have read ‘Amrutanubhava’ twice. Couldn’t grasp. Pl help me.
