Dear Ashok Ji,

  

  Some 300+ gathas of Nivr̥ttinātha have been published as part of a collection titled Sakala-Santa-Gatha. Some of my friends have mentioned this, and I am hoping that someone will send me a pdf. Currently, I am reading the Amr̥tānubhava of Jñāneśvara with a few other friends here in the Bay Area. Jñāneśvara offers salutations to his brother/guru Nivr̥ttinātha at the beginning of this work, and the work contains some sort of synthesis of Kashmir Shaivism and Śāṅkara Advaita. With best regards,
