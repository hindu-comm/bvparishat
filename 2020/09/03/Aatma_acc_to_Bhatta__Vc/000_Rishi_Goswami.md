Namo Haraye

Namami vidushah

  

I read all SV Aatmavad 149 Karikas of Bhatta and also Sri Korada Shastriji's 10 pg summary of them.

  

In a specific Karika he says the Cognizer Aatma can be of these 1. Vijnana (like baudhas) 2. Its Ashraya (like vaisheshikas) 3. Puman.

Who Is the Puman?  

  

He counters body, Prana or vital force, sukshma deha of Sankhyas, Vijnanavada of bauddhas etc.

  

He says it is not Jnana and also says ज्ञानशक्तिस्वरूपोSतो नित्यः सर्वगतः पुमान्

  

Now I think he is differentiating between Jad knowledge which isn't self aware with Chaitanya which is self-cognizable. Because he supports Brihadaranyak in end.

  

This Chaitanya differs from Vedantis because it can be modified, it is not free from Vikriya or modifications. Still the Nityatva is unharmed.

  

Or there can be a Bhedabhed relationship between Jnana and its Aasray where Atma is Jnanarupa as well as its Dharmin. Like is made of sunlight so sun is sunlight as well as its Dharmin.

The main issue with this is Akshayyam ha vai....sukrtam.

  

Who goes to heaven? Who is the Bhokta? Unless you accept a body like Sankhyas how without Manas will Aatma enjoy Sukha?

  

\_\_\_

The third doubt is about its Vibhutva. Is it Vibhu like Gagan or Vibhu in the sense it fills up the entire body.

If its Vibhu like Gagan, then how does one differentiate between my soul and your soul as he justifies uages like my soul in couple of karikas? Hence i think it is not like Gagan.

Rishi
