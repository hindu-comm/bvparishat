Kushagra-ji

  

There has been some discussion on this before. The complete translation of taittirIya brAhmaNa is not available. Chapters 2.1, 2.6, 2.8 and the entire 3rd aShTakam were translated into English by Paul Emile Dumont and are available. Sri David Reigle had compiled these and provided a link to the pdf.
