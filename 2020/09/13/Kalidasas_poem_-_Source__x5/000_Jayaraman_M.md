Dear Scholars  

  

Namaste  

  

Given below is a poem. It is attributed to Mahakavi Kalidasa (versified English translation).  

It is widely shared in various websites. I tried to locate its source in Samskrita. I could not. I seek your inputs.  

  

*Look to This Day*



Look to this day

for it is life,

the very life of life.

In its brief course lie all

the realities and truths of existence,

the joy of growth,

the splendour of action,

the glory of power.

*For yesterday is but a memory,*

*and tomorrow is only a vision.*

*But today, well lived*

*makes every yesterday a memory of happiness,*

*and every tomorrow a vision of hope.*

*Look well, therefore, to this day.*

*  
*
