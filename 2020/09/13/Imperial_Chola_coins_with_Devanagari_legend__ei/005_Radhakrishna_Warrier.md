I notice that in these old manuscripts, the Devanagari top-bar is not a continuous line for each word as in modern Devanagari. Each character of a word has its own top-bar and there is a small gap between these top bars.

  

In handwriting, individual top-bar for each letter takes more time for writing compared to a continuous top-bar for each word.

  

Are there any old manuscripts with continuous top-bar for each word?
When did the practice of drawing a continuous top-bar for each word begin? And when did the practice of drawing the top-bar develop? Brahmi and south Indian scripts do not have top-bars.

  

Among the Indic scripts for Indo-Aryan languages, I think only Gujarati and Oriya do not have the top-bar. If you look close enough into the circular arcs surrounding the letters (the so called "jalebi") you can see small Devanagari characters in most Oriya letters: ଦେଵନାଗରୀ. It would appear that the arc is in place of the top bar. In the case of Gujarati, it is almost all Devanagari without the top bar: દેવનાગરી.
