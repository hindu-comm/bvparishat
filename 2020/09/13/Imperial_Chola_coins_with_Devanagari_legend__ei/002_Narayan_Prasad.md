\<\< The "ko" (को) and the “co” (चो), even though Devanagari, seem to be written in the Bengali / Malayalam / Tamil fashion with the “e” symbol to the left of the consonant and the “a” symbol to the right of the consonant as shown below:>\>

  

During 12th-13th centuries, in the Devanagari script also theएकार मात्रा was given this way only. For example, pl. refer to Plate XXVII (13th century) in "\[Ojha G H\] The Palaeography Of India (Hindi)-1918".
