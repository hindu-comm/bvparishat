I saw the following picture of the imperial Chola coins in a Facebook post:

  

  

  

  

  

What is interesting is that the Tamil Chola kings issued coins with Devanagari legend.

  

I tried to read the legend. It appears that what is written is:

गंगै कोण्ड चोल  (Gaṅgai koṇḍa cola) .

  

The term in Tamil means the Cola who conquered the Ganga. The "ko" (को) and the “co” (चो), even though Devanagari, seem to be written in the Bengali / Malayalam / Tamil fashion with the “e” symbol to the left of the consonant and the “a” symbol to the right of the consonant as shown below:

  

কো চো കൊ ചൊ கொ சொ

  

The gai (गै) seems to be in the Bengali fashion with the “e” symbol on the left of the consonant and a top diacritic line to make it “ai” as shown: গৈ. 

  

Cola (चोल) or Coḷa (चोळ) is the form used in Sanskrit and other languages for the Tamil Cōẓa (சோழ).

  

The only problem was the conjunct letterण्ड. I just guessed it.
