Dear All Learned Scholars

  

I am trying to find source of following two Shlokas:

  

1\. श्रीकान्तो मातुलो यस्य जननी सर्वमंगला।

जनकः शंकरो देवः तम् वन्दे कुंजराननम्॥

  

Someone has mentioned in one of the forum that this shloka has been written by Ved Vyaas as the invocation shloka for the Navagraha Stotra but I have checked Sanskritdocuments.org and unable to find it. That person has even mentioned about book named as Jaya Mangala Stotras but still unable to find a proper source.

Please give the correct source if its other than the above source.

  

2\. असाध्य साधक स्वामिन्

असाध्यं तव किं वद \|

राम दूत कृपासिन्धो

मत्कार्यं साधय प्रभो \|\|

  

I heard from someone that Kanchi Parmacharya Ji used to share this shloka with devotees. No authentic source available with me.

  

Please guide me to share the source of above shlokas.

  

Pranaam
