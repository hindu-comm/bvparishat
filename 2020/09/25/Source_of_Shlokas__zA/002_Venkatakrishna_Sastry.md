Namaste



Regarding second sloka : Source - Usage :



 असाध्य साधक स्वामिन् - असाध्यं तव किं वद \| राम दूत कृपासिन्धो मत्कार्यं साधय प्रभो \|\| ---- I heard from someone that Kanchi Parmacharya Ji used to share this shloka with devotees.

**No authentic source available with me**.



One may explore more with the schoalrs like Dr. Vamshikrishna Ghanapathi, at Mysore, associated with Sri Ganapathy Sacchidananda Swamy Ashram, where Hanuman worship resources are likely to be available.
