The following is a request from Indology list, to which I responded that I would request her to share a copy:

  

Dear list,

  

I would be very grateful if someone could share a pdf of Saroja Bhate's book*Pāṇini's Taddhita Rules*. I have been trying to find a hard copy to buy, but it seems impossible.

  

Many thanks and best wishes,

Aleix
