Hariom,

  

 Is something missing out? What should be the order or of no importance?

  

What letter is a guru and what letter is a laghu-

1.  All hrasvas are *laghu*s- The hrasva vowels are the short
    monophthongs: 'a', 'i', 'u', 'ṛ' and 'ḷ'. A syllable is *laghu* only
    if its vowel is **hrasva** ("short") (and followed by at most one
    consonant before another vowel is encountered.) 2.  All dīrghas("long vowels") are *guru*s. All other vowels are dirgha:
    'ā', 'ī', 'ū', 'ṝ') 3.  A syllable with an
    [*anusvara*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anusvara) ('ṃ') or a
    [*visarga*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visarga) ('ḥ') is always
    *guru*. 4.  E, O, Ai, Au are *guru*s.('e', 'ai', 'o' and 'au'. -Note that,
    morphologically, the last four vowels are actually the diphthongs
    'ai', 'āi', 'au' and 'āu', as the rules of sandhi in Sanskrit make
    clear.) 5.  A*hrasva* vowel when followed by a consonant cluster, i.e a
    saṃyuktākṣarais a guru. 6.  A saṃyuktākṣara when hrasva is a *laghu*and when dīrgha is a *guru*. 7.  GangadasaPandita states that the last syllable in each pāda may be
    considered **guru**, but a **guru** at the end of a pāda is never
    counted as **laghu**.

For measurement by mātrā (morae), laghu syllables count as one unit, and guru syllables as two units.
