Dear Vidwans,

  

The main reason for the survival of Sanskrit are :

  

1) The shisthas of Sanskrit did not live in isolation and mingled with the masses. This might have helped in enriching local or regional languages. Of course these shishtas engaged in performing rituals which brought the language they spoke social recognition. There is a reference to this in the Mahabhashya - the brothers यर्वन तर्वन used to corrupt words which speaking with commoners but would not do so in Yadnya. This brought status to the Sanskrit Language.

  

2) Sanskrit is not a foreign language to this land. One cannot overlook the fact that though as languages each Indian language is different from the other and so also different from Sanskrit yet at the letter level they share a common pool of letters. This has helped Sanskrit from not becoming a dead language. Do we see this vis-a-vis Latin or Greek. Is the morpheme pool of all European Languages the same? The more unfortunate part of European Languages is that instead of sharing a common morpheme pool they share a common script. It is exactly the opposite with India. Indian Languages share a common letter pool with different scripts.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
