I concur with the sentiments expressed in this thread. It's clearly sad when classical/ancient languages are neglected for want of funds.  

  

Regardless, I find it odd that Indian public money is sometimes pledged to foreign universities for language studies or for special chairs. Government of Tamilnadu pledged Rs 10 Cr - not a trivial sum by any means - towards establishing a Tamil Chair at Harvard University. I never understood what ordinary public in TN would get out of this chair.
