While as a person who appreciates languages, I feel a little bad about this, I don't know if I really feel too bad about these happenings quite frankly speaking. All these institutions were founded by imperialist powers to further their ambitions. Let's study the languages, new and old of a country, so that we can loot them in the most efficient way possible, that was indeed the purpose of all these Western institutions. That's why these departments were financed to begin with. Entire Western museums are but a small testament to these people proudly displaying their loot and many times used to educate in a "scientific" way, the rude natives of their own culture, even to this date. Even the Sanskritist Ingalls was originally employed by the OSS (the precursor to the CIA). While a good percentage of these people may have been personally good (I have no idea either way), they were but cogs in the wheel for efficient looting or furthering the foreign policies of their countries. There was/is also the nexus between these people and the conversion mafia. The conversion mafia, at least in the USA, is hardly educated (and that's an understatement) and really don't need any knowledge to promote their agenda. They peddle miracles and cures, not texts and exegesis. Perhaps the people in many of these institutions were very conveniently blind to the fact about how their "studies" were being used, or where/why their funding was coming from, but those are the facts. Now that this kind of wholescale direct looting cannot happen any more, and conversion can happen more directly, the money to these kinds of language and religious studies have evaporated. Now more money is going into areas where there is more money to be made. You can see these in so-called ivy league humanities schools in the US where many centers of "studies" are set up with money from dictatorial regimes and lectures will be given on democracy to actual democracies like India. Typically these will have fancy names like laboratory for democracy, smart government and other such neo-liberal (\*) garbage.You will see many top government officials spending a year or two to boost their resume and then go out and further the cause via working in "think tanks", consulting firms etc., - no need for complicated language studies. They will also invite compliant natives and use them as props at convenient times. Entire new humanities disciplines have sprung up to give respect to what is but enabling of whole-scale looting, that's the bottomline.

  

I agree with Kushagra-ji on how Indians should approach Sanskrit.

\*neo-liberal = new fancy term for looter/intellectual garb of the process of looting as exemplified by "The Economist" and such, and has nothing to do with twitterati consider to be "left wing" and "right wing". Both left and right economists in the US and elsewhere are mostly neo-liberal, their only fight is whether the loot obtained from poorer countries should be more or less equitably shared among the citizens of their own countries.
