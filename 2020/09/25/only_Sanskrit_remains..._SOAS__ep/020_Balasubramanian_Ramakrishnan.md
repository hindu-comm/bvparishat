Dear Prof. Deshpande,

  

Here are some thoughts on this subject:

  

1\. It is certainly true that Whitney was an outstanding scholar. In a few decades it will be 200 years since he published his studies and they are still very worthwhile consulting even if not accepted wholeheartedly. That's a testament to his scholarship. While it's certainly true that he may have studied it only as an intellectual pursuit, the same cannot be said of European scholars of that age and their successors later. Many of them were evangelists and in later decades Nazis as well. It's just that India and proselytization were not in the radar of the white Americans those days, they were more directly interested in mass genocide of Native Americans and subjugation of African Americans.

  

2\. Coming to the last century and more recent times, we have an example of an ivy league professor from UPenn using prestigious publishing venues such as the SUNY press to defend the writings of a Nazi evangelist. Why should the writings of a Nazi evangelist, who got kudos from the Nazi pope Ratzinger, on non-christian cultures have any validity at all? Best relegated to the dustbin. Would anyone other than an idiot defend the writings of a KKK grand wizard in African American studies? The sad state of affairs is that these people are quoted to this day as "experts" on Hinduism, as I saw in the last WSC. This is current USA South Asian/Sanskrit studies.

  

3\. How about all the religious studies departments aligned with theological schools? The biggest con job is what they call "interfaith dialogs". Has any Muslim or Christian person changed their mind based on this? The Indic religions have no issue here. Based on a common principle of vAda, not only have there been conversions within Vedic schools but also between that not non-vedic schools such as Buddhism and Jainism. Judaism is a bit different, there are more "broad-minded" trends within that religion. The fact that many of these folks study Sanskrit and claim to provide "unbiased" views of Hinduism is just hogwash. Again this is the state in the US as of today.

  

4\. Other than very small domains like vyAkaraNa, most of the US academics have no problems commenting on politics in India, issues in India etc. So what is it to say that their views are not coloring their study of Sanskrit, especially when it comes to issues like what Hindu texts say about tolerance or the history of a particular temple etc.?

  

5\. Given the fact that you agree with Prof. Paturi, would you agree in general Hindi, Persian, Bangla, Urdu and Arabic studies in the US universities are merely an adjunct of the US government and primarily to assert American hegemony? Do professors in these departments project themselves as unbiased scholars or merely adjuncts of the CIA or state department or whatever? I am afraid they project themselves as unbiased scholars. What would you or Western academia say if let's say Sri Narendra Modi set up 10 chairs for studying these languages in JNU to promote the views of the Indian government? Honest question here.

  

Ramakrishnan
