Dear Prof. Deshpande,

  

I asked you about comparable programs from Government of India because you said "It is clear to me that every government in the world has its national interests as part of their educational policies, and neither India nor US are exceptions to this. "

  

But you saying twice in the thread that the article on 1962 Indo-China war mentioning about a lack of such program on the Indian side and you expressing hope that situation could have improved on the Indian side shows that you are fort similar / comparable programs on the Indian side.

  

This also shows that you are against those who talk and campaign against Indian government's policies on Yoga, Ayurveda etc., serving Indian national interests.

I agree with you also with regard to the need to separate the motivations on the part of the students and scholars and the funding governmental and non governmental bodies. I always think that sometimes the funded researcher may not even be aware of the strategy/motivations of the funding agency behind funding.

  

But it can not be generalised that the motives of all the students and scholars studying languages foreign to them are not political. 'Political' does not always mean the ideas of the governments or political parties running for the governments in their countries. In Social Sciences and Humanities in those countries, it is very much common for studies being oriented towards political and social ideologies centered around their own ideas of social justice and human rights etc. Most of these philosophies /ideologies oppose the ideas of nations, national, nationalism etc. This is what makes them view the love of the mother tongue speakers towards their language as 'nationalistic' 'chauvenistic' etc. and talk against the mother tongue speaker's love towards that mother tongue. Not just mother tongue, there are heritage classical languages loved by different nations as their common classical heritage. Greek and Latin are such common classical heritage for all the European nations. Sanskrit is such common classical heritage for the speakers of all the Indic languages. Calling Sanskrit 'toxic' 'dead' etc. is also motivated by such clearly political ideologies only. Indians who have been thinking that foreign scholars studying Sanskrit and Indian languages do so out of love and admiration for these languages are shocked to know such views of these scholars towards their mother tongue and heritage languages. They may wrongly conflate the national motivations of the foreign governments and these political motivations of these scholars. But nevertheless what is common is their shock to know that the love and admiration that they think as the motivations for the study of their languages is not true.
