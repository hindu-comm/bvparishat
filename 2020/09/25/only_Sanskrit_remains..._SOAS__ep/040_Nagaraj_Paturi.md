Dear Prof. Deshpande,

  

\> When I read your comment "This also shows that you are against those who talk and campaign against Indian government's policies on Yoga, Ayurveda etc., serving Indian national interests." I see that you are reading something far deeper into my words. I am not for or against any policies of the government of India, and I have not participated in any political movements in India.

  

------ In fact, you are trying to find some deeper meanings from my post. I did not say YOU are for or against any policies of the government of India, or YOU participated in any political movements in India. I was pointing my finger at certain western scholars who made open remarks against the work of Government of India to promote Yoga and Ayurveda. When you said that governments having their national interests in mind is natural and justified, I said that such a view implies that the work of scholars who made open remarks against the work of Government of India to promote Yoga and Ayurveda is not justifiable. So I was plainly and directly saying that in consonance with your view
that governments having their national interests in mind is natural and justified, you must be taking the position that the work of scholars who made open remarks against the work of Government of India to promote Yoga and Ayurveda is not justifiable.

  

\>I also know that the governments of China, Korea and Japan were financially supporting the study of their languages and cultures at the University of Michigan and at many other universities, and they obviously had their own national interests.

  

--- These are not at all comparable to the programs of funding studying /teaching foreign languages in one's own country for defense/security/intelligensepurposes. A program in China, Korea or Japan to study languages foreign to those countries being funded by the governments of their countries would have been comparable. A program in India to study languages foreign to India being funded by the government of India also would have been comparable.

  

\>My account of the 1962 India-China war is entirely based on the reports of Captain Belvalkar, and I cannot say much more than that. I don't know if the Indian government today does or does not support foreign language teaching from the point of defence concerns. I hope it does.

  

--- This shows that you are not against, moreover you are in favour of
A program in India to study languages foreign to India being funded by the government of India for defense/security/intelligence purposes.

  

But I do not know of such programs.

  

But here in this thread, the focus is on the actual motives of funding the study of Indian languages being other than love and admiration for these languages.
