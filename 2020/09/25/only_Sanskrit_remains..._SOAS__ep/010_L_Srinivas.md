In Latin, there's been a steady battle between the old and new pronunciation. One of the differences between these two have been the pronunciation of the 'c' sound. The new pronunciation would restore it to its classical hard sound whereas the old pronunciation was the soft one. Thus for Cicero, it was 'sisero' vs 'kikero'. This is even captured in a famous English movie, 'Goodbye Mr Chips' where a Latin teacher Mr Chipping is pulled up for teaching the old pronunciation.

Among various experts, the contribution of one i.e., W Sydney Allen thru his work, *Vox Latina,* in restoring the correct Latin pronunciation is acknowledged by most Latin textbooks these days. Allen's also the author of the rather influential *Phonetics in Ancient India*.  

  

Hope this helps,
