Dear Shri Ramakrishnan Ji,

  

  I don't know why I am made to answer all these questions, as if I am defending something or other. It is clear to me that every government in the world has its national interests as part of their educational policies, and neither India nor US are exceptions to this.
Clearly, the American government's support for the teaching of critical foreign languages is motivated by their defence concerns. However, while the US government supports the study of these modern languages, no such support is available for the study of classical languages.
Secondly, while the US government supports the teaching of languages, the advanced study of literature, philosophies, ancient histories etc. does not have any such government support. If you know anything about the US universities, the basic teaching of modern languages is done by the lecturers who are not expected to doresearch work, while the professorial rank faculty is evaluated on their research contributions.
When it comes to languages, religions, philosophies etc., in most of the cases the research areas have hardly anything to do with concerns of the US government. Are there some individual scholars who may have pro-Nazi, or pro some religious interests? Indeed, such individuals exist, but you can also read critiques of such individuals and their work coming from other western scholars. I have not noticed any topic where all western scholars are in completeagreement. You can read the vocal disagreements between Cardona, Rocher, Staal and Kiparsky. In this respect, I see a similar diversity of opinions about everything within India. It is not the case that all Indian scholars agree on all subjects, because they are all Indians. Traditional scholars also have their sectarian affiliations. The Dvaitins don't accept the views of the Advaitins. I personally believe that one is not obligated to accept the conclusions of any scholar, western or Indian, just because they are western or Indian, but one has the obligation of rationally judging their research and developing an opinion of those conclusions for oneself. That is what I have done personally in my own research work. Being western or Indian by itself is not a deciding factor for me. I have agreed and disagreed with scholars irrespective of whether they are western or Indian.
