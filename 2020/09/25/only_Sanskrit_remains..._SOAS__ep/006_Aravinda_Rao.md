What could be the reason for this ' amaratva' ( changeless ness/ minimal change) of this one langauge ' brahmi- bhaarati' from this land of Yoga ?

  

I think that an important reason is that it is the medium of all rituals. Anywhere in the world if you go to a Hindu temple,

the priest would chant purusha suktam, or rudram or some such set of mantras. Hindu families anywhere in the world would

read Lakshmi stotram, Ganesha stotram, or Saraswati stotram. People who tell pravachanams, read out passages from the

Sanskrit texts and explain them.

In short, Sanskrit is linked to our punyam, heaven or moksham. We chant the sahasra namas whether we know the meaning

or not. I do not know whether Latin is similarly linked to punyam in the same way.
