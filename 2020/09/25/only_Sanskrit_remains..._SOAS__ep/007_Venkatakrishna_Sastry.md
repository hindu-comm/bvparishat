Namaste



Thanks to Prof. Aravinda Rao and Aniket for brooding over the question : ' amaratva of deva-bhashaa' aka Samskrutham/ Sanskrit . Here are my extended thoughts, submitted for further deliberation and reitrating the need for a better reasoning to defend ' amaratva of Samskrutham'.



1. **Sanskrit studies at University** **and Gurukul** : The perspectives provided for 'Samskruth - Langauge Study :
Conceptualization by Purpose and support for implementation differs
at Guru-Kul and

University. 

The downfall of Langauge:Samskruth is greatly linked to the 5-D's ( **decline, destruction, dilution, distortion and deceptions**) affecting Guru-Kul, Guru's and Communities and social economics.

 **Net out come**: Samskruti related to Samskruth is distorted. The hue and cry for loss of tradition and langauge of tradition raises. Where are we seeing the strategy for revivial action ?



 The motive to ' keep alive a langauge -teaching department in a University ( and support an employed Instructor), lead by a state ( or a charity institution/ corporate) ' is aligned to the goal of

outputting a 'socially useful person, who can be sustained in
a society, economically \[ employment -skill -profession oriented language education\] . The social need met is skilled professional service. 

The design of system builds to graduate a skill-mechanic and
function as a system maintainer. Grooming a Visionary is not a part of design or goal of such a school and system.

The technical traditional name for this category is ' उपाध्याय - शिक्षक ( -The equivalent of Mason Skills trainers ;
वृत्ति-कुशल-कर्माचार्य ' . 



 The motive to ' keep alive a langauge -teaching institution lead by Master ' through a Guru-Kul institution ( and support an
Guru-Community आचार्य-कुल), lead by a state ( or a charity institution/ 

corporate) is aligned to the goal of guarding the knowledge-wealth (रक्षा - असन्देह :: Protection,Preservation, Propagation, Application Customization and practical Improvisation without any shread of doubt)

The goal is to output a ' visionary executive' (पुरोहित : - वयं राष्ट्रे जागृयाम पुरोहिताः - ) who guide the use of that
knowledge for total social wellness- wealth -welfare ' a ' socially -spiritually elite leader, an

icon of tradition, who sustains the society. The technical name for this category is ' (पुरोहित- गुरु आचार्य ऋषि ). The model is ब्रह्मर्षि - राजर्षि- :: ब्रह्म-क्षत्रं पान्तु . 



 **The Guru-Kul school alone can decode the 'amaratva' aspect of Samskrutham. This needs connecting Samskrutham to Yoga in Vedas, Gita and Patanjali.**

** The 'amaratva' model' of Samskrutham is connected to the axiom:
Learn and Use Languages like Yoga for Yoga benefits. **

****

Jaina / Buddha equivalent : अर्हन्त- सिद्धdirectives for Prakruth and social langauges. These are Value trainers ; कुशल- पुरुषार्थ - परमर्थ - धर्म - श्रेयस् - निःश्रेयस्- बोधक / प्रेरक / चर्यावर्यजनाः , धर्म - कर्म-योगाचार्याः)' . 



2. The quest of Samskruth Langauge-grammar study under 'Vedanga'
model has provided system and methods to safeguard 'Vedas' and ensure social utility of ' Application of Vedas in the form of Upa-Vedas'. This is clearly articulated in almost all disciplines, more clearly in Niruka: \< कोऽन्वस्माकं ऋषिर्भवतीति \> Who amongst us will be the 'Succeeding Rushi, a Successor of this great heritage, a defender and propagator, meeting that standard of excellence?. The training and audit is aimed for this goal. **This Guru-Kul school has responsibility
to defend the 'amaratva' propositional axiom of Samskrutham.
**When Samskruth studies in post colonial period took an exit from the ' Vedanga' model losing the direction and directive , the inhouse-breakdown for Samskrutha/ Panini studies began at India. Rest is history and lamenting.



3. **Latin as a liturgical prayer langauge has not gone out of ' Christian Religion society/ community ! Neither the language of the jewish or Islamic community.**

Explore
<https://theconversation.com/why-pope-francis-is-reviving-a-long-tradition-of-local-variations-in-catholic-services-83942> ;



 **With approximately 1.311 billion members (2018), the Latin Church remains by far the largest particular church not only in the Catholic Church or Western Christianity, but in all Christianity. **

\[ <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Church> \]



 None of these religions have given up on 'their sacred language of gods and scriptures; they have not altered the language model to study-teach-practice' the sacred langauge; they have not alowed academic freedom to meddle with the texts and langauge of the sacred heritage. The language-scholars of sacred texts keep connecting 'Source langage to Society, through the mechanism of social langauge discourses , including english. **Using social language bridge is not a substitution or reconstruction of source langauge -texts** .

Compare this to in house models demands on 'Samskruth in liturgy, rituals '! **This beneficiaries of ' samskruth- amaratva / deva bhashaa' has responsibility to defend the 'amaratva' propositional axiom of Samskrutham in this context, beyond faith, without leaving a shread of doubt. **



4. The action at SOAS, University of London and related exchange of observations opens up a flood of questions on how and why of ' Human relation to Language'. There are several dimensions of this relation explored and articulated cryptically in several Samskruth expressions. One such expression in Subhashita reads \< वाग्भूषणं भूषणम् , विद्या-विहीनः पशुः > This brings out the 'Human Culturing relevance to ' transform and elevate 'animal' in human to become a person of excellence.



The language model and key concept of a 'Sacred universal langauge, for human communion and communication with Universe-Sacred Divine, for ' Punya and Purushartha through yajna- yoga- poojaa' is reflected in the design of Yaskas Nirukta and Panini's ashtaadhyayi \< छन्दस् - भाषा
pairing in Panini as 'Veda-Bhashaa -anga' , the traditional langauge model for Samskruth ; The native linguistics grouping connects languages in three connected streams and segments : लोक-भाषा (प्राकृतम्) - देवभाषा (-अमरभाषा) - दर्शन भाषा (श्रुति) .

This model is not constricted to the IE linguistic carrying root anchor to ' Tower of Babel story and language branching -movements, the key stone of western linguistic analytics used for
Samskrutham-Langauge studies.



The social relevance of Samskruth, under a colonial lens challenged the very relevance of 'sanskrit studies' at every level of education at India; rated using this underpinning of 'essential language skill to eke out a livelihood in a 'religious society', to keep people together under control by fear or favor related to ' gods' ?! . The popular opinion standing out justifies this statement : If one has some knowledge of Sanskrit, the only job they are fit for is a ' ritual, temple, school teaching related work, where high status and low socio-economic power, a life style of stretched hands to bless and receive charity is forced imminent mind set. ((भू-देव , दरिद्र-विप्र).



** Again coming back, What would be the consequences for samskruth Langauge user communities if ' Amaratva' of Samskruth is taken out and substituted by ' historic ancient classic feature'? Would ' Samskruth based scripture using religion called Hinduism would still be a part of world- Religion' ?? **
