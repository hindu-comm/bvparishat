1. The discussion on this thread is probing deeper and deeper in to the past of 'South East Asian studies ' covering 'Indian languages/ in particular Sanskrit ,( Hindi …) and Tamil'.

Post Colonial scholars have taught current generation Indians on how to study their own native tradition, differently. The wisdom of Master Kuan invoked at the Berkely University is worth deep

contemplation.



"If you plan for a year, plant a seed.

If for ten years, plant a tree.

If for a hundred years, teach the people.

When you sow a seed once, you will reap a single harvest.

*When you teach the people, you will reap a hundred harvests*"

*-The Book of Master Kuan*

Introduction

by Richard M. Buxbaum, Dean of International and Area Studies



In the words of the 12th century Buddhist hermit, Kamo No Chomei: "The flow of the river is ceaseless and its water is never the same." For well over one hundred years Asian studies have been central to the teaching, research, and service missions of the Berkeley campus. Because of the foresight of University founders, Asian studies courses were offered soon after the University's inauguration.



**Early programs concentrated on the languages, literatures, and histories of the region.** They laid the foundation for the development, after World War II, of fullblown academic programs encompassing the humanities and social sciences, the natural and physical sciences, and the professional disciplines. **In the last two decades the burgeoning economies of Asia have catapulted a once esoteric branch of knowledge to prominence throughout the University.**



Berkeley's Asian programs consistently rate among the very best in the country and attract scholars and students from all over the world. Because of its location on the Pacific Rim, the campus shares a special kinship and lively interaction with the countries of Asia. The Asian community, desiring to preserve an ancient heritage and to promote a deeper understanding of the region's modern societies and cultures, has provided scholarly and professional expertise and an unprecedented measure of generous support for Berkeley's many Asian programs, which we are proud to represent through this splendid exhibit.



**A Hundred Harvests**: the History of Asian Studies at Berkeley pays tribute to the scholars and philanthropists who founded and continue to nurture the programs that enrich the University of California, Berkeley. Through the archival holdings and matchless library collections showcased in the exhibit the ceaseless flow of the river unfolds.

2. On \< comparable programs from Government of India \> the researchers may have to be look at the history and education policies framed by GOI .

The wisdom of GOI is what seems to work at India.



**Suffice it to say that present 'Sanskrit' remains…..at India in 2020, is a direct outcome of free and conscious choices opted and exectured by GOI. **

**On same count, the likely remains of 'Sanskrit' ..at India in 2040, will be a direct outcome of free and conscious choices opted and exectured by GOI in 2021. **



What would this be is any body's guess. It could be a get back to 14th century model of Sanskrit studies; it could be a new and hybrid avatar of ' Colonial + Oriental + South East Asian' Classical langauge studies. OR, it could be a ' hybrid of human languges non-english like in the Technology Institutes used for computational linguistics research under the tag and company of classical languages'.



The Samskruth loving teams need to make their wish and choice to ensure Paninian ( and Patanjali-Yaska)alignemnt and steer government action. I use the term 'Yoga-Samskrutham ' for this standards.



3. The following links provide material of interest to read in this regard. Please Don’t push the langauge scholar to explain the 'beyond language- political and other strategies' in supporting language studies and research-chairs.



On a comparable period of time, the work done for 'Sanskrit' outside of India with the support of Indian scholars has yielded greater quality and quantum of 'primary and dependable original material' on which much of current Indian studies and claims are resting. 



4. **Suffice it to say**: (i) The interest in India and Indian languages, specifically for Sanskrit and its applications in Ayurveda and ' Yajna- Mantra- Mystic Weapons' has a long history with foreign connections. Studying this interest in a narrow window will not reveal the deep and true roots. The history needs to be seen in various segments of pre-colonial, post colonial to World war-2, Shift of focus from UK to Germany, France and then to USA, US interest in rest of world and Ford Foundation support for Oriental studies, Post India Independnece actions, 21st century trends. This will only reveal the 'past Karma- Trajectory' for ' blame game' rather than ' Future Action plan' for leadership and atmanirbharataa. If we don’t understand in home land the source material, If our own native understanding of tradition is at cross roads and cross purpose, why
blame others ? (ii) Pegging Nations interest in its own heritage languages is as important as its policy on 'foreign language related
education openings'. (ii) More than Government action, the language communities should have been proactive in safeguarding and nurturing with investments the native heritage languages and groom the 'next generation' to be sensitive to the heritage language.



** In short** : The motive for Language studies in the west seems to have a clear alignment to national and religion interests. At India, the alignment is for spiritual or business interests. 

The motive for Language studies in the Panini-Patanjali- Yaska vedic tradition, in the lane of ' Vedanga' is clearly for balanced alignment of 'Purushartha and Paramartha'. achievement.

**Sri sukta is clear on this point: ' Praadubhotosmi Rashtresmin, keetim,Vruddhim dadatu me, …. alkshmim
naashayaamyaham. **



***Select excerpts from the link above***:



South Asian studies has a long and distinguished history at Berkeley. Benjamin Ide Wheeler was himself a student of Sanskrit. Sanskrit was taught at Berkeley beginning in 1897 and in 1906 the first professorship in Sanskrit was created when celebrated scholar and translator, Arthur Ryder, joined the Berkeley faculty. South Asia related programs were gradually expanded in succeeding decades, but began in earnest in 1940 when Murray Barnson Emeneau came to Berkeley. He taught and conducted research in Sanskrit and Dravidian linguistics, and Indian ethnography and folklore. He was joined after the war by the great anthropologist David Mandelbaum and subsequently by a broad array of scholars working on the languages, literatures, history, art, music, politics, economy, peoples, and societies of the South Asian region, one of the most populous and diverse in the world.



Historical development after World War II provided an impetus to the introduction of teaching and research programs focusing on the Southeast Asia region in American higher education. **Funded by the Ford Foundation, the Southeast Asian studies program was inaugurated in 1954 to meet a national need and the extensive interest in Southeast Asia at the University of California, Berkeley**. (
<https://guides.lib.berkeley.edu/hundredharvests/southeast-asian-studies> )



Showing great foresight, the Center for South Asia Studies began an effort in 1990 to establish endowed chairs to insure the future of South Asian studies at Berkeley. The success of their efforts can be seen in three new endowed chairs established through tremendous outpouring of support from the South Asian-American community, not only in the Bay Area, but across the country.



The Sarah Kailath Chair in India Studies was established by Thomas Kailath, and Vinita and Narendra Gupta in honor of Dr. Kailath's wife, Sarah Kailath, to enhance awareness and knowledge of issues relating to the Indian subcontinent. **The current chairholder is Robert P. Goldman, Professor of Sanscrit in the Department of South and Southeast Asian Studies**.



**With assistance from the Consulate General of India, San Francisco, the Center also conducted a campaign to raise endowment funds from the Indo-American community resulting in the Indo-American Community Chair in India Studies.** Inaugural lectures for both the Sarah Kailath Chair in India Studies and the Indo-American Community Chair in India Studies were delivered by former Ambassador to India, John Kenneth Galbraith, and Nobel Laureate physicist, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.

Dear Nagaraj Ji,



When I read your comment "This also shows that you are against those who talk and campaign against Indian government's policies on Yoga, Ayurveda etc., serving Indian national interests." I see that you are reading something far deeper into my words. I am not for or against any policies of the government of India, and I have not participated in any political movements in India. I am more closely familiar with the policies of the American government, as I have lived here in the US for 53 years and served at the University of Michigan, than I am with the policies of the Indian government. I know that from time to time, US government officers used to visit university campuses to interview students for government jobs,and I didn't think there was anything strange about that. I also know that the governments of China, Korea and Japan were financially supporting the study of their languages and cultures at the University of Michigan and at many other universities, and they obviously had their own national interests. My account of the 1962 India-China war is entirely based on the reports of Captain Belvalkar, and I cannot say much more than that. I don't know if the Indian government today does or does not support foreign language teaching from the point of defence concerns. I hope it does. That is just about what I have to add to this discussion. With best wishes,
