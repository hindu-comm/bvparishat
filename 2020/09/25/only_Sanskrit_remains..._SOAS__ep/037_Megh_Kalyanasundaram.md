Namaste Dr. Deshpande,

  

An election in America is, frankly, and speaking as an Indian citizen, none of my business (generally speaking), other than when it begins to affect 1) the interests of my nation (including but not limited to its legitimate territorialsovereignty) and hence mine 2) global peaceful non-interfering co-existence (more generally speaking) \[not listing all reasons here\].

  

Yet, since you have invoked the impending American elections, allow me to chime in by saying that while I am no fan of Trump (and have been publicly criticalabout some of his decisions), I would definitely not like to be an Indian-American (who still feels any sense of loyalty towards India'ssovereignty) at a polling booththis year, when the choices are what they are, especially given my reading (which I actually hope is wrong but worry it might not be wrong enough) of the position taken by Democrats on some aspects including the developments in Kashmir post the deoperationalizationofArticle 370. Anyway, wishing all American citizens, including yourself, a peaceful future.
