Dear Nagaraj Ji,

  

When I read your comment "This also shows that you are against those who talk and campaign against Indian government's policies on Yoga, Ayurveda etc., serving Indian national interests." I see that you are reading something far deeper into my words. I am not for or against any policies of the government of India, and I have not participated in any political movements in India. I am more closely familiar with the policies of the American government, as I have lived here in the US for 53 years and served at the University of Michigan, than I am with the policies of the Indian government. I know that from time to time, US government officers used to visit university campuses to interview students for government jobs,and I didn't think there was anything strange about that. I also know that the governments of China, Korea and Japan were financially supporting the study of their languages and cultures at the University of Michigan and at many other universities, and they obviously had their own national interests. My account of the 1962 India-China war is entirely based on the reports of Captain Belvalkar, and I cannot say much more than that. I don't know if the Indian government today does or does not support foreign language teaching from the point of defence concerns. I hope it does. That is just about what I have to add to this discussion. With best wishes,
