Regarding financing foreign chairs, the mentality is similar to a VP I once observed at a company. He would promote exclusively people who had wanted to quit for another job. As a matter of fact if a good engineer tried to quit, he would pull all stops to retain him and it seemed you were on a fast track in the promotion ladder immediately. It puzzled me till I interacted a bit with him. He had a deep seated inferiority complex (he was in fact quite useless, so that complex had a basis in fact :-)). and was convinced the company he worked for was useless as well, and if people just stayed there, they were useless too since he assumed that they stayed back only because they didn't get anything better. Regardless of all posturing most of the kazhagam thoNDars (starting with D or A) are completely convinced that people working on Tamil language are essentially worthless, and of course if a foreigner spouts some stuff on it, he must be doing some great since he obviously has other options. So much for my theories. But here's what I read a while back:

  

<https://shiva4senate.com/dr-shiva-ayyadurai-stops-harvard-tamil-professorship-scam/>

  

Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai claims to have single handedly put the kibosh on the Tamil chair, I don't know how true this is. While the latter part of the article is somewhat "Cuckoo for cocoa puffs" as they say in the USA (at least IMO), the beginning part is actually spot on:

  

According to Dr. Ayyadurai, “The fundraising effort in the name of setting up a Tamil Chair is a ruse that exemplifies Harvard’s habitual exploitation of indigenous people. This is an egregious example akin to a burglar asking you to pay money to buy a rickety ladder to rob your own home. Harvard is asking Tamilians to pay $6 million for a professorship that will be used to rob their own historic artifacts worth trillions of dollars representing the ‘Holy Grail’ of the world’s most highly-prized indigenous knowledge.” Harvard will then proceed to use access to those artifacts to rewrite and hegemonize Tamil history, an unfortunate and recurrent process that Harvard has done for far too long to many indigenous cultures.

  

**A Hedge Fund Masquerading as a University**  
Harvard’s financial statements reveal that the university is fundamentally a tax-exempt Wall Street hedge fund with cash and investments of nearly $35 Billion. In 2016 alone, Harvard’s capital marketing campaign raised $7 Billion, with its hedge fund in 2017 yielding $2 billion in gross profits. The operating budget further reveals that professors and administrators effectively serve as business development staff to attract wealthy donors to fund Chairs and professorships that finance their lucrative hedge fund. In 2017, as the Boston Globe reported, Harvard’s seven top hedge fund managers earned a total of nearly $58 million in compensation.

  

Dr. Ayyadurai said, “As these numbers indicate, Harvard is a hedge fund masquerading as a University, which perpetuates this facade by reinvesting large portions of its hedge fund proceeds to unleash propaganda that it is a ‘world-renowned’ institution of higher learning and scholarliness dedicated to advancing humankind. This branding attracts financing from well-meaning folks, compelled to ‘join the club’ so their children get preferential treatment when applying to Harvard and access to Harvard’s insider network. This dynamic is rarely discussed in the mainstream media.” Nearly one-third of the students admitted to Harvard are beneficiaries of a well-documented legacy and preferential admission system that is not merit-based but on “who you know” or who donated money.

  

Dr. Ayyadurai’s leadership in opposing the “Harvard Tamil Chair” has led to significant discussions on social media. Questions are being raised about why Harvard exists. Does Harvard exist as a center of research and learning? Or, does Harvard exist to enrich itself through its hedge fund activities? Given the historic value of Tamil, why didn’t Harvard fund Tamil studies with its own $6 million, particularly given that the amount would be a paltry sum (which would be less than one-tenth of one-percent of the $7 billion Harvard raised from its recent 2016 capital campaign)?

Harvard has a track record of destroying indigenous people’s heritage and culture by seizing control of their property, intellectual and otherwise. In 2011, an exposé revealed that Harvard used its hedge fund cash to [take over land in Africa](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/08/us-universities-africa-land-grab) leading to forcible displacement of indigenous farmers. The Harvard Tamil Chair would have offered a gateway for Harvard to exercise control over the rare and ancient palm leaf manuscripts — the intellectual property of the indigenous people of Tamil Nadu.

PS: BTW, the cash-and-carry business, namely give me your cash and carry your degree, in Harvard is actually not 1/3rd of admissions as Appadurai says, but is estimated to be more in the 45% - 50% range by many other people.
