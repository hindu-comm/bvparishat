Thank you, Sri Megh Ji. However, I am not a PhD. I am just a Sanskrit enthusiast.

  

Regarding Dr. Sastry's question,

  

I am not knowledgeable enough to answer it in entirety but wanted to make just two remarks:

  

1\. **"अमृतत्वस्य तु नाशास्ति वित्तेन":** It seems that the language that is relatively insulated from the material conditions of mundane life has a better chance at immortality. A language that rises with an improvementin the socio-economic status of its speakers will also fall when said status deteriorates. The name गीर्वाण-वाणी implies that Sanskritis the language of the devas, who are indeed amara-s. If for nothing else, we need it to communicate with the devas. Without communion with the divine, how can there be immortality? I believe that the knowledge of Sanskrit is possible only through the meritorious karmas of past lives and the grace of the devas, who speak it. Therefore, the enormous Adṛṣṭa of using Sanskrit will likely be realized across many lives.  

  

2\. **Base for Innovation:** When I encounter English speakers, it appears that their speaking and writing are based almost entirely on habit and custom. Everything, from words to phrases, seems pre-determined. For any innovation, English speakers must seek refuge in their classical roots: Latin or Greek. Similarly, we need the stable anchoring of Sanskrit to ensure that other Indian languages keep growing. As we have previously discussed in this forum, many Indo-European languages can be viewedas Prakrita-s with respect to Sanskrit. Without theamṛta of Sanskrit, other Indian languages are sure to die a slow death.

  

There are many other benefits that scholars would want to highlight. But I wanted to mention the above two points based on my observation.
