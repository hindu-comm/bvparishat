Madhavji,

There was, in the US, no defense related funding for the study and teaching of Sanskrit, and yet the American universities started teaching Sanskrit around the 1850s.

This statement may be true, but I have reason to believe that sanskrit teaching was done to translate the scriptures for evangelical work which continued for a century

or longer. It was most likely connected to the Jesuits interest to "teach" in the local languages in the "colonies."

Best regards,

Bijoy
