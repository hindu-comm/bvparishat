Namaste





Thinking aloud:



In the course of History:



Langauges in social usage change to adapt to the practical needs of users. Like the dress, food, weapons, money , jewellery …… They have a social purpose.



Samskrutham seems to stands out of such league of langauges( mainly social and historical) and yet serve the social and spiritual
purpose in a unified mode.



What could be the reason for this ' amaratva' ( changeless ness/ minimal change) of this one langauge ' brahmi- bhaarati' from this land of Yoga ? Is it a merit or defect ? Kepeing this 'feature', what has Samskrutham achieved - delviered ? can deliver to the 21st century audience ? beyond conversation ?
