Dear Bijoy Ji,

  

  Certainly, there were some in the US who studied Sanskrit with missionary interests, but more studied it in order to further their understanding of the Indo-European linguistics. The earliest was W.D. Whitney \[February 9, 1827– June 7, 1894\]whose inspiration came from the German scholar Roth with whom he spent a few years in Germany, and I see no connection of a missionary zeal in his edition and translation of the Śaunakīya Atharvaveda and the phonetic treatise Śaunakīya Caturādhyāyikā, and his wide contributions to linguistics. There was serious engagement by Whitney with Indo-European linguistics, and Sanskrit was an important part of it. More general info on Whitney:<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Dwight_Whitney>
