Dear Megh Ji,

  

  Speaking for myself as an American citizen, I don't trust what the Trump administration says about anything, let alone about India. Trump's love for Modi and India, like all his policies, ispurely transactional. What is in it for him. He hopes to get money and votes from the Indian American community, which generally votes democratic. Among my own acquaintances, I don't know anyone who is supporting Trump. Right now filling my mail-in-ballot for the election. Best,
