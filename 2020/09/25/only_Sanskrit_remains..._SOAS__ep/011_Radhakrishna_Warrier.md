Yes, "देशे देशे युगे युगे" there is much more variation in Greek pronunciation than in the case of Sanskrit. This could be because of the more logical and scientific arrangement of the varṇamālā of Sanskrit (and other Indic languages), the more scientific ancient inquiry into phonemes (dhvani) and the increased focus on correct pronunciation, especially of the Vedas and mantras (incorrect pronunciation of mantras was believed to bring very bad consequences to the utterer.)  

  

"*However, there is often no mention of the ancient aspirate pronunciation of θ, φ and χ, which are different from the modern fricative pronunciation*."

  

I don't remember where I read this, but what I read was that the change of aspirated pronunciation of Greekθ, φ and χto the current fricative pronunciation began happening before two millennia. Originally, they were pronounced like Indic थ, फ, and ख  but later changed to the fricative th as in English "think", f (फ़, ف ) and k͟h (ख़, خ).

  

The transliteration of the name of the Indo-Greek king Agathocles as Agathukleyesa (अगथुक्लेयेस) in Brahmi shows that the pronunciation ofθ at that time was like Indicथ. Below is the picture of the coin of Agathocles reproduced from Wikipedia article

In Brahmi, the "Rajane" is not very clear. We can see Ra and ne, but the ja is obscured by what appears to be Krishna's Sudarshana Chakra.
