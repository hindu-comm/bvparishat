"Other dead Asian languages have also closed, notably Syriac, Avestan and Pahlavi; only Sanskrit remains."

  

I do not know about the other three languages but I hope that Sanskrit hasnotbeen labeled as a "dead language" by the authors of this pamphlet. If it has been, then one cannot sympathize with the authors.
