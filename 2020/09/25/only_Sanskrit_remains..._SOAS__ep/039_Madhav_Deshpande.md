Dear Megh Ji,

  

Unfortunately, "peaceful future" is what we in the US are worried about whether Trump wins or not. You have probably heard/read about the white supremacist supporters of Trump plotting to kidnap the democratic governor of Michigan. The future looks very grim at the moment, especially for all those of us who are now labeled as "people of color". The situation will get especially bad if Trump loses the election, because white supremacist rioting is expected to be unleashed on the streets. I have never been worried like this in my 53 years of life in the US. The election of Obama to presidency lead to the rise of fear among the white supremacist groups that the whites in the US are going to become a minority and lose their previleged position. I hope things are not going to get that bad, but certainly there is a possibility of violent reactions in many places in the US.
