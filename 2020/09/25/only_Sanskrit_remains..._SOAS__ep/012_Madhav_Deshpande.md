As I remember, all this discussion began with a report that the School of Oriental and African Studies at London is closing down the teaching of many low-enrollment languages due to financial hardship, and Sanskrit is one of the few languages that have survived this massive budget cut for the time being. Our discussions here are focused on how Sanskrit is clearly not dead for us and how important in Indian culture. Such appropriate justifications in India make it possible for the Government of India to allocate a significant amount of money for the teaching and promotion of Sanskrit. But such government funds are not available for languages like Sanskrit in the west. There is nothing like the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan in any other country. With all our justified admiration for Sanskrit in India, the financial crises in European and American universities are so overwhelming that often the decision to maintain or shut down a particular subject ultimately comes down to enrollments in that subject. The teaching of modern foreign languages in the US universities is supported to some extent by the National Defense Language Fellowships offered by the Federal Government. However, such funds are not available for the teaching of ancient languages like Sanskrit, Avestan, Sumerian or Assyrian. The questions for the universities then become primarily financial. Do the enrollments in a given subject provide sufficient revenue to justify the expenditure on thatsubject? We had similar situations and discussions at the University of Michigan a few times in the past. In my own department, an instructor who wanted to teach some low-enrollment classes had to teach a few other high enrollment classes to justify the cost of the salary for that instructor. Some governments like China, Korea and Japan have poured money into foreign countries to promote the teaching of their languages and cultures. The government of India is evidently doing some such efforts, but they are not enough to alleviate the financial crises in western universities. I am glad to hear that Sanskrit has not faced the same fate as some other languages in London at this time, but this is no guarantee of the future. The Covid-19 situation has significantly added to the woes of the universities and the teaching of not only Sanskrit, but all humanities, is in some serious trouble.
