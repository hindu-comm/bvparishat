Good points brought up by Nagaraj Ji. These are clearly the interests of the US Federal Government in financially supporting the study of modern foreign languages that are deemed critical for US national defense. I don't see anything wrong with the American government being concerned about its own national defense interests. Sanskrit does not fit that bill and hence does not get any support in this category.
Insidently, this reminds me of an account of the 1962 India-China war written by a Marathi captain who was taken captive by the Chinese. He writes that the Chinese army had officers trained in all major Indian languages and one officer spoke to this Marathi captain in fluent Marathi. On theother hand, the captain writes that the Indian army had a total of three people who could understand and interpretChinese, and two of them were stationed in Delhi and only one was on hand on the eastern frontier. The Russians, Germans, French and others also have robust foreign language programs,in part for their national defense interests. I hope the situation has improved by now in India, and more attention is being paid to the study of foreign languages for the sake of national defense and other interests. There was, in the US, no defense related funding for the study and teaching of Sanskrit, and yet the American universities started teaching Sanskrit around the 1850s. There was Sanskrit teaching at the University of Michigan from the 1890s.
