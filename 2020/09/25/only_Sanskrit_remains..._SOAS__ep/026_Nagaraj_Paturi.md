Dear Prof. Deshpande,

  

The information that there are defense related National(ist)/ Governmental interests behind the studies of Indian languages abroad may come as a surprise to those who might have been thinking that the studies are based on the 'greatness' , 'beauty' etc. of their languages and the appreciation/acknowledgement of those qualities and love for their languages based on such appreciation on the part of funding agency and the scholars and students studying them, not to people like you who have always been in the know of such things.

  

BTW, can you share information, if you have, about similar/ comparable programs by Government of India on non-Indian /foreign languages ?
