Friends,

Besides Government funding for national interests (as advocated), there does exist an allergy to Indian scholarship

abroad. (Books and papers on Sanskrit grammar may not cite Panini even though some may mention in passing!,

Anyone hardly knows Valmiki, but they know Goldman.) This is a blatant violation of scholarship, mostly because  

of cultural ignorance as I can estimate. or could be deliberate.(national interest!) It is more distorted in cultural texts

like Ramayana, Mahabharat or Devi. It is not easy to understand Indian culture unless one grows up in it. The  

perception and habits are different. "yoga" as a word can mean different in India and in the west. Though good funding

the west does create a breed of scholars who remain semi-educated but that does not prevent them in producing books  

and compilations and these get market in India. Most are possibly sincere, but do lack depth. "vak" is not language,  

"brahman" is not god. Unfortunately such stuff proliferates in India because of general facility in English. The schools

in the US portray India very differently than most parents' knowledge.
Immigration itself is a difficult enterprise.  

Unfortunately many working Indians participate in endorsing the bias for personal survival and safety. There should arise

a groundswell in India to readjust Middle and high school education, which must not be driven by political or religious  

pressures. India's contribution to the world is her literature.  

So is my opinion on the subject.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
