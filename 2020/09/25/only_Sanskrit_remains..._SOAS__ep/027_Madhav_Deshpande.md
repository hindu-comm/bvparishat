Dear Nagaraj Ji,

  

  You need to separate the interests of the government and the interests of the students and professors. The US government supports only the basic language teaching, but anything beyond that is done by students and professors because of their deeper interests in those languages and cultures. Lumping all latnguage and culture study in the US or Europe as related to and motivated by political considerations makes no sense to me. I have not studied the policies of the Govt of India, and cannot say anything about them with any authority. I was mentioning my impressions from reading an account of the 1962 war written by Captain Vasudev Belvalkar where he reportedthat the Chinese army had officers trained in all major Indian languages, while the Indian army had very few officers who understood Chinese. I hope things have changed by now.
