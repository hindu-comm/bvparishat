An affix is a linguistic element (prefix or suffix) added to a word to produce an inflected or derived form (like a pratyaya in Sanskrit).
However, a portmanteau affix simultaneously specifies more than one type of information (like tense and person/number, or more than one agreement).

  

For example, Hungarian uses a single suffix -lak/-lek to express the combination of I→you, which expresses both subject and object information. For instance,  

  

> 
> > 
> > *szeret-lek*
> > 
> > 
> > love-affix-indicating-I→you
> > 
> > 
> > 'I love you'. (Hungarian)\[1\] >
> 
> > 

  
Old Tamil verb affixes can also be labeled as Portmanteau affixes (similar verb system is there in Telugu too) (Hock and Bashir p442).In the same book, you may read pages 468-469 to see examples of affixes among the SouthAsian languages with multiple agreement (including cases with triple agreement).
