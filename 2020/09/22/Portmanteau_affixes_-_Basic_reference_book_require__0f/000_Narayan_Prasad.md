Dear Scholars,

     Namaste.

  

     In the book "\[Hock and Bashir\] The Languages and Linguistics of South Asia-A Comprehensive Guide-2016", p.318, fn.99 says:

  

     Many Tibeto-Burman languages as well as Maithili and Magahi, have portmanteauaffixes, such as Maithili –ǝuk 3NON-HON→2NON-HON.

     Kindly suggest me a book to get the basic idea about "portmanteau affixes".  

  

     Thanksand regards

     Narayan Prasad
