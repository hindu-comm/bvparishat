Hare Krishna.  
  
Respected Vidvaj-janas,  
  
I am looking for a hard copy of the Hindi book, Purana Anukramanika,  
painstakingly compiled by Radha Gupta and team. It is very helpful for  
me and I want a hard copy of it for my library.  
  
I am not able to locate it on online stores, somehow. If anyone knows  
about how to get it, it will be very helpful.  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das  
  
ps. I do have the softcopy having complex folder structure and about  
650 word files
