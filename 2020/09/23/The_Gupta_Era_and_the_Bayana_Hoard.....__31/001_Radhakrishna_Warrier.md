The article says that the villagers had already melted about two hundred from among these gold coins before officials could reach the village and take charge of the ancient coin hoarding discovered.

  

There are plenty of folktales in which people find "nidhi" (treasure) buried in pots, and live happily ever after their discovery of such nidhi-s. Perhaps such tales carry an element of truth. The "nidhi" that people hit up on might be hoardings of such ancient gold coins.
There were no banks in ancient times and people buried their savings in pots for safety from thieves and robbers.

  

On another note, the Indo-Greeks who ruled from ancient Gandhara (Bactria) minted beautiful coins. Many of these coins were bilingual with legends in both Greek and Brahmi (and sometimes Kharoshthi) characters. Here are a few examples:

The following is not Bactrian, but ancient Indian coins with Greek legends. The Greek legendΒΟΔΔΟ ("Boddo" = Buddha?)is interesting:
