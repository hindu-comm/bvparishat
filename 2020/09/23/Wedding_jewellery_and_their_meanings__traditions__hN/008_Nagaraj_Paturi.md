Now that some textual references are shared, let me come to the most immediate concerns that probably motivated the initiatingpost of the thread :

  

The contemporary generation is asking/looking for simple and straight answers to their why questions about our customs and traditions. While the textual references can provide authenticity to the answers we need to focus on direct one to one answers to these why questions.

  

One important aspect, Smt Shoba Narayan -ji that we need to keep in mind while attending to issues is that our Vedic /Sanskrit texts provide help in understanding the pan-Indic Hindu aspects , the local specificities come from what in the Vedic/Sanskritic tradition is called dEshaachaara = local traditions..

  

Vedic/ Sanskrit texts may not help in providing explanation for all the dEshaachaara aspects.

  

For example,

  

mangala sutrafor north Indians is found in [these](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=maangala+sutra&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwjqpavPjobsAhXTkuYKHSfYCeYQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=maangala+sutra&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzoECCMQJzoGCAAQCBAeOgYIABAKEBg6AggAOgQIABAYUJzhAljDkQNg2bADaABwAHgAgAGbAYgBxRGSAQQwLjE3mAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWfAAQE&sclient=img&ei=BNVuX-qTOtOlmgensKewDg&bih=544&biw=1266&hl=en) images from google images page found for the key word 'mangala sutra'.

  

maangalyam for south Indians is shown in [these](https://www.google.co.in/search?hl=en&tbm=isch&sxsrf=ALeKk00JUIJV8Ol1cCxEy66TerCyMjSwKA%3A1601099001228&source=hp&biw=1266&bih=544&ei=-dRuX7asC6vhz7sP5dSuqA0&q=maangalyam+design&oq=maangalya&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQARgBMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADoECCMQJzoFCAAQsQM6CAgAELEDEIMBUK0XWN84YJ9YaABwAHgAgAGOAYgB1QaSAQM4LjGYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZw&sclient=img) images from google images page found for the key word 'mangalyam designs'.

  

taaLi (spelt as thali) is the word in all the south Indian languages for the item shown in[these](https://www.google.co.in/search?hl=en&tbm=isch&sxsrf=ALeKk00JUIJV8Ol1cCxEy66TerCyMjSwKA%3A1601099001228&source=hp&biw=1266&bih=544&ei=-dRuX7asC6vhz7sP5dSuqA0&q=maangalyam+design&oq=maangalya&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQARgBMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADoECCMQJzoFCAAQsQM6CAgAELEDEIMBUK0XWN84YJ9YaABwAHgAgAGOAYgB1QaSAQM4LjGYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZw&sclient=img) images.

  

This is what is being referred to in the thread initiatingpost as :

There is an implied understanding in these words that mangalasutrais worn by married Hindu women to symbolize that they are married.

  

Smt Shoba Narayan -ji ,

  

The actual 'meaning' /intention of mangalasutra/maangalya/ taaLi is not to symbolize that woman wearing it is married. That symblismof it is only incidental.

  

But the actual 'meaning' /intention of mangalasutra/maangalya/ taaLi is a rakshaaor a talisman to secure the life of the tying person, the bridegroom. talisman-like magical objects were made from palm leaf drawings earlier to their being made on copper or other metal sheets in at least south India. That is probably the origin of the word taaLi. (taazh/taaL=palm). maangalyam is very similar. Probably that is the reason for the 'merger' of / synonimy between the mangala sutra and taaLi traditions.  

  

A 'modern' early 20th century Telugu writer bit by the anti-tradition (anti-Hindu?) bug created by the enlightenment age excitement among the 'educated' of those times, one Sri Tapi Dharma Rao , in his book, 'Devalayala Mida Butubommalenduku?' = Why porographic images on temples , says that the shape of the taaLi is in the form of breasts. (Please check[here](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=thali+mangalyam&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwjejeX3kIbsAhWF2nMBHfDmC3kQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=thali+mangalyam&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIECAAQQzICCAAyAggAMgIIADIGCAAQCBAeMgYIABAIEB4yBggAEAgQHjIGCAAQCBAeMgYIABAIEB4yBggAEAgQHlDZTFjQU2CsaGgAcAB4AIABZ4gBygGSAQMxLjGYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZ8ABAQ&sclient=img&ei=ctduX96MKIW1z7sP8M2vyAc&bih=544&biw=1266&hl=en)if he is right. He saw only one design and overgeneralized it is obvious. ). 'It was intended to invoke the shape of breasts for the bridegroom /husband'. Such were the moron thoughts of the enlightenment age excited anti-traditionals (anti-Hindu).

  

Now, we have the interpretation of taaLi as a symbol of patriarchy, bondage /loss of freedom of women.
