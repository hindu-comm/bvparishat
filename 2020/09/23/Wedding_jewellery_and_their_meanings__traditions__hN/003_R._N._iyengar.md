The Svarna shilpa shastra (ಸ್ವರ್ಣ ಶಿಲ್ಪ ಶಾಸ್ತ್ರ ) in Kannada by Lingamurthi and Jnanananda is a mine of rare and original information that has come down in traditional families of jewelers and goldsmiths. This book has a Sanskrit text माङ्गल्यशास्त्रम् (ಮಾಂಗಲ್ಯ ಶಾಸ್ತ್ರ ) in four chapters with translation, figures, sketches etc. On the theory of traditional Indian jewelry nothing seems to match with the above monograph. PFA two page scans.
