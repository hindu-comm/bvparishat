Hari Om!

Prof. Iyengarji,

Jnananandaji has somany works, stories, novels, translations, Balasahitya, research works and editedvolumes.

All these are in Kannada script. Are they available in Devanagari?

Is the Sanskrit text Mangalya Sastra available in Devanagari script online?

This seems very interesting and treasure of cultural information.

  

  

warm regards
