Married Dvija men have to wear an extra Yajnopavita to show they are Gruhasthas. For doing any Mangala Karya like special Puja, Homa, Upanayana, Vivaha of son or daughter and other ceremonies the wife should be compulsorily present beside the husband. Husband cannot do it alone without wife. The famous story is about Rama could not do Ashwamedha Yajna without Seeta. They made a golden statue of Seeta and kept it with Rama.
