Namaste, Prof.Mahulikar.  

  

Your observation is correct. Dr,Jnanananda is a prolific writer on Vastu. Shilpa, Vedic Vishwakarma community etc. As far as I know the domain specific Sanskrit texts are not published in Devanagari script. Even the Shilpavidyarahasyopanishat edited by him, with the commentary of Kaumara is published by TTD is in Kannada script. I have met Jnananandaand deeply impressed with his knowledge of our ancient culture and history, including temple architecture, sculpting, chariots etc with their Vedic, Puranic, spiritual backgrounds. He was working as a Mechanical Engineer but took to his family tradition and has excelled in it.

  
I agree with Prof. Paturi that Jnanananda's works should be made available in other languages. I understand some of his works appeared in Telugu translation in a journal called Svati.  

  

kind regards
