But that actually doesn't stand to reason because as you say above the mangalasutra was to secure the life of the husband (sustenance for the wife). The husband did not need that provision from the wife so why wear it :)

  

The reasoning here seems to have basis in the belief that all cultural elements are rooted in sustenance, material/monetary support.
