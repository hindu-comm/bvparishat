Namaskara and Pranams to all:

  

I am doing some research on wedding jewellery. Why do we wear what we wear during weddings.

  

For example, what is the history and the meaning of the mangalsutra? Did men ever wear some such ornament to symbolise that they were married?

  

How did the Maharashtrian 'wati' become so different from the Tamil 'thaali.' How did the regional variations happen?

  

Why do women wear the Nath?  

  

What about Vanki and Oddiyanam?

  

The nagavadams and other Kerala chokers. Was it because they touched hormonal glands?

  

Toerings or metti? Again, the location linked to nerves?

  

Bangles, especially the auspicious wedding ones like the Shaka-pola in Bengal.

  

I would be grateful for any references on this topic. It could be from the Puranas to the Shastras.  

  

Sincerely,

Shoba
