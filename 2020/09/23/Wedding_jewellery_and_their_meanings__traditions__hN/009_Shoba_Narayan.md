Thank you Shri. Nagaraj Paturi Ji.

  

Regarding your below comment.

"But the actual 'meaning' /intention of mangalasutra/maangalya/ taaLi is a rakshaaor a talisman to secure the life of the tying person, the bridegroom. talisman-like magical objects were made from palm leaf drawings earlier to their being made on copper or other metal sheets in at least south India. That is probably the origin of the word taaLi. (taazh/taaL=palm). maangalyam is very similar. Probably that is the reason for the 'merger' of / synonimy between the mangala sutra and taaLi traditions."  

  

I discovered an interesting parallel in Oppi Untracht's book, "Traditional Jewellery of India."

It says that the Kashmiri "dejharu" or "dejhoor" that women wear in their ears as a symbol of marriage has a drawing of the "wegu" which is the talismanic drawing that is drawn around babies (presumably to protect them).

  

I have been searching for what the "wegu" looks like but have not been successful so far. As a Srividya Upasaka, I wanted to check if it had any tantric elements.

  

My reason for asking about men wearing mangala sutra was because even women used to wear the yajnopavitha in the past but no longer. So I wondered if men wore the mangalsutra in the past. But that actually doesn't stand to reason because as you say above the mangalasutra was to secure the life of the husband (sustenance for the wife). The husband did not need that provision from the wife so why wear it :)

  

I would like to respectfully add that as a working woman and a wife, perhaps both spouses should secure each other's lives, no?

Kind of like the Christian ring worn by both parties.
