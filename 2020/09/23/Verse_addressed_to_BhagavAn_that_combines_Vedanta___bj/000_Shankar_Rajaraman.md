अनेकैर्नामभिर्ध्येयं प्रभो त्वामीश्वरादिभिः ।

सोऽहंध्यानेन विन्दामि सर्वनामात्मकोऽसि यत् ॥

  

Lord! Though people meditate on you by using several names such as "Ishvara" etc, I shall attain you through the mediatation that employs the words "soham" for you are सर्वनामात्मक (possessing all names/of the nature of pronoun - both सः and अहं are pronouns)

  

Regards

Shankar Rajaraman
