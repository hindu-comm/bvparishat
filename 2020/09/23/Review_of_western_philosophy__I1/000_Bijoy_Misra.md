Friends,

As we know the western analysis is object-based determined by

the senses. Gradually it develops into a thought that language

is a learned process (imposed) than a creative process (developed).

We hosted a seminar to review the western literature from the Greeks

to the modern day. The seminar was led by Mr Jaspal Singh,

formerly from Yale University. I am sharing the video below

Our next seminar is Saturday. More information is at

Some of you have already registered. A Zoom link will go out Thursday.  

  

Regards,
