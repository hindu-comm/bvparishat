Dear friends,

I would like to get to the studies on***Niruktaslokavartikaof Nilakantha.***

I know that the work has been published from Calcutta (Ed. by Vijayapala; SrimatiSavitridevi Bagriya Trust in 1992).

Is the book available online?

From ***Indian Semantic Analysis*** written by Eivind Kahrs, I understand that K. Kunjunni Raja has written an article titled ***Niruktavarttika of Nilakantha*** in the Adyar library Bulletin in 1964 (ALB 28).

Any other articles, studies or critiques available?

Kindly help me.

Thanking you in advance.
