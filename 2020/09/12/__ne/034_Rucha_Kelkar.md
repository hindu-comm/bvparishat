Namaskar

  

This query is on similar lines; the letter is different.

  

The letter ॠ is pronounced as 'Ru' in the State of Maharashtra, while in northern and eastern parts of our country, it is pronounced as 'Ri'.

  

In case of my name, all the marathi speaking people I have communicated with pronounce as 'Rucha' while, in the northern and eastern parts of our country, it is pronounced as 'Richa' and written as 'Richa' as well. Similarly in case of ऋषी. An exception of miniscule number pronouncing close to 'Rhu' (not able to reproduce the exact transliteration).

  

What is the correct pronunciation of ऋ?

  

Further the pronunciation of any anuswaar followed by अवर्गीयव्यञ्जनानि. Should the anuswaar be pronounced as व? Are the rules different for अन्तस्थः and ऊष्माणः? Till date, I have read the roman transliteration for संस्कृत written as samskrut, sanskrit, sanskrut.

  

I am a beginner in संस्कृत language. Hence I am not aware of the rules of pronunciation.

  

Many thanks and regards

Rucha Kelkar
