\<\< Malayalam letters preserve most of the sound found in Bharatavarsha, primarily because it has got a Tamizh base and it has expanded its alphabets to fully pronounce all the Samskrtam words correctly. So it has become a super set of all the sounds of both Samskrtamand Tamizh.>\>

  

But its script is not yet fully scientific. Malayali people cannot write or pronounce properlyत् and ल्. If you write यत्, they will read यल्.
