"*The question which can be asked is why were separate script symbols drawn for the two letters क्ष and ज्ञ. Does it show that there was confusion regarding their articulation from the beginning. The two could have well be scripted as conjoint consonants reflecting each consonant as क्श, ज्+ञ.*"

  

Dear Shri Achyut Karve,

  

Your observation is interesting.

  

However, in many scripts other than Devanagari, one can easily make out the constituent k (क्) and ṣa (ष) of kṣa (क्ष), and the constituent j (ज्) and ñ (ञ) of jña (ज्ञ) as shown below:

Malayalam:

  

ക്+ഷ=ക്ഷ 

ജ്+ഞ=ജ്ഞ

  

Kannada:

ಕ್+ಷ=ಕ್ಷ 

ಜ್+ಞ್=ಜ್ಞ 

  

Telugu

క్+ష=క్ష 

జ్+ఞ=జ్ఞ 

  

Bengali:

ক্+ষ=ক্ষ 

জ্+ঞ=জ্ঞ

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
