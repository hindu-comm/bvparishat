Dear Vidwans,

  

If one wants to understand the correct articulation of a letter one can use the sutraतपरस् तत् कालस्य by puting the pratyahara letter त like कत्, खत् जत् ञत् and so on. In this way one can check whether the word one is pronouncing is being properly pronounced or not. In this way individual as well is regional idiosyncrasies can be overcome.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
