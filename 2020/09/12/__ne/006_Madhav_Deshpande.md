Dear Radhakrishna Ji,

  

  Good to know that the pronunciation of ञ and ज्ञ is preserved in Malayalam. In my teaching of Sanskrit, I have tried to pronounce it like ज+ञ, and people then look at me as if I came from Mars. In my Marathi and Hindi speaking, I just follow the regional norms in pronunciation as द्न्यान and ग्यान, so as to make myself understood.
