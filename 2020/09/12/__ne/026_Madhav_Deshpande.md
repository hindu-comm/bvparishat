Dear Narayan Prasad Ji,

  

  There has been extensive discussions on this topic which is hotly debated, but I am attaching two informative studies, one by Professor Hans Hock of the University of Illinois, Urbana, and the other by Professor Anvita Abbi of Delhi University. I have not been able to get hold of the publication in Indian Linguistics. I have many volumes of this journal, but not this one.
