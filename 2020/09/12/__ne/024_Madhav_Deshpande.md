Dear Suresh,

  

  Your explanations look very probable to me. I had thought of the presence of non-palatalized dialects of Indo-Iranian arriving in India alongside the more visible presence of the dialects that had palatalization in them. The Hindi gyāna then could be a remnant of dialects that are cognate with languages that have words like gnosis and cognition. The main problem with such an explanation is the lack of a trace of such non-palatalizeddialects in Middle Indo-Aryan dialects, namely Prakrits and Pali. Recently, a dialect representing the non-palatalized IE was evidently detected in a mountain community in Kashmir. Here is the reference:

  It has been a while since I read this article, but may be of interest to you as well. Best,

  

Madhav
