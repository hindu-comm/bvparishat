Dear Panda Ji,

  

  The written character ज्ञ phonetically stands for a combination of ज्+ञ, and it is historically neither द्न्य, ग्य or ग्न, but such are the regional pronunciations in various parts of India, and, to my knowledge,ll no region has preserved the historically accurate pronunciation as ज्+ञ. In Maharashtra it is typically pronounced as द्न्य, so for the Marathi speakers, the words ज्ञान and ज्ञानेश्वर are pronounced as द्न्यान and द्न्यानेश्वर, while in the Hindi speaking areas, it is typically pronounced as ग्यान and ग्यानेश्वर. I have heard ग्नान and ग्नानेश्वर from some speakers. Its historical pronunciation asज्+ञ justifies sandhis like तद्+ज्ञानम् \> तज्ज्ञानम्. This sandhi cannot be phonetically justified with the current pronunciation of ज्ञ as द्न्य, ग्य or ग्न.
