I don't think it had anything to do with phonetic distinctions in vernaculars.  
In the Mauryan period, Brāhmī was a new script and had probably not developed the ligatures necessary to  
represent complex consonants accurately (or the ligatures were too difficult for the average scribe  
to remember thus there was evidently some kind of orthographical simplification - simplifications that  
eventually found their way into the spoken language.

  

You will agree looking at the attached image that paññā appears much less complicated to write in Brāhmī than prajñā
