Dear Respected Prof. Madhav Deshpande Ji,

Dear Respected Prof. Radhakrishna Warrier Ji,

Dear Respected Prof. Balasubramanian Ramakrishnan Ji,

Dear Respected Prof. Venkatesh Murthy Ji,   

  

I am very thankful to each one of you for shedding light on my question. I am astounded by the great deal of deep knowledge you all possess to tackle any question on Indian language and Indian Culture.

  

What I understood, in short, the answer to my question is 'प्रादेशिक उच्चारण'.

  

I would also like to present here another answer from a vidvan (I am not giving his name, due to his will of being anonymous.)

  

" Sanskrit is the Mother of the Indo-European Language Family, including the Pali, Prakrit and the Modern Indian Languages and also many languages in the South-East Asia. So, as per Sthaan (longitudinal and latitudinal location on the globe), Kaal (time on the scale of history) and Paatra (individual idiosyncrasies and cultural baggages), people have developed their typical accents and also corrupted forms of the original language. So, people write it differently, e.g., Yadnya, Yagna, Yajna, Yagnya, Yajya, Jagya, Joggo, Jagnya, etc. etc. All these languages have preserved many words in pure forms and many words in corrupted forms. Sanskrit-nishth Hindi and other language walas pronounce 'ज्ञ' in its pure form. Even the Europeans have kept it in a bit pure form in words like 'know', 'gnostic', etc. In fact, even the regional language walas in India, write the 'ज्ञ' wala words in its pure form, but pronounce it in odd forms. Since the English alphabet is inadequate to correctly write all sorts of human and non-human sounds, they write many words in odd manners.  
  
Varsha is called Barkha in Punjabi. Shatayu Bhava is called Hatayu Bhava in Assamese. The South Indians say Pusha Vedaa, the North Indians say Pukha Vedaa, etc. You say Ganesalingam, the Tamilian says Kanesalingam. You say Mahesan, the Tamilian says Magesan. The British have kept a more expressive word for Sanskriti, that is Culture which is Kulaachaar. They have derived the word 'school' from the word 'Guru-Kool'/Kul, etc.  
  
No doubt, Prof. Chopra is a man of science. He is a professor of Chemistry. But should he complain, if you call him Prof. Kopra and his subject चेमिस्ट्री "  
  

So, I found his answer as amazing and deep-knowledge-rootedas all of yours' answers and so I decided to post his answer here.

  

Thanks, once again, to all of you for giving me knowledge.
