Radhakrishna-ji

  

I think the (mis)pronunciation of j\~na does not have to do with the disappearance of \~na. My contention is pronunciation cannot be just inferred from texts, a living tradition has to be consulted. There is nothing which says everyone pronounced j\~na the same way, even in old times. In the Vedic recitations the ja sound is barely heard in j\~na, the sound is not exactly ga but not very clearly ja either. Some modern revisionists consult phonetic texts and over stress the ja in j\~na, which sounds ridiculousto me. At least in the kR^iShNa-yajur, the conjunct j\~na is special and creates important phonological peculiarities in certain situations.

  

But I do agree with you that mispronunciation of \~na itself is endemic.
