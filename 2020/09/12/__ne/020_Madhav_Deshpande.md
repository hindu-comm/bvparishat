In theory, य् and य्ँ are semi-vowels which are described as being ईषत्स्पृष्ट, while ङ, ञ, ण, न and म involve स्पर्श of the oral organs and simultaneous opening of the nasal passage \[नासिकाविवरणादानुनासिक्यम्\]. The sounds य्ँ and ञ् are both palatal, and nasal, they share these features, with the only difference being ञ् involving full स्पर्श of the oral organs and य्ँ involving ईषत्स्पर्श. Cumulatively, the difference between these two is minor and difficult to demonstrate. This is probably the reason why the Sanskrit word अन्य corresponds to Pali अञ्ञ, and Sanskrit मन्ये corresponds to Pali मञ्ञे.
