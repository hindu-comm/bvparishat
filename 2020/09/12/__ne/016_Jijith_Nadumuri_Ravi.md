Yes, I fully agree.  

  

Malayalam letters preserve most of the sound found in Bharatavarsha, primarily because it has got a Tamizh base and it has expanded its alphabets to fully pronounce all the Samskrtam words correctly. So it has become a super set of all the sounds of both Samskrtamand Tamizh. Besides the modern speakers have preserved some Tamizh sounds like ഴ (zha) etc which the Tamizhsspeakers are now not pronouncing properly. Thus the wordTamizh (തമിഴ്) itself is pronounced as Tamil (തമിൾ ).

  

Here is a list of all letters of Malayalam (if you can see the image). Currently only 51 letters are used for all writings in Malayalam. The letters difficult for other language speakers to pronounce are circled in red.
