Dear Vidwans,

  

The question which can be asked is why were separate script symbols drawn for the two letters क्ष and ज्ञ. Does it show that there was confusion regarding their articulation from the beginning. The two could have well be scripted as conjoint consonants reflecting each consonant as क्श, ज्+ञ.

  

Are there any rules for these Sanyoga consonants in the Ashtadhyayi just as the anuswara which gives liberty to the speaker to articulate any of the nasals in its place.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
