Namaste



A conjecture on \< the standard pronunciation of ज्ञान in Marathi
\> :



1. Rajashekhara and other poeticians confirm: ” ” महाराष्ट्राश्रयां
भाषां प्रकृष्टां प्राकृतं विदुः ’ ’ The standard of Samskruth set at Maharashtra was considered the best. \[ I do not know, historically
why Benaraes was left behind in this standards setting race ! The home town of many veda- vedanta vidyaa shaastras; or Kashmir lost its charm; or Bengal leaned to tarka giving up 'language focus' !! \]





2. Maharashtrian model of ' Samskruth -Akshara-maalaa- shikshana' added ' क्ष त्र ज्ञ ' to the standard learning list of '
Primary Varna Akshara - units' . These are 'Samyukta-aksharas which Samskruh -primary resources as in Shiva Sutra push to the second level derivatives.



May be it was to socially facilitate ' Prakruth as the medium of teaching - providing introduction to Samskrutham', with an unintended consequence of ' overlapped osmosis of prakruth phonation to
Samskruth studies.
