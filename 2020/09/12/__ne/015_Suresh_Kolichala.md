Regarding jñā-, the PIE \**ǵṇneH-/ǵneH-* has been palatalized into become *jānā-/jñā-* in Sanskrit, which also been palatalized as*zānā-/ xšnāsa* in Avestan and became*dānā-/xšnās-* in Persian. But the words remained velars in Greek and Latin as *gnōscō* and became voiceless in Germanic languages as *ken/know* etc.

  

Is it possible Prakrits retained the pre-palatalization velar pronunciation, and hence*jña*is pronounced with a velar initial *gn-* in several Prakrits? Since we know several archaicismsexisted in Prakrits, is it valid to consider the velar pronunciation in modern Indian languages a remnant of the pre-palatalized speech?

  

Regards,

Suresh.
