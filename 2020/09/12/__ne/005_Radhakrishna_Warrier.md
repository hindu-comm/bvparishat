I think the inability to pronounce‡§ú‡•ç‡§û correctly is due to the inability to pronounce‡§û correctly. This is true of most parts of India. Some pronounce ‡§û as‡§Ø‡§Ç and then insist that they have pronounced it correctly üôÇ. (This is from my personal experience.)

  

In Malayalam we have not only‡§ûbut its geminate form‡§û‡•ç‡§û in many frequently used words. The very word of "I" (self) is‡§û‡§æ‡§®‡•ç . A child is a ‡§ï‡•Å‡§û‡•ç‡§û‡•Ö (ku√±√±≈≠).

  

Because‡§ûis so common in Malayalam, the average Malayali doesn't seem to find a problem in pronouncing‡§ú‡•ç‡§ûcorrectly.
