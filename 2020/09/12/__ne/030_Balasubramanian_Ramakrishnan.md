Radhakrishna-ji

  

This is similar to how a Tamil vedic reciter would pronounce j\~na, except the \~na of Tamilians or any other nasal for that fact, is as "nasalized" as that of Malayalis. My point was that the spaShTatva of the ja-kraara in a word like jyeShTha and j\~nAna are quite different in Vedic recitation. I have seen some "neo-traditionalists" trying to enunciate the ja-kaara in j\~naana after reading some phonetic texts, and this sounds absolutely bizarre, especially in Vedic recitations.

  

In the tamil itself, the word is \~nAnam, there is no ja-kAra.
