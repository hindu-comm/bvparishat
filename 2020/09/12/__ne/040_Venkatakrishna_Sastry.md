(The site <http://ancientvoice.wikidot.com/#toc2> is good. Congradulations)



1. On Samskruth -Malayalam ( / Mani-pravalam related ) pronunciation and 'Scientific : The ' Scientific -alphabet' in the context of digital technologies ( analog and digital) and Human speech and script
modes carry different frames of ' hardware and software' -
reality and virtual relaity frames. The models are connected only like object and its shadow. The advnaced neuroscience researchers are still grappling on this topic. Therefore, there is a greater need for dialgoue and unbiased exploration in this area. Pride of langauge is fine; Prjeudice is dificult to correct.



2. When science of alphabet is deliberated, the domain is Shikshaa and Pratishaakhya for Samskrutham; and human community usage in a context for rest of the languages. again there is a gap between the two frames which is to be understood better. In the statement made by you \< many individual Malayalis cancan write or pronounce properlyत् and ल्. If you write यत्, they will read यत् without any problem, but many other individual Malayalis may not be able to do that. \> If mind reads
ल् when eye feeds त् , then there has to be an intermediate process taking place. What is that ? What is science explanation of the human intervention for the experienced output ? If \< individual \> Malayali's can do it selectively and in one particular way, what has prevented others from doing it differently ?



3. There is at least one more langauge in South India , close to Malayalam which acheives this goal. It is called 'Tigalari'. The script was used for writing Samskruth in south India coastal side.



In such a case, the reframed question would be : Why and how human mind functions differently from silicon and ferrite ?
