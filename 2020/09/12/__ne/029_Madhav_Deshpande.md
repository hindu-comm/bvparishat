Thanks, Narayan Prasad Ji, for the reference to the book edited by Hans Hock and Elena Bashir. That is probably the most comprehensive up-to-date survey of linguistic studies of South Asian Language. I was Elena Bashir's Ph.D. advisor along with my colleague Peter Hook at the University of Michigan. Currently, I don't have any access to this book. Waiting for a more affordable edition to appear. I have not seen a study of how old ग्यान is in the history of Hindi, but I think it does appear in the works of Kabir, Tulsidas and in the works of saints collected in the Guru-Granths of the Sikhs. So, ग्य for ज्ञ has a history of several centuries, but I have not seen any trace of it in Apabhraṃśa and Prakrit. In Marathi, the usage of the character ज्ञ does not tell anything about its pronunciation. However, while the standard pronunciation of ज्ञान in Marathi is द्न्यान, the more vernacular references to saint ज्ञानेश्वर occur as न्यानबा, न्यानोबा, ग्यानबा, ग्यानोबाेetc. indicating that the pronunciation with ग्य or ग did exist dialectically in the Marathi speaking region.
