I think ञ has disappeared from most of the spoken languages of India.
Malayalam and Tamil are among the exceptions. I have seen the character used in written Nepali and recently, in written Magahi (spoken in parts of Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal). I am not sure if the character is used for its true pronunciation as the nasal of the "ca" varga or to represent a यं (yaṃ) like pronunciation. For example, I am not sure if the pronunciation of what is written in Magahi as नञ् is truely (nañ) or something like nayaṃ.

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
