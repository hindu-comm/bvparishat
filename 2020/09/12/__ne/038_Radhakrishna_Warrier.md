Rucha-ji,

  

In Malayalam we pronounceऋ neither as ru, nor as ri. It is a sound in between ru and ri. I think this was the ancient pronunciation ofऋ .
Else, they could have used just ri or ru. There would havebeen no need to create an additional character.

  

Click on the linkbelow to hear how we pronounce your name ऋचा. To show the difference, the words रुचा and रिचाare also pronounced.

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
