Thank you sir for pointing out the reference "In Search of Kentum Indo-Europeans in the Himalayas".

  

On p.110, it says:

"Finally, in 1993 a curious three-page report written in English was published in Puṇe, which claims that Zoller's findings have been 'confirmed' by a panel of Indian linguists.".

  

Publication details about this report are as follows:

   Zoller, Claus Peter. 1993, 'A Note onBaṅgāṇi', Indian Linguistics, Journal of the Linguistic Society of India 54 (1-4), p. 112-114.

  

Anybody having access to this report?

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
