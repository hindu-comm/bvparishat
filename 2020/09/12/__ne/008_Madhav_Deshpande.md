The history of ज्ञ and ञ is very complicated, especially since we know the description of an idealized pronunciation of Sanskrit from the Śikṣās and Prātiśākhyas, we have mostly written forms of Prakrit, and we instinctively assume that the pronunciation of the written Prakrit characters was exactly like their SSanskrit counterparts. However, that may not be entirely accurate. For example, while Pali has पञ्ञा and ञाण for Sanskrit प्रज्ञा and ज्ञान, it also has अञ्ञ for Sanskrit अन्य.
This suggests that in certain vernaculars, the phonetic distinction between ज्ञ, ञ, ञ्ञ and न्य was not that great. If such is the case with Pali, then the Marathi pronunciation of ज्ञ as द्न्य has some connection with such a Prakritic background. I have no idea how one gets from Sanskrit ज्ञ to ग्य or ग्न.
