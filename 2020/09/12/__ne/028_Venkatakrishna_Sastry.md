Namaste



Sharing some of my thoughts and unresolved questions on the following \< of ज्ञ and ञ pronuncitation \> .



1. I concur with Prof.Deshpande's observation \< we instinctively assume that the pronunciation of the written Prakrit characters was exactly like their Sanskrit counterparts. **However, that may not be entirely accurate**.> . 



2. Here is an effort to expand and peep in to varnaakshara classification for \< प्रज्ञा - पन्ना \> ::: \< ज्ञा -
ग्ना - ग्या \>. 





ज्ञा - ज्ञा (ज् +ञ् + आ ) - ( तालु+ जश्त्व + वर्गीय-तालु- अनुनासिक) - Samskruth scripting and phonation



ग्ना - ग्ना ( ग् + न् + आ) - ( कण्ठ+ जश्त्व + वर्गीय दन्त्य-अनुनासिक) - Deviant -1 - Prakruth scripting deviation



ग्या - ग्या ( ग् +य् +आ-) - ( कण्ठ+ जश्त्व + तालु- अवर्गीय - अन्तस्थ) - Secondary Deviant -2 Prakruth scripting deviation





Logic of scripting changes by Logic of varna-akshara - phonation sequence, truly scribed. **The \< प्रज्ञा - पन्ना \> is a switch in word form due to the 'langauge switch' as intended by the speaker**.
The final connotation could be same; But the **'shabda/ prakruti -shareera' has changed**. 



That ' **langauge-switch from Samskruth to Prakruth' is reflected in scripting convention**. Both प्रज्ञा - पन्ना are used for same connotation (vivkashitaartha- Taatparya) . प्रज्ञा Comes in Samskruth. and for prakruth it is पन्ना .

The rule to make a langauge -switch in reading/ interpretation from प्रज्ञा to पन्ना / Samskruth to Prakruth. The connection rule is given in Prakruth grammar.

The connection of Samskruth and Prakruth grammar has never been a question either in vedic tradition or buddhist /jains. Samskruth is the mother root of Prakrtuh.

**The rules of transition vary depending on the nature of Prakrtuh**. The next level shifts from Prakruths to apabhramsha /Desha-bhashaa/ Mlecchita are unregulated by grammar ( at least, as can be inferred from Panini, Kaatantra, Vararuchi, Hemachandra. Bhoja…).

We are not sure whether our manuscript writers used a pure 'Brahmi Paninian convention for scripting the document or a variant of prakruth.

Again we are also not sure of what ' phonation template we are using to read a given document marked with the tag 'Brahmi langauge related script ! Should Nandi nagari manuscript be read the same way as modi or other brahmi scripts ? A question to ponder over.

**More on Nandi-Nagari** : <https://omniglot.com/writing/nandinagari.htm> : The Nandinagari script was used in southern India until the 19th century. Some of earliest writing in Nandinagari are inscriptions in stone found in Mamallapuram, a town in northern Tamil Nadu, dating from the 7th century AD. It was also used in the states of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, and the official script of the Vijayanagara Kingdom (1336–1646). **Nandinagari was mainly used to write Sanskrit, and also to write Kannada in Karnataka**.





***My additional notes*** : The corrollary of Prof.Deshpande's observation are significant, leading to the questions : Are we reading the given 'samskruth manuscript with 'Samskruth phonetics per shikshaa and pratishakhya' or ' imposing the prarkrit pronunication over a document that might have been scripted using a different phnetic scripting template'? This is not uncommon even in this period, where translatierations by Hunterian convention, Harvad Kyoto convention, IPA latization with diacritics marking through unicode, priavte transltiration standrads remains unresolved; and same sanskrit text read in different scripting/ transliteration convetions yields different ' phoneme yields'. What models of 'Sanskrit' are being pushed through 'Computational linguistic studies for Indian langauges and Sanskrit' ?? What is the future shape of ' Digital Samskruth Literacy' ? This issue has a greater impact for Buddhist and Jain studies, where ' Prakrtuh Voice phonation' preservation is a tradiiton in ' Sutra recitation'. Like Vedas have aimed to preserve ' Mantra - Darshana as Yoga-Samskrutha Bhashaa smruti ' and taken to the root of ' Uccharana- anooccharana / Swadhyaaya paramparaa', Buddhists / Jains also have
preserved the ' Prakruth Oral Tradition as Buddha / Jina Vachanam'.
When Buddha-Vachana in ' Prakruth' is studied like Samskruth, without applying the needed transformations of langauge, the outcome is ' **Phonation error infused Oration of sacred text'**. **(मन्त्रो हीनः
स्वरतो वर्णतो वा .....दुष्टः शब्दः...)** The error- embedded
variant text would be branded by academic -research as 'historic variation and school based improvisation'. The scripting errors add another dimension to compound the difficulty to get back to the source.



Thus, you may notice that I am presenting this deliberation of \< The history of ज्ञ and ञ pronuncitation \> and the explanations in a different light. What ever might have been the historic practice and phonation at Panini period, it is very clear that todays reading of 'Samskruth document' has moved far away from \< idealized human- pronunciation of Samskruth>. This needs serious attention and correction. Rehashing colonial understanding of tradiiton will not resolve this issue ( for traditio, for oriental scholars, indologists, or Religion flavors of hindusim, Buddhism, Jainism.



This legacy sustains due to the removal of the learning of 'Shiva -Sutra phonation-practice as the base of Samskruth / Prakruth / desha-bhashaa Varna- akshara -maalaa uccharana shikshana> ; and added to it the resistance to restore 'Shiva sutra phonation in language teaching ! . 



Here is another identification of one more major-root- internal break down in India for language studies. We seem to have voluntarily embraced the axiom: 'Samskrutham has variations by Region- Religion and Periods'! This seems to be the most preferred trending model , socially acceptable explanation in post colonial Sanskrit study (!)
violating Panini-Patanjali Yaska and Muni-traya guidance for Samskruth study. The Panini- Muni-traya- Vedanga holds on to 'Unified language approach in Bhashaa and Chandas, without the artificial separation of ' historic layers'. Chandas is a greater yoga based refinement in phonation. Post Colonial academia and Oriental schools, and Samskruth Conversation enthusiast models prefer to push 'Divisive approach in (i) study of Samskruth using Bhashaa and Chandas,(ii) tag marking language by ritual and society usage (iii) divide in language by user classification as elite noble/Aryan and others as
down-trodden. (iv) Document interpretation for land history -people-culture of region and community using inappropriately constructed ' history' which hides the translation errors'. The
present illustration could be a case which needs deeper study for clarity to understand the pointer provided by Prof. Deshpande.



The correction to the damages caused to 'True reading of Samskruth scripted documents/manuscripts' due to this is a separate effort, needing a better understanding of several perspectives- like Samskruth phonation and scripting by conventions of ' historic writing , current social and international romanization / IPA Latinized /Romanized - phonetic modeling' simplifications ( Dilution of Samskruth through the adoption of Prakruth language model,
non-brahmi and european languages). The assessment of damage to Samskruth studies due to its disconnect from Yoga is a different dimension altogether.

I don't think it had anything to do with phonetic distinctions in vernaculars.
