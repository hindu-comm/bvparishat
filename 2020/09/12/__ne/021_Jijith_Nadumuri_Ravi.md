Dear Prasad, Namaste  

  

Unless youexplain what is meant by 'fully scientific' it is impossible to understand what you mean by 'scientific'. Are there scientificand non scientific alphabets?

  

Regional variants of pronunciationsof various letters by differentindividuals are not at all considered when we deal withthephonetic capacity and phonetic diversity of a language. So many individual Malayalis cancan write or pronounce properlyत् and ल्. If you write यत्, they will read यत् without any problem, but many other individual Malayalis may not be able to do that.  

  

Regards

Jijith
