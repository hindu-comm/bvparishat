\<\< [Standard Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Chinese), like many[Sinitic varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinitic_languages), has a significant number of[homophonous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophone)[syllables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllable)and words due to its limited[phonetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetic)inventory.>\>

With high tone: 14 different characters; with rising tone: 24; with falling and rising tone: 13; with falling tone: 51.
