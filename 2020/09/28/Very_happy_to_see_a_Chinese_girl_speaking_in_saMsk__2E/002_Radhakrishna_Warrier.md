Beautiful!This Chinese student speaks Sanskrit very nicely. Her Sanskrit pronunciation is even better than that of many Indians.

  

She compares udaatta, anudaatta and svarita with the 4 tones of Mandarin. I think they are not really the same. Meanings don't change with udaatta, anudaatta etc., but meanings of words do change if you change the tones of Mandarin words.

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
