Radhakrishna-ji

  

Thanks for the audio recordings. It is interesting - I was able to hear the differences. I guess the first was even,the first went down to up, 3rd up to down, 4th high even, but also shorter in mAtra?

  

But there is a difference in Vedic samskR^itam. Here each word has usually one udAtta (high pitch), sometimes more. All the others are technically anudAtta or low. However the anudAtta-s undergo modifications based on sandhi and what words (actually what tones come after the udAtta).. So that seems quite different from Mandarin, at least at a first glance.

  

A very simple example. One rule is the anudAtta after udAtta becomes svarita unless that anudAtta is followed by an udAtta. (Note: \_ = anudAtta, ! = svarita)

  

atha\_ + dve = atha\_ dve

atha\_+ ca_tvAri\_ = atha! ca_tvAri!

  

So the tha in atha can be anudAtta or svarita depending on what comes later. Actually if there is a vowel sandhi with a beginning akAra udAtta in the next word, it becomes udAtta after sandhi. But the meaning remains the same. In the Tamil yajur and Rk traditions there are four accents, these 3+ pracaya. The nArada shikShA records that some other yajus shAkhA-s had only 3 accents. Those are not extant now.
