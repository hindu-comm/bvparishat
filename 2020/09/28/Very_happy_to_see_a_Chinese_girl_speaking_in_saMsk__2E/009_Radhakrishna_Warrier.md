Thank youShri Bijoy Misra for your comments but they leave me perplexed.

  

Since your comments are in this thread, could you please point out the "semi-popular stories" in this thread? Also, what exactly do you mean by "semi-popular stories"? You were requesting people "to restrain in generalizations in the topics of phonemes and languages." Could you please point out in this thread where the "generalizations in the topics of phonemes and languages" occurred? You also request people "to studymore and try to put comprehensive posts as to the ability." What is a comprehensive post? How does it look like?

  

I find most posts in BVP interesting.

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
