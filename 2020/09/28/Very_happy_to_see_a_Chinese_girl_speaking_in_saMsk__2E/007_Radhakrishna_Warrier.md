Thank youall for your inputs as to how meanings can change in Sanskrit and other Indian languages based on intonation.

  

I had heard the story of Vrtra and Indrasatru a long time ago and so had to refresh my memory. It is quite educative on the necessity to maintain the appropriate intonation while speaking Sanskrit.

  

Narayan ji, I could find the book you mentioned online, and it is quite a good one. However, I could not find any discussions on udaatta, anudaatta, or svarita in the chapter and on the pages you mentioned.
The book clearly shows the svaras in print, however.

  

Shashi ji, what you say about "I shot the clerk" is interesting. One more interesting thing is to find that there is La (‡§≥) in the Shekhavati dialect. I find that Hindi speakers from the eastern parts of the Hindi belt find it difficult to pronounce‡§≥ while those from Rajasthan and Haryana find no difficulties with this sound. There is‡§≥ in Gujarati, but a large number of Gujaratis are unable to pronounce it correctly.
However, those coming from north Gujarat, from Palanpur etc., pronounce it effortlessly. Just across the border in Rajasthan is the Marwari speaking area, and Marwaris can also pronounce‡§≥ effortlessly.

  

I know quite well that in most languages, such change in meaning can happen with a mere change in intonation. Take the example of "OK". If I say "OK", it can mean I concur with what someone has just said, or it could also be a question from me whether something is OK. All the examples you all supplied fall in this category. The meanings of constituent words do not change, but the intonation changes the context and hence the sense conveyed by the words. In Indrasatru, the word meanings of Indra and satru did not change but the intonation changed the samaasa. Similar is the case with "I shot the clerk". The intonation changed it from a statement to a question.

  

When I said that in Sanskrit the word meanings do not change, I did not mean the kind of change described above. I meant the kind of change in Mandarin, an example of which is the word ma, which can have such unrelated meanings as mother, hemp, horse, or scold depending on the tone.

  

More than five years ago when I used to live in Canada, I used to attend Mandarin classes once a week taken by a colleague. Here is "ma" from my old notes. üôÇ. Note that even the Chinese logogram (i.e., Chinese written character) differs for the same word pronounced with different tones. Actually, they are not the same word; they are different words.
For the tone-deaf self, they appear to be the same word. üòÉ

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
