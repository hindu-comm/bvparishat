On a separate but similar note, tone/pitch does matter.

It even distinguishes a question from a statement.

  

In an old and very popular movie[My Cousin Vinny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCoRww3Px-g), the boy was asked in the police station as to when he shot the store clerk, he says 'I shot the clerk', and in the court later, this was given as his 'confession' when the statement was read out in the court. (Don't have the clip for the second part).

He was shocked and asked as a questions to mean 'What do you mean I shot the clerk?", but he simply said "I shot the clerk?" and the steno wrote it without ? but only .

  

The famous Indrajita example is also well known.

  

In Rajasthani, the Shekhavati dialect at least, the stress can change the meaning totally.

For example, बाळ (baaLa) =

if stress on baa (means 'a hair' or 'you burn it' (as imperative)

if stress on La, then it means continuous tense.

E.g. **baa**La de = burnit

baa**La**hai = (he/she) is burning (something)

  

On the side, the paThati and pAThayati style is also seen here.

*baa*La hai = is burning something else

*ba*La hai = is burning (something/one is on fire)
