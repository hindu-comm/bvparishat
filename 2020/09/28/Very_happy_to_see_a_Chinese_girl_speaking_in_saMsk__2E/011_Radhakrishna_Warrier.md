Dear Shri Bijoy Misra,

  

Shri Korada's posts are very informative and enlightening, and I like his posts, but unfortunately, I did not understand clearly what you want to convey through your previous post in this thread. You did not choose to enlighten us on what you meant by"semi-popular stories" and did not mention where those were in this thread. Also I did not get any clarity on your request "to restrain in generalizations in the topics of phonemes and languages" because you didn't tell us what you meant by the "generalizations in the topics of phonemes and languages" and where in this thread it occurred.

  

Anyway, I do not wish to continue this particularसंवाद with you in this thread.

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
