Friends,

  

I am sharing a video of a commencement address by Dr Vivekanand Vimal

who received a PhD degree in neuroscience from the local Brandeis University

in 2017. He was selected as the graduation speaker for his class. I met Vivek  

in 1995 in a class on culture I taught in our local Sunday culture school  

Shishubharati.  

  

You may get the flavor of youth's thinking abroad. The video is 9 min.

Vivek assists with India Discovery Center now and teaches locally.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
