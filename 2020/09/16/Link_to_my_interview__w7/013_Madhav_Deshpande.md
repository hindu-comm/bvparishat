Dear Soma Ji,

  

  Thank you. Actually, this was the first time I have given an interview like this in Hindi. I learned Hindi in school in Pune, but had no context to speak it in Pune. Now one of my daughters is married into a Hindi-speaking family, and I have to use my Hindi to speak to her in-laws. That is giving me some practice. Take care,
