Thank you, Radhakrishna Ji. I had studied Hindi in school in Pune, but there was no real opportunity to speak in Hindi. The very first time I needed to speak in HIndi was in Dec 1996, when I met the would-be in-laws of my daughter who had come to visit my parents in Pune. My mother had made Modaks. When my daughter's father-in-law asked me \[यह कैसे बनाते हैं\], I answered in my Marathi-mixed-Hindi \[यह चावल के पीठ से बनाते हैं\]. He was surprised and asked me \[क्या चावल को पीठ होती है?\]. It was then that I realized that I was using the word पीठ in its Marathi sense of flour, while it meant "back" to him. Our daughter, after her marriage, was once making Khichadi, and her father-in-law asked her: क्या हो रहा है? With her imperfect knowledge of Hindi, she replied: मैं खिचडी बन रही हूँ. So, you can see that I have come a long way in my conversational Hindi. Best,
