Well, it is chosen for that precise reason. There are many names chosen this way becausethey sound "modern", and are claimed to have Sanskrit origin and mean something. But, as Nityananda Misra has discussed in one of his videos, that is not necessarily true always. Such is the state of affairs. Mr. Rajiv Malhotra has described it as a result of our inferiority complex. I tend to agree with that description now more than before.

  

Thanks for your feedback.
