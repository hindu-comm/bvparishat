Pranam to all learned scholars,  
  
While in school we were expected to "compose" in English, but the Sanskrit curriculum had no such "composition" part. So could never venture to write even a simple sentence in Sanskrit. I feel I could try if I find a book that guides through the process and discusses the types of Sanskrit sentences.  


Secondly, we frequently come across such texts:धृतराष्ट्र उवाच। मार्कण्डेय उवाच। देवा ऊचुः ।  
  

Are these complete sentences by themselves, or part of theutterings that follow which is to be taken as "direct speech" ?  
  
If so, how do we regard: मधुसूदनः तं विषीदन्तम् इदं वाक्यम् उवाच । (गीता 2.1)  
  
regards,  
Prakash Raj Pandey
