Dear Prof. Deshpande,

  

We use a grammar book called Vyākaraṇa-kaumudī in Bengal, originally written by Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar and later modified by Durgacharan Sankhya Vedantatirtha and Satyendranath Sen, in which they provide the full declensional table of the word 'pratibhū'. They don't mention 'pratibhū' as a feminine word but they do mention feminine words of similar origin such as 'punarbhū' (a widow remarried) as well as 'varṣābhū' and 'svayambhū'.

  

They say that the words 'punarbhū' and 'prasū' are exactly like the word 'vadhū' except in accusative singular and plural forms: punarbhvam (not punarbhūm), punarbhvaḥ (not punarbhūḥ) and prasvam (not prasūm) and prasvaḥ (not prasūḥ).

  

But they explicitly mention that the feminine words 'varṣābhū' and 'svayambhū' are identical with their masculine counterpart, i.e. 'pratibhū'.

  

I am attaching the related pages from the book.
