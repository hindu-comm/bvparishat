Dear Narayan Prasad Ji,

  

  The question arose because someone asked me if the word *pratibhū* will have alternative forms similar to forms of *subhrū*, like *subhruve/subhruvai* etc. After thinking further about this question, I came to the conclusion that since we typically use the word *subhrū* in feminine, it has those alternative forms similar to *matyai/mataye*, but we typically use the word *pratibhū* "guarantor" in masculine, it will not have such alternative forms. However, if for some reason, this guarantorhappened to be a woman, then we could get the alternative forms like *pratibhuve/pratibhuvai*. I have not seen these forms in actual attestations, but in theory, this is my understanding. Does it make sense?
