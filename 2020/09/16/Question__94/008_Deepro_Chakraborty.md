Dear Dr Prasad,

  

Yes. As this book is often used as a textbook in Bengali schools the edition was revised and enlarged by many editors several times. I remember I saw my grandmother's copy and used my mother's one and when they all began to crumble I got my own. All these versions were different. I found [another version](https://archive.org/details/vidyasagar_201909/mode/2up) on [archive.org](http://archive.org). [Volume 4](https://archive.org/details/dli.bengal.10689.7411) of an older version is also available there.But none of these is the one that I have presently. I found my one pretty good as there are often references to the Pāṇinian rules. I still go to this book very often for quick references. But unfortunately, I don't find its soft copy online. But I guess a copy of it might be easily available. I see [this site](https://www.rokomari.com/book/84395/somogro-bakaron-koumudi) is selling the versionthat I have.

  

Sincerely,

Deepro
