You are most welcome, Prof. Deshpande.  
  
But according to the description of this book, no alternative forms are attested to feminine *-bhū* words. They say that the words 'varṣābhū' and 'svayambhū' are identical with its masculine counterpart which does not have these alternative forms.

  

But this is just what I see in this handbook. I haven't consulted the original rules.
