Dear Mr Deepro Chakroborty ji,  

   This Bengali edition (revised and enlarged) appears to be much better than the Hindi translation of the original available here:

     
<https://archive.org/details/samskritavyakaranakaumudiishwarchandravidyasagarsivaprasdakhannagopinathaupadhyaya_752_k/page/n67/mode/2up>

  

   BTW, is this Bengali edition availableon the internet?

   Thanks and regards

   Narayan Prasad
