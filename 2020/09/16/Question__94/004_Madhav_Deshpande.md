Thanks, Deepro, for all this information. It seems to fit my guess that the word *pratibhū* is not attested in feminine, and that alternative forms like *pratibhuve/pratibhuvai*will be possible only in the feminine gender. Someone had asked me as to why we don't see such alternative forms in grammar books.
