Namaste,

  

Yes, it is a very beautiful song. Of course, there is the legendary recording by Paluskar<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQwDaxGwI2w>

Saint Tyagaraja's many compositions are there in the same vein - Heccharikaga rara (<http://thyagaraja-vaibhavam.blogspot.com/2008/02/thyagaraja-kriti-heccharikagaa-rara.html>), alakalalla (<http://www.shivkumar.org/music/alakalladaga.pdf>). Also, Sri Annamacharya, Sri Bhadrachala Ramadasa, Puranadaradasahave many compositions on Sri Rama.

  

In fact, Sri Tyagaraja's is mostly Rama than any other!

regards......yoga
