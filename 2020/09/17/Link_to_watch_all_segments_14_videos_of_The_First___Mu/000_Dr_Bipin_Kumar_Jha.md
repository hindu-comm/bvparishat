तमेव धीरो विज्ञाय प्रज्ञाकुर्वीत ब्राह्मणः। नानुध्यायाद् बहूञ्छब्दान्वाचो विग्लापनं हि तदिति॥ बृहदारण्यकोपनिषदि 4-4-21

A wise seeker knowing should knowledge acquire, Not involving in words, understanding desire, All are mere words save the Self-realization, Only tiring of speech is all verbalization!
