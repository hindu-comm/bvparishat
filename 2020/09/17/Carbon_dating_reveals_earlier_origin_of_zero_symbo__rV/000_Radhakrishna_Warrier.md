I saw this today in a Facebook post:

  

<https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-41265057>  

[TABLE]

The article is about earlier origins of zero symbol (than previously thought).

  

My comment here is about the script. It looks much like Devanagari.
If, as the BBC article says, the manuscript is from the 3rd or 4th century CE, Devanagari is older than what it is presently believed to be.

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
