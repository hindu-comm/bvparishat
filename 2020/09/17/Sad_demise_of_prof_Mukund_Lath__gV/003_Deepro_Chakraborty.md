Thanks for commenting on it.

  

But I think Kanad here refers to our ancient ascetic traditions. In early Buddhist traditions, for example, we do find apathy toward music which they often considered as a sensual luxury. Other ancient ascetic traditions, too, were not known to have given any emphasis to music. The references you are giving are all from modern times and I don't think Kanad's article has anything against it.

  

Kanad mentioned the *nivṛtti mārga* or "the other extreme" as one of the other aspects of what you mention asthe "Sanātana Dharma". On the other hand, he fairly clarifies the role of music in our ancient religious traditions. In fact, his article begins with the story of the Pañcāla and the Kuru kings, Keśin Dārbhya and Kaupyeya Uccaiśśravas from the Jaiminīya Upaniṣad Brāhmaṇa that explains the significant role of music in our early religio-spiritual tradition. Moreover, he probably has just summarized what Mukund Lath himself wrote or thought. I see nothing wrong in it and I really enjoyed reading his article.
