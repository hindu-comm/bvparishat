Thanks for sharingthis article. It is appalling to read these lines:

  

"কিন্তু, ভারতীয় ধর্মচিন্তার অন্য প্রান্তে রয়েছে সন্ন্যাসপন্থী নিবৃত্তিমার্গ। সঙ্গীত বা কোনও ইন্দ্রিয়সুখ যেখানে মুক্তির পথে অন্তরায়। এই দুই বিপরীত মনোভাবের প্রেক্ষিতেই আবির্ভাব নতুন ধারার ধর্মীয় সঙ্গীত গান্ধর্বের। "  

  

Literal translation: "But, on the other extreme of Indian religious thought lies the *Nivritti Marga* of the *Sannyasa* path. In that, Music or any other sensual enjoyment is regarded as a hindrance on the road to liberation \['Mukti' in the original\]. It is in this context of the two opposing mindsets that the new style of religious music named Gandharva has materialised."

  

To state that an extreme of the Indic religio-spiritualculture and thought has castigated music and then to conflate Indic music with just any other sensual pleasure is to showcase crass reductionism which shows that the author has confused the Sanatana Dharma with Abrahamic religions.   

  

It is indeedhighly unfortunate to read such a misleading view being peddled through a leading daily, that too in my mother tongue Bangla, through an obituary. Ours is a tradition where Nivritti Margi-s have taken the leading role in the creation, proliferation and systematisation of the practice of music as well as its theory,often innovating in the field. From Sri Krishna Chaitanya Bharati of Bengal to Gayan Bayan-s of Assam to Swami Vivekananda-Swami Prajnanananda and today's Swami Kripakarananadaof the Ramakrishna mission, hundreds of Hindu and other Indic sannyasis have been ace musicians/musicologists.

  

Regards,

S Datta
