Dear Vishwas

The selected portions are from the Kashmirian Bhaskarakantha's BhAskarI gloss on Abhinavagupta's VimarSinI commmentary on Utpaladeva's kArikAs. See page xv: Bhaskara's commentary is in accordance with VimarSinI since there was an unbroken tradition of Shaiva philosophy. Also Bhaskarakantha wrote the gloss for "svasutabodha". These show that he followed PratyabhijnA School

Regards

Shankar Rajaraman
