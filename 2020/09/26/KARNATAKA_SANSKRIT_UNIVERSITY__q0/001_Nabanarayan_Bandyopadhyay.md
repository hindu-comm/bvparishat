Dear list members,

We are much delighted to learn that Professor K.E. Devanathan, an outstanding scholar of Sanskrit, has been appointed as Vice Chancellor of National University, Tirupati. We are very happy to heartily congratulate him and hope, the University will achieve its goal and advance rapidly under his able leadership.

With warm regards,

Nabanarayan Bandyopadhyay
