Pūrṇatrayīśa is Lord Vishnu at the Pūrṇatrayīśa Temple in Tṛppūṇittuṟa near Kochi. Lord Vishnu is installed there as Santānagōpāla mūrti.  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sree_Poornathrayeesa_Temple> .

What exactly does the word Pūrṇatrayīśa signify? Trayi refers to the first three Vedas (for some reason, the fourth Veda, Atharva Veda, is often left out when the Vedas are referred to collectively.) What is the significance of pūrṇa (=complete) here?
