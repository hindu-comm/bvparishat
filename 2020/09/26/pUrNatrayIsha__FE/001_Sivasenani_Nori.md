Sir

  

There is a wrong impression that the word 'trayee' for Veda signifies the exclusion of Atharvaveda from Veda. At best this impression was propagated due to inadequate scholarship and at worst with a mischievous intent.

  

Veda is called trayee because it has three kinds of components. Where there is a metrical arrangement, the component is called Rk (सा ऋक् यत्रार्थवशेन पादव्यवस्था। 2.1.32, Purvamimamsa॥). When the component is sung, it is called Saaman (गीतिषु सामाख्या। 33॥). Rest is Yajus (शेषे यजुश्शब्दः।34॥). This is commonly referred to as a sentence. So we have Aditya being described as ऋग्यजुस्सामपारगः in Ramayana (Adityahridayam) meaning that he is a master of all components of Veda.

  

Rigveda has predominantly Rks and hence gets the name Rigveda. Similarly Saamveda and Yajurveda. However this division does not exclude the presence of other components. So Yajurveda has both Rks and Saamans in addition to Yajus components. Atharvaveda also has these three components but is named differently.

  

Just like the Rigveda samhitaa can be thought of as having eight ashtakas or ten mandalas, these differences in names only indicate different schemes of division. There are many other schemes of division. Mimamsa talks of mantra-braahmaNa division but the latter includes aaraNyaka and upanishad portions as well. Traditional Yajurveda scholars talk of the same division as saMhitaa-paraayitam, which in turn reflects the division into karmakaaNDa and j-naanakaaNDa. In a different scheme of analysis, Vedic sentences are classified in Mimamsa as vidhi (and pratishedha), arthavaada, mantra and naamadheya.

  

One should not superimpose one scheme of division upon the other to draw false conclusions.

  

Therefore, Atharva Veda is never left out while referring to Veda.
