Shri H S Sudarshanji,

Jai Shri Ram!

Thank you for your response.

\<I see that you have taken Bhattotpala's statement "पराशरीया संहिता केवलमस्माभिर्दृष्टा न जातकम् ।" as "no Parashara Hora Shastram anywhere". It does not appear so, but that is alright.>

Not only was it not available in Bhatotpala's time i.e. in Shaka 888, but it is not available even today! This will be clear from the three attachments:

1\. BPHS Gralaghava -- the one published by Gyanasagar Press, Mumbai, and referred to by Dikshit in 1890 AD, talking about Grahalaghava Ayanamsha--by advising to take Shaka 444 as the zero year! This is the earliest available printed edition of BPHS, as on date! Obviously, somebody has published it in the name of Parashara, much after Grahalaghava of 16th century was published!

2\. BPHS-Kshemraj--This is the edition by Kshemraj Press, Mumbai, and it talks of Makaranda Ayanamsha advising to take Shaka 421 as the zero year!

As is common knowledge Acharya Makaranda wsas around in the time of Jehangir --- thus in 16th century! But still it is known as Brihat Paashara Hora Shastra by Maharshi Parashara!

3\. Sitaramjha-BPHS, published from Varanasi, in Vikrami 2003 i.e. 1946 CE by the reputed astrologer of Kashi, Pandit Sitaram Jha. He has clearly stated that he copied this work from some unknown source, made some additions and deletions of his own, and also made some additions from the manuscript of Jeevanath Jha, which was known as Parashara Hora. But so that there was no confusion with Laghu Parashari etc., he renamed it as Brihat Parashara Hoa Shastram!

Further proof of pudding is in the eating!

BPHS has talked about 36 systems of Dasha Bhuktis and the most prominent one being followed these days by 99 per cent"Vedic astrologers" is Vismhottari Daasha Bhukti, and to some extent, "Ashtotari Dasha Bhukti", though in Kashmir, my gandfather used "Yogini Dasha Bhukti" that too without any Bhukta-Bhogya!!

Ironically, in Varahamihira's astrological works, all these Dasha-Bhuktis, including Vimshottari and Ashtottari and Yogini, are conspicuous by theirabsence! Though VM claims to have been influenced by "Shakti-Purva", but his not discussing any of the earlier systems of Dasha-Bhukti in any of his works puts a question mark on these Dasha Bhuktis as to how late they evolved!!

\<I am still curious about Shri. Muralikrishna's original question, which remains unanswered.>

I have tried to answer Dr. Muralikishna'squestions as clearly as possible, without treading on anybody's toes. If, however, there are any clarifications that Dr. Muralikrishna still wants, he is most welcome to raise those points.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
