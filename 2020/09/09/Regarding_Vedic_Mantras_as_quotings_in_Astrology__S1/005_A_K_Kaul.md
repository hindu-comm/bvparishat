Shri Sapath Kumarji,

Jai Shri Ram!

\<Bhattotpala mentioned the era of (saka) of vikramaditya ,which was started in B.C,quoted in Bruhat Samhita; 8-20, so Varahamihira is not in salivahana era.>

Vikrami era and Shalivahana Shaka era were one and the same thing for quite some time starting in 78 AD. This will be clear from the attachment Vikrami=Shaka, as clarified by none other than Bhaskaracharya-II in his Siddhanta Shiromani. He has also minced no words in clarifying the statement of Bhatotpalathat it was the same Sahka era that the latter was talking about.

As per "Prashna-adyaya" 48, Bhaskaracharya-II was born in Shaka 1036 and had completed Siddhanta Shiromani when he was 36 years old.

If we take Shaka era as starting in 550/551 BCE, that means Bhaskaracharya would have been around in about fifth/sixth century AD!

VM has talked about the epoch of Romaka Sidhanta as सप्ताश्विवेद संख्यम (724 = 427 --अङ्कानाम् वामतो गतिः ) in hisPanhasiddhantika and by adding 78 to the same we get his date as 505 AD. (Attachment Brihat Samhita Soma-Divasah)

In confirmation of this date, we can check his other details:

1. Varahamihira has talked about Aryabhata in his Panchasiddhantika(attachment VM date) who was around in -3101+ 3600 = 499 AD (attachment AB Date). This could have happened only if Varahamihira was either a contemporary of Aryabhata or the latter had been earlier than the former, which means Aryabhata should have been around at least 500 years before 499 AD the if Shaka era had started in 550 BCE!

2\. There have been some efforts in the past by some people to push Shaka era to 505 BCE and so on as will be clear from the attachment "Shaka".

This is a page from the "Collected Papers on Jyotisha" by T S Kuppanna Sastry (Kendriya Samskrit Vidyapeeth--Tirupati 1989) where he has said

Quote

It is only too true that unconcsiousprejudice has had some hand in writing the history of our land.

Unquote

Thus there is one and only one Shaka era for astronomical works of India, and that is the one that startedin78 AD.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
