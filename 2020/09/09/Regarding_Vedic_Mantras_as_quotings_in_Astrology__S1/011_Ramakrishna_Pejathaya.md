Dear Kaul ji,

  

Pranams.  

  

In your first response,you have concluded as -

  

I must repeat here for the umpteenth time that because of the "nirayana-Vedic astrology" we are thus celebrating all our fasts, fairs, festivals and muhurtas on such days as have neither any sanction from the Vedas, nor Purana nor any shaastra, nor even any astrological works of yore!  

  

Here are my comments on this -

None of the texts you mentioned directly say that we must followthesaayana method in our fasts etc. It's the तर्क of the researchers based on some references available somewhere in these texts (I am not going to elaborate). So let mepresenta तर्क to follow nirayana in these cases based on some references from these texts only.

 

1\. ''Ayanamshasadhanam'' cannot be seen in the Spasthadhikara in any of the Siddhanta texts . It is placed in Triprashnadhikara or somewhere else in these.

Bhaskaracharya clearly says at the beginningof the spashtadhikara that यात्राविवाहोत्सवजातकादौ खेटैः स्फुटैरेव फलस्फुटत्वम्, which means if we get the planetary positionsaccuratethen only we get the real fruit of यात्रा, विवाह, जातक and so on. But in hiswork also spashtadhikara doesn't contain the ayanamshacorrection.

Based on this we can understand that ayanamsha correction is not needed in the grahas for the rituals, horoscopes, and muhurtas.

  

2\. While stating the प्रयोजन of the ayanamsha, Soorya siddhanta says, तत्संस्कृताद् ग्रहात् क्रान्तिच्छायाचरदलादिकम्. It means ayanamshacorrection must be done when you take a grahasphuta to compute क्रान्ति लग्न and all. So the purpose of the ayanamshais limited to these things only here.   

  

3\. In Brihajjatakam also Mihira says 'मेषाश्विप्रथमा नवर्क्षचरणाश्चक्रस्थिता राशयः' where he mentioned the Ashwini nakshatra as the starting point of the Rashi chakra. (If you don't accept this, the 'अश्वि' becomes व्यर्थ here.) It cannot be correct in the saayana system.

  

I believe these references are good enoughto understand that our tradition accepted the nirayana graha-s only to determine the Muhurtas, Rituals, and Horoscopes.

  

When it comes to the ayana matter (Uttarayana and Dakshinayana) I accept your argument. We can find many references from the Vedas and Vedanga Jyotisha which indicate (don't state directly though!) that they used to followthe saayana system. But this cannot be taken into all cases as I explained in the beginning.

  

Regards,

Ramakrishna
