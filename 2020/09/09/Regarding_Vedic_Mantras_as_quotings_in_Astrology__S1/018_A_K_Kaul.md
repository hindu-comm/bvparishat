Respected Dr. Ramakrishna Pejathaya,

Rama-Krishnaya Namah!

This is the second part of my mail in response to your views about "Ayanamsha Sadhanam" in "Triprashna-Adhikaaram" of various siddhantas.

\<1. ''Ayanamshasadhanam'' cannot be seen in the Spasthadhikara in any of the Siddhanta texts . It is placed in Triprashnadhikara or somewhere else in these.

Bhaskaracharya clearly says at the beginningof the spashtadhikara that यात्राविवाहोत्सवजातकादौ खेटैः स्फुटैरेव फलस्फुटत्वम्, which means if we get the planetary positionsaccuratethen only we get the real fruit of यात्रा, विवाह, जातक and so on. But in hiswork also spashtadhikara doesn't contain the ayanamshacorrection.

Based on this we can understand that ayanamsha correction is not needed in the grahas for the rituals, horoscopes, and muhurtas.\>

****

The Alpha of the siddhantic astronomy in India is the "Shri Surya Siddhanta" and the Omega is either "the Siddhanta Shiromani" of Bhaskaracharya-II (12th century CE) or as some people would like us to believe, the "Siddhanta Darpan" of Samanta Chandra Shekhar also known as Pathani Samanta of late 19th century.

As not everybody is aware about the genesis of the SS, it is worthwhile to discuss it's "*janma-kundali*" first.  

***How old is the "Shri Surya Siddhanta"?***  

In my intermediate Physics course, we had an option of two physicstext-books ---one by H R Sarna and the other by "xyz". Though the then-booksellers in Srinagar would like us to buy the book by xyz,
but our PhysicsProfessor, late D N Kaw, advised us to buy the Sarna book. He explained that it was the latest edition, containing all the latest additions-alterations plus its language was very simple and easy to understand. So we got that book and were very happy with the same.

Later on "The Surya Siddhanta" was prescribed as a text bookof astronomyin my Shastri-examination days in the same J & K University, and we had it with the "Sudha Varshini" commentary of Pandit Sudhakar Dwivedi.

For phalita, we were prescribed "Brihaj-jaatakam" by Varahamihira with the commentary of Bhatotpala.  

When we asked for an optional book for the SS, our Panditji was categorical that we had no other option as it was an "*aarsha* work" by none other than Surya Bhagwan and that is why it had been prescribed as a text book!!  

I had seen a "Surya Siddhanta" in the collection of my grandfather's books, since he had cleared his Shastri examination from the Punjab University much before me, as there was no separate university in J & K for such exams then. But I do not recall as to which commentary that SS had.

My grandfather and later on my father also called it "Shri Surya Siddhanta" and considered it to be the ancient most *"aarsha* work".

As I had been a science student and since I was born and brought up in a highly orthodox family, in order to be familiar with the cultural ethos, I had opted for Samskrit exams as all the knowledge of ancient India, especially the history of the Hindu community and all our scriptures including the Vedas were in that very language.

To start with, it was a great "revelation" to me when the very first few shlokas of the SS claimed that the astronomical principles of that work had been "revealed" by none other than Surya Bhagwan to a king of demons named Maya Mahasura------ and that too as many as more than 21 lakhs of years back!-----after the latter had performed penance for god only knows how long: (Attachment SS-1-BDS).

Earlier I had read Smart's "Text Book of Spherical Astronomy" and obviously, it did not have such a hyperbole introduction!

But then how old the SS is really, we shall see it later!

***How old is the Universe as per the SS***

Then in the very first chapter we are given the duration of different yugas, Chaturyugas, Manvantaras and finally the total age of a Kalpa---a day of Brahmaji, then His span of life, and how many years of His life are already over and finally we are told the date of creation of the present Kalpa--**-the creation of the present Universe---ब्रह्माण्ड---consisting of literallycountless****expanding****galaxies----- (and not just the earth!)** as 1,953,720,000 solar years back till the date of the advent of Maya Mahasura i.e. the end of the last Krita-Yuga!

This includes the number of 17,064,000 solar years that it took Brahmaji to create "planets, stars, gods, demons and the animate and inanimatecreation" as per 1/24 of Maanadhyaya, the very first chapter! (Attachment SS-yugas-BDS)

ग्रहर्क्षदेवदैत्यादि सृजतोSस्यचराचरम् \| कृताद्रिवेदा दिव्याब्दाः शतघ्णा वेधसो गताः

That means as on the first date of (Vikrami) New Year of 2020 AD, the age of the Universe as per the SS is 1,953,720,000 years till the end of last Krita Yuga, plus 1296000 years of Treta Yuga+ 864000 years of Dwapara Yuga, plus 3101+2020 years of the current Kaliyuga =1972995121 years. This is also known as "Srishti Samvat" and is used in the daily "Samkalpa" etc. We can also say that it is about 1.97 billion years as per short scale.

***What is the real "SrishtiSamvat" as per moderm sciences?***

During my student days, there were no computers, not even ordinary calculators, not to speak of electronic and that too scientific calculators! Internet was an unheard of and quite an unknown and even unimaginable "commodity". Thus for quite a long time I could not check then as to how far our "Srishti Samvat" was correct, but I was told by my teacher that it was much better than the British Srishti Samvat which was not even 6000 years old as it was said to be about 4000 BCE as per the Holy Bible. He even emphasized that Bhagwan Ram had Incarnated after about 16 lakhs of years of the Surya Siddhanta.  

However, with the passage of time, I kept on looking for the "correct Srishti Samvat" and ultimately, found it to be much more than that of the SS. The "Big Bang" is supposed to have taken place about 13.7 billion years back as per "A Briefer History of Time" by Hawking and Mlodinow, as against 1.97 billion years of the SS! (Attachmen Big-Bang-date).

That means the real Srishti Samvat is ''about 13.7 billion years" (which is about seven times" more ---older!--- than the SS Srishti Samvat") and not the one that we are repeating in our "Samkalpa" day in and day out!

Even our mother earth--- an insignificant and infinitesimally small speck vis-a-vis the "Universe" of the SS is 4.5 billion years old which means more than twice the "age of the universe" of the SS!

***Was the SS "revealed" really more than 21 lakhs of years back?***

The same Stephen Hawking and Mlodinow tell us on page 17 of the much discussed work*The Grand Design*

"Our species, Homo Sapiens, originated in Africa around 200000 BC."

That means even the mankindin its present form was not around before then, so how could Mayasura have received the knowledge of the SS 21 lakhs of years back as it is more than ten times the ''age of the mankind"?

The same Stepehen Hawking also tells us on the same page, ''Written language dates back only to about 7000 BC" (Attachment Age-of-Homo-Sapiens).

Even our own Vedic scholars like B. G. Tilak puts the earliest date to the Vedic lore as 10000 BCE!

That means there never was any Mayasura around nor could any astronomical work have been revealed in such a distant past!

Obviously, we have been taken for a ride by some one and it is our duty to find out as to why he/she did so!       

***The mean orbital elements/rvolutions of the SS are neither scientific nor based on any scripture!***  

And finally, the much awaited number of planetary revolutions----in a Mahayuga i.e. Chaturyuga of 4320000 solar years---a really mind boggling figure as -----at the rate of one revolution भगणः per year as that of the Sun and so on.

And the mean longitudes of all the planets are supposed to have been zero at the starting date and time---i.e. more than twenty-one lakhs of years back----with almost all of them having been conjunct the Star अश्विनी Alpha Arietis at the end of the Revati division of (27 equal divisions) of nakshatras पौष्णान्ते भग्नः स्मृतः (1/27).

But about all that in the next mail!

With regards and Rama-Krishnaya Namah!
