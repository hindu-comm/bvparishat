Respected Dr. T. Muralikirshna,

Shri-Krishnaya Namah!

Thank you for your response, since unless I get some feedback, I am unable to proceed further.

\<If astrology or astronomical things are derived from vedas (which may be samhita, brahmana, aranyaka or upanishat), then they should have quoted the veda mantras for every principle/some principles. But we are not getting (or a few commentators might have quoted the veda mantras) any quotes of veda mantras from varaha to kamalakara.>

I have already clarified it in my earlier mail that we do not find any references to Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis----whether Sayana or nirayana---- in the Vedas and the Vedangas at all. In fact, till the advent of the Surya Siddhanta of Pancha-Siddhanta, a work of 505 CE, no other "Siddhanta" or any other astronomical work talked of calculating planets vis-a-vis Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis!

We must also ponder on the fact as to which shastra, if any, has advised us to consult some soothsayer and for what purpose, if any at all!

As we have seen it already, in spite of calling predictive astrology as "Vedic", none of the Vedas nor any of the Vedangas has done so.

***Manusmriti is against astrology etc.***

In your earlier mail, you had said that Vrahamihira had said that "Manu" had written some astrological work. But it certainly must be some other Manu than Manu the Law-giver, who is totally against any astrolatory in the following words 3/162

हस्ति गो अश्वोष्ट्रदमको नक्षत्रैर् यश्च जीवति ! पक्षिणां पोषको यश्च युद्धाचार्यस्तथैव च !! (Attachment Nakshatra-jeevi)  

This shloka in the Manusmriti is actually in the context about as to which people areto be debarred from performing daivaand pitrya karyas i.e. yajnyas etc for gods andoblations etc. for the Manes,and the Manu has said unequivocally "Trainers ofelephants, cows, horses; ANYONE WHO EARNS HIS LIVELIHOOD BY DINT OFNAKSHATRAS and one who puts birds into cages are not allowed to perform any *daiva*or *pitra karya*".

In 6/50, the same Manu has strictly advised a sanyasi/Vanaprastha (anyone who has left his home and hearth for realizing the Ultimate) to strictly avoid earning his/her livelihood by "checking the nakshatras"(Attachment Nakshatra-soochee)

न चोत्पात निमित्ताभ्यां न नक्षत्राङ्ग विद्यया\| नानुशासनवादाभ्यां भिक्ष्यां लिप्सेत कर्हिचित् \|\|

A recluse must not try to earn his "*biksha*" by dint of forecasting from earthquakes etc. nor from the "*nimittas*" of throbbing of eyes, nor through (Ashvini etc.) nakshatras, nor through palmistry nor by sermonizing about policy matters nor by explaining the meaning of
shastras".

***Bhishma has disparaged nakshatra *soochi/jeevi****

Similarly, Bhishma Pitamaha has literally equated "*nakshatra-soochis*" as "Chandaalas" even if they are Brahmins, in Shanti-Parva 76/64 (Attachment Brahmana-Chandala)

आह्वयकाः देवल्काः नाक्षत्राः ग्राम याजकाः \| एते ब्राह्मण चाण्डालाः महा पथिक पञ्चकाः\|\|

“Court bailiffs, pujaris of temples for the sake of money, those who studynaksahtras (jyotishis!)…are *chandala*s even if they are Brahmins (and must beexcluded from daiva and pitrya karya)”.

***Gautama the Buddha was against astrology***

Gautama the Buddha is said to have cautioned his disciples against astrologers very sternly. (Attachment CRC-Report on astrology)

Similarly, Vishnugupta Kautiliya a.k.a Chanakya has minced no words in cautioning a king against astrology in the following words  

Quote

The objective eludes the foolish man who enquires too much from the stars. The objective should be the nakshatra of the objective, of what avail are the stars"

Unquote

***Maharshi Dayananda Saraswati was dead against astrology:***

How in the name of *Graha-peeda-nivarana* through Vedic-Mantras people are being taken for a ride will be clear from the attachment from "the Rigveda Bhashya Bhoomika" of Maharshi Dayananda Saraswati!

***Manu has advised kings to act (and not to consult astrologers!)***

It is claimed that kings must consult jyotishis for advice but theManusmriti 7/106 has advised a king (Attachment Manusmriti Raja-dharma)

Quote

"Like a kingfisher eager to hunt some fish in the river/sea/lake, a king mustconcentrate on increasing his wealth (a kingfisher does not consult soothsayers beforepecking at the fish!). A king must jump on his enemy like a lion jumps on its prey(lions do not consult ‘astrologers’ before jumping on their preys). Like a wolf aking must kill his enemy even if it is hidden in a fort (No astrologer has as yet claimedthat he was consulted by some wolf!). Like a hare, a king must know how to extricatehimself from tricky situations (Does anybody know if any rabbit has consulted somejyotishi?)"

***Regarding "bghagya versus purusharth", this is what the Manu has said,***  

*Naatmanam avamanyeta parvabhir abhisamridhibhih।*

*Aamrityoh shriyam anvishyet**nainam manyeta durlabam,…* (Manusmirit 4/137) i.e.

"If in spite of making efforts, one is not able to earn the desired amount of wealth,one must in no case feel himself/herself unfortunate but continue to make efforts tillthe end of his/her life, since it is not that difficult to earn wealth (by making properefforts)" ---No planetary propitiation has-been advised!

**The real crux of fate versus efforts has been described by the Manu in 7/205**  

*Sarvam karmedam aayattam vidhanedaiva manushye।।*

*tayor daivam achintyam tumanushe vidyete kriya।।*

"What good or bad deeds have been done in our past births are in the hands of'*daiva*'. What (good or bad deeds) we do now in this birth is up to us. Sincewhat is past is past. It need not be pondered upon. But the present can certainly betaken care of (and as such, we should forget the past janmas and concentrate on ourdeeds in this janma)

To remove any doubts further from the minds of astro-buffs, the Manu has definedpurushartha as follows:

*alabdham chaiva lipsyet labdham rakshyet prayatnatah।।*

*Rakshitam vardhayet chaiva**vridham paatreshu nikshipet।।*

*Etachchaturvidham vidyaat purushartha prayojanam।।*

*Asya nityam anushthanam**samyak kuryat atandritah*” 7/99-100

“One must attempt to obtain what he/she has not obtained yet. He/she mustpreserve what he/she has already earned, and keep on increasing it further. Afterhaving increased it, he/she should utilize (invest) it properly. These are the four limbs/types of purushartha and one must always keep them inmind and act accordingly (and not waste his/her time and wealth and energy byrunning after nakshatra-soochis!)”.

**Bhishma also did not believe in bhagya (and therefore nakshatra-soochis!)but in purushartha:**

*utthanenna sada putra prayatetha yudishthira।।*

***Na hi utthaanam rite daivam rajnyam artham prasadayet।।(*Rajdharmanushasana parva65/14)

“Dear son Yudishthira, you must always rely on your own efforts since without yourown efforts there is no question of any daiva (bhagya) bestowing any riches on anyking”

*“vipannam vai samaarambhe santaapam ma sma vai krithah।। Ghattasvaiva**sadaatmanam rajnyam eva paro nayah।।*

( Rajadharmanushasana parva 65/16)

“If you are besieged by miseries, do not feel despondent. To struggle with adversities(without consulting soothsayers!) is the only way out for a king to come out of those problems".

**All the dharmashastras are against nakshtra-schoochis/jeevis:**  

It is not only the Manusmriti and the Mbh or Yogavasishtha but every dharmashastrahas castigated vociferously such “*brahaman chandalas”*

Atri Samhitai 383-385 says (Attachment Atri-Samhita)

“*jyotirvido hyatharvanah keerah**pauran-pathakah।।**Shraadhe yajnye mahaadaane na varneeyah kadaachana।।*

*Shradhancha pitaram gauram**daanam chaiva tu nishphalam \|Yajnye cha parihanih syattasmat tan parivarjayet ।।*

*Aavkashchitrakarashchai vaidyo nakshatra pathakah\|\| Chatur vipraa na pujyantebrihaspati samah yadi*

“A JYOTISHI, AN ATHARVANA, ONE WHO NARRATES PURANAS FOR A LIVELIHOOD,ALL THESE ARE TO BE AVOIDED IN A SHRADHA AS WELL AS A YAJNYA AT ALLCOSTS. IF THESE PEOPLE DO PARTICIPATE IN SHRADHAS ETC. ALL SUCH SHRADASAND ANY CHARITIES TO THEM WILL BE NISHPHALA I.E. FRUITLESS. THEY WILL DOMAXIM HARM TO ANY YAJNYA IN WHICH THEY PARTICIPATE. THEY MUSTTHEREFORE BE AVOIDED AT ALL COSTS……A BRAHMIN WHO IS A NAKSHATRAPATHAKA I.E. ONE WHO READS NAKSHATRAS OF HIS CLIENTS HAS TO BE SHUNNEDAND AVOIDED EVEN IF HE IS AS LEARNED AS BRIHASPATI, THE PRECEPTOR OFGODS ”.

It is worthwhile to note that the “Atharva Veda Parishishita” has advised to utilize theservices of an Atharvana without fail whereas Atri Rishi has advised that anAtharvana, even if he is as well-read and intelligent as Brihaspati, has to be shunnedlike a “chandala”

***The choice is ours!***

To sum up this long mail, Varahamihira has advised us to treat even *mlechhas* as Rishis -- like "Vamadevas"!----if they know astrology (i.e. if they have read Sphujidwaja's Yavana Jatakam or Minarajas Vriddha Yavana Jatakam etc.,) whereas Manu the law-giver, Bhishma the Beacon-light of the Kuru-Vamsha, and Atri Rishi advise us that a "nakshatra-soochee or nakshatra jeevi" must be treated as Chandala even if he is a well read Brahama like Brihaspati!

Maharshi Dayananada Saraswati, a real scholar of the Vedic lore as well as yogi par-excellence concurs with the Manu and Bhishma and Atri and so on! He has callede janma-patri a शोक पत्री, a death- knell (Attachment Satyarth)

The choice is certainly ours as to whether we should go by what Varahamihira advised or what the real seers like the Manu, Bhishma, Maharshi Vasishtha, Chanakaya, Atri and last but not the least, Rishi Dayananda Saraswati have advised!

The parting shot is that Vishvamitra Rishi, instead of doing such a great pencance for becoming a Rishi, should have read some astrological books and he would certainly have been worshipped like a Rishi---like "Vamadeva"!

With regards and Jai Shri-Krishna!

PS

I am not an Arya Samaji but hold Maharshi Dayanand Saraswati in great esteem for his knowledge of the Vedas and his Yoga, above all his fearlessness.
