Respected Dr. Ramakrishna Pejathaya,

Rama-Krishnaya Namah!

Many thanks for your mail.

\< None of the texts you mentioned directly say that we must followthesaayana method in our fasts etc. It's the तर्क of the researchers based on some references available somewhere in these texts (I am not going to elaborate). So let mepresenta तर्क to follow nirayana in these cases based on some references from these texts only.>

My "conclusion" was

Quote

I must repeat here for the umpteenth time that because of the "nirayana-Vedic astrology" *we are thus celebrating all our fasts, fairs, festivals and muhurtas on such days as have neither any sanction from the* **Vedas, nor Purana nor any shaastra, nor even any astrological works of yore!**

Unquote  

Instead of quoting any "pramanaas" from any of the Vedas, or Puranas or any Shastra, or even any astrological work that has advised to celebrate Makar Samkrantion any other day than the shortest day of the year, or Mesha Samkranti on any other day than the day of Vernal Equinox or Karkata Samkranti on any other day than the Summer Solstice or Tula Samkranti on any other day than the Autumn Equinox and so on, you have just said "it is the तर्क of some researchers based on some references available somewhere" andswitched over to "Triprashna-Adhikara" of the Surya Siddhanta advising to make Ayanamsha corrections!

I have been quoting original works like Bhagavata Puraua, Vishnu Purana, Vishnu-dharmottara-Purana, Yogavasistha-Maharamayana, Vamana-Purana Tantraloka of Acharya Abhinavguupta and so on in support of the unpleasant fact that we are really celebrating all our festivals, whether it is Makar Samkranti, or Adhika-masa or Khara-masa or Dhanur-masa and so on wrong days, and not the तर्क of some researchers.

I am posting below a copy of my mail---after some minor editing---to this very august forum on December 17, 2017 as to how we are celebrating all the festivals on wrong days, It also answers your question about nakshatras-vis-a-vis Rashis.

The following original proofs are also being attached:

1. Vishuva=Mesha from Vishnudharmottara-Purana, that has advised to club Vishuva i.e. Vernal Equinox with Mesha Samkranti and so on and Madhu with Chaitra and so on.

2\. Vishnu-Purana---As to how Makar Samkanti is to be celebrated on the shortest day of the year and so on.

3\. Tantra-Aloka--As to how the one and only Acharya Abhinavgupta clubbed Mesha Samkranti with Vishuva and so on.

4\. Vamana Purana--Karkata Samkranti is none other than the longest day of the year!

5\. Nirayana Adharma---A detailed discussion by the Saha Calendar Reform Committee as to how the Nirayana Panchanga-makers (like Rashtriya Panchanga, the Arsha Panchangas, Vakya Panchanga and so on) are committing the entire Hindu society to Adharma!

It has given in a detailed manner the order of the solar and lunar months vis-a-vis the seasons in the Vedas!

6\. Bhagavata Purana, with 11 commentaries, where all the commentators whether Shreedhara Swami, or Shri Jeeva-goswami or Shri Veera-Raghavacharya and so on confirm in one voice that Mesha Samkranti is the day of Vernal Equinox, Makar Samkanti the shortest day of the year and so on as per the Srimad Bhagavata!

Similarly, all of them have also confimred in one voice that Ashvini, Bharni etc. nakshatras were clubbed with the so called Sayana Rashis by Srimad Bhagavata!

Same is the case with Vamana Purana!

I hope you don't want us to believe that whether it was Krishna Dvaipayana Veda-Vyasa, or his father Maharshi Parashara or or all the commentators and translators of these Shastras, or even if it was none other than Acharya Abhinagupta himself, they were all "some researchers" (and we need not take their words seriously!?)

Regarding the Surya Siddhanta etc., I will discuss it in my next mail, as this one has already become very long.

With regads and Rama-Krishnaya Namah!
