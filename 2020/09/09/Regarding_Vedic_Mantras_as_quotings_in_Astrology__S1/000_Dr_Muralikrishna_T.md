समूहेस्मिन् लसद्भ्यः विद्वद्भ्यः मदीयाः प्रणामाः,

  

In astrology (ज्यौतिषम् i.e. सिद्धान्तः+संहिता+होरा) we see the quotes of many astrologers like varahamihira who mention about Satyacharya, Vishnugupta, Jeevasharma, Devaswami, Siddhasena etc in Brihajjatakam. Whereas in Brihatsmhita varahamihira mention the name of Vriddhagarga, Garga, Parashara, Kashyapa, Rishiputra, Devala, Brihaspati, Nandeeshwara, Manu etc. Right now, we are not able to trace theier works easily (Editing of Vriddha Garga Samhita is under process at Jain University, Banglore under the guidence of Sri R N Iyengar).

  

Varahamihira said that ''मुनिमतानि निरीक्ष्य'' i.e After verifying the principles of many sages he writes his own view.

  

Many reserchers mention that Astrology, Vastu principles, Mathematics are originated from same root I. e. Veda (Bharati Krishna Teertha has written that he has taken the sutras from atharvaveda to derive Vedic Maths Sutra)

  

‌We already know that a veda learner should learn veda and vedangas with its meaning (may be it is said by Yaska).Vedas are also learnt by Brahmana, Kshatriya and Vaishyas. Most of the Astrologers or astronomers of India were belong to any of these three varnas.

  

But my question is that If astrology or astronomical things are derived from vedas (which may be samhita, brahmana, aranyaka or upanishat), then they should have quoted the veda mantras for every principle/some principles. But we are not getting (or a few commentators might have quoted the veda mantras) any quotes of veda mantras from varaha to kamalakara.

  

I am eager to know about this....
