Dear Dr. T. Muralikrishna,

Jai Shri Ram!

\< In astrology (ज्यौतिषम् i.e. सिद्धान्तः+संहिता+होरा) we see the quotes of many astrologers like varahamihira who mention about Satyacharya, Vishnugupta, Jeevasharma, Devaswami, Siddhasena etc in Brihajjatakam.>

None of the "astrologers" mentioned by Varahamihira is a Vedic Rishi!

\< Whereas in Brihatsmhita varahamihira mention the name of Vriddhagarga, Garga, Parashara, Kashyapa, Rishiputra, Devala, Brihaspati, Nandeeshwara, Manu etc.>

Bhatotpalahas quoted certain verses from Garga and Kashyapa etc. in his comentariesin Shaka 888 but he had lamented thatParashara Hora Shastra was not available anywhere! The half a dozen Paasharis that are floating around are only by namesake Parasharas, since the realMaharshi Parashara has not claimed anywhere that he had written any book on predictive astrology!

\< Varahamihira said that ''मुनिमतानि निरीक्ष्य'' i.e After verifying the principles of many sages he writes his own view.>

VM has declared in Brihatsamhita2/32

म्लेच्छा हि यवनास्तेषु सम्यक् शास्त्रमिदं स्थितम् \| ऋषिवत्तेSपि पूज्यन्ते किं पुनर्दैवद विद् द्विजः \|\|

Though Yavanas are *mlechhas* but as this shastra (of astrology) is well established in them, i.e. they have got/receivedit from their ancestors, that is why they are respected/worshipped like Rishis, so no wonder if a ''twice-born" knowing this shatrais respected! (Translation in accordance with Bhbatotpala's commentary).

So VM was influenced a lotby Yavanas i.e. the Greeks since predictive astrology is not of Indian origin! Thus even the Greek astrologers were Rishis according to VM.

\< Many researchers mention that Astrology, Vastu principles, Mathematics are originated from same root I. e. Veda (Bharati Krishna Teertha has written that he has taken the sutras from atharvaveda to derive Vedic Maths Sutra)>

There are neither Mesha etc. Rashis, whether so called Sayana or so called Nirayana, nor Mangal, Shani etc. planets, much less the much dreaded "Rahu" ---the lunar node---a mathematical point of zero dimensions----in any of the four Vedas, or the Vedanga Jyotisha available as on date, though there are passing references to planets in the Atharva Veda, but no Mesha etc. Rashis.

We find mention of Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis times without number in the Puranas ---- though neither in the Mahabharata nor in the Valmiki Ramayana---but they are all seasonal---so called tropical with zero Ayanamsha!

Similarly, we do not find any mention of---much less praise of---predictive astrology in any of the Vedas. Thus to call predictive astrology----that too the ''almighty" Lahiri-Rashcihakra-astrology--- as "Vedic astrology" is against the letter and spirit of the Vedas!

If at all any type of astronomy---and to some extent predictve astrology---deserves to be called as "Vedic astrology"----that too as a conditional "Panchama-Veda" astrology, it is the so called sayana astrology, as that is the Rashichakra advocated ----without any exception---by the Puranas!

\< But my question is that If astrology or astronomical things are derived from vedas (which may be samhita, brahmana, aranyaka or upanishat), then they should have quoted the veda mantras for every principle/some principles. But we are not getting (or a few commentators might have quoted the veda mantras) any quotes of veda mantras from varaha to kamalakara.>

A few decades back, the Nirayana system of predictions being followed in India was known as ''Hindu astrology" or even as ''Indian astrology".
It started being called as "Vedic astrology" very lae in the day so as to make it gain a foothold in overseas countries.  
Nobody can therefore quote any Vedic manstras about predictive astrology since the real Vamadevas never had such a "fad".

It is worthwhile to mention here that leave alone the Puranas and the Siddhantas, right from the Surya Siddhanta to Siddhanta Shiromani, even astrologers like Bhatotpala of Shaka 888 (tenth century CE) and Bhaskar Yogi of about 16th century, the two commentators of Brihat-Samhita, had no idea that there could be a nirayana Rashi-Chakra much less nirayana Makar and Karkata Samkrantis, as will be evident from their commentaries, attached herrewith!

*That is why I call this nirayana fad as niraadhaar!*

I must repeat here for the umpteenth time that because of the "nirayana-Vedic astrology" we are thus celebrating all our fasts, fairs, festivals and muhurtas on such days as have neither any sanction from the Vedas, nor Purana nor any shaastra, nor even any astrological works of yore!

Can there be anything more ironic than the same in the name of "Vedic astrology"?

Withr egards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
