Respected Sir,

My question is very simple --

Kindly read the last para of my question. (Just I have quoted some facts to support this question.)

If astrology or astronomical things are derived from vedas (which may be samhita, brahmana, aranyaka or upanishat), then they should have quoted the veda mantras for every principle/some principles. But we are not getting (or a few commentators might have quoted the veda mantras) any quotes of veda mantras from varaha to kamalakara.

Withregards,

Dr.Muralikrishna T
