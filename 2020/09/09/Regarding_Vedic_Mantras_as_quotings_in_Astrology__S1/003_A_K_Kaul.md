Shri H S Sudarshanji,

Jai Shri Ram!

Thank you for your response.

\<Bhatotpalahas .. in his comentariesin Shaka 888 .. had lamented thatParashara Hora Shastra was not available anywhere!

This is interesting to know. Can you please point out where is this from?\>  

As per the attachment Dikshit-Parashari-1, S B Dikshit had quoted Bhatotpalathat he was unable to find Parashari! Similarly, Dikshit himself was very sore that the Parashari that was available during his time could not be by Parashara at all, since it has talked of Ayanamsha corrections as per Grahalaghava of 14th century!

Also attached is the original comment of Bhatotpala from his commentary of Brihat-Jatakam--(Bhatotpala-Parasari). It is clear from the same that Bhatotpala has talked about several Greek astrologers, that have been quoted by Varahamihira, like Satyacharya, Maya, Yavana, Manittha and especially Sphujidwaja. Bhatotpala is of the view that Sphujidwaja's work "Yavana Jatakam" is ofpost Shaka era i.e. after 78 AD. Besides, Sphujidwaja has also talked about earlier Yavanacharyas having said thus.

This vindicates the statement of David Pingree that the Yavana Jataka of Sphujidwaja was a creation of around second/third century CE.

\<I also noticed you saying that there is no mention of "Rahu" in any of the Vedas,

>

But incidentally, we do find it in Atharva Veda Samhita (19.9.10).

 This is what I have said in my mail, attached below

"There are neither Mesha etc. Rashis, whether so called Sayana or so called Nirayana, nor Mangal, Shani etc. planets, much less the much dreaded "Rahu" ---the lunar node---a mathematical point of zero dimensions----in any of the four Vedas, or the Vedanga Jyotisha available as on date, **though there are passing references to planets in the Atharva Veda, but no Mesha etc. Rashis."**

And it is the same "passing reference" from the Atharfa Veda that you have quoted above!

\<And, in a few other vedic texts.

It has repeated something similar in 49.5.9

That means it was "revealed" much later after both the epics and all the Purana had been compiled.

Regarding the planetary knowledge of AVP, it says in 51.1.3-4 that the sun was born in Kalinga, Moon among the Yavanas, Mars in Avantika, Budha in Magadh, Brihaspati in Saindhava,Venus in Maharashtra, Saturn in Saurashtra, Rahu on the top of a hill and Kethi in Malya! Thus we have first to decide the "nationality" of these planets!

Even if for the sake वादी परितोष न्यायः we agree that some Vedic texts do mention Mangal, Shani etc. planets, but there is absolutely no indication that the Vedic Rishis had ever thought of harnessing them
for predictive astrology.

It is worthwhile to ponder here on the fact that in the "Vibhuti Yoga" of the Bhagvadgita, (10th Adyaya) Bhagwan Krishna Himself is silent about planets, since He has identified Himself with Vishnu among twelve Adityas, with Moon among nakshatras, with Brihaspati among the priests, with Skanda (instead of Mars) among Commanders-in-chief, with Shukarcharya as a "poet"! Same is the case of His Vibutis in Srimad Bhagavata.

It appears that Bhagwan Krishna also had no idea that there would be some planetary astrology----that too based on nirayana Mesha etc. twelve imaginary equal divisions of an equally imaginary circle called ecliptic----thus really niraadhaar.
