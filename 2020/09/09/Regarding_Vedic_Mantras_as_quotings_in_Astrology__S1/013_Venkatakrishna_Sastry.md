( क्षम्यतां , केवलं सौलभ्यार्थं आङ्लभाषायां प्र्त्युत्तरं स्थापितमत्र , विदांकुर्वन्तु महोदयाः )



1. All your questions gets cleared if you contemplate on \< What is Vedanga- Jyotisha? अथवा वेदाङ्गत्वेन विद्यमानं ज्यौतिषं किमप्यन्यदेव स्याद्वा ?

Why Jyotisha is recognized as and guided to be studied-practiced as
Vednaga? \>.



'Vedangataa' means use of discipline in the frame work of 'Vedas' for a VINIYOGA. The utitlity of 'Vedaanga' is for 'Veda -karma-Samsiddhi'.

'Veda' in post colonial frame work is not the same as in Gita. Also, Veda must be first, before 'Vednata.

Vedanga is needed to learn-use-benefit from Veda. Vedanga -poorvaka Veda-adhyayana is trashed to prioritize ' Veanta poorvaka veda -nindana'.

(Many vedantins think that they don’t need Veda ! or peform vedokta-karma !! They seem to have better wisdom than Sri Krishna - gita - 18- 5 )

Vedanta is a distraction for \< Veda studies without the basis of vedangas> .



3a) 'Veda' is used in 'Yajna' for 'Karma-Samsiddhi'. (Gita : 3-8 to 3-21).

3b) Yajna needs application of Veda -Mantra in the prescribed Time ( Kaala) and to be chanted in the right way.

3c) Six Vedangas provide the tools needed for application of Veda in yajna (= Veda- Viniyoga). The tradition is pointed in gita (13-4), (15-1).



 The first four vedangas are \< shikhsaa, vyakarana, chandas, nirukta>. These give langauge tools to be used for knowing \< akshara-brahma / brahmaakshara jnaana).

Today we mistake these tools to be langauge grammar tools for study of a historic langauge ! and social conversational model, for pride and display of trained schoalrship.

 We seem to have lost the focus on ' purpose of Veda- adhyayana-adhyaapana' for 'Vagartha- pratipatti' ; So we lean to study Samskrutham without recourse to vak-yoga. 



 Jyotisha provides \< Time: kaala-jnana/ muhurta> ( 11-32: Time as Narayana).(11-18).(10-35; 10-22). Today we mistake this sky gazing tools for peeking in to future and guess

remedial ( parihaara) measure.



 Kalpa provides the implementation methods, systems and models detailed in Gita (4-24 to 4-32). Today we mistake this for bricks arrangement and geometry.

Gita detailing of yajna-kalpa- vidhi in several modes is taken as 'optional practice styles of yajna' ?! Thus we lose the chapter integrity and entire yoga integrity in Gita discourse.



2. When the current teaching of'Vedanga Jyotisha' is presented -taught-used in ' non-traditional mode' , how can one expect to get the vedangataa benefit of of ' traditional texts' ?

 



3. Rest all issues raised by you may please be reviewed in the above frame work and see where all the deviation is occuring. It is a clear identification of loss of text and tradition.

This needs a different kind of action - strategic and support for implementation. The team need to get out of ' vishaada' ( lamenting model) noted below.



What is lamenting model ? It is lamenting on current models of
Inappropriate and Incorrect proceudres ( अनुचित - असाधु - पद्धतयः )and
practices used in current period in learning-using 'Veda, Vedanga, Jyotisha'. The course correction is a different enterprise. This needs addressing the ' pedagogy of learning-practicing- defending 'Sanatana Dharma -Yoga/ Bhashaa - sampradaya' and 'getting benefit from it.

 This is a sensitive issue linked to the clarity on the question : \<वेद शब्देन किमभिधीयते ? वेदान्त -इत्यत्र वेद- शब्दस्य
कोऽर्थ: ? वेदान्त - विज्ञान-सुनिश्चितार्थाः सन्न्यास-योगात्- यतयः शुद्ध-सत्त्वाः इति किं विधीयते > .



 The fact stands that the 17th to 20th century answers to the question: \< किमर्थं वेदाध्ययनम् \> has been understood and practiced differently from the original intention and guidance from Dharma Shastras and directions by Acahrya reading : \< वेदो नित्यमधीयतां, तदुदितं कर्म स्वनुष्ठीयताम् \> .



The post colonial understanding and practice of \< वेद - संप्रदाय / वेदाध्ययन संप्रदाय \> , \< वेदान्त - वेदाङ्ग - उपवेद संयुक्त वैदिक -ब्राह्मण शिक्षण-पद्धति\> are more synced to 'Historical Religion and society model' thinking , getting off from the line of traditional stand. The blame is made on history, historical brahmanas.



What seems to be the trend-dominating line of current debate is \< वेदान्ताचार्य वर्य -मत- चर्चा- प्रधानता पूर्वक, षडङ्ग-अध्ययन- आचरण-दूरीकृत - उपवेद बाह्य - वेद-भाषानुवाद -चिन्तनम् \> .

This framework makes 'Vedangataa' incapable of delivering the intended goal of \< Veda>, reflected in the expectation from the statement
\<ताः सर्वाः वेदविदि ब्राह्मणे \> and Gita intention of 'Narayana - upaasanaa' through \< वेदाध्ययन-वेद ज्ञान\> , where Narayana is
\<वेदान्त-कृत् - वेदविदेव चाहम् \> . For Varahamihra and the poorvacharyas dealing with triskandha vedanga jyotisha or later writers detailing ' kaala- amrutha, muhurta nirnaya….' suggesting use of veda mantras for ' parihara', ayurveda invoking ' Veda mantra rakshaa', it was not necessary to go back to basics ! The knowledge was a part of the eco system. the term' vedangataa' was enough to say what all needs to be said.



Think :Do we really want to get back the benefits as postualted in the texts in our life and pass it on to next genration? If yes, how do we do? When and how do we cross our line of lamenting ?

There is no doubt in the text and traiditon. The doubts are in decision making to step in to the action mode, without waiting for public tax-money to support what one individually considers as ' swa-dharma'.
