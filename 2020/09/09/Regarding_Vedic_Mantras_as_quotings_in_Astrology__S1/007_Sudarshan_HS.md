Shri. Kaul ji,

  

Thank you for sharing the reference to the Bhattotapala vachanam that I had asked. And for the clarification on "Rahu" in Atharvaveda.

  

I see that you have taken Bhattotpala's statement "पराशरीया संहिता केवलमस्माभिर्दृष्टा न जातकम् ।" as "no Parashara Hora Shastram anywhere". It does not appear so, but that is alright.

  

I am still curious about Shri. Muralikrishna's original question, which remains unanswered.

  

Regards,

Sudarshana
