I'm not sure if this is exactly what you were looking for. Prof Hiriyanna's essays Indian Aesthetics-1, Indian Aesthetics-2, his foreword to Prof Raghavan's 'Number of Rasas' etc have been collected and published, a few years after his death, as 'Art Experience'.  

  

'Art Experience' is available in archive.

Hope this helps,
