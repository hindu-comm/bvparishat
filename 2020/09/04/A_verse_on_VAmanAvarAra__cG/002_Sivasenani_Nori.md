Sri Dr. Shankar Rajaraman ji

  

Such a beautiful thought and such nice language! I especially like vikramakramaH. Each element of the meaning of your verse is significant. In both the haste in breaking samsarain the form of world-egg, and in slowly placing his foot on the head of Bali, the bhaktavaatsalyaof Vishnu is seen, and so it is indeed appropriate that we pray to such an auspicious foot. Also, there is chamatkaara in that two opposing actions - haste and deliberateness - are both gunas.

  

May the auspicious foot of Vishnu bless you with great productivity as a poet.

N. Siva Senani
