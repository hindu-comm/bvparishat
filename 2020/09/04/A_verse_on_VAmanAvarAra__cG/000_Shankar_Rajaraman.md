नमो विद्वत्कविभ्यः सचेतोभ्यश्च

  

जगदण्डकपाटपाटनत्वरितोदित्वरविक्रमक्रमः।

निहितो बलिमूर्ध्नि मन्थरं मुरजेतुश्चरणो मुदेऽस्तु वः ॥

(alternate reading for 1st पाद - जगदण्डकरण्डखण्डन)

It broke the vault of the universe by its forceful strides but descended slowly and softly on Bali's crown. May Vishnu's foot bring us joy

(Initially had "कवाटभेदन". Thanks Ganesh Sir and Shashi for the suggested change)

  

Regards

Shankar Rajaraman
