Humble pranams to all scholars of BVP,

  

I am finding it difficult to get the full import of Nilakantha's commentary on verse 38 in chapter 57 of Vanaparva where Bhima argues that samvatsara is equal to ahoratra (verse 24). Yudhishthira refuses to accept this argument (verse 38).  

  

I request scholars to help me understand the commentary on verse 38. An image of the relevant page is attached.  

  

regards  
shankara
