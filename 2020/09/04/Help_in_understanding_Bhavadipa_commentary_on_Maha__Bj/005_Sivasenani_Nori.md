Shankara ji

  

This discussion is rooted in the last adhikarana of the seventh pada of the sixth adhyaya or Purva Mimamsa. There the meaningof samvatsara in sahasrasamvatsara is discussed. Before going into the details, let me state the siddhanta - in that particular usage, samvatsara means 'day' according to both Purvamimamsa and Vyakarana (महाभाष्यम् - अप्रयुक्ते दीर्घसत्रवत्). So Bhima is technically right, but Yudhishthira is giving an equally technical answer, drawing upon his knowledge of Veda and its interpretation.

  

First, the relevant Sruti being referred to (as given in Sabarabhashya) is पञ्चपञ्चाशतस्त्रिवृतस्संवत्सराः। पञ्चपञ्चाशतः पञ्चदशाः। पञ्चपञ्चाशतस्सप्तदशाः। पञ्चपञ्चाशत एकविंशाः। विश्वसृजामयनं सहस्रसंवत्सरमिति। Here pa\~ncapa\~ncaaSat can mean 55 or five fifties, i.e. 250, trivritaH could mean three-fold or that has three iterationas like the three seasons of summer, rainy season and winter. This is argued in Purvamimamsa as follows:

  

सहस्रसंवत्सरं तदायुषामसम्भवात् मनुष्येषु। 6.7.31॥ (PurvapakshI1: It is meant for Gandharvas etc. as humans do not live so long).

अपि वा तदधिकारान्मनुष्यधर्म्मः स्यात्।32॥ (PurvapakshI2: Not so, as humans have the adhikaara for the sacrifice - so we will find some explanation for how they can live so long, say using medicines)

नासामार्थ्यात्। 33 ॥ (PurvapakshI3: No, since that - medicines etc. resulting in a life span of 1,000 years - is not possible)

सम्बन्धादर्शनात् । 34 ॥ (PurvapakshI3 continues: Further, there is no connection (between medicines and a lifespan of 1,000 years) ever seen)

स कुलकल्पः स्यादिति कार्ष्णाजिनिरेकस्मिन्नसम्भवात्।35॥ (Purvapakshi3 offers his explanation: As per the teacher KaarshNAjini, it is meant to be performed in one family over many generations as it is not possible for one person to do so)

अपि वा कृत्स्नसंयोगादेकस्यैव प्रयोगः स्यात्।36॥ (PurvapakshI4: No, since only one person can get the fruit of the entire sacrifice)

  

विप्रतिषेधात्तु गुण्यन्यतरः स्यादिति लावुकायनः।37॥ (PurvapakshI4 presents his thesis: Since there is a conflict in the meaning, one of the terms should be taken in the secondary sense according to the teacher Laavukaayana)

संवत्सरो विचालित्वात्।38॥ (PurvapakshI4 continues: \[Between the two terms pa\~ncapa\~ncaaSat and saMvatsara\], saMvatsara should be taken in the secondary sense since its meaning is changeable (there is the sidereal year, lunar year and the definition of year as compassing three seasons)).

... (Final siddhanta is that saMvatsara means day)

  

Yudhishthira is offering a similar argument.****

**विश्वसृजां सत्रे संवत्सरशब्दो न कालपरः।**

In the Visvasrij sacrifice saMvatsara does not denote time.

किं तु ‘पञ्चपञ्चाशतस्त्रिवृतः संवत्सराः पञ्चपञ्चाशतः पञ्चदशा इत्यादि श्रुतौ संवत्सरपदस्य त्रिवृदादिशब्दसामानाधिकरण्यादहःशब्दवाच्यक्रतुपरत्वं दृष्टं।

But in the sentence " pa\~ncapa\~ncaaSatastrivRitaH saMvatsaraaH ..." since the word saMvatsara and trivRit and others have saamaandhikaraNya (same basis, i.e. vibhakti etc.), it is seen that it denotes day which in turn denotes sacrifice.

**अतः संवत्सरशब्दो दिनपर इति प्रवादमात्रं।**

Therefore it is improper to say that saMvatsara means a day.

पञ्चपञ्चाशत इति पञ्चाशदधिकं शतद्वयमुच्यते।

Here pa\~ncapa\~ncaaSataH means 50 more than 200 (250).

न हि कालेन कर्तव्यं व्रतं कर्मणा समापयितुं शक्यमिति भावः॥

The sense is that the sacrifice that needs to be peformed with actions cannot be completed with time. In other words, Yudhishthira is arguing that if saMvatsara means 'time' it is not possible to complete it - therefore saMvatsara means sacrifice.

  

Coming back to the context, it would indeed be against dharma to assign the meaning 'day' to 'saMvatsara' and minimize the obligation of vanavAsa and aj\~nAtavAsa to a matter of days. So the reasoning offered by Yudhishthira is at the first stage. We need to assume that if Bhima were to continue the conversation in that vein, Dharmaraja would give more reasons and that in no case would he allow an alternate interpretation of the word saMvatsara. Thus there is no virodha between SaastranirNaya and the words of Yudhishthira.
