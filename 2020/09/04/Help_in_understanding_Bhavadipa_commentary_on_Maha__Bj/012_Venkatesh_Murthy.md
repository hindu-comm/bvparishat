Namaste  

  

If you look at Bhima's argument carefully, the mistake he is making is clear. Why is he sayinga Samvatsara is a day? 1000 Samvatsaras cannot be mean 1000 years because man's life span is not that long.True. 1000 Samvatsaras cannot be 1000 years but one Samvatsara can be 1 year. 1 year is within the life span of man. When Kauravas asked the Pandavas to go for Ajnata Vasa they said one year and not some large figure like 100 or 1000.
