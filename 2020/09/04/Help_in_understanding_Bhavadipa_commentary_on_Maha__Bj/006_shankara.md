Sivasenani ji,

  

Thank you very much for explaining in detail. Though I can understand Sanskrit, I am more comfortable in English, because of the difficulty in understanding precisely the meaning of certain technical terms in Sanskrit.

  

I still have a doubt. The conclusion in Sabarabhashya (6.7.13.31-40) is that samvatsara means day in the particular context. Yudhisthira's stand as explained by Nilakantha seems to be contradictory. Please elaborate how there is no virodha.

  

Also, I would like to know whether Nilakantha is quoting the argument that 'samvatsara is not कालपरः but कृतुपरः' from scriptures?  

  

regards  
shankara
