Shankara ji

  

Yudhishthira (well, Nilakantha actually) is arguing showing valid reasoning that saMvatsara needs to be interpreted differently, i.e. as kratu. He is consistent with Sastra to the extent that saMvatsara is the word that should be interpreted differently. Now once an untenable situation is encountered, there can be more than one resolution. Mimamsa and Vyakarana offer the resolution that saMvatsara means a 'day'; Yudhishthira offers the resolution that it means 'kratu', on the basis of saamaanaadhikaraNya(having the same basis, i.e. being related to the same noun in a similar way) between trivritaH(1/3, prathamAvibhaktiH, bahuvacanam) and saMvatsarAH(1/3). There is no Sruti being referred to here; the appeal is to reason. Thus, these are two possible solutions and hence there is no virodha (though there is no similarity). Now if someone says saMvatsara means one year, as normally understood, then there is an opposition, virodha.

  

Now, if Bhima were to argue this further (or if another person were to argue this), it is possible to defend the position differently. In the present context, saMvatsara cannot be interpreted to mean a day. That is paramount.

Senani
