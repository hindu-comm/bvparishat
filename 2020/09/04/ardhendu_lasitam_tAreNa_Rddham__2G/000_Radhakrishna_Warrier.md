Just heard this beautiful description of the candrabindu over ga (ग) in gam (गँ) in the Gaṇapati (Gaṇeśa) Atharvaśīrṣa (गणपति अथर्वशीर्ष):

Ardhendu lasitam, tāreṇa ṛddham (अर्धेन्दु लसितम् तारेण ऋद्धम्)

Brightened by the crescent and decorated (complemented, increased) by star.

Here the crescent is the bottom part of the candrabindu and the star is the dot over it.

The Gaṇapati Atharvaśīrṣa is considered an Upanishadic text and is attached to the Atharva Veda. So, it must be pretty ancient. Since the candrabindu is described so precisely and beautifully, it leads to the conclusion that the text was written down even in those ancient days, and the shape of the ancient गँ, especially the candrabindu over the character ga was very similar to Devanagari गँ. So, in what script was the Gaṇapati Atharvaśīrṣa written in those hoary days? 

On a different note, is ṛddha related to vṛddhi meaning increase and vṛddha meaning old?
