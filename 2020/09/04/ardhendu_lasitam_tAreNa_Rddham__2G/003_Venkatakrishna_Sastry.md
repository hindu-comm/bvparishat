Namaste



On \< So, in what script was the Gaṇapati Atharvaśīrṣa written in those hoary days?  \> :



What is your position on plausible date of Ganapathy- Atharva Sheersha Upanishad out of the time line and contexts below? 

(A-1) Very ancient- apaurusheya time less (A-2 ) Pre- Mahabharata ,as Ganesha is already clear concpet (A-3 ) Pre-Paninian/ Pre-Buddha ( as Ganesha/ vinayayka concpets are clear in Buddhism ,Tantra and Aagama pooja vidhis (A-4 ) Post Ashokan ( to ascribe scripting to yavana origin/ Greek/ out of India/ Brahmi model/
Pre-Post IVC civilization relics, along with Yogi's. Shiva family, Dravidian tradiitons . IVC seals show animal head deities and shiva family. (A- 5) Fabricated text as Ganesha worship is purana origin and linked to Ramayana, Mahabharata, through crafty imaginations (A-6) Traders God (A-7) Yogi's god for worship in chakras and part of the
panchayatana worship systems established in tradition (A-8) One of the Tantra deities (A-9 ) A representation of ' Om', 'Brahma', ' Pranava' in a different form ? - Pranava is also having 'Chandrabindu
notation in devanagari writing' !

The text as it is available now also provides a visual form of Ganesha with a elephant head and a broken tusk and a worship mode ? ? :
