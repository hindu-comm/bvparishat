Namaskars,

  

We find that there are different styles of reciting Sanskrit verses - either from puranas or from kavyas - by different scholars. There are regional variations in reading a verse which is in the same metre.

Similarly, when the chandas changes, the rhythm too changes and probably the old time scholars had a traditional way of reciting them. For instance, while reading Shruti-Gita of the Bhagavatam, which must have been sung by millions of devotees, I found it difficult to bring it into a rhythmic rendering.

In all our kavyas there are different metres, like mandakranta, viyogini, etc,. which have their own metric beauty. They too are read in different styles by scholars of different regions.

Is it possible for some university to take up a project to get all such varying styles recorded? Verses in different metres may be recited by traditional scholars of different regions, who have some experience in rendering them.
