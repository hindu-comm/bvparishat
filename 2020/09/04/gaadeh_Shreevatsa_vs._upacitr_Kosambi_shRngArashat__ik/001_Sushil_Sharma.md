Namaste,

  

This verse is clearly in उपचित्रा meter, as correctly noted in the शतकत्रयम् edited by Kosambi. उपचित्रा is a मात्रिक छन्द, more flexible by definition (than a वर्ण वृत्त), while गणदेहा is defined as a वर्ण वृत्त that can also be seen as a very specific वर्ण वृत्त permutation among many that are possible for उपचित्रा. Though the 1st and 2nd पाद-s of this verse also match the definition of गणदेहा वृत्त, the 3rd and 4th पाद-s do not. All four पाद-s comply with the definition of उपचित्रा, therefore, identification of the meter for this verse as उपचित्रा is valid, and its identification as an example of गणदेहा वृत्त would not be correct.  

  

As per Pingala's छन्दः शास्त्रम् (सूत्र# 4.46), उपचित्रा is a मात्रिक छन्द made of 4 equal पाद-s; each पाद consists of four चतुर्मात्रिक units (thus total 16 मात्रा-s in each पाद), the last वर्ण of the पाद has to be a गुरु, and the 9th-10th मात्रा-s have to occur in the form of a single गुरु वर्ण (that is, the 9th and 10th मात्रा-s can't be split into two लघु वर्ण-s).

  

गणदेहा is not a very commonly cited छन्द. It is not described by Pingala and most of the other older well-known authors on Sanskrit/Prakrit prosody. It is also not listed in Prof. Velankar's Jayadaman. After some searching around, I found reference for गणदेहा in रणपिंगल Part-1 (a work on Prosody, in Gujarati, written by Ranchhodbhai Udayaram Dave, pub. in 1902). There, गणदेहा is listed as a वर्ण वृत्त, made of 4 equal पाद-s, each पाद having 10 वर्ण-s arranged in the fixed pattern ल-ल-गु-गु-गु-गु-ल-ल-गु-गु. As can be seen, this गणदेहा is a very specific permutation of वर्ण-s possible under the definition of उपचित्रा meter described above. \[This is not a very rare phenomenon, there are other examples of वर्ण वृत्त-s which overlap the broader definitions of some मात्रिक छन्द-s in the sense of their being specific permutations possible under those मात्रिक छन्द-s.\]

  

Regards,

Sushil
