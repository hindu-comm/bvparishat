Namaste



The \< अगृह्यमाणकारणा: \> 



- has a plural, which is likely to point to a ' community, group wisdom ' . The entire community thinks like this and supports study, as it would be a social welfare goal oriented and also for personal welfare.

- \< Without postulating a reason/ reaons may also indicate the ' obvious good nature of the exercise' . Or \< unable to find anything wrong in such purusit as harmful> . Or , it could be an enforcement of 'authority, a prerequiste to be a good standing member of community.>
Such practitioners become idols and icons in society for other to see as living examples of tradition in practice.



- It is a duty \<आदेश , उपदेश , वेदोपनिषत् , एतदनुशासनम् एवमु चैतदुपासितव्यम् > a commnad for continuity of tradition.



The term \< अगृह्यमाणकारणा: \> seems to resonate the quote from Patanajali Mahabhashya reading \< ब्राह्मणेन निष्कारणेन
षडङ्गो - वेदो अध्येतव्यः......... \> The term \< निष्कारणेन \> may match the meaning of \< अगृह्यमाणकारणा: \>.



Thre seems to be variant readings floating around with modification and inclusion of words to amplify the intention \< ब्राह्मणेन निष्कारणो धर्मः षडंगो वेदो ध्येयो ज्ञेयश्च,,मातापितरौ चास्य स्वर्गे लोके महीयते\> and a \<benefit associated>. If one subscribes to the view that such an act benefits the \< heavenly benefits to parents>.





The fact remains that the social practice has moved to pass mark level ( border of 35%) from the standard of excellence expected (at 100 %).
