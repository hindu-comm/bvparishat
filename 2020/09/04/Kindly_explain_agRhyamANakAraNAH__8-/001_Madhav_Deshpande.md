Dear Vineet Ji,

  

  This term is used by Patanjali in his Mahabhasya to describe the great शिष्टs of आर्यावर्त who are experts in some branch of knowledge, and they are so selfless that they study the शास्त्रs without any selfish motive. This is what the term अगृह्यमाणकारणा: means. They have no specific कारण needed to study the शास्त्रs, but they do it out of their natural inclination. One could say in Hindi: "किसी स्वार्थ के बिना." With best regards,
