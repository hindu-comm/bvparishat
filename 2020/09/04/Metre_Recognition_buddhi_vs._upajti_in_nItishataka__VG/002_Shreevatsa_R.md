Please don't rely on the output of this tool at this time foranything scholarly; it still has many bugs, and it should be treated as a toy.

Apologies that I haven't been able to muster the energy to do something about it :-(

  

Anyway, as for "buddhiḥ" etc, the "problem" is that someone has given specific names to each of the 14 varieties of Upajāti.

(14 because 2^4 = 16, minus two for Indravajra and Upendravajra).

Having such overprecise names is pointless, so Upajati is what we should call it... thought I had fixed it but apparently not.
