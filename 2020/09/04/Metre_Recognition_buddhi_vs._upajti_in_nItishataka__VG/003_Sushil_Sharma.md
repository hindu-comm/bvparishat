As already explained by Shreevatsa ji, बुद्धिः is name of one of the 14 varieties of उपजाति meters produced by permutations of इन्द्रवज्रा and उपेन्द्रवज्रा पाद-s. You can see these 14 varieties enumerated, along with their examples, on printed page numbers 119-125 of the काव्यमाला (NSP) edition of the छन्दः शास्त्रम् (at link below).
