Sri Bhat

  

You have raised an interesting question. This can be answered differently. At one level, it can be said that, naming is based on main properties (प्राधान्यात् व्यपदेशः) and that a name is not the complete description of all properties of the entity. So an avyaya is not completely changeless.

  

At another level, answers could focus on what change means. Is it apparent? Or real? Or is it a matter of intent, vivakshaa? For instance, famously Visnhu is avyaya, but he also took many forms as avatars. Does this contradict his avyayatva?

  

Then there is a different dimension. Vyakarana and Mimamsa hold sabda to be nitya, eternal. So any of the modifications induced by samdhi in any word, not merely avyayas, can be seen as denying sabdanityatva. Yet sabdanityatva is a core tenet of these two schools. For those interested in how this is resolved, details can be seen in the paper 'Dadhi Atra is not Dadhyatra', co-authored by yours truly, available at<https://www.academia.edu/44186817/DADHI_ATRA_IS_NOT_DADHYATRA> and also attached herewith.
