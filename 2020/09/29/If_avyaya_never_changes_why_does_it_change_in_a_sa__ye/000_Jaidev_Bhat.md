Dear list members,

  

I wanted to ask if anyone knows the answer to this question. Usually it is said that an avyaya never changes its form. If that is true, then why is it that in sandhi karya, they change their form. For example in Bhagavadgita (9/31), shashvat + shantim changes to shashvac + chantim.

  

Here the avyaya shasvat changed to shashvac. Similarly when we write atah eva, it changes to ata eva and the "atah" loses its final visarga. How can these avyayas change in form if they are avyayas?

  

regards,

  

jaidev bhat.
