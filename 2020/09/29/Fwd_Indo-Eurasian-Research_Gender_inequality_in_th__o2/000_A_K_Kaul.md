\[Moderator note: Thank very much, Prem. Here is a more direct link to the second edition (2017) of your book:<https://tinyurl.com/yxtqsqtu>**.** I've also been working through Ron's inaugural paper and the other articles from the 2016 conference: fine stuff! - SF\]**  
  
**Thanks much, Ron and Steve.



I'm having some of these papers downloaded and printed, being a minor Tantra scholar myself: cf. the second paperback edition of my book \["Yoga, Bhoga and Ardhanariswara: Individuality, Wellbeing and Gender in Tantra"\], with new Afterword by me, on [https://www.routledge.com](http://www.routledge.com;) it has blurbs and Foreword by a few prominent North American scholars.  
  
Warm regards,

Prem

Dear All,



Ron’s paper is published in a special edition of the “Proceedings of the Society for Tantric Studies” that contains 17 papers on Tantra and related topics. The opening paper in the collection is by James Mallinson, published in 2019.



For those of you who know Jim’s work, the fact that he chose to publish his paper in this collection should alert you to the high quality of the papers.



To see or download individual papers, go here:



<https://www.mdpi.com/journal/religions/special_issues/tantric_studies_proceedings#published>



To download all the papers at once in a zip file (56 Megs), look on that page for the link that says **“Download All Papers.”**



Thanks much for the alert to your paper, Ron. There are a lot of people on the List working on similar issues, even though we don’t have much List traffic these days.



Best,

Steve
