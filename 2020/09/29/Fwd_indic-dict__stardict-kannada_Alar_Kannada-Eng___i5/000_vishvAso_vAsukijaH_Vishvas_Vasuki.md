A remarkable story about how one person (V. Krishna, cc-ed) worked alone for decades to produce a beautiful kannaDa-english dictionary, and how ultimately one influencial programmer Kailas Nadh (also cc-ed) with generous support from his partner Nithin Kamath at Zerodha company ultimately digitized and published it (links below) - <https://zerodha.tech/blog/alar-the-making-of-an-open-source-dictionary/>

  

It is extraordinary to see the following:

\- A person who spends decades on a hobby project of great linguistic value; and then publishes it under an open source license (too many get stuck in "copyright" and vanity)  

\- A person who finds value in helping (technically, legally) the above kind of people (despite being new to the language).

\- A successful, supportive and generous company which appreciates such activity  

  

For stardict users, as usual the converted dict is available at <https://github.com/indic-dict/stardict-kannada/tree/gh-pages/kn-head/tars> , and may be installed via tips at <https://sanskrit-coders.github.io/dictionaries/offline/> (you may find some other surprising dict additions since last update)
