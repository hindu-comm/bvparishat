e-PGPathshala (at<https://epgp.inflibnet.ac.in/>) used to host their video lessons in YouTube. But those 19,000 videos on 70 subjects are no more available on YouTube. Following is the warning message appearing when tried to access those videos. I hoped that they will be available at least on [archive.org](http://archive.org). But they are not found there either.

  

Any idea where they have gone? Hope they have been backed up somewhere and will be available soon.
