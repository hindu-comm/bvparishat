The abundance of material provided by Prof. Paturi

should be an eye-opener to many.

Samples of good style worthy of emulation!

  

The evaluation made by Paturi is also indicative of his extensive reading.

His collection and selection are fit for commendation and recommendation

by/for those who have, or love to cultivate, a good style in Sanskrit  

for the current times in particular.
