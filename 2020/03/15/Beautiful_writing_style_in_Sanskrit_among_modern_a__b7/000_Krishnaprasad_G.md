Dear all

I am searching for the different writing styles in Sanskrit where we can express our thoughts in the style of contemporary.

  

Forexample, T Ganapati Shastri. Counter example Jaggu Vakalbhushana.

Please name some great authors, even written thing may be preface, letter, commentary will be useful.

  

Thanks.
