I bought this translation brought out by Samskrita Bharati of Mahabrahmana just last week -<https://samskritabharati.in/preview?bharati_books=VmpGU1EyRnRWa1pPVldSWFlUSjRjRlZyVmt0VlZsWnlXa2R3YkZac1JqTldiRkpIWVZVeGNtTkdiRnBoTVhCRVZqSXhSbVZHWkhWU2JGWlhZa1p3VVZaWGNFZFNNVnBXVFZWV2FHVnFRVGs9&samskrita_bharati=VmpGU1EyRnRWa1pPVldSWFlUSjRjRlZyVmt0VlZsWnlXa2R3YkZac1JqTldiRkpIWVZVeGNtTkdiRnBoTVhCRVZqSXhSbVZHWkhWU2JGWlhZa1p3VVZaWGNFZFNNVnBXVFZWV2FHVnFRVGs9>  
  
It is quite different from the earlier novels that I had read in sanskrit. Liking it so far. Though there is profuse use of liT throughout (which fits the historic nature of the novel), the other word-usages are fresh and lucid to understand. IMO, someone with a fairly good reading in Sanskrit can write like this. The authors have brought out the natural diction of sanskrit.
