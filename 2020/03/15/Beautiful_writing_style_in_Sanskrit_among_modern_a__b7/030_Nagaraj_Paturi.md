What is interesting from the point of view of 1800-1950 Sanskrit literary creativity is that the colossal musician polyglot scholar Ajjada Adibhatla Narayana Dasu (1864-1945)who iscalled Harikathapitamaha for Telugu, composedand performed Harikathas in Sanskrit too. His three Harikatha Sanskrit texts are made into a book called Harikathamritam.



(His other Sanskrit works include Sanskrit translation of Omar Khayyam's Rubayiyat and Taarakam an original allegorical poem. His Rubayiyat translation published along with the English one by Edward Fitzgerald(1934)received wide acclaim.)
