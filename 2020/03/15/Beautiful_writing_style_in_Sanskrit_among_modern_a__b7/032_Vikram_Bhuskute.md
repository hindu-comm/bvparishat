Respected Scholars,

  

Thanks a lot for raising this "Close to my heart" topic. I am frantically searching old/new writing (mainly गद्य) to adopt to

a neither tough nor too simple approach.

  

I want to add another name to this list: Shree. **Shreepad Shastri Hasurkar.**

  

List is here -
<http://literature-shripadhasurkar.blogspot.com/2010/05/creative-literature-by-pt-shripad.html>

Many of them are available on archive. The Gadya style good and creates good dialogue with reader.

  

Will try to add more names.

  

Attaching glimpse.

  

  

  

Regards,

Vikram
