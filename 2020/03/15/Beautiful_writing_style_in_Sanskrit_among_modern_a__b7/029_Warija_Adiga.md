Thank you,

  

Another book, if I can suggest is - Sanskrt Idioms, phrases and suffixation subtleties by Aacharya Dr. Pullela Ramachandra, published by Rashtriyasanskrita Vidyapeetham.( It is a beautiful collection of words, idioms, phrases, which are not normally found in dictionaries.)
Luckily, found this in the books exhibition at AIOC held in Nagpur early this year.

  

All the best,

Warija Adiga
