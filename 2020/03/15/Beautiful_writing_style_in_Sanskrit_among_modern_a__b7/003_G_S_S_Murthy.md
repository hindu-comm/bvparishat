It is a very interesting topic.

I do not know if शैली and "style" are etymologically related.

There are a large number of scholars who write lucid Sanskrit. Some make it a point to use easily understandable words. Some are pedantic.

I wish to point out a particular style which is characterized by, what I may be permitted to call, पञ्चमीबाहुल्यम्. This style is much influenced by commentaries and sub-commentaries of mainly religious texts. Brevitywas a necessity when writing on palm leaves was not at all easy. This style I believe is no more required. Every पञ्चमी विभक्ति puts me off.

Many modern writers prefer to write adjacent words in prose without subjecting them to सन्धि and it is a good trend.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
