Encouraged by your kind words, I present here a small piece written by me years ago.

  

To be exact it was 1984 (= 36 years ago) when Samskrita Bharati was not yet born,  

nor Aksharam at Girinagar. The Spoken Sanskrit Movement was yet at its infancy.  

It was functioning as the Samskrta Vibhaga under Hindu Seva Pratishthana,  

a part of Vishwa Hindu Parishad. The first public programme where the first publication  

as a souvenir (entitled Samskrita Sandhya) was released was at Gayana Samaja, Bangalore.  

  

As the Editor, I wrote a 2-page editorial. Endeavouring to blend the spiritual and the social  

aspects of the language and the culture, I wrote in a simple style (and chaste too?).  

I would be happy if one or two among the list can see some merit therein.

  

(It was appreciated by the giant grammarian Vidwan Ranganatha Sharma  

who said he found a rare Namul usage in it, among other things).  

Thoughts and expressions from the Vedic/Upanishadic/Yogic literature  

can also be discerned.  

  

I hope the scan is legible, given the fact that it is over 30 years old :
