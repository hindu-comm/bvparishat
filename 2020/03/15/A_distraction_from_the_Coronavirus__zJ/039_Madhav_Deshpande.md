A distraction from the Coronavirus

  

ब्राह्मणा: श्रमणा: द्वन्द्वयुद्धं ते कुर्वते मिथ: ।

कोरोनादुर्दिने तेषां समाहार: कथं वद ।।

  

The Brahmans and the (Buddhist/Jain) ascetics engage in hand-to-hand combat with each other. Tell me how they could be bunched together during the pandemic of the Coronavirus?

  

\[Pāṇini 2.4.9 (येषां च विरोध: शाश्वतिक:) prescribes a samāhāra-dvandva compound for those who are permanently opposed to each other. The stock example of Samāhāra-Dvandva is ब्राह्मणश्रमणम्\].
