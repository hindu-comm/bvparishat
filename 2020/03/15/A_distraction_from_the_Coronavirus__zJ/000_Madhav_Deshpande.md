A distraction from the Coronavirus -

  

व्यञ्जनोच्चारणे भूय: स्पर्श: स्यादिति चिन्तया ।

भाषितव्यं स्वरैरेव कोरोनास्पर्शभीरुभि: ।।

  

With the concern that the pronunciation of consonants often involves contact of organs in the vocal track, those who fear the touch of Corona should speak only with vowels.
