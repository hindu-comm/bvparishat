A distraction from the Coronavirus

  

\[This is in response to what Ms Warija Adiga told us. Her father used to say: खल्वाटवन्त: खलु भाग्यवन्त:\]

  

केशैर्विहीनानि शिरांसि येषाम्

किं नापितै: कार्यमिहास्ति तेषाम् ।

न स्पर्शभीतिर्न धनव्ययो वा

खल्वाटवन्त: खलु भाग्यवन्त: ।।

  

Those who have no hair on their heads, what purpose do they have with barbars. They have no fear of contracting the Coronavirus, nor any expenditures. The bald people are really fortunate.
