A distraction from the Coronavirus

  

प्रसन्नं कमलाकान्तमब्रवीद् ध्रुवबालक: ।

स्थिरां देहि स्थितिं देव कोरोना यत्र न स्पृशेत् ।।४०।।

  

The child Dhruva said to Lord Vishnu who was pleased with him: “O Lord, give me such a firm position where Corona will not touch me.” \[Dhruva became the Pole Star.\]
