Draupadi says to Arjuna -

  

मत्स्यं मा विद्ध्य कोन्तेय भविता न स्वयंवर: ।

कोरोनानिर्गमादूर्ध्वं पुनरायाहि सत्वरम् ।।

  

O Arjuna, don’t shoot the fish \[with your arrow, to prove that you are the best archer\], since the ceremony of choosing the groom will not be happening. After the Coronavirus goes away, please come back quickly.
