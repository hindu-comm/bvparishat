I have been half awake while writing this verse. You are right. Let us make it Triśaṅku. Thanks.

  

कोरोनास्पर्शभीतोऽसौ त्रिशङ्कुर्नृपसत्तम: ।

स्वर्गं विहाय पृथ्वीं च मध्य एव प्रतिष्ठित: ।।४१।।

  

Scared of contracting the Coronavirus, the great king Trishanku left the earth and heaven and situated himself in the middle.
