A distraction from the Coronavirus

  

अगस्त्यस्यास्पृशत् पादौ नहुषो खे रथे स्थित: ।

कोरोनाशङ्कया शप्तो मुनिना सोऽपतद् भुवि ।।४३।।

  

Nahusha, sitting in his chariot in the sky touched the feet of the sage Agastya. However, due to the fear of Corona, the sage cursed him and he fell to the ground.
