Dear Scholars,

  

I am delighted to say that two musicians/composers are working on this Ashtadasha Ragamalika:

  

1\. K. V. Ramaprasad Ji in the Carnatic style

2\. Dr. Samit Mallik in the Hindustani Dhrupad style (Darbhanga Gharana)

  

Ramaprasad Ji has made substantial progress and has even recruited a vocalist to render the composition. To my surprise, both the Pancha-Chamara and Shardulavikridita sections could be set to Rupaka Tala (Carnatic style) due to its matra structure.

  

I hope to share a rendition with this group in the upcoming weeks.

  

Best,

Kushagra
