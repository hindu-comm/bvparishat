Dear Sri. Kushagra,

  

How can a varNvRtta like shaarduulavikreeditam be evaluated for its correctness in terms of maatraa-samatva alone? We all know that maatraa-jaati-s merely follow maatraa-samatva while the varNavRtta-s are bound by both varNa-samatva and maatraa-samatva. If such liberties are
exercised, to that extent the said varNa-vRtta violates the prosodic rule and this perhaps has been pointed out by Dr. Shankar Rajaraman.

  

That apart, setting a metre to taala or not, singing it with or without the frame of taala are no way concerned with metrical correctness or incorrectness. In myopinion, vitaana-vRtta-s loose their unique flavor to a great extent if they are set to taala. It is mainly the group of sataana-vRtta-s that get the real benefit of talic embellishments.

  

I came across a few of your verses in this list and the recent one on TM Krishna's issue was brilliant.

  

Thanking you and with best regards

  

Ganesh
