Dear Prof. Paturi,

  

We,the Wakankars, appreciate your efforts in arranging a lecture on Bhimbetka,a World Heritage Site, discovered by my elder brother, Padmashri Dr. V. S. alias Haribhau Wakankar.

  

We are celebrating his Centenary Year through many academic events like Seminars, Rangoli and Drawing Competitions etc.which were very dear to him.

  

Our eldest brother,Lipikar V.S. alias Bapu Wakankar, wrote a book.viz.Ganeshavidya-Ancient Indian Approach to Phonetic Writing,which was published by the Tata Press,Mumbai,in 1966.

  

He was the person who computerised all the Indian Scripts and was the Founding Director of ITR-Institute for Typographical Research- in Pune.

  

I wish success to such memorable activities.

  

Warm regards and thanks.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.

Vadodara.9427339942.
