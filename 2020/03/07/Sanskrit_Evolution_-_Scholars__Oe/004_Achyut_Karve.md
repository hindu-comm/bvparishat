Dear Venkataramaniji,

  

I have been studying the Classical Tabla for the past 40 or more years.
 Its evolution is quite recent not more than say two to three hundred years. It evolved through a shishtha tradition and took on a very unique phonetic as well as a unique performing form. Its final form was presented by no other than the Tabla maestro Ahmedjan Thirakwa whose recordings are available on Youtube.

  

This affords a window into developing a sketch of the evolution of Sanskrit which too evolved through a sishtha tradition. The sistha tradition draws its strength from the guru shishya parampara a firm footing outside the realm of natural transmission of knowledge and language.

  

If you areinterested kindly contact me privately.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
