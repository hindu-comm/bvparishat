Yoganandaji, many thanks for this gem of a book in Kannada. Is Sampangiramanagara named after the author? The book is interestingas it throws light on many aspects of Mysore state administration of early 20th century. And there is a model letter to a dancing girl, a concubine and a viTa! Kannada usage is also typical of the times. It looks like he has written a bigger book. Is it also on the web?

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
