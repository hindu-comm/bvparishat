There were Marathi works in the medieval times called Mestaka used to teach letter writing. I remember seeing a work titled लेखनालङ्कार.
There is also a book titled "Sanskrit Documents" by S. N. Sen and Umesh Mishra published in 1951 by the Ganganath Jha Research Institute, Allahabad. There are also collections of Sanskrit letters written by pandits to Mughal court in Delhi and to British administration. I don't remember the bibliographical reference, but perhaps Shri Shankara Ji can find it. Best,
