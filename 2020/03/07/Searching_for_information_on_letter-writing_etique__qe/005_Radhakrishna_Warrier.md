I am curious to see what the suggestions are for letter writing inMālavikāgnimitram. The Malayalam translation ofMālavikāgnimitram was part of my Malayalam course, but it was several decades ago, so I don't remember anything about the letter writing example in this work.

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
