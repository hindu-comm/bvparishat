"The measure, introduced by Democratic state Rep. Jeremy Gray, has already passed in the Education Policy Committee with bipartisan support and is expected to be voted on by the House next week,[according to NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/alabama-bans-yoga-public-schools-hindu-religious-might-change-n1151551?cid=sm_npd_nn_fb_ma).

Under the rules proposed in the bill, school districts could choose to offer yoga as an elective class, but would require instruction to focus "exclusively to poses, exercises and stretching techniques" that are taught with "exclusively English descriptive names," **meaningtraditional Sanskrit names for poses would be taught usinganEnglish label**. For example, vrksasana is usually referred to as tree pose.  
  
Under the rule, "**chanting, mantras, mudras, use of mandalas, and 11 namaste greetings shall be expressly prohibited,"** and all instruction is "limited exclusively to poses, exercises, and stretching techniques.""
