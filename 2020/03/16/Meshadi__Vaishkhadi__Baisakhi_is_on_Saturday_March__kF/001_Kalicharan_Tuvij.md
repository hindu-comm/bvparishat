विनाश-काल, विपरीत बुद्धि  
This happens when mediocres revolt against the best (and their traditions). Soon, taking the cue, laggards revolt against the mediocres and then it's all over for Dharma. The inversion of merit.  
  
Coming to the OP, at the risk of repeating my points (for the umpteenth time):  
1) uttarayana = the first of mAgha.  
2) the first of mAgha used to coincide with winter solstice at the onset of kali i.e. around 3000 bce.  
3) WS keeps sliding: from kumbha mid (3000 bce) to kumbha start (dhanishtha) to capricorn and so on. And this is well attested in texts.  
4) WS =/= uttarayana.  
5) precession in sidereal panchanga is essential to let the logic of yugas work. Again, months are essential to panchanga, not rashis that are derived from months (/nakshatra-s).
