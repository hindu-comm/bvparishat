Shri Kalicharanj Tuvij ji,

Jai Shri Ram!

Thanks for your response.

\<1) uttarayana = the first of mAgha\>.

) As per the Vedanga Jyotisham (Yajusha Jyotisham) sixth mantra Uttarayan takes place always in Magha and Dakshinayan in Shravana, the actual mantra being

प्रपद्येते श्रविष्ठठादौ सूर्याचान्द्रमसावुदक्। सार्पार्धे दक्षिणार्कस्तु माघ श्रावणयोः सदा।।

\<2) the first of mAgha used to coincide with winter solstice at the onset of kali i.e. around 3000 bce.\>

2\) Nobody knows for sure as to when Kaliyuga started, since as per Aryabhatiya and the Surya Siddhanta, Kaliyuga started when the mean longitudes of all the planets including the sun and the moon except for lunar Node and Perigee were zero, which was at 6.00 am of February 18, 3102 BCE andon the midnight of February 17/18, 3102 BCE respectively.

But they i. the mean longitudes were actually never zero over the last several thousand years.

Thus the Kaliyuga that is being "observed" these days in Panchangas and Sankalpa etc. can be called as "Aryabhatiya" or "SS Kaliyuga" if not an imaginary Kaliyuga.

\< WS keeps sliding: from kumbha mid (3000 bce) to kumbha start (dhanishtha) to capricorn and so on. And this is well attested in texts.>

3. Since there were no Mesha etc Rashis in India before around 1st century CE, there is no mention of any Mesha etc Rashis, much less equinox or solstice vis-a-vis any Mesha etc Rashi in any work prior to the Surya Siddhanta.

And that siddhanta has said भानोर्मकर सँक्रान्तेः षण्मासाः उत्तरायणम् कर्क्यादेस्तथैव स्यात् षण्मासाः दक्षिणायनँ making it clear that there are no exceptions to Makar Sankranti = start of six months ofUttarayana and Karka Sankranti = start of six months of Dakshinayan.

The same thing has been repeated by the other siddhantas including the Siddhanta Shiromani of Bhaskaracharya-II.  

Even Varahamihira has warned in Aditya Chara Adyaya of his Brihat Samhita that the Winter Solstice must always coincide with the calculated Makar Samkranti---and if need be, adjustments should be made accordingly, as otherwisethere will be quite unexpected results!

Since the VJ has said that Uttarayana must always start in Dhanishtha and Dakshinayana in Ashlesha, it appears the earlier astronomers like Acharya Lagadha, Shuchih and even Garga etc. were unaware of the effects of precession on Equinoxes/Solstices vis-a-vis nakshatras.   

\< WS =/= uttarayana.>

Yes! Uttarayana = Winter Solstice the shortest day of the year. And it will always be like that!  

\< 5) precession in sidereal panchanga is essential to let the logic of yugas work. Again, months are essential to panchanga, not rashis that are derived from months (/nakshatra-s)>.

As clarified above, Yugas are imaginary as even their duration is subject to a lot of discussions.

Kaliyuga is supposed to have a "life" of 432000 years as per the SS but 1080000 years as per Aryabhatiya. Similarly, Dwaparayuga is supposed to have lasted for 864000 years as per the SS but 1080000 years as per Aryabhatiya and so on. Thus it makes the date of Incarnation of Bhagwan Ram also subject to a lot of bickering since He is supposed to have been around in the fag end of Tretayuga!

That means He must have Incarnated at least about 864000 years of SS Dwaparayuga plus 5101 years of Kaliyuga i.e, about 870000 years back.
And if we go by Aryabhatiya yugas, He must have incarnated more than 1085000 years back!

So the more we discuss the yugas, the more confusion there will be!

The Vedic year is seasonal. So is the Pauranic and the siddhantic year. The Vedic months are seasonal. So are the Pauranic months and even the siddhantic months. And the seasonal phenomena are impervious to precession whereas the longitudes of stars are subject to precession.

That is why Dhanishtha etc. nakshatras had an independent existence of their own in the Vedic period since there were no Mesha etc. Rashis to which they could be linked!

As and when Mesha, Vrisha etc Rashis and that too Sayana Rashis came to India all the nakshatras got subsumed in the same. And that is what has created such a confusion!.

That is why Ashvini nakshatra---when the Vernal Equinox was in that nakshatra---- was known as First Point of Aries or Mesharambha bindu!

Nakshatra divisions, in any case, are supposed to be the houses of gods
देव गृहाः हि नक्षत्राः as per the Vedic lore. But the equal nakshatra divisions, in most of the cases, get de-linked from their namesake stars. Thus they defeat the very purpose of being "deva-grihaah". So the nakshatras for practical purposes have to be of unequal divisions.
We find 28 nakshatras including Abhijit in the Vedas and also later literature. They could never be of 13.33333 degrees each!

So the only alternative that we are left with is to celebrate all the festivals including Mesha Samkranti-cum-Vishuva as per the seasonal gamut, as advised by the Vedas, the Puranas and the siddhantas but perform nakshatra yashti etc. or even muhurtas related to nakshatras etc. quite distinctly and separately from Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis, whether so called Sayana or so called nirayana, the latter being more imaginary than anything else!

So the Mesha Samkranti, as per all the Puranas and siddhantas is on Friday, March 20, 2020, since "Lahiri" Mesha Samnkranti of April 14 is unrelated even to nakshatras not to speak of seasons!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!
