Respected members of Bharatiya Vidvat Parishad,

Jai Shri Ram!

As is common knowledge by now, there are no Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis in any of the four Vedas nor in the Vedangas. But we find their mention times without number in the Panchama-Veda viz. the Puranas though not in the epics, exceptfor some odd astrologicalconfigurations in the Valmiki Ramayana, which are actually of doubtful nature and a later addition!

Thus whether it is Makar Samkranti or Mesha Samkranti or any other Samkranti, or any other festival, for that matter, we have to follow strictly the conditions enunciated for the same in the Puranas and then calculate them as per the criteria of the Siddhantas including the Surya Siddhanta!

These days a new solar year is supposed to start from Meshadi, also known as Vaishakhadi/Vaishakhi/Baisakhi. But the question that arises is as to when is it to be celebrated and why. Let us try to find out:

1\. **Srimad Bhagavat Purana**, the most respected Purana among the Hindu community especially the Vaishanavas besides ISKCON has said in 5/21/4-6

यदा मेष तुलयोर्वर्तते तदा अहोरात्राणि समानानि भवन्ति यदा वृषभादिषु पञ्चसु च राशिषु चरति तदाहान्येव वर्धन्ते ह्रसति च मासि मास्येकैका घटिका रात्रिषु \|4\|

यदा वृश्चिकादिषु पञ्चसु वर्तते तदहोरात्राणि विपर्ययानि भवन्ति \|\|5\|\| यावद्दक्षिणायनमहानिवर्धन्ते यावदुदगयनं रात्रयः \|\|6\|\|

When the sun traverses the signs of Mehsa (Aries) and Tula (Libra), the days and nights are of equal length and when it traverses the five signs from Vrishabha onward viz. Vrishabha, Mithuna, Karkata, Simha and Kanya days become longer and longer while nights become shorter by nearly half an hour (24 minutes) every month. When however, the sun traverses the five signs from Vrishchika onwards days become shorter and nights longer.

Days grow in length till the sun takes to the Southward course and nights become longer and longer till it takes a northward course. (Gita Press translation)

In 5/22 the same Srimad Bhagavata has clubbed Rashis with nakshatras as well as seasons and ayanas in the following words

अथ स एषआत्मा लोकानां द्यावापृथिव्योरन्तरेण नभोवलयस्यकालचक्रगतो द्वादश मासान्भुङ्क्ते राशिसङ्ज्ञान् संवत्सरावयवान् मासःपक्ष द्वयं दिवानक्तंचेति सपादार्क्षद्वयँ यावता षष्ठमशँ भुञ्जीत स वैऋतुरित्युपदिश्य्ते सँवत्सरावयवः \|\|5\|\|

अथ च यावतार्धेन नभोवीथ्यां प्रचरतितं कालमयनमाचक्ष्य्ते\|\|6\|\|

अथ च यावन्नभोमण्डलं द्यावापृथ्व्योर्मन्डलाब्यां कार्त्स्न्येन् स ह भुञ्जीत तंकालं संवत्सरमिदावत्सरमनुवत्सरम् वत्सरमिति भानोर्मान्द्य शैघ्र्यगतिभिः तंसमामनन्ति \|\|7\|\|

It is none other than the glorious (omnipotent) Lord Narayana, the most ancient Person (the ultimate Cause of the whole universe) Himself, who is critically inquired into by the Vedas as well as by the wise (those well-versed in the Vedas), that for the welfare of all living beings splits up His body (in the form of Time, symbolized by the year)---the theme of the three Vedas (Rigveda, Yajurveda and Samaveda), which is responsible for the right timely performance of rituals into twelve parts (the twelve months) and manifests (by turn), in the six seasons, spring etc., the (distinctive) characteristics (in the form of heat and cold, showers and winds etc.) of each season, so as to provide the Jivas with the means of reaping the fruits of their past actions....

The same Lord who is the soul of all living beings passes through twelve months, the twelve parts of a year, known by names of the twelve signs of the zodiac Mesha, Vrisha and so on). The learned declare that a month is equivalent to a couple of fortnights (one bright and the other dark, according to the lunar calendar), a day and night (in the eye of the manes) and the period taken in traversing two constellations and quarter (from the point of the sun). And the fraction of a year in which He (the sun-god) covers the sixth part of His orbit is called a Ritu (season). (5)

And again they refer to the duration of time in which He traverses one-half of His passage through the heavens as an Ayana (6)

And further the learned speak of the length of time in which the same sun traverses the whole extent of the sky bounded by the heavenly sphere on one side and the terrestrial sphere on the other along with these two spheres in slow, rapid and moderate marches as a *Samvatsara, Parivatsara, Idavatsara, Anuvatsara or Vatsara.* (Gita Press translation). (Pl. see the attachment Bhagavata).

From the above quotes, it has become clear that Mesha Samkranti is nothing but another name of Vishuva i.e. Vernal Equinox when days and nights are equal, Karkata Samkranti is another name of Dakshinayana viz. the Summer Solstice, the longest day of the year, Tula Samkranti another Vishuva, when day=night i.e. Autumn Equinox, and finally Makar Samkranti just another name of Uttarayana viz. the Winter Solstice i.e. the shortest day of the year! 

Sun's journey through two Rashis like Mina and Mesha make Spring and so on. Sojourn through Six Rashis makes an Ayana and through twelve Rashis a year like Samvatsara etc.

*It is thus out and out a seasonal i.e. tropical year, Rashis and solstices etc. as per Srimad Bhagavata!*

2\. **The*Vishnu Purana,***another very important Purana of the Hindu ethos:

Its second Amsha, eighth Adyaya is just like a chapter from high school geography books describing the phenomenon of seasons in detail, the most relevant shloka being

शरद्वसन्तयोर्मध्ये विषुवं तु विभाव्यते \| तुलामेष गते भानौ समरात्रिदिनम् तु तत् \|\|

On the days of Sharat Sampaat and Vasanta Sampaat the two Vishuvas i.e. Equinoxes take place. On the entrance of the sun into Mesha and Tula, the days are equal to nights.  

(Attachment VPRashis02)

I could go on talking about other Puranas like Shiva Purana, Linga Purana etc., but suffice these right now.

**Amarakosha:** The attachment ''Amarakosha months" also tells us that Mesha Samkranti is Vishuva when day = night and so on!

**Tantraloka:** It is the most reputed work by Acharya Abhinavagupta theTantracharya and Shaivacharya of 11th century Kashmir.

The attachments Ta1 and Ta2 tell us the same thing that for Yogic and Tantric kriyas Mesha Samkranti is nothing but Vernal Equinox, when day=night and Makar Samkanti nothing but Uttaryana viz. the shortest day of the year and so on.

***Historicalproofs:***

The attachment Alberuni-Munjala tells us, in the words of Alberuni, the efforts that were made as early as tenth century by scholars like Munjala to remove the discrepancy between the calculated Samkrantis and the actual seasonal samkrantis!

So there is absolutely no doubt that all the Samkrantis right from Mesha to Mina are seasonal which are euphemistically known as sayana rashis!

***Mahbharata has praised Vishuvas and Ayanas:***

We know that there are no Mesha etc. Rashis in the Mahabharata. Does it mean that there were no "samkrantis" then?

No absolutely not!

We followed the Vedic and the Vedanga Jyotisha calendar viz. Madhu, Madhava etc. months then which were seasonal.

The four cardinal points viz. the two Equinoxes---Vishuvas--- and two Solstices---Ayanas---were very important phenomena in the Vedas as well as the Vedangas and epics and Puranas apart from siddhantas.

The Mahabharata (Vaishnavadharma Parva, 8/23 has said

राजन्नयन्योर्मध्ये विषुवं सम्प्रचक्ष्य्ते \|\|समे रात्रिदिनम् तत्र संद्यायां विषुवे नृप \|\|ब्रह्माहं शङ्करश्चापि तिष्ठामि सहिताः सकृत् \|\|क्रिया करण कार्याणां एकीभावत्व्कारनात् \|\|

O king, between the two solstices, there are two equinoxes when the days and nights are equal. Myself, Brahma and Mahadev get together on that date to review workings of the world.

अस्माकमेकी भूतानां निष्कलं परमं पदं \|\| तन्मुहूर्तम् परम् पुण्यं राजन् विषुव संज्ञितम् \| तदेवाद्य परं ब्रह्म परम् ब्रह्मेति कीर्तितम् \|\|तस्मिन्मुुहूर्ते सर्वे तु चिन्तयन्ति परम् पदं \|\|  

As we get together on that particular moment which is the most important and is known as Vishuva that is the Para-Brahma and during that moment everybody contemplates on the Para-Brahma! (Attachment Mahabharata-Vishuva)

Thus as per the Mahabharata also, the four cardinal points are the most important phenomena!

***How to calculate such "Samkrantis"?***

Well, as per the attachment Ranganatha Meshadi , the Surya Siddhanta has cried from house tops

भानोर्मकर्संक्रान्तेः षण्मासाः उत्तरायणम् कर्कयादेस्तथैव स्यात् षण्मासाः दक्षिणायनम्\|\|

द्विराशिनाथा ऋतवस्ततोपि शिशिरादयः \|\| मेषादयो द्वादशैते मासैस्तैरेव वत्सरः \|\|

"Six months of Uttarayana start from the ingress of the sun in to Makara Rashi. Similarly, six months of Dakshinayana start from the ingress of the sun into Karkata. Each season like Shishira (Winter) comprises two Rashis i.e. months and such twelve Rashis make a year"

 Same thing has been repeated by every other siddhanta including the Siddhanta Shiromani, nay even Aryabhatiya!

***What are the proofs:***

So far so good! The million dollar question arises as to how can we be sure that the day is equal to night on Mesha and Tula Samkrantis, shortest on Makara Samkranti and longest on Karkata Samkranti and so on!

The attachment sunrise-sunset-Mahapadmasar gives the details about the daily longitudes, RA, declination of the sun for 5-30 am IST vis-a-vis the sunrise, sunset timings in LMT and the "duration of day i.e. Dinmaan" for Mahapadmasar viz. Wularlake in extreme North (Kashmir), where the Vedanga Jyotisha was compiled as back as 1500 BCE!

It is really amazing as to how the jigsaw puzzle fits into the solar samkrantis vis-a-vis the duration of day like day=night on Mesha Samkranti, longest on Karkata Samkranti, day=night on Tula Samkranti and shortest on Makar Samkranti and *dinmaan* being really as is advised by the Bhagavata Purana, Vishnu Purana, Amara Kosha, Tantraloka etc. i.e. 12 hours for Mesha-Tula sankrantis viz. Vishvas, minimum for Makar Sankranti viz Uttarayana and maximum for Karkata Sankranti viz. Dakshinayan!

Also attached is a sunrise-sunset table generated from Swiss Ephemeris
for Kanyakumari---extreme South!

Again, the same phenomena repeat on Mesha, Karkata, Tula and Makar Samkrantis without exception!

***विनाश काले विपरीत बुद्धिः !***  

So the methodology advised by the Puranas and siddhantas is quite scientific whereas the "almighty" Lahiri Samkrantis, which some "scholars" call sidereal---are neither as per any Veda, nor the Panchama-Veda nor any siddhanta nor even as per modern astronomy nor even as per High School geography text-books!

But just see the irony! We call the Pauranic and siddhanticSamkrantis Gregorian as if Pope Gregory XIII had calculated them after reading the Bhagavata and Vishnu and Shiva and Narada Purana and so on! And we call Lahiri Samkrantis as "Vedic" (Eh!?) which are the most misleading and against the Hindu ethos and without any scientific basis actually!

*So to begin with, we must start celebrating Meshadi/Vaishakhi on Friday March 20, 2020, the Punya Kala being about 9-22 am IST!*

Otherwise, we will be celebrating willfully all the important festivals on wrong days against the injunctions of the Shastras. And the Gita 16/23 has warned quite unequivocally----without mincing any words:

यः शास्त्र विधिमुत्सृज्य वर्तते कामकारतः।

न स सिद्धिमवाप्नोति न सुखं न पराम्गतिं ।।

One who acts willfully against the injunctions of shastras neither attains success nor happiness, least of all moksha!

In other words, by celebrating Meshadi/Vaishakhi on April 14 instead of March 20, 2020 we will be going against our dharmashastras just because some so called "Vamadevas" are advising us to do so!

***God helps those who help themselves:***

We should not wait for the venerable jagadgurus etc. to help us streamline our calendar because may be some vested interests do not let them streamline it since they i.e. the vested interest will lose their bread and butter then if we follow the correct calendar.

शुभस्य शीघ्रं

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!
