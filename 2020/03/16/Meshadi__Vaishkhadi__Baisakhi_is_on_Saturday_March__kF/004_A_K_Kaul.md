Shri Kalicharan Tuvijji,

Jai Shri Ram!

\< "=/=" means "not equal to". \>

Sorry for the typo "Yes" in the line "Yes!Uttarayana= Winter Solstice the shortest day of the year.And it will always be like that!" when actually it should have been

"NO! Uttarayana= Winter Solstice the shortest day of the year.And it will always be like that!"  

It is exactly like the missing "no" in your next sentence, "There is ? point in continuing this discussion".

\<You should refer to retd ISRO scientist Anil Narayan's recent article on Aryabhata's dating of Kali.>

I have read it already and Anil Narayan appears to have missed the sarcastic comment of Varahamihirain his Panchasiddhantika XV/20 about Aryabhatahaving started Kaliyuga at midnight at one place but at the sunrise time of next day in the very same breath!

And Varahamihira was referring to 6-00 am of February 18, 3102 BCE.

In fact, to start with Aryabhata had taken exactly the same planetary orbits in his *Aryabhata Siddhanta,* not available now, as were available in the old Surya Siddhanta of Panchasiddhantika and prepared the treatise which yielded the mean longitudes of all the planets as zero on the midnight of February 17/18, 3102 BCE. Thusit agreed totally with the Kaliyuga of SS.

But since in Bharatavarsha, a day starts from sunrise, and either probably becauseAryabhata was completing 23 years on February 18, 3102 BCE instead of February 17, 3102 BCE, or because he did not feel at ease to have started Kaliyuga at midnight since for all purposes, a day starts at sunrise and not midnight, so he "arranged" -- actually "rearranged"---- the orbital elements of the SS in such a manner that they yield zero for 6 am of February 18, 3102 BCE.

So Shri Anil Narayanan's theory that Kaliyuga started in 3066 BCE is fallacious.

Whether it is 3102 BCE or 3067 BCE, the mean longitudes of planets were never zero actually though both the SS and Aryabhata "proved" them to be zero!

This willbe clear from the two attachments SS-Kali-zero and Aryabhatiya-Kali-zero, which are the results of algorithms of the SS and Aryabhatiya respectively!

In the former case, the "Kaliyuga" starts at midnight of February 17/18, 3102 BCE whereas in the latter case, Aryabhata has made it start at 6-00 am of February 18, 3102 BCE!!!

Then again Anil Narayanan is silent as to when Kaliyuga will end or as to when Dwaparyuga had started! So his "Kaliyuga" is hanging between earth and skies like Trishanku of Maharshi Vishvamitra!

\< Ramayana's astronomical period comes close to what someone has estimated as beyond 10000 bce when Iranians were still not divergent and there was some possibility of hominids in the subcontinent as well.>

There was a discussion on this topic in this very august forum sometime back and you appear to have missed the same!

The problem with 12209 BCE as the date of Rama-Ravana war as "proved"
by Shri Nilesh Oak has some internal inconsistencies, in fact dichotomies!!

As per the Valmiki Ramayana Bala Kanda itselfp, Bhagwan Vishnu had promised that He would rule for 11000 years after having killed Ravana.
In the Uttara Kanda, we find Yamaraja reminding Bhagwan Ram that He had promised to rule for 11000 years and those 11000 years were already over. So it was time for Him to depart to His eternal Abode!

We also find in the Mahabharata Shanti Parva Bhagwan Ram having had a very long life of 11000 years.

Thus if He had vanquished Ravana in 12209 BCE, as claimed by Shri Nilesh Oak, He should have been around till at least 1000 BCE. So how could the Mahabharata war take place in 6051 BCE and Kaliyuga be around in 3067 BCE?

For your perusal, I am attaching the original material from the VR and the Mahabharata so that you do not have to hunt for the same here and there!  

Besides, as all the shastras cry from housetops that Bhagwan Ram had Incarnated in the fag end of the last Tretayuga, we just cannot wish away the duration of yugas!

It is only "modern scholars" who pooh-pooh the long duration of yugas but Maharshi Dayananda Saraswati-----as per his Rig-Veda Bhasha Bhoomika----was in favour of the same long span as advocated by the Surya Siddhanta---and not Aryabhatiya!(Pl. see the attachment Dayananda Yugas).

A few days back I had pointed out this dichotomy to Shri Nilesh Oak but have yet to receive any response from him.  

My grandparents and even parents would not listen to my pleadings that as per modern astronomy and archaeoastronomy etc. such a long duration of yugas was unthinkable! They had blind faith in the "Maya Mahasura" since he had learnt the "science of planets" from none other than Surya Bhagwan Himself!

Either the Surya Siddhanta and Aryabhatiya works are real gems of astronomy or they are just some "special arrangements" of planetary longitudes which could not be challenged till the advent of modern astronomy, especially without computerprogramming!

So we cannot have the cake and eat it as well! We have either to believe in the SS and Aryabhatiya Yugas as much as we cherish their antiquity or forget about those works completely.  

In any case, Meshaadi as per the same Surya Siddhanta and even Aryabhatiya---apart from all the Puranas and Smritis, must be celebrated tomorrow i.e., Friday, March 22, 2020!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

Avtar Krishen Kaul
