The transmission of information exactly is the main point: it's far from precise. Ramayana & Mahabharata as texts, as in their present form, belong to historical 200-400 AD.

Aryabhata tried to give rationale to traditionally given date. To what degree, with his skills, he could do justice to tradition is a secondary point (did reasonably well).

This is the main point: what are the principles of textual analysis of Hindu texts? Should one take 11000 yrs rule as literal truth in a text belonging to 200 AD?

A correct understanding of Panchanga itself leads to the correct understanding of yuga also! Tradition, not individual, is important.

Individuals like Aryabhata etc couldn't know about precession (except as a matter of transmitted faith), but tradition (a result of continuous observation) knows it - in the form of the working of Panchanga.

  

We see the same trend - of Hindus struggling (by the ways of bhAhya-s) to understand ancient knowledge that came as tradition. For example, vedAnta as the rationalisation of Veda (just like Aryabhata's rationalisation of kali date).

  

The core principle of textual analysis is simple:

1 shabda of Veda

= 1 vakya of Brahmanas/upanishads

= 1 upakhyana of purana-s/itihasa-s.

  

In the context of Ramayana, for example, its words or sentences may not convey truth - but its upakhyana-s certainly do.

  

That Ramayana was written in 200 AD is not a failure of knowledge transmission: Ramayana is meant to be transmitted at upakhyana level only -- it is meant to be written again and again at word and sentence levels. That's why Tulsidas Ramayana is by design as true as Valmiki's.

  

In Mahabharata, for example, we know for sure Bhishma's plan of departure at the start of mAgha - because this is at the upakhyana level. OTOH evidence for particular star orientations (exist only at vakya level) are suspect and at best can only be thought of as corroborative evidence.

  

Without these basics in place, there is no point in discussing along. Additionally I don't see panchanga researchers willing to learn a thing or two about the depths of the luni solar calendar (which can lead to social good).
