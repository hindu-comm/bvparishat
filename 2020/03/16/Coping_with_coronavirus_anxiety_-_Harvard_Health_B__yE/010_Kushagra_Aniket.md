The situation in New York is not much better:

  

1\. Many people are irresponsibly crowdingat restaurants and bars. Thankfully, they will be shut down starting Tuesday. Cases in the city are already approaching 300.

2\. I searched at least five stores for hand sanitizers today and could not find any. At the same time, some individuals are hoarding 17,000 bottles at home:

3\. For even simple groceries, you have to order online and wait for 2-3 days to receive the delivery.

  

As a result, I am considering fleeing to the countryside!
