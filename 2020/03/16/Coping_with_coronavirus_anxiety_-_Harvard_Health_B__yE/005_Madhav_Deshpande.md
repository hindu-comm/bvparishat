Dear Nagaraj Ji,

  

  The article contains good advice, including Yoga and breathing.
Being currently under Coronavirus lockdown, the senior citizens in California and many other states are advised to stay in-doorand not go out even for buying groceries. We have not stepped out of our home for more than a week. All social group meetings are already shut down, and even the families are practising social isolation between younger and older generations. The shelves in the stores are running empty of the necessities, and the home delivery services are overwhelmed and failing to deliver or deliver on time. After three tries, one service was able to deliver 80% of our groceries this afternoon after waiting for three days. The schools are closed and the companies are asking their workers to work fromhome if possible. This has created massive social and financial dislocation, and even the local, state and federal governments seem incapable to reassure the public. The estimates are staggering.
The estimate is that 21 million of the US population will get sick, while the entire country has only about 100,000 ventilators. No one knows how bad it is going to get, and the country is clearly not prepared for it. Such is the sorry state of affairs where I live. I hope India fares better.
