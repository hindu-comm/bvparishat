O California -

  

NewYork Times reporting this morning: On Sunday afternoon, Gov. Gavin Newsom capped a gloomy weekend by issuing sweeping new guidelines in an effort to head off the spread of the coronavirus in the nation’s most populous state.

  

He told anyone 65 or older and anyone with chronic health conditions to isolate themselves at home.

  

“Bars, nightclubs, wineries, brew pubs and the like” should close, he said. All restaurants, he said, should halve their capacity and keep customers at least six feet from one another."
