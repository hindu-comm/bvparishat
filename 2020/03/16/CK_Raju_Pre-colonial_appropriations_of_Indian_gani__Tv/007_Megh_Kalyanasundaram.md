Appreciate your thoughts, Dr. Iyengar.

  

With no immediately apparent conflict, I also appreciate Dr. Raju's perspectives and to mention just one here, his point about "the double standards of evidence."

  

Not a response to anyone but if it is indeed easy to establish Euclid's historicity, I wonder what what stops anyone from claiming INR 2,00,000/- prize C.K. Raju has instituted?

It is, of course, not my point that the prize not being claimed *alone* is to have proven anything. That said, when we meet next Prof. Iyengar, I would love to pick your mind on the responses received from NCERT in the matter of enquiry about primary-source based evidence for Euclid's historicity.

  

The first time I read the following portion from Vishwa Adluri and Joydeep Bagchee's*[Indology: The Origins of Racism in the Humanities – Part 2](https://www.indictoday.com/long-reads/indology-the-origins-of-racism-in-the-humanities-part-2/),* at least I was reminded of Dr. Raju's prize:
