There have been objective historical assessment of Indian vs Greek approaches by some German mathematicians and thinkers such as Schopenhauer, Hankel and others. See the 136 page long but highly readable and informative paper (If you need a copy send a private mail)

Language plays a big role in thinking and ideation, prior to Science developing as a method. Our policy makers for Sanskrit Universities have to reboot Indian Mathematics that is GaNita through Sanskrit based thinking and learning. I hope the new three (Central) Sanskrit Universities will take it as their responsibility to not just read the works of Brahmagupta, Bhaskara, Nilakantha and others, but take their legacy to still greater heights.
