Perhaps this thread could be used to crowdsource expert suggestions:

Dr. Nori PS: When one saves the image from the link, is it either not 62,61,632 bytes or of a resolution different from the one sent in the note attached?

It is possible one might appear clearer than the other to an individual but I doubt there is any actual difference in the file emailed and the file when saved from the link.
