Your points seem valid to me. Neither do I disagree with your estimate of the magnitude of the task, Dr. Nori, nor did I underestimateit earlier.

*I don't know*how different the current process has been from what you have indicated in your note, Dr. Nori.

*I also don't know* that they currently have no guidelines already in place.

  

My experience with SoI has been limited to a public grievance (which got directed to them) regarding an Indian map in a video vis-a-vis Kashmir.They responded. They sent a letter to [Center for Policy Research](https://www.cprindia.org/)which was followed by CPR removing that video. So, to me, they appear responsive to specific and constructive suggestions (or at least they were so in that case).

  

Best,

Megh

  

PS: I genuinely am not seeing a difference in clarity when I zoom at my end (within Adobe) from the saved picture. It might be a function of other things too, perhaps.
