Sir

  

The lack of clarity occurs upon saving. However if one uses the link and checks out the map (without saving), there is no loss of detail when one zooms.

  

Regarding crowdsourcing, it should happen after basic guidelines are set in. For instance should Hyderabad be Bhaagyanagaram or haidaranagaram or haidaraabaadam? Should Delhi be dilli or dehalee? Or Indraprastha?

  

The way other organizations have handled this is to set up a committee of learned people, evolve guidelines and then hand it over as a project to a few Professors who would then rope in many students and and ex-students and get this completed. Compared to the 2,000 odd members of BVP, there are nearly one lakh of Sanskrit MA degree holders, mostly teaching in schools.

  

India has around 7 lakh place names in total, out of which the unique components would be around 25,000 (to give an idea of the magnitude of work involved).

  

Regards

Senani
