<http://www.surveyofindia.gov.in/files/POL_MAP_4M_SANSKRIT.jpg> is clearer than the one attached by Sri Megh Kalyanasundaram.

  

Telangana becomes तेलंगाना (in Telugu we use तेलंगाणा) and Hyderabad, हौदराबादः but Ahmedabad is अहमदाबादम्। बेंगलूरु ends in a hrasva, but गुंटूरूः is treated differently. Still this is better than नागालैण्डम्। Or श्रीपोट्टी श्रीरामलु नेल्लूरुः। Not happy with mauling Sanskrit they decided that Rama in Telugu would be Ramalu! अहो कष्टम्।

  

I know that there would be mistakes because this is only their second attempt, but a prestigious national institution should take much, much better care.

  

Regards

Senani
