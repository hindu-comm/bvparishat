Namaste

  

I humbly present my paper 'Because Time is not Self: On Ānandajñāna's refutation of Kāla' to you, which I presented at the AIOC 2020, held at Nagpur. I was given the V G Rahurkar prize for best paper presented in Vedanta philosophy for this. The paper is based on a rare Sanskrit text title 'Tarkasaṅgraha' author by Ānandajñāna (\~13th century CE). The text is a detailed refutation of Vaiśeṣika philosophy. I am currently pursuing my PhD on this text. Here I have dealt with the refutation of Kāla.

  

Hope to know your views on this paper.

  

Regards
