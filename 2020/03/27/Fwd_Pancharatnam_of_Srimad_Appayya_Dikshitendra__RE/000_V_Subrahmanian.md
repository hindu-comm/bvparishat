Ayurvedic Doctor Sri Gokulakrishnan Iyer of Srirangam has rendered the five shlokas in a soul stirring way.

  

Pancharatnam is a short work of Srimad Appayya Dikshitendra in praise of Siva-lingas located in five different holy places in Tamil Nadu that represent the five Mahabhutas or elements. Lord Ekamranatha of Kanchi,
Lord Jambukeshvara of Tiruvanaikkaval, Lord Arunachaleshvara of Tiruvannamalai, Lord Kalahastishvara, and Lord Chitsabhesha of Chidambaram represent  
the Prthivi (Earth), Jala (Water), Agni (Fire), Vayu (Air) and the Akasha Mahabhutas respectively.  
  
These five verses and the sixth one giving the phala-stuti were found scattered in different places in Srimad Appayya Dikshitendra Vijayam of Sri KV Subrahmanya Sastrigal, a descendant of Dikshitendra. An attempt has been made, by the Tamil Smarta, to collect all of them and present them here.
