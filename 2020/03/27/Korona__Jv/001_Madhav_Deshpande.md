Dear Professor Jha,

  

  Beautiful verses. Under the current crisis, and especially living in the US where the number of infections has now exceeded China and climbing, I appreciate the sage advice given by Lord Krishna:

  

मात्रास्पर्शास्तु कौन्तेय शीतोष्णसुखदु:खदा: ।

आगमापायिनोऽनित्यास्तांस्तितिक्षस्व भारत ।।

  

  Just as such terrible circumstances come, the Lord assures that they will go away. They are not permanent. I have never seen such terrible times in the US during my 52 years of life here. Many grocery stores have now announced special hours just for the senior citizens. Some of my friends went yesterday to Costco, the largest chain of such stores, at the time of the opening, and there were five hundred people waiting at the door for the store to open. May the Lord have mercy upon all of us.
