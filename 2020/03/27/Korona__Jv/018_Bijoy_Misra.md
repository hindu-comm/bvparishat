Friend scholars,  

Talking about difference etc, I admire Irene's curiosity spread in a wide variety of topics.

But I strongly disagree that sickness or helplessness has anything to do with karma.

This has been a standard alibi for exploitation around the world. Many kings and finally

the colonists asked people to pray than to give back their land and property. I learned all this

during the last few years. All rationalization of inequality in the world is artificial and unethical.

Sorry that I sound rude. Let us join the world to remove the virus.

Best regards,.  

Bijoy Misra
