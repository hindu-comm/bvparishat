Namaste



The response to \< सप्रमाणं समस्यां परिहरन्तु आर्याः\> needs more specific details on where the procedure needs to be invoked.

The provisions are called ‘ Devalaya- Samprokshana- vidhi’. The substitution- worship in a scaled down way, by another person is a technical decision of selection of right person with credentials of practice, scholarship and sadhanaa.



The historic incident reference does not give the logic- mystic- of
customizing \<vaishnava- pancharatra – vaikhanasa-aagama> at Tirupati, which had an established tradition of a few centuries ! and a social image to keep up.



The same procedure cannot be invoked in as a standard in all Hindu Mandirs where the community worship and worshipper have different modalities and guidelines.



1.The question raised here is a narrowed down illustration of a larger problem: The bigger problem begs an answer to the question: What is a ‘Deva-Aalaya, Kshetra, Devataa-Praana-Pratishtaa, Aagamika/ Purohita/ Archaka, Veda relation to Aagama-Tantra resources’. All this ultimately boils down to the relation of Yoga and Samskrutha,- the language of Yoga. To expect a short guidance on complex issues in a short mail is difficult. Such expectation would be like seeking a skin balm to cure a brain cancer.



 The nature of issue is neither limited to ‘temples’. It also applies to ‘ Gruhya-Agni’ worship, the worship of ‘ special ancient devataa – pratishtaas’ at teertha- kshetras and mathas.



2. The ‘historic incident analysis’ mentioned in the post below is a contextualization and customization based on the procedures of ‘ Devaalaya samprokshana’ ; a technicality of vaishnava- pancharatra – vaikhanasa-aagama procedure invoked in circumstances when the ‘ normal routine of temple’ and ‘ archaka is dysfunctional –disabled – not present’ due to external circumstances. In many cases this is an emergency compromise.



3. This topic of \< तदा> and \<पूजां कर्तुं न शक्यते \> been extensively debated in several texts of tradition ( including Jyotish) on the steps, timing and procedures for adaptation of such modified procedures. These are very specific to the explanation of \< then>
by ‘devataa’ in the ‘ aalaya’ and ‘aagama’ by which the ‘ prana-pratishtaa’ was done. The \< size of the deity / pratimaa- pramaana :: बृहतीं प्रतिमाम् \> .

4. The technicality of \< अल्पपरिमाणकमूर्तौ संकुच्य अन्यत्र प्रतिष्ठापितुं शक्यते वा इति सन्देहः। पंचरात्रादिषु एतादृशविषये कः परिहारः वर्तते? \> requires the Yogic understanding of \< Prana-Pratishtaa>, \< Aagama- Vishishta, Devataa- saparyaa paddahti>.
It is the same technicality of \< prana-pratishtaa> reversed. It is called \< kalaa –apakarsha>. It requires a siddha to do this. It is
not a mechanical uttering of sounds mumbo-jumbo and show behind the curtain.



5. It all boils down to the break down the system of ‘ training the qualified Mandir- Professionals to upkeep the several thousands of
Mandirs- Big and small’ at India as well as beyond India. The training system of ‘ Purohita-Archaka’ given in the ‘aagama’ has been trashed by ‘ Hindu Society and Governments at large using the lens of ‘Democracy and invoking Reliigon model of Dharma institution running, with clear focus on ‘ Money at the Temple’. The community faith in ‘Devataa- Mandir- Purohita- Yajna vidhi’ has been commoditized by the social policy- polity –economy, pushed to make decisions in operations. The guideline in ‘Artha Shastra’ on ‘ Role and management of Temples in a state/ nation, how nation/ state/ Mandir managing committees can use the ‘ temple wealth’ are preferentially interpreted to ‘ dress up the
Archaka / AAGAMIKA / Purohit’ in a different attire as a ‘ Priest’.
