Dear members,

There is a WA message floating around with Corona raksha kavacha in SHiva Purana.

Upon searching I found this YT video.

Very nicely composed stotra.

  

Any idea who is the composer and singer?<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihgf18MZkfA>



While the claims of it being in Shiva Purana are incorrect ( I haven't checked it, and would love to be proved wrong!), it is greatthat such compositions are still happening. Keeps the tradition, language very much alive and relevant!
