In the BhagwadGita Chapter 18, each personality or temperament is made up of the three gunas viz. Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas. The 4 types of classified people as per their behavior and qualities are the Brahmana, Kshatriya , Vaishya and Shudra. The verse 45 says that each person must perform their duties as per their own nature, meaning the shudra should perform service with full dedication and devotion which will lead the shudra to fulfilled life and will eventually extinguish the "vasanas" due to which the shudra is having this temperament at all of more of Tamas, little of rajas and very little of sattva. The same is the case with a Brahmana, Kshatriya and Vaishya all are acting according to their "vasanas" induced temeraments and as long as they adhere to their own nature and act accordingly, they reach fulfillment. Is it that as a Shudra gets fulfilled, they transcend to become more like a Vaishya --> Kshatriya--> Brahmana or is it that irrespective of what varna you are , you can directly reach the highest state of fulfillment as you extinguish your own vasanas.  

  

There is a bit of a dilemna here, which needs clarification.
