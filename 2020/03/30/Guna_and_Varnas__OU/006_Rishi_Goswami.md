According to Vallabhacharya, the Varnas are not Jatis but Devas. The place where Varnas are listed is followed by चन्द्रमा मनसो जातः and other Devas being born.  
  
Like a seed in sack is not worthy to be an Ankur, similarly an Asamskrit child isn't worthy of Vaidik Karma. Only after Samskara, a Varna Deva will enter the body and he becomes whatever he was born as.  
  
Varna isn't by birth, but for eg, fruits from a mango seed can only be of Mango, child born to Brahmana can only be Brahmana after Samskara.  
  
Because Varnas go away, and Jati is Nitya Eka Anekanugata, Varna cant be Jati.but it is Deva, also in Brahmavada, Jati isn't accepted because Jati is required for commonness within Plurality.

A person who is born to a sage, say Vidura had Brahmana like qualities, but wasn't because lack of Samskara, the Deva didn't enter.  
  
This also explains Varna-Saankarya because 2 Virrudha Dharmas existing in body is called Saankarya. 2 Devas can exist in 1 body, like Harihara, Dattatreya etc. Varna Devas also exist in 1 body.  
  
Even though one becomes a Sage doesn't mean his Varna changes, Vishwamitra remained a Kshatriya even though having all quities of a Vipra.

Vallabhacharya has rejected Varnashrama is capable to give Moksha by itself independently, something which the Mimamsakas believed. Karma alone is enough.  
  
And in Kaliyuga especially, when Varnashrama is collapsed, one shouldn't rely on it much. If it's possible, one must follow, or if not possible (due to Sankarya), one should just follow path of Bhakti.  
  
(I've heard that a family which has lost tradition of Agnihotra, doesn't remain Dwija, and without आधानसिद्धा अग्नि, it cannot perform funeral rites, shraaddhas etc. This exactly collapses the entire system and dependancy or false pride attached to it).  
  
The basic Crux is, only God can Uddhar you, and if you follow, still he will save you, if you can't, still he will save you.  
  
Bhakti hence is easiest way. No matter what caste, nationality, or race you are. Bhaktimarga is open for all.
