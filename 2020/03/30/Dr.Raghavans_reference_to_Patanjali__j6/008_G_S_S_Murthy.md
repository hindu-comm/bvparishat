Thanks Prof.Paturiji,

It was not my intention to convey that Prof.Raghavan attributed the verses to Valmiki. I just mentioned that it is not there in Valmiki, although it could fit in well in Ramayana story. Patanjali must have quoted it from some source, I felt. The fact that Prof.Raghavan does not say anything about the source made me feel that the source was unidentified when he wrote the essay.

Regarding Shankaraji's support to BVP would this convey reasonably well, which is based on Prof.Kannan's expression?

भुवं गतं वाथ दिवं गतं वा

मुद्रापितं वा डिजिटीकृतं वा ।

न पुस्तकं शोधकलेखनं वा

भवेन्न यत् शङ्करदृष्टिगोचरम् ॥  

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
