Sri G S S Murthy-ji,

  

Prof. Raghavan is not at all saying that the story is in Ramayana.

  

He is saying that the story is a story involves Ramayana motifs (the expression वानरसैन्येस्मिन् is cliching) so has influence of Ramayana on it. Patanjali quoting such a story shows that Ramayana was already so popular and influential by Patanjali's time itself.

  

The story itself is a proverbial story used as a proverb to talk about the behaviour of a person which turns out to be right /good / appropriate accidentally /coincidentally without being intended by that person to be so.

  

एतदप्यस्य कापेयं यदर्कमुपतिष्ठति

  

is the point.
