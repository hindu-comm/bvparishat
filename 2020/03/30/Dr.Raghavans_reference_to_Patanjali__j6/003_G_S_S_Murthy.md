Thank you Prof.Kannan and Sri. Shankara ji.

I downloaded Text only version of Dr.Raghavan's tome as PDF download was very slow. May be I lost the Devanagari text for that reason.

How does one thank a person like Shankaraji who is willing to help all the time and everyone with his wizardry? I can only say, "May God bless you".

Thanks and Regards,

Murthy
