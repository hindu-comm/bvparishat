Dr. Raghavan in one of his essays on Ramayana refers to "Patanjaliâ€™s

citation of two Anustubh verses making a humorous reference

to a solitary monkey in the monkey army standing up and

worshipping the Sun."

I request help in knowing these 2 anushtup verses in Sanskrit.

Thanks and regards

Murthy
