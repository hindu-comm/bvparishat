See this:

<http://corpus.quran.com/ontology.jsp>.

Go through all utilities provided/possible there.

The question now is:  

  

Has anybody attempted this kind of presentation to any Hindu text(s) :
all these -  

the ontology of concepts, the text in print, simultaneous reading aloud (voice record) of the original,  

transliteration in various scripts, translations into various languages,  

grammar and dictionary alongside, commentaries and exegesis, modern expositions  

(books and articles on related themes), good and bad, with due annotations,  

diagrammatic representations, (scanned/photographed)manuscript resources, etc. etc. etc.  

\- all given in a plain fashion, &/or as scalable hypertexts/hyperlinks ?

(The intention is not to overwhelm the reader,

but to summon whatever he needs/likes/wants  

\- all at his beck & call : all at a mere press of the button).  

  

Of course, Islam and Christianity or religions of single books.

Hence their task is relatively easy. But Hinduism has  

a rich repertoire of literature spanning vast aeons.

And **every text of Hinduism** needs this appurtenance in all detail.  

  

The patterns of tools/utilities/services made available in this site  

can help the study of Hinduism too. All the same,  

newer/different techniques may be desirable too.  

  

Can Indic Academy take this up for even one small scriptural text?

Of course, IIT-K, Samskrita Bharati, UoH, and a few other institutions (even in the West)

have made their excellent attempts with varying agenda and varying levels/degrees of success

(and they need to be catalogued too, and their progress to be regularly reported too  

\- in some abiding sites).

  

Ultimately, there should be nothing wanting for an earnest reader that seeks to know.

  

By the way, are there better sites than the one cited at the outset for any (other) text?
