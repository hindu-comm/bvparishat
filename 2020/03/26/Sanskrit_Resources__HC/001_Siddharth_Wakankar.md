Dear Sir,

  

There is a manuscript named , षण्मुखकल्प, in the Asiatic Society,Kolkata,dealing with the art of stealing or science of robbery.

  

If you are lucky enough you will be able to get it,I could not get to even see it in seven visits of mine.

  

Mooladeva is supposed to be an expert into this art and Skanda is the presiding deity,as he stays in the mountains,the place of dacoits.

  

Best of luck in your search.

  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
