Dear friends,  

I’m working on a book on the subject of Thuggee cult during British India. Can you please suggest me the Sanskrit sources connecting to this theme in ancient India?

  

See the discussion of saṁsāra-mocakas in the writings of Wlhelm Halbfass.

  

As I recall, the wordsaṁsāra-mocaka occurs in the Nyāya-mañjarī of Jayanta-bhaṭṭa,
