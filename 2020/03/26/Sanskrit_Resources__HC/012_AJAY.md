Wakankar ji and Shankara ji, I found a book by SC Banerji - Historical gleanings from Sanskrit literature. Is it the same book? This is listed on amazon as well, but not available. That is also not available on archive even after searching by both options - banerjee and banerji.

  

Dear Sudip ji, can you please explain the numbers against the work you mentioned? Are these reference to the concerned verses?

  

Thanks
