Dear friends,  

I’m working on a book on the subject of Thuggee cult during British India. Can you please suggest me the Sanskrit sources connecting to this theme in ancient India? Though I’ve got a reference to Steyasastra and Dhurta Kalpa of Atharv Veda, but no solid tip off. Mricchakatika also mentions art of thievery, but there is no document available. Also, Lord Murugan is also said to be associated with this in oldliterature. I would be thankful if you could throw some light on the topic.

Thanks  
Ajay Sharma
