Dear Ajay and Shankar,

  

I have a copy of the paper by Dr.Banerji and the name of the hook could be the one mentioned by you. I, however, will try to look for it in my huge and scattered collection. You may try the other sources in the meanwhile.

  

Best of luck in your search.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
