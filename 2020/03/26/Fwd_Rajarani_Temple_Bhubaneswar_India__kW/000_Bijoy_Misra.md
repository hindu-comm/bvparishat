Friends,

i take this opportunity to write about various notable sites in this

town. This town is architecturally gorgeous.

Within walking distance from where I live exists Rajarani temple,

literally meaning the "Queen Temple". Placed in a quadrangle

of gardens and greens the petite 80 feet temple is possibly the  

best carved temple in the world. I walked there on the 16th and

was stunned to observe the beauty of construction. Gently sloping

to an aesthetic curvature, what puzzled me about the amount of

mathematical calculations that must have gone into the construction.

There must be calculations in projection geometry to place objects in height and astronomy to play with light and shade for highlighting the

carvings. The temple is five-tiered, possible creating gravitational

balance to maintain the plumb-line. But most exquisite are the

carvings themselves, so fine that it would compete with any metallic

jewelry. Fine jewelry and design have been products in the neighboring areas for a long time. We did invite a filigree artist to Boston Museum

of Science in 1987. Calculation of how much carving would hurt the

stability of the structure would need research. If you think critically,

it is astounding engineering work apparently from the 11th century.

  

Here is a temple picture from the web. I have to return to take  

closeups.

I will write on structures what I have visited.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy (in Bhubaneswar, India)
