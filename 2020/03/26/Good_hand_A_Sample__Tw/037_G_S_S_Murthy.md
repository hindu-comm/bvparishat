Around 1960 Dr. B S Ramakrishna, Professor of Acoustics in ECE Dept. of Indian Institute of Science was guiding a research project on the comparativeefficiency of Indian scripts vis a vis Roman script. As a student of his, along with others I provided a sample piece. Possibly it resulted in a paper. I wonder if anyone else in this group would know more, which would be relevant to this discussion.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
