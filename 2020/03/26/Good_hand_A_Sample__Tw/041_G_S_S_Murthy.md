Thank you very much, Gopinath ji.

May I take this opportunity to pay my humble tribute to the Great Professor Dr. B S Ramakrishna. He was a great teacher and always believed in starting from the fundamentals and building up step by step. He was very meticulous in writing a paper and weighed each paragraph,sentence and word to ensure that it could not be improved. One could see this quality even in this short paper.I am almost certain that this paper would have been written or typed by him only. It is my pleasure to remember him.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
