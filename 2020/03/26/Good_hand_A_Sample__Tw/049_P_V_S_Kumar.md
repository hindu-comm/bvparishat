In my schooldays, mid '70s, I saw at least 3 issues of fully hand written 6-monthly periodical magazine in Telugu language. A family friend brought them and kept them in our house for few days for our reading. That was in East Godavari district of AP.  
  
Those manuscript periodical magazines used to contain editorial, short stories, serials, cartoons and even advertisement. All are hand written/painted with pen and brush.  
  
I do not know their place of origin and who was the editor, etc. I am trying to trace them out. At least their digital copies. I am hoping that at least some issues of the magazine are preserved in Gowthami Manuscript Library in Rajahmundry in AP.  
  
If any of you hear/see those magazines in any form, please let me know.
