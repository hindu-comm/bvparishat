Of course, the devanagari handwriting is very good.

Initially I thought the gist was in Telugu, but on close investigation, I did see, it is actually in Kannada.

I am not used to reading handwritten Kannada. The upward pointed letters created a first impression that it was in Telugu.

Regards

Narayan Prasad
