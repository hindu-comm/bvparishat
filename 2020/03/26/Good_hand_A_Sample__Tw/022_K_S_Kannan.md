Thank you Manogna Sastry and Krishna Kashyap for your kind responses.

  

Dear KK, is your statistics more a guesstimate  

or founded on some statistics provided by some institution?

And if it is true, it is not a happy situation.

  

Going straight to the computer is getting popular in this era no doubt.

  

But to think of it : Coomaraswamy used to go straight to the *typewriter* while writing his articles  

\- a good many of them very highly dense; most references reeled out of sheer memory even as he cited  

from hundreds of original/scriptural writings, with as equal felicity as from modern writings;  

and sometimes the most complex sentence constructions; yet with clarity not missed a bit

\- rendered with mathematical precision indeed (a student of science, primarily, as he was) :

a veritable *scholar colossus* going by his unbelievably numerous writings on such a variety of domains!  

  

Lest I forget to underline: to go straight to the typewriter means  

having no opportunity for "backspace"!

  

A good many of my uncle's writings are also the first-time=final types:

corrections rather infrequent.
