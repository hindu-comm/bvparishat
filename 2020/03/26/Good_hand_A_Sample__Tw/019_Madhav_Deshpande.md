Dear Bijoy Ji,

  

  I was intriguedby your statement: "I have noticed that any time I make a writing in an Indian language, I must use pen and paper". I am not doubting your experience, but my own experience is just the opposite. I don't know for how many decades, but most of my writing in Sanskrit, Marathi and English is primarily on the laptop. Generally speaking, the only thing I end up writing by hand these days are lists of items when I go to a grocerystore. Now even that has stopped, as we are trying to order home deliveries from the store online, or let our daughter know by texting what she should buy for us.
