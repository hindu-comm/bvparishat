Thank you for sharing what must be a treasured personal memorabilia, Professor Kannan! Indeed, such fine penmanship in both languages!

  

Misra ji, your point on split nibs - I just snapped up a classic old Sheaffer Imperial IV today, on the Fountain Pen Network - some beauties are truly a joy to write with, :)

  

Warmly,

Manogna
