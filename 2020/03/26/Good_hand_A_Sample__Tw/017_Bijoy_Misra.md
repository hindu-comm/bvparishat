Kannanji,

I have noticed that any time I make a writing in an Indian language, I must use pen and paper.

English poetry would need pen and paper, but I can skip handwriting in making an English

prose document. Many English novelists are known to use typewriters, I don't know about the

poets.

Some of us in Boston break our head to deduce how the brain creates the words. We may have  

another paper this year.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra (in Bhubaneswar)
