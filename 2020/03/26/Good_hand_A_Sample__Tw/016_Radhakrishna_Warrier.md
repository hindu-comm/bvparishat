All this discussion about handwriting prompted me to try my hand at handwriting in a few of the scripts I know. I haven't written anything significantly with my hand for almost a quarter century. The ubiquitous keyboard took the place of the pen.

  

The point of my experiment was to try to write as fast as I could and still have something reasonably legible. I think it is still legible, but it is much worse than what it was a quarter century ago. But I still feel that if I write slowly enough, I could make it much better than what it is now.

  

Here is the result of my experiment:
