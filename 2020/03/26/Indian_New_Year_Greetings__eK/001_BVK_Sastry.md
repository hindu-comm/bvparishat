Namaste



Shubha Nootana Chandramana Yugadi.



The TIME is Considered divine. The divisions of time like Yuga- Kalpa-Samvatsara are human visions of the segmented Divine.



The Chandramana yugadi of Sharvari started now is one small part of this cosmic vision of Time.

We are passing through this journey in our current life time.

May this segment of TIME MACHINE JOURNEY keep us healthy, Happy and Purposefully Productive.



Regards

BVK Sastry
