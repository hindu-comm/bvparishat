Respected members,

I am looking for some references in ancient works to the daily routine (dinacharyA). Not just passing remark, but some detail on how one should do.

For example, when to get up, how to do morning routine, how to take bath (time, kind of water, place...), cloths, etc etc.

  

The only book I found from 1937 is this, but it is only Vol 1, out of 5 volumes.

Does anyone have links to other volumes?  
Or to other works, excerpts, references in purANas or other works. It need not be full text on this, but even an episode in a larger work. For example, parts of MB or Bhagvata where the discussion is on this, in some detail.

  

Thanks,  

\~ Shashikant
