Namovaḥ

  

Have any commentaries on the Śivatāṇḍavastotra been published?

  

A manuscript of Gaṇeśaśāstrī’s commentary is available here  

  

<https://archive.org/details/ShivaTandavaStotramWithTikaOfGaneshShastriAlm28Shlf26197DevanagriRavan/mode/2up>

  

I am looking for any books in print or scans of published books as they are easier to read than the manuscript scan in the link above.

  

Thanks, Nityānanda
