Sir,

  

I understand that the Vishvakosha Mandal of Prajnapathshala of Wai in the Satara District of Maharashtra has brought out Biographies of Great Reformers of Maharashtra and you may get official informtion about the book on Shri K.P.Parab from the Asiatic Society,Mumbai.

  

Best of luck in your search.
