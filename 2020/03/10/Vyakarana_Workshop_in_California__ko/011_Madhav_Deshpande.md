Just received a message from Professor Goldman that the University of California has decided to cancel or postpone all public gatherings until the Coronavirus situation is resolved. Following those guidelines, this event has been postponed, and will be rescheduled once the current situation is over. This is also the policy of the Stanford University where I go once a week, where all in person classes have been cancelled till the end of March.
