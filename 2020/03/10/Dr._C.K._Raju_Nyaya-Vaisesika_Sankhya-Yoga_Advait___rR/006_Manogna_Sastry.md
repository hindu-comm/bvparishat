Thank you for sharing this Megh.

  

In my view, Professor Raju's article speaks of a particular aspect of science - the experimental method as we know of it today - and its comparative origins. He does not use the western method as the bar nor is he entering the larger questions of how fundamental science itself is going through a process of churning, for they remain tangential to his points. He considers the topic, as I see it, not from the perspective of 'we too had it' but from a plane of genuinely giving credit where due, across eastern and western approaches to science. Despite the shaky (at best) origins of science in the west, it is indeed seen as the bastion of scientific and empirically sound thinking today and Professor Raju's article does a good job of highlighting the dubiousness that should be associated with this claim.

  

Post colonial approaches in history of science are woefully behind and given that backdrop, I think there is a legitimate need to have more of these in the public domain for the common man to know. It is unfortunate, but even in 2019, a common denominator across any list that speaks of remarkable scientific experiments across the world tend to be truly non-global, as does the view that non-western peoples may have developed these ideas to a greater extent earlier in the first place. The highlighting of the latter fact is not to also/only compete for the same credit, but to simply level the playing field and bring to the table sources that have remained outside the data set of the west for centuries.

  

Definitely looking forward to Dr. Raju's further work on this.

  

Warmly,

Manogna
