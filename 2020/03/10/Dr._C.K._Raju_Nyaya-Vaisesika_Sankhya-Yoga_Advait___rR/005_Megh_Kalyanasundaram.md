Namaste Yoga-ji,

  

I am actually not seeking a disagreement here and while I (think I) hear you, I personally welcome rigorous decolonisation literature that is empirically-sound.

And having been part of team that engaged formally (in writing) with CBSE last year, I must say my appetite for decolonised content has only increased.

To each, their own!🙏

  

Best,

Megh
