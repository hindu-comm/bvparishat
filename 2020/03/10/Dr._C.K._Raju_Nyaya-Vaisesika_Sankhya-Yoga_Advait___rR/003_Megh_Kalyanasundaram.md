"Clear proof of the experimental method is found in India, from 2,000 years before Bacon, but never acknowledged by the votaries of scientific temper, who ignore the evidence, and just peddle the myth of the Western origin of science.": Anyone disagrees? Or has anyone published this particular point before? Different strokes, different folks; to each their own. Emerging critiques of science itselfnotwithstanding, as a student of the Indian education system during my formative years, I cannot thank enough, scholars like Dr. Raju who have contributed substantively to the decolonisation enterprise (from an Indic point of view). What also resonates, personally with me at least, is foregrounding what different schools shared in common (for ex., the point on*Pratyaksh Pramana*). I, personally, am happy to read work that also brings forth"commonalities" rather than focusing only on the "differences", or doing that for the most part.
