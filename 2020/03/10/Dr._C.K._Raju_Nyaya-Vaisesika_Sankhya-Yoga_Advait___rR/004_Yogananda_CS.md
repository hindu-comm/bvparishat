Namaste Megh,

  

Am not sure if I am answering some of the statements or not - this is a hazy domain. The theme I have in mind is about existence of knowledge about certain concepts / products / .. versus using them to one's \`benefit' - word used in a broad sense. A baby example - earth being a globe, not flat. When did this attain significance and, so people thought it an important piece of information to be taught (and therefore tried to find the person who realised it first)? I would say, when humans tried to find a different route to India / China other than the silk route which had become difficultbecause of increasing robberies. So someone dared and tried going the other way, rough seas, and succeededin discovering a sea route. At that point of time the person who had heard about earth being a globe and dared to use it gets the first priority of the idea, later he himself may say, his teachers told him, who in turn may pass it backwards, . . .

  

regards...yoga
