At best a double-edged sword, that. The article falls under the rubric of 'we too'. Along with the seemingly positive statements, it communicates an inferiority in its need to be legitimated by science as we know it today. It also seems unaware that the very essence of this science is due to be re-examined. In light of this, the 'we too' sentiment comes across as a backhanded compliment. The strength of India is the Vedas, which are living knowledge unlike anything else human beings managed to preserve from other civilisations so far.
