Someone shared the following:

  

IBM Advt 47 years ago (1973). When the whole world was misled into believing that Algebra came from Arab civilization (Al-Jabr), this was how IBM came up with such fantastic print ads in international newspapers, acknowledging that Algebra had actually originated in India thousands of years ago. What a proud moment it must have been for young Indian engineers across the globe when the IBM openly refuted false propaganda, and rightfully gave the entire deserving credit to the three Indians!!
