Dear friends,

  

I take this opportunity to introduce a performing arts researcher from Odisha

who spent most of his life in researching about the scale of dramatic performances  

in Odisha. The folk dances held in huge open spaces attracted him and he

rebelled against the modern theater stage which he thought was an imposition.

He theorized that massive car festival in Puri was actually an arts festival

later attached with religious slant. The splendor and the grandeur of the

costumes, the carvings, the colors and the food made him to connect "people"

to the festivals.  

  

His name was Shri Dhiren Dash. He died young at age 65 in 1992. When

I was in college we did musical theaters together. He helped convert the massive

Barabati fort grounds in Cuttack to a five hundred foot stage the moat around

presenting as a reflecting pool. His idea was to recapture the cultural presentation

for the old Odia sailors. The event called "Bali Jatra" is still celebrated every year.

He tried to show the original theater word in Odia was jātarā, meaning a production

in an open air stage.

  

He continued his research to the Ranigumpha caves in Bhubaneswar (200BC)  

to show that the caves were a part of the royal palace with the quadrangle used  

as an open-air stage. He showed measurement from Natyashastra, speculating

that the construction measurements were older in practice than the Natyashastra.

I hosted him in 1991 and he helped produce an Indian operatic presentation in

Olympia, Washington on Jhansiki Rani by blending Odissi dance and the American

waltz and ballet in the production. It was historic. He passed away the

next year.

  

There is a memorial event in his honor on March 7 at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan

premises in Bhunbaneswar.. I made the attached slides for the occasion.  

They are in Odia. I am sharing since I do see other language scripts in the  

forum here. Odia linguistics and scripting are a part of separate analysis.

the title of the slides would translate to "OdiA Folk Theater Tradition and  

Shri Dhiren Dash"  

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
