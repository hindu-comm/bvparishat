It's a very good book, as per Ganeri's usual high standard.

However, seeing that Buddhist tathagatagarbha is very similar to the self, maintaining the no-self thesis might be good for organisational reasons, but not as helpful in terms of trying to work out what's going on. The more I see descriptions of nirvana and atman on the one hand and read accounts of physics on the other, the more it seems to me that the crux of the matter is this:

Formation of different kinds of attractors - visible things are a special case of such attractors - is made possible by gravity, which in turn is made possible by the curvature of space-time. It seems to me likely that, once energy enters an environment with gravity, it risks getting 'trapped' in the curvature and becoming a (potentially unwilling) participant of the cycles of existence. Whatever is called liberation or nirvana is somehow getting out of the curvature. This is done by 'editing' the energy that is 'oneself'. Looked at in this way, self vs non-self is the question whether or not there's still individuation of energy once there is no gravity and no time, but for those whose main problem is getting out of the cycles of gravity, the difference between self and non-self is purely cosmetic. Human beings can 'self-edit' in this way, and they do that by learning to direct attention. Meditation and various yogic practices have been found to lessen one's identification with the body and with the so-called physical.
