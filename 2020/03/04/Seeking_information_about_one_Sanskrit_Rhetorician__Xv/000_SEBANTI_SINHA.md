 Respected Sirs,

  In one place I came across one remark of oneSanskrit Rhetorician - Anandakavi Sreekantha. about Bhavik Alamkara. I want to know details about him and the book on Rhetoric he wrote and the link through which I may download the same. I searched much in [archive.com](http://archive.com) but could not detect anything about this. I will be grateful if you kindly help me in this regard.

                      With regards,

  

                                   
               Yours faithfully,

                                   
                 Ms. S. Sinha
