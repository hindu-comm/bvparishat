Nice verse, Murthy Ji. Unfortunately the fear of Coronavirus is spreading throughout the world and most countries including the USA are not prepared to deal with it. Several cases have been detected here in California and the hospitals are complaining that they do not have enough testing kits. Even the masks have disappeared from the stores.
People are hoarding essentials with the fear that more scary things are going tohappen. Many gatherings are being canceled and companies are restricting travel for their employees. The Trump administration is ill-prepared to deal with this crisis. I hope India fares better.
