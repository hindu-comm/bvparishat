I'm looking for the earliest description of the movements involved in tāṇḍava and their interpretations. Nāṭyaśāstra's 4th chapter contains a description of hand and foot movements as obtained from Taṇḍu, but is this the earliest?

Also, a side question out of curiosity: is it true that savukuthu (the spelling is probably wrong, since I reproduce the word by ear) as people in Tamil Nadu perform it in the street on occasion of death, a derivative fromtāṇḍava?

Maybe I need to also get hold of one of those thick handbooks ofŚiva worship that are easily available in India. If you know of a good handbook of this kind, rooted in traditional texts, please advise.

  

Thank you

Irene
