Respected scholars

My humble pranaamas

I am in need of Telugu translation of panchamochvasa of Harshacharitam and astamochvasa of uttarapeetika of Dasakumaracharitam.

I could trace out Andhra Harshacharitam by m.v. Ramanachari and Dasakumaracharitam by Sri Sangamesham of Umapublishers.

But my purpose of self study will not be fulfilled by these two Telugu translations.

Hence I humbly request scholars to help me in procuring the above mentioned books with Telugu translations.

Thanks in advance.
