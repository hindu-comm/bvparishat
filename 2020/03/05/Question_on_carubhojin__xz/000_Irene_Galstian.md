My concern is how carubhojin would have been used by Bhāskara the Vedic commentator. One option is that the word refers to a restrained abstemious eater in general, like what we understand today when we see that word. But it might also refer to one who eats only specifically caru left from the rituals that use that offering, and that's what my doubt is about. I've so far gathered and OCRdĀpastamba Dh/Gṛh/

### [Ś](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Arauta)r, since Bhāskara follows

Āpastamba more. In addition, he's quite precise in his instructions. For example, he doesn't say just kṛcchra, he specifies the 12-day kṛcchra, which is described in the ĀDhS. This makes me concerned that his use of carubhojin might point to something more specific than general food restraint in preparation for using the mantra.Which resource(s) can help clarify this?

  

Thank you
