Dear Sri Kaul,

In the shlokahquotedby you, Bhagwan is not commenting on कामना for कार्यफलं He says you cannot claim कार्यफलं as your right. The crucial word is अधिकारः

In a video once I developed this whole idea and showed how the fruit of action is a result of multiple factors that the act sets off. The fruit cannot be decided by the doer, as his act becomes a part of the past which is no longer under his control.

This shlokahis not an exhortation to Nishkam-karm, but an exhortation to act even though the doer cannot control what fruit his action would bear.

  

I have given here a link to my video. I am sure you will find my views convincing.
