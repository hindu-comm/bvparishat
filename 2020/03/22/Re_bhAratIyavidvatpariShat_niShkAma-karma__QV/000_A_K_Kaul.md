Shri S K Dogra ji,

Jai Shri Ram!

IMHO this is how the Bhagavadgita 2/47 has "defined" निष्काम-कर्म in its totality

कर्मन्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन।।  

मा कर्म फल हेतुर्भूर्मा ते सँगोSस्त्वकर्ममणि।।

Your right is to work only and never to the fruit thereof.

Do not consider yourself to be the cause of the fruit of action; nor let your attachment be to inaction. (Gita Press translation).

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul

Your right is to work only.
