Dear Vidwans,

  

Can the same star appear at two different places at the same time?

  

Is a letter to be defined by the place of its articulation or by the sound it makes to the human ear?

  

If there is more than one place for the articulation of a particular letter can all of them be taken to follow dharma?

  

So गोणी गोता गावी as words are as valid as गौः taken that ग and त can be phonated at many places?

  

Could this hypothesis that letters are distinguished by what sound they make rather than their specific place of articulation and their modulation be the basis of a treatise like the Ashtadhyayi?

  

It is therefore a matter of choice whether one follows the Panini tradition or gives himself to interpretations of convenience resulting in confusion.

  

According to Patanjali the purpose of grammar is to make one self free of doubt.

  

Is the Asthadhyayi together with the Maheshwar Sutras a Darshana treatise or otherwise (A systematic arrangement of word forms prevalent in society as grammar is thought to be now-a-days - A book of science)?

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve
