Namaste Vishalji,

The rule is the most general that the sakAra at the end of the pada becomes रुँ रेफ। The visargasandhi is a kind of a misnomer in the sense that visarga was never born, though Laghu may categorise it as a visargasandhi.

  

उच्चैस् उदात्तः

=उच्चैर् उदात्तः        ८.२.६६ ससजुषो रुँः। (उपदेशेजनुनासिक इत्। तस्य लोपः)।

  

Kind rgds,
