Dear Dr. Bhat,

  

  The R̥k-Prātiśākhya (1.8, 10) classifies *r̥* as a *jihvāmūlīya "*produced at the root of thetongue" and *r* as as either *dantamūlīya* produced at the root of the teeth"**or *barsvya* "alveolar. The Vājasaneyi-Prātiśākhya (1.65.68) classifies *r̥*as *jihvāmūlīya*and *r* as dental. The Śaunakīya Caturādhyāyikā (1.20, 28) holds the same view. For the Taittirīya-Prātiśākhya (2.18, 41) both *r̥* and *r* are alveolar. It is in some Śikṣās, which are generally late compared to the Prātiśākhyas, the classification of *r* as a *mūrdhanya*emerges and becomes commonplace in Pāṇinian commentaries.
