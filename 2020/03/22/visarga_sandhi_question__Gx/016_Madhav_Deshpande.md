Dear Radhakrishna Ji,

  

  I believe the Prātiśākhyas are giving us a glimpse of dialectal variation in Sanskrit. We don't know the details of these dialects most of the times. The R̥k-Prātiśākhya, for instance, attributes the change of ड>ळ, ढ>ळ्ह to Vedamitra, but this change now shows up in the Śākalya Saṃhitā as it is recited today. We don't know the relationship between Vedamitra and Śākalya. Similarly, the Vājasaneyi Prātiśākhya says: डढौ ळळ्हौ न सन्ति माध्यन्दिनीयानाम्. This difference between the Kāṇva and the Mādhyandina traditions is probably regional. The Mādhyandinas are mostly found in North India, while the Kāṇvas are found in Maharashtra and southern regions.
