Very interesting, prof. Deshpande ji.

  

In Malayalam we have two r's. Let me represent the "soft" r as r (ര) and the "hard" r asṟ (റ). Kari (കരി) with the soft r means burnt wood and kaṟi (കറി) with the hard r is the curry we eat with rice or roti. To the Malayali, even to a four year old child, these two r's are very distinct and interchanging them can change the meaning of words. The soft 'r' is pronounced with the tongue touching ("trilling") the place where the teeth and the roof of the mouth meet. Not sure if it should be termed alveolar or dental. The hard r is pronounced by touching the tongue farther back, "trilling" the roof of the mouth (not sure what to call it, mūrdhanya or jihvāmūlīya; maybe, I would call it just "retroflex"). Maybe, the ancient treatises you mention are dealing with these two different pronunciations of r.

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
