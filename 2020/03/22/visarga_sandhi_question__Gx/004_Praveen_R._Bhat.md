In a sandhi-kArya, you have to start from the pada with the suppratyaya ending considering what follows. When you start with a visarga ending उच्चैः instead of the avyaya which is originally उच्चैस्, you are already assuming that there is an अवसान or a full-stop/ pause. Then sandhi is not possible. However, when you know that सकार of उच्चैस् is followed by उकार of उदात्तः, there is no rule to substitute that सकार to विसर्ग but it is replaced by रेफ which never becomes a विसर्ग। That is why I said earlier that the name विसर्गसन्धि is misleading as विसर्ग was never there to become रेफ, सकार became रेफ\|

  

When you do sandhi viccheda though, an अवसान/ pause is assumed between the two words, which is why sandhi is not done. In that case, the following happens with the standalone word उच्चैस् now:

उच्चैस्

उच्चैरुँ          ससजुषो रुँः।

उच्चैर्           उपदेशेजनुनासिक इत्। तस्य लोपः।

उच्चैः।          खरवसानयोर्विसर्जनीयः। \<-- You can't start here; else there is no way to go back in त्रिपादी।

  

I hope that helps.
