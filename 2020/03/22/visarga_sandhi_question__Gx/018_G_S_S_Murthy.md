I request to be pardoned for taking the discussion off the track but I find it hard to suppress myself. I have observed a subtledifference in pronunciation of त in Kannada between नन्न **त**न्दे (my father) and नेन्ने **त**न्दे (\[I\] brought \[it\] yesterday). Can other Kannada knowing scholars here vouchsafe for this difference and if yes, is this difference discussed somewhere?

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
