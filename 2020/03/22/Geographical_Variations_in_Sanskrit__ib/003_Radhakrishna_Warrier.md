This is very interesting.  In what time period did poetRājaśekhara live?

  

My knowledge of Sanskrit is very limited, so I could not find any specific mention of the peculiarities of pronunciation (such as say geographical variation in pronouncingज्ञ as gya instead of as jña). I think his are more general statements like notatispaṣṭa, not atikliṣṭa etc. I may be wrong and he might be giving specific examples but with my meagre knowledge of Sanskrit I could not find those.

  

By its very name,Saṃskṛta indicates a language refined and standardized from spoken language(s) or spoken dialects. A refined and standardized language should not have any geographical variation. Geographical variation in Sanskrit pronunciation is the result of either insufficient education in proper pronunciation or inability (due to the undue influence of mother tongue) to pronounce certain sounds. In modern time, I find such peculiarities as the letterज्ञ being pronounced as gya, gna, dnya etc by even people who are well educated in Sanskrit.
Similar is the case with many other sounds.

  

Another matter is the use of different words for the same thing by speakers of different dialects of the same language. This is also a geographical variation. For example the same sugar might be known ascīnī in one dialect and as śakkar in another dialect. The person who uses the wordcīnī might be very familiar with the other word but when he or she asks "did you add sugar to the tea?" they might use the wordcīnī. The other person would use the wordśakkar in the same situation. I don't know if this sort of geographical variation can be discerned in Sanskrit. If it were a natural spoken language, it would have been possible. But is ceased to be so a very long time ago. It became a language that is intentionally learnt, after one has naturally acquired a mother tongue.
