Just remembered an example of a Sanskrit word with different meaning in different geographical regions.

  

Among its several meanings, the Sanskrit tatsama word mālēya has the meaning sandalwood in Malayalam. The literal meaning of mālēya is that which is from, or of malaya (mountain). I could not find the meaning sandalwood in famous Sanskrit dictionaries.

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
