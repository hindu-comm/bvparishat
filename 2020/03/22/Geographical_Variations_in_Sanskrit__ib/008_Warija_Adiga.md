Sorry, saw this question after posting my earlier reply..

  

"But there are several different pratishikshas, how come?"

I believe, there were more grammarians other than Panini, who would have codified grammar. But Panini’s version, became the most popular and got adopted, as different bhashyakars started explaining the cryptic sutras. Vedic Sanskrit does not have the strictness of Panini grammar. So, it is fair assume, Panini came up with the sutras to standardize the language based on what was prevalent there. Other versions may have been lost.

  

We do have different Shiksha. I would rather have the Sanskrit/Veda experts here to explain this subject though, as I have not researched in this area. My speculation is that the authors/ sages during that time, may have given their versions of Shiksha..Here, all the versions flourished, and people chose the ones they wanted to follow.. An interesting study would be to do a comparison between different Shikshas and see the common factors among them, and the differences as well. My assumption is commonalities will be more than the differences.

  

Incidentally, I found in the journal Shodha Samhita, volume IV - 2014-2016, (published by Kavikulaguru Kalidas Sanskrit University, Ramtek), Dr Jayvant Chowdhary has written a chapter - विविधशिक्षाग्रन्थेषु वर्णसंख्याविचारः., which lists the differences in the number of letters in Sanskrit according to different Shiksha! There may be other books/ research papers already available on comparative study of Shiksha.. If not, it is a good candidate for PhD thesis, I suppose..

  

Thank you,

Warija Adiga
