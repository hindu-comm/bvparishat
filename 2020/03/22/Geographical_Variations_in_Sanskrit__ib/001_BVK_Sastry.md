Namaste

1. By Shishta standards, there is no variation.

2. The 'osmosis' of Prakrut regional language pronunciation override on 'Shishta' standards set by Shikshaa and Pratishaakhya are aplenty.

 Classical resources to look for would be ' Samskruth- Prakruth' phonation studies.

 Prakruth schools have taken the basic ‘Shishta- uccharana for Varna-Maalaa’ ; but when it comes to ‘pada’ –vakya, dilutions and compromises are introduced.

 These are responsible for the ‘Geographical, historical variations in ‘Regional Sanskrit voicing’. They are not ‘ patha bhedas’ ; but speaker laxity to maintain ‘Shishtataa’.

 Dravidian tradition has two streams here: Classical and social models. Classical uses full range of Sanskrit varna-maalaa ( Grantha Scripted).

The footprints of these deviations can be a marker for the ‘ Sanskrit studies as well as localization of usage’. Jain works and Budhdist works have several evidences for this.
