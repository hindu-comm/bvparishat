Greetings!

  

Rajashekhar’s time=period is estimated to be 880-920 CE.

  

There are several points made in this discussion, I am taking the liberty of presenting my thoughts each point, based on my limited knowledge of Sanskrit.

  

**1. Local variations of pronunication**

I agree with your analysis here - Sanskrit being pure, it should not have local variations. However, currently we are missing the rigor of gurukulam education, and right pronunciation seems to be missing out 

Suggestion - Similar to the old “refining schools” of western etiquettes trainings , I feel, we should have the “pronunciation refinement classes” in our Sanskrit curriculum, starting from schools. It can begin with the train-the-teachers, so that the teachers clear their pronunciation flaws if any and get Sanskrit to its pristine form, even in pronunciation. Alternatively, have videos , with recitations, and explanations from experts, which people can use as the benchmark for pronunciation and guide themselves. As there are so many YouTube videos on different stotras, it is difficult to find out which is the correct pronunciation.. For example, the current Shivatandav Stotram being shared in YouTube, most ignore the sandhi/ visarga rules of pronunciation.

  

Here, I would like to share my personal experience. It took quite a while for me to understand differences in pronunciations and accept my flaws in my pronouncing Sanskrit words. First, I needed to be aware of my mistakes, then I needed to be convinced about the right way of pronouncing the letters, and then I had to unlearn what I used to think was right, and then consciously practice, and practice and practice to refine my pronunciation. (It is an ongoing process even now. Being a multi-lingual person means, one may carry the twinge of one language to another, and not be aware of it! Almost all of us in India speak two or more than 2 languages!).

  

When one is focusing to learn Sanskrit as a whole, there are so many factors one has to grasp, from grammar to usage, sandhi/ samas, etc etc; that it is easy to miss out on pronunciations niceties and mispronounce words, changing the meanings all together! The shruti parampara is gone, and we are more onto read and write mode, so slowly like the “udata, anudata, sarita” have disappeared from the texts, the rigors of pronouncing words correctly are taking a toll. I was lucky to have a classmate, who would painstakingly correct me, as soon as I would recite something. This helped me identify my blind-spots in pronunciations. Not everyone is that lucky to find such a mentor I guess. So in the absence of separate pronunciation classes, a video tutorial on pronouncing is a need of the hour. I listen to recorded lectures of my professor at KSU, as a benchmark and try to correct myself.. We really don’t know, how much baggage we carry!

  

Please note, I am not bringing up the Veda recitations here. It is beyond my scope of understanding and learning. I believe, different shakas have different forms of reciting the same mantra, and there are variations in sounds of letters like ष there. When I listened to पुरुषसूक्तं on YouTube videos, I did see different recitations having different pronunciations. This could be a completely new subject!

  

  

**2. Words meaning differently in different dialects**

Sanskrit words are context sensitive. The same word can have different meanings, based on where it is being used in the text. Hence, this constant debates on translations, etic vs emic discussions. For this reason, it becomes imperative that people read Sanskrit books in the original language and not depend on translations. This means that there are no short-cuts to enjoying Sanskrit literature but to learn the language first in totality and make it a passion. If one checks out some of the Upanishad, we see “इति शुश्रुम धीराणां “ being used in padas. I interpret this as disclaimers and feel, ancient ŗshis also expected us to use our own judgement as they passed on what they learnt from their gurus. 

  

Shabhdabodha cites many such examples of changes in Sanskrit., Lakshanik prayoga, rudhi-prayoga are explained on how the same word may change the meanings over the period of time. For example, the words, असुरः, राक्षसः developed negative connotations later on, while during the Vedic periods they were not used in that context. Similarly there are various examples given there. तैलम् meant only sesame oil, but now it means any oil.

So, if the interest is to see if there are local variations in Sanskrit, Shabdabodha could be a starting point. I would like to revisit that book, and understand more. 

  

If we consider the same word to have separate meanings in different dialects, it may allude to the dynamism of a language, be it Sanskrit or any other language for that matter. For example, we speak Kannada at home in Udupi. We normally use “battalu" to mean plate and “tatte” to mean small bowl, but my other relatives would consider “battalu” as bowl, and “tatte” as plates, and we always got into debates on which which was the correct Kannada!

  

Apart from the evolution of words and their impact, Sanskrit has another aspect one has to grasp -its importance on each syllable and “matra".
Each syllable, each note can change the meaning of a word, and lead to miscommunication. For example, भवति/ भवती have complete different meaning, so a person not being careful in ह्रश्व, दीर्घ differences, will become a joker.

  

  

**3. Dialects in Sanskrit**

When one reads Sanskrit books, be it Mrichakattikam, Uttarramcharitam, Dhwanyaloka etc, you will seen Prakrit and Sanskrit being used. Sanskrit is supposed to be kept pure, and not have any mistakes. So, it appears, general public were not expected to master Sanskrit and were allowed to speak in Prakrit, so as not to corrupt Sanskrit, while the ones who commanded the language spoke in Sanskrit. Since the mutual conversations were in Sanskrit/ Prakrit, it is understood, both parties knew both the languages, but chose to speak the language they were comfortable with. For example, one talking in Hindi, and the other replying in English or vice-versa..

  

  

  

Respectfully,
