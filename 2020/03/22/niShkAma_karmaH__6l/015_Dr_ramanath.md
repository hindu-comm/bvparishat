Dear Prof Dogra,  
kurvann eveha karmāṇi jijīviṣet śataṁ samāḥ \|  
evaṁ tvayi nānyatheto’sti na karma lipyate nare \|\|2\|\|  
  
By doing karma indeed should one wish to live here for a hundred  
years. For a man such as you (who wants to live thus), there is no  
other way than this, whereby karma may not cling to you.  

"Is there any place in the scripture where this expression has been  
used by Bhagwan himself?"  

As long as we want to live in this world – it is said to be ‘a hundred  
years’, a word used in the Upanishad indicating a very long life – we  
have to work. Nothing can be more valuable than life. One should not  
cut off life. The Manu Smriti says, “You should not extol, you should  
not condemn, but you should get on with the conditions that prevail  
according to the circumstances into which you are born.” In the light  
of the all-pervading nature of Isvara, God, do your duty.  
  
The word ‘duty’ is a specialisation of the Bhagavadgita. In the  
Isavasya Upanishad there is just a mention of action or work. By doing  
alone should you wish to live in this world. “There is nothing else  
that you can expect in this world. That is to say, we cannot expect  
complete cessation from action in this world. But we may be afraid  
that action may bind. Karma is supposed to react in the form of a  
nemesis.  
  
Are we not acquainted with an old saying that every action produces  
reaction? Yes, it is true that when a finite action is propelled in  
the direction of a finite fruit thereof, a reaction is set up in the  
direction of that agent of action from the fruit that is expected. But  
it is not so in the case of every action, because it need not  
necessarily proceed from a finite source.  
  
Finitude is a limitation of consciousness itself, and so consciousness  
bound to the finitude of existence can contemplate only a finite fruit  
that can accrue to it. And anything that is finite, is binding. So the  
cause, the ideation behind the performance of any work, should not be  
motivated by the finitude of consciousness, but by an infinitude of  
consciousness. Because of the fact that God is all-pervading,  
īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam,  
  
it is necessary for us to work, not because we have to expect anything  
in the form of a remote result that is to follow, but because action  
is a necessary characteristic, an automatic reaction produced by the  
finite mind and body, as long as consciousness continues to be in the  
mind and the body..  
With due regds  
Ramanath
