Respected scholars,

            Many people use the expressionनिष्काम कर्मः to describe the philosophy of Srimad Bhagwad Geeta. In my opinion this is highly reductionistic and badly distorts the extremely subtle formulations about karma given in Sri Geeta. In my Facebook group Hinduism I plan to start putting up videos explaining the shlokahsof Srimad Geeta. There, I wish to dispel what I consider to be a misinterpretation of Sri Geeta centred around the expressionनिष्काम कर्मः I have not seen this expression used in Srimad Geeta. Is there any place in the scripture where this expression has been used by Bhagwan himself?

  

My grateful thanks for your time.

  

Regards,

Dogra, Chennai
