Dear Shri Kamalesh,

  

"We have to do our work as duty but without expecting the result or fruits as return,"

  

This indeed is how people take nishkaam karma to be. But is it necessary to try to sum up a complex philosophy in the form of a two-word expression and thereby distort it?

  

Why should one not expect the results or fruits of one's actions?

Without such expectationhow does one choose among various options of duties one could perform?

  

I think remaining with the original shlokahsgives better answers. Constricting them into a two-word phrase does not help.

  

Before rejecting this expression, I just wanted to make sure that the expression is not used somewhere in the Geeta. Now I feel sure it is not.

  

Regards,

Dogra
