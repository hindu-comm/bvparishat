Venkat Ji,

I know I am in the midst of scholars who have spent long years in acquiring wisdom of the Sanskrit scriptures. By contrast I am a toddler. And yet I believe that sometimes the blank slate of an infant records what others could not observe. So, I would like to go ahead with my independent approach with the hope that somewhere down the line we will meet with a clearer vision.

  

Regards,
