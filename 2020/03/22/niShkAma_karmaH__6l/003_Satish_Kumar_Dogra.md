Respected Shri Subramanian,

I am aware of the shlokahsfrom which a kind of nishkaam-karmaphilosophy can be extracted. In my analyses I wish to show how the lines drawn and the limitations set by these shlokahs are extremely subtle and cannot be constricted by a two-word expression such as nishkaam-karmah. My question was not whether there are shlokahsthat point in the direction of a nishkaam-karma type philosophy, but whether these exact words have been used by Bhagwan himself, or it is someone else who introduced this expression to sum up the philosophy.

  

I wanted to know this because, in my own study of Srimad Geeta, I have not come across this expression in any of the shlokahs.

  

Thanks for your response,

and regards.
