The full form of Karma Yoga (karmayogah) is karmaphalasannyaasayoga , karma here being puNyakarma or vihita karma.

  

In popular parlance , nishkaama is being used in the sense of phalasannyaasa, phalatyaaga.

  

phala being referred to here is the puNyaphala resulting from the vihitakarma or puNyakarma. Not the direct phala part of the action.

  

visargah karma sajnitam. mitraaya svaahaa, mitraaya idam na mama. sampradade idam na mama are the expressions of visarga(h).  

  

nishkaama is being used in the sense of 'na mama' visarga feeling.

  

The direct phala part of the action of daana is deya/datta reaching the graheetr/graheeta. nishkaama does not mean not desiring the reaching of the deya/datta to graheetr/graheeta.

  

It refers to no desire for the puNyaphala accrued by the vihitakarma.

  

What is needed is not the change of term, proper explanation of the term.
