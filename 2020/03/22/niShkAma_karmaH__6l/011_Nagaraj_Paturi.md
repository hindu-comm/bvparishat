Karma of Trivarga (Dharma Artha & Kaama ) saadhana does not involve puNyaphalasannyaasa /puNyaphalatyaaga.

  

Karma of Chaturthavarga (Moksha ) saadhana involves puNyaphalasannyaasa /puNyaphalatyaaga.

  

What is hypocritically , unduly and unnecessarily being done by some pravachanakaaras is laughing at and despising trivargasaadhana attitude without a chaturthavarga saadhana attitude.

  

It is as part of this approach that nishkaamakarma is hypocritically , unduly and unnecessarily being pushed. The result is the discussion of the kind that is brought in by the present thread.

  

What is discouraged by the scriptures is desiring artha and kaama against dharma. dharmabaddha arthakaama saadhana is not discouraged by the scriptures.

  

Kaama (desire) for Artha (power and wealth) and Kaama (pleasure) through the path of Dharma is not discouraged. Nishkaamakarma does not mean no Kaama (desire) for Artha (power and wealth) and Kaama (pleasure).

  

The nishkaamakarma , if used in the sense of puNyaphalasannyaasa /puNyaphalatyaaga, is applicable only for the Chaturthavarga (Moksha ) saadhana. Scriptures do not impose Chaturthavarga (Moksha ) saadhana on all people. As such, they do not impose nishkaamakarma , in the sense of puNyaphalasannyaasa /puNyaphalatyaaga on all people.
