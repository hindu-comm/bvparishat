I did a Ramakrishna Mission book entitled SriKrishna Yoga, published 2005.

I do analyze the topic in my way. It is based an MIT interpretation that Swami

Sarvagatananda developed in 1997.  You may refer. The book should be available  

through Amazon or the Mission store.

  

I am in Bhubaneswar (home isolation), flying to Delhi on March 30 and returning to the US on April 2.
