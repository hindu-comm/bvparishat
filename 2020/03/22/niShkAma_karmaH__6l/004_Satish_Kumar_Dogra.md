What exactly is nishkaam? The expression nishkaam-karmahdoes not contain the implication of "fruit of action". It tends to create the impression of "an act not driven by desire". This goes counter to a modern understanding of psychology and theories of motivation. Even if I do all my acts in order to follow the teachings of Bhagwan Krishna, even that is a desire. There is a motive --- a force that impels me to act (cf motive comes from mot --- to move). Something has to move me to act. That is the motivating desire.

  

If I am to do my कार्यं कर्म (अनाश्रितः कर्मफलं...) the decision of what is my कार्यं कर्म would require operation of thoughts generated by structure of thoughts, priorities, and sanskaaras. The decision about what is my कार्यं कर्म in a particular situation cannot jump out of thin air. The focus in Srimad Geeta, therefore, is about distancing oneself from the "fruit of action", not from the motivating desire.

  

This why I consider nishkaam-karma to be a misleading expression and wish to know whether it has been used by Bhagwan anywhere in the Geeta.

  

Thanks and regards.
