Some of the scholars and Sanskrit poets have started composing verses on the theme of Corona virus.  
  
1.  
हस्तयोः परस्परग्रहेण साधिता पुरा  
मित्रतेति कारणात् करो न वैरसाधनम् \|  
साम्प्रतं परिस्थितिं विलोक्य शङ्कया जनै-  
र्दत्तपाणिराकुलैररातिवत् हि गण्यते \|\|  
  
Earlier, a shake-hand was an instrument to create (new) friendships, and therefore it was certainly not considered a वैरसाधनम्. But these days, owing to the present circumstances, anyone who offers his/her hand is viewed as an enemy by the worried people.

2.  
पश्य पश्य रे करोनदारुणस्वरूपिणीं  
सूक्ष्मदर्शनां तथापि तावतीं भयङ्करीम् \|   
ब्रह्मचारिणोऽपि ये चरन्ति नष्टविक्लवा-   
स्त्रासिता यया द्वितीयमाश्रमं प्रवेशिताः \|\|  
  
Look at the dreadful coronavirus, which despite being extremely tiny is nevertheless quite fearsome. So much so that, even the usually carefree bachelors have been forced to sit at home and therefore become "गृहस्थाs" (due to the work-from-home policies all over).

3.  
भस्मासुरविनाशार्थं सिद्धा विष्णुस्वरूपिणी \|  
मोहिनी वञ्चिता जाता करोनास्पर्शवारणात् \|\|  
  
All the planning of Mohini to destroy Bhasmasura went in vain, because Bhasmasura was also practicing Corona hygiene, and thus unlikely to touch his own head even if Mohini were to lead him into doing it.

4.  
मुखं मा स्पृश हस्तेन वदन्ति सकला जनाः \|  
किं करिष्याम्यहं हन्त! शोकेनाह दशाननः \|\|  
  
  
"Don't touch your face with your hand" says everybody around here. Nobody understands how hard this is for me! - exclaimed Ravana with sadness.

5.  
सीतान्वेषणसिद्ध्यर्थं रामदत्ताङ्गुलीयकम् \|  
स्वच्छीकृत्यैव जग्राह स्पर्शभीत्या स मारुतिः \|\|  
  
Out of fear (of touching metal surfaces), Hanuman made sure to carefully wipe the ring before accepting it from Rama, which was given to him for the purpose of making his mission of finding Sita successful.

6.  
  
करारविन्देन पदारविन्दं  
मुखारविन्दे विनिवेशयन्तम् \|  
भीत्या यशोदा तनयं ययाच  
प्रक्षाल्य पादावनुवर्तयेति \|\|  
  
Yashoda, on seeing Krishna place his पदारविन्दम् in his मुखारविन्दम्, pleaded with him - "Dear son! Continue doing so, not a problem, but please make sure to wash your legs first!"
