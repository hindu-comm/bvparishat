On how rhetoric trumps intellect etc. & how to combat misinterpretations galore:

I chanced upon a sensible statement of Ayn Rand (useful to many of us) :

### Ideas cannot be fought except by means of better ideas. The battle consists, not of opposing, but of exposing; not of denouncing, but of disproving; not of evading, but of boldly proclaiming a full, consistent, and radical alternative.
