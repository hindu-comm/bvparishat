I had to explain Phone, Phoneme and Allophones with Tamil examples as follows :

  

> 
> > Tamil speakers clearly distinguish the phones (speech sound units) > 'p', 'b', and 'v', for example. For example, 'b' is pronounced when > the speech sound (represented by ப் ) follows a nasal 'm' (as in > amba). When the samespeech sound (represented by ப் ) occurs between > two vowels ( for example as in Go***p***alan ), itis pronounced as > 'v' ( kōvālān ). In other circumstances, the samespeech sound > (represented by ப் ) is pronounced as 'p' only. Thus 'b' of amba, 'v' > of kōvālān and 'p'in other words are variants of one and the same the > samespeech sound (represented by ப் ). The samespeech sound > (represented by ப் ) is called 'phoneme' and 'b' of amba, 'v' of > kōvālān and 'p'in other wordsare called allophones of each other. > Similarly it can be shown that 'k' 'g' and 'h' are allophones to each > otheri.e., variants of the same phoneme represented by 'க்' . Tamil > script (as do most scripts ) is designed to represent phonemes.
