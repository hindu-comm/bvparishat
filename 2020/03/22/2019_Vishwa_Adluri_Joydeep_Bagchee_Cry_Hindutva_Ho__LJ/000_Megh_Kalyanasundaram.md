"This piece addresses the misuse of 'Hindutva' in contemporary South Asian studies. In response to criticisms of the so-called text-historical method in Indology, the old guard of academia raises the spectre of Hindutva to scare off critics. With such anti-intellectual tactics, Indologists have betrayed liberal ideals. Originally submitted to South Asia: The Journal of South Asian Studies in response to Eli Franco's review of The Nay Science, this piece makes a larger case for a discipline-critical philology. If we are to reclaim the university as a place for open dialogue and debate, we must continue the critique of professorial privilege. Facile self-righteousness must not become a cover for intellectual vacuity."
