Namaste Murti jee,

  

No worries. I got to be aware of the words Etic and Emic recently, as well.

  

Etic - when someone from outside a culture is studying that culture

Emic - when someone within the culture studying about their own culture.

  

Dr Radhakrishnan, Swamy Vivekananda writing about Hindu philosophies, is Emic.

Swamy Dayanand Saraswati’s explanation of Veda is Emic.

Maxwell’s work on Vedas is Etic.

  

Maybe this picture will give a better clarity in the definitions -

Thank you for reading and discussing..

  

Respectfully,

Warija
