To know that there three sounds p, b and v in Tamil, there is no need to talk to native Tamil speakers. But to know that the three make the same phoneme, thai is, for a phonemic understanding , one needs to talk to native Tamil speaker.

  

So phon**emic** understanding is with /from the native speaker and phon**etic** understanding is possible even from outside.

  

So even in Cultural Studies, emic understanding is with/from the culture-insiders and etic understanding is possible even from outside.
