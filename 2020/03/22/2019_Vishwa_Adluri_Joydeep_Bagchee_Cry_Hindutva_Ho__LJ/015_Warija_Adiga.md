Thank you Prof Paturi-jee,

  

You have provided good sources of information, and I would like to study further and will refine the picture accordingly..

  

However, with what I have understood so far, I would like to summarize different scenarios as follows:

  

1\. Pre-conditioned way of thinking and viewing things like looking through a tinted glass.

1.aIf a person is looking through a pink glass, the world will seem pink to him.

1.bIf the person is forced to remove the pink glass, the conditioning of his mind is such that he continues to see the world as pink. He may think his eye-organs has issues, and may refuse to believe what he is seeing and will hang-on to his old views dogmatically.

 1. cThe person does not want to remove the glasses, and when he is made aware of real pictures, instead of believing the new data, he forces others to wear the pink glasses instead. His resolution is to make others see what he sees, and not see what others see. He has not seen anything different in his life and in his heart, he is doing good by creating the pink glass for others, instead of removing his own glass.

  

2\. Agenda driven viewing

    2.a The person is able to see the things as they are but for his own personal gains or egos, he goes and creates pink windows for others to look through. A baby elephant tied with a rope in childhood, grows up to believe that rope is not breakable. So when it grows up big and mighty, it still believes the rope hold is not-breakable and remains in bondage. With such a long-term strategy, these agenda-driven players, keep on publishing content so that people who depend on secondary sources, continue to believe in what the players want them to believe. The psy-ops being played by media barons and some countries on others, is an example of such diabolical movements. Selective reporting, misinformation, disinformation, confusing people with big jargons and slipping your versions, etc, etc. are different games that we see being played, when we read many of the texts.

  

3\. Open viewing

   3.a There are people, who genuinely don’t know about the glasses they are wearing. Once the glass is removed, they accept the new views for what they are.

   3.b  People with clean sights, and wearing no glasses. As Somerset Moughom quoted in one of his books “To look the truth in the eye and not resent it when it is not palatable” . The real Rshis. Like, the shloka says -

 कोलाहलकाककुलस्य जाते विराजते कोकिलकूंजितं किम्। परस्परं संवादां खलानां विधेयं मौनं सततं सुधीभिः।

 Unfortunately, their voice gets lost in the din.

  

  

From the references and quotations shared, Etic/ Emic may not be the appropriate terms/ classifications. I will have to rework the representation, which is to depict Indology in a nut-shell.

  

  

This discussion has been very useful for me and is an eye-opener.

  

Thank you all for the inputs,

  

Respectfully,

Warija Adiga
