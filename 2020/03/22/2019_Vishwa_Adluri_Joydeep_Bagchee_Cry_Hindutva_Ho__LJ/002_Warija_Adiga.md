Greetings!

Since this thread seems to be on representations and misrepresentations on Indology, I am sharing a a pictorial representation of different perspectives of Indic studies here. As per my limited understanding of Indology, I have summarized different perspectives under 3 basic categories - pre-colonial, colonial and post-colonial periods. The red-boxes signify the motives or agenda behind the studies and green ones are the tools or methods used. This is a very simplistic diagram with the intent to get **to get inputs from the respected scholars here.**

  

My goal is to draw an overall, neutral picture of Indology as it has evolved over the period of time. To keep it simple, I have not included the traditional studies of darshanas, with astik vs nastik (पौरुषेय/ अपौरुषेय वेदः) Jaindarshanam, Boudhadarshanam Advaita, Dvaita etc etc, as they all fit into India as a whole. This is more to do with the pot being stirred from outside, when outsiders started getting into India for trade and they brought their own perspectives in learning about Indian literature.

  

This picture does not show all these details, but just lays out a crude bird's eye view of Indic studies. Feedbacks, good or bad are welcome and highly appreciated.

  

Thanking you,

Respectfully yours,
