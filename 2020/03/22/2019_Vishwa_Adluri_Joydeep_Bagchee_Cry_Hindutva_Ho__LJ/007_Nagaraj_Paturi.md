Since these words come from my field(s), may I ?

  

The words Emic and Etic come from the words Phonemic and Phonetic respectively, of Linguistics.

  

Originally they are -emic and -etic (phon-emic , phon-etic) and later settled as Emic and Etic.

  

Phonemic = Phoneme-related; Phonetic = phone related

  

Phone of a language is a unit (minimum part of ) speech utterance of that language. Phoneme is a meaning-wise significant phone of that language or a phone symbolically representing a group of (mutual) Allophones. (Allophones are phones that can be substituted for each other, that can be treated as different versions of each other ).

  

Sri G S S Murthy-ji was asking about different pronunciations of t in Kaanada in different pronunciation-environments , (pronunciation-environment of a phone is the phones pronounced before and after that phone ). These differently pronounced versions of t are Allophones to each other. All the mutualAllophones together make a Phoneme.

  

A non-native observer of a Phonetics/Phonology of a language can identify Phones of that language just by carefully observing all the speech utterances of that language and by breaking them into minimum units, without any need of talking to the native speaker. But to be able to know which Phones of the language are meaning-wise significant or which Phones are mutual Allophones, he needs to know the meaning of those utterances from the native speaker.

  

Phonemic understanding is based on the native speakers' meanings ,( which are collective convention of the native speakers ) to the speech sounds of the language. Phonetic understanding does not need such info from the native speakers. The researcher-observer can get it by oneself .

  

This analysis is extended to the study of culture and

  

(Understanding of (the culture based on )) the culture insiders' / tradition insiders' collective convention is called -emic or Emic understanding.

  

Understanding of the culture not based on the culture insiders' / tradition insiders' collective convention is called -etic or Etic understanding.

  

Hope this helps.
