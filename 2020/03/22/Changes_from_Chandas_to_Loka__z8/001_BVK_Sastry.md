Namaste

On \< What are the **changes in grammar, meaning and pronunciation from Chandas to Loka**? I am particularly interested in **collating constructs allowed in Loka but not in Chandas**. \>

1. The 'chandas'terms are part of the ' Mantra suktas = seeing the saying' = Vak-Darshana'.

 The document of this 'seeing/ audition' is 'voice record' called 'Mantra' and organized as Sukta.

 There is no' original speakers pronunciation' ( mukha-naasikaa prayatna - uccharana); at least as the traditional thinking goes.

 The ' mantra/ chandas -pronunciation as 'varna-pravaaaha' is regulated by the rules of Shikhsaa, Pratishaakhya, Chandas, Vyakarana for the totality of sa-sawara human articulation in the yajna application.

 The grammar of Chandas is integral to the document; the meaning is to be constructed in the context of application, following the ' Nirukta' procedure of multilayered explanation. Sayana provides the 'adhi daiva' used in Karma-Kanda. Vedantacharyas provide the 'adhyatma' meaning.

 The 'change in Chandas' is called the ' Yajnika -sampradaya' coming under the scope of answering the question: Why study Vyakarana ? 'Rakshaartha Vedaanaam'. The Changas to Mantra terms are to be made following the Chandas rules.

2 . On Changes in \< What are the changes in grammar, meaning and pronunciation from **Chandas to Loka**? I am particularly interested in **collating constructs allowed in Loka but not in Chandas**.\> :

  

 2A: First model is Yaajnika vidhi system where mantra is contextualized and used in a laukika yajna.

 The changes in swara, and pronunciation are regulated by Viniyoga vidhi, vyakarana, Pratishaakhya, Patha-Krama and sampradaya.

 This is the totality of rule frame. What is surviving residual practice at current is any body's personal assessment.

 As on date, it has become extremely complex and confusing to fix these norms ( beyond a faith trust tradition continuity model) even for the most common mantras of Purusha sukta,

 rudra-prashna, Sri sukta, Ganapathyatharva...Gayatri mantra...

 Acharya Shraddhaa seems to be the only shield left for one to carry on defense of the position.

 We are yet to see around/ listen to Mantra -Siddhas like Kapali shastry or Mantra-Drashta's like Brahmarshi Daivarata or Periyavar, Swamigal and the like.

 Faith cannot be argued out with any logic !

 2B: Second model \<Chandas constructs allowed in loka \> and
Loka word formations in Sanskrit: related grammar, meaning and pronunciation.

 Paninian rules for 'Bhashaa-pada' are deeply connected to 'Vaidika' padas. Every 'pada' need not be connected to a ' dhatu'. That is for Nirukta sampradaya.

  The 'Bhashaa' padas are formed by the 'vivakshaa', by inputting 'prakruti' pada (=Base terms) as given by the user.

 The meaning of the base tern is fixed by the world. Grammarian does not decide this. ( tadashishyam, samjnaa-pramaanatvaat; lokatah).

  'Prakruti- pada' includes all given base words as input for processing to the 'bhashaa-grammar engine (as a generative grammar
model). The language-meta tag does not matter.

 Whether one gives the input 'prakruti pada' as a term, like- 'Computer- from English to designate a plethora of devices and processes in a fuzzy way' Or Turkish term 'pitor', Hebrew term as 'Azura Mazda ( to mean a sacred being of different kind) - the user defines the values and passes it on to the generative engine; and sets the communication processing parameters for the processes by Sup-ting- Pratyaya Vibhakti- parameters. Once this is made, the rest of the process is ' grammar engine decided , technically'. The technical output is not worried about the' end users ease of pronunciation, Grimms law , community of users et al. It is simply a technical output, grammatically perfected to carry the user intended meaning.

  If the user community (One or more) makes a compromise on the technically perfected grammar output in pronunciation ( like adding ' mahodaya, to a complex name, to avoid the sup-vibhakti processing complexity), and accept it as a working modality, the final term gets moved out to the tag of 'Prakruth language'\[ or in other words, technically diluted Sanskrit word, using the trick of Samasa, Taddhita and the like). The user compromise is coded as 'Prakrtuh specific Grammar rule OR simplified Sanskrit rule.

The term thus tagged to have become a 'member of the Prakruth language class' may carry the proximate meaning to a vedic term, a bhashaa term,
BUT it does not match the technical perfection of Ashtaadhyayi - Bhashaa processing. 'Does the Sanskrit Language social user community needs such a perfection with all its associated complexity? Or ' prefers to go by 'Simplified Sanskrit for social outreach and popularity' is an entirely different question.

  In language-market parlance, this is comparable to the 'Gold modeling phenomenon'. 'Chandas' is pure gold 24 Karat. As it occurs in 'Nature'. Bhashaa is processed out of 'Chandas' to become an ornament. Depending on the copper addition, the gold ornament still shines, serves a purpose, a processed output ( as it does not occur so in the nature). There can be simulations which are made of other metals and quoted to shine - look alike a gold ornament ( for its looks) and reduced cost of processing / rough usability. These are called 'gold's' of lower standards; till it boils down to ' imitation gold'. If one goes only looks alike and shine, everything looks same. The real test to filter out the terms is like gold testing using the ' appropriate tests and grammar processing machines for the ' rest of the forms'.

 It is here that the traditional schools and modern linguists differ. For traditionalists, 'keshaam Shabdaanushaasanam ? Vaidikaanaam, laukikaanaam cha ; vede bhavah vaidikaah; loke bhavaah laukikaah'.
loka' here is not constrained to 'socio-historical' bearings of nomad community panegyrics. The term 'loka' covers several dimensions of existence as explained by Patanjali. Modern Linguists do not believe in the 'transcendental, beyond the planet earth marked nations and human civilizations' .

 Therefore, the real issue to be sorted out is : Sanskrit Language Modeling' as set in the Vedanga model by Panini-Patanjali- Yaska as ' Yoga-Samskrutham= Vak-Yogah'. The kavya and shaastra literature provides the allowed 'Shishta' constructions. The
deterioration of 'Yajnika samskruth' as 'Chandas diluted/ simplified/ sitorted' can be seen in many ritual usages of vedic chants ! and fancy explanations for the same. One such amusing allegoric reference was identifying ' Corona' in a Vedic Mantra' that went viral in social media recently .

P.S. I am still working on the threaded points of our exchange separately. That will cover more details on this.
