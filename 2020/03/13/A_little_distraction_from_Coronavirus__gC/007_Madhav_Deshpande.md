Dear Venkatesh Ji,

  

  This is so true, especially for retired folks like me. Large portions of our retirement funds are invested in the stock market and now it has fallen more than 30% in just the last 10 days. Everyday, I watch the massive financial destruction with trepidation. In my 74 years of life \[I turn 74 tomorrow\], I have never been more worried than now. God willing, this too shall pass.
