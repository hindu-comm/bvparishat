Thank you HN Bhat-ji.  
  
That was my understanding too....  
that अवदान्य is opposite of वदान्य. Tthank you for confirming the etymology.  
  
However I was intrigued by the footnote mentioned in my first message. Is it possible, ever, to obtain  
अवदान्य from अवदान or some other base word  
and have a meaning other than “अनुदार, कृपण, कुत्सित ...”?  
  
Regards  
Prabhu
