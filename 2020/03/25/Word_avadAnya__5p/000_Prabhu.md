In most dictionaries अवदान्य’s meaning is akin to “illiberal” and that word is synonymous of अनुदार, कृपण, कुत्सित and so on…  
  
In this:  
The Upanishads  
TRANSLATED BY  
F. MAX MULLER  
(<https://archive.org/details/p2upanishads00mluoft/page/206/mode/1up>)  
  
the footnote on page 206 says:  
“ ...  
Avadanya has never been met with in the sense of niggardly, and though a rule of Panini sanctions the formation of  
a-vadanya, it does not say in what sense.  
...  
“  
May I request how अवदान्य is actually obtained, if not from वदान्य?  
  
Thanks and Regards  
Prabhu
