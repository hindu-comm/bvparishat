Freedom poetry has its own genre. it is difficult to relate in a free country.

I did one stanza through the whole morning.

  

Pledge, O' Fighter! Pledge!  

  

O' fighter, pledge, do pledge!

Arise my brother, never give an edge!

Pledge to your Mother, pledge to your land!

Touch her my brother, give her your hand!

Let her holiness cleanse you over!

Let her blessings be with you for ever!

Steadfast through myriad waves of destruction,

She has offered you affection and protection!

Pledge to your Mother, pledge to your land!

Touch her my brother, give her your hand!

O' fighter, pledge, do pledge!

Arise my brother, never give an edge!

  

More editing would be required. I would crawl with your blessings.,
