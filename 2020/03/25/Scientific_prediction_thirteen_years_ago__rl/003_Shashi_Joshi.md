Translating poetry is the toughest task, that too between Indic and non-Indic languages!.

Do you focus on the words, meaning, alaMkAra, narrative, meter ... ?  
Mostly the essence is gone. One might as well translate it as prose.

Good luck! You will need it.

  

But, what better way to spend some quality time, immersing in pitRi-chintan!

  

  

Thanks,
