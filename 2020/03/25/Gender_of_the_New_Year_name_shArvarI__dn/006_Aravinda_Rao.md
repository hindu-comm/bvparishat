I was having the same doubt. Thanks for clarification. The panchanga which I read in the morning told that this year is the

bringer of diseases, sorrow and battles among kings. Sharva, referring to Shiva, means saMhAraka as

the dhatu shruu relates to hiMsA. All this seems to be tallying with what we are seeing in the form of corona.
