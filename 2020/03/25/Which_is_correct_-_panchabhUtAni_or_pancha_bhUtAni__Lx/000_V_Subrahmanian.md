Here is a line from a composition of Sri Sadashiva Brahmendra:  

  

  

जनिविपरीतक्रमतोबुद्ध्या प्रविलाप्य पञ्चभूतानि । (samasta पञ्चच तानि भूतानि)

  

Some editions have the last word as vyasta.

  

I also see usages like पञ्च पाण्डवाः

  

Which usage is correct and why? Are both usages alright? Is there a rule that it has to be one way alone and not the other?

  

Clarification welcome
