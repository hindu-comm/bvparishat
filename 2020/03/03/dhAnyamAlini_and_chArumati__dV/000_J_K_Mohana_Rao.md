Dear friend,

  

I would like some information on dhAnyamAlini (wife of rAvaNa) and charumati (daughter of kRshNa and rukmiNI). What I know is dhAnyamAlini tried to take steps by advising rAvaNa not to covet sItA. Not much is known about chArumati except that she seems to be the only daughter of kRishNa mentioned.

  

sidebar: There is a beautiful poetic metre named chArumati in Telugu.

  

Regards - mOhana
