Friend scholars,

Here is my bimonthly article through Valmiki.

I write these to present Valmiki's storytelling for our new youth.

I am way behind in my formal translation effort, but proceeding slowly.

The link for the current article is:  

<https://vidyapeeth.dwarkamai.com/index.php/articles/147-reflections-on-valmiki-ramayna-a-xxxii-sugriva-the-friend-part-ii>

Volunteers at the local Sai Temple help in archiving these.

I am attaching the Hindi translation that comes out from Bhopal, India.

I appreciate the help and discussion through many friends and participants

in the Forum. I will be in Odisha for the month of March on the occasion of

my father's centenary.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
