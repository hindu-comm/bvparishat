नमो विद्वद्भ्यः।

  

Could someone point me to a legible commentary of Naishadha-charita or provide a clear snapshot of 13.26 with TIkA? Someone had a question on the same and now the discussion is all over theplace, (the focus being on रत्नैरलङ्करणभावमितैर्नदीनः)!

  

नासीरसीमनि घनध्वनिरस्य भूयान्कुम्भीरवान्समकरः सहदानवारिः ।  
उत्पद्मकाननसखः सुखमातनोति रत्नैरलंकरणभावमितैर्नदीनः ॥ १३.२३ ॥  
  
The only commentary I could find was on [archive.org](http://archive.org) which isn't clear to me:<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.312559/page/n83/mode/2up>  

  

  

Kind rgds,
