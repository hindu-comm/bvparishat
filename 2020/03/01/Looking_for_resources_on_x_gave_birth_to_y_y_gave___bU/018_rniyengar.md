There is a cyclic statement in RV that appears to be the cosmic progenitor of all such chicken-egg relations. See RV 10.72

  

4 *Earth sprang from the Productive Power the regions from the earth were born.*  

*Daksa was born of Aditi, and Aditi was Daksa's Child.*

*5 For Aditi, O Daksa, she who is thy Daughter, was brought forth.*

*After her were the blessed Gods born sharers of immortal life.   
(Griffith)*

*  
*

I have doubts about the translation of RV (10.72,4.a) above of Griffith. How Uttaanapada can be taken as productive power?. Also Aas'aa can mean directions (E-W,N_S) instead of just 'regions'. Otherwise Daksha being the son of Aditi, while Aditi is the daughter of Daksha sounds like an early physical model of 'directions' (Aas'aa) getting formed for beings on Earth. The present, OUR Sun is called MaartaaNDa that is a part-dead-egg out of which earthen life comes out to be cyclic that is birth-death-birth, presumably till MaartaaNDa is alive as He is. Other interpretations may be possible.
