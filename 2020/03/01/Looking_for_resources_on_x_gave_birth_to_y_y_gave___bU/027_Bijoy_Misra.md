Dear Irene,

Words may not be representative of the hierarchy. Naming of people now does become repetitive.

Valmiki gives various genealogy without repetition. In the cosmological cases, the names repeat

in cycles. In such situation the name is a common noun belonging in a class. In modern Astronomy,

a planet with the possibility of water circling a star is "erath-like" and in course of time, the concept

can make "earth" as a common noun.

Do you want to explore cosmology or the process of terminology? The latter would be historical,

the former would be conceptual. "fire" of any age is any fire, and there is no unique "fire".

Indian cosmology is very different from a linear historical cosmology as seen elsewhere.

"multiple universes" and the "recycle of life" are not refuted but are too dense to handle in the

new world. So we operate in the current "Manu", how did Narada become Kapila is only

conceptual now. I would agree with you that the texts may exist in still undiscovered

literature.  

Hope I am clear in the note.

Best regards,

BM
