In the context of the conversation on the thread, the translations weren't out of place. Just because I've quoted translations doesn't mean that they are all, or even most, of what I'm occupied with.

As for declarations and other polemic, these are but opinions - not more, not less. Expressions like 'study hard and check', to my mind, have more to do with digging trenches or selling potatoes than studying the Vedas - clearly our perceptions differ. Now what can be done about that? Let's say you have a favourite tree in the park, to which you walk past other trees you don't particularly enjoy. Do you stop by each one and debate with it why it's not the tree that's more to your liking? Do you perceive your favourite tree as completely isolated, or is it standing together within the background of these other, less pleasing to you, trees, even in your mind's eye? Or perhaps you walk past the other trees, such as they are, to sit down fully enjoy the shade and welcoming presence of your favourite tree?
