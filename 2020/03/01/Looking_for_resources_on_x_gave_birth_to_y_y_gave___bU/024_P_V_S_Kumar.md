I understood this question as follows:

  

We have a tradition of 'naming the grandson with the same name as of the grandfather'. As this cycle continues, it appears like tree-seed-tree or chicken-egg-chicken cycles. In the case of tree-seed, chicken-eggor ordinary humans, there may not be much need to identify a particular individual by their name in the long cyclical name-chain.But in case of significant contributors, e.g., kings, authors of great works, it is very critical to identify the particular individuals. So, I guess, Irene's question ishow to resolve the name identify issue, in the case of 'x gave birth to y, y gave birth to x-type statements'? How and when this tradition has started, etc.
