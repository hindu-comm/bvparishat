On this one I agree almost completely with Prof Misra.

I say 'almost' because scholarly translations do assume knowledge of Sanskrit, and quite a lot of it. Their goal isn't to rework Vedic mantras into propositions in English, French, etc. That wouldn't be possible, just as it wouldn't be possible to recast the mantras into any propositional form without large distortions. If we want things that resemble propositions of ordinary language, our task should be to look for reflections of the mantras in Puranas, but even then knowledge of Sanskrit remains indispensable, since Puranas themselves aren't ordinary narratives.

Another reason I said 'almost' is that Vedic rṣis aren't poets in the sense that Larkin or Mallarme are poets. 'Intention' isn't quite the word, then. The sound patterns these beings perceived from the universe - each a unified whole with svaras, never otherwise - have passed though their embodied selves, of course, but the component of psychology or other forms of physicality is virtually non-existent. We are left clues of these beings when we are told their names. The syllable pattern of the receiving being's name is the extent of their 'intention'.  

All that said, I don't think translations are useless, and I don't think that \*all\* Western scholars are myopic enough to limit themselves just to clues from Indo-European linguistics. Sure, there are some who are that way biased, but a good scholar of any kind wouldn't turn away from a possible source of knowledge, wherever this source comes from. As my late father liked to say (while casting no aspersions on snakes), from the same flower the bee extracts honey, and the snake extracts poison.
