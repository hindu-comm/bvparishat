Here are a couple more translations of RV 10.72.4-5:

  

Velankar:

  

10.72.4 The earth (i.e. the Sat) was born from the one with its outstretched legs (i.e. Asat), and from the earth were born the quarters.

(Then there arose) Aditi's Dakṣa and Aditi arose from Dakṣa indeed.

10.72.5 For Aditi, indeed, was born who was your daughter, O Dakṣa:

the gods, the blessed relatives of immortality, were born from her.

  

Jamison-Brereton:

10.72.4 The earth was born from the one whose feet were opened up; from the earth the regions of space were born.

From Aditi, Dakṣa was born, and from Dakṣa, Aditi.

10.72.5 Because Aditi was born—she who is your daughter, o Dakṣa—

following her, the gods were born, the auspicious kin of the immortal one.
