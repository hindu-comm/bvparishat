Dr iyengar and friends,

There are many in the list much more well-versed in the material that I am.

i do however hold a view on "research" with translated material.

All translations are designed for an audience and do carry the translator's bias.

Here I speak from experience. Targeting the text through the translation should

be avoided. One can critique the translation or compare different translations.

i did a translation of a 15th century poet for a chapter in Krishna - A source book

that Oxford printed in 2005. The goal was to highlight the poet and bring out a new story.

One discovers that the translation compromises the text. Hence I maintain

that the translation is done to inform people who may not know the language.

So I do valmiki work with my grandchildren in mind.

This is my opinion, however strong it may sound.

Best regards,  

Bijoy Misra  

  

PS. I won't have extended computer access for some time.
