The straw is too long, dear Liza, dear Liza,

Then cut it, dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry,  
Then cut it, dear Henry, dear Henry, cut it.  
  
With what shall I cut it, dear Liza, dear Liza?

With a knife, dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry,  
With a knife, dear Henry, dear Henry, a knife.  
  
The knife is too dull, dear Liza, dear Liza,

Then sharpen it, dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry,  
Then sharpen it, dear Henry, dear Henry, sharpen it.  
  
With what shall I sharpen it, dear Liza, dear Liza?  
With what shall I sharpen it, dear Liza, with what?  
  
With a stone, dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry,  
With a stone, dear Henry, dear Henry, a stone.  
  
The stone is too dry, dear Liza, dear Liza,  
The stone is too dry, dear Liza, too dry.  
  
Then wet it, dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry,  
Then wet it, dear Henry, dear Henry, wet it.  
  
With what shall I wet it, dear Liza, dear Liza?

In what shall I fetch it, dear Liza, dear Liza?

In a bucket, dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry,  
In a bucket, dear Henry, dear Henry, in a bucket.

**There's a hole in my bucket**, dear Liza, a hole.
