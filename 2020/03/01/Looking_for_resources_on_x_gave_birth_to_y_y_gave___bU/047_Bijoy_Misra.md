Since we are talking cosmology, I did translate Nasadiya sukta for

the US National Public Radio a few years back. My colleagues did

write why did not stick with the earlier translations. If you are

familiar with the previous work, you can notice the difference.  

Again this is meant for an audience unfamiliar with the language,

but might appreciate the poetry and the concept.  

Attaching my translation.
