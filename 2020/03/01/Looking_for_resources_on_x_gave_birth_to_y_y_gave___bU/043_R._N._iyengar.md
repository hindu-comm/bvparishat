I just ignore the unwarranted advice of Dr. Mishra and post another interpretation, this time by SB Dikshit who wrote the first *History of Indian Astronomy.*

Very wisely he leaves the word उत्तानपद untranslated. No one would be able to get into the mind of the ancient Rs.i to know what eactly is meant by उत्तानपद which literallymeans 'lifted-foot'. On the other hand how ancient Hindus understood this in the past is possible to discuss. Western indologists will take recourse only to IE linguistics; this is natural. But we in this country as inheritors of the Vedic culture need not and in fact should not limit ourselves to just the language and grammar. SaayaNaacharya interprets the word उत्तानपद to mean "Tree". In the context of the sUkta, this does not appear to be suited, even if such an interpretative meaning can be argued out. Starting from Yaaskacharya some 3000 years ago, RV traditional interpretation has been along three different lines, all criss crossing too many times in several unexpected places. But, this is our cultural inheritance and hence better to be aware of the multiple interpretations. A cursory glance at the Puranic encyclopedia by Vettam Mani would show the tangled interplay of the three deities or entities or persons namely Uttanapada, Aditi and Daksha in the various Puranas. The legends are not linearly twisted like a thread but woven like a cloth at many angles. Nevertheless, one can sense the astral relation of the above three to Dhruva and how the word Daksha has lead to Aksha, Akshaamsha etc of later Hindu Astronomy. Aditi is the mother of the 27 nakshatras given in marriage to Moon. Hence Aditi is the path of Sun, moon and the planets. This is not my interpretation. It is there in the Puranas. Now one can with the help again of the Vishnu and other puranas understand उत्तानपद as Vishnu the Lifted-foot or Trivikrama expading out of his Vaamana form ( again Puranas) to press earth down. Whether allegorical or otherwise, the overall sense of RV 10.72, has come down to us in the form of full blown stories built over the hidden skeleton of the legend of obliquity of Earth to the path of Sun (each born out of the other).
