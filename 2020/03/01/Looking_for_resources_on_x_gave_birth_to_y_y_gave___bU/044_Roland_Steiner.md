Two brief remarks:  
  
1. It is not correct that "indologists will take recourse only to IE  
linguistics". Of course, in addition to "language and grammar", the  
narrower and wider context, similar concepts, and existing  
interpretations are used, as well as general, cultural and material  
history, etc. In short: everything that can contribute to a better  
understanding of the text.  
  
2. One should not confuse the two words uttānápad (Ṛgveda 10.72.3 and  
4) and uttānapāda (the son of Manu Svāyaṃbhuva and son of Dhruva).  
  
With best regards,  
Roland Steiner
