Dear Iyengarji,

  

I think your interpretation of creation is in the right direction.

  

If one sees time to be external it appears to be cyclic. However if you see the simultaniety of space (direction) and time the concept goes to a one up level of abstraction where creation does not remain a one time affair. It is continuous in both time and space.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve
