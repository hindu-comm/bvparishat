I am touched by the shraddhaa expressed through your words, Dr Irene-ji.

  

It needs quite a shraddhaa to be able to say,

  

"Another reason I said 'almost' is that Vedic rṣis aren't poets in the sense that Larkin or Mallarme are poets. 'Intention' isn't quite the word, then. The sound patterns these beings perceived from the universe - each a unified whole with svaras, never otherwise - have passed though their embodied selves, of course, but the component of psychology or other forms of physicality is virtually non-existent. We are left clues of these beings when we are told their names. The syllable pattern of the receiving being's name is the extent of their 'intention'."

  

Pranaams to you.
