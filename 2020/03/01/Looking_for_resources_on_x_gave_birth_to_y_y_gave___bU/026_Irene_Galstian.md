Thank you very much to everybody who responded with further examples. I apologise for not posting back sooner, but yesterday I had to call it a day much earlier than usual because of fever, and things are even worse today, so I'm waiting for the shops to open to get remedy ingredients.

My original post referred to constructs x->y->x, and, at least for now, I'd be grateful for your help only with this kind, which means leaving aside longer cycles.

Prof Paturi is right, it might be a good idea to stick to vaidika sources (again, at least for now).

As I wrote in the original post, I was hoping to find a survey of opinions on such constructs. For example, when scholars of different Vedangas saw such statements, how did they understand them? Or maybe they didn't think them unusual and didn't comment on them at all? Or maybe they did - in which case I would like to find interpretations that have been offered.

If the original post was vague, I apologise. As I said, yesterday I wasn't feeling well and may not have phrased things right.

  

Thank you again for responding,

Irene
