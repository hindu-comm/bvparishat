Sorry if I sounded patronizing. I would suggest a Vedic cosmology research if someone can take it.

Dr. Irene is objective and she has good command of the language. So I suggested.

I should do it, but I did not start early.

As someone, who is into translations, I would discourage piece-wise translations created through

the convenience of a dictionary. I see no value there, but it is a different topic.

Any way, I am off for a month!
