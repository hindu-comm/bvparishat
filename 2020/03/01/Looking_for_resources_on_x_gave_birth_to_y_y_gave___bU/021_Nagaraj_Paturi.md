Waiting for Dr Irene-ji to respond by explaining the reason /trigger for her curiosity regarding such statements.

  

That may help to know whether her interest is limited to statements of A \> B \> A type only or A \> B \> C> (....) \> (...) \> A also.

  

If it is A \> B \> A , then is A , a jaati or vyakti ?

  

Purusha \> yajana of Purusha in Yajna \> Purusha is A \> B \> A

  

She mentions Purusha \> Virat \> Purusha as an example. We may be able to know the source of this too.
