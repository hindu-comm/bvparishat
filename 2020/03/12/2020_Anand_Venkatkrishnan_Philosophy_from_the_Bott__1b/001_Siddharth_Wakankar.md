Sir,

  

It seems to be a very good field for research, for, it appears that most of the Sanskrit scholars knowing Marathi,have not paid much attention to the Sanskrit commentaries of Saint Ekanath Maharaja.

  

This attempt is praiseworthy, irrespective of the conclusions arrived at by the scholar.
