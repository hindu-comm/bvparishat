Dear Shankara ji,

I understand that the commentary for the first Ullāsa is authored by Madhusūdana Sarasvat himself. The țīkā titled **Kiñcidvyākhyā** for the remaining two Ullāsa-s****is written by Polpakkara Damodaran Namputiri.

Actually I own a personal copy of the book. It is misplaced. Now I want to finalize a paper on the work. I am direly in need of the same

And unable to trace my copy. Hence the request.
