Sundareswaran ji,

  

The name mentioned in the preface is Damodaran Namputiri.  

  

I could not understand the remark in the preface reagarding the author of the tika on the first chapter being different from the tika on the remaining chapters. Could you please explain?  

  

regards  
shankara
