On 08 March 2020, I wrote the following as a note to myself to be eventually included in an email to Prof. Madhav Deshpande:

\>Should we have भिषगालये in the place ofभिषजालये on the pattern of bhiṣag-vara and bhiṣag-bhadra or bhiṣajālaya (as you have it) on the pattern of bhiṣajāvarta?\<

  

I did not send the contemplated email, because I found no time to check the Pāṇinian literature on the matter. I am glad that Prof.Girish K.Jha has brought Pāṇini into the discussion.

  

The sandhi-instance words I have quoted abovebhiṣag-vara, bhiṣag-bhadra and bhiṣajāvarta are found in Skt-English dictionaries. They establish at least that saṁśaya or vacillation about j-sandhi is not new and a wider exploration of actual usage as well asPāṇinian discussions is warranted.

  

If the problem turns out to be peculiar to bhiṣaj, we may have to discuss the etymology (= historical derivation, # nirukta, nirukti, nirvacana or grammarian’s prakriyā such as in the Uṇādi-sūtras) of bhiṣaj.
