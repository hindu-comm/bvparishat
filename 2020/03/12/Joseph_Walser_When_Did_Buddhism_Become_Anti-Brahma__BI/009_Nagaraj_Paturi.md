Not going into the details of the arguments of Walser , their strength or weakness, focussing only on the following statement of Prof. Deshpande:

my question is why can't a marginal view of a particular tradition, here early Buddhism, be one of the variety of views mentionedin another tradition, here Upanishads ?

  

How does being one of the variety of views expressed in a tradition, here Upanishads is against being a marginal view of another tradition, here early Buddhism ?

  

Can't marginal view of a tradition be one of the variety of views mentioned in another tradition ?
