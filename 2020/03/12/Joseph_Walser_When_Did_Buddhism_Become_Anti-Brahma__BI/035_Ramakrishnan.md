Namaste,  
  
Coming back to the opposition between Vedic religion and Buddhism - the Buddha did not deny a sentient being that transmigrates from life-to-live from times immemorial.  
  
For example
<https://suttacentral.net/sn15.4/pli/ms>(Eng:<https://suttacentral.net/sn15.4/en/sujato>) -- and many other sūktas in the same varga, clearly show that a transmigrating being was taken for granted in Early-Buddhism.  
  
Without the recognition of samsaric transmigration, the whole concept of Nirvana in Buddhism (which is what made the Buddha - a Buddha) would fall flat, and together with it the whole edifice of there being a way to end duhkha that the Buddha preached.  
  
Whether this sentient being transmigrating was called the atman, or whether this being was one thing and the atman another (in Early Buddhism) -- is another story worthy of discussion.  
  
At any rate, I don't see any wholesale agreement (or even opposition) between Buddhism & Vedic/Vedantic philosophy.  
  
Because early Buddhism does not use standard terminology, and very frequently redefines even commonly understood terms in its own peculiar ways (helped by the prakritic innovations in the language of its texts and the enormous number of artificial homonyms resulting therefrom), it's definition of atman and anatman have to be put into a proper perspective more so than would be required in any other early-Indic philosophy (as the language can be extremely misleading or capable of misrepresentation).  
  
Regards,  
Ramakrishnan
