Dear Irene,

  

  As far as I know, this may be an interpretation of the account in the Majjhima Nikaya that some Brahman monks propose to recite Buddha's words in the manner of Chandas छन्दसो आरोपेम. The Buddha is said to have rejected this request and told the monks to spread his words in सकाय निरुत्तिया. Both of these expressions have received detailed analyses from numerous scholars and there is no conclusive agreement among them. The latest interpretation of सकाय निरुत्तिया can be found in an article by Bryan Levman, which contains useful bibliography of previous interpretations. I have attached this article. I am not convinced that Pali or some original Buddhist texts were ever recited with Vedic accents as we know them.
