Namaste all,  
  
It is well known that (linguistically speaking) the oldest parts of the Pali Canon are the almost-entirely-verse sūktas in the Sutta Nipāta (perhaps also some verse sūktas in the samyutta-nikāya) etc.  
  

These verse sūktas are in a very archaic form of Pāli (comparable to and/or derived from late-vedic).  
  
The rest of the Pali canon (i.e. the majority of the prose sūktas) are however linguistically and philosophically very distinct from these oldest verse sūktas.  
  
I had a long discussion in this group about (what to me is the undeniable) use of vedic accented pronunciation that a monk used while chanting the aṭṭhakavagga in front of the Buddha himself, and the Buddha praising him for the beautiful accented chanting -- which proves that in the time of the Buddha, the aṭṭhakavagga was chanted in vedic (accented sanskrit) and not in pāli as we have it today.  
  
That would then prove why the oldest versified discourses of the buddha in the sutta nipāta are called 'sūktas' in the first place - they were the Buddha's original sūktas set in vedic (like the veda sūktas of the brahmanical vedic canon).  
  
It is pertinent to note that the oldest verse suttas are not only archaic linguistically but also in the development of Buddhist philosophy (they do not show any of the philosophical terminology like anattā, the catvāryāryasatyāni, the pratītyasamutpāda, āryāṣṭāṅgamārga, the use of hundreds of stock-phrases like 'evaṃ me sutaṃ' etc that are found in multiple prose suttas).  
  
In the archaic verse suttas, the Buddha is depicted as a solitary muni who lives away from people in forest ashrams with just one or two helpers (much like a normal secluded muni who values silence & meditation) -- in the later prose suttas he always is accompanied by a sangha of hundreds or even thousands of monks many of who travel with him all over the country and mostly keeps talking to everyone to expound his philosophy and dispute other people's philosophies -- these are then two very different buddhas and two very different buddhisms joined together at some stage without proper reconciliation.  
  
The prose sūktas are (predominantly if not entirely) later creations showing a form of Buddhism that philosophically well evolved and post-Aśokan (leave alone post-buddha) in origin -- and show a desire among the buddhists to identify themselves as a distinct sacerdotal class in opposition to the brahmin class (which opposition both in the prose pali canon and in ashokan edicts are referenced as the samaṇa-brāhmaṇa pair) - this distinction between samaṇas and brāhmaṇas is not found in the linguistically archaic verse suttas of the pali canon.  
  
Therefore whether the historical buddha (who no doubt "composed" verse sūktas in the spoken vedic dialect of his time) introduced the opposition to vedic brahmanism either philosophically or socially -- or whether that happened in the course of the evolution of later "Ashokan"Buddhism (with the creation and redaction of the later prose canon by buddhists who converted the original verse sūktas from vedic to the mixed languages - part iranic & part indic, that we now call gandhari/pali etc) - is to be known with a level of nuanced understanding that is clearly not the forte of most buddhologists of today.  
  
One thing however is 100% certain - there was no such thing as an **Orally** passed down 'Prose' Pali Canon until the start of the common era. That claim of a BCE oral tradition, which completely lacks evidence, is therefore, pure nonsense, and reveals a complete misunderstanding among buddhologists of how the Vedic canon was passed down orally for centuries. Nor was there any such thing as a widely-spoken Pali language (only monks could read, speak or write Pali - and they alone used it for centuries). The Sinhala monks had to request Buddhaghosha (who lived in India at that time) to write a commentary (for the pali canon) in pali as apparently nobody in Lanka knew the language well enough until then. The buddhist canonical redaction has always been a manuscript/written tradition from the very beginning.  
  
We have not yet meaningfully scratched the surface of a critical study of (historical) early Buddhism.  
  
Regards,  
Ramakrishnan
