Namaste,  
  
@Sastry ji, your points are indeed clear pointers to how even good academic work ends up asking questions, as a part of its method, which are based in a framework which looks at Brahmanism as almost the sole current in the metaphorical teacup of Hinduism. Walser's paper, in my opinion, makes some very good points and frames important aspects of the debate - his emphasis on studying the Buddhist sutras statistically for correlations, "..In other words, maybe we should be counting sutras and eject our inherited academic synthesis of Buddhism—atleast initially, so that we can begin to really listen to our Buddhist sources."(pp 117) ; the sound statistical analyses of the suttas that follow; the results that only 7.4% show the presence of the *anatta* doctrine; the consequent interpretation of this doctrine not forming the hard borderline between the two isms and more importantly showing that by the time of the *Tipiṭaka* there was still no hard borderline between them. All of this though is still followed by interpretation that seems to be based in recent historical understanding of the relationship between Buddhism and Brahmanism and more importantly, a colonial dating of Buddha and Buddhist texts, as seen in his referencing to the work by Oskar von Hinüber, which endorses a Bechert chronology for Buddha.

  

Warmly,

Manogna
