Sorry for the change of focus regarding this topic. The main subject indicates:

When Did Buddhism Become Anti-Brahmanical? The Case of the Missing Soul.

 : My interest is in this aspect.

Looking at Tevijja sutta, ambhatta sutta, agganna sutta, and similar ones, it seems that Buddha was not against Vedas but he was against misinterpretation and the decline of the true values in the texts which were not practiced by the brahmins at that time. I dont remember if this is in Ambattha sutta, that Buddha or Bodhisatva actually says he wants to be a Brahmin. However, not like the so-called Brahmins of that time who can only recite the three Vedas, but with the totalrealization of Brahman. He mentions the term realization of Brahman. In agganna sutta it is clear that Buddha wanted brahminism to be established by nature and actions (guna karma) almost exactly like how the bhagavadgita says guna karma vibhagasah in 4th chapter verse 13 in Gita, rather than merely on the basis of birth. Even my teacher Sri KSV, used to say early Buddhism is not anti-Vedic. Eventually, it became anti-Vedic probably during the establishment of Mahayana Buddhism.

  

In one sutta, I read, the disciples ask him if the state of Nibbana was permanent, Buddha answered with silence rather than saying anything. This is probably just to indicate that the state is beyond words and cannot be rationally assessed.

Hence it seems during the times of Nagarjuna and later Buddhist teachers like DingnAgathings may have changed and those Buddhists established firmly the doctrine of anatta and sunyata using strong logic.
