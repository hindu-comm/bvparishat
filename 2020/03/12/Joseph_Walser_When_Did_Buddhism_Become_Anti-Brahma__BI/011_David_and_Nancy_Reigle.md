I do not have access to Joseph Walser's article, so I do not know what his conclusions are. However, the huge issue of ātman versus anātman, at least in modern times, seems to be largely based on misunderstanding which ātman is being denied in Buddhism. This is the main question that the late Kamaleswar Bhattacharya raised in his 1973 book, *L'Ātman-Brahman dans le Bouddhisme ancien*. He there tried to show that the Buddha did not deny the universal ātman, such as is taught in Advaita Vedānta, but only denied a permanent personal or individual ātman, such as is referred to in many old Sanskrit texts.  

  

A large number of Sanskrit Buddhist texts became available only after 1973 when Kamaleswar Bhattacharya's French book was published. So when Nancy and I edited the English translation of his book for publication in 2015 as *The Ātman-Brahman in Ancient Buddhism*, I added a new introduction. It succinctly stated Kamaleswar Bhattacharya's main point, and added references from the writings of all the main Buddhist teachers up through about the eighth century of the Common Era. These show, conclusively it seems to me, that the Buddhists thought that the Buddha was refuting a permanent personal ātman. They made no mention of a universal ātman.

  

As far as we can judge from the available writings, the idea of a universal ātman did not become dominant in India until some time around or after the eighth century C.E. It became so dominant since then, that nowadays when we hear the word ātman, we automatically think of the universal ātman. So when we hear that the Buddha denied the ātman, we automatically assume that he denied the universal ātman. But the Sanskrit Buddhist texts written by all the main Buddhist teachers do not support this. Interestingly, Śrī Śaṅkarācārya concludes his introduction to the *Brahma-sūtra-bhāṣya* by saying that he has undertaken this to refute the idea of the ātman as kartṛtva and bhoktṛtva, i.e., the personal ātman, and to teach the ekatva or unity of the ātman.

  

Attached is my new introduction to *The Ātman-Brahman in Ancient Buddhism*.
