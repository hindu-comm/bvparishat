Dr. Venkatakrishna Sastry ji,  
  
Dance (naccaṃ), singing(gīta) and playing musical instruments (vādita) was quite common even back then and is mentioned many times in the Pali canon.  

  

Chanting one of the oldest Buddhist sūktas (composed in archaic/non-standard pali) 'with svaras', is different from singing with musical notes. The two things are described differently in the Pali canon.

  

There is no evidence from the Pali canon that the sūktas were set to music or sung (in fact some sūktas say that the Buddha avoided listening to singing, dance, musical performances and otherforms of recreation).  
  
Besides, there existed no such thing as a spoken (or even written) prakrit in the Buddha's period, as all prakritic innovations arose predominantly after his time from two sources:

1.  Mid to Late 1st milleniumBCE Iranic influences on Old-Indic 2.  The introduction of writing and influence of Imperial-Aramaic &
    Aramaic-derived scripts (primarily Kharosthi) which in their initial
    stages were unsuitable for writing Old-Indic and therefore brought
    in phonetic (later also grammatical) innovations into the language,
    resulting from orthographic misrepresentation.

When the Buddha died, they had to commit his teachings to writing in Aramaic or early Kharosthi (for fear of the teachings getting lost), and the only people who used writing were Iranic people (and greeks) of the north-western India - hence the Iranic influences in the language of the Buddhist texts and the orthographic misrepresentations of Sanskrit words led to the emergence of 'Prakritic innovations'.  
  
Early-Prakrit (Gandhari/Pali etc) did not evolve naturally from Vedic and does not (as a whole) exhibit any of the normal linguistic features of a natural spoken language. The early grammarians are categorical in their refusal to recognize them (Gandhari, Pali, Ashokan Epigraphic Prakrit etc) as valid Indic (naturally-evolved-from-Vedic) spoken languages, whether by sishtas or non-sishtas. Sishta-vak was merely grammatically-correct speech, not a 'diglossic dialect' in the conception of the early grammarians.  
  

Those prakritic innovations were predominantly post-Panini (or he so thoroughly ignored them as being irrelevant to his description of the Indic vernacular i.e. the Old-Indic dialects that he standardized into his 'Sanskrit' grammar) that the early prakritisms were simply dismissed as mleccha (foreign) usages even by people like Patañjali, centuries after Panini.

  

Therefore we are faced with an accurate diglossic situation (the spoken language that was observed by Panini was Laukika Sanskrit, while the archaic elite-language was Vedic) - and this was the same situation that prevailed in the Buddha's time as well (they most likely lived within a century of each other).

  

Therefore what can be called a sasvara recitation of a buddhist verse sūkta can only be some kind of a vedic-style recitation of that sūkta, the idea is that the sūkta could be recited with or without svaras - this was only possible in sanskrit/vedic in the Buddha's time (pre-Mauryan era).

  

I am yet to see any compelling alternative of what else svara could mean in this context that could help me change my mind.

Regards,  
Ram
