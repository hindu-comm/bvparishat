Dear Shri Madhav ji,

  

I do not have a problem about agreeing to disagree, or recognizing that I am incorrect in my interpretations - but all I am asking you is - what exactly do you want me to disagree with?  
  
I have said it was a vedic-style sasvara recitation that is reported in the text (although the received text as we have it now is not in vedic or accented). You say you disagree as you dontthink itcould have been any kind of vedic-style sasvara recitation. But why can't it be if the text was recited in vedic originally? It is well accepted that Pali did not exist in the Buddha's time, so it must be an earlier dialect that had svaras.  
  
What is the definition of svara which according to you makes better sense in this context? Why would it be odd for it to be some late-vedic-style sasvara recitation of a set of verses by a brahmin bhikṣu in the late-vedic era in the historical buddha's presence when that set of verses is well known to be linguistically among the most archaic texts in the canon?  
  
What other kinds of recitations with non-vedic svaras do you know of, that existed in that period?  
  
Sakāya (svakīya) niruttiyā (niruktyā) = "with my/his own interpretation". There are *no dialectal, or regional, or any sort of ethnolinguistic distinction* being mentioned here at all, there is no opposition between sanskrit and prakrit or between vedic dialects and non-vedic dialects that almost all scholars so uncritically read into this text. All that is being said here is that the buddhavacana was not to be redacted into canonically ossified early-vedic mantras as it would prevent wider dissemination.

I see this text anyways as a later theravada interpolation into their own (sectarian) vinaya to ensure the pali canon remained intact - which is why the vinaya remained sectarian, and this text is in the vinaya. The very idea of sectarian readings of the canon (and widespread confusion as to what exactly the buddhist texts being variously misinterpreted originally meant) was unlikely to have existed in his own lifetime (and reported to him so he could ostensibly pass an absurd judgement to allow those misinterpreting his texts to continue with their misinterpretations) - it seems like an anachronistic interpolation inserted into the theravada vinaya.  

  
Regards,

Ramakrishnan
