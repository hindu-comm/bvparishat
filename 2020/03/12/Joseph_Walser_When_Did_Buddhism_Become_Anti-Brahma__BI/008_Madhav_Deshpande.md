My main issue with Walser's paper is his assumption that the Theravada Pali canonrepresents the oldest Buddhist canon, and then he is trying to find the oldest kernel of that presumed oldest canon. Considering the fact that the Sanskrit Dīrghāgama etc. found partially in Sanskrit and fully in Chinese and Tibetan translations don't entirely agree with the Pali Nikāyas, one has to conclude that the Pali canonical tradition is only one of the surviving canonical traditions, and not necessarily the oldest one. If statistical argument on *anattā* indicates that is found only in some Suttas, and therefore does not represent the earlier Buddhist view, such an argument can be extended to the Upanishads, the Bhagavadgita and many other texts, to argue that certain expressions are not statistically significant, and therefore they are not to be counted among the main doctrine of a certain tradition. If *anattā* is found only in some Suttas, that does not translate into support for the existence of *attā* in other Suttas. Quite apart from what Walser's study indicates about the Buddhist relations to Brahmins, it does not prove that the bulk of the Pali canon supports the existence of *attā.* In Upanishadic passages like *yeyaṃ prete vicikitsā manuṣye, astītītyeke nāyamastīti caike*, there is evidence for the existence of those who believed that there is no *ātman* after death, and others believing that it continues. In the face of such a variety of views mentioned in the Upanishads, can one assert that the early Buddhism decisively sides with the existence of *attā/ātmā*, and that the *anattā* view was only a marginal view?
