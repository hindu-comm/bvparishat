Dear Prof. Deshpande,

Yes, I agree with you that the second part of Kamaleswar Bhattacharya’s thesis, that the Buddha indirectly affirms the universal ātman, cannot be demonstrated, especially in the Pāli texts that he primarily drew from. I had to be careful in writing this new introduction, and try to avoid putting my own opinions into it. So I concluded this section by saying:

“In the end, the question of whether the Buddha indirectly affirmed the Upaniṣadic *ātman* is a matter for each person to decide by examining the evidence and choosing which teachings make the most sense to them.”



In fact, I did not think that even the first part of Kamaleswar Bhattacharya’s thesis, that the Buddha did not deny the universal ātman, could be proved from the Pāli sources that he primarily drew from. Neither did the reviewers of his book. That is why I added the new introduction, giving Sanskrit sources that I think do prove the first part of his thesis.



The great value of his book, to me, is that he opened up these two possibilities to consider, for those who had always taken for granted the assumption that the Buddha denied the universal ātman. Thus I there wrote: “Kamaleswar Bhattacharya’s book gives us a choice that most people in our time did not think existed in Buddhism.” To me, the question must remain open, simply because we have insufficient source material.



It is true that early Buddhism as found in the Pāli canon does not positively affirm the universal ātman, unless we take the famous passage from the *Udāna* of the Khuddaka Nikāya as definitive:



“O monks, there is an unborn, unoriginated, uncreated, uncompounded; and if there were not this unborn, unoriginated, uncreated, uncompounded, no escape would be possible from what is born, is originated, is created, is compounded.”



It is exactly such passages that keep the question open. As you indicated in another email, there is no reason to regard the Pāli sources as any older than some of the Sanskrit Buddhist sources. There are other such passages in the Sanskrit Buddhist sources, and not only in the tathāgata-garbha sūtras, although still representing only a minority view in Buddhism. The majority view in Mahāyāna Buddhism as understood in Tibet, is that such passages are not definitive, but only represent the Buddha’s skillful means in teaching and therefore must be interpreted. But this can no more be proved than can Kamaleswar Bhattacharya’s thesis that the Buddha indirectly affirmed the universal ātman.

  

Best regards,
