Dear Prof. Deshpande,

  

My question was limited to the logical aspect of A implies B.

  

Leaving that aside,

  

First let me thank Sri Megh-ji for posting such interesting articles that bring in new perspectives for discussion. His posts on different strands of Advaita too are valuable.

  

-------------------------------------------

  

Coming to the present thread,

  

The first part of Joseph Walser's title, " When Did Buddhism Become Anti-Brahmanical?" and not the tag of it " the Case of the Missing Soul " that first attracted me.

  

Buddhism being projected as anti-Brahmin /anti-Brahmanical has been a significant aspect of Buddhism studies both in India and among the shenanigans in Indology.

  

For that matter, these shenanigans project the vice-versa too: 'Brahmins / 'Brahmanism' to be anti-Buddhist '.

  

These deeper doctrinal issues such as aatman Vs anattaa do not figure in such politically motivated discussions.

  

Common and shared aspects of all the 'Dhaarmic Religions' (to use a term from disciplines like Comparative Religion ), and the continuities among them as parts of the Indic cultural complex are deliberately pushed to oblivion and discontinuities among them are either highlighted or concocted and are these traditions are shown only to be mutual enemies, mutually hostile and Brahminism is projected as the annihilator of the other two.

  

In that context, when titles such as "When Did Buddhism Become Anti-Brahmanical?" are found, it feels comforting to those vexed with the politically motivated projections of mutual hostilities based sometimes on twisting the actual discontinuities , sometimes creating non-existing discontinuities.

  

Joseph Walser's title gives such a comforting feeling and raises hopes about a more nuanced look at the continuities and discontinuities between Vedic and Buddhist traditions with regard to one of the important doctrinal question of aatman and anattaa.
