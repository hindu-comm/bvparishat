Namaste



The question pursued : \< When ***Did ***Buddhism ***Become*** Anti-Brahmanical? > may be better reworded as \< When Did Buddhism ***came to be presented*** as Anti-Brahmanical ?Why ?By Whom? > to do some real justice !

The pursuit of the suggested theme could open a ‘ storm in the tea cup’ labeled ‘ Hinduism’. 



There is a critical need to revisit the two understandings of ‘Buddhism ! as ‘ anti-brahminism’ ! which in reality it is not !! Buddhas social teachings are concurrent with the practice of ten values of Sanatana Dharma and ten values under yama-niyama of Yogaangas. The difference in metaphysical and philosophical views does not make Buddhism ‘anti-brahmana’ by varnashrama framework .



 Buddhism as ‘Anti-brahminical’ ( Brahma/ Brahmana-dvesha), is a socio-political narrative with clear motives backing the propagation of the idea. A post colonial construction.



 Buddhism in the traditional technical schools , is ‘ Bauddha –Darshana’ as ‘ a-Vaidika’- Yoga-Shaastra Darshana backed – Post Dharma-Megha Samadhi phase of practice : ref: PYS – 4-29 onwards.



 Buddhism approach is ‘a-vaidika’ in pursuit, seeking final solution to the question of ‘ Dukha’ exactly as Samkhya pushed ( dukha-traya-abhighataat jijnyaasaa, tadabhighatake hetau….). Samkhya is Vaidika and also brahminical !



 ‘A-Vaidika’ means not accepting \< the authority of ‘Shruti / Veda/ A-Paurusheya Bhashaa darshana/ Mantra-Sukta’ held high by the ‘Brahmana-Yogi’s’ \>.

 A-Vaidika does not mean unscientific; it does not mean falling out of yoga. The seed thoughts of Buddhism can be seen in Srimad Bhagavad- Gita !

 Many scholarly writers on Buddhism seem to have been ‘ Brahmins and Kshatriayas who carried an intellectual and philosophical leaning to the teachings of Buddha and developed a ‘darshana – philosophy’ for this.



 Vaidika darshana is Veda-Vyasa (Yoga- Anushthana) Sampradaaya, which matures to the six vaidika darshanas
where the highest position is held by ‘Vedanta Darshana’ .



  This position eventually matures in absorbing ‘Buddha’ in to ‘ Vishnu avataras’ with the sanctioned authority of Acahrya Madwa.



  Acharya Shankara rejects ‘Buddhist position as avaidika’ ; but is not against ‘ Buddha as a Yogi . Yoga – Tantra - practices which Buddhism have been absorbed in to Vedic stream in a appropriate way.



 The line of thinking presenting ‘Buddhism’ as ‘ anti-Brahminism’ is a historical mistake that has taken place in several writings, including the classical academic writings ! 



 The fundamental anchor of this presentation seems to be (i) Prejudiced unquestioned- unexamined axioms about (Vedic = Brahminical only) and \< vedic = Rituals which use animal sacrifice and are violent!) ! and (ii) using lens of ‘ Socio-political narrative’ by standards of Religion-Theology (= Mata- samaja sampradaaya). Added to this dimension, the superimposition of ‘ IE –Linguistics theory’, historicity anchored to non-bharateeya anchors of history and theology
on Ancient Indian Dharmic traditions leads to ‘ Language –Disconnects between ‘ Brahmi Samskrutham’ (= Vaidika Samskrutham) and ‘ rest of Indian languages more specifically (Ne)- Pali, (Ardha-)Maagadhi,
other Praakruth – Apabhramsha- Dramida- Mleccha languages in which teachings of Buddhism reached a larger society , all over South Asia.
On the top of all this, is the ‘ lack of understanding the yoga-meaning of technical terms of Samskrutham in source works’ by relying upon inappropriate lexicons providing translations.
