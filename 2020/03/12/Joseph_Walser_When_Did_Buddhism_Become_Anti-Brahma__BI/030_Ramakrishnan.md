Yes, I agree with your statement that Pali or Prakritic texts have never been recited or recorded sasvara as far as we know.

  

I was saying something else entirely (the fact that the recitation was reported to be sasvara meant that it was originally in Old-Indic, is what I was saying).  
  
So there appears to be nothing to disagree on. I don't think redefining the meaning of sara (as something other than some kind of late-vedic svaras) helps shed any more light on the meaning of the text inquestion.  
  
Regards,  
Ramakrishnan
