Sir/Madam

  

I am reminded of one very important observation of an archeologist,the late D. B. Chitale who worked in the Dangs District of Gujarat, bordering Maharashtra.

  

He studied the local dialect and freely mixed with the local folks with a view to understanding their folk lore, folk tales, folk culture etc. He was wonder.struck to know and understand that the intonation and accents in the folk dialect almost resembled the Vedic accents.

Unfortunately,his untimely death deprived us of this kind of novel similarity between the folk dialect of the Dangs and Vedic recitation.

He last met me in the late 1980s.
