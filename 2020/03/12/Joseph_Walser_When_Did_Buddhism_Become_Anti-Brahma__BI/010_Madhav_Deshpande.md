Dear Nagaraj Ji,

  

  That is not what I am saying. Even if one accepts Walser's claim that the *anattā* view is found only in a minority of the Pali Suttas, he has not proved that the rest of the Pali canon positively sides with the view of the Upanishads. That, in my view, is a drawback of this study.
