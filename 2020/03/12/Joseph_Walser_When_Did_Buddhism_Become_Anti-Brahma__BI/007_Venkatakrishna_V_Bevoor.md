Namaste



On \< "..In other words, maybe we should be counting sutras and eject our inherited academic synthesis of Buddhism—at least initially, so that we can begin to really listen to our Buddhist sources."(pp 117) >



The mother seeds of difficulty in addressing this issues, being like :




a) **Would one be welcome to upset a ‘ accepted Historic buddhism’ to restore a ‘ Text-sutra based Buddhism anchored to original teachings’?** Are there right team of Buddhist –Samskruth Scholars who would be willing dispassionately to see their native tradition connections emerging out of ‘ Gita based Yogas’ ? which predates at least several centuries before the classical date of Buddha ? Scholars who would get back to the Samskruth sources connected to Prakruth / Pali/ Magadhi sources as provided in the respective grammars and language frame work of nativity ?



What seems to vitiates this exercises is the army of Buddhist academicians who would put forth the ‘ translations- practices-publications’ as a barricade to carry on the impartial and balanced research.

One such illustration on this forum was a discussion on the term ‘ vipassanaa’ ; other term was about ‘ nibbana’ ( which connects so deeply to gita ! See the detailing at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana>



b) **Would there be a right motivated team to revisit ‘ the widely taught Historic Hinduism ’ to restore a ‘ Text-sutra based Dharmic Synthetic Tradition to restore ‘Bharateeya Teachings’?** The other factor which seems to vitiate this line of exploration is the ‘ projected, tradition deviant understanding of ‘Veda’; or stated otherwise, the unwillingness to research the co-terminus existence of
two streams of Yoga traditions as ‘Vedic (Valmiki-Vyasa) –
Non-Vedic ( Jain- Vrushabhadeva aadi- teerthankara ; Buddhism – First Buddha according to Sutras ). According to Buddhism, there were countless Buddhas before Gautama Buddha and there will be many Buddhas after him. In Pali texts, the first Buddha in Buddhavamsa sutta was Taṇhaṅkara Buddha. The Mahapadana sutta says the first Buddha was Vipassi Buddha. Counting from the present kalpa (the beginning of our present universe) Gautama Buddha is considered the fourth Buddha. In this telling, the first is Kakusandho Buddha, second Konakamano Buddha, and the third Kassapo Buddha. The last Buddha of this kalpa will be Maitreya Buddha. Then the universe will renew itself and from then begins a new kalpa. <https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism>

c) **Would academic teams like to rethink and revisit the new challenge of ‘ Re-writing History of ancient civilizations’ ? based on continuum of ‘ Texts and traditions’ from Ramayana and Mahabharata’?** Making this exploration deeply disturbs the ‘ world-Religion- scripture -Historicity locked in to the 4000 BCE framework ! Therefore, every document, narrative, evidence, view point
of every other land and people, civilization and culture gets debunked, deconstructed and painted differently ! The understanding of at least three major religions of Bharath and several major ‘classical languages’ of Indian traditions/ religions get damaged in this ‘academic’ exercise. Even the so much committed ‘ Indian / Hindu / sympathetic ‘ researchers end up in seeking ‘ hard and soft evidence to cross the historic time line of 6000 BCE at best ! 

c)

d) This research does not seem to be any top line agenda for the native scholars (seeking moksha as end goal, if not the academic positions). The outcome of this issue does not seem to trigger any politically sensitive trouble for political parties to embrace a
repair strategy for cultural damage that has occurred. The science teams cannot get on to this as ‘ hard evidence tracing as Indiana Jones expedition’ unless backed by right plans and project funding! So, who should bell the cat in this area ?



Think of ways to overcome these issues.
