Namaste

  

More clarification required to understand what is 'sara' and why constrict it to ' vedic swaras' ? Why not consider the more reasonable social interpretation of the term as ' svara in musical recitation ( Geeta-kaavya model; Geeta-govinda model ; cf: Ramayana : chandobaddha, tantree-laya-samanvitah, paada-baddhah, akshara samah - model ; Ramayana is known to have been 'a singing tradition - (kushee-lava) ', yet without vedic accent model or Saama- chant mode ?! :

  

Prof. Deshpande: \<All I am saying is that I have seen no evidence that any known Prakrit or Pali was recited with Vedic svaras like Udatta , Anudatta and Svarita.>

  

Ramakrishnan: \<I don't think redefining the meaning of sara (as something other than some kind of late-vedic svaras) helps shed any more light on the meaning of the text inquestion.>.

  

If one were to give a contemporary example, the way ' unaccented prayer texts ( sanskrit or regional compositions) have been set to music-chants shows that the social outreach gets better appeal- attraction when ' ear-pleasing, tongue-smooth rolling sound variations' rhythm' are introduced in to the text recitation. Every religion has adapted this technique ! Example of Current period : Jaya Jagadeesha hare - a tune which has become signature turn for hindu mandir prayers. The 'aarti- prayers' in bhajans are another example. No one has confused this or connected these popular models to vedic frame work.

  

Thanks in advance for clarification.
