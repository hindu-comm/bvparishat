"The more superficially one studies Buddhism,  

the more it seems to differ from the Brahmanism in which it originated;  

the more profound our study,  

the more difficult it becomes to distinguish Buddhism from Brahmanism,  

or to say in what respects, if any, Buddhism is really unorthodox"  

\- Dr. Ananda K. Coomaraswamy.
