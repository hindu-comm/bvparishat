Thank you, Professor Deshpande. I too was aware of that story in the Pali Canon, which is why the posts in this thread piqued my interest.

  

Thank you for the fascinating information, Professor Wakankar. It's most regrettable that D. B. Chitale didn't have an opportunity to make his entire investigation known. Are there any works of his you'd recommend to at least get a taste of his findings?

  

Best wishes,

Irene
