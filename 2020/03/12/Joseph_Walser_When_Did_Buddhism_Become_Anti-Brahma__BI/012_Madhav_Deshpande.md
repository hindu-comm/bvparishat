Dear David,

  

  Thanks for attaching your introduction to your translation of Kamaleswar Bhattacharya'sbook on Anātman. If I may quote a crucial paragraph from your introduction, here it is:

  

"The second part of Kamaleswar Bhattacharya’s thesis,  
“on the contrary, he indirectly affirms it, in denying that which  
is falsely believed to be the ātman,” is another question. If the  
Buddha’s denial of a permanent personal self was intended  
to indirectly affirm an impersonal universal ātman, we would  
expect to find at least some affirmations of a universal åtman  
in the Buddhist scriptures. We do find these, in a small num-  
ber of Buddhist scriptures, especially in the tathāgata-garbha  
sūtras."

  

This is precisely the dilemma about both Bhattacharya's writing and Walser's article. Buddha explicitly denies ātman in the sense of jīvātman, but does he affirm the contrary, i.e. the impersonal universal ātman? As you report "We do find these, in a small number of Buddhist scriptures, especially in the tathāgata-garbhasūtras." I agree with you, and yet you will agree with me that these Tathāgatagarbhasūtras are a relatively late development in Mahāyāna, and can by no stretch of imagination be said to represent early Buddhism. So, to describe the early Buddhism, it denies ātman in the sense of jīvātman, but does not positively affirm the contrary, the impersonal universal ātman. This is my understanding. I had a few conversations with the late Professor Bhattacharya, and we agreed to disagree on some points.
