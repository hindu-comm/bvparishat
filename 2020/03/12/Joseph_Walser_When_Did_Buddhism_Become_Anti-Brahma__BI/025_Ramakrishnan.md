Madhav ji,

  

My argument about the sasvara recitation was not that the reported recitation was in Pali or in any post-vedic language.  
  
Therefore if you are not convinced that Pali or other Buddhist-Middle-Indic texts were recited with vedic accents - please note that that is not the pūrvapakṣa at all (at least not what I meant to convey). My claim is that the recitation with svaras shows the recited text was not in any kind of middle-Indic but was recited in Vedic/Sanskrit (which must have been its original form) - as the possibility of reciting with or without svaras only exists in old-Indic. In this case it was recited with svaras, but it is likely that the original composition may have not had accents - but it should have most likely been in some form of Old-Indic.  
  
The sakāya niruttiyā reference does not come from the sutta pitaka at all - it comes from the cullavagga of the vinaya pitaka (which by its very nature is a later text not from the time of the atthakavagga which was the text being recited in the buddha's presence and is well accepted as constituting the oldest part of the pali canon) and has several things that are quite odd - the names of the brahmin brothers reported in the text make no sense to me, besides what is claimed by you is not what the text means to say. I mentioned the following last year to show why the scholarly interpretations of the Sakāyaniruttiyātext are all wrong -  
  

***Sakāyaniruttiyā:***  
  
I am aware of the 'Sakkāyaniruttiyā' controversy, the controversy exists because the text is misinterpreted by some scholars. The issue in there is not a distinction or preference between sanskrit and prakrit. Let me explain:  
  
Twobhikṣusapproach the Buddha and tell him "etarahi, bhante, bhikkhū nānānāmā nānāgottā nānājaccā nānākulā pabbajitā. Tesakāyaniruttiyābuddhavacanaṃ dūsentiHanda mayaṃ, bhante, buddhavacanaṃ chandaso āropemā".  
  
In this quote above, clearly the problem mentioned by thebhikṣusis not the existence of multiple languages or dialects. The problem posed is that the societal diversity ofbhikṣus(with various names, gotras,jātis and kulas) is indicative of people with differing levels of education/understanding, and when they become parivrājakas, their different levels of understanding leads them to (mis)interpret thebuddhavacana in their own peculiar ways. This is what is mentioned in the text, the text is not speaking of multiple languages at all.  
  
The buddhavacana is evidently already available in a specific dialect/language, and the problem posed by these nānāvidhabhikṣus is that due to the differences in their social backgrounds, they understand the already existing buddhavacana (in an already existing dialect) in their own peculiar ways. Now the solution these two enterprisingbhikṣuspropose is if they redact the buddhavacanam in chandasaḥ(metric poetry), that would promote greater standardization in understanding (much like the texts used by the various vedicśākhas) as that would subject it to similar rigorous pedagogical standards and methods in their dissemination.The Buddha here, concerned that this solution would prevent wider dissemination of his teachings, objects to the idea and allows thenānāvidhabhikṣus to understand it in whichever way they could (their social and educational backgrounds notwithstanding).

  
This does not conflict with my earlier example where the Buddha praises the bhikṣu who utters a text with svaras for reciting it well.

  

You did not offer any alternative explanation last year to say why/how I could have misunderstood this text.

  

Regards,

Ramakrishnan
