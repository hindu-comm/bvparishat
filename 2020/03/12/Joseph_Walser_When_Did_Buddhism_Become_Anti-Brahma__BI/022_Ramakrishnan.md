Irene ji,

  

Some of us last year discussed a fair deal about the **sasvara recitation of the aṭṭhakavagga**(in the Buddha's presence) reported in thePali canon -- please look up the thread ''Pali language svara usage". I argued there that the aṭṭhakavagga (well recognized as linguistically the earliest part of the Pali canon) was back then recited in a Vedic dialect to the Buddha, and the Buddha praised it as a good recitation. Perhaps you can read it up and offer your views on it.  
  
Thanks,  
Ramakrishnan
