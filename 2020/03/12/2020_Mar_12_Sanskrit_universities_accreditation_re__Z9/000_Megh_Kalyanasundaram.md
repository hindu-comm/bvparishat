"According to professor Shrinivasa Varakhedi, vice-chancellor of the Kavikulaguru Kalidas Sanskrit University in Ramtek, Maharashtra, and member of the committee that worked on the NAAC manual, it was important that Sanskrit universities have different guidelines for accreditation, because the way students are taught in these institutions is different from others.

“With the new accreditation process, Sanskrit universities will also be open for interdisciplinary courses and research. There are some courses in these universities that did not have recognition at the international level; NAAC accreditation will facilitate that,” Varakhedi told ThePrint."
