shri Aravinda ji,

  

I dont think one rose will herald spring. The whole forest has to be afire with colours then you can say spring is well and truly here.

These children do not represent the next gen of Bharat anymore than any of the vidvans of BVP representthe average"Hindu".

  

India's "soft power" is diluted by its uncertainty between whether to ape the west or find and stick to its roots. Even the present political dispensation despite overwhelming mandate has not done enough to display decisiveness. They are still hoping to curry approval from left "think-tanks" and be universally beloved. Weakness and neediness are immediately identified through smell alone by bullies.

  

The March convention of "Peacefools" is ample demonstration of the lack of decisiveness in execution. Thanks to that piece of colossalstupidity, India's corona numbers doubled over the last 3 days. God alone knows how many else these idiotshave infected.

  

The picture at the moment shows the idiots winning in handsome numbers.

  

Sit at home and pray...pray hard!
