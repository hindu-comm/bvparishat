Shri Paturi Garu,  

  

It is indeed sad that mediocrity seeks to crush individuality and brahma-varchas hoping to assimilate it into the drainage of group-think.

  

The family seems down to earth and healthy in all respects.

  

I have frequently found that respect for shastra and sadhus, shishtaachara are more prevalent in non-Brahmin lineages (although the father is an iyer) than in pure Brahmin households who take it for granted and think they can deviate without consequence. I guess this is a result of kali-purusha confusing everything.

  

The boy inadvertently hit it on the head wrt where the effects will be most felt. It is impossible without fine grained analysis to say whether war or pandemic will happen. KN Rao ji and his students retrospectively derived the pademicfrom a kota chakra, but that is after the fact.

  

Wrt the oil price rise the boy predicted, since he thought a conventional war was going to happen he went for the obvious conclusion. Although I do suspect the parents taught them how to think and extrapolate. Its not possible for a young mind to unassisted come to such conclusionswrt macro-economic snowball effects.

  

The parents need to be given full credit for giving their children the confidence to think aloud instead of crushing their individuality with the weight of their "expectations".



I just hope the family stays grounded and the kids should be prime role models for the next generation. They certainly have my vote over and above the tik-tok generation!

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
