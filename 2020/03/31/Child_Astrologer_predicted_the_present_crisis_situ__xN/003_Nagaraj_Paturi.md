My friend Dr Sunthar Visuvalingam on his list added more details:

  

Rani,

After receiving the above link subsequently from other sources, I finally  
got down just now to watching several videos from Abhigya’s Conscience  
channel on YouTube. Just some initial impressions:  
  
\* Most of what he predicted on 22 August 2019 has come true: breakdown  
in transport, stock market crash, global scope of calamity, etc. Having  
foreseen an energy-related crisis, he assumed a steep hike in gas-prices,  
whereas their plummeting is perhaps having an even worse economic impact  
(Saudi-Russian production rivalry is about to destroy U.S. shale industry…).  
Responding to objections that he had spoken more about global war than a  
pandemic (which he nevertheless did explicitly foretell), he not only  
clarifies that we are indeed fighting a (defensive) war against the virus  
that is attacking (blitzkrieg) all of humanity, but openly suggests that it  
might be a plaything of certain governments (without joining the chorus of  
Western media in pointing the finger at China….):

\* At such a young age, he already has a holistic approach to knowledge  
and to our world because he began with astrology: regardless of whether we  
hold the latter to be science or superstition, the multivalent planets,  
asterisms, zodiacal signs, aspects, etc., bring together correspondences  
from wholly disparate domains and disciplines. While researching the  
(cross-cultural) psychology of (bisociative) laughter, its universal link to  
clown/trickster and figure of (identical) twins, I found curious  
corroboration in the attribution of humor to (hermaphrodite Mercury and)  
sign Gemini. Abhigya and younger sister Adheya have a deep beautiful  
relationship founded on spiritual integrity and an irresistible thirst for  
(direct self-) knowledge, for which he’s paid a heavy price:

mediocrity seeks to crush innocent talent)  
  
\* Their parents must be also remarkable: seeing how the siblings are  
reverting to tradition (Vedas, appearance, etc., even dreams in Sanskrit!),  
one might assume birth in an orthodox brahmin lineage. However, their Tamil  
father is married to a Sindhi mother, who speaks melodious Tamil, the  
national language Hindi, the local Kannada, and the global English. Did they  
resettle in India? They deserve fulsome praise for wholeheartedly supporting  
the innate quest of their children when most other parents would be instead  
telling their kids what they should be striving after. They study both  
modern sciences and traditional wisdom with the same enjoyment with which  
they play, equally hard. As for their Conscience channel, they’ll mature  
naturally through audience moderation.

channel)  
  
Let’s pray that it’s children like these, from around the world, who will  
repopulate a world that seems to have grown weary of its human burden…
