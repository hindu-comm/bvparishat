Hare Krishna.  
  
Respected Vidvaj-janas,  
Pranams.  
  
I want to purchase Full set of Hindi Translation of Mahabharata by  
Satawalekar ji, Swadhyay Mandal.  
  
Can anyone help me locate the store where I can purchase it? Their  
direct email is blocked. One of Exoticindia is out of stock. Online  
scan on archives is too low quality for getting it printed.  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
