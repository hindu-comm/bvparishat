Dear Colleagues,

  

Apologies for cross-posting. I am pleased to draw your attention to the publication of a new volume in Gonda Indological Studies (GIS 21):

  

Elizabeth A. Cecil,*Mapping the Pāśupata Landscape: Narrative, Place, and the Śaiva Imaginary in Early Medieval North India*

  

In*Mapping the Pāśupata Landscape: Narrative, Place, and the Śaiva Imaginary in Early Medieval North India*, Elizabeth A. Cecil explores the sacred geography of the earliest community of Śiva devotees called the Pāśupatas. This book brings the narrative cartography of the*Skandapurāṇa*into conversation with physical landscapes, inscriptions, monuments, and icons in order to examine the ways in which Pāśupatas were emplaced in regional landscapes and to emphasize the use of material culture as media through which notions of belonging and identity were expressed. By exploring the ties between the formation of early Pāśupata communities and the locales in which they were embedded, this study reflects critically upon the ways in which community building was coincident with place-making in Early Medieval India.

  

Thanks to the generous support of the J. Gonda Foundation, the E-book is also available via Open Access on Brill's website. You can access the book via this link:

With best regards,
