This is what I wrote about this book on the advaita list a long time back:

  

"This has a very learned introduction by the great paNDita yudhiShThira mImAmsaka. I am not sure who has provided the footnotes, seems to be yudhiShThira mImamAsaka, and this is a unique feature of this book compared to previous grantha versions available in Tamil Nadu. Sandhi and other issues when going from the saMhitA to the pada pATha requires knowledge of veda-lakShaNa and can be quite tricky. The footnotes provide detailed references to the prAtishAkhya and shikShA texts when these happen, as well as explanations of these. It's a really outstanding work of scholarship. The book has been published by the Ramlal Kapoor Trust in Haryana and is priced at a meager Rs 300, which is a ridiculously low price for such a fantastic book. The fonts are beautiful, as is the binding and it is a pleasure to just hold and look through the book. "

  

The footnotes are actually provided by the authors - which I did not realize at that time. Also I was talking about a new reprint of the old book, so the introduction is available only in the print edition. While this is very good be warned that there are some typos not caught in the errata - not bad at all overall - but not proofread to the perfection of the authors' grantha lipi publications.
