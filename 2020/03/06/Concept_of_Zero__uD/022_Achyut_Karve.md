Dear Vidwans,

  

All great thinkers have commenced their treatises by stating the objective of their inquiry.

  

For example Panini starts with the Maheshwar Sutras, Katyayana with Siddhe Shabdaartha Sambandhe, Patanjali with Shabda, Bhartruhari with shabda brahma, Marx with commodities, etc.

  

With what does Mathematics concern itself? To my mind it concerns itself with quantities and zero is surely not one of them. Therefore zero if not anything else is just a representative symbol which aims at satisfying the various operations in mathematics on the one hand and a tool to represent quantities hierarchially.

  

If zero by itself is considered to be a mere symbol without any supporting reality so too are the symbols for addition, subtraction, etc. When were these symbols first put to use?

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
