Dear Vidwans,

  

Is there any work on the concept of quantity and its evolution into the number system on the one hand and its evolution into geometry (Euclidean) on the otherhand.

  

In this regard how important is the concept of the whole with respect to measurement? Is there any comparable concept of the whole in Greek Philosophy?

  

Language has to invariably start from 'isness'. What relation is there between क and ख? What is the similarity and what is the difference? Has it anything to do with the place of phonation of the two letters that afford a distinction between the two letters though being of the same class? The concept of zero or emptyness has therefore to evolve from the concept of space. That this concept of emptiness could not evolve and be put to use in the Greek numeral system in the West is amusing in spite of the fact that so much work was done by the Greeks in geometry.

  

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
