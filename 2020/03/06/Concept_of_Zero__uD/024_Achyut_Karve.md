Dear Vidwans,

  

The best example of zero is the word and its meaning. A word is not for itself. It is at the service of its meaning which is its purpose. 
Similarly zero for itself is nothing but is at the service at the digits 1 to 9. Unlike words where repetition of the same word does not add to the meaning zero can be added repeatedly to the digits which increases their potency. For eg 1, 10, 100 ..... or 0.1, 0.01, 0.001 ....

  

The statement siddhe shabdartha sambandhe stands as a testimony to the above observation.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve
