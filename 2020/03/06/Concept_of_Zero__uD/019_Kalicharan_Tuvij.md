Understanding of subjects like Real Analysis, Group Theory are prerequisites to talk gainfully about such topics.

Indian greats such as Shanti Narayana, A R Vashishtha, J N Kapur and a few others have authored comprehensive introductory texts (available at dirt cheap prices) on such subjects.

I wished some of these were taught to every Indian below 25yrs of age as optionals in the syllabus.
