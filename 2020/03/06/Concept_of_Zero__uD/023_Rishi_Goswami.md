I actually googled and watched 1-2 videos on it. I used to fail in maths so I couldn't understand anything.  
  
What I actually have understood by reading Gita 2.16, interrogating with myself and thinking about it, is that 0 cannot be Asat, nor it should be considered as Satpratiyogika.  
  
What I understand right now, is that Universe has 0 energy, 0 matter due to law of conservation of energy. Positive and Negative cancel each other, and what remains is, 0. In that case, how do we have anything? There should be no existence if it's 0. Or, it should be an illusion, but turns out it isn't.  
  
Also, if Universe is expanding, where is it expanding into? Means that Space as we imagined is not just nothingness, it is also a Bhaava Padarth. Hence we say तस्माद्वा एतस्माद् आत्मन आकाशः सम्भूतः।  
  
The creation of space always confused me and what I've concluded is, 0 is relative to 1 and 1 needs 0 to rest upon. And everything else rests upon 1 and 0, but what will 0 and 1 rest upon?  
  
I think thats Absoulte Reality which can never not exist and Nothingness, or Absoulte Inexistence is something which can never exist.  
  
This is just based on Vedanta what I have been able to percieve, Non-Mathematically.
