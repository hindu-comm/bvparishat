I have heard Puri Shankaracharya ji's Nishchalanandji's videos on Zero as a Bhaava Padartha.  
  
I think it is not 1-1 but as Science explains Space as 1+(-1) in the sense +ve and -ve energy cancel each other and what you get as remainder is 0. So now 0 or Space is also not Nothingness.  
  
It can also be explained as how a blackhole is empty of Spacetime, because absence is a relative term (ससम्बन्धिक पदार्थ) like Guru Mitra Pita. As soon as we say absence, we ask "of what?" So 0 is 0 only if there is 1. 1 or matter is also relative, because 1 is 1 can be stable only through 0, where do atoms rest? In space.  
  
Hence there are no atoms, even light doesn't enter blackholes, and because there are no events, time is absent there, hence absence of spacetime.  
  
This probably explains how Upanishads say तस्माद्वा एतस्माद् आत्मन आकाशः सम्भूतः। I was always confused how can Space be created, but if we imagine 0 as 1+(-1), probably even 0 or Space can be treated as Bhaava Padartha.
