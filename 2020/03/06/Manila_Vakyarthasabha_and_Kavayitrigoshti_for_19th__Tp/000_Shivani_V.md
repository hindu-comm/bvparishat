Respected scholars,

  

Greetings from Karnataka Samskrit University!

  

  

It is my pleasure to share with you that the proposal to conduct Mahilavakyarthasabha and Kavayitrigoshti at 18th World Sanskrit Conference (<https://www.wsc2021.com.au>) is accepted as a special panel. Scholars are requested to send recommendations of young women candidates for vakyartha (in any shastra) and Kavayitrigoshti to [shiva...@gmail.com]().

  

The selection of candidates will be purely based on merit. The recommendation with short resume and recent published poems is appreciated. The decision of selection committee will be final and binding for all.

  

NB: Financial support is not promised.

  

  

  

  

  

Regards
