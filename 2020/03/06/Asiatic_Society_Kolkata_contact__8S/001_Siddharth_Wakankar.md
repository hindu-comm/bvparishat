Sir,

  

My agonising experience with the Asiatic Society tells me that you must have enough punya to get a reply from it or you must go through a local Bengali scholar.I have been visiting A.S.since 1986, but now the times and people at the helm have changed.

  

Best of luck to you.

  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
