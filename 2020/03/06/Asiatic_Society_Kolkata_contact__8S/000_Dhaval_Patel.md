Dear list members,

  

Is there any member on this list who can help me regarding a matter with Asiatic Society Kolkata?

I had submitted a paper 5 months back and received a mail that the paper was received and was under process. I have not been able to elicit any response whether the paper is accepted or not. This has created a limbo. I am not able to submit the paper to other journals also, so as to avoid duplicate publication. Emails have not been responded to. Phone calls remain unanswered.

  

If any member would extend some help off list, I would be grateful.
