There is the upakhyana of Karkati or Visuchi in the Utpatti prakaranam of Yogavasishtha, which describes the Rakshasi Karkati (usually thought of as the embodiment of Cholera), how it attacks pilgrims in teertha etc.; she then attains Brahmajnana. There is also a mantra prescribed there to keep the disease away. And for good measure, Vasishtha says its all a play of the mind.
