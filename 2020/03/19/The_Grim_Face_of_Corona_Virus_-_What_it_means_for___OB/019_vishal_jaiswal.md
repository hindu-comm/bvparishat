I'll add one thing to this list,

The real virus is western style consumerist driven modern progress and development powered on the wings of modern science and technology as was defined in the US before ww2 , which the rest of the world has been faithfully following since then.

The current outbreak is simply one of many waiting to happen as a direct consequence.

If the reaction of humanity to the ever increasing toxic air was even a fraction of the frenzy surrounding the Corona virus, the world would be a radically different place today.

But such is not meant to be the fate of KaliYuga.

With eyes wide open, modern humans continue to remain stubbornly blind.
