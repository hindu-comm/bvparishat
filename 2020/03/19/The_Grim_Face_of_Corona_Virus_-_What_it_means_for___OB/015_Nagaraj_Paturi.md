Dear Sri Damodara Dasa-ji,

  

Though it is true that the care to which the world society is forced today is making the world understand the rationale behind and usefulness of many 'Hindu' customs of greeting, touch-related norms of hygiene etc., the following from you is unwarranted and a misrepresentation of Hindu worldview:

  

Regarding many people dying due to this virus, first of all not many  
people are dying; it is only 3-4% of those who are confirmed cases. In  
USA this year due to flu only about 13000 have died and 2 million have  
been affected.  
  
Second of all, at least as Indians, we have the philosophy (which is  
reality based) that we do not die with the death of body. So death may  
be a shock for those who believe that we are body and that after death  
we are finished; the soul doesn't exist and thus there is no question  
of next birth. The idea of continuity of life (or consciousness) is  
ingrained into our philosophy. In Bhagavad-gita Lord Krishna starts  
his official instruction by proving this point and He says that  
"dhiras-tatra na muhyati."  
  
So because there is re-birth there is law of karma also and thus "as  

you sow, so shall you reap."

  

Such interpretations of Vedic /'Hindu' philosophy are the ones which lead to complacency, akarma , inaction which is discouraged by Geetaachaarya.

  

Yes, it is true that ill effects of increased Global interconnectivity etc. are being realized during the present context. But can we turn the wheel of time backwards?

  

Yes, many of the Gandhian principles are getting vindicated now. Villages are safer than urban areas in this context. This should make people get discouraged from the blind and rampant urbanization. Lets hope the pace gets decelerated.

  

But none of these facts warrants an attitude of

  

'deaths are not too many; few deaths, so OK; don't worry about deaths etc'.
