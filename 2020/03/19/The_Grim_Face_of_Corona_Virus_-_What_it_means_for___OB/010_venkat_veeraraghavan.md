Dear all

While the negative effects of Corona on humans have been well documented there are some pros too....

1\. A need based economy as opposed to a greed driven one.

2\. The air of Chennai after just 3 days of corona related lockdown is cleaner than what it was 20 years back and its a shame i cannot enjoy driving through the empty roads..

3\. Global warming judgement day has probably been postponed significantly and nature gets a chance to recuperate from the human virus.

4\. Cubicle rats and corporate hamsters are evolving into a new (mythical? ) life form that has been mentioned in 3rd grade science textbooks.....the homosapien

5\. Bogans and bhogis are evolving into yogis what with all the focus on what to touch what not to touch...action awareness and consequence the holy 'triumvirate' of yoga

6\. The expanding of vocabulary. ..covidiot is apparently a new addition do check it out...

7\. People remember and consider others before self especially the elderly. ..maybe there is hope afterall?

Keep adding to this list

Cheers to all...
