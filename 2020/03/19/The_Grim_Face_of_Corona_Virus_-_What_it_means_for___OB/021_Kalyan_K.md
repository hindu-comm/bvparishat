//Putting greed before need has consequences.//  
  
I read somewhere that the more we humans invade the habitats of animals, the more the chances of such new viruses emerging.  
  
Thank you for reminding that the earth is not just for humans. I will end with a quote from Isa upanishad -  
  
यस्मिन्सर्वानि भूतानन्यात्मैवभुद्विजानतः ।  
तत्र को मोहः कः शोक एकत्वमनुपश्यतः ॥
