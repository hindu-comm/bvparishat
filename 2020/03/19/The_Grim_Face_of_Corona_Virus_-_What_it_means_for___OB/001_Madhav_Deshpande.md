Things are getting seriouslybad here in the US.This morning I called one of my professors who is 83 years old and lives alone in a high-rise building in downtown Philadelphia. She had so much difficulty getting groceries and medicines, as she is not supposed to leave her apartment and home deliveries are crashing. Some younger occupants of that building are teaming up to help the elderly and she is looking toward this group to help her out. I felt very sad after talking to her. We are very lucky to be close to the families of our daughters. Yesterday, our son in law dropped groceries at our door. Not only half the shelves in the store were empty, he had to wait for two hours in a line to check out. There was also rationing at the store. Only one box of milk and one loaf of bread per family. No cleaning products are available. I tried to order some from Amazon. They do not have any delivery dates available even till the end of April. The Trump government is estimating that this crisis will last for 18 months, and the economic impact of this crisis will be worse than the Great Depression. The US auto industry is shutting down all its assembly plants. Already, millions of people have lost their jobs. This has been the most worrisome period in my life.
