Is it not scientific temper that made people realize that Namaste is a safer and healthier way of greeting than shaking hands?

  

Is it not scientific temper that is making people realize that many touch related hygiene practices that were ridiculed as Brahmanical, OCD -like and all are in fact necessary for all?

  

Is it not scientific temper that made people realize the difference between social distancing and social exclusion / social discrimination and  that social distancing is not social exclusion or social discrimination?

  

What is all the scientific temper stuff that is drummed in the article doing other than recommending social distancing that has been misunderstood, misrepresented and demonized by the scientific temper bandwagon all the time?
