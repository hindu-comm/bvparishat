Corona Virus might have inhibited much movement and normal human intercourse.  

But it can also be seen as having some positive aspect.  

  

The Cambridge University has, for example, made available its texts  

\- for online reading, and till the end of May only.  

One can sit at home and go through some of its useful publications.  

Try this link (hoping it is licit) :

<https://www.cambridge.org/core/what-we-publish/textbooks> .

  

Have other universities in the West done this too?

Have Indian universities thought of this?

Would our Sanskrit universities contemplate this?
