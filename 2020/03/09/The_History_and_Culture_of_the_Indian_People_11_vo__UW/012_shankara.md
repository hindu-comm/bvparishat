Namaste,

  

I have soft copies of 1940 and 1968 editions only. If you could specify the contents of the missing pages, I can extract those pages and share with you.

  

Otherwise, if any member of BVP has got hard copy of 2007 edition, they could scan and send those pages to you.  

  

regards  
shankara
