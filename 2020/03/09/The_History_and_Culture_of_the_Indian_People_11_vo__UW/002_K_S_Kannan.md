I do not know whether this question is proper or not  

(or even whether this is proper on this forum):

Is Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan funded by the State/Central Government partially or fully?

Does the organisation receive governmental grants for its projects and programmes?

  

The organisation had once earned an epithet from some quarters  

that it toed the track set by the erstwhile Government.

I am not sure whether it is true or not.

  

My point is when they get a thousand DVDs done, it may be fairly expensive,

and there must be some fairness in the utilisation of the product  

\- for its libraries, or for sale for the public.

Many governmental bodies can be notoriously slow.
