Namaste,

  

This particular project was done under one of the Birla foundations / trusts. It was supposed to be on sale for Rs. 1000/- or so. Will check with BVB and see if they have copies left for sale. We also did the archive of the all the issue of the first 63 years, 1954-2017, of Bhavan's Journal; it was released by Sri Pranab Mukharjee in July 2019. Again the same fate - they are suppose to be selling them. Both of these are very valuable resources.

  

regards........yoga
