Namaste,

  

There are more than one edition of Medini Kosa ed. by Hoshing Sastri. Page numbers are not the same in all editions. Are you looking for a particular edition? 1968 edition of the Kosa is available at <https://archive.org/details/MediniKoshaChowkhamba/page/n3/mode/1up>

  

regards  
shankara
