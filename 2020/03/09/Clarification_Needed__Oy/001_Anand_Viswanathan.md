Brihatsaama is a pattern of svaras (also pattern of words/ parvas) applied on riks (yonimantras). In Rahasyagaanam/oohyagaanam, it typically is made up of three parts , each part having 14 parvas/words. Hence 14 x 3 words (+ some nidhanastobhas) occur in many BrihatSaama. It is not one particular Saama's name. It is neither confined to one particular Yonimantra. Following are some examples of Brihat Saama-s (Also attached as images. I have attached a small mp3 file for the first segment of the first Saama to give an idea of how it is chanted). The first one is in dasharaatraparva and the second is from samvatsaraparva. There are more Brihatsaama-s in other parvas as well.

Rathantaram is another extremely important Saama in Saamaveda that is associated with the Sun and also BrihatSaama. It is defined in Archikabhashyam as " स्वरादिविशेषानुपूर्वीमात्रस्वरूपे ऋगक्षरव्यतिरिक्तं यत्गानम् तद्रथन्तरम्". Similar lakshanam holds good for BrihatSaama also.

There may be some mantra describing this but I am posting some shlokas here.

  

प्रथमश्च द्वितीयश्च तृतीयोऽथ चतुर्थकः ।  

मन्द्रः क्रुष्टो ह्यतिस्वार एतान् कुर्वन्ति सामगाः ॥ (नारदीयशिक्षा १.१.१२)

  

The above shloka lists the names of svaras in Saamagaanam. There are other avaantarasvaras like  

अभिगीतम्, विनतम् etc. also. I am talking with Kauthumashaakhaa in mind.

  

यः सामगानां प्रथमः स वेणोर्मध्यमः स्वरः ।  

यो द्वितीयः स गान्धारस्तृतीयस्त्वृषभः स्मृतः ॥ (नारदीयशिक्षा १.५.१)

चतुर्थः षड्ज इत्याहुः पञ्चमो धैवतो भवेत् ।  

षष्ठो निषादो विज्ञेयः सप्तमः पञ्चमः स्मृतः ॥ (नारदीयशिक्षा १.५.२)

  

The above shlokas give the correspondence between Sangeetasvaras and Saamasvaras. Venu's madhyama = Saamagaanam's prathamasvara. The word Venu is not taken as the important paatha by some scholars . Instead they suggest "विशेन्मध्यमः"  

  

In practice, with respect to frequency, Krushta is the highest svara, above prathamasvara. Atisvaaryam is the lowest svara  

Krushta is extremely rare. Most mantras have 5 or 6 svaras in Kauthuma shaakhaa.

I am not entirely clear about this question but if you mean how many shaakhaas, then three are extant namely कौथुमशाखा, राणायणीयशाखा and जैमिनीयशाखा

Earlier there were many more, probably 100s. The popular number 1000 (सहस्रवर्त्मा) for the number of shaakhaas might have been used to indicate a large number of branches (bahutvavaachi).

In the Saama-upaakarma, 13 Saamagaacharyas are remembered.

Again, I am not able to understand this question clearly. Is it for some specific phalam or occasion or ritual? Or entirely something else.

All Saama-s are sung. There are thousands of them in each Shaakhaa. Probably roughly 3000 saama-s in Kauthuma Shakhaa.

Many of them have been used in viniyoga for specific satrams. There are sama-s for punyaahavaachanam, 16 upachaaras etc. also.
