//The relatively unknown temple of Kailasamudayar in Cholamadevi near Trichy is one with a historical significance.The temple was built by Rajaraja I was called as ‘Thenkarai Brahmadeyam Sri Cholamadevi Chadurvedi Mangalam'. Here we find an interesting reference to Adi Sankara.//

The temple has an inscription of 11th century mentioning about a grant given for expounding ‘Bhagavad Paadeeyam Saareeraka Mimamsa Bhashya on which one Chidananda Bhatarar wrote a commentary. The sastra is nothing but the Brahma Sutra Bhashya written by Adi Sankara Bhagavatpada

The location of the inscription in the temple is near the place meant for Dakshinamurthy. This shows the further proof of the Adivaita tradition as the Dakshinamurthy Ashtaka is recited before the Sankara Bhashya.This is perhaps the earliest inscription based reference of Sankara.

Is there any way one can verify the above information about the inscription?
