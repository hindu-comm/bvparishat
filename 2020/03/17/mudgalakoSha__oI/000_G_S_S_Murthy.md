Respected scholars,

I have offline version of Mudgakosha on my PC. While checking the word यष्टि I was surprised to find that it lists its gender as neuter. I have rechecked in Apte and a Kannada dictionary which list the word as masculine/feminine. Apparently mudgalakosha's listing is incorrect. I do not know the antecedents of mudgalakosha. I have all along assumed that "n" in Mudgalakosha stands for "neuter".I would be obliged for guidance.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
