Does anyone have a softcopy of this text?

  

There seem to be two editions:

  

1\. 1985 Jammu edition:<https://www.worldcat.org/title/bhrgasahit-bhringeesh-samhita-topography-of-ancient-kashmir/oclc/978056035&referer=brief_results>

and 2. 1986 Delhi edition:<https://www.worldcat.org/title/bhrmgisasamhita-bhasa-tika/oclc/159823273&referer=brief_results>

  

Our university library stopped issuing physical materials due to the pandemic. I could not find it on [archive.org](http://archive.org). Sometimes the search on the archive doesn't work due to spelling variations. I would be very grateful if anyone can share it.

  

Best regards,

  

Deepro
