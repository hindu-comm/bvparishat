namaste,

  

I am looking for a book:

<https://books.google.com/books?id=VojRgPgmS-MC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false>

  

Key to the Vedas by Mikhailov and Mikhailova  

  

It appears to be not cataloged anywhere! Irene-ji noted that this was part of a 3 vol book originally published in Russian. If anybody could share a soft or old copy of the book, that would be great.

  

thanks

..gopal gopinath
