Dear All,

  

Namaste,



We write to inform you about the indefinite postponement of the “Conference on Indigenous Environmentalism” scheduled to be held on 28th March.



We took this decision considering the emerging situation arising out of COVID 19 and the consequent need to reduce both travel and gatherings.



We are hoping to hold the Conference as soon as the situation returns to normal.
