Profs Ramakrishna Pejathaya & Neethu S. Kumar informed me as follows:  

  

we have decided to postpone the 5-day workshop on Avadhanam scheduled
11th to 15th March, (at CVV, Veliyanad , Kerala) in view of the recent COVID-19 (Coronavirus) outbreak in Kerala.

  

This decision was taken after careful consideration of the developing situation and in consultation with the local health department officials, to ensure that the participants, resourcepersons, and the members in CVV are not exposed to the risk of contracting the virus.

  

We will reschedule it later once the situation stabilizes, in consultation with Indic Academy.

  

We thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
