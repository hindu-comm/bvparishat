Dear All,

  

Namaste



We write to inform you about the indefinite postponement of the “Seminar on Rituals” scheduled to be held on 21st March at CIF, Veliyanad, Kerala.



We took this decision considering the emerging situation arising out of COVID 19 and the consequent need to reduce both travel and gatherings.



We are hoping to hold the Seminar as soon as the situation returns to normal.
