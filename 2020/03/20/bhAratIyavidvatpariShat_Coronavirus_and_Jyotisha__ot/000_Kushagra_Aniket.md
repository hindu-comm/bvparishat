Dear Members,

  

Has anybody conducted a Jyotisha analysis of the pandemic engulfing the world? The present Paridhavi Samvatsara has lived up to its name. We hope that the upcoming Pramadi would bring some rest.

  

I have seen some discussion of March 24 (Chaitra Shukla Pratipada) and April 13 (Mesha Sankranti) as critical dates. However, I would be interested in reading any scholarly opinion on this crisis.

  

Regards,

Kushagra
