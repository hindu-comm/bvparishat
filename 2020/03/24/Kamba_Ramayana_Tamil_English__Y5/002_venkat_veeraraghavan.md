Dear Shri NItyananda Das,

  

Thanks for the details.

  

There are a few English only versions.

I was looking for Tamil and English combined like the one at [valmikiramayan.net](http://valmikiramayan.net)

  

Kamba Ramayana is predominantly a work of great aesthetic and poetic beauty and the English only version is like eating a cone without the ice cream !!!

  

The Tamizh however is a bit archaic and hence a little help improves both poetic appreciation and is a fun way of learning the language of Kamban.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
