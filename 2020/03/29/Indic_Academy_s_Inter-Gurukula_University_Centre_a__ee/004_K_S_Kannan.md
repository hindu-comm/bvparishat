Great themes many of the above are.

Perhaps to add - as the following things are going on  

in a very regular, possibly **systematic**, manner.

  

(I am only floating the issues.  

They may need some refinement in terms of reframing/rephrasing):

  

Anti-Hindu depictions in Mainstream media  

\- since the beginning of the 20th Century

\- & especially after Independence,  

& under different heads such as -  

In films and plays, novels and poetry, and TV prog.s (official, private channels).  

In text books in India

  

Poets/novelists/story writers/playwrights etc. who waxed eloquent in praise of Christ (or even the Buddha)  

but not one positive word about Rama/Krishna etc; or any Indian king/saint of history/legend  

\- & India has had hundreds if not thousands of them - (or wrote only negatively about them).

  

How many films etc. stereotype the religious Hindu=villain (plus Muslim/Christian=good guy) theme;

(for ex. interfaith love marriages in films showing support by a padri/moulvi, but sought to be wrecked by Hindu parents/community)

\- as these have a predictable impact on the youth.  

How many portray Muslim boy & Hindu (more likely Brahmin) girl dalliance etc.

How many temple precincts utilised for depiction of such love scenes/obscene dancing etc.

How many had Brahmin-bashing as their central (or as subplot) theme.

How many attacks/atrocities against Hindu ideas/ideals/symbols have been whitewashed

\- in the past, in the present continuous in our media?

(Portraying a terrorist - as the "son of a poor teacher", or as but a "19-year old moon-faced girl";

the call yesterday by an Infosys employee to spread coronavirus - as that of "a schizophrenic deserving pity",

destruction of temples and using them to build mosques - as "architectural reuse" etc. etc. etc.).

How many (articles and books in recent times) hush up vandalistic burning of our libraries, and the treasures lost thereupon

\- as just "fire accidents" - as done by Prof. Pollock  

  

How many films etc. show any Hindu boy/girl in any traditional outfit  

(as in any Veda/Sanskrit pathashala, etc.) as having any positive quality.

  

How many intellectuals display a colonised mentality full time/part-time.  

  

All the above (and going especially by the large scale involvement of the political/intellectual in the above),

have contributed in a very large measure to the enervating/aberration of the Hindu ethos,

which has had its *cascading effect* on incremental/full **loss of governmental, and *even public,*** ***patronage* to**

**Sanskrit/Vedic studies etc., & to Indian classical music/dance/shilpa/architecture etc. etc.**

**  
**

How much (both in absolute value and percentage) of temple funds have been

(and still are being) utilised for secular purposes? Even against the background of many temples in a dilapidated condition.

In how many temples worship was disallowed subsequent to take over by ASI?

In how many did/does the priest get salary lower than the sweeper?

How many priests still get 3-digit salary monthly even today

How many lack funds for oil and wicks for lamps before the devata-murti  

(In contrast, what salary/perks do Mullahs/Bishops enjoy

\- on governmental grants & patronage/private (& or or foreign) funding?)

  

What was the pattern of income and expenditure in temples earlier  

\- prior to Moghul/British interventions?

How much of temple resources were devoted to encouragement of traditional arts and crafts?

How did the temple culture involve **all** sections of the society?

What temple documents survive in regard to one/more/all of the above/related issues?

Were temple/royal documents systematically destroyed in different provinces?

Any records for this available,  

or none left? (= the "perfect genocide" as in Kashmir - as noted by Prof. Arvind Sharma)  

  

In the downfall of Hindu society, what lapses could be apportioned to brahma and kshatra

\- individually and in conjunction?

Any remedial lessons for today?  

**  
**

How was (& is) the situation before (and after) incorporating (during Emergency)  

the word "secular" in the Constitution.

  

What do Indian school-texts say about non-Hindu heritages,

and contrastingly,

What Pakistani school-texts say about Hindu heritage.

What other Muslim countries' school books say about Hindu heritage.

What other (Christian) countries' school books say about Hindu heritage.

  

In what varied ways, our schools (esp. Christian, and following the, other)

effectively de-Hinduised school boys and girls - by acts such as discouraging

tilaka/flowers/bangles etc. for girls, and pundra/shikhA for boys etc etc.

Under what (governmental/peer)pressure did even Hindu schools implement these  

  

In Encyclopedias, what due credit has been denied to Hindus?

And in Wikipedia etc.? And what distortions?  

  

How many Christian tracts were produced "studying" Hinduism,

only to portray it negative light - right since 1800s.

(In Calcutta/Chennai/Bangalore alone it should run to a few hundreds).  

What impact did this have on conversion activities.

  

"...the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955 imposes a compulsory monogamy alien to Hinduism

and disliked by many of both the sexes...." - JHHutton says in his Foreword to

Irawati Karve's *Kinship Organization in India* (1965).  

What forces led to this situation, and with what impact?

Why were other religions spared, & to what effect on demography?

Have periodical demographic maps (on religious lines) been regularly produced?

If yes, are they available? If no, why? Can they be reconstructed?  

  

I feel no *systematic* study has been done on these and similar issues.

Even if a small percentage of the above issues are probed into,

it could help strengthening our roots and fortifying our heritage.

(This mail may please be ignored/excused if I have transgressed the limits or spirit  

of Indic academic pursuits).

  

Sorry, lastly, for the long mail.
