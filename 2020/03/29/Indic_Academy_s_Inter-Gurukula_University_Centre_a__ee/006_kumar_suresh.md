Dear Prof. Kannan,

 You have, infact, brought fundamental issues to the notice of Indic Academy. I also wish to know your opinion on how far these issuesare addressed by some of the dedicated scholars like Rajiv Malhotra ji. Sorry, I have not really analyzed anybody's work in detail. But I notice during the public discussions these issues are very commonly present. Thank you!
