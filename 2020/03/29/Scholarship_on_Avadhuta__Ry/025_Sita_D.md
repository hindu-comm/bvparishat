Thanks, Nagaraj-ji.

  

I was aware of the legends surrounding Hastamalakacarya and had previously studied his stotra, the Hastamalakiyam. (I have deep interest in Advaita darsana.)

Was just curious to learn more on whether the tradition has explicitly identified him as an Avadhuta.

  

Thanks again.
