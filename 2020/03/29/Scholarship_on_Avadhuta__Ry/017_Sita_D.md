Many thanks for all the suggestions received so far. Please feel free to add more if you find anything new.  
  
As Nagaraj-ji mentioned, I too was unable to find any theoretical analysis of the Avadhuta concept in itself, in contrast to the more pointed studies on Dattatreya. This is what prompted me to post my query here--to make sure I'm not missing anything.  
  
Thanks.
