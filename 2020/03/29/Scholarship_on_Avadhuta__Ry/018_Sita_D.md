Hello everyone,

  

Following up on all your very helpful suggestions, I'm struggling to find a copy ofJaya Chamaraja Wadiyar's*Avadhūta: Reason and Reverence*, Indian Institute of World Culture, Bangalore, 1958

  

I wanted to check if any of the list-members might have a soft copy or some other link for the book. I already tried the usual sources ([archive.org](http://archive.org), etc.,)

  

Many thanks.
