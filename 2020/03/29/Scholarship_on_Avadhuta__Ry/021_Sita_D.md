Yogananda-ji,

  

Thanks for your generosity. I just sent you a separate email.

  

Nagaraj-ji,

  

I just had a question from your previous suggestions. You noted Hastamalaka as an Avadhuta. Could you share any resource where he is referred to as such? (This is turning out to be an interesting line of inquiry to see when and why one gets the Avadhuta appellation.)

  

Thanks.
