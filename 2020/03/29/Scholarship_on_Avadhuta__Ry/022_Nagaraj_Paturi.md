I don't remember any document which describes Hastaamalakaachaaryaas Avadhoota.

  

But any general description of him found in any random source like

  

He had a son who though appearing quite handsome, *behaved rather like an idiot*. Though[upanayanam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upanayanam "Upanayanam")was performed for him, he did not take to studying the Vedas, instead *preferred to sit around doing nothing*. Hearing about Adi Shankara's visit, Prabhākara approached the[Acharya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Shankara "Adi Shankara")(*teacher*) with a load of fruit and prostrated before him. He also made his son prostrate before him. Prabhākara explained to Adi Shankara that his son *behaved rather like an idiot and sat idly throughout the day.*

  

Then, Adi Shankara addressed that young boy and asked him who he was. *The boy replied in 12 verses containing the gist of the*[Advaita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita "Advaita")philosophy  

  

Such a combination of features , a jnaani appearing as a moodha made me identify him as Avadhoota.
