Hello scholars,

  

I'm looking for any critical scholarship on the Avadhuta figure. This may include secondary scholarship on the Avadhuta-Gita, etc., but my primary focus is on the study of the Avadhuta figure and his portrayal in different literary sources.

  

I've so far found a monograph on Dattatreya (generally identified as the archetypal Avadhuta) by Antonio Rigopoulos, but am looking for further leads. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.

  

(Sorry for the missing diacritics--writing this email from a system that doesn't have them installed!)

  

Sincerely, Sita
