The same superciliousness continues to this day.

For Europeans, the Veda was all after all of a museum value.

Or at least must be reduced to one of museum value.

So imperative it is!

  

In the name of the Vatican, in the name of rationalism,  

in the name of secularism, in the name of science, in the name of  

human rights, in the name of feminism &c. &c. :  

the more the garbs change - for different veneer or sophisticated varnish,

the more the essential agenda remains the same : tarnish first, terminate next.  

Convert to my fold, or change to my mold - or else perish!  

  

After all, how many civilisations have they not destroyed! Dutifully at that!  

Cultural Genocide is second nature to them.

Quintessential racists through history, they will be out to raise a hue and cry:

"Hey you are practising racism!"

(- the few exceptions excepted).  

  

Vulture, preach culture!
