That said,

  

Home 'remedies' being suggested are not in fact remedies for curing a patient suffering from the symptoms.

  

They are being suggested as

  

Immunity boosters

  

Symptomatic relief for symptoms with no confirmation of viral infection

  

Cleansing the virus from the throat in its early stages, before it reaches the lungs

  

........

  

Ayurveda experts on the list may be able to discuss the efficacy of the specific home remedy mentioned by you.
