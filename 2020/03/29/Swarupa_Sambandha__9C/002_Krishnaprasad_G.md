Still I will give a try

  

Sambandha is a thing which helps us to identify two objects together. Which means we are able to identify an adjective and substantive.

  

abhava is a padaartha and the ground is also a padartha. we are able to identify abhaava as adjective and the ground is substantive. So some relation should have helped us to perceive so. That should be svaroopa relation. It is called daishika viveshaNataa as when we point our finger towards ground we can should the svaroopa of ground and nothing else.

  

The other one you are asking doubt is thus

the jar is on the ground. hence aadheyataa is in jar. So now, can you point the finger and show the aadheytaain jar? you can show nothing but the jar itself for the adheyataa. so this is called kevalasvaroopa.

  

The thing you said "natural to it is etc " is just meaning lessand it is clear you have misunderstood.
