What is Swarupa Sambandha? I used to think it is the Natural/Swabhavik nature of something.

  

For eg, Ghatabhav is natural on floor. Floors form isn't to be yukta with ghata, hence Ghatabhav is natural to it. But Ghat can be Adheya through Sanyog Sambandh or Gandh can be Adhey through Samvay Sambandh. These are Agantuk Dharmas. And Samavay is Nitya Dharma, but Swarup can go away also on Ghat coming.

  

Anything Sanyukt is Sanyukt and Samvet is Samvet, so Bhaav can't be Swarupatah/naturally in something.

  

Only Abhaav can be Swarupatah in something. Daishika Visheshanata. Hence that's written as Abhaava-Matra-Pratiyogikah.

  

Still, we can have घटाभावप्रतियोगिक-आधेयतानुयोगि भूतलम्? So Ghatabheva is through Adheyata Sambandh, but definition says सम्बन्धान्तरेण प्रतीत्ययोग्यत्वम्।

  

Second and third is dikkrita and kalakrita. Everything is born in some time. घटजन्मप्रतियोगि-स्वरूप-सम्बन्धानुयोगी कालः। but still can be substituted as Adheyata again.

  

We can understand it's natural for some birth/karya to be born in some time and direction. So like Ghatabhaava is Natural to Bhootal, similarly, GhataJanma is Natural to Dikkala.

I'm not able to understand Kevalaswarupa. Kindly explain.
