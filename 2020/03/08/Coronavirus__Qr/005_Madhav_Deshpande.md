Thanks, Krishnaprasad Ji. Monier Williams gives both masculine and neuter genders. In any case, कार्यालय in the sense of office is a modern word used in masculine gender in Hindi and neuter in Marathi, though in Marathi it has a difference sense, a wedding hall. Bringing such words into Sanskrit, there is no predefined gender.
