In the following page of Mahabharata, it is said:

  

Then Dhananjaya, filled with rage, inspiring with mantras another celestial weapons that looked like fire and that resembled the poison of the snake and that was as hard as the essence of adamant, and uniting the Raudra weapon with it, became desirous of shooting it at his foe. At that time, O king, the earth swallowed up one of wheels of Karna's car. Quickly alighting then from his vehicle, he seized his sunken wheel with his two arms and endeavoured to lift it up with a great effort.

Questions that arises is: Are the Raudra and Pasupata two names for the same astra? and -

Did Arjuna ever employ the Pasupata astra that he obtained from Shiva?

  

Scholars may kindly address these.
