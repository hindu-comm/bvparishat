 Sh. Achar admits that the later richa-s could replace the older ones. We should supplement this understanding with the fact that gradually the lines of rsi-s went dry. So, even though a single organic entity, the Rig-Veda has newer elements more in some mandala-s in comparison to some other mandala-s.

 The 1st and 10th mandala-s received these innovations in much greater numbers, not without a reason.

  

 Re astronomical device in history research:

Because of possible nakshatra changes effected in each yuga, any astronomical evidence from pre Kaliyuga age can yield wrong results. Additionally, I don't think there is anything astronomical in Rig Veda.

 Tilak's research methodology in hindsight is quite hairbrained. Sh. Achar has produced far better research given the limitation (e.g. fragility) of such calculations (my favorite: his short paper on five year yuga).

  

 Sh. Talageri has-

1\) not denied but improved upon Western research methods and results.

2\) produced results which if proven wrong later would fail gracefully (e.g. Veda/ P.I.E. at say 6000 BCE instead of 3000 BCE).

3\) has produced a text book like stuff (that others like Sh. C K Raju can replicate in their respective fields) so that younger ones benefit.
