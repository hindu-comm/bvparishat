Entinī cilaṅkakaḷ, entinī kaivaḷakaḷ, 

Eṉ priyaṉ eṉṉarikil varillayeṅkil?

എന്തിനീ ചിലങ്കകൾ, എന്തിനീ കൈവളകൾ

എൻ പ്രിയൻ എന്നരികിൽ വരില്ലയെങ്കിൽ?

  

Why these anklets, why these bangles, if my beloved doesn't intend to come beside me?



This is the vilāpam (lamentation) of Vāsavadatta in Kumāraṉ Āśāṉ’s“Karuṇa” (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumaran_Asan> ).

Vāsavadatta yearns for a glimpse of her beloved Upagupta. But this is a one-sided love. Upagupta, a Buddha Bhikṣu, sends the message that the time is not ripe for the meeting (samayam āyilla.)

In which ancient Sanskrit/Prakrit work is found this story of Vāsavadatta and Upagupta?

The song is from the movie “Karuṇa”, the celluloid version of āśāṉ’s famous poetical composition of the same name. The lyrics are from āśāṉ’s poem and is sung by P. Suseela.
