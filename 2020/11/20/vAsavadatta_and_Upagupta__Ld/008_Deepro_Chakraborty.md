Great to know that the story made its way into other vernacular languages as well.

  

I knew only Tagore's mesmerizing poetic rendition of it, named [অভিসার](https://bn.wikisource.org/wiki/%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%A5%E0%A6%BE/%E0%A6%85%E0%A6%AD%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0) (abhisāra). [Here](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.98390/page/n204/mode/1up) is an English translation of the poem by the poet himself although the translation can no way be compared with the original.
