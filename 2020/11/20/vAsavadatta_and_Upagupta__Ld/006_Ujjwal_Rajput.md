The oldest known version of the monk Upagupta and the courtzan Vāsavadattā is found in the Buddhist Aśokāvadāna, edited by Sujitkumar Mukhopadhyay, Sahitya Akademi, New Delhi, 1963. This text was translated into Chinese in the 2nd century A.D. and hence goes back further by a few centuries. This story is also found in the Pāṃśupradānāvadāna contained in the collection titled Divyāvadāna belonging to the Vinaya of the Buddhist sect of Sarvāstivādins \[ed by P. L. Vaidya, 1959, Buddhist Sanskrit Series, No. 20, Mithila Institute, Darbhanga\].
