Dear Shri Gudsoorkar Ji,

  

This is an article that I wrote for the Telegraph several years ago. However, it doesn’t cover the religious significance of Chhath Puja:

I will find articles with textual references. There are various theories regarding the origin of this festival, such as Yudhishthira’s worship of Surya Deva during his exile. Others claim that it was brought to Dev in Bihar by certain Saura Brahmins of Maharashtra.  

  

Kushagra
