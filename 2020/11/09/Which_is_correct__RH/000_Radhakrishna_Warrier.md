Which is correct?

1.  शरद् or शरत् when no other word follows it
2.  शरच्चन्द्र, or शरत्चन्द्र
3.  परिषत्or परिषद् when no other word follows it
4.  भगवत् or भगवद् when no other word follows it
5.  भगवत् गीता or भगवद् गीता; The latter seems to be correct but I
    have seen plenty of the former 6.  सत्or सद् when no other word follows it
