Dear Shri Bijoy Ji,

  

Yes, I agree that the Ramacharitamanas is an excellent introduction to Sanskrit.

  

Besides, Sanskrit compositions at the beginning of every canto, there are many instances in which Goswami Ji uses Sanskrit words, instead of commonly spoken Hindi/Awadhi words. This helped improve my vocabulary.

  

An example:

  

गाधिसूनु कह हृदयँ हँसि मुनिहि हरिअरइ सूझ।  
अयमय खाँड़ न ऊखमय अजहुँ न बूझ अबूझ॥  

  

Here, the word "अयमय" is directly borrowed from Sanskrit "अयोमय" ("full of iron"). As you know, the commonly used Hindi word for iron is "लौह" or "लोहा." But Tulsidas has used a less common word "अयस्."

  

Best,

Kushagra

  

P.S.: "I am not a Doctor -- only a Sanskrit enthusiastin my free time!"
