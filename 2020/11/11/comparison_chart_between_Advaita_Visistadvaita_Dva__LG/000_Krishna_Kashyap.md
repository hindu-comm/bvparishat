Namaskar to everyone.

  

I was wondering if someone has done a Tabular chart on comparison between these three schools Advaita, Visistadvaita, Dvaita analysing various aspects of the darshanas in terms of tattva vichara, jiva vichara, sadhana vichara, jada vichara, iswara vichara, pramana vichara etc.

  

I don't want to start from scratch. Some students in my class on Gita are asking for such a chart. If someone has done it already, it will be a great help for me. Even if there are other systems in that chart that would be extra useful.

  

Thanks in advance.

  

Namaskar
