A website with a wealth of books and media content related to Advaita Vedanta and Sringeri Jagadgurus  
  
Centre for Brahmavidya, Chennai is pleased to release on this holy Deepavali day, a one-stop website [www.centreforbrahmavidya.org](http://www.centreforbrahmavidya.org) dedicated to Advaita Vedanta. In this new website, numerous books and media, related to Advaita Acharyas commencing from Sri Gaudapadacharya, which are available for view or download all over the Internet are collated and presented. The website also hosts an impressive collection of books, audios and videos on the life, works and teachings of the Advaita acharyas, the Jagadgurus of Sringeri Sharada Peetham, compiled from many websites and video-sharing platforms like YouTube. It is hoped that this website will be handy for all spiritual seekers and disciples of the Jagadgurus. Needless to mention, the site will be continuously updated. Please visit the site and give us your valuable feedback at [con...@centreforbrahmavidya.org]().  
We feel immensely blessed to release this website on the holy occasion of the Jayanthi of His Holiness Jagadguru Sri Abhinava Vidyatheertha Mahaswamiji.  
Happy Deepavali

I found that many titles of books pertaining to Shankara, Sureshwara, etc. are provided with the download option, with a clear mention that the publisher has permitted download. We get to know about many titles related to Advaita.
