Generous Publishers generally put their books on internet for free access, but in many cases they never allow it to be hosted elsewhere.

This website doesn't link to original website content, but hosts them.  

And, the way they mention that 'download is allowed by publisher' doesn't cover their case. Note that mentioning original website and linking to item hosted on original website are different things.  

I highly doubt that they have permission for the same. They may soon attract some objections, more if they start charging money, etc.
