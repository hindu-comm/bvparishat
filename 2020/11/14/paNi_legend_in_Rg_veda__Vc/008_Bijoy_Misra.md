Dear Dr BVK,

You certainly keep track of these more than many. My analysis is purely first principles science.

A speech sound is distinguished by its origin. It is not an imitation.
It is a synthesis of much

neurological differentiation in the brain. The scholar भर्तृहरि has enunciated this in his analysis

from empirical principles. Your name uttered by different individuals might sound different, the

object does not change. The subjectivity of perception is independent of the object. We lately  

observe that the brain economizes new word production and recycles old concepts with new

accents. The scientific phrase is "cognitive economy".

We will survey the western literature in a web seminar on Dec 19. All are invited to join.

I am sharing the flier below. We will come to Indian literature in April. I will share.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
