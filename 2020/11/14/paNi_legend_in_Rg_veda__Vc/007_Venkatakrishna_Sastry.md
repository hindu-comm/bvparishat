Namaste Misra ji



Thanks for picking the challenging point in understanding ' a
langauge- term (पणि ) in a give text ( Rigveda- **Saramā hymn, x. 108** ) which is interpreted differently to milk desired conclusions.

There are several points you have raised in the response. I am addressing some of them below.



1. On \< My principal difficulty in translations ….. a spoken word is supposed to have multiple meanings. This is a fallacy \> : The investigation here can be in multiple directions. Suffice it to say ' polysemy' issue is at the root of multiple 'academic scholarly interpretations and translations in constructing an ancient Samskruth reference ( more precise : vedic term) needs greater care.



 The traditional guidance and frame work for this is provided in the technicalities of ' नाम-रूप - अभिधान अभिज्ञान चिन्तन
वाग्योग वेदाङ्ग- संप्रदाय -शब्द-ब्रह्म जिज्ञासा-मीमांसा-

-मन्त्र योगानुशासनम् ' (- nāma-rūpa - abhidhāna abhijñāna
cintana vāgyōga vēdāṅga- saṁpradāya śabda-brahma jijñāsā-mīmāṁsā-mantrayōgānuśāsanam ). The long attribute is
necessary

to precisely articulate the integrity and interconnectedness of
metaphysics, philosophy and science of language-visioning that forms the foundation of Samskrutham. This is why Veda refers to

Samskrutham as ' Vak-Yoga'; Srividyaa is referred to as surrounded by ' Vak-Yogini devataa's.



 The western models of langauge study, since 18th century have no clarity and clue on the depth of 'Name-form-Relation debate that has gone on in Samskruth tradiiton over several centuries.

Here below are some links to explore and examine:

 There are many related themes that need deliberation to examine the issue raised by you. The pointer terms are : \< नानार्थक -शब्दाः ;
अनेकार्थक -शब्दाः ; विशेष्य-निघ्नाः ; अनेकाभिधेयता ; काव्य-प्रयोग - शास्त्र प्रयोग - परिभाषा-प्रयोग ; दर्शन निरुक्ति ;
अर्थ-निर्वचन ; सरूपता समान-प्रक्रिया रूपसिद्धि ; काव्यार्थ
-वाक्यार्थ - तात्पर्यार्थ - एकवाक्यता ; ईश्वर संकेत ; शब्द-प्रमाण ; श्रुति ; > . These go to the very roots of Samskruth-Langauge Modeling, the design of Samskruth Kosha ( which differs from Lexicon model of west)



The clarityneeds to emerge why Samskruth has a lexicography and not a lexicon ! - <https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_2152021_7/component/file_2152020/content> ; <https://www.academia.edu/20450463/THE_ART_OF_LEXICOGRAPHY>



 - If the intent is to know ' in what sense the term was used in the given passage to communicate what by the ' ancient seer of the sukta', a few millennia ago, my honest answer is ' I do not know'.

 -If the intent is to know ' in what sense the term was understood and used in a ritual passage by the ' practicing community', the vedanga based explanation would be the recourse.

There are multile view points and 'meaning interpretations.

Sayana frequently refers to Katyayana’s Sarvanukramani in his interpretations. According to Sayana, following Katyayana, the
Rgvedic Dialogue hymn.X.108, is Sarama-Pani Samvada, Pani is the

Rushi and Devata . The context is discussion of highest mystic philosophy ' brahma-vaada' . But Maxmuller translates the passage a 'she-dog-dialogue' (?!)-

\]



 - If the intent is to know ' the process of 'word-meaning association and derivation', as a linguistic process. Nirukta- Nighantu is the recourse.

 -If the intent is to know ' in what way in todays context the term can be used for reconstruction of the understanding- utility - benefit- culture-history of bharath, my honest answer is ' It needs a

clean-up Team work by scholars; painful but critical'.
Many feel comfortable to lay a scented carpet on the stink below and feel happy.





2. On \< A given neurological sound has a pre-formed biological meaning. So forms a word. The same word can be applied in different contexts to convey different local meanings. The ज्ञान remains the same. The words are conceptual and not literal. There could be a variety of अर्थ as the context may demand, but there is convergence to the concept. This can be experimented very simply through our common speech. Why the brain uses metaphors in expressing ideas is a good question. "the seed is the father of a tree!" has little literal meaning, but is conceptually understandable. \> : This is current
scientific current modeling and research approach to explore ' NAME-FORM - Language :: FORM-MEMORY Association, Linguistic usage,
Sciences of Cognition - Communication-Computation related DATA ANALYSIS models For A.I studies. These use the Neuro=physiology studies and a specific model of What defines a Body- Brain- Systems and Processes. The science model differs from the Yoga-Science model used in Samskruth/ Yoga studies. The differentiating factor is ' Axiom of Consciousness'. There does exist a great gap in understandig the science advancements which are carrying deep rooted theological biases in current research and their use of defective translations of
samskruth resources tainted with ' motives'. About this the exchange of posts is going on in another forum. summary point: Consciousness is a hot term with less clarity in science. The best of current propositions in neuroscience research as of date are ' still opinions under investigation'. The science trend is to move towards Artificial intelligence and Virtual Consciousness ; where as Yoga-Science trend is to investigate elevated Natural Universal Real Consciousness.





3. On \< After reading through your good references, I continue to think that पण is an old aboriginal word to signify goods….. Then it becomes पणि to signify the person who travels with the trade. …price of the goods. > : I keep my mind open for further exploration. unbiased. There is a great opportunity to learn new things in such debate. Thanks for opening up the flood gates of knowledge.
