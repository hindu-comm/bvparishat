Namaste



Good question :\< The question is if there is any literary reference to पणि in the **literature** \> 



I will only place below the literature references, from ready sources and leave the ' inference', on how the translations and ' preferred meaning associations' are likely to have impacted the deviant understanding of the source text. This is to be respectful to the
position of 'SCHOLARS ACADEMIC FREEDOM'. The western and oriental scholars study is highly valuable resource and serves as a record to show the ' deviant understanding of native scriptures in its own home land resulting in social distancing and divide'!



**The Paṇis occur twelve times in Maṇḍala vi.; once each in ii. and viii.; twice in v. and ix.; thrice in iv. and vii.; six times in viii.; nine times in i.; and four times in x., besides the refer-ences in the Saramā hymn, x. 108.\]**

(२.२.४४) आपणस्तु निषद्यायां विपणिः पण्यवीथिका

```
 (२.८.१३३०) पण्याजीवो ह्यापणिकः क्रयविक्रयिकश्च सः ```

``` (२.८.१३३७) विक्रेयं पणितव्यं च पण्यं क्रय्याऽऽदयस्त्रिषु ```





``` In Amarakosha, the term < पण > has more than 20 references and shades of meaning ! , if the starting point to understand < पणि > has to be < पण> 
```

Amarakosha provides the caution note on how to use the yaugika' meaning in a context sensitive way:

``` (२.८.१४८९) उक्ता भूरिप्रयोगत्वादेकस्मिन् येऽत्र यौगिकाः ```

``` (२.८.१४९०) ताद्धर्म्यादन्यतो वृत्तावूत्द्या लिङ्गाऽन्तरेऽपि ते ```

# If one wants to go for the root apporach, to derive \< पणि \> from \< पण्\> and \< पण\> here is the source reference from NIGHANTU - NIRUKTA itself which eliminates the low meaning associated to the term !\>

The scope of study needs to be amplified to expand the scope of
investigation : \< How the available original references are INTERPRETED/ CONSTRUCTED IN ACADEMIA making a preferential pick of MEANING FROM a basket of choices and models of meaning consturction guidance ? \>



The review also needs to address and audit \< How the traditional schools have been failing to define and defend the ' tradition of Vedanga frame work for understanding source Vedic texts.>.

In the given passage \< panineva gaavah' , the term ' pani' is having multiple meanings, like the term ' Gauh' in Nirukta tradition. So why is one to be constrained to understand the veda mantra by the construction -translation \< \<kine held back by a merchant> ? The Nirukta-Naighatuka tradiiton confirms that the veda-mantra has five layers of meaning and interpretation. so why limit the understanding of ' source-text' to a ' theologically constructed socio-historic frame'?



**Construction of Bharateeya Samskruti-itihasa- Samaja (Culture- History- Social ancestry Identity) is NOT dependent on 'deviant distorted construction of 'Vedic resources' and 'Samskrutham: the language of text. A deviant 'scholarly academic construction of vedic
Samskruth terms like ' pani, dasyu, daasa, vyasa, shudra…' through
preferred modes and models of translation seriously impacts the the understanding of what Rama and Krishna from Ramayana, Mahabharata
and Gita stand for in Bharateaya's. **





**We as a team of scholars from a native tradition, may not know what is /was the real-total meaning of 'Veda. Even our earlier acharyas have acknowledged that ' it is difficult to understand the meaning of vedas and decode their secrets. The last endorsement comes from Acharya Madhva- \[**\[ **अनन्त-नियमैर्युक्ता**** , अनन्तार्थ-विशेषिणः ।
वेदाः इति समासेन नियमोऽयं समीरितः - आचार्य मध्व - ऋग्भाष्य-भूमिका \]** **But we do understand what is NOT A RIGHT CONSTRUCTION, WHAT IS
A HURTING MISCHIEVEOUS CONSTRUCTION. AND CONSEQUENCES OF stepping out of 'VEDNAGA Frame work to understand- Practice Vedas'. **

****

**Vednata is not the bounding box of Vedas. Vedangas are the bounding Box and tools to understand Vedas. ' Schools of Darshana, where in Vedanta is posiitoned is a perspective of what Acharyas say to be the ' summary understanding' and guidance of Vedas for 'Shreyas'. \[ Gita : 2-7: **कार्पण्यदोषोपहतस्वभावः पृच्छामि त्वां धर्मसंमूढचेताः।
**यच्छ्रेयः स्यान्निश्चितं ब्रूहि तन्मे **  
शिष्यस्तेऽहं शाधि मां त्वां प्रपन्नम्।।2.7।।
