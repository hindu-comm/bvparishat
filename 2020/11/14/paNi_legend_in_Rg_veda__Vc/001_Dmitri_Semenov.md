paNi is mentioned several times in Rigveda.

It can be translated as "niggard, miser" as in 4.25.7, 1.33.3. But in other hymns it means some entity(-ies) which is/are niggardly, but a more specific ones who  

confine cows (1.32.11) or retains waters. Natural phenomena it is not.

  

Best,  

 Dmitri.
