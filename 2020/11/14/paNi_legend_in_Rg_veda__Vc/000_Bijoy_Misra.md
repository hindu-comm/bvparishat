Dear friends,

Happy Diwali.  

Though our reconstruction efforts of India culture, we have a small group studying

ऋग् वेद in the original संहिता form, compiled by Swami Dayananda Saraswati of

Arya Samaj. The book's publication date reads Vikram Samvat 2010. We manage  

to interpret two or three सूक्त s in our three hour weekly sittings.
We take help of

the Sanskrit commentary by Sayana and the Hindi translation by SriRama Sharma

when we stumble. We struggle till we may relate the lyric to possible natural

phenomena as typical of the geography of the poets' residence. We may gain speed

after we get the flow and the use of the language. The use of upasarga as a separate

word is new and we learn to transpose as we move. We estimate that it may take us

five years to complete the reading.  

  

In the first Mandala sukta 33 there is a reference to पणि, who apparently causes  

water shortage. He precedes वृत्र who causes dark clouds and no rain.
The sukta  

is an invocation to इन्द्र who arrives to destroy वृत्र thus letting rains to come down

and water to flow.

  

The question is if there is any literary reference to पणि in the literature. I will

appreciate help or suggestion from the Veda scholars.  

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
