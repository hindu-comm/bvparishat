Dear Megh,

I think this is in the right direction. A trader cleans up the goods.  

That would make it a generic metaphor than a human metaphor.

("Spring is like a trade show that closes down in the summer like a tradesman moves out with his goods!)  

We will keep an eye.

(Mobile markets are popular in the Indian countryside, possibly elsewhere!)  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
