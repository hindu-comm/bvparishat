Dear Dr Shastry,

I admire the extensive reference post. My principal difficulty in translations has been an

assumption that a spoken word is supposed to have multiple meanings.
This is a fallacy.

A given neurological sound has a pre-formed biological meaning. So forms a word.

The same word can be applied in different contexts to convey different local meanings.  

The ज्ञान remains the same. The words are conceptual and not literal.
There could be a variety

of अर्थ as the context may demand, but there is convergence to the concept. This can

be experimented very simply through our common speech. Why the brain uses metaphors

in expressing ideas is a good question. "the seed is the father of a tree!" has little literal

meaning, but is conceptually understandable.

  

After reading through your good references, I continue to think that पण is an old aboriginal

word to signify goods brought to an area for trade. Then it becomes पणि to signify the person

who travels with the trade. Mobile trade fairs could be an ancient human custom run by

individuals making a living through trade. Such people anywhere in the world are tough.

There come in different shades, but there is always an intent to make the maximum profit.

This could be due to seasonality of trade or to maintain the price of the goods.

  

I appreciate the help. BVP is my teacher, I am a self-learner.
Sometimes I do find that

the interpretations proposed don't tally with the people, culture or the geography. Let me

struggle to learn more as I proceed.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
