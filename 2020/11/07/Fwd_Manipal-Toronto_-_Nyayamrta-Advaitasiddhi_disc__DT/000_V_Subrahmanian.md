Namaste

  

Forwarding the below mail on this topic. The details of the program are available in the mail, in both its parts. Pl. read the mail completely, till the end.

  

As of now I am told the Nyayamruta part is getting over this week. The corresponding Advaita Siddhi part is yet to commence, on 13th (Friday) Nov 2020, as per the schedule. See the zoom link in the mail below. Thus the two texts will be taught in parts, in sequence.

  

Kindly forward the message to all relevant, interested institutions/persons.

  

I request someone to identify the source where the so far completed Nyayamruta talks are uploaded and notify the same in this forum. That will help those who have missed those talks live.

  

warm regards

**Subject:** Nyāyāmṛta/Advaitasiddhi Introduction by Sri Vidyashreeshatirtha on Saturday, Sept. 19



Hi everyone,



Thank you for your interest in the Nyāyāmṛta/Advaitasiddhi lectures by Sri Vidyashreeshatirtha (formerly known as Prahladacharya) and Sri Mani Dravid Sastrigal. I am writing with the Zoom link (please see below) for the first lecture, which will take place on **Saturday, Sept. 19**, and with more information.



We will begin on **Saturday, Sept. 19 (10AM EST/ 7:30PM IST)** with a general introduction to both texts by Sri Vidyashreeshatirtha. In all subsequent weeks, lectures will take place on *both* Fridays and Saturdays at 10AM EST/ 7:30 PM IST. Each lecture will be for two hours. Sri Vidyashreeshatirtha and Sri Mani Dravid Sastrigal have kindly agreed to give seven weeks of lectures each, with Sri Vidyashreeshatirtha giving the first set of lectures and Sri Mani Dravid Sastrigal giving the second set of lectures. All lectures will be in Sanskrit. Sri Vidyashreeshatirtha and Sri Mani Dravid Sastrigal will start at the beginning of the Nyāyāmṛta and the Advaitasiddhi.



We ask that you keep your video off and audio mute. Only the pandits will speak during the lectures, but please email me questions in Sanskrit after each lecture, and I can forward these to the pandits. They will respond to these questions in the subsequent lecture.



Here is a dropbox folder containing files of both texts with commentaries:

We are very excited about this collaboration between the University of Toronto and Manipal University and extremely grateful to Sri Vidyashreeshatirtha and Sri Mani Dravid Sastrigal for this opportunity.



Thank you,

Ajay
