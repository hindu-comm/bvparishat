Dear friends,

First my gratitude to many of you and the list in general in helping me in carrying on

with the curiosity of understanding India's cultural history from my limited perspective.

While we have woven a story, there are considerable gaps and most dates might need  

revision in time. We are trying to present what we have found to serve the teachers,  

students and researchers worldwide through Facebook. We have just released a site

<https://www.facebook.com/Evolution-of-Indian-Culture-An-IDC-Project-107749391111922/?ref=page_internal>  

  

Summary papers will be posted at the site every week for the next six months.

We go from pre-history to 1947AD through seven periods previously defined by us.

<https://www.indiadiscoverycenter.org> Each period would have six tracks:  

Geography and People, Art and Culture, Language and Literature, Philosophy and  

Religion, Science and Technology, and Economy and Politics. Video lectures  

will be done in 2021 Fall and we return to seminars on current India in 2022.  

  

I request all scholars to visit the site and provide feedback. We consider ourselves

as students of Indian origin who look at their home from a distant land. While our  

early efforts were directed for the Middle and High school students in the US, we feel

that objective knowledge on India would be useful to all students in the world.   

  

We would be most obliged to receive information that we may be missing.
All  

comments are welcome. We have a separate project called Virtual India that  

will deal with artefacts, images, citations and manuscripts. I will write about it later.

  

We have six editors working on the site including me. Dr Krishnakali Dasgupta,  

a young geneticist from New York University is the site administrator.
All are listed  

at the site. We will answer all queries through the site. I can help with any general

educational queries through posts or privately.  

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra  

Boston, US
