A very disturbing topic indeed!

  

They are aspects of the unmanifest.

Why compare?

Every child assumes his parents to be the best.

  

And then the can of worms opens.

Is Devi any less than Vishnu? Or less than Shiva? There is no end. It is like asking which teacher is the best, in a school. Not realizing that learning is the best, and all teachers are just agents.

  

Both are forms. And beyond forms, they are the same, as are other 'forms'.

The Lomash Rishi episode makes it clear, I think.

Where Vishnu and Shiva in the form of young brahmachari and lomash tell Indra that not only are there multiple Indras, there are multiple Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Even they are not supreme.

  

Sorry for unsolicited rambling.

  

  

Thanks,
