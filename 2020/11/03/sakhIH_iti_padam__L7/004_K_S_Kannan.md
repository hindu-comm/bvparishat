Prof.s Korada and Deshpande (and of course, Vishvas ji and Hegde ji)

have raised an important issue.

  

The problem, however, is perhaps eternal:

Who has surveyed "all the usages"? And who can? :

*mahān śabdasya viṣayaḥ* ! - as per Patanjali himself!  

  

Could the question then apply to Patanjali himself?

(And indeed even to Panini for that matter, theoretically speaking?)  

How exactly did he ensure \**vacanti* was indeed used nowhere?

What literature could he be unaware of  

that we, today, are perhaps aware of if there is indeed any such?  

(Or should we leave out of account  

all post-Patanjali literature perhaps?)  

  

And how about "lost" literature,

the enormity of which he himself clearly indicates?

  

The caveat of "*anabhidhānāt*" looms large enough  

in the writings of Charudeva Sastri also.  

  

Has anybody made a list/study of **words** (bases/finished forms)**  
**

**that can be authentically deduced from Panini,**

**but have never so far been sighted/attested** in the available literature

(grammatical/otherwise)?

Or is it just worth not attempting  

as it may tend to infinity?

  

Has tradition taken any stand in this regard?

Have modern linguists covered/attempted an answer to this?

  

(Even at a technical level, the number of *pratyāhāra*-s, for example,  

that can be generated is far more than the ones actually utilised/needed.

Does it hint then at Panini's bountiful "generosity" to attempt  

accommodation/creation of possible new words/forms  

possibly required in posterity?)
