मताध्वरे तुहोतारोनेतारःपशवःप्रजाः।  
मद्यंघृतंधनंद्रव्यं स्वाहाहाहाध्वनिस्तथा।।  

  

In this sacrifice of votes, the politicians are the priests, the people are the sacrificial offerings, alcohol is the clarified butter, money is the liquid, and public outcry is the mantra.

  

(Rough Translation)

  

Best,

Kushagra
