नमो नमः ।

Kindly specify which anukramani of Rgveda you are referring to. The most celebrated anukramani of RV is the Sarvanukramani and it is ascribed to Katyayana. Anuvakanukramani is believed to have been composed by Shaunaka. Tradition gives us 7 different anukramani-s of Rgveda. All of them are not available though.
