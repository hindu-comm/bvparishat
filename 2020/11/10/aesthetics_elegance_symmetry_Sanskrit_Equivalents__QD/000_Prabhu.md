Seeking the vidvAn-s' opinionregarding closest Sanskrit words/phrasesfor the following:

"aesthetics" from*aisthetikos*,"aesthetic, sensitive, sentient, pertaining to sense perception"

"elegant" 
[beauty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty "Beauty")that shows unusual[effectiveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effectiveness "Effectiveness")and[simplicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicity "Simplicity").

"symmetry" from*symmetria*"agreement in dimensions, due proportion, arrangement"

(all from wikipedia)  

  

I would be like to use the appropriate/closeSanskritequivalents in the context of an exposition involving mathematics and science.

Such as "an elegant proof", "aesthetic judgement", "deep symmetries" etc

  

Looking up a few online dictionaries I see:

  

Aesthetics : \*रुचिविञ्जानम्।  

(Borooah)

  

Elegancy  

Elegance, s. चारुता, सौन्दर्य्यं, विनीतत्वं, विलासः, लावण्यं,  
शोभा, लालित्यं; ‘of form,’ रूपलावण्यं; ‘of speech,’ वाग्विलासः.  

(MW dictionary)

  

Symmetry

सुविभक्तता  

सम्मा, ...

(Spoken Sanskrit)

  

I have a strong hunch that in our lakShaNashAstra-s more appropriate/close equivalents arethere.

  

Regards

Prabhu
