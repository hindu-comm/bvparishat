Here is a YouTube link for my 10 lecturers on the Manuscriptology and Textual criticism , delivered at the Central Sanskrit University,
Ganganath Jha campus, Prayagraj ( November 1 to 10, 2020 ).

In some of the lectures the audio quality is not good enough, but my ppt.file will make the point clear.  
Will be happy and obliged by your comments.
