Sushri Rucha Kelkarji,

Jai Shri Ram!

\<I am not a Jyotisha, but wondering if this can be a neech bhang yoga, thus nullifying or reducing inauspicious results. \>

The "conjunction" is going to take place on December 21, 2020 when both Jupiter and Saturn will be in (so called sayana) Kumbha Rashi!! So technically speaking, there is no "Neeacha" Jupiter and therefore no neecha-bhanga either!

However, Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis, whether so called sayana or so called niraayana---whatever the Ayanamsha----are just twelve imaginary equal divisions of an imaginary circle known as ecliptic!  

Astronomically, these divisions do not have any existence! In the so called *niraayana* rashichakra, there is further confusion as to whether it has to be the Surya Siddhanta Rashi or Aryabhatiya Rashi or Grahalaghava Rashi or Makranda Rashi or Vakya Pnachanga Rashi or Lahiri Rashi or Ramana Rashi or Kharegat Rashi or Fagan Rashi or Tilaka (Raivata-Paksha) Rashi or K P Rashi and so on! Thus it is confusion worse confounded!

Any astronomical ephemeris of any observatory the world over----including the Indian Astronomical Ephemeris---- never gives the position of any planet, including the sun and the moon or Rahu, vis-a-vis Mesha etc. Rashis, whether sayana or nirayana, simply because astronomically there are no such divisions!

And that is why we do not find any Mesha, Vrsiha etc. rashis in any of the Vedas or the Vedangas either---simply because they are non-existent in reality!

***Rashis or Greek constellations?***

As a matter of fact, Aries etc. astrological signs are names of Greek constellations originally, which got "converted" into the former. This has been explained beautifully by the well known astronomer Jean Meeus in his "Mathematical Astronomy Morsels" as to how the "Vernal Equinox" became the "First Point of Aries" as it "regressed" from (the initial Point of) Aries to Pisces constellation in -67 (68 BCE). (Attachment Meeus-I and II).

When these very Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis came to India,the month of Vedic Madhava became Mesha and so on. And that got reflected in all the Puranas and the siddhantas!  

And the "First Point of Aries" became known as *Meshaaraambha Bindu* मेषारम्भ बिन्दु in Indian astronomy!

But as is common knowledge, no constellation is equal to another and in fact there are 88 constellations (and not just the twelve divisions!) as per IAU!

Now that the Vernal Equinox these days is in rapt conjunction with Beta Pegassi (*Purva-Bhadra-II*) star, so the Rashi-chakra (the constellational belt actually) must start from Pubha-II (and not Ashvini). 

Nakshatras are supposed to have started from Krittika at the time of the Vedanga Jyotisha or Shatapatha Brahmana or the Atharva Veda etc. as the VE was then in Krittika division.

***Astrology vis-a-vis Mesha etc. Rashis!***

Astrological predictions prove correct only because of two reasons:

1\. Statistically, there are fifty-fifty chances for any prediction to prove correct or wrong!

2\. If any astrological predictions are correct more than 50 per cent, some even claim 70 per cent or more accuracy, it is certainly not the delineation of Mangal or Shani etc. vis-a-vis Mesha etc. rashis but the sixth sense, usually known as intuition of the concerned astrologer!
And it is just because of His grace!

My maternal grandfather used to make correct predictions literally from absolutely incorrect data---horoscopes prepared from panchangas of Makaranda, and through Yogini Dasha Bhuktis, that too without any Bhukta-Bhogya! But then he would spend maximum of his time in "*sadhana*" and do "*nishkaama*" seva!

May be that was the secret of his successful predictions!

***Sun is a star and does not enter or leave any Rashi!***

I am reminded of the "bestseller" Sun Signs by Linda Goodman! It sold literally millions of copies!

And the most ironic part is that the sun being a star does not "move" and thus enter any sign! On the other hand, it is the earth that enters some imaginary Rashi like Mesha, Vrisha etc., and that very movement is transposed to the sun by almost exactly 180 degrees! Thus when we say that the sun has entered (sayana) Makar Rashi on December 21/22, what we are saying actually is that the earth has actually entered Karka (and not "Makara" Rashi) division on almost that date and time.  
That means that Linda Goodman should have actually delineated "Earth Signs", since we all reside on the earth and not on the sun and the results for Capricorn sun should have actually been for Cancer earth and so on!

***COVID-19 is still raging!***

I also recall that some time back, there was a lot of excitement about a "young astrologer" having predicted the pandemic Covid-19 much before it swept the world. But I also recall that he had claimed that it would end in May 2020!

Though it is already more than six month since May 2020, but the pandemic is on the increase instead of decrease!

***There can never be any actual conjunctions or oppositions etc. of two bodies***

The parting short is that there can never be any "conjunction" of two bodies least of all planets!

In the present case, Jupiter is at a distance of about 778,300,000 kilometers from the sun (compared to earth) whereas Saturn is away by 1,427,000,000 kilometers! The difference---(actually the distance!) between the two bodiesis a whopping 648,700,00 kilometers!

Thus they can never be "conjunct" one another. This will also be clear
from the "Photo" attached by Shri Venkatesh Murthy, which is being enclosed for ready reference.

Just my two cents!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
