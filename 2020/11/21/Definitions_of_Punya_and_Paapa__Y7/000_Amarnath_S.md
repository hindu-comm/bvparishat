Namaste to all the scholars in this group,

  

  We use the terms Punya and Paapa. Roughly translated as virtue/merit and sin.

  

  Would like to know which pramaanaas give definitions of these terms Punya and Paapa, what those definitions are, and whether there are any differences between the Advaita, Vishishtadvaita and Dvaita interpretations of these definitions.

  

Thanks and Regards

\- amar
