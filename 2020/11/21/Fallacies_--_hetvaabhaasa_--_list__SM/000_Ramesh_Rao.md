Learned folks,

  

Is there a list of logical fallacies (hetvaabhaasa) in the Indian vaada tradition akin to the long list of fallacies we have in the Western tradition?

  

For example, we see here the list of fallacies:<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies>

  

Or a list of the 21 common fallacies, here:<https://www.lindsey.edu/academics/img/writing-center-pdfs/introduction-fallacies.pdf>

  

If anyone has a list of such fallacies identifiedin the Indian vaada/tarka tradition, would you please share it with me?

  

I do have Tripathi's book on Vaada, but the list of fallacies identified there is quite short -- about five or six.

  

Thank you.

  

Ramesh Rao
