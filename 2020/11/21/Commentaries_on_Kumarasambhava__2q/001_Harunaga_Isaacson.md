There are two editions (as far as I know) of Vallabhadeva's commentary. I don't see scans of either

on [archive.org](http://archive.org). I am not sure if it is ok to share wetransfer links of these editions, which may still (I am not sure about this either) be obtainable from their original publishers, in this group.
