Namaste,

  

I came to know that there are around 60 commentaries on the Kumarasambhava and amongst the 30 identified ones, some have been published -

  

1\. Panjika of Vallabhadeva

2\. Sanjiivani of Mallinatha

3\. Prakashika of Arunagiri

4\. Shishuhitaishini of Chaaritravardhana

5\. Vivarana of Narayana

6\. Diipika of Daxinaavartanaatha

7\. Vidyaamaadhaviiya

  

Apart from Mallinatha, I am not able to find any of the others on the public domain. And one can consider one's study complete only by study of several commentaries. Any pointers to the above commentaries on the interwebs or elsewhere will be appreciated greatly.

  

Thanks and Regards,

Pooja
