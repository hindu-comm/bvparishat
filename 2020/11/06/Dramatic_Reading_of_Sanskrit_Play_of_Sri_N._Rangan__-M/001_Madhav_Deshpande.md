Dear Subrahmanian Ji,

  

  Thanks for sharing this video of drama reading. In Marathi, this is called Nāṭya-Vācan, are in my Pune days there used to be annual competitions of Nāṭya-Vācan for different languages including Sanskrit, and I assume this is continuing today. In our group of Marathi families here in California, we occasionally do this for Marathi plays, and the Maharashtra Mandal of Bay Area holds annual competitions of on stage drama presentations.
