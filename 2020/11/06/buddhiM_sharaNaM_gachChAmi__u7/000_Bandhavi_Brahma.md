Namaskar,

  

During recent increased work pressure, inspired by reading the amazing poems of scholars on BVP digest I got a small inspiration and wrote one आर्या verse. Hope to get feedback from scholars \_/\\\_

  

आश्रया का काऽत्र भोः

निवृत्तये त्वं प्रवर्तयेथाः ।

वृत्तीनां हि चित्तस्य

मम बुद्धिं शरणं गच्छामि ॥

  

(I think first line can also be आश्रया त्वैकाऽत्र भोः)  

  

Pranam,

Bandhavi
