pariṣade namaḥ pāriṣadbhyonamaḥ

  

Dear Rameshji,

  

As far as I can recognize, this passage is of the Āpastambakalpa from theTaittirīya śākhā of the Kṛṣṇayajurveda with the commentary of Haradatta. This indicates that this is specific for this śākhā only; other śākhās have their own ritual styles and may not have historically used this particular mantra. For reference, seeŚrīharadattamiśravirachitavyākhyāsahitaḥ Ekāgnikāṇḍaḥ (Sudarshan Sharma eds., SVV University, Tirupati, 2010), pp. 109.

  

The passage is for the monthly sraddha homa performed on amavasya. As you may know, the sraddha is three-layered, so to speak: it offers to three generations: the father, the grandfather, and the great-grandfather. So here, we see six mantras (three sets of two āhutis), each set directed at those three respectively. I will follow Haradatta's opinion in translating to English. First, I will translate into prose to give you a sense of the meaning, and then I will translate literally.

  

The *first* one says: whatever my errant mother (i.e. unfaithful to her husband), overcome with forbidden lust, has committed (i.e. received another man's retas in her womb), may my father overpower/accept-as-his-own (*vṛṇktāṃ* is notoriously difficult to translate with the right modern sense) so that there is no intermixing of seeds (of my father and another man). Haradatta adds that even good women (*sādhvīnāṃ api*) may fall into this by mental transgression (even by thinking about other men in an inappropriate manner, *mānasa-vyabhicāra-sambhavāt*). So, this havis that I am offering - may that not sever me from my 'correct' lineage - (*even if* I myself am actually begotten by another man) may my havis reach my ritual/formal father - this offering to so-and-so (insert father's name)svāhā.

  

The *second* one adds: whatever (waters) stand still (Haradatta says: like a pond), or flow rapidly (Haradatta says: like a river), or otherwise moistening or irrigating (like a nearby waterbody makes the land around it ripe for vegetation; Haradatta says:*kūlādikaṃ ārdrapradeṣaṃ ghnanti ityarthaḥ*), by means of those waters of the world, I separate (Haradatta says: *vyavahitaṃ karomi*) other men (other fathers) from *my* father (so that they are not given a share of the havis in this *karma*) - this offering to so-and-so (insert father's name) svāhā. Haradatta respectfully adds:*śiṣṭaṃ gatam*.

  

The *third* is identical to the first, except with "grandmother" and "grandfather".

  

The *fourth* one says: by means of the mountains, the lands on the earth are separated, by means of the surrounding directions and the nadir, I separate my grandfather from all the other men - this offering to so-and-so (insert grandfather father's name) svāhā.

  

The *fifth* is identical to the first, except with "great-grandmother" and "great-grandfather".

  

The *sixth* one says: by means of the seasons, the ahorātras (pl.), the sandhis (i.e. sandhyas, but also possibly the parvas), the half-months, and the months, I separate my great-grandfather from all the other men - this offering to so-and-so (insert great-grandfather's name) svāhā.

  

The final translation would be like this— "What my mother, overcome with lust, being unfaithful, has committed, may my father overpower that retas; may all others be deprived \[of this offering\]; to the father, *svāhā*. \[By means of the waters\] that stand, that flow, or surround, everywhere in this world, I separate my father from all other men; to the father, *svāhā*. Whatever my grandmother, overcome with lust, being unfaithful, has committed, may my grandfather overpower that retas; may all others be deprived \[of this offering\]; to the grandfather, *svāhā*. As the earth is separated by mountains, lands, the directions and the nadir, I separate my grandfather from all other men; to the grandfather, *svāhā*. Whatever my great-grandmother, overcome with lust, being unfaithful, has committed, may my great-grandfather overpower that retas; may all others be deprived \[of this offering\]; to the great-grandfather, *svāhā*. As the seasons, the days and nights, the twilights, the half-months, and the months are separated, I separate my great-grandfather from all other men; to the great-grandfather, *svāhā.*"

  

I hope this helps.
