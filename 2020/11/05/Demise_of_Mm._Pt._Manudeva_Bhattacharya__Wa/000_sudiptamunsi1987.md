Dear List Members,

  

With an extremely heavy heart I report the saddest demise of Mahāmahopādhyāya Vyākaraṇakeśarī Śāstrārthamahārtha Paṇḍitamārtaṇḍa Dr. Manudeva Bhattacharya (28.06.1946-05.11.2020) of Varanasi earlier today.

  

My deepest reverence to his departed soul and condolences to his bereaved family.

  

Best regards,

Yours sincerely

  

Sudipta Munsi
