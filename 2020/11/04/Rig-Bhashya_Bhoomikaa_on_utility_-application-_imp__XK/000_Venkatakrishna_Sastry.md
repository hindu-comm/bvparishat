Namaste





The deliberation on use of ' Svaras' and the criticality- impact- interpretation for 'Veda- Vedanga- Vedanta ' studies has a long history.



Attached is a reference from Acharya Madhva on this topic , from Rig-Bhashya-Bhoomikaa.



My question/s: What is the essential communication from the above assertion for veda- artha jnana ?

How much of this guidance differs on the guidelines in Sayana Bhashyaa?

Can I be helped and be pointed to any school/ gurukul / Master who are currently using this guidance to train the next generation scholars of 'Veda- Vedanga- Vedanta ' ? pl.



Much obliged for help.

\[ Note : Dismissal of traditional school over preference to colonial views, over ride of Historical interpretation of texts of Veda-Vedanga- Vedanta is not going to resolve the issue here.\].



Regards
