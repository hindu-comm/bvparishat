Thank you very much Sri Veeranarayanacharya Mahodaya for your support.

I have attested a work,that I have brought into editable/searchable version , just for yourreference

Similarly , I have brought all works of Sri Madhvacharya, Padmanabha Tirtha,JayaTirtha,Vadiraja Tirtha,Raghavendra Tirtha,Satyanatha Tirtha into editable/searchable version

I have brought in the 25 Tippani's of SrimannyayaSudha also into editable/searchable version.

I require help in proofreading these works that I have brought into editable versions and rectify the errors in the same.

Being a student and proficient of computerscience, I can take care of developing and building the website on my own, I just need help in proofreading these editable versions and rectifying errors in the same

  

I am very thankful for your support in this work of mine.

  

Thanks and Regards
