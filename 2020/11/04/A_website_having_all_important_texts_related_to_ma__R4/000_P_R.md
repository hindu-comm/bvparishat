Namaste all

I am creating a blog/ website related to mAdhva Philosophy, where all granthas, Tika, Tippanis are available for all for free, in both Pdf format as well as searchable version. It will be somewhat similar to Advaita Sharadha website.

  

Just to give an example,

Gita Bhashya of Madhvacharya will have Moola Bhashya, prachina tika and Jayatirtha muni's Tika with almost 7-8 Tippanis on it, in pdf format as well as searchable version

  

I have already brought in many works in editable versions related to dvaita vedanta and if anyone wishes to help me with this work, please let me know.

  

As of now, \*Srimannyayasudha\* grantha of Jayatirtha muni, A tika on Anuvyakhyana of Madhvacharya along with 22 Tippanis(commentaries) is brought in editable/ searchable format. Also, the Brahmasutra Bhashya of Madhvacharya with 3 Tikas and 10 Tippanis (commentaries) on Tatva Prakashika, is brought in editable / searchable format

  

As I am doing this all alone, I need guidance from scholars for this.

So if anyone is willing to help me out with this, please let me know by sending a mail to me.

I would be very grateful to them, to give me an opportunity to work with them.

  

Thanks and Regards

Pradyumna R
