Namaste all

I am creating a blog/ website related to mAdhva Philosophy, where all granthas, Tika, Tippanis are available for all for free, in both Pdf format as well as searchable version. It will be somewhat similar to Advaita Sharadha website.

  

Just to give an example,

Gita Bhashya of Madhvacharya will have Moola Bhashya, prachina tika and Jayatirtha muni's Tika with almost 7-8 Tippanis on it, in pdf format as well as searchable version

  

I have already brought in many works in editable version related to dvaita vedanta and if anyone wishes to help me with this work, please let me know.
