Thank you very much Dr Kannan for the melodious Audios.

  

It would indeed be very nice for some of us if you can kindly give English meaning for each verse. Your English is normally adorned with brevity and rich import.

  

I personally need for प्रात:स्मरणम् and ललितापंचकम्.

  

With warm Regards,

-Ashok Gudsoorkar
