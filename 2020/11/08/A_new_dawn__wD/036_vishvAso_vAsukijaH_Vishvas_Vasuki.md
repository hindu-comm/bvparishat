While people might think that US is incompetent - it is not. Everything is going according to plan (laid a long time ago, with the systematic dismantling of the real afghAn army - <https://www.brownpundits.com/2021/08/15/americas-brilliant-strategy-in-afghanistan/>
). And the president in charge does not really matter (unless it was someone like Tulsi, who was promptly dispatched to obscurity).

  

Vis a vis India,<https://threader.app/thread/1430184519345184772> lays it out quite well -

  
"India is too big to exist, too unreliable to be an ally - a colonial society rapidly trying to indigenise. A billion plus people not just passively consuming western goods but also trying to compete with the West is a terrifying idea. 4/n.A semi-colonial barely functional Nehruvian behemoth is borderline acceptable; atmanirbhar Bharat with a distinctive civilisational is certainly not. The *long term goal is balkanisation*. Russia, China, India need to be needled, the best possible way is unrest on their borders."  

  

This clear strategy (and the rather convincing drama) should only evoke our admiration. The distressing part should be lack of clarity on our end,and our relative lack of influence in USA(with most US hindus being "tools" in contrast withUSjews).
