Very nicely conveyed.  

  

I, for one, find Sanskrit verses in general rather elevating. Prof Deshpande's verses are also usually rather elevating. Sometimes, he tries a stab at humor, irony and related sentiments,. Perhaps he does it for variety. This too is very nice.  

  

Since Prof Deshpande writes a verse or two every day, it has become my habit to look to his posts for my daily Sanskrit. I hope he continues as he has been without let or hindrance.  

  

With best wishes to Prof Deshpande and all who enjoy Sanskrit poetry,
