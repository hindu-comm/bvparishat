Dr Deshpande had written in this forum on Oct 14th 2020: "More worried about the US elections and their outcomes for those of us living here in the US." {<https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/epglL68soB8/m/202IXvDwAQAJ>for context}.  

  

If writing the above is fine (which, in my view, it is), I am guessing it might be well within the respectful boundaries of, amongst other things, freedom of expression for some Indians (such as myself)—particularly those living in India—to be worried about "...US elections and their outcomesfor those of us living here..." in India, when decisions taken by the leader chosen by such an election*may* have some consequences for some Indians in India.  

  

Indeed some might be aware of some of the continuities in policy but that is precisely why'A New Dawn,' which stayed with me since I first read it, came to my mind.

  

Best,

Megh

  

I had written, in the same thread, the following: "An election in America is, frankly, and speaking as an Indian citizen, none of my business (generally speaking), other than when it begins to affect 1) the interests of my nation (including but not limited to its legitimate territorial sovereignty) and hence mine 2) global peaceful non-interfering co-existence (more generally speaking) \[not listing all reasons here\]."[](http://goog_2140126924)<https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/epglL68soB8/m/puGjUfF3CwAJ>
