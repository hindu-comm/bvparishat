I see which verse you are referring to. Yes, for Indian Americans like me, the election of Biden was a new dawn, compared to the hellof the Trumpera, but every dawn brings a new day, for better or worse. I am not contesting anyone else's right to express any view that they may hold about Biden, America or anything else for that matter. Best wishes,
