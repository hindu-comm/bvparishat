I think sometimes we think too much and come up with all kinds of theories. To me it seems clear that the USA has lost the war and it was decided the day USA made Pakistan an ally in this war. There is no grand plan behind it, just backstabbing by Pakistan is enough reason for this ignominious defeat.
