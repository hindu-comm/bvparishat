Dear Ajit Ji,

  

  Having voted in the US election, I am writing as a US citizen who writes Sanskrit poetry. What I am writing is pure political comedy, as far as I see it, and I thought some on this list would like to read these comic verses. Please let me know if this either offends some or is of no interest to anyone on this list. I will be happy to stop sharing these verses on this list. With best regards,

  

Madhav Deshpande
