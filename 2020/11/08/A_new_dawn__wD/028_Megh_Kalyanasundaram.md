I am not at all sure which post in this thread points toDr Deshpande's "Krishna verses".

  

Insofar as I have seen, and unless I have missed something, the Krishna verses from Dr Deshpande normally commence with "Continuing my Krishna verses". I did not see that in the post titled 'A new dawn' that is at the top of the thread to which this post belongs and which is part of the context for at least my posts in this thread.
