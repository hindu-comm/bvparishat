A new dawn has arrived

  

रात्रिर्गमिष्यति भविष्यति सुप्रभातं

भास्वानुदेष्यति हसिष्यति पङ्कजश्री: ।

इत्थं विचिन्तयति मे मनसि प्रसन्नं

नूत्नं दिनं समुदितं कमलालयेऽस्मिन् ।।

  

“This night will go and there will be a good morning. The sun will rise and the lotuses will bloom.” While my mind was wondering like this, a happy new day has arrived in this abode of Kamala.”
