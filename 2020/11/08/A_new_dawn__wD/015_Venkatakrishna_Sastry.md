Namaste



Prof. Deshpandes creative composiitons in two streams- one covering devotion (bhakti-kaavya) and one a ' pure political comedy ( per his description)' are both relevant and important for BVP team.



I think that the 'Samskrut Creative literature of Contemporary style is important for BVP team to take note of'. If Bharata proposed 'dasharupakas' ( and evolving to many upa-rupakas), and Samskruth Sahrudayas have enjoyed them, why is there a reservation or hesitation now ?! What is the need for invoking a victorian sense invoked ?? or puritan colonial conservatism ?? 



*** ***



We live and enjoy in PRESENT (vartamana - kaala-desha -parisara), even though we believe to be using a langauge of God's/ classica/ histoical/ spiritual/ religious- archaic !

Literature lives in contemporary society without constraint of nation and boundaries.



Imitating a well known composiiton, here is my own composiiton : (समाज = Human Cultured society समज = Asembly of Sheep)



छन्दोबद्धः जनोदन्तः समाजे समजान्वितम् । लोकवार्ता-दर्शनोत्थः श्लोको भवतु नान्यथा ॥



Let this expression of mine end up as a parody-poetry; and nothing beyond that; the words ,

 aroused in me by watching of the social events,

the expression emerging as an outpour naturally set to a rhythmic pattern, 

the theme covering the worldly news, 

addressed to the
people-events in society where people are behaving like
good-shepards (=managers of a flock of sheep),
