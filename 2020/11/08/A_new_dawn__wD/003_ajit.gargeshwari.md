I appreciate your poetry and versification. Does US Politics matter to people in India not much. I am not personally interested in any politics. US stand on Indian issues will remain the same irrespective of who the President is. George W. Bush and Barack Obama, the United States has demonstrated accommodation to India's core national interests and acknowledged outstanding concerns. You may say Joe Biden won but the race You cannot dismiss 7,08,12,803 or 47% of popular vote that's in favor of the current President. Are you Versifying as a person who has affiliation to a political party or a US citizen who knows Sanskrit
