The spectacle of the US Election in terms of the Mahabharata.

  

Is Trump not playing Duryodhan's card (The victims role) One needs to identify the others too. There are many Bhimshmas's, Shakuni's, Arjuns, etc. out there but will we find Krishna there? No, wonder Lokmanya Tilak in his Geetarahasyawrote that the Mahabharata is the only tale of victory; all the rest are that of tragedy. That is possibly what is in store for American politics.
