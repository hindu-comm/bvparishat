**Issues and Perspectives in Indology**

HowshouldIndian scholarscontribute to the generation ofa new Indologyinpartnership with their confreres in the globalarenain a manner whichis true to the spirit and substance ofIndia’srich, varied and living cultural heritage? What would be the appropriate epistemological underpinning of such a reconstructed*Bhārat-Vidyā*that could serveas a vehicle to understand India’s civilizational self?

Focusing on these questions,Indian Council for Cultural Relations, New Delhi in association with Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (BORI), Pune is organizing a Webinarto address some of themethodological,archaeological,historical, sociological, andenvironmentalissuesinvolved inunderstanding the complexities of Indian societywith particular attention to desiderata including the identification anduse of source materials, knowledge systems, and methodsof translation and interpretation. The objectives of the webinar are**(a)**to focus on contemporary value/relevance of Indological research**(b)**to take forward some major debates in Indology, and**(c)**to stress inter-disciplinary potential of Indology.
