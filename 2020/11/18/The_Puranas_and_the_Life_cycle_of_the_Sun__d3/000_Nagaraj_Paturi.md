Hello everybody,



A few weeks back, I made a presentation on “The Puranas and the Life cycle of the Sun” at a webinar hosted by IHAR (Indian History Awareness and Research) Bharat. Modern science views the Sun as a low-mass star having a five-stage life: Birth, Youth, the current Mature stage, Red Giant and White Dwarf stages. The Puranas, incredibly, have passages that describe each of these stages. These are a combination of stories (allegory) and outright descriptions.



The 50-minute presentation has been uploaded to YouTube and can be accessed here:

For those who would like a sampler, there is an 8-minute segment about the Red Giant stage of the Sun, the Samvartakaditya, and can be found here:

The material is based on my book, “From the Beginning of Time,” which was published a little over a month ago. A short video about the book can be found here:

A big thanks to Hari ji and Dr. Nagaraj Paturi ji for their help in promoting the book.





Cheers

**Ganesh**
