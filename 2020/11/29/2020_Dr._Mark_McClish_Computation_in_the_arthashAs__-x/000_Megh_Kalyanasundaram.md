**Abstract**: "The*Arthaśāstra**of Kauṭilya*(**ca. first century BCE**-third century CE) is the most important source on state administration from classical India. Its far-ranging instructions on state activities depict an ideal-typical kingdom heavily reliant on computation, particularly with respect to state finances. Nevertheless, computational practices themselves are little discussed, and no general study of them in the*Arthaśāstra*yet exists. This chapter is a primarily philological effort to frame an initial inquiry into such practices in the text through a study of the terms through which computation is expressed or implied. After introducing the*Arthaśāstra*, I examine: 1. various means of assigning value as laid out in the text (including an overview of mensuration in the*Arthaśāstra*); 2. some of the most prevalent numerical operations and procedures; 3. the use of these in a few examples of state activities; and 4. how computation was conceived among other evaluative activities." \[Emphasis added\]
