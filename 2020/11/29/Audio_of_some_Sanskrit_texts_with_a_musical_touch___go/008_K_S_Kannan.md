Thank you for your kind words  

*Śrīyuta*-s Viswanatha, Gudsurkar, and Subramanian!

Thank you for noticing the *sūkṣma*-s!  

  

We are trying our best to give the best possible text in the best possible manner.

In the *Lakṣmyaṣṭottara*, for example, we noticed that there was some *pāṭha-doṣa* in the text we had chosen,

and so promptly removed it (even though there were words of appreciation already),

and redid the whole thing. A good deal of time and effort is invested in each improvement.

  

Thank you once again.

  

KSKannan
