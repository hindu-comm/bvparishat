Very kind of you Prabhu-ji to have shown appreciation!

Thank you for your sensitivity and sensibility!

  

You are welcome to give any hints for further improvement.

They can help future recordings.  

  

Much of what is already available in the internet has many errors

in text as well as pronunciation. So we thought we must take some remedial steps.

But the question remains as to how many can indeed recognise the difference.

  

Thanks once again.
