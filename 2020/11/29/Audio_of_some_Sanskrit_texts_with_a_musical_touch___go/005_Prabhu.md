Dr Kannan mahodaya,

I watched and listened to several videos under:

<https://www.youtube.com/c/KannanMeera/videos>

Such a perfect rendition of the stotra-s with flawless text accompanying!

While listening to the hayagrIva stuti (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQXJqsmgKsE>),  

I observed, for example in the verse 28, how "श" and "ष" are pronounced distinguishably which is a rarity nowadays.

  

Regards

Prabhu
