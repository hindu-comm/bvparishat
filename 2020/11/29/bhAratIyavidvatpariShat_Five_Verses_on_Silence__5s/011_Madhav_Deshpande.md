Dear Kushagra Ji,

  

  Nice verses. They remind me of the exercises my students used to do in their beginning Sanskrit classes. When they were introduced to the prefixes सु and कु, some of them wrote sentences like: सुकवय: सुकविभि: मोदन्ते । कुकवय: कुकविभि: मोदन्ते । सुकवय: कुकविभि: खिद्यन्ते । कुकवय: सुकविभि: खिद्यन्ते । etc.

  With best wishes,
