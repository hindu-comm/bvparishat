All river names are very apt names for a cow. For example, Ganga, Yamuna, Sarasvati, Kaveri, Narmada, Sindhu, Godavari, Tungabhadra, etc.

In the Vedas, cows are symbols for the flow of knowledge and light as well. So river names are excellent for cows. And it also feels very affectionate.

Also names of Vedic chandases are very appropriate. Such as Gayatri, Jagati, Shakvari, Brihati, etc. Cows have been used as symbols for these chandases in the Vedas.

Punyakoti is another beautiful name. It appears in the old Kannada folk song "*Govina**hāḍu*" meaning "Cow's Song". The first stanza of that song has a few names of cows: Gange, Gauri, Tungabhadre, Punyakoti.  

The story of the song is that the cow Punyakoti when called by the cowherd for milking, first wants to go and feed her calf. On the way, she is interrupted by a tiger who is ready to jump on her and rip her to pieces. She manages to calm the tiger and promises to return after feeding her hungry calf. She keeps her promise and comes back to the tiger and offers herself as his food - "Take these juicy joints, and meat and the warm blood from my heart. Eat all this and be happy." The tiger is filled with remorse and grief over the utter selflessness of the cow, and in the end instead of killing her, he jumps from a cliff and dies.Here's a nice animation of the song:
