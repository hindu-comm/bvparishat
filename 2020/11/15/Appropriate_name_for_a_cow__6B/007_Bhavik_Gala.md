Namovah,  

  

Thank you Kushagra Aniket Ji for sharing the link to dictionaries and उ॒ज्ज्व॒लः Ji for sharing the meanings.  

Thank you Bharat Chandra Dasa Ji, Abhiram Ji, and Dr. K.S.Kannan Ji for sharing some beautiful names.  

Thank you Nityananda Ji for sharing the Sahasranama stotram.  

  

These are great names and I will be referring them in future. For now, I have settled on the name विश्वंभरा. Right from the first time I read this name in Shri Parvati Sahasranama stotram and Shri Lakshmi Sahasranama stotram, I was drawn towards it and felt that it was apt for a cow as well. But I did not know its meaning and wanted to confirm with you all. Thank you so much.  

  

Regards,

Bhavik N Gala
