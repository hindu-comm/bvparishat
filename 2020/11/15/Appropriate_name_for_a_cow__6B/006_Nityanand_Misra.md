Namaste

  

One of the richest sources for naming cows is the Gosahasranamastotram composed by Svami Ramabhadracharya. This stotra gives 1,000 names of the Gomata in 108 verses (107 anushtups and one 1 arya).

  

There are many names specific to cows like चारुखुरा ("she with lovely hoofs"), चारुशृङ्गी ("she with attractive horns"), महापुच्छा ("she with a majestic tail"), गव्यदोग्ध्री ("she who yields gavyas") etc.

The entire stotra has been sung by Dr. Anjaneyulu Goli here: <https://archive.org/details/GOsahasranAmastotram>

  

Hope this helps

  

Thanks, Nityananda
