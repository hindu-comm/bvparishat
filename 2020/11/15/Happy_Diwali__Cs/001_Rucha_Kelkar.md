Namaskar to all the scholars of the group

  

Happy Diwali and a prosperous New Year to all the esteemed scholars!🙏

  

For me, being on this group, everyday is diwali. All the members spread light of our ancient scriptures in the form of beautiful poems, verses, melodious compositions, articles, etc; thus illuminating our lives, eliminating darkness of ignorance and grief.

  

Many thanks and regards
