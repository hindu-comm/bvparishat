The below excerpt might interest:  

  

Another man, not less useful, joined them soon after.  
Vaman Shivram Apte, the celebrated lexicographer had  
earned in his college career high repute as an accomplished scholar and immediately on passing his M. A.  
examination had been engaged temporarily as Head  
Master in a Mission School. He tried his best to get a  
very good post in the Educational Department. But  
such is the rigidity of red-tape, that he was offered the  
modest post of an assistant master in an Anglo-Vernacular school. When the founders of the New English  
School heard this, they at once approached Mr. Apte  
and secured his services for the school as its Superin-  
tendent. The choice was most appropriate. Mr. Apte  
fully justified his selection for the post by the diligent  
and thorough manner in which he discharged his duties.  
He had in him the school-master's instinct, which  
taken at its best means a strict but temperate sense of  
discipline, patience with ignorance, system in exposition,  
attention to minute details and a readiness to plod un-  
wearied through the dull monotony of school-life.
