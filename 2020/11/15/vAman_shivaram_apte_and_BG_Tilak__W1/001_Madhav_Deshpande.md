This same New English School was the highschool that I as well as my father attended. There werefive founding fathers of the New English School: Tilak, Agarkar, Gokhale, Namjoshi and Apte. I remember the portraits of these five hanging in my school. V.S. Apte also became the first principal of the Fergusson College. That was my undergraduate college, and my father worked there as a librarian. The brilliant V. S. Apte, however, passed away at the young age of 32, but his works survive.
