Thanks for sharing this well written piece on that stalwart of classical music, Telugu , Sanskrit and Kannada literatures.

  

In our adhyayana and adhyaapana of classical Telugu literature we hold him along with other such stalwarts of his generation , close to our hearts. He contributed numerous unique and trend setting analyses to the study of classical Telugu literature.

  

Annamacharya's kritis did not have traditionally handed down music composition. When the copper plates on which the kritis were inscribed were discovered in modern period, they were newly set to music. He was one of those who set some of the important kritis to music.
