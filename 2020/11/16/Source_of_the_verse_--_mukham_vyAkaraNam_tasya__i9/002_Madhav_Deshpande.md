The following verses cited by Dr. Korada

  

छन्दः पादौ तु वेदस्य हस्तौ कल्पो’थ पठ्यते ।

ज्योतिषामयनं चक्षुः निरुक्तं श्रोत्रमुच्यते ॥

शिक्षा घ्राणं तु वेदस्य मुखं व्याकरणं स्मृतम् ।

तस्मात् साङ्गमधीत्यैव ब्रह्मलोके महीयते ॥ 41,42

  

are given as part of the ऋक् शाखीय पाणिनीयशिक्षा included among the various versions collectively edited by Manomohan Ghosh, Universityof Calcutta, 1938, p. 43. On p. 75, Ghosh notes that these verses are found only in this one version of the पाणिनीयशिक्षा, and are possibly a late addition to this text from some unknown source.
