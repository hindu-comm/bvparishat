शब्दरूपसङ्ग्रहः

Śabdarūpasaṇgrahaḥ

By - Vyoma Linguistic Labs Foundation

 Based on popular demand, Vyoma presents a book for learning shabdas in a systematic and easy manner. There is a level-wise gradation of shabdas with most common shabdas being studied in the first level. This would keep the student’s attention and interest alive for a longer time. Though shabdas and their forms are available in many old and new books and net resources, the meaningful division of the nama-padas, on the base-ground of level of difficulty- grading from the most common ones to rarer and special shabdas, makes this book a unique attempt. This book is supported by an audio/video product. (<https://www.sanskritfromhome.in/?s=shabda>)
