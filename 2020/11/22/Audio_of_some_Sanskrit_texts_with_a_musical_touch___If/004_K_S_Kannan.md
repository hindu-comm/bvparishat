Meera and I are thankful to the kind words of  

Prof. Deshpande, Sri Krishna Kashyap, and Prof. RNIyengar.

  

The words of Prof. RNI have especial value

for he is not only a connoisseur of music,

but a musician himself, plus a musicologist of no mean order!

  

The unfortunate thing is that there are so many singings available on the web

of this highly nuanced text, but few do justice even to the bare text,

leave alone to the subtleties of the "Divine Pathos" (as so apty put by Prof. RNI).

  

It was the rampant ignorance of Sanskrit among singers  

(and the ensuant mispronunciations and odd word-splits galore),  

and their typical nonchalant attitude and lukewarm interest  

in the depiction of the *sāhitya* that roused us, Meera and I,  

to attempt some faithful renderings of some Sanskrit texts.

  

Our attempts would be amply repaid if others come forward to  

improve even upon what has been presented by us,  

and with even higher fidelity to the letter as well as the spirit of the  

many masterpieces of literature that our languages all abound in,

especially Sanskrit.

  

Thanks once again to all *sahr̥daya*-s who have been vocal in appreciation,

some openly, some in private, or ones who even just enjoyed these renderings in reticence :  

"जनस्य तूष्णीम्भवतोऽयमञ्जलिः" !

  

Suggestions for improvement are always welcome.

After all, these are first attempts by us in this direction.  

  

KSKannan
