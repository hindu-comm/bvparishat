The music is superb bringing out the divine pathos of the poem in Mukhaari. The intervening paintings add to the mood. Perhaps suitable references to the sources of the paintings would add to the archival value of the video.

  

Looking forward to hear more Bhairavi, Mukhaari, Kaanada,.... Neelaambari !
