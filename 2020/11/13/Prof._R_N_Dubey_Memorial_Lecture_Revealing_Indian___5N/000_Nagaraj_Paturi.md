**Abstract**

The concept of Indian Cultural Landscape, ICL, refers to a complex cultural mosaic and network of spatiality of time, temporality of space, sacrality of nature and overall, the encompassing manifestation of transcendence of man who since time immemorial is trying to make a strong bridge between conscious mind and superconscious divine. This way the interplay has been part of constant and continuous evolutionary drama between earthly Man and cosmic Nature, turning into various built-structures and traditions that maintained continuity-maintenance-transformation and changes, of course always keeping the essence of the past that processed and got transferred from one generation to another. Concept of cultural landscape has root in geographical thought and is commonly accepted as one of the best strategies to understand and project the vividness and commonality of landscape and culture that envisioned National Identity. This, Prof. Ram Nath Dubey (1896-1960) memorial lecture, in the purview of his proclamation to the French School lead by Paul Vidal de la Blache (1845-1918) and continued by his disciple Emmanuel de Mortone (1873-1955)—who served as Prof. Dubey’s teacher, is an attempt on the line of critical appraisal of history of Indian Cultural Landscape, and its selected manifestive representations, e.g. cosmic rhythm and mandala, the ‘motherly’ Ganga River and sacred sites, 38 Cultural properties under Unesco WHS, and intangible heritage – all those that are the repository of National Identity.

**Keywords**: Indian Cultural Landscape, cultural heritage, religious symbolism, Hindu cosmogony, sacredscapes, global message, French school, Transformative manifestation, National Identity.
