One of our goals in our India Discovery Center work to help create a characteristic of a person of Indian descent

for the benefit of the children living abroad and for the world public.
Poetic, cultural, artistic, professional, honest,  

religious, cooperative and other similar phrases compete for our attention. One aspect that can be noticed in  

various BVP scholarly sociology appears as "demanding". It is a new aspect that has not come so far in our

analysis upto 1947. We will try to study modern India in 2022.
