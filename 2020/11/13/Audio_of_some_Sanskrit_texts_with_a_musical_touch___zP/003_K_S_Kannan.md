I have a request to scholars in the List.

  

My wife and I put the well-known *Lakṣmyaṣṭottara* on the Youtube*  
*

when it suddenly occurred that it was a right occasion.

  

But there is a problem with texts like these:  

What exactly is the original source of this text? Where can we get an authentic version?  

Does it occur in some *purāṇa* ? Has somebody collated a few manuscripts?

Versions available on the net (including some in "Sanskrit Documents")

are often found not without typos : proofreading ill done;

sometimes the original itself bears the errors.

How do we sift?  

  

More particularly, should we consider a grammatically incorrect version more authentic?

Where there are multiple readings, should we deem a "correct" version as an emended one?

We know, after all, that the purāṇic language is not quite Pāṇinian always.

  

Suggestions/solutions most welcome.
