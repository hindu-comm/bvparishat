Namaste Misra ji



1. I resonate with your observations beow : \< We have a cause, we are not the cuase \> .



2. I was thrilled to read the transaltion of your fathers poem and the clairty of thought and purpose.



We continue to work together.The role of all Indian languages of Brahmi origin and influence in building the Indian identity is an important factor.
