Dear Dr Kannan,

An Indian abroad is an enigma. The world has a view of India as an eaten out fruit, just retaining its skeleton.  

Our people have no choice but tacitly accept this state out of their own realization. A skeleton does not hound

away the new vultures, who come in large groups to pick on what's remaining.  

I had to eject myself out threatened by Mrs Gandhi's oppressive mode.
My father, an earlier freedom fighter

was taken away to remote jails. It was scary. Here in the US, no one cared for India, the new arrivals from

India were happy to be abroad. Some such apathetic attitude continues in many quarters. The new scholars

resort to name-calling than the Indian art of deep cultivation.  

Through this process, come the new children of Indian descent. They have resources, freedom and strength.

We as a people have to be understandable to our children analytically and objectively. The process is hard,

it has no historical parallel. Unlike other cultures, India teaches knowledge, not religion. Knowledge has  

no color. Reducing India into archaic religious symbols does not work with the youth. We have to demonstrate  

to the youth that India built herself in fundamental inquiries, insightful analytic thinking, and totally unafraid of  

closures in life. We have a cause, we are not the cause. We need many motivated parents and many scholar  

teachers who may not mind to fail but can stay objective in their thinking and research.

As you observed, it is not lonely anymore. But we have only gone a yard in a 26 mile stretch..  

Best regards,

Bijoy

  

PS. Tomorrow (Nov 19) is my father's 20th death anniversary. I am sharing a free form English translation

of a poem he wrote in 1946 from a British jail.
