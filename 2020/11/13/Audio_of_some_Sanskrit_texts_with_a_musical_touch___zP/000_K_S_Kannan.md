Here is presented *Lakṣmy-aṣṭottara-stotra*,

recited especially on Friday evenings.

(Today is Friday).

This is a small gift for the Dīpāvalī,

a celebrated occasion for the worship of Lakṣmī.

  

The focus is mainly on proper text and proper pronunciation.

The gist of the verses is as a bonus.

Wish you all a  

HAPPY *DIPAVALI* !
