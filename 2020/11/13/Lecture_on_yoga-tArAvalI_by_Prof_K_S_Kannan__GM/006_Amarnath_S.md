Namaste,

  

  I remember listening to the Yoga Taaraavali, and reading about it in a small but profound book written by Late Sri Narasimha Murthy who taught yoga in Basavanagudi, Bangalore, without charging any fees, for about forty years from 1968 till about 2010. This book has word-by-word meanings along with explanations, and also practical yoga techniques correspondingto each verse.

  

 Am eager to listen to Prof. Kannan's exposition on the same.

  

Thanks and Regards

\- amar
