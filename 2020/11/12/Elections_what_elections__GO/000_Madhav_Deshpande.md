Elections, what elections?

  

यदि निर्वाचने व्यग्रं मानसं ते नरोत्तम ।

कदा धर्मार्थकामादि कर्तव्यं चिन्तयिष्यसि ।।

  

O good man, if your mind is totally focused on elections, when will you think about doing other necessary things like doing your duties, earning a livelihood and fulfilling other goals of life?
