These thoughts by Prof Sundareswaran are very educational and show how people well versed both in Sanskrit and English can motivateyounger generation to read Ramayana, Mahabharata and other ancient texts.

I enjoyed the lecture and am sure the YouTube post will be watched by many in India and abroad.

Deva Pattanayak

  

ps: I was severelyinfected by Covid-19 and was in ICU for several weeks, the entire month of April. Somehow the doctors did not give up on me.

I remember the children of my close friends are treating me. I also felt that I am going in and out of this world. The thought occurred to me then that death is not painful and there is no difference between being alive and dead. I moved around beautiful places in the Himalayas and the oases in the deserts of the middle east enjoying beautiful peoples, places and meeting and collaborating with them and actually participating in their research. I remember getting mad with my friend when he called me at midnight. I told him " I told you not to bother me anymore onthis topic. I have told you everything I know. My idea is correct and it will solve your problem. It is midnight here and I am in a hospital".

I remember many other things. I was under an induced coma for a few days.

Most likely I picked the virus while standing in line in a grocery store. People were sneezing and coughing. I was not wearing my mask then.

I stalled getting tested for the virus, I called emergency when I could not get out of the bed to go to the toilet. I almost slumped to the floor, but managed to stay on bed. My blood Oxygen level has gone down to 70%. I remember being carried to the ambulance. I was out of this world for the next several weeks.

Clearly being in my early seventies and the miserable situation I was in, I would have understood if I was taken out of life support and treatment. I was told besides my two sons, a german doctor continued to treat me so that I do not pass away. They discovered that afterI was placed in a supine position with my face down, my lungs functionedbetter. Because of that I have a scar on my nose and left cheek.

I was transferred to a rehab hospital where I stayed for ten days. I was nursed back to health with care and love. They were young and probably thought that they were taking care of their grandfather. Some of them were students and shared their life stories with me. Doctors take care of the disease but it is the nurses who are instrumental in the healing process.

I have devoted most of my time to science and technology. Only for the past three years after the passing away of my wife ( she treated herself for six and half years or more without seeing her doctor- she fooled everybody including me, until the last month), I am engaged in understanding Philosophy and the true meaning of life. I feel nature takes care of me after it brought me to this world. We all belong to nature.

I hope this personal post of mine is not too imposing to this list. Thank you for reading.
