Hariom,

  

In 2016 our Usha Sanka had her PhD defended. The 5th chapter is what of most interest for me, called धातुकारकाकाङ्क्षा, it's about kāraka dependency on dhātu meanings. She has done dependency annotation for Sanskrit meanings, but not for the dhātus them-self - next step is missing.  
If I look at the verbs in MW, I still see no additional verbal markup\<H1>\<h>\<key1>yaj\</key1>\<key2>yaj\</key2>\<hom>1\</hom>\</h>, so there is no way to find all the case abbreviations only in verbal articles:

\<ab>nom.\</ab> \<ab>acc.\</ab> \<ab>instr.\</ab> \<ab>dat.\</ab> \<ab>abl.\</ab> \<ab>gen.\</ab> \<ab>loc.\</ab> \<ab>voc.\</ab>

So what I'm thinking off is adding case combinations to a list of roots like Whitney:

√ cyut "drip" √ cur "steal" √ dṛbh "bunch" - sam √ dṛh "make firm" √ cint "think" - anu - abhi - pari - pra - vi - sam √ dās "vide √das" √ dāś "make offering" √ daṃs "be wondrous" √ dṛś "see" - anu - abhi - ā - ud - upa - ni - pari - pra - vi - sam √ dadh "vide √1 dhā" √ dad "vide √1 dā" √ dagh "reach to" - ati √ dah "burn" - ati - anu - upa - ni - nis - pari - pra - vi - sam  

  

It all started here:<https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/MWS/issues/76>

  

What has been done before on the topic, kindly advise.

  

PhD. M.G.
