Introduction: The author, Melputtur Narayana Bhattathiri, 16th- 17th century,  
Kerala is famous as the author of the celebrated devotional poem, Narayaneeyam.   
Sanskrit Grammarians also know him as the author of Prakriyasarvasva, an  
immensely pedagogical elaboration on the Panini Sutras.  
  
Much lesser known are his Sanskrit Champu Kavyas (Prabandhas) with themes  
taken mainly from Mahabharata and Bhagavatha. In addition it is known that  
he has also contributed to some portions of Ramayana Prabandha and  
Bharata Prabandha. Once popularized via Chakyar Kuthu and Pathakam performed  
within Kerala temples, these gems of Sanskrit literature are mostly unknown to  
the Scholarly community at large. Many of the prabandhas have appeared in  
print sometime back but now remain mostly out of print.

Brief Description of the volumes:  
  
1) Volume 1: Vyasolpatti prabandham and Syamantakam prabandham.  
   
 Vyasolpatti is based on Adiparva of Mahabharata and Syamantakam on Bhagavatha.  
 Both works have many interesting shlokas and long rhythmic prose passages.  
   
 Second edition of volume 1 has 1) brief notes on Chakyar Kuthu and Pathakam,  
 2) a note on antaM, limgam, vibhakti and vachanam \[This note is  
included in all the subsequent volumes\], 3) text of Vyasolpatti  
 from Bharatham Prabandham, which is mainly taken from the Purvabharatachampu  
 of Manavedakavi, author of the Sanskrit Gitikavyam, Krishnagiti, 4) a note on  
 previous publications of Sanskrit Champu Kavyas from Kerala.  
  
2) Volume 2: Dutavakyam (Bhagavaddut) prabandham  
  
 The theme is Krishna's peace mission to Hastinapura described in the Udyoga  
 parva of Mahabharata.  
 In this work, the poetic genius of Narayana Bhattathiri shines forth strengthened  
 by the Panditya and Bhakti of the poet. The culmination of the mission,  
 where Krishna reveals his universal form is brought to life by the poet  
 through a long rhythmic prose passage resonating with the beauty and power  
 of words.  
 All the characters including Dhritarashtra are brought to life, revealing their  
 inner, hidden emotions.  
 The work is also of great interest to Mahabharata scholars since it contains  
 variations from available Mahabharata manuscripts. Some of these variations  
are present in other old Mahabharata based works from the south, which may  
indicate some old Southern Recension, unavailable at present.  
  
3) Volume 3: Nrigamoksham prabandham  
  
 Based on Bhagavatha purana. The poet has recreated the episode in his  
 own unique style. The framework of Champu Kavya enables the poet to employ  
 a variety of metres most suitable to the occasion. He has used  
 Anushtup, Induvadana, Indravajra, Giti, Shardulavikriditam, Vasantatilakam,  
 and Harini.   
 The volume also contains the adhyayas on Nrigamoksham from Bhagavata,  
 Mahabharata and Ramayana (Uttarakanda) to facilitate the study of this work.   
   
4) Volume 4: Kaunteyashtakam prabandham, Tripuradahanam prabandham and Kailasavarnanam  
 prabandham. All the three prabandhas are very brief.   
  
 Kaunteyashtakam or Patracharitam tells the event of Yudhishthira receiving  
 the Akshayapatra from Surya and the subsequent misadventure of the sage  
 Durvasa described in the Mahabharata. Tripuradahanam apart from appearing in  
 puranas related to Shiva, is described briefly in Bhagavata. It is narrated  
 in both Mahabharata and Harivamsha. Kailasavarnanam is a singe long prose passage  
 describing Kailasa.  
  
 This volume, in addition contains the texts of 1) Durvasa upakhyana from  
 Mahabharata,2) mAyAmOhash.rSTi from Vishnu purana which helps to underatand  
 the significance of Tripuradahana and 3) the Tripuradahanam adhyaya from  
 Harivamsha together with the Nilakantha commentary which brings forth the  
 significance and inner meaning of Tripuradahanam.  
  
5) Volume 5: Rajasuyam prabandham  
  
 This work is undoubtedly a masterpiece of Sanskrit literature. The poet  
 has closely followed the Southern Recension of Mahabharata, one of its  
 distinguishing feature being the fight between Krishna and Shishupala.  
 Mahabharata of Vyasa is almost silent on the vedic rituals of Rajasuya which  
 lasts almost one and a half years. On the other hand, in this Champu Kavya,  
 Melputhur Narayana Bhattathiri, after consulting the ancient authoritative  
 manuals, has described all the rituals in the chronological manner.  
 As far as we know, the only other work dealing exclusively with this subject  
 is the Monograph in English,  
 The ancient Indian royal consecration by J. C. Heesterman.  
 The poet has embellished his descriptions of rituals with both  
 precision and poetic beauty. His deep knowledge of Sanskrit grammar enables  
 the poet to employ alamkaras like shlesha and virodhabhasa in both  
 shloka and gadya passages. The poet has fused together the bhautika,  
 Daivika and Adhyatmika aspects of this event, thereby illuminating  
 the utmost importance of this event in the Mahabharata.   
   
6) Volume 6: Dakshayaga prabandham  
  
 The poet has closely followed the Bhagavatha narration but has used the  
 context to illustrate and contrast the nastika (Daksha) and astika (Sati)  
 worldviews. At the same time, the narrative is quite dramatic.  
 The distinguishing marks of the poet as scholar, grammarian and devotee  
 are all clearly visible in this work. Interestingly the long passage  
 describing the destruction of Daksha's sacrifice is in the Tarangini metre  
 which is a rarity in Sanskrit.  
  
 This volume also includes the 24th and 25th adhyayas of Satikhanda, Rudrasamhita  
 portion of Shivamahapurana, which are essential to understand the events in  
 the life of Sati.   
  
7) Volume 7: Panchalisvayamvaram prabandham  
  
 Panchalisvayamvaram prabandham follows the Chaitrarathaparva and Svayamvaraparva  
 portions of the Adi parva of Mahabharata, It is clear that Melputhur has  
 created this work after a close study of Mahabharata. The text has scant prose  
 passages. In addition to exhibiting the excellence of the author in various  
 fields, Panchalisvayamvaram prabandham has some unique marks left by the  
 Southern Recension of Mahabharata, especially the Kerala manuscripts.  
  
 This volume contains a note on Panchalisvayamvaram prabandham and its  
 Mahabharata sources.  
  
  
8) Volume 8: Nalayanicharitam prabandham  
  
 Nalayanicharitam of Melputhur has unique importance in the field  
 of Mahabharata study. The theme dealing with the previous life of  
 Draupadi is an integral part of the Southern Recension. Without its  
 inclusion and continuity, the Pamchendropakhyanam (the narrative dealing with the  
 the former five Indras) loses much of its meaning. The prabandha itself is  
 unique in that it contains some long prose passages in Prakrit language.  
 (These passages are followed by their Sanskrit Chaya).  
  
 A note included in this volume named "The importance of Nalayanicharitam  
prabandham in the contemplation of Mahabharata" deals with  
1) a summary of the narrative,  
2) the identity of Nalayani with the unnamed woman Svargashri who appears  
 in the subsequent Pamchendropakhyanam as elaborated on by Melputhur.  
3) The identity of Indrasena Nalayani with Indrasena, the daughter of Nala and  
 Damayanti (the word Nalayani means daughter of Nala),  
4) Reference to Nalayani in even the Northern Recension of Mahabharata,  
5) Connection of Panchali and King Drupada through previous lives  
6) Vedavati, Chayasita, Draupadi -- Trihayani   
 as the passage of Draupadi through the different yugas in different lives  
 and  
7) The three dice games (first one by father Nala, second one between  
 Shiva and Parvati in disguise, third by husband Yudhisthira) which  
 decidedly affect the course of life of Draupadi in her passages through yugas  
  
 This volume also includes, in Malayalam script,  
 the Nalayanicharitam, Panchendropakhyanam and Naitantavacharitam  
 sections of the Southern recension of Mahabharata  
 edited by P.P.S. Shastri and published in 1931.   
   
9) Volume 9: Kuchelopakhyanam prabandham  
  
 This prabandham dealing with the famous Bhagavatha account of Sudama,  
 the friend of Krishna from student days has turned in to a gem of  
 devotional poem in the hands of Bhattathiri. The poet has brought forth  
 the real lessons to take home from this narration. The long prose passage  
 describing Krishna witnessed by Kuchela (Sudama) at Dvaraka excels in  
 poetic beauty.  
  
 For comparative study, this volume includes the dashaka from Narayaneeyam  
 dealing with Kuchelopakhyanam and the two adhyayas from Bhagavatha.  
  
10) Volume 10: Subhadraharanam prabandham  
  
  
 The theme of Subhadraharanam Prabandham is taken from the  
 Arjunavanavasaparva (adhyaya 201-205),  
 Subhadraharanaparva (adhyaya 206-209) and  
 Haranaharanaparva (adhyaya 210-211)  
 sections of the Adiparva of the Southern Recension of Mahabharata.  
 Just for this reason, Subhadraharanam prabandha of Melputhur is  
 invaluable for Mahabharata studies. In addition, the many faceted  
 poetic genius of Melputhur fully blossoms in this Kavya.  
 The scholar, grammarian, poet, devotee all compete with each other  
 for excellence in this masterpiece. There are numerous padya and  
 gadya sections exhibiting and illuminating the peaks of poetic  
 imagination. External and internal landscapes intermingle  
 without any boundaries. A fine example of what is possible  
 uniquely in Sanskrit language.
