Namaste Prof Sivakumar Ji,

  

Rightly said. Caution is the call of the day.

  

Rajiv Malhotra has been fighting this menace for a long time. Sadly his efforts are yet to receive its due. His recent book, Sanskrit
Non-Translatables - is an attempt to stone-wall these attempts by the West.

  

Regards

  

Balagopal
