NamasteSriBalgopalji,

  

This thread was about Southasianacrives.org and its contents. The website has extraordinarily rare materials kept in digitised format which can be accessedby users with their universities subscription. My reply was with reference tothe content of [sothasianarchives.org](http://sothasianarchives.org),saying that such material is now available for free elsewhere Most of them, if not all. Now you are saying Sri Rajiv Malhotraji sees a conspiracyhere and is against Southasianacrives.org , JSTOR and online academic Journal publishing initiatives. He would like to see all such academic journals close down. Please quote Sri Rajiv Malhotra's statements from his published works if at all he has written anything, from which one can draw such inferences.Would Like to learn more. Thanks

Regards  
Ajit Gargeshwari
