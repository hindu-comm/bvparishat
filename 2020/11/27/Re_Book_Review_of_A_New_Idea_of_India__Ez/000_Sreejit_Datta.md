Namaskar,

  

I'd like to share with you our [review](https://swatantramag.com/book-review-of-a-new-idea-of-india-individual-rights-in-a-civilisational-state/) of the book *A New Idea of India: Individual Rights in a Civilisational State* which has certain things to say about the Indic civilisation and Sanatana Dharma. We have mainly addressed those things in this review, apart from a few other sociological and political science theories that the book uses.

The review has been jointly authored by Sri Raghava Krishna and I. Do read, discuss, and share with friends & family if you like.

  

Thanks and regards,

Sreejit Datta
