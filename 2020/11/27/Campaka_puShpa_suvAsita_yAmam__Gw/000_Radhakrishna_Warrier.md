Campaka puṣpa suvāsita yāmam ...

  

Yāminī is here now, but the fragrance of the Campaka is absent.

The fragrance of the Campaka permeates through the literature of every Indian language, ancient or modern.

This is what we call Campaka - [https://ml.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%B4%9A%E0%B4%AE%E0%B5%8D%E0%B4%AA%E0%B4%95%E0%B4%82](https://ml.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%B4%9A%E0%B4%AE%E0%B5%8D%E0%B4%AA%E0%B4%95%E0%B4%82) (just see the picture and ignore the language if you cannot read it.)
We call this also as Campaka - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumeria).


Like the Campaka, the Pārijāta is another flower that spreads its fragrance and beauty in ancient and modern Indian literature. Not forgetting Mallikā, the jasmine and its glowing presence in the Indian literature. 

The heady fragrance of Niśāgandhi flowers has a special appeal. Where I spent my boyhood and early teenage years, there was an ēẓilam Pāla tree (I don’t know its English or Hindi common name. Its scientific name is *Alstonia scholaris* and the Sanskrit name is Saptaparṇa whose seemingly literal translation is the “ēẓilam”, the first part of its Malayalam name ēẓilam Pāla. [https://ml.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%B4%8F%E0%B4%B4%E0%B4%BF%E0%B4%B2%E0%B4%82%E2%80%8C%E0%B4%AA%E0%B4%BE%E0%B4%B2](https://ml.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%B4%8F%E0%B4%B4%E0%B4%BF%E0%B4%B2%E0%B4%82%E2%80%8C%E0%B4%AA%E0%B4%BE%E0%B4%B2)).
It had a wonderful frangrance and it was awe inspiring too because of its connection with the Yakṣi. The Yakṣi is not the sweet Yakṣiṇī of Sanskrit literature. She is a malevolent creature though she appears as a beautiful woman to lure men to her abode which is atop either the ēẓilam Pāla tree or the Karim Paṉa, the big, black palm tree.

Just remembered a few flowers as I heard the song “Campaka puṣpa suvāsita yāmam …” ([Chambaka pushpa suvasitha yamam YAVANIKA - Bing video](https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=chempaka+pushpa+suvasitha+yamam+lyrics&docid=608008137996240220&mid=A2D33A5D103F20AF8C7FA2D33A5D103F20AF8C7F&view=detail&FORM=VIRE)).
