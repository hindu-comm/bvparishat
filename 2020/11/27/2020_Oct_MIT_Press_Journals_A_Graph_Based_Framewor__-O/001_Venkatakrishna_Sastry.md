Namaste Megha



1. Thanks for sharing the new approach and update on Sanskrit related models of Computational linguistic analysis.



2. The 99 page, well referenced and annotated document , with a ' proposed framework using energy based models for multiple structured prediction tasks in Sanskrit' still feels like a 'Techno-Linguists

Post -mortem of Panini-Patanjali-Yaska tradition ' for a classical (dead-?? ) language.



3. The reading of the entire paper has left me with a haunting question:



 'What is the definition and model of 'Sanskrit' used for this analysis ?

How and by what percentage the mapping matches to the 'Paninian model of 'Samskrutham' which covers 'Chandas and Bhashaa' in a unified process rule model, using 'Vednaga- pedagogy'. 



 May be there is a critical need to revist the basic question, in the interest of traditional schools and also the modern scientific studies, an answer to the 'VINIYOGA' challenge, which I articulate
below :



 किं तत् संस्कृतं नाम , केन शास्त्रेण बोध्यते ? मुनित्रयोक्तनियमाः कस्य देवस्य तुष्टये ?? 



 What is it that is called 'Sanskrit'? What traditional technical discipline guides this study-analytics?

 Who is that 'god' to please whom, the rules given by Panini-Patanjali-Yaska tradition are to be oblated for?
