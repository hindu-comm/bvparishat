May I clarify again that the discussion is not on Hhari Dasa literature.

  

Hari Katha is a narrative performing art.

  

Performers of Hari Katha are usually called as Bhaagavataars.

  

The text of a Hari Katha is a very long narration -text, made of mostly lyrics and a few verses.

  

The performing artist performs using classical carnatic singing and light classical style dance.

  

The texts for Hari Katha in south Indian regional languages are very big in number.

  

Sanskrit texts, though rare, do exist.

  

The discussion is about the Sanskrit texts.
