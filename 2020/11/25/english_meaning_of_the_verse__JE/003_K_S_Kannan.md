That man alone lives

in whose utterance truth is;

in whose eyes there is (devotion to) pleasantness, inspiring confidence in the hearts of all;

in whose hands there is (the act of) giving away gifts;

in whose mind is the concern for terminating the strife that issues from Manmatha;

in whose heart is enshrined the beloved viz. Compassion; \[and\]  

in whose body is the endeavor for the sake of \[the good of\] others.

Other beings merely roam about in this existence/*saṁsāra*.

  

(I have shown care more for the syntax of the original

than for the idiom of English.

Others may give better translations.)

  

Where is the *śloka* from?
