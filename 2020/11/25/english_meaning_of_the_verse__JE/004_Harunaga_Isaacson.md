The translation seems to me to read very nicely, thank you for it, Prof. Kannan.

Seems that it is from the Caturvargasaṃgraha attributed to Kṣemendra (1.11).

It is also included in the famous anthology Subhāṣitāvalī compiled by Vallabhadeva

(3032). It might well be included in some other anthologies, I imagine.
