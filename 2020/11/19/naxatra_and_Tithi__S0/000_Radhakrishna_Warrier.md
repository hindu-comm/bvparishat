It has been my experience that theōṇam festival is always associated with moonlit nights.“ōṇa nilāvŭ” (moonlight of ōṇam) is a favourite term of poets and lyricists.

ōṇam is celebrated on the day of the śravaṇa (ōṇam) asterism in the solar month of Siṃha or Ciṅṅam (August-September). This means that an asterism (nakṣatra) in a given solar month is more or less aligned with the phase of the moon, or in other words, with the tithi.

For the above to happen, the month for reckoning the asterism should be solar. Which means that precession of equinoxes is taken care of in the calendar. Was the ōṇam night a moonlit one even in the distant past, long before the introduction of the “Kollam” calendar with solar months (or zodiacal months) 1196 years ago?I believe that in pre-modern times, the correction for the precession was not included in the Kollam calendar. The months were aligned with the zodiac, but not fully with the seasons. So, how was it ensured that the ōṇam night was a moonlit one? Or was it not ensured?
