Namaste

  

The following shloka is cited by Shankaracharya in the Prose section of the Upadesha saahasri as:

  

तथाचोक्तम् -  

  

रूपसंस्कारतुल्याधी रागद्वेषौ भयं च यत्।  
गृह्यते धीश्रयं तस्माज् ज्ञाता शुद्धोऽभयः सदा॥  

  

This shloka also appears in the 15thchapter of the metrical part of the same text.

  

One is curiousabout the text Shankara is citing this verse from. Any help is welcome.

  

Thanks
