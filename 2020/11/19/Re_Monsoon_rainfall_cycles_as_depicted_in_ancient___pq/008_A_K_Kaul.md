Respected Shri Damodara Dasa ji,

Damodaraaya Namah!

\<Visuvat, if I am not mistaken, means the day on which day and night

are of equal duration, in English we call equinox. If so, then visuvat  
here may not mean Daksinayana. Also the next month referred (chittrai)  

to doesn't tally with Daksinayana.>

  

No. you are not mistaken. Vishuva does usually refer to the Vernal Equinox these days. But in ceratin cases about the Vedic lore, there have been exceptions.

I had discussed this point of Vishuvan=Summer Solstice thoroughly in my "Shri Krishen Universal Ephemeris & Panchang" for 1999, the relevant page from which is attached. (SKUE-1999-Vishuvaan)

Also attached are a few mantras from the Aitreya Brahaman with commentary, where this issue of Vishuvan has been discussed. (Attachment AB-VishuvaanI and II)

The views of the CRC which has referrd to to P C Sengupta's interpretation of the Aitreya Brahmana Mantras also is attached.(Attachment CRC-Vishuvaan)

Above all, incontrovertible scientific/astronomical proofs that whether it was 10000 BCE or whether it will be 10000 AD, the so called nirayana zodiac is not scientific at all, and is therefore really anti-Vedic. (attachment 10001BC).

It is, therefore hight time that we swithc over to celebrating all the festivals, whether Makar-Samkranti-cum-Pongal or Shri Kirhsna Janmashtami or Navaratras etc. as per the criteria as ordained by our shastras and not as per the whims and fancies of some "Vedic astrologers".

With regardsa and Damodaraaya Namah!

A K Kaul
