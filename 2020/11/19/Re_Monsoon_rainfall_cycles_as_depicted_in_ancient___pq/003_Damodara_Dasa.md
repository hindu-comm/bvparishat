Hare Krishna.  

  
\>\> Vishuvan does refer to Dakshinayan Day I.e. Summer Solstice here.  
  

How is that? I could not understand.  
  
Visuvat, if I am not mistaken, means the day on which day and night  
are of equal duration, in English we call equinox. If so, then visuvat  
here may not mean Daksinayana. Also the next month referred (chittrai)  
to doesn't tally with Daksinayana.  
  
Forgive my ignorance.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
