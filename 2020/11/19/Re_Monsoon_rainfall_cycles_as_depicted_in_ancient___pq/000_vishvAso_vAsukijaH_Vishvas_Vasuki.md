interesting article worth saving.  

One question which has been vexing me is: Which region tends to have
cloudy climate during vernal equinox?  
  

Relevance of question: taittirIya saMhitA records: ""फ॒ल्गु॒नी॒-पू॒र्ण॒-मा॒से दी᳚ख्षेरन् । मुखँ॒व् वा ए॒तत् ,\[28\] सँव्वथ्स॒रस्य॒ यत् फ॑ल्गुनीपूर्णमा॒सः । मु॒ख॒त ए॒व सँ॑व्वथ्स॒रम् आ॒रभ्य॑ दीख्षन्ते । तस्यैकै॒व नि॒र्या यथ् साम्मे᳚घ्ये विषू॒वान्थ्-स॒म्पद्य॑ते ।" (One should get consecrated on the Phalguni full-moon day because Phalguna full moon is the "mouth" of the year. Hence, ( such people ) are taken as consecrated from the very beginning of the year. But such people have to accept one 'niryā' ( draw back ), viz., that the Viṣuvān occurs in the cloudly season ( sammeghya ). Hence, one should consecrate on the Citrā full-moon day (ie a month later).) So, question arises - where were our ancestors to experience such a climate?  
  

Current unsatisfactory fit: <https://weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-Rainfall-Temperature-Sunshine,tashkent,Uzbekistan> .  
  
If you get a good lead, please let me know. I haven't seen any good average precipitation Eurasia maps for March/ April - that would have helped.
