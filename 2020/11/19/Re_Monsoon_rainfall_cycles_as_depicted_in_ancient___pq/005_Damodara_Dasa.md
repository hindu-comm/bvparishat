Well, the sanskrit search yields that it means "Equinox," which means  
the day on which day and night durations are equal.

This occurs twice a year, once in commencing summer and once in ending  
monsoon. The one which is discussed here seems to be referring to the  
equinox in the summer, because of the names of months mentioned.  
  
In my experience, there are cloudy days around March 15 to April 05,  
every year in some places in North India. Sometimes there is rain  
also. This is a time for late cutting of wheat in some places and  
rains do harm crops, in rare ocassions.
