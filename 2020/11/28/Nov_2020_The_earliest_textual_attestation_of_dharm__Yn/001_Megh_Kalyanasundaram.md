Namaste,

  

Since I received a request for an alternate access option—one that does not require a sign-in (as is the case with Academia)—I include[this alternatelink](https://meghk.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/the-earliest-textual-attestation-of-e28098dharmascc81acc84stra-and-more_-an-analysis-of-chronology-in-a-dharma-reader-1.pdf), from which a pdf of the paper *The earliest textual attestation of ‘dharmaśāstra’ and more: An analysis of chronology in ‘A Dharma Reader’*(Nov 2020) can be accessed and downloaded.

Is the birth of the*Dharmaśāstra*genre > causally linked, and incontrovertibly indebted, to the Buddha and > emperor Aśoka? Patrick Olivelle’s 2017 book ‘*A Dharma Reader - > Classical Indian Law*’ contains statements that appear to be pointed > answers to the above questions, a pointedness that I find pregnant > with serious revisionist implications of profound consequence not just > to the textual history of the term ‘*dharmaśāstra*’ and the origins of > the*Dharmaśāstra*genre but also to the history of the idea > of*Dharma*itself and perhaps to some people of those traditions in > which*Dharma*is seen as*Sanātana*.
