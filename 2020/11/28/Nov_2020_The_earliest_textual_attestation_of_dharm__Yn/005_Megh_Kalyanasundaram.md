I attended this following talk by Dr. David Flatto and hosted by Dr. Samuel Moyn earlier thisweek.

During the Q&A, I had the opportunity to learn from Dr. Flatto what the scope of his literature survey was, when he wrote "...breaks new ground..." (see Pp. 6 in page 6 of the [paper](https://www.academia.edu/45136749/_Separation_of_Powers_in_global_legal_history_evidence_from_Indian_Knowledge_Systems_seen_alongside_The_Crown_and_the_Courts_and_The_First_Constitution)) and whether his literature survey included texts from *Indian Knowledge Systems* (IKS). His answer was to the effect that texts from IKS were not part of the literature he had considered. He suggested I share my paper with him, which I did, and he has written back acknowledgingthe same with a thanks and a "seems very interesting".  

  

Best,

Megh
