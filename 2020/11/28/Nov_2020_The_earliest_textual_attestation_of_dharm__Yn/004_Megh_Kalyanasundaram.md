[*"Separation of Powers" in global legal history: evidence from Indian Knowledge Systems seen alongside 'The Crown and the Courts' and 'The First Constitution'*](https://www.academia.edu/45136749/_Separation_of_Powers_in_global_legal_history_evidence_from_Indian_Knowledge_Systems_seen_alongside_The_Crown_and_the_Courts_and_The_First_Constitution)

**  
**

**Abstract**: "This paper presents an empirical case for inclusions of evidence from *Indian Knowledge Systems* into those history narratives of constitutional law that aspire to be inclusively global in their academic concern for, amongst other legal concepts, the early history of Separation of Powers. The aforementioned foregrounding of evidence is undertaken alongside a reading of (and in response to aspects of) The Crown and the Courts: Separation of Powers in the Early Jewish Imagination published recently by Harvard University Press in 2020 and The First Constitution: Rethinking the Origins of Rule of Law and Separation of Powers in Light of Deuteronomy published in 2006."

  

One of Justice Jois' important books is acknowledged for its significance, cited from, and an attempt has been made to add a small drop to the sea of evidence he put together.🙏

  

Best,

Megh
