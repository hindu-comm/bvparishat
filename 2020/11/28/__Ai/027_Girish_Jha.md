Dear Sanskrit Colleagues,

Could anyone kindly give the complete form of a Shloka of Adi Shankaracharya of which the last Stanza is अतसीकुसुमावभासम्.

In this Shloka Acharya intends to say that

I am a Sanyasin,always chanting शिव पञ्चाक्षरी and meditating on Nirguna Brahman but when that child of divine beauty having colour of the atasi flower comes to my mind I forget everything and get enchanted.

Thanks in advance,

Regards
