In the case of (*api* and) *ava*, it is possible to argue that there is *allopa*,

hence even *vaseka* could perhaps be taken as an independent word,

in which case it can be conjured that there is indeed no *sandhi* between the 2nd and 3rd *pāda*-s here

(though, nevertheless, there is *samāsa* between the two,  

showing thereby the absence of the usual hiatus between the two halves of the verse).
