Respected Professor Sahab,

Pranamami.  

I am thankful to you.Perhaps the Shloka might be this verily which I was seeking.

Some person had said me it had been composed by Shankaracharya.But your presentation and view seem to be perfect to me.I hope you are hale and hearty with the kind blessings of Sri Radha-Krishna.

Sincerely

Girish K. Jha
