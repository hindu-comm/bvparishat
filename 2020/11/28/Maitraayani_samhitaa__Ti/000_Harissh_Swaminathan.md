Namaste all

  

I am in need of maitraayani samhitaa in physical form. I am aware of two editions online. One by shri satvalekar and other a German edition

  

I see one chaukhamba edition also but Not sure the contents of the book

  

Kindly help me with details on how we can get the actual book

  

If there are people from nasik in this forum who have a book, I will be glad to contact them

  

Harish
