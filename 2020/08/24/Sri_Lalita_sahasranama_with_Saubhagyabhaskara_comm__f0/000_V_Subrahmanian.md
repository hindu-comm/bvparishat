Namaste  

  

Here is the link to the document of some 350 pages in searchableformat consisting of the famous Saubhagya bhaskara commentary of Sri Bhaskara raya Makhin to the Sri Lalita Sahasra nama.

  

The first page of the document, consisting of the publication details, is not showing in readable format. However the main body of the text is unaffected.

  

I thank those who helped making this long felt need addressed.
