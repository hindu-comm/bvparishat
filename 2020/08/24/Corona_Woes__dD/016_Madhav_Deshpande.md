Corona Woes

  

मदीयां याचनां श्रुत्वाऽगिलद्राहु: करोनिकाम् ।

गलात्तस्य विनिर्याता हा हन्त चतुराऽऽसुरी ।।

  

Hearing my request, Rahu swallowed Corona. Alas Alas, that clever demoness came out of his throat. \[The demon Rahu is only the severed head without a body. So when he swallows the sun and the moon, they come out of his throat.\]
