Dear Warrier Ji,

  

The rules of the doha meter can be used to rule out the two middle options that you have cited. A doha is (13, 11) in its matra structure.

  

पाहनis from पाषाण while पत्थर is from प्रस्तर.

  

I do not know which one Kabir used and due to the variations in his literary tradition, I do not think anyone can say with certainty.

  

It does appear to me thatपाहन was more commonly used in his time. Tulsidas used पाहन very often in his Ramacharitamanas:पाहन ते न काठकठिनाई. While the language of Kabir is not exactly Awadhi, I think this may be regarded as circumstantialindication.

  

Best,

Kushagra
