There is a grain that is called മുതിര in Malayalam (mutira, pronounced mudira) often associated with കുതിര (kutira, pronounced kudira, meaning horse.) Not just that mudira and kudira rhyme, it is believed that mudira is a very nutritious food for the kudira (horse). It is translated into English as horse gram. In the Ayurveda literature prevalent in Kerala, the Sanskrit equivalent of mudira is कुलत्थ (kulattha) so the Hindi equivalent could be kulath (कुलथ). Interested to know what it is called in Hindi and other languages. Someone told me that it is called uluva in Telugu. In Malayalam, uluva is methi (मेथी, fenugreek).

  

Mudira is ideal for cultivation in dry high lands and is cultivated in the dry areas of the Deccan plateau. Although it is not widely cultivated in Kerala, people consume it and also give to buffalos and bulls used for ploughing the land. It is supposed to be protein-rich, and to have many medicinal properties. Here, in the Pacific Northwest of the US, it is available in Indian grocery stores. We buy and consume it occasionally.
