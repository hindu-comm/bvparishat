शनिवार  Saturday Saturn



In most languages of the world, the above relationship between the names of the weekdays and the heavenly bodies holds good. In English, this is obvious in the case of Sunday, Monday and Saturday. The names Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday derive from the names of Nordic gods / goddess identified as equivalent to Latin gods / goddess representing the same heavenly bodies.  

How did this happen? Do all these different languages derive the words for the weekdays from the same source? If the source is same, what is that source?

Is it possible to say during what period the names of the weekdays entered Sanskrit or Prakrit? Do the Vedas mention the names of the weekdays? Do Upanishads mention the names of the weekdays? Do any of the edicts of ancient rulers mention the weekdays?
