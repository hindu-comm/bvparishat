Dear Warrier mahodaya

  

Aryabhatta has given an explanation for the sequencing of the week day's names.  
Surya Siddhanta also provides two shlokas on how to determine the lord of the weekday, month and year.  
  
This was posted by Sudarshan Bharadwaj & Nilesh Nilkanth Oak on their WordPress page.  
  
Aryabhatiya  
  
To date, the best explanation for this particular ordering of the weekdays and their association with various grahas comes from a verse in the Aryabhatiya, composed by the Indian mathematician and astronomer Aryabhatta (Aryabhatiya, KalaKriya Pada, Verse, 16):  
  
सप्तैते होरेशा: शनैश्चराद्या यथाक्रमं शीघ्रा:\|  
शीघ्रक्रमाच्च्तुर्था भवन्ति सूर्योदयाद् दिनपा: \|\|  
  
The (above mentioned – mentioned in previous verse) seven Grahas beginning with Saturn, which are arranged in the order of increasing velocity, are the lords of the successive hours. The Grahas occurring fourth in the order of increasing velocity are the lords of the successive days, which are reckoned from Sunrise (in Lanka).  
  
(Sanskrit word ‘Graha’ is generally translated as ‘planets’ in astronomical context. This is a mistake. The meaning of ‘graha’ is ‘one that grasps’. Thus, in the astronomical context, the word ‘graha’ means an astral object that grasps another astral object (e.g. ‘Graha’ approach-ing a nakshatra – a visual delusion, of course). It also means an astral body that exerts attractive force on the earth.)  
What we have above is a ‘mnemonic device’. The original form or explanation can be understood or explained in few different ways.  
  
The lords of the twentyfour hours (with hours being measured from sunrise at Lanka) are: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, respectively, and the lords of the seven days are: Saturn, Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, respectively.  
  
The lord of the day is the lord of the first hour of that day, the day being measured from sunrise.  
  
  
Surya Siddhanta  
  
Surya Siddhanta has similar explanation (Bhugoladhyaya -78)  
  
मन्दादध: क्रमेण स्युश्चतुर्था दिवसाधिप:  
होरेशा सूर्यतनयादधोध: क्रमशस्तथा  
  
Starting from the Saturn downward, the fourth graha is called the lord of the day. The graha starting from the Saturn successively downwards are the lords of the hour.  
  
My copies of the Surya Siddhanta (Pt Madhava Prasad Purohit and a translation by Burgess/Ganguli) has a slightly different shloka number.  
  
मदान्धःक्रमेण स्युश्चतुर्था दिवसाधिपाः ।  
वर्षाधिपतयस्तद्वत्तृतीयाश्च प्रकीर्तिताः ॥ ७९ ॥  
ऊर्ध्वक्रमेण शशिनो मासानामधिपाः स्मृताः ।  
होरेशाः सूर्यतनयादधोऽधः क्रमशस्तथा ॥ ८० ॥  
  
  
Starting from the Saturn downward, the fourth graha is called the lord of the day. The graha starting from the Saturn successively downwards are the lords of the hour.  
Downward sequencing from Saturn, third graha is lord of the year. Counting upwards from Moon is the lord of the month.
