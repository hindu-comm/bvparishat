Dear Warrier Ji,

  

Professor Subhash Kak has an article on it:

  

<https://medium.com/@subhashkak/names-of-the-days-of-the-week-520acffe9b6d>  

  

It seems that the similarities are primarily between Sanskrit, Latin, and Germanic traditions. Other Indo-European traditions, such as Greek, differ in the nomenclature.

  

I do not know the first instance of the mention of theweekdays but by the time, the standard texts of Jyotisha were written, this naming convention was well-established. Strength due to weekday (वारबल) is included in calculation of planetary strength (षड्बल).

  

Best,

Kushagra
