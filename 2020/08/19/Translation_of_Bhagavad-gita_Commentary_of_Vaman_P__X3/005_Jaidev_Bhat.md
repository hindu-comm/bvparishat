Dear Prof. Madhav Deshpande ji,

  

Thank you for this important detail. I wish someone would've done a complete translation of this work. I have seen Vamana Pandit's name being mentioned in the Avigita commentary by Pandit Dhupkar Shastri. I wish I could've understood Vamana Pandit's work nicely before seeing what the Avigita has to say about it. However I will try to use the existing summary to the best ofmy ability.

  

If anyone has any more information or translations of Vamana Pandit's work or the Avigita, please let me know in this thread.

  

regards,

  

jaidev bhat.
