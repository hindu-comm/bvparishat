Prof. Mehendale hailed from Baroda,that is, Vadodara and started his teaching career in Navsari,under the jurisdiction of the Gaekwads.

  

The Baroda State has lost another outstanding scholar after Prof. D. D. Mahulikar.

  

This loss is surely the greatest and really very difficult to bear.

  

The scholarly world has lost a luminary in linguistics etc.

  

My [shraddhanjali.om](http://shraddhanjali.om) shanti shriram.

  

Prof. Siddharth Y. Wakankar.
