Literature Academy's Language Honor Award for Elite and Medieval Literature Dr. There is no right thing like Madhukar Anant Mehendale to declare a knowledgeable Sanskrit pandit. However, this award to Sahitya Academy is Dr. It's too late to take mehendale to them. Dr. Mehendale is a Sanskrit, Maharishi of natural languages, as well as a reader of the flag of Rigveda, Nirukta, Mahabharata and Parsi scriptures. Among Sanskrit knowers, the work he did for the Bhandarkar Oriental Institute for the medical edition of the Mahabharata and the cultural list of Mahabharata.

Dr. Several research written by Mehendale are always useful for references. They also have essays on words and meanings that change according to their context. ' Satyamev Jayate ' showed the changing meaning of India's brief sentence and ' Satyamev Jayate Nanrut ' in Mundakopanishad. Wai's Prajnya Pathshala gave his lecture on the topic ' Ancient India: Society and Culture ' and has also published a book titled the same. This book is readily arranged on various topics such as stories of Mahabharata, Rupakas and Vedas, Vedas and Avestha, yet common people will understand. Dr. Mehendale was born on 14 February 1918 He graduated from Mumbai's Wilson College, while doctorate from Deccan College, Pune.

Mehendale married inter-caste in 1941 After retirement, he took responsibility for work on Mahabharata at Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute. The work they have done is a guide to researchers and researchers. Mehendale is an international level scholar, studious. Many of his books, books, search essays have been published. With all this, the common people will understand, they have written in such a way that the right meaning will reach them. This wise man has shown through action that the flow of knowledge should be increasing, everyone should be participating in it. Vyasang is our job and the politics of organizations means wasting time, knowing that Mehendalas never wasted time. Some injustice also suffered. Honoring them has increased the height of this award.
