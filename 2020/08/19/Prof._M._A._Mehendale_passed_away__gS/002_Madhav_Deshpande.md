Dear Roland,

  

  Thanks for sharing this video link. To me, Professor Mehendale was not only my teacher at the University of Pune, but I had daily contact with him for long stretches of time when I used to go to Pune and work at the BORI for months at a time. I was editing and translating the Śaunakīya Caturādhyāyikā with its commentaries, and there were always complex questions of textual interpretation. I could discuss these at the BORI with professors Mehendale, Ghatage and Dandekar and many solutions to these questions emerged out of these discussions. With Mehendale'spassing, an entire generation of Pune scholarship has gone into history.
