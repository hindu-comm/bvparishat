।। हरिः शरणम् ।।

पचमानः देवदत्तः अस्ति = वर्त्तमानकालिकपाकनुकूलव्यापाराश्रयो देवदत्तः ऐसा बोध होगा।  
means this is present participle, it doesn't denote Action/व्यापार, so it has to be an adjective to a सत्त्ववाची।  
Hindi = पकाता हुआ देवदत्त है। ंNot देवदत्त पका रहा है।

many people use this to denote Continous tense. But this is present participle not action.  
Also, व्यापार is by default continous। there is no need to write Simple and Continous.

The Hindi Writers directly translated it from Eng. So they too say पूर्ण क्रिया and अपूर्ण क्रिया ।

what the simple denotes is देशकालनैरपेक्ष्येण देवदत्तकर्त्तृकपाकानुकूलक्रिया।  
पकाता है। he cooks. There is no specification denoted. There is a randomness. eg नित्यं पचति। सूर्यः लोकत्रयं परिक्रामति। (any generic statement).

But special present tense is देशकालसापेक्ष। इदानीं पचति। = देशकालसापेक्ष्येण देवदत्तकर्तृकपाकनुकूलक्रिया।

Why I'm writing this?  
Because it is not only the new students who speak. I have heard even big scholars equate this usage to Special Present Tense.  
Which makes me wonder if I'm missing something.

Namskar.
