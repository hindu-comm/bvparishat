Namaste,

  

अष्ट-मङ्गल-चिह्नानि - In my limited information, these are recorded in the field of ancient architecture as eight auspicious signs.

  

What are these and where can we find them in the scriptures?

  

Further, is it restricted to architecture or did architects use those symbolically, meant for a different purpose?

  

Also, is this related to अष्ट-मङ्गल-प्रश्न?

  

Can revered scholars enlighten me on this?
