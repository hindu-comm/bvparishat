I am a postgraduate student in Sanskrit from the University of Peradeniya Sri Lanka. Currently, I am working on a research topic for my thesis. I have an idea to compose a dictionary or an encyclopedia on a particular book or works by an author. So, for readings,I am looking for a book under the title of **'Encyclopedia on Sakuntala'.** This name could be slightly different. Or any book related to above-mentionedmatter will do.

  

I willbe really gratefulif anyone could help with this matter.  
  

Thank you!

  

Rev .N. Nagitha
