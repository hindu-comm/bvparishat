What is named? Is the thing named or its reflection of the thing on the human visual screen named? When a word is thought to stand for the object to the human mind a virtual dichotomy appears, in the sense, that the name appears to be accidental to the object. However when one recognizes that the visualization of the object on the human screen is itself transmuted into words the dichotomy vanishes. The human brain only transforms the image into a word form. Thus the vartik Siddhe Shabdaarthe Sambandhe.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
