Dear Vidwans,

  

Though for the purpose of vyakarana shabda is considered to be dravya it is not dravya in reality. It is of the nature of energy used as a means of communication. Sound by itself illumines just like light which is also energy. Therefore dhvani is the nature of a word. For eg. the sound of a bird, an animal or even the sound of thunder orlightning also convey meaning i.e they are perceptible to the 'sense' not just the ear. Thus the word shabda does not only mean words. By its very nature words convey or carry meaning. Meaning is not ascribed to words. There is no dichotomy between word and meaning and hence the word siddhe is used in the vartik siddhe shabdartha Sambandhe.

  

The separation of word and meaning came up on account of the need to learn languages other than one's ownlanguage for which dictionaries were compiled. If for a moment one asks a person who speaks only one language what the meaning of a particular word is, will he not get quizzed? The purpose of uttering a word is its meaning. 

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
