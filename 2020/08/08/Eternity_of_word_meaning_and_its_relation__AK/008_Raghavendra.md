Respected sir,

  

In VSN, we find epithets such as शब्दातिगः / शब्दसहः

  

Here the term शब्द is either taken for स्तुति and/or निन्दा. Therefore, the meaning is - He (विष्णु) is beyondस्तुति and/or निन्दा (शब्दातिगः)ORHe (विष्णु) is indifferent toस्तुति and/or निन्दा (as Hetolerates (सहन)bothशब्द (स्तुति) and अपशब्द (निन्दा = आक्रोश which anyways is the root meaning of the word out of which शब्द is formed - शप् आक्रोशे with the addition of दन् प्रत्यय).

  

The following अथर्रववेद मन्त्र appears to suggest the meaning of the term शब्द as शाप,

  

"यो न शपादपशतः शपतो यश्च नः शपात् ।

वृक्ष इव विद्युता हत आमूलादनुशुष्यतु ।। ७.५९.१।।

  

I will be grateful if you can throw light on the above, especiallyशब्द = शापरूप.

  
With Best regards,
