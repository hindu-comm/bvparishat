Sri Lokesh Sharma

  

The fundamental concept is that "artha" exists in the buddhi. This is called bauddhaartha. This doctrine is common to Vyakarana and Advaita (and Buddhism), which are called idealistic schools.

  

Let me elaborate bauddhaartha. in Hyderabad, the main TTD (Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam) office is in a place called Liberty. This place was called Liberty because many decades back, there was a cinema here called Liberty. It has been closed many decades ago. So now there is no Liberty cinema. Still the place is called Liberty. Why? Due to the cinema. Where is the cinema? In the minds of people.

  

Therefore when someone says घटं करोति, the meaning is बुद्धिस्थं घटं बाह्यं करोति.

  

That said Sabdanityatva is also upheld by a realist school, Mimamsa.

  

Then a different quearion arises: okay but the pot that I see is real, how can you say that it is the same as the Sabda 'pot' or 'घट' or 'kuMDa' or whatever else you call it? The answer is that the reality of the seen world is not completely denied. Vyaavahaarika sattaa is accepted. At the paramaartha level, the reality of pot as distinct from Sabda is not accepted. Then whence the perceived reality? Advaita says 'maayaa' and Vyakarana says 'kaala'.

  

The day I truly understand this, I would have to renounce the world (if my understanding is true and complete). So, till I do not take sannyasa, I have not understood this. In that sense this is the journey that each one of us undertakes with guidance from Guru.

  

Your doubts might not get cleared in an email discussion, but with the anugraha of Isvara, may some progress be made.

  

Regards

Senani
