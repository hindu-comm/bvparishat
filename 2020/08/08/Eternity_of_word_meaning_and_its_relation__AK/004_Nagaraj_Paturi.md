**\> Is the idea that word, meaning and their relation are eternal, just true for Sanskrit language words or is it true for any word of any language?**

  

**\> Also is this word-meaning sameness only true for Sanskrit words or all words?**

**  
**

All these theories in the shaastraslike Vyaakarana (articulated in Vaakyapadeeyam) are universal(ist). They are intended to be applicable speech /language as a universal phenomenon but not to a specific language like Sanskrit.

The meaning of 'eternal' here for the word nitya is a little problematic.

  

The word nitya in fact means natural and not artificial.

  

"Sound meaningful or meaningless is felt to be produced but is in fact just being made to be felt while always being there, just like a fan makes the air felt that was there in before / without the fan waving." is the analogy given.

  

Meanings are not produced by words, but are communicated through words. Meanings exist before the words communicating them are made to be heard through the speaker. Speaker's repeated process of attributing /assigning such 'made to be heard' sounds to the already existing meanings creates a convention of inseparable = accurate/exact relationship between a meaning and the word-sound assigned to it. A word having only one meaning or a meaning being able to be communicated through only one word is this inseparable = accurate/exact relationship. Since this inseparable = accurate/exact relationship is the reason for viewing sound as the audible form taken by meaning and meaning as the mental form taken by the audible sound. That is the idea behind the nityatva of the s'abdaarthasambandha.
