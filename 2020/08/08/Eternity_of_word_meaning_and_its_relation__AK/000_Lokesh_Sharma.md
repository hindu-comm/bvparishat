नमोनमः  

  

Years ago I heard an Acharya teaching Ashtadhyayi on youtube saying that शब्द (word), अर्थ (meaning) and their relation, these three are eternal. This is counter intuitive because we all think of words as something we invent ourselves to point out a certain meaning. Since words are created by us how can they be eternal? This doubt has stayed with me for years.

  

Upon doing some research I found a book Vakyapadia by Shri Bhartihari which says the same thing. Additionally it also states that there is no difference between words and their meanings. While we think of words as sounds or some symbol, Shri Bhartihari says they are not merely references BUT THE SAME AS THEIR MEANING.

  

Same thing is said byभगवत्पाद आदि शंकराचार्यin his commentary of Mandukya Upanishad. He says:  
  
**Though the name and the object signified by the name are one and the same**, still the explanationhas been given (here) by giving prominenceto the name (*Aum*). Though in the Upaniṣadic passage,—“*Aum,*this word, is all this”—explanation has been furnished by giving prominenceto the name (*Aum*), the same thought is again expounded by giving prominence to the thing signified by the name. **The object is to realize the knowledge of the oneness of the name and the thing signified by it.** **Otherwise, (the explanation) that the knowledge of the thing is dependent on the name, might suggest that the oneness of the name and the thing is to be taken only in a figurativesense**.

  

(Source:<https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/mandukya-upanishad-karika-bhashya/d/doc143593.html>)

  

Notice the last line, its is made clear that this oneness is not figurative.

  

Recently I came across an article which states that this idea of word, meaning and their relation being eternal is also mentioned in Nirukta.

  

Then I came across an article which states Yaska point of view mentioned In Nirukta:  

After explaining the evolution of speech; and, the fourfold stages of speech, Yaska takes up the question: — ‘whether the words are eternal or ephemeral, merely created for the time being’.

Besides the issue of the eternity of words, Yaska also talks about the infallibility of Vedic words, the impermanence of human knowledge etc., –*karmasampattir mantro Vede*– Nir.I.2.;*Purusa vidya nityatvat*–*[Nir.I.2](http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/1_veda/5_vedang/3_pratis/niruktau.htm)*

**Yaska asserts that the word, the meaning and their mutual relations are eternal (*nityam vacanam*)*.***

Yaska brushes aside the prima facie view (*Purva-paksha*) or the objections raised by Audumbarayana and such others; and, argues: If we admit the impermanence of words, then the mutual relation and the grammatical relation of words are not possible. Therefore, the functions of words are possible only if we admit they are everlasting, in their nature.

**Following the Mimamsakas, Yaska also supported the doctrine of the eternal nature of the words –*‘vyaptimattvat tu sabdasya’*(*[Nir.I.2](http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil/1_sanskr/1_veda/5_vedang/3_pratis/niruktau.htm)*)**

**(Source:**<https://sreenivasaraos.com/2019/12/31/yaska-and-panini-part-one/>)  

So, after confirming that this idea of eternity of word, meaning and their relation is supported by Shastras I have the following two questions:

  

**Is the idea that word, meaning and their relation are eternal, just true for Sanskrit language words or is it true for any word of any language?**

**  
**

**How can the word and meaning be the same thing? A word may simply have many meanings, similarly a meaning may be referred by many words. This makes this theory of oneness of name and meaning counter-intuitive. Also is this word-meaning sameness only true for Sanskrit words or all words?**

**  
**I would be very grateful if someone can answer the above questions.

  

Thank You
