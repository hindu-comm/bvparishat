Namamsi,

Sorry for the late reply  
Sri Vadiraja Tirtha , a prestigious writer in the dvaita philosophy quotes from this Hanumannataka in his Mahabharatha Tatparya Nirnaya BhavaPrakashika, Adhyaya 3.

When I asked about this to PadmaSri Dr Bannanje Govindacharya (when his MBTN Nirnaya Bhava Prakashika was released) he stated that this is an interpolation in Vadiraja's grantha and he gave me an old copy of Hanumannataka , which he feels is the best edition.  
  
I have the hard copy of the old book, through what medium can I send it to you??  
  
Thanks and Regards  
P R Sharma
