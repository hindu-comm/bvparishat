Namaste  

  

There is a book in Kannada called Pradosha Pooja. In that book there is a story given for every day of the week.The stories may be from some Puranas. The story will be read after Pooja. The story will say what Phala it will give.

  

The Pradosha on Monday, Tuesday and Saturday is very special.
