namo vidvadbhyaH,

Itâ€™s a test where a random anuvAkam within the taittirIya samhitA is selected and given to the competitor and they have to say 250 words, pada style, no repeating of words. In the second video one student says it so fast that the chief judge asks him to slow down because it was difficult for them to keep up the count! The students just sit there for a bit and know exactly where to stop! So nice to watch. The description and the commentary are in Tamil though. I was discussing the pada pATha with my guru and he told me about this kind of competition and also sent me the links. He mentioned that it can also be done with the brAhmaNam in which case 100 sentences would have to be said. The videos show only the samhitA version.
