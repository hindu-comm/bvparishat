Sushri Rucha Kelkarji,

Jai Shri Ram!

\<Any more suggestions and inputs are most welcome.>

You may as well try "Bhagvadgita In the Light of Kashmir Shaivism" by Swami Lakshmanjoo, whichhas Chapters 1 to 6 available at

<https://ia800803.us.archive.org/22/items/BhagavatGitaInTheLightOfKashmirShaivismSwamiLakshmanJoo/Bhagavat%20Gita%20-%20In%20the%20Light%20of%20Kashmir%20Shaivism%20-%20Swami%20Lakshman%20Joo.pdf>

Then of equal interest could be the commentary by the well known Acharya Abhinavgupta

[https://www.ayco.it/index.phpoption=com_dropfiles&format=&task=frontfile.download&catid=963&id=0BwEwR7MZZMxITjhvU2JoS1hNeVk&Itemid=1000000000000](https://www.ayco.it/index.php?option=com_dropfiles&format=&task=frontfile.download&catid=963&id=0BwEwR7MZZMxITjhvU2JoS1hNeVk&Itemid=1000000000000)  

Similarly, Bhagvadgita with the commentary of Rajanaka Ramakantha can be had at

<https://archive.org/details/TheBhagavadgitaWithTheComentaryCalledSarvatobhadraRajanakaRamakantha>  

All these commentaries/commentators have a contrarian view to that of
Aadi Shankara that Samnyasa is a must for getting moksha.

Similarly, the well known B G Tilak's "Gita Rahasya" is available for download at

<https://archive.org/details/SrimadBhagavadGitaRahasya-BgTilak-Volumes1And2>

I am sure you must be aware of Dnyaneswhari/Jnyaneswhari---Bhavartha Dipika--- by Sant Jnyaneshwar which is available in English at

<https://estudantedavedanta.net/Sri-Jnandevas-Bhvartha-Dipika-Jnaneswari_smaller.pdf>  

There have been translations/commentaries by Vinobha Bhave and Mahatma Gandhi, just to name a couple of them, which are freely available.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
