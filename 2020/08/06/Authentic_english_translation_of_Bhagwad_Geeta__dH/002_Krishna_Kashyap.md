namaste,

  

if you want to get an idea of Bhagavad-gita as per Sri Ramanujacharya, a simple book from S.S Raghavachar "Ramanuja on Gita"gives a good overview.

  

<https://www.amazon.com/Ramanuja-Gita-S-S-Raghavachar/dp/8175051205>

  

Translation by Adidevananda is also a good book.

I guess the big problem in learning using the English medium is that the terms dharma, karmayoga, paapa, jivatma, atma etc. do not make much sense in English, since they have different meanings with a different Abrahamic twist to these terms. If you have guidance, then it will help.

  

Incidentally, I am currently teaching a course on Gita in English comparing various bhashyas with a 'samanvaya dristi'. My teacher Sri K.S Varadachar believes that these three systems are very close to each other. I have attempted to teach the three bhashyas for the first 3 chapters. However, as the classes progressed, the students became confused since it is very hard to understand Gita from different viewpoints while learning for the first time. They asked me to "stick to Sri Ramanujabhashyafirst so that they get a good feel for the system and then after finishing Ramanujabhashya for 18 chapters, come back and describe the nuances in Sri Shankarabhasyaand Sri Madhvabhasya for chapters 4 and onwards". Tocover 4 chapters, it took us roughly 45 lectures (approximately 45 hours).
