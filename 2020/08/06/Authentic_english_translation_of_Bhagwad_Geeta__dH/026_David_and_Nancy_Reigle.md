Dear Sri Nagarajan Krishnamurthy,

  

Yes, this is the first edition of the book that I was referring to, published in 1905. Bhagavan Das (1869-1958) continued to revise it, with the second edition in 1926, the third edition in 1940, and the fourth edition in 1950. For the fifth edition in 1962, after the death of Bhagavan Das, K. Kunjunni Raja updated the Sanskrit transliteration and punctuation. The sixth edition in 1973 appears to be a photographic reprint of the fifth edition. Nancy and I used the sixth edition for our study. The 1979 edition was called the 7th printing, and in it the 1973 edition was called the second edition (rather than the sixth edition). There was a ninth printing in 2005. The current 2019 edition can be ordered here: <http://www.adyarbooks.com/tb0041_bhagavad-gita-sanskrit-text-word-word-translation-and-free-translation_paperback>. A biography of Bhagavan Das was published in 1970, titled Bharat-Ratna: Dr. Bhagavan Das Remembered by His Son Sri Prakasa. Nancy and I feel forever indebted to Bhagavan Das for this excellent work on the Bhagavad Gita.  

  

Best regards,
