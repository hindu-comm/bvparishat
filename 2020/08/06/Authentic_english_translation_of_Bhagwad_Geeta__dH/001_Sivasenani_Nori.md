Namaste

  

Bhagavadgita has been interpreted differently from Sankaracharya to modern authors / philosophers and there is no broad agreement as to what is "authentic". If you already follow a particular sampradaaya, searching for the best translation within that sampradaaya would help. If not, the usual advice is to follow the same sampradaaya as your elders / family till you know more.

  

Coming to Sankaracharya's commentary, the English translation by Swami Gambhirananda (of both Gita and the commentary of Sankara) is the most authentic because Swamiji gave priority to fidelity to original and not to other aspects such as elegance, fluidity, ease of comprehension or explanation of the commentary.
