Thank you for your elaborate reply!

  

There is translation of Bhagwad Geeta by ISKCON as well. With all the due respect to ISKCON, people have an opinion that the translation is biased and not the way it shouldbe. You explanation covers this aspect.

  

Have you heard aboutthis review of Bhagwad Geeta translation by ISKCON before? Could you commenton it?

  

Thanks and regards
