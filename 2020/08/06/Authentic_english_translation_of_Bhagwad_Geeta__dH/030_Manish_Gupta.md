Lord Shri Krishna has said mantras in Gita, to Arjun, from the highest state of consciousness based on the knowledge of his "yog bal".
Similarly our Vedas and Upanishads were written after several years of Tapasya. Some performedtapasya for 10 years, 20 years, 40 years, and some did Tapasya even more than 100 years, etc. The mantras that they have written were through the lens of Atma and not through the lens of mind and intellect. It is because they knew the art of dissolvingtheir mind/ praana into its source of origin (unless you know this one cannot sit in meditation for so long,if he / she is doing an honestTapasya). Unfortunately, in today's world people are simply trying to understand our scriptures(Gita, Upanishad, ved) mantra through the lens of their intellect, mind and imagination. No wonder 100 people, 100 opinions. That is why one finds a translation of a given mantra in Gita contradictsanothermantra.

  

It is equivalent to saying that If I have written my PhDthesisafter years of experiments (tapasya) and If I hand over my thesis to a high school student then I am sure he will perhaps be not able to understand it completely (in majority of the cases). There is no denying the fact that he will understand something but he cannot understand completely and the essence of the thesis will not be clear to him unless he/she has had an extraordinarily Adhyatmik Anubhav since childhood, which is rare.

  

Unfortunately that's what is going on now. Our rishis/maharishi have done several years of Tapasya. And their entire experience of Tapasya has been written in just two line mantra. Majority of Vedic mantras have unique Rishi. So to understand their mantras and its "bhavarth", in complete meaning, people need to do some tapasya then only real essence will come out upon translation. Else confusion will persist forever!

  

Kind regards,

Manish
