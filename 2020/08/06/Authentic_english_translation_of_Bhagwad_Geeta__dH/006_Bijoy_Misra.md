A literal translation is always wrong. Certain concepts and hence words have no foreign language equivalent.

You may read the translated texts by Sri Aurobindo where I began my Gita. It is still in print and is fairly compact.

His essays on the Gita are also excellent for their elegant language and analytic expressions.  

But don't stay by reading the book, you must proceed to read the original and feel the beauty of the language

and the grandeur of the Gita cosmology. A little effort would make life blissful, never imagined.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
