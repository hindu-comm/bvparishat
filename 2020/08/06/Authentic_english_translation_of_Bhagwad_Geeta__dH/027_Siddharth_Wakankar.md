Dr. Bhagvan Das also wrote an excellent book, titled,Fundamental Unity of Religions,which was published by the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan,Mumbai.

  

His son Shri Prakash was the first Governor of Maharashtra in 1960.

  

After laying down his office, he went to pay his respects to Veer Vinayak Damodar Savarkar at his residence in the Shivaji Park area of Dadar in Mumbai.

I saw this meeting with my wide open eyes( as I was staying near Savarkar Sadan).Savarkar asked him why you did not meet me before.His reply was: I was appointed by the Congress Govt.,so,the rest will be easily understood by all.

  

This is just for the information of those who may have interest in this small but historically important detail/event.
