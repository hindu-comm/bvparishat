Dear Rucha,

  

The verse-by-verse translation and explanation of The Gita by Swami Chinmayananda is somethingthat I foundtremendously useful. The vigour of The Gita (it was, afterall, delivered on a battlefield and was not an escapist doctrine) is broughtout fully by Swamiji. The Chinmaya Mission would have the video recordings of Swamiji's lectures on The Gita.

  

One other thing I learnedabout The Gita through experience (needless to say, it was only a personal experience, others can have a different view) is that it needs to be *taught*. Attempts at self-learning didn't go too far in my case and made mefeel lost in the labyrinththat The Gita can be if one doesn't grasp it's basic architecture/worldview. Attending Saturday Gita classes at the Chinmaya Mission where about 45 mins. to 1 hour of Swamiji's explanation of the verse(s) of the day, alongwith reinforcing the previous week's learning, made a world of difference.

  

If you do join such a class at the Chinmaya Mission, please make sure they play the video recordings of Swamiji's verse translations and explanations of The Gita. Like I have said, the full vigour of The Gita comes through in his talks. Swami Tejomayanda'stranslations and explanationsof The Gita too are very, very good. He conducts talks on The Gita all over thecountry. If you have an opportunity to attend such a *pravachan*, it can provide tremendousclarity on The Gita,in Swamiji's unassuming and affable manner.

  

Best wishes,

Sumant.
