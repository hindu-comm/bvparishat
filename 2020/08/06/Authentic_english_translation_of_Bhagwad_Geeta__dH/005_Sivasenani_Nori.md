What some call as 'bias' is really reading a text segment in a certain way to yield a certain meaning, or to classify different parts of text as the main teaching and arthavaada. All schools do this to some extent or other.

  

So, as an Advaitin if I call the Bhagavadgita-as-it-is (the ISKCON translation) as biased, it does not serve any purpose.

  

ISKCON has done more than anyone else to promote Bhagavadgita around the world, esp. outside India. They were the first ones to make rich resources on Bhagavadgita available freely on the internet till IITK's Gita Supersite provided wider coverage. And they built such lovely temples all around the world. I would rather celebrate those aspects of ISKCON even while respectfully disagreeing on doctrinal issues.  
  
One of the most important aspects about Bhagvadgita, often forgotten, is that it is the last text to study in Vedanta, not the first text. Let me elaborate.

  

In the Prasthanatraya, first Upanishads need to he studied. These are the basic texts.

  

Second, one studies the Brahmasutras, the critical study of Upanishads.

  

Then, finally one studies Gita. Gita is about applying the knowledge gained to a real life situation. Then and now. Thus it is a masterclass in arriving at the same conclusion - yuddhasva, fight - whichever way one reasons. Because it presents different point of view, it can get confusing. Even the greatest and most fortunate of all students, Arjuna got confused and says "Krishna, you teach both Karmayoga and Karmasannyasa. This is confusing. Please tell me which one is better". \*

  

So, as Sriman Krishna Kashyap said, it is easy to get confused, when studying Gita. To ensure that one grasps the ekavaakyataa (doctrinal unity) of Gita, it is important to follow only one system initially. It is best to start with the system to which one has least resistance - - the sampradaaya that one was exposed to earlier.

\* The opposition between Karma and Karmasannyasa is not real. Karmasannyasa is giving up desire for result of karma, not giving up karma. So karma needs to be done, but without phalaapekshaa.
