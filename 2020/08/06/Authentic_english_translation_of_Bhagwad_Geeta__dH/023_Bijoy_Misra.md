Friends,  

Here is little self-publicity.

Fifteen years ago, I helped to produce a book on the Bhagavadgita for the MIT students

collaborating with late Swami Sarvagatananda of Ramakrishna Vedanta Society in Boston.

I learn that the book is in print. I saw it listed in Exotic India book store.

<https://www.exoticindiaart.com/usd/book/details/sri-krishna-yoga-IDF643/?gclid=CjwKCAjwmrn5BRB2EiwAZgL9ogA391DlA_u8sj412Ol8B1oI1yDv8vhO3EXvrbiqWrFqeRLZq6N3wBoCeJoQAvD_BwE>  

The book may serve as a guide in daily professional life for technical people.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
