Along with Gambhiranandaji's translation of Gita with bhAShya, which is already suggested by Senaniji but a difficult read unless you have studied bhAShya earlier, I also suggestRamasukhadas ji's Sadhaka Sanjivani. Other great reads are Jnaneshvari (said to be Jnaneshvara, Krishna Himself, teaching Krishna's Gita words) or Gudarthadipika, former easier than the latter. They are all available in English.

  

Kind rgds,
