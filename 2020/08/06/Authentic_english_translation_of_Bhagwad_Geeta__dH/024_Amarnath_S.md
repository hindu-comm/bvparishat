Namaste,

  

  Two English translations I have referred to are these:

  

1\. By Dr. S Radhakrishnan, Former President of India. Here, Dr. Radhakrishnan quotes from the Upanishads and other important references for many of the shlokaas. Also gives an elaborate Introductory Essay.<https://www.amazon.in/dp/8172238983/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_kG1lFbQ7DPD9J>

  

2\. BhagavadgeethaTattvavivechani, by Gita Press, Gorakhpur. This has detailed explanations for each shloka. Have referred to this book for my short talks on the Bhagavad Gita.
<https://www.amazon.in/dp/B07KB2V795/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_-H1lFbCMW6WF8>
This is available in many Indian languages also like Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, etc.

  

Thanks and Regards

\- amar
