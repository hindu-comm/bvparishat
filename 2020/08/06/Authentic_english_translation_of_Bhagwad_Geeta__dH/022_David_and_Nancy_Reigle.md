Like many of you, I have accumulated quite a few translations of the Bhagavad Gita over the years. Deena Bandhu Pandey had mentioned the one by Annie Besant. There is an edition of this made jointly by her and Bhagavan Das. It includes the Sanskrit text in devanagari, Annie Besant's English translation (made with the help of four Sanskrit pandits), and word by word meanings by Bhagavan Das. I have found this latter feature to be extremely helpful for learning the Sanskrit of the Bhagavad Gita through the use of English.

  

The word by word meanings given by Bhagavan Das in this edition differ from some other word by word meanings in other translations in the following ways: They retain the word order as found in the verses of the Bhagavad Gita, rather than rearranging the words. This can help one to try to think the meaning of the verse as it was written. They usually try to give the basic meaning of the word rather than the contextual meaning. Thus, the English equivalents given by Bhagavan Das in his word by word meanings often differ from the English terms found in Annie Besant's translation. This is helpful when seeing the same word in other contexts. They usually try to give the same grammatical form in English as in Sanskrit. Thus, for example, a Sanskrit bhute krdanta or past passive participle is usually given by Bhagavan Das as an English past passive participle, and so on. This can help one to identify the grammatical form of a particular Sanskrit word. The traditional vigraha or analysis of compounds is given, filling in the elided case endings and spelling out how to understand the compound. This is an especially helpful feature.  

  

This edition also includes a brief introduction to Sanskrit grammar, and a complete word index. I suppose it is available online somewhere, or it can be ordered from the Theosophical Publishing House, Adyar, Chennai (Madras). Since there is no single authentic English translation of the Bhagavad Gita, as indicated in the excellent replies, it may be good to try to access the original Sanskrit through the English word by word meanings given by Bhagavan Das.
