Namaste,

  

It's scary but true!

  

There's nothing like an authentic version. If there was one, it would have & should have stopped at one!

  

There are innumerable versions, each one claiming to be authentic :-)

  

As one esteemed scholar Siva Senani mentioned, it's about the purpose of studying Bhagavadgītā.

  

As it's, Bhagavadgītā has to be learnt at 3rd stage for the purpose of NIDIDHYĀSANAM, after ŚRAVAŅAM & MANANAM, through Upanishads & Brahma Sūtras respectively.

  

However, in today's age, most seekers start with Bhagavadgītā and look upon it as a source of all the three, viz., ŚRAVAŅA-MANANA-NIDIDHYĀSANAM.

  

Hence, one needs to look into the purpose of choosing Bhagavadgītā.

  

If it's for an academic purpose, then it's better to learn Samskritam & start afresh!

  

If application is of primary importance, take up any random translation of 16th chapter's first four Ślokas and practice them for the rest of the life.

  

Automatically, you'll be able to drop even the Vedas as well and be able to reach the heights of human potentials :-)

  

One friend of mine during a discussion of Bhagavadgītā told me - Swaroop, it takes me an entire life to practice & perfect honesty. I'll consider Bhagavadgītā for upcoming births :-)
