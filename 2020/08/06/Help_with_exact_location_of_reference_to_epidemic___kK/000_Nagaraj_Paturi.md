This question reached us on another list when it was raised by a Dutch author.

  

This reference seems to be widespread many publications. But exact Canto number and verse number are not to be seen in the sources that I checked.

  

" When rats fall from the roof and die people (have to ) vacate their villages " --- Srimad Bhagavata Purana

  

Does any one know /remember the exact location in the Bhagavata Purana where it occurs ?

  

Thanks in advance for help in this regard.
