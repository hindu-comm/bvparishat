Dear all,

  

Greetings from DoP and DoL, MAHE!

  

The occasion of World Samskrit Day inspires the Department of Philosophy and the Department of Languages at MAHE to jointly extend the celebration throughout the semester by hosting the*Samskrit Across Borders*lecture series. We welcome you to thefirst lecture*Linguistic Propinquities of Sanskrit and Latvian - Representant**o**f Baltic Language*byNatalija Abrolaon**Saturday, 8 August, 15.30 IST**. You may please find the invitation attached.

  

The lecture will provide insights into the linguistic structures of two Indo-European languages: Sanskrit and Latvian (a Baltic language). It will illustrate the prominent similarities between Sanskrit and the Baltic representant – Latvian. Although geographically they seem to be disconnected, the striking similarities between the Indian classical language Sanskrit and Latvian language as well as ancient Baltic culture have paved way for the debates on historical and archaeogenomic analysis.  



Natālija Abrola presently holds an Erasmus+ scholarship at the South Asia Institute (SAI), of the Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg, Germany as part of her ongoing research on Mythological deities in Rigveda and Latvian Folklore conducted at the University of Latvia. She had also been a project coordinator of the Ayurveda, Yoga and Sangita lexicon development project at the UL International Institute of Indic Studies, University of Latvia, Latvia.
