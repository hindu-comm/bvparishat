Lovely Stotra, fit for bhajans also. You are not Aniketa, your niketana is He!

I did not follow what is दरिद्रदोष, may be you meant दारिद्र्यदोष. Is poverty a dosha=fault?  
I enjoy reading your poems as always.

If you do not mind let us know about your work at Cornell, may be through a poem!

  

Best..

RN Iyengar
