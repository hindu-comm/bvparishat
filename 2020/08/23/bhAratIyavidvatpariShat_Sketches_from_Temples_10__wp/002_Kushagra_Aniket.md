Dear Shri Iyengar Ji,

  

Thank you very much for your kind appreciation!

  

My intention was दरिद्रदोषः=दरिद्राणां दोषः where दोषः=affliction, unfortunate state.

  

However, I see your point and have now decided to change it to दरिद्रदैन्यमोचनम्. Ten years ago, my vocabulary was indeed limited.

  

Regarding my work at Cornell, I graduated from the university five years ago and have been working since then.

  

Thank you,

Kushagra
