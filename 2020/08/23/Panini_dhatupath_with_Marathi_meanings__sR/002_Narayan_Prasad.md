\<\<I appreciate if somebody points mePanini dhatupath with Telugu or English meanings.>\>

  

Long back I prepared Panini dhatupatha with Hindi and the corresponding parallel English meanings taken from different Sanskrit dictionaries. It was incorporated in theगणकाष्टाध्यायी software by Dr Shivamurthy Swamiji:

However, since long this has become stagnant. His paninigroup also is inactive since long.
