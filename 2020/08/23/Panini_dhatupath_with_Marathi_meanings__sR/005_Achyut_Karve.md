Dear Rao,

  

Thank you for the reference.

  

The book is available on Amazon but the facsimile of the cover is in English. This creates a doubt whether the contents are in Devanagari or Latin script. I could not find a scanned copy of the book online.

  

Thank you once again.

  

Withregards,

Achyut Karve.
