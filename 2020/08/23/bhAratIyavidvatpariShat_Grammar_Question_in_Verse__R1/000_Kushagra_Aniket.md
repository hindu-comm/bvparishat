Dear Scholars,  
  
I have a question regarding the grammatical accuracy of अतुलितबलधामम् in the famous verse "अतुलितबलधामं हेमशैलाभदेहम्..."

  

Is it correct to take अतुलितबलधामम् as अकारान्त since it is a compound? Or should it be taken as नकारान्त? If taken as नकारान्त because धामन् is नकारान्त, will it become अतुलितबलधामानम् in the accusative case?

  

This question has bothered some people in the past and they have even suggested editing the line asअतुलितबलधामस्वर्णशैलाभदेहम्.

  
Yours sincerely,  
Kushagra
