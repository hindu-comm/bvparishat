Dear Shri Subbu,

  

A very nice attempt at composing such a beautiful ashtakam.

  

At a couple of places,there is some influence of Marathi on it and at places,the sandhi, meter etc.berd some improvement or correction.

  

Overall,a fine poem.

  

By the way, can you give its exact location in Matunga, with building and postal address?.Am reminded of my stay in Mumbai and my days in Ruia College and our visits to friends in Matunga,some 55 years back.

  

Kindly continue this activity.

  

Best of luck.
