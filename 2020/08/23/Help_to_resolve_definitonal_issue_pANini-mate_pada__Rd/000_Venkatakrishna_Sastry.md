Namaste



**Help request**: Help requested to resolve a basic definitonal issue
related to शब्द - पद in Paninian Samskruth language.



**Question / प्रश्नः** : किमर्थं पाणिनि-मते पद-प्रकृतेः
प्रातिपदिकं- धातुः इति विभागः क्रियते? - What is the logical need for technical division of ' pratipadika and dhatu' in Paninian system?

Or stretching the question to pre-panini period, why poorvacharyas of Panini had to go for this fine division, which is accepted and adapted by ' Panini' ( according to Kashikaa commentary ?)

**Context:** The technical definition of पद comes from
सुप्तिङन्तं पदम् (1-4-14). The explanation in Kashikaa reads - सुबन्तं तिङन्तं च शब्दरूपं पदसंज्ञं भवति।

 पद has a प्रकृति at its root. The two main divisions of प्रकृति are प्रातिपदिक -धातु.

 Primary definition of प्रातिपदिक comes from - अर्थवत्- अधातुः- अप्रत्ययः- प्रातिपदिकम् (१-२-४५) . I am not going to the complexities of secondary definition inअर्थवत्- अधातुः- अप्रत्ययः- प्रातिपदिकम् (१-२-४५)

 Primary definition of -धातु. comes from - भूवादयो धातवः (१-३-१) . I am not going to the complexities of secondary definition in सनाद्यन्ता धातवः (३-१-३२)



**What I have already taken note of** :

A. The running explanation of 'Samskrutha- shabda :: Sanskrit-word (पद ) explained as 'noun- verb' does not seem to resolve the technicality and complexity of ' word as a means of meaningful unit of/for communication (अर्थवत्- and संज्ञां) needed in the general parlance of language-technology disciplines of Word-processing / Artificial intelligence (A.I) / Computational linguisitcs / Machine Translation. Word in natural language communication is generally understood as a structure and sequence of characters assoicated with a meaning . 



B. The debate has a trace back to atharvana-veda ('तथा चाथर्वणे पट()ते--"को धातुः, किं प्रातिपदिकं, कः प्रत्ययः" इति।- \[<http://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools/ashtadhyayi/vyakhya/1/1.2.45.htm>
- Tattva bodhini\]

and connection to other vedanga disciplines like Nirukta.



C. I am limiting this seeking to the specificity of 'Langauge:Samskrutham in Paninian frame work'. Pl. do not jump this discussion to Universal grammar models of Chomsky and others.





**Challenging issue/s: **I am looking for alignment of Samskrutham language related basic concepts and models as presented in Panini and as used in Sanskrit- Language-Technology research groups.

The definitional clarity on to
शब्द - पद in Paninian frame work is giving a hard time.



**Why I see this as an important issue**? Any erring in understanding and application of Panini (circa 700 BCE) ***and*** inaccurate -inappropriate language -modeling and application of Panini has serious impact on getting clarity in understanding primary Sanskrit resources of Indian heritage- culture composed using language grammar standards
in post paninian period.



 More specifically the understanding of 'Acahrya -bhashya's on Gita' gets in to muddle. \[ Again I am limiting this view to post Panini period. The triad of Prasthana-Traya comes in pre-paninian period, in different time segmetns and contexts. Understanding pre-paninian period Samskrutham is shrouded in opinion-silos of colonial, oriental and tradiitonal views, with water tight compartment on
'langauge-modeling- issues'. \].



**Technical position of Commentators on this issue ( for the interested) **: अर्थवत्, शब्दरूपं प्रातिपदिकसंज्ञं भवति, धातुं प्रत्ययं च वर्जयित्वा। … अनर्थकस्य अपि निपातस्य प्रातिपदिकसंज्ञा इष्यते ( काशिका) चतुष्टयी शब्दानां प्रवृत्तिर्भवति (न्यासः) भू इत्येवम् आदयः शब्दाः क्रियावचना धातुसंज्ञा भवन्ति। ....... **धातुशब्दः पूर्वाचार्यसंज्ञा**। **ते च क्रियावचनानां संज्ञां कृतवन्तः। तदिह अपि पूर्वाचर्यसंज्ञाश्रयणात् क्रियावाचिनाम् एव भूवादीनां धातुसंज्ञा विधीयते। (काशिका**) -- अर्थशब्दो हि प्रयोजनवचनोऽप्यस्ति, यथा-- अनेनार्थनागतः, अनेन प्रयोजनेनेति गम्यते। निवृत्तिवचनोऽप्यस्सि, यथा-- मशकारर्थो धूम इति, मशकनिवृत्त्यर्थ इति गम्यते। धनवचनोऽप्यस्ति,यथा--अर्थवान् देवदत्त इति, धनवानिति गम्यते। अभिधेयवचनोऽप्यस्ति, यथा-- अस्य वचनस्यायमर्थ इति, इदमस्याभिधेयमिति गम्यते। इह त्वभिधेयवचनस्यैव ग्रहणम्। तत् पुनरभिधेयं जातिगुणक्रियाद्रव्यभेदेन चतुर्विधम्।अत एव चतुष्टयी शब्दानां प्रवृत्तिर्भवति। (न्यासः)-- अनर्थकस्यापि धातोर्विद्यमानत्वात् यथा-- "इङ अध्ययने" (धा।पा।१०४६), "इक् स्मरणे" (धा।पा।१०४७) इति-- एतयोरधिपूर्वयोरेवार्थवत्त्वम्, न केवलयोः। यस्तु गणपाठेऽनयोरर्थनिर्देशः, स समुदायार्थमवयवेऽध्यारोप्य कृत इति वेदितव्यम्। अध्यारोपितार्थयोरपि तयोर्गणपाठसामथ्र्याद्धातुसंज्ञा भवत्येव।

**Word Definitions currently prevelant from english langauge backdrop: **: word noun- 1. a single distinct meaningful element of speech or writing, used with others (or sometimes alone) to form a sentence and typically shown with a space on either side when written or printed. 2. a command, password, or signal. ;
(<https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/word> ) Language - unit: a single unit of language that has meaning and can be spoken or written. ; ( <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word> ) In linguistics, a word of a spoken language can be defined as the smallest sequence of phonemes that can be uttered in isolation with objective or practical meaning. For many languages, words also correspond to sequences of graphemes ("letters") in their standard writing systems that are delimited by spaces wider than the normal inter-letter space, or by other graphical conventions. The concept of "word" is usually distinguished from that of a morpheme, which is the smallest unit of speech which has a meaning, even if it will not stand on its own. In many languages, the notion of what constitutes a "word" may be mostly learned as part of learning the writing system. This is the case of the English language, and of most languages that are written with alphabets derived from the ancient Latin or Greek alphabets. **There still remains no consensus among linguists about the proper definition of "word" in a spoken language that is independent of its writing system, nor about the precise distinction between it and "morpheme".** **This issue is particularly debated for Chinese and other languages of East Asia**, and may be moot\[clarification needed\] for Afro-Asiatic languages.



There have been many proposed criteria for identifying words. **However, no definition has been found to apply to all languages**.Dictionaries categorize a language's lexicon (i.e., its vocabulary) into lemmas. **These can be taken as an indication of what constitutes a "word" in the opinion of the writers of that language**. The most appropriate means of measuring the length of a word is by counting its syllables or morphemes. When a word has multiple definitions or multiple senses, it may result in confusion in a debate or discussion.



Semantic definition : Leonard Bloomfield introduced the concept of "Minimal Free Forms" in 1928. Words are thought of as the smallest meaningful unit of speech that can stand by themselves.This correlates phonemes (units of sound) to lexemes (units of meaning). However, some written words are not minimal free forms as they make no sense by themselves (for example, the and of). Some semanticists have put forward a theory of so-called semantic primitives or semantic primes, indefinable words representing fundamental concepts that are intuitively meaningful. **According to this theory, semantic primes serve as the basis for describing the meaning, without circularity, of other words and their associated conceptual denotations**.







Thanks in advance for the help.
