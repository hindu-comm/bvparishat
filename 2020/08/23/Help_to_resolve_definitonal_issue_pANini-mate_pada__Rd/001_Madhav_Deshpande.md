Dear Sastry Ji,

  

  When you refer to the view of Linguistics, could you please refer to specific works in modern linguistics that you have in mind? Your reference to Bloomfield 1929 is 90 years old. Do you have any more recent work in linguistics in your mind? As far as I know, this field has been continuously evolving in multiple branches, and there may be more recent relevant work. Perhaps, Professor Amba Kulkarni or Malhar Kulkarni can shed further light on this issue. With best regards,
