Namaste



1. I am placing two references of interest in this matter. The latter definitions does not go much beyond the previous noted position. We are discussing some thing s that is at least a few centuries old.



 The unlocking of wisdom in Samskruth should not lead to a self-defeating position where it leads to colonial control through
corporatised machines over Bharateeya sampradaya.



( I am addresing the issue and seeking clarification. I am not on confrontation line. I want to keep good friendship with all scholars. I am open to learning and suggestions from ' poorva-suri's.

 I have had my interactions with both Dr. Amba ji and Malhar Kulkarni earlier.

As the saying goes, I may be playing the role of fool, who rush in where angels fear to tread (Alexander Pope in his 1711 poem An Essay on Criticism. ).

[https://sanskritlinguistics.blogspot.com/2013/01/disruptive-nature-of-technology.html](https://sanskritlinguistics.blogspot.com/2013/01/disruptive-nature-of-technology.html) - The blog post of 2013 :

पदवाक्यप्रमाणशास्त्रेभ्यः (व्याकरणमीमांसान्यायादिभ्यः) अर्थनिर्धारणार्थानां विधिकल्पानां प्रकाराणाञ्च (Algorithms and methods for determining meanings) सङ्कलनम् अत्र ।

Language, in other words the storehouse of all human Knowledge is represented by words and meanings. Language by itself has an Ontological structure, Epistemological underpinnings and Grammar. Across languages, even though words /usages differ, the concept of meanings remain the same in respective communications. Yet the"Meanings"are understood by human beings based on Contextual, Relative, Tonal and Gestural basis. The dictionary meanings or 'as it is' meanings are taken rarely into consideration,thus human language is ambigious in one sense and flexible in other.  
  
**Computers on the other hand are hard-coded to go by the dictionary meanings.** **Thus teaching (programming) Computers to understand natural language (human language) has been the biggest challange haunting Scientists ever since the idea ofArtificial Intelligence (AI)came into existance**. In addition this has lead to the obvious question of"What is intelligence"from a Computation perspective. Defining intelligence precisely being impossible, this field of study has taken many shapes such as Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing and"Machine Learning"etc. Artificial Intelligence instead of being used as a blanket term, is now being used increasingly as"Analytics"in many critical applications.  
  
Sanskrit being the oldest is also the most Scientific and Structured language. **Sanskrit has many hidden Algorithms built into it as part of its vast scientific treatises, for analysing"Meanings"or"Word sense"from many perspectives since time immemorial. "It is perhaps our job to discover and convert the scientific methods inherent in Sanskrit into usable Computational models and Tools for Natural Language Processing rather than reinventing the wheel" - as some Scientists put it.** This blog's purpose is to expose some of the hidden intricate tools and methodolgies used in Sanskrit for centuries to derive precise meanings of human language, to a larger audiance particularly Computational Linguists for futher study, analysis and deployment in Natural Language Processing.  
  
In addition, Sanskrit even though being flexible as a human language, is the least ambigious as thestructure of the language is precisely difined from asemantical and syntactical point of view. From a Psycholinguistic perspective this blog could also give us a glimpse of the advanced linguistic capabilities of our forefathers as well their highly disciplined approach towards the structure and usage.
