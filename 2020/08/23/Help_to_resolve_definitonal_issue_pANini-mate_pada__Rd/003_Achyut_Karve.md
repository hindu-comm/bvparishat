Dear Vidwans,

  

In most Indian languages names are spoken as राम, कृष्ण, in nominative case singular without any suffix. Is it just hubris to just say that in Sanskrit they carry a visarga as राम:,कृष्ण:, etc. or does it have some specific significance. My question is what is it that is lacking in राम that is completed by adding a visarga? Is it purposeful or just a nuance of the Sanskrit language?

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
