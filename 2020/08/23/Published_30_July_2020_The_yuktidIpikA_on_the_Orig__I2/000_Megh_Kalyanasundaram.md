Abstract:

  

"In this article, I reconstruct the view of the*Yuktidīpikā*, the most detailed and profound commentary of classical Sāṃkhya, on the origin of the Vedas. A close reading of the text reveals that its unknown author wavered between at least two different views on this issue. The first view is that the authorless but noneternal Vedas evolve from*prakṛti*(primordial matter) at the beginning of a new cycle of existence of the world (*kalpa*) and merge into*prakṛti*during a cosmic dissolution (*pralaya*). The*Yuktidīpikā*is the first text in classical Sāṃkhya to state directly that the Vedas have no author. The second and opposite view is that Kapila is the author of the highest teaching of the Vedas. This view is expressed only indirectly. Besides reconstructing the above-mentioned views, I attempt to answer the question of whether by quoting*Nirukta*1.20 the*Yuktidīpikā*communicates something about the origin of the Vedas. Illustrating Sāṃkhya thought by quoting this passage of the*Nirukta*, as well as proclaiming the idea that the Vedas are authorless, which became the “official” standpoint of the Sāṃkhya*darśana*, can be interpreted as elements of the*Yuktidīpikā*’s pioneering project to show that Sāṃkhya is not in conflict with the Vedas."
