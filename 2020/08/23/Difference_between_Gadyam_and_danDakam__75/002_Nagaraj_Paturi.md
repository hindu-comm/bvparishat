Dandakam is a meter. Gadyam is not.

  

Quite often, the gaNas in Dandakam are in khandagati i.e., य \|UU , र UIU , त UUI pattern.

  

Unlike the other meters where there are rules of number of paadas =
lines per s'loka /padyam = stanza / verse and number of Ganas = feet for a line

  

Dandakam does not have a rule of number of lines per verse or number of feet per line.

  

It just has a, not a very strict though, rule of sequence of panchamaatraaka gaNas such as य \|UU , र UIU , त UUI pattern.

  

Gadyam is a singable 'prose' .

  

In Telugu Palkuriki Somanathudu's Aksharaanka Gadya (12th century AD) is the first available work of this genre.

  

The word Vachanamu(lu) is used in the book Simhagiri Narahari Vachanamulu (13th century AD) by Krishnamacharyulu

  

This genre is also known by the name Vinnapamulu (reports/appeals)

  

Vachanamulu in Telugu should not be confused with the Vachanagalu in Kannada.

  

Gadya/Vachanamulu/Vinnapamulu is essentially a genre of Stotra literature, while Vachnagalu is not necessarily so.

  

Gadya in Sanskrit also seems to be a genre of Stotra literature and probably the model for Gadya in Telugu.

  

Dandakam(u) is also originally a genre of Stotra literature, though new content was experimented right in the 15th century AD itself in works like Bhoginee Dandakamu , disputedly attributed to Potana, the author of the Srimat+Andhra Bhagavatamu a translation of Mahabhagavata purana.
