Thank you Prof Paturi-ji for the detailed explanation and examples!

  

I have been searching forहयग्रीव-दण्डकम्‌ (hayagrIva-daNDakaM) over the past week and

as a part of my search for, I came across this e-book:

A Descriptive Catalogue of the Sanskrit Manuscripts of the Government Oriental Manuscripts Library, Madras: Grammar, lexiocography and prosody

which too has some somedetails about दण्डकम्‌

(jpeg screenshots attached)

  

I came across "श्रीलक्ष्मीनृसिंह-प्रादुर्भाव-दण्डकं" of श्रीश्रीपादराजतीर्थ.

(shrIlakShmInR^isiMha-prAdurbhAva-daNDakaM of shrI shrIpAdarAjatIrtha)
