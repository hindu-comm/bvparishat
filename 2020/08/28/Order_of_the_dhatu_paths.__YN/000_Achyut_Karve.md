Dear Vidwans,

  

Is there any work on why Panini chose to order the way it is and not in alphabetical order. He would well have ordered the Ganas first and then ordered the dhatus in alphabetical order..

  

In other words is there any inbuilt order in which the dhatus have been arranged in the Dhatupath.

  

With best regards,

Achyut Karve.
