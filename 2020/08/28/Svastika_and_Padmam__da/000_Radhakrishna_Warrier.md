Drawing a svastika is part of the performance of many puja-s. But in Malayalam, in the popular language, this is not called svastika. It is called padmam. The term for drawing a svastika is പദ്മം ഇടുക - padmam iṭuka = draw a padmam, literally, put or drop (iṭŭ) a padmam. But padmam is lotus. So, what is the connection between svastika and lotus?
