Dear Scholars,  
  
Here is an attempt to present the Dhyana Shloka of Sri Lord Vishu in pictorial form.  
It is meant for small kids to color the printed copy and write the translated meaning  
of each word in their native language.  
  
I'm sharing it here with an expectation to correct me and this work for any Sanskrit or  
for that sake any mistakes to make it better. End users are the Sanskrit learning kids so, would like to keep it as simple as possible. Any suggestions are most welcome.  
  
Regards,  
Sunil Nakum
