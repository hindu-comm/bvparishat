Friends,

  

I listened to a beautiful lecture by Prof Radhavallabha Tripathi

on Bhasa's *swapanvasavadatta.* Sharing

The lectures are organized by Bhandrakar Oriental Research Institute

of Pune. I learn that these free lectures on Sanskrit drama would continue  

for ten days. They are broadcast and archived through

<https://www.facebook.com/BORIPUNE>

The live broadcast starts at 6:30 PM IST.

  

Regards,

Bijoy Misra
