Namaste Varalakshmiji

It seems to be a variant under चण्डवृष्टिप्रपात. I read yesterday that 2 नगणs followed by 33 रगणs is called आनन्द but my composition has 34 रगणs. I have followed the गरुडदण्डक pattern of Shri Vedanta Deshika. I don't know if such a pattern has any specific name.

Regards

Shankar Rajaraman
