You must say that 'where sruthi statements are apparently in conflict with pratyaxa/any pramANa.

Why?

Because, if they are actually in conflict and are negated then they can not be pramANa.

So what ? Let some sruthi-s be pramANa and some apramANa!

No, since the pramANatva of whole veda-s has been accepted by those who accept it's validity.

यजमानः प्रस्तरः , ग्रावाणः प्लवन्ते etc.

The solution to this problem is that shruthi doesn't have tAtparya in those negated/opposed meanings. It says something else and hence there is no opposition/negation possible.

How can we say that?

There are signs which help us decide tAtparya of shruti, like upakrama-upasaMhAra, abhyAsa, safalatva, apUrvatA, et.c
