Takṣa (तक्ष) is an interesting word.

Takṣa (तक्ष) in Sanskrit means to cut through. Could it be from this word that the Sanskrit word takṣaka meaning carpenter originated? A carpenter is one who cuts wood and shapes it into useful things. 

Malayalam tadbhava of takṣa is taccŭ and it means carpentry or masonry work, or sometimes house construction in general. A taccaṉ is a carpenter or a mason or can even be a sculptor. Taccuśāstram is the science of house construction.

Are English words like tact, technic and texture cognates of takṣa? Are there other Indo-European cognates of takṣa?

The serpent king who bit and killed Parīkṣit had the name Takṣaka. And the famous Takṣaśila is said to be named after this very serpent king Takṣaka. Was he after all a human chieftain of a forest dwelling or aboriginal tribe (Sanskrit Nāga for forest dweller or aboriginal)? Serpent bite could be a euphemism for stealth killing.

A similar sounding Sanskrit word is dakṣa meaning capable, expert etc.
Is the English word dexterous a cognate of the Sanskrit word dakṣa?
