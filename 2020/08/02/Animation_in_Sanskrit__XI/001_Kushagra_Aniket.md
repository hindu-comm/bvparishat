Dear Dr. Muralikrishna,

  

This is a very interesting video. I hope you will be able to produce further such videos in conversationalSanskrit to provide the knowledge of Jyotisha.

  

There seems to be renewed interest in Phalita Jyotisha among the millennialpopulation. Articles in prominentnewspapers have documented this phenomenon. However, now-a-days, people usually go by the popular sun-sign (which remains the same for a month) instead of Chandra Rashi, Nakshatra, or Lagna (which last for shorter intervals). Videos like yours can change this perception.

  

Best,

Kushagra
