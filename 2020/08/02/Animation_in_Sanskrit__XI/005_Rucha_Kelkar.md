Namaskar

  

In case you are interested in getting more knowledge of astrology, you may watch videos on following channels:

  

KRSchannel- Learn Astrology

Saptarishis Astrology Magazine

Dr Arjun Pai Astrology

  

Very good information is available here. Dr Arjun Pai and KRS have made several videos together for explaining nakshatras and other aspects. I found the nakshatra videos extremelyinteresting.

  

Thanks and regards

Rucha Kelkar
