Shri Swaroop ji

Sriram garu and Paturi garu have given all salient points.

All sadhana has an implicit sankalpa ....yatha shakti. Even a person with all angas if suffering from fever cannot perform certain rituals and has to wait for good health to return.

Dirghatamas a vedic rshi was blind and frankly he 'saw' more than most who were otherwise well endowed.

Chowringhinath had all 4 limbs chopped off and attained to success through kumbaka and allied practices.

The real handicap is that of indentured intellectual cretinism of the kind you see with the Tukde tukde gang of JNU fame or certain media houses...or in U Cal Berkley.

Dhritarashtra the blind king of the kurus was a nitya agnihotri.

There is space for everyone in sanatana dharma. Just not for those lacking in the mental or moral department.

Regards

Venkat
