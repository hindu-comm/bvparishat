Namaste,

Profound thanks to all those who gave a very convincing answer. I will by giving due credits, pass on the answers to my friend who raised this question.

  

But, a new question pops up!

  

Is DIVYA-ANGA an ancient usage with references available to the same, or coined in recent times?

  

Dhanyavāda

  

Jai Hinduism!
