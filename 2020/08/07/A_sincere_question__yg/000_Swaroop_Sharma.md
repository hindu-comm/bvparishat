This is a question from a physically challenged person -

  

There are many rituals that cannnot be performed by persons with various bodily disabilities.

For instance, person who has no hands cannot form Anjali with hands or chant the shloka "Prabhate kara Darshanam". It seems cruel in their world and they have to adjust and adopt. Why so? What's the alternative?

  

Did scholars/Munis or Shastras take into consideration that there are people in the world whose body are not as it is normally understood should be.

  

Are their any literature or even a thought process?

  

Or is this community considered some bad thing and therefore they are all kept away from engaging in these godly activities or rituals?

  

This enquiry is purely academic and intention is explore the research possibilities in this domain.

  

Broadly, I've heard scholars suggesting that physically challenged aren't eligible for rituals (Samartho Yajeta). If I'm not wrong, even for Sannyāsa, physically challenged aren't accepted. Why so?
