Sri Swaroopji

Sanyasa in ancient times was very demanding physically, one had to travel on foot, through forests etc. This would be very challenging for a person who is differently abled. This could have been the reason why the ancients would have made the rule of only allowing able bodied people to take it. Similarly, somerituals could be physically demanding and would be difficultfor a physicallychallenged person.
