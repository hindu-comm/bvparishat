Namaste Sharma ji,

  

What is required is 'bhaav' irrespective of whether one is physically challenged or not.

  

We have the famous shloka :

  

**मूकं करोति वाचालंपङ्गुं लङ्घयते गिरिं । यत्कृपा तमहं वन्दे परमानन्द माधवम्**

  

The physically challenged as free to do manasika puja and naama sankeertana.

  

We have an example ofअष्टावक्रः a great jivanmukta in our scriptures. In recent times, couple of sanyasis are Guru Gangeshwarananda Maharaj Ji and Shri Ramabhadracharya Ji who are vedic & sanskrit scholars.

  

So long as one is not mentally challenged, one is free to do rituals either physically or mentally.

  

regs,

sriram
