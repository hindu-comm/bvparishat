Sri Swaroop Sharma-ji,

  

Your question is in fact very much useful to bring home olne basic principle of Hinduism.

  

Benefit of goal is not denied / said to be not reachable to anyone while path to reach that goal is described / prescribed differently to different individuals depending on the facilities available or not available in their sthoola s'areeraand / or other layers outside /sheltering the jeeva (aatman), such as agewise bodily strength, health conditions from time time, permanent physical disposition such as gender and permanent physical challenges in the limbs of the body etc. and the life style celibate, householder's , retired householder, ascetic etc.
and /or occupation agriculture ,potter, fisher, barber, priest, trader, tanner, cobbler, warrior etc. of the individual.

  

For that matter, having the bodies of non-human creatures like a spider, snake or elephant is considered to be an obstruction for getting moksha = liberation, the goal. But the paths chosen by the snake and the elephant for achieving the same goal are the functions of the facilities available in their body.

  

A differently abled person chooses a differently facilitated tool of commutation but reaches the same destination.
