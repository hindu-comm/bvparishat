Dear friends,

We have our annual folk poetry festival on August 16. Because of corona virus,

the event this year will be on zoom and we are able to include poets around

the globe. The time would be 10 AM to 1 PM. Our topic for the event is  

"Liberation" and we are looking for people who take interest in folk poetry and  

render them in melody. All languages are OK and a short summary in English  

is expected. We wish to include thirty participants and five slots are open.  

Each participant gets 5 minutes. The program video will be posted.

Please write to me directly if you wish to participate. Please send mail to

[idcin...@gmail.com]() if you want to listen in. A zoom link will be sent out  

on Friday before the event.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
