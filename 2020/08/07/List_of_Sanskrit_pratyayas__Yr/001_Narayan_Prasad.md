Hari Om!

  

These lists are not that useful for Panini scholars, because these suffixes do not indicate what additional grammatical operations are to take place with them.

A better list is given by Pt. Charudev Shastry in hisव्याकरण चन्द्रोदय, Vol.5, pp.680-687.

Since this work does not deal with the Vedic sUtras, it does not include a few suffixes found in P.3.4.9-17.

One may extract all the suffixes from Dictionary of Panini (S.M. Katre).

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
