Hare Krishna.  
  
Respected vidvaj-janas,  
  
I am searching for Mahabharata's critical edition published by BORI,  
if pdfs are available. Any help in this regard is appreciated.  
  
I could find a few of them but not all volumes on [archive.org](http://archive.org) here:  
  
३ आरण्यकपर्वम्;  
<https://archive.org/download/in.ernet.dli.2015.485852/2015.485852.The-Mahanharata.pdf>;  
510  
  
४ विराटपर्वम्; <https://archive.org/download/in.ernet.dli.2015.485885/2015.485885.The-Virataparvan.pdf>;  
430  
  
८ कर्णपर्वम्; <https://archive.org/download/in.ernet.dli.2015.485849/2015.485849.The-Mahabharata.pdf>;

Thankyou,  
Damodara Das  
  
ps. also if you think these are very old published and there are  
better editions available now, please do mention here.  
  
Also I know that on sanskritdocuments site, ready htmls are available  
in many scripts for BORI Mahabharata. However, they do not have  
footnotes mentioning many details which may be needed for research  
works.
