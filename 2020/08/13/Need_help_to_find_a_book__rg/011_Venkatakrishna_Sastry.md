Namaste



1. I agree with you on the traditional stand \< pada and krama
paaTha-s are a minimum in Vedic education along with the full texts, and handed down in a guru-siShya paramparA. .. the pada has the same validity as the samhitA. You cannot go in and change splits in words willy nilly.> , a standard violated in many veda realted research and transaltion studies !



2. Here is another ' cute story from the smArta circles' . Self explanatory. Only pada-paatha can help to understand the samhitaa properly.



संहिता: -- विरूपेभ्यो - विश्वरूपेभ्यश्च वो नमो नमो



सांप्रदायिकः पद पाठ: -- -- \< वि - रूपेभ्यः\> - \< विश्व - रूपेभ्य: \> One having distorted / special forms ; one whose form is universal/ One whose form is universe.



वैकृतिकः पद पाठ: -- -- \< वि - रूपेभ्यः\> - \< वि-
श्वरूपेभ्य: \> One having distorted / special forms ; one whose form is like the dogs.> Logic: 'Vi' -split must be uniform in the same context !



3. On \< In general the **upaniShads do not occur in the samhitA, so there is no pada pATha available**. Hence AtmAtattvamasi = AtmA atattvamasi etc., but not so in the IshA case. There is a pada pATha available.>



Padapathas have variance as acknowledged by Yudhisthira Meemaamsaka.

If some one has the following book, they can help to explain what is 'pada-patha of Ishavasya upanishat' . <https://chaukhambapustak.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=123_200&product_id=15173>

I have heard long ago the pada-patha of some of the upanishads also. It must have been some forty years now. This was a part of ' post lunch- private meets of vaidika schoalrs, in a friendly eco-system, generously interspersed with personal humor, names and relations'. I do not know as of current period whether such ' friendly meet and iscussion takes place'. No one seems to have time for thse things. so, it is just a past time recall.



The applcation of ' Upanishad related ' Ashta-Vikruti- Pathas' are meant for 'Swadhyaaya' and to be used as ' Vak-yoga- anushaasanam' under ' Mantra- Ishwara- pranidhanam'.



It is a part of the 'Antar-Yajna' / Antar-Vak-Yajna'. The key to understand this comes from Rudra prashna: ' ’ वाक्- यज्ञेन कल्पताम् । आत्मा य ज्ञेन कल्पताम् - यज्ञो यज्ञेन कल्पताम् ’.



Jnaneswari has pointers to this, at the end of the text; and these thoughts relate to an expansion of Gita 4-24: brahmarpanam brahma havir, brahmagnau brahmana hutam, brahmaiva tena gantavyam

brahma-karma-samadhina .. The 'brahma' here is explained as 'Shabda-brahma' and the outcome is Vak-yajna. Gita 4-26: provides a pointer for this as ' ***sabdadin visayan anye****": and Gita 4-28: yoga-yajnas.*



As these are not for bahir-yajna, the popular awareness of the
upanishat- padapatha seems to be less. The mystic of yoga way of learning -using Samskrutham and Veda is not thrown out to public at large . 



I look forward for more information on these issues.

Dear Subramanian-ji



The pada and krama paaTha-s are a minimum in Vedic education along with the full texts, and handed down in a guru-siShya paramparA. So yes, the pada has the same validity as the samhitA. You cannot go in and change splits in words willy nilly. In general the upaniShads do not occur in the samhitA, so there is no pada pATha available. Hence AtmAtattvamasi = AtmA atattvamasi etc., but not so in the IshA case. There is a pada pATha available.



There is a cute story in the smArta circles about the pada pATha. Apparently the great sAyaNAchArya split the word harikesha in namo harikeshAya (rudram) as hari+ka+Isha to mean the triad and hence the rudram was interpreted in an advaitic way. Apparently he was berated by a paNDita for ignoring the padam which splits the I\~Ngyam as harikeshAyeti hari-keshAya (ignoring accents) when he expounded it. The AchArya humbly accepted his mistake and changed his interpretation. It’s likely an apocryphal story, one wouldn’t expect the AchArya to not have know the pada, but does illustrate a moral.
