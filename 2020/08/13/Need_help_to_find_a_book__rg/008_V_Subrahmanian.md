Thanks for the above link and the page highlighted, of the Ishavasya Upanishad. Is this padapATha accepted by all schools of Vedanta? In an old discussion on this very Ishavasya, on the splitting 'Ishaa vaasyam' or Ishaavaasyam as a samasa, there was an opinion of a Madhva scholar that 'there is the possibility of bhrama/pramaada on the part of the Acharya (teacher) of the paaTha.' Hence the question.
