Dear Subramanian-ji

  

The pada and krama paaTha-s are a minimum in Vedic education along with the full texts, and handed down in a guru-siShya paramparA. So yes, the pada has the same validity as the samhitA. You cannot go in and change splits in words willy nilly. In general the upaniShads do not occur in the samhitA, so there is no pada pATha available. Hence AtmAtattvamasi = AtmA atattvamasi etc., but not so in the IshA case. There is a pada pATha available.

  

There is a cute story in the smArta circles about the pada pATha. Apparently the great sAyaNAchArya split the word harikesha in namo harikeshAya (rudram) as hari+ka+Isha to mean the triad and hence the rudram was interpreted in an advaitic way. Apparently he was berated by a paNDita for ignoring the padam which splits the I\~Ngyam as harikeshAyeti hari-keshAya (ignoring accents) when he expounded it. The AchArya humbly accepted his mistake and changed his interpretation. It’s likely an apocryphal story, one wouldn’t expect the AchArya to not have know the pada, but does illustrate a moral.
