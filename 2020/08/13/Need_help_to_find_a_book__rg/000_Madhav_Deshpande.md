I am looking for a publication that has the Īśāvāsya Upaṇiṣad given with its Padapāṭha. I have pdfs of the first two volumes of the Śukla-Yajurveda Kāṇva-Saṃhitā edited by B.R. Sharma and published by the Vaidika Samshodhana Mandala of Pune. But these cover only the first half of the Saṃhitā. The Īśā Upaniṣad occurs at the very end of the Saṃhitā. I would appreciate if anyone has access to the remaining volumes of this publication, or an edition of the Mādhyandina Saṃhitā with Padapāṭha, that would be greatly appreciated.
