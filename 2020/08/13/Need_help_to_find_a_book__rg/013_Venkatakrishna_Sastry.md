Namaste



1. Thanks for the clarification.



2. The challenges are much more in Krama-Patha ! where rules step in from texts beyond 'vykarana' . And interpretations draw Nirukta.



3. Suffice it to say, what we have as 'remnants of vedic resources' is a shadow of the ' referred huge volume'. And those who explore these remains are limited in number.

So we make what best sense it gives and make of availble schoalrship and tradiiton. 

Status Tag : ' Vishada yoga' is to put on this situation.



Regards
