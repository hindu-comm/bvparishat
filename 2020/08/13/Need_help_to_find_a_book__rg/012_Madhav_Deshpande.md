Dear BVK Sastry Ji,

  

  Thanks for these examples where the Padapāṭhas disagree with each other. Elsewhere I have discussed some other examples like तत्त्वा being resolved as तत् त्वा or single word तत्त्वा, and वायो taken in some Padapatha as वा यो. Patanjali says that the Padapatha should follow grammar rather than the other way around: न लक्षणेन पदकारा अनुवर्त्या: । पदकारैर्नाम लक्षणमनुवर्त्यम् । My point is simply that the Padapathas of the various Samhitas represent the earliest available analysis that we have, and they should be given due recognition in narrating the history of interpretation of a given mantra. With best regards,
