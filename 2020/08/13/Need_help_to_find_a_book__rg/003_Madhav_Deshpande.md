Dear Krishna Kashyap Ji,

  

  The reason I wish to look at the Padapāṭha is that different commentaries occasionally differ on how to split the Padas of a text.
The Padapāṭha represents perhaps the first post-Saṃhitā attempt to break the text of the Saṃhitā into Padas, and hence may possibly be older than all the commentaries we have.
