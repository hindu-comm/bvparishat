Dear Shri Subrahmanian,



  The Padapāṭha represents the oldest attempt to split the Padas of the Saṃhitā, and while the later commentators may choose to ignore it or disagree with it, the Padapāṭha points to the most ancient interpretation of the mantra. This is what I am interested in. With best regards,
