Hare Krishna.  
  
Respected Vidvaj-janas,  
  
In Bhagavatam Commentary by Vamsidhara to 5.4.13 --  
yavīyāṁsa ekāśītir jāyanteyāḥ pitur ādeśakarā mahā-śālīnā  
mahā-śrotriyā yajña-śīlāḥ karma-viśuddhā brāhmaṇā babhūvuḥ.  
  
Vamsidhara mentions about a book "vAratantu" may be written by vAratantu.  
  
I would like to get this book if anyone knows about it.  
  
Thankyou,  
Damodara Das
