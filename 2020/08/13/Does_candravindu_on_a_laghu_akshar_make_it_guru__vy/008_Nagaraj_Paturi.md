When I said 'But there is evidence to believe that the pronunciation/nasality was lost during historical /inscriptional period itself', I meant pronunciation of nasality where there is khandabindu or ardhaanusvaarais written.

  

Nasality in general in Telugu pronunciation is not absent in contemporary Telugu pronunciation.

  

Particularly in the Coastal (Central and Eastern) dialects, it is prominent even today.

  

In the scripts of plays, to guide the performers towards pronunciation, script writers borrow the khandabindu /ardhaanusvaaraof the orthography of classical Telugu into the orthography of contemporary Telugu and indicate nasality with its help.
