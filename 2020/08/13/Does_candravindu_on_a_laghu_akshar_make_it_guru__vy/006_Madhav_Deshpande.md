At least in Devanagari typography for Marathi, अँ indicates an अनुनासिक "nasal" अ, while अं indicates an अनुस्वार. As per Sanskrit grammar, The अनुनासिक short अँ is not Guru, while अ with अनुस्वार, namely अं is a Guru syllable. The writing of the so-called Ranga as Chandrabindu with a Virama sign underneathँ् \[I cannot properly type it with the fonts I have\] makes it a little confusing. However, phonetically speaking the Ranga is a contextual variant of the अनुस्वार, and hence अ+Ranga will become a Guru syllable. I don't know of any Shiksha or Pratishakhyatexts that discuss in detail the details of a writing system, and most of these texts were produced prior to the emergence of what we now recognize as Devanagari. The writing systems for Sanskrit in pre-modern India differed from Veda to Veda and from region to region.
