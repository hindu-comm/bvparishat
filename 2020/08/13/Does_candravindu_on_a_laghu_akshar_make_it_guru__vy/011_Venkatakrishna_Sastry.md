Namaste



Any study on how, why and historic impact of this ' orthography based shifts' ? Inspite of all these orthography shifts, some how the voice value of the script ' seemed' to remain the same ?!

The modern schooling systems and romanization models have made serious exists from the ' uccharana' standards. \[ The impact of which for Sanskrit is ongoing and still unassessed !\].



Similar changes have taken place in kannada and of course in multiple scripts, print and hand written manuscripts. Was it a technology issue, Scribe issue ?



Any helpful suggestions pl.



Regards
