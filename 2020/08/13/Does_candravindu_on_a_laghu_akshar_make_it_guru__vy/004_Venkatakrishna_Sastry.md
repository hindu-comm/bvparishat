Namaste



More questions:



1. Chandrabindu is given unicode value \< 0981> : ঁ. Described as Bengali sign. Will bengali language specialists help to understand
what pronnciation variation it adds to a svara ? Wold it be like part nasalization or partial anuswaara ? Would this chandrrabindu yield different values to different swaras ?



2. On the same count, if the given swara is marked udaatta or anudaatta, would it change the guru- laghu classification in chandas consideration pl? Or change in ' maatraa -kaala' for gana- measure ? ( like music??
