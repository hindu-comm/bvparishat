"Bindu or anusvaara itself is a later entry into Telugu orthography and ardhaanusvaaraor khandabinduis even later."  

  

This is interesting. I believe in modern Telugu, words such as Pāṇḍava are written with the anusvāra thus: పాండవ.

  

Were such words ever written like this: పాణ్డవ?

  

In Malayalam we never write such words with anusvāra. It is Pāṇḍava (പാണ്ഡവ) not Pāṃḍava (പാംഡവ). The exception is words with ṅg. Gaṅga is written as Gaṃga (ഗംഗ).
