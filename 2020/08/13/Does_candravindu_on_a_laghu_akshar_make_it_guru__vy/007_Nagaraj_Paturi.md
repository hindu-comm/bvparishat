The Telugu ardhaanusvaaraor khaNDabinduis just a relic of an older pronunciation reality preserved only in the writing of the classical
/graanthika form of Telugu.

  

In the classical Telugu beginning withavailability of its documentation with the verse inscriptions of the 8th and 9th centuries AD, the
ardhaanusvaaraor khaNDabinduhas been maintained in writing without an actual significance for pronunciation, hence no impact on the metrical weightof the preceding syllable.

  

Bindu or anusvaara itself is a later entry into Telugu orthography and ardhaanusvaaraor khandabinduis even later.

  

Researchers of early Telugu inscriptions opined that khandabindu or ardhaanusvaara was the written form to nasality in pronunciation of the syllables during early historical /inscriptional period and /or even earlier. But there is evidence to believe that the pronunciation/nasality was lost during historical /inscriptional period itself.
