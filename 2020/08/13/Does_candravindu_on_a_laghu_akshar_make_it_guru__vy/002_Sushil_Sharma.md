Namaste,

  

In Hindi prosody, unlike a laghu varNa with an anuswaara, a laghu varNa with a chandrabindu (which represents a nasalized vowel sound) remains a laghu only (and does not get treated as a guru varNa).  

For reference, see rule# 5 on page#2 of chhandaH prabhaakara at the link given below.
