Namaskar,

  

I have one book which might help you. I had downloaded it from [www.dlshq.org](http://www.dlshq.org), it is related to Swami Sivananda and Swami Chidananda.

  

<https://www.dlshq.org/download/download.htm#karmadisease>  

  

You will get many books on this link.

  

Thanks and regards

Rucha Kelkar
