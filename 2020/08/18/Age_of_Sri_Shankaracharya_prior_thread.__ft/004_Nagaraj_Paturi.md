I found Sri Krishna Kashyap-ji's post in response to my post :

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/zWsH5vJeTcs/6Gy2uvXOBwAJ>  

  

His post was

  

<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/zWsH5vJeTcs/eXWmnJvZBwAJ>  

  

These were part of the thread

  

<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/bvparishat/zWsH5vJeTcs/STrevgbiBwAJ;context-place=msg/bvparishat/Wyaj4PdK6g8/Vw2Qeh1GW-kJ>

  

All these posts show that he likes/enjoys the debates around this topic for some reason.

  

Only if there are any new points in this topic than those covered in the older threads, that can without leading to any ill feelings.
