My 100 comic verses on Corona \[कोरोना-विडम्बन-शतकम्\] were published in the latest issue of the journal Arvacheena Samskritam. I have continued writing more comic verses. I am aware that some comic verses have offended some readers, and I apologize if I have offended anyone's feelings. As the great Kalidasa said: परिहासविजल्पितं सखे, परमार्थेन न गृह्यतां वच:.
