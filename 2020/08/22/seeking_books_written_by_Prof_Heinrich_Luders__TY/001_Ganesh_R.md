Rajnish Rama Rao-ji,

  

Namaskara. In my lecture I have referred to Dr V S Sukthankar's outstanding work, 'On the Meaning of the Mahabharata.' In the first chapter of this work, Dr. Sukthankar answers various criticisms levelled against the Mahabharata. It was in this connection that I referred to Prof. Luders, and not independently. Motilal Banarsidass have published 'On the Meaning of the Mahabharata' and it is available. You may please read the book. Thank you.

  

With warm regards,

R. Ganesh
