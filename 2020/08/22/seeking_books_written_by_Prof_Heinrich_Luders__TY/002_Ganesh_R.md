Prof. Luders was one of the pioneers of Philology. He was Dr. Sukthankar's mentor in the University of Berlin. He edited and published many Brahmi inscriptions and also wrote a work on the Pali language. In his far-famed Prolegomena, Dr. Sukthankar has written effusively about his mentor's contribution to Mahabharata studies. You may access the Prolegomena on [archive.org](http://archive.org). Hope this helps.

  

Warm regards,

R. Ganesh
