The verse is not by Nāgeśa, certainly, but it is true that it can be found quoted by him in his

Paramalaghumañjūṣā. In the 1961 edition by Pt. Kālikāprasād Shukla, published from Baroda, this is at the top

of p. 70. The following link might work:

There was an earlier BVP thread on this verse:<https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/26d-g3s6BAE>.

There too the source was not identified.
