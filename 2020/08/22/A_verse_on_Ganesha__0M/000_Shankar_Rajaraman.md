Namaste

Happy Ganeshacaturthee to all of you. Below is a verse dedicated to the Lord of GaNas - based on the kavisamaya that pearls are found in the temples of elephants

  

जयति प्रदोषनाट्ये कुम्भोदरकीर्णमौक्तिकप्रकरः । अनुकुर्वन्निव पितरं मौलिगलितगाङ्गसीकरं गणराट् ॥  

Hail Ganesha! As pearls scatter from his temples during the evening dance, he seems to imitate his father - droplets of Ganga raining from his matter hair.

Regards

Shankar Rajaraman
