The Divine as knowledge in man is the Brahmans.

The Divine as courage and honour in man is the Kshatriya.

The Divine as creativity and harmony in man is the vaishya,

The Divine as service in man is the shudra.

‚Äú The Brahmin first ruled by the book and the ritual, the Kshatriya next by the sword and the buckler; now the vaishya governs us by machinery and the dollar, and the shudra, the liberated serf presses in with his doctrine of the kingdom of associated labour. But neither priest, king, merchant nor labourer is the true governor of humanity; the despotism of the tool and the mattock will fail like all the preceeding despotisms. Only when egoism dies and God in man governs his own human universality, can this earth support a happy and contended race of beings.‚Äù Sri Aurobindo.
