Namami

  

What are the views of Shri Aurabindo on The Gita?

  

People compare him with Vallabhacharya Shuddhadvaita. How simlar or different he is and how is his interpretation concieved by traditionalists?

  

I'd like to know his views on Jnana Karma and Bhakti, Maya and Jeeva-Brahma relation.

  

By traditional I mean does he hold a traditional view on Varnashrama, or no.

  

Just clarifying not making any judgement, i just want to know his views, where did he disagree with purvacharyas etc. What is the uniqueness and why is he such an important figure.
