Rishiji,

  

As suggested by Sriramji, to get an authentic response to your question, you should discuss it with Dr Mishra.

  

To look at Sri Aurobindo's view on the Gita for your personal progress, I can suggest something.

  

Please ask yourself or see other views on why God incarnates on the earth. After you consider it, please see what Sri Aurodindo has to say on this. A study of Sri Aurobindo's commentary on the Gita from this point of view, is time well utilised. Sri Aurobindo has something unique to say on यदा यदा ही घर्मस्य ... and if I am not mistaken, it forms the basis of his darshan.

  

Thanks.
