My friend who has studied Sri Aurobindo for a long time gave me the following answer

" Sri Aurobindo’s yoga is called Poorna Advaitha.

The problem of traditional philosophy is how to synthesise. The world(prapnca), the individual being(jiva) and the Absolute or transcendent(ishwara). Shankaras kevala advaita harmonises this issue from the Absolute point of view. Ramanujacharya from the Prapanca/ishwara point of view and Sri Madhva from the jiva point of view. Therefore their preferred emphasis gives a corresponding samanvaya. As far as Sri Aurobindo’s view on varna ashrams is considered it is a departure from the traditional point of view and one can see a higher harmony.

  

I shall roughly quote his view one positive and the other negative.

  

Sri Aurobindo says and it brings to mind the Vedic Purusha sukta.

If the whole human race were taken as the body of the Divine Purusha, then he guides us to see that where ever the divine is manifest as the thinker he is the Brahmans, manifest as courage and honour he is the Kshatriya, wherever as creativity and harmony he is the vaishya and divine as selfless service he is the sudra. We all contain the four Varnas within us but we also have a persistent and predominant predeliction and that determines varna "

  

I'm adding her email so that we can loop her to this discussion
