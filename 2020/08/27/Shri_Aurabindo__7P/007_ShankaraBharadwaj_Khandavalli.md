Namaste,

  

Yes, his commentary on Gita is a classic exposition. Essays on the Gita is the book.

  

Regarding Karma bhakti jnana etc "Synthesis of Yoga" is the book.

  

He does not reject anything but puts everything in perspective and that is the wonderful thing about him. That includes triguna and Varna too (though that is explained in other works).

  

Integral yoga as he calls his philosophy, he also does not see Gita as highlighting one specific spiritual philosophy but as a holistic compendium.

  

Shankar
