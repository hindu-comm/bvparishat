Dear Sastryji,

  

I am reminded of a recent interview of the noted Playback singer Asha Bhonsale. She had been to the US and where she happened to visit a studio (electronic laboratory). The technician told her that they had reproduced he songs with the help of a machine. She asked him to play the machine produced song. When she head the song she only remarked 'Where is the bhava'. Will something similar not happen when a machine starts translating?

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
