**Abstract**

"The work in this paper presents a MTS from Sanskrit to English language using a hybridized form of direct and rule-based machine translation technique. This paper also discusses the language divergence among Sanskrit and English languages with a recommended solution to handle the divergence. The proposed system has used two bilingual dictionaries (Sanskrit–English, Sanskrit–UNL), a tagged Sanskrit corpus, a Sanskrit analysis rule base and an ELGR base. Elasticsearch technique has enhanced the translation speed of the proposed system for accessing the data from different data dictionaries and rule bases used for the system development. The system uses CFG in CNF for Sanskrit language processing and CYK parsing technique for processing the input Sanskrit sentence. This work also presents a novel algorithm which creates a parse tree from the parsing table. ELGR base and bilingual dictionaries generate the target language sentence. The proposed system is evaluated using natural language toolkit API in python and achieved a BLEU score of 0.7606, fluency score of 3.63 and adequacy score of 3.72. A comparison of the proposed system with state-of-the-art systems shows that the proposed system outperforms existing systems."
