Namaste Megh



1. Thanks for sharing an update on Machine Transaltion from Sanskrit to English.



2. The work has potential to trigger Panini Studies to build a ' Panini-Machine'.



 But the writing on the wall in this direction of purusit is clear. It leads ' Panini and Paninian langauge' to become ' lillitputian' in the realm of A.I/ MT/ IS and the like.



Why ? Because the exploration is built on unquestioned faulty axiom: Paninian Langauge is like english, a social conversational langauge, relatively better regulated by grammar and lexicon resources

to help programming.

Outcome of pursuing this axiom: Samskruth langauge analysis
gets modelled on English-likeness and processed- compiled -delivered with the roman character set combinatronics rules.

This angliczation of Panini -study saps out the essence of language :Samskruth ( and along with it, several indian langauges associated with Samskrutham).



3. There are several layers of fine print unaddressed issues and ' sleeping cells' in building this model. My note may serve as a
caution note, rather than ciriticism.

I do appreciate the contribution of all serious researchers who have combined Langauge and technology studies in relation to Samskrutham.



 Just for a beginners read, on why I am having concerns, please
take a look at the deep down fine prints, at
<https://www.doi.org/doi_handbook/TOC.html>, under the headings of Data encoding for Sanskrit abugida script handling related originating from Unicode. The prime backer of this initiaitve seems to be Digital Object Identifier Foundation Inc. (IDF) , a non-stock membership corporation organized and existing under and by virtue of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, USA, registered on 10 October 1997, corporate registered address is via CT Corporation: The Corporation Trust Company, Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington DE 19801, USA. The operational address of the Foundation is: The DOI Foundation, c/o EDitEUR Limited, United House, North Road, London N79 DP, UK. The DOI structure and extended arms and network seem not to be still at India ( unless I missed some it).





4. It is for those who love Panini in Digital World need to define how the machines needs to work with Paninian rules for Language:Samskrutham. And ensure that Panini is interpreted and compiled by right modeling
of langauge and process structures.



How may we work together for this goal?

BVK Sastry
