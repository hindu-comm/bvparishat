namaH sarvebhyo

  

I have heard this wordनिकान्त, either in a devotional song or a stotra (... can't remember)

but am unable to find its meaning and derivation.

  

I see many individuals (males) with that as their first name.

  

Could someone who knows the meaning of निकान्त and its derivation, please share it?

  

Regards

Prabhu
