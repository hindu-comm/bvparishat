Namaskar,

  

It is interesting to note that on Pateti, sun transits to the sign of Leo. I am not making any claim, just an observation. Also, on the day of spring equinox, the day of Navroz sun enters the sign of Aries (as per western astrology).

  

Further, Pateti, is widely celebrated in India and Pakistan.

  

Thus, Parsis being sun worshipers, observe new year considering the sun. Sun is the lord of the astrological sign Leo. That could be the reason.

  

This is just a thought from an observation. Please correct me if I am wrong.

  

Thanks and regards

Rucha Kelkar
